Personal Linda Bebko was born in Erie, Pennsylvania, and graduated from Villa Maria Academy in 1964. She attended the Erie Business Academy from 1964 to 1965. Prior to elective office, she spent time working as an alcohol and drug counselor and said that she had been an alcoholic herself in the past. Later on, she was director of Women Against Sexual Harassment from 1989 to 1992 and a caseworker for Community House for Women from 1990 to 1991. Her career in politics began with a stint as an administrative assistant for Pennsylvania State Senator A. Buzz Andrezeski from 1984 to 1989, moving on to become a caseworker for former United States Senator Harris Wofford in 1990. Her husband, Tom Jones, died in 2001 after a bout with throat and neck cancer. She died on November 20, 2011, aged 65. Political career =Early career= Bebko-Jones was first elected to represent the 1st District in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 1992, defeating freshman incumbent Ken Kruszewski in the Democratic primary. She went on to defeat Republican Jerry Knight, an aide to Rep. Phil English, in the general election by 1,100 votes. Bebko-Jones easily won the 1994 election by over 5,000 votes over Jerry Podolsky. In 1996 and 2000, she ran unopposed for re-election and in 1998, she won after her GOP opponent quit the race and tried to withdraw from the ballot. =2004 election= In the 2004 Democratic primary election, Bebko-Jones faced Jim Herdzik. His challenge came on the heels of a scandal involving a fire in her district office. Immediately after the fire, there were reports that it has been caused by Bebko-Jones leaving a lit cigarette in the office. The fire marshal never conclusively determined the cause, only that it was accidental. After the repairs were made to the office, Bebko-Jones moved out prior to lease expiration, claiming that the air inside the building was unhealthy. Eventually, her landlord agreed to a settlement with the state at the taxpayer's expense. Herdzik even rented the former office as a campaign headquarters, highlighting the incident. On election day, Bebko-Jones won easily with 60% of the vote. =Campaign for Erie Mayor= In 2005, she ran for mayor of Erie against incumbent Rick Filippi, who had been indicted on corruption charges. Bebko-Jones ultimately finished third in the race, behind Joseph Sinnott who went on to become mayor. Retirement and indictment Bebko-Jones was forced to withdraw from the 2006 Democratic primary when questions arose over the propriety of her nomination petitions. Pat Harkins won the primary and went on to win the general election. In November 2007, a statewide grand jury was convened to investigate abnormalities in Bebko-Jone's nominating petitions for the 2006 Democratic primary. On February 28, 2007, Pennsylvania Attorney General Tom Corbett charged Bebko-Jones and her former chief-of-staff with forging nominating petitions and submitting the fraudulent forms to the Secretary of the Commonwealth. On August 6, 2008, Bebko-Jones and her former chief of staff Mary B. Fiolek each pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor charges of forging and submitting false signatures and criminal conspiracy. Jones was ordered to perform 200 hours of community service and Fiolek 100 hours. In 2007, it was revealed that Bebko-Jones, as a lame duck legislator, attended legislative training trips at the public's expense after her defeat.

A high percentage of words in a natural language are words which out of context can be assigned more than one part of speech. The percentage of these ambiguous words is typically around 30%, although it depends greatly on the language. Solving this problem is very important in many areas of natural language processing. For example in machine translation changing the part-of- speech of a word can dramatically change its translation. Sliding window based part-of-speech taggers are programs which assign a single part-of-speech to a given lexical form of a word, by looking at a fixed sized \\"window\\" of words around the word to be disambiguated. The two main advantages of this approach are: * It is possible to automatically train the tagger, getting rid of the need of manually tagging a corpus. * The tagger can be implemented as a finite state automaton (Mealy machine) Formal definition Let :\\\\Gamma = \\\\\\\\{ \\\\gamma_{1}, \\\\gamma_{2}, \\\\ldots, \\\\gamma_{|\\\\Gamma|} \\\\\\\\} be the set of grammatical tags of the application, that is, the set of all possible tags which may be assigned to a word, and let :W = \\\\\\\\{ w1, w2, \\\\ldots \\\\\\\\} be the vocabulary of the application. Let : T : W \\\\rightarrow P ( \\\\Gamma ) be a function for morphological analysis which assigns each w its set of possible tags, T ( w ) \\\\subseteq \\\\Gamma, that can be implemented by a full-form lexicon, or a morphological analyser. Let :\\\\Sigma = \\\\\\\\{ \\\\sigma_{1}, \\\\sigma_{2}, \\\\ldots, \\\\sigma_{|\\\\Sigma|} \\\\\\\\} be the set of word classes, that in general will be a partition of W with the restriction that for each \\\\sigma \\\\in \\\\Sigma all of the words w, \\\\Sigma, \\\\sigma will receive the same set of tags, that is, all of the words in each word class \\\\sigma belong to the same ambiguity class. Normally, \\\\Sigma is constructed in a way that for high frequency words, each word class contains a single word, while for low frequency words, each word class corresponds to a single ambiguity class. This allows good performance for high frequency ambiguous words, and doesn't require too many parameters for the tagger. With these definitions it is possible to state problem in the following way: Given a text w[1] w[2] \\\\ldots w[L] \\\\in W^* each word w[t] is assigned a word class T ( w[t] ) \\\\in \\\\Sigma (either by using the lexicon or morphological analyser) in order to get an ambiguously tagged text \\\\sigma[1] \\\\sigma[2] \\\\ldots \\\\sigma[L] \\\\in W^*. The job of the tagger is to get a tagged text \\\\gamma[1] \\\\gamma[2] \\\\ldots \\\\gamma[L] (with \\\\gamma[t] \\\\in T(\\\\sigma[t])) as correct as possible. A statistical tagger looks for the most probable tag for an ambiguously tagged text \\\\sigma[1] \\\\sigma[2] \\\\ldots \\\\sigma[L]: :\\\\gamma^*[1] \\\\ldots \\\\gamma^*[L] = \\\\operatorname{\\\\arg\\\\,max}_{\\\\gamma[t] \\\\in T(\\\\sigma[t])} p(\\\\gamma[1] \\\\ldots \\\\gamma[L] \\\\sigma[1] \\\\ldots \\\\sigma[L]) Using Bayes formula, this is converted into: :\\\\gamma^*[1] \\\\ldots \\\\gamma^*[L] = \\\\operatorname{\\\\arg\\\\,max}_{\\\\gamma[t] \\\\in T(\\\\sigma[t])} p(\\\\gamma[1] \\\\ldots \\\\gamma[L]) p(\\\\sigma[1] \\\\ldots \\\\sigma[L] \\\\gamma[1] \\\\ldots \\\\gamma[L]) where p(\\\\gamma[1] \\\\gamma[2] \\\\ldots \\\\gamma[L]) is the probability that a particular tag (syntactic probability) and p(\\\\sigma[1] \\\\dots \\\\sigma[L] \\\\gamma[1] \\\\ldots \\\\gamma[L]) is the probability that this tag corresponds to the text \\\\sigma[1] \\\\ldots \\\\sigma[L] (lexical probability). In a Markov model, these probabilities are approximated as products. The syntactic probabilities are modelled by a first order Markov process: :p(\\\\gamma[1] \\\\gamma[2] \\\\ldots \\\\gamma[L]) = \\\\prod_{t=1}^{t=L} p(\\\\gamma[t+1] \\\\gamma[t]) where \\\\gamma[0] and \\\\gamma[L+1] are delimiter symbols. Lexical probabilities are independent of context: :p(\\\\sigma[1] \\\\sigma[2] \\\\ldots \\\\sigma[L] \\\\gamma[1] \\\\gamma[2] \\\\ldots \\\\gamma[L]) = \\\\prod_{t=1}^{t=L} p(\\\\sigma[t] \\\\gamma[t]) One form of tagging is to approximate the first probability formula: :p(\\\\sigma[1] \\\\sigma[2] \\\\ldots \\\\sigma[L] \\\\gamma[1] \\\\gamma[2] \\\\ldots \\\\gamma[L]) = \\\\prod_{t=1}^{t=L} p(\\\\gamma[t] C_{(-)}[t] \\\\sigma[t] C_{(+)}[t]) where C_{(-)}[t] = \\\\sigma[t - N_{(-)}] \\\\sigma [t - N_{(-)}] \\\\ldots \\\\sigma[t - 1] is the right context of the size N_{(+)}. In this way the sliding window algorithm only has to take into account a context of size N_{(-)} + N_{(+)} + 1. For most applications N_{(-)} = N_{(+)} = 1. For example to tag the ambiguous word \\"run\\" in the sentence \\"He runs from danger\\", only the tags of the words \\"He\\" and \\"from\\" are needed to be taken into account.

Originally published by the Fondo de Cultura Econ√≥mica in 1987, the first U.S. edition was published in 1989 by Farrar, Straus & Giroux. The basic structure of the work, including the story of the character from conception to birth, comes directly from Laurence Sterne‚Äôs eighteenth century novel The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman (1759‚Äì1767), to which Fuentes refers openly in the novel. The social satire story is set in Mexico in 1992, which was still a few years into the future when it was written. It follows the character Christopher's entire life in a cataclysmic Mexico on the brink of economic collapse. Other characters in the novel are Angel Palomar y Fagoaga, Angeles Palomar y Fagoaga, Don Homero Fagoaga, Don Fernando Benitez, Lady Mamadoc, Concha Toro, Matamoros Moreno, D. C. Buckley, and Will Gingerich. Fuentes depicts a dark future for Mexico. It is a story about disaster and survival. The lead character Christopher Palomar, a wonder boy with excellent language skills and total recall, is the narrator who travels through this pessimistic future, where the people still struggle since the last big earthquake in 1985. The novel has a chapter for each of the nine described months of the story, spread out over Christopher's whole life, as he follows in his parents' steps, as they try to save themselves in a chaotic country entering into twilight.

It spans a range of \\"discipline areas\\" consisting of the Schools of Chemical Engineering and Analytical Science; Chemistry; Petroleum Engineering; Computer Science; Earth, Atmospheric and Environmental Science; Physics and Astronomy; Electrical & Electronic Engineering; Materials; Mathematics; and Mechanical, Aerospace and Civil Engineering. The faculty includes most former UMIST departments, exceptions being Optometry and Neurosciences (now in the Faculty of Life Sciences), Manchester School of Management (now part of Manchester Business School MBS), and part of the Department of Computation which was split between the School of Computer Science and MBS. The duplicated departments of Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics were merged, and Materials Science was already a joint department. In terms of the total number of staff and student numbers the faculty is larger than the whole of UMIST, which was until 1993 the Faculty of Technology of the Victoria University of Manchester (paradoxically at the same time as being an independent institution). The faculty offices are housed in the Sackville Street Building, the former UMIST Main Building. The first Dean of the Faculty was Professor John Perkins, who joined the new university in 2004. Before appointment as Dean of EPS Professor Perkins was Principal of the Faculty of Engineering and Courtaulds Professor of Chemical Engineering at Imperial College London. He was succeeded in 2009 by Prof Colin Bailey, who was head of the School of Mechanical, Aerospace and Civil Engineering. Bailey took over as acting dean on Perkins departure to become provost of the Masdar Institute of Science and Technology in May 2009, and was confirmed as Dean in December the same year. He was replaced by the current dean by Chemist Martin Schr√∂der in 2015. In April 2016 the name was changed to the Faculty of Science and Engineering. History The University of Manchester has a long and distinguished record of achievement in science and engineering disciplines, and a history of breaking new ground. Rutherford began his work on splitting the atom at the University (and later received the Nobel Prize in 1908 for his work on radioactivity). The world's first electronic stored-program computer, the Manchester Baby, came into being at the University, as did its successor, the Manchester Mark 1. The University of Manchester was the birthplace of Chemical Engineering. The world's first steerable radio telescope at Jodrell Bank was built at the University by Bernard Lovell. Since 1906, when former student Joseph Thompson won the Nobel Prize in Physics, the faculty and its antecedent institutions have produced more than 11 Nobel laureates in Physics out of the 25 awarded to staff or students of the University of Manchester as a whole. Most recently, Manchester physicists Andre Geim and Kostya Novoselov won the 2010 Nobel Prize in Physics for their pioneering work with graphene. The University's history is closely linked to Manchester's emergence as the world's first industrial city. Manchester businessmen and industrialists established the Mechanics' Institute to ensure that their workers could learn the basic principles of science. Similarly, John Owens, a Manchester textile merchant, left a bequest of ¬£96,942 in 1851 for the purpose of founding a college for the education of males on non-sectarian lines. Owens College was established and granted a royal charter in 1880 to become England's first civic university, The Victoria University of Manchester. Industrial links By 1905, the two institutions were a large and active force in the area, with the Mechanics' Institute, the forerunner of the modern UMIST, forming a Faculty of Technology and working alongside The Victoria University of Manchester. Although UMIST achieved independent university status in 1955, the two universities continued to work together, true to the visions of their pioneering industrialist founders, until they formally combined on 22 October 2004 to form a single university. The Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences became home to a $100 million international research centre (2012), known as the BP International Centre for Advanced Materials (BP-ICAM). BP-ICAM is modelled on a ‚Äúhub and spoke‚Äù structure, with the ‚Äòhub‚Äô located at The University of Manchester and the ‚Äúspokes‚Äù located at the University of Cambridge, Imperial College London, and the University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign.

The country has an exclusive economic zone of , which is 73% of the country's land area. On the other hand, Bangladesh is a small and developing country overloaded with almost unbearable pressure of human population. In the past, people of Bangladesh were mostly dependent upon land- based proteins. But, the continuous process of industrialisation and urbanisation consumes the limited land area. Now there is no other way than to harvest the vast under water protein from the Bay of Bengal, which can meet the country's demand. More than 80 percent of the animal protein in the Bangladeshi diet comes from fish. Fish accounted for 6 percent of GDP in the fiscal year of 1970, nearly 50 percent more than modern industrial manufacturing at that time. Most commercial fishermen are low-caste Hindus who eke out the barest subsistence working under primitive and dangerous conditions. They bring a high degree of skill and ingenuity to their occupation; a few of the most enterprising ones are aided by domesticated otters, which behave like shepherds, swimming underwater, driving fish toward the fisherman's net (and being rewarded themselves with a share of the catch). Fish for local consumption are generally of freshwater varieties. Shrimp farming As of the end of 1987, prevailing methods for culturing shrimp in Bangladesh were still relatively unsophisticated, and average yields per hectare were low. In the late 1980s, almost all inland shrimping was done by capture rather than by intensive aquaculture. Farmers relied primarily on wild postlarval and juvenile shrimp as their sources of stock, acquired either by trapping in ponds during tidal water exchange or by gathering from local estuaries and stocking directly in the ponds. Despite the seemingly low level of technology applied to shrimp aquaculture, it became an increasingly important part of the frozen seafood industry in the mid-1980s. The shrimp farming industry in Bangladesh has been handicapped by low-quality and low prices. The World Bank and the Asian Development Bank financed projects to develop shrimp aquaculture in the 1980s. Much of the emphasis was on construction of modern hatcheries. Private investors were also initiating similar projects to increase capacity and to introduce modern technology that would increase average yields. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has provided assistance to the shrimp and fishing industry in meeting fish safety and quality control standards based on the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) approach. Shrimp in the wild are associated with mangrove. Mangrove estuaries such as those found in the Sundarbans of southwestern Bangladesh are especially rich productive ecosystems and provide the spawning grounds for shrimp and fish. Intensive shrimp farming often involves conversion of mangrove stands to brine ponds where shrimp are grown. Training and education Training for the fishing industry of Bangladesh, as well as for merchant shipping and related maritime industries is provided by the Bangladesh Marine Fisheries an Academy. Labor practices Shrimp and dried fish are emblematic of Bangladeshi cuisine. However, according to a 2014 Bureau of International Labor Affairs report, they also rank among the goods that are produced by child labour and forced labour in Bangladesh. The US Department of Labor also reported that \\"some children work under forced labor conditions in the dried fishing sector to help their families pay off debts to local moneylenders\\". Classified as \\"aquacultural goods\\" in the Public Library of US Diplomacy's TVPRA Response on the production of goods under child labour conditions in Bangladesh, the Government of Bangladesh recognises that \\"some of the worst forms of child labor may exist in the rural sector (e.g. fish drying) and has been working with the ILO and other donors to craft an appropriate development program response.\\" See also *List of fish in Bangladesh *Agriculture in Bangladesh References External links Economy of Bangladesh ","title":"Fishing in Bangladesh"},{"id":"16021818","text":"The School of Biological Sciences is a School within the Faculty Biology, Medicine and Health at The University of Manchester.

His teaching load was reduced by the creation of independent chairs in geology (1874), and zoology (1879). Williamson embodied a traditional view of natural history, with its strong bias to taxonomic classification. From the 1860s onwards this approach began to change under the influence of German university biologists. The appointment of Arthur Milnes Marshall (1852‚Äì1893) as professor of zoology at Owens in 1879 led to the adoption of this 'new biology' approach at Manchester. Marshall had been trained by these methods at Cambridge. Marshall modernised the zoology curriculum, introduced courses in elementary biology and embryology, and lobbied for the establishment of dedicated research laboratories. In 1887, the Beyer laboratories were opened, funded by a local industrialist, C. F. Beyer; they were conveniently placed next to the Manchester Museum.The Beyer Laboratories Marshall's career ended when he was killed in a climbing accident. Marshall was succeeded by Sydney Hickson (1859‚Äì1940) in 1894 who held the chair until 1926. He was a marine zoologist and an expert in the study of corals. Under Hickson the department saw steady growth in staff and students, with the emergence of distinct research specialisms. On his retirement in 1926, he was succeeded by J. S. Dunkerly (1881‚Äì1930) a protozoologist and an authority on Flagellates from the University of Glasgow who died in 1931. Herbert Graham Cannon (1897‚Äì1963), previously professor of zoology at Sheffield, was elected to the Beyer chair in his place. In 1948 R. Dennell was appointed professor of experimental zoology.Charlton, H. B. (1951) Portrait of a University. Manchester: University Press; p. 177 The current holder of the Beyer Chair is Professor Andrew Loudon, who studies biological clocks in animals. During the 1960s and 1980s the work of the Department included J. Gordon Blower's work on the population genetics of millipedes, RR Askew's work on parasitic and other insects, Yalden's on the distribution of fauna in the Peak District National Park and the mammals of Ethiopia, Gabbutt's on the biology of the pseudoscorpions,P. D. Gabbutt (1970) \\"Validity of Life History Analyses of Pseudoscorpions\\". Journal of Natural History; 4: 1‚Äì15. R. D. Butler's on the contractile systems in protozoa, and Roger Wood's on the genetics of mosquitoes. By the 1980s, it was recognised that some of the distinctions between the traditional biological disciplines were no longer as relevant as in the past and the University instituted a major review of the biological sciences at the University. A working party was established under Professor John Willmott that recommended greater integration in teaching and research between traditional biological disciplines, and a closer relationship between biological and medical departments. This led to the creation of a School of Biological Sciences in 1986, based on four divisions: biochemistry and molecular biology, cell and structural biology, environmental biology and physiological sciences. Nine departments of the faculties of science and medicine were abolished, including Botany and Zoology. Professor A. P. J. (Tony) Trinci (a microbiologist) was the first chairman of the School of Biological Sciences. Fourteen members of the Department of Botany joined the new division of cell and structural biology, and six became part of environmental biology.

Guthrie 1982- (?) =Department of Botany (Victoria University of Manchester, 1879‚Äì1986)= Botany has been also taught at Manchester since 1851GB 133 DBO - Archive of the University of Manchester, Department of Botany when William Crawford Williamson (1816‚Äì1896) was appointed as professor of natural history, anatomy and physiology. Williamson originally taught botany, zoology, geology and comparative anatomy. This teaching burden was reduced with the establishment of chairs in geology (1872) and zoology (1879), and with the creation of the Medical School in 1872 eventually allowing Williamson to concentrate on botany. As in zoology, there was an initial concentration on taxonomy until the newer systematic ideas took hold. The sculpture on the Williamson Building New botanical laboratories were added west of the Beyer building in 1911, including a physiological laboratory, and remained in use until the 1970s, when the Department was transferred to the Williamson building. In the 1930s research interests were developed in horticulture, assisted by funds from the Royal Botanical Society of Manchester. A plant geneticist F. W. Sansome (1902‚Äì1981) was appointed as lecturer in horticulture in 1935, and land was acquired at Jodrell Bank in Cheshire for experimental research in horticulture. This was later used as the site of the famous Jodrell Bank Observatory and Lovell Telescope. On the formation of the new School of Biological Sciences fourteen members of the Department of Botany joined the new division of cell and structural biology, and six became part of environmental biology. The named chairs on botany included: Harrison Professors of Botany: * William Crawford Williamson 1851‚Äì1892 (originally as professor of natural history) * Frederick Ernest Weiss 1892‚Äì1930 * James Montagu Frank Drummond FRSE 1930‚Äì1946 * Eric Ashby 1946‚Äì1950 * S.

But ultimately the motivation for reform was an assessment by the UGC that was critical of all biological sciences in Manchester. While Physiology and Anatomy fared best they were only rated as 'Average'. Biochemistry, Botany, and Zoology were all 'Below Average', the lowest rank attributable. Biological science in Manchester not only ranked well below Cambridge, Oxford and the London Colleges but was also worse than its civic university competitors such as Liverpool and Leeds and as well as many newer universities such as Reading, Southampton, Swansea and Leicester. A new School of Biological Sciences was created in 1986 with four new departments: Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Cell and Structural Biology, Physiological Sciences, and Environmental Biology. In 1993 the departments were combined to create a single department school; Keith Gull, as Head of Biochemistry and Research Dean, was heavily involved in these developments. Concentration on the application of molecular biology techniques to address biological research issues led to a marked improvement in the levels achieved in research and, by extension, teaching as measured by external assessment. This was also reflected in a marked increase in funding from research councils and charities and in the higher profile life sciences gained within the university.Wilson, D (2008) Reconfiguring Biological Sciences in the Late Twentieth Century: a Study of the University of Manchester. Manchester University, Chs. 5-9 =Department of Biomolecular Sciences (UMIST, 1959‚Äì2004)= Known by a number of names during its lifespan, the department was formed as the Department of Biochemistry, under Professor Alan Eddy, in 1959. It was created from the previously-existing Brewing Chemistry department. In the early 1980s the then novel discipline of molecular biology was introduced with the appointment of Paul Broda to a chair in this field, the department subsequently being known as Biochemistry and Applied Molecular Biology (BAMBi). The department was particularly strong in the molecular biology of yeast, under the direction of Stephen Oliver.Wilson, pp. 16, 26 In 1992 the Oliver group co-ordinated the production of the first complete DNA sequence of an entire chromosome, chromosome III of the yeast S. cerevisiae.Oliver, S.

The prominence of molecular biology approaches and industrial relevance at UMIST acted to some extent as a paradigm for the reorganisation of biological sciences which took place in the second half of the 1980s and early 1990s at the Victoria University of Manchester; however, medical rather than industrial relevance was to take a more prominent role at the latter institution.Wilson, pp. 27‚Äì28 Some medically relevant research was also carried out in the UMIST department, which had a leukaemia research unit and a group working on the molecular biology of malaria parasites. During the 1990s biological sciences saw considerable expansion within UMIST, including the creation of new professorial chairs and the appointment of a considerable number of new lecturers. The disciplines of biotechnology and structural biology were especially prominent in the research interests of the new appointments. In this period the name of the department changed, once again, to 'Biomolecular Sciences' (BMS). The research strengths within the Life Sciences at UMIST and the Victoria University of Manchester had relatively limited overlap, and were to a degree complementary, when the merger of the two universities took place in 2004.Wilson, p. 104 Faculty of Life Sciences (UoM 2004-2016) The Faculty of Life Sciences was one of the four faculties that comprised the University of Manchester. It was established in 2004 from the merger of its constituent departments: Biological Sciences and the Centre for the History of Science, Technology & Medicine in the Victoria University of Manchester and Biomolecular Sciences and Optometry & Neuroscience at UMIST. Uniquely for Manchester it was a faculty consisting of only one school. On 25 June 2015 Manchester University announced the results of a review of the position of life sciences as a separate faculty. In August 2016 the faculty was dismantled in a restructuring exercise, reducing the number of faculties in the university from four to three. The majority of the personnel of the faculty were incorporated into a new Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, with a substantial minority moving to the Faculty of Science and Engineering. The term Life sciences is generally understood to be wider than biology, including for example interdisciplinary areas that lie between biology and medicine. The inclusion of Optmetry and Neuroscience in the Faculty reflects this intention while some other areas generally included in a definition of Life Sciences, such as Biomedical Imaging and Pharmacy, are located in the Faculty of Medical and Human Sciences at Manchester. As of 2008, the Faculty taught 2200 undergraduate students, had 467 postgraduate students and 270 academic staff.Faculty of Life Sciences, About us Accessed 1 January 2009 In the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise the Faculty came 3rd in the UK on the basis of Grade Point Average for Biological Sciences with 107 staff submitted, and 2nd in the UK for Preclinical and Human Biological Sciences with 72 staff submitted. Science communication and public engagement =The Life Sciences Podcast/Broadcast= The School of Biological Sciences had its own long-running podcast (and later video broadcast), where scientists within the faculty are interviewed about their research, as well as recently published high-impact papers, books and events they are involved with. Past guests include established researchers such as professor Daniel Davis, author of The Compatibility Gene', Dr David Kirby, author of Lab coats in Hollywood, Dr. Sheena Cruickshank, winner of the Society of Biology Science Communication award (2013) and nobel prize winner Sir John Sulston. The podcast also features interviews with budding new scientists within the school, including high-achieving undergraduates and PhD students, such as the Manchester iGEM team. The broadcasts later went on to explore broader themes within Life Sciences.

They may be physical or digital, and can be effective presentation tools.  Uses  Graphic designers, interior designers, industrial designers, photographers and other creative artists use mood boards to visually illustrate the style they wish to pursue. However, these boards can also be used by design professionals to visually explain a certain style of writing, or an imaginary setting for a story line. In short, mood boards are not limited to visual subjects, but serve as a visual tool to quickly inform others of the overall \\"feel\\" (or \\"flow\\") of an idea.

A planetary mnemonic refers to a phrase used to remember the planets and dwarf planets of the Solar System, with the order of words corresponding to increasing sidereal periods of the bodies. One simple visual mnemonic is to hold out both hands side-by-side with fingers spread and thumbs in the same direction, with the fingers of one hand representing the terrestrial planets, and the other hand the gas giants. The first thumb represents the Sun and asteroid belt, including Ceres, and the second thumb represents the asteroid belt and trans-Neptunian objects, including Pluto. Nine planets An English-language mnemonic which was current in the 1950s was \\"Men Very Easily Make Jugs Serve Useful Needs, Perhaps\\" (for Mercury Venus Earth Mars Jupiter Saturn Uranus Neptune Pluto). The structure of this sentence suggests that it may have originated before Pluto's discovery, and can easily be trimmed back to reflect Pluto's demotion. Another common English-language mnemonic for many years was \\"My Very Educated (or Eager) Mother Just Served Us Nine Pizzas\\". Other mnemonics include \\"My Very Elegant Mother Just Sat Upon Nine Porcupines\\", \\"My Very Energetic Mother Jumps Skateboards Under Nana's Patio\\" and \\"Mary‚Äôs violet eyes make Johnnie stay up nights pondering\\", as well as the apt \\"My Very Easy Method Just Shows Us Nine Planets\\", \\"My Very Efficient Memory Just Stores Up Nine Planets\\" and \\"My Very Easy Method Just Speeds Up Naming Planets\\". Yet another is \\"Many Volcanoes Emit Mulberry Jam Sandwiches Under Normal Pressure\\". However, many of these mnemonics were made obsolete by the 2006 definition of planet, which reclassified Pluto (as well as Ceres and Eris) as a dwarf planet. Eight planets When Pluto was demoted to a dwarf planet, mnemonics could no longer include the final \\"P\\". The first notable suggestion came from Kyle Sullivan of Lumberton, Mississippi, USA, whose mnemonic was published in the Jan. 2007 issue of Astronomy magazine: \\"My Violent Evil Monster Just Scared Us Nuts\\". In August 2006, for the eight planets recognized under the new definition, Phyllis Lugger, professor of astronomy at Indiana University suggested the following modification to the common mnemonic for the nine planets: \\"My Very Educated Mother Just Served Us Nachos\\". She proposed this mnemonic to Owen Gingerich, Chair of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) Planet Definition Committee and published the mnemonic in the American Astronomical Society Committee on the Status of Women in Astronomy Bulletin Board on August 25, 2006. It also appeared in Indiana University's IU News Room Star Trak on August 30, 2006. This mnemonic is used by the IAU on their website for the public. Others angry at the IAU's decision to \\"demote\\" Pluto composed sarcastic mnemonics in protest. Schott's Miscellany by Ben Schott included the mnemonic, \\"Many Very Educated Men Justify Stealing Unique Ninth\\". Mike Brown, who discovered Eris, mentioned hearing \\"Many Very Educated Men Just Screwed Up Nature\\". One particular 9 planet mnemonic, \\"My very easy memory jingle seems useful naming planets\\", was easily changed once the demotion occurred, becoming the 8 planet mnemonic, \\"My very easy memory jingle seems useless now\\". Slightly risque versions include, \\"Mary's 'Virgin' Explanation Made Joseph Suspect Upstairs Neighbor\\" And perhaps simplest of all: \\"My Very Easy Method: Just SUN\\". Eleven planets and dwarf planets In 2007, the National Geographic Society sponsored a contest for a new mnemonic of MVEMCJSUNPE, incorporating the then- eleven known planets and dwarf planets, including Eris, Ceres, and the newly demoted Pluto. On February 22, 2008, \\"My Very Exciting Magic Carpet Just Sailed Under Nine Palace Elephants\\", coined by 10-year-old Maryn Smith of Great Falls, Montana, was announced as the winner. The phrase was featured in the song 11 Planets by Grammy-nominated singer and songwriter Lisa Loeb and in the book 11 Planets: A New View of the Solar System by David Aguilar (). (The song may be heard on-line.) Thirteen planets and dwarf planets Since the National Geographic competition, two additional bodies were designated as dwarf planets, Makemake and Haumea, on July 11 and September 17, 2008 respectively. A 2015 New York Times article suggested some mnemonics including, \\"My Very Educated Mother Cannot Just Serve Us Nine Pizzas‚ÄîHundreds May Eat!\\" Longer mnemonics will be required in the future, if more of the possible dwarf planets are recognized as such by the IAU. However, at some point enthusiasm for new mnemonics will wane as the number of dwarf planets exceeds the number that people will want to learn. (It is estimated that there may be 200 dwarf planets.)

Angola is a potentially rich agricultural country, with fertile soils, a favourable climate, and about 57.4 million ha of agricultural land, including more than 5.0 million ha of arable land. Before independence from Portugal in 1975, Angola had a flourishing tradition of family-based farming and was self- sufficient in all major food crops except wheat. The country exported coffee and maize, as well as crops such as sisal, bananas, tobacco and cassava. By the 1990s Angola produced less than 1% the volume of coffee it had produced in the early 1970s, while production of cotton, tobacco and sugar cane had ceased almost entirely. Poor global market prices and lack of investment have severely limited the sector since independence. The Angolan Civil War (1975‚Äì2002) and the consequent deterioration of the rural economy and neglect of the farming sector dealt the final blow to the country‚Äôs agricultural productivity. During the civil war most small-scale farmers reverted to subsistence farming. Angola has been dependent on commercial imports since 1977 and was heavily dependent up to the end of the war. The agriculture of Angola is currently expanding due to the end of the Angolan Civil War in 2002, and the growth of foreign investment in the sector. However, the return to productivity in rural areas is proving difficult and slow. Large areas cannot be cultivated because of landmines. Functioning infrastructure in rural areas is limited, and few incentives exist for people to return to farming. From 2003 to 2004 only 2.9 million ha of the available agricultural land was cultivated. Agriculture‚Äôs contribution to gross domestic product (GDP) ‚Äì including forestry and fisheries ‚Äì has been about 8%. Yet two thirds of the population still depend on agriculture for food, income and employment. About 80% of farmers throughout the country are smallholders. They cultivate very small plots of land, with very low agricultural productivity. Production Angola produced, in 2018: * 8.6 million tons of cassava (8th largest producer in the world); * 3.5 million tons of banana (7th largest producer in the world, or the 10th largest, if we consider together with plantain); * 2.2 million tons of maize; * 1.2 million tons of sweet potato (10th largest producer in the world); * 806 thousand tons of potato; * 597 thousand tons of pineapple (13th largest producer in the world); * 572 thousand tons of sugarcane; * 355 thousand tons of cabbage; * 314 thousand tons of beans; * 280 thousand tons of palm oil; * 154 thousand tons of peanut; In addition to smaller productions of other agricultural products, like coffee (16 thousand tons). Angola production in 2018, by FAO History Angolan potato farmers, 2011 By the end of the colonial period, a variety of crops and livestock were produced in Angola. In the north, cassava, coffee, and cotton were grown; in the central highlands, maize was cultivated; and in the south, where rainfall is lowest, cattle herding was prevalent. In addition, large plantations run by primarily Portuguese commercial farmers produced palm oil, sugarcane, bananas, and sisal. Peasant farmers also produced these crops and who sold their surplus to local Portuguese traders in exchange for supplies. The commercial farmers dominated the marketing for these crops, however, and enjoyed substantial support from the colonial government in the form of technical assistance, irrigation facilities, and financial credit. They produced the great majority of the crops that were marketed in the cities or exported.Louise Redvers, POVERTY-ANGOLA: NGOs Sceptical of Govt‚Äôs Rural Development Plans , [Inter Press Service News Agency] (June 6, 2009) Before 1975, Angola had a flourishing tradition of family-based farming and was self- sufficient in all major food crops except wheat. The country exported coffee and maize, as well as crops such as sisal, bananas, tobacco and cassava. By the 1990s, Angola was producing less than 1% of the volume of coffee it had produced in the early 1970s, while production of cotton, tobacco and sugar cane had ceased almost entirely. Poor global market prices and lack of investment severely limited the sector after independence. The Angolan Civil War (1975-2002) and the consequent deterioration of the rural economy and neglect of the farming sector dealt the final blow to the country‚Äôs agricultural productivity. The departure of Portuguese farmers and traders from rural Angola after independence undermined agricultural productivity. In response the government set up state farms on land formerly owned by the Portuguese and established the National Company for the Marketing and Distribution of Agricultural Products (Empr√™sa Nacional de Comercializa√ß√£o e Distribui√ß√£o de Produtos Agr√≠colas ‚Äì Encodipa) to maintain the rural trading system. Neither measure however, was successful, and by 1984 the government started phasing out the state farms and turning production over to individual farmers. In December 1985, the government also put most rural trade back into private hands. To help peasant farmers, the government established agricultural development stations and provided bank credits for small-scale agricultural projects. Several hundred state farms were to be turned over to associations of tenant farmers as an embryonic form of cooperative. The association would to buy or rent tools for shared use, share marketing initiatives to strengthen prices, and share transport. By the end of 1985, the Directorate of Farm Marketing controlled 4,638 farm cooperatives and 6,534 farmers' associations; but of these, only 93 cooperatives and 71 associations were operational. In the late 1980s, the country faced serious problems in resuscitating agricultural production. By 1988 the departure of the Portuguese, rural depopulation, and the physical isolation of the farming areas had almost totally halted commercial production of such cash crops as coffee and sisal, as well as the subsistence production of cereals. Production was stagnating because of marketing and transport difficulties; shortages of seed, fertilizer, and consumer goods for trade with peasant farmers; and the impact of the war on planting, harvesting, and yields. Land mines and fear of attacks had forced peasants to reduce the areas under cultivation, especially the fields far from their villages, and to abandon hope of harvesting some planted areas. Moreover, the internal migration of peasants to safer areas had resulted in the over-cultivation and decreased yields. Despite these obstacles, there were some successes. The relatively secure Hu√≠la Province maintained a fair level of production, and the reorientation of government policy away from inefficient state farms and toward peasant producers promised to provide services to and boost production by peasant farmers. By the end of 1987, there were twenty-five development stations providing services to peasant producers in ten provinces, and four more were being set up. Coffee Nowhere has the decline in agricultural production been more dramatic than in the coffee sector. Formerly Angola's leading export, by 1985 coffee exports had dropped to 8 percent of their 1973 level. Under colonial rule, about 2,500 large commercial farms and 250,000 peasants were involved in growing coffee. During the 1975-76 fighting, the owners, managers, and skilled technicians, as well as most of the migrant work force, abandoned the coffee estates, which were then nationalized. Suffering from a lack of skilled management and shortages of available labor in the rural areas, these coffee farms have continually posted losses. By 1985 the thirty-four state coffee companies produced only 8,890 tons of coffee and depended on government subsidies to stay in business. The government marketed only 4,700 tons from peasant producers in that year. In 1983 the government adopted an emergency program to revive the coffee industry. Local coffee companies, rather than the National Coffee Company (Empr√™sa Nacional de Caf√©--Encafe), were given the responsibility of running the state coffee farms, and, to encourage greater efficiency, the area under cultivation was reduced to less than one-fifth of the area abandoned by the large commercial coffee growers at independence. Aid for these efforts has been obtained from the French Central Board for Economic Cooperation (Caisse Centrale de Coop√©ration Economique ‚Äì CCCE) and two UN organizations, the WFP and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). The WFP was furnished with US$14.3 million on a five-year (1983‚Äì87) plan to pay coffee workers in food rather than in local currency in order to discourage worker absenteeism, one of the industry's most serious problems. In addition, the government, as part of its program of economic liberalization, was in the process of turning over the marketing of coffee to local, rather than national, organizations. Despite these efforts, however, in 1985 state coffee farms still had only about 50% of the required work force because of the general drain of rural depopulation and of the unattractive wages, paid in nearly-worthless kwanzas. The industry was still plagued by the UNITA insurgency, whose attacks had inflicted over US$4 million worth of damage on coffee plantations by 1985. Other problems encountered on the coffee plantations mirrored the general deterioration of the economic infrastructure. High charges for transportation of coffee and machinery and lack of facilities for hulling the coffee slowed and increased the cost of the entire production process. Some plantation managers complained that their workers were not productive, not only because of absenteeism but also because of their advanced age. The decline in coffee exports in the mid-1980s resulted largely from the depletion of stocks that had earlier cushioned exports as production declined. Exports to members of the International Coffee Organization (ICO) have remained fairly stable since 1983, but exports to non-ICO members, of which East Germany has been by far the most important market in the late 1980s, have declined. The fall in sales to the non-ICO market has eroded coffee earnings because these sales have traditionally been at substantially higher prices than those to ICO members. Exacerbating the decline in production and exports has been the depressed world market for coffee; from February 1986 to August 1987, ICO indicator prices dropped by more than 20 percent. Food crops and livestock The decline in marketed food crop production and the rapid growth of the urban population have caused a food crisis in the cities. By the mid-1980s, urban dwellers depended almost entirely on cereal imports, and the approximately 600,000 rural displaced persons were completely dependent on food aid from foreign donors. Local production of cereals met only half the national requirement in 1986 and totaled only about 300,000 tons ‚Äì about 60% of the yearly average in the mid-1970s. Decreased production was the result of general problems associated with the war, including deteriorating transportation and a lack of market incentives for peasant producers. By the late 1980s, malnutrition was widespread. Similarly, livestock production has declined. Both cattle and pigs are raised, but production fell from 36,500 tons slaughtered in 1973 to only 5,000 tons in the early 1980s. This tremendous decrease was the result of a combination of factors, including the departure of the commercial farmers, increasing disruption from the war and the deterioration of facilities and services, especially vaccinations, crucial for livestock production.

John More (February 24, 1745 - January 1, 1840) and his wife Betty Taylor More (1738 - October 13, 1823) had eight children: *John Taylor More (February 27, 1771 - June 23, 1857) *Robert More (July 8, 1772 - February 19, 1849) *Alexander Taylor More (January 5, 1775 - March 11, 1854) *Jonas More (March 22, 1778 - March 5, 1852) *Jean More Smith (April 3, 1780 - June 5, 1861) *James More (January 10, 1782 - May 9, 1866) *David More (January 11, 1786 - November 29, 1873) *Edward Livingston More (August 1, 1788 - August 13, 1867) From their eight children came 89 grandchildren, and well over 100 great-grandchildren. Today there are 14,000 recorded descendants. Among them are railroad baron Jay Gould, whose mother was a More, and James Hadley Billington, the U.S. Librarian of Congress. Demographics As of the 2000 Census, Grand Gorge had a population of 663. The community was not listed as a census-designated place in 2010 and therefore did not have population statistics gathered separately from its parent town of Roxbury.

Kilburn was a legislator in the New Hampshire General Court. A patent was granted for his gun-style camera. Early life The son of Josiah Kilburn, an iron founder who manufactured Franconia stoves, Benjamin received his education as a machinist in Fall River, Massachusetts, at age 16. After four years, Benjamin returned to Littleton, New Hampshire, to become a partner with his father in the Josiah Kilburn & Son foundry. Kilburn was a sergeant in Company D, 13th New Hampshire Volunteer Infantry, and participated with his unit in the Civil War Battle of Fredericksburg, Virginia. A mountaineer, Kilburn was active on Mount Washington in New Hampshire; in Ouray, Colorado; and in the Sierra Nevada of California, including Yosemite in 1872. Photography Stereograph of Boston Common by B.W. Kilburn Kilburn Brothers stereoviews date from about 1865. Published sources attribute their stereographs (stereo-photographs) before 1876 solely to Benjamin. His brother, Edward Kilburn (February 27, 1830 ‚Äì 1884), however, learned the art of photography from a local daguerreotypist, Ora C. Bolton, from neighboring Waterford, Vermont at an earlier date. Photographer O. C. Bolton also taught Franklin G. Weller of Littleton, New Hampshire. Weller became a notable stereo-photographer who would introduce comic views of a special local color and pioneer a popular line which appeared in later Kilburn subject categories. Bolton was connected with another early stereo-photographer, Franklin L. White of Lancaster, New Hampshire, who published a view list of glass stereographs in 1859. Early period Kilburn stereoviews were sold by Joseph L. Bates,Joseph L. Bates a retail outlet which specialized in Oliver Wendell Holmes stereo- viewers at his location on Washington Street, Boston. A Kilburn-Bates stereoview catalog was published about 1867. The Kilburn list reflected choices similar to those of Franklin L. White.Franklin L. White Bates commercial support gave Kilburn Brothers their first significant push in the marketplace. Kilburn Brothers and B. W. Kilburn Co. Sunset from the Glen House in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, one of several stereoscopic images Kilburn Brothers produced from the area near Mount Washington (New Hampshire) Stereoscopic photograph of the summit of Mount Washington (New Hampshire) and the Glen House stage coach by Kilburn Brothers circa 1872. The cog railway line also appears to be visible in the background along with the Summit House atop the peak Ellis River near Glen House Their first stereoscopic views were produced in Edward Kilburn's studio in the McCoy Block in Littleton. The location proved to be too small for their popularity. The business remained family-centered and was largely focused on local subjects and talent. Benjamin's daughter Elizabeth and her husband William Jackson were employees who helped to develop the quality product associated with Kilburn views. By 1868, a second larger viewshop was built at the Chutter Block location on Main Street. After the , a new factory was built on Cottage Street with more room to expand. Both of these larger viewshops were but one block from the Littleton railroad station. Young salesmen carried Kilburn views onto the trains and south to an ever-expanding audience. Today the site of the third viewshop is a state historic landmark. They quickly became the world's most extensive manufacturer of stereoscopic views. Edward Kilburn retired from the partnership about 1877, although the product continued to be identified as Kilburn Brothers until the late 1880s. John P. Soule, a famous stereo- photographer from Washington Street in Boston, was closely associated with the Kilburn Brothers. A significant number of his negatives were shipped to the Kilburn business of Littleton in 1881. Benjamin was active in the National Photographic Association. The new B. W. Kilburn & Company brought many changes in stereoscopic technology and audience. By 1890, Benjamin's second son-in- law, the attorney Daniel Clark Remich, had joined the board of the firm, as well as James M. Davis, agent for a growing army of door-to-door salesmen. Davis would in later years direct the day-to-day decisions of the firm. As general manager, located first in Philadelphia and later in New York and St. Louis, he used his cable address \\"Artistic\\" to direct production, send photographers to distant lands, and hire a sales force to distribute the views. The Columbian Exposition at Chicago in 1893 became the high-water mark for their business as they acquired exclusive rights to sell stereoscopic views of the World's Fair. The business was succeeded by several of its former salesmen and competitors including: W. F. Burns & Co. of St. Louis in 1910; Underwood & Underwood brothers of New York; B. L. Singley of the Keystone View Company; and others. Legacy Kilburn Gun Camera Benjamin W.

United States, 555 U.S. 135 (2009), was a case decided by the Supreme Court of the United States on January 14, 2009. The court decided that the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule applies when a police officer makes an arrest based on an outstanding warrant in another jurisdiction, but the information regarding that warrant is later found to be incorrect because of a negligent error by that agency.. Background =The evolution of the exclusionary rule= \\"The Fourth Amendment contains no provision expressly precluding the use of evidence obtained in violation of its commands,\\". but in Weeks v. United States (1914) and Mapp v. Ohio (1961), the Supreme Court created the exclusionary rule, which generally operates to suppress ‚Äì i.e. prevent the introduction at trial of ‚Äì evidence obtained in violation of Constitutional rights. \\"Suppression of evidence, however, has always been [the court's] last resort, not [its] first impulse. The exclusionary rule generates substantial social costs, which sometimes include setting the guilty free and the dangerous at large.\\" (quoting Leon, 468 U.S. at 907) (internal quotation marks omitted). In United States v. Leon, the Supreme Court clarified that the exclusionary rule \\"operates as a judicially created remedy designed to safeguard Fourth Amendment rights generally through its deterrent effect, rather than a personal constitutional right of the party aggrieved.\\" Leon, 468 U.S. at 906 (quoting (internal quotation marks omitted)). Application of the rule should be sensitive to this purpose, the court said: If suppression \\"does not result in appreciable deterrence,\\" the court had said, \\"its use ... is unwarranted.\\"Leon, 468 U.S. at 909 (quoting (internal quotation mark omitted)). Thus, for example, in Leon itself, the court concluded that the fruits of a search based on a search warrant later found defective should not be excluded because the rule's deterrent purpose \\"will only rarely be served by applying it in such circumstances,\\"Leon, 468 U.S. at 926. and in Arizona v. Evans, the court concluded that the fruits of a search based on an arrest warrant that was no longer valid, but that was still listed in the police system because of an error by the issuing court's clerk, should not be excluded because such exclusion would have no deterrent effect.See . =The beginnings of the Herring case= Bennie Herring drove to the Coffee County, Alabama, sheriff's department to check on a pickup truck that had been impounded. Mark Anderson, an investigator with the Coffee County Sheriff's Department, asked the department's warrant clerk to check for any outstanding warrants; the warrant clerk in the neighboring Dale County Sheriff's Department was contacted, and advised that there was an outstanding warrant. Within fifteen minutes, the Dale County clerk called back to warn the Coffee County sheriff's department that there had been a clerical mistake: the warrant had been recalled five months prior. But it was too late; Anderson had already arrested Herring and searched his vehicle, discovering firearms and methamphetamine. Herring was indicted in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama for violations of 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 922(g)(1) (felon in possession of a firearm) and 21 U.S.C. ¬ß 844(a) (possession of a controlled substance, viz. methamphetamine) and invoked the exclusionary rule to have both the firearm and drug evidence suppressed. He claimed that the arrest was unlawful as a result of an invalid/recalled warrant (\\"failure to appear\\", issued by neighboring Dale County, Alabama), a motion denied by the trial court. He was convicted, and sentenced to 27 months in federal prison. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed, ruling‚Äîbased on Leon‚Äîthat the evidence was admissible because the mistake was made by the Dale County officials, not the Coffee County police. Because the error was corrected in a very short time, there was no evidence that the Dale County Sheriff's Department had problems disposing of recalled warrants, and thus no negligence could be claimed because of the lack of a pattern of disposal problems. The Supreme Court of the United States granted certiorari on February 19, 2008. The case was argued before the Court on October 7, 2008. Result In a 5‚Äì4 decision hewing to Leon and Evans, the Court, speaking through Chief Justice Roberts, affirmed the trial court and the Eleventh Circuit. While noting that there had not necessarily been a constitutional violation in the case, the Court accepted for the sake of argument Herring's contention that there had been. On that stipulation, the court held that the exclusionary rule did not apply to a search that resulted from isolated and attenuated police negligence, holding that \\"[t]o trigger the exclusionary rule, police conduct must be sufficiently deliberate that exclusion can meaningfully deter it, and sufficiently culpable that such deterrence is worth the price paid by the justice system.\\" Suppression was unwarranted because an error in recordkeeping‚Äînot flagrant or deliberate misconduct‚Äîled to Herring's arrest. The Court also warned that it was not \\"suggest[ing] that all recordkeeping errors by the police are immune from the exclusionary rule. ... If the police have been shown to be reckless in maintaining a warrant system, or to have knowingly made false entries to lay the groundwork for future false arrests, exclusion would certainly be justified under our cases should such misconduct cause a Fourth Amendment violation.\\" Nevertheless, in the case at bar, \\"the [police] conduct at issue was not so objectively culpable as to require exclusion.\\" \\"[W]hen police mistakes are the result of negligence such as that described here, rather than systemic error or reckless disregard of constitutional requirements,\\" the Chief Justice wrote, \\"any marginal deterrence does not 'pay its way.'\\" Justice Ginsburg dissented, joined by Justices Stevens, Souter, and Breyer. She wrote that \\"the exclusionary rule provides redress for Fourth Amendment violations by placing the government in the position it would have been in had there been no unconstitutional arrest and search. The rule thus strongly encourages police compliance with the Fourth Amendment in the future.\\" The prosecution had contested the unlawful case in court because of contraband found on Herring's person and in his vehicle, but, Ginsburg wrote, narrowing the scope of the exclusionary rule would most typically hurt innocent persons who are wrongfully arrested. Reaction Writing shortly after the decision, SCOTUSblog author Tom Goldstein stated that the decision was of \\"surpassing significance\\"; but law professor and Fourth Amendment expert Orin Kerr suggested Goldstein was reading too much into the case, writing that Herring was best seen as \\"a narrow and interstitial decision, not one that is rocking the boat. ... I don't see it as suggesting a general good faith exception for police conduct ... [which is] why the dissenters didn't sound the alarm....\\" Around two weeks later, The New York Times' Adam Liptak expressed concern that the decision was a step towards overruling Mapp. Eight years later, a 2017 paper in the Journal of Criminal Law & Criminology concluded that \\"Herring invited evidence laundering by police and laid the groundwork for judicial approval of this practice\\", based on a case law examination of how state courts and lower federal courts had applied the Supreme Court decision since 2009.

Mo√ß√¢medes together with Luanda, Benguela and Lobito were the major fishing ports. =Independence and civil war period= Following independence and into the late 1980s, however, Angola's fishing industry had fallen into disarray, the result of the flight of the local white ethnic Portuguese professional fishermen and fishing industry entrepreneurs. After the April 1974 military coup in Lisbon, as the Portuguese Overseas Province of Angola's political situation deteriorated and the independence of the territory seemed inevitable, many fishing boats departed to Portugal with entire crews and their families. By 1986 only 70 of the 143 fishing boats in Mo√ß√¢medes (then called Namibe), the port that normally handled two-thirds of the Angolan catch before independence, were operable. Furthermore, most of the fish-processing factories were in need of repair. Once an exporter of fish meal, by 1986 Angola had insufficient supplies for its own market. Some of the foreign fishing fleets operating in Angolan waters were required by the government to land a portion of their catch at Angolan ports to increase the local supply of fish. Fishing agreements of this kind had been reached with the Soviet Union, which operated the largest number of boats in Angolan waters, and with Spain, Japan, and Italy. Spain also agreed to help rehabilitate the Angolan fishing industry in exchange for fishing rights. In other cases, the government allowed foreign fleets to export their entire catch in exchange for license fees. In the mid-1980s, the government began rehabilitating the fishing industry, especially in Namibe and Benguela provinces. The first priority was to replace and repair aging equipment. To accomplish this goal, the government was receiving a significant amount of foreign assistance. In 1987 the EEC announced plans to provide funds to help rebuild the Dack Doy shipyards and two canning plants in Tombua. Spain sold Angola thirty-seven steel-hull boats for US$70 million, and fourteen modern fishing boats were on order from Italy. =After 2002= From 2002 onward, with the end of the Angolan Civil War, increased safety, and the growing state revenue with oil, diamonds and other natural resource exploitation, Angola started a period of reconstruction and economic development. The fishing sector was gradually expanded and modernized and the enlargement of a newly created middle-class in the capital city, Luanda, widener and improved the fish consumption market in the country. Recreational fishing Angola is considered one of the best places in the world to catch Atlantic tarpon. Angola is also considered to be one of the best places in the world to catch Sailfish.

At P√©rignat there are still found remains of a Roman road and a necropolis with a sarcophagus and ceramic dated to the second century. In the Middle Ages the village had become a fief of the family of the lords of Cournon-d'Auvergne by the eleventh century. The village's name evolved to \\"Payrinhac,\\" as attested in an Occitan manuscript from 1240. By the fifteenth century, the village's name was extended to \\"P√©rignat oultre l'Allier\\" (\\"P√©rignat on the other side of the Allier River\\") and had become a possession of the lords of Montmorin.

The vehicle set the FIA world record for the flying mile at . Design and construction In 1956, Campbell began planning a car to break the land speed record, which then stood at set by John Cobb in the Railton Mobil Special. The Norris brothers, who had designed Campbell's highly successful Bluebird K7 hydroplane, designed Bluebird-Proteus CN7 with in mind. The CN7 (Campbell‚ÄìNorris 7) was constructed by Motor Panels in Coventry, supervised by Donald Stevens of Norris Bros & Maurice Britton of Motor Panels with Ken and Lew Norris as co-chief designers and was completed by the spring of 1960. Bluebird CN7 was the first land speed record vehicle to be powered by a gas turbine engine. The Bristol-Siddeley Proteus was the Bristol Aeroplane Company's first successful gas turbine engine design, and delivered with no thrust allowed by FIA, exhaust was limited to fill in aerodynamic disturbance at the rear. The Proteus was a two spool, reverse flow free-turbine turboshaft, because the turbine stages of the inner spool drove no compressor stages, but only a power shaft. The engine, a Proteus 705, was specially modified by Norris BrosDonald Stevens, CN7 design team and Project Co- Ordinator to have a power shaft at each end of the engine. These shafts are connected directly to final drive assemblies with differentials and fixed ratios of 3.6:1 providing power to all four wheels via half-shafts. The car weighs 4 tons and was built with an advanced aluminum honeycomb sandwich of immense strength, with a fully independent double wishbone suspension. The split-rim design wheels and diameter tyres were manufactured by Dunlop. The tyre inflation specification was set by Dunlop at greater than . When the car ran at Goodwood they were set to and for record attempts was used. Bluebird has a frontal area of and a drag coefficient of 0.16, giving it a Drag area of . Brakes consist of Girling disc brakes, inboard mounted (to reduce unsprung mass) at all four wheels. The brakes are hydraulically controlled with a back up pneumatic system operated from compressed air reservoirs. The brake discs measured in diameter and are capable of operating up to a maximum temperature of . Additional braking was provided by hydraulically powered air brakes that extended out from the rear of the vehicle. The turbine engine also provided approximately 500 hp of engine braking when the throttle was closed at , but this diminished as speed decreased.  Goodwood, 1960  Campbell demonstrated his Bluebird CN7 Land Speed Record car at Goodwood Circuit in July 1960, at its initial public launch and again in July 1962. The laps of Goodwood were effectively at 'tick-over' speed, because the car had only 4 degrees of steering lock, with a maximum of 100 mph on the straight on one lap. Its shakedown was actually at RAF Tangmere on the main runway in 1962. The press release photos were taken at Goodwood  Bonneville, 1960  Following the low-speed tests conducted at Goodwood, the CN7 was taken to the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah, USA, scene of Campbell's father's last LSR triumph in 1935. In early September, CN7 accelerated from a standing start to just under in 24 seconds covering 1.5 miles, using approximately 80 per cent of the engine's full power. The LSR attempt however, which was heavily sponsored by BP, Dunlop, and other British motor component companies, was unsuccessful and CN7 was severely damaged during a high-speed crash on 16 September. Campbell suffered a fracture to his lower skull, a broken ear drum, and cuts and bruises. He convalesced in California until November 1960. Meanwhile, plans had been put in motion to rebuild CN7 for a further attempt. His confidence was severely shaken, he was suffering mild panic attacks, and for some time he doubted whether he would ever return to record breaking. As part of his recuperation he learned to fly light aircraft and this boost to his confidence was an important factor in his recovery. By 1961 he was on the road to recovery and planning the rebuild of CN7.  Lake Eyre, 1963  The rebuilt car was completed, with modifications including differential locks and a large vertical stabilising fin, in 1962. After initial trials at Goodwood and further modifications to the very strong fibreglass cockpit canopy, CN7 was shipped this time to Australia for a new attempt at Lake Eyre in 1963. The Lake Eyre location was chosen as it offered of dried salt lake, where rain had not fallen in the previous 20 years, and the surface of the long track was as hard as concrete. As Campbell arrived in late March, with a view to a May attempt, the first light rain fell. Campbell and Bluebird were running by early May but once again more rain fell, and low-speed test runs could not progress into the higher speed ranges. By late May, the rain became torrential, and the lake was flooded. Campbell had to move the CN7 off the lake in the middle of the night to save the car from being submerged by the rising flood waters. The 1963 attempt was over. Campbell received very bad press following the failure to set a new record, but the weather conditions had made an attempt out of the question. BP pulled out as a sponsor at the end of the year.  Lake Eyre, 1964  Campbell and his team returned to Lake Eyre in 1964, with sponsorship from Australian oil company Ampol, but the salt surface never returned to the promise it had held in 1962 and Campbell had to battle with CN7 to reach record speeds (over ). After more light rain in June, the lake finally began to dry enough for an attempt to be made. On 17 July 1964, Campbell set a record of for a four-wheeled vehicle (Class A). Campbell was disappointed with the record speed as the vehicle had been designed for . CN7 covered the final third of the measured mile at an average of , peaking as it left the measured mile at over . Had the salt surface been hard and dry, and the full 15-mile length originally envisaged, there can be no doubt that CN7 would have set a record well in excess of and perhaps close to her design maximum of , a speed that no other wheel driven car has approached. Campbell commissioned the author John Pearson to chronicle this attempt, with the resultant book Bluebird and the Dead Lake, published by Collins in 1965.  After the record  To celebrate the record, Campbell drove CN7 through the streets of the South Australian capital, Adelaide, to a presentation at city hall before a crowd of in excess of 200,000 people. CN7 was then displayed widely in Australia and the UK after her return in November 1964. In June 1966, CN7 was demonstrated at RAF Debden in Essex, with a stand in driver, Peter Bolton. He crashed the car during a medium speed run, causing damage to her bodywork and front suspension. The car was patched up and Campbell ran her at a much lower speed than he intended. Campbell continued with his plans for the rocket-powered car Bluebird Mach 1.1 with a view to raising the LSR towards Mach 1. In January 1967, he was killed in his water-speed record jet hydroplane Bluebird K7. CN7 was eventually restored in 1969, but has never fully run again. In 1969, Campbell's widow, Tonia Bern-Campbell negotiated a deal with Lynn Garrison, President of Craig Breedlove and Associates, that would see Craig Breedlove run Bluebird on Bonneville's Salt Flats. This concept was cancelled when the parallel Spirit of America supersonic car project failed to find support. It became a permanent exhibit at the National Motor Museum, Beaulieu, England in 1972, and is still on display there.

Founded in 1914 by Ellis F. Lawrence, the college is located on the University of Oregon campus in Eugene, off the corner of 13th and University streets, and also has programs at the historic White Stag Block in Portland, Oregon. History At its inception in 1914, Ellis F. Lawrence envisioned that the School of Architecture and Allied Arts (now the College of Design) would incorporate architectural education with the arts as opposed to engineering, and became the first school to do so. The students would learn in an individual but collaborative environment instead of a fiercely competitive environment. When Walter R. B. Willcox became the head of the architecture curriculum in 1922, the underlying idea became that architecture and the arts would reflect societal influences, which had remained alive through the decades. After World War II, student enrollment in the school ballooned and separate departments for each curricular subject were created. In the Spring of 2017 it was announced that the school would rename itself the College of Design. Programs The college is divided into three schools and one department: School of Architecture & Environment, School of Art + Design, School of Planning, Public Policy and Management, and the Department of the History of Art and Architecture. =School of Architecture & Environment= The architecture program was in place since the inception of the school, though it didn‚Äôt become a department of the school until 1964. Just five years after its founding, in 1919, the school gained an early form of accreditation through the Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture. Only twelve schools out of forty schools that applied obtained accreditation that year. Undergraduate and graduate degrees are accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board and had been the only school in the state of Oregon to be accredited until Portland State University earned its accreditation in 2013. The landscape architecture program was first founded in Oregon Agricultural College, now known as Oregon State University in 1928. The program was moved to the University of Oregon in 1932, where it was expanded into a five-year program. The masters program was established a year later. =School of Art + Design= The School of Art + Design offers an array of fine arts including various digital media, ceramics, fibers, metals and jewelry, photography, painting, and sculpture. Students‚Äô work is periodically displayed in the LaVerne Krause Gallery in Lawrence Hall. The product design program began in the fall of 2008, from a partnership between the school‚Äôs department of art and the interior architecture program. The program, sparked by a $1.5 million donation from Columbia Sportswear CEO Tim Boyle, works with firms such as Ziba Design, Nike, Intel, and Sandstrom Design. The department offers a four-year BFA degree in product design as well as a master of science in Sports Product Design in Portland. =School of Planning, Public Policy and Management= The School of Planning, Public Policy and Management offers degrees in community and regional planning, public administration, and nonprofit management. Facilities The college is primarily housed in Lawrence Hall at the University of Oregon campus, which provides lecture halls, classrooms, studios, the Design Library, a materials resource library, and a computer lab with plotting services. The college also occupies the University's facility in the White Stag Block in Portland, with classes in urban architecture, historic preservation, product design, and sports product design. The LaVerne Krause Gallery in Lawrence Hall displays selected student work. Rankings The journal DesignIntelligence, in its 2010 rankings of architecture schools, ranked the University of Oregon's undergraduate architecture program number 7 overall in the nation. It also ranked first in the country in the area of \\"Sustainable Design Practice and Principles,\\" and number 5 for \\"Analysis and Planning.\\" This was an 11-spot improvement from the 2009 rankings where the architecture program was also ranked first place, tying with University of California at Berkeley, in the category of skills assessment for sustainable design concepts and principles.http://pmr.uoregon.edu/current-uo- news/archive/2009/january/uo-architecture-programs-score-high-in-national- ranking/ In 2007, the landscape architecture program was ranked first in the nation in sustainable design, while the architecture and interior architecture programs were ranked second in sustainable design. Several programs have historically been ranked highly in various publications over the years. US News & World Report ranked the graduate architecture program at number 15 in their 1998 edition of ‚Äò‚ÄôBest Graduate Schools‚Äô‚Äô. The journal DesignIntelligence annually ranks architecture programs in the United States in its issue \\"America's Best Architecture & Design Schools\\" and the undergraduate architecture program has consistently ranked within the top 15 and as high as 11 between 2004 and 2008.The Top U.S. Architecture Schools The undergraduate and graduate interior architecture programs were ranked 10th and 6th, respectively. The undergraduate and graduate landscape architecture programs were tied at 15th and ranked 13th, respectively. In the more regionalized rankings, DesignIntelligence in 2007 had ranked the graduate architecture program at first in the western region, tied with Southern California Institute of Architecture.

Imaoka also used the pen name to write criticism and music. She was known for her record-breaking 130-volume Guin Saga series, which has been translated into English, German, French, Italian and Russian. Her style has been described as being part of the New Wave science fiction movement. Outside of her literary endeavors, she was a playwright, composer, and pianist who performed with her own jazz ensemble, the Azusa Nakajima Trio. Biography Kurimoto was born in Tokyo and studied literature at Waseda University, graduating in 1975. Still in her twenties, she won the Gunzo Prize for New Writers (Criticism), as Azusa Nakajima, in 1977, and the Edogawa Rampo Prize in 1978 for \\"Our Era\\". This spectacular introduction to the literary world drew a lot of attention, especially as she was the youngest ever winner of the Edogawa Rampo Prize. Her use of two pen names was also discussed, and shortly after she won the Rampo prize, Heibon Panchi magazine featured a conversation between the \\"two\\" writers. Kurimoto is known for having written nearly 400 books since she began her career. She wrote in several genres, including science fiction, fantasy, horror, mystery, yaoi and Japanese-style historical romance. Her writing shows the influence of Mori Mari, with a number of her works featuring homosexual love, and her 1979 novel, Mayonaka no Tenshi (ÁúüÂ§ú‰∏≠„ÅÆÂ§©‰Ωø; Midnight Angel) played an important part in the creation of the shonen-ai/yaoi genres, \\"pioneering interest\\" in them before they became widely popular. She has also supported yaoi in her work as Nakajima. She was also heavily involved with the first issue of the yaoi magazine June in 1978, contributing stories and criticism as Kaoru Kurimoto and Azusa Nakajima, as well as using a number of other pseudonyms. She died on May 26, 2009, aged 56, in a Tokyo hospital, from pancreatic cancer, which was diagnosed in 2007.

The film was originally to have been directed by John Huston and advertisements were taken out in Variety to promote this fact. Huston apparently did film some scenes but walked off the set after disagreements with the producers. Veteran director Rosenberg stepped in on the troubled production. The resulting movie received almost-unanimously poor reviews. Plot Phoenix Police Detective Charlie Congers is tasked to assist the FBI in bringing a gangster's girlfriend, Jackie Pruitt, back to the USA to testify. The FBI thinks she can give inside information to law enforcement that will put Joe Bomposa behind bars once and for all. It turns out that Pruitt doesn't know much of anything useful to the FBI. The trouble is, Bomposa wants her dead anyway, feeling betrayed, while Congers is falling in love with her. Bomposa has her shot while she embraces Congers before she leaves for the US under the protection of the FBI.

Reception Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film one-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote, \\"Love and Bullets is a hopelessly confused hodgepodge of chases, killings, enigmatic meetings and separations, and insufferably overacted scenes by Steiger alternating with alarmingly underacted scenes by Bronson ... It's all texture and no plot, which is fine for a travelog but not so hot for a thriller. There's so little dialog we begin to suspect that's deliberate: Has the wordage in this movie been kept to a minimum to make it easier to dub for the international market?\\" Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote, \\"The British- born Miss Ireland has no luck in affecting a hillbilly accent, and as a comic pretense she's simply not there. However, she and Mr. Bronson approach each other with an appealing ease, which would be more appealing if it were not the movie's only selling point. Mr. Bronson grows ever more coolly dependable with each new film, but 'Love and Bullets' is too clumsy to show him off to much advantage.\\"Maslin, Janet (14 September 1979). \\"Film: 'Love and Bullets' Stars Charles Bronson\\".

Fardoust remained a close confidant of the Crown Prince and years later served for ten years as deputy of SAVAK, running day-to-day affairs of the security and intelligence bureau, after heading the Special Intelligence Bureau of Iran - sometimes described as a sort of \\"SAVAK within SAVAK\\" for approximately 20 years. The Special Intelligence Bureau of Iran or, in Persian daftar-dar, allowed Fardoust to be the ultimate holder of raw intel and provider of reports to the Shah of Iran. Fardoust admits to have penned down all the reported data by SAVAK, Les Deuxiume Bureau of the Army, etc. using pencil when reports of intelligence came by highest members of the intelligence community. Using pencil enabled him to manipulate and change the reports as he wished per MI6 directions. Hence as a result Shah of Iran and other members of the Senate were misinformed about every bit of information till the last moment. Khomeini was the end result and answer to the communism which the British called an Islamic Green Belt starting from Pakistan all the way to Turkey.Abrahamian, Ervand, Tortured Confessions, (University of California Press, 1999), p. 159.  The KGB and Hossein Fardoust  When Mohammad Mosaddegh became prime minister (April 1951), Fardoust was one of the first to leave Iran under pressure from Mosaddegh. He went to Paris and began to study law. In Paris, Fardoust turned to an iranian carpet dealer named Saberi and asked him to lend money to finance his stay in France. Saberi was a connecting link for the iranians who ended up in France and generously helped them with money. Fardoust also borrowed money from Saberi and soon made friends with him. As it turned out later, Saberi worked for the soviet KGB. If believe the information that was distributed after the revolution and related to \\"the work of Fardoust for the KGB\\", then most likely it was Saberi who recruited him. Abbas Milani. Eminent Persians. Syracuse University Press, (2008), p. 442. After the overthrow of the Mosaddegh's government, Fardoust returned to Iran and again became the Shah's confidant. Prime minister Fazlollah Zahedi received a reliable report from the Iranian military intelligence that Fardoust worked for foreign intelligence services. General Zahedi presented a report to the Shah, who reacted extremely negatively to the report and complained about the government, which was dismissive of his personal friend.Ibid. The post of director of ¬´Imperial Inspectorate Organization¬ª, allowed Fardoust to become the ultimate holder of raw intelligence information, which was then presented to the Shah. According to Fardoust, he recorded all the intelligence obtained from the sources of SAVAK, military intelligence, etc., with a pencil, which allowed him to manipulate and modify the reports at his discretion in accordance with the instructions of the British MI-6. Consequently, as a result, until the last, Shah and other members of the Senate were misinformed about each part of the information received. Abrahamian, Ervand. \\"Tortured Confessions\\", (University of California Press, 1999), p. 159. According to the memoirs of the Shah‚Äôs sister, Princess Ashraf Pahlavi was convinced that Fardust was hiding vital information from the Shah, and that Fardoust even actively negotiated with Khomeini. Simin Redjali. \\"A Symphony of Life\\". Xlibris Corporation, (2013), p. 289.  Iranian revolution and Fardoust's position  Until the mid-1970s, Fardoust met with the Shah daily to personally inform him of the key details of intelligence reports. It is still unclear why the Shah did not want to meet in person with Fardoust two or three years before his fall. Fardoust retained his post, but now was forced to submit written reports to the Shah daily. The personal friendship that connected the Shah and Hossein Fardoust over the years has ended. Some of the most important Iranian army generals worked for some time under the leadership of Hossein Fardoust at \\"Imperial Inspectorate Organization\\", including General Abbas Gharabaghi, who in January 1979 was appointed shah by the chief of staff of the Iranian armed forces, when the monarch was forced leave Iran (January 16), and which contributed to the success of the revolution with its decision not to support the government approved by the Shah, prime minister Shapour Bakhtiar. Fardoust obviously used the last few years of his tenure to establish close ties with those generals of the Iranian armed forces who criticized the Shah and played a decisive role in the first stage of the Islamic revolution in the decomposition of the old power structures of the monarchy. The very fact that General Hossein Fardoust and General Abbas Gharabaghi survived the Islamic Revolution intact, despite the fact that they worked with the Shah for many years, is considered by many researchers as clear evidence of their involvement in the Islamic Revolution. Abbas Milani. Eminent Persians. Syracuse University Press, (2008), p. 442. When protests against the Shah intensified in 1978, officers and politicians asked Fardoust to finally do something to stop Khomeini, to which Fardoust said: ‚ÄúIt is completely useless to do anything. The Shah has long broken the law. It is time for him to paid the price for it\\".Ibid., p. 444. Some authors note that Fardoust played an important role in the return of Ayatollah Khomeini from emigration and in driving the Shah‚Äôs military and security personnel to the side of the revolutionaries.

Despite the high and important posts that he held under the shah‚Äôs regime, and his close relations personally with the shah, Fardoust remained in Iran after the overthrow of the monarchy. He was arrested, was in prison for some time, but, to everyone's surprise, he was not sentenced to death. According to the most common information, Fardoust actively cooperated with the Islamic regime,Le Monde (May 20, 1987): \\"IRAN: d√©c√®s du g√©n√©ral Fardoust, ancien chef adjoint de la SAVAK\\". founded and until 1985 was the head of SAVAMA, the new security organization and secret police, which became the successor of SAVAK. \\"Khomeini Is Reported to Have a SAVAK of His Own\\"; The Washington Post, 7 June 1980, ; A1, Michael Getler.

Last years  In April 1987, Fardoust appeared in public for the first time in a television \\"interview\\" with Islamic authorities. He described and denounced the life of the Shah, his court, and the corruption and dependency of the government he had served in. In the interview he claimed 10,000 full-time investigators were needed by the Special Intelligence Bureau just to keep track of the money-grabbers and plunderers in the Shah's elite. \`There was no way of keeping track of lesser crooks\`. The marriage and then the divorce of the Shah to Princess Fawzieh of Egypt was arranged by the British.Abrahamian, Tortured Confessions, (1999), pp. 159‚Äì160. According to Ervand Abrahamian, the television interview, as with all other television interviews of prisoners in the Islamic Republic, should be taken with a grain of salt. Three weeks after the interview appeared, the government announced that Fardoust had died from \`old age and other natural causes.Abrahamian, Tortured Confessions, (1999), p. 159. Posthumously memoirs Three years after his death a newspaper run by the government, Kayhan-e Hava'i, ran a series of articles in both Persian and English of what were purported to be Fardoust's more detailed memoirs. The book, entitled Khaterat-e Arteshbod-e Baznesheshteh Hossein Fardoust (The Memoirs of Retired General Hossein Fardoust), expanded on the themes of corruption and conspiracy in the Shah's court and government. The book alleges that foreign imperial powers, especially Britain, dominated Iran and nourished the Freemasons the Bah√°'√≠s and the Jews‚Äîwhich the book claims most Iranian politicians belonged to the Freemasons and that the Jews, controlled \\"not only Israel but also the United States.\\" Another surprising fact Fardoust‚Äîor the book credited to him‚Äîclaimed to reveal was that celebrated nationalist Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadeq was not a mortal enemy of the British, but had \\"always favored\\" them, and his campaign to nationalize the British Anglo- Iranian Oil Company, today known as BP, had been inspired by \`the British themselves.Abrahamian, Tortured Confessions, (1999), pp. 160‚Äì161.

History Clothing store entrepreneur E.L. Schottenstein adapted his successful apparel store to sell furniture in the early 1900s after the post- World War II baby boom accelerated demand for furniture. Recognizing the expanding opportunity, Schottenstein created a separate business dedicated to furniture sales, later renaming it Value City Furniture. = Alvin Schottenstein and Value City Furniture = In 1948, E.L. Schottenstein‚Äôs son, Alvin, took over the furniture portion of the family company and Value City Furniture. With Alvin Schottenstein at the helm, Value City Furniture saw great prosperity and amazing growth throughout the years. He believed that the best way to deliver quality furniture at a great value to customers was to buy the factories that built the furniture, which in turn, would cut out middleman cost. For almost 30 years, Alvin helped to grow a furniture business that had started in the basement of his father‚Äôs department store. It was now time for Jerome Schottenstein to pass this tradition to his son, Jay. = Jay Schottenstein and American Signature, Inc. = In 1976, Jay Schottenstein joined Value City Furniture and in 1984, he was named company president. In 1995, the proprietary furniture brand American Signature was formed. This exclusive line was sold in Value City Furniture stores. With the addition of the proprietary American Signature brand, and the overall expansion of Value City Furniture, Jay knew it was time to completely break away from the department stores. In 2002, American Signature, Inc. was formed, and eventually the company completely separated from Schottenstein Stores Corporation. American Signature, Inc. became the parent company of the retail brand Value City Furniture and the manufacturer brand, American Signature. But the biggest change came in 2003, when the company announced the launch of the American Signature Furniture retail brand, with their first store opening in Nashville, Tennessee.

The organization designs, administers and manages corporate and foundation scholarship programs; it also operates Dollars for Scholars, a coalition of local scholarship organizations in communities across the United States. Scholarship America also administers several special scholarship initiatives, including the Dreamkeepers Emergency Financial Aid program for community college students, and the Families of Freedom Scholarship Fund, which has to date distributed more than $100 million to dependents of those killed or disabled during the September 11, 2001 attacks, and will provide financial assistance to dependents in need through the 2030 academic year. Dollars for Scholars was founded in 1958 by Dr. Irving Fradkin, an optometrist in Fall River, Massachusetts, and Scholarship America was officially chartered under the name \\"Citizens' Scholarship Foundation of America\\" on May 15, 1961. Scholarship America's President and CEO is Robert C. Ballard. In fiscal year 2016, Scholarship America distributed more than $225 million to more than 100,000 American and international students through its programs. In 2012, Forbes ranked Scholarship America as the 83rd largest U.S. charity (out of 100) with total revenues of $155 million. Timeline Dollars for Scholars, the initial program that would become Scholarship America, was originally conceived by Fradkin during a campaign for the Fall River school board in 1957, as a way of ensuring that community members could contribute to a citywide scholarship fund through small donations. Fradkin lost the election, but began fundraising for Dollars for Scholars, starting the Fall River chapter in 1958. Dollars for Scholars incorporated as a 501(c)(3) organization in May 1961, under the name of Citizens' Scholarship Foundation of America (CSFA). During its early years, CSFA's headquarters moved from Fall River to Boston; to Concord, NH; and opened its first regional office in St. Peter, MN, in 1976, thanks to a grant from the Bush Foundation. Also in 1976, CSFA expanded from its community-based Dollars for Scholars roots with the establishment of Scholarship Management Services (SMS), a branch of the organization designed to manage corporate scholarships. The Toro company of Minnesota became SMS's first client. In 1984, the organization's board voted to move CSFA's headquarters to St. Peter, MN, where they remain today. That year, CSFA reached the $5 million mark in terms of scholarship funds distributed. Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, the organization grew rapidly and launched its Collegiate Partner initiative (in which colleges agreed to maximize CSFA-related aid to students on their campuses) and ScholarShop program (a junior high and high school college- readiness curriculum.) In September 2001, CSFA created the Families of Freedom Scholarship Fund after the attacks on New York City and Washington, D.C. With President Bill Clinton and Senator Bob Dole as co-chairs of the fundraising campaign, the Families of Freedom Scholarship Fund raised more than $100 million, which it continues to distribute to the dependents of those killed or permanently disabled in the attacks, rescue and cleanup efforts. On January 1, 2003, CSFA changed its name to Scholarship America; in the spring of that year, the organization surpassed the $1 billion mark in terms of funds distributed to students. On December 4, 2014, Scholarship America announced a commitment to increase the number of colleges and universities with which it partners to support low- to moderate-income students and communities of greatest need. The new focus was announced alongside Scholarship America's attendance at the second White House College Opportunity Day of Action, where organizations announced over 600 new actions to help more students prepare for and graduate from college. As of the end of fiscal year 2016, Scholarship America had distributed more than $3.7 billion to 2.3 million students across the country. Programs Scholarship America designs, manages and administers scholarship, tuition assistance, loan management and other education programs for corporations, foundations and individuals. In addition to this core business, the organization identifies the following as core programs and initiatives: *Dollars for Scholars, Scholarship America's first program, is a nationwide coalition of local, community-based scholarship organizations. *Scholarship America's Dreamkeepers program helps students stay in college when faced with an unforeseen financial emergency. *The Families of Freedom Scholarship Fund, which is managed by Scholarship America, provides education assistance for postsecondary study to financially needy dependents of those killed or permanently disabled as a result of the September 11, 2001 attacks. *Collegiate Partners are postsecondary institutions that ensure that scholarships awarded through Scholarship America programs help meet students' unmet financial needs. Some Collegiate Partners agree to match scholarships from Scholarship America programs, up to a specific dollar amount. *The Scholarship America Dream Award, the organization's newest scholarship program, is a multi-year, performance-based scholarship fund targeted toward postsecondary completion. The scholarship program received its initial funding from proceeds from Katie Couric's book, The Best Advice I Ever Got: Lessons from Extraordinary Lives. Recognition Scholarship America has been highly rated by Charity Navigator for more than a decade. The Chronicle of Philanthropy recognizes Scholarship America as one of America's largest nonprofits as part of its Philanthropy 400. In 2014, Scholarship America ranked #158 on the list. As of 2013, the Minneapolis / St. Paul Business Journal recognizes Scholarship America as Minnesota's second-largest charity. Katie Couric, a supporter of Scholarship America, invited the organization to appear on her talk show, Katie, on two occasions: to celebrate its founder, Dr. Fradkin, and to announce the first class of Dream Award recipients. In June 2014, Senior Vice President of Education Programs and Policy, Max Espinoza, represented Scholarship America at the White House. The visits included meeting President Barack Obama, as he signed an executive order to aid student loan debtors, and a roundtable discussion on college affordability with Second Lady Dr. Jill Biden and Secretary of State Arne Duncan.

Kronprinz was laid down in 1866 at the Samuda Brothers shipyard at Cubitt Town in London. She was launched in May 1867 and commissioned into the Prussian Navy that September. The ship was the fourth ironclad ordered by the Prussian Navy, after , , and , though she entered service before Friedrich Carl. Kronprinz was built as an armored frigate, armed with a main battery of sixteen 21 cm (8.3 in) guns; several smaller guns were added later in her career. Kronprinz saw limited duty during the Franco- Prussian War of 1870‚Äì1871. Engine troubles aboard the ship, along with the two other armored frigates in her squadron, prevented operations against the French blockade. Only two sorties in which Kronprinz participated were conducted, both of which did not result in combat. The ship served in the subsequent Imperial Navy until she was converted into a training ship for boiler room personnel in 1901. The ship was ultimately broken up for scrap in 1921.  Design  Following the acquisition of the small ironclad warships and , which were only usable in coastal areas, the Prussian Navy sought to acquire armored vessels capable of operations on the high seas. The purpose of the new ships would be primarily directed against Prussia's primary naval rival, Denmark, which in the recent Second Schleswig War had imposed a blockade of German ports that Prussia had not been able to break. Ironclads were at that time a recent development and the only option for sea-going warships was the armored frigate, modeled on traditional sailing ships with a battery on the broadside. The navy requested approval from the Landtag in 1865 for an expanded budget to acquire the needed vessels, but the parliament refused, prompting King Wilhelm I to circumvent the legislature with a decree on 4 July authorizing the purchase of two armored frigates. At that time, Britain and France had the shipbuilders most experienced with the type, so the navy decided to order one vessel from each country. The contract for Kronprinz was placed on 13 January 1866, four days after that for , from Britain and France respectively. The British-built Kronprinz was modeled on the and es. = General characteristics and propulsion = Kronprinz was long at the waterline and long overall. She had a beam of and a draft of forward and aft. The ship was designed to displace at a normal loading, and up to with a combat load. The ship's hull was constructed with transverse and longitudinal iron frames. It contained nine watertight compartments and a double bottom that ran for 43 percent of the length of the vessel. The ship was an excellent sea boat; the ship was responsive to commands from the helm but had a large turning radius. The ship's crew numbered 33 officers and 508 enlisted men. Kronprinz carried a number of smaller boats, including a large tender, two launches, a pinnace, two cutters, two yawls, and one dinghy. The ship's propulsion system was built by John Penn and Sons of Greenwich, England. A horizontal two-cylinder single expansion steam engine powered the ship. It drove a two-bladed screw in diameter. Eight trunk boilers, with four fireboxes in each, were divided into two boiler rooms. The boilers supplied steam to the engine at . The propulsion system was rated at and a top speed of , though on trials Kronprinz managed to make and . The ship carried up to of coal, which enabled a maximum range of at a cruising speed of and a range of at 14 knots. A barque rig with a surface area of 1,980 square meters supplemented the steam engine. Steering was controlled with a single rudder. = Armament and armor = As built, Kronprinz was equipped with thirty-two rifled 72-pounder cannon. After her delivery to Germany, these guns were replaced with a pair of L/22 guns and fourteen 21 cm L/19 guns. The L/22 gun could depress to ‚àí5 degrees and elevate to 13 degrees, which provided a range of . The shorter barreled L/19 guns had a wider range of elevation, from ‚àí8 to 14.5 degrees, but the shorter barrel imposed a lower muzzle velocity, which correspondingly reduced the range of the gun to . The two types of gun fired the same shell, of which the total supply numbered 1,656 rounds of ammunition. The fourteen L/19 guns were placed in a central battery amidships, seven on either broadside. The L/22 weapons were placed on either end of the ship as chase guns. Later in her career, six Hotchkiss revolver cannon in individual mounts were installed, along with five torpedo tubes. Two of the tubes were placed in the bow, two on the ship's sides, and one in the stern on the port side. All were placed above water, and were supplied with 12 torpedoes. Kronprinzs armor consisted of wrought iron backed with heavy teak planking. The iron component of the waterline armored belt ranged in thickness from in the stern to amidships and toward the bow. The entire belt was backed with of teak. The central battery was protected by of sloped iron plating on 254 mm of timber. The battery's roof was protected by iron plating.  Service history  Kronprinz after her launching in 1867 Kronprinz was laid down in 1866 at the Samuda Brothers shipyard in London. The British naval architect Edward Reed designed the ship, and resulted in a vessel similar to the contemporary, French-built Prussian ironclad Friedrich Carl. The ship was launched on 6 May 1867 and commissioned into the Prussian Navy four months later on 19 September. Crews for Friedrich Carl and Kronprinz were carried to the ships by the screw frigate and the screw corvette . On the voyage from England to Prussia, the ship lost her main mast in a storm. The ship immediately went into dock for refitting upon arrival in Kiel on 28 October; the mast was repaired and the ship's armament was converted from the initial arrangement. As with Friedrich Carl, completion of the ship was delayed significantly by problems with the new Prussian guns. The weapons originally intended for the ships used Kreiner breech blocks that had proved to be prone to failure during a series of tests in 1867‚Äì1868. Krupp-designed guns were substituted, delaying her recommissioning until 11 May 1869. =Franco-Prussian War= Kronprinz joined Friedrich Carl and the new armored frigate , the latter serving as the fleet flagship, for training exercises in August and September. In May 1870, the three ships were joined by Prinz Adalbert for a visit to Britain, though Friedrich Carl was damaged after running aground in the Great Belt. Kronprinz, K√∂nig Wilhelm, and Prinz Adalbert continued on to Plymouth while Friedrich Carl returned to Kiel for repairs. The latter vessel quickly rejoined the ships there and on 1 July they departed for a training cruise to Fayal in the Azores, Portugal. But as tensions with France over the Hohenzollern candidacy for the vacant Spanish throne. While they cruised east through the English Channel, they learned of the increasing likelihood of war, and the Prussians detached Prinz Adalbert to Dartmouth to be kept informed of events. The rest of the squadron joined her there on 13 July, and as war seemed to be imminent, the Prussians ended the cruise and returned to home. Kronprinz had to take Prinz Adalbert under tow for the voyage due to the latter's slow speed. Kronprinz on maneuvers with and The ships arrived back in Wilhelmshaven on 16 July, three days before France declared war on Prussia over the Ems Dispatch, initiating the Franco-Prussian War. The greatly numerically inferior Prussian Navy assumed a defensive posture against a naval blockade imposed by the French Navy. Kronprinz, Friedrich Carl, and K√∂nig Wilhelm were concentrated in the North Sea at the port of Wilhelmshaven, with a view toward breaking the French blockade of the port. They were subsequently joined there by the turret ship Arminius, which had been stationed in Kiel. For the duration of the conflict, Kronprinz was commanded by Captain Reinhold von Werner. Despite the great French naval superiority, the French had conducted insufficient pre-war planning for an assault on the Prussian naval installations, and concluded that it would only be possible with Danish assistance, which was not forthcoming. The four ships, under the command of Vizeadmiral (Vice Admiral) Eduard von Jachmann, made an offensive sortie in early August 1870 out to the Dogger Bank, though they encountered no French warships. Kronprinz and the other two broadside ironclads thereafter suffered from chronic engine trouble, which left Arminius alone to conduct operations. Kronprinz, Friedrich Carl, and K√∂nig Wilhelm stood off the island of Wangerooge for the majority of the conflict, while Arminius was stationed in the mouth of the Elbe river. On 11 September, the three broadside ironclads were again ready for action; they joined Arminius for another major operation into the North Sea. It too did not encounter French opposition, as the French Navy had by this time returned to France. The Prussians planned to send Kronprinz, which had been overhauled over the winter of 1870‚Äì1871, on a raid of the port of Cherbourg in February, but the French signed the armistice that ended the war on 28 January. =Later career= Kronprinz in Kiel in 1892 Through the 1870s, the German armored fleet typically saw active service during the summer months. Over the winter, most of the vessels were placed in reserve with one or two kept in a state of reduced commission as guard ships. Kronprinz towed a floating dry dock from Swinem√ºnde to Kiel in June 1871, with assistance from the gunboat and the paddle steamer . At the same time, the screw corvette was in Brazil while on an overseas cruise; some of her crew had been arrested following a fistfight in the country. The Germans threatened to deploy Kronprinz, Friedrich Carl, three more corvettes, and two gunboats, which convinced the Brazilian government to release the crewmen. For 1875's summer training cruise, Kronprinz and K√∂nig Wilhelm were joined by the recently built ironclads and , though the ships remained in German waters. The next year, the ironclad squadron‚ÄîKronprinz, Friedrich Carl, Kaiser, and the new ‚Äîwere sent to the Mediterranean Sea in response to the murder of the German consul in Salonika in the Ottoman Empire. The German ships were joined by French, Russian, Italian, and Austro-Hungarian warships in an international demonstration condemning the murder. The Germans returned home in August and, after arriving in September, were laid up for the winter. Kronprinz remained laid up for the 1878 training cruise that saw the loss of the brand-new ironclad in an accidental collision with Kaiser. She returned to service the following year when the squadron was reactivated in May; Friedrich Carl served as the flagship and the squadron also included the ironclads and . The ships visited Norway on the cruise. Kronprinz was again left in reserve for 1880, but she was recommissioned in 1881 to replace the new armored corvette , which was suffering from unreliable engines. Once again, the ships remained in German waters. The next two years followed the same pattern. Engine problems plagued the ship throughout her career; Kronprinzs engines broke down during the fleet maneuvers in May 1883. Two of the three other armored frigates also broke down, which forced the cancellation of the maneuvers. Later that year, the training cycle concluded with a large-scale simulated attack on Kiel, with Kronprinz and the other ironclads acting as an \\"eastern\\" opponent. The defenders, led by the corvettes and , were judged to have been victorious. The armored fleet operated entirely under steam power that year, the first time it did so. Kronprinz was docked for modernization in late 1883; she received new boilers and the six Hotchkiss revolver cannon and six torpedo tubes were installed. By 1884, the four s had entered service, and they formed the training squadron that year. Kronprinz had anti-torpedo nets installed in 1885; these were later removed in 1897. In 1887, she was present for the ceremonies marking the beginning of construction of the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal, which was to link the Kiel with the North Sea. The ship served on active duty with the fleet until 22 August 1901, when she was stricken from the naval register. She was reconstructed at the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel that year. The propulsion system was overhauled and the eight J Penn & Sons boilers were removed. Two D√ºrr and two Thornycroft boilers were installed in their place. Her barque rig was cut down to . After emerging from the reconstruction, Kronprinz served as a training ship for engine-room personnel, based in Kiel. The ship was ultimately sold to Bonn, a German ship-breaking firm, on 3 October 1921 for 5,000,000 marks. Kronprinz was broken up for scrap in Rendsburg-Audorf later that year.

Born in Elyria, Ohio, Bryan was the second son of Bart Bryan and Caroline Ebert Bryan. After serving overseas in World War I, he returned to New York City to take a job with a cotton firm. In 1923 he became the youngest member of the New York Cotton Exchange. Bryan married Kathleen M. Price of Greensboro, North Carolina, on November 19. 1927. In 1931, the couple moved to Greensboro, where Bryan accepted a job offer from Julian Price, his wife's father and founder of the Jefferson Standard Life Insurance Company. Bryan joined the staff of the Jefferson Standard Life Insurance Company and moved up through the ranks. In 1934 he became the president of a subsidiary company which purchased WBIG, then Greensboro's only radio station, and saved it from being taken off the air. The company expanded its broadcasting division in 1945 with it purchased WBT in Charlotte. Four years later, WBTV became the first television station to air in North and South Carolina. Bryan went on to serve in various capacities with several large corporations. In addition to being senior vice president of Jefferson Standard Life Insurance Company and chairman of the board of Pilot Life Insurance Company, he served as a member of the board of the parent corporation, Jefferson-Pilot, until 1993 when he was made honorary and lifetime member of the board. Bryan also served on the boards of NCNB, Atlantic and Yadkin Railroad, and several personal companies. He was one of the original six members of the North Carolina Business Hall of Fame. Kathleen died in 1984 after a long battle with Alzheimer's Disease. Frustrated by the lack of knowledge on the disease in the medical community, Bryan backed an experimental procedure at Duke University involving rapid autopsies of victims of Alzheimer's. The initial success of the program prompted him to donate ten million dollars for Alzheimer's research, putting Duke University Medical Center at the forefront of the battle against the disease. Bryan was also involved in civic organizations such as the Rotary Club, Masons, Shriners, and other community groups. He served on several governmental committees, including the Governor's Committee on Low Income Housing and the U.S. State Department's Fine Arts Committee. In 1961, Governor Luther Hodges named Bryan Chairman of the North Carolina State Board of Elections. In 1986, Bryan received the North Carolina Award in Public Service. The Bryans' long standing record of philanthropy has received national recognition. In 1955, the Bryan Family Foundation was established as a vehicle for their benevolence. Education was always a priority. The University of North Carolina at Greensboro, North Carolina School of Science and Math, Duke University, Greensboro College, North Carolina A&T; State University, Guilford College, Bennett College, Belmont Abbey, Converse College, Elon University and many more institutions have benefited from the generosity of Mr. and Mrs. Bryan. UNCG's School of Business and Economics was named in honor of Joseph M. Bryan. Bryan was a sports enthusiast known for his love of golf. He was an early member of the Augusta National Golf Club. The Greensboro Jaycees approached him in 1937 to assist in guaranteeing the purse of the first Greater Greensboro Open PGA Tour tournament, which took place in 1938. He later became Honorary General Chairman for the golf tournament, now known as the Wyndham Championship. In 1971, the City of Greensboro named Bryan Park, a new municipal golf complex, in honor of Mr. and Mrs. Bryan. Fishing and shooting were also among Bryan's favorite pastimes. He particularly liked to salmon fish in Canada and was an award-winning marlin fisherman. Whether in the United States or in Europe, he could be found among the world's elite shooters. In the last year of his life, including the day he was admitted to the hospital, Bryan made daily visits to his office in the Jefferson Standard Building. He died in Greensboro on April 26, 1995. Bryan Boulevard, a freeway- grade arterial road in Greensboro, is named for him. External links *Finding Aid for the Joseph M.

Among them were the manuscripts of four plays, two of them previously unknown. Upon the release of the manuscripts, such respected literary figures as James Boswell (biographer of Samuel Johnson) and poet laureate Henry James Pye pronounced them genuine, as did various antiquarian experts. Richard Brinsley Sheridan, the leading theatre manager of his day, agreed to present one of the newly discovered plays with John Philip Kemble in the starring role. Excitement over the biographical and literary significance of the find turned to acrimony, however, when it was charged that the documents were forgeries. Edmond Malone, widely regarded as the greatest Shakespeare scholar of his time, conclusively showed that the language, orthography, and handwriting were not those of the times and persons to which they were credited. William Henry Ireland, the supposed discoverer, then confessed to the fraud. Background Although Shakespeare's works were readily available in versions both for the learned and for the general public, no satisfactory biography could be constructed. In spite of an intense search by would-be Shakespeare biographers from Nicholas Rowe to Edmond Malone, only scraps and legends turned up. There was an intense hope and expectation that some documents would surface to fill the gap. Samuel Ireland was an eager collector of antique relics‚Äîhis collection included a piece of Charles II's cloak, Oliver Cromwell's leather jacket, and Joseph Addison's fruit knifeBernard Grebanier, The Great Shakespeare Hoax, pp. 42‚Äì43.‚Äîas well as a Shakespeare enthusiast. While gathering material for a forthcoming book, Picturesque Tours of the Upper, or Warwickshire Avon, he passed through Stratford on Avon, Shakespeare's birthplace, by then already capitalising on this claim to fame, and made inquiries about the life of the dramatist. Although he had the satisfaction of being the first to introduce Shakespeare's crabtree and Anne Hathaway's cottage to the general public, Shakespeare documents eluded him.Schoenbaum, Shakespeare's Lives, pp. 191‚Äì192. His son William Henry Ireland had a fascination with forgery. He was heavily influenced by the novel Love and Madness by Herbert Croft which contained lengthy passages on the forger Thomas Chatterton. William witnessed his father's frustration first-hand. One moment, in particular, struck him forcibly. Knowing that the furniture and papers from New Place, Shakespeare's last residence, had been moved to Clopton house when New Place was demolished, Samuel Ireland reasoned that Shakespearean manuscripts might well be found there.Samuel Ireland, Picturesque Views on the Upper, or Warwickshire, Avon (London 1796), p. 204; William Henry says that old residents told them papers had been moved there at the time of the Stratford fire. Upon visiting however, he was informed by the current tenant that all the old papers‚Äîmany of them Shakespeare's‚Äîhad recently been burned. Samuel Ireland's distress at this news made a strong impression on the young man‚Äîeven though it later turned out that this story was a nothing more than a joke at Ireland's expense.William Henry Ireland related this story in the Authentic Account (pp. 5‚Äì6), the Confessions (pp. 30‚Äì33), and the unpublished Full and Explanatory Account (according to Schoenbaum, p. 192). Edmond Malone investigated the incident, writing to the owner about the propriety of a tenant destroying his landlord's papers; the tenant denied the incident and admitted it was a practical joke. Mair, pp. 19‚Äì20, and Schoenbaum, p. 193, have brief accounts of the subsequent investigation of the incident. According to the younger Ireland's confessions, it was to please his father that he embarked on the career of literary forgery that would ultimately ruin them both.Confessions, p. 302. First documents From a chance acquaintance met at a book-binder's the young man learned of a technique for simulating the appearance of ancient writing by using a special ink and then heating the paper.William Henry Ireland, Authentic Account, p. 4. After a trial run creating a couple of relatively insignificant documents, he set out to devise something with Shakespeare's signature. His work at a legal firm gave him access to Elizabethan and Jacobean parchment deeds, so in December 1794 he cut a piece of parchment from one of them, used his special ink to write with and heated it over a candle. The result was a mortgage deed between Shakespeare and his fellow-actor John Heminges on one side, and Michael Fraser and his wife on the other. The text and signature he copied from the facsimile of the genuine 1612 mortgage deed printed in Malone's edition of Shakespeare.Schoenbaum, p. 197; in his published accounts William Henry Ireland claims to have used the Johnson-Steevens edition, but the Blackfriars mortgage deed he used as a basis for the forgery did not appear there, and was first printed in Malone's edition. In his unpublished accounts he admitted to using Malone's edition. Ripping a seal from another early deed, young Ireland attached it to this concoction and presented the result to his father on 16 December. Samuel Ireland accepted it as authentic, and the next day took it to the Heralds' Office, which approved it as genuine.Mair, pp. 27‚Äì29. Asked where he had turned up this deed, William Henry replied that he had found it in an old trunk belonging to a chance acquaintance who did not wish to have his name revealed. Mr. H., as he called him, had freely given him this deed. The young discoverer suggested that there might well be more documents where this had come from,Jeffrey Kahan, p. 57, based on Samuel Ireland's unpublished records; William Henry later revised this in his Confessions (p. 55) to claim that he never would have continued had not others suggested to him to possibility of finding more documents. and quickly followed this up with a promissory note from Shakespeare to Heminges‚Äîthe only such note (had it been genuine) ever discovered from the period.Bernard Grebanier; The Great Shakespeare Forgery, pp. 81‚Äì82. Further forgeries With his next discovery William Henry moved from mere forgery to original art.Mair, The Fourth Forger, p. 31. Having learned‚Äîapparently from a chance remark by one of his father's friends rather than by research‚Äîthat Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton had been Shakespeare's patron, he decided to create correspondence between them.William Henry Ireland, Confessions, p. 78. \\"Doe notte esteeme me a sluggarde nor tardye for thus havyinge delayed to answerre or rather toe thank you for youre greate Bountye,\\" he has Shakespeare write sans punctuation. \\"[G]ratitude is alle I have toe utter and that is tooe greate ande tooe sublyme a feeling for poore mortalls toe expresse O my Lord itte is a Budde which Bllossommes Bllooms butte never dyes.\\" The Earl of Southampton replies in a similar vein, also sans punctuation, and with a similar spelling: ‚Äú‚Ä¶as I have beene thye Freynde soe will I continue aughte thatte I canne doe forre thee praye commande me ande you shalle fynde mee Yours Southampton‚Äù.Text from Samuel Ireland, Miscellaneous Papers and Legal Instruments under the Hand and Seal of William Shakspeare, 1796. To explain how both letters could end up together in the same collection William Henry added a note explaining that Shakespeare‚Äôs was a ‚ÄúCopye‚Äù of the letter he sent. Samuel Ireland and his friends admired the style of the letters but not the earl‚Äôs penmanship; William Henry, not knowing that handwriting of the earl was extant, had written Southampton‚Äôs reply with his left hand.Confessions, pp. 78‚Äì83. A flood of documents now followed, all coming from Mr. H‚Äôs ostensibly-miraculous chest. Shakespeare‚Äôs ‚ÄúProfession of Faith‚Äù proved he was a Protestant, a letter to fellow-actor Richard Cowley showed he was \\"a perfect good natured man\\",William Henry Ireland, Authentic Account, p. 15. and a letter from Queen Elizabeth made it clear that he was favoured by the most powerful person in the land. A sketch of himself that accompanied his letter to Cowley showed that he was a wretched draftsman with an impenetrable sense of humour. Described in the letter as a \\"whysycalle conceyte\\", it was (as Malone put it) \\"most truly whimsical, being a miserable drawing of our poet done by himself with a pen, from Martin Droeshout's print of him engraved seven years after his death‚Ä¶.\\"Edmond Malone, An Inquiry into the Authenticity of Certain Papers and Instruments Attributed to Shakespeare, p. 209. There were also theatrical receipts, contracts, a letter and poem to his future wife, \\"Anna Hatherrewaye\\", and even books from Shakespeare's library, complete with marginal annotations actually signed by the bard himself. Of most interest, however, were a manuscript of King Lear Shakespeare had prepared for the press, a few stray leaves of \\"Hamblette\\", and two previously unknown plays, Vortigern and Rowena and Henry II. Artifacts on display From the moment of discovery Samuel Ireland invited friends in to see his new possessions. On 20 December 1794 Sir Frederick Eden came to examine the seal on the Fraser lease. He announced that it represented a quintain, a device used in lance practice, and the conclusion was that Shakespeare had used it as a play on his own name.Samuel Schoenbaum, Shakespeare's Lives, p. 199. In February 1795 however he issued a general invitation to literary men to come to his house and examine them. The exhibition was a roaring success. Samuel Parr and Joseph Warton on hearing Samuel Ireland read the \\"Profession of Faith\\" proclaimed it superior to anything in the English liturgy. James Boswell got down on his knees to kiss the relics. Scottish antiquarian George Chalmers and educator Richard Valpy visited frequently, and editor James Boaden, author Herbert Croft, and poet-laureate Henry James Pye (among others) testified publicly to their belief in the authenticity of the papers.DNB, p. 33. One hitch developed when an alert visitor noted that a document supposedly written by the Earl of Leicester was dated 1590, whereas the nobleman had died in 1588.Kahan, Reforging Shakespeare, p. 86; Samuel Schoenbaum, Shakespeare's Lives, p. 206. When Samuel Ireland confronted his son with this information, William Henry wanted to burn the document, but his father demurred. He suggested that the document might have been misdated at some later time, and the two agreed to tear off the date.William Henry Ireland, A Full and Explanatory Account, MS, cited in Schoenbaum, op. cit. The item was displayed, and subsequently printed, in this mutilated form. At least two scholars, antiquary Joseph RitsonRitson to Paton, 21 July 1795 in The Letters of Joseph Ritson, volume 2, pp. 91‚Äì93. and classicist Richard Porson,Bernard Grebanier, The Great Shakespeare Forgery, p. 137. correctly recognised the documents as forgeries, and editor Henry Bate Dudley started lampooning the papers as early as 17 February 1795.Grebanier, p. 127, Schoenbaum, p. 212; Mair, p. 59. As Samuel Ireland did not invite the two greatest Shakespeare scholars of the day, Edmond Malone and George Steevens, to examine the manuscripts, suspicion was aroused. As one writer noted \\"The publick would certainly have been gratified to know, that these extraordinary MSS. had been deemed genuine by Dr. Farmer, Messrs. Stevens or Malone; whose literary characters might have served as letters of credence.\\"Gentleman's Magazine, March 1795, p. 210. Samuel Ireland later observed that he was \\"of a different sentiment with regard to the sanction, which his [Malone's] inspection would afford them.\\"Samuel Ireland, An Investigation of Mr. Malone's Claim to the Character of Scholar, or Critic, p. 3. He did however attempt to get Richard Farmer to look at the papers without success.Grebanier, pp. 136‚Äì37. The exhibition, which roused much public excitement, continued for more than a year. On 17 November Ireland and his son carried the papers to St. James's Palace, where the Duke of Clarence and Mrs. Jordan examined them, and on 30 December Ireland submitted them to the Prince of Wales at Carlton House.DNB. Vortigern and Rowena As early as 26 December 1794 William Henry had announced the existence of Shakespeare's unknown play Vortigern and Rowena, but it was not until March that he was able to present his father with the manuscript. It came with Shakespeare's correspondence with a printer purporting to explain why the play was unpublished.Kahan, pp. 62‚Äì66. Both Richard Brinsley Sheridan of Drury Lane Theatre and Thomas Harris of Covent Garden expressed an interest in producing the play. Sheridan was the winner in this competition. Prompted by fears that a descendant of Shakespeare might surface to claim the rights to his productions, William Henry produced a deed to prove that one of his ancestors, coincidentally named William Henry Ireland, had saved Shakespeare from drowning, and that Shakespeare had rewarded him with all the newly discovered manuscripts.William Henry Ireland, Authentic Account. pp. 22‚Äì23. Publication of the MSS Samuel Ireland announced the publication of the papers on 4 March 1795, and the volume itself appeared in December of that year. William Henry had bitterly opposed this move, but his father was determined. Included were such items as the \\"Profession of Faith,\\" the letter from Queen Elizabeth, and the manuscript of King Lear. Henry II, Vortigern, and the marginalia were excluded from this volume. Shortly after the appearance of the book Samuel Ireland's neighbour, Albany Wallis, who had discovered one of the few authentic signatures of Shakespeare, came up with a new and startling discovery. He had turned up a genuine John Heminges signature, and of course it looked nothing like the signatures William Henry had produced. When the forger learned of this problem, however, he soon produced Heminges signatures that resembled the authentic one. It seems, William Henry explained, that there were two actors named John Heminges active at the time‚Äîhence the dissimilar signatures. Controversy The volume was not well received. The first reply was James Boaden's A Letter to George Steevens (16 January 1796).Eu. Hood, \\"Fly-Leaves, No. XXXI: Pseudo- Shakspeare,\\" in Gentleman's Magazine, May 1826, p.421. Boaden concentrated on the manuscript of Lear, observing that if this is Shakespeare's original, and the printed versions contaminated with alterations by the actors, then the players are \\"at once converted ... into the most elaborate and polished masters of versification, and Shakspeare into a writer without the necessary ear for rhythm‚Äîa man who produced a series of harmonious versification by chance, and lost the supreme ascendancy in his art, from the not being able to number ten syllables upon his fingers.\\" He also took aim at the spelling.James Boaden, A Letter to George Steevens, pp. 7, 21; summary in Grebanier, pp. 185‚Äì7. Samuel Ireland's friends and supporters raced in with replies. Colonel Francis Webb, writing under the name \\"Philalethes,\\" argued that as the paper was old the documents must have belonged to Shakespeare's time; there would have been no reason to forge them then; therefore they must be genuine.Summary in Grebanier, p. 189ff. Matthew Wyatt took potshots at Boaden by contrasting his views as a believer with those after his conversion. Walley Chamberlain Oulton maintained that the papers were so voluminous that forgery was out of the question. He expressed a hope that Vortigern would turn out to be genuine, as it might well revitalise contemporary drama. He looked to the judgment of the audience for the play's vindication. Exposure Two crushing blows came quickly. The first was the publication of Malone's volume of over four hundred pages on 31 March 1796. Exposing the forgeries in detail, he showed one by one that each document was flawed in its handwriting, its language, its orthography, and its history. The spelling of the documents was not only not that of Shakespeare's time, it was that of no time whatsoever. Numerous historical inaccuracies‚Äînot least of which was the reference to the Globe before that playhouse had been built‚Äîexposed the forger's ignorance. The handwriting of the Queen and Southampton did not at all resemble authentic examples. Words appearing in the forgeries (upset, for example) were not used in Shakespeare's time, or were used in a different sense than that of the papers.Malone, An Inquiry into the Authenticity of Certain Miscellaneous Papers and Legal Instruments, passim. For the general objection to the spelling of the papers, see p. 33. For the anachronistic reference to the Globe see pp. 184‚Äì8. For Queen Elizabeth's handwriting see pp. 103‚Äì116. For the word upset see pp. 219‚Äì220. Vortigern's failure The second blow came two days later, on 2 April, with the failure of Vortigern at Drury Lane Theatre. The excitement was intense and the crowd volatile; tickets had sold out early and seats were hard come by. While at first the play seemed to be a success with the audience, soon fits of laughter were heard and at one point the play came to a complete halt till order was restored. When Barrymore announced another performance of the play, the audience rebelled, and chaos reigned until the management substituted something else.Joseph Farington, diary entry for 2 April 1796, in the Farington Diary (London 1922‚Äì28), p. 145; James Anson Farrer, Literary Forgeries (London, 1907), pp. 226‚Äì232. William Henry Ireland blamed the actors, particularly Kemble, along with a \\"Malone faction,\\" for the failure of his play.Confessions, pp. 156‚Äì159. Others attributed it to the quality of the play itself.Farington, op. cit.; William P. Marsh, Clubs of London (London, 1828), volume 2, pp. 107‚Äì111. Vortigern's opening night was also its final performance. Aftermath For the Irelands, father and son, the failure of the play, coupled with Malone's exposure of the hoax, was an unmitigated disaster. Samuel Ireland still believed the papers to be Shakespeare's, and refused to listen to anything his son had to say. William Henry confessed the forgery to his sisters, to his mother, and to Albany Wallis, but his father did not believe his story. The public, not surprisingly, accused Samuel Ireland of the fraud. Sales of his books suffered.DNB p. 34. Blaming Malone for his misfortunes, Samuel Ireland set out to write a book that would destroy the scholar's reputation. With the aid of Thomas Caldecott he attacked Malone for using forensic techniques like handwriting comparison to settle a literary question, rather than relying on taste and aesthetic sensibilities.DNB, p. 35; Samuel Ireland, Investigation; see especially 46‚Äì49. Concerned for his father's reputation William Henry rushed into print with a pamphlet confessing to the forgeries, and his father replied immediately with a vindication of his conduct in the whole affair.Hood, p. 422. William Henry Ireland says in the opening statement to the Authentic Account that his motive is \\"to remove the odium under which my father labours\\". This combination roused suspicions. George Steevens accused the two of collusion: > The hopeful youth takes on himself the guilt of the entire forgery, and > strains hard to exculpate his worthy father from the slightest participation > in it. The father, on the contrary, declares that his son had not sufficient > abilities for the execution of so difficult a task. Between them, in short, > there is a pretended quarrel, that they may not look as if they were acting > in concert on the present occasion.George Steevens to Bishop Percy, 26 > December 1796, in John Bowyers Nichols, Illustrations of the Literary > History of the Eighteenth Century (London, 1848), volume 7, pp. 7‚Äì8. The charge would stick. George Chalmers' Apology for the Believers and Samuel Ireland's Investigation concentrated on attacking Malone rather than exonerating Samuel, and the public verdict was probably summed up in a print by John Nixon depicting the entire Ireland family engaged in forging the papers.DNB, p. 35. The Nixon print, \\"The Oaken Chest, or, The Gold Mines of Ireland a Farce is available at the Folger Library web site . Samuel Ireland's culpability The culpability of Samuel Ireland remained a controversial topic for years to come. Although his son's Confessions (1805) did a great deal to establish his innocence, not everybody was convinced. Accounts by Clement Mansfield Ingleby in 1859 and George Dawson in 1888 took the position that the father was responsible for the forgeries and the son's Confession was a tissue of lies. The acquisition of Samuel Ireland's papers by the British Museum in 1876, however, provided a wealth of evidence that Samuel was the victim rather than the perpetrator of the fraud, and Ingleby changed his position in his 1881 paper on the Ireland Affair.\\"The Literary Career of a Shakespeare Forger\\" in volume 2 of Shakespeare: the Man and the Book. This issue is covered on pp. 156‚Äì163. See also Farrer, p. 236. Legacy After Samuel Ireland's death in 1800, the original forgeries, bound in three folio volumes, were sold to John \\"Dog\\" Dent, MP and bibliophile. The collections passed through several hands before being acquired by Mary Morley Crapo Hyde (1912‚Äî2003) and her first husband, Donald Hyde (1909‚Äî1966). She left the volumes to Harvard's Houghton Library after her death.Freeman, Arthur. \\"The Actual Originals\\" in The Times Literary Supplement 5716 (19 October 2012), pp. 14‚Äî15.

The stories range from wry comic commentary to elegant and direct meditations on themes of love, relationships, and being alive now. His two dimensional work takes the form of books incorporating drawings and writings, color prints of his drawings and short stories, as well as greeting cards and calendars. The mixed-media sculptures incorporating salvaged wood in deliberately crude shapes, bright colors, hand drawings (especially faces) and rubber-stamped imprints of his writings went out of production in June, 2015.Young 1996, p. C3.Webb 2006, p. 2D.Watts 1995, Sketchbook. In 1994, Skye founded an Iowa company, StoryPeople, to distribute his work worldwide. In 2012 he founded tumblecloud.com, a collaborative digital storytelling platform. In 2014, he founded brianandreas.com as a platform for his original art and his other creative projects. In 2015, he was a key collaborator in the formation of A Hundred Ways North, a company focused on using stories and workshops to transform the ways people find and sustain community. In 2016, he signed an exclusive arrangement to distribute his new writing and artwork with Flying Edna and that continues to be the case today. In 2016, Skye legally changed his name to Kai Andreas Skye.Iowa District Court, Winneshiek County, Case Number CNCV026150 2016. He continues to use the pen name Brian Andreas in his older published work and his legal name, Kai Skye, in his work after June, 2020. Per a 2019 divorce decree in Iowa,Iowa District Court, Winneshiek County, Case CDDM002711 2019 Skyes no longer holds any rights to his art and writing before September 2012, nor is he associated with StoryPeople, the company he founded and created. His earlier stories, prints and books to September 2012 continue to be released by StoryPeople. The work created after September 2012 is published for both national and international audiences by Flying Edna. He currently lives in Montana. Background Andreas was born in 1956 in Iowa City and grew up in Chicago, Illinois. He graduated from Luther College in Decorah, Iowa, in 1979 with a BA in Theater and English. He went on to receive his MFA in Fiber and Mixed Media in 1992 from the John F. Kennedy University in Orinda, California,Langton 1998, cover. where he focused on Fiber, with an emphasis on story as the fiber of human community.Brainard 1994, B8. It was during 1992-1993, in conjunction with the Graduate School of Arts and Consciousness at JFK University, that he coordinated an early Internet experiment in collaborative storytelling called the Hall of Whispers.  Hall of Whispers  Andreas set out to ask people to share stories about their experience of being alive, using the Internet of the early 1990s.Wiley 1995, p. 2A. Of this experiment, he wrote: > \\"Hall of Whispers takes its name from an ancient Babylonian myth of a > specially constructed room in one of the ziggurats (stepped pyramids), in > which the walls were so highly polished that a whisper would stay alive > forever. I have an image of the electronic networks whispering ceaselessly > with the voices of our times. > \\"The form of the project is deceptively simple ... to create a situation ... > where we could join each other around a technological campfire ... to create > a virtual community using an ancient fundamental of community-making: shared > stories ... a council model for understanding our world ... that it is in > the sharing that greater wisdom evolves. Finally, in a turbulent world, it > is easy to lose sight of the small beauties and moments of grace that occur > constantly around us. I wanted Hall of Whispers to give voice to that side > of ourselves that recognizes that this is as much a time of renewal as it is > a time of decay.\\"Andreas 1993, pp. 256-257. Using the nascent Internet as well as fax, phone and standard mail, Skye ultimately gathered more than 4,000 stories from around the world.Brainard 1994, p. B8. StoryPeople At the time of Hall of Whispers, Skye was living with his former spouse in Berkeley, and was focusing artistically on stone sculpting. \\"I had lots of white, black and beige around but no color.\\"[9] The first StoryPeople sculpture was made from a board pulled from a dilapidated fence outside of his Berkeley, California studio. It was cut it into a stylized human figure, and then painted it in bright colors. Further experiments with these figures included hand stamped text along with the color and a softly blended face. Soon, these sculptural 'people' began to sell, first at the Marin Swap Meet in Sausalito, California, and then later at wine and music festivals in the San Francisco Bay area.Nathan 1998, p. 25. Encouraged by the results, Skye and his family subsequently left Berkeley early in 1994 and returned to Decorah, Iowa, where he had previously graduated from Luther College. As the result of the Hall of Whispers and the fence-board experiments, it was written that \\"he discovered the StoryPeople waiting to be carved out of rough barn board, painted in bright colors, and hand-lettered with their individual stories.\\"Wiley 1995, p. 1A. He \\"gives voice to the vision of the child and the unsophisticated in books that listen to unnamed 'StoryPeople,' who express themselves through hand-stamped print, as if epigrammatically.\\"Marty 1998, p. 14. Skye established the company headquarters of StoryPeople in downtown Decorah, Iowa, in May 1994. Skye spent the next decade directing the production of wood sculptures, print reproductions, books, greeting card sets and furniture all bearing his trademark \\"bright colors . . . and hand-lettered stories.\\" He and his family returned to California in 2001Webb 2006, 2D. where they remained until 2011, when Skye and his spouse separated. He remained in California until 2015 where he continued to innovate with new stories and new media and created original works on large canvases. In April 2015, he moved back to Iowa to work more closely with his production team at StoryPeople and to collaborate more closely with A Hundred Ways North, a startup focused on workshops and conversations around creativity and community. As he said in a recent interview about those conversations, \\"We're exploring what it is to be a larger consciousness. [...W]e're also exploring what it is to create stories that allow people to live more fully.\\"Wilcox 2016, B4. He also speaks nationally on the topics of creativity, writing, art and storytelling. Of his work, Skye says, \\"I like art that admits to being a part of life. The moments I have with my friends and family are really all that I need. I like to take them and weave them into stories that are filled with laughter and music and lunacy. And they are mostly true, but I'm not telling which parts. . . \\" \\"I have a real quirky view of the world. A century ago I would have been standing on a soapbox in Hyde Park telling people about a better way of seeing.\\"Young 1996, C3. \\"[Because] when it's all said and done, everyone should pay attention to the beauty and richness of their lives. One person can't be creative with someone else's guidelines. Do what lights you up. It's much simpler and easier than you think.\\"Besancon 2016, B1. Skye's first book of hand-stamped stories and black-and-white line drawings, entitled Mostly True, was first published in August, 1993. Still Mostly True followed in May 1994, and to date Skye's publications include a total of nineteen books. The book \\"Cuba: This Moment, Exactly So\\", Skye's collaboration with photographer Lorne Resnick, was the winner of two major awards in 2016: a gold IPPY from the Independent Publisher Book Awards, and a silver IBPA Benjamin Franklin Award from Independent Book Publishers Association. tumblecloud With his experience in design, storytelling and digital collaboration, Skye founded tumblecloud in April, 2008. The intention was to create a new communication platform that \\"will change the way we view ourselves & the planet. Moving from data to meaning. With tools that will help us remember that we're all creative & beautiful & alive. Tools that will help us remember who we are.\\"Andreas, 2009 With an initial group of angel investors, the company built a browser-agnostic workspace for people to arrange, co-create and publish their collaborations, using integrated tools for manipulating cloud-stored multimedia objects. The company was unable to secure further funding in 2014 and subsequently dissolved. A Hundred Ways North In the second quarter of 2015, Skye began a collaboration with Ball State University professor, Fia J Skye (n√©e Wendy Saver), and her company A Hundred Ways North. With his background in story as the fibre of human community and her background in movement, voice, and helping the body to inhabit space fully, they currently lead public and corporate workshops on creativity and collaboration. The workshops \\"focus on three things: alignment, partnering and creating spaces where learning can happen.\\"Saver 2016, About Us. They also collaborate with various non-profits around the world, such as JDRF, to help create stories that give voice to the overall mission of each organization.

Railway of the C√¥tes-du- Nord), the C√¥tes-d'Armor today, was a , metre gauge, railway in C√¥tes-du-Nord, France, although there were a few kilometres of line in Finist√®re and Ille-et- Vilaine. The first lines opened in 1905 and final closure was in 1956. The lines were a voie ferr√©e d'int√©r√™t local system with a total extent of . The system was constructed in two stages, the initial lines built between 1905 and 1907, and the extensions during and after the First World War which were opened between 1916 and 1926. These lines would make the CdN slightly bigger than the R√©seau Breton. The first closures were in 1937, but the Second World War gave the CdN a stay of execution, and parts of the system remained open until 1956. Former railways in C√¥tes-du-Nord History St. Brieuc stationThe CdN had its headquarters at St. Brieuc. The first two lines to open were Paimpol ‚Äì Lannion ‚Äì St. Brieuc ‚Äì Rostrenen and Planco√´t ‚Äì Lancieux in 1905. The engineer was Louis Auguste Marie Harel de la No√´, who built many of the bridges and viaducts in concrete. The CdN was noted for its heavy engineering, including the impressive viaducts viaduc du Souzain and viaduc du Toupin. In 1909, further extensions were authorised. St. Brieuc ‚Äì Plemy ‚Äì Loudeac, Plemy ‚Äì Dinan, a connection to Plestin les Gr√®ves to link to the Chemins de Fer Armoricains and other lines. These were not completed until 1926 owing to the First World War. Despite the introduction of railcars the first closures took place in 1937. Although some lines were reopened during World War II, by 1950 the only section open was St. Brieuc ‚Äì Paimpol, which closed on 31 December 1956.French Wikipedia article Lines The CdN system can be considered as four main lines, with their branches. =St. Brieuc ‚Äì Plestin-les-Gr√®ves= St. Brieuc station Viaduc du Parfond de Gou√´t Viaduc de Souzain Viaduc de Beaufeuillage The line from St. Brieuc Centrale to Plouha opened on 20 June 1905 and closed on 31 December 1956. St. Brieuc Centrale ‚Äì St. Brieuc Ouest opened on 11 April 1907, giving a total length of . The line was very close to the coast in places, and heavily engineered, with thirteen bridges in . The main bridges were the Pont de Gou√´dic and Pont de Rohannec'h at Saint-Brieuc, the Viaduc de Souzain between Saint-Brieuc and Pl√©rin, the Viaduc de Colv√©, Viaduc de Tosse-Montagne and Viaduc de Grognet and the Viaduc de la Horvaie at Pl√©rin, the Viaduc du Parfond du Gou√´t ( long, high), the Viaduc de la Has√©e, Viaduc de Beaufeuillage and Pont en biais sur l'Ic at Binic, and the Viaduc de Ponto and Viaduc des Pourrhis at √âtables-sur-Mer. Viaduc de Br√©hec The line between Plouha and Paimpol opened on 1 May 1924 and closed on 31 December 1956.

Viaduc de L√©zardrieux The line between Paimpol and Tr√©guier opened on 1 May 1924 and closed on 31 March 1950. There were two major bridges on the line, the Viaduc de L√©zardrieux near Trieux ( long and high) and the Viaduc sur le Jaudy at Tr√©guier. This latter was destroyed by the Resistance in 1944. Reconstruction started in September 1946 but the central arch collapsed and the work was abandoned. The failure to rebuild the bridge accelerated the closure of the line west of Paimpol. Pont sur le L√©guer The line between Tr√©guier and Lannion opened on 11 August 1906 and closed on 15 April 1949. There were two stations at Lannion, Lannion-Ouest was opposite the station of the CF de l'Ouest. The other station was Lannion-Ville. The station at Perros-Guirec was situated by the harbour, and saw much tourist traffic from Lannion. The line had a junction with the Tr√©guiler ‚Äì Lannion line at Petit Camp, and it was connected to Plestin-les-Gr√®ves in the winter of 1916. The only major bridge was the Pont sur le L√©guer between Lannion-Ouest and Lannion-Ville. left The construction of the line between Lannion and Plestin-les-Gr√®ves started in August 1912. Plestin-les-Gr√®ves ‚Äì Pont Menou opened on 21 July 1914 for passengers and 1 July 1915 for freight. This line linked with the Chemins de Fer Armoricains.

Branches Construction of the line between St. Brieuc and Le Phare was completed on 21 September 1905, but the line was not opened until 1 March 1906. Closure was on 31 December 1948. The line to Le Phare branched off the St. Brieuc ‚Äì Plouha line on the Viaduc de Souzain. There were eight stations and halts. There were no major bridges after the line had branched off the Viaduc de Souzain. The line between Plouha and Guingamp opened on 20 June 1905 and closed on 15 May 1939. Guingamp station was a junction with the R√©seau Breton (RB) line between Carhaix and Paimpol, and also with the standard gauge Chemins de Fer de l'Ouest. There was a short section of dual gauge line with the metre gauge rails laid between the standard gauge rails in an identical way to that seen on the Chemin de Fer de la Baie de Somme. The only major bridge was the Viaduc de Blanchardeau at Lanvollon. The branch from Pleumier-Gautier to Pleubian opened on 1 May 1924 and closed on 31 March 1950.

The line had a junction with the Lannion ‚Äì Perros Guirec line at Petit Camp. The biggest accident in the history of the CdN occurred on this line in December 1920 (see Accidents section). The main bridges on the line were the Ponts Noirs between Tr√©uier and Plouguiel, and the Passerelles de Plougiel and Viaduc de Kerd√©ozer at Plouguiel. The line between Tr√©guier and Plou√´c-du-Trieux opened on 9 March 1905 and closed on 15 May 1939. At Plou√´c- du-Trieux there was a junction with the RB Guingamp ‚Äì Paimpol line. Tr√©guier was the junction of lines to Lannion, Perros and Paimpol. It was also the site of a locomotive depot. The major bridges on this section of line were the Pont sur le Jaudy at La Roche Derrien, the viaduc de Loqu√©lo at Minihy-Tr√©guier and the Pont du Chef du Bois at Pommerit-Jaudy. =St. Brieuc ‚Äì Rostrenen= left The line between Quintin and Rostrenen opened on 15 May 1907 and closed on 1 August 1938. Quintin station was served by the CF de l'Ouest. Rostrenen was served by the R√©seau Breton line between Carhaix and Loud√©ac. Until the construction of the Guingamp ‚Äì St. Nicolas du P√©lem line this line was isolated from the rest of the CdN network, although it was connected via the R√©seau Breton. The only major bridge was the Passerelle de Quintin. Branches The line between Guingamp and St. Nicolas opened on 12 January 1924 and closed on 1 August 1938. Guingamp was a major junction, with lines to St. Brieuc and Brest served by the Chemin de Fer de l'Ouest; lines to Carhaix and Paimpol served by the RB, and the line between St. Nicolas-du- P√©lem and Plouha on the CdN network. At St. Nicolas-du-P√©lem there was a junction with the Quintin ‚Äì Rostrenen line. The major bridges were the Viaduc de Cadolan at Guingamp and the Viaduc de Kerlosquer at Ploumagoar. =St. Brieuc ‚Äì Dinan= Pont de Gou√´dic Viaduc de Douvenant The line between St. Brieuc and Moncontour opened on 1 May 1905 and closed to passengers on 1 April 1937. Final closure occurred on 27 April 1939. At Langueux, a branch was built to serve a brick and tile works, which supplied materials for the construction of the stations of the CdN. The main bridges on this section of line were the Viaduc de Souzain ( long, high), Pont de Gou√´dic, Viaduc de Toupin and Pont des Courses at St. Brieuc, and the Viaduc de Douvenant ( long, high), Viaduc de Vau-Herv√© and Pont de la Cage at Langueux. It is on this section of line that a heritage railway is being created. The line between Moncontour and Collin√©e opened on 1 July 1907 and closed on 24 April 1939. It was on this line that the CdN reached its highest point of above sea level. Passerelles du Gouray, 2005 The line between Collin√©e and Dinan was an extension of the Moncontour ‚Äì Collin√©e line. It opened on 8 October 1925 and closed on 1 April 1937. The lines' opening was delayed due to World War One. A projected line between Collin√©e and Merdrignac may have brought more traffic to the line and avoided its early closure. This line, had it opened, would have transformed Collin√©e into a major junction. The line crossed the Chemin de Fer de l'Ouest on the level at Jugon, following which it climbed in the direction of Dinan and passed through one of the few tunnels on the CdN network. At Dinan there was a bridge over the CF de l'Ouest's Dinan ‚Äì La Brohini√®re line. The main bridges on the line were the Pont de l'Aublette at Dinan, the Pont du Marchis at Jugon and the Passerelles du Gouray at Gouray. Branches The line between Pl√©my and Loud√©ac opened on 6 April 1925 and closed on 1 April 1937. The line had a junction with the line between Moncontour and Collin√©e. Loud√©ac station had a junction with the RB and CFde l'Ouest. The only major bridge was the Pont sur le Lie at Plouguenast. =St. Brieuc ‚Äì Dinard= Viaduc de CaroualThe line between Yffiniac and Matignon was opened in stages. Yfinniac ‚Äì St. Alban on 23 February 1924, St. Alban ‚Äì Erquy on 3 February 1924, Erquy ‚Äì Pl√©herel on 3 November 1925, Pl√©herel ‚Äì Pl√©heron on 27 June 1926 and Pl√©heron ‚Äì Matignon on 27 June 1926. It closed on 31 December 1948. In 1929, a train derailed at Port √† la Dux. The locomotive fell down an embankment and the driver was killed. The main bridges on the line were the Viaduc de Caroual ou de Cav√©, the Ponceau de la C√¥ti√®re and the Passerelle de la C√¥ti√®re at Erquy, the Viaduc des Ponts-Neufs at Hillion ( long, high), the Viaduc du Pr√©to at Pl√©neuf-Val-Andr√© and the Viaduc de Port-Nieux at Fr√©hel. =Branches= The line between St. Alban and Lamballe opened on 11 July 1922 and closed on 31 December 1948. Lamballe station was also served by the Rennes ‚Äì Brest line of the CF de l'Ouest. Pont de GuildoThe line between Planco√´t and St. Cast opened on 18 September 1905 and closed on 15 February 1939. The section between Matignon and St. Cast temporarily reopened from 12 October 1940. This isolated section of the CdN was linked to the rest of the network in 1926 with the opening of the Yffinac ‚Äì Matignon and St. Brieuc ‚Äì St. Cast lines. Planco√´t station was also served by the CF de l'Ouest, and thus was quite an important station on the CdN network. The only major bridge was the Pond de Guildo which carried dual gauge track serving the Chemin de Fer de l'Ouest and the CdN. This bridge had five spans of and an opening span of , giving a total length of . It was demolished in 1974. The line between Le Guildo and Lancieux opened on 14 July 1926. The section between St. Briac and Lancieux opened in 1932 and the entire line closed on 15 February 1939. Between Ploubalay and Lancieux the line ran alongside the road. The line connected with the St. Cast ‚Äì Le Guildo line. The line was also to connect with the St. Briac ‚Äì Dinard line of the Tramways Ille-et-Vilaine, but as the Pont sur le Fr√©mur was completed in 1928 the Tramways Ille-et-Vilaine closed. World War Two During World War Two, the CdN was requisitioned by the Germans for the construction of the Atlantic Wall. The Resistance were active in the area, with over fifty acts of sabotage recorded. In most cases the train crews were pre-warned and no injuries occurred. One of the most impressive was the destruction by the French Forces of the Interior of the viaduct between Jaudy and Tr√©guier on 15 August 1944, splitting the network in two.

The device is usually mentioned as a joke between nerds, in the manner of a fool's errand, since there is no evidence of one ever having been constructed until very recently. One of the earliest printed references to these devices was made by Richard Feynman, who was told by a colleague at Frankford Arsenal in Philadelphia that the cable-passing version of the device had been used during both world wars on German naval mine mooring cables, to prevent the mines from being caught by British cables swept along the sea bottom. The device was supposed to work using a spoked, rimless wheel that allows cables to pass through as it rotates.

Finkelstein studied photography under Alexey Brodovitch, the art director of Harper's Bazaar and worked as a photojournalist for the Black Star and PIX photo agencies, reporting primarily on the political developments of various subcultures in New York City in the 1960s. In 1964, Finkelstein entered Andy Warhol's Factory as a photojournalist and remained for three years; Finkelstein's photographs from this period are now regarded as some of the most iconic of the time. Early life Nat Finkelstein was born in Brooklyn and grew up in Coney Island, where his father worked as a cab driver. Finkelstein graduated from Stuyvesant High School in 1950 and in 1952 he enrolled in Brooklyn College, where he first became interested in photography through the inspiration that he found in great photographers such as Edward Steichen. It was also here that developed his militant political tendencies, to the extent that he was expelled during his final semester after he threw a filing cabinet through a window to protest censorship of a campus publication. Career After his expulsion, he managed to acquire an internship with the art director of Harper's Bazaar, Alexey Brodovitch (who famously brought Cocteau, Chagall, and Man Ray to illustrate the magazine). Brodovitch took a liking to the feisty boy from Brooklyn and allowed him to assist on fashion shoots. Fashion journalism led to photojournalism for Sport's Illustrated, covering events like bridge tournaments, dog shows, chess, and fencing matches. Finkelstein was signed by the PIX and Black Star agencies (the latter supplied Life magazine with much imagery) through which he was able to meet and spend time with established photographers Robert Capa, Eugene Smith, and Andreas Feininger. He specialized in chronicling the various subcultures of the United States at the time, an interest that led him to Harlem's burgeoning jazz and soul scenes, Warhol's factory, and later to cover the antiwar rallies and emerging counterculture.Nat Finkelstein: photographer.\\" Times Online. Times Newspapers Ltd, 17 Oct. 2009. Web. =Andy Warhol and The Factory= In September 1962 Finkelstein was commissioned by Pageant magazine to do an article on the emerging Pop Art movement. The article was titled \\"What happens at a Happening?\\" it covered a Claes Oldenburg \\"happening\\" in Greenwich Village and was a break that would define his future. Two years later, while attending a party at the Factory, Finkelstein met Warhol, who had seen his photographs of Oldenburg's \\"happening\\" in Pageant. Finkelstein offered his services as a photographer to the artist, and for the next three years he was a constant presence at the Factory. His iconic images of the include subjects such as the Velvet Underground performing live, Marcel Duchamp, Bob Dylan, Edie Sedgwick, Salvador Dal√≠, and Allen Ginsberg. =Political activist and fugitive= During his time at the Factory, Finkelstein was also involved with other affairs. A political radical, he helped organize civil rights rallies and anti-war demonstration and also became involved with the Black Panthers. As a result, in 1969 a warrant was issued for the arrest of Finkelstein in connection with an old drug case. He fled the United States, claiming he was worried that the government might try to assassinate him. He spent the next decade as a fugitive, following the Silk Road through the Middle East and selling hashish to support himself.Spinner. AOL, 14 Oct. 2009. Web. =Return to the U.S. and drug addiction= Finkelstein returned to the United States in 1982 when he became aware that charges against him had been dropped. He became involved in the New York punk music scene, managing bands such as Khmer Rouge (featuring Phil Shoenfelt), whose members he used as photographic subjects. He made frequent visits to Bolivia to nourish an addiction to cocaine.Grimes, William. \\"Nat Finkelstein, ‚ÄòCourt Photographer‚Äô of Andy Warhol‚Äôs Factory, Dies at 76.\\" The New York Times. 13 Oct. 2009. Web. 28 Oct. 2009 The death of Warhol in 1987 came as a wake-up call to Finkelstein and by 1989 he had weaned himself off the drugs and reignited his career in photography. His affinity for subcultures remained and in the 1990s he spent time as part of the rave scene, first in London, then Amsterdam, and back to New York. He shot a generation of New York club kids, a group that he recorded in his 1993 book Merry Monsters. Finkelstein now found himself in constant demand, he had over seventy-five solo and group shows at museums and galleries worldwide. His images appeared in magazines such as Life, Time, Sport's Illustrated, Harper's & Queen, Vogue and The New York Times Magazine. Death Finkelstein died of complications from pneumonia and emphysema at his home in Shandaken, New York on October 2, 2009. He was 76. His first four marriages ended in divorce. In addition to his wife, Elizabeth, he is survived by a brother, Howard. At the time of his death, he was near completing a memoir entitled The Fourteen-Ounce Pound. Quotes \\"I watched pop die and punk being born.\\" Exhibitions Finkelstein exhibited his work worldwide in over seventy-five solo and group shows at museums and galleries including the Cedar Bar, the International Center of Photography, Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; the Andy Warhol Museum, Pittsburgh; Tate Modern, Victoria and Albert Museum, The Photographer's Gallery, the Saatchi Gallery, London; and the Ludwig Museum, Budapest, among many others.

It was designed to be a sturdy aircraft for inexperienced solo pilots and so uses a simple and rugged construction and has docile handling characteristics. Design The ASK 18 was designed by Rudolf Kaiser and was the last Schleicher glider to use the traditional construction method, at a time when contemporary aircraft of the same class, such as the Grob G-102 Astir, were made of glass-fibre. The fuselage was derived from the Ka 8 and used welded steel tube and spruce longerons. It is covered in fabric. The wings are from the Ka 6E but with 16-metre span. They have a single wooden spar. The rear part of the wing is fabric-covered and the ailerons are plywood-covered. The tailplane came from the K 10; the fin and tailplane are plywood-covered and the rudder and elevators are fabric covered. A Flettner trim tab is fitted to the elevator. Only the nose cone is glass-fibre. The main-wheel is fixed and has a brake. There is a tail-skid but no nose-skid. The Schempp-Hirth airbrakes extend above and below the wing. First flight was in October 1974. A variation was the ASK 18B which had a span reduced to 15m. At the end of production in 1977 38 K18s and 9 K18Bs had been built by Schleicher and one unknown variant built from a kit. A further 8 K18-ARs were produced in Argentina.

Kelley. The film stars Judd Nelson, Elizabeth Perkins, John Hurt, Ray Walston, and Darren McGavin. Plot Fresh out of law school, Robin \\"Stormy\\" Weathers (Judd Nelson) cannot stand the tedium of case filing and research. Desperately wanting to \\"practice law\\" and go to trial, one morning he intentionally withholds the fact that a trial is scheduled to begin that very afternoon to compel his superiors to let him try the case because he is the only one familiar with the facts of the case. During his meeting with the client (the president of a bank who intentionally struck another banker), the banker declares the \\"simple assault case\\" to be a no-winner (explaining that he hits people all the time), but wants the one-day trial to somehow be stretched to three days to run up the other banker's court fees. Weathers prolongs the case by creating a 1st Amendment constitutional challenge as to the admissibility of the word \\"asshole\\". Escalating the case into a media frenzy, the senior partners of the law firm are embarrassed by Weathers' behavior and unconventional methods and try to fire him. The client retaliates on Weathers' behalf threatening to take the bank's business elsewhere. Weathers appears to be crafty and intuitive, but in reality, had conspired with the other attorney (a friend of his) to stage a brilliant legal engagement to make themselves look good. Weathers wins the trial and in doing so attracts a plethora of new clients to the firm which skyrockets him to be a junior partner. In an act of unfair retaliation, Weathers is assigned to be lead defense counsel in a first-degree murder case involving university professor Douglas Benoit (John Hurt) who is almost certainly guilty of bludgeoning a prostitute to death with the claw of a hammer. Benoit wanted Weathers because he saw him in the previous case. Weathers takes the case and his loud and odd courtroom behavior soon amazes the judge, the spectators and sometimes embarrasses his girlfriend Jo Ann (Elizabeth Perkins). Determined to impress his employers by winning a verdict of not guilty, no matter what, his courtroom antics soon visibly gain even the jury's favor and raise the likelihood of acquittal. Weathers unsuccessfully tries to get Benoit to accept a plea-bargain to manslaughter charges and soon discovers that Benoit is guilty: in a thinly-veiled confession used to taunt his own defense attorney, Benoit vividly describes to him the \\"clarity of mind\\" it takes for a man to be able to split someone's skull open with the claw of a hammer... while the person remains alive. Weathers becomes conflicted between his sense of duty and ethics and his moral obligation to see Benoit pay for his crime. Despite the possibility of being disbarred, he decides to antagonize Benoit into a confession on the stand.

Early life Philpot was born in Clapham, London, but the family moved to Herne in Kent shortly afterwards. Philpot grew up to be both a gay man, and a practising Christian who converted to Roman Catholicism. Philpot studied at the Lambeth School of Art (now known as City and Guilds of London Art School) in 1900 where he was taught by Philip Connard, and at the Acad√©mie Julian in Paris.Oxford index, Benezit Dictionary of Artists Career Philpot first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1904 and was elected to that establishment in 1923. He was a member of the International Society from 1913 and in that year he was awarded the gold medal at the Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh. He enjoyed a \\"comfortable income\\" from portraiture. He was reported as doing ten or twelve commissions a year, charging between ¬£600 and ¬£3,000 a time. This enabled him to afford to travel to France, Italy, America and North Africa and continue to paint less commercially successful subject pictures. Following the Symbolist tradition his subject pictures reflected more personal concerns and contradictions: Philpot converted to Catholicism, yet his interest in the male nude and portraits of young men ‚Äì thought to be friends, models and lovers ‚Äì show his gradual acceptance and expression of his own homosexuality. Some of these later works were considered controversial because of their homosexual imagery. Two pieces in particular ‚Äì Guardian of the Flame and The Great Pan (1930) were withdrawn from the Royal Academy. This led to a loss of popularity which caused him financial hardship. Exhibitions have been held at The Tate Gallery (1938), The Ashmolean Museum, The National Portrait Gallery, of which he was a founder member in 1911, and Pallant House Gallery. Philpot was a member of the International Society of Sculptors, Painters and Gravers. Personal life Glyn Philpot's grave Philpot was in a relationship with painter Vivian Forbes from 1923 to 1935. A loving cup held by Brighton Museum serves as a testament to their relationship. Philpot died from a stroke in December 1937; his funeral took place on 22 December 1937. Forbes committed suicide the following day. He is buried in a pink granite tomb in St Peter's Churchyard, Petersham, in west London.Who's Buried Where in London, by Peter Matthews, Bloomsbury Publishing, 23 Mar 2017, pg 242 Works Sources * Delaney, J.

Luis Farell had 11 siblings, including the senior politician Arsenio Farell Cubillas. Training Luis Farell attended school in Mexico City and in February 1911 at the age of 9 years and along with 30,000 spectators, Farell witnessed the aerial exhibition of the Moisant brothers with Bl√©riot airplanes carried out in the fields of Balbuena in Mexico City. In 1920, at the age of 18 years, Farell graduated as accountant just after the military-political events that caused the fall of President Venustiano Carranza. This rebellion had three important leaders: General Alvaro Obreg√≥n, General Plutarco El√≠as Calles and Adolfo de la Huerta. In August 1920, the President Adolfo de la Huerta hired three famous veteran and foreign pilots of World War I with the purpose of training Mexican pilots in modern tactics and organizing a functional air force. The foreign instructors were the American Ralph O'Neill,O'Neill, Ralph flying n Mexico, biography. Skyways magazine, 28/October/1993 the German Fritz Bieler and the French instructor Joe Ben Lievre. Ralph O'Neill was designated as Chief Instructor of the Military school of Aviation and under orders of General Gustavo Salinas;Gustavo Salinas, an 'Early Bird' of aviation the Mexican instructors were Alberto Carranza, Horacio Ruiz Gavi√±o and the brothers Juan Pablo Aldasoro and Eduardo Aldasoro.Mexican Air force's photo gallery When the Mexican government announced recruitment of aviators for the new Mexican Air Force, Farell applied on July 12, 1920, and enrolled as a cadet on November 11, 1920. This was a time at which, given the shortage produced by the war in Europe, Mexico had only 18 airplanes: four Brown Special biplanes and some TNCA made in Mexico. O'Neill reported to General Calles that most of the fleet available (13 airplanes in good condition and 5 in disrepair) had to be replaced since they were obsolete and worn away. Therefore, Mexico acquired some English Avro 504K and Avro 504J airplanes, which later would be made in Mexico with the name Avro An√°huac. In addition, in May 1920 Mexico acquired thirteen twin-engine bombers Farman F.50. Mexico purchases Farman F.50 bombers, 1920. - Smithsonian Institution Luis Farell graduated on April 24 of 1922 with the degree of Lieutenant and was initially assigned to the 'Observation and Bombing Squadron'. His lower scores were fencing and English language, while his higher scores were use of firearms and landings to the mark with obstructions. On January 11, 1925, he was commissioned to become a flight instructor and on May 24, 1926, he travelled to the United States to undergo a special aeronautics course in the military school located in Brooks Field, Texas. Rebellion of Adolfo de la Huerta On December 7 of 1923, ex-President Adolfo de la Huerta launched a military coup later called the delahuertista rebellion against the government of President Alvaro Obreg√≥n. The situation was extremely critical because along with de la Huerta, about sixty percent of the army revolted, including various high ranking Generals across Mexico. Mexico quickly reequipped and reorganized the military aviation and, with the help of the United States, it received new combat airplanes consisting of several de Havilland DH-4B with Liberty motor, armed with Lewis and Vickers machine guns and able to carry bombs. During December 10‚Äì21 of 1923, Farell‚Äôs squadron made explorations and bombings on San Marcos, Aguascalientes, San Carlos Fortress in Perote, Veracruz and Puente de Ixtla, Morelos. Then, Farell attacked enemy convoys in Iguala, Pachuca and intermediate locations in company of his friend Squadron Commander Roberto Fierro VIllalobos. On December 11, 1923, the important city of Puebla was taken by enemy forces and, eleven days later on December 22, and in company of pilot and artilleryman Lieutenant Guillermo Monroy, Farell bombed and machine-gunned the forts of Loreto, Guadalupe and San Ju√°n, as well as enemy positions in the city of Puebla. He later moved on to attack rebels operating in the southern states of Tabasco, Oaxaca and Chiapas, where their engine failed and crashed in the dense jungle; fortunately, they were unharmed. In a lucky turn of events Farell and Monroy were rescued by Mayan natives and brought to a nearby town. In January 1924, Farell began his duties in the north-western front against the Generals Enrique Estrada and Manuel Macario Di√©guez, who controlled most of Chihuahua, Jalisco, Guanajuato, Michoac√°n and Durango states. Luis Farell made explorations, strafing and bombings on enemy bases in the cities of P√©njamo, Yuriria and Morole√≥n in the state of Guanajuato; and in Michoac√°n, he attacked positions in the cities of Morelia, Panind√≠cuaro and intermediate points of opportunity. From January 14 to February 6, 1924, Luis Farell made several bombings and strafing as artilleryman of Colonel Ralph O'Neill on the state of Colima. On February 4 of 1924, Luis Farell was promoted to Squadron Commander of the First Squadron, Second Regiment and, on February 9, 1924, he took part in the critical battle of Ocotl√°n, in Jalisco,Ocotl√°n Battle (1924) a decisive and cruel battle in which Generals Joaqu√≠n Amaro and L√°zaro C√°rdenas lead 10,000 troops against the forces commanded by rebel General Salvador Alvarado. Since the Lerma River divided to the troops of both sides, the artillery and the Air Force were indispensable during the early hours of combat: At 07:00AM Farell's squadron flew the first of two missions, bombing and strafing the enemy until ran out of ammunition. After raising an improvised bridge, the federal forces won the battle and took several prisoners. Three days later, the federal forces easily recovered the city of Guadalajara, where Estrada's headquarter was based, but he managed to escape to Cuba, while and Di√©guez escaped to the south, where he was arrested and executed. On February 12, 1924, Farell mounted several attacks on the state of Colima, where was still some resistance. During the campaign in the northwest, Farell served under the orders of General Salinas, Colonel Ralph O‚ÄôNeill, Majors Rafael Montero Ramos, Rafael Ponce de Le√≥n and Alfredo Lezama √Ålvarez. Some fellow fliers were men like Alfonso Cruz Rivera, Roberto Fierro Villalobos, Pablo Sidar, Emilio Carranza, Eliseo Mart√≠n del Campo, Guillermo Monroy, Manuel Sol√≠s, Juli√°n Nava Salinas, Francisco Espejel, Alberto Vieytez, Ricardo D√≠az Gonz√°les and Lu√≠s Rojas, among others. For his valuable participation against the Adolfo de la Huerta coup, General L√°zaro Cardenas, who was present at his aerial attacks, promoted Luis Farell to the degree of Captain because of ‚Äúspecial merits during battle‚Äù. Predicting more insurrections, on January 11, 1925 Farell was assigned to take a flight instructor course and train new pilots. During 1926 and 1927, Mexico found itself immersed in a wave of violent territorial, religious and military armed rebellions, which required the Mexican Air Force to quickly deploy its forces and provide air support wherever the federal army requested them. Cristero War Alfredo Lezama Alvarez, Unknown pilot, Luis Farell; on the far right is Eliseo Mart√≠n del Campo. Mid-late 1920s. When President Plutarco El√≠as Calles pushed for the creation of the ‚ÄòMexican Apostolic Catholic Church‚Äô, independent of Rome, a conflict untied that, would unleash a widespread religious war known as the Cristero War. Luis Farell served in multiple missions in this war from 1926 to 1929 while flying combat missions mostly in the states of Jalisco, Guanajuato and Michoac√°n. During this long conflict, Farell flew alongside his friends Alfonso Cruz Rivera, Roberto Fierro and other airmen. The Yaqui Campaign Between 1926 and 1927 and while under the command of brigadier General Antonio Rios Zertuche, Major Roberto Fierro and Colonel Samuel Carlos Rojas, Luis Farell completed several missions against the Yaqui Indian rebels in the state of Sonora. Along with world-famous pilot Emilio Carranza, Farell flew several air-to-ground attacks over the Bacatete mountains of Sonora. It was during one of these missions that Emilio Carranza crashed and required of face reconstruction. During this campaign, Farell flew the airplanes de Havilland DH-4B # 2, 5, the Avro 504 # 59, 61, 65, 77, the Douglas O-2C # 1, 3 and the Lincoln biplane # 5. Several years after this campaign, Farell expressed to his family the moral difficulties of having battled against these indigenous people, whom demanded by the force that previous territorial treaties were implemented. Rebellion by General Arnulfo Gomez Alfredo Lezama Alvarez, Unknown, Manuel Sol√≠s; the seventh is Roberto Fierro. In May 1927, while General Obreg√≥n seemed keen to impose the presidency for second time to General Calles, Arnulfo R. G√≥mez launched an armed rebellion against both Obreg√≥n and Calles, as reelection has always been unconstitutional in Mexico. His command posts were located in the cities of Puebla and Veracruz, where he brought about 2000 very well armed federal deserters. Once the Mexican Air Force was revamped, Farell was assigned a squadron and, from October 6‚Äì11 he flew 7 consecutive missions in Veracruz, helping the army defeat Arnulfo Gomez's forces. Wasting no time, Farell‚Äôs squadron was assigned to return west and renew attacks against the Cristeros in the states of Jalisco, Guanajuato and Michoac√°n, as the Cristeros' numbers had increased to an estimated 15,000. Rebellion by General Jos√© Gonzalo Escobar While Farell was flight-testing a new Mexican aircraft called Baja California-1 on March 3 of 1929 a serious military coup took place, led by General Jos√© Gonzalo Escobar and heeded by various Generals. In these days, the air force's remaining airplanes consisted of worn and shot Bristol F.2 Fighter, Bristol Boarhound, de Havilland DH-4B and Douglas O-2C, a force that was not suitable to defeat Escobar's power.The Azcarate Corsair, by Hector Davila CornejoLos Corsarios Mexicanos, by H√©ctor D√°vila C. In this context, the government of Mexico convinced the USA to promote the peace south of its border and quickly make available twelve new OU-2M Corsair with the 400 hp Wasp engine, nine Douglas O-2M, four Stearman C3B and six Waco 10. Only two weeks after making the request, the USA government agreed and Farell and other pilots travelled to Brownsville, Texas and New York City to pick up the new aircraft. It is recorded that Luis Farell flew a total of 52 combat hours over the states of Nuevo Le√≥n, Coahuila, Durango and Chihuahua, when he was wounded by a bullet. On March 19, 1929, while in company of Lieutenant Colonel Pablo Sidar, Roberto Fierro, Ismael Aduna, Luis Boyer, Arturo Jim√©nez Nieto, Antonio C√°rdenas Rodr√≠guez, Carlos Rovirosa, Rodolfo Torres Rico and Gustavo Le√≥n, Luis Farell attacked enemy positions in Benavides, Coahuila and the following five days, from 20 - 25 of March, he bombed telegraph lines, bridges, locomotives and the railroad out of the city of Jim√©nez, Chihuahua in order to cut the enemy‚Äôs escape and communications. Finally, on March 25, 1929 Farell‚Äôs squadron attacked Escobar‚Äôs operation centers in the cities of Escalon and Jim√©nez, and while making a low altitude strafing run with a WACO aircraft, he was shot in both legs. The battle for the city of Jim√©nez was immediately reported by telegram to the President by the Lieutenant Colonel Rodolfo Tostado Loaiza, a ‚ÄòHead of Presidential Guard‚Äô monitoring the campaign: A detailed report was made the following day and it reveals that in fact, Luis Farell piloted the airplane and the artilleryman was Captain Ismael Aduna. Farell was able to return to his base and land safely. Once the bleeding was controlled, he was flown to the Hospital Franc√©s in Mexico City, where Erasmo Gonz√°lez Ancira, a military physician, reported that the projectile entered his left calf, fragmented 12 cm of the fibula bone and passed only 2 cm from the femoral artery of his right thigh. Three days after Farell was shot, Escobar was defeated by General Calles in Jim√©nez City, where he took about 6000 prisoners.External links to the battle at Jim√©nez, Chihuahua on 1929: , , This rebellion was quite serious, since a third of the officials and nearly 30,000 soldiers rebelled; In two months, more than 2000 men were killed. Because of his actions in battle, on April 5 of 1929, Farell he was promoted to Major for having flown hundreds of missions and for having engaged the enemy in battle at least 50 times. In addition, the President appointed him to the Estado Mayor Presidencial, a prominent Presidential Guard staff. A few days after leaving the hospital, on June 21. 1929, Luis Farell married Miss Ana Samaniego Castillo, and on August 12, the President presented him with a Waco model 10 biplane. After the Revolution Luis Farell taking friends on a joyride on his WACO-10, a present from the President. In 1932, Farell served in the First and Second Air Regiments flying the Chance-Vought Corsair O2U-2M, Corsair O2U-4A, Douglas O-2M and the Bristol Fighters. Then, Farell was appointed as Chief of the Civil Aviation Department and proceeded to head a committee to upgrade civil aviation policies and procedures. On January 1, 1934, the newly elected President L√°zaro C√°rdenas again appointed him as 'Jefe del Estado Mayor Presidencial' and in November 1934, was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel of the Air Force. During 1935, he was in charge of the Military Aeronautics Department and in 1936, he was appointed as Director of the Military School of Aviation, a charge that he performed until October 1945. In May 1938, the Governor of San Luis Potosi, General Saturnino Cedillo, declared himself in rebellion against Cardenas‚Äô government and, President C√°rdenas travelled to San Luis Potosi to personally mount the campaign against the revolt. Luis Farell and an old friend, Coronel Alfredo Lezama √Ålvarez, organized a mixed fleet of 17 aircraft and flew several missions, engaging the enemy assertively when spotted. Cedillo quickly realized he had no chance in open fields against the air force and ran to the Huasteca hills, where his men dispersed abandoning him.Time magazine. June 6, 1938. During this confrontation, Farell flew the new V-99M Corsairs which had the capacity to carry bombs and were equipped with the 550 hp Pratt & Whitney R-1340-T1H-1 Wasp engine and two Colt 0.30 machine guns, one fixed at the front and one for the artilleryman. He also flew the Fleet 21-M biplanes. Cedillo was shot by ground federal forces in 1939. During World War II, Mexico received a large number of aircraft to patrol the Gulf of Mexico coast against German submarines and Luis Farell coordinated the pilot training.Some aircraft types received by Mexico during WWII were: Vought-Sikorsky Kingfisher, North American AT-6, Douglas A-24B and Beech AT-11. Farell also formed part in the officials' selection to comprise the Mexican Escuadron 201 which saw action in Philippines during 1945. Farell was promoted to colonel in January 1939 and to brigadier general in February 1944. In 1946, he was assigned to direct the Military Personnel Department. In 1955, Farell was awarded the \\"Cruz de Guerra\\" medal along with fellow pilots Gustavo Le√≥n Gonz√°lez, Alfonso Cruz Rivera and David J. Borja Guajardo. In 1959, Guatemala President Miguel Yd√≠goras Fuentes ordered his P-51 Mustangs to attack five Mexican fishing vessels in contested waters. Soon after that incident, Roberto Fierro and Luis Farell were appointed Chief and Sub-Chief of the Mexican Air Force, respectively. At this time, Mexico had no natural enemies and was dedicated to industrial growth, not to a military buildup. The conflict was resolved with diplomacy. Farell and Fierro concluded that the Mexican Air Force could not confront the powerful P-51 Mustang aircraft if required again, so they purchased a Canadian fleet of Vampire MK-3 jets made available by the USA, and Lockheed T-33 jets from the USA. Farell applied himself at establishing a system that would never leave Mexico in such vulnerable position again ‚Äî a difficult task given the limited budget available. Farell retired from active service in August 1965 with the rank of division general. He died in Mexico City on July 17, 1977, at age of 74. He left behind his wife Ana and four sons: Jaime, Guillermo, Bernardo and Luis.

The company was founded by Marvin and Helene Gralnick and is headquartered in Fort Myers, Florida. Chico's FAS operates four brands: its namesake Chico's store, White House Black Market, Soma and TellTale. As of October 2019, Chico's FAS operated 1,376 women's clothing stores in the US and Canada, and sold merchandise online. Merchandise was also sold through franchise locations in Mexico and U.S. airport locations. History = 1972‚Äì1990 = Founders Marvin and Helene Gralnick met in 1972 while living in Guadalajara, Mexico. In 1983, they opened a tiny Mexican folk art gift shop in Periwinkle Place on Sanibel Island, Florida. Helene named the shop Folk Art Specialties and then changed the name to Chico's Folk Art Specialties after a friend's pet parrot, Chico. The store sold mostly art, but the sweaters in the store outsold everything else, so Chico's Folk Art Specialties transformed into a clothing boutique. In 1985, Chico's Folk Art Specialties opened a second boutique on Captiva Island, Florida. All early boutiques were infused with Mexican folk art combined with antiques and fixtures manufactured in Marvin's in-house woodshop. In the beginning, Marvin and Helene would not close the store until they reached a certain amount of sales each day. They also could not afford to have bags printed, so the name was handwritten on each bag. The first franchise store opened in Edina, Minnesota, in 1987. In 1989, the company shortened its name to Chico's FAS (an abbreviation for Folk Art Specialties) and launched the Passport Loyalty Rewards program. = 1991‚Äì2000 = By 1992, the company operated 60 boutiques and began designing its own prints and patterns. Chico's FAS went public in 1993 and began trading on NASDAQ under the title CHCS. It premiered its Most Amazing Personal Service (MAPS) customer service initiative in 1998, which still remains as part of the company's focus as of 2018. Between 1998 and 2000, Chico's sales increased an average of 50 percent per year. In 1999, Chico's FAS began online sales at Chicos.com. It also began advertising in national magazines, including Martha Stewart Living and Marie Claire. = 2001‚Äì2010 = In 2001, the Chico's FAS Founders building opened in Fort Myers, Florida, and Chico's FAS debuted on the New York Stock Exchange. Chico's FAS aired its first commercial in six major markets on The Today Show, Good Morning America, The Oprah Winfrey Show, and Martha Stewart Living. Average new store sales reached $1.45 million per year in 2003. The next year, Chico's FAS acquired White House Black Market, a women's clothing company that focuses on white, black, and other variants of the two colors. Chico's FAS also launched Soma, an intimate apparel boutique. In 2006, Chico's FAS added 24 acres to the Fort Myers campus to support growth, and stock reached a high of $49.40. = 2011‚Äìpresent = In 2011, Chico's FAS acquired Boston Proper, which is a brand available online or by catalog. Two years later, Boston Proper opened its first boutique at Coconut Point in Estero, Florida. In 2013, Chico's FAS expanded internationally by opening White House Black Market stores in Canada. On May 13, 2014, Chico's FAS announced expansion of the Chico's brand into Canada. Three boutiques have since opened in Canada. Further international expansion has occurred with its namesake Chico's into Mexico in 2014. Through an exclusive franchise with El Puerto de Liverpool (\\"Liverpool\\"), Chico's opened a stand-alone boutique at Perisur Mall, Mexico City. Plans for further Chico's expansion into Mexico include more openings of stand-alone boutiques as well as branded shop-in-shops in Liverpool department stores. In 2016, Chico's FAS sold Boston Proper to Brentwood Associates, an investment firm in Los Angeles. In 2017, the company launched its first online outlet store, Chico‚Äôs Off The Rack. Also in 2017, the company Chico's¬Æ began selling on cruise ships through Princess Cruises and Starboard Cruise Services. In 2019, Chico‚Äôs announced it was opening airport stores in partnership with airport retailer operator Stellar Partnerships. The company also started selling online through Amazon and ShopRunner.

Today, Chico's primarily sells private branded clothing for women. The brand has its own unique sizing that runs from 000-4. =White House Black Market= The White House Black Market brand began in 1985 in Baltimore, Maryland, and was acquired by Chico's FAS in 2003. It primarily offers exclusively designed, private label women's clothing and accessory items with a \\"boutique feel\\". Accessory items range from shoes to scarves to jewelry and belts. The focus of each seasonal assortment ranges from everyday basics, to wear-to-work, to fashion in monochromatic black, white, and related shades with \\"seasonal color splashes\\". =Soma= Soma was launched by Chico's FAS in 2004. The brand primarily sells lingerie and sleepwear. The brand also offers dresses, loungewear, swimwear and shapewear. In 2019, Soma introduced its SOMAINNOFIT Bluetooth-connected bra.

He is largely credited with developing their choreography onstage, and co-wrote many songs with Paul Stanley, including \\"Mr. Speed\\", \\"Makin' Love\\", and \\"Take Me\\" from the 1976 album Rock and Roll Over, and \\"All American Man\\" from the studio side of the 1977 album Alive II. He also co- wrote the song \\"Rocket Ride\\" with Ace Frehley for the same album, a song that remained a staple of Frehley's live set throughout his solo career and was used as the title of his 2008 tour. He simultaneously produced and co-wrote songs for Gene Simmons' and Peter Criss' 1978 self-titled solo albums. He's co-written songs with each original member of KISS. He is often referred to by fans and those close to the band as \\"the fifth member of KISS.\\"  Early life  Born and raised in Tempe, Arizona, his family moved all around the country. His father, after whom he was named, built a little league field in Cranberry, New Jersey that was named Delaney Field. He attended Pleasant Grove High School. He joined the 101st Airborne and left for the east coast by the late 1960s. Delaney had established himself as the lead singer of several unsuccessful groups in the New York City area. One such group, \\"Sean Delaney and Trust\\" signed a recording contract with Elektra Records. Another, a group called \\"Natural Juice,\\" was signed with Columbia Records after being discovered by Clive Davis. Delaney later formed a company, the \\"Music Department\\" with future KISS management Glickman/Marks associate Howard Marks. Delaney's close relationship with KISS manager Bill Aucoin (the two were room- mates, 1969-80) indubitably played a huge part in the early development of the band, as well as his association with Neil Bogart long before KISS or Casablanca Records were created. KISS According to Delaney, it was he who persuaded Bill Aucoin to go and see the band at the Hotel Diplomat: > Gene had sent us a phony press release and press packet. Listing all the > places they had been playing and 'Reviews' of their performances. All were > bogus. I remember laughing and telling Bill, 'If they have gone to this > extent to get our attention, let's go see them.' And we did. The date was August 10, 1973. Following that first experience, the band performed a private showcase at La Tang Studios for Delaney, with Neil Bogart (future Casablanca records president), Bill Aucoin (future KISS manager) and Joyce Biawitz (also a future KISS manager). Delaney's recollection of the evening tells the story: > I thought it was absolutely the worst thing that could hit, I mean worst. It > was so unlike anything that it had to be incredible. It was new, it was > something that wasn't being done. ... So try to imagine, in a small > rehearsal studio, four guys are up there playing. In front of them are Bill, > Neil, Joyce, and myself. They finished the first song and no applause. Gene > (Simmons) walks down to Neil Bogart, grabs both of his hands, and makes him > applaud ... and Neil started applauding because he was scared to death. And > I said to myself at that moment, \\"This I wanna be involved in\\" ... because > that's the kind of balls you have to have to do anything. For most of Delaney's tenure with KISS, he acted in various capacities behind the scenes while the band was on tour. Part choreographer, part roadie and part driver would have been an accurate description for Delaney's job before KISS became widely commercially successful. In the early days, he coached the band as to how to move onstage with the makeup and costumes on, including several signature moves (such as the swaying guitar moves at the end of \\"Deuce\\") that have been a staple of the live set for over 40 years. After the band became a worldwide success, he was afforded several opportunities to produce up-and-coming bands, including Billy Squier's first band Piper in 1977, but perhaps his most well known production credit is for Gene Simmons' 1978 self-titled solo album. He also produced KISS' first greatest hits compilation Double Platinum, also released in 1978, which included a brand-new version of the KISS classic \\"Strutter,\\" dubbed \\"Strutter '78\\". Songwriting with KISS He was also given the opportunity in 1976 and 1977 to co-write several songs with members of the band, who were now far too busy to keep up with songwriting at the clip they had previously been used to. As mentioned before, the full list of the songs he contributed to the group were: *\\"Take Me\\" (Stanley/Delaney) from the album Rock and Roll Over. *\\"Mr. Speed\\" (Stanley/Delaney) from the album Rock and Roll Over. *\\"Makin' Love\\" (Stanley/Delaney) from the album Rock and Roll Over. *\\"All American Man\\" (Stanley/Delaney) from the album Alive II. *\\"Rocket Ride\\" (Frehley/Delaney) from the album Alive II. Delaney has also claimed to have co-written the KISS songs \\"Love Gun\\", \\"I Want You\\" and \\"Rock Bottom\\", although without receiving credit. Gene Simmons Delaney was brought in to produce Gene Simmons' album in 1978. In Gene's case, Delaney was asked at the outset to produce the album, and even had a co-writing credit with the song \\"Living In Sin,\\" featuring notable luminaries Cher and Bob Seger on backup vocals. A big part of the production process was indubitably coordinating schedules between the many notable guest appearances on the album. In addition to the aforementioned stars, Joe Perry, Rick Nielsen, and Donna Summer all appeared on the album among many others. Peter Criss Delaney was asked while producing Simmons' solo album to also contribute to Criss' solo venture. Criss was involved in a car accident around this time, and because of this and other behind-the-scenes distractions,he was incapable of getting any new original material together. After delving into the back catalogs of former bands Lips and Chelsea for any remaining material he and Stan Penridge had written, and after sprinkling in a couple of covers, the drummer found himself still short of a full album. Knowing that Delaney had songs that would suit the album, Neil Bogart insisted that Delaney write songs for the album and help Criss see it through to the end of the process. Delaney was initially reluctant because of his involvement with Simmons' album, but Bogart used the solo album Delaney himself was planning on doing as leverage to pressure him into doing it, as Casablanca was slated to be the record label he would ultimately release it on. Delaney wrote \\"I Can't Stop The Rain\\" and \\"Rock Me, Baby\\" off of Criss' solo album, both of which he also shares production credit for; those two songs and \\"Easy Thing\\" (written by Criss/Penridge) were co-produced by Vini Poncia/Peter Criss/Sean Delaney. The fact that Delaney worked on both albums is remarkable, as all four albums were allegedly closely guarded against each other by each KISS member and KISS management, with no other member's (or any individual associated with any of the other four solos) involvement or input. Simmons granted Delaney special dispensation to work on Criss' album, knowing how critical it was for all four to be completed in a timely fashion. Solo career Delaney released one solo album in early January 1979, entitled Highway. It features eight original tracks written by Delaney and a cover of the Smokey Robinson song \\"You Beat Me to the Punch.\\" It is dedicated to Gui (Bill Aucoin) and the four original members of KISS and has some of the same sessions musicians used on Peter Criss' solo album, including Allen Schwartzberg, who served as the session drummer for Peter Criss while he was recovering from a car accident. Luther Vandross also makes a guest appearance on the LP. The song \\"Spotlights (And Lonely Nights)\\" was originally intended to be released by Peter Criss on his 1978 solo album and a recording with him singing was done. However, even after a co-writing credit was negotiated by Casablanca it was determined that the song was too dark and unsuitable for a KISS-related release. Sean essentially replaced Peter's vocal with his own. Skatt Bros. After releasing the solo album, Delaney formed a band in 1979 called Skatt Bros. The band was composed of Delaney on keyboards, Pieter Sweval on bass (a member of Starz and Looking Glass), Richard Martin-Ross on guitar, David Andez on guitar, Richie Fontana on Drums and Guitar ( a member of Piper and boyfriend of Peter Criss's ex-wife Lydia) and Craig Krampf on drums. This lineup underwent a slight alteration shortly after forming in which Krampf and Andez left, and guitarist Danny Brant joined. Delaney had known Fontana from when he had produced the band Piper, who had opened for KISS on the 1977 Love Gun tour. The band released two albums: Strange Spirits (Casablanca, 1979) and Rico And The Ravens (Mercury, 1981). The second album was only released in Australia, on the strength of the band's popularity there. In support of the first album, a hilarious Village People inspired video for \\"Life At The Outpost\\" was filmed, created by their record company (Polygram Records in Australia), using actors to appear in the video. The members of The Skatt Bros do not appear in the video. The band also released a \\"sledgehammer version\\"Richie Fontana: Biography, Part 2 cover of Elvis' \\"Don't Be Cruel\\" (Casablanca NB-2258), backed with \\"Dancin' For the Man,\\" as a single before disbanding in 1981. Other artists Delaney worked with artists other than KISS as the 1970s progressed, notably acts managed by Bill Aucoin. He co- wrote \\"(She's Just A) Fallen Angel\\" and \\"Monkey Business\\" on the debut Starz album produced by Jack Douglas. This band included Peter Sweval on bass (previously with Looking Glass ), with whom Delaney would work in the Skatt Bros. \\"Sing It, Shout It\\" appeared on Starz's second album Violation. Delaney co-produced Piper's second album, Can't Wait (A&M; Records SP-4654) with Chris Kimsey. Released in 1977 Piper was a band that included Billy Squier. The band included Richie Fontana who later became the drummer in the Skatt Bros. Delaney produced the self-titled RCA debut album for Toby Beau (also in the Aucoin Management stable) which resulted in the hit single \\"My Angel Baby\\". Released in May 1978, Delaney also co-wrote \\"Broken Down Cowboy,\\" \\"California,\\" \\"Moonshine,\\" \\"Wink Of An Eye,\\" and \\"Bulldog\\" for the album. Delaney's song \\"Dreams\\" was recorded by Jefferson Airplane vocalist Grace Slick as the title track of her 1980 album. The recording featured Ron Frangipane who had composed the sinister intro to the song \\"Radioactive\\" on Gene Simmons' 1978 solo album. In 1984, Delaney spent a brief time with The Nylons, a Canadian a cappella group. He was their front-of-house sound engineer while they were touring their self-titled debut album. In the early 2000s Delaney managed the English country act, Smith & Jackson, he met them while they were on the \\"Country Thunder USA Tour\\" in 2002 after the tour Delaney moved to Sunderland in the northeast of England and wrote numerous songs with the pair and assisted in the recordings of their album Rivertown, on R.G.F Records. The Jackson half of the act was Paul Jackson, a one-time vocalist with original Def Leppard guitarist Pete Willis' band Roadhouse. Delaney's death impacted the band who had to start from scratch in their search for a recording deal. The band split shortly after Delaney's death. A while after Sean's untimely death, Bill Aucoin flew Paul Jackson to Nashville to meet and work with multi-hit songwriter KOSTAS. They remain good friends and songwriting partners to this day. Death Delaney died on April 13, 2003. A diabetic, Delaney had suffered a series of strokes before his death. Lydia Criss and Bill Aucoin were among those who attended his funeral. Delaney died in Utah and is buried in the city of Orem. On the bottom of the tombstone read the names of Gene, Paul, Ace, and Peter. Delaney started working on his biography in 1997 and initially titled it \\"SeanSStory.\\" By 1998 Delaney had changed the title to \\"Sean Delaney, The Fifth KISS.\\" He suggested that he brought in an investigative reporter to conduct comparative interviews with the cast of characters in the early years to validate his stories. By December 2001, Delaney had essentially completed work on the book and was in active discussions for publication. By 2002 the title had been changed to \\"Sean Delaney's Hell Box.\\" What was eventually published posthumously was a sparse 118-page work, which was Delaney's work completed by Bryan J. Kinnaird. It was vanity published via Xlibris in 2004.

The uprising took place in the Soviet-occupied Polish town of Czortk√≥w (now Chortkiv, Ukraine) during World War II. The insurgents attempted to storm the local Red Army barracks and a prison in order to release Polish soldiers incarcerated there. The attack occurred on the night of January 21-22, 1940. It was the first Polish civilian uprising against the Nazi-Soviet occupation of Poland. Background On 17 September 1939 the Red Army allied with Nazi Germany (see: Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact), invaded the eastern part of Poland. The Soviets advanced quickly, as the bulk of the Polish Army was concentrated in the west, fighting the Wehrmacht. According to the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact, Poland was to be divided by the two allied powers. The Germans occupied the western part of the country, while the Soviets annexed eastern Poland (see: Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union), including the town of Czortk√≥w, seat of a powiat (population 20,000), located in prewar Tarnopol Voivodeship. Between 1939 and the 1941 Operation Barbarossa, the Soviet NKVD arrested and imprisoned about 500,000 Poles including state officials, civil servants, uniformed officers and scores of the so-called \\"enemies of the people\\" such as food producers, engineers, merchants and the clergy. About 65,000 Poles in all were secretly executed. Soon after Czortk√≥w‚Äôs annexation into the Ukrainian SSR, the new rulers began a campaign of repressions. The Polish inhabitants of Czortk√≥w (in 1931 ethnic Poles made up 46.4% of the town's population) organized themselves against the Soviets as early as October 1939, when a conspirational organization Stronnictwo Narodowe (National Alliance) was created.Tadeusz A.

Niedziela.pl Its purpose was to fight the occupier and carry out sabotage.IPN.Gov.pl Soon afterwards, the founders of the organization, mostly students from the local high school including Tadeusz Bankowski, Henryk Kami≈Ñski, Heweliusz Malawski, and their teacher J√≥zef Opacki, decided to organize an uprising. The night of the attack In December 1939, a large contingent of the Red Army troops from the garrison in Czortk√≥w left town to fight in the Winter War against Finland. The conspirators noticed it and saw their chance of success. They planned to make a surprise attack on the barracks and liberate the local prison in which officers of the Polish Army were kept, and take over the post office, hospital and the railway station. The plotters wanted to seize a train with the anticipated help from the already freed Polish officers, and travel to nearby Romania via Zaleszczyki. To delay the Soviet pursuit, they also planned to blow up the rail bridge on the Seret. The conspirators decided to start the uprising on the night of January 21/22, 1940, the anniversary of the outbreak of the 1863 January Uprising. In the evening of January 21, between 100 and 250 people gathered in Czortk√≥w‚Äôs Roman Catholic Dominican Church. Most of them were not armed, only a few had guns or knives, some even old-fashioned swords. They divided themselves into four groupsthe first was going to seize the main barracks, the secondthe prison, the thirdthe center of town, and the fourththe railway station. The plotters agreed that their battle cry would be Z krzyzem (Along with the Cross). The attack on the Red Army barracks took place at 22:00, but the plotters underestimated the strength of the Soviets, and failed to capture the complex. Alarmed by the gunshots, the Red Army troops stormed out of the barracks and counterattacked. After a short gunfight, in which three Soviet soldiers and 14 Poles died and several were wounded, the plotters dispersed. Aftermath On the next day, 22 January, the NKVD secret police troops began mass arrests of suspected participants in the uprising. Altogether, they incarcerated some 150 Poles. Twenty four students were brutally interrogated by the NKVD and tortured. Historian Jan Tomasz Gross writes that the plotters were beaten with wooden poles, handguns, bottles and metal bars, and \\"kicked until their jaws and ribs were broken.\\"Gross, Jan Tomasz (2002), Revolution from Abroad. Books.Google.com p. 172. Fifty five men were sentenced to exile in Siberia. Almost all of those murdered or expelled were male teenagers of Polish nationality from Czortkow. Also, officers of the Polish Army, kept in Czortkow prison, were among those murdered in the Katyn massacre later on. Eighteen months later on 2 July 1941, just before attack of the Wehrmacht, the Soviets secretly executed eight Dominican friars from the Roman Catholic Church in the town. According to some witnesses, this was in revenge for Dominican help with the uprising. W≈Çadys≈Çaw Buczkowski, a witness to the uprising, wrote in his memoirs that even though he did not take part in the revolt, he was arrested on January 27 and, after torture, was sent to prison in Tarnopol. Sentenced to 15 years, together with other Poles from Czortk√≥w, he was taken to Kharkiv and later sent to Siberia. Buczkowski was among the few who survived, and in 1942, due to the Sikorski- Mayski Agreement, he managed to escape from the Soviet Union.R. Antoszewski, Czortk√≥w w latach II wojny ≈õwiatowej.

Rev. Dr. Hampden Coit DuBose was the son of Rev. Julius Jesse DuBose and Margaret Eliza Thompson, married Pauline McAlpine, daughter of Augustine Irving McAlpine and Martha Clisby and had seven children with her. Career Map showing the amount of Opium produced in China in 1908 DuBose was born in South Carolina and a graduated from Columbia Theological Seminary. He and his wife Pauline went to China as missionaries with the Southern Presbyterian Church in 1872 and settled in Suzhou along the Grand Canal of China. His Chinese name is Du Buxi ÊùúÊ≠•Ë•ø.See Bodleian Library, Sinica 6470. As a witness of the destructive problems of opium addiction in China, he was moved to join with other likeminded missionaries and Christian medical workers to form the Anti-Opium League in China. DuBose was its first president. In 1899 the League published a seminal book called Opinions of Over 100 Physicians on the Use of Opium in China. The book illustrated the purpose of the league and published facts about the opium abuse crisis that ultimately influenced public opinion against the trade. DuBose eventually gained the support of U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt, the U.S. Congress, and the International Opium Commission. In 1906 the League achieved success when the British Parliament declared that the trade was \\"morally indefensible.\\" DuBose circulated a petition signed by over a thousand missionaries in China and it was presented to the Guangxu Emperor. In turn the Emperor issued an imperial edict, following verbatim the petition Dubose had drafted, which prohibited the trade and abuse of opium. In a letter to U.S. Senator John McLaurin he called upon the U.S. to own its responsibility for the opium trade, in that, along with Great Britain it had profited at the expense of the Chinese. He asserted: DuBose was memorialized in Suzhou by a stone tablet and in the United States by being elected moderator of the General Assembly of the Southern Presbyterian Church in 1891. DuBose's missionary career in Suzhou lasted 38 years until his death in 1910.

Special events include educational film-related workshops, panels, and Master Classes; kid- friendly activities; live local music; nightly after-parties; and special badge-holders-only receptions. An awards brunch on the Sunday of the festival culminates in awards and other prizes being given to winning films and filmmakers. Workshops, parties, and receptions are typically held at various locations, including Millsaps College, local clubs and restaurants, and the Mississippi Museum of Art. Founded in 1999, the 501(c)(3) nonprofit Crossroads Film Society is a membership organization created to promote, highlight, and grow independent film and filmmaking in the Deep South, especially among female and young filmmakers, filmmakers of color, members of the LGBTQ+ community, and indigenous filmmakers. The mission of Crossroads Film Society is to celebrate the art of filmmaking in all of its diversity and depth; showcase and promote a broader spectrum of film and video for the community; present and honor film related to Mississippi and the South; and provide educational opportunities and forums of discussion for film lovers and aspiring filmmakers. Naming The Crossroads Film Festival was named in part for the widely known area of Mississippi where Robert Johnson was said to have sold his soul to the devil. It is also a reference to hometown Jackson's role as a metropolitan hub of the New South.

Both the play and the film were produced by David Belasco. The film stars Hope Hampton, Wyndham Standing, and Louise Fazenda. It was also the (uncredited) film debut of Louise Beavers. The story of The Gold Diggers was filmed again as a talkie in 1929 as Gold Diggers of Broadway, which is now lost, and also in 1933 as Gold Diggers of 1933, with musical numbers created by Busby Berkeley. Three other sequels followed: Gold Diggers of 1935 (1935), Gold Diggers of 1937 (1936), and Gold Diggers in Paris (1938). Plot Wally Saunders (Johnny Harron) wants to marry chorus girl Violet Dayne (Anne Cornwall), but his uncle, Stephen Lee (Wyndham Standing) thinks that all chorines are gold diggers (people who date others to get money from them) and refuses to give his approval. Violet's friend Jerry La Mar (Hope Hampton) is not a gold digger, but she agrees to go after Lee so aggressively that Violet will look tame by comparison. Of course, the uncle and the friend fall in love and get married, even after he knows the truth about her, and he gives permission for Wally and Violet to get hitched too.

His particularly notable musical associations have been with the Cameo Blues Band, The Lincolns, Richard \\"Hock\\" Walsh and Alannah Myles. Biography Markman began playing guitar at age 12, learning from his sister, Mirel. He remembers the folky influence she had on him and to this day is jokingly quoted as saying: \\"D, A7 and G, the only chords you'll ever need.\\" Over the next 15 years, Markman toured and recorded with the Max Band and Dandy Batt. His single, \\"The Flying Dutchman\\", became a cult favourite. In 1977 he moved to Toronto to work at the second location of Steve's Music Store and left performing for a while. He was coaxed out of 'retirement' by Bob Segarini and left Steve's Music in 1981 to devote himself entirely to music, playing guitar for Marghie Evans and Pamela Cannon, and numerous jobbing gigs, TV shows and sessions. Markman joined the Cameo Blues Band with Malcolm Tomlinson in 1982 and later toured with The Lincolns, opening for the late Robert Palmer. Markman returned to Toronto and played with the Alannah Myles Band, Tom Barlow and the late Richard \\"Hock\\" Walsh. On special occasions, Markman has also performed with legends Dan Aykroyd and the late Jeff Healey. His recording credits include Rosenshontz (It's The Truth), Michael Vincent (Home in the Forest), Tapestry (I Need Your Lovin') and Ron Wiseman (Mystical Mood). In 1991, Markman returned to Steve's Music and continued playing with the Gerry Markman Band, the French Connection and Curley Bridges. He led the Ruanne's House Band in Barrie, hosting dozens of Ontario's finest musicians as guests and twice was musical director for the Barrie Music Awards. He became the driving force of the rockin' blues band the Sensations, based out of Orillia, Ontario. Markman still plays with the Sensations, Malcolm Tomlinson and occasionally The Partland Brothers. He still does sessions and also performs as a solo acoustic artist. Markman recently played with Jimmy Hall, former lead singer of Wet Willie. Markman was profiled in the January 2008 issue of CMT (Canada Music Trades) magazine. Markman is the uncle of the hurdy-gurdy artist Ben Grossman.

DeCavalcante family  A reputed drug dealer in the Northern New Jersey area, US law enforcement reportedly associated Polizzi with the DeCavalcante crime family in the late 1950s, and later ranked him as a soldier for reputed Boss Nicholas \\"Nick\\" Delmore, in Sam DeCavalcante's crew. Involved in loansharking, extortion, illegal gambling and especially narcotics activities, Polizzi continued to operate in the Newark faction of the family throughout the 1960s, but as Sam DeCavalcante took over the family in 1965, Polizzi was passed over of being promoted, as Giovanni \\"John the Eagle\\" Riggi was made captain of DeCavalcante's crew. Later, DeCavalcante was indicted with over 50 of his associates, including Polizzi, and sentenced to five years in prison, however, with his release in the early 1970s, Riggi had taken over the family and DeCavalcante himself had relocated to Florida. Polizzi continued to operate only as a soldier.  Promoted  As Giovanni Riggi kept running the DeCavalcante family in the late 1970s, Polizzi was involved in large heroin and cocaine distribution and transportation operations. He continued to operate out of Newark, New Jersey with other members of the DeCavalcante crime family, in this case, Joseph Ganci. But in the early 1980s, as Riggi officially took over all of North Jersey, Polizzi was finally promoted to a respective captain in the Newark, New Jersey faction of the DeCavalcante crime family, and heavily involved in loansharking, extortion, illegal gambling and narcotics operations, which he oversaw from a pizza parlor, owned by his associate, Ganci.  The Pizza Connection Trial  But in early 1985, Polizzi was picked up by US law enforcement and put on trial for major involvement in heroin and cocaine operations. A main defendant in the infamous Pizza Connection Trial, Polizzi was charged with distribution and transportation of narcotics, in which Mafia bosses of both New York City and Sicily had cooperated in and brought drugs worth an amount of $1.6 billion into the United States between 1975 and 1984. According to Jerry Capeci; Polizzi's wife was on the witness stand trying to back her husband's claim that the bag the FBI saw him pick up from a cohort in June, 1983 contained fresh sardines, not money or heroin. Holding a bag she prepared at home that morning as a prop, Cecelia Polizzi testified that her husband had brought the fish home so she could fix a Sicilian specialty dish, pasta al sarde. The entire jury started laughing, saying it was hilarious. Polizzi was sentenced to 20 years for dealing drugs on March 2, 1987, along with all of his 21 co-defendants.  Prison  Sentenced to 20 years behind bars, Polizzi developed some sort of lung cancer in the early 1990s, and had it confirmed by doctors as he was transferred to the prison hospital. According to Jerry Capeci, the medical care didn't help, and gave him only six months left to live, in which the judge agreed to reduce Polizzi's sentence. After spending a total of eight years in prison on narcotics charges, Polizzi was released on April 3, 1995 from federal prison, however, he went right back to the DeCavalcante crime family.  Caporegime  After returning to Newark and his crew in the DeCavalcante family, Polizzi was let into the inner circle of the new regime. Giovanni Riggi had been imprisoned on extortion and racketeering charges in 1990 and sentenced to 15 years in prison, as well as several of their leaders had been murdered and disappeared, however, Polizzi continued to operate with prominent capos Giuseppe \\"Pino\\" Schifilliti and Vincent \\"Vinny Ocean\\" Palermo, including the current Acting boss Giacomo \\"Jake\\" Amari, but as he died of stomach cancer in 1997, everything changed.  The power vacuum  After Amari's death in 1997, a huge power vacuum was left with the DeCavalcante family, including both Elizabeth faction leaders Vincent Palermo and Girolamo \\"Jimmy\\" Palermo (no relation) and Newark faction leaders Polizzi and Charles \\"Big Ears\\" Majuri all attempting to restructure the family of North Jersey. However, using Stefano \\"Steve the Truck Driver\\" Vitabile, the family Consigliere, Riggi constructed the \\"Ruling Panel\\", consisting of both the Palermos with Majuri representing the Newark faction. This \\"Ruling Committee\\" continued to run the day-to-day activities of the family, although after Majuri became dissatisfied with the current leadership and put out a contract on Vincent Palermo's life, which failed to succeed, including Palermo organizing Majuri's murder, which also failed, Majuri and Polizzi of the Newark faction were cast out from the rest of the family of Elizabeth, where all the power was. However, Polizzi had great friendship with both Palermo and Vitabile, which made him trusted by the new family regime. In fact, he was so trusted that Polizzi was in on six assassination plots, all hatched by Palermo and Vitabile, although many didn't succeed.  Indictments  But as the DeCavalcante crime family finally had been slowing down the war of New Jersey, US law enforcement launched a massive attack with indictments on 40 members of the family, including Polizzi, on December 2, 1999. Every family captain was arrested and put on trial for labor and construction racketeering, drug trafficking, illegal gambling, extortion, loansharking, money laundering, fraud and murder and conspiracy charges, which led to three highly involved members turning informants, first soldier Anthony Capo, then captain Anthony Rotondo, and in the end, acting boss Vincent Palermo also agreed to turn state's evidence. Polizzi and the rest of the DeCavalcante family regime were put on trial for another more charges and placed in custody. UNITED STATES OF AMERICA vs Frank Polizzi  Death  However, as the US authorities had put 40 members, almost the entire DeCavalcante crime family, on trial in 2000, it took long time before the trials were even halfway completed. Polizzi by now was critically ill with cancer, and was frequently in the Medical Center for prisoners, and on Christmas Eve, 2001, seven years after his diagnosis, Polizzi died. If the convicted drug-dealer, who in 1999 conspired with DeCavalcante family leaders into kill three rival soldiers, including soldier turned informant Anthony Capo's wife and children, lived long enough through the trial, he would probably have been sentenced to life imprisonment along with his superiors.  Comparing  In later times, Frank Polizzi's battle against cancer has been compared to the death of Gambino crime family boss John Gotti, who died of cancer while serving 100 years in prison for federal racketeering and 13 murder charges.

Background The main event featured the return of UFC Heavyweight Champion Randy Couture versus WWE's Brock Lesnar in a title bout. The decision to grant Lesnar ‚Äì who was 1‚Äì1 in UFC fights at the time ‚Äì the title shot was controversial at the time. Some felt it was premature and marketing driven, while others argued the relative lack of depth in the heavyweight division at the time left no clear-cut contenders to the belt. Matthew Riddle was forced to withdraw from his bout with Ryan Thomas due to an injury. He was replaced by Matt Brown. Amir Sadollah withdrew from his fight against Nick Catone due to a leg infection. A replacement for Sadollah could not be found, therefore the middleweight bout was pulled from the card. A welterweight match between Dustin Hazelett and Tamdan McCrory, previously scheduled for the preliminary card, was moved to the main card. Unlike most UFC fight cards, every bout was aired on the PPV broadcast due to the quick endings of the main card bouts.

The card featured five televised MMA bouts, as well as five un-aired preliminary bouts. It was the second UFC event of 2009 and took place on the weekend of Super Bowl XLIII. The main event featured the UFC Welterweight Champion, Georges St-Pierre, defending his title against UFC Lightweight Champion and former UFC Welterweight Champion B.J. Penn. This represented the first time two current titleholders competed against each other in the UFC. The contest was heavily promoted, featuring a publicity tour to Canada and Hawaii, as well as the introduction of UFC Primetime, a preview show that cost $1.7 million to produce. The co-main event of the evening was a battle between two undefeated light heavyweights sporting 13‚Äì0 records in Lyoto Machida and Thiago Silva. Background The main event featured the UFC Welterweight Champion Georges St-Pierre defending his championship against UFC Lightweight Champion B.J. Penn in a fight contested at the UFC welterweight limit of 170 pounds (77.1 kg). The fight represented the first time two current title holders faced off in the UFC. Penn also sought to become the first fighter in the UFC to concurrently hold two championships in two separate weight classes. The UFC 94 main event was met with a high level of anticipation from both the media and the fans. Sherdog called the fight between St-Pierre and Penn the most anticipated bout of 2009, and NBC Sports described it as one of the most anticipated fights in MMA history. In an article previewing the fight, Dave Meltzer discussed the over-usage of exaggerations to promote contests in combat sports, but argued that the January 31 match between St-Pierre and Penn was \\"one of the true epic matches in the history of the sport.\\" The fans voiced their opinion in a poll conducted by Inside MMA, where 45 percent of the viewers voted the match up between St-Pierre and Penn as the most anticipated fight to take place between December and February. The poll also featured (in descending order according to the results) Fedor Emelianenko vs. Andrei Arlovski, Wanderlei Silva vs. Quinton Jackson, and Rich Franklin vs. Dan Henderson. St-Pierre is a fighter with very strong wrestling, and trains with the Canadian Olympic team. His conditioning, strength and athleticism have also been identified as strong attributes. He became the undisputed UFC Welterweight Champion by winning the interim-championship against Matt Hughes at UFC 79, and successfully unifying the championship against Welterweight title holder Matt Serra at UFC 83 in Quebec, St-Pierre's home province. St- Pierre's fight prior to the UFC 94 event was a successful title defense against Jon Fitch at UFC 87 via unanimous decision, where he won every round on the judge's scorecards. Penn is a fighter noted for his outstanding jiu- jitsu, as he is the first non-Brazilian to win the World Jiu-Jitsu Championship at the black belt level. His other notable strengths include boxing, and wrestling/takedown defense. Penn captured the vacant UFC Lightweight Championship by defeating Joe Stevenson at UFC 80. The belt was vacant as a result of the California State Athletic Commission stripping then- champion Sean Sherk of the title for testing positive for anabolic steroid Nandrolone, or more commonly known as Decadurabolin, following a title defense. Penn entered the UFC 94 fight following a successful title defense as well, with a 3rd-round TKO of former champion Sean Sherk at UFC 84. St-Pierre and Penn had fought once before in a welterweight number one contenders match at UFC 58 on March 4, 2006, where St-Pierre won in a very evenly matched contest by split decision. St-Pierre had defeated Penn in a previous bout; a split-decision at UFC 58. Promotion for the St-Pierre and Penn contest began in November 2008, with UFC President Dana White, and the two main event fighters embarking on publicity tours in Toronto, Ontario, Canada and Honolulu, Hawaii. The fighters answered various fan questions, and signed autographs. In an effort to further promote the contest, the UFC introduced UFC Primetime, a three-part series that cost $1.7 million to produce. UFC Primetime detailed the final preparations of St-Pierre and Penn's before their fight. Spike aired the half-hour episodes on the final three Wednesdays leading up to the fight, beginning on January 14, 2009 and concluding on January 28, 2009. Camera crews spent twenty five days with each fighter rather than the three days for a standard UFC Countdown preview show, and episodes aired shortly after they were filmed. The episodes were aired quickly to provide weekly updates on each fighter's current status. After the first episode aired, it was reported by MMAjunkie.com that B.J. Penn was unhappy with his portrayal in the program, and wanted to withdraw from the project. Penn made a subsequent appearance on TapouT radio to discuss this report and confirmed that he has taken issue with his portrayal on the show. He was adamant that he would not continue to allow filming unless his portrayal changed. In the end, UFC Primetime proved to be a ratings success, as it was announced by Spike that the program was the most watched UFC preview show ever, drawing 1.4 million viewers for its first episode (880,000 viewers for first airing and 614,000 viewers for an immediate repeat). The second episode averaged 825,000 viewers, while the third episode drew 662,000 viewers. The co-main event featured a bout between two top contenders and undefeated light heavyweights, Lyoto Machida and Thiago Silva. The two were originally scheduled to meet at UFC 89, but a back injury forced Silva to withdraw from the contest. UFC President Dana White indicated in the pre-fight press conference that Machida would receive a title shot with a victory, while Silva would need to defeat Machida and win one more contest before earning the same opportunity. Machida is a fighter who prefers to counter-strike, and combines Shotokan Karate, sumo wrestling and Brazilian jiu-jitsu to form his own style. Silva is a Brazilian jiu-jitsu black belt, but prefers to fight standing. Machida entered the UFC 94 fight following a unanimous decision victory over former UFC Light Heavyweight Champion Tito Ortiz at UFC 84, where he won every round on the judge's scorecards. Thiago Silva entered the contest with 1st- round TKOs over Antonio Mendes at UFC 84, and Houston Alexander at UFC 78. The event also featured the return of two more fighters from injury, in Karo Parisyan and Stephan Bonnar. Parisyan, a judo standout, had to withdraw from a scheduled fight against Yoshiyuki Yoshida at UFC 88 with a back injury just one day before the fight. His opponent for UFC 94 was undefeated South Korean welterweight Dong Hyun Kim. Bonnar, a light heavyweight, was to take on Matt Hamill at UFC Fight Night 13, but a left knee injury during training forced him out of that bout. His opponent, the 21-year-old Jon Jones was a national amateur wrestling champion and coming off a unanimous decision victory over Andre Gusm√£o at UFC 87, where he took the fight on three weeks notice. Rounding out the main card was a lightweight contest between the winner of the fifth season of the UFC's reality television series and MMA competition The Ultimate Fighter, Nate Diaz, and contender Clay Guida. The Ultimate Fighter is a single-elimination reality series featuring fledgling professional MMA fighters competing for the title of The Ultimate Fighter, and a six-figure, multi-fight contract with the UFC. Diaz is a Brazilian jiu-jitsu brown belt under Cesar Gracie, and Guida is noted by MMA journalist Sam Caplan as one of the UFC's most highly regarded fighters. The two were expected to fight in December 2008, but the fight failed to materialize due to a foot injury to Guida. Event 14,885 fans filled the MGM Grand Garden Arena to capacity to witness UFC 94 and the rematch between St-Pierre and Penn. The event consisted of ten mixed martial arts bouts all sanctioned by the Nevada State Athletic Commission and contested under the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts. All bouts consisted of three five-minute rounds except for the main-event championship match between St-Pierre and Penn which was five five-minute rounds. Five of the bouts were part of the non-televised preliminary card. The reported attendance was 14,885 with a total gate of $4,290,020. The UFC announced on January 14, 2009 that the event was completely sold out, however MMAjunkie.com noted that at the time of announcement, it was still possible to find single tickets. The reported buyrate of the pay-per-view was 800,000. =Preliminary card= The event's five preliminary fights all went the full three rounds, ending in decisions. In the first bout of the evening, Dan Cramer became the first fighter to be successful in a professional mixed martial arts debut at a UFC pay-per-view event since Marcio Cruz at UFC 55. In his fight with Matt Arroyo, Cramer executed a takedown and attempted punches on the ground while avoiding the Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu brown-belt's submissions during the first two rounds, while the third and final round saw Arroyo taking Cramer's back on the ground and unsuccessfully going for a rear naked choke. Two of the three judges scored the bout 29‚Äì28 for Cramer while the remaining third judge saw it 28‚Äì29 for Arroyo, giving Cramer the split-decision victory. In the second bout of the event, Jake O'Brien rebounded from two TKO losses in a row with a split-decision win over Christian Wellisch. O'Brien, a former wrestler at Purdue University, was able to take Wellisch down and control his opponent on the ground but was hurt on the feet in the first and second rounds. The judges saw it 29‚Äì28, 28‚Äì29 and 29‚Äì28 in favor of O'Brien. This was both fighters first fight at light heavyweight after dropping down from heavyweight. In one of the two bouts being awarded \\"Fight of the Night\\" bonuses, John Howard defeated Chris Wilson by split decision in their welterweight contest. Howard was able to take down Wilson in all three rounds where he scored with ground-and-pound and once went for a rear naked choke. Wilson had some success on his feet, but Howard landed the harder strikes. The contest was scored twice 29‚Äì28 for Howard and once 28‚Äì29 for Wilson. The only lightweight bout on the preliminary card saw Thiago Tavares defeating Manny Gamburyan by unanimous decision. Tavares went for ground-and-pound after takedowns, while the smaller Gamburyan tried to push the pace on the feet but was unable to counter Tavares' more powerful strikes. All three judges scored it 29‚Äì28 in favor of Tavares. In the last fight on the preliminary card, American Kickboxing Academy's Jon Fitch faced Akihiro Gono. The bout saw Fitch continually taking down Gono and landing with ground-and-pound punches on the downed opponent. Fitch came close to submitting Gono in the first and second rounds when he went for a rear naked choke and an armbar respectively, but he was unable to finish the Japanese fighter. All three judges scored the bout in favor of Fitch, two scoring it 30‚Äì27 with one judge seeing it 30‚Äì26 giving Fitch the unanimous decision victory. =Main card= All fights took place inside a cage, the UFC's Octagon. The first bout on the televised portion of the event saw Nate Diaz taking on Clay Guida in a lightweight contest. Diaz, who had an eight-inch reach advantage on Guida, was able to frustrate him with punches on the feet while Guida has success with leg-kicks followed by a right hand straight. After closing the distance, Guida used his wrestling experience to avoid submissions while controlling and pressuring Diaz both in the clinch and on the ground throughout the fight. Diaz rallied with punches in the final round but was unable to finish off Guida. The judges scored the bout 29‚Äì28 twice for Guida and once for Diaz for the split-decision victory. The bout was awarded the event's second \\"Fight of the Night\\" honor gaining both fighters a $65,000 bonus. The second bout saw two judo black belts fighting as Karo Parisyan went up against undefeated Dong Hyun Kim in a matchup at welterweight. Kim took Parisyan's back in the first round and threatened with submissions as Parisyan attempted to regain position, while the second round saw Parisyian executing a judo-throw and going for a kimura-submission. The final round was mostly spent in the clinch with both fighters getting takedowns. Parisyian was awarded a split-decision victory with the scores 29‚Äì28, 28‚Äì29 and 29‚Äì28. However, the result was later changed to a \\"no contest\\" after Parisyian tested positive for three banned painkillers in the post-fight drug test also resulting in a nine months suspension and $32,000 fine. Stephan Bonnar who returned to take on undefeated Jon Jones after just over a year absence. In only his second fight for the UFC, Jon Jones took on The Ultimate Fighter 1 runner-up Stephan Bonnar at light heavyweight in the third fight on the main card. Jones was able to execute multiple throws and takedowns during the first two rounds, at one point suplexing Bonnar. Jones also had the most success striking and was able to knock down his opponent with a spinning elbow-strike. Bonnar rallied with strikes against the tiring Jones in the third round, but the bout went the distance with the judges scoring it 29‚Äì28 once and 30‚Äì27 twice all in favor of Jones. The fourth fight featured two undefeated Brazilians meeting at light heavyweight in Lyoto Machida and Thiago Silva. Machida was able to knock down Silva twice during the first round before ultimately knocking him out after tripping him and jumping in landing the knockout punch at 4:59 of the first round. The finish marked the first win for Machida by knockout, and netted him a $65,000 bonus as it was awarded \\"Knockout of the Night\\". The fifth and final bout of the main card was the UFC Welterweight Championship match between Georges St- Pierre and B.J. Penn, regulated by referee Herb Dean. The bout started out with the two fighters clinching and throwing knees. St-Pierre dropped down for a single-leg takedown but Penn defended while standing on one leg with his back to the cage. Unable to get the takedown, St-Pierre let go and connected with a right hand punch. They met up and clinched in the middle of the cage with St-Pierre pushing Penn towards the fence. There, St-Pierre attempted a takedown but went back the clinch when he was unable to finish it. The two fighters continued trading punches to end the first round. Round two started with two fighters throwing strikes with St-Pierre landing a punch drawing blood from Penn's nose. St-Pierre then clinched up and tripped Penn to the ground. There Penn attempted to defend using the rubber guard, but St-Pierre passed to half-guard and eventually side-control while landing punches. The two continued grappling with Penn taking several ground-and-pound punches from St-Pierre until the round ended. The third and fourth rounds saw St-Pierre continue his ground-and-pound on a visibly discouraged Penn, and at the end of the fourth, Penn's corner motioned for the cage-side doctor to stop the fight. The referee waved off the contest, officially declaring St-Pierre the winner, retaining his UFC Welterweight Championship, by TKO due to \\"referee stoppage on doctor's advice\\". St-Pierre greasing controversy Cornerman Phil Nurse applying Vaseline to St-Pierre's face, and illegally touching his fighter's back. The contest between St-Pierre and Penn was a source of significant controversy. In between rounds one and two, as well as round three, one of St- Pierre's cornermen, Phil Nurse, was seen applying petroleum jelly (brand name Vaseline) on the shoulder and the back of St-Pierre by members of the Nevada State Athletic Commission (NSAC). Vaseline is used to aid cuts in boxing as well as MMA, but applying it to parts of the body other than the face is illegal because of the element of grappling in the sport. A fighter that is \\"slippery\\" as a result of the vaseline will have an added advantage, because friction and grip are compromised. UFC President Dana White addressed the issue during a radio appearance in Boston, Massachusetts. He indicated that he did not believe the vaseline influenced the outcome of the fight, but still expected Nurse to be punished. Penn's brother revealed two days after the bout that the Penn camp would be making a formal complaint to the NSAC. In addition, Penn's head coach, Rudy Valentino alleged that St-Pierre also had an illegal substance on his body during his April 2008 rematch with Matt Serra. NSAC Executive Director Keith Kizer confirmed that improprieties had occurred in St-Pierre's corner. He witnessed St-Pierre's cornerman Phil Nurse apply Vaseline to St-Pierre's face and then immediately rub St-Pierre's shoulders and back before Nurse wiped his hands. Kizer had St-Pierre's back wiped down after the second round, and confirmed after the third round that no Vaseline was being applied. Kizer was critical of the cornerman's action, but expressed doubts that the controversy would overturn St-Pierre's victory. On March 12, 2009, B.J. Penn filed a formal request for investigation to the NSAC stating that St-Pierre used an illegal \\"greasing\\" agent on his body during the fight. The formal, written complaint consisted of twenty pages. It began by stating that \\"other renowned fighters\\" have also had similar experiences with St- Pierre, that his body was \\"unnaturally slippery.\\" It continued by accounting an apparent \\"pre-bout warning\\" made by Penn's camp to the NSAC that St-Pierre will engage in the illegal application of vaseline. Next, a request to monitor St-Pierre and members of the team to prevent future misconduct was made, namely a monitored shower of St-Pierre and/or hygiene cleansing. The written statement concluded with Penn seeking fines against trainer Greg Jackson, Nurse, and \\"other unnamed individuals\\" of $250,000 each. In addition, that St- Pierre's license be suspended or revoked, and that the result of the bout be changed to a no-contest. St-Pierre's trainer Greg Jackson denied any wrongdoing, stating that Nurse was rubbing and tapping on St-Pierre's body as part of a drill to aid in his breathing techniques. Jackson said that any Vaseline transferred from residue on Nurse's fingers was accidental and wiped off when pointed out. Georges St-Pierre spoke to Sports Illustrated with regard to the controversy stating, \\"I haven't seen the fight yet, but I remember at some point something happened and the athletic commission was complaining. They used a towel to wet my back and wipe it off. I don't mind. I didn't put Vaseline on myself and I'm not a cheater.\\" However, St-Pierre offered Penn a rematch in the summer that Penn verbally accepted but is unlikely to happen due to the fact they have both since been scheduled for title defenses. On March 17, 2009, the NSAC held a formal hearing about the matter. Penn, his mother Lorraine Shin, and his attorney were present to make statements. Greg Jackson, Phil Nurse, and St-Pierre's attorney participated in the hearing as the opposing side. St-Pierre himself was not present. Shin read from a written statement, urging the NSAC to \\"do the right thing\\", and punish St-Pierre to the \\"fullest extent of authority.\\" Jackson and Nurse apologized for the incident, but maintained that they did not knowingly cheat. At the hearing's conclusion, the NSAC Executive Director stated that St-Pierre's victory would not be changed to a no contest, nor would other sanctions, such as the loss of licenses be taken, unless a member of the NSAC files a disciplinary complaint against any of the accused. However, the committee left it ambiguous whether the matter was conclusively closed. Representatives from the Penn camp indicated that they were \\"unsure\\" of their next move. Subsequent events Lyoto Machida took Jackson's place at UFC 98 to challenge for the Light Heavyweight Championship. Following the main event at UFC 94, top welterweight contender Thiago Alves made his way into the cage to congratulate St-Pierre on the victory. After interviews with both fighters, it was announced that Alves would be next to challenge for St-Pierre's championship. This fight took place as the co-main event of the UFC 100 card. St-Pierre's dominant victory also opened up discussion for a possible \\"superfight\\" with UFC Middleweight Champion Anderson Silva in 2010. Dana White stated that this bout was a possibility, and he would like to see it. St- Pierre expressed interest in the fight. After Penn's loss to St-Pierre, reports surfaced that the UFC Lightweight Champion was contemplating retirement. However, during his first public appearance since the loss in Honolulu, Hawaii, he announced that he would continue to fight. He admitted that he was affected by the loss, and that \\"a lot of things were going through his head.\\" In regards to his next bout, Penn stated that he was in negotiation to fight top contender Kenny Florian in the summer of 2009. Penn would go on and defeat Florian at UFC 101, winning in the fourth round by rear naked choke. In the wake of the Vaseline controversy, the UFC responded by implementing immediate rule changes on February 7, 2009. These changes were discussed by longtime cutman Jacob \\"Stitch\\" Duran. According to Duran, under the new rules, only cutmen who are independent of both corners will be allowed to apply Vaseline to the fighter's faces. However, Duran was not able to confirm whether the rules will apply at all UFC events or just the events that take place in Nevada. Despite Lyoto Machida's knockout of Thiago Silva, Dana White indicated that he was not the number one contender for a title shot. Instead, a scheduled fight between former UFC Light Heavyweight Champion Quinton Jackson and Keith Jardine would determine Machida's title fate. A victory for Jackson would earn him a fight with champion Rashad Evans, but a win for Jardine would mean Machida will be awarded with a title shot. Jackson won the fight via unanimous decision, but torn ligaments in his jaw forced the former champion out of the bout. Instead, Machida will challenge Evans for the UFC Light Heavyweight Championship at UFC 98. Jackson will retain his title shot against the winner of that match upon returning from injury. Following the loss to Machida, Thiago Silva was scheduled to return to action against former champion Forrest Griffin at UFC 101, but his opponent was later changed to Keith Jardine. Karo Parisyan's next fight was to be against American Kickboxing Academy's Josh Koscheck at UFC 98. However, due to Parisyan's nine- month suspension from the NSAC for a failed drug test due to painkillers, the future of this fight is uncertain.

A prolific second unit director, MacDonald has worked on various Hollywood blockbusters including Guardians of the Galaxy, The Bourne Ultimatum, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, and The Empire Strikes Back. Career Starting his career in the camera department, MacDonald subsequently spent 10 years as camera operator for renowned cinematographer Geoffrey Unsworth, working on films including Superman, The Return of the Pink Panther, Murder on the Orient Express and Cabaret. After Unsworth's death in 1978, MacDonald increasingly worked as a second unit director, and as a cinematographer himself. MacDonald's debut as director, Rambo III, came about at extremely short notice. \\"I started it without any preparation,\\" he explained in an interview, \\"because Russell Mulcahy [Rambo III's original director] left after two weeks, so I came into it totally ill-prepared - I was directing the second unit on the film. Literally the day before I left America to start Rambo III I'd finished photographing a film, Shag, in America; came to Israel, thinking I was going to do a second unit which I could slowly get into, and within a week or two I was directing one of the most expensive films ever made.\\" MacDonald has since directed other productions including The NeverEnding Story III, and the television mini-series The Monkey King (also known as The Lost Empire). In 2016, MacDonald was hired to direct reshoots during post-production on Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. MacDonald currently works most frequently as a second unit director. Filmography by year for Peter MacDonald at IMDb He has said about this role, \\"The most important thing about any second unit is that you can't tell the difference between the second unit and the first unit. It must have the stamp of the first unit, both in photography and the style of direction. That's why, when I do second unit, I always photograph and direct, so you try and copy what the first unit does as much as possible. You mustn't be on an ego trip and try and do your own style, because your material has to cut into theirs and it mustn't jar, it must fit in exactly so no-one can tell the difference.\\"A Dark Night in Gotham City, Starlog issue 142, May 1989, pp. 37-40.

He served as chief justice of the Supreme Court of Slovakia for two terms (1998‚Äì2003 and 2009‚Äì2014) and Minister of Justice from 2006 to 2009. In 2019 he ran unsuccessfully for President of Slovakia.  Judicial and political career  Harabin graduated from the Faculty of Law, Pavol Jozef ≈†af√°rik University Ko≈°ice. He started his judicial career as a probationary judge at the Ko≈°ice regional court in 1980. Three years later, he became a professional judge at the Poprad district court. Harabin was a member of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia until the Velvet Revolution of 1989. After the revolution, he continued to practice as a judge at the Ko≈°ice regional court, until he was elected to the Supreme Court of Slovakia in 1991. From 1998 to 2003, he was the chief justice of the Supreme Court and, in addition, president of the Judicial Council of Slovakia created in 2001. He served as minister of justice and deputy prime minister in Robert Fico's first cabinet from 4 July 2006 to 23 June 2009. He was nominated by the right-wing People's Party ‚Äì Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (ƒΩS-HZDS), but was not formally a member of that party. Subsequently, he returned to his post of chief justice, serving until June 2014.  2019 Slovak presidential campaign  Harabin ran as a non-partisan candidate in the 2019 Slovak presidential election. While nominally independent, he was endorsed by the extraparliamentary Christian Democracy ‚Äì Life and Prosperity party. He ran on a platform of \\"traditional Slovak culture based on Christianity and family, formed by a man‚Äìfather and woman‚Äìmother\\" and rejecting \\"gender ideology\\". During the campaign he accused Muslim migrants of \\"killing and raping European women in Germany and France\\" and claimed his opponents wanted to destroy Slovak culture. He also condemned NATO, European Union institutions as well as homosexuals. According to Globsec, Harabin was the most favoured candidate by \\"pro-Kremlin disinformation channels\\" on Facebook, receiving 174 positive and no negative posts. Harabin finished third, winning 14.3% of votes.

In case of reactive wind shear detection system, the detection takes place when the aircraft penetrates a wind shear condition of sufficient force, which can pose a hazard to the aircraft. In case of predictive wind shear detection system, the detection takes place, if such wind shear condition is ahead of the aircraft. In 1988, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) mandated that all turbine-powered commercial aircraft must have on-board wind shear detection systems by 1993. Airlines successfully lobbied to have commercial turbo-prop aircraft exempted from this requirement. In the predictive wind shear detection mode, the weather radar processor of the aircraft detects the presence of a microburst, a type of vertical wind shear condition by detecting the Doppler frequency shift of the microwave pulses caused by the microburst ahead of the aircraft and displays the area where it is present in the Navigation Display Unit (of the Electronic Flight Instrument System) along with an aural warning. History of development In August 1985 windshear and inadequate reactions by the pilots caused the crash of Delta Air Lines Flight 191. On July 24, 1986, the FAA of United States and NASA signed a memorandum of agreement to formally begin the Airborne Wind- Shear Detection and Avoidance Program (AWDAP). As a result, a wind-shear program was created in the Flight Systems Directorate of NASA's Langley Research Center. After five years of intensely studying various weather phenomena and sensor technologies, the researchers decided to validate their findings in actual flight conditions. They chose an extensively modified Boeing 737, which was equipped with a rear research cockpit in place of the forward section of the passenger cabin. A modified Rockwell Collins model 708 X-band ground-based radar unit was used in the AWDAP experiments. The real- time radar processor system used during 1992 flight experiments was a VME bus- based system with a Motorola 68030 host processor and three DSP boards. On September 1, 1994, the weather radar model RDR-4B of the Allied-Signal/Bendix (now Honeywell) became the first predictive wind-shear system to be certified for commercial airline operation. In the same year, Continental Airlines became the first commercial carrier to install an airborne predictive wind- shear detection system on its aircraft. By June 1996, Rockwell Collins and Westinghouse's Defense and Electronics Group (now Grumman/Martin) also came up with FAA-certified predictive wind-shear detection systems. The IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Society is conducting researches for further developments of this system.

It is a part of the biophysical profile. * AFI is the score (expressed in cm) given to the amount of amniotic fluid seen on ultrasonography of a pregnant uterus. To determine the AFI, doctors may use a four-quadrant technique,http://www.perinatology.com/Reference/glossary/A/Amniotic%20Fluid%20Index.htm when the deepest, unobstructed, vertical length of each pocket of fluid is measured in each quadrant and then added up to the others, or the so-called \\"Single Deepest Pocket\\" technique. * An AFI between 8-18 is considered normal. Median AFI level is approximately 14 from week 20 to week 35,http://www.fetalanomalies.org/Fluid.html when the amniotic fluid begins to reduce in preparation for birth. * An AFI < 5-6 is considered as oligohydramnios. The exact number can vary by gestational age. The fifth percentile for gestational age is sometimes used as a cutoff value. * An AFI > 24-25 is considered as polyhydramnios. Causes of low amniotic fluid * Leaking or rupture of membranes Leaking or rupture of membranes may be caused by a gush of fluid or a slow constant trickle of fluid. This is due to a tear in the membrane. Premature rupture of membranes can also result in low amniotic fluid levels. * Placental problems Placental problems may cause low amniotic fluid. If the placenta is not providing enough blood and nutrients to the baby, then the baby may stop recycling fluid. * Birth defects Birth defects may occur if the fetus has problems with the development of the kidneys or urinary tract, which could cause little urine production, and it can lead to low levels of amniotic fluid. * Maternal complications Maternal complications may cause low amniotic fluid. Some factors such as hypertension, diabetes, dehydration, preeclampsia, and chronic hypoxia in a woman can have an effect on amniotic fluid levels.

It is set around the life of Bob Slay (played by Paul Kaye), an obnoxious, lazy and amoral phony marketing executive for a leading toiletries company. Yet Bob has a swish office and an attractive girlfriend, and is well regarded by his manager. The television series was written by Mark Grant (who would later go on to write Star) and Mark Chapman who was a co-writer for the second series and provided additional material for the first series. Mark Chapman also directed the first series and produced both series with Nick Wood directing the second. The show's other producer was Lucy Robinson (who produced the first Dennis Pennis instalment and played the mayoress in The Thin Blue Line) and it had executive producers Danielle Lux (All About Me) and Charles Brand (The Comic Strip Presents...).

The video has been discontinued but a Region 2 DVD box set containing both series one and two was due for release on 26 January 2009 by 2entertain, the joint venture by the BBC Worldwide and Woolworths Group. BBC Worldwide own 60% of 2entertain, while Woolworths Group own 40%. However, the release was affected by the collapse of Woolworths in the UK and legal arguments and challenges by the BBC Worldwide over the ownership of the rights over the recordings owned by 2entertain following the demise of Woolworths Group. The legal dispute centres on whether a licensing agreement between BBC Worldwide and 2entertain lapsed when Woolworths Group went into administration.  Quotes and reviews  Paul Kaye said in an interviewhttp://paulspecialkaye.tripod.com/id31.htm regarding the series: \\"I've never really worked in an office but it was the way I imagined you'd keep sane - I mean an office is sort of like an extended playground, isn't it? So the guy does absolutely no work and the only way he can relieve the tedium is by behaving despicably and I think the whole office would actually be sad if he left because it would suddenly be all very mundane. I mean I'm sure that's the case in a lot of real offices - it's like on reality-TV shows, everyone quite likes the bad guy in the Big Brother house, really.\\" Tasche de Vasconcelos who plays Lauren in the first series said: \\"It's a great show, I'm just so proud to have been able to do it. It's brilliantly written\\". She later went on to describe Paul as \\"a wonderful actor and co-partner he was so professional\\". This is a reviewhttp://paulspecialkaye.tripod.com/id31.htm of the first episode of series one: \\"The stylish opening to this new office- centered, six-part situation comedy introduces Bob Slay, the ultimate marketing man. Paul Kaye (well known as spoof interviewer Dennis Pennis), stars as a slick and selfish operator with a saccharine tongue who occasionally justifies his behaviour in asides to the camera. His only real area of vulnerability is his parentage - he was abandoned as a baby. That makes him particularly nervous when he has to meet his gorgeous girlfriend Lauren's parents for the first time. The plotting is quite convoluted in this distinctly adults-only opener, but it has its moments. The best of them involve the marketing director, played by Michael Cochrane as a sex-mad monster who steals all the best lines. Even he confesses to being a little over-eager with Lauren's mother, played by Jan Harvey.\\" References  External links   * DVD Rights owner 2entertain https://web.archive.org/web/20080509161030/http://www.2entertain.co.uk/ * https://web.archive.org/web/20070628212848/http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/p/perfectworld_66602780.shtml (NB: Site no longer available) 2000 British television series debuts 2001 British television series endings 2000s British sitcoms BBC television sitcoms Television series by Endemol Television series by Tiger Aspect Productions English- language television shows Television series produced at Pinewood Studios ","title":"Perfect World (TV series)"},{"id":"16024420","text":"This map shows all MiG-29 operators, current and former.

Licensed to Lockport, Illinois, USA, the station serves the Chicago/greater Joliet region. The station is licensed to and owned by Lewis University. Lewis University is a private Roman Catholic and Lasallian university with an enrollment around 6,800 students. The station is a member of the National Association of Broadcasters, Illinois Broadcasters Association, and Broadcast Education Association. Lewis University's radio station history WFJL-FM - WLCL-AM - WERA-AM - WLRA-FM * WFJL - (W - FJL - Frank J. Lewis) (93.1 FM Chicago) went on the air on May 22, 1949.

Sheil, D.D., of the Archdiocese of Chicago and General Manager Jerry Keefe, radio format consisted of religious,http://www.jjonz.us/RadioLogs/pagesnfiles/logs_files/1940s/1949/49_08aug/%5Bc%5D49-08-24-%28Wed%29.pdf educational, news, talk, and CYO Boxing. WFJL's facilities were located at the Lincoln Tower Building, 75 East Wacker Drive, Chicago, above the ground and had an effective radiated power of 29,000 watts. * WLCL-AM - (W - LCL - Lewis College Lockport) AM carrier current radio station on Lewis College, Lockport, Illinois campus. Located in the Sheil Hall dormitory basement from its inception until 1970, the station broadcast on 600 kHz to Sheil, Fitzpatrick and Founders Halls. Robert Feustal and Norb Bora are credited with the inception of WLCL-AM and introducing college radio at Lewis. In 1969, the Sheil Hall basement facility was upgraded with new QRK professional turntables replacing the old Garrard consumer models AND a pair of Spotmaster tape cartridge machines to handle promos, jingles etc. A used Gates Sta-Level compressor was installed, giving the station a much more professional technical sound. News, weather and sports information now came to the station via a United Press International teletype machine. A direct feed to the PA system in the Lewis cafeteria was also added. * WERA-AM - picked up where WLCL left off in the Fall of 1970. It was at this time that the merger with the College of St. Francis in Joliet was announced (the combined school would be called Lewis-St. Francis of Illinois) and the campus radio station at Lewis (the \\"North Campus\\") would now serve the two dorms at the \\"South Campus\\" (CSF) as well. A direct feed was installed to the newly remodeled Student Union. A second studio was constructed for production use with the turntables and mixer module able to be easily removed for \\"remote\\" broadcast origination from anywhere on the \\"twin campuses.\\" Most of the carpentry work during the upgrade was done by Station Manager Dennis Stork and the studio wiring was done by Mike Berlak. One very late night, while station staffers discussed plans for the new incarnation of the station (around a table at the Pure Oil truckstop on 55), they noticed a dry cleaners' van in the parking lot with the name \\"New Era\\" on it. It was a \\"new era\\" for both the college and the campus radio station...and that was the inspiration for the new call letters, WERA. At that time, the station also changed transmitter frequency to 590 kHz. At the start of the Fall 1971 semester, the station conducted its biggest promotional push, \\"weraweek!\\" Highlights included the WERA YesterHop (a live broadcast/50s style \\"sock hop\\" in the Union) and a flight of the WERA Beer Bomber (a live broadcast from an airplane over the campus which dropped certificates good for six-packs to the assembled multitudes below.) During the 1971-72 school year, General Manager Mike Berlak began the process of applying for an FCC FM license, which would allow over-the-air broadcasts. In anticipation of this expansion, a completely new broadcast facility was built in the former Fitz Hall Lounge area, opening in the Spring of 1972. * WLRA-FM - (W - LRA - Lewis RAdio) went on the air March 4, 1973 on 88.1 in mono, 250 watts of effective radiated power at HAAT. WLRA is licensed as a non-commercial educational radio station. In 1976 WLRA added stereo. Lewis University was annexed from Lockport to Romeoville, Illinois and WLRA's license reflected the change. Although Steve Partman was the first General Manager of WLRA Rado, Mike Berlak is credited with all the work getting WLRA licensed and moving its facilities to Fitzpatrick Hall - he graduated before the first broadcast in Spring 1973 but came back to do the first show on the new FM station. Programming As with most colleges, WLRA included, the music industry and musical tastes of the station's staff and the listening audience change with the times. Colleges and Universities have a diverse student population and audience. The college's radio station has the obligation to meet these challenges. As Cardinal John Henry Newman wrote: \\"to live is to change... and to be perfect is to have changed often\\". College radio stations pride themselves by promoting underplayed and under-represented forms of music, the obscure and unique - versus the mainstream. The college radio stations achieve this with the independent music labels and the College Media Journal. WLRA Radio's diverse programming reflects a traditional college radio format known as variety presented in block style (2-4 hour show). WLRA Radio has hosted many innovative radio programs over the years. These include an eclectic and Freeform, experimental college radio programming, weekly live radio talk shows, Lewis University Flyer sporting events from around the country, remote broadcasts, and community service events. WLRA's current programming includes news and sports talk radio, coverage of Lewis University Flyer Sports, local high school football and basketball; music genre formats including: adult album alternative, alternative rock, hip hop, rap, rock and roll, blues, jazz, reggae, religious, country, seasonal Christmas music, and Latina-American cultural immersion. In the Fall 2008 semester, WLRA staffed 24 hour with students on air. The station also introduced a Trop Rock format called \\"The Island\\" which features calypso, reggae, and Caribbean rock music. WLRA has broadcast many radio remotes from as far away as Florida to cover Lewis University Flyer Baseball, Las Vegas to broadcast \\"The Practice Squad\\" sports talk show; and also the National Association of Broadcasters Convention at the Comrex booth. The radio station has also done broadcast from The House of Blues in Chicago, LaLaPalooza, Jimmy Buffett pre-concert, Ditka's Restaurant in Chicago, and ESPN Zone in Chicago. WLRA, with a commitment to community service, has produced marathon broadcasts for a local children's hospital and Christmas music programming with the United Way of Will County. In March 2011, broadcasting student Jodi Steinberg, set a WLRA broadcasting record with a 76-hour non-stop on-air marathon during \\"To Kill A DJ\\".http://media.www.lewisflyer.com/media/storage/paper638/news/2006/11/24/News/real- World.Brad.Returns.To.Lewis-2471284.shtml Specialty radio shows \\"The Island\\" features calypso, reggae, and Caribbean rock music (Friday Midnight - Sunday 3am) \\"Route 53 Country\\" features country music (Sunday 6am-6pm) \\"Friday Night Lights\\" features local high school football games from the Joliet region (weekly - Friday 6pm-10pm) \\"United Way of Will County's Christmas Memories for you and your Family\\" features religious and secular Christmas music (Thanksgiving until January, 24 hours a day) Technical achievements Lewis University's WLRA Radio was the first college radio station in the country to become digital. Lewis University received a $350,000 digital broadcasting project grant in the 1990s from philanthropy of The Andrew Corporation, a leading worldwide communications corporation. The studios, music archives, music scheduling system, audio storage and retrieval systems (including an AES/EBU Broadcast Electronics - Audiovault serial number 001 and 002), digital audio consoles, CD players & recorders, minidisc players and recorders, and DAT), ISDN digital phone system, ISDN and IP remote broadcast codecs, Optimod 8700 AES/EBU audio processing, AES/EBU broadcast delay, Harris Digit AES/EBU fm exciter, and transmitters were upgraded from analog to state of the art digital AES3 type I balanced and type II optical. The entire digital project was a joint venture with the Freberg Communications Corporation of Illinois, Harris Corporation of Florida, Pacific Research and Engineering of California, A-Ware Corporation (Musicmaster) of Wisconsin, and Broadcast Electronics Corporation of Illinois. WLRA also added RDS Radio Data System to the FM transmission allowing information about the artist and song to be displayed on a radio tuned to 88.1-FM. Lewis University installed a new self standing radio tower and new digital IBOC or HD Radio ready ERI Rototiler single bay fm antenna in 2000 adjacent to DeLaSalle Hall. WLRA increased the antenna height to HAAT and had to reduce the effective radiated power to 140 watts. WLRA moved from the basement of Fitzpatick Hall dormitory basement to new studios and broadcasting center in December 2005. The new broadcasting facility was named The Andrew Center of Electronic Media at Lewis University. The state of the art broadcasting studios and transmitters are located in DeLaSalle Hall on the Lewis University Romeoville campus. In 2005 WLRA began streaming a simulcast of the station over the Internet and in 2008 mobile media APPs for the Apple iPhone and iPod Touch. Simultaneously Apple added WLRA as one of their iTunes Radio Stations under College format. WLRA uses an AES3 Orban Opticodec audio processing/encoder for their 128kbs and 64kbs bit streams. In 2010, WLRA and Broadcast Electronics, Inc. integrated social media automation and Twitter with the newest generation of Broadcast Electronics AudioVault (FLEX) and Message Manager (TRE) RBDS data. The automation allow listeners to be notified of favorite artist being played through tagging. WLRA was the first station to have Broadcast Electronics integrate customer supplied computers, paving the way for other stations to upgrade into new generation Audiovault FLEX. In the Spring of 2012 WLRA was among the first 15 colleges selected to be part of Clear Channel Communication's iHeartRadio for both internet streaming and mobile media apps.

Also known as George Tressler, Hans Tressler, Hans Dressler, Hans Georg Keil and Hans Sternbeck (per IMDb). The son of actor Otto Tressler, he began his acting career in the 1930s. George Tressler was drafted into the German army during World War II and served on the Russian Front. He became ill and was released from the service and returned to Vienna. In the immediated post-war period Tressler was employed making films to help his Austrian compatriots better understand how to benefit from US Marshall Plan aid. According to Maria Fritsche, author of \\"The American Marshall Plan Film Campaign and the Europeans: A Captivated Audience?\\" Tressler took special efforts to find ways to convince his audience accepting US aid was of genuine benefit to them. In particular, when he found Austrian farmers feared the techniques and technology used in America on much larger American farms was inapplicable to their much smaller farms Tressler found ways to show how those techniques could be adapted to Austrian farms. When Tressler turned to directing feature films, many of them shared themes of youthful rebellion. His 1956 film Die Halberstarken/Teenage Wolfpack was one of the most popular films in Austria. He directed nearly 80 movies during his lifetime, including The Death Ship (1959) with Horst Buchholz and Mario Adorf. He came to Hollywood and directed Disney's The Magnificent Rebel (1962). Other works include Teenage Wolfpack (1956) and 2069: A Sex Odyssey (1974). His 1966 film Der Weibsteufel was entered into the 16th Berlin International Film Festival.

The concept was originally proposed by Aho and Ullman. The following article deals with tree-walking automata. For a different notion of tree automaton, closely related to regular tree languages, see branching automaton. Definition All trees are assumed to be binary, with labels from a fixed alphabet Œ£. Informally, a tree-walking automaton (TWA) A is a finite state device that walks over an input tree in a sequential manner. At each moment A visits a node v in state q. Depending on the state q, the label of the node v, and whether the node is the root, a left child, a right child or a leaf, A changes its state from q to q' and moves to the parent of v or its left or right child. A TWA accepts a tree if it enters an accepting state, and rejects if its enters a rejecting state or makes an infinite loop. As with string automata, a TWA may be deterministic or nondeterministic. More formally, a (nondeterministic) tree-walking automaton over an alphabet Œ£ is a tuple where Q is a finite set of states, its subsets I, F, and R are the sets of initial, accepting and rejecting states, respectively, and is the transition relation. Example A simple example of a tree-walking automaton is a TWA that performs depth-first search (DFS) on the input tree. The automaton A has three states, Q = \\\\\\\\{ q_{0}, q_{\\\\mathit{left}}, q_{\\\\mathit{right}} \\\\\\\\}. A begins in the root in state q_{0} and descends to the left subtree. Then it processes the tree recursively. Whenever A enters a node v in state q_{\\\\mathit{left}}, it means that the left subtree of v has just been processed, so it proceeds to the right subtree of v. If A enters a node v in state q_{\\\\mathit{right}}, it means that the whole subtree with root v has been processed and A walks to the parent of v and changes its state to q_{\\\\mathit{left}} or q_{\\\\mathit{right}}, depending on whether v is a left or right child. Properties Unlike branching automata, tree-walking automata are difficult to analyze: even simple properties are nontrivial to prove. The following list summarizes some known facts related to TWA: *As shown by Boja≈Ñczyk and Colcombet, deterministic TWA are strictly weaker than nondeterministic ones (\\\\mathit{DTWA} \\\\subsetneq \\\\mathit{TWA}) *deterministic TWA are closed under complementation (but it is not known whether the same holds for nondeterministic ones) *the set of languages recognized by TWA is strictly contained in regular tree languages (\\\\mathit{TWA} \\\\subsetneq \\\\mathit{REG}), i.e. there exist regular languages that are not recognized by any tree-walking automaton, see Boja≈Ñczyk and Colcombet.

Pennington, a member of the Whig Party, became the first speaker of the Indiana territorial legislature's lower house in 1810, served as the territory's census enumerator in 1815, and represented Harrison County as one of its five delegates to the constitutional convention of 1816. Pennington was the first speaker of the Indiana Senate (1816 to 1818), and served in the state legislature for eighteen years, which included five years in the Indiana House of Representatives and thirteen years in the Indiana Senate. His major political contributions relate to his strong opposition to slavery. Pennington ran unsuccessfully for Indiana's Lieutenant Governor in 1825. In addition to his service in the state legislature, Penning was a Harrison County sheriff and a justice of the peace, a trustee of Indiana University, and a member of the Grand Lodge of Indiana. He also supervised construction of the limestone courthouse that served as Indiana's first state capitol building in Corydon, Indiana. The historic Old Capitol, the seat of state government from 1816 to 1825, is one of his most enduring legacies. Fondly remembered as \\"Old Uncle Dennis\\" or \\"Father Pennington,\\" he was known for his common sense and strong character and became one of Harrison County's most influential citizens. Early life and education Pennington was born in Cumberland County, Virginia, just before American Independence, on May 18, 1776, to Nancy \\"Nettie\\" (Lark or Larke) and Edward Pennington. Dennis had five siblings (four brothers and one sister). Although he received little to no formal schooling, Pennington's education came from life experiences and interactions with others. In the fall of 1797 Pennington moved west to Kentucky, traveling part of the way with anti-slavery advocate Henry Clay. Pennington, who farmed land east of Louisville, befriended Clay and supported Clay's attempt to make Kentucky a Free State In 1799.Although the Pennington family owned slaves when they resided in Virginia, they freed all of them before leaving the state. One of the slaves, known as \\"Aunt Fannie\\", refused to be left behind in Virginia. She stayed with Dennis's brother, Walter Pennington, as a free household servant after he relocated to Indiana. When Fannie died, she was one of several freed slaves living in Corydon. See Gresham, p. 23. Marriage and family Pennington married Elizabeth English in Kentucky on August 4, 1800. Native Americans captured Elizabeth, along with her siblings, Virginia \\"Jinnie\\" and Matthew, when she was four years old. Elizabeth was returned to the English family at the age of thirteen. She died in 1857. Elizabeth's sister, Virginia, married Dennis's brother, William, in 1804. William and Virginia Pennington settled near present-day Lanesville, Indiana, a part of the Northwest Territory at that time.Gresham, p. 15. Dennis's sister, Mary, married George Greshham, the grandparents of Walter Quintin Gresham. Walter Gresham was partially named for Walter Pennington, a Methodist minister and one of Mary's and Dennis's brothers.Gresham, pp. 8‚Äì9, 12‚Äì13. Career Sometime between 1801 and 1804 Pennington crossed the Ohio River Louisville, Kentucky, entering the Northwest Territory at Clarksville.Clark's Grant, the present-day site of Clarksville, had been given to George Rogers Clark and his men in 1786 as payment for their service in the capture of Vincennes and Kaskaskia during the American Revolutionary War. See Gresham, p. 13, and Esarey, p. 203. Pennington arrived in Harrison County around 1802, purchased land near Lanesville, where his brother, William resided with his family, built a homestead, and established a farm. Around 1804 Around 1804 Pennington was among the early pioneers who explored the site in what became the town of Corydon, Indiana, where he built a cabin.Gresham, p. 19.Esarey, pp. 205‚Äì06. In 1815 Pennington moved to \\"the Barrens\\" (the present-day community of Central Barren, Indiana), north of Corydon. Pennington's brother, Walter, joined him at the Barrens, where they built a Methodist meetinghouse called Pennington Chapel. Political career Pennington, a farmer and stonemason and became active in politics as a member of the Whig Party and an anti-slavery activist. According to family tradition, as Pennington traveled in the Northwest Territory in the late 1790s Pennington met Arthur St. Clair, governor of the Northwest Territory, and Thomas Worthington, a fellow Virginian who became governor of Ohio. Pennington's contact with these men, along with the success of the anti-slavery movement in Ohio, reportedly influenced his decision to become an anti-slavery activist. On one of his trips to Vincennes, the territorial capital, Pennington encountered William Henry Harrison, who became the pro-slavery governor of the Indiana Territory in 1801.Gresham, pp. 19‚Äì20. Initially, Pennington supported Harrison's political ambitions, but changed his position when the governor began initiating pro-slavery policies within the Indiana Territory, which was established in 1800 from the western portion of the Northwest Territory. On December 28, 1802, Harrison asked the U.S. Congress for a ten-year suspension of Article VI of the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 that prohibited slavery in the territory. Harrison argued that the anti-slavery clause discouraged migration of slave-owning settlers into the territory, but his request was denied. In September 1803 Harrison and his pro-slavery supporters introduced measures in the territorial general assembly that allowed indentured servitude, a form a slavery, within the territory.Barnhart and Riker, p. 336. In 1805, when President Thomas Jefferson delegated his authority to Harrison to make appointments to the territory's Legislative Council, the territorial governor appointed his pro-slavery political supporters, who continued efforts to legalize slavery within the territory.Gresham, p. 21.In an effort to evade the provisions outlined in Article VI of the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, the Indiana Territory's pro-slavery faction passed legislation allowing slaves brought into the territory to be registered in county courts as indentured servants, with extended indentures that lasted a decade or longer. See Barnhart and Riker, p. 345‚Äì48. Pennington, who became a justice of the peace for Harrison County in 1807, entered politics in open opposition of Harrison and the pro-slavery government. On October 10, 1807, Pennington vocalized his opposition to slavery during a meeting at Springville in Clark County. Pennington's speech condemned slavery and the government that legalized it. The meeting attendees drafted and adopted a resolution opposing slavery in the territory and resolved to put an end to the \\"despised institution\\".Gresham, pp. 21‚Äì22 Pennington also supported the doctrine of \\"squatter sovereignty,\\" which would grant citizens the right to decide the future of slavery in the territory. On February 27, 1809, the U.S. Congress amended the Northwest Ordinance to allow the Indiana Territory's citizens to elect representatives to its bicameral legislature, which reduced the governor's power. (Previously representatives to the lower house were selected popular election and the governor appointed members to the Legislative Council (upper house) from a pool of men nominees provided by the elected representatives in the lower house.)Gresham, pp. 21‚Äì22.Barnhart and Riker, p. 355. =Territorial legislator= On April 2, 1810, Pennington was elected as the Harrison County representative to the territorial legislature's lower house. Many of his anti- slavery cohorts were also elected to the legislature, giving them an overwhelming majority. Pennington became the first speaker of the territorial legislature's lower house. He introduced and helped pass laws to repeal the slavery and indenturing laws implemented by Harrison, and along with his anti- slavery allies sought to prohibit the introduction of indentured servitude, including slavery, into the territory.Gresham, pp. 22‚Äì23. Shortly after the outbreak of the War of 1812, Pennington wrote a resolution to relocate the territorial capital: \\"Resolved, that the capitol be removed from Vincennes, because it is dangerous to continue longer here on account of threatened depredations of the Indians, who may destroy our valuable records.\\"Gresham, p. 25. Corydon, Pennington's hometown, competed with Charlestown, Clarksville, Jeffersonville, Lawrenceburg, and Madison, to become the new territorial capital. Pennington helped secure Corydon's selection as the new seat of government, which became effective May 1, 1813, by pointing out its ideal location. The Harrison County court had approved a design for a new county courthouse that the territorial legislature could use for its assembly building. Pennington was awarded the contract to supervise construction of the new courthouse, which began in 1814 and was nearly completed when Indiana's first state legislature convened at Corydon in 1816.Boomhower, p. 17. The construction cost of the new building was approximately about $3,000. It served as Indiana's first state capitol building from 1816 to 1825.Taylor, et. al., p. 170.Boomhower, p. 19. On March 3, 1813, Thomas Posey succeeded Harrison as governor of the Indiana Territory and head of the pro-slavery party. Pennington continued to attack the territory's pro-slavery faction and, according to some sources, his unrelenting political assault drove Posey from the capital at Corydon. (Posey claimed his poor health required him to be near to his physician at Jeffersonville.) In 1815 Pennington served as the Indiana Territory's census enumerator. He used the position to promote his anti- slavery platform to every home within the territory and laid the groundwork for the election of anti-slavery delegates to the constitutional convention. Pennington and other members of the anti-slavery movement tried to prevent slavery from becoming a part of Indiana's state constitution, which would be drafted in June 1816.Gresham, p. 24. Pennington remarked, \\"Let us be on our guard when our convention men are chosen that they be men opposed to slavery.\\" As speaker of the Indiana Territory's lower house of representatives, Pennington signed the memorial to the U.S. Congress in 1815 stating its qualification to become a state and asking permission to hold a convention to discuss statehood. David Robb, president of the territorial council, signed the memorial on behalf of the legislature's upper chamber.Esarey, p. 217. The request was presented in the U.S. House of Representatives on December 28, 1815, and introduced in the U.S. Senate on January 2, 1816. President James Madison signed an Enabling Act on April 19, 1816, that authorized the constitutional convention. If a majority of its delegates agreed, the delegation would proceed to draft a state constitution for Indiana. =State constitutional convention delegate= Portrait of Dennis Pennington In May 1816 Pennington was elected as one of Harrison County's five delegate to attend Indiana's first constitutional convention. Pennington was present when the delegates convened at Corydon from June 10 to 29, 1816, to consider statehood and to draft fIndiana's first state constitution. As a slavery opponent he allied himself with Jonathan JenningsPennington had encouraged Jennings to run for Congress against Harrison's candidate, and once there he further encouraged him to use his position to speed the territory's path to statehood. The hope was that upon statehood, the constitutional convention could be stacked against slavery, and then the state could elect its own governor rather than have it appointed by the President. They hoped that this would allow the state to be rid of any more pro-slavery governors. See Gresham, pp. 22‚Äì23 and other anti-slavery delegates. The group was successful in their efforts to include a provision in the state constitution that prohibited constitutional amendments to allow slavery in Indiana. As outlined in Article VIII, Section 1, Indiana's 1816 constitution banned any alteration or amendment of the state constitution that would introduce slavery or involuntary servitude into the state: > But, as the holding any part of the human Creation in slavery, or > involuntary servitude, can only originate in usurpation and tyranny, no > alteration of this constitution shall ever take place so as to introduce > slavery or involuntary servitude in this State, otherwise than for the > punishment of crimes, whereof the party shall have been duly convicted. The anti-slavery faction of the constitutional convention also hoped that statehood for Indiana, which would give its citizens the authority to elect their own governor instead of having one appointed by the U.S. president, would rid the new state of pro-slavery governors in the future. =State legislator= After statehood was achieved in 1816, Pennington was elected to a seat in the Indiana Senate and served as its first speaker from 1816 to 1818. He continued to be an outspoken critic of slavery and a Whig. Pennington's eighteen years of service representing Harrison County in the Indiana General Assembly included thirteen years in the Indiana Senate and five in the Indiana House of Representatives. Pennington served in the Indiana Senate 1816‚Äì20, 1825‚Äì27, 1830‚Äì33, and 1842‚Äì45, and as a state representatives in 1822‚Äì24, 1828‚Äì30, and 1845‚Äì46. In 1818, Pennington, a lifelong anti-slavery activist, had three Kentuckians indicted for violating Indiana's \\"man stealing act,\\" when they forcibly removed a black woman from a home in Harrison County, Indiana, and took her to Kentucky. Governor Jennings asked Gabriel Slaughter, the governor of Kentucky, to return the men to Indiana to stand trial; however, several years of correspondence, the Kentucky governor refused on constitutional grounds.Gresham, p. 42 The incident caused Governor Jennings to change his position on helping fugitive slaves escape. Instead, he attempted to prevent them from entering the state. Pennington was a candidate for Indiana's Lieutenant Governor in 1825, but he was defeated. During the campaign and as one of the most outspoken members of the Indiana General Assembly, Pennington opposed the state's massive plan for internal improvements, especially the construction of the Wabash and Erie Canal.Gresham, pp. 11‚Äì12. He was among the nine legislators, which included James Whitcomb, who voted against the Mammoth Internal Improvement Act of 1836. He opposed the majority view, claiming their plans would have no direct benefits for his constituents and would only bankrupt the state. Pennington also argued that the arrival of railroads would quickly make plans for a statewide canal system obsolete. His predictions proved to be nearly correct. The entire system of internal improvements, which included a network of roads, canals, and railroads, was never fully completed and the massive projects bankrupted the state government. By 1841 the state was unable to repay its debt on the projects in 1847 government officials finally agreed to a settlement with investors and creditors for the state to repay $11,065,000, about half its total debt at that time. (Its initial appropriation was $10 million). Instead of receiving repayment in cash, some creditors accepted stock in the Wabash and Erie Canal, which eventually covered . Although Indiana's canal system ultimately proved to be financially unprofitable for its investors, it increased trade and commerce and contributed to the development of Indiana towns along its towpaths when it was in operation.Dunn, v. I, p. 408. After Pennington lost his bid to become Indiana's lieutenant governor, he continued to serve in the Indiana General Assembly until 1846. He was one of the oldest men in the Indiana House and was affectionately called \\"Old Uncle Dennis\\" and \\"Father Pennington\\".Dunn, v. I, p. 407. Later years Pennington remained active in civic life during his later years. He became a trustee of Indiana University. In 1850 he served as a census enumerator for Harrison County. When Pennington was about sixty years old he was appointed to fill an unexpired term as sheriff of Harrison County, and won election to a second term. During the campaign his opponent claimed Pennington's age and infirmities would make him unable to fulfill the duties of the office. Pennington responded by challenging the younger candidate to a wrestling match. His opponent declined; Pennington won that election.Gresham, p. 11. Death and legacy Pennington died at his Harrison County home near Corydon on September 2, 1854, at the age of seventy-eight. He was buried in Harrison County's Pennington Chapel Cemetery. Pennington is remembered for his honesty and common sense, as well as his kindness. As a \\"grand old man\\" in Indiana politics, he remained politically active for nearly thirty years. Pennington is best known for his opposition to slavery and years of public service representing Harrison County as a territorial and state legislator. Beginning in 1810 he served speaker of its lower house of representatives and helped secure Corydon's selection as the new seat of government in 1813. Pennington was also a delegate to the 1816 constitutional convention that drafted Indiana's first state constitution and served in the Indiana General Assembly for eighteen years. Pennington's most visible legacy is located in Corydon, Indiana, where he supervised construction of Indiana's first state capitol building. The Old Capitol, located in the Corydon Historic District, is part of the Corydon Capital State Historic Site, administered by the Indiana State Museum and Historic Sites. Honors and tributes The Kintner House Inn, a bed and breakfast in Corydon, Indiana, named one of its guest rooms in honor of Pennington, one of Harrison County's most influential citizens.

Teams from across the world go to Portland, Oregon, United States to present and defend business plans to a panel of judges for the chance to win the grand prize of $25,000. All NVC competitors receive invaluable advice from world class judges and will receive various cash prizes to help them turn their plans into a successful business.  History  The first ever NVC was held in 1992. Only three teams competed and it was held in a university classroom at the University of Oregon campus. The grand prize was $300. In 2008, over 70 teams submitted entries to compete for more than $70,000 in prizes and for a place in both the 2008 Global Moot Corp. and the 2009 NVC Competition. Only the top 20 teams of about 60 applicants are selected to present in Portland each year. In April 2007, Columbia Sportswear CEO Tim Boyle and his wife, Mary, donated a total of $5 million to the University of Oregon. $3.5 million went to the New Venture Championship. Past winners In 2013, NVC unexpectedly had two first place winners. AGcerez from Thailand‚Äôs Sasin Graduate Institute of Business Administration and Awair from Stanford University were named 2013 NVC co- champions. AGcerez introduced a fruit syrup with helpful bacteria to aid digestion and Awair presented Wyshbone, a device that delivers local anesthetic to patients' throats using breathing tubes.

Alongside his artistic wife, Anne Charteris 4th Countess of Warwick, he oversaw the redecoration of the castle's Great Hall and domestic apartments after the fire of 1871. The celebrated architect Anthony Salvin was employed to rebuild the hall in the typical Victorian 'Gothic' taste, embellished with stained glass to achieve the effect of a medieval baronial hall. The domestic apartments were also redesigned, with each room assigned a different 'historical' style, typical of the nineteenth century interest in the 'Romantic Interior'. Known as a prolific collector of books, Lord Warwick established a Shakespeare Library at Warwick Castle with the help of James Halliwell-Phillipps during the years 1852‚Äì1870.

Canada's mineral resources are diverse and extensive. Across the Canadian Shield and in the north there are large iron, nickel, zinc, copper, gold, lead, molybdenum, and uranium reserves. Large diamond concentrations have been recently developed in the Arctic, making Canada one of the world's largest producers. Throughout the Shield there are many mining towns extracting these minerals. The largest, and best known, is Sudbury, Ontario. Sudbury is an exception to the normal process of forming minerals in the Shield since there is significant evidence that the Sudbury Basin is an ancient meteorite impact crater. The nearby, but less known Temagami Magnetic Anomaly has striking similarities to the Sudbury Basin. Its magnetic anomalies are very similar to the Sudbury Basin, and so it could be a second metal-rich impact crater.

Harmon was born in Bennington, Vermont on February 19, 1778, son of Daniel and Lucretia (Dewey) Harmon and died April 23, 1843, in Sault-au- R√©collet (Montreal North), Lower Canada. He took as a common-law wife Elizabeth (Lizzette) Laval or Duval (ca. 1790 - February 14, 1862) on October 5, 1805, at South Branch House, Northwest Territory, British America (he legally married August 19, 1819, at Fort William, Ontario, Canada) and had 12 children. Harmon joined the North West Company in 1800 and gradually moved westward, finally arriving in British Columbia in 1809. There he served for ten years at Fort Saint James and Fort Fraser. Harmon was not one of the well known names in fur-trading history. He served mostly in subordinate positions and carried out no explorations. His fame rests solely on his published journal, which documents his experience in the Canadian frontier. The journal was heavily edited and rewritten for publication by the Reverend Daniel Haskel of Burlington, Vermont, and appeared with the title, \\"A journal of voyages and travels in the interior of North America, between the 47th and 58th degrees of north latitude, extending from Montreal nearly to the Pacific Ocean, a distance of about 5,000 miles, including an account of the principal occurrences, during a residence of nineteen years, in different parts of the country. . .\\" (Andover, Mass., 1820). In addition to a description of life in the fur trade during the early years of the 19th century the work is notable for its account of the moral dilemmas Harmon confronted in the context his lingering Puritan morality and the sexual customs in the frontier. Harmon took a Native American Indian wife but refused the traders' practice of abandoning them and instead returned with her to Vermont and formal marriage. The full journal consists of three parts In addition to the diary proper, there are two lengthy appendices, one on the Indians East of the Rockies (basically the Cree) and one on the Indians West of the Rockies (basically the Carrier). The latter contains the first substantial source of information about the Carrier language, in the form of a list of about 300 words. The appendices are omitted from at least one recent edition.

As a result of this treaty Britain gained full control of Afghan foreign policy from the king of Afghanistan. Germany, as a rival to Britain, was only able through secret missions and expeditions to reduce British influence in Afghanistan. Engineer Gebhard Fleischer, nicknamed The German James Bond in Kabul, was an engineer of the Krupp company, a German arms manufacturer. In 1893 he traveled to Kabul and privately met with the King Abdur Rahman Khan. Under the Kings orders he expanded the Afghan weapons companies Maschin Khana (House of machines) and Tupkhana (cannon house). It is not certain whether the government in British India knew of this journey. Later, in 1904, the Krupp engineers were mysteriously assassinated. Adamec writes: History = Trade and friendship treaty of 1916 = The relations between Germany and Afghanistan began before World War I. Relations between these two countries have historically been friendly. The second German-Afghan meeting between Habibullah Khan and a 23-member German delegation took place in 1915. The main intentions of this delegation was to weaken British influence in Afghanistan as part of the Niedermayer-Hentig expedition.Adamec, Ibid. However, during this expedition in 1916 a friendly trade-agreement occurred. The trade contracted concluded even though there were prior diplomatic relations between these countries. According to the Treaty of 24 January 1916 the German delegation to the Government of Afghanistan was promised 100,000 rifles and 300 guns.http://historio.de/jahrestage/40-ereignis/68-24-januar-1916-deutsche- gewehre-fuer-afghanistan A friendship agreement was made on 3 March 1926.Text in League of Nations Treaty Series, vol. 62, pp. 116‚Äì125.

During 1940 and 1941, there were plans initiated by Afghan economic minister Abdul Majid Zabuli for Afghanistan to join the Axis bloc in return for Germany providing additional military aid and access to the Karachi Port by taking land from British India. In addition, Zabuli spoke of \\"liberating\\" the 15 million strong ethnic Afghan population across the border. However following the Soviet Union's change of allegiance to the United Kingdom, and their joint invasion of Iran, Afghanistan was suddenly surrounded by the Allied forces.

Relations temporarily froze following the republican coup in Afghanistan, but was restored by 1976. Following the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War, the West German soldiers stationed in Afghanistan left the country. Qualified West German personal and advisors left the country in 1980 followed by teaching staff in 1984. Meanwhile, East Germany supported the Soviet role in the country and assisted the Afghan government.https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/monographs/2011/RAND_MG1078.pdf Afghanistan and East Germany did not have many links since the latter was recognized in 1973, but this all changed during the Afghan communist regime. Cultural and economic agreements were made, and both countries' media agencies cooperated. The basis was formed following a visit by Afghan leader, Babrak Karmal, to East Germany, after which a Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation was signed on May 21, 1982. Their cooperation had a particular focus on the education sector.https://thruttig.wordpress.com/2016/10/22/deutsch- afghanische-und-ddr-afghanische-beziehungen/ In 1985, total East German solidarity donations to Afghans was over 200 million marks, most of which came from the Free German Trade Union Federation.https://thruttig.wordpress.com/2016/10/22/deutsch-afghanische-und- ddr-afghanische-beziehungen/ =After German reunification= German Army soldiers in northern Afghanistan (2009) German police officers training Afghan officers in Afghanistan (2010) The German Armed Forces were part of the ISAF mission in Afghanistan from December 2001.

Design and development In configuration, the Swiss Trainer is a mid-wing, cantilever monoplane with fixed spatted tricycle undercarriage. Accommodation for the pilot and instructor was provided as side-by-side seats under an expansive bubble canopy. The four-cylinder horizontally-opposed piston engine drove a fixed two-blade propeller. While the layout of the aircraft was entirely orthodox, its construction was not, as the Swiss Trainer was designed to be as modular as possible to lower the cost and complexity of production and maintenance. To this end, as many parts were made interchangeable as possible. For example, all nine control surfaces (two ailerons, four flap segments, two elevators, and the rudder) are the same part that can be fitted to any of these locations with minimal modification. Both halves of the horizontal stabiliser and the fin can similarly be interchanged, and most of the left and right wings is common to both.Air International March 1984, p. 154. The aircraft features an unusual exhaust that spans the entire length of the underside of the fuselage. Entry is through a forward sliding canopy that also includes the wing root fairing. In 1993, all rights to the design were acquired by SME Aerospace of Malaysia, who began to produce it as the Aero Tiga shortly thereafter, having received orders for 20 by the Royal Malaysian Air Force. The first two of these were delivered in 1995, and the order was increased to 60 aircraft the following year. SME Aerospace also received orders for 20 aircraft for the Indonesian government's flight training center at Curug, as part of a deal by the Malaysian government to acquire IPTN CN-235 transports.

Family Augustine was the son of Lambert Grimaldi, Lord of Monaco (1420‚Äì1494) and Claudine Grimaldi (1451‚Äì1515). Two of his brothers, Jean (1468‚Äì1505) and Lucien (1487‚Äì1523) were Lords of Monaco. Regency Upon the assassination of his brother Lucien on 22 August 1523, Augustine was appointed Regent to Lucien's son Honor√©, who was not yet a year old. He held this position for over 8 years, until his death at the age of 50 in 1532. In 1524, to better avenge himself on his brother's murderers, Bartholomew Doria and Andrea Doria, Augustine deserted Francis I of France, with whom the Doria's were allied. He then swore allegiance to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain, by the signing of the Treaties of Burgos and Tordesillas. This brought Monaco under Spanish protection, and Augustine was placed at the head of the government in Monaco. The alliance lasted from 1525 to 1641. This alliance weighed heavily on the financial situation of Monaco, and shortly before his death, Augustine admitted to regret for his actions in this regard. During his Regency, Charles V paid a visit to Monaco in 1529. Bishop and Abbot Augustine served as Bishop of Grasse from 1505 until his death. He was also the Abbot of L√©rins, a Cistercian monastery located on the island of Saint-Honorat, one of the L√©rins Islands, on the French Riviera. In 1516, he united his monastery at L√©rins with the Cassinese Congregation. The church sent Giovanni Andrea Cortese (1483‚Äì1548), known within the order as Gregorio, to L√©rins to introduce the Cassinese reform. In 1519, Augustine commissioned a monk named Don Taxil to construct a village adjacent to the abbey, with the hope of attracting converts. Thus he is accredited as the founder of the village of Valbonne. References Sources *Jean de Pins (2007), Letters and Letter Fragments, p. 111 note 1; Google Books.

Events  On Friday 30 March 1849 two officials of the Westport Poor Law Union arrived in Louisburgh to inspect those people in receipt of outdoor relief to verify that they should continue to receive it. The inspection, for some reason, did not take place and the two officials went on to Delphi Lodge ‚Äì a hunting lodge ‚Äì south of Louisburgh where they intended to spend the night. The people who had gathered for the inspection, or later did so, were consequently instructed to appear at Delphi Lodge at 07:00 the following morning if they wished to continue receiving relief. For much of the night and day that followed seemingly hundreds of destitute and starving people had to undertake what for them, given their existing state of debilitation, was an extremely fatiguing journey, in very bad weather. A letter-writer to The Mayo Constitution reported shortly afterwards that the bodies of seven people, including women and children, were subsequently discovered on the roadside between Delphi and Louisburgh overlooking the shores of Doolough lake and that nine more never reached their homes. Local folklore maintains the total number that perished because of the ordeals they had to endure was far higher. Doolough Pass A cross and an annual Famine Walk between Louisburgh and Doolough commemorates this event.

The area is often considered to be the southernmost main hills and carboniferous limestone rock strata of the Pennines. Although outside the National Park boundary, the hills are geologically in the White Peak area of the Peak District. The main peak, known as The Walk, with an Ordnance Survey trig point is above sea level. The southern slopes are rather steep, overlooking the hamlets of Ramsor and Wootton, while the north is more gently sloped towards the Staffordshire Moorlands district. The ten or more tumuli on or around the Weaver Hills, including Cauldon Low (a peak in the same range just to the east) imply significant prehistoric settlements in the area. About a mile south of the main peak is Wootton Lodge and Wootton Hall, whose claims to fame include that Jean-Jacques Rousseau rented the Hall in 1766. He was a refugee from France, where his revolutionary ideas made life difficult for him. However, the peace and tranquility which had so attracted him to the area nearly drove him mad, because he could not leave his fears behind. Arthur Mee says, Wardlow Quarry Wardlow Quarry.

United States naval gun terminology indicates the gun fired a projectile in diameter, and the barrel was 51 calibers long.Fairfield 1921 p. 156 Description The different marks of the gun were Marks 7, 8, 9, 14, and 15. The built-up gun consisted of a tube, full-length jacket, and single hoop with side swing Welin breech block and Smith-Asbury mechanism for a total weight of about 5 metric tons. Some Marks included a tapered liner. A charge of smokeless powder gave a projectile a velocity of . Range was at the maximum elevation of 20 degrees. Useful life expectancy was 900 effective full charges (EFC) per liner.Campbell 1985 p.136 US service On a US Navy transport ship mid 1942 The 5-inch/51 caliber gun was designed to engage destroyers, torpedo boats, and other surface targets. It entered service in 1911 as secondary armament on the s, with many of the guns being removed soon after commission because they were too wet. Most of the remaining guns were moved to redesigned casemates during the 1927‚Äì1930 refits. Increased awareness of the need for anti-aircraft protection (especially following the attack on Pearl Harbor) encouraged mounting of dual- purpose 5\\"/38 caliber guns in later battleships, and some of the World War I-era battleships were rearmed with 5\\"/38 caliber guns during World War II. Surplus guns from scrapped or disarmed battleships were mounted in United States Coast Guard cutters, auxiliaries, small aircraft carriers, coast defense batteries, and Defensively Equipped Merchant Ships.

The result is a model stronger than ordinary tree walking automata, but still strictly weaker than branching automata. Definitions A pebble automaton is a tree walking automaton with an additional finite set of fixed size containing pebbles, identified with \\\\\\\\{ 1, 2, \\\\dots, n \\\\\\\\}. Besides ordinary actions, an automaton can put a pebble at a currently visited node, lift a pebble from the currently visited node and perform a test \\"is the i-th pebble present at the current node?\\". There is an important stack restriction on the order in which pebbles can be put or lifted - the i+1-th pebble can be put only if the pebbles from 1st to i-th are already on the tree, and the i+1-th pebble can be lifted only if pebbles from i+2-th to n-th are not on the tree. Without this restriction, the automaton has undecidable emptiness and expressive power beyond regular tree languages. The class of languages recognized by deterministic (resp. nondeterministic) pebble automata with n pebbles is denoted DPA_{n} (resp. PA_{n}). We also define DPA = \\\\bigcup_{n} DPA_{n} and likewise PA = \\\\bigcup_{n} PA_{n}. Properties *there exists a language recognized by a pebble automaton with 1 pebble, but not by any tree walking automaton; this implies that either TWA \\\\subsetneq DPA or these classes are incomparable, which is an open problem *PA \\\\subsetneq REG, i.e. pebble automata are strictly weaker than branching automata *it is not known whether DPA = PA, i.e. whether pebble automata can be determinized *it is not known whether pebble automata are closed under complementation *the pebble hierarchy is strict, for every n PA_{n} \\\\subsetneq PA_{n+1} and DPA_{n} \\\\subsetneq DPA_{n+1} Automata and logic Pebble automata admit an interesting logical characterization. Let FO+TC denote the set of tree properties describable in transitive closure first-order logic, and FO+\\\\text{pos}\\\\,TC the same for positive transitive closure logic, i.e. a logic where the transitive closure operator is not used under the scope of negation. Then it can be proved that PA \\\\subseteq FO+TC and, in fact, PA = FO+\\\\text{pos}\\\\,TC \\\\- the languages recognized by pebble automata are exactly those expressible in positive transitive closure logic.

These can be classified as either biotic or abiotic on the basis of their origin. The landmass and the territorial waters of Cambodia contain a rather moderate amount, array and variety of resources. Apart from water, abiotic resources, such as minerals are generally rare. Still, advanced geo- scientific technologies have produced remarkable results and re-assessments in recent years, such as the localization of offshore oil and gas depots in the Gulf of Thailand. Cambodia, on the other hand possesses a relatively wide range of biotic resources, in particular timber, forest products, rare plants and a fauna of great diversity. Weathering Cambodia comprises an undulating plateau in its eastern part, a continuous flat plain (the Lake Tonle Sap lowland) interrupted only by isolated hills (Phnoms) and the Mekong River in the central part of the country, highlands to the north and northeast and the Cardamom Mountains in the south-west. The agricultural area was estimated at in 2009, with estimated cultivated areas totaling . 96% of this area was used for annual crops and 3.8% for permanent crops. Water The Cambodian hydro- logical system is dominated by the Mekong River and Tonle Sap Great Lake. From July to the end of October, when the level of the Mekong is high, water flows via the Tonle Sap River, increasing the size of the lake from 2,600 km2 to about at its maximum extent. The storage capacity of Tonle Sap Great Lake is about . When the level of the Mekong decreases, the Tonle Sap River reverses its flow and water flows back from the Tonle Sap Lake into the Mekong River. The Mekong flows from north to south, over a distance of around 480 km. About 86% of Cambodia‚Äôs territory () is included in the Mekong‚Äôs basin with the remaining 14% draining directly towards the Gulf of Thailand. Cambodia represents 20% of the total catchment area of the Mekong basin. Total internal renewable water resources have been estimated at over . =Hydroelectric power= The country's hydroelectric generating potential is considerable, especially from the swift current of the middle Mekong River where it flows through the Stoeng Treng and Kracheh provinces. Other sites of minor importance are on rivers in the highlands of the northeastern and north- central parts of the country. Although the Tonle Sap is Cambodia's dominant hydraulic feature, the rivers flowing into this great lake have little or no exploitable potential. In general, development of the country's water potential appears to be more important for the expansion of irrigation than for the production of electricity. The largest hydroelectric dam in Cambodia is Lower Se San 2 Dam which began operation in November 2017 and scheduled for full operation by October 2018. Stung Treng Dam is a proposed hydroelectric dam with an average production of 4,870 GWh per year, almost 2.5 times the average production of Lower Se San 2. Forests The forests of Cambodia include evergreen, semi-evergreen, deciduous, swamp, mangrove and bamboo forest in various conditions from closed to disturbed and mosaic formations. There are also re-growth and plantation forests as well as open forest types including evergreen shrub land and dry deciduous shrub land. About 10% of Cambodia‚Äôs flora is endemic. Cover is largely dominated by moist lowland evergreen forest, semi-evergreen forest and deciduous forest. A unique seasonally inundated forest is found along the flood plains surrounding the Tonle Sap Lake. Extensive and fairly intact mangroves are found along the southern marine coast. forests, which cover approximately 70 percent of the country and which potentially constitute a second pillar of the economy in addition to the primary one, agriculture. A survey in the 1960s disclosed that Cambodia had more than 130,000 square kilometres of forests that contained many species of tropical growth and trees but not teak or other valuable sources of hardwood. Some destruction of the forest environment undoubtedly occurred in the war that followed in the 1970s, but its extent has not been determined. Most of the heavy fighting took place in areas uncovered by dense tropical jungle. As of late 1987, forest resources had not yet been fully exploited because of poor security in the countryside and a lack of electrical and mechanical equipment, such as power tools and lumber trucks. Nevertheless, the Cambodian government reportedly has discussed with Vietnam the possibility of coordinated reforestation programs. =Timber= Timber and firewood are the main forest products. Timber is considered one of the four economic initiatives of the government's First Plan. Timber production was projected to reach a peak of 200,000 cubic meters in 1990. However, timber production is employing underage children according to the Bureau of International Labor Affairs' List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced LaborList of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor and the percentage of working children aged 5 to 14 years old has reached 85% in the agricultural sector. Timber production has also had an important role in Cambodia's deforestation. Biodiversity and wildlife Cambodia is one of the most biodiverse countries in South East Asia. In 2010, the MoE submitted its Fourth National Report to the Convention on Biological Diversity (MoE/CBD, 2010) which includes information on overall biodiversity status, trends and threats; national strategies and action plans, and; an assessment of cross-sectoral integration of biodiversity considerations. Energy The main energy source in Cambodia is wood, accounting for 80% of national energy consumption (UNEP, 2010). Most households, even in urban areas, rely on traditional energy sources since fossil fuels are either not available or too expensive. 94% of the population living in rural areas relies on wood, charcoal, car batteries and kerosene (UNCDF, 2010). Most primitive fuels are sourced from forests; in rural areas in the form of fuel wood and in towns and cities as charcoal. The UNDP forecasts that wood-derived fuels will remain the main source of cooking energy in rural areas until 2030. Mineral resources ruby gemstone Cambodia's mineral resources are moderate and as a result the mining and quarry industry contributed only 0.39% of Cambodia's gross domestic product in 2005. The sector employed an estimated 19,000 people and accounted for only 0.2% of the country's total employment in 2005. Mineral resources of significance, includes: * Gemstones - Gemstone areas - Rubies, sapphires, and zircons - are located in Samlot district of Battambang, Paillin, Ratanakkiri, and Takeo Province. * Iron ore - Hermatite (Fe203); Magnetite (Fe304); Limonite (2Fe203, 3H2O) - was found In the late 1950s and throughout the 1960s, however by Chinese experts in two areas, one located in Phnom Deck and the others located in Koh Keo of Preah Vihear Province, and Thalaborivath of Stung Treng Province. According to General Department of Mineral, the total iron reserves in Phnom Deck area are estimated at 5-6 million tons and possible reserves of high-grade iron ore, ranging from 2.5 million to 4.8 million tons, exist in the northern part of the country. * Gold - Gold deposits are to be found in the four provinces: Kampong Cham (The Rumchek in Memot area), Kampong Thom (Phnom Chi area), Preah Vihear (Phnom Deck in Roveing district), Ratanakiri (Oyadav district) and Mondulkiri. * Bauxite ‚Äì was found in * Manganese (Mn) - Chinese explorations revealed manganese ore reserves, estimated at about 120,000 tons, in Kampong Thom Province. * Phosphates - A few thousand tons of phosphate are extracted annually in Kampot Province and processed locally or in Battambang Province. * Coal - is found in Phum Talat on the east side of the Tonle San River, Stung Treng Province. There are 27 individual coal seams identified with a reserve of 7 million tons of coal. * Limestone * ClayCosslett, Tuyet L. \\"Natural Resources\\" (and subsections).

Oil and natural gas In late 1969, the Cambodian government granted a permit to a French company to explore for petroleum in the Gulf of Thailand. By 1972 none had been located, and exploration ceased when the Khmer Republic (see Appendix B) fell in 1975. Subsequent oil and gas discoveries in the Gulf of Thailand and in the South China Sea, however, could spark renewed interest in Cambodia's offshore area, especially because the country is on the same continental shelf as its Southeast Asian oil-producing neighbors.

The 120th is equipped with the F-16C/D Fighting Falcon. The squadron is a descendant organization of the World War I 120th Aero Squadron, established on 28 August 1917. It was reformed on 27 June 1923, as the 120th Observation Squadron, and is one of the 29 original National Guard Observation Squadrons of the United States Army National Guard formed before World War II. The 120th Fighter Squadron was the first federally recognized Air National Guard unit, receiving this distinction on 30 June 1946. Thus, their motto is, \\"First in the Air Guard.\\" Overview The current mission of the 120th is to operate at the highest levels of military and domestic policy protecting the midwest America and Operation Enduring Freedom. Also the 120th Fighter squadron has deployed five times in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, most recently to Joint Base Balad, Iraq in 2010. The 120th has also supported an Air Expeditionary Forces deployment in the Pacific region and multiple National Special Security Events, such as the Democratic National Convention in 2008, in Denver, Colorado. History = World War I= The 120th Fighter Squadron dates its origins to the 120th Aero Squadron, organized at Kelly Field, Texas on 6 August 1917. In July 1917, the men of the squadron were first organized at Fort Thomas, Kentucky where the recruits, about 160 of the, were sent to Kelly Field. There the squadron was placed into indoctrination training, learning infantry drill and also attended the airplane instruction school. On 1 November, the squadron was ordered to Ellington Field, Houston, Texas. Upon arrival, the squadron was ordered to begin the work of operating the field for the Air Service. A civilian construction firm, the American Construction Company, Houston, was contracted to put up the Hangars and make the place habitable. The first duty of the squadron was to assemble about 100 airplanes, and put them in a flyable condition for use as training planes.Gorrell On 30 January 1918, the squadron was ordered for overseas duty and moved to the Aviation Concentration Center, Garden City, Long Island. There the squadron was equipped for overseas duty. On 16 February, the squadron, was ordered to report to the Port of Entry, Hoboken, New Jersey for boarding on the former Cunard Liner RMS Carmania for transport. After an uneventful Atlantic crossing, it arrived at Liverpool, England on 4 March. The next day the squadron was moved to the American Rest Camp Romsey, near Winchester, England. There, the squadron was attached to the Royal Flying Corps for additional training, and on 9 March, it boarded a train, reporting to the RFC No. 1 Observer's School of Aerial Gunnery, RFC New Romney, Kent. There, the squadron trained with the British soldiers at the station, maintained the camp and performed airplane maintenance. This work continued until 9 August when orders were given for the squadron to divide into Flights. \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" Flights were ordered to RFC Stamford, England, while \\"C\\" Flight was ordered to RNAS Crail, Scotland. This meant that the squadron had completed its training in England and was ready for duty at the front. After about a month of final training, the squadron was re-combined at Southampton for transfer to France. Men of the 120th Aero Squadron, 2d Air Instructional Center (2d AIC), Tours Aerodrome, France, November 1918. After a cross-channel crossing on the S.S. Archangel, the squadron arrived at Le Havre, France on 3 September, and took a train to the Replacement Concentration Center, AEF, St. Maixent Replacement Barracks, France, arriving on 6 September 1918. After processing, the squadron was ordered to report to the 2d Air Instructional Center (2d AIC), Tours Aerodrome, in central France. This came as a great disappointment to the squadron, as it was prepared to serve on the front, however, as the squadron has almost no experience in the French biplanes used at the front, it was felt it could do better work at the training center. At the 2d AIC, the men of the 120th were assigned to nearly every department at the field, in the machine shops working on aircraft to the transportation department where the men drove trucks and all manner of vehicles. A great many of the men were not fitted for the jobs assigned and required training in order to be of useful service. The squadron remained at 2d AIC until after the Armistice with Germany in November 1918, then returned to the United States via Bordeaux, France, in April 1918, arriving at Mitchel Field, New York on 6 May 1919. It then was moved to Kelly Field, Texas, where it was demobilized on 17 May 1919 and the men were returned to civilian life. =Interwar period= mascot, Jeff (equipped with a parachute), circa 1924. On 27 June 1923 the 120th Aero Observation Squadron, 45th Division, Aviation was mustered into service as part of the Colorado Army National Guard. Initially composed of eight officers and 50 enlisted members, the unit flew Curtiss JN-4Es (better known as Jennies) ‚Äì an aircraft which proved to be unsuitable for flying at Denver elevations. One year later, the 120th began flying out of Lowry Field. The brand new airfield was named in honor of 2nd Lt. Francis B. Lowry who was shot down and killed near Crepion, France in 1918 while on a photographic mission. Nonetheless, the men of the 120th persevered flying the Jennies just before sunrise and after sunset, when the air was less turbulent. In later years, they would transition through a variety of more powerful observation aircraft such as the Douglas 0-2, Consolidated 0-17, and Douglas 0-38. The unit eventually started flying the 0-47 ‚Äì a three-seat, all-metal, single-engine aircraft ‚Äì that took the unit into World War II. Mobilization for World War II took place on 6 January 1941, 11 months prior to the bombing of Pearl Harbor. The unit, then 19 officers and 116 enlisted members, moved to Biggs Field, Texas. During World War II the squadron supported ground units in training by flying reconnaissance, artillery adjustment, fighter, and bomber missions, and in the process trained reconnaissance personnel who later served overseas. Patrolled the Mexican border from March‚ÄìJuly 1942. Disbanded on 30 November 1943. = Colorado Air National Guard= 120th Fighter Squadron P-51 Mustangs, 1946 The wartime 120th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron was reconstituted on 21 June 1945. It was then re-designated as the 120th Fighter Squadron, and was allotted to the Colorado Air National Guard, on 24 May 1946. It was organized at Buckley Field (A sub-base of Lowry AFB), Colorado and was extended federal recognition on 30 June 1946 by the National Guard Bureau. The 120th Fighter Squadron was bestowed the history, honors, and colors of the previous 120th TRS. The 146th Fighter Squadron was the first Air National Guard unit to obtain federal recognition. It squadron was equipped with F-51D Mustangs and was allocated to the 140th Fighter Group, 86th Fighter Wing, Colorado Air National Guard. As part of the Continental Air Command Fourth Air Force, the unit trained for tactical fighter missions and air-to-air combat. In 1947, shortly after World War II, the 120th TFS organized an aerial demonstration team called the \\"Minute Men.\\" This team was federally recognized in 1956, making it the first and only Air National Guard precision aerial demonstration team. Headed by Col. Walt Williams, the team performed in more than 100 air shows for more than three million people in 47 states and five foreign countries before being disbanded in favor of a federal team of Air Force pilots, the U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds. The Minute Men flew the F-86F-2 GunVal version of the Sabre Jet. Korean War activation As a result of the Korean War, the 120th and its parent, the 140th Fighter Wing was federalized and brought to active duty on 1 April 1951. The unit was ordered to the new Clovis Air Force Base, New Mexico, which arrived in October 1951. The federalized 140th was a composite organization of activated Air National Guard units, composed of the 120th, the 187th Fighter Squadron (Wyoming ANG) and the 190th Fighter Squadron (Utah ANG). The 140th and its components were equipped with F-51D Mustangs, and were re-designated as Fighter-Bomber squadrons on 12 April 1951. During their period of federal service, many pilots were sent to Japan and South Korea to reinforce active-duty units. At Clovis, elements of the 140th FBW took part in Operation Tumbler-Snapper ‚Äì 1952, a nuclear bomb test in Nevada. On 15 November 1952, the elements of the 140th returned to Air National Guard control in their respective states. Cold War Minute Men aerobatics team c1958 Upon return to Colorado state control, the 120th was re-equipped by Tactical Air Command with F-80C Shooting Star jets. On 1 July 1955, the squadron was re-designated as the 120th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, with its parent 140th FIW being assigned to the 34th Air Division, Air Defense Command. In 1958, the 140th FIW implemented the ADC Runway Alert Program, in which interceptors of the 120th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron were committed to a five-minute runway alert. In 1960 the F-86s were again replaced by the F-86L Sabre Interceptor, a day/night/all-weather aircraft designed to be integrated into the ADC SAGE interceptor direction and control system. Tactical Air Command/Vietnam War 120th FS F-100C 54-1836 at Phan Rang AB, South Vietnam, 1968. Note Vietnam War Tail Code \\"VS\\" \\"D\\" Huns on the Buckley's flightline, Apr 1974 120th Tactical Fighter Squadron A-7D 71-341, about 1988 The 140th was transferred back to Tactical Air Command in January 1961, the squadron being re-designated as the 120th Tactical Fighter Squadron. In 1968, While flying the F-100C Super Sabre in Vietnam, the unit became the first guard unit activated and deployed for one year to southeast Asia. As part of the 35th Tactical Fighter Wing, Phan Rang AB, the squadron flew primarily ground support missions, and beat back many enemy attacks on American and South Vietnamese ground units. The 140th also performed interdiction, visual and armed reconnaissance, strike assessment photography, escort, close and direct air support, and rapid reaction alert. The 120th earned the United States Air Force Outstanding Unit Award with the \\"V\\" device for valor during the conflict by flying over 6,000 combat missions. After returning from Vietnam, the Guard was upgraded with the D-model of the F-100 Super Sabre. The LTV A-7D Corsair II replaced the F-100 in April 1974 and the aircraft was flown to victory as the \\"World Champions\\" in the inaugural \\"Gunsmoke\\" competition held at Nellis Air Force Base in 1981. The 120th converted to the Lockheed-Martin F-16C Falcon in 1992 and won the Air Force Association award for the Outstanding Air National Guard Unit in 2001. Modern era The A-7Ds were operated until March 1992 when the Wing converted to Block 30 F-16C/Ds Fighting Falcons, and the Corsairs were retired to Davis-Monthan AFB. Today the 120th FS is a dual-purpose fighter squadron with pilots qualified to perform air-to-air and air-to-ground missions including Offensive Counter-Air (OCA), Defensive Counter-Air (DCA), OCA Interdiction, Close Air Support (CAS), and Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) missions. With the addition of the LITENING II and SNIPER targeting pod and the latest software upgrades, the 120th pilots are able to employ precision guided GPS and Laser-guided weapons with deadly accuracy. The 120th Fighter Squadron has participated in many exercises when not deployed to support real world contingency operations as part of the United States Air Force's Total Force. These exercises include joint multi-national training with the Royal Australian Air Force in Australia, TEAM SPIRIT in Korea, Tactical Fighter Weaponry in Denmark, Maple Flag in Canada, Cope Thunder in Alaska, Sentry Aloha in Hawaii, The Joint CRUZEX V Operation(Cruzeiro do sul ‚Äì Southern Cross ) in Brazil in 2010, with the Brazilian Air Force, the Arm√©e de l'Air (France Air force), and many others air forces from South America, and observers of some many other countries of the NATO (this is the most big aerial operation in the South America), and countless other exercises within the United States. In February 2003, the 120th FS mobilized and deployed to a still classified location just outside of Iraq's borders, in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. While deployed with sixteen aircraft and over 30 pilots, the 120th flew over 500 combat sorties, 2500 hours and dropped over 350 precision guided weapons while successfully preventing the launch of any Theatre Ballistic Missiles in their area of responsibility. All personnel and jets returned safely during the summer, 2003. The unit has since redeployed to Iraq in the summer of 2004, as well as during the holidays in 2007‚Äì2008, and in the Summer of 2009 in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. In 2005, the 120th won back the \\"Spirit Trophy\\" in the Tiger Meet of the Americas Competition. The 120th is an honorary member of the NATO Tiger Association.[120th Fighter Squadron, Buckley AFB http://www.natotigers.org/tiger-units/120th-figter-squadron] =Lineage= 120th FIS Minute Men aerial demonstration team emblem * Organized as 120th Aero Squadron on 28 August 1917 : Re-designated 120th Aero Squadron (Service) on 1 September 1917 : Demobilized on 17 May 1919 * Reconstituted and consolidated (1936) with 120th Observation Squadron which, having been allotted to Colorado NG, was activated on 27 June 1923 : Ordered to active service on 6 January 1941 : Re-designated: 120th Observation Squadron (Medium) on 13 January 1942 : Re-designated: 120th Observation Squadron on 4 July 1942 : Re-designated: 120th Reconnaissance Squadron (Fighter) on 2 April 1943 : Re- designated: 120th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron on 11 August 1943 : Disbanded on 30 November 1943. * Reconstituted on 21 June 1945 : Re-designated 120th Fighter Squadron, and allotted to Colorado ANG, on 24 May 1946 : Extended federal recognition on 30 June 1946 : Federalized and placed on active duty, 1 April 1951 : Re-designated: 120th Fighter-Bomber Squadron on 12 April 1951 : Released from active duty and returned to Colorado state control, 15 November 1952 : Re-designated: 120th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron on 1 July 1960 : Re-designated: 120th Tactical Fighter Squadron on 1 January 1961 : Federalized and placed on active duty, 26 January 1968 : Released from active duty and returned to Colorado state control, 30 April 1969 : Re-designated: 120th Fighter Squadron on 15 March 1992 : Designated: 332d Expeditionary Fighter Squadron* when deployed as part of Air and Space Expeditionary units. *Note: The 332d Expeditionary Fighter Squadron is a \\"dummy\\" designation used to refer to Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve Command F-16 units deployed to Balad AB, Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom (2003‚Äì2011).

Childhood and training He was born in Tempio Pausania, Sassari in Sardinia, to Pietro Angelo Menzio, a high school teacher, and Augusta Pic, both originally from Piedmont. He and his five siblings spent their childhood following the father in his frequent work moves. They moved to L'Aquila, when Augusta, the mother, died in 1902. They finally settled in Turin in 1912, where Pietro Angelo married his second wife Argia Avetrani. In Turin, Francesco completed his high school and enrolled for a year at the Accademia Albertina di Belle Arti, after which he completed his art training by himself. He served in the Army in the Infantry Battalion during the first World War, among the last young men drafted in combat, the so-called \\"Ragazzi del '99\\" (\\"The boys from 1899\\"). Career =Early years= Upon his return home, he dedicated himself entirely to painting, entering in contact with Felice Casorati who would help him greatly in the years to come. In 1921, he participated in an exhibition held at the Mole Antonelliana, organized against the more conservative show of the \\"Societ√° Promotrice delle Belle Arti\\" on display yearly at the Parco del Valentino. In 1922 he was invited to show at the \\"Esposizione Artistica Piemontese-Sarda\\" in the town of Alessandria, where he exhibited a self-portrait (Autoritratto, 1922, now in the Civic Museum). In the year that follows he showed extensively in local and national venues such as the Quadriennale in Turin in 1923, the II Biennale in Rome and the Exhibition of Twenty Italian Artists at Galleria Pesaro in Milan in 1924 and in 1925 at the ‚ÄúPromotrice‚Äù in Turin, where he exhibited the Portrait of the Sister (Ritratto della sorella, 1925, now in the Gallery of Modern Art in Turin Galleria d'Arte Moderna di Torino). In 1926 he was invited for the first time to show in the Venice Biennale and soon after at the First \\"Mostra del Novecento\\" and at the \\"Esposizione delle vedute di Torino\\" (\\"The Exhibition of Landscapes of Turin\\"). In 1927 he displayed 18 paintings in the \\"Exposition d‚Äôartistes italiens contemporains\\" (\\"Exhibition of Contemporary Italian Artists\\") in Geneva with an introduction written by Giacomo Debenedetti. During this period, he cultivated relationships with individuals such as Edoardo Persico; Lionello and Adolfo Venturi; Piero Gobetti (who would die soon after) and his wife Ada Prospero; Mario Soldati; Alfredo Casella; Roberto Longhi; and Riccardo Gualino (who would help the painter economically until the advent of fascism). Thanks to Riccardo Gualino who sponsored the \\"Teatro di Torino\\" and Gigi Chessa who designed sets, Menzio got to know foreign artists such as Igor Stravinsky, Sergei Diaghilev and members of the Habima Theater that expanded his vision above the marginality of the Italian art of those years. Gualino's patronage allowed Menzio to visit Paris in 1927, where he established his studio in rue Falgui√®re. He was influenced by Matisse, Bonnard, and Dufy and adopted a post-Impressionist style. In 1928 he participated in the \\"Exposition of Italian painters\\", at the \\"XIV√®me Salon de L'escalier\\". At the end of 1928 he was invited again to participate in the Venice Biennale. Mario Soldati reviewed his work in a September 4, 1928, article in La Stampa. In 1929 Menzio resolved to break with the traditional poetics and together with Jessie Boswell, Gigi Chessa, Nicola Galante, Carlo Levi and Enrico Paulucci, they founded the \\"Gruppo dei Sei\\" (\\"Group of the Six\\") looking for an intellectual freedom and independence criticizing the rising fascist ideology. The group first exhibited at Galleria d'Arte Guglielmi in Turin in January 1929, and soon Menzio had there his first personal exhibition, introduced by Edoardo Persico. In the following months he participated in all of the exhibitions of the \\"Gruppo dei Sei\\" (at ‚ÄúCircolo della Stampa‚Äù in Genoa and Galleria Bardi in Milan in 1929). After the showcase at the Venice Biennale in 1930, in which Menzio was personally attacked by the fascist establishment, and following a series of international exhibitions at Bloomsbury Gallery in London in 1930, at the Galerie Jeune Europe in Paris and at the Quadriennale in Rome in 1931, the Gruppo dei Sei was dissolved. In the following years, Menzio's work developed a personal expression; some examples are \\"Interno\\" (\\"Interior\\"), now at the Galleria d'Arte Moderna di Torino and \\"Cappello blu\\", exhibited at the Royal Palace in Milan in 1929, works that showed soft brush strokes and \\"forms that vanished in the light\\". Other works such as \\"Nudo Rosa\\" or \\"Figura (con cappello)\\" (1929; now in private collections, Turin) or \\"Corridore podista\\" (1930) show the influence of Henry Matisse and Amedeo Modigliani. Between 1930 and 1931 Menzio continued his personal investigation, marked by experimentalism and restlessness, elements that were present in some paintings such as \\"Natura morta con ciliegie\\" (1931; in the Galleria d'Arte Moderna della citt√° di Torino), where the rigorous and essential composition is substituted by objects that had restless and defined colors and outlines. Between 1934 and 1935 he created the frescos in the Psychiatric Hospital of Collegno and inside the Church. In 1936 he installed a room at the Venice Biennale dedicated to his friend Gigi Chessa, who had died the year before of phthisis. In 1938 he married Gigi Chessa‚Äôs widow, Ottavia Cabutti, who already had two children: Luciana and Mauro Chessa. Together they had three more: Paolo, Silvia (who died in infancy in 1942), and Eva. In 1937 he had a solo show in 1937 at the Galleria del Milione in Milan; in 1938, at the Galleria della Cometa in Rome and at the 21st Biennale in Venice. =1930s‚Äì1940s= In 1942, Menzio's family was staying at Felice Carena's house in San Domenico di Fiesole when the bombardment of the town began. Because of that, the poor health of the newborn Silvia, and of his anti-fascist feelings, he moved the family to the town of Bossolasco, near Turin where Ottavia's family was from. Soon after, Silvia died of pulmonary tuberculosis. The same year he started a collaboration as an illustrator with the publisher Giulio Einaudi, for whom he designed covers for the series of \\"Narratori Stranieri Tradotti\\" NST and the \\"Universale Economica\\" UE series until 1946. The year ended with Menzio winning the prestigious \\"Premio Bergamo\\" award with the painting \\"La famiglia\\" (\\"The Family\\"). In 1945, right after the liberation, Menzio moved back to Turin where he established, together with Luigi Einaudi, Massimo Mila, Franco Antonicelli, Norberto Bobbio, Cesare Pavese, Ludovico Geymonat, and Natalia Ginzburg the \\"Unione Culturale\\" (\\"Cultural Union\\") of which he was the first President. He took an active role in the civil and cultural reconstruction of the postwar city, organizing art initiatives and promoting film and theatre events. In 1946 he designed the set for Woyzeck by Georg B√ºchner, the first theatre event in Turin after the war. =Later years= In the succeeding years Menzio immersed himself in painting. In 1956, together with Felice Casorati, he was commissioned to paint a fresco depicting the Life of Santa Caterina for the church of San Domenico in Cagliari and in 1958 with the help of his student Piero Martina he painted the ceiling of the Great Hall of the University of Genoa. In 1951 he started teaching painting at the Accademia Albertina in Turin, and the same year he was awarded the Prize of the Italian Republic given personally by the President of the Italian Republic and friend Luigi Einaudi (\\"Premio del Presidente della Repubblica\\"). In 1960 he was elected National Academician by the Accademia Nazionale di San Luca in Rome. Francesco Menzio died in Turin on 28 November 1979, and is buried with his wife Ottavia Cabutti in Bossolasco.

The 200th is equipped with the C-21A Learjet. Overview The 200th Airlift Squadron (AS) provided secure priority airlift from 1946 to 2018 for the highest level of military and civilian leaders throughout the world. History Established with the assignment of the C-47 Skytrain to Buckley Field Base Operations section in 1946. The C-47 was the original \\"Flintstone Airlines\\". The C-54 Skymaster (Flintstone II) replaced the C-47 in 1966. Flintstone I and II provided airlift for state emergencies, unit deployments and general requirements of both the Colorado Army and Air National Guard. The C-131 Samaritan eventually replaced the C-54 and Buckley Base Operations controlled both the C-131 and Cessna O-2 Skymaster aircraft. In 1979 two Boeing T-43A Bobcats arrived at Buckley and replaced the C-131 and O-2s. The unit was renamed Operating Location AA (OL-AA) and T-43s served as flying classrooms in support of the U.S. Air Force Academy (USAFA) 50th Airmanship Training Squadron Airmanship Program from 1979 through 1997. On 1 July 1983, while under the command of Lt. Col. Mel Walden, the unit separated from other base operations functions and was re-designated Operating Location BB (OL-BB). In October 1985 the unit received two CT-43As configured for passenger airlift, augmenting and expanding into a dual Operational Support Aircraft (OSA) supporting VIP missions. In addition to the USAFA Airmanship Program, the unit flew worldwide airlift missions supporting many dignitaries including the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, U.S. cabinet members, congressmen, ambassadors, and the Chief of Staff of the Air Force. Added two additional CT-43As in 1981. In January 1986, Lt. Col. Ron Germano took command and the unit was designated Detachment One, Headquarters Colorado Air National Guard (Det-1, COANG). Transferred CT-43s to other organizations in 1991. In June 1992 the unit was designated the 200th Airlift Squadron (AS) and in November 1997, it received the first of two C-21A aircraft; T-43As to Randolph AFB in 1997. Replaced with C-26B turboprops transferred from the 201st Airlift Squadron (DC ANG) in 1996. Lt. Col. Scott Schofield took command on 6 March 1999 at Buckley Air National Guard Base, and the 200th AS moved to Peterson AFB in April 1999 near USAFA in Colorado Springs. After the 11 September 2001 attacks, the squadron transported emergency responders to New York and Washington D.C., and began a new mission as target aircraft for NORAD air defense exercises. The 200th AS also supported USNORTHCOM disaster relief missions after hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. On 23 March 2006, an inter-fly agreement with the active-duty 311th Airlift Squadron was signed and the 375th Operations Group began Total Force Operations. With the inter-fly agreement, the two squadrons share jets, pilots, and deployments. In February 2010, the 200 AS participated in its first combat deployment, sending six crewmembers to the CENTCOM AOR in support of Operations IRAQI FREEDOM and ENDURING FREEDOM. Since then, several more 200 AS crewmembers have deployed and the unit continues to support and augment the active duty in-theater mission. After a long and decorated history, the 200th held a formal deactivation ceremony Oct. 14, 2018, presided over by Gov. John Hickenlooper on Buckley AFB, Aurora, Colorado. Prior to the official deactivation in June 2018, the 200th has won Joint Operational Support Airlift Center small unit award seven years in a row. The U.S. Air Force transferred one of the aircraft to Andrews AFB, with the other transferring to Scott AFB for the C-21 enterprise consolidation.

The station is owned by John Linder and operated from the KMHL/KKCK studios in Marshall. From 1982‚Äì2019, KKCK was on FM 99.7 MHz, but moved to FM 94.7 MHz on April 3, 2019. History =First three decades on 99.7= The station first signed on in 1975 as KMHL-FM (100.1) with a country music format, before switching to Top 40 (CHR) in 1982. KKCK debuted automated with TM Programming's \\"Stereo Rock\\" Top 40 format briefly, then converted to fully local programming in the mid-1980s. After the call letter change to KKCK in 1982, the station changed its slogan to \\"KK100,\\" also known as \\"Double K 100.\\" KKCK later changed its name to \\"Fun 100\\" in the mid-1980s. In 1988, it adopted \\"FM 100 KKCK\\" as its slogan after upgrading from 3,000 watts at 100.1 FM to 100,000 watts at 99.7 FM. The station repositioned as \\"99-7 KKCK\\" with the \\"Always A Better Music Mix\\" slogan in 1992. The station had significant listenership in the Sioux Falls, South Dakota market during the 1990s, despite its transmitter tower being located over 50 miles away, as it was the de facto Top 40/CHR for Sioux Falls until KKLS-FM flipped to \\"Hot 104.7\\" in 1997. While KKCK continues to be a minor factor in the Sioux Falls market, the station primarily focuses on Marshall, Minnesota, the surrounding southwestern Minnesota region, and the nearby Brookings, South Dakota area. Unlike most Top 40/CHR formatted stations, KKCK had flexibility to introduce new music to listeners (including, but not limited to, Top 40 (CHR), Rhythmic, Dance Radio/EDM, and Mainstream Urban) as well as included genres such as indie, alternative, modern rock/active rock, and Hot AC/Modern AC including those genres' new music in its music mix. The station also aired The Shag, a long running alternative rock program, on Sunday nights. It shares a local news department with KMHL, and gets national news from ABC. A large amount of the broadcasting day was live, KKCK is regarded as a \\"heritage\\" Top 40/CHR station, thanks in part to its longevity in the format. A winter storm damaged KKCK's transmitter in December 2015, and the station has been broadcasting at reduced power since. In May 2017, KKCK's programming moved to 94.7 KNSG while the transmitter is being rebuilt. =Frequency Swap with 94.7= On October 16, 2017, KNSG changed their call letters to KARZ.KARZ & KNSG Swap Locations Radioinsight - October 17, 2017 On April 3, 2019 KKCK and its top 40/CHR format moved to the more eastern signal of the Springfield licensed 94.7 FM, swapping frequencies with classic hits- formatted KARZ, which moved to the larger coverage area, and the more western signal, of 99.7 FM Marshall.KARZ & KKCK Swap Frequencies Radioinsight - April 3, 3019 KARZ plays many of the songs now included in the classic hits format during KKCK's early years as a top 40/CHR.

Life  From 1946 to 1969 Mayr√∂cker was an English teacher at several public schools in Vienna. In 1969 she took a release from working as a teacher and in 1977 she retired early. She started writing as a 15-year-old. In 1946, she meet Otto Basil who published some of her first works in his avant-garde journal Plan. Mayr√∂cker's poems were published a few years later by renowned literary critic Hans Weigel. She was eventually introduced to the Wiener Gruppe, a group of mostly surrealist and expressionist Austrian authors. Friederike Mayr√∂cker is recognized as one of the most important contemporary Austrian poets. She also had success with her prose and radio plays. Four of them she wrote together with Ernst Jandl, with whom she lived together from 1954 until his death in 2000. Her prose is often described as autofictional, since Mayr√∂cker uses quotes of private conversations and excerpts from letters and diaries in her work. Mayr√∂cker describes her working process as follows: \\"I live in pictures. I see everything in pictures, my complete past, memories are pictures. I transform pictures into language by climbing into the picture.

Some Muslim clerics, such as Sheikh Prof. Abdul Hadi Palazzi, Director of the Cultural Institute of the Italian Islamic Community, and Imam Dr Muhammad Al-Hussaini believe that the return of the Jews to the Holy Land, and the establishment of Israel, are in accordance with teachings of Islam. Some Muslim supporters of Israel consider themselves Muslim Zionists. Notable people with a Muslim background who publicly support Zionism include ex-Muslim Nemat Sadat, former radical Islamist Ed Husain, Dr. Tawfik Hamid, Tashbih Sayyed, a Pakistani- American scholar, journalist, and author, and the journalist Salah Choudhury. Additional Muslim people who voiced public support for Israel included figures such as Irshad Manji, Salim Mansur, Abdurrahman Wahid, Mithal al-Alusi, Kasim Hafeez, Abdullah Saad Al-Hadlaq, Zuhdi Jasser, Khaleel Mohammed, Noor Dahri and Farooq Haider Khan. In the Muslim world, support of Israel is a minority orientation, and supporters of Israel have faced opposition and violence. History =Middle Ages= According to Imam Muhammad Al-Hussaini, traditional Islamic commentators from the 8th and 9th century onwards, such as Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari, have uniformly interpreted the Qur'an to say that the Land of Israel has been given by God to the Jewish people as a perpetual covenant. According to British-based Imam Muhammad Al-Hussaini, traditional commentators from the 8th and 9th century onwards have uniformly interpreted the Qur'an to say explicitly that the Land of Israel has been given by God to the Jewish people as a perpetual covenant. Hussaini bases his argument upon Qur'an 5:21 in which Moses declares: \\"O my people, enter the Holy Land which God has prescribed for you, and turn not back in your traces, to turn about losers.\\" He cites the Qur'an commentator Muhammad ibn Jarir al- Tabari, who says that this statement is \\"a narrative from God... concerning the saying of Moses... to his community from among the children of Israel and his order to them according to the order of God to him, ordering them to enter the holy land.\\" He argued that this promise to the Jews is ever lasting, and further said: \\"It was never the case during the early period of Islam... that there was any kind of sacerdotal attachment to Jerusalem as a territorial claim.\\" This interpretation of the promise to the Jews as ever-lasting is not uniformly accepted by all Islamic commentators According to a translation by the Islamic Law scholar Khaleel Mohammed, Ibn Kathir (1301‚Äì1373) interpreted Qur'an 5:20‚Äì21 using the following terms: \\"'That which God has written for you' i.e. That which God has promised to you by the words of your father Israel that it is the inheritance of those among you who believe.\\" =Early twentieth century= Faisal (right) with Chaim Weizmann (also wearing Arab dress as a sign of friendship) in Syria, 1918. After World War I, the Sharif of Mecca, Hussein bin Ali and his son, the King Feisal of Hijaz and then of Iraq, proclaimed pro-Zionist views. According to Sheikh Prof. Abdul Hadi Palazzi, the Wahhabi position, in contrast, was extremely anti-Zionist. On March 23, 1918, Al Qibla, the daily newspaper of Mecca, printed the following words in support of the Balfour Declaration of 1917, calling upon the Palestine Arabs to welcome the Jews and to cooperate with them: > The resources of the country [Palestine] are still virgin soil and will be > developed by the Jewish immigrants (...) we have seen the Jews from foreign > countries streaming to Palestine from Russia, Germany, Austria, Spain, and > America. The cause of causes could not escape those who had a gift of deeper > insight. They knew that the country was for its original sons [abna'ihi-l- > asliyin], for all their differences, a sacred and beloved homeland. The > return of these exiles [jaliya] to their homeland will prove materially and > spiritually an experimental school for their brethren who are with them in > the fields, factories, trades and all things connected to the land., as > cited by The Arab-Israeli Dilemma, by Fred John Khouri; Syracuse University > Press, 1985, p. 9Palestine, a Twice-promised Land?: The British, the Arabs & > Zionism, 1915‚Äì1920 By Isaiah Friedman, page 171 On 3 January 1919, Hussein's son, king Faisal I of Iraq and Dr. Chaim Weizmann, President of the World Zionist Organization signed the Faisal‚ÄìWeizmann Agreement for Arab-Jewish cooperation, in which Faisal conditionally accepted the Balfour Declaration based on the fulfilment of British wartime promises of development of a Jewish homeland in Palestine and on which subject he stated: As'ad Shukeiri, a Muslim scholar ('alim) of the Acre area, and the father of PLO founder Ahmad Shukeiri, rejected the values of the Palestinian Arab national movement and was opposed to the anti-Zionist movement. He met routinely with Zionist officials and had a part in every pro- Zionist Arab organization from the beginning of the British Mandate, publicly rejecting Mohammad Amin al-Husayni's use of Islam to attack Zionism.. The president of the Muslim National Associations and the mayor of Haifa, Hassan Bey Shukri, voiced support for the Balfour Declaration and for Zionist immigration to British Mandate Palestine. In the 1920s, the Muslim National Associations was established by Muslim Arabs who were employed by the Palestine Zionist Executive. The president of the Muslim National Associations and the mayor of Haifa, Hassan Bey Shukri, has founded the organization with Sheikh Musa Hadeib from the village of Dawaymeh near Hebron and head of the farmers' party of Mt. Hebron. In July 1921, Shukri sent a telegram to the British government, declaring support for the Balfour Declaration and Zionist immigration to British Mandate Palestine: In 1929, Hadeib was murdered in Jerusalem, supposedly for his collaboration with the Zionists. In the late 1930s, Amir Abdullah, ruler of Transjordan, and the pro-Hashemite leader of Syria, Abd al-Rahman Shahabandar, offered the Zionists to create a Jewish autonomy in Palestine under the Transjordanian throne, although they did not propose an independent Jewish state. =Modern times= A number of Muslim groups that have histories of conflict with Arabs, including Kurds and Berbers, have also voiced support for Israel and Zionism. Ramin H. Artin, of the Kurdish-American Education Society, argues that the creation of Israel has been \\"a thorn in the eye of fascists who would rather eliminate the Jewish state\\". He concluded that an Israeli-Kurdish alliance is \\"natural\\", and that sincere mutual respect and recognition of each other's rights can lead to peace and prosperity. Palazzi noted that although in present days support for Israel among Muslims is a minority orientation, there are some exceptions, such as former President of Indonesia and leader of Nahdlatul Ulama, Shaykh Abdurrahman Wahid, and the Grand Mufti of the Russian Federation, Shaykh Talgat Tajuddin, the Mufti of European Russia, Shaykh Salman Farid, who wrote a fatwa against the intifadah. According to Palazzi, more examples for Pro- Israeli Muslim clerics are the Muftis of Chechnya, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. Turkey also supports Israel, being one of the first Muslim countries to recognize Israel. It is also noted that trade between Turkey and Israel has broken records in 2014. Israeli Arab supporters of Israel =Muslim Bedouins= Bedouin IDF soldiers of Rumat al-Heib (ÿπÿ±ÿ® ÿßŸÑŸáŸäÿ®) during a military parade in Tel-Aviv in June 1949. During the 1947‚Äì1949 Palestine war, many Bedouin switched sides to join the Zionist forces in opposing the invasion by the regular Arab armies. Negev Bedouins, a Muslim minority which includes about 12% of Israeli Arabs, tend to identify more as Israelis than other Arab citizens of Israel. Many Negev Bedouins serve in the Israel Defense Forces. Each year, between 5%‚Äì10% of the Bedouin of draft age volunteer for the IDF (unlike Druze and Jewish Israelis, they are not required by law to do so). During the Palestinian Arab national movement's formation, Bedouins often perceived their tribe as their principal focus of identity, and they generally did not view themselves as a component of the emerging Palestinian identity.. Bedouins had long standing ties with nearby Jewish communities. Bedouins of Tuba-Zangariyye helped defend these communities in the 1936‚Äì1939 Arab revolt in Palestine. Formal co-operation between Jews and Bedouin began in 1946, when tribal leader Sheik Hussein Mohammed Ali Abu Yussef of the al-Heib tribe sent more than 60 of his men to fight alongside Zionist forces, forming the Pal- Heib unit of the Haganah. During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, the Pal-Heib unit defended Jewish communities in the Upper Galilee against Syria. Sheik Abu Yussef was quoted in 1948 as saying, \\"Is it not written in the Koran that the ties of neighbors are as dear as those of relations? Our friendship with the Jews goes back many years. We felt we could trust them and they learned from us too\\". Maj Fehd Fallah, a Bedouin from the village of Saad in the Golan Heights said in an interview: \\"Yes, I have fought against Muslims in Gaza,\\" he says. \\"And I would fight again if I had to,\\" he added. \\"Israeli Muslims who don't serve in the IDF should be ashamed for not serving their country.\\" Ismail Khaldi is the first Bedouin deputy consul of Israel and the highest ranking Muslim in the Israeli foreign service. Khaldi is a strong advocate of Israel. While acknowledging that the state of Israeli Bedouin minority is not ideal, he said =Israeli Druze and Circassian Muslims= Druze commander of the IDF Herev battalion. Druze citizens are prominent in the Israel Defense Forces, and a considerable number of Israeli Druze soldiers have fallen in Israel's wars. Background The Circassians in Israel are non-Arab, predominantly Sunni Muslims. The Circassians have had good relations with the Jewish community in Israel since the beginning of the Jewish settlement in the Land of Israel. The Circassian community in Israel helped the illegal immigration (Ha'apala) of Jews into Palestine during the British Mandate and fought on the Israeli side of the 1947‚Äì1949 Palestine war. In 1948, when Israel was created, Circassians of Palestine did not migrate to neighboring countries, but rather made the choice to stay within the borders of the new state and embrace full Israeli citizenship, according to academic Eleonore Merza. Like the Druze population, since 1958 male Circassians perform Israeli mandatory military service upon reaching the age of majority, while females do not. Many Circassians in Israel are employed in the security forces, including in the Border Guard, the Israel Defense Forces, the police and the Israel Prison Service. The percentage of army recruits among the Circassian community in Israel is particularly high. This loyalty to Israel is often considered as an act of betrayal by the Arab Muslims, who see Circassians as traitors to the Ummah. The Druze are a religious community who consider themselves an Islamic Unist, reformatory sect. The Druze consider themselves to be Muslim, although they are considered non-Muslim by the general Islamic community. The Druze mostly do not identify with the cause of Arab nationalism. The bond between Jews and Druze is commonly known by the term \\"a covenant of blood\\". Druze citizens are prominent in the Israel Defense Forces and in politics, and a considerable number of Israeli Druze soldiers have fallen in Israel's wars since the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. Reda Mansour, a Druze poet, historian and diplomat, explained: \\"We are the only non-Jewish minority that is drafted into the military, and we have an even higher percentage in the combat units and as officers than the Jewish members themselves. So we are considered a very nationalistic, patriotic community.\\" In 2008 more than 94% of Druze youngsters classified themselves as \\"Druze-Israelis\\" in the religious and national context. Five Druze lawmakers currently have been elected to serve in the 18th Knesset, a disproportionately large number considering their population. Rafik Halabi, an Israeli Druze television correspondent and former Israeli military officer, characterizes himself as an Israeli patriot. Opening his 1982 book \\"The West Bank Story: An Israel Arab's View of Both Sides of a Tangled Conflict\\", he wrote, \\"I am an Israeli patriot, although I am not a Jew\\". Salman Abu-Salah, from the village Majdal Shams, established the \\"Zionist Druze Club\\" in the Golan in the 1970s and advocated petitioning for Israeli citizenship, even prior to the Israeli annexation of the Golan Heights in 1980. Yusuf Nasr al-Din, who believes that the Arab-Israeli Conflict is a historical struggle between Zionism and Arabism, established the Druze Zionist Movement, recommending that the Druze show solidarity with Israel and adopt the national Zionist ideology of the Jewish people. The Zionist Druze Circle Amal Nasser el-Din, founder of the Zionist Druze Circle and a former member of the Israeli Knesset In 1973, Amal Nasser el-Din founded the Zionist Druze Circle, a group whose aim was to encourage the Druze to support the state of Israel fully and unreservedly. A-Din, a Likud member of the Knesset, has lost his son in the War of Attrition between Israel and Egypt in 1969. In 2007, Nabiah A-Din, the chairman of the forum of the Druze and Circassian authority heads, and head of the Kasra Adia municipality, criticized the \\"multi-cultural\\" Israeli constitution proposed by the Israeli Arab organization Adalah, saying that he finds it unacceptable. \\"The state of Israel is Jewish state as well as a democratic state that espouses equality and elections. We invalidate and reject everything that the Adalah organization is requesting,\\" he said. According to A-din, the fate of Druze and Circassians in Israel is intertwined with that of the state. \\"This is a blood pact, and a pact of the living. We are unwilling to support a substantial alteration to the nature of this state, to which we tied our destinies prior to its establishment,\\" he said. there were 7,000 registered members in the Druze Zionist movement. In 2009, the movement held a Druze Zionist youth conference with 1,700 participants. =Other Arab Israelis identifying with Israel= Major Ala Wahib serves as the highest ranking Muslim officer in the Israel Defense Forces, and originates from the Galillee village of Reineh. He serves as the operations officer at an IDF ground forces training base, and describes himself as a \\"Zionist Israeli Arab\\". Wahib grew up in a society where Holocaust denial was common, but visited Poland while serving in the IDF and was shocked, saying that \\"there was something very powerful in the fact that I was standing on Polish soil, holding an Israeli flag and donning the uniform of the Israeli army, but this time from a position of power.\\" According to Wahib, there are quite a lot of Israeli Arabs who want to enlist, but do not do so since they don't know how this will be accepted by their environment. In regards to being a Muslim, Wahib explained that he believes in the Muslim faith, and will never abandon it, but believes that \\"Zionism... is something that fully represents my sense of belonging to the State of Israel and to Israeli society, and the immense commitment I have to protecting and guarding the country of which I am part.\\" Anett Haskia is another outspoken Muslim supporter of Israel who was born and raised in Akko. A mother of three children who have served in the IDF, she says that Arabs in Israel live better than those living in any Arab state, and states, \\"I was born in Israel, and it is my homeland. I thank God every day that I was born in the Jewish state because of everything that happens in the Arab states in general and Syria, in particular. Not only do I support Israel, I am also willing to sacrifice my family for the existence of this state. You have to understand, Israel is my homeland. Just because I am an Arab Muslim does not mean I will support Arab countries against Israel or identify with a murderous organization like Hamas that wants to destroy my homeland.\\" In 2014, Haskia has joined The Jewish Home, a right-wing political party, aiming to be elected for the Israeli Knesset, and to encourage more Arabs to identify with the state of Israel.Cohen, Moshe; Soffer, Ari. Could an Arab Muslim Woman Become the Newest Jewish Home MK? December 4, 2014 =Acceptance of Israel among Israeli Arabs= A Truman Institute survey from 2005 found that 63% of the Arab citizens accept the principle that Israel is the state of the Jewish people.Ha'aretz, October 2, 2005 In a 2012 survey conducted by the University of Haifa Jewish-Arab Center, \\"Index of Jewish-Arab Relations in Israel 2012\\", 75% of Israeli Arabs stated that Israel has a right to exist as an independent state, and 48% that they could support its existence as a democratic, Jewish state. Notable non-Israeli Muslim supporters of Israel Notable Muslim supporters of Israel include Dr. Tawfik Hamid, a former self-described member of a terror organization and current Islamic thinker and reformer, Sheikh Prof. Abdul Hadi Palazzi, Director of the Cultural Institute of the Italian Islamic Community and self described Muslim Zionist, and Tashbih Sayyed ‚Äì a Muslim Pakistani-American scholar, journalist, author, and self-described Muslim Zionist, Prof. Khaleel Mohammed, Islamic Law scholar of the San Diego State University and Salah Uddin Shoaib Choudhury, a Bangladeshi journalist and publisher, and a self-proclaimed Muslim Zionist. = Australia = Mohammad Tawhidi, an Iranian-born Australian Imam who was made an imam by Ayatollah Sayid Sadiq Shirazi in Qum, Iran in 2010. He holds several licenses from Islamic seminaries and is known for holding contrasting views from other Islamic experts, such as stating his support for Israel and declaring that Palestine is Jewish land. =Afghanistan= Nemat Sadat an Afghan-born, US citizen is the first ex-Muslim gay, atheist and Zionist from Afghanistan. Sadat promotes Israel's right to exist in Afghanistan and calls for establishment of full bilateral Afghan-Israel relations. In an interview with The Voice of Israel, Sadat dubbed himself the \\"Theodr Herzl of Afghanistan\\" and hopes Afghans will unite their war-torn nation inside the country and in exile to become eternal and united like Israel. =Bangladesh= Salah Uddin Shoaib Choudhury, a Bangladeshi journalist and publisher, and a self- proclaimed Muslim Zionist. His newspaper, Weekly Blitz, criticizes the jihad culture and advocates inter-faith understanding between Muslims, Christians and Jews. Choudhury was arrested by Bangladeshi police on November 29, 2003 at Dhaka airport since he was scheduled to fly to Israel, a country Bangladeshi citizens are barred from travelling to. After release from 17-months imprisonment, Choudhury wrote in an Israeli newspaper \\"I also stand before you perhaps as a living contradiction: a Zionist, a defender of Israel, and a devout, practicing Muslim, living in a Muslim country.\\" He said \\"I believe in the justice of the Zionist dream. I also acknowledge this historical reality: that the world has endeavored to crush that dream and, yes, even to destroy the viability of the Jewish people. At the same time, I live in an environment where people believe just as passionately in an opposing view‚Äîone that sees Israel as illegitimate; and the Jewish people as evil incarnate.\\" =Canada= Irshad Manji, a Muslim Canadian author and an advocate of progressive interpretation of Islam, says that the Arabs' failure to accept the Jews' historical bond with Palestine is a mistake. Manji accepts that the Jews' historical roots stretch back to the land of Israel, and recognizes their right to a Jewish state. She further argues that the allegation of apartheid in Israel is deeply misleading, noting that there are in Israel several Arab political parties; that Arab-Muslim legislators have veto powers; and that Arab parties have overturned disqualifications. She also observes that Israel has a free Arab press; that road signs bear Arabic translations; and that Arabs live and study alongside Jews. She accuses Arab countries for the Palestinian refugees' plight, saying that they \\"interfered with every attempt to solve the problem\\" and that they would rather give \\"generous support to suicide bombers and their families\\" rather than help the needy refugees. According to Geneive Abdo, \\"Muslim Zionist\\" is a label which Manji \\"would no doubt accept\\". In 2008, Salim Mansur, a Muslim Canadian Political Scientist, columnist and author, congratulated Israel for its 60th anniversary, and declared that the Jewish state \\"deserves admiration\\". He wrote, \\"Israel is a tiny sliver of land in a vast tempest-ridden sea of the Arab-Muslim world, and yet it is here the ancient world's most enduring story is made fresh again by Jews to live God's covenant with Abraham as told in their sacred literature.\\" In 2010, he wrote: \\"The story of modern Israel, as many have noted, is a miracle unlike any [...] It is a robust and inclusive democracy, and is at the leading edge of science and technology [...] What hypocrites demand of Israelis and the scrutiny Israel is subjected to by them, they would not dare make of any other nation.\\" Tarek Fatah who is born in Pakistan also has pro- Israel views. =Egypt= Dr. Tawfik Hamid, chair for the Study of Islamic Radicalism at the Potomac Institute for Policy Studies, an Egyptian scholar and self-described former member of the militant al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya, said that most Muslims correlate the word Israel in Arabic to the word 'Azra'il that sounds like Israel but means \\"Angel of death\\". This created a link in the minds of most children of Muslims the need to hate the word Israel. In an article titled \\"Why I loved Israel based on the Qur'an\\" he claims that according to the Qur'an, God gave the Israelites the land of Israel as their promised land (Quran 17:104): And We said thereafter to the Children of Israel, \\"Dwell securely in the land of promise\\". He explains the Quran went even further to consider the Promised Land as the permanent inheritance for the Israelites (26:59): \\"Thus it was, but we made the Children of Israel inheritors of such things (the Promised Land)\\" He continued by saying \\"No Muslim has the right to interfere with the gathering of the Jews in Israel, as this is the will of God himself\\". The former Egyptian Muslim nuclear scientist Noha Hashad was arrested multiple times for conducting pro-Jewish Quran research, suffering beatings and torture at the hands of the authorities. During the chaos following the fall of the Mubarak regime in 2011, she managed to escape and fled to Israel. She claims that the Qur'an mentions Jewish rights to the land of Israel in a clear manner. In 2014, she renounced Islam. =France= Rama Yade, a Franco-Senegalese politician who served in the government of France from 2007 to 2010 and the current vice president of the centrist Radical Party, has been described as \\"notoriously pro-Israeli\\". =India= Tufail Ahmad is among the few pro-Israel Muslim intellectuals in India. =Indonesia= Abdurrahman Wahid, Indonesia's president from 1999 until 2001, visited Israel six times, calling for the Islamic world to recognise and acknowledge Israel's right to exist and prosper. Abdurrahman Wahid, Indonesia's president from 1999 until 2001, was criticised for his pro- Israel views. Wahid moved to establish diplomatic and commercial relations with Israel, and visited Israel six times. In a 2002 interview to ABC, Wahid said that the Islamic world should start recognising and acknowledging Israel's right to exist and prosper. He added, \\"I think Muslims are rational and rationality dictates that.\\" In a 2004 interview to an Israeli newspaper, he was asked about his friendship with Israel, which was described as \\"unusual for an Islamic leader\\". Wahid replied, \\"I think there is a wrong perception that Islam is in disagreement with Israel. This is caused by Arab propaganda [...] Israel has a reputation as a nation with a high regard for God and religion ‚Äî there is then no reason we have to be against Israel.\\" According to Wahid, Israel \\"is a democracy in a sea of misunderstanding\\". =Italy= In Italy, Sheikh Prof. Abdul Hadi Palazzi, director of the Cultural Institute of the Italian Islamic Community, represents a unique \\"Muslim Zionist\\", pro- Israel and pro-American position which according to Morten T. H√∏jsgaard, Margit Warburg, although the organization is small in proportions, is a \\"thorn in the side of both moderate and radical Islamic fundamentalists in Italy\\". In 1996, Palazzi and the Israeli scholar Asher Eder co-founded the Islam-Israel Fellowship to promote cooperation between Israel and Muslim nations. Palazzi argues against calls for jihad against Israel and says there is no religious demand for Israel to give up control over Muslim holy places. =Iraq= Mithal al-Alusi, a secular Muslim Iraqi lawmaker, who is openly pro-Israel, paid a heavy price for visiting Israel in September 2004, criticizing Hamas and Hezbollah as terrorist organizations, and advocating peace with the Jewish state. Upon his return to Iraq, the Sunni politician was immediately removed from Ahmed Chalabi's Iraqi National Congress Party (INC). In 2005, apparently as payback, a gunman opened fire on Alusi's car just after it left his house, killing two of his sons, Ayman, 21, and Jamal, 30, while he escaped unharmed.SAMEER N.

In 1979, Mwidau conducted an information campaign among Muslims in the USA, in which he praised Israel's assistance to developing African countries and specifically its assistance to Muslim education in Kenya. His political rivals, led by Sharif Kassir, denounced these activities, calling Mwidau a \\"Zionist agent\\". Mwidau remained in parliament until his death in 1986.Arye Oded.

Responding to a question whether he believed that Muslims have a right to rule Jerusalem, Hadlaq said, \\"On the contrary, verse number 21 of Surat Al-Maeda of the Holy Quran emphasizes the right of 'Bani Israel'\\". He said that Israel's model of democracy is unique and surpassed many of what he described as the \\"tyrannical, totalitarian\\" Arab regimes.Kuwait Times, March 22, 2009 Controversial writer urges Kuwait to accept Israel In his 2008 article, \\"The Right of Self-defense,\\" Al-Hadlaq supported \\"Israel's right to defend itself\\" and told the international community \\"not to criticize Israel if it continues its fight against Persian terror committed by the terrorist Hamas (...) and not to criticize Israel for using force to defend its citizens and its territory\\".Abdullah Saad Al-Hadlaq, \\"The Right of Self-defense,\\" Al-Watan, 6 March 2008, as cited in \\"Behind the Headlines: Pragmatic Arab views of Hamas\\" 10 April 2008 In 2011, Hadlaq warned against a unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state, which he says will shatter the idea of real peace in the region. According to Al-Hadlaq, Israel has in the past made strategic concessions for peace, in Sinai, the Gaza Strip and South Lebanon, proving her desire for peaceful negotiations, but the response she earned was a hail of rockets from the \\"terrorists of Hizballah and Hamas\\".Abdallah al-Hadlaq, \\"ÿÆÿ∑ÿ± ÿßŸÑÿßÿπÿ™ÿ±ÿßŸÅ ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ®ŸÉÿ± ÿ®ÿØŸàŸÑÿ© ¬´ŸÅŸÑÿ≥ÿ∑ŸäŸÜŸäÿ©!\\": International agreements dealing with peace in the Middle East must be respected.

He said that Israel is vital for the stability of the region. Sayyed praised the treatment of Arabs in Israel, and applauded the \\"strength of the Jewish spirit that refuses to give in to evil forces despite thousand of years of anti-Semitism\\". He concluded by saying \\"I am convinced that it is true that God created this earth but it is also a fact that only an Israel can keep this earth from dying\\". Tashbih condemned the press that portrays the Israelis as villains, and \\"chooses to ignore all rules of ethical journalism when it comes to Israel.\\" =Saudi Arabia= Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman said in an interview with The Atlantic that \\"I believe that each people, anywhere, has a right to live in their peaceful nation.

The group spokesperson, Hasan Afzal, a political economics student at the University of Birmingham, explained in an interview with Israeli Channel 10 that Muslims in Israel are freer than they are under oppressive regimes in Arab countries.

The Muslim Zionist states his case Mohammed Mostafa Kamal is a freelance journalist from Bangladesh based in the United Kingdom. He has said, \\"No Muslim country boycotted East Timor or banned its citizens from traveling there after it became independent from mainly Muslim Indonesia. Christian-majority South Sudan became independent from mainly Muslim United Sudan in 2011. As with East Timor, we did not see any Muslim boycotts. However, when Israel became independent in 1948, Muslim countries acted with unrelenting hostility. Why?\\" Kamal has said that when comparing Israel's actions since 1948 with those of East Timor or South Sudan, \\"the only conclusion to be drawn is that the Muslim world's attitude toward Israel is totally illogical, unfair and unjust. Israel was established in the exact same manner as were Australia and America. History will not rewind.\\" Kamal further added that \\"anti-Israel activities have not brought the Muslim world anything but tension, conflict and economic ruin, keeping them relegated to third-world status.\\" Kamal also said that it was a lie to call Israel colonialist or expanionist, using proof that Israel has ceded territory since its formation for peace agreements with Egypt and Jordan and had not committed aggression against these countries since those treaties. Kamal believes that Muslim countries must recognize the state of Israel, and the Muslim world must boycott Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran if they rejected peace. Muhammad Zahran, whose family was born in East Jerusalem, moved to Jordan, and finally to the United Kingdom, is a Palestinian blogger, lecturer, publicist, and religious Muslim who supports Israel.

Ethnicity less important than ideology in debate over new Muslim leader at J Street U. Jerusalem Post. Aug 2015 In the Qur'an Surat Bani Isra'il (The Children of Israel), also known as Surat al-Isra'. According to Khaleel Mohammed, an Islamic Law scholar, medieval exegetes of the Qur'an, such as Ibn Kathir, interpreted this Sura as saying that the land of Israel is promised to the JewsThe Legal Foundation and Borders of Israel Under International Law. p. 542 Imam Abdul Hadi Palazzi, leader of Italian Muslim Assembly and a co-founder and a co-chairman of the Islam-Israel Fellowship, quotes the Qur'an to support Judaism's special connection to the Temple Mount. According to Palazzi, \\"The most authoritative Islamic sources affirm the Temples.\\" He adds that Jerusalem is sacred to Muslims because of its prior holiness to Jews and its standing as home to the biblical prophets and kings David and Solomon, all of whom he says are sacred figures also in Islam. He claims that the Qur'an \\"expressly recognizes that Jerusalem plays the same role for Jews that Mecca has for Muslims\\". When asked what the Qur'an says about the State of Israel, Palazzi replied: > The Qur'an cannot deal with the State of Israel as we know it today, since > that State only came into existence in 1948, i.e. many centuries after the > Qur'an itself was revealed. However, the Qur'an specifies that the Land of > Israel is the homeland of the Jewish people, that God Himself gave that Land > to them as heritage and ordered them to live therein. It also announces that > ‚Äì before the end of time ‚Äì the Jewish people will come from many different > countries to retake possession of that heritage of theirs. Whoever denies > this actually denies the Qur'an itself. If he is not a scholar, and in good > faith believes what other people say about this issue, he is an ignorant > Muslim. If, on the contrary, he is informed about what the Qur'an and openly > opposes it, he ceases to be a Muslim. Prof. Khaleel Mohammed, Islamic Law scholar of the San Diego State University, noted that Sura 5 verse 21 of the Qur'an, and the medieval exegetes of the Qur'an, say that Israel belongs to the Jews. He translates it thus: Reactions towards Muslim supporters of Israel In the Muslim world, support of Israel is mostly met with opposition. In 2004, Sarah Nasser, a Muslim college student in Canada known for her pro-Israel views, received death threats after expressing support for the Jewish state's right to exist. \\"Being a supporter of the existence of Israel does not conflict with Islam, it complements Islam,\\" she said. \\"The Quran does not have any verses that do not allow for the Jews to return to the Land of Israel (...) \\"I love Jews as I love true Muslims,\\" she said. \\"Therefore, I believe Jews should have a right to live legitimately in their homeland.\\" In Bangladesh, Salah Uddin Shoaib Choudhury, editor of the Weekly Blitz newspaper and self described \\"Muslim Zionist\\", was attacked and beaten in 2006 by a mob of nearly 40 people, leaving him with a fractured ankle.

The most prominent roles amongst these belong to NK Olimpija and KK Cedevita Olimpija. They are also one of two major football ultras groups in Slovenia, the other being their traditional rivals, the Viole Maribor. They mostly wear green and white symbols and clothing, which are the club's colors. They are divided into three main sub-groups: Youth Crew, made up of the younger members, CRC, containing the veterans, and other semi-active members.  The name  The name Green Dragons is connected to the symbol of the Slovenian capital, Ljubljana, which is a green dragon on top of a white castle on a red shield. The image of the dragon is therefore familiar to all the residents of the city and it even appears in bronze form on one of the more famous bridges across the Ljubljanica river, the Dragon Bridge from 1901. However, the name Green Dragons was first used during a football game against FC Prishtina in the autumn of 1988, when a fan unfurled a banner with the words: \\"Green Dragons\\". The identity of the fan is unknown and he probably had no idea of the impact he would have on Slovenian football history.  History  Active public supporting of the club NK Olimpija began in 1986 and after the Pristina game in 1988 the supporters took on the name Green Dragons. When the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was falling apart the future of the club and its fans was unsure. Later a Slovenian league was formed. When the club finally joined this league it was left with no real rival. The first important game was played against Medvode. The Green Dragons came there by means of the players' bus which was lent to them, while the players themselves drove in their own cars. The peak of the season was marked by the \\"legendary\\" game against Maribor on the sixth of may in 1992. Nine hundred Green Dragons were present, considered a lot in those days. The opposing team of football enthusiasts had all of the banners they had brought to Ljubljana confiscated by members of the Green Dragons. The Green Dragons followed their favourite football club wherever it went. They also stated publicly that they are not going to physically attack anybody, but would still defend themselves if they were attacked and that they are going to respect others as much as others respect them. This golden season was followed by stagnation caused by the club management. This was followed by a year and a half strike by the Green Dragons until the director was changed. The next season was the leaping point of the Slovenian football star Sebastjan Cimirotiƒç. The same autumn one of the largest incidents in Slovenian supporter's history took place on the way to Maribor, at the train station in ≈†tore, near Celje, considered mostly the fault of the Slovenian Police and weird coincidence. 74 Dragons were arrested. The last game of the season is remembered as the most crowded, featuring 1500 Green Dragons, resulting in lack of space for the viewers. Olimpija however lost the title to its rival, Maribor, by one point. The rise-up of the football club followed in the next two seasons. In the game against Liverpool a large number of fans was gathered again, a bit over one thousand, and completely overtook the eight hundred English ones. As interest in sports declined in Ljubljana, so did the football club that eventually fell apart. A minor football club named NK Be≈æigrad took the stick and was joined by the Green Dragons, trying to bring high-quality back into Slovenian sport.

Hover (November 16, 1900 ‚Äì June 1, 1990)U.S., Social Security Death Index, 1935-2014 was an American executioner who was the last person to serve as a New York State Electrician, the state's executioner and operator of the electric chair. He was the last person to serve as an executioner in the now no-death penalty state and was the last surviving executioner from New York. On August 15, 1963 at Sing Sing prison, Hover executed Eddie Lee Mays, the last person to be executed by the State of New York Hover, a native and lifelong resident of Germantown, worked as a deputy sheriff for Columbia County. When on August 5, 1953, longtime state electrician Joseph Francel left his post after 14 years on service, Hover was hired to replace him, securing the job through his contacts at the Columbia County sheriff's office. He was 52 years old at that time and, like five of his predecessors, was a trained electrician. In addition to his work as a deputy sheriff, Hover earned $150 every time he put on a suit, made the 160-mile round-trip to Sing Sing, and pulled the switch for the electric chair. (Adjusted for inflation, this $150 payment is equivalent to about $1,000 today.) Hover also received gas money, usually eight cents per mile. Unlike his predecessor, whose name regularly appeared in the media, Hover kept his second job a secret. On the nights he drove to Sing Sing to carry out an execution, he changed the license plates on his car before he even left his garage. Hover was a well-known citizen of Germantown, because of his primary position. In addition to many state executions during the administrations of Governors Thomas E. Dewey, W. Averell Harriman and Nelson Rockefeller, he executed gangster Gerhard Puff, a federal inmate. He also performed fourteen executions in New Jersey and was the executioner for six executions in Connecticut during the mid-1950s to early 1960s. Hover was married since he was 20 and had two children. He was the founder of a laboratory animal supply company, Taconic Farms, that he later sold. Hover held a General Class amateur radio license, since some time before 1969. His call sign was WA2QQY. His later life was characterized by intense grief; he suffered frequent migraines, possibly as a result of job-related stress. Hover died of an apparent suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning on June 1, 1990. Execution Nights, a song about the life of Dow B. Hover was written and recorded by Canadian singer-songwriter, Lorne Clarke. The song was included on Clarke's 2007 CD release, Moonlight & Cider.

The lake is created by the Oliver Dam and Generating Plant, which was completed in 1959 by Georgia Power. The lake was named for James McCoy Oliver, an executive of Georgia Power at the time. Oliver Dam has four turbine units, and the dam itself is 70 feet tall and long. At the southern end of the reservoir, Lake Oliver is relatively wide but quickly narrows and becomes almost riverine at the northern end of the lake, at the foot of the Goat Rock Dam upstream. Public access to the lake is limited to one marina owned by the City of Columbus. Since Lake Oliver is entirely within the city limits of Columbus, Georgia, the shore is densely settled on both the Georgia and Alabama sides. Green Island Hills, an upscale development, is located on the lake at the mouth of Standing Boy Creek. Given the amount of settlement, there are many private access points to the lake. In the summer, the lake is very crowded with recreational activity. The other three seasons usually see anglers fishing for sunfish. Lake Oliver also serves as the municipal water supply for Columbus. The location of Oliver Dam is approximately at the Fall Line of the Chattahoochee River.

The CPU unit is to the right with the monitor sitting on a VCR. Desktop video refers to a phenomenon lasting from the mid-1980s to the early 1990s when the graphics capabilities of personal computers such as Commodore's Amiga, the Apple Macintosh II and specially- upgraded IBM PC compatibles had advanced to the point where individuals and local broadcasters could use them for analog non-linear editing (NLE) and vision mixing in video production. Despite the use of computers, desktop video should not be confused with digital video since the video data remained analog. Full-screen, full-motion video's vast storage requirements meant that the promise of digital encoding would not be realized on desktop computers for at least another decade. Description There were multiple models of genlock cards available to synchronise the content; the Newtek Video Toaster was commonly used in Amiga and PC systems, while Mac systems had the SuperMac Video Spigot and Radius VideoVision cards. Apple later introduced the Macintosh Quadra 840AV and Centris 660AV systems to specifically address this market. Desktop video was a parallel development to desktop publishing and enabled many small production houses and local TV stations to produce their own original content for the first time. Along with the advent of public access cable channels, desktop video meant that television advertising became affordable for local businesses such as real estate agents, contractors and auto dealers for the first time. As with the phrase desktop publishing, use of the term died out as the technologies to which it referred become the norm for any kind of video production.

The trail traverses the crest of Roundtop, a mountain that straddles the park's northern boundary. This trail, which passes through a thick forest of pine and oak and provides vistas of the valleys to the north and the mountains to the south, is one of the least-used trails in the park.The Great Smoky Mountains Institute at Tremont, \\"Hiking Routes with Tremont Hike Programs.\\" Retrieved: 29 February 2008. Geographic and natural information Roundtop is situated in the southwest corner of Sevier County and the southeast corner of Blount County, Tennessee. Along with Cove Mountain to the east and Rich Mountain to the west, Roundtop is one of a series of high ridges that form a \\"wall\\" that spans the park's northernwestern boundary. The mountain overlooks Wears Valley to the northeast, Tuckaleechee Cove (Townsend) to the northwest, and the Little River Gorge to the south. Wear Cove Gap, which is traversed by Lyon Springs Road, divides Roundtop from Cove Mountain. The Townsend Y, formed by the confluence of Little River and the Middle Prong of Little River, is situated at the mountain's southwestern corner. Little Greenbrier is located near the Roundtop Trailhead. Like most of the Great Smokies range, Roundtop is made up of Precambrian rocks of the Ocoee Supergroup.Harry Moore, A Roadside Guide to the Geology of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1988), 32. Large outcroppings of this rock form rock overhangs along the trail as it descends to the Townsend Y. Roundtop's forest consists largely of Table Mountain Pine and Pitch Pine trees, which gives way to a mixed mesophytic forest in the coves and hollows at the base of the mountain. Mountain laurel dominates the forest's understory.The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, \\"Roundtop Mountain.\\" Retrieved: 29 February 2008. While large parts of the mountain's northern slopes are private property, the entire summit of Roundtop is protected. The south side of the summit is within the national park's boundaries. The north side is part of a tract purchased by the state of Tennessee in 1974 and managed by the National Park Service. Vital information View of the mountains to the south *The Roundtop Trail mostly follows the national park boundary. While the south side of the trail and the trail itself are federal property, parts of the northern side of the trail are private property. *There is no parking at the Roundtop Trailhead, and very limited parking at the Little Greenbrier Trailhead, which is a block away on the other side of Lyon Springs Road. The nearest substantial parking lot is at Metcalf Bottoms, to the south. There is substantial parking at the Townsend Y, although the Y is a popular swimming area, and this parking lot fills up quickly in summer months. *There is no bridge at the trail terminus along Little River, so the river will have to be forded to complete a one-way hike. The river typically ranges from ankle-high to hip-high, although it can be altogether impassable after heavy rains. *There is a relatively steep switchback near the middle of the trail, although most of the trail involves gradual inclines and declines. Landmarks/overlooks *The Townsend Y *Sandstone outcroppings *Blanket Mountain and the mountains immediately south of Little River Gorge *Wears Valley Trail synopsis The Roundtop Trail near Little Roundtop The Roundtop Trail begins just inside the Great Smoky Mountains National Park's Wears Cove entrance, on the right (west) side of Lyon Springs Road (Lyon Springs Road is accessible via U.S. Route 321 in Wears Valley and via Little River Road at Metcalf Bottoms). The trail immediately rises out of Wear Cove Gap and gradually ascends to the crest of Roundtop. The northern side of the first leg of the trail is private property, although most of it is still heavily forested. A house is visible atop a knob near the trailhead, and a rental lodge sits right on the trail approximately beyond the trailhead. The aesthetic disturbance from the privately owned side of the trail is minimal, however, and consists mainly of surveyor ribbons and the occasional sign. The Townsend Y, viewed from the Roundtop Trail Just past the rental lodge, the trail begins to wind around the summit of Roundtop. The trail doesn't traverse the summit, however, and never eclipses . Beyond the main summit, the trail passes along the south slope of the mountain's sub-peak, known as Little Roundtop. The Blount County, Sevier County, and National Park boundaries all join atop Little Roundtop. Just beyond the Big Creek headwaters, the trail declines sharply at a steep switchback as it descends to the lower, western half of the mountain. Beyond Little Roundtop, the trail follows the crest of the ridge as it drops below . This leg of the trail overlooks the southeastern extremes of Tuckaleechee Cove, and the sound of church bells from nearby Townsend are not uncommon on weekends. As the trail swings around the headwaters of Meadow Branch, it parallels the upper ridgeline of the Little River Gorge. Little River's rushing waters and winds sweeping up the narrow hollows typically create an unbroken roar emanating from the valley below. The trail follows the gorge's ridgeline for nearly a mile before being forced inward by a high knob on the mountain's western flank. The trail briefly crosses to the northern slope of the mountain, above a quiet hollow, before rounding the knob and beginning its descent to the Little River Valley. The Roundtop Trail's descent is relatively sharp, but short. This leg of the trail is characterized by sandstone outcroppings, some of which form natural dry rock shelters. The Townsend Y and Little River Road can be discerned from the trail less than one-half mile from its terminus. The trail's terminus isn't marked, and splinters into several short paths, all leading the river's edge. The river is most easily forded immediately downstream or immediately upstream from the Y.

","title":"1990 in Norway"},{"id":"16025827","text":"Jim is one of two major fictional characters in the classic 1884 novel Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain. The book chronicles his and Huckleberry's raft journey down the Mississippi River in the antebellum Southern United States. Jim is an adult black slave who has fled; \\"Huck,\\" a 13-year-old white boy, joins him in spite of his own conventional understanding and the law.  Character inspiration The character may have been a composite portrait of black men Twain knew, or based on the \\"shrewd, wise, polite, always good-natured ...\\" formerly enslaved\\"After Long Absence, Twain's Butler Is to Return\\", The New York Times, dated, retrieved 18 JAN 2013 African-American George Griffin, whom Twain employed as a butler, starting around 1879, and treated as a confidant.\\"After Long Absence, Twain's Butler Is, to Return\\", New York Times (6/18/1994): 27.American Topics : Mark Twain Butler To Be Memorialized, International Herald Tribune, Monday, June 20, 1994 Twain grew up in the presence of his parents' and other Hannibal, Missourians' slaves, and listened to their stories; an uncle, too, was a slave owner. Fictional biography Jim's is one of the several spoken dialects called deliberate in a prefatory note. Academic studies include Lisa Cohen Minnick's 2004 Dialect and Dichotomy: Literary Representations of African American Speech Lisa Cohen Minnick, Dialect and Dichotomy: Literary Representations of African American Speech. Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 2004. and Raphaell Berthele's 2000 \\"Translating African-American Vernacular English into German: The problem of 'Jim' in Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn.\\".Raphaell Berthele, \\"Translating African-American Vernacular English into German: The problem of 'Jim' in Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn,\\" Journal of Sociolinguistics 4.4 (Nov2000): 588-613. The character is introduced at the beginning of Chapter Two, seen at midnight by the two boys, Huck and Tom, standing silhouetted in the doorway of the outdoor detached kitchen. He hears them approach and inquires into the darkness; he states that he will wait to hear the sound repeated, and he sits at the doorway until he dozes, relieving the hidden narrator's tension indicated by an entire paragraph on an itch unscratched because of fear, of which Jim is unaware. He awakens from dreams of witches (see Richard Dorson's 1956 Negro Folktales in Michigan), and from a nickel left by the boys becomes a storyteller of regional fame, able to command pay for his tales, and in the concluding phrase, all but unfit to be a servant. His character and perceptions dominate the novel and include spirituality, parental tenderness, and nonviolence: he leaves unmolested two rogues - Jim's term is \\"rascals\\" - who have taken over the raft despite their vulnerability as they sleep drunk. When the rogues sell Jim as an escaped slave, the character Tom Sawyer arrives. The older boy knows that Jim is a free man by this point, but uses the opportunity of Jim being imprisoned to act out prison escape fantasies from books he has read, refusing Huck's simpler plans that would free Jim easily, but without the drama, Tom sought. When the plans do not work, Tom admits that he knew Jim was free the whole time, and the trio departs from the plantation. Academic reception As a study of two slaves escaping, Huckleberry Finn is largely sympathetic to the plight of escaped slaves and critical of the institution of slavery,Matthew Guinn, \\"Review of The Jim Dilemma: Reading Race in Huckleberry Finn,\\" Southern Quarterly 37.2 (Winter1999): 175-6. According to Cliff Notes: \\"Jim‚Äôs logic, compassion, intelligence, and above all, his loyalty toward Huck, Tom, and his own family, establish him as a heroic figure.\\" However, beginning in the 20th century the novel was frequently criticized for depicting Jim as a stereotype, and Tom as an aggressor. According to Professor Stephen Railton of the University of Virginia, Twain was unable to fully rise above the stereotypes of black people that white readers of his era expected and enjoyed. Twain therefore resorted to minstrel show-style comedy to provide humor at Jim's expense and ended up conforming to rather than challenging late-19th century racist stereotypes.Stephen Railton, \\"Jim and Mark Twain: What Do Dey Stan' For?\\" Virginia Quarterly Review 63 (1987).

History During the Hundred Years War, was the scene of the Battle of Brignais in April 1362 between the royal army of John II and an amalgamation of mercenary companies Tard-Venus (the late comers). These mercenaries had been made unemployed after the Treaty of Br√©tigny in 1360 and subsequent period of peace between England and France spanning 1360-1369. They had formed a Free company, one of many that plundered much of central and southern France. The battle lasting two days, led to a devastating defeat of the royal army with the death and capture of many of the senior commanders. The site of the battle is still called the Chemin des Tard-Venus.

Previously the industry used the ISCI system until 2003. Ad-ID is used to assure that the correct assets are delivered to the media by providing a central source for identification. It is mostly used for television and radio advertisements but has been gaining traction online and in print. There is an equivalent code in France called ARPP.TV which also is the French industry standard unique identifier for all ads (and is based on ISCI). Critical information about each ad and campaign is managed with Ad-ID. Details of the ad, what media the ad will be used in, clearance status, usage restrictions, related executions, and other vital information can be accessed by authorized users.  Origin  Ad-ID was developed by the American Association of Advertising Agencies and the Association of National Advertisers, Inc., (ANA), Ad-ID uses the TV standard, ISCI commercial coding system in its monetization model. The ISCI code is an 8 character alphanumeric code (four alpha prefix followed by four numbers) in use since 1970. The prefixes were licensed and centrally managed and the complete ISCI codes were manually created and not stored in a central repository. Ad-ID uses ISCI codes that are a basic 11 digits in length, (a set of four and set of eight alphanumeric characters) plus an optional 12th (to indicate HD or 3D). The first four alphanumeric characters are an identification prefix licensed to a particular company. Ad-ID generates ISCI codes through a secure, Web- accessible database, located at www.ad-id.org.  Technology  The Ad-ID system uses a web interface and a set of custom APIs to manage the system and integrate with customers' systems. The system uses a unique algorithm to maximize the use of the 12-character codes. The Ad-ID system required the last 4 characters of a code to increment from the left to right, and to cycle through numbers and letters.

History After the defeat at the Battle of Tucapel, the Spanish had hurriedly reorganized their forces, reinforcing fort La Imperial for its defense and abandoning Confines and Arauco in order to strengthen Concepci√≥n. Araucanian tradition had dictated a lengthy celebration after their victory, which kept Lautaro from exploiting the weakness of the Spanish position as he desired. It was only in February 1554 that he succeeded in putting together an army of 8,000 men, just in time to confront a punitive expedition under the command of Francisco de Villagra at the Battle of Marihue√±u. Lautaro chose the hill of Marihue√±u to fight the Spanish, and subsequently organized his forces in four divisions: two had the mission of containing and wearing down the enemy, another would be held in reserve to launch a fresh attack as the Spanish were about to crumble, and the last would work to cut off their retreat. Additionally, a small group was sent to destroy the reed bridge the Spanish had erected across the B√≠o-B√≠o River, which would further disrupt the anticipated retreat of Villagra. The Spanish attack broke the first Mapuche lines, but the quick action of the third group maintained the Mapuche position. Later, the wings of this division began to attack the Spanish flanks, and the fourth division attacked from behind. After hours of battle and the loss of their artillery, only a small group of Spanish were able to retreat after a desperate fight to break through the Mapuche that blocked their escape in their rear.

Shortly thereafter, he began writing and producing documentary-style videos about the same controversial topics covered in his books, such as cancer, the historical authenticity of Noah's Ark, the Federal Reserve System, the Supreme Court of the United States, terrorism, subversion, and foreign policy. Political advocacy In 1964, Griffin wrote his first book, The Fearful Master, on the United Nations, a topic that recurs throughout his writings. While he describes his work as the output of \\"a plain vanilla researcher,\\" Griffin also agrees with the Los Angeles Daily Newss characterization of him as \\"Crusader Rabbit\\". Griffin has been a member and officer of the John Birch Society (JBS) for much of his life and a contributing editor to its magazine, The New American. Since the 1960s, Griffin has spoken and written about the Society's theory of history involving \\"communist and capitalist conspiracies\\" over banking systems (including the Federal Reserve System), International banking, United States foreign policy, the U.S. military‚Äìindustrial complex, the American news and entertainment media as propaganda, the Supreme Court of the United States, and the United Nations. From 1962 to 1975, he completed nine books and seven film productions; Griffin's 1969 video lecture, More Deadly Than War: The Communist Revolution in America, was printed in English and Dutch. In 1974, he published World Without Cancer, and in 1975, he wrote a sympathetic biography of JBS founder Robert W. Welch. In May 2009, Griffin helped Robert L. Schulz and Edwin Vieira organize a meeting at Jekyll Island of thirty people which, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, included \\"radical tax protesters, militiamen, nativist extremists, anti-Obama 'birthers,' hard-line libertarians, conspiracy-minded individuals with theories about secret government concentration camps, even a raging anti-Semite named Edgar Steele.\\" Speakers at the meeting \\"warned of 'increasing national instability,' worried about a coming 'New World Order', denounced secret schemes to merge Canada, Mexico and the United States, and furiously attacked the new president's 'socialized' policies and failure to end illegal immigration\\", and attendees made plans for a \\"continental congress\\" that occurred in November 2009 that was hosted by the We the People Foundation. Griffin was the first to speak at the Jekyll Island meeting and he \\"told conferees that merely putting 'large numbers of people in the street' was not enough. 'We must,' he said, 'achieve power.'\\" He founded an organization called \\"Freedom Force International\\" that put on conventions, like a \\"Red Pill Expo\\" in Bozeman, Montana, in 2017 which, according to the local newspaper, \\"its organizers say, promotes freedom of choice, (but) has been criticized by human rights proponents as an ‚Äúalt-right‚Äù recruiting attempt.\\" Conspiracy theories and fringe science =The Creature from Jekyll Island= Griffin's 1994 book, The Creature from Jekyll Island, draws parallels between the Federal Reserve and a bird of prey. Griffin has opposed the Federal Reserve since the 1960s, saying it constitutes a banking cartel and an instrument of war and totalitarianism. He presented his views on the U.S. money system in his 1993 movie and 1994 book on the Federal Reserve System, The Creature from Jekyll Island. The book was a business-topic bestseller. The book also influenced Ron Paul when he wrote a chapter on money and the Federal Reserve in his New York Times bestseller, The Revolution: A Manifesto.Paul listed Griffin's book on his \\"Reading List for a Free and Prosperous America\\". See: Edward Flaherty, an academic economist writing for Political Research Associates, characterized Griffin's description of the secret meeting on Jekyll Island as \\"amateurish\\" and \\"highly suspect\\". Jesse Walker, the books editor for Reason magazine, says the book has grains of truth but \\"reduce[s] things too much to a certain narrative, where the mustache-twirlers are behind everything.\\" Peter Conti-Brown of The Wharton School and The Brookings Institution identifies the book as \\"the leading popular account of the conspiracists\\", noting that \\"while [they] hit their target in noting the existence and significance of the Jekyll Island meeting, [...] the 'creature' established [...] bore little relationship, from a governance standpoint, to the Federal Reserve System.\\" In his words, the book should be referenced \\"for entertainment but not information\\". In a movie review for The New York Times, Jeannette Catsoulis wrote that the book \\"has been debunked\\". =Cancer, chemtrails, and AIDS denial= In 1973, Griffin wrote and self-published the book World Without Cancer and released it as a video; its second edition appeared in 1997. In the book and the video, Griffin asserts that cancer is a metabolic disease like a vitamin deficiency facilitated by the insufficient dietary consumption of amygdalin. He contends that \\"eliminating cancer through a nondrug therapy has not been accepted because of the hidden economic and power agendas of those who dominate the medical establishment\\" and he wrote, \\"at the very top of the world's economic and political pyramid of power there is a grouping of financial, political, and industrial interests that, by the very nature of their goals, are the natural enemies of the nutritional approaches to health.\\" Since the 1970s, the use of laetrile (a semi-synthetic version of amygdalin) to treat cancer has been identified in the scientific literature as a canonical example of quackery and has never been shown to be effective in the treatment or prevention of cancer. Emanuel Landau, then a Project Director for the APHA, wrote a book review for the American Journal of Public Health, which noted that Griffin \\"accepts the 'conspiracy' theory ... that policy-makers in the medical, pharmaceutical, research and fund-raising organizations deliberately or unconsciously strive not to prevent or cure cancer in order to perpetuate their functions\\". Landau concludes that although World Without Cancer \\"is an emotional plea for the unrestricted use of the Laetrile as an anti-tumor agent, the scientific evidence to justify such a policy does not appear within it.\\" In 2010, Griffin engaged in HIV/AIDS denialism, claiming that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) \\"doesn't exist\\" and that antiretroviral medications (rather than HIV) cause acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). In a 2012 video titled \\"What in the World Are They Spraying?\\", Griffin asserts that airplanes leave a permanent grid of chemtrails hanging over cities like Los Angeles. =Noah's Ark search= In 1992, Griffin wrote and narrated The Discovery of Noah's Ark, based on David Fasold's 1988 book, The Ark of Noah. Griffin's film said that the original Noah's Ark continued to exist in fossil form at the Durupƒ±nar site, about from Mount Ararat in Turkey, based on photographic, radar, and metal detector evidence. Griffin also said that towns in the area had names that resembled terms from the Biblical story of the Great Flood. He endorsed the historicity of the Biblical account of the flood, and speculated that the flood was the byproduct of massive tides caused by a gravitational interaction between Earth and a large celestial body coming close to it.

In literature and popular culture Hermann Hesse's short story \\"Chagrin d'Amour\\" (1908) narrates a fictional origin for this song at a medieval tournament. Hesse has it composed by an obscure troubadour named Marcel, who sings this song to a queen named Herzeloyde to express his hopeless and unrequited love for her. Hesse took the names of the characters from Wolfram von Eschenbach's Parzival. At the start of Robert Anderson's play Tea and Sympathy, the main character, Tom Lee, is singing this \\"plaintive\\" song referred to as \\"The Joys of Love\\". In the 1939 film Love Affair, the song is sung by Irene Dunne. In the 1949 film The Heiress, the song is played and sung by Montgomery Clift's character, Morris. The song is woven throughout the score, foreshadowing his betrayal and the title character's lifelong heartbreak. The melodies for Elvis Presley's \\"Can't Help Falling in Love\\" (1961) and the 20th century Christian hymn \\"My God Loves Me\\" are based on \\"Plaisir d'amour\\". \\"My God Loves Me\\", godsongs.net In the 1966 film Batman, this song is performed by Julie Gregg in an uncredited role. The song is heard twice in the film, during Bruce Wayne's date with Miss Kitka/Catwoman and the later scene where Kitka is revealed to be Catwoman. Mado Robin's version of the song plays in Djibril Diop Mamb√©ty's 1973 film Touki Bouki when Nori and Anta go to visit a rich patron's estate in order to convince him to fund their trip to Paris. It is repeated a few times more throughout the remainder of the film.\\"Touki Bouki (Djibril Diop Mamb√©ty, 1973)\\" by Charles Matthews, 21 September 2016, charlesmatthews.blogspot.com In the 2001 miniseries Band of Brothers, this song is played by a convent choir at the end of the seventh episode The Breaking Point.

Because of her emotional singing style and voice, she is considered to be the number one female singer and entertainer in Mexico; thus, earning her the name of \\"La Numero Uno\\" (the number one). History Early life and career Born in Mexico City, she was raised with her two sisters, Gilda and Guadalupe (Lupita). Her singing career began in 1966 as part of the group called \\"Los Peg\\", whose other members included Jos√© Jos√© (bass player) and her sister Gilda Deneken (vocalist).

Upon her return to Mexico, in 1972 she joined the musical group \\"Tabasco\\" with her other sister Lupita Deneken and for the first time the three sisters sang together. \\"Tabasco\\" was discovered by Tony De Marco who became the group's manager. Tabasco's first tour was across the United States of America. Due to the group's success, the U.S. tour was extended for several years. It was during this time that Lila decided to separate from the group to become a solo artist. Career as a solo artist In 1978 she competed in the OTI Festival winning 2nd place with the song \\"Cuando Pienso en Ti\\" (When I Think about You) written by Nacho Mendez and 1st place for the best interpreter of the OTI festival.

Lila is well known for her fashion sense, this time she wore a spectacular gown designed by Bob Mackie. Her performance, her presentation, her personality, and her voice garnered her once more \\"The Revelation of the OTI.\\" She won second place for interpreting \\"Se solicita una aventura\\" (Looking for Romance) written by Roberto Cantoral. Later, Lila gained fame for a song written by Bebu Silvetti and Lolita de la Colina, entitled \\"Por Cobardia\\" (Because I'm a Coward); \\"Por Cobardia\\" put her on the top of every playlist. In 1981 she embarked on a second International tour as a solo artist. She became the first and only female Latin artist to perform in the world recognized \\"Sporting Club\\" of Monaco in Monte-Carlo. Upon her return to Mexico she continued to perform in sold-out concerts with her Las Vegas style shows. Lila has appeared with many Mexican entertainers such as Gualberto Castro. Personal life Married to the Televisa producer Humberto Navarro La Carabina de Ambrosio (later divorced), she had two children with Navarro, Lila decided to focus on her family. She left entertaining and began painting and writing musicals, plays and short stories. Return to show business In 2001, she returned to performing with 4 concerts in the \\"Foro Cultural Coyoacanense Hugo Arguelles\\", where she debuted a newer style as music along with her standards. In October 2001 she successfully four-walled the \\"Ramiro Jimenez\\" theater in Mexico City. In 2002 she was named \\"Madrina de Honor\\" in the \\"Festival del Dia Mundial del Mariachi\\".

Common references place the falls at around tall, but taking into account the second tier, it is closer to 75‚Äì80 meters tall.Waterfalls of the Pacific Northwest: Spahats Creek FallsWaterfalls of the Northeastern United States: Spahats Creek Falls It is a popular stop for tourists and especially motorcoach tours since it is only off the busy Yellowhead Highway. Spahats Creek rises from snowmelt and springs at a pass between Raft Mountain and Trophy Mountain. It flows 15 km west before tumbling over Spahats Falls and entering the Clearwater River. Spahats is the First Nations term for bear and the stream was long known as Bear Creek. When the first accurate topographical map of the Clearwater Valley was published in 1953, it labelled the stream as ‚ÄúBear Creek‚Äù and the falls as ‚ÄúSpahats (Bear) Creek Falls‚Äù. By the late 1960s, ‚ÄúSpahats‚Äù had become an accepted alternative due to the large number of Bear creeks in British Columbia and was officially adopted.Neave, Roland (2015). Exploring Wells Gray Park, 6th edition. Wells Gray Tours, Kamloops, BC. . These impressive natural features used to be protected as tiny Spahats Creek Provincial Park, but in 1997 the boundaries of Wells Gray Provincial Park were expanded south along the Clearwater River and included Spahats. Tourists today see the anomaly of a \\"Wells Gray Park\\" entrance sign beside the road just south of Spahats Creek and another, more elaborate, sign further north. Spahats Creek Park used to have its own 20-unit campground with an attractive location deep in an old- growth forest, but in 2006 it was closed and converted into a gigantic parking lot. Formation Like the larger Helmcken Falls, Spahats Falls owes its formation to deposits of volcanic rock in the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field. Starting about 300,000 years ago, numerous eruptions from Trophy Mountain poured into the Clearwater River Valley and filled it layer upon layer to a depth of over . Eruptions in various parts of this valley continued sporadically for 200,000 years, producing some of lava and creating Wells Gray Park features such as Murtle Plateau. After the eruptions, the Clearwater River re-established its course and began cutting into the lava. During the Pleistocene, gigantic icefields scraped away at the lava. When all this ice melted, the floods completed the carving of Granite Canyon on the Clearwater River and the side canyon where Spahats Falls occurs.The Atlas of Canada - Volcanoes Hickson, Cathie with Hollinger, Jason (2014). Wells Gray Rocks. Thompson Rivers University, Kamloops, BC. Trails The observation platform * The main trail from the parking lot to the falls viewing platform takes about 5 mins to walk. * An alternate and slightly longer trail goes from the parking lot along the edge of Spahats Creek Canyon and joins the main trail. * A scenic trail starts at the viewing platform and goes north along the rim of Granite Canyon. It is a 20-minute walk to the Clearwater Valley Overlook. Return the same way or follow the access road back to the parking lot. * A short trail from the south-east corner of the parking lot follows Spahats creek upstream to a small loop trail originally built as a nature trail for the former campground. A 5 minute walk leads to a stand of impressive old growth red cedar trees. * The bottom of Spahats Falls is a strenuous scramble that starts at the viewing platform and quickly descends 300 m. Don't go during May and June when the canyon is very wet and the creek may be in flood. * The Clearwater River Trail is 17 km one-way and can be accessed at several points for a shorter hike. * A trail to the Spahats Natural Bridge starts 1.5 km south of the viewpoint turnoff and takes less than 30 minutes each way. The trailhead is not signed and the trail is rough and steep. * For detailed descriptions of these trails, refer to the guidebook Exploring Wells Gray Park.
