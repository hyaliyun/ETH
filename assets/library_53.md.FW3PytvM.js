It ran over fifty bus services, mainly operating in Sussex and Kent with some operations into Hampshire. On 8 October 2012, it was placed in administration. It continued other services under a different licence trading as SwiftBus, this ceased trading on 18 January 2013. History Plaxton Pointer 2 bodied Dennis Dart in Guildford in January 2009 The history of Countryliner can be traced back to 1911, with the formation of the East Surrey Traction Company, which was based in Reigate, Surrey. This later became part of the London General Omnibus Company, which was later absorbed into London Transport.History Countryliner In 1933, Green Line operated coaches across the home counties and London. The success of a Guildford to Charing Cross route led to the opening of the bus depot in Guildford. Buses were suspended from normal operation during World War II, but afterwards, Green Line carried on operating from Reigate. The company was involved in the Festival of Britain in 1951. In 1970, Green Line lost its link to London Transport, to become part of London Country Bus Services, which was a subsidiary of the National Bus Company. On 7 September 1986, the south west region of London Country Bus Services was transferred to London Country South WestOut on its own Commercial Motor 6 December 1986 page 54 and on 19 February 1988 was sold to the Drawlane Group, which was restructured as British Bus in November 1992.London Country Bus (South West) Commercial Motor 25 February 1988 page 7¬£6m payment renews fat-cat row The Independent 27 November 1995 On 1 August 1996, British Bus was sold to the Cowie Group,Cowie buys British Bus for ¬£282m Herald Scotland 1 August 1996Cowie Group plc and British Bus Group Limited: A report on the merger situation Competition Commission 31 October 1996 which in November 1997 was rebranded as Arriva.Bamber Forsyth unites Cowie Design Week 23 October 1997 Green Line's private hire department was renamed Countryliner in 1992, and in 1996 London & Country South West, bought Blue Saloon Coaches of Guildford, a large bus and coach operator in the area. In August 1998, Arriva sold Countryliner in a management buyout. In 2001, the company diversified into bus operations. A new livery was adopted with a cream or white body, with a lime green skirt. Originally, buses were cream and coaches white, but most became white. The fleet was renewed between 2001 and 2006, with low-floor Dennis Darts making up the bus fleet and a mixture of Mercedes-Benz and Volvos making up the coach fleet. Countryliner SussexCompanies House extract company no 5515688 Countryliner Sussex Limited was formed in 2006 to take over the bus operation of RDH Services of Ditchling Common, in East Sussex. It operated in Lewes, Burgess Hill, Kent and Haywards Heath. Countryliner Sussex was placed into administration in October 2012. Countryliner BusesCompanies House extract company no 5781412 Countryliner Buses Limited was also formed in April 2006, which took over the Hickstead operation of Compass Travel, also operating in the Burgess Hill and Haywards Heath area, and through to Brighton. At this time, the Countryliner group of companies operated around 80 vehicles through Surrey, Hampshire and Sussex. In 2008, Countryliner commenced operating the Petersfield Town Services on behalf of Hampshire County Council, thus extending the operating area into Hampshire. In addition to this, more contracts were awarded to operate between Petersfield and Chichester and Midhurst on behalf of West Sussex County Council. Northern Counties Palatine bodied Volvo Olympian on the Isle of Wight in June 2011 In June 2009, Countryliner Group LimitedCompanies House extract company no 6946470 Countryliner Group Limited was formed, to take over full ownership of all Countryliner subsidiaries. Incorporated were Bob Hodgetts, Roger Belcher, James Holmes and Craig White, the former two of which are company directors. However, the latter two represent Merchant Corporate Recovery plc, who paid ¬£200,000 for a 51% stake in Countryliner Group, and who also provided a working capital facility of ¬£300,000, showing extra cash had to be put into the business. Holmes said \\"the issues in the business can be clearly defined and the management has the ability to tackle them with our support\\". Merchant Corporate Recovery valued Countryliner's assets at the time as ¬£1million and said it had made pre-tax profits of ¬£250,000 for the first half of 2009. In 2009, Countryliner's financial standing was further brought into question. In November, a High Court hearing to wind up three of the Countryliner Group's companies, under the Insolvency Act 1986, was adjourned until January. The affected companies were Countryliner Buses Limited, Countryliner Coach Hire Limited and Countryliner Sussex Limited. With Countryliner operating around 150 vehicles with around 200 staff at the time from five depots in Hampshire, Surrey, West and East Sussex and into Kent, it caused worry among passengers and local authorities. Countryliner ran 23 routes in Surrey and Hampshire at the time, and during the proceedings Surrey County Council - who Countryliner ran a number of services under contract to - said they were \\"monitoring developments\\". Countryliner made no comment but to confirm services were operating normally and that a restructuring was underway. The adjourned hearing took place on 20 January 2010. It emerged that the winding up order had been started by HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) over an unpaid debt. At the hearing, the applications were dismissed and Countryliner were awarded costs against HMRC. Director Roger Belcher said \\"There was an outstanding debt to HMRC and they issued winding-up orders even though our negotiators were speaking to them at the time.\\" The Countryliner Buses company had paid off all its debts and been liquidated, and Countyliner Coach Hire entered into a company voluntary arrangement. Plaxton Premiere bodied Volvo B10M in May 2008 Roger Belcher was confident about the business, saying at the time that \\"it's trading healthily\\" and that there was never a risk that they would have been wound up: \\"All of our suppliers have been paid on time and all of our staff have been, there's one creditor and one creditor only.\\" The third winding up order against Countryliner Sussex Limited was heard on 17 February. As per what Roger Belcher expected in January, all debts were paid off in time for the hearing and that case too was thrown out. A number of changes to the company's Surrey network occurred from August 2010, as part of phase 1 of the Surrey County Council \\"Bus Review\\", a review of all of Surrey County Council's tendered services, with the aim of reducing the amount of subsidy paid by the council. Routes 73, 81, 462 and 463 were taken on commercially. All of Countryliner services in Surrey had previously received some form of support from the County Council. As part of the changes, routes 71, 72 and 97 were withdrawn, and Countryliner lost the tender for route 437 to Arriva Guildford & West Surrey. With this loss of work, Countryliner decided to start half- hourly commercial service 464 between Guildford and Cranleigh from the day of the bus review changes, in competition with Arriva Guildford & West Surrey routes 53 and 63. Arriva also increased their services from the same weekend to every 15 minutes, however Countryliner's Neil Hatcher denied reports of a bus war (where Arriva would react to Countryliner's new service by purposely increasing theirs). Arriva's changes were not from the same day, and neither company would have been aware of the other's intentions at the time the changes were registered with the traffic commissioner. Countryliner offered a more regular service to the Summerlands Estate in Cranleigh, and some buses ran via Guildford station towards Guildford unlike any other buses. Lower fares were charged, although Arriva did reduce their fares for their service changes. The service interworked with routes 462/3 to Woking (and from there the 73 to Chobham), with through fares available, although the workings did cause large problems with punctuality until February 2011 revisions. Neil Hatcher said that if the 464 was successful it would consider further expanding its services into Cranleigh's housing areas. Plaxton Pointer 1 bodied Dennis Dart SLF in Old Steine in December 2010 Further financial problems surfaced on 1 March 2011 when Fisher Partners, a business recovery specialist, informed creditors that Countryliner Coach Hire Limited had failed to keep up its payments to HMRC, against the terms of the creditors voluntary agreement, and said that they were to petition a winding up order against Countryliner. Countryliner faced further problems in 2011, this time regarding maintenance. At a three-day public inquiry finishing on 16 March 2011, just two out of five of the company's operator licences being investigated survived being cut by Traffic Commissioner Philip Brown. The Countryliner Coach Hire Limited licence, with authorisation for 35 vehicles, was revoked from the end of that week, from 23:59 on 18 March, after being found to have poor financial standing and having had several vehicle problems. This licence carried around half of the Surrey services and some Sussex ones. The C&S; Coach Travel Limited licence, with authorisation for 33 vehicles, was found to have lost its repute, in particular following the numerous tachograph infringements, and was revoked from 31 July 2011 to allow school contracts to finish at the end of the school year. A condition was attached that no new EU work could be taken on, and director Geoffrey Shaw was banned with immediate effect from holding or obtaining an O-licence for two years. The other director voluntarily resigned. The business was wound down gradually. The Countryliner Limited licence, with authorisation for 15 vehicles, and with the other half of the Surrey routes on it, received a formal maintenance warning after a high MOT failure rate and was allowed to continue, again with the condition it must not take on any new EU work. The Countryliner Sussex Limited licence, with authorisation for 17 vehicles, carrying most of the Sussex and Kent routes, was allowed to continue. Again, no new EU work could be taken on, a new transport manager must be submitted by 25 March and finances must be shown. Finally, an application for a new licence, Countryside & Suburban Limited for 104 vehicles, was withdrawn at the inquiry. This was to have been a \\"catch-all licence\\" covering all of the Countryliner Group subsidiaries. Together, the O-licence authorisation fell from 140 vehicles to 72. Metrobus liveried Countryliner Plaxton Pointer 1 bodied Dennis Dart SLF in Tunbridge Wells in April 2009 The final licence held by Countryliner Group, RJB (UK) Limited, with five O-licences for buses based at Borden, Hampshire, was not part of the inquiry, being in the Western Traffic Area as opposed to the South Eastern and Metropolitan area. To overcome the cut to the licences, Countryliner stopped operating several routes, and numerous routes changed to different licences. To overcome the immediate cut to the Countryliner Coach Hire Limited licence, Surrey routes 10/11, 98, 478, 678, 823, and E303 were abandoned, the 10/11, 478 and 678 Surrey County Council tenders all being taken on at short notice by Arriva from the next day of operation, similarly the 823 by Safeguard Coaches and the E303 by Reptons Coaches. Route 98 was withdrawn with no replacement, being a limited commercial service with alternatives routes available. The remaining routes on the licence were spread to others, Surrey routes 11, 87, 89 and 479 to Countryliner Limited and Sussex routes 54, 56, 69, 79, 91, 92, X92 and 93 to Countryliner Sussex Limited. A planned service increase to route 464, including introduction of variation 474, was cancelled following the decision, as was planned route 78 to run every week from Cranleigh to Chichester Market. Countryliner are to focus on a reduced amount of local bus work, it is intended that by October 2011 all routes will have moved on to the Countryliner Sussex Limited licence, and by then most of the coach fleet will have been disposed of after the revocation of the C&S; Coach Travel Limited licence. The company will have to re-affirm its financial standing every six months from 30 September 2011. Soon after the decision, Countryliner cancelled the registrations for Surrey routes 81, 462, 463 and 464 which they had taken on commercially following the Surrey County Council Bus Review Phase 1, effective from 16 May 2011. Routes 81, 462 and 463 are being tendered by Surrey County Council from 16 May to 3 September 2011, however route 464 will not be replaced as it is a commercial venture in competition with Arriva. Should Countryliner not bid for or not win the tenders for the 81, 462 or 463, their presence in Surrey will have been almost halved since August 2010. Also due to Hampshire county council cuts Countryliner now operate the previously stagecoach run route 41 . Hampshire county council have also taken the Saturday service off this route. Warwickshire County Links liveried Countryliner Mercedes-Benz Citaro in Woking April 2010 As a result of phase 3 of the Surrey Bus Review, from September 2012 a number of changes were made to Countryliner services in Surrey. Route 516 (Epsom-Chart Downs) transferred to Coaches Excetera (formerly Croydon Coaches). Routes 24/25 were taken over from Arriva, whilst the 46 (Aldershot- Guildford) and 10 (Guildford town service) were taken over by Countryliner from Stagecoach Hants & Surrey and Abellio Surrey respectively. On the evening of 8 October 2012, Countryliner Sussex was placed in administration.Countryliner goes into administration The Argus 8 October 2012Buses disrupted as company 'goes into administration' BBC News 9 October 2012RH Transport closes...as does Countryliner Sussex Bus & Coach Professional 9 October 2012 East Sussex County Council worked to provide alternative services from the next day, with Stagecoach Kent and Compass Travel taking on a number of services. The rest of the company continued operations largely as normal on 9 October, but in Surrey the company was unable to operate routes 10 and 11, with Abellio Surrey and Stagecoach stepping in on each route respectively on an emergency basis. Following this, Surrey County Council terminated all of their contracts with Countryliner's Surrey operations, stating that they felt Countryliner was \\"no longer in a position to run these services to the required standards\\". Routes were assigned to new operators from 10 October: Abellio Surrey 10, 73, & 81, Stagecoach Hants & Surrey 11, 43, 45, 46 & 87, Coaches Excetera 24, 25.Emerging Countryliner situation Surrey County Council 16 October 2012 The Fleet Buzz division of Stagecoach took over operation of route 11 on 11 October. On 12 October 2012, Quality Line started operation of the 479 route, offering free travel on Friday 12 and Saturday 13 October, later extending to Monday 15th and Tuesday 16th. They planned for a new and simpler flat fare structure which would have applied from Monday 15 October. However, Sunray Travel also registered the route, and remained operating it with ex-Countryliner buses throughout, also offering free travel while Quality Line were running. On Tuesday 16th, the Traffic Commissioner accepted Sunray's registration and rejected Quality Line's,Notices and Proceedings The Traffic Commissioner for the South Eastern and Metropolitan Area 26 October 2012 meaning that Sunray could start charging fares and leading to Quality Line withdrawing its service.

It was formerly operated by the Western Maryland Health System. The building is currently owned by the City of Cumberland, Maryland. Established as the Western Maryland Hospital in 1888, Memorial Hospital moved to its location on Memorial Avenue in Cumberland in 1929 and was renamed in honor of those who gave their life in World War I. Memorial Hospital was once operated by the City of Cumberland and became a private non-profit organization in the early 1980s. It was then operated by the Cumberland Memorial Hospital Corporation. In an effort to effectively manage local healthcare resources, Memorial and Sacred Heart Hospital joined together in April 1996 to form the Western Maryland Health System (WMHS). Working together, the two hospitals were able to expand the range of healthcare services available to local residents and successfully meet the challenges associated with an ever-changing healthcare industry. One way this was accomplished was by assigning specialty centers to each hospital. The Memorial Campus had specialty centers for Children's and Adolescents' Health, Orthopedic and Joint Reconstruction, Trauma Services, and Women's Health, while the Sacred Heart Campus specialized in Behavioral Health, Cardiac Services, Oncology Services, and Outpatient Services. In 2006 work began on a new facility on Willowbrook Road in Cumberland to consolidate the Western Maryland Health System within the city into one centralized facility. On November 21, 2009, the Western Maryland Regional Medical Center opened. As of 3:30 PM that same day, all patients from both Memorial Hospital and Sacred Heart Hospital (WMHS Braddock Campus) had been moved to the new hospital and the two facilities were closed. The campus, which is still owned by the City of Cumberland, was under lease to development company Ridgecrest Investments Inc, who in turn leased out space to a number of private tenants for the three years following the hospitals closing. The agreement between the city and Ridgecrest Investments was terminated in early 2012 due to the low percentage of the site being leased to tenants. A few months after, all tenants were told to vacate the site by the end of the year as the city works to divest itself of the property. The agreement between the city and WMHS upon the closure of the hospital does not allow the site to be use as a hospital, or any other type of facility that would compete with the services of Western Maryland Regional Medical Center.

Emmanuel (known as Manuel or Manwel) Magri, S.J. (27 February 1851, in Valletta - 29 March 1907, in Sfax) was a Maltese ethnographer, archaeologist and writer. Magri gave a significant contribution as a scholar through his collection of Maltese folk tales and lore. Working at the end of the 19th and the turn of the 20th centuries, Magri's important work saved for posterity ethnographic material which would have otherwise been lost through modernisation and more widespread education. Fr Magri was also one of Malta's pioneers in archaeology. He was a member of the first Committee of Management of the Museum of Malta alongside Antonio Annetto Caruana, N. Tagliaferro and Temi Zammit. Fr Magri was entrusted with the excavation of the Hypogeum of ƒ¶al-Saflieni, a Megalithic Temple in Xewkija (Gozo), and a number of other sites in Malta and Gozo. Born on 27 February 1851 in Valletta, Magri joined the Society of Jesus, in 1871. He was ordained priest in 1881 in Tortosa (Spain), and made the solemn profession of the last vows on 15 August 1890, in Istanbul. As a Jesuit, Magri taught in a number of Jesuit colleges in Malta and Turkey. He also served as Assistant of the Provincial of Sicily (1898‚Äì1902) and as Rector of the Seminary in Gozo (1902-1906). Magri died unexpectedly on 29 March 1907 in Sfax, Tunisia, where he had gone to preach Lenten exercises and celebrate Easter with the Maltese community.

He was known for a more \\"cool\\" style on the instrument than his peer Buddy DeFranco who often played a more aggressive bebop style. Despite this he remained relatively little-known as the clarinet had been in eclipse in jazz since the emergence of bebop. In 1959 he left New York City, where he had been based, and abandoned the United States for a time. In the 1960s he toured South, East, and Southeast Asia. This led to his playing in a Hindu temple, spending time in Japan, and releasing Music for Zen Meditation in 1964 for Verve Records.

Gwenogvryn Evans in 1923 by George Phoenix Reverend John Gwenogvryn Evans (20 March 1852 ‚Äì 25 March 1930) was a Welsh palaeographic expert and literary translator. Early life Evans was born at Llanybydder in Carmarthenshire. He was apprenticed to a grocer, but returned to school, one of his teachers being William Thomas (Gwilym Marles). He studied theology and became a Unitarian minister, but gave up his pastorate because of ill- health. Scholarly career Evans subsequently began to take an interest in ancient Welsh manuscripts, and set up his own printing press in Pwllheli to create facsimiles of major Welsh medieval manuscripts, such as the books of Aneirin and Taliesin. In 1880 he moved to Oxford, where he spent most of the rest of his life. He had been a speaker of Welsh in Carmarthenshire until the age of 19, and only now did he learn English.John Gwenogvryn Evans, \\"Taliesin: or The Critic Cricitised\\", Y Cymmrodor, vol. 34 (1924). After the publication of the first volume in the Series of Old Welsh Texts in 1887, Evans was awarded the degree of MA honoris causa by the University of Oxford. In May 1901 he received the degree D.Litt honoris causa from the same university. From 1894 to 1920, Evans was employed by the Historical Manuscripts Commission, producing a major Report on Manuscripts in the Welsh Language. In 1905 he facilitated the purchase of the Peniarth manuscript collection from Sir John Williams. Since 1909, this has been lodged in the National Library of Wales at Aberystwyth. He campaigned for a secure library for Wales. Valuable books were then in danger of destruction by fire, damp and vermin. His connection with Sir John Williams was important in the history of the establishment of the National Library. In 1915 he completed the publication of a two volume set of the works of the 6th-century Welsh poet Taliesin. The first volume, the Facsimile & text of the Book of Taliesin, is a complete photographic facsimile of the original manuscript (c.1275‚Äì1325) with a scholarly introduction and notes. This was accompanied by Poems from the book of Taliesin, being his own seven-year scholarly translation with notes. The latter book included and translated the mystical poems, as well as the historical/legendary poems. The initial reception of his Taliesin work suffered on several counts: the books were issued during the First World War; and in 1918 the Taliesin work was badly criticised in the Welsh journal Y Cymmrodor, which thereafter damaged his standing in Wales. Evans replied to his critic at length, taking up the complete 1924 issue of Y Cymmrodor with his \\"Taliesin: or The Critic Cricitised\\".Y Cymmrodor, vol. 34 (1924). Later life and death Evans retired to Llanbedrog in Caernarfonshire, where he ran his own printing press as a hobby. He and his wife Edith are both buried there.

His main event was the javelin throw, in which he won the silver medal at both the 1932 Summer Olympics and the 1934 European Championships, but he was also a good pentathlete, breaking the unofficial world record in 1931. Career Sippala defeated javelin world record holder Matti J√§rvinen at the Finnish Olympic tryouts in 1932, throwing 70.02. At the Olympics in Los Angeles, however, J√§rvinen dominated, throwing beyond 70 m five times with a best throw of 72.71. Sippala, who had strained his back in training, threw 68.14 m on his first attempt, 4 cm less than Germany's Gottfried Weimann; he failed to improve over the next four rounds, staying in third place until the third Finn, Eino Penttil√§, reached 68.70 in round five. In the sixth and final round Sippala threw 69.80 m, moving from fourth to second place as Finland swept the medals. Sippala threw his personal best, 70.54 m, in Riga in 1934. At that year's European Championships in Turin he won another silver medal with 69.97 m, again behind J√§rvinen who broke his own world record. In addition to the javelin, Sippala competed in combined events. He won silver in the decathlon at the 1930 Finnish championships, but never reached the international elite in that event.

In 1534, King Henry parted with the Pope and the Catholic religion and by the Act of Supremacy made himself the supreme head of the church in his lands. One of his first actions in his new role was to impose taxes on the clergy. Taxes traditionally paid by clerics to the Pope were now to be given to him, and Henry also decided in late 1534 to create a new annual income tax of 10% on the income from all church lands and offices. To properly assess the new tax a survey of all church property and revenues had to be made. In January 1535, the government appointed commissions throughout the country to conduct the survey. All clergymen, parish priests, heads of monasteries, colleges, hospitals and other institutions under church auspices were commanded to give sworn testimony before their local commissioners as to their income, the lands their establishments owned and the revenues they received from all other sources. The commissioners were to examine documents and account books and from these and the testimony provide a full financial statement for every religious institution. The work of collecting the information was ordered to be completed by 30 May 1535 and the results sent in to the Exchequer in London. The commissioners were unpaid and untrained, mostly local gentry, mayors, magistrates, bishops and sheriffs, but they approached the vast task with speed and, by the summer of 1535, the government had in its hands a detailed accounting of the property and wealth of the church. Most of their work survives, preserved in 22 Latin volumes and three folders at The National Archives in Kew. Two of the volumes are illuminated manuscripts and seem to be a summary made for King Henry's personal use. Accuracy The commissioners had no particular reason to be partial to the clergy and they applied themselves to the task with much diligence. Where the figures can be checked, for example against the financial records of the king's officials in charge of dissolving monasteries in the later 1530s, they are shown to be broadly accurate though on the low side, in some cases by as much as 15%. There is, particularly in the north, a tendency to underestimate the value of some important classes of asset, especially agricultural land held in desmesne and woodland with standing timber. One theory to account for this is the natural tendency of taxpayers to make conservative estimates combined with the rushed nature of the work, which encouraged the commissioners to give the benefit of the doubt. Standing timber moreover, by its nature, provides a resource of occasional exceptional income, rather than a steady annual income stream, and hence was commonly ignored in income assessments for 16th century inventories of landed assets. In a few instances the discrepancy is of so large a scale as to suggest deliberate fraud in the returns in the Valor Ecclesiasticus; as was the case for example of Norton Priory in Cheshire, where the submitted figure was so low as to render the abbey liable for suppression under the first (1536) statute for the dissolution of lesser religious houses. Significance The Valor gave the government for the first time a solid understanding of the scale of the wealth of the church as a whole and particularly of the monasteries. It was not long before King Henry began planning ways of seizing much of these riches for himself, starting with the smaller religious houses. Figures from the Valor were a vital part of the process of the Suppression of Religious Houses Act 1535, Henry's first move in the dissolution of the monasteries, which dissolved all monasteries with a declared income of less than ¬£200 per year. The Valor is a document of the first importance for historians of the later medi√¶val and Tudor church, the English Reformation, and the Dissolution. It is also valuable to economic historians of the period.

Over three decades, the annual indoor event became a major attraction in the San Francisco Bay and was attended by nearly half a million people since its inception with steadily increasing growth in attendance each year until 2010, when the event was cancelled due to poor ticket sales and cost overruns. The 2011 ball was never planned. Due to the worldwide popularity of the event the City of San Francisco issued three proclamations for ‚ÄúExotic Erotic Ball Day,‚ÄùMayor Willie announced October 23rd 'Exotic Erotic Ball Day' in San Francisco (Press release), Highbeam Research twice by Mayor Willie Brown in 1999 and again in 2001, and once by Mayor Gavin Newsom in 2004. In 2011 and 2012, similar but unrelated events, Masquerotica and the XO Ball & Expo, respectively, filled the void left by the demise of the original Exotic Erotic. Description Many attendees of the Exotic Erotic Ball came to the event in elaborate and creative Halloween costumesAcres of fishnet and flesh at Exotic Erotic Ball, SFGate to compete in the annual ‚ÄúBest Costume‚Äù contestThe Ball's World Famous Costume Contests, Urban Network which in later years typically awarded the winner prize money and merchandise in the US$10,000 range. While the Exotic Erotic Ball by definition would be considered a ‚ÄúFestival‚Äù the event is rarely categorized into conventional terms by attendees, the media, or event organizers. Because of the broad spectrum of conventional and unconventional entertainment offered on multiple stages at the Exotic Erotic Ball, it may be described as a combination of Adult-themed; Halloween festival, Music Festival, Burlesque show, Lingerie party, Masquerade ball, Fetish club, Swingers party and Adult Industry Trade Show. From 2004 through 2009, organizers expanded the Exotic Erotic Ball to include the Exotic Erotic Expo. The expo was a two-day Adult-Expo typically held the day before and the day of the Exotic Erotic Ball. Activities included panel discussions on First Amendment rights with adult actress, actors, and media, wine tastings with porn stars, and various oddities such as the \\"spiritual oasis\\" with psychic readings and massage, body painting, a classic adult cinema, and a human petting zoo. It also features a commercial area with vendors and exhibitors who showcase the latest in exotic fashion, erotic art, adult products, games, websites, and adult novelties. In 2008, 26,341 people participated in the combined Exotic Erotic Ball and Exotic Erotic Expo.  History  Perry Mann organized the first Exotic Erotic Ball in 1979 to raise campaign funds for his business partner and best friend, the late Louis Abolafia, who ran for President of the United States under the Nudist Party with the slogan: ‚ÄúI have nothing to hide.‚ÄùHistory of the Exotic Erotic Ball, Exoterica Ball Louis also coined the phrase, ‚ÄúMake love, not war!‚Äù and his legendary Greenwich Village love-ins inspired the New York press to crown him ‚ÄúThe Love King.‚Äù Abolafia had previously run in 1968 under the Cosmic Love Party, even then with the slogan \\"What have I got to hide?\\" Abolafia died in 1995, reportedly of a drug overdose. The Nudist Ball, a precursor to the Exotic Erotic Ball, took place in Mann's Tenderloin, San Francisco, California apartment in 1978 and attracted a few hundred people. In 1979, it moved to California Hall on Turk Street and officially became the Exotic Erotic Ball, with 800 to 900 people paying $10 apiece. The location changed over the years ending up at its last home at the Cow Palace in Daly City. In May 2004, Republican legislators in California‚Äîcountering a move to outlaw gun shows at the Cow Palace‚Äîunsuccessfully sought to ban the ball as well.http://www.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2004/5/20/150948.shtml , retrieved September 30, 2006 In 2010, the expo and ball relocated from the Cow Palace to the new Craneway Pavilion in Richmond, California. The move meant that instead of having 20,000 people, organizers would be limited to 14,000 attendees into the Craneway Pavilion on the Richmond waterfront over two days. Organizers expected 7,500 attendees, but canceled the 2010 event the day before it was scheduled to occur, citing poor ticket sales and cost overruns. Many longtime Exotic Erotic Ball attendees were apparently unwilling to travel to Richmond, an industrial city located 25 miles northeast of San Francisco, citing its longtime reputation for being crime-plagued (the city's own police department described Richmond as having a chronic violent crime problem for \\"decades\\" and in 2010 was ranked as the 6th most dangerous city in the United States).East Bay cities ranked among most dangerous in U.S., Bay City News Services. Contra Costa Times. November 23, 2010. Retrieved November 24, 2010.RPD main page The Exotic Erotic Ball fostered strong ties to the San Francisco community. Over the years, the Ball distributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to charitiesExotic Erotic Ball and Snoop Dogg Combine to Raise Funds for The Healing Circle, The Urban Network supporting causes such as helping the victims of natural disasters,Earthquake-rattled San Francisco returning to abnormal, Google News AIDS, homelessness, domestic violence, child abuse, and has always supported freedom of expression and First Amendment Rights. The Exotic Erotic Ball hosted an annual blood drive with Blood Centers of the Pacific whereby free tickets were offered to those who donated blood. For several years, Mann also held an Exotic Erotic New Year's Eve Ball, but discontinued it in 1995. In 2001, Mann released the book The Exotic Erotic Ball: Twenty Years of the World's Sexiest Party (). Perry Mann: \\"My late partner's Louis' expression 'Make Love, Not War' was once the rallying cry of a generation. I don't think that message has ever been more timely or important than it is today, and I don't think our show has ever been a more needed diversion.\\" In September 2011, Mann announced that they were \\"pursuing an international opportunity\\" and \\"editing our 30-year documentary\\" but not producing an event. They did recommend a new event called: Masquerotica, to be held on October 22, 2011 at The Concourse in San Francisco‚Äîone of the old Ball's longtime venues. In an announcement posted on the Exotic Erotic Ball's Website,http://www.exoticeroticball.com/index.php Mann promised, \\"You'll see a lot of familiar faces ... and other body parts.\\" Masquerotica is produced by different local event producers and other than being recommended by Mann has no affiliation to the Exotic Erotic Ball. Another similar but unrelated event, held in September 2012 at Cow Palace, is the XO Ball and Expo.

It covers the traditional and historical regions of Slovenian Istria and most of the Karst Plateau, which traditionally belonged to the County of Gorizia and Gradisca. The region has a sub-Mediterranean climate and is Slovenia's only statistical region bordering the sea. Its natural features enable the development of tourism, transport, and special agricultural crops. More than two-thirds of gross value added are generated by services (trade, accommodation, and transport); most was generated by activities at the Port of Koper and through seaside and spa tourism. The region recorded almost a quarter of all tourist nights in the country in 2013; slightly less than half by domestic tourists. Among foreign tourists, Italians, Austrians, and Germans predominated. In 2012 the region was one of four regions with a positive annual population growth rate (8.1‚Ä∞). However, the age structure of the population was less favourable: in mid-2013 the ageing index was 133.3, which means that for every 100 inhabitants under 15 there were 133 inhabitants 65 or older. The farms in this region are among the smallest in Slovenia in terms of average utilised agricultural area per farm and in terms of the number of livestock on farms. Municipalities The Coastal‚ÄìKarst Statistical Region comprises the following eight municipalities: * Ankaran * Divaƒça * Hrpelje-Kozina * Izola * Komen * Koper * Piran * Se≈æana  Demographics  It has an area of 1,044 km¬≤ and an estimated 112,942 inhabitants (at 1 July 2015)‚Äîof whom almost half live in the coastal city of Koper‚Äîand the second-highest GDP per capita of the Slovenian regions. It has high percentage of foreigners, at 10% (after the Central Slovenia Statistical Region with 33%, the Drava Statistical Region with 12.6%, and the Savinja Statistical Region with 12%).

As an example, Mary Shelley gave her most famous novel the title Frankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus; by using the subtitle \\"the Modern Prometheus\\", she references the Greek Titan as a hint of the novel's themes. In English, subtitles were traditionally denoted and separated from the title proper by the conjunction \\"or\\", perhaps hinting at their function as an alternate title. A more modern usage is to simply separate the subtitle by punctuation, making the subtitle more of a continuation or sub-element of the title proper. Literature Subtitles for plays were fashionable in the Elizabethan era; William Shakespeare parodied this vogue by giving Twelfth Night his only subtitle, the deliberately uninformative What You Will, implying that the subtitle can be whatever the audience wants it to be. In printing, subtitles often appear below the title in a less prominent typeface or following the title after a colon. Some modern publishers choose to forget subtitles when republishing historical works, such as Shelley's famous story, which is often now sold simply as Frankenstein. In library cataloging, the subtitle does not include an alternate title which is defined as part of the title proper; e.g. One Good Turn: A Natural History of the Screwdriver and the Screw would be filed as \\"One Good Turn\\" (title proper) \\"A Natural History of the Screwdriver and the Screw\\" (subtitle), while Twelfth Night, or What You Will would be filed as \\"Twelfth Night, or What You Will\\" (title proper). Non-Fiction In political philosophy, for example, the 16th-century theorist Thomas Hobbes named his magnum opus Leviathan or The Matter, Forme and Power of a Common- Wealth Ecclesiasticall and Civil, using the subtitle to explain the subject matter of the book. Film and other media In film, examples of subtitles include Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb and Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance). Subtitles are also used to distinguish different installments in a series, instead of or in addition to a number, such as: Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, the second in the Pirates of the Caribbean series; Mario Kart: Super Circuit, the third in the Mario Kart series; and Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, the second in the Star Trek series.

Intended for general patrolling in low-threat areas, the vehicle was developed in 1992 for use in Northern Ireland. It provides a limited degree of small arms protection for occupants and a limited level of protection from Improvised Explosive Devices and off-route mines. The vehicle has been criticized as occupant deaths have resulted from kinetic attacks which exceeded the level of protection available. Overview The Snatch is based on the Land Rover Heavy Duty Chassis, a militarised version of the Defender 110 (also used for the Land Rover Wolf). It was originally procured for use in Northern Ireland by the British Army and was first introduced in 1992. Officially designated, Truck Utility Medium (TUM) with Vehicle Protection Kit (VPK), the vehicle is more widely known by its informal title, the \\"Snatch\\", even in official documentation. It is believed to have acquired the name from its use in the Troubles, when it was the preferred vehicle for snatch squads: soldiers trained to deal with demonstrations by picking out and arresting suspected ringleaders. The \\"Snatch\\" was the first factory modified Land Rover to be used in Northern Ireland, replacing a series of ad hoc conversions including protected Airportable Land Rover (Land Rover 1/2 ton Lightweight) and 109\\" (known as the \\"piglet\\", being a smaller version of the Humber Pig armoured personnel carrier) then widely used by British Forces in Northern Ireland. Manufactured as the CAMAC CAV 100 by NP Aerospace, the \\"Snatch\\" conversion was developed with the aid of Ricardo, and is fitted with CAMAC composite armour to offer the crew protection against kinetic energy projectiles and, to a very limited degree, against explosive devices. Its rated \\"combat weight\\" (without crew and weapons) is 3,050 kg. Six versions have been produced, the first being the original Snatch-1, equipped with a V8 petrol engine. Nearly 1,000 were produced, with 278 being \\"desertised\\" and reclassified as the Snatch-1.5. Most were upgraded to a second variant standard, either * the Snatch-2 12v, LHD, the basic training variant; * the Snatch-2A 24v, RHD, \\"Rest of World variant\\"; or * the Snatch-2B 24v, RHD - the N. Ireland variant. These later versions were retro-fitted with \\"300 Tdi\\" diesel engines and the 2A is also fitted with air conditioning. Some Snatch 2 are being further upgraded to the Snatch Vixen standard with chassis and drivetrain enhancements for a higher gross vehicle weight. When deployed, the vehicles are often fitted with electronic countermeasure suites, which are designed to prevent certain types of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) being triggered, and Bowman radios. Criticism of vehicle use Use of the vehicle has been the subject of criticism by the media, politicians and the families of some casualties in both the Afghan and Iraqi areas of British operations. This criticism became public knowledge in 2005 when the media published claims from civil servants in the Foreign & Commonwealth Office and Department for International Development advising against the use of the vehicles. Later concerns were raised in Parliament, presenting comparison with the U.S. Marine Corps deployment of the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) Cougar, which appeared to have provided more protection. The conservative peer Lord Astor of Hever raising the comparison and inviting comment. In response the Minister for Defence Procurement, Lord Drayson, acknowledged that the Snatch was inappropriate but identified that trade-offs around protection and mobility were required, as well as highlighting previous maintainability issues with an earlier version of the Cougar. Similar issues were then reported in a Sunday Telegraph opinion piece and other news outlets. These also recognised the need for trade-off decisions to be made around posture and mobility. Media reporting continued to escalate the topic whilst parliamentary dialogue continued. Four families of servicemen killed in Snatch Land Rovers in Iraq and Afghanistan are to sue the Ministry of Defence, as reported by the BBC on 19 June 2009. Since 2003, some 37 UK personnel have been killed while using the vehicles. The use of the Snatch in Afghanistan and Iraq has caused troops to name it a \\"Mobile Coffin\\". Procurement of additional vehicles In 2010 the MoD was in the process of procuring a number of vehicles with increased levels of protection, although of reduced mobility, to supplement the vehicle fleets in Afghanistan and Iraq. Existing orders for the Pinzgauer Vector and the Bulldog, based on the FV432, were increased. New vehicles, the Mastiff (6√ó6) and Ridgback (4√ó4), based on the Cougar, which is produced by the US firm Force Protection Inc, are under procurement. Some of these vehicles have been delivered and deployed to theatre. The UK MoD is also procuring 420 Panther CLV 4√ó4 vehicles in the Command and Liaison role. Mine and IED protection are prime features on this vehicle. In September 2010, Force Protection Europe, developer of the Ocelot light armoured vehicle, has been selected as the preferred bidder in U.K. Ministry of Defense (MoD) Light Protected Patrol Vehicle (LPPV) program. According to FPE, the first Ocelot vehicles are expected to be available for the training of UK forces in 2011. The initial phase will require up to 400 new vehicles to be delivered by 2010-2011. FPE won this competition against the all-British Supacat group, offering the Supacat Protected Vehicle (SPV) SPV-400. The Ocelot has an approximate gross vehicle weight of only 16,500 pounds. Its cabin is made of a protective pod, made of advanced composite materials incorporating Formula One racing technology. Critical components such as the engine, fuel tank and transmission are contained in the V-shaped armoured ‚Äòspine‚Äô that deflects potential blast away from the pod, thus protecting the occupants and critical key components. Replacement Former British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, announced on 6 March 2010, during his surprise visit to troops in Afghanistan, that the Snatch Land Rover would be replaced by a new \\"light patrol vehicle\\". This new vehicle was revealed by the Ministry of Defence as the Ocelot on 22 September 2010. In 2011 it was confirmed that an unmanned variant of the vehicle is a component of the Talisman route clearing system intended to counter IED attack. The vehicle is known as the Panama remote controlled vehicle and is used to forward mount a sensor suite to avoid the need for EOD operators to dismount. Snatch Public Order Upgrade Programme Ovik 'Phoenix' In the wake of the 2011 riots in the UK and the success of the Pangolin Armoured Public Order Vehicles used in Northern Ireland, some British police forces approached the OVIK Group http://www.oviks.com to recycle former Snatch Land Rovers into cost effective Public Order Vehicles. This led to the creation of the Phoenix - B6+ Armoured Vehicle. Refit The refit takes up to 340 work hours to complete. This includes full engine and transmission refurbishment, significant upgrades to all brakes, addition of full 'public order kit' which included hardening of all doors, wings and bonnet, external fire protection system and finally protected emergency lighting, siren and radio system installed. This vehicle is currently in service with Avon and Somerset police. Some of the options available to customers included: * Impact resistant bonnet and wings. * Armoured front radiator grille. * Steel headlight and tail light protection. * Front side and rear drop-down under- skirt. * Heavy duty windscreen protection grille. * Heavy duty side screen protection. * Fire and explosive protection for fuel lines and tank. * Choice of left or right hand drive References Category:Armoured cars of the United Kingdom SNATCH Land Rover Category:History of Northern Ireland Category:Cars of England Category:Military light utility vehicles ","title":"Snatch Land Rover"},{"id":"7218732","text":"The Pacific sanddab (Citharichthys sordidus) is a species of flatfish.

This botanist is denoted by the author abbreviation Marloth when citing a botanical name. Biography Early life Marloth studied pharmacy in L√ºbben from 1873-1876. after which he worked at various pharmacies in Germany and Switzerland, then formally qualified as a pharmacist at the University of Berlin. In 1883 he was awarded a doctorate for his thesis \\"The protective mechanisms employed by seeds against harmful agents\\". He arrived in Cape Town on 30 December 1883 after being urged to do so by a schoolfriend who had already settled there. During his first year there he worked as a pharmacist for the firm of Wentzel and Schleswig. He was enthralled by Cape Town and Table Mountain and started immediately on a plant collection, soon going further afield to places like Klein Winterhoek, Du Toitskloof, Bainskloof and Sneeukop. During this time he started his own business in Cape Town. Acting as a locum in Kimberley, he made collecting trips from 1885-1886 to the surrounding areas such as Kuruman in the Northern Cape and to South West Africa where he visited Aus, L√ºderitz Bay, Walvis Bay, Usakos, Ubib, Karibib, Otjimbingwe and Okahandja. Many of his specimens were written up under \\"Plantae Marlothiana\\" by Engler and others in Berlin. In 1888 he accepted a post in the Department of Chemistry at Victoria College (which later became Stellenbosch University); shortly after this in 1889 he became Professor and held this position till 1892. Thereafter he lectured at Elsenburg Agricultural School and at the same time acted as consultant and analytical chemist in Cape Town. Later life In 1891 he married Marian van Wyk of Clanwilliam. The day after his arrival in Cape Town, he had climbed to the top of Table Mountain. Spending much time botanising in the mountains, he came into contact with the mountaineering fraternity and played a role in the founding of the Mountain Club of South Africa in 1891, acting as chairman from 1901-1906 and receiving their gold badge in 1906. He spent time on the Groot Winterhoek Peak near Tulbagh, Michells Pass and collected at Stellenbosch, Knysna, Matroosberg and Jonkershoek between 1887 and 1896. During this period he discovered many new species and a new genus in Gesneriaceae which he named Charadrophila Marl. In 1898 he met Andreas Schimper, renowned botanist and phytogeographer, who had arrived aboard the \\"Valdivia\\". Together they made collecting trips to the Montagu and Swartberg passes, and then further to Knysna. Schimper died in 1901 before his report was written, so that Marloth was asked to write an account on the phytogeography of the Cape. In those times \\"the Cape\\" was interpreted to cover a large part of southern Africa. In order to write the report, Marloth felt it necessary to make extended trips to the Cederberg, Gifberg, Koue Bokkeveld, Swartruggens and on to Rhodesia. On a visit to South Africa in 1905, Lady Phillips commissioned Rudolf Marloth to undertake his Flora of South Africa, a mammoth work published in 6 volumes between 1913 and 1932. In 1917 a Dictionary of the Common Names of Plants was published - this was a supplement to the Flora of South Africa. Other publications by Marloth were Cape Flowers at home (Darter, Cape Town, 1922), The Chemistry of South African Plants and Plant Products (Cape Chemical Society, Cape Town, 1913), Das Kapland:insonderheit das Reich der Kapflora, das Waldgebiet und die Karroo, pflanzengeographisch dargestellt (Gustav Fischer, Jena, 1908) and Stone-shaped Plants (Speciality Press, Cape Town, 1929) The species Aloe marlothii was named in Marloth's honour. An important nature reserve and holiday township in Mpumalanga, Marloth Park, is also named after this famous botanist, besides the Marloth Nature Reserve in the Western Cape.

The main building of the winery is located at Kibbutz Hulda, east of Tel Aviv. Barkan receives grapes from vineyards in the Golan Heights, Upper Galilee, Lower Galilee, Mount Tabor region, the Jerusalem Mountains and Mitzpe Ramon. Barkan Classic Red History In 1899, Shlomo Friedman established the Friedman Winery in Petah Tikva to produce sweet Kiddush wine and brandy for the Jewish community in Palestine. Shlomo's son, Bezalel, took over the business and moved to Kiryat Matalon, Petah-Tikva's industrial zone, then a desolate sand dune. In 1964, the winery was acquired by Tnuva, which supplied the grapes, mainly Alicante and Carignane. The winery's name was changed to Tnuva-Friedman. In 1971 Tnuva sold the winery to the Stock liqueur company, which produced mainly brandy, vodka, liqueurs, vermouth, and other non-wine alcoholic beverages. The winery in Petah Tikva was renamed Hamartef (The Cellar), and began producing wines from better grape varieties such as Cabernet Sauvignon, and Sauvignon Blanc. In 1988, Stock built a new winery near the Israeli settlement of Ariel, in the Barkan Industrial Park. Two years later, two of Stock's major grape growers purchased the company and renamed it Barkan Wine Cellars. After acquiring the Segal Winery in 2001, Barkan became Israel's second largest winery. In 1990, a new facility opened at Kibbutz Hulda. The Hulda vineyard, covering over 1,200 dunams, is the largest single vineyard in Israel. The location was chosen for its proximity to the Hulda vineyards and major Israeli highways. The winery at Hulda received its first shipment of grapes in 2000. Bottling facilities moved to Hulda in 2003. Since the completion of a new warehouse in 2007, the entire operation has moved there. The winery, covering an area of 50,000 square meters, has a 12-million liter tank farm, an automated crushing and fermentation plant, and a 10,000 square meter filling and case storage building. Segal wine has been produced at the Barkan winery at Kibbutz Hulda since 2001, but it continues to be marketed independently. Barkan is now developing a vineyard of 150 dunams in Mitzpe Ramon. In 2012, the winery agreed to dismantle the fences it built around new vineyards in the vicinity of Beit Nekofa at the request of the Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel and environmentalists who claimed that gazelles became entangled in them. According to Michal Neeman, head of the food and beverage division of the Israel Export and International Cooperation Institute, Barkan is one of Israel's leading wine producers. Of some 25 Israeli wineries exporting to America, Barkan heads the list, along with Binyamina, Carmel, Dalton, Domaine du Castel, Efrat, Galil Mountain, Golan Heights Winery, Recanati and Tishbi. The company wines include Village, La Tavola, Barkan Classic, Reserve, Signature, Superior and Altitude. Barkan works in partnership with wineries all over the world, including the Royal Wine Company (United States), Kedem Europe Ltd. (United Kingdom); Ron Riess Import Export (Germany) and S.A.R.L.-Zaoui (France). Controversy In June 2018, an undercover news investigation by Israel's Kan 11 television station claimed that the company had banned some of its Ethiopian Jewish employees from coming in contact with its wine due to doubt about their Jewishness.https://www.timesofisrael.com/outcry-as-barkan-winery-shuns- ethiopian-workers-over-doubts-of-their-jewishness/ While Barkan admitted that the question had been studied, it firmly denied that any action had ever been taken. No worker was ever removed from his work station. this remains true to this very day.

The film revolves around the theme of the Book of Job. The main roles are played by Ulrich Thomsen and Mads Mikkelsen.  Plot  Neo-Nazi gang leader Adam (Ulrich Thomsen) is granted parole from prison for participating in a rehabilitation program, where he joins the aggressive Saudi gas station robber Khalid (Ali Kazim) and the kleptomanic rapist Gunnar (Nicolas Bro). The community is headed by the priest Ivan (Mads Mikkelsen), who believes firmly and blindly in the goodness of man, and is seemingly oblivious to the ongoing misconduct and aggression of his charges. Ivan tells Adam to choose a goal for himself to complete his rehabilitation. Trying to mock the priest, Adam chooses the goal of baking an apple pie. Ivan accepts, but stipulates that making the pie includes grooming and harvesting the churchyard apple tree. Adam is loath to complete his task, especially because at first crows attack the apples, and later most of those that remain are eaten by worms. The misanthropic Nazi is especially irritated by Ivan's joyful manner, excessive optimism and extreme forgiveness, and he sets it as his personal goal to break the priest's spirit and crush his faith. Adam discovers that Ivan's life has been very difficult. Growing up as a victim of child abuse, he has terminal brain cancer, and is the widowed father of a severely disabled child. The cynical village doctor theorizes that Ivan discounts reality and sees all problems as tests from the devil, because his real life would be otherwise nearly impossible to bear. Adam psychologically attacks the priest by quoting the Book of Job, reasoning that it is God who hates the priest, not the devil. Ivan finally breaks down and renounces his faith. Adam is gleeful at first, but soon realizes that without Ivan's influence, Khalid and Gunnar revert quickly to their criminal habits, and starts realizing the positive impact the priest had made. When several members of Adam's neo-Nazi gang visit the church and confront Khalid for earlier having shot two of their members, Ivan comes out of the church and demands to be allowed to die in peace. A scuffle ensues and the leader of the neo-Nazis accidentally shoots the priest in the eye. At the hospital, the doctor predicts Ivan will be dead by morning. Suddenly guilt-stricken, Adam stays up all night baking a tiny, one-apple pie for Ivan, using the single apple surviving the sequential mishaps that happened to the apple-tree throughout the film. When he arrives at the hospital, he finds that Ivan's bed is empty. He goes to find Ivan's doctor, who tells him that the priest is in the garden - the bullet that hit him has neatly removed the tumour that plagued him.

Built by NORINCO, it was first displayed publicly in 1988's ASIADEX defence show. Development Type 704 radar shares the same root as its larger cousin, the SLC-2 Radar: four AN/TPQ-37 Firefinder radar have been sold to China and this had become the foundation of SLC-2 radar development. Aside from political reasons, the US$10 million plus unit price tag of TPQ-37 (including after sale logistic support) was simply too costly for Chinese. Decision was made to develop a domestic equivalent after mastering the technologies of TPQ-37. After the initial test of TPQ-37 in Tangshan (Ê±§Â±±) Range near Nanjing in 1988, and in Xuanhua District in October of the same year, several shortcomings of TPQ-37 were discovered and further intensive tests were conducted and completed in 1994. The requirement of the Chinese domestic equivalent was subsequently modified to address these issues revealed in trials. Due to the limitation of the Chinese industrial capability at the time, decision was made to develop the Chinese domestic equivalent in several steps. The first step was to develop a smaller one, which would result in the Chinese equivalent of AN/TPQ-36 Firefinder radar, Type 704 series radar, and based on the experience gained from this program, a more capable larger version in the same class of AN/TPQ-37 Firefinder radar would be developed, which eventually resulted in SLC-2 series. Type 704 radar Type 704 is the first of the Type 704 series of counter-battery radars. Developmental work of Type 704 begun in parallel with the introduction of AN/TPQ-37 radar into Chinese service, and the reported experience gained on the Chinese reverse engineering of TPQ-37 has influenced Type 704 radar. One problem revealed in the tests was that the reliability of TPQ-37 is much lower than what was claimed. The reason was that when TPQ-37 was deployed in environments with high humidity and high level of rainfall (southern China), high salinity (coastal regions), high altitude (southwestern China), and subjected to daily high temperature differences (northwestern China), malfunctions occurs more frequently. Type 704 radar was designed specifically to improve the reliability against these harsh environmental factors. Type 704A radar Type 704 is followed by its successor, Type 704A, which is fully solid state, fully digitized version, which further improved reliability and simplified logistics, and thus reduced the operational cost. One of the limitations of TPQ-37 revealed in tests was that the it was less effective against projectiles with flat trajectory, so it is much more effective against howitzer and mortar rounds than rounds from 130 mm towed field gun M1954 (M-46) and its Chinese derivative Type 59-1. Type 704A radar is designed to overcome this shortcoming by improving the capability against rounds with flat trajectory. BL904 radar A further improved variant based on Type 704A designated as BL904 has also been introduced. This latest version of Type 704 radar family reportedly utilizes the more advanced lens arrangement for its planar passive phased array antenna, instead of earlier simple horn arranged used in earlier versions. Unconfirmed Chinese claims also concludes that the BL904 radar also incorporate former-USSR counter-battery radar Zoopark-1 radar, two of which was purchased by China from Ukraine, but such claim has yet to be verified by official sources and sources outside China. Specifications * S - band * Range (against 81-mm mortar round sized target): > 15 km CS/RB1 radar At the 9th Zhuhai Airshow held in November 2012, a new, lightweight, counterbattery radar designated as CS/RB1 made its public debut.CS/RB1 Like Type 704 and BL904 radars, CS/RB1 is also designed primarily for detecting incoming projectiles down to the size of mortar round, though larger objects can be tracked as well. CS/RB1 is designed to be a lightweight version of Type 704/BL904 to be carried by individual soldiers (when systems are breaking down into portions). CS/RB1 radar operates is a passive phased radar operates in L-band, and it is fully solid state, highly digitized, conformal array in cylindrical shape.,CS/RB1 radar and it can be airdropped.

The wheel is a type of rhythm used in hymns or narrative songs sung in European churches or gatherings from the 12th to the 16th Centuries. A wheel occurs when at the end of each stanza, the song and the lyric return to some peculiar rhythm. In some instances the wheel is a return to something that resembles no definable poetic rhythm. A bob is a very short line, often two assertive syllables that announces the start of the wheel. As an interruption of the usual rhythm, the bob and wheel has been compared to a cadenza in music. It is a way of adding recurring, abrupt and forceful variety to a song or verse for a short passage.M‚ÄôNeill, George P. Huchown of the Awye Ryale The Scottish Review, Volume 11. Publisher: A. Gardner, 1888. p. 277 It is notably used by the poet known as the Pearl Poet in the ballad Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. The feature is found mainly in Middle English and Middle Scots There are at least forty known examples of the bob and wheel. The origin of the form is not known; it predates Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. The term, bob and wheel, was first used by Edwin Guest in The History of English Rhythms.E. Guest in The History of English Rhythms. Publisher: George Bell, 1882. p. 605-629. The Pearl Poet uses the bob and wheel as a transition or pivot between his alliterative verse and a summary/counterpoint rhyming verse, as in this example from the first stanza of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. The first 14 lines use a pentameter rhythm: :\\"Sithen the sege and the assut was sesed at Troye, :The borgh brittened and brent to brondes and askes, :The tulk that the trammes of tresoun ther wroght :Was tried for his tricherie, the trewest on erthe-- :Hit was Ennias the athel and highe kynde, :That sithen depreced provinces and patrounes bicome :Welneghe of al the wele in the west iles. :Fro riche Romulus to Rome ricchis hym swythe, :With gret bobbaunce that burghe he biges upon fyrst, :And nevenes hit his aune nome, as hit now hat. :Ticius to Tuskan and teldes bigynnes, :Langaberde in Lumbardie lyftes up homes, :And fer over the French flod Felix Brutus :On mony bonkkes ful brode Bretayn he settes :::with wynne, ::Where werre and wrake and wonder ::Bi sythes has wont therinne, ::And oft bothe blysse and blunder ::Ful skete has skyfted synne.\\" The \\"with wynne\\" is the \\"bob\\", and it is immediately followed by the four-line \\"wheel\\" with its own rhymes and rhythm. The content of the bob and wheel varies, but, generally, it functions as a refrain, or a summary, or an ironic counterpoint to the stanza that preceded it. Some Modern English poets and contemporary poets have revived the use of the bob and wheel. It is often considered as a regular metrical form as the Pearl Poet uses it, but in fact, in Middle English, there is great variation, and wheels are often used without the bob.Brogan, T.V.F. \\"Bob and wheel\\" in Alex Preminger and T.V.F.

He enjoys international fame and mixed in United States of America through invitations by DJ Big Dawg Pitbulls of Funkmaster Flex and Shadyville DJ's of rapper 50 Cent. For more than fifteen years, he has been one of the most emblematic DJs in French hip hop.  Biography  Anouar Hajoui as a young Parisian who loved music and a frenzied activist embraced wholeheartedly the emerging Parisian movement. He joined IZB, the first association to promote the hip-hop and organize concerts, and put down scratches on Original MC's 1991 album. He performed a memorable role as himself in a scene from the cult movie La Haine. He was a DJ for MC Solaar‚Äôs concerts, scratcher on IAM member Akhenaton‚Äôs solo album, and a radio show on Radio Nova.  Career  In the middle of the 1990s, Cut Killer had already become a well-respected and active DJ. He adapted and consolidated New York hip-hop in France through many of his mix tapes, mixing the latest releases and freestyles of French rap, they became favorites and collectors' items. His dynamic mixes, his smartness to catch the best 12 inches before anyone, and his flair to find local rappers made his mix-tapes important. The big number of top brass of the second generation of French rap went through this: Sages Po√®tes de la Rue, Lunatic, 113 and many others. The Hip Hop Soul Party series, composed of double mixed CDs, started in 1996 at MCA‚Äôs. From the second volume on, exclusive tracks began to appear from Fabe, Busta Flex, among others, with one CD dedicated to hip-hop, the other to R&B.; In volume three, a CD was dedicated to international hip-hop, the other to French hip-hop. Killer, after the death of his rapper mate East established a label called Double H (for Hip-Hop) as a merchandising company and then a production label. In a few years, HH became one of the most influential independent labels on the market. When shifting from Universal to Small (Sony), the Hip-Hop Soul Party project became the Cut Killer Show with a first double CD published in 1997 (containing an outro by Jamel Debbouze), followed in 1998 by Operation Freestyle, a record fully dedicated to French underground. In 1999, Cut Killer and his associates produced R&B; 2000, the collective album Double H DJ Crew, but also highly respected artists such as Fabe, Doudou Masta and 113, who managed to make their album Les Princes de la Ville a platinum record to end up winning two \\"Victoires de la Musique\\" (French music awards) in 2000. Double H is still developing with a team of street marketing, a clothing line \\"HH Wear\\", a publishing company called \\"Eastory Editions\\", followed by another production and publishing label \\"Eastory Production\\". Besides, Killer is booked by Chaos Prod agency, created by his brother Chakri. As The Hip-Hop Soul Party and Cut Killer Show series reached the top of the charts and brought in gold and platinum awards, Cut Killer delegated R&B; to his longtime accomplice, DJ Abdel, West Coast music to the specialist DJ Cream, and gave himself a try with dancehall Ragga Killa Show, before coming back to the French sound with 1 Son 2 Rue. Over the years, Cut Killer made or produced about twenty mixed albums. Fond of the cinema, Cut Killer mixed music in La Haine, where he played music from √âdith Piaf and NTM on KRS-One‚Äôs beat.Killer music in La Haine Many offers followed and he signed several tracks on the OSTs of Zak Fishman‚Äôs Gamer, Fred Garson‚Äôs The Dancer, and Miguel Courtois‚Äô Un Ange.

The program also offers graduate certificates in Applied Intelligence, Counterintelligence, and Law Enforcement Intelligence. The Intelligence Studies program \\"promotes the study of Intelligence in higher academic settings, while seeking to identify, promote, and employ best practices in the study and application of intelligence studies throughout its various disciplines (national security, law enforcement, business intelligence and academia).\\" History The Institute for Intelligence Studies (IIS) was founded in February 2004 via help from a grant from the U.S. Department of Education's Fund for the Improvement of Post-Secondary Education (FIPSE). It was named after Tom Ridge, an Erie native and the first Secretary of Homeland Security.https://www.mercyhurst.edu/ridge-college-intelligence-studies-and- applied-sciences/department-intelligence-studies For a dozen years before the opening of the institute, then Mercyhurst College offered an undergraduate degree in intelligence studies as part of its ground-breaking Research/Intelligence Analyst Program (RIAP, or R/iap). Nestled within Mercyhurst College's Department of History, RIAP was the first non- governmental initiative of its kind in the United States. The program began in 1992 with only 14 students, but the competence of graduates eventually attracted the attention of the U.S. Intelligence Community. The intense public debate in the United States immediately following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, focused on intelligence analysts need for better training, which directed attention to Mercyhurst's already-growing program. RIAP's success at the undergraduate level led to the offering of a graduate program by 2004. The Federal Bureau of Investigation instituted a sabbatical program in 2005, through which senior analysts began to attend IIS-MU for advanced training. For many years, no other school in the United States offered a degree designed specifically for intelligence analysts.Breckenridge, James, radio interview about IIS-MU on \\"We Question and Learn\\", a public interest show on FM 91.3 WQLN in Erie, Pennsylvania on 2 July 2006 Administration Robert J. Heibel, a retired Federal Bureau of Investigation special agent, founded the undergraduate program in 1992 and is now Executive Director of IIS-MU. Duncan E. McGill, Ph.D., a retired United States Army Lieutenant Colonel and former associate dean of the National Intelligence University, is the current dean of the Ridge College.  Undergraduate Program in Intelligence Studies  The Bachelor of Arts in Intelligence Studies is a four-year interdisciplinary baccalaureate program which prepares a graduate to become an entry-level analyst for employment in the government or the private sector. The undergraduate program, which continues to be referred to as RIAP, consists of nine core intelligence-related courses, plus 13 interdisciplinary courses. As of 2014, there are approximately 300 students enrolled in the undergraduate program. This includes students from across the United States as well as international students. The students primarily come from the Ohio- Pennsylvania-NY area. Certificate in Intelligence Studies IIS-MU has developed a distance-learning, graduate-level certificate program for use by contracting organizations in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. As of 2009, there are approximately 77 certificate students in the program. Graduate Program in Applied Intelligence The Masters of Science in Applied Intelligence is a thirty-four or thirty-six-credit two-year program designed to prepare graduates to pursue analyst careers in law enforcement, national security and competitive intelligence. As of 2009, there are approximately 53 graduate students in the Applied Intelligence program. The graduate program's Strategic Intelligence class participated in a joint research project with the National Intelligence Council in 2006-2007 entitled The Global Disease Threat and Its Implications for the United States. The project involved the development of a Mercyhurst wiki consisting of over 1,000 pages of analysis on the threat of global disease to the United States. Professors The program includes faculty with vast experience in a variety of disciplines. Current professors include retired or former members of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Raleigh Police Department, the US Navy, the US Department of Energy, the National Drug Intelligence Center, the US State Department, the United States Army, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Canada's Department of National Defense, the Turkish Police Academy, Fortune 50 companies, and the Erie Times-News.  Center for Information Research Analysis and Training  The Center for Information Research Analysis And Training|Center for Information Research And Training (CIRAT) is a nonprofit arm of Mercyhurst University whose mission is to develop contracts, grants and partnerships that test and enhance the capabilities of RIAP students, staff, facilities, and systems. Examples of research CIRAT has conducted: * Study of money-laundering operations for the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Financial Enforcement Network. * Case studies developed for the 1996 National Institute of Justice (NIJ) research project Pre-Incident Indicators of Terrorist Incidents Selected achievements The department enjoys success from both its students, former students and faculty members. Noteworthy achievements include: Amanda Post, an IIS-MU graduate, joined the ranks of the Federal 100, which recognizes individuals from government, industry and academia who have made significant contributions to the federal informational technology community. The awards, decided by a distinguished panel of judges, are bestowed annually by the 1105 Government Information Group and Federal Computer Week.\\"Intel Grad Named to Federal 100\\" In February 2009, Assistant Professor Stephen Marrin presented two papers at international conferences. The first paper, entitled \\"Reconceptualizing the Relationship Between CIA's Analysis and Decisionmaking: The Case of Pre-9/11 Terrorism Intelligence\\" was presented at a conference in Dublin, Ireland on The CIA & US Foreign Policy: Reform, Representations and New Approaches to Intelligence. The second, entitled \\"The Intelligence-Policy Interface and Iraq in Britain and the United States\\" was given at a workshop on Intelligence, Policy and Comparative Politics in London.\\"Professor Marrin presents two papers\\" Students in a class led by Assistant Professor Kristan Wheaton earned certificates of appreciation from coalition forces and the Iraqis for a 1,000-page WIKI-based analysis product they completed for intelligence authorities in Baghdad. The project, which examined Middle Eastern governments in the region and their reaction to events unfolding in Iraq, was provided to authorities in Iraq by another intelligence studies faculty member, U.S. Army Maj. Daniel Mulligan, who returned to Mercyhurst in early February after a year's tour of duty in Iraq. Mulligan presented the certificates on Monday, February 16, 2009 at the intelligence studies building on campus. Six IIS-MU students won the first-ever ODNI-sponsored 2008 Open Source Challenge which gave the students one week to thoroughly research, document and convincingly answer the question: \\"Is Al Qaeda a cohesive organization with strong and centralized control, intent and direction?\\" The team's answer surpassed those of more than 20 other competitors, some veterans of the U.S. intelligence community. Another team shared the first prize with Mercyhurst after it answered the second question option in the contest. That team, from iJET Intelligent Risk Systems, had two members who graduated from IIS-MU's graduate program. Mercyhurst University Institute for Intelligence Studies Press IIS-MU Press opened as a publishing house in 2005. IIS-MU cited the need for additional textbooks in the field as its reason for getting into publishing. Four books have been published as of February 2009 and others are in the works. Great Lakes Intelligence Initiative IIS-MU founded the Great Lakes Intelligence Initiative (GLII) in 2006 to promote the development and utilization of knowledge worker skills in the schools and businesses of northwestern Pennsylvania. Global Intelligence Forum IIS-MU founded and sponsors the Global Intelligence Forum each year in Dungarvan, Ireland. The conference seeks to find the best practices in intelligence analysis and see how they can be applied to other industries and companies.

History Planning for the Yamal‚ÄìEurope pipeline started in 1992. Intergovernmental agreements between Russia, Belarus and Poland were signed in 1993. In 1994, Wingas started building the Poland section of the pipeline. The first gas was delivered to Germany through the Belarus-Polish corridor in 1997. The Belarus and Polish sections were completed in September 1999 and the pipeline reached its rated annual capacity of about of natural gas in 2005, after completion of all compressor stations. Route The pipeline starts at the Torzhok gas hub in Russia and is fed by the Northern Tyumen Regions (SRTO) ‚Äì Torzhok gas pipeline. Its length includes around in Russia, in Belarus and in Poland. The German gas system is connected to the Yamal‚ÄìEurope pipeline through the JAGAL pipeline. Notwithstanding its name, the pipeline is initially supplied by gas fields in the Nadym Pur Taz District of the Tyumen Oblast and not from Yamal peninsula. It would be supplied from the Bovanenkovo field of Yamal peninsula after construction of the long Bovanenkovo-Ukhta pipeline, a part of the Yamal project. Technical features The capacity of the pipeline is of natural gas per annum. The diameter of the pipeline is . The pressure in the pipeline is provided by 14 compressor stations. Ownership The Russian section of the pipeline is owned and operated by Gazprom. The Belarusian section is owned by Gazprom and operated by Gazprom Transgaz Belarus. The Polish section is owned and operated by EuRoPol Gaz S.A., a joint venture of the Polish PGNiG, Russian Gazprom (both 48% of shares) and Polish Gas-Trading S.A. (4% of shares). Second pipeline Since 2005, there have been plans to build the second leg of the pipeline. On 1 November 2007, the Russian minister of industry and energy Viktor Khristenko said that Russia has dropped the idea of building the second leg of a pipeline, preferring construction of the Nord Stream pipeline. In 2013 Russia showed interest in reviving the project, with an estimated $5 billion investment that could lead to the completion of the pipeline by 2019.Russia revives $5bn Yamal-Europe pipeline project.

He lived in Paisley until 1915, joined the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve by claiming to be 18, then served on merchant ships until 1929. After spending some time in Australia and America (his first book, for adults, Back Door Guest, described life as a hobo in USA and Canada, and is full of social comment which was then controversial) he settled in Pimlico in 1930, marrying Elizabeth \\"Mornie\\" Birch of Penwith, Cornwall (daughter of John \\"Lamorna\\" Birch the RA painter) in 1932. These details are in his autobiography (Kerr 1940). He wrote 32 books for children, most with a nautical theme and 23 books for adults, many commenting on working class life in Scotland, America and Australia. He served on minesweepers in World War II, assisted at Omaha beach, and was Mentioned In Despatches. As an author he used, in addition to his own name, the pseudonyms \\"Douglas Gavin\\" for adult books and \\"Peter Dawlish\\" for children's books after 1938 (Bigger, 2007). Kerr was a self-proclaimed socialist, but he was never a member of the Communist Party. He joined and then left the Labour Party. He is survived by a son whose reminiscences are used by Wormleighton (1995) and Bigger (2007).

In July 1641 Parliament passed a bill on 3 May requiring those over the age of 18 to sign the Protestation, an oath of allegiance to King Charles I and the Church of England, as a way to reduce the tensions across the realm. Signing them was a necessity in order to hold public office. Those that were not willing to sign it were also listed under it as refusing to pledge its oath. An example of a list of signatures from the 1641 Protestation The Protestation was also a part of a context of political, religious, and social anxiety due to intense changes in a short period in England during the Early Modern era. As further changes and armed conflict loomed closer, both Parliament and those loyal to the king attempted to find ways to avoid it. One of the ways they found to do that was via oath of allegiances, the first of which was the Protestation. It began in May 1641 with the intention of getting all Englishmen above the age of 18 to swear a vow to defend King Charles I and the Church of England. Ultimately it failed and tensions continued to escalate between Parliament and King Charles I, eventually leading to the start of the English Civil Wars in August 1642. However, the Protestation is an enlightening historical phenomenon that help us understand the process that led to the English Civil Wars and attempts that people made to avert a costly conflict, even from those at the center of the hostilities. On the context of the English Civil Wars, the Protestation is an interesting, but often unexplored topic. A part from its implications in population census and local historiography, it provides an understanding of how people during the decade of 1640 attempted to avoid a potentially costly and bloody conflict. It happened not once, but three times until the civil wars broke out. The Protestation also fits in the timeline of the English Civil Wars, which shook the realm and altered its relationships. Their outcome was the beheading of king Charles, the temporary suspension of kingship under Oliver Cromwell's rule, and the English Restoration under Charles II, showing the complexity of events and general social anxiety reigning during Stuart England. Background The antecedents of the Protestation can be divided into political and religious aspects. Religiously, the 16th and 17th centuries were a period of vast changes and religious conflicts. Starting in 1517, the Protestant Reformation of Martin Luther began the process of ending the Catholic hegemony in Western faith and its political consequences. It reached the British Isles during the reign of Henry VIII, when multiple acts of Parliament on religious reform were passed, ultimately leading to the Break with Rome in 1534, when the Act of Supremacy was passed. Most Englishmen, however, remained Catholic and conflicts and anxiety lingered. In 1641, amid fears of the Protestant Reformation being in danger of being undone, alleged Papist plots, and Catholic influence under the court of Charles I, the House of Commons during the Long Parliament was ordered by royal decree to prepare a national declaration to help reduce the tensions across England on the matter. That national declaration became the Protestation of 1641 and was, in fact, the first of three oaths of allegiance imposed by the Long Parliament between May 1641 and September 1643, being followed by Vow and Covenant and Solemn League and Covenant. Throughout the buildup to the English Civil Wars, discontentment among Protestants for the measures of the Archbishop of Canterbury William Laud that intended to transform the Church of England into a more ceremonial one, according to the theology of Arminianism, led to conflicts between the Church of England and Puritans. In political terms, Charles was forced to end his Personal Rule and call Parliament to increase taxes so he could raise an army to put them revolts in Scotland and Ireland down. The House of Commons and the House of Lords instead, led by John Pym, focused instead on protesting against the government and were quickly dissolved by Charles as an attack against the King, being known as the Short Parliament. Charles decided to go on the offensive against the Scottish revolt without Parliament and recalled Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford from Ireland to lead his army in Scotland. Strafford had successfully controlled the Irish revolt by convincing the Catholic gentry to pay taxes in exchange of future religious benefits, thus increasing the revenue of Charles I and pacifying Ireland. However, upon Strafford's failures in the battlefield and economic shortcomings from the expenses both English and Scottish armies, as Charles I was the King of both, he followed the advice of his Magnum Concillium, the House of Lords when the Parliament was not in section, and recalled Parliament to increase taxes and raise a new army to defeat the Scottish rebellion. This Parliament is known as the Long Parliament, as it met for twenty years between 1640 and 1660. The Long Parliament, however, would turn out to be more hostile against Charles I's interests than the Short Parliament had been. Once more under the leadership of John Pym, it began to vote on laws that would limit royal power, such as with the prohibition on taxation without Parliamentary consent and the control of Parliament over the King's ministers. Even though the Members of Parliament were strongly opposed to Charles I, they also attempted to enact legislation to reduce tensions and avert the likelihood that an armed conflict between the King and Parliament, the first of them being called as the Protestation. Its intent was to prevent the conflicts between both factions from turning into a costly civil war. Protestation Reacting to scares and anxiety that the Protestant Reformation was in danger of being replaced, especially due to the Catholic influence around King Charles I, a ten-man committee of the House of Commons was selected to draft a national declaration. From this, stemmed the first oath of allegiance to King Charles I and to the Protestant Reformation in the Church of England. It was written on 3 May 1641 and passed in Parliament, soon all members of the House of Commons had swore under it and on the following day, so did the members of the House of Lords. Then, letters were sent from the speaker of the House of Commons to sheriffs of each Parish communicating them about the decision and for them to also swear into it, as well as the Judges of Peace. The final step was for the sheriffs and Judges of Peace to read it in Church and have all present sign it, which should be all of the population as they were obligated to go to church every Sunday under penalty of fine. Those that refused to sign under it were also written in the list and were deemed unfit to sit in a public office. This process lasted until February and March 1642. The text of the oath that these Englishmen were asked to swear under was the following: \\"I, _ A.B. _ do, in the presence of Almighty God, promise, vow, and protest to maintain, and defend as far as lawfully I may, with my Life, Power and Estate, the true Reformed Protestant religion, expressed in the Doctrine of the Church of England, against all Popery and Popish Innovations, within this Realm, contrary to the same Doctrine, and according to the duty of my Allegiance, to His Majesties Royal Person, Honour and Estate, as also the Power and Privileges of Parliament, the lawful Rights and Liberties of the Subjects, and any person that maketh this Protestation, in whatsoever he shall do in the lawful Pursuance of the same: and to my power, and as far as lawfully I may, I will oppose and by all good Ways and Means endeavour to bring to condign Punishment all such as shall, either by Force, Practice, Councels, Plots, Conspiracies, or otherwise, doe any thing to the contrary of any thing in this present Protestation contained: and further, that I shall, in all just and honourable ways, endeavour to preserve the Union and Peace betwixt the Three Kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland: and neither for Hope, Fear, nor other Respect, shell relinquish this Promise, Vow and Protestation.\\" By forcing all Englishmen above 18 years old to sign an oath of allegiance to King Charles I and to the Church of England, the hope was that they would unite under the King and not engage on a potentially bloody internal conflict. However, on 18 January 1642, following King Charles I's attempt to arrest the Five Members of Parliament on 4 January, the speaker of the House of Commons William Lenthall sent out an additional letter to sheriffs across England demanding that all males over 18 years old to take the oath. Lenthall's assumption was that those that refused to do so would be Catholics and thus unfit to occupy an office in the Church or State of England, as well as to facilitate identifying potential backers of King Charles I across England. However, it was not an effective way of distinguishing Catholics, as some of them signed the oath with reservations to their faith, while other Protestants refused to sign it at all. The lists were returned to Parliament later in 1642, being known the Protestation Returns. Ultimately, the Protestation failed to accomplish its goals. Had it been successful as an oath of allegiance, its two successors, the Vow and Covenant and the Solemn League and Covenant, would not have been necessary. Further, it was ineffective in uniting the realm under Charles I and averting a civil war, as the English Civil Wars began shortly after. Finally, it did not allow Parliament to distinguish between Catholics and Protestants, due to the disparity between those that signed the list and known Catholics, as per the recusancy lists. Rather than being an instrument against internal conflicts, it fed on them when Speaker Lenthall send the additional letter demanding that all men above 18 years old sign the oath as a response to Charles I's attempt to arrest the Five Members of Parliament. However, these lists have been useful to historians as a partial census of population, a guideline to estimate it, an important tool for genealogists in search of ancestors from before the English Civil Wars, and for academics interested in last name distributions before the civil wars erupted. Aftermath Following the failure of the 1641 Protestation, the Long Parliament tried two more times to organize an oath of allegiance to King Charles and the Church of England, but they saw the same fate as its predecessor. The Long Parliament then turned its focus to Thomas Wentworth, the Earl of Strafford, and accused him of treason and other minor crimes. Strafford was beloved by Charles I and the king did not want any sort of punishment against him. Not affected by this, John Pym was able to obtain notes from the King's Privy Council where Strafford claimed that Charles I was absolved from the rules of government because he had done his duty and his subject failed on theirs, thus Charles was allowed to use his army that was in Ireland to suppress all revolts against him. Soon afterwards, Pym proposed a Bill of Attainder on Strafford to execute him, which after some resistance was approved by the House of Commons and the House of Lords on 21 April 1641. Charles I initially refused to sign it, and without his signature Strafford would be safe. However, on 10 May, fearing the safety of his family, Charles I signed it and Strafford was decapitated two days later. It was hoped that with the execution of Strafford and the Protestation, tensions between Parliament and King would be deescalated, but the opposite occurred. Still in May 1641, the Long Parliament passed the Triennial Acts, demanding that Parliament meet at least at every three years, even without a Royal summons. Further, it prohibited any source of increased revenue for the Crown without Parliament consent, such as Charles I's Ship Tax. At this time, however, Parliament was still focusing its efforts against bad counselors that were blamed for Charles I's failures, and not the King himself. As conflicts escalated, both sides suspected of each other. Parliament suspected that Charles I wanted to impose Armianism on them and force them to comply to his royal prerogative by military force. Charles and royalists were distrustful and resented by the continuous Parliamentary demands, which they saw as against the king's royal prerogative and position. Neither party was able to develop the conflicts further at this point, as the Irish, fearing the imposition of Protestantism in their Catholic land rebelled and that country descended into chaos. Soon, rumors began circulating that Charles I was backing the Irish rebels and that he at anytime would turn against Puritans, just as Strafford had suggested, thus spreading panic across the Puritans. Charles I, attempting to end his Parliamentary problems once and for all, marched into Parliament on 4 January 1642, with 400 soldiers planning to arrest the Five Members of Parliament, leaders behind the demands of Parliament. However, they had fled and Charles was not able to arrest them for treason. When he asked the Speaker of the House of Commons about their location, William Lethal replied that he was a servant of Parliament and would not answer the king's requests. Just a few days afterwards, Charles I fled London for the country for his safety, while cities and towns declared itself for one of the factions, although most of England remained neutral. As Summer advanced, negotiations between King and Parliament did not lead to fruition and the stalemate remained. On 22 August 1642, Charles I raised his Royal Standard and a war that for long had been looming started as last. On one side, the Cavaliers or Loyalists were followers of the Church of England that wanted to maintain the traditional forms of government in Church and State based on the monarch. On the other, the Parliamentarians or Roundheads were Puritans that wanted to defend what they thought was the traditional form of Church and State that had been unjustly altered by Charles due to ill advice during his 11 years of personal rule. What followed was 9 years of civil wars between 1642 and 1651, the first one ending when Charles I was placed under Parliament custody and put to trial. In the succession of the trial of Charles I, he was executed for treason in 1649 and the kingship was replaced with Oliver Cromwell's Commonwealth of England. Given the outcome of the conflicts between Charles I and Parliament, it is clear in hindsight that the Protestation failed and was always bound to do so, but for people at the time under the constraints that they were under and being ignorant of the future, the Protestation was a valid try at avoiding a costly civil war.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Kusel- Altenglan, whose seat is in Kusel. Geography Location Oberstaufenbach lies between Kaiserslautern and Kusel on Landesstra√üe (State Road) 367 in the valley of the Reichenbach, a tributary to the river Glan, and at the foot of the Potzberg in the North Palatine Uplands on the river's left bank and at the foot of the Heidenburg (today a quarry) on the river's right bank. Culturally and historically, it lies in the middle of the Kusel Musikantenland (\\"Minstrels' Land\\"). The land within municipal limits exhibits a variable topography, with heights ranging from 240 to 400 m above sea level. The village's elevation is 254 m above sea level. With reference to slope, the lands within Oberstaufenbach might be described as being 10% even, 25% leaning, 45% sloped and 20% steep. The village originally arose in the dale. The municipal area measures 268 ha, of which about 37 ha is wooded and 211 ha is under agricultural use (170 ha cropland and 40 ha meadowland).Location Neighbouring municipalities Oberstaufenbach borders in the north on the municipality of Niederstaufenbach, in the southeast on the municipality of Reichenbach-Steegen, in the west on the municipality of Neunkirchen am Potzberg and in the northwest on the municipality of F√∂ckelberg. Constituent communities Also belonging to Oberstaufenbach is the outlying homestead of Birkenhof, which was built in 1965 as an Aussiedlerhof, an agricultural settlement whose goal was to enhance food production.Statistisches Landesamt Rheinland-Pfalz ‚Äì Amtliches Verzeichnis der Gemeinden und Gemeindeteile , Seite 97 (PDF) There is also the Oberstaufenbacher M√ºhle (mill).Constituent communities Municipality‚Äôs layout Oberstaufenbach can be considered a clump village with loosely scattered houses. The original settlement grew on the Reichenbach's left bank and on both sides of the Limbach. Only with the building of the road in the Reichenbach valley did residential development arise here, along the road, both towards Reichenbach and towards Niederstaufenbach. Also built were houses along former farm lanes. Over the last two decades, the slopes near the village have also been opened to extensive building development. Worthy of note is an armorial stone found on the gable at the family Grill's house. It came about 1871/1872 as a keystone from a gateway arch to Oberstaufenbach. In Weilerbach, the house's builder had acquired bits of the former Schellenberger Hof, among other things the stones from the gateway arch, when that estate was torn down. He brought them to Oberstaufenbach, thinking to use them in his own building work. He set the keystone, which bears the von Horn coat of arms, in the walling in his house's gable. As early as 1855, the municipality of Oberstaufenbach laid out its own graveyard on the way out of the village going towards Neunkirchen am Potzberg, and not many years ago, it also had a mortuary built there. The former Heidenburg (literally ‚Äú castle‚Äù) is described in literature time and again as a R√∂merkastell (‚ÄúRoman fort‚Äù). Only in the 1994 publication Oberstaufenbach im Wandel der Zeit (‚ÄúOberstaufenbach Through the Ages‚Äù) can a systematic reappraisal of this storied knoll be found. The writer came to the following conclusion: The knoll was fortified from early to middle La T√®ne times. In Roman times, nothing more than grave monuments and godstones were set up there. Reports of archaeological finds during the 19th century mention almost nothing but carved images, and conspicuous by their almost utter absence are reports of any finds of coins. Thus, any notion that a Roman fort once stood upon the knoll must be thoroughly revised. In the 10th century, there may well have been a wooden chapel standing there, and it seems likely that in the centuries that followed, this would have been replaced with a stone building. At the same time, work on a tower castle began. No later than the 12th century, this castle was provided with a girding wall and a well shaft. Nevertheless, the castle was forsaken before the Middle Ages had even ended, and hence, a written mention of it is nowhere to be found. In the 19th century, the knoll became the location for something else, a hard-stone quarry. The work there removed any remnant of the old castle that had lain there for centuries. Also unearthed at the site were pieces of Roman grave monuments, which might themselves have been used later to build the castle. In bygone centuries, the municipal area was a tangle of crisscrossing property lines, with often very small fields. In 1976, however, Flurbereinigung was undertaken, forming contiguous blocks of farmland, some quite big.Municipality‚Äôs layout History Antiquity Partial settlement, even before Roman times, can be confirmed by archaeological finds on the Heidenburg from La T√®ne times. What can also be established is that there were settlers here in Roman times. Remnants left by them were being unearthed on the Heidenburg up until the late 19th century. Despite the common assumption that there was a Roman fortification on this hilltop, there was actually only a Roman graveyard.Antiquity Middle Ages In the village of Oberhausen (see Vanished villages below), people may once again have settled within what are now Oberstaufenbach's limits as early as the 8th century. Sometime in the Early Middle Ages, a castle complex was built, in which the available Roman grave monuments would have been used. This castle was not used for very long, though, and any trace of it was finally destroyed by stone quarrying in the 19th and 20th centuries. In 1393, Oberstaufenbach had its first documentary mention in a document of bestowal from Count Friedrich of Veldenz. Professor Ernst Christmann, however, was of the opinion that there were already settlers in what is now Oberstaufenbach by 900, for Emperor Otto I in 945 granted a liegeman six K√∂nigshufen (an area of land) that lay between Bosenbach and Reichenbach, that is to say, within what are now Oberstaufenbach's and Niederstaufenbach's limits. Whatever the facts were, Oberstaufenbach was not mentioned by name in this document. Count Friedrich's 1393 document, however, in which he granted his wife Margareta von Nassau villages belonging to the √Ñmter of Reichenbach and Theisbergstegen, lists Oberstaufenbach by name, along with all the other villages that he gave his wife. About the turn of the second millennium, the village belonged to the Imperial Domain (Reichsland) near Kaiserslautern. Back then, Oberstaufenbach was considered part of the Amt of Deinsberg (Thei√überg) am Glan, where the parochial seat could also be found. This Amt ended up by pledge in the ownership of the Counts of Veldenz and passed in 1444 to the Counts Palatine (later Dukes) of Palatinate- Zweibr√ºcken as rightful heirs to the County of Veldenz.Middle AgesOberstaufenbach‚Äôs history Modern times In 1543, the Amt area, now described as the Jettenbacher Gericht (‚Äúcourt‚Äù), was grouped into the then newly formed Principality of Veldenz-Lauterecken. Also belonging to this until 1697 was Oberstaufenbach. It was then that Electoral Palatinate troops occupied the former Veldenz √Ñmter of Lauterecken and Reichenbach to lend weight to the Electorate's inheritance claims. In the end, the Amt of Reichenbach remained with Electoral Palatinate as of 1733.Modern times Recent times During the time of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic era that followed, the German lands on the Rhine‚Äôs left bank were annexed by France. Oberstaufenbach now belonged to the Mairie (‚ÄúMayoralty‚Äù) of Bosenbach, the Canton of Wolfstein, the Arrondissement of Kaiserslautern and the Department of Mont-Tonnerre (or Donnersberg in German). After the French were driven out in 1814, the Congress of Vienna established a new political order in post-Napoleonic Europe. In 1816, after a transitional time, Oberstaufenbach was grouped into the bayerischer Rheinkreis, later known as Rheinpfalz (‚ÄúRhenish Palatinate‚Äù), an exclave of the Kingdom of Bavaria. More locally, Oberstaufenbach was grouped into the B√ºrgermeisterei (‚ÄúMayoralty‚Äù) of Neunkirchen, the Canton of Wolfstein and the Landkommissariat of Kusel. After the Second World War, Oberstaufenbach found itself in the then newly founded state of Rhineland-Palatinate. Until the formation of the Verbandsgemeinden in 1972, Oberstaufenbach was assigned to the B√ºrgermeisterei (‚ÄúMayoralty‚Äù) of Neunkirchen am Potzberg. Upon formation of the Verbandsgemeinden, Oberstaufenbach found itself in the Verbandsgemeinde of Altenglan in the Kusel district.Recent times Only in 1975 did the municipality finally decide to undertake Flurbereinigung after eight landowners put forth a proposal that led to approval by municipal council on 16 October of that year. The municipality received a subsidy covering 87% of the cost of rearranging properties, which resulted in, among other things, the utter obliteration of the old network of paths and the laying out of a whole new one. Roughly 5 km of farm lanes were paved with blacktop and a footpath and cycle path was built from Oberstaufenbach to Niederstaufenbach. Further, the new building area ‚ÄúHahnwege‚Äù was surveyed and subdivided; part of the existing village was also surveyed.Oberstaufenbach‚Äôs history The Heidenburg Since the 19th century, the Heidenburg (literally ‚Äú castle‚Äù) has been known as R√∂merkastell (‚ÄúRoman fort‚Äù). Beginning about 1855, this melaphyr-bearing land was a stone quarry where paving stones were made. These were sold as far away as France. Beginning in 1862, the municipally owned land was let to various tenants. The considerable income from rent led to the municipality being rather well off. Only in 1885 were archaeological investigations begun and a survey of the remaining ruins undertaken. By this time, a good three fourths of the complex had fallen victim to quarrying. The quarrymen's statements allowed investigators to reconstruct the ringwall's alignment at least. According to these, the Heidenburg had once had an oval fortification with an almost straight south wall. The ringwall had a breadth of 1.50 to 1.80 m and enclosed an area about 100 m long and 69 m wide. Buildings still stood, but only in the southern part of the complex that had still been preserved in 1855. A well 90 cm in diameter could be traced to a depth of 40 m, but the bottom could not be reached. On the southeastern side, two nearly complete buildings were observed, but of a third only one wall remained. The use of mortar in the masonry and the lack of any clearly Roman materials give rise to doubts about the complex dating from Roman times. Rather, it would seem, going by archaeological finds, to be a castle complex from the High Middle Ages, the 11th and 12th centuries, but whatever nobles owned it is quite unknown.Oberstaufenbach‚Äôs history Population development Oberstaufenbach was originally inhabited only by farmers, but bit by bit, many villagers also sought livelihoods in quarries and mines. Today the village is a residential community for people of the most varied of occupations, who for the most part are commuting to jobs outside the village. In the future, the village will gain importance for recreation seekers and tourism. During the 19th century, population figures kept rising steadily, if not very quickly, even though emigration was taking place. A drop in the earlier half of the 20th century can be explained by emigration and migrations to other parts of Germany. In the latter half of the 20th century, there was for a short while considerable growth in population figures fostered by the village's favourable location near both Kusel and Kaiserslautern. This development, though, does not seem to be continuing.

Prefixed to this is the syllable stauf‚Äî, from the Middle High German word Stouf, defined as ‚Äútowering rock, comparable to an upended beaker without a bottom‚Äù. Historical forms of the name are, among others, Stauffenbach (1377), ober Stauffenbach (1393), Stauffenbach (1430), Oberstauffenbach (1567), Ober Stauffenbach (1593) and Oberstaufenbach (1824). The name is drawn from the former melaphyre deposit north of the village, which has now been quarried away. This towering mountain knoll was described as a Stouf in earlier times, giving the village part of its name. The brook that flows by here may well have been called the Staufenbach at that time, and hence the name means a brook that flows between stones and cliffs. Over the ages, however, the name Reichenbach came to be applied to the whole brook, a name drawn from the neighbouring village of Reichenbach.Municipality‚Äôs name The prefix Ober‚Äî means ‚Äúupper‚Äù, and now distinguishes Oberstaufenbach from nearby Niederstaufenbach. Vanished villages Oberhausen, a village that arose in the 8th century, might have lain where now the road leaves Oberstaufenbach on the way to Reichenbach. There are still a few rural cadastral names just there that commemorate the old village.Vanished villages Religion In the Middle Ages, Oberstaufenbach belonged to the parish of Deinsberg (Theisberg). After a chapel was built in Neunkirchen am Potzberg, villagers attended services there. The pastor from Deinsberg had to hold these services. After the Reformation, a chaplain, who at least temporarily lived in Neunkirchen, was responsible for the chapel. In the latter half of the 16th century, the parish of Neunkirchen was tended by the Lutheran pastor in Bosenbach. When in 1588 the Duke of Palatinate-Zweibr√ºcken completed the changeover to the Reformed faith, the Neunkirchen congregation, which was a Veldenz holding, had to hire their own pastor. Indeed, in the Veldenz Amt of Reichenbach, the inhabitants remained Lutheran throughout the time from the Reformation to the Union of the two Protestant denominations in the early 19th century. Only in 1746 was a Reformed parish established at Neunkirchen to serve the few Calvinists in the Amt of Reichenbach. In 1825, the Protestant share of Oberstaufenbach's population was some 80%. Today, they are still parochially united with Neunkirchen. Oberstaufenbach's few Catholics have been attending services in Reichenbach ever since a new Catholic parish was established there. This arrangement has stood to this day. Besides a chapel that might once have stood in the area of the mediaeval castle complex, there has never been a church in Oberstaufenbach itself. However, in 2000, the game tenant Kolb had a chapel built in Oberstaufenbach, consecrated to Saint Hubert. Disagreements with the building authorities resulted in a partial dismantling of this chapel, which stands on the village's outskirts.Religion Politics Municipal council The council is made up of 6 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat Mayor Oberstaufenbach's mayor is Willi Junk, and his deputies are Andreas Burchert and Dirk M√ºller.Oberstaufenbach‚Äôs council Coat of arms The German blazon reads: '''' The municipality's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Sable issuant from base and dexter crags Or and to sinister a lion rampant of the same armed, langued and crowned gules, on a chief argent a fess wavy azure. Oberstaufenbach's arms bear the same charges in the same composition as Niederstaufenbach's. The only heraldic difference lies in the tinctures. Those in the main field are the ones formerly borne by the Duchy of Palatinate-Zweibr√ºcken in its arms, while the tinctures on the chief are the ones formerly borne by the Counts of Veldenz in their arms. Both these states were once lords. The lion is a reference to the village's former allegiance to Electoral Palatinate. The crags and the wavy fess on the chief are canting charges for the municipality's name, Stauf being an archaic word for ‚Äúcrag‚Äù in German (the usual word is Fels or Felsen), and the wavy fess standing for a brook, or in German, Bach.Description and explanation of Oberstaufenbach‚Äôs arms Culture and sightseeing Buildings The following are listed buildings or sites in Rhineland-Palatinate‚Äôs Directory of Cultural Monuments:Directory of Cultural Monuments in Kusel district * At Hauptstra√üe 5 ‚Äì armorial stone of the Barons of Horn * At Hohlstra√üe 2 ‚Äì elaborate post- Baroque sandstone portal, about 1800 * Hohlstra√üe 4 ‚Äì corner estate, essentially from the late 18th century; timber-frame building plastered, partly solid, expansion 1828, conversion of commercial building 1853 * Hohlstra√üe 6 ‚Äì three-sided estate, 1823; Quereinhaus (a combination residential and commercial house divided for these two purposes down the middle, perpendicularly to the street), expansion after 1845 * M√ºhlwaldstra√üe 2, former mill (monumental zone) ‚Äì group of houses consisting of house with mill wing, 1791, two commercial buildings, 19th century; Roman spolia Natural monuments Oberstaufenbach has two notable natural monuments, both of them limetrees planted in 1896. If one goes through the village towards Reichenbach, one first comes to the Bismarcklinde, which was planted in the former Imperial President‚Äôs honour (he had been dismissed from office six years earlier by Kaiser Wilhelm II). On the other side of the bridge stands the Luitpoldlinde, which was planted in Bavarian Prince Regent Luitpold‚Äôs honour (the Palatinate was a Bavarian exclave at the time).Natural monuments Regular events The local customs are the ones that are generally found in the Westrich, an historic region that encompasses areas in both Germany and France. The kermis (church consecration festival, locally known as the Kerwe) is held on the third weekend in September.Regular events Clubs About 1900, Oberstaufenbach had a Waffenbr√ºderverein (‚Äúbrothers in arms club‚Äù), a singing club and a pig husbandry club. As of 2005, there are a Heidenburgverein (dedicated to the castle), a Stammtisch and a women's choir.Clubs Economy and infrastructure Economic structure In the 19th century Oberstaufenbach had a few major homesteads belonging to wealthy farmers. They kept the Glan-Donnersberg breed of cattle, typical of this part of the country. Quite early on ‚Äì before 1900 ‚Äì a threshing cooperative arose in Oberstaufenbach, one that maintained a threshing machine with a traction engine. At the knoll at the top of the do-called Heidenburg, work began at a hard-stone quarry. Paving stones were mainly what was made there. The knoll was repeatedly, but with interruptions, let to various parties. The quarry was finally given up about 1960. The Oberstaufenbacher M√ºhle (mill) with its overshot waterwheel may well have been built in the 16th century. It had its first documentary mention in 1571. The mill was in Erbbestand (a uniquely German landhold arrangement in which ownership rights and usage rights were separated; this is forbidden by law in modern Germany) and belonged to the Duke of Palatinate-Zweibr√ºcken. In 1600, it passed to the Veldenz comital line at Lauterecken. It had to be built all over again after the Thirty Years' War, but that was done quite quickly. In the 18th century, the mill had both gristmilling and husking functions. In the late 18th century, it had two waterwheels, although the two were seldom run at once, for the water availability was usually low. The mill was shut down for good after the Second World War. Worthy of note for being among the village's few craft businesses are the family Engel's smithy and locksmith‚Äôs shop. Over many generations, the family Engel ran a farrier‚Äôs and wainwright‚Äôs shop. Today, farm equipment is repaired here and locksmith's products are made.Economic structure Education In 1845, Oberstaufenbach had a one-room schoolhouse that had been built as early as 1824. About 1960, the village had a one-class Protestant denominational school. Today, primary school pupils attend classes at the primary school in Neunkirchen am Potzberg, while Hauptschule students attend the Regionale Schule in Altenglan.Education Transport Oberstaufenbach lies on Landesstra√üe 367, which links Altenglan with Kaiserslautern. In the village itself, Landesstra√üe 364 branches off Landesstra√üe 367. This leads by the Potzberg's peak and links Oberstaufenbach with the Glan near Gimsbach, an outlying centre of Matzenbach. Fourteen kilometres to the southwest runs the Autobahn A 62 (Kaiserslautern‚ÄìTrier) with its Glan-M√ºnchweiler and Konken interchanges, each some 10 km away. Also lying roughly 10 km away is the Kaiserslautern West interchange on the Autobahn A 6 (Saarbr√ºcken‚ÄìMannheim).Transport Serving Theisbergstegen is a railway station on the Landstuhl‚ÄìKusel railway, which is served by Regionalbahn service RB 67, called the Glantalbahn (the name of which refers to the Glan Valley Railway, which shared some of the route of the Landstuhl‚ÄìKusel line, including at Theisbergstegen). Recent developments Oberstaufenbach was once characterized by agriculture, but has undergone a shift to a residential community. The village's geographical location puts it in a thinly settled and economically weak region. Roughly 90% of the population is made up of commuters, earning their livelihoods mainly in the Kaiserslautern area. In 1975, the municipality's then population figure of 164 was nearly doubled by the opening of several new building areas. Roughly 120 Americans live in Oberstaufenbach, these being NATO personnel and their families. The village lies a mere 15 km from Ramstein Air Base, and these personnel make up twenty- five percent of Oberstaufenbach's population. People Sons and daughters of the town * Daniel Kuntz (b. 1860; d. 1959 in Boston), musician Oberstaufenbach's village square features an old vaulted basement upon which the festival hall has been built. Originally, though, this basement bore an old house that had to be torn down because it had fallen into disrepair. This was unfortunate, for this house had been the one where the violinist and musician Daniel Kuntz had been born. He was born here on 19 April 1860 and was one of the Wandermusikanten, travelling musicians who went around the world to earn their livelihood at their craft between 1861 and 1922. He later had musical training in the United States. Kuntz was one of the Boston Symphony Orchestra‚Äôs founding members, and he remained a member for 33 years. He enjoyed worldwide fame, bearing witness to which was his engagement at the age of 31 as a violin soloist at Bayreuth‚Äôs Festspielhaus. Daniel Kuntz died in Boston at the age of 99. He was the last surviving musician from the Boston Symphony Orchestra's founding season.Daniel Entry about Daniel Kuntz at StokowskiFamous people References External links *Oberstaufenbach *Municipality‚Äôs official webpage Category:Municipalities in Rhineland- Palatinate Category:Kusel (district) ","title":"Oberstaufenbach"},{"id":"7219081","text":"Apollo Bridge Pr√≠stavn√Ω most, view toward Petr≈æalka Pr√≠stavn√Ω most (literally Harbour Bridge, until 1993 known as Most hrdinov Dukly or Dukla Heroes' Bridge) is a double-floor motorway-railroad truss bridge over the Danube in Bratislava, Slovakia, near the Port of Bratislava.

The Gelida Funicular (; ) is a funicular railway in the municipality of Gelida in Catalonia, Spain. The line connects Gelida station, on the RENFE (Spanish National Railways), with the centre of the village of Gelida, which is at a higher level. The line was opened in 1924 and modernised in 1984, whilst retaining a heritage ambience. The funicular has the following technical parameters: *Length: '''' *Height: '''' *Maximum Steepness: 22.2 % *Cars: 2 *Capacity: 50 passengers per car; 700 passengers per hour *Configuration: Single track with passing loop *Maximum speed: '''' *Travel time: 8 minutes *Track gauge: '''' *Traction: Electricity Although two cars were in operation, as an economy measure only one was normally staffed and carried passengers, whilst the other simply served as a counterweight. Despite this restriction, the funicular was timed to connect with the main line trains, which operate every half-hour on weekdays and hourly on weekends. Besides the two terminals at Gelida Inferior and Superior, the line served an intermediate request stop at Gelida-Baixador, situated between the passing loop and upper station. In September 2011, the service was suspended due to government's spending cuts, as it was considered too expensive to maintain. Since then the service has been replaced by a shuttle bus, with the funicular operating only at weekends. The service was suspended on 6 March 2016 following a review in which a number of cracks were detected in the rolling elements but is operational again (at weekends) from April 6, 2019.

The carboxysomes appear as polyhedral dark structures. Synechococcus (from the Greek synechos, in succession, and the Greek kokkos, granule) is a unicellular cyanobacterium that is very widespread in the marine environment. Its size varies from 0.8 to 1.5 ¬µm. The photosynthetic coccoid cells are preferentially found in well‚Äìlit surface waters where it can be very abundant (generally 1,000 to 200,000 cells per ml). Many freshwater species of Synechococcus have also been described. The genome of S. elongatus strain PCC7002 has a size of 3,008,047 bp, whereas the oceanic strain WH8102 has a genome of size 2.4 Mbp.  Introduction  Synechococcus is one of the most important components of the prokaryotic autotrophic picoplankton in the temperate to tropical oceans. The genus was first described in 1979, and was originally defined to include \\"small unicellular cyanobacteria with ovoid to cylindrical cells that reproduce by binary traverse fission in a single plane and lack sheaths\\". This definition of the genus Synechococcus contained organisms of considerable genetic diversity and was later subdivided into subgroups based on the presence of the accessory pigment phycoerythrin. The marine forms of Synechococcus are coccoid cells between 0.6 and 1.6 ¬µm in size. They are Gram-negative cells with highly structured cell walls that may contain projections on their surface. Electron microscopy frequently reveals the presence of phosphate inclusions, glycogen granules, and more importantly, highly structured carboxysomes. Cells are known to be motile by a gliding method and a novel uncharacterized, nonphototactic swimming method that does not involve flagellar motion. While some cyanobacteria are capable of photoheterotrophic or even chemoheterotrophic growth, all marine Synechococcus strains appear to be obligate photoautotrophs that are capable of supporting their nitrogen requirements using nitrate, ammonia, or in some cases urea as a sole nitrogen source. Marine Synechococcus species are traditionally not thought to fix nitrogen. In the last decade, several strains of Synechococcus elongatus have been produced in laboratory environments to include the fastest growing cyanobacteria to date, Synechococcus elongatus UTEX 2973. S. elongatus UTEX 2973 is a mutant hybrid from UTEX 625 and is most closely related to S. elongatus PCC 7942 with 99.8% similarity (Yu et al, 2015). It has the shortest doubling time at ‚Äú1.9 hours in a BG11 medium at 41¬∞C under continuous 500 Œºmoles photons¬∑m‚àí2¬∑s‚àí1 white light with 3% CO2‚Äù (Racharaks et al, 2019). Pigments The main photosynthetic pigment in Synechococcus is chlorophyll a, while its major accessory pigments are phycobiliprotein. The four commonly recognized phycobilins are phycocyanin, allophycocyanin, allophycocyanin B and phycoerythrin. In addition Synechococcus also contains zeaxanthin but no diagnostic pigment for this organism is known. Zeaxanthin is also found in Prochlorococcus, red algae and as a minor pigment in some chlorophytes and eustigmatophytes. Similarly, phycoerythrin is also found in rhodophytes and some cryptomonads. Phylogeny Phylogenetic description of Synechococcus is difficult. Isolates are morphologically very similar, yet exhibit a G+C content ranging from 39 to 71%, illustrating the large genetic diversity of this provisional taxon. Initially, attempts were made to divide the group into three subclusters, each with a specific range of genomic G+C content. The observation that open-ocean isolates alone nearly span the complete G+C spectrum, however, indicates that Synechococcus is composed of at least several species. Bergey's Manual (Herdman et al. 2001) now divides Synechococcus into five clusters (equivalent to genera) based on morphology, physiology, and genetic traits. Cluster 1 includes relatively large (1‚Äì1.5 ¬µm) nonmotile obligate photoautotrophs that exhibit low salt tolerance. Reference strains for this cluster are PCC6301 (formerly Anacycstis nidulans) and PCC6312, which were isolated from fresh water in Texas and California, respectively. Cluster 2 also is characterized by low salt tolerance. Cells are obligate photoautrotrophs, lack phycoerythrin, and are thermophilic. The reference strain PCC6715 was isolated from a hot spring in Yellowstone National Park. Cluster 3 includes phycoerythrin-lacking marine Synechococcus species that are euryhaline, i.e. capable of growth in both marine and freshwater environments. Several strains, including the reference strain PCC7003, are facultative heterotrophs and require vitamin B12 for growth. Cluster 4 contains a single isolate, PCC7335. This strain is obligate marine. This strain contains phycoerthrin and was first isolated from the intertidal zone in Puerto Pe√±asco, Mexico. The last cluster contains what had previously been referred to as ‚Äòmarine A and B clusters‚Äô of Synechococcus. These cells are truly marine and have been isolated from both the coastal and the open ocean. All strains are obligate photoautrophs and are around 0.6‚Äì1.7 ¬µm in diameter. This cluster is, however, further divided into a population that either contains (cluster 5.1) or does not contain (cluster 5.2) phycoerythrin. The reference strains are WH8103 for the phycoerythrin-containing strains and WH5701 for those strains that lack this pigment. More recently, Badger et al. (2002) proposed the division of the cyanobacteria into a Œ±- and a Œ≤-subcluster based on the type of rbcL (large subunit of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) found in these organisms. Œ±-cyanobacteria were defined to contain a form IA, while Œ≤-cyanobacteria were defined to contain a form IB of this gene. In support for this division Badger et al. analyze the phylogeny of carboxysomal proteins, which appear to support this division. Also, two particular bicarbonate transport systems appear to only be found in Œ±-cyanobacteria, which lack carboxysomal carbonic anhydrases. The complete phylogenetic tree of 16S rRNA sequences of Synechococcus revealed at least 12 groups, which morphologically correspond to Synechococcus, but they have not derived from the common ancestor. Moreover, it has been estimated based on molecular dating that the first Synechococcus lineage has appeared 3 billion years ago in thermal springs with subsequent radiation to marine and freshwater environments. Ecology and distribution Synechococcus has been observed to occur at concentrations ranging between a few cells to 106 cells per ml in virtually all regions of oceanic euphotic zone except in samples from the McMurdo Sound and Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica. Cells are generally much more abundant in nutrient-rich environments than in the oligotrophic ocean and prefer the upper, well-lit portion of the euphotic zone. Synechococcus has also been observed to occur at high abundances in environments with low salinities and/or low temperatures. It is usually far outnumbered by Prochlorococcus in all environments where they co-occur. Exceptions to this rule are areas of permanently enriched nutrients such as upwelling areas and coastal watersheds. In the nutrient-depleted areas of the oceans, such as the central gyres, Synechococcus is apparently always present, although only at low concentrations, ranging from a few to 4√ó10¬≥ cells per ml. Vertically Synechococcus is usually relatively equitably distributed throughout the mixed layer and exhibits an affinity for the higher-light areas. Below the mixed layer, cell concentrations rapidly decline. Vertical profiles are strongly influenced by hydrologic conditions and can be very variable both seasonally and spatially. Overall, Synechococcus abundance often parallels that of Prochlorococcus in the water column. In the Pacific high- nutrient, low-chlorophyll zone and in temperate open seas where stratification was recently established both profiles parallel each other and exhibit abundance maxima just about the subsurface chlorophyll maximum. The factors controlling the abundance of Synechococcus still remain poorly understood, especially considering that even in the most nutrient-depleted regions of the central gyres, where cell abundances are often very low, population growth rates are often high and not drastically limited. Factors such as grazing, viral mortality, genetic variability, light adaptation, and temperature, as well as nutrients are certainly involved, but remain to be investigated on a rigorous and global scale. Despite the uncertainties, a relationship probably exists between ambient nitrogen concentrations and Synechococcus abundance, with an inverse relationship to Prochlorococcus in the upper euphotic zone, where light is not limiting. One environment where Synechococcus thrives particularly well is coastal plumes of major rivers. Such plumes are coastally enriched with nutrients such as nitrate and phosphate, which drives large phytoplankton blooms. High productivity in coastal river plumes is often associated with large populations of Synechococcus and elevated form IA (cyanobacterial) rbcL mRNA. Prochlorococcus is thought to be at least 100 times more abundant than Synechococcus in warm oligotrophic waters. Assuming average cellular carbon concentrations, it has thus been estimated that Prochlorococcus accounts for at least 22 times more carbon in these waters, thus may be of much greater significance to the global carbon cycle than Synechococcus.

Early life  Raneri grew up in Glen Oaks Village, Queens, New York for which the band takes its name. He founded Bayside while still attending Benjamin N. Cardozo High School in the late 1990s.  Solo career  By way of his blog, Twitter account and various interviews, there has also been talk of a solo release from frontman Anthony Raneri. On December 4, 2009, at 12:00 am he released a demo version of \\"The Ballad of Bill the Saint\\" on his personal Myspace page, the first recorded song from his upcoming solo album. According to Raneri, the song was recorded one night in Chris Kirkpatrick's studio in his own home, after the two met at one of Raneri's solo shows in Orlando, Florida. On January 22, 2011 in an interview with Alternative Press, Raneri stated that he has no plans to release a solo album any time soon, as he only does his solo work for fun. However, as recently as August 20, 2011, Raneri stated at a solo show he was playing in Rhode Island, \\"I was thinking about maybe putting out a solo record next year,\\" and also went on to say that he had not revealed to his record label of his intentions about putting out a solo album yet, but joked that they would know of his intentions after he would post a video of the show on the internet. Raneri began recording his solo EP on December 13 in Los Angeles, CA. Steve Choi from RxBandits, Davey Warsop from Beat Union and Jarrod Alexander of My Chemical Romance were announced as his backing band and collaborators on the recording. On December 20, 2011, it was announced via Facebook that the solo EP was named New Cathedrals and was scheduled for an early 2012 release. On December 31, Raneri posted to his Facebook page that the EP would be released before the start of the \\"Where's the Band? Tour\\" in January. On January 10, 2012, the first song from the EP, \\"Sandra Partial\\", was released for free streaming on Alternative Press. Also, via his Facebook page, Raneri released the artwork and track list of the EP. On January 16, another song from the EP, entitled \\"Please Don't Leave\\", was released on AbsolutePunk. That same day the full EP was released on iTunes, and within hours made it to number seven on the iTunes Store Top 10 Alternative Albums chart. On June 30, 2015, Raneri put out his second solo EP titled Sorry State of Mind. The album was released through Hopeless Records. Personal life In 2009, Raneri married his longtime girlfriend Nicole Pettas, but the couple divorced after two years of marriage. Anthony subsequently remarried in 2013 to Mia Graffam. His wife Mia gave birth to the couple's first daughter named Georgia born in 2013. In early 2015, Raneri announced he had separated from his wife. He currently resides in Franklin, Tennessee. In late 2015, upon returning to the United States from Bayside's European Tour, Raneri and his wife divorced, whereby each would retain some custody of their daughter. While he was going through this process he lived in a motel in Franklin, Tennessee, unable to return to his native New York, due to his daughter's proximity to the Nashville area, he was essentially stuck in Franklin. Lyrics for Bayside's seventh album Vacancy were mostly penned by Raneri while he lived alone in a motel. The album would later get the name Vacancy with the front cover showing a picture of the motel Raneri stayed in. Raneri stated during a live video on Facebook that he is dyslexic.

In 1883 he defended Surendranath Banerjee in contempt of court case against him in the Calcutta High Court. He was the fellow of Calcutta University and was the president of its law faculty. He retired from the Calcutta bar in 1901. He presided over the first session of the Indian National Congress held at Bombay in 1885 from 28 December to 31 December. In the 1886 session held at Calcutta, he proposed the formation of standing committees of the Congress in each province for the better co-ordination of its work and it was on this occasion that he advocated that the Congress should confine its activities to political matters only. He was the president of the Indian National Congress again in the 1892 session in Allahabad where he denounced the position that India had to prove for worthiness of political freedom. He moved to Britain and practiced before the Privy Council. He financed the British Committee of Congress and its journals in London.

He belonged to a very respectable Rarhi Kulin Brahmin family who hailed from Baganda, Howrah District in present-day state of West Bengal. His grandfather Pitambur Bonnerjee first migrated to Calcutta (now Kolkata) and settled there. From his mother's side, Womesh Chandra was descended from the renowned Sanskrit scholar and philosopher Pundit Juggonath Turkopunchanun of Tribeni, Hooghly District in present-day West Bengal.A General Biography of Bengal Celebrities (vol. 1), Sanyal, Ram Gopal, printed and published by Uma Churn Chuckerbutty, 1889, p. 35  Early days  Womesh Chandra Bonnerjee studied at the Oriental Seminary and the Hindu School. In 1859, he married Hemangini Motilal. His career began in 1862 when he joined the firm of W. P. Gillanders, attorneys of the Calcutta Supreme Court, as a clerk. In this post he acquired a good knowledge of law which greatly helped him in his later career. In 1864 he was sent to England through a scholarship from Mr. R. J. Jijibhai of Bombay where he joined the Middle Temple and was called to the Bar in June, 1867. On his return to Calcutta in 1868, he found a patron in Sir Charles Paul, Barrister-at-Law of the Calcutta High Court. Another barrister, J. P. Kennedy, also greatly helped him to establish his reputation as a lawyer. Within a few years he became the most sought after barrister in the High Court.

In the 1886 session held at Calcutta, under the presidency of Dadabhai Naoroji, he proposed the formation of standing committees of the Congress in each province for the better co-ordination of its work and it was on this occasion that he advocated that the Congress should confine its activities to political matters only, leaving the question of social reforms to other organisations. He was the president of the Indian National Congress again in the 1892 session in Allahabad where he denounced the position that India had to prove for worthiness of political freedom.Lacy, Creighton (1965).

The class included only one sister ship, . Andrea Doria was named after the 16th-century Genoese admiral of the same name. Laid down in March 1912, the battleship was launched a year later in March 1913, and completed in March 1916. She was armed with a main battery of thirteen guns and had a top speed of . Andrea Doria saw no major action in World War I, and served extensively in Mediterranean in the 1920s and 1930s. She was involved in the suppression of rebels in Fiume and the Corfu incident in the 1920s. Starting in 1937, Andrea Doria underwent an extensive modernization, which lasted until 1940. She saw relatively little action during World War II; she was tasked with escorting convoys to Libya throughout 1941 and into 1942, during which she engaged in the inconclusive First Battle of Sirte. After the Armistice in September 1943 the ship was sailed to Malta and interned by the Allies. She remained there until 1944, when she was permitted to return to Italian ports. Andrea Doria survived the war and soldiered on in the post-war navy as a training ship until 1956. Paid off in September, she was formally stricken from the naval register on 1 November and sold for scrapping later that year. Design Right elevation and deck plan of the Andrea Doria class. Andrea Doria was long overall; she had a beam of and a draft of . At full combat load, she displaced up to . She had a crew of 35 officers and 1,198 enlisted men. She was powered by four Parsons steam turbines, with steam provided by eight oil-fired and twelve coal and oil-burning Yarrow boilers. The boilers were trunked into two large funnels. The engines were rated at , which provided a top speed of . She had a cruising radius of at .Gardiner & Gray, p. 260 The ship was armed with a main battery of thirteen 46-caliber guns in three triple turrets and two twin turrets. The secondary battery comprised sixteen 45-caliber guns, all mounted in casemates clustered around the forward and aft main battery turrets. Andrea Doria was also armed with thirteen 50-caliber guns and six 76-mm anti-aircraft guns. As was customary for capital ships of the period, she was equipped with three submerged torpedo tubes. She was protected with Krupp cemented steel manufactured by Terni. The belt armor was thick and the main deck was thick. The conning tower and main battery turrets were protected with worth of armor plating. Modifications Andrea Doria was heavily rebuilt in 1937-1940 at Trieste. Her forecastle deck was extended further aft, until it reached the mainmast. The stern and bow were rebuilt, increasing the length of the ship to , and the displacement grew to . Her old machinery was replaced with more efficient equipment and her twenty boilers were replaced with eight oil-fired models; the new power plant was rated at and speed increased to . The ship's amidships turret was removed and the remaining guns were bored out to . Her secondary battery was completely overhauled; the 152 mm guns were replaced with twelve guns in triple turrets amidships. The anti-aircraft battery was significantly improved, to include ten guns, fifteen 54-cal. guns, and sixteen guns. Later, during World War II, four more 37 mm guns were installed and two of the 20 mm guns were removed. After emerging from the modernization, Andrea Dorias crew numbered 35 officers and 1,450 enlisted men.Gardiner & Chesneau, p. 284Fraccaroli, p. 16 Service history Andrea Doria during World War I Andrea Doria, named for the 16th century Genoese admiral of the same name, was laid down at the La Spezia shipyard in Naples on 24 March 1912. She was launched on 30 March 1913 and completed by 13 March 1916. The Austro-Hungarian Navy, which had been Italy's primary rival for decades, was the primary opponent in the conflict. The Austro-Hungarian battle fleet lay in its harbors directly across the narrow Adriatic Sea and did not emerge for the duration of the conflict. In addition, Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel, the Italian naval chief of staff, believed that Austro-Hungarian submarines and minelayers could operate too effectively in the narrow waters of the Adriatic. The threat from these underwater weapons to his capital ships was too serious for him to use the fleet in an active way.Halpern, p. 150 Instead, Revel decided to implement blockade at the relatively safer southern end of the Adriatic with the battle fleet, while smaller vessels, such as the MAS boats, conducted raids on Austro-Hungarian ships and installations. Meanwhile, Revel's battleships would be preserved to confront the Austro-Hungarian battle fleet in the event that it sought a decisive engagement.Halpern, pp. 141-142 Starting in November 1918, Andrea Doria was based in Taranto. On 10 November, she was sent to Corfu, where she remained until 19 February 1919. She then returned to Taranto, before proceeding to Constantinople in July, departing on the 4th and arriving on the 9th of the month. She joined an Allied fleet in the city and remained there until 9 November, when she returned again to Taranto. In 1920, most of the Italian fleet was temporarily demobilized to provide crews to bring ex-German warships that had been awarded to Italy under the Treaty of Versailles; Andrea Doria was the only battleship to remain operational during the period. In November, the Treaty of Rapallo was signed with the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. Andrea Doria was sent to remove the rebellious forces of Gabriele d'Annunzio from Fiume that month. On 24 December, she joined the attack on Fiume, and two days later fired three salvos from her 76 mm guns at the destroyer , which had rebelled and joined d'Annunzio. Andrea Dorias gunfire badly damaged Espero. Andrea Doria also shelled d'Annunzio's headquarters and wounded him; he surrendered on 31 December.Whitley, p. 167 During the 1923 Corfu incident with Greece, the Italian Navy, including Andrea Doria, was deployed to occupy the island of Corfu following the murder of Enrico Tellini and four others. Following the peaceful resolution of the incident, Andrea Doria visited Spain. On 16 January 1925, Andrea Doria visited Lisbon to participate in the 400th anniversary of the death of Vasco de Gama. She thereafter went to La Spezia for a refit, which began on 7 February and was completed by June. Following civil unrest in Syria, Andrea Doria steamed to the eastern Mediterranean with a squadron of destroyers in the event that Italian nationals would need to be evacuated. The ships remained docked in Leros until 12 December, by which time the disturbances in Syria had been calmed down. She spent the next six years on normal peacetime duties, until she was withdrawn from service in August 1932. She was placed in reserve in Taranto, with a skeleton crew for maintenance. In March 1937, she started the major reconstruction in Trieste, where she arrived on the 30th. The refit began on 8 April at the Cantieri Riuniti dell'Adriatico shipyard. World War II Andrea Doria sailing to Malta for internment, September 9, 1943. Andrea Doria was still out of service in 1939 when the Second World War broke out in Europe. Work was finished by October 1940, and on the 26th of the month, she rejoined the Italian fleet in the 5th Division in Taranto. She was undamaged by the British attack on Taranto on the night of 11-12 November, and was sent to Naples on the 12th.Whitley, p. 168Rohwer, p. 27 In early December, the Italian Navy reorganized the fleet; Andrea Doria remained in the 5th Division, along with the battleship .Rohwer, p. 51 She undertook her first operation in early January with the new battleship in response to Operation Excess, a complex series of British convoys to Malta. The Italian battleships were unable to locate any British forces, and so returned to port by 11 January. On 8 February, Andrea Doria sortied again, along with Vittorio Veneto and Giulio Cesare, in response to reports of a British fleet in the area. They were steaming off Sardinia when they received word that the Royal Navy had bombarded Genoa in Operation Grog; they immediately turned north to intercept the British, but failed to locate them in heavy fog.Rohwer, p. 58 In December 1941, Andrea Doria formed part of the escort during Operation M41, a major convoy from Italy to Benghazi in Libya on the 13th. M42 followed on 17-19 December, where Andrea Doria saw action against British cruisers and destroyers in the First Battle of Sirte. Late on the 17th, the Italian fleet, commanded by Admiral Angelo Iachino, engaged the British light forces. Both sides acted hesitantly, however, and no decisive engagement resulted.Rohwer, p. 125 During the battle, the destroyer Kipling suffered some damage from near misses, variably credited to Doria, Cesare or the heavy cruiser Gorizia.Giorgerini, p. 343 Operation M43 followed on 3 January 1942; Andrea Doria again provided escort for the three convoys to Libya. While on the operation, Andrea Doria suffered mechanical problems and had to return to port early. She remained inactive for the remainder of the year, and indeed until the Armistice in September 1943 that removed Italy from the war, owing to severe fuel shortages in the Italian Navy. On 9 September 1943, Andrea Doria left Italy, bound for internment in Malta, where she remained until 8 June 1944. She was then released to return to Sicily, and eventually returned to Taranto on 14 March 1945. Post War Service After the war ended in May 1945, Andrea Doria went to Syracuse, where she remained until 13 December 1949. She was then made flagship of the Italian fleet, a role she performed until 9 December 1950. She held the position again from 9 March 1951 to May 1953, after which time she was used as a gunnery training ship. She was paid off on 16 September 1956, after serving in the Italian Navy for over 40 years. She was formally stricken from the naval register on 1 November and subsequently broken up for scrap in La Spezia.

She has been a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly since 2003, representing the seat of Willoughby. Before becoming Premier, Berejiklian was the Treasurer of New South Wales and Minister for Industrial Relations in the second Baird government, and Minister for Transport in the O'Farrell and first Baird governments. She was also the Deputy Leader of the New South Wales Liberal Party between 2014 and 2017. On 23 March 2019, she was re-elected as Premier of New South Wales when the Liberal-National Coalition won the 2019 state election.

Retrieved 20 January 2017. She has remained involved in the Armenian-Australian community, serving a term on the Armenian National Committee of Australia. In 2015, she attended a commemoration ceremony in Yerevan for the 100th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide. Berejiklian attended North Ryde High School, which became Peter Board High School from 1986, a public, co-educational school in North Ryde. She was a member of Girl Guides and continues to support the organisation. She has a Bachelor of Arts (1992) and a graduate diploma in international studies (1996) from the University of Sydney and a Masters in Commerce from the University of New South Wales (2001). She joined the Liberal Party in 1993 and was president of the New South Wales Young Liberals from 1997 to 1998, being the third female president in its history. She also served as a Delegate to State Council (1996‚Äì2003), Urban Representative of the NSW Liberal Party State Executive (1997‚Äì2003), Campaign Director for State seat of Willoughby (1999) and Chair of Convention Committee (2002). Berejiklian also worked for Peter Collins and Senator Helen Coonan and the Commonwealth Bank as general manager, Youth Retail Banking and Government & Industry Affairs. Political career Opposition (2003‚Äì2011) Berejiklian (right) with Andrew Stoner, Victor Dominello and Liberal Leader Barry O'Farrell in 2008 Berejiklian won Liberal preselection for Willoughby in 2003 when former Opposition Leader Peter Collins, who had represented the Willoughby area since 1981, decided to retire. Willoughby has historically been a comfortably safe Liberal seat even by northern Sydney standards; counting its time as Middle Harbour, it has been held by the Liberals, their predecessors or a conservative independent for all but one term since 1927. However, she faced a spirited challenge from Pat Reilly, the longtime mayor of the City of Willoughby, who nearly took the seat on Labor preferences. Ultimately, Berejiklian won by 144 votes, with the Liberals suffering a swing of 10.9 points. However, Berejiklian easily saw off a rematch with Reilly after picking up a healthy swing of 14.5 points, enough to revert Willoughby to its traditional status as a comfortably safe Liberal seat. She has not faced a serious challenge since, with Labor often being pushed into third place. Berejiklian joined the front bench in 2005 as Shadow Minister for Mental Health and was appointed to the opposition front bench portfolio of Transport by Peter Debnam in 2006. Following the 2007 State election, she was given the shadow portfolio of Citizenship by Opposition Leader O'Farrell in his Shadow Ministry. O'Farrell Government (2011‚Äì2014) Following the election of the O'Farrell government at the 2011 state election, Berejiklian was appointed Transport Minister on 3 April 2011. The major achievements in her term as Minister for Transport include the extension of the Sydney Light Rail Dulwich Hill Line from to ; the phased introduction of the Opal card; and commencement of construction of the North West Rail Link. She was also Transport Minister at the time the NSW government stopped trains running to Newcastle Station, which now terminate at Wickham. The former rail corridor has now been re-zoned by Newcastle City Council and a proportion of that land is expected to be sold. Baird Government (2014‚Äì2017) On 17 April 2014, Mike Baird was elected Leader of the New South Wales Liberal Party, and hence Premier, following the resignation of Barry O'Farrell. Berejiklian was elected as Baird's deputy. In a subsequent ministerial reshuffle, in addition to her existing responsibilities, on 23 April 2014 Berejiklian was sworn in as the Minister for the Hunter. Berejiklian was appointed as Treasurer of New South Wales and Minister for Industrial Relations following a cabinet reshuffle announced on 1 April 2015 by Premier Baird, after the 2015 state election. As Treasurer, Berejiklian oversaw New South Wales's return to surplus. This was the first time New South Wales had been declared debt-free in more than 20 years. She also oversaw the part-privatisation of the state's electricity network. Premier of New South Wales (2017‚Äìpresent) First term Following the resignation of Mike Baird as NSW Liberal leader and Premier on 19 January 2017, Berejiklian announced her intention to succeed him as the leader of the Liberal Party, and hence to become the 45th Premier of New South Wales. Baird endorsed Berejiklian as his successor, declaring that she would be \\"an outstanding Premier... No doubt about it.\\"Nicholls, Sean.

In October 2018, Berejiklian permitted advertising for The Everest stakes to be projected onto the sails of the Sydney Opera House (a move spearheaded by radio broadcaster Alan Jones), drawing widespread condemnation and criticism from many in the community, with a poll declaring that 80% of respondents opposed this decision.Pitt, H & Noyes J. (10 October 2018) \\"Opera House illumination time changed to avoid protesters\\". The Sydney Morning Herald. Retrieved 10 October 2018 Second term Berejiklian led the Coalition into the 2019 state election, becoming the third woman to take a major party into an election in NSW. With polls showing the race at a knife-edge, the Coalition suffered a swing of six seats, cutting its numbers down to 48 seats, a majority of two. This made Berejiklian the third woman to lead a party to a victory at a state election in Australia, after Anna Bligh and Annastacia Palaszczuk from Queensland, and the first non- Labor woman to lead a party to a state election victory in Australia. In August‚ÄìSeptember 2019 Berejiklian expressed support for the Reproductive Health Care Reform Bill, a private member's bill aimed to decriminalise abortion in New South Wales. Berejiklian allowed a conscience vote on the bill in her party. Many conservative parliamentarians of the Liberal Party opposed the bill. Three of these parliamentarians, MP Tanya Davies and Legislative Council members Matthew Mason-Cox and Lou Amato, \\"expressed dissatisfaction with Berejiklian's handling of the bill\\". They had repeatedly asked Berejiklian to \\"intervene to stop the \\"fast-tracking\\" of the bill and establish a joint select committee into the legislation reform\\". However, their requests were rejected by Berejiklian. On 16 September 2019, the trio announced they would hold a party leadership spill motion against Berejiklian the following day. Senior ministers, including conservative ministers who opposed the bill, backed Berejiklian and condemned the actions of the trio. The right-wing faction of the party also clarified that they did not sanction the spill. The trio called off the spill the next morning, after the trio claimed to have received \\"further concessions\\" on amendments to the bill, meaning their amendments would be considered in the debate in the Legislative Council. The bill eventually passed Parliament with amendments on 26 September 2019 and came into force as the Abortion Law Reform Act 2019 on 2 October 2019. In October 2020, as part of her evidence to an Independent Commission Against Corruption inquiry, Berejiklian admitted that she had been in a \\"close personal relationship\\" with Daryl Maguire from 2015 until August 2020. Maguire had been a fellow Liberal MP until a previous inquiry had heard that he had sought inappropriate payments, leading to his resignation in 2018. As a result, a vote of no-confidence was taken in parliament. She survived the vote in the lower house with 47-38, and in the upper house with 21-20, after a deciding vote from the Liberal president. Personal life Berejiklian supports the Australian republican movement. She regularly attends events of the Armenian Apostolic Church.https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-09-19/same-sex- marriage-nsw-premier-breaks-ranks-with-her-church/8960534 See also *First Berejiklian ministry *Second Berejiklian ministry *List of female heads of government in Australia *Shadow ministry of Barry O'Farrell References External links  Category:1970 births Category:Living people Category:Liberal Party of Australia members of the Parliament of New South Wales Category:Members of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly Category:Australian Armenians Category:Armenian Apostolic Christians Category:Australian republicans Category:People from the North Shore, Sydney Category:Politicians from Sydney Category:University of New South Wales alumni Category:Treasurers of New South Wales Category:21st-century Australian politicians Category:21st-century Australian women politicians Category:Premiers of New South Wales Category:Women heads of government of Australian states and territories Category:Women members of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly ","title":"Gladys Berejiklian"},{"id":"7219224","title":"Comedy Playhouse (series 9)"},{"id":"7219253","title":"German submarine U-31 (1936)"},{"id":"7219256","title":"German submarine U-185"},{"id":"7219257","text":"The Home key among other keys.

Crest: A rising silver swan with red beak (original crest in French: un cygne √©ploy√© d'argent et becqu√©e de gueules) Origin: The coat of arms contains colours and elements referring to that of Declercq‚Äôs ancestors de Patin (a Flemish family originating in the 14th century in Cambrai, France), with shield placed in front of the original shield (in catalan: Cortado Jaquelado de oro y azur, 2¬∫, de azur, dos palos de oro) of his Spanish paternal ancestors Desclergues (originating in the 16th century in Catalunya, Spain). Declercq is a patrilineal descendant of Don Pere Desclergue (I), who was born early in the 15th century AD at Montblanc in the Conca de Barber√† in Catalunya, Spain. Pere Desclergue's grandson Bonaventura Desclergue (II) i Cort√©s, a notary at Montblanc, had four sons, one of which would stay as heir at Montblanc, while the three others (Jeroni, Antoni (I) and Enric) would go to Flanders as military during the Eighty-year war. Don Jeroni Desclergue had been a military since 1587. He stayed in Flanders from 1587-1598 and 1601-1604. In 1587, he became a commander in the infantry company of Llu√≠s de Queralt (a Catalan); while in Flanders he joined the company of Diego de Durango, in the tercio of Luis del Villar. It has been reported that he was involved in military interventions in Holland, Flanders and France, including the Siege of Cambrai of 1595. On March 10 of 1597 he captured, with his company, the city of Amiens and helped further defending it against the French. On January 14 of 1598 he was recognized for his military career by his captain Diego de Durango. Once returned to Barcelona, he went to the service of the Viceroy Duke of Feria. His stay in Barcelona allowed him to attend, with his father Bonaventura Desclergue (II) and his elder brother Francesc Desclergue, in the Cortes of Barcelona of 1599. In 1602 he returned to Flanders in August, where he commanded as Tercio captain of a company of I√±igo de Borja, with which he participated in the Siege of Ostend (August 1601 - September 27 of 1604), where he died, with half of his company, while leading an assault, as a result of the explosion of a mine, on 4 September of 1604, which also wounded his brother Enric Desclergue. Enric was awarded for his military achievements and died in 1631. Antoni appeared in contemporary literature which shows that he went back and forth to Spain, while Jeroni‚Äôs grandson, Antoni, was the continuator of the Desclergue bloodline in Flanders through his marriage, in Flanders, with Martina Veracruz in 1656. Bonaventura Desclergues (II) is the one who established the monumental 'Casal dels Desclergue‚Äô, or ‚Äôla Casa Desclergues‚Äô on the Plaza Mayor of Montblanc; Nico Declercq stems from Jeroni Desclergue twelve generations later.. DNA analysis shows that the Desclergues of Montblanc originate from Bertrand du Guesclin, who was a military commander from Brittany and who supported Henry of Trast√°mara, the first King of Castile and Le√≥n in the period 1365-1370.

The ensuing trials of Madden and Ferriman have created a media sensation in Toronto and in the Canadian English media generally, which intensified after the first trial ended in a mistrial when a key witness was discovered to have committed perjury. Madden and Ferriman were convicted, respectively, of first-degree murder and manslaughter in early 2006, but until September 29, 2006, when Justice David McCombs elected to sentence the youths as adults, the names of the principals in the case were precluded from publication by provisions of Canada's Youth Criminal Justice Act.  Death  On the afternoon of November 25, 2003, Kevin Madden (then 16) was at home, accompanied by Timothy Ferriman and another friend, who remains publicly unidentified. The three began to extensively vandalize the family home, smashing beer bottles and a television with baseball bats, while drinking wine. Less than an hour before attacking Johnathon, who was also at home, all three spoke on the telephone to Ferriman's girlfriend indicating that a mass murder would occur; she tape-recorded this conversation. Shortly thereafter, Kevin Madden attacked Johnathon with a butcher knife, cutting his face and neck 71 times, and severing his voice box and his carotid artery. Though present, Ferriman did not stab Johnathon himself but encouraged Kevin and handed him the knife, and afterwards helped to move Johnathon's body. Following Johnathon's death, the boys hid his body in a basement crawl space. Together, the three awaited Kevin's and Johnathon's stepfather, Ralston Champagnie, who was coming home from work. When Champagnie arrived, he was attacked with a baseball bat and knife, but managed to escape from the house. Johnathon's body was retrieved later that evening. All three boys were arrested within 24 hours of the incident.  First court case  The first court case relied on Ferriman's girlfriend as the Crown's key witness. It ended in a mistrial after she apparently perjured herself. She made several posts on the site vampirefreaks.com indicating an interest in vampirism, which contradicted earlier court testimony.  Second court case  During the second case, Kevin Madden stated that \\"people who did not know Johnathon should not be concerned about what happened to him\\" The verdict for the second court case was delivered on 27 February 2006. The jury determined that Kevin Madden was guilty of first-degree murder for his role in Johnathon's death, and guilty of attempted murder for his attack on his stepfather, Champagnie. Ferriman was found guilty of manslaughter for assisting in Johnathon's death. The third boy, who remains unidentified, was acquitted. In the sentencing hearing on 29 September 2006, Justice David McCombs determined that Madden and Ferriman should be sentenced as adults, which permitted their identities, and those of the rest of Madden's family, to be published for the first time. Both Madden's and Ferriman's lawyers indicated they were displeased that their clients were not sentenced as youths. Speaking of Madden, who had expressed no remorse or emotion in response to his actions throughout the trials, his lawyer said \\"Kevin desperately needs treatment, and unfortunately he's not going to get it. We could have had 10 years of in-depth treatment in the youth system and he's not going to get it.\\" Ferriman's lawyer indicated he would appeal the decision, while Madden's lawyer said he was considering it. In the sentencing hearing, Ferriman addressed the court and apologized for what he had done. His remorse enabled him to serve his sentence in a youth facility.  Aftermath  Following the release of information after the publication ban was lifted, Joanne Champagnie, mother of Johnathon and Kevin Madden, launched a website dedicated to Johnathon's memory.

Harris and fellow pitcher Bruce Hurst were shipped off to the Colorado Rockies during the Padres 1993 fire sale, and later finished his career in Minnesota. Harris' post-career San Diego superior court cases detailed scams and conspiracies that led to financial mismanagement and botched surgeries on his pitching arm and shoulder. The first case, against his surgeon, ended in 1999 with a $6 million verdict in Harris' favor.Baseball pitcher claims surgical malpractice The second case ended in 2005 with a jury verdict awarding Harris $10 million in damages.

It is situated on Marygate, by St Mary's Abbey. History St Olave's Church is situated within St Mary's Abbey walls, which was ruined in the Dissolution of the Monasteries. It is dedicated to St Olaf, patron saint of Norway. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle entry for 1055 records that ‚ÄòThis year died Earl Siward at York; and his body lies in the minster at Galmanho, which he had himself ordered to be built and consecrated, in the name of God and St. Olave, to the honour of God and to all his saints.‚ÄôThe Anglo-Saxon Chronicle Part 5 : A.D. 1052 - 1069 The Online Medieval & Classical Library Galmanho is a former name for the area where the church stands and Siward, Earl of Northumbria, is believed to have had his York residence. This is the earliest date for a church dedication to St Olaf (Olav in Norwegian) anywhere. St Olave's Church was extensively rebuilt in the 15th century. Substantial repairs were carried out in the 1720s including the insertion of windows in the north aisle, the wall of which had earlier served as part of the abbey and later city defences. The church was restored in 1848 - 1849, and reopened on Wednesday 14 February 1849. The church was again renovated starting in 1887. After a closure of 5 weeks, the church reopened on 2 September 1888. The ceiling of lath and plaster which covered the central aisle of the nave was removed. The pillars, arches and north and west walls were stripped of paint and plaster. A new chancel was added in 1887-9 by George Fowler Jones, a York architect, and later extended in 1906. This contains the five-light 15th-century east window. Despite these changes the architectural style is broadly 15th century. Current parish life St Olave's has a strong musical tradition, with a large choir and recently restored organ, as well as a ring of six bells hung for change ringing. In addition the orchestra of the Academy of St Olave's performs three concerts each year and plays for one orchestral Mass on Remembrance Sunday. The Sunday sung eucharist is at 10.30 using Common Worship (order one, contemporary language). Incumbents Initially referred to as Chaplains, the post was Curate from 1499, and Vicar from 1663.

Career Sunderland Born in Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, Proctor started his career with his hometown club Sunderland in their youth system and signed a professional contract with them on 29 October 1997. He made his first team debut for Sunderland against Everton in the League Cup on 11 November 1998, which finished as a 1‚Äì1 draw. He was loaned to Danish side Hvidovre in 2000 to recuperate from a cruciate ligament injury. He joined Halifax Town on loan in March 2001, making his debut against Cheltenham Town, in which he scored in a 4‚Äì2 win. He finished this loan spell with four goals in 12 appearances. He played at York City on loan during the 2001‚Äì02 season, making his debut in a 1‚Äì0 defeat against Rushden & Diamonds. He finished this spell with 49 appearances and 14 goals, making him York's top scorer for the season. He joined Bradford City on loan in August 2002. He scored the winning goal on his debut as Bradford defeated Ipswich Town 2‚Äì1, and became a favourite among fans, players, and the board. He scored a total of four goals in 12 games during his two-month spell, including a late equaliser as nine-man City drew 2‚Äì2 with Burnley, but he returned to Sunderland when manager Howard Wilkinson blocked another month's extension to the loan. He scored the winner for Sunderland in their 2‚Äì1 win over Liverpool on 15 December 2002. One unfortunate claim to fame occurred whilst playing for Sunderland in 2003, in a 3‚Äì1 defeat to Charlton Athletic, where Proctor scored two own goals within just five minutes. Rotherham United and Hartlepool United Proctor left Sunderland in February 2004, joining Rotherham United in a swap deal for Darren Byfield. He joined Swindon Town on a month's loan deal in February 2005. Swindon could not afford to extend his loan at the club and he returned to Rotherham in March. He later moved to Hartlepool United on a free transfer in July 2005. He was best remembered by Hartlepool fans for scoring twice in a 3‚Äì1 over local rivals Darlington in a League Cup tie early in his Pools' career. He played just 32 games in two seasons for Hartlepool, scoring ten goals, before he was one of ten players released by Danny Wilson. Wrexham Proctor joined League Two club Wrexham on a month's loan in March 2007. This loan was extended until the end of the 2006‚Äì07 season in April. During this spell he scored two vital goals for Wrexham in their eventually successful survival bid. These were the winning goal in the 1‚Äì0 victory at local rivals Shrewsbury Town and the third goal in the Welsh club's 3‚Äì1 victory over Boston United which preserved the club's Football League status. He was released by Hartlepool in May 2007 and expressed an interest in joining Wrexham permanently. This move was confirmed in May 2007. He was transfer listed by Wrexham in May 2008 following the club's relegation to the Football Conference, despite finishing the season as the club's top scorer with 12 goals. In the summer of 2009 after talks with manager Dean Saunders, Proctor left the club by mutual consent. Media Work From the start of the 2014/15 season, Michael began to work as a co-host for Sun FM's Into The Light football show, discussing all things Sunderland with the duo of Stephen Goldsmith and Gareth Barker of the Wise Men Say podcast; Proctor added expert opinion to the comments of Goldsmith and Barker.

Features While unpopular with train crews stationed there because of its relative isolation and limited shopping and education facilities, these drawbacks were offset with a daily financial allowance and an extra day's paid leave for every month served by workers. In the modern day though, Dete has become an area of interest for most folk. There are three main suburbs. The largest of these are the densely populated Mtuya and Soweto. Mtuya is made up of predominantly mud houses with thatch roofs, while Soweto is composed of brick houses with asbestos roofing. Soweto and Bote were electrified under the government's R.E.P in 2012. The smaller and less densely populated suburb is the 'Railways' suburb, built by the railways for its workers, but inhabited by a mixture of the wealthier Dete inhabitants. Residents of Dete are used to seeing wild game visit their houses and backyards. Over the years, animals have made good to stay away from residential areas lest they be prey for poachers, save for elephants that still terrorise the area. For visitors, Dete offers easy access to Hwange Main Camp, a popular entry point to the Hwange National Park. There is also access to the local Detema Safari Lodge, as well as the Hwange Safari Lodge. Detema Safari Lodge was burnt down in 2011 in a case of a wildfire and what remains is a ruin. There is New Game Reserve Hotel which is located at the Dete shopping centre and Miombo Lodge some three kilometres east of the shopping centre. There are two primary schools, Sir Roy Welensky School, Dete (located within the Railway suburb, and St Francis Xavier School, Dete (a Catholic school). There is a local day secondary school called Detema Secondary School, as well as the more established Marist Brothers Secondary School, Dete, located 5 km from Dete town. Dete is near the Kamativi tin mine and its economy depends on small grocery shops that serve the community. Train system Bulawayo-based train crews booked off on arrival at Dete, while Dete or Hwange train crews worked the train further north to Hwange. This system of trains working was phased out when diesel locomotives were introduced on the Bulawayo-Victoria Falls railway line.

This system allows a laser seeker to be located in the leading edge of each of the forward control canards, working in unison as if they were a single seeker. This configuration allows existing warheads from the Hydra 70 system to be used without the need for a laser seeker in the missile nose.

The population at the 2006 census, was 32,474 in 8,492 families. Qaen is also called the City of Saffron because it is a major saffron producer and saffron from Qaen is prized for its unique aroma and strong colour. Geography A mud wall surrounds the modern town with more affluent residential areas lying outside the wall. The surrounding area consists of hill ranges of 9,000 feet (2,750 m) running northwest‚Äìsoutheast and sinking to the Sistan depression in the south. The city is a trading center, but it also has industries that produce felt and carpets. The area is the main source of saffron in Iran. The other landmark fruit of this city is barberry. Lately most of the barberry produced in Iran was produced in the city; more than 90% of barberry production is happening here. The most famous and oldest industry in the city is Ghayen Cement Plant, producing more than 2000 tons of different types of cements daily and one of the leaders of cement exporting in the east of Iran. History The present city, which lies in a broad valley, was founded in the 15th century on the site of an ancient city. Later, the Uzbeks (a Turkic people) took possession of the city and held it until Shah Abbas I (1588-1629) expelled them. In the 18th century, Qaen fell under the control of Pashtuns which is why some of locals, though they speak Persian, still claim descent from Pashtuns rather than Persians. There are several ancient places around the town, such as the Tomb of Bozorgmehr Qaini, 5 km to the south.

Coastal dwelling Aboriginal people had collected and traded pearl shell as well as trepang and tortoise with fisherman from Sulawesi for possibly hundreds of years. After settlement, Aboriginal people were used as slave labour in the emerging commercial industry in a practice known as blackbirding. Pearling centred first around Nickol Bay and Exmouth Gulf and then around Broome to become the largest in the world by 1910. The farming of cultured pearls remains an important part of the Kimberley economy, worth million in 2014 and is the second largest fisheries industry in Western Australia after rock lobster. History Early history In Australia, the harvesting of pearl shell began millennia ago with the Aboriginal people. They did not dive but were so successful in harvesting the shell that the \\"patterns of distribution\\" or trade in the shell that they harvested have been traced throughout many parts of the continent.Akerman, K., and Stanton, J., 1994. Riji and Jakuli: Kimberley Pearl Shell in Aboriginal Australia. NT Museum of Arts and Sciences. Number 4 1994 : Frontispiece; 19 They also had enough surplus to engage in an overseas trade. This phase began with the visits of the Makassan trepangers to the northern coasts in the late seventeenth or early eighteenth century. The trade resulted in the exchange of trepang, turtles and pearl shell for tobacco, rice and axes. There was also violence, including the abduction of men and women. As a result, both groups were often armed and the Aboriginal people learnt to treat any newcomers with suspicion. From a European perspective, William Dampier and then the French explorers saw Pinctada albina at Shark Bay and Dampier, Stokes, Grey and F.T Gregory found Pinctada maxima on the north-west coast. While anchored at Nickol Bay, waiting for him to return from his explorations, Gregory's crew obtained a quantity of shell and a good pearl. While Gregory reported on this in his widely read journals and accounts, it appears that others were more secretive. Some visiting whalers, for example, also knew of the shell, having either harvested shell themselves, or having acquired it in trade with the Aboriginal people. Recorded as being on the coast in great numbers after the 1840s, they also frequented areas where shell is found, including Nickol Bay and Shark Bay. Pragmatic, and keen to guard any potential lucrative return, they kept few historical records. North-west shell was found on the wreck of the American whaling barque that was lost while sealing about north of Fremantle in 1844, for example.McCarthy, M., 2009. Naked Diving for Mother-of-pearl. In Early Days, Journal of the Royal Western Australian Historical Society, Vol 13, Part 2 : 243-262. The first stage of the European pearling industry: Wading for shell  The European pearling industry began in the 1850s at Shark Bay where pearls (called the 'Oriental, or Golden' Pearl) were found in the Pinctada albina oyster in relatively large numbers. The industry soon folded however. At Nickol Bay, decorative pearl shells (Riji) made by local Aborigines from Pinctada maxima, were noted by European explorers. The industry began in the mid-1860s with pastoral workers who collected shell in shallow waters, either from shore or in small boats. In 1866, a former shareholder of the defunct Denison Plains Company, WF Tays (who apparently had some prior knowledge of pearling) proved very successful as a full-time pearler. Others followed and in these instances, the boat provided transport for personnel and shell to and from remote beds, or across deeper water to drying banks and reefs. There was no diving at this time, as the shallow waters initially provided enormous returns to the Europeans and their Aboriginal labourers, who waded and recovered shell as the tide receded. During the late 1860s many more boats left Fremantle and the pearling industry at Torres Strait, Queensland for the new fishery at Nickol Bay with its port of Tien Tsin Harbour (later known as Cossack). Thus new technology, in the form of small boats, large containers (in the form of bags and sacks) and then larger vessels operating independently, or as 'mother boats' to a number of dinghies, were the first major advances that the Europeans applied to the pearling industry. Walter Padbury, the noted Perth-based merchant, pastoralist and ship owner, then sent a large boat north up to the early pastoralist John Withnell in partnership with others. They also proved successful, as did many others, including (to name but a few) Charles Harper, who built his own boat, the Amateur; Charles Edward Broadhurst a noted entrepreneur and at least two sons of Government Resident RJ Sholl. This eventually caused over-harvesting of the shallows and a shortage of shell. This led the industry into its second stage and a transition took place from wading in the shallows into the use of \\"skin divers\\" (unassisted by the emerging technology of breathing apparatus). In most cases, however, the transition from wading to diving took place during 1868.McCarthy, M. (1995). \\"Before Broome.\\" The Great Circle:, Journal of the Australian Association for Maritime History. 16(2):76-89. While Broadhurst and a few other proprietors experimented, during the 1860s, with the use of breathing apparatus by professional divers, it proved at the time to be expensive, unreliable and dangerous. While local Aborigines were excellent swimmers, known to have covered great distances over water, sometimes to escape imprisonment, unlike their counterparts in some other parts of Australia they had no cause to dive in conditions where the tidal range provided all they needed. Many were also succumbing to diseases to which they had not previously been exposed, as well as accidents. This led to recruitment from the convicts on the \\"Native Prison\\" on Rottnest Island. Broadhurst was criticised for harsh treatment of at least one indigenous employee, while some pearlers abducted and/or forcibly retained their divers. The second stage of the European pearling industry: 'Naked Diving'  By September 1868, soon after the beginning of the warm weather, the shell harvesters were operating in depths of around . Then, inured to hardship, supremely fit and with wonderful eyesight, the Aborigines began to emulate and sometime surpass the feats of the others already engaged in the industry elsewhere throughout the world. At the time the following was said of their skills and abilities: The powers of the natives in diving, especially the females, are spoken of as something wonderful, they go down to a depth of seven fathoms [c.13m] and remain below a time that astonishes their white employers.The Perth Gazette and Western Australian Times, 25/9/1868, page 2 Called 'naked diving', the methods used are described in two primary sources, one the diaries and official dispatches of Government Resident and pearler R.J. Sholl and the other the better-known and widely published accounts of E.W. Streeter.Streeter, E.W., (1886) Pearls and Pearling life, Bell and Sons, London He wrote that right up until the late 1880s, harvesters were operating from dinghies, the largest containing six to eight divers. They often went up against the tide and, when ready the divers went overboard. The leader, most often a white man, then stood in the stern of the dinghy, drifting along with the divers until good beds were found. There he would try to hold the boat in position against the tide or make repeated ‚Äòruns‚Äô over the bed. Everyone worked hard and traveled great distances for they could end up kilometres from the ‚Äòmother boat‚Äô and had to return to it at the end of the day. The tides were an advantage in this instance, allowing the divers to be carried relatively effortlessly across far more ground than they could ever cover on their own. The majority entered the water feet first, turning as their head submerged towards the bottom. They did not use stones to speed up their descent, nor did they use other aids. A ‚Äòfair days work‚Äô for a ‚Äònaked diver‚Äô in the north-west industry was considered to be the recovery of 10-25 pairs at a general rate of one ‚Äòpair‚Äô of shells in eight dives. Two to three pairs were frequently brought up in the one dive.Streeter, op. cit. & McCarthy, M., 2009. Naked Diving for Mother-of-pearl. In Early Days, Journal of the Royal Western Australian Historical Society, Vol 13, Part 2 : 243-262. Experiments with alternative labour sources and with Diving Apparatus (The 'Hard Hat' ) In June 1868, Charles Broadhurst, in partnership with James Dempster and the firm of Barker and Gull of Guildford introduced Diving Apparatus. The diving gear, a ‚ÄòHeincke‚Äô system, proved a dismal failure. They had not learnt how to use the gear in any but a still water environment and when they applied it to the waters of the Flying Foam Passage at Nickol Bay they almost lost the unfortunate diver in the fierce currents. They also had problems finding the shell beds because the diver was tethered to the boat which was itself anchored and as a result he could not move very far at all. They had not learnt to drift along with the diver walking across the seabed as became the norm in the Broome era that built upon these experiences (see following). In the meantime 'naked diving' continued with most producing exceptional results especially at the Flying Foam Passage where they used the tides to allow themselves to travel over great distances. As the demands on the local Aboriginal populations increased and as many died due to disease and maltreatment, a Mr Howlett was the first to experiment bringing eight ‚ÄòMalay‚Äô ( as the peoples inhabiting the islands north of Australia were then generally, but incorrectly known) divers from Batavia in early 1871. At around the same time the notorious Queensland ‚Äòblackbirder‚Äô and River Murray explorer Captain Francis Cadell left for Macassar for the same purpose. He obtained forty four ‚ÄòMalay‚Äô men and set them to work at his bases at Condon and at the newly re-opened beds at Shark Bay. Though it was generally expected that they would not equal the Aborigines they were expected to provide the answer to the growing labor shortage. In attempt to introduce both steam power and more imported labour to the industry by the end of 1872, Broadhurst imported over 140 ‚ÄòMalays‚Äô on the SS Xantho at a cost of over ¬£10 per head. In early 1873 there were 24 ‚Äòlarge boats‚Äô, 47 smaller boats, 291 Aboriginals and 134 ‚ÄòMalays‚Äô at work with 50 ‚Äòfollowers‚Äô ashore. This gave a total population of around 550 at work there. The ‚ÄòMalays‚Äô had proved ‚Äòtractable...quick to learn...pleasant,‚Äô excellent on the land, though not the equal of the Aborigines in the water. Despite that they were doing well, except for Broadhurst's men who were again a dismal failure producing results far worse than those around. The Shark Bay pearling industry  Frank Cadell was also operating at Shark Bay in this period and in this era 'dredging' rapidly became the most efficient means of obtaining the shell, which was noted more for the pearls rather than the shell as was the situation further north. When SS Xantho sank beneath him late in 1872, Broadhurst joined Cadell at Shark Bay there, proving extremely successful at one stage recovering over 200 ounces of pearls. The publicity surrounding the successes resulted in a virtual gold rush centred on Wilyah Miah (Place of the Pearl).McCarthy, M., 2007. Pearling at Shark Bay: the early beginnings. In Green, J., (ed.) Report on the 2006 Western Australian Museum, Department of Maritime Archaeology, Cape Inscription National Heritage Listing Archaeological Survey. Report‚ÄîDepartment of Maritime Archaeology Western Australian Museum, No. 223 Special Publication No. 10, Australian National Centre of Excellence for Maritime Archaeology: 157-161 The importation of 'Malay' indentured labour ceases  The use of ‚ÄòMalays‚Äô on the north-west coast grew dramatically and reached its peak around August 1875. At the beginning of the 1875/6 season, 22 large vessels arrived in the north of Western Australia, mainly from Kupang and Macassar. On board the vessels were around 75 white men, about 770 ‚ÄòMalays,‚Äô an unspecified number of Port Essington Aboriginals, 17 Chinese, 24 women and a few children. Cadell then began to cause problems for all the employers by mistreating his ‚ÄòMalay‚Äô labourers. Calls were made for his apprehension and both he and Broadhurst became embroiled in a great scandal for the abuse, non payment and non repatriation of the labourers at Shark Bay. The matter was eventually resolved by the Dutch Governor General at Batavia in August 1875 by enacting what a Western Australian administration unable to control the excesses on its own coast dubbed to be ‚Äòwise and humane‚Äô regulations. They also led to the near abandonment of the use of ‚ÄòMalays‚Äô on the North coast. In 1874 there were 225 ‚ÄòMalays‚Äô employed in the fishery, in 1875 there were 989, in the following year none, and in 1876 there were only 24 in the industry. The pearlers move further afield  As an indicator of the mobility of the fleet, Government Resident R.J. Sholl, made a visit to Flying Foam Passage in Nickol Bay in the first week of February when ‚Äòthe yield was good,‚Äô and recorded the numbers of people and boats above. By the time of the writing of his official report on the same subject at the end of March 1873, however, the supply had ‚Äòdiminished‚Äô indicating the rapidity with which beds were exploited and abandoned. Several boats moved elsewhere, some to the west of Nickol Bay or further still to Exmouth Gulf, and others east to Condon or to Peedamurra near Port Hedland. A few went much further. Eventually the centre of activity drifted away from Nickol Bay and its Cossack and from other centres such as Condon, Bannangarra (on Pardoo Station) on to Roebuck Bay, where modern day, Broome is situated.For details see McCarthy, 1995; 2009 op.cit. The Broome era As the centre of activity drifted away from Nickol Bay and its port of Cossack, and from other centres such as Condon, Bannangarra, where the drying beds were once prolific, the industry came to centre on Roebuck Bay, where modern day Broome is situated.Bain, M.A.,1982, Full Fathom Five. Artlook Books, Perth There 'diving apparatus' (standard dress or 'hard hat') was used and E.W. Streeter by his own account became acknowledged as its first successful operator. In 1884 nine vessels had the diving gear. By the end of the 1885-6 season 34 of the 54 vessels operating on the pearling grounds were using 'standard dress' and in the 1887-8 season of the 120 vessels, only two used the 'naked diving' or method. With the exception of Shark Bay, where diving had long since ceased to be a feature, and where in 1886 the Chinese also proved very efficient, the advent of apparatus diving produced a change in the recruitment of ‚ÄòMalays‚Äô. It became biased specifically towards those more capable of handling the technology, with Manilamen preferred over those less capable of handling the gear. Aboriginal divers also ‚Äòdisappeared from the industry almost overnight‚Äô. Soon the Japanese divers came to dominate the industry. By 1910, nearly 400 pearling luggers and more than 3500 people were fishing for shell in waters around Broome, making it the world's largest pearling centre. The majority of the workers were Japanese and Malaysian, but also included were Chinese, Filipino, Amborese, Koepanger (Timorese) and Makassan, as well as Indigenous Australians and people from Europe. Pearl luggers at Roebuck Bay, Broome ca. 1914, by Yasukichi Murakami By the 1930s, pearl luggers were mainly motorised and the use of mechanical air pumps allowed boats to use two divers. The industry suffered from a high death toll, with hazards from shark attack, cyclones and frequently, the bends. Four tropical cyclones hit the area between 1908 and 1935 and over 100 boats and 300 people were lost during that time, as evidenced by the numerous graves in the Japanese cemetery in Broome. At the time of the World War I the price of mother-of-pearl plummeted with the invention and expanded use of plastics for buttons and other articles which had previously been made of shell. Broome had been the centre of an industry that supplied up to 70% of global demand for the shell. Concerns regarding over-harvesting by the industry led to the voluntary Northern Territory Pearling Ordinance in 1931. Pearlers such as Jiro Muramats continued to operate out of Cossack. By 1939 only 73 luggers and 565 people were left in the industry and during the World War II, pearling virtually stopped. Japanese divers discreetly went home or were interned and Broome was bombed, destroying many of the remaining luggers. After the war, as few as 15 boats employing around 200 people remained. Post WW2: indentured labour After World War II, workers were brought from Malaya and Indonesia on bonds to work in the pearl shelling industry and returned to their country of origin when no longer needed.Sumatran-born Samsudin bin Katib was a pearl diver who was recruited and deployed in the Z Special Unit Commandos in the Australian Army and worked behind enemy lines. Returning to work in Broome, Samsudin protested at a 10% cut in wages and poor conditions for the migrant labourers, organising a general strike. He also applied to be allowed permanent residence, but this was against the provisions of the White Australia policy. Despite the backing of some unions and individuals, he was deported in 1948. Legacy of the 19th century In April 2019, the skeletons of 14 Yawuru and Karajarri people which had been sold in 1894 by a wealthy Broome pastoralist and pearler to a museum in Dresden, Germany, were brought home. The remains, which had been stored in the Grassi Museum of Ethnology in Leipzig, showed signs of head wounds and malnutrition, a reflection of the poor conditions endured by Aboriginal people forced to work on the pearl luggers. Pearling luggers The boats used for pearling from the 1870s, known as pearling luggers, were unique to Australia. There were at least two types: the Broome or North-West lugger, and the Thursday Island or Torres Strait lugger. The styles are each adapted to their respective areas and modus operandi. Around Broome, the boats had to cope with the extreme tidal range and the shallow sandy shore, on which they had to spend extended periods lying on their sides. The Torres Strait luggers spent longer periods at sea, based around schooners as mother ships. The design of these two types changed after the engines were developed for the boats, and over time they began to look more alike. The last of the pearling luggers were built in the 1950s, and were over long. They were some of the last wooden sailing vessels in commercial use in Australia. Michael Gregg, curator of maritime history at the Western Australian Museum says there were four different types, and also pointed out that the Broome pearling lugger was not actually a lugger. The name derived from the first boats used for pearling in Australia, which were often ship's boats, and used a lugsail, and so they were called luggers. But as boats began to be designed specifically for pearling, they kept the name luggers though they stopped using lugsails, and were actually gaff-rigged ketches. At the peak of the pearling industry, in the early 1900s, there were 350 to 400 pearling luggers operating out of Broome each year. By 2005, there were just two still afloat in Broome. In 2007, one of them, Ida Lloyd, sank off Cable Beach, and in 2015, Intombi, built in 1903, was burnt. However as of 2019, there were still about 40 luggers of various types still afloat around Australia, and there is a collection of luggers at the Australian National Maritime Museum. Cultured pearls Due to the prospect of an adverse reaction in the natural pearling industry, the Australian government through the Pearling Act 1922 prohibited anyone in Australia from artificially producing cultivated pearls. The Act was repealed in 1949. In 1956, a joint Japanese-Australian venture was set up at Kuri Bay, north of Broome as a cultured pearl farm, named Pearls Proprietary Ltd. The company was owned by Male and Co, Broome Pearlers Brown and Dureau Ltd, and the Otto Gerdau Company (New York). The Japanese-owned Nippo Pearl Company handled distribution and marketing. The principal was Tokuichi Kuribayashi (1896‚Äì1982) who became highly influential following the death of K≈çkichi Mikimoto (1858‚Äì1954). Mikimoto, Kuribayashi and another man, Tatsuhei Mise (1880‚Äì1924) had all been involved in the invention of cultured pearls around 1900. Kuri Bay was named after Mr Kuribayashi. By 1981, there were five pearl farms operational: Kuri Bay, Port Smith, Cygnet Bay, and two in Broome's Roebuck Bay. The industry today includes 19 of Australia's 20 cultured pearl farms and generates annual exports of million and employs approximately 1000 people.

This common shark inhabits the Australian continental shelf from Western Australia to the Bass Strait, to a depth of . It is demersal in habits and prefers rocky and vegetated habitats. Stout-bodied and almost \\"humpbacked\\" in form, the whiskery shark can be distinguished from all other members of its family by the presence of long nasal barbels. Its two moderately large dorsal fins are roughly equal in size. It is brownish gray above and lighter below, with a pattern of darker saddles and blotches in younger sharks. This species reaches in length. The diet of the whiskery shark consists almost entirely of octopuses. It is viviparous; females bear litters of four to 28 pups every other year from August to October, after a gestation period of 7‚Äì9 months. This harmless shark is used for its meat, being one of the species marketed as \\"flake\\" in Australia. It is mainly caught by a Western Australian commercial gillnet fishery. Its numbers declined significantly from overfishing in the 1970s and early 1980s, leading to the introduction of new management measures in the mid-1980s. Since then, strict fishery management has kept the whiskery shark population stable or increasing, resulting in its listing as of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Taxonomy and phylogeny Australian ichthyologist Gilbert Percy Whitley described the whiskery shark as a new genus and species, Fur macki, in a 1943 issue of the scientific journal Australian Zoologist. As the name Fur was already in use for the genus Fur of true flies, in 1951, Whitley replaced it with Furgaleus. The type specimen is a long immature male caught off Mordialloc in Victoria, Australia. Other common names for the whiskery shark include Mack's whiskery shark, reef shark, shakey shark, and sundowner. Sharks from the western portion of this species' range were once thought to be a separate species, F. ventralis, until comparative studies by Leonard Compagno found that they were not significantly different from F. macki. Based on morphology, Leonard Compagno grouped Furgaleus with Hemitriakis, Iago, and Gogolia as the tribe Iagini within the subfamily Galeorhininae of the family Triakidae. A 2006 phylogenetic study by J. Andr√©s L√≥pez and colleagues, based on four protein-coding gene sequences, affirmed that Furgaleus and Hemitriakis are sister taxa; the study was equivocal regarding the position of Iago and did not include Gogolia. Description Distinctive traits of the whiskery shark include its nasal barbels and \\"humpbacked\\" profile. The whiskery shark has a moderately stout build, with an almost \\"humpbacked\\" appearance. The short snout is rounded or wedge-shaped when viewed from above. This species is the only houndshark in which the flaps of skin preceding the nostrils are elongated into thin barbels. The horizontally oval eyes are placed high on the head and are equipped with rudimentary nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids). Beneath the eye is a prominent ridge, and behind it is a tiny spiracle. The mouth forms a short, wide arch, and bears somewhat long furrows at the corners. Tooth rows number 24‚Äì32 in the upper and 36‚Äì42 in the lower jaw. Each upper tooth has an angled, knife-like main cusp with smaller cusplets on the trailing side, while each lower tooth has a single upright cusp. Five pairs of gill slits are seen. The first dorsal fin is rather large and positioned closer to the pectoral than the pelvic fins, though its origin lies posterior to the pectoral fin rear tips. The second dorsal fin roughly equals the first in size and is positioned slightly ahead of the anal fin, which is much smaller than either dorsal fin. The caudal fin has a short lower lobe and a deep ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe. Adults are brownish gray above and lighter below; young sharks are lighter in color and have darker saddles and blotches over the body and fins, which fade and may disappear with age. This species grows up to long and in weight. Distribution and habitat Endemic to Australia, the whiskery shark inhabits temperate continental shelf waters from the North West Cape in Western Australia to Wynyard in Tasmania. It is most common in the southwestern portion of its range between Kalbarri and Albany, and is rare off Victoria and Tasmania. Its range seems to encompass a single population. This species is found close to the bottom at depths to . It favors rocky areas and kelp beds. Biology and ecology Octopuses are the predominant food source of the whiskery shark. The whiskery shark is an active and highly specialized predator, feeding almost exclusively on octopuses. Other cephalopods, bony fishes, small rock lobsters, spoon worms, and seagrass have also been found amongst its stomach contents. A known parasite of this species is the tapeworm Calliobothrium pritchardae. Like other houndsharks, the whiskery shark is viviparous; the developing embryos are sustained by yolk and probably also maternally produced histotroph. Males can mate every year, while females have a biennial reproductive cycle. Mating takes place in August and September; females store sperm until late January to early April of the following year, when the ova are ready to be ovulated into the uterus. After a 7‚Äì to 9-month-long gestation period, litters of four to 28 (average 19) pups are born between August and October. The litter size increases with the size of the female. The newborns measure long. Juvenile whiskery sharks are rarely caught by commercial fishers, suggesting that nursery areas may be found in deeper water or other unfished habitats. Pups double to triple in size in the first 15‚Äì17 months of life, and continue to grow rapidly until they are 3‚Äì4 years old. Sexual maturity is attained at a length of for both sexes, corresponding to around five years of age for males and seven years of age for females. Mature sharks exhibit negligible growth rates, perhaps due to resources being diverted towards reproduction. The maximum lifespan is estimated to be 15 years. Human interactions Harmless to humans, the whiskery shark is fished commercially for its meat, which is sold fresh. It is one of the shark species marketed as \\"flake\\". Along with the dusky shark (Carcharhinus obscurus) and the gummy shark (Mustelus antarcticus), it is targeted by a shark fishery operating off Western Australia, currently managed as the Western Australian Joint Authority Southern Demersal Gillnet and Demersal Longline Fishery. The fishery began in the 1940s with a small number of demersal longline vessels, though the whiskery shark was not caught in substantial numbers until the 1970s, with the introduction of monofilament gillnets, hydraulic net haulers, and additional vessels. Catches peaked in the early 1980s, when 400‚Äì600 tons were taken annually. Overfishing reduced the population to <30% of pre-exploitation levels by the mid-1980s, prompting the Western Australian government to enact a management plan that stabilized the population at 25‚Äì30% of pre-exploitation levels. In 1995, the management advisory committee for the Western Australian shark fishery recommended that the whiskery shark stock be rebuilt to 40% of pre-exploitation levels by the 2010/11 season, through a series of fishing effort reductions. Although this target was not met because the effort reductions were not completed until 2000/01, preliminary catch per unit effort data indicate that the population is increasing. In 2004/05, this species made up 12% (153 tons) of the fishery by weight. The whiskery shark is also a minor catch of the southern shark fishery, which does not threaten the species overall. Since its population is stable and regularly monitored, and the fisheries that affect it are well-managed, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed this species as least concern.

He flew the P-47 Thunderbolt in the Normandy D-Day invasion and subsequent European campaign. Aanenson enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Forces in 1942 but was not called up to active duty until February 1943. He left for Santa Ana Air Force Base for pre-flight training and then to Primary Flight School at Thunderbird Field near Phoenix, Arizona. In September 1943, he attended Basic Flight School at Gardner Field near Bakersfield, California. Aanenson then received Advanced Flight Training at Luke Field, Phoenix, Arizona where he was commissioned a second lieutenant on January 7, 1944. From January to May 1944, he trained at Harding Field in Baton Rouge, Louisiana where he met his wife Jackie. Aanenson demonstrated exceptional courage and ability as a fighter pilot, amassing tens of kills and beating all odds to survive the early months of his tour of duty.Burns, Ken: \\"The War\\". Documentary, 2007 Later in the war, Aanenson was taken out of the cockpit and embedded with advance troops, with his skills put to good use as a quick-response aircraft attack coordinator. He eventually documented his experiences for his family. This was later turned into a documentary video, A Fighter Pilot's Story, which Aanenson wrote, produced and narrated. The film was first televised in late 1993, then broadcast on over 300 public television stations in June 1994. Until August 2007, it was available for purchase on DVD. The three-hour documentary, tells of an enthusiastic and cheery boy very rapidly aged by too much death. It also tells of a remarkably wide range of combat duties and details many harrowing individual missions. In one such mission, Aanenson and his wingman came upon and destroyed a German convoy, but the wingman's gun had jammed. Aanenson fired upon roadside ditches where German soldiers had hidden, making multiple passes and \\"walking\\" his rudder to spread his fire more effectively and leave as few survivors as possible.Aanenson, Quentin C.: \\"A Fighter Pilot's Story\\". Documentary, 1993 The documentary also tells of a remarkable coincidence, in which Aanenson's P-47 was called down to assist some American troops under attack by a tank. He surveyed the scene, then reported to the troops that the tank was too close to them for him to fire upon it without risking injury to the Americans. However, since the soldiers were sure to be killed if the tank wasn't stopped, Aanenson decided to attack, and he managed to destroy the tank cleanly. About two years after the war, Aanenson met a new neighbor who started to recount the story. About halfway through, Aanenson finished the memorable event for him, and for a time they both shared in the emotion of the event. Aanenson was a Commander of the French Legion of Honor, representing all Americans who served in France. He was also featured in the documentary The War by Ken Burns, recounting his experiences during World War II as a fighter pilot. At the conclusion of Episode Five of the series, Aanenson narrated a poignant and ominous letter he had written to his future wife but had never sent, considered by some critics to be of similar style to the Sullivan Ballou letter in Burns' The Civil War. Written December 5, 1944, the letter reads: According to the PBS website, Quentin and Jackie married after the war and had three children and eight grandchildren, with Aanenson working in the insurance field after graduating from Louisiana State University. Aanenson died from the effects of cancer at his home in Bethesda, Maryland on December 28, 2008. Tributes The painting Thunderbolt Patriot by William R.

Biography  Yester was born in Birmingham, Alabama, and grew up in Burbank, California. He formed a duo with brother Jim Yester, the Yester Brothers, and starting playing folk clubs in Los Angeles in 1960. When Jim enlisted in the army, Jerry joined first The New Christy Minstrels, and then, in 1963, the Modern Folk Quartet. The MFQ released two albums in the next two years, and Yester also branched out into other recordings, playing piano on The Lovin' Spoonful's \\"Do You Believe in Magic\\" in 1965. The MFQ split up in 1966, and Yester began work as a solo artist and as a producer, with his wife Judy Henske, his brother Jim's band the Association, The Turtles, and Tim Buckley, for whom he produced Goodbye and Hello and Happy Sad. The following year he joined The Lovin‚Äô Spoonful, replacing Zal Yanovsky, whom he also later worked with as producer, but in 1968 the Spoonful split up for 23 years. In 1969, Henske, Yester and Yanovsky put together the cult album Farewell Aldebaran, on which Yester played nearly a dozen different instruments. The following year Yester and Henske formed a new band, Rosebud, but the band dissolved in 1971; the couple then divorced. Yester continued to work as a producer and/or arranger on albums by The Turtles, Pat Boone, Aztec Two Step, and Tom Waits, and in the 1970s also performed with the Association and the re-formed Modern Folk Quartet. In the mid 1980s he moved to Hawaii and formed a dance band called Rainbow Connection with his brother Jim, and Rainbow Rastasan (Rainbow Page). In 1988 the MFQ began periodic touring of Japan, and have since recorded seven CDs for Japanese labels, including one (Wolfgang) using the music of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. In 1991 both Yester brothers joined a re-formed Lovin‚Äô Spoonful and Yester subsequently resided in the area of Harrison, Arkansas, where he produced and arranged in his own studio, Willow Sound. On October 7, 2017, Yester was arrested for 30 counts of possession of child pornography in Arkansas and was released on a $35,000 bond. As a result of his arrest he was dismissed from The Lovin' Spoonful. He pleaded guilty to eight counts of distributing, possessing or viewing matter depicting sexually explicit conduct involving a child on October 9, 2018. In July 2019, Yester was handed a two- year prison sentence after his conviction for child pornography possession and he will have to register as a sex offender.https://5newsonline.com/2019/07/16/former-lovin-spoonful-sentenced- for-child-porn-charges/  References  External links * Interview with Yester, focusing on his work with Tim Buckley * Jerry Yester at LovinSpoonful.com Category:American music arrangers Category:American folk musicians Category:American multi-instrumentalists Category:American people convicted of child pornography offenses Category:Record producers from California Category:American rock musicians Category:Musicians from Birmingham, Alabama Category:Musicians from Burbank, California Category:Living people Category:The Lovin' Spoonful members Category:1943 births Category:Lead guitarists Category:American rock guitarists Category:American folk guitarists Category:American folk singers Category:Songwriters from California Category:American singer-songwriters Category:American male singers Category:20th-century American guitarists Category:American male guitarists Category:American sex offenders Category:American male criminals Category:The New Christy Minstrels members Category:Modern Folk Quartet members Category:Rosebud (band) members ","title":"Jerry Yester"},{"id":"7219514","text":"Jack Oosterlaak (Justus Kinloch Ayres Oosterlaak; 15 January 1896, in Wellington ‚Äì 5 June 1968), was a South African athlete who competed mainly in the 400 metres.

The temperature required to restore free rotation on the NMR timescale is a measure of the strength of the aurophilic interaction. In chemistry, aurophilicity refers to the tendency of gold complexes to aggregate via formation of weak metallophilic interactions. The main evidence for aurophilicity is from the crystallographic analysis of Au(I) complexes. The aurophilic bond has a length of about 3.0 √Ö and a strength of about 7‚Äì12 kcal/mol, which is comparable to the strength of a hydrogen bond. The effect is greatest for gold as compared to copper or silver‚Äîthe higher elements in its periodic table group‚Äîdue to increased relativistic effects. Observations and theory show that, on average, 28% of the binding energy in the aurophilic interaction can be attributed to relativistic expansion of the gold d orbitals. An example of aurophilicity is the propensity of gold centres to aggregate. While both intramolecular and intermolecular aurophilic interactions have been observed, only intramolecular aggregation has been observed at such nucleation sites. Role in self-assembly Gold(I) complexes can polymerize by intermolecular aurophilic interaction. Nanoparticles that form from this polymerization often give rise to intense luminescence in the visible region of the spectrum. Strength of particular intermolecular aurophilic interactions can be gauged by solvating the nanoparticles and observing the extent to which luminescence diminishes. The similarity in strength between hydrogen bonding and aurophilic interaction has proven to be a convenient tool in the field of polymer chemistry. Much research has been conducted on self-assembling supramolecular structures, both those that aggregate by aurophilicity alone and those that contain both aurophilic and hydrogen-bonding interactions. An important and exploitable property of aurophilic interactions relevant to their supramolecular chemistry is that while both inter- and intramolecular interactions are possible, intermolecular aurophilic linkages are comparatively weak and easily broken by solvation; most complexes that exhibit intramolecular aurophilic interactions retain such moieties in solution.

History Roman Catholic Church of The Assumption The town was first mentioned in year 1255 on the list of king B√©la IV of Hungary. In 1494, a Roman Catholic church was built in the Gothic architecture style. Since the 15th century, there was gradual development of trade, including markets with shoemakers, saddlers, potters and furriers. The first post-office was opened in 1783, telegraph office in 1868, telephone office in 1890, train station in 1904, and museum in 1954, which was moved to Trebi≈°ov in 1981. Geography The town lies at an altitude of , which rises to on Alb√≠novsk√° hora. It covers an area of and has a population of about 8,000. Demographics According to the 2001 census, it had 7,819 inhabitants - 95.89% of whom were Slovak, 2.17% Roma, 0.47% Czech, and 0.22% Hungarian. The religious makeup was 47.05% Roman Catholic, 25.71% Greek Catholic, 18.11% with no religious affiliation, and 1.83% Lutheran. Prior to 1945, the town had a large Jewish population, most of which was deported by the Nazis. Also, prior to 1945, the town consisted primarily of ethnic Hungarians, with a small Slovak minority, but the Hungarians were forceably deported right after the war in order to ethnically cleanse the area and to make room for Slovaks from the north. Those who remained have assimilated and now consider themselves for the most part to be Slovak. Economy and facilities Health Center with emergency medical services The town has a pharmacy, and outpatient health facilities of a general practitioner and pediatrician. There is a public library, a cultural house and a movie theater. It also has a post office, a petrol station, a repair garage, and a number of general and food stores. It also has a Slovak commercial bank and insurance company.

Founded in 1922 and under congressional charter since 1950, Reserve Officers Association of the United States (ROA)now doing business as the Reserve Organization of America, advocates for adequate funding of equipment and training requirements, recruiting and retention incentives, and employment rights for all members of the Reserve. It also advises and educates the Congress, the president, and the American people on national security. Formation The ROA was founded on October 2, 1922, when several hundred officers, many of them combat veterans of World War I, first gathered with General of the Armies John J. \\"Black Jack\\" Pershing at the Willard Hotel in Washington, D.C., to formally establish a new organization. Between the World Wars, the right of the Reservist to appear before Congress in support of appropriations and matters affecting the national defense was established. Also during this time, Reserve programs, which were to prove invaluable in the mobilization period of 1941 and 1942, became established on the foundations laid by the citizen-soldiers who had served in World War I. During World War II, the Association became inactive \\"for the duration\\" as its members went off to war. ROA was reactivated in 1946, and in 1948, Reserve Officers of the Naval Services (RONS) merged with ROA. The Marine Corps and Coast Guard entered at about the same time. When law created a separate Department of the Air Force, for the first time the nation had, in ROA, a Reserve association embracing all the Services. Public Law 595 of the 81st Congress, second session, was \\"An Act to Incorporate the Reserve Officers Association of the United States.\\" This act established the objective of ROA: \\"...support and promote the development and execution of a military policy for the United States that will provide adequate National Security.\\" President Harry S. Truman, one of the early members of ROA, signed the charter on June 30, 1950.A Little History Basic facts *ROA membership is open to all federally commissioned officers, warrant officers, non-commissioned officers, enlisted and their spouses, from the Air Force, Army, Coast Guard, Navy, and Marine Corps, plus the U.S. Public Health Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. *ROA holds a congressional charter, and is established in public law as a corporation to support and promote military policies that will provide adequate national security. *ROA members are major participants in the Interallied Confederation of Reserve Officers (CIOR), Interallied Confederation of Reserve Medical Officers (CIOMR), and Pan American Union of Reserve Officers of the Armed Forces (UPORFA), international organizations that hold annual events in Europe and South America. All national Reserve officer organizations of NATO have joined CIOR since its founding in 1948.ROA Factsheet 2010 Advocacy and legislative priorities ROA Headquarters, Minuteman Memorial Building, Washington, DC ROA's legislative priorities, largely shaped by the requirements of the War on Terrorism, are: *Reset the whole force to include fully funding equipment and training for the National Guard and Reserves. *Provide adequate resources and authorities to support the current recruiting and retention requirements of the Reserves and National Guard. *Support warriors, families, and survivors. *Assure that the Reserve and National Guard continue in a key national defense role, both at home and abroad. Programs and services The Officer Journal February‚ÄìMarch 2010 edition of The Officer magazine ROA produces a bimonthly journal, The Officer, which focuses largely on national security and defense policy. Each issue has a column covering each branch of the armed forces, a Law Review detailing Reservists' civil rights, the National Security Report, a scholarly paper on some aspect of national security, and the annual year-end issue features contributions from all of the Reserve Components' top commanders. The magazine goes to ROA members, plus all flag and general officers in the Department of Defense and every member of Congress.The Officer Online Defense Education Forum ROA's Defense Education Forum (DEF) produces a series of programs featuring experts speaking to topics including homeland security, civil affairs, terrorism, continuum of service, USERRA, and civilian-military relations.

Summary Nozick disclaims the title \\"political philosopher\\" and characterizes his Anarchy, State, and Utopia (1974) as \\"an accident\\" that came about because he was \\"getting nowhere\\" working on the problem of free will. He discusses his reverence for Socrates, and his intellectual debts to Sidney Morgenbesser and Carl Hempel. At \\"the most consequential party I ever attended,\\" someone told him about a problem posed by a physicist in California, William Newcomb. Nozick brought this problem into the literature of decision theory (\\"rational choice theory\\"). He describes the influence of decision theory on Anarchy, State, and Utopia's derivation of the state from individuals' actions, and its game-theoretic analysis of utopia; and especially in The Nature of Rationality (1993), where he proposed a \\"decision value\\" alternative to maximizing expected utility and also extended decision theory to issues about rational belief. He concludes the introduction by talking about philosophy as a way of life. Although \\"being philosophical\\" in the ordinary sense wasn't his motivation for entering philosophy, he found himself being philosophical when diagnosed with stomach cancer and informed about the dire statistics, adding parenthetically an anecdote about the operation in which much of his stomach was removed, > I maintain it was not a complaint when the first words I said to the > surgeons upon coming up from anaesthesia after seven hours were, \\"I hope we > don't have to do this again. I don't have the stomach for it.\\" Nietzsche's demand, that you should lead a life you would be willing to repeat infinitely often, seems \\"a bit stringent\\", but philosophy constitutes a way of life worth continuing to its end.

Hefferon was born in Newbury, Berkshire, England, to an Irish father and an English mother but moved with his family to Canada and raised on a farmer near Brandon, Manitoba. He settled in South Africa after fighting in the Boer War, where he worked as a prison officer in Bloemfontein. He competed for South Africa in the 1908 Summer Olympics held in London, Great Britain in the marathon where he won the silver medal in the race famous for the dramatic finish of Dorando Pietri. Hefferon was leading until the last mile and a half, when he lost ground after accepting a drink of champagne and being patted on the back by a well-wisher in the crowd. He was overtaken by Pietri, who was subsequently disqualified for being helped over the line, and by the eventual winner, Johnny Hayes of the United States. In 1909, he won his fifth South African national title for the 4 mile run (as well as one for 10 miles), but turned professional and moved to England, winning 4 and 10 mile titles there in 1910. In 1912, he returned to Canada and settled near Simcoe, Ontario. During World War I, he enlisted and served with the Royal Canadian Dragoons. After the war, Hefferon became acting chief of police in Dunnville before transferring to the Ontario Provincial Police. He worked on special assignments in Hamilton and then transferred to motorcycle patrol with the Department of Highways in Brantford, Blenheim, and starting in 1930 in Brampton. Hefferon died in Brampton in 1932, when he was hit by a motorist while on duty.

It is thought to have been the site of the biblical town of Beth Dagon, mentioned in the Book of Joshua and in ancient Assyrian and Ancient Egyptian texts. In the mid-16th century, Bayt Dajan formed part of an Ottoman waqf established by Roxelana, the wife of Suleiman the Magnificent, and by the late 16th century, it was part of the nahiya of Ramla in the liwa of Gaza. Villagers paid taxes to the Ottoman authorities for property and agricultural goods and animal husbandry conducted in the villages, including the cultivation of wheat, barley, fruit, and sesame, as well as on goats, beehives and vineyards. In the 19th Century, the village women were also locally renowned for the intricate, high quality embroidery designs, a ubiquitous feature of traditional Palestinian costumes. By the time of the Mandatory Palestine, the village housed two elementary schools, a library and an agronomic school. After an assault by the Alexandroni Brigade during Operation Hametz on 25 April 1948 in the lead up to the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli war, the village was entirely depopulated. The Israeli town of Beit Dagan was founded at the same site in October 1948.Gelber, 2006, p. 394. Another Bayt Dajan, not to be confused with this one, is located southeast of Nablus. History Iron Age The village has a millennium-long history. It is mentioned in Assyrian and Ancient Egyptian texts as \\"Bƒ´t Dagana\\" and bet dgn, respectively. Its Arabic name, Bayt Dajan, preserves its ancient name. Beth Dagon appears in among the list of \\"the uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah toward the coast of Edom southward.\\" It also appears in the Tosefta (Ohalot 3:4) transcribed as \\"Beth Dagan\\". Moshe Sharon writes that this latter spelling, which corresponds exactly to the Arabic name, may have arisen after the village was conquered by Judea. With Dagon being a head deity in the Philistine pantheon of gods, Sharon speculates that under Judean control, his name was changed to Dagan, meaning \\"wheat\\", a symbol of prosperity. Byzantine era Jerome describes the village in the 4th century CE as \\"very large\\", noting its name then as \\"Kafar Dagon\\" or \\"Caphardagon\\", situating it between Diospolis (modern Lod) and Yamnia (Yavne/Yibna).Smith, 1854, p. 396. Bayt Dajan also appears on the 6th century Map of Madaba under the name [Bet]o Dagana.Sharon, 1999, p.89-p90. Early Islamic era The nearby site of Khirbet Daj≈´n, a tel with ruins to the southwest of Bayt Dajan, preserves the Dagon rather than Dagan spelling. In Arabic literature, there are many references to Daj≈´n, which was also used to refer to Bayt Dajan itself.Wheatley, 2000, p. 486. During his reign of 724‚Äì743 CE, the Umayyad caliph Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik built a palace in Bayt Dajan with white marble columns.Khalidi, 1992, pp. 236‚Äì237. Arab geographer al- Muqaddasi mentions in the 10th century, a road in the Ramla area, darb daj≈´n, as connecting to the town of Daj≈´n which had a Friday mosque, and in a separate entry he adds that most of the town's inhabitants were Samaritans. By this time, one of the eight gates to the city of Ramla was also named \\"Daj≈´n\\".Levy, 1995, p. 492.Al-Muqaddasi, 1886, p. 33 In the 11th century, Bayt Dajan served as a headquarters for the Fatimid army in Palestine.Gil and Broido, 1997, p. 727. Crusader and Ayyubid eras During the Crusader period, Richard the Lionheart built a small castle in the village in 1191. Known as Casal Maen (or Casal Moein), it \\"was the utmost limit of inland occupation allowed [to the Crusaders] by Saladin,\\" and was destroyed by Saladin following the signing of the Treaty of Jaffa on 2 September 1192.Stubbs and Hassall, 1902, p. 364Ambroise et al., 2003, p. 125. In 1226, during Ayyubid rule, Yaqut al-Hamawi writes that it was \\"one of the villages in the district of Ramla\\" and devotes the rest of his discussion of it to Ahmad al-Dajani, also known as Abu Bakr Muhammad, a renowned Muslim scholar who hailed from there. Ottoman era During early Ottoman rule in Palestine, the revenues of the village of Bayt Dajan were in 1557 designated for the new waqf of Hasseki Sultan Imaret in Jerusalem, established by Hasseki Hurrem Sultan (Roxelana), the wife of Suleiman the Magnificent.Singer, 2002, p. 50 In the 1596 tax records, Bayt Dajan was a village in the nahiya (\\"subdistrict\\") of Ramla, part of the Liwa of Gaza. It had a population of 115 Muslim households; an estimated 633 persons. The villagers paid taxes to the authorities for the crops that they cultivated, which included wheat, barley, fruit, and sesame as well as on other types of agricultural products, such as goats, beehives and vineyards; a total of 14,200 ak√ße. All of the revenue went to a waqf.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 155. Quoted in An Arabic inscription on marble dating to 1762 was found in Bayt Dajan. Held in the private collection of Moshe Dayan, Moshe Sharon identified it as a dedicatory inscription for a Sufi maqam for a popular Egyptian saint, Ibrahim al-Matbuli, who was buried in Isdud. The village appeared as a village on the map of Pierre Jacotin compiled in 1799, though it was wrongly named as Qabab.Karmon, 1960, p. 171 In 1838 Beit Dejan was among the villages Edward Robinson noted from the top of the White Mosque, Ramla.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol. 3, p. 30 It was further noted as a Muslim village, in the Lydda District.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol. 3, 2 appendix, p. 121 A headstone, made of limestone with a poetic inscription in Arabic from Bayt Dajan, dating to 1842, was also in Dayan's private collection. Socin found from an official Ottoman village list from about 1870 that Bayt Dajan had a population of 432, with a total of 184 houses, though the population count included men, only.Socin, 1879, p. 145 Hartmann found that Bet Dedschan had 148 houses.Hartmann, 1883, p. 138 In the late 19th century, Bayt Dajan was described as moderate-sized village surrounded by olive trees.Conder and Kitchener, 1882, SWP II, p. 251. Cited in Khalidi, 1992, p. 237. Philip Baldensperger noted of Bayt Dajan in 1895 that: > The inhabitants are very industrious, occupied chiefly in making mats and > baskets for carrying earth and stones. They own camels for carrying loads > from Jaffa to Jerusalem, cultivate the lands, and work at building etc., in > Jaffa or on the railway works. The women flock every day to Jaffa and on > Wednesday to Ramla‚Äîto the market held there, with chickens, eggs and > milk.Weir, p. 207, citing Philip Baldensperger (1895): \\"Beth-Dejan\\", in > Palestine Exploration Fund Quarterly, p. 114 ff. In 1903, a cache of gold coins were found in Khirbet Dajun by villagers from Bayt Dajan, who used this site as a quarry. The discovery prompted R. A. Macalister to visit the site. Based on his observations detailed in a report for the Palestine Exploration Fund (PEF), Macalister suggests a continuity in settlement over the historical phases in Bayt Dajan's development : > \\"Thus we have three epochs in the history of Beth-Dagon ‚Äî the first on an as > yet unknown site, from the Amorite to the Roman periods; the second at > Dajiin, extending over the Roman and early Arab periods; the third at the > modern Beit Dejan, lasting to the present day. It is probable that the > present population could, had they the necessary documents, show a > continuous chain of ancestry extending from the first city to the > last.\\"Macalister, 1903, p. 357 British Mandate era By the 20th century, the village had two elementary schools, one for boys, and one for girls. The school for boys was established during the British Mandate in Palestine in 1920. It housed a library of 600 books and had acquired 15 dunams of land that were used for instruction in agronomy.Khalidi, 1992, p. 237 In the 1922 census of Palestine, Bait-Dajan had a population of 1,714 residents, all MuslimsBarron, 1923, Table VII, Sub- district of Jaffa, p. 20 increasing the 1931 census to 2,664; 2,626 Muslims, 27 Christians and 11 Jews, in a total of 591 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 13. In 1934, when Fakhri al-Nashashibi established the Arab Workers Society (AWS) in Jerusalem, an AWS branch was also opened in Bayt Dajan.Matthews, 2006, p. 228. By 1940, 353 males and 102 females attended the schools. In the 1945 statistics the population was 3,840; 130 Christians and 3,710 Muslims, while the total land area was 17,327 dunams.

Cited in Morris, 2004, pp. 394, 413 Israel Following the war the area was incorporated into the State of Israel. Four villages, Beit Dagan (established six months after the conquest), Mishmar HaShiv'a (1949), Hemed (1950) and Ganot (1953) were later established on land that had belonged to the Bayt Dajan.Khalidi, 1992, p. 238 The Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi described the village in 1992: \\"A number of houses remain; some are deserted, others are occupied by Jewish families, or used as stores, office buildings, or warehouses. They exhibit a variety of architectural features. One inhabited house is made of concrete and has a rectangular plan, a flat roof, rectangular front windows, and two arched side windows. Another has been converted into the Eli Cohen synagogue; it is made of concrete and has a flat roof and a round-arched front door and window. Stars of David have been painted on its front door and what appears to be a garage door. One of the deserted houses is made of concrete and has a gabled, tiled roof that is starting to collapse; others are sealed and stand amid shrubs and weeds. Cactuses and cypress, fig, and date palm trees grow on the site. The land in the vicinity is cultivated by Israelis.\\" Demographics During early Ottoman rule in 1596, there were 633 inhabitants in Bayt Dajan. In the 1922 British Mandate census, the village had 1,714 residents, rising to 2,664 in 1931. There were 591 houses in the latter year.Khalidi, 1992, p. 236. Sami Hadawi counted a population of 3,840 Arab inhabitants in his 1945 land and population survey.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945. Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 52. From the 4th century CE to the 10th century, Samaritans populated Bayt Dajan. In 1945, Most of the inhabitants were Muslims, but a Christian community of 130 also existed in the village. Palestinian refugees amounted to 27,355 people in 1998. Culture Bayt Dajan wedding dress, ca 1920 Bayt Dajan was known to be among the wealthiest communities in the Jaffa area, and their embroideresses were reported to be among the most artistic. A center for weaving and embroidery, it exerted influences on many other surrounding villages and towns. Costumes from Beit Dajan were noted for their varied techniques, many of which were adopted and elaborated from other local styles. White linen garments inspired by Ramallah styles were popular, using patchwork and appliqued sequins in addition to embroidery. A key motif was the nafnuf design: a floral pattern thought to be inspired by the locally grown orange trees. The nafnuf design evolved after World War I into embroidery running down the dress in long panels known as \\"branches\\" (erq). This erq style was the forerunner of the \\"6 branch\\" style dresses worn by Palestinian women in different regions today. In the 1920s, a lady from Bethlehem named Maneh Hazbun came to live in Bayt Dajan after her brother bought some orange groves there. She introduced the rashek (couching with silk) style of embroidery, a local imitation of the Bethlehem style.Weir, 1989, pp. 225, 227. The jillayeh (the embroidered outer garment for wedding costume) used in Bayt Dajan was quite similar to those of Ramallah. The difference was in decoration and embroidery. Typical for Bayt Dajan would be a motif consisting of two triangles, mirror-faced, with or without an embroidered stripe between them, and with inverted cypresses at the edges. A jillayeh from Bayt Dajan (c. 1920s) is exhibited at the British Museum. The caption notes that the dress would be worn by the bride at the final ritual of wedding week celebrations, a procession known as 'going to the well'.

He was from Marobi Shabikhel, a village in the present- day Makin Subdivision of South Waziristan, Pakistan. He led a long-standing guerrilla insurgency against the British forces in the late 19th century. Mulla Powinda used the Tochi Valley of North Waziristan as his centre of operations and incited people from the area to revolt in Jihad against the British. He became known first as the Selani Mulla and later as Mulla Powinda rather than by his rarely used real name of Mohiuddin. He was not a scholar in real terms but was familiar with the main tenets of Islam, and due to his closeness with the clergy came to be known as a Mullah. He was a revolutionary National leader and even the staunchest and most unwilling Wazir and Mahsud tribesmen supported him and united on his call. Mulla Powinda did Bai'ath from Mulla Muhammad Anwar of Tirah under the Qadiriyyah Tarikah. His teacher was Maulana Hamzullah Wazir who also was a prominent mujahed of his time. Along with religious teachings, Mulla Powinda also received military training from Maulana Hamzullah Wazir. Clash with the British The British did not like his increasing popularity. They were already aware of the resistance from the Wazirs. In 1894 2000 Wazir and Mahsud youth had rioted against the British Cantonment, and the British losses at the hand of these Mujahideen in Wana were still fresh in their minds. After this incident, a Mr. Baros was named the Political Agent to the agency. He had already played a major role in the success of the Sandeman policy in Balochistan. However, Baros knew it would be difficult to handle the tribes. Unlike Balochistan; where sardars wield the power, Wazir tribes had power in the Jirga; where every single youth was an important member. As soon as Baros was appointed, a group of five Wazirs assassinated the British officer in charge of the constructions and communications department. Baros pressured the Maliks to bring forward the accused in a Jirga and punish them. The Mahsud tribe yielded under pressure and brought forward the five accused. They were each given seven years imprisonment. When Mulla Powindah learned of this, he understood it as an act of subjugation to the British. He announced that no one was to carry out this punishment. At this, the public surrounded the abodes of each of the Maliks who had announced the punishment. Three of them were executed for treason and the other two vanished fearing their lives. Along with this, Mulla Powinda also sent a letter to the political agent Mr. Baros through his trusted nephew Mulla Abdul Hakeem. In the letter he told the Political Agent to release the five tribesmen. At the time of receiving the letter. Mr. Baros was again planning to recapture areas outside Wana. In the same letter Mulla Powinda also told him to stay clear of Wana. As expected, Baros did not pay much attention to these warnings and sent an abuse riddled reply to Mulla Powinda. After the failure of these peace talks, Mulla Powinda decided to teach the British Political Agent a lesson. Early morning on 2 November 1894, the British officers were still asleep in the Wana cantonment. Suddenly, a Lashkar of Mujahideen made a surprise attack. Such was the ferocity and quickness of the strike that the British forces couldn't make proper decisions on how to react. According to the Pioneer (published from Allahabad, India), the number of Mujahideen was around 1000. It described in detail the event, how the drumming, shouting and firing Mujahideen caught the British by surprise. The article reported the deaths of at least 100 British officers and common soldiers, with at least twice that number injured. As soon as they attacked, the Mujahideen retreated back to their mountain strongholds with the same swiftness. General Turner and Major O'Neil sent soldiers in pursuit of the retreating party but they came back empty handed. Almost immediately, another army was assembled, its command given to Sir William Lockhart, and then sent to Waziristan. By November, cantonments in Waziristan were filled with troops under the British. General Lockhart gave the Mullas and other leaders a time frame of one month in which to submit an apology. But throughout the time nobody said anything or did anything. On 14 December, the army spread out hoping to encounter the rebels and teach them a lesson. They proceeded from Wana to Kaniguram, Jandola to Makeen and from Bannu to Razmak. Winter had started and snow began to fall. Ice cold winds started to blow. The soldiers who had come from hot areas of India to these highlands were not used to the cold. The Wazirs and Mahsuds played a patient waiting game. They did not confront the incoming armies, but followed the time-honored strategy of almost all Pashtun tribes which allows their enemies in and then unleash a fierce counterattack. However, in this case the British faced no resistance. On 9 January the British forces retreated back to the same positions from which they had started. On 21 January 1895 the British approached the tribesmen for peace talks and proposed the following demands: * The Tribesmen return all the loot and war booty * Mulla Powinda not be allowed to enter any area of Waziristan * 50 Rifles, 200 Guns, 2 Swords and 1200 Rupees be given to the British as a fine for the crimes they have committed During negotiations, the tribesmen agreed to the demands but none of them were ever fulfilled. During the late 1890s Powindah may have carried out small raids on the British; these may have stopped after he met with the local Political Agent in 1900. He publicly refused the usual allowance given a tribal leader by the imperial government, insisting that his tribe's concerns be addressed. However he may have received larger sums without publicity. He remained a concern of the Raj until his death.

The Center Civic Alliance was chiefly organized by the Centre Agreement, drawing in remnants of the Solidarity Citizens' Committees, independents, and Christian right parties, including the Polish People's Christian Forum \\"Homeland\\". The alliance was created after its main component, the Centre Agreement, attempted to form a broad alliance supporting President Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa. However, the alliance quickly fell out favor of the president, failing to gain Wa≈Çƒôsa's approval. In its aftermath, Centre Agreement leader Jaros≈Çaw Kaczy≈Ñski was subsequently fired from his position as Chief of the Presidential Chancellery. For the 1991 elections, the Center Civic Alliance supported a pro-Western foreign policy, advocating membership into NATO, faster privatization, decommunization, and greater economic reforms. In the election's highly fractious aftermath, the Center Civic Alliance garnered 8.7% of the vote, taking 44 seats in the Sejm. In the Senat, the Alliance took 9 seats. For the coalition building talks that followed, the Alliance selected Jan Olszewski to lead the organization into forming a minority government, forging a coalition with the Peasants' Agreement, the Christian National Union and various independents. However, Olszewski's government proved to be deeply unstable, falling within half a year. By the 1993 election, the Center Civic Alliance had dissolved, due to its former Centre Agreement core suffering from numerous party defections and splits into new independent groups.

She was built in 1989 by W√§rtsil√§ Marine, Turku, for Rederi AB Slite as MS Athena for use in Viking Line traffic. Between 1993 and 2001, she sailed as MS Langkapuri Star Aquarius. From 2001 to 2011 she sailed as MS Pearl of Scandinavia. Pearl Seaways has a sister ship, Star Pisces History Viking Line service MS Athena in Saltsj√∂n, Sweden between 1989 and 1993 In the latter half of the 1980s owners of the rival shipping companies Viking Line and Silja Line competed heavily for dominance on routes connecting Finland to Sweden, with 11 new builds delivered between 1985 and 1991. At this time, there was also a strong belief in growing of the cruise passenger market. In response to challenge from the other Viking Line partner SF Line and Silja's owners, Rederi AB Slite ordered two new builds from W√§rtsil√§ Turku shipyard. The first of these was to be called MS Athena, and she was planned to replace the aging on the freight- dominant Naantali‚ÄìKapellsk√§r service. The ship was designed by Per Dockson.Designs89 The authorities of Kapellsk√§r failed to modernise their harbour to accommodate such a large ship, and when delivered in April 1989 the ship (which at the time of delivery was the largest cruiseferry in the world) was set on cruise traffic between Stockholm and Mariehamn, replacing the aged MS Apollo III. Additional public spaces, such as an \\"amusement park\\" and a disco were built on her cardeck. Part of the cardeck was also used as a parking space for cruise passengers who came to Stockholm with their own cars. Apart from a fire in one of the cabins in May 1989, the Athena's service with Viking Line proved to be uneventful. In spring 1993, she made a test cruise from Stockholm to Riga. Unfortunately at the same time her owners were experiencing notable financial difficulties and were forced to declare bankruptcy in April 1993. Athena continued serving with Viking Line until August of the same year, when she was laid up in Stockholm awaiting sale. DFDS and P&O; Ferries were both interested in her, and it was believed that the latter would be her new owner. In the end Malaysia-based Star Cruises made a bid their competitors couldn't match. Star Cruises service In September 1993 Athena was renamed Star Aquarius, re-flagged into Panama and started her journey from the Baltic to Singapore. Between October and December she was rebuilt in Sembawang dock, Singapore, as a cruiseship. Her interior decorations were changed and her entire cardeck was altered into a huge casino. Her Viking Line-red hull was replaced with a dark blue one and the base of her funnel repainted blue, with a yellow star where Viking's logo had been. This readaptation of Viking Line's funnel colours remains Star Cruises' funnel colour scheme to this day. During the rebuilding her name was again changed, this time into Langkapuri Star Aquarius. The ship was designed by Per Dockson. In 1994 the Langkapuri Star Aquarius begun cruising from Singapore (in practice the ships's name was often displayed as Star Aquarius in promotional material). In 1998 her port of departure was changed into Hong Kong, and around the same time she received Star Cruises' new white-hulled livery. The former carferry was never a particularly practical cruiseship however, and when Star Cruises started taking delivery of various newbuilds the Langkapuri Star Aquarius was placed for sale. Eventually she was sold to DFDS on 11 January 2001. DFDS service Pearl of Scandinavia in Oslo, Norway in 2002 Pearl Seaways in Copenhagen, Denmark in 2014 The ship arrived back in Europe in March 2001 under the temporary name MS Aquarius. Between April and June of the same year she was rebuilt back into a car-passenger ferry first at Blohm & Voss, Hamburg, and then at √Ölborg where most of the alterations to her interior were carried out, any alterations to the vessel that were added by Star Cruises were removed. She received her new name MS Pearl of Scandinavia while at Hamburg. During the rebuilding rearsponsons were added to the ship for increased stability. Finally on 26 June she started on her first journey between Copenhagen, Helsingborg and Oslo. On 27 December 2001 the ship had a blackout in Oslofjord and was drifting for an hour before power could be re-established. In January 2002 the ship was again rebuilt, this time at Copenhagen, and again in January 2005 at √ñresundsvarvet, Landskrona, Sweden. In October 2006 DFDS decided to drop the stop at Helsingborg in order to save fuel and pilot expenses. On 17 November 2010, a fire broke out in the car-deck of the ferry while en route from Oslo to Copenhagen. After a re-fit following the fire she was painted in DFDS new livery and renamed MS Pearl Seaways. Pearl hosts hundreds of homeless people for christmas lunch. In 2018, an 11kV/2MW shorepower kit was added to Pearl at Lind√∏ shipyard. After testing, Pearl started official shorepower operation in Oslo on 1 March 2019, for a potential 2.6 GWh consumption per year. In the summer of 2020 and after a 46 year break Frederikshavn was introduced as a stop on the route in both directions.

Race career In 1985, Precisionist won the Strub Series at Santa Anita Park becoming only the fifth horse to win the Malibu Stakes, the San Fernando Stakes and the Charles H. Strub Stakes. Although he earned an Eclipse Award as a champion sprinter and was a Breeders' Cup sprint winner, Precisionist was also a winner of races beyond a mile including Grade I races at 1¬º miles. In 1986, Precisionist won the Woodward Stakes over Lady's Secret (eventual Horse of the Year). In the fall, Precisionist and Turkoman were the heavy favorites for the Breeders' Cup Classic but he ran second and third respectively to upset winner, Skywalker. In 1988, overcoming both the 20-month layoff and a fracture to his left foreleg that was repaired with a pin, Precisionist set the current one-mile track record at Del Mar Racetrack in 1:33 1/5. William Donovan handled the training duties for Precisionist's final start when he finished twelfth in the 1988 Sunny Isle Handicap at Calder Race Course. Stud career Retired initially at age 6, Precisionist proved nearly sterile, siring only four offspring in three foal crops. He produced three daughters and a son, all started and two were winners; none were stakes winners. His progeny earned a total of $34,230. He managed to become a one-time proven dam-sire when his daughter, Preciseness, produced the graded stakes winner Dawn Again, and his granddaughters had several stakes performers. Retirement As a result of his inability to reliably produce foals, his owners returned him to racing under trainer John Russell. He was permanently retired after a successful 1988 campaign. Several attempts were made to improve his fertility, but nothing worked to satisfaction. He was sent to live at a farm in Ocala, Florida where he remained until June 2006 when he was sent to the Old Friends, Inc. equine retirement center near Georgetown, Kentucky.

A correspondent and friend of Charles Darwin, Tegetmeier studied pigeon breeds and the optimality of hexagonal honeycomb cells constructed by honeybees. He wrote a number of books dealing with home economics, poultry farming, pigeon breeds, bee-keeping and on the maintenance of livestock.  Early life  Caricature by Jack Brough Born in Colnbrook, Buckinghamshire, the oldest of three sons, of Sarah Luer and Godfrey Conrad Tegetmeier. His father was a Hanover surgeon who had worked on board the H.M.S. Niobe during the war in America and briefly on a Russian man-of-war.Richardson (1916):2 He received his early education at home and when he was twelve, the family moved to London and he worked as an apprentice to his father for five years before studying at the University College London and training at the hospital where he was a clinical clerk to John Elliotson. Some of his fellow students included Ray Lankester, William Jenner and W.B. Carpenter. He then moved to work in Northamptonshire to assist local physician Frederic Gee. Returning to London in 1841 he attended lectures by John Hoppus to train in mesmerism and then led a life of Bohemianism and worked as a freelance journalist.Richardson (1916):27  Bohemianism  A blue pouter from the frontispiece of Pigeons (1868) Around the 1840s, Tegetmeier took some interest in cockfights, writing about them in Colman's Magazine under the pen name of \\"T. Hornby\\". Around 1845 he worked briefly as a school teacher and in December of the same year he married Anne Edwards Stone who worked in the school associated with the Home and Colonial School Society college where he taught domestic economy.Richardson (1916):32 Their marriage led to their dismissal from their teaching posts but William was reinstated after a while.Richardson (1916):39 He wrote several textbooks for students including \\"Arithmetical tables\\", \\"Classification of Animals and Vegetables\\" and \\"First Lines of Botany\\".Richardson (1916):34 In 1851 he wrote \\"The Book of One Hundred Beverages\\" which included recipes for various non-alcoholic drinks.Richardson (1916):36 The Tegetmeiers initially lived in a very small house on Drury Lane. They had a daughter Edith in 1847 followed by a son Egbert in 1852 after moving to Tottenham and in 1854 the family moved to Willesden and then Wood Green in 1855.Richardson (1916):41 Tegetmeier was interested in birds, especially fowl and pigeons, from a young age. He wrote several articles on these topics in the Cottage Gardener and wrote a book on Profitable Poultry. Finding that writing was successful, he began to write many other books including The Poultry Book (1867) and Pigeons (1868) which went through several editions with plates by Harrison Weir. He also wrote on ornamental pheasants and game birds. Charles Darwin's interest in pigeon varieties led him through William Yarrell, for sometime the Tegetmeier's houseowner and a good friend, to Tegetmeier who eventually became a promoter of ideas on evolution. He moved from Wood Green to Fortis Green, near Muswell Hill in 1856.  Experimentation and collaboration with Darwin  193x193px Around the time that he moved to live in Muswell Hill, he took a keen interest in bee keeping, and discovered how bees created the hexagon-shaped cells in their hives. He set up an experimental bee house for the Apiarian Society of London for which he was the honorary secretary.Richardson (1916):47 He conducted a number of experiments and estimated that bees needed 12-15 lbs of sugar to produce a pound of wax.Richardson (1916):48 Along with Darwin he conducted experiments involving the application of colour dyes to wax to determine that bees attempted to form cylindrical cells that were altered to a hexagonal form by their attempts to economize on wax. Darwin also had Tegetmeier repeat some of his experiments on breeding different varieties of pigeons and fowl to see if their offspring were fertile.Richardson (1916):105 Tegetmeier was elected a Fellow of the Zoological Society, a member of the British Ornithologists‚Äô Union from 1837 and he became the natural history editor of The Field magazine.  Poultry, livestock and later life  One of Tegetmeier's major works was the Poultry Book (1867) in which he sought to cover all the known breeds of domestic fowl. As an expert on poultry breeding, he was routinely called to judge breeds at poultry exhibitions. He gained a reputation as a strict judge and came to be known as \\"Teggy the fighter.\\"Richardson (1916):91-93 Tegetmeier's work with homing pigeons led to the establishment of military pigeon posts and their use in war time before the advent of telegraphy. A secretary of the Philoperisteron Society, he was the first to organize pigeon races. He also took an interest in the use of mules in the army. Tegetmeier considered himself a practical and economically minded naturalist. Along with Eleanor Ormerod, he considered the house sparrow to be a pest and supported measures for its control. He revised the work of F.O. Morris, A natural history of the nests and eggs of British birds (1897). Around 1882 he was regular writer for The Queen, a women's weekly. He was a Tory and opposed campaigns for women's rights and suffrage. He died at Golders Green and was buried in St. Marylebone cemetery in East Finchley. He had four daughters and a son. At the time of his death, he was the oldest founding member of the Savage Club. He also acted in some of the Savage Club's amateur theatre presentations.Richardson (1916):125 He was a collector of fine books. A green heritage plaque was installed on the house where he had lived at 101 St James's Lane, Muswell Hill in 2008.

One feature of vernacular culture is that it is informal. Such culture is generally engaged in on a non-profit and voluntary basis, and is almost never funded by the state. The term is used in the modern study of geography and cultural studies. It generally implies a cultural form that differs markedly from a deeply rooted folk culture, and also from tightly organised subcultures and religious cultures. In cultural and communication studies, vernacular rhetoric is the discursive aspect of vernacular culture, referring to \\"mundane, bottom- up, and informal discursive expressions that challenge and criticize the institutional\\".

The northern segment connects Lexington Avenue with U.S. Route 60 and US 220. Route description View north at the south end of SR 154 at I-64 in Covington SR 154 begins at a partial cloverleaf interchange with I-64. The roadway continues south as unnumbered Durant Road. SR 154 heads north as an extension of Durant Road, a four-lane divided highway that parallels a rail spur to a manufacturing plant in the southern part of the city. The state highway and rail spur diverge as they cross the Jackson River. North of the bridge, Durant Road splits north to continue along the rail line while SR 154's divided highway curves to the northwest along Craig Avenue, which passes through a commercial area and intersects another rail spur. The state highway reduces to a two-lane street at Chestnut Street, after which the highway passes between the baseball and football fields of Covington High School. SR 154 continues through a residential area to its southern segment's northern terminus at Locust Street. The northern segment of SR 154 begins at Lexington Avenue on the edge of downtown Covington; the route's disjoint sections are connected by Locust Street and Lexington Avenue. The state highway heads northeast as Riverside Drive through a residential area one block west of Main Street and to the east of the parallel Jackson River. At the north end of the downtown area, SR 154 intersects US 60 (Monroe Avenue) just east of the U.S. Highway's bridge over the Jackson River at its confluence with Dunlap Creek.

The Sonnenberg Tunnel is a long motorway tunnel, constructed between 1971 and 1976 and located in Lucerne, Switzerland. At its completion it was also the world's largest civilian nuclear fallout shelter, designed to protect 20,000 civilians in the eventuality of war or disaster. Catherine Frammery, \\"Dans les entrailles du Sonnenberg, monstrueux t√©moin de la Guerre froide\\", Le temps, Monday 15 August 2016 (page visited on 15 August 2015). Motorway tunnel The A2 motorway from Chiasso to Basel passes through the tunnel and carries around 55,000 vehicles a day. There are tentative plans to construct a bypass to replace the section of the motorway that leads through Lucerne, which includes the Sonnenberg and Reussport tunnels. Civil defence shelter Based on a federal law from 1963, Switzerland aims to provide nuclear fallout shelters for the entire population of the country. The construction of a new tunnel near an urban centre was seen as an opportunity to provide shelter space for a large number of people at the same time. The installations that allowed the tunnel to be converted into a fallout shelter cost around $32.5 million, of which approximately $5 million were borne by the municipality of Lucerne. The shelter consisted of the two motorway tunnels (one per direction of travel), each capable of holding 10,000 people in 64 person subdivisions. A seven story cavern between the tunnels contained shelter infrastructure including a command post, an emergency hospital, a radio studio, a telephone centre, prison cells and ventilation machines. The shelter was designed to withstand the blast from a 1 megaton nuclear explosion 1 kilometre away. The blast doors at the tunnel portals are 1.5 meters thick and weigh 350 tons. The logistical problems of maintaining a population of 20,000 in close confines were not thoroughly explored, and testing the installation was difficult because it required closing the motorway and rerouting the usual traffic. The only large- scale test, a five-day exercise in 1987 to practice converting the road tunnels into usable shelters, revealed many problems: among other things, it took 24 hours to fully close all four blast doors, and it proved impossible to set up the 20,000 beds within reasonable time. Afterwards, the shelter's capacity was reassessed at 10,000-17,000. Doubts about the tunnel's viability as a shelter remained. After the end of the Cold War, the high maintenance costs seemed unjustified for an installation that was clearly geared towards use during wartime and couldn't be readied within hours for short-term use after disasters. In 2006, after a long political debate, it was decided to abandon the road tunnel's secondary civil defense function and instead convert the central seven story cavern into a shelter with a more modest capacity of 2,000. Since 2008 people can visit the cavern on guided tours and to get an insight into the bunker world of the Cold War.

Life and career Jaheen was born in Shobra district, Cairo in 1930 to a middle-class family. He studied law in Cairo University. In 1955, he started working for the Egyptian weekly magazine \\"Rose al-Yousef\\" as a cartoonist. A year later, he moved to the new magazine \\"Sabah el-Khair\\" for which he became the editor-in-chief, then he joined Al- Ahram. Together with Fuad Haddad, Jaheen had a great role in development of Egyptian colloquial poetry. In fact, the term \\"shi'r al-ammiya\\" or \\"Arabic colloquial poetry\\" was only coined in 1961 by a group of young poets including Salah Jahin, Abd Al-Rahman Abnudi, Fuad Qaud and Sayyid Higab who called themselves \\"Jama't Ibn Arus\\". Before that, poetry in colloquial Egyptian Arabic was regarded as a folkloric and low art produced by and for the uneducated masses, while the term \\"Shi'r\\" (Arabic for poetry) was restricted to poetry written in Modern Standard Arabic (commonly known as \\"Fu·π£·∏•ƒÅ\\", meaning most eloquent). He wrote several plays for the puppet theatre. He was also known for his nationalist and patriotic songs that marked the revolutionary era of Gamal Abdel Nasser role, many of which were performed by the famous Egyptian singer Abdel Halim Hafez. The poet was highly inspired by the 1952 Revolution and was sometimes known as the semiofficial poet of the revolution. However, after Egypt's defeat in the 1967 war and Gamal Abdel Nasser death in 1970 he suffered from a severe depression. In one interview, he said that with the death of Nasser in 1970 and the sudden shift in political orientation he felt increasingly like Hamlet, with Sadat embodying the treacherous Claudius. In addition to political poetry, Jahin's poems frequently contain metaphysical and philosophical themes, questioning the purpose of human life, the nature of good and evil, human and divine will and the limits of human pursuit of freedom and happiness. In 1965, Jaheen was awarded the Egyptian Order of Science and Arts of the First Class. He died in 1986 at the age of 55. Works As a poet Ruba'iyat (Quatrains) In 1963 Jaheen wrote his quatrains or rubaiyat in which he expressed his beliefs, emotions and views of life, existence, good and evil. Each verse ended with one ironic expression \\"Agabi\\" or \\"how strange !\\". Quatrains are sometimes argued as the greatest popular poetic achievement in Egypt in the last 50 years. In Egypt's Name In 1971, Jaheen wrote \\"Ala Esm Masr\\" or \\"In Egypt's name\\", an epic poem narrating the history of Egypt, from the pharaoic era till present. Each verse ended with the same expression \\"Ala esm Masr\\" or \\"In Egypt's name\\" but each time holding a new meaning. In this poem Jaheen repeatedly expressed his love for his country. In one stanza, he says: :\\"History may say what it wishes in Egypt name :Egypt, for me, is the most beloved and most beautiful of things. :I love her when she owns the earth, east and west. :And I love her when she is down, wounded in a battle. :I love her fiercely, gently and with modesty. :I hate her and curse her with the passion of the lovesick. :I leave her and flee down one path, and she remains in another . :She turns to find me beside her in misfortune. :My veins pulsating with a thousand tunes and rhythms. :In Egypt's name.\\" Others His other books of colloquial poetry include: *An al-qamar wa al-teen (1961). *Qasaqis Waraq, (1966). *Dawawin Salah Jahin, (1977). *Angham Siptambirriyah, (1984). As a cartoonist Others Jaheen wrote the lyrics of many songs, mostly patriotic songs that were performed by Abdel Halim Hafez. His songs include: \\"Soura\\" or photo, \\"ehna elsha'b\\" or \\"we are the people\\", \\"Khaly elselah sahy\\" or \\"oh weapon, be ready\\", \\"Ya ahlan belma'arek\\" or Welcome battles\\" and \\"El-mas'oulia\\" or \\"Responsibility\\". He wrote for the puppet theatre, including the famous operetta \\"El-leila el-kebira\\" or The Grand Night. Jaheen also worked as a film producer, screenwriter and an actor. His screenplays included: \\"Awdat al ibn al dal\\" or The return of the prodigal son ; directed by Youssef Chahine, \\"El less wal kilab\\" (based on the novel The Thief and the Dogs by Naguib Mahfouz), \\"Shafika we Metwali\\" or \\"Shafika and Metwali\\", \\"Khally ballak men Zouzou\\" (\\"Watch Out for Zouzou\\") and \\"Amira Hoby Ana\\" or Amira My Sweetheart. In the latter two, the famous Egyptian actress Suad Husni sang some of her most beautiful songs: \\"Ya wad ya te'eel\\", \\"Khally ballak men Zouzou\\" or \\"Take Care of Zouzou\\", \\"El-hayah ba'a lonha bamby\\" or \\"Life has turned pink\\" and \\"El-donia rabe'\\" or \\"It's spring time\\". He also wrote the script and lyrics for the \\"Riddles\\"-a television series with a riddle in each episode presented during the month of Ramadan in the Egyptian and Arab televisions- for several successive years and for the television serial \\"Howa wa heya\\" or \\"He and She\\" portrayed by Ahmad Zaki and Suad Husni. 2010, The Egyptian Singer Tony Kaldas composed a song from his lyrics and sang it in a new different style, in a classical way with Piano.

Another term used to refer to the art of cold painting and gilding on the back of glass is verre √©glomis√©, named after the French decorator Jean-Baptiste Glomy (1711‚Äì86), who framed prints using glass that had been reverse-painted.Michelle A. Erhardt and Amy M. Morris, Mary Magdalene, Iconographic Studies from the Middle Ages to the Baroque (Brill, 2012; ), p. 315. In German it is known as Hinterglasmalerei. Captain Joseph' - Chinese reverse glass painting from c. 1785-9. This art form has been around for many years. It was widely used for sacral paintings since the Middle Ages. The most famous was the art of icons in the Byzantine Empire. Later the painting on glass spread to Italy, where in Venice it influenced its Renaissance art. Since the middle of the 18th century, painting on glass became favored by the Church and the nobility throughout Central Europe. A number of clock faces were created using this technique in the early-to- mid-19th century. Throughout the 19th century painting on glass was widely popular as folk art in Austria, Bavaria, Moravia, Bohemia and Slovakia. Unfortunately, during the inter-war period (1914‚Äì1945) this traditional \\"naive\\" technique fell nearly to a complete oblivion and its methods of paint composition and structural layout had to be re-invented by combining acrylic and oil paints. A new method of reverse painting emerged using polymer glazing methods that permitted the artworks to be painted direct to an acrylic UV coating on the glass. The unique under glass effect retains a curious depth even though the layered painting on the glass was bonded to a final linen support and now stretcher bar mounted after being carefully removed from the original 'glass easel'. Current glass painting may disappear with the advent of using aerospace mylar as a preliminary support. This style of painting is found in traditional Romanian icons originating from Transylvania. Jesuit missionaries brought it to China, and it spread to Japan from China during the Edo period. Japanese artists took up the technique during the nineteenth century. Reverse glass painting was also popular in India and Senegal in the nineteenth century.  Reverse glass painting in the United States  Two American artists, Marsden Hartley and Rebecca Salsbury James, made artworks using reverse glass painting. Both were inspired by American folk art that included painting on glass, for instance, tinsel painting. Hartley's work in this medium began in 1917. He painted about a dozen still lifes of curvilinear vessels with flowers using this method, but after his initial enthusiasm, he gave up reverse glass painting in less than a year. James began reverse painting in 1928, after Hartley introduced her to the technique. Over the next three decades, she created some 200 floral still lifes, desert landscapes, and non-objective portraits in this medium.

Biography Kaufmann studied jurisprudence and philosophy in Vienna. He became part of the legal- philosophical school of Hans Kelsen. From 1922 to 1938 he was a Privatdozent at the University of Vienna. During this time Kaufmann was associated with the Vienna Circle. He also wrote on the foundations of mathematics where, along with Hermann Weyl and Oskar Becker, he was attempting to apply the phenomenology of Edmund Husserl to constructive mathematics. In 1938, the conditions for Jewish scholars became too hard and he left for the USA. There he taught until his death as a law professor, in the Graduate Faculty of the New York School for Social Research. Kaufmann also aided fellow Austrian emigres in need of assistance during the pre-war years when the situation became dire for Jewish academics and scholars in Germany and Austria. Interceding on Karl Popper's behalf, Popper was offered academic hospitality at Cambridge University and a stipend of ¬£150 for one year - this offer was transferable, and Friedrich Waismann took it up when Popper went to New Zealand instead (see John Watkins in Proceedings of the British Academy, 94, 645-684, 652). In 1936 he produced a book on the methodology of the social sciences (Kaufmann 1936). After moving to the United States he was invited to write a similar book in English, but what he produced (Kaufmann 1944) was significantly different, under the influence of Dewey's Logic: The Theory of Inquiry. The original book was translated over 70 years later (Cohen and Helling 2014).

He is a Welsh former Youth and Under-21 international, and has also played for Rushden & Diamonds, Stamford, Cambridge United, Kettering Town, Gainsborough Trinity, Stevenage Borough, Oxford United, Wrexham, Newport County, Mansfield Town, Grimsby Town, Lincoln City, King's Lynn Town, Ilkeston and Nuneaton Town. Playing career Early career Robert Duffy, who is older brother to footballer Richard Duffy, played his junior football in Swansea for Garden Village. He came through the youth system at Charlton Athletic, but was never offered a professional contract. Duffy followed Charlton's youth team manager Terry Westley to Rushden & Diamonds in 2001, where he made over 30 appearances, most as a substitute. He fractured his kneecap in a training ground accident in August 2003 and did not play again until January 2004, when he played most of a reserve game. He struggled to regain form, was loaned to non-league club Stamford and had short spells with Cambridge United and Kettering Town before joining Gainsborough Trinity in January 2006. Duffy ended the 2005‚Äì06 season at Stevenage Borough. Oxford United Duffy was recommended to Oxford United by former youth development officer, Malcolm Elias, and joined the club on a one-month trial in July 2006. He was signed by Oxford at the beginning of the 2006‚Äì07 season on a two-year contract, and was Oxford United's top scorer in that season, including a hat-trick against Forest Green Rovers in October 2006. In September 2007, Duffy broke his left arm after falling awkwardly during a match, which sidelined him for two months. In November, he returned to action as a late substitute in the 78th minute against Ebbsfleet United, but was sent off just 20 seconds later after an off-the-ball incident with Ebbsfleet's Mark Ricketts as he went past him. Duffy was placed on the transfer list in January 2008 as manager Darren Patterson tried to free up funds to bring in new players, and joined Wrexham on loan later that month. He made only six substitute appearances for Wrexham and in April 2008, was released and returned to Oxford. Newport County He was released by Oxford at the end of the season and, after an unsuccessful trial at Mansfield Town, he signed for Conference South side Newport County in July 2008. Mansfield Town On 7 January 2009 Duffy then signed permanently for Mansfield Town, managed by David Holdsworth, twin brother of his manager at Newport County, Dean Holdsworth. Despite his lack of goals at Newport, David Holdsworth's faith in Duffy was repaid as he scored the winning goal on his Mansfield debut, going on to score eight further times as Mansfield pulled away from the Conference relegation zone to finish in mid-table. Grimsby Town On Monday 24 January 2011 it was stated on BBC Radio Humberside that Duffy had failed to agree personal terms with Grimsby Town after a fee was agreed between the two clubs. After further negotiation, it was announced on 28 January that Duffy had signed a two-year deal with the Mariners. Duffy scored 28 seconds into his Grimsby debut in their 3‚Äì2 win over Eastbourne Borough on 29 January 2011 and three days later he scored again as Town drew 2‚Äì2 away at Southport. Following the conclusion of the 10‚Äì11 season and despite being under contract, Duffy was told that he no longer had a future at the club and he was free to find himself a new one. On 16 May 2011 Town chairman John Fenty mentioned that the club had made a mistake in signing Duffy and teammates Charles Ademeno and Serge Makofo. Duffy however stayed for nearly the entire 11‚Äì12 campaign, and after playing a cameo role all season he was released before the final game of the season.http://www.grimsby- townfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10417~2750099,00.html Lincoln City On Monday 21 May 2012 Duffy signed a 1-year contract with Lincoln City. On 9 April 2013 Duffy was released by the club after an injury hit season had restricted him to only 3 games during the 2012‚Äì13 season. Non League In August 2013 he joined King's Lynn Town. In March 2014, Duffy joined Ilkeston, debuting in the club's 2‚Äì0 home Northern Premier League defeat to Buxton on 15 March 2014. On 1 July 2015 he joined Nuneaton as a player coach. On 1 July 2015, Duffy joined Nuneaton Town. In June 2016 he moved on to join Basford United.

The mission was founded in 1730 on the west bank of the nearby R√≠o San Jos√©, and its full name is taken for the life-giving freshwater estuary. In 1734 the Peric√∫ Revolt broke out, Tamaral was killed, and the mission was destroyed. In 1735‚Äì1736, the reestablished outpost was moved back closer to the coast, but it served as a visita for Mission Santiago and as the site of a Spanish presidio. In 1753, San Jos√© del Cabo was again moved inland. In 1795, under the Dominicans, the surviving native population of Mission Santiago was transferred to San Jos√© del Cabo. The mission was finally closed in 1840. See also *Los Cabos Municipality * References Further reading * Vernon, Edward W. 2002.

The group was last stationed at Hurlburt Field, Florida. The Group is a direct successor to the 17th Pursuit Group, one of the 15 original combat air groups formed by the Army before World War II. The 17th's heritage traces back to World War I, when the 95th Aero Squadron played a key role in the St. Mihiel, Meuse-Argonne, and other Allied campaigns. These battles are symbolized by the seven pattee crosses on the 17th's shield, and it was from the 95th, together with the 34th and 73d Pursuit Squadrons, that the 17th first was formed. The Group's aircraft and many of its aircrews took part in the 1942 Doolittle Raid on Imperial Japan. During World War II the 17th Bomb Group was the only combat organization to fight all three of the Axis powers (Japan, Italy, and Germany) on three continents (Asia, Africa, and Europe). History : See 17th Training Wing for associated history. Origins Boeing P-12Bs of the 34th Pursuit Squadron. Boeing P-26A Peashooters of the 17th Pursuit Group, March Field, California. B-25Bs on USS Hornet en route to Japan. Martin B-26C Marauders of the 34th Bomb Squadron returning from a mission, 1944 41-35177 in foreground. Authorized originally as the 17th Observation Group on 18 October 1927, the unit was redesignated the 17th Pursuit Group and finally activated at March Field, California, on 15 July 1931. At March, it operated Boeing P-12 and P-26 fighter aircraft until, in 1935, it was redesignated the 17th Attack Group and acquired the Northrop A-17 attack bomber. In 1939 the unit was redesignated again, becoming the 17th Bombardment Group (Medium) and converting to the Douglas B-18 Bolo bomber. In August and September 1941 the group was the first to be equipped with the new North American B-25 Mitchell bomber. From its training base in Pendleton, Oregon, it deployed to Jackson, Mississippi; Augusta, Georgia and March Field in the fall of 1941 to participate in large scale maneuvers with the Army Ground Forces, returning to Pendleton immediately following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. World War II From Pendleton, the 17th Bombardment Group flew anti-submarine patrols from Pendleton, Oregon, off the west coast of the United States. As the first unit to operate the B-25, the 17th achieved another \\"first\\" on 24 December 1941 when one of its Mitchells, flown by 1st Lt. Everett W. Holstrom, dropped four 300-pound bombs on a Japanese submarine near the mouth of the Columbia River. Doolittle Raid After the Doolittle Raid was approved in February 1942, the group was chosen to provide the crews from which volunteers would be recruited. It had been the first unit to receive B-25s, with all four of its squadrons equipped with the bomber by September 1941. It was not only was the first medium bomb group of the Army Air Corps, but in early 1942, also had the most experienced B-25 crews. Its first assignment following the entry of the United States into the war was to the U.S. Eighth Air Force.Craven and Cate 1948, p. 439. The group was immediately moved from Pendleton cross-country to Columbia Army Air Base at West Columbia, South Carolina, ostensibly to fly similar patrols off the east coast of the United States, but in actuality to prepare for the mission against Japan. The group officially transferred effective 9 February 1942 to Columbia, where its combat crews were offered the opportunity to volunteer for an \\"extremely hazardous\\", but unspecified mission. On 19 February, the group was detached from the Eighth Air Force and officially assigned to III Bomber Command.Craven and Cate 1948, p. 614. Initial planning called for 20 aircraft to fly the mission,Craven and Cate 1948, p. 440. and 24 of the group's B-25B Mitchell bombers were diverted to the Mid-Continent Airlines modification center in Minneapolis, Minnesota. With support provided by two senior airline managers, Wold-Chamberlain Field's maintenance hangar was the first modification center to become operational. On the morning of 18 April 1942, some 600 miles east of Japan, the aircraft carrier launched 16 Mitchells on the highly successful Doolittle raid on Tokyo and other Japanese cities. A boost to American morale, the raid marked the first combat launch of bombers from an aircraft carrier and the first American aerial attack on the Japanese mainland. Piloting the 16th Mitchell was 1st Lt. William G. Farrow, captured and subsequently executed by the Japanese after completing his mission. Following the Doolittle raid, the group transferred to Barksdale Field, Louisiana, and began training on the Martin B-26 Marauder medium bomber. Twelfth Air Force In December the group transferred once more, this time to Telergma Airport, Algeria, where it participated in the North African campaign as part of Twelfth Air Force. The aircraft of the 17th Group left for Africa equipped with the Norden Bombsight, however only the leader of each flight carried the Norden, with the remainder dropping their bombs when the leader dropped. As German fighter opposition declined, the Marauder crews in the Mediterranean began removing the four package guns. Upon the expulsion of Axis forces from North Africa in May 1943, the 17th transferred to Sedrata Airfield, Algeria, to begin air operations against Pantelleria. Five by eight miles in dimension, the Mediterranean island sheltered an important Axis airfield with hangars carved into solid rock. Its sheer cliffs would have proved a daunting obstacle to amphibious invasion but precision bombardment by the 17th secured the surrender of the island's defenders in less than a month. As part of the Fifteenth Air Force, the group followed the Allied forces from North Africa from bases in Tunisia, Sardinia, Corsica, and France, the 17th conducted bombing missions against critical targets throughout the Mediterranean, Italy, southern France and Germany. It later returned to Twelfth Air Force in January 1944. It received a Distinguished Unit Citation for its support of the Anzio invasion and another for its outstanding performance over Schweinfurt. For operations in support of the invasion of southern France, it received the French Croix de Guerre with Palm. All told, the group conducted 624 missions and participated in 11 campaigns during the war, finally returning to the United States and inactivating in November 1945. Korean War With war in Korea the group was activated to replace the Air Force Reserve 452d Bombardment Group when its term of service was up in May 1952. Assigned to Far East Air Forces, being stationed at Pusan East (K-9) Air Base, South Korea, in May 1952. There, the group flew Douglas B-26 Invader light bombers on night intruder strikes along enemy supply routes. In August, the group switched to daylight formation raids, earning the Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation by the end of the war in July 1953. It flew one of the last if not the last mission of the Korean War. Cold War On 10 October 1954 the unit received orders to move to Miho AFB, Japan. This move was accomplished and training operations commenced from Japan. The group was to be re outfitted with Martin B-57 Canberra's, the new jet light bomber. On 26 January 1955, due to problems in the B-57 program, this decision was reversed and the unit was directed to transfer with 39 aircraft to Hurlburt Auxiliary Field, Florida. Training flights continued through January. In February, all flying except that concerned with cruise control missions was terminated. The aircraft were stripped of all armament (guns, turrets, sighting equipment and rocket racks) and fitted with 625 gallon auxiliary tanks. On 16 April the first section of 4 aircraft departed. The last section departed on 19 April. Either a B-29 or a C-124, as a lead ship, escorted each flight of four aircraft. The last aircraft landed in Hulburt on 29 April.

The local residents built the chapel in 1892 & made it non-denominational, which it remains today. On May 14, 1992, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. History Prior to constructing this chapel, the community used the home of local resident Grace Cummings, called Myrtle Cottage, as the place of worship. For many years, mainland ministers held seasonal services at the chapel. The hurricane of 1924 significantly damaged the foundation of the chapel and services did not resume until repairs were complete in December 1927. In 1929, the trustees hired Reverend Walter Lamphear as the first minister. Dr. Vincent Booth succeeded Lamphear as the minister from 1939-1943. In 1942, extensive upgrades to the chapel doubled the seating capacity from 70 to 140. Also, the size of the chancel was increased and transepts were added on the east and west sides. Chaplain Roy M. Terry, a retired Air Force Chief of Chaplains, served as minister from 1982 to 1988 and instituted year-round worship services. On January 10, 1992, the congregation dedicated the Roy Terry Center for Christian Fellowship in his honor. Chaplain John Rasberry also served as the minister. In July 2000, retired Air Force Chaplain John Secret became minister and he serves in this position today. In 2004, the Terry Center received major damage from the series of hurricanes that hit the area. In September 2005, the congregation rededicated the Center upon completion of renovations.

It is written in common time and moves at a moderate tempo of 100 beats per minute. Beyonc√©'s vocal range spans around one and a half octaves in the song, from B3 to F5. Storch and Beyonc√© interpolated the refrain of the 1975 song \\"Love to Love You Baby\\", originally performed by Donna Summer and written by Summer, Pete Bellotte and Giorgio Moroder. Musically, \\"Naughty Girl\\" is influenced by Middle Eastern and Arabic music, resulting to an uptempo and disco-oriented sound. The song also displays dancehall as well as reggae influences, and is built on squiggling synth grooves weave. According to Spence D. of IGN Music, Beyonc√©'s vocals on the song are layered, making them sound like \\"a harem of Beyonc√©'s warbling for the affections of some sultan of swing.\\" According to James Poletti of Yahoo! Music, the female protagonist in the song sings about her \\"potential to turn on the filth.\\" Lyrically, the song is a celebration of sexual lust and conquest, culminating in a desire for a one-night stand. This \\"lustful sexual confidence\\" is further demonstrated in the lyrics of the first verse: \\"I'm feeling sexy / Wa[nt to] hear you say my name, boy/ If you can reach me, you can feel my burning flame / Feeling kind of N A S T Y / I might just take you home with me\\" and the chorus lines: \\" Tonight I'll be your naughty girl / I'm callin' all my girls / We're gonna turn this party out / I know you want my body.\\" Throughout the song, Beyonc√© sings the lines \\"I'd love to love you, baby\\" almost whispering. Critical reception \\"Naughty Girl\\" was critically lauded for its sensual vibe. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine wrote that Beyonc√© delivers a \\"convincing impression of Donna Summer\\". Los Angeles Times' Natalie Nichols wrote that \\"the deliberately Donna Summer-esque 'Naughty Girl' [...] successfully meld [Beyonc√©] breathy cooing with hip, interesting production.\\"Nichols, Natalie (June 24, 2003) Review: Dangerously in Love.

He also added that the song was guaranteed to have even \\"the most staid of folks slithering across the dance floor.\\" James Poletti of Yahoo! Music wrote that \\"Naughty Girl\\" mingles \\"Holly Valance Moorish exoticism with a typically tight R&B; groove.\\" Rob Fitzpatrick of NME characterized Beyonc√©'s breathing heavily while grabbing the \\"imaginary\\" bedsheets but remained a \\"devout young Christian woman singing what the public wants her to sing.\\"Fitzpatrick, Rob. Review: Dangerously in Love. NME. IPC Media. July 2, 2003. Retrieved on February 10, 2011. Describing \\"Naughty Girl\\" as an uptempo party track, Lisa Verrico of The Times commented that the song features \\"an unusually high- pitched Beyonc√© singing lines such as 'The rhythm's got me going crazy'\\". Neil Drumming of Entertainment Weekly found Beyonc√©'s singing \\"not quite convincingly a naughty girl\\". This was echoed by Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times who said it was fun to hear Beyonc√© mimicking \\"the pizzicato line\\" in \\"Naughty Girl\\", and that it was not much fun to hear her try to sing \\"like a naughty girl\\". Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic commented that \\"Storch does his most convincing imitation of the Neptunes writing their own Kashmir in a Middle Eastern restaurant\\". Chart performance \\"Naughty Girl\\" did not achieve the chart success of \\"Crazy in Love\\" and \\"Baby Boy\\". However, like the latter and \\"Me, Myself and I\\", \\"Naughty Girl\\" attained more immediate and commercial success than its predecessors, propelling the album onto the charts and helping it be certified as multi-platinum. \\"Naughty Girl\\" debuted at number 68 on the US Billboard Hot 100 issue dated March 27, 2004.

Live performances Beyonc√© performing \\"Naughty Girl\\" on alt=A group of people is performing on stage. They are playing many instruments, which include guitars, drums, a saxophone and keyboards. During the Verizon Ladies First Tour which also featured Alicia Keys, Missy Elliott and Tamia, Beyonc√© performed \\"Naughty Girl\\" as part of the concert's set list. Before starting to sing, she asked the audience: \\"Do I have any naughty girls in the house tonight? Her DJ yelled: \\"Do the A-Town stomp!\\" Beyonc√© then walked onto the stage with some female dancers. As she sang, more dancers appeared on smaller, circular platforms while fire shot from the floor and a long, rectangular screen merged video of flames with images of the performers. Beyonc√© then performed portions of Vanity 6's song \\"Nasty Girl\\" (1982) as a small dance break. The song was included on the set list of Beyonc√©'s Dangerously in Love World Tour that began in late 2003. During the tour, she appeared suspended from the ceiling of the arena and was lowered into a red lounger. The song was included on Beyonc√©'s set list on her concert tours The Beyonc√© Experience (2007) and I Am... Tour (2009-2010). It was featured on the live albums The Beyonc√© Experience Live (2007), and the deluxe edition of I Am... World Tour (2010) which contained performances from the tour. On August 5, 2007, Beyonc√© performed the song at the Madison Square Garden in Manhattan. Before starting to sing, she asked loudly for \\"all the naughty girls present\\" at the concert to respond, which they did \\"with enthusiasm\\". While singing, Beyonc√© was accompanied by her all-female band and she incorporated Donna Summer's \\"Love to Love You Baby\\" into \\"Naughty Girl\\". Jon Pareles of The New York Times complimented the performance, stating: \\"Beyonc√© needs no distractions from her singing, which can be airy or brassy, tearful or vicious, rapid-fire with staccato syllables or sustained in curlicued melismas. But she was in constant motion, strutting in costumes\\". Shaheem Reid of MTV News also praised the performance, writing: \\"For all the dancing she did, Beyonc√© got an equally big ‚Äî if not more resounding ‚Äî response for displaying her undeniable vocal ability\\". Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: \\"The largely uptempo show featured some surprising arrangements that gave the material freshness, such [...] an injection of 'Love to Love You Baby' into 'Naughty Girl'.\\" In Los Angeles, Beyonc√© gave a full-length performance of the song, dressed in a green belly dancing costume. She performed with several female backup dancers and live instrumentation. When Beyonc√© performed the song in Sunrise, Florida on June 29, 2009, she was wearing a glittery gold leotard. As she sang, animated graphics of turntables, faders and other club equipment were projected behind the dancers and musicians. Beyonc√© was accompanied by two drummers, two keyboardists, a percussionist, a horn section, three imposing backup vocalists called the Mamas and a lead guitarist, Bibi McGill. Beyonc√© performed the song at the Wynn Theatre in Las Vegas, Nevada on August 2, 2009 as part of her show revue I Am... Yours. The performance was recorded and distributed in a DVD/CD package titled I Am... Yours: An Intimate Performance at Wynn Las Vegas. Beyonc√© performed \\"Naughty Girl\\" live at the 2011 Glastonbury Festival on June 26, 2011. In May, 2012, Beyonc√© performed \\"Naughty Girl\\" during her Revel Presents: Beyonc√© Live revue at Revel Atlantic City. Before the performance of the song, one of the in-between films was shown, where of Beyonc√© said, \\"Harnessing the power of your body requires responsibility\\". Then, she appeared dressed in a feathered headdress. During the performance of the song, Beyonc√© performed it as a tribute to Donna Summer, singing her song \\"Love to Love You Baby\\". Maura Johnston of The Village Voice wrote that \\"the sinuous 'Naughty Girl' had its source material laid bare at the outset when a sample of the groans and coos from 'Love To Love You Baby' was laid over it\\". According to Spins Caryn Ganz, she was \\"breaking out fluffy feathered fans\\" during the performance of the song. Cover versions and usage in media \\"Naughty Girl\\" has been covered by several artists. Irish singer-songwriter Roesy produced a version of the song which appeared on the 2004 charity album Even Better Than the Real Thing Vol. 2. Richard Cheese and Lounge Against the Machine covered the song on their 2006 album Silent Nightclub. In January 2011, \\"Naughty Girl\\" was used in a commercial for L‚ÄôOreal Paris F√©ria hair color in which Beyonc√© bleached her hair blonde. Beyonc√© wears body-conforming outfits and whips her hair back and forth as she shows off \\"her luscious locks.\\" \\"Naughty Girl\\" was also used in the trailer for the 2004 comedy film \\"Mean Girls\\", starring Lindsay Lohan. This song appears in the video game Just Dance 2018. Track listing and formats *Europe Digital EP\\"iTunes Store ‚Äì Beyonc√© ‚Äì Naughty Girl ‚Äì EP\\". iTunes Store (Belgium). Apple Inc.

The town lies 13 km to the east of Panagyurishte and 41 km to the north of Pazardzhik and is part of Pazardzhik Province. It is situated in the southern skirts of the Sredna Gora mountain and huddles in a beautiful valley. The favourable microclimate, nature and mineral water springs, combined with the rich history and natural sights, have turned Strelcha into a national spa resort all around the year. Even if the town's tourism industry has decayed somewhat in the early post-communist period, its tourist product has started to revive in the last couple of years. Church of St Archangel Michael in Strelcha. The most important sight in the town is arguably the Bulgarian Orthodox Archangel Michael Church-Monument dedicated to the citizens of Strelcha that were killed during the April Uprising of 1876. Their names can be seen inscribed on both sides of the church. The rose gardens in Strelcha spread over 3,000 decares, as this is one of the biggest rose oil production regions in Bulgaria. Rose oil of the highest quality possible is produced in the municipality. Besides roses, since the 1990s and 2000s Strelcha successfully cultivated lavender, from which first-class essential oil is extracted. A thracian tomb near Strelcha. Outside Strelcha, the road to the town of Koprivshtitsa (24 km) has views of natural rock formations. Three kilometres to the southeast of Strelcha one can see the Zhaba Mogila (\\"Frog Mound\\") inside which archeologists have found a Thracian temple. The mound is one of the biggest in Bulgaria -- its height is more than 20 m, while its diameter is about 80‚Äì90 m. The two chambers and the fa√ßade are built of large, masterly carved stone blocks, connected with iron conjunctures and covered with lead. The biggest of these blocks measures 2.6 m by 0.6 m. Their arrangement is regarded as flawless. A tunnel with a length of 75 m has been dug below the mound and is planned to be transformed into a museum. A second stone construction, believed to have served as a sanctuary, has been found in the northwest part of the mound. It consists of three halls with a total area of 25 square metres. 2.5 km to the south of Strelcha one can see the remains of the Strelcha Fortress (Kaleto) believed to date back to the 9-10th century AD. The fortress was built on the right bank of the Luda Yana River on a separate hill. The fortress walls surrounded a rectangular space with a length of 140 m and a width of 50‚Äì60 m. Additionally, there are some preserved remains of several other fortresses to the south and southeast of Strelcha. Honours Strelcha Spur on Graham Land, Antarctica is named after the town.

After 1748, the mission was known as Nuestra Se√±ora del Pilar de la Paz. The mission was the first European settlement at the site of what is now the city of Todos Santos, Baja California Sur. The Santa Rosa Mission was located in one of the few areas of Baja California suitable for agriculture. The residents of the Mission were primarily Guaycura Native Americans (American Indians) whom the Jesuits and their successors, the Franciscans and Dominicans, attempted to convert to Christianity and to make into sedentary farm workers. Recurrent epidemics of introduced European diseases reduced the Indian population to only a handful by the 19th century and in 1825 the mission was closed. Foundation In 1724, Jesuit priest Jaime Bravo, stationed at the Misi√≥n de Nuestra Se√±ora del Pilar de La Paz Airap√≠ at present day La Paz, Baja California Sur, founded a visita (subsidiary post to a mission) at a place he named Todos Santos, which was near the Pacific Ocean. In the deserts of Baja California, Todos Santos was attractive because of a relative abundance of water, tillable land, and good grazing for livestock. The site was inhabited by Uchiti Indians, probably a band of the Guaycura people.Crosby, Harry W. (1994), Antigua California, Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, pp. 106-107 The visita became the mission of Santa Rosa in 1733 under Sigismundo Taraval. Agriculture at Santa Rosa was successful, but the area was contested between warring bands of the Guaycura, including the Uchiti and Pericues peoples. The Uchiti, in particular, were hostile to the mission and its Christian converts (neophytes). About 10 Spanish and a few dozen neophyte soldiers attempted to protect Santa Rosa, other missions in southern Baja California, the Jesuits, and the neophytes. In addition, the Indians living at or near the mission were impacted by recurrent epidemics of European diseases such as smallpox and measles. Syphilis, although known in America before the Europeans, was also a serious disease and may have been spread widely in Baja California by visiting or castaway Spanish and English sailors.Crosby, p. 111-112 Destruction The Mission Church, part of which dates to 1747. In 1734, the Pericue, the Uchiti, and some of the other Guaycura bands revolted in southern Baja California in an attempt to expel the Jesuits from their territory. The Indians killed Jesuits at two of the four southern missions, several Spanish soldiers, and, in January 1735, 13 sailors who had come ashore from a merchant vessel. The proximate cause of the rebellion was the Jesuit's attempt to outlaw polygamy. Taraval, a Jesuit at Santa Rosa mission, escaped. With assistance from a large Spanish and Indian military force sent from the mainland, the rebellion was mostly put down and the Todos Santos mission was reestablished in 1737 under Jesuit Bernardo Zumziel. The Uchiti, however, continued to resist until 1748. The war and epidemics in 1742, 1744, and 1748 depopulated the south and only scattered remnants of the former Indian population remained. The surviving Guaycura from southern Baja California were congregated at the Todos Santos Mission in 1748. There, the Jesuits forcibly detained the Guaycura children at the mission and their parents and relatives \\"for love of the children remained pacified.\\"Crosby, p. 316 A military force, independent of the Jesuits. was stationed at Todos Santos to keep the peace. The community of Spaniards, mestizos, and a diminishing number of Indians living at Todos Santos became more secular.Crosby pp. 114-124, 312, 315-316, 400; Arraj, James (2002), An Expedition to the Guaycura Nation in the Californias, http://www.innerexplorations.com/catsimple/exped2.htm, accessed 30 Mar 2016 In 1755, there were only 151 Guaycura remaining at the mission and the population continued to decline.Jackson, Robert H. (1986), \\"Patterns of Demographic Change in the Missions of Southern Baja California\\", Journal of California and Great Basin Anthropology, Vol. 8, No. 2, p. 276. Downloaded from JSTOR. Decline In 1768, the population of Indians at the Santa Rosa mission had fallen to 83 due to runaways and deaths from disease. With a need for agricultural labor to work on the mission's land, the Franciscans (who had recently taken charge from the Jesuits of the Baja California missions) moved 746 Guaycura from more northerly missions to Todos Santos. These Guaycura were still semi-nomadic, and not accustomed to living in a sedentary community. Less than a year later, 300 of the Guaycura died in an epidemic of measles. Others ran away from the mission or protested by destroying or stealing mission property. By 1771 only 170 Guaycura still lived at Todos Santos and by 1808 the number had further declined to 82. At that point, the Guaycura had become almost culturally extinct.Jackson, pp. 276-277 The mission was closed in 1825.Burckhalter, David, Sedgwick, Mina and Fontana, Bernard L.

Career Watters grew up in Rio Vista, California. At St. Joseph's military academy he belonged to the drum and bugle corps. In 1925 he moved with his family to San Francisco, where he started a jazz band. He taught himself how to arrange music and played trumpet on a cruise ship. He studied music at the University of San Francisco with help from a scholarship, but he dropped out of school to pursue a career. During the 1930s he went on tour across America with the Carol Lofner big band. While in New Orleans, he became interested in traditional jazz. Back in California, he assembled jam sessions with Bill Dart, Clancy Hayes, Bob Helm, Dick Lammi, Turk Murphy, and Wally Rose. In 1938 he formed a band that included Hayes, Helm, Squire Gersh, Bob Scobey, and Russell Bennett. The band found steady work at Sweet's Ballroom in Oakland, slipping in pieces of traditional New Orleans jazz into the repertoire until Watters was fired. In 1939 he started the Yerba Buena Jazz Band to revive the New Orleans jazz style of King Oliver. He brought in pianist Forrest Browne, who taught the band music by Jelly Roll Morton. Watters wrote music and arrangements to add to the traditional repertoire. The band performed at the Dawn Club in San Francisco. It went on hiatus in 1942 when Watters entered the U.S. Navy but reunited at the Dawn after World War II. After the Dawn closed, the band started the club Hambone Kelly's in El Cerrito, California. In 1949 the band performed with visiting musicians Kid Ory, James P. Johnson, and Mutt Carey. After Hambone Kelly's closed, the band broke up in 1950. Watters left music and became a carpenter, cook, and a student of geology. In 1963 he came out of retirement to perform with Murphy at an anti-nuclear protest in California to prevent a nuclear plant from being constructed at Bodega Bay. He recorded an album for Fantasy with Rose, Helm, Bob Mielke, and Barbara Dane. It included the title track and another song named for the San Andreas Fault, which was consistent with his interest in geology.Blues Over Bodega. Retrieved December 23, 2018.

Detail of the Achilles plate The stoup set The Seuso Treasure or Sevso Treasure (; ), is a hoard of silver objects (14 items) from the late Roman Empire. The first pieces appeared on the market in London in 1980, and the treasure was acquired by a consortium headed by Spencer Compton, 7th Marquess of Northampton. Documentation was provided in which it was stated that it had been found in the Tyre and Sidon regions of Lebanon. It was put up for sale in New York City in 1990 by Sotheby's, but was halted when the documentation was found to be false, and the governments of Hungary, Yugoslavia (now Croatia) and Lebanon made claims of ownership. The claims of ownership by these countries were rejected by a US court, and the treasure remained in the possession of the Marquess of Northampton. Scotland Yard still has an open case on the matter. The origin and provenance of the treasure are likely known, but not publicly acknowledged. There is much scientific evidence to indicate that the hoard was first acquired in the 1970s after the murder of a Hungarian soldier, who discovered the treasure during illicit digging at an established archaeological site in Hungary. On 26 March 2014 Prime Minister of Hungary Viktor Orb√°n announced that half of the Seuso Treasure (seven items) had been bought by Hungary. The Prime Minister described it as \\"Hungary's family silverware\\". In June 2017 the remaining seven artifacts also got back to Hungary, for a sum of ‚Ç¨28 million. Contents The treasure trove consists of 14 large decorated silver vessels and the copper cauldron which contained them, and has been dated to the late 4th or early 5th century AD. Most notable is a large dish, 70 cm in diameter and weighing nearly 9 kg, which bears the inscription: : Hec Sevso tibi durent per saecula multa : Posteris ut prosint vascula digna tuis : May these, O Seuso, yours for many ages be : Small vessels fit to serve your offspring worthily. Discovery J√≥zsef S√ºmegh, who is claimed to have found the treasure around 1975‚Äì76 near Polg√°rdiThe hoard first came to attention in 1980, when a single piece in the possession of two antiquities' dealers from Vienna was offered for sale in London. Further pieces reached the market, and what is believed to be the complete hoard was acquired by a consortium headed by Spencer Compton, 7th Marquess of Northampton.Antiques Trade Gazette , 30 September 2006. Documentation supplied by the Lebanese embassy in Switzerland stated that the treasure had originally been found in the Tyre and Sidon regions of Lebanon, and on that basis the consortium negotiated to sell the collection to the Getty Museum in Los Angeles for $10 million. When that deal fell through, the treasure was put up for sale in New York in 1990 by Sotheby's, described as being from \\"what was once the province of Phoenicia in the Eastern Roman Empire\\".  Legal wrangling  The sale was halted when documentation was thought to be false, and the governments of Hungary, Yugoslavia and Lebanon each made claims of ownership. Hungarian authorities claim that the treasure was discovered by a young soldier, J√≥zsef S√ºmegh, in around 1975‚Äì76 near the town of Polg√°rdi in central Hungary. S√ºmegh's dead body was found in a nearby cellar in 1980. The official investigation at the time determined that he had committed suicide, but later the police came to the conclusion that he had been killed. As of 2012 the criminal investigation is still ongoing. Yugoslavia's case was based on claims that the treasure had been originally found on 30 June 1960, in the village of Barbariga in Istria (present-day Croatia). The village is some 20 kilometres north of the city of Pula, an important city in Roman times. According to local witnesses, the treasure had been discovered in old trenches in a nearby Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) compound. In the 1980s the JNA gave permission to local archeologists, led by Vesna Girardi-Jurkiƒá, to further excavate the site. According to unconfirmed eyewitness reports of army excavations, the 14 known artefacts were only a small part of a much larger treasure trove as it took soldiers and police brought to the site six days to list all the items found at the site. However, very few details of the project were ever released to the public as the alleged site was entirely within a military area closed off to civilians. Yugoslav archaeologists' efforts eventually failed to provide any conclusive evidence for the treasure's origin, although the soil residue found on the artefacts was proved to match the samples of soil from the area. After the breakup of Yugoslavia the newly independent Croatia pressed on with the case and included the results of the soil analysis in its formal ownership claim to a New York court. The Hippolytus set In November 1993, the New York Court of Appeals rejected the claims, and found no case for removing it from the possession of the Marquess of Northampton 1987 Settlement (a trust established by the Marquess of Northampton).Republic of Croatia, et al. v. Trustee of the Marquess of Northampton 1987 Settlement, 203 A.D.2d 167, 610 N.Y.S.2d 263 (1994); Republic of Croatia, et al. v. Trustee of the Marquess of Northampton 1987 Settlement, 232 A.D.2d 616, 648 N.Y.S.2d 25 (1st Dep't 1996).) The silver was locked away in a bank vault while further legal proceedings followed. The Marquess sued his solicitors Allen & Overy for damages in relation to advice given during the purchase of the silver, and that case was settled out of court in 1999 for a reported ¬£15 million.The Times, 8 May 1999. On 25 June 1999, in written answers to questions in the House of Lords, the British government confirmed that it had no further interest in the case and confirmed the decision not to prosecute. The Hungarian claim of possession is likely justified by the fact that on one of the main plates, the \\"Hunting Plate\\", an inscription is to be seen. It reads \\"Pelso\\", the Roman name for Lake Balaton in Hungary; the lake is just west of the alleged place of discovery. Also near to the lake, in 1873 a Roman tripod (later restored, upon which it was discovered that it is a quadripod) was discovered; according to scholars, this object featured similar decoration as the Seuso Treasure items, and is very likely a creation of the same hands. It is housed in the Hungarian National Museum in Budapest. Later developments In September 2006, London auctioneer Bonhams announced that it would exhibit the treasure privately, in a move seen as a prelude to a sale by private treaty or by auction at a future date. A spokesman for the Ministry of Education and Culture of Hungary, which had still claimed it, said it had informed British authorities that it must not be sold.\\"Sevso Treasure Up For Sale\\" at culture.hu ‚Äì Hungarian Ministry of Education and Culture. On 12 October 2006, further written answers were given in the House of Lords to questions by Colin Renfrew, Baron Renfrew of Kaimsthorn, particularly relating to Hungary's possible revised claim to the treasure since its admission to the European Union in 2004.Hansard 12 October 2006 Bonhams went ahead with its private exhibition on 17 October 2006.Art Newspaper, Times and Guardian The \\"Hunting plate\\" in the Hungarian Parliament Building In March 2007, The Art Newspaper reported that a further \\"187 silvergilt spoons, 37 silvergilt drinking cups, and 5 silver bowls\\", previously unknown, but part of the original hoard, were reputed to exist. Research presented in February 2008 by the Hungarian archaeologist Zsolt Visy strengthened the view that the origin of the treasure may be the Lake Balaton region of Hungary. The Channel 4 archaeology programme Time Team aired a special on the treasure in December 2008. The programme presented Hungary's evidence for the likely origin of the hoard being near the town of Polg√°rdi. The Marquess of Northampton withdrew from planned participation in the programme and Channel 4 was not given permission to film the treasure, held in a vault at Bonhams auctioneers in London. Return to Hungary On 26 March 2014, Viktor Orb√°n, the Hungarian prime minister, announced that half of the Seuso Treasure (seven items) had been returned to Hungary, for a sum of ‚Ç¨15 million. The seven artifacts were put on temporary display at the Hungarian Parliament Building on 29 March 2014. On 12 July 2017, the Hungarian PM announced that another seven pieces had been brought back to Hungary, and will be displayed together with the seven items returned to Hungary in 2014. The items will be moved to the Budapest Museum of Fine Arts by 2018, where they are intended to be a centrepiece of the new museum's quarter.

OC-SNP holds chapters in nearly 20 post-secondary institutions across the country, which organize a variety of initiatives, including journal clubs, conferences, guest lectures, public outreach events, fundraisers, and physical activity/challenge events (National Pedometer Challenge). Affiliate organizations The Fund for Obesity Collaboration and Unified Strategies (FOCUS) initiative was launched by Obesity Canada, formerly known as the Canadian Obesity Network, with the goal of leveraging resources and expertise from Canadian leaders in research, business and the public sector to raise a minimum of $1.5 million annually toward funding research, education, and outreach initiatives. Obesity Canada‚Äôs everyBODY Matters Collaborative is a multi-disciplinary partnership of weight bias and obesity stigma researchers. The goal of the collaborative is to raise awareness of the existence of weight bias and stigma in Canada, along with promoting behaviour, practice and policy change among stakeholders. Membership is open to anyone with an interest or expertise in weight bias and obesity stigma. Its related initiatives include the Canadian Weight Bias Summits; systematic review of weight bias reduction interventions among health professionals; engaging education theory related to anti-discrimination work and health-related stigmas; and developing weight bias reduction interventions in Canada. Past initiatives and current resources Obesity Canada has created a number of tools and resources. Those intended for health care providers include: Obesity Canada also created tools for use by members of the public. These include: Conferences and events hosted by Obesity Canada Canadian Obesity Summit Obesity Canada has hosted the Canadian Obesity Summit biannually since 2009. It is Canada‚Äôs only multidisciplinary all-obesity research and networking conference. It includes dedicated tracts for health practitioners and workshops organized by groups working in obesity. Each conference begins and ends with the Canadian Obesity Summit Awards, recognizing and acknowledging both emerging and professional Canadian researchers whose work focuses on obesity and related comorbidities. The first Summit was held from May 7‚Äì10, 2009 at the Delta Lodge in Kananaskis, Alberta. The event attracted nearly 500 delegates from research, health practice, and public policy. The summit focused on research and health practice in the areas of obesity and mental health; behavioural and biological determinants of obesity; obesity management; and health economics and public policy. The second Summit was held in Montreal, Quebec in April 2011. Over 300 original presentations by Canadian researchers were made, along with several 'mini-review' sessions by experts on a variety of topics, including maternal and fetal origins; healthy policy and economics; prevention and treatment across the lifespan; pain and musculoskeletal conditions; bariatric interventions; and cancer and inflammation. Notable attendees include Dr. Yves Bolduc, then-Quebec Minister for Health and Social Services. The third Summit was held at the Westin Bayshore in Vancouver, British Columbia on May 1-4, 2013, and saw over 850 attendees. Delegates included physicians, clinical teams, researchers, industry leaders, and policy makers from federal, provincial, and territorial governments. The program included 70 workshops, hundreds of presentations, accredited courses, pre- and post-conference workshops, plenary, concurrent and poster sessions, awards ceremonies, industry exhibits, and networking events. Primary themes included childhood obesity, bariatric surgery, public health, clinical management, energy regulation, and health policy.

The seventh Summit will take place in Whistler, British Columbia, on April 20-22, 2021. Weight Bias Summit The purpose of the Weight Bias Summits is for individuals living with obesity, researchers studying weight bias, health professionals and knowledge translation experts to share best practices and generate key messages and strategies to reduce weight bias. Ultimately, the goal of these 2-day summits is for participants is to be better able to evaluate the impact of these efforts locally, provincially and nationally. The results of each workshop are used in future collaborative actions (e.g. research grants, knowledge translation initiatives to the public, health professionals, and policy makers) to reduce weight bias and obesity stigma in Canada. Annual Learning Retreat for Health Care Professionals (formerly for Dietitians) The Learning Retreat for Dietitians is co-hosted by Obesity Canada and the Dietitians of Canada. Topics covered include the 5As of Obesity Management; the Edmonton Obesity Staging System; the dietitian‚Äôs role as part of an interdisciplinary obesity management team; and the clinical assessment and medical management of obesity. The second Retreat was in Guelph, Ontario from January 19-23, 2011. The third Retreat took place in Halifax, Nova Scotia from October 31 to November 2, 2012.

This annual event is the longest-running transgender conference in the United States and it provides a week for attendees to experiment with gender-role identities and presentations in a safe and affirming community. The goal of the conference is to create a safe space in which crossdressers, transgender and transsexual people, and nonbinary-gendered people are accepted without judgement, can interact with their peers, and can advocate for their rights. In November, 1980 the event was featured in an article by D. Keith Mano in Playboy magazine and has in ensuing years has continued to generate publicity. At its inception in 1975, Fantasia Fair was ten days long and considered an event for heterosexual cross-dressers. Most of the programs focused on personal presentation, and the registration fee, which included housing, was expensive. By the 1990s, however, the nature of the attendees had more diverse, including trans men and trans women, cross-dressers, and genderqueer people of every sexual orientation. Fantasia Fair's parent organization was the Outreach Institute for Gender Studies (originally the Human Outreach and Achievement Institute), founded in 1975. Since 2000 the parent organization has been Real Life Experiences, a nonprofit corporation which makes annual awards to transgender pioneers at a banquet held during the Fair. Many Fantasia Fair events are open to the public for free or at low cost. These include six daily keynote addresses, a dinner with entertainment, and the Fantasia Fair Fashion and Follies shows. A number of scholarships are awarded annually. Many documents regarding Fantasia Fair, from its inception until current day, are archived in the Rikki Swin Collection in the University of Victoria Transgender Archives, in the Joseph A. Labadie Collection at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, and online at the Digital Transgender Archive.  Partners, Professionals and Allies  Fantasia Fair has always emphasized and supported the spouses, family members, and allies of transgender and other gender nonconforming people and considered them full partners in the event. Discounts have routinely been given to spouses and every year one or more helping professionals work with trans families, holding workshops in a program track specifically for those in relationships with trans and gender nonbinary people. Fantasia Fair has always attracted and welcomed helping professionals, many of whom attend for many years. Many of the trans attendees are themselves helping professionals and bring specialized knowledge to the event. Professionals include speech and voice therapists, psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, surgeons, academics in a variety of disciplines, and gender theorists.  Events  Fantasia Fair offers \\"a myriad of events and activities\\" Rikki Swin 10.16 Uvic Transgender Archives including luncheons, award banquets, daily keynote addresses, and a wealth of workshops on topics including dance, gender change, identity, community building, legal and medical issues, and pronoun usage. Workshops on cosmetics and consultations on hair, makeup, clothing, voice, and gender confirmation surgeries are offered for those who desire them. There is an evening fashion show and a Fantasia Fair Follies talent show, and opportunities for nightlife and outings like whale watching, dunes tours, and history walks. The Unitarian Universalist Meeting House of Provincetown holds a special trans-inclusive service on the last day of Fantasia Fair. Conference attendees are encouraged to participate in as many activities as possible, but are under no obligation to attend all, or any of the offered events. Many of the events take place in the Crown and Anchor restaurant, bar, and nightclub, but Fantasia Fair encompasses the entire town. Attendees stay in a variety of small inns and bed & breakfast establishments and many rent apartments or houses. Workshops and lunches are held in a variety of locations.  Promotion  In its early years, promotion of Fantasia Fair was, at times, difficult, due to the discriminatory attitude and laws surrounding transsexualism, transvestism, and transgenderism. Promotion was carried out in a number of ways: flyers were sent out, usually in the February before the Fair, which is held in October. Brochures were made available and mailed to homes of past participants, and newsletters were mailed out in April, June, and September. Ads and articles were posted in several publications. Fantasia Fair staff members spoke about the event in their addresses, lectures, and speaking engagements. Orientation lectures and meetings were also used for promotion. There were correspondence periods via mail during the reservation, inquiry, and registration periods, in which participants and potential participants could ask staff members questions. There was also a central bulletin board and message center. During the Fair, advertisements were posted in convenient locations throughout Provincetown. Lastly, one of the most important tools for communication and promotion was word of mouth, including conversations involving facts, rumors, and opinions about the Fair between participants.University of Victoria Trans Archives Rikki Swin Collection 7.24 Today, the Fantasia Fair maintains a website and a presence on social media. Brochures are distributed throughout the year. A colorful program book is issued to participants upon arrival, and a daily newsletter tracks last-minute changes to the complex schedule.  Accommodations  In its earliest years, Fantasia Fair offered a choice of accommodation from three options: a motel close to the beach, a larger hotel, or small apartments. Accommodation was assigned on a first-come, first-served basis, and prices varied depending on choice of facility. The Boatslip Motor Inn was a motel located close to the beach, and west of Provincetown's downtown. It offered single rooms and an \\"excellent view of ocean scenery.\\" The Crown and Anchor Motor Inn was a larger hotel in which many of the Fair's events took place. It's located in the downtown area on Commercial Street. The Crown and Anchor offered single, double rooms, and suites, all with private bath, as well as several facilities on-site such as a restaurant, a lounge, a dance club, and several small shops. The small apartments were in the Hargood Apartments, whicher were also located in the downtown area. Couples could book an apartment for a reduced rate. All apartments included a kitchenette, a separate bedroom, and a private bath.University of Victoria Trans Archives Rikki Swin Collection 7.23 Today Fantasia Fair utilizes a number of restaurants and inns and attendees stay in a variety of inns or rent houses or apartments for their week in Provincetown. The banquets and keynotes are held at the Crown and Anchor.  History   1975  Fantasia Fair was founded by individuals such as Betsy Shaw, Ari Kane, Betty Ann Lind, and Linda Franklin, as well as other members of The Cherrystones, a transgender support group based out of Boston. The notion of a transgender conference stemmed from the founders' firm belief that there was a need for trans people of all sorts to learn about themselves, in order to feel less isolated in society because of their gender identity. Once Provincetown was selected as the official location of Fantasia Fair, the founders worked with female impersonators from the Massachusetts town, a few Cape Cod doctors, and some cosmetics consultants in order to establish the first Fantasia Fair. There were approximately 40 participants in the first year.  1976  The annual Fantasia Fair took place from October 15 to October 24 in 1976. Coordinated by Ari Kane, the 2nd annual Fair offered many events. These included fashion and beauty courses, the Ages of Fashion Ball, an awards banquet, a film festival, a fashion show, the Foundation Boutique, a volleyball game, and exhibits and displays. In addition to these events, the 1976 conference was the first to offer a course specifically for the wives and girlfriends of transgender and transsexual participants in the Fair. These seminars were for the purpose of fostering healthy relationships between partners, and for the growth of understanding and support. The 1976 Fair was also the first to offer job opportunities as \\"Femmes in Provincetown,\\" at frequent requests of participants.Rikki Swin UVic Transgender Archives  1977  The 3rd annual Fantasia Fair took place from October 15 to 23 in 1977. Each event began at 9:30 every morning and lasted for an hour. Any demonstration was an additional $35 on top of the original fee. The coordinator for the 1977 Fair was Nancy Ledins. Registration for the 9-day-long event started at 2:00 pm on Friday the 15th. Approximately 100 individuals took part in the 1977 Fantasia Fair, and around two-thirds of them stayed for the entire nine-day period. The events in 1977 were similar to those of the 1976 Fantasia Fair. The Fashion Beauty course was offered every morning of the Fair. Paula Nielson was the coordinator of the Fashion and Beauty segment of the Fair. The body movement courses included assistance on the improvement of \\"femme comportment\\" in walking, talking, sitting, dining, and dancing. On the last Friday of the Fair, a potluck dinner in the Unitarian Church following a symposium on transgenderism and the trans community. In the annual awards ceremony, awards given included best in Congeniality, Best Dressed, and the Cinderella Award. New awards were included as well, including Miss Femininity and Miss Fantasia Fair.  1978  The 4th annual Fantasia Fair took place from October 13 to the 22nd. The coordinator of the 1978 Fantasia Fair was Nancy Ledins. Virginia Prince considered attending the Fair in 1978, and was a frequent attendee in later years.  1999  The dates of the 25th Silver Jubilee Fantasia Fair were October 17 through 24. The Angela Ochoa Best-Dressed and Femininity awards were retired.  2001  At the conclusion of Fantasia Fair 2000, stewardship of Fantasia Fair was transferred from the nonprofit Outreach Institute for Gender Studies to the nonprofit Real Life Experiences. Special events in 2001 included a screening of the film Southern Comfort, an art gallery walk, and high tea and a photo exhibit by Mariette Pathy Allen at the Provincetown Art Association Museum. The dates of the 2001 Fantasia Fair were October 14‚Äì21. Dallas Denny was Fair Director.  2002  Fantasia Fair 2001 began on October 20 and ended on October 27 and saw the first Transgender Pioneer awards banquet. Pioneer awards were given to Virginia Prince and Merissa Sherrill Lynn for their decades of work on behalf of the transgender community. Dallas Denny was again Fair Director.  2004  Program Director Miqqi Alicia Gilbert used six keynote slots to create The Trans-Progressive Symposium. Symposium speakers were Susan Stryker, Dallas Denny, Miqqi Alicia Gilbert, Jamison Green, and Miilton Diamond. Keynote presentations were open to the public. On Monday night there was a preview of Stryker's film Screaming Queens: The Riot at Compton's Cafeteria. Dates for the 2004 Fantasia Fair were October 17 through October 24.  2008  The dates of Fantasia Fair 2008 were October 19 through October 26. The Femininity Award was retired.  2015  The 41st annual Fantasia Fair was held from October 18, 2015 to October 25, 2015. The coordinator was Barbara Curry, with help from past Fair directors. Many events remain the same as they were in 1975, such as Awards Banquet, now called The Virginia Prince Transgender Pioneer Awards Banquet, the film festival, the fashion show, as well as the Ball, and the Gala Awards Banquet. The seminars, workshops, and talks have evolved a lot since 1975. Many of the talks and workshops addressed issues surrounding the politics of transgender people, such as hate crimes by the federal government about trans people, self-defense courses, and the issue of gendered washrooms as well as the medical aspect of transition such as workshops addressing the biopsychology of trans people, hormone management, gender change surgical options, post-surgery realities, and hair removal education. Many traditional-style workshops still were offered as well, such as seminars addressing wig styling, feminizing the voice, and makeup and image consultations. Fantasia Fair Directors have included Nancy Ledins, Ariadne Kane, Betty Ann Lind, Alison Laing, Dottie Laing, Pamela Geddes, Dallas Denny, Miqqi Alicia Gilbert, Barbara Curry, and Jamie Dailey. Dee LaValle was named Fair Director in 2018.  The Human Outreach and Achievement Institute  The Human Outreach and Achievement Institute was established in 1975 in Boston as a way to increase awareness and participation in the Fantasia Fair conference, as well as to function as a support and information centre for members of the Trans Community. The main goal of the nonprofit institute is to develop and foster understanding of human sexuality, in order to combat ignorance and misinformation.University of Victoria Rikki Swin Collection, 7.4 Ariadne Kane both founded the institute with help from other individuals such as Sandy Mesics, and directed it for a number of years. The Human Outreach and Achievement Institute helped to develop several programs to achieve their goal of education and training for professionals. These programs included conferences, informational seminars, and workshops. The programs were directed at people from relevant professions in fields such as education, guidance and counseling, therapy, law, law enforcement, nursing, and human services. The Outreach Institute also offered special programs surrounding gender issues and androgyny. Many of the programs are directed at communities of crossdressers, transsexuals, and androgyns. In addition to these programs, the Human Outreach and Achievement Institute published books and pamphlets with information regarding masculinity, transvestism, socio-cultural contexts of crossdressing, and abstracts of symposiums on gender studies and other issues. The first training session for professionals occurred in March 1977. The institute received correspondence from all over the United States, as well as Canada.Rikki Swin 10.03 UVic Transgender Archives The Institute also sent out newsletters called Swan which included editorials, letters to the editor, book recommendations, and shopping recommendations specifically for the safety and comfort of trans people. There were also sections on Trans community news, politics, interviews, calls to assist in the Outreach program, as well as special offers and deals specifically for people in the trans community.  Real Life Experiences  Real Life Experiences is a nonprofit 401(c)(4) corporation which was founded in 2000 to serve as the parent nonprofit for Fantasia Fair.

Built in neogothic style at the end of the XIXe century it is the most important center of marian pilgrimage in Flanders. In 1873 the Marquise of Courtebourne-de N√©donchel had a Lourdes grotto built in the gardens of her ch√¢teau at Slotendries. People from Ghent and other nearby locations asked to be allowed to visit the grotto and pray there, and it was claimed that in 1875 Pieter De Rudder was miraculously healed of a compound fracture. To accommodate the resulting increase in the number of pilgrims, a neo-Gothic church based on plans by E. Van Hoecke- Peeters (slightly modified by J. B. Bethune) was completed in 1876 and consecrated in 1877. It was entrusted to the Jesuits, to which the Marquis's late son had belonged. In one of the towers there is a carillon made up of 49 bells, cast by the Michiels Foundries in the 1950s. The keyboard was temporarily removed during renovation works in the 1970s but has not yet been replaced to this date.

The title of the festival is a matter of confusion for many, especially those outside Huntsville, as the Big Spring Jam was held early each autumn. The title, however, came from the location, Big Spring International Park in downtown Huntsville. Big Spring Jam usually featured four or more temporary stages set up throughout the park. Each stage typically featured the same genres of music throughout the weekend. One stage featured country music exclusively, another featured Christian contemporary, and the remainder of the stages were rock- based. To alleviate the impact of inclement weather, in 2011 the country music stage was moved indoors to the Propst Arena in the Von Braun Center. Unlike most other large-scale music festivals, Big Spring Jam was a not-for-profit event, organized each year by the Huntsville Heritage Foundation in conjunction with the Von Braun Center. Proceeds from the event benefited local charities, health and human services agencies, and arts and entertainment organizations throughout North Alabama. In recent years, the Big Spring Jam suffered a tarnished reputation due to weather events. In both 2005, and 2006, some of the main acts were canceled due to inclement weather. Despite existing as a non-profit event, Big Spring Jam officials refused to refund ticket prices after canceling events. For example, tickets were sold after the event was rained out in 2006 - and officials refused to refund the ticket prices. Tickets were sold up until the point the event was canceled. However, the 2007 and 2008 events, where the weather was favorable, were deemed highly successful. The 2010 event was cancelled due to financial and logistical issues but the event returned, as promised, in 2011. The 2011 Big Spring Jam was a smaller, two-day event with some acts moved into the Propst Arena at the Von Braun Center. The 2011 event drew only 30,000 attendees, down sharply from the 240,000 who attended in 2003, with blame placed on the smaller scope of the event, competition from high school and college football, the economic downturn, and weather on the Jam's first day. Organizers announced in November 2011 that they would \\"shelve\\" the event for the immediate future with plans to \\"retool\\" or \\"recreate\\" it at some point when the economy improves and local interest increases.

Found on his album That Was the Year That Was, the song is a satire of the then-contemporary educational concept of New Math. Composition The song is composed in the key of C major in a 2/4 time signature. It correctly describes the step-by- step process for subtracting 173 from 342 in decimal and then subtracting the numbers 1738 and 3428 having the same digits in octal. The song features a spoken-word intro by Lehrer, followed by \\"piano played at a quick tempo and brisk lines\\". Context Lehrer, at the time a doctoral student of mathematics at Harvard University, used the song to satirize the then-new educational concept of New Math, introduced in American schools in the late 1950s and early 1960s as an attempt to reform education of mathematics. According to the book The New Math: A Political History, the song \\"purported to be a lesson for parents confused by recent changes in their children's arithmetic textbook\\". The same book states that by the time of the song's release in 1965, the concept was at its peak in American education. Lehrer's song has been described as \\"well-informed and literate ... enjoyed by new math proponents and critics alike\\". Historian Christopher J. Phillips writes that, by including this song among other songs of great political and social import on That Was the Year That Was, Lehrer \\"seamlessly‚Äîand accurately‚Äîplaced the new math among the major events of the mid-twentieth-century United States\\".

There are two distinct, but closely related, notions of bundle map, depending on whether the fiber bundles in question have a common base space. There are also several variations on the basic theme, depending on precisely which category of fiber bundles is under consideration. In the first three sections, we will consider general fiber bundles in the category of topological spaces. Then in the fourth section, some other examples will be given. Bundle maps over a common base Let œÄE:E‚Üí M and œÄF:F‚Üí M be fiber bundles over a space M. Then a bundle map from E to F over M is a continuous map \\\\varphi : E \\\\to F such that \\\\pi_F\\\\circ\\\\varphi = \\\\pi_E . That is, the diagram center should commute. Equivalently, for any point x in M, \\\\varphi maps the fiber Ex = œÄE‚àí1({x}) of E over x to the fiber Fx = œÄF‚àí1({x}) of F over x. General morphisms of fiber bundles Let œÄE:E‚Üí M and œÄF:F‚Üí N be fiber bundles over spaces M and N respectively. Then a continuous map \\\\varphi : E \\\\to F is called a bundle map from E to F if there is a continuous map f:M‚Üí N such that the diagram center commutes, that is, \\\\pi_F\\\\circ\\\\varphi = f\\\\circ\\\\pi_E . In other words, \\\\varphi is fiber-preserving, and f is the induced map on the space of fibers of E: since œÄE is surjective, f is uniquely determined by \\\\varphi. For a given f, such a bundle map \\\\varphi is said to be a bundle map covering f. Relation between the two notions It follows immediately from the definitions that a bundle map over M (in the first sense) is the same thing as a bundle map covering the identity map of M. Conversely, general bundle maps can be reduced to bundle maps over a fixed base space using the notion of a pullback bundle. If œÄF:F‚Üí N is a fiber bundle over N and f:M‚Üí N is a continuous map, then the pullback of F by f is a fiber bundle f*F over M whose fiber over x is given by (f*F)x = Ff(x). It then follows that a bundle map from E to F covering f is the same thing as a bundle map from E to f*F over M. Variants and generalizations There are two kinds of variation of the general notion of a bundle map. First, one can consider fiber bundles in a different category of spaces. This leads, for example, to the notion of a smooth bundle map between smooth fiber bundles over a smooth manifold. Second, one can consider fiber bundles with extra structure in their fibers, and restrict attention to bundle maps which preserve this structure. This leads, for example, to the notion of a (vector) bundle homomorphism between vector bundles, in which the fibers are vector spaces, and a bundle map œÜ is required to be a linear map on each fiber. In this case, such a bundle map œÜ (covering f) may also be viewed as a section of the vector bundle Hom(E,f*F) over M, whose fiber over x is the vector space Hom(Ex,Ff(x)) (also denoted L(Ex,Ff(x))) of linear maps from Ex to Ff(x).

Designed in collaboration with Pan American Airways for use by their pilots and navigators, it was launched in 1954.Brozek, John (2002), The Rolex Report. St. Petersburg, FLA: InfoQuest Publishing History The Rolex GMT-Master wristwatch was originally designed in collaboration with Pan American Airways and issued by the airline to their crews on long-haul flights. (\\"GMT\\" in the name stands for Greenwich Mean Time also known as Coordinated Universal Time). The original GMT Master watch has a 24-hour display fourth hand complication directly linked to and displaying the same time zone as the standard 12-hour hand. This GMT hand enabled the crews to set the watch to GMT or another time zone, and, using the rotatable 24-hour scale bezel, set to the correct offset, a second time zone could be read. GMT or UTC is the time zone that is required for all aviation planning, weather forecasts, schedules and other paperwork. Picture of the model 16710, K-serial (model year 2003) In the early 1980s the Rolex GMT-Master II was released (although production of the original version continued alongside it until the late 1990s). Although the watch looks almost identical it uses a movement that has the additional capability of an independently adjustable quickset hour hand that can be adjusted to local time without stopping the seconds or disturbing the minutes and 24 hour GMT hand. As the watch continues to feature the rotatable bezel it is able to quickly compute any third time zone reference. Although the original Rolex GMT Master was available only in stainless steel, as it was conceived as a functional work watch, Rolex has been making luxury versions in both mixed steel and gold, and all-gold since the 1950s, and there are even exotic variations that incorporate elaborate designs that include precious stones. 50th anniversary edition An updated Rolex GMT Master II was released in 2005. This new model features a number of technical changes, such as Rolex's patented Parachrom hairspring as well as a larger Triplock crown (from the diver's watches). The new model also has several cosmetic changes, such as larger case, hands and hour markers and also a new bezel made using an extremely hard ceramic material that is designed to be more scratch and fade resistant. Also included in the update is a new and more luxurious style of bracelet that has heavier solid links and a machined clasp. The stainless steel version now joins the precious metal versions by having highly polished centre links on its bracelet.https://www.scmp.com/magazines/style/watches/article/2141918/all-you- need-know-about-iconic-rolex-pepsi-gmt-master-ii Ceramic bezel models In 2007, Rolex introduced the ceramic bezel insert to the GMT-Master II range, replacing the aluminum insert (colors created using an anodizing process) that had been used since 1959. While ceramic is much more scratch resistant than aluminum, Rolex initially could not continue to produce the two-color bezel used to distinguish between the day and night times of the second time zone, particularly the color red which could not be created satisfactorily in ceramic. In 2013, Rolex created the first two-tone ceramic bezel, in blue and black, for the steel GMT-Master II nicknamed ‚ÄúBatman‚Äù. The blue and black bezel is made of Cerachrom, Rolex's patented version of ceramic; it is produced through a patented process of creating two colors out of a mono-block Cerachrom bezel.https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/hands-on-with-the-rolex-gmt- master-ii-reference-116710blnr-with-blue-and-black-cerachom-bezel-live-p In 2014, Rolex was able to create the red color on the ceramic bezel for the new incarnation of the red-and-blue \\"Pepsi\\", although in order to recoup the higher cost of this bezel it was only initially available on the white gold GMT-Master II. All of these GMT-Master II watches use the Caliber 3186 movement.https://www.watchtime.com/featured/rolex-pepsi-review-gmt-master-ii/ In 2018, Rolex would issue the red-and-blue \\"Pepsi\\" on a new steel GMT-Master II, which also has a Jubilee bracelet in lieu of the Oyster bracelet, and it will continue to be sold alongside the older white gold \\"Pepsi\\" watch. Two more GMT-Master II models were also introduced, one in red Everose gold and in steel, and another in Everose gold, both with a two-tone brown and black bezel giving them the nickname \\"Root Beer\\". These new GMT-Master IIs released in 2018 all use the new Caliber 3285 movement which adds Paraflex shock absorber and a 70-hour power reserve (instead of 48 hours) over the Caliber 3186.https://www.watchtime.com/featured/rolex-pepsi-review-gmt-master- ii/https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/the-rolex-everose-gmt-master-ii-vs-the- gmt-master-ii-in-oystersteel-and-everose-gold In 2019, Rolex issued a new version of the Batman, and discontinued the older version.

He was the cofounder, together with Liviu Constantinescu, of the Romanian school of geophysics. Biography Sabba S. ≈ûtefƒÉnescu He was the third and youngest son of Sabba »òtefƒÉnescu, professor of paleontology at the University of Bucharest, and of his wife Constan≈£a. He received at first a private education, then visited for a couple of years the college St Sava in Bucharest, but left the country together with his family in 1917 for Paris, where his father had to accomplish a diplomatic mission. He obtained there his baccalaur√©at at the Lyc√©e Saint-Louis and was admitted as a student at the prestigious √âcole des Mines, from which he graduated in 1923. He returned subsequently to Romania, where he worked for some time in the mining district of the Jiu Valley. In 1927 he joined the Geological Institute of Romania, where he began his studies in electrical prospecting, which was to remain his lifelong preoccupation. Two short papers of his drew the attention of the brothers Conrad and Marcel Schlumberger. They were at that time the pioneers of this field in Europe and had just founded the geophysical prospecting company bearing their name, which has developed since into the world leading Schlumberger Limited. ≈ûtefƒÉnescu entered into a direct collaboration with them and spent the years 1929-1933 in Paris, a period which he considered to be the most fruitful of his scientific life. He returned to Romania in 1933 and resumed his work at the Geological Institute, being at the same time a consulting engineer of the Schlumberger company. He received a doctor's degree in physics from the University of Bucharest (1945), was elected a corresponding member of the Romanian Academy (1946) and became head of the geophysical department of the Geological Committee (1950) and of a new Department of Geophysics at the Institute for Mining in Bucharest (subsequently transferred to the Institute for Oil, Gas and Geology); he retained these positions until his retirement in 1967. One may say that over that period the first generations of Romanian geophysicists were formed; he made an essential contribution to this. He was elected a full member of the Romanian Academy (1963) and president of its Section of Geological, Geophysical and Geographical Sciences (1966-1990). He was the director of several institutes of geophysics belonging to the Romanian Academy or to the Geological Committee, and was (until 1990) editor of the journal Revue roumaine de g√©ologie, g√©ophysique et g√©ographie and president of the Romanian National Committee of Geodesy and Geophysics. He received in 1990 the honorary membership of the Society of Exploration Geophysicists ‚Äúfor developing the theoretical basis for several methods now in common use‚Äù. The midpoint of his scientific activity was the theory of electrical prospecting in geophysics. He was one of the first to perform a complete calculation in a realistic context (1930) of the electromagnetic field generated by a prospecting device and thus of the apparent resistivity of the ground. A series of subsequent papers (1930-1950) offered a detailed analysis of the usual DC and AC electrical prospecting methods. Later on he developed the theory of alpha media which allows an easy calculation of the electric field within a large family of models for the conductivity of the ground and facilitates the interpretation of the measured data. Another problem originating in electrical prospecting and to which he devoted for a long time his mathematical abilities was the determination of the magnetic field lines for various configurations of currents. He developed a special geometrical intuition which allowed him to integrate the complicated differential equations of the field lines of linear currents with increasingly complex arrangements. In this context he could produce explicit examples of open magnetic field lines. To those who knew him, he was an amiable and reserved person, with a pleasant and distinguished conversation. He regarded an optimistic attitude of mind as a duty and conveyed his serene outlook to those surrounding him. He had a steady and intense curiosity in intellectual matters, including philosophy and arts. The clarity of his scientific discourse was impressive.

The film was written and directed by Amy J. Berg, won the Best Documentary Award at the 2006 Los Angeles Film Festival, and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature, losing to An Inconvenient Truth. The title refers to a line in the Lord's Prayer. Synopsis The film chronicles O'Grady's years as a priest in Northern California, where he committed his crimes. After being convicted of child molestation and serving seven years in prison, O'Grady was deported to his native Ireland. Berg interviewed him there in 2005 for the film. Additionally, the film presents trial documents, videotaped depositions, and interviews with activists, theologians, psychologists, and lawyers; it suggests that Church officials were aware of O'Grady's crimes, and they took steps to conceal them to protect him and the church. Reception The Irish Independent criticized Berg for having filmed children in Ireland without the knowledge of them or their families. The film was very well received by critics, earning a 100 percent \\"Fresh\\" critics rating from Rotten Tomatoes based on 72 reviews, with a weighted average of 8.36/10. The site's consensus reads: \\"Deliver Us from Evil is a superb documentary and a searing look at an institution protecting its leaders at the expense of its followers. A profoundly disturbing chronicle of a wolf in sheep's clothing, the film builds a clear-eyed case against pedophile priest Oliver O'Grady, and the Catholic bureaucracy that protected him. The recollections of O'Grady's victims are nothing short of shocking and heartbreaking\\". It is currently ranked 31st among the site's highest rated documentaries of all time. Aftermath After the documentary was shown on Dutch national TV in April 2010, members of a parish in Schiedam recognized O'Grady as having been an active volunteer in the parish until January 2010. They had known nothing about his background. He had also been active in the Netherlands as an organizer of children's parties.

He served as Indonesia's Minister of Foreign Affairs between 1947 and 1949. Early life Agus Salim was born Masjhoedoelhaq Salim on October 8, 1884, in the village of Koto Gadang, a suburb of Fort de Kock. His father, Sutan Mohammad Salim, was a colonial prosecutor and judge whose highest rank was chief judge for the indigenous court in Tanjung Pinang. His birth name, which translates into \\"defender of truth\\", was changed into Agus Salim early in his childhood. Salim received his elementary education at Europeesche Lagere School; at that time, it was considered a privilege for a non-European child to attend an all-European school. He continued his studies at the Hogere Burgerschool in Batavia, and graduated with the highest score in the whole Dutch East Indies. Salim's father had applied (and was granted) for his two sons, Agus and Jacob, to be granted equal status with the Europeans. However, his efforts to secure a government scholarship to study medicine in the Netherlands fell short. Kartini, another European-educated student whose writings on women's rights and emancipation became famous later, offered to defer her own scholarship for Salim; this, too, was rejected. C.S. Hurgronje, a prominent colonial administrator best known for his study of native affairs, took Salim under his wing and arranged for him to leave the Indies in 1905 to work as an interpreter and secretary at the Dutch consulate in Jeddah, where he handled hajj affairs; in some way, it was to distance him from the radical teachings of a close relative, the well-known Shafi'i imam of Masjid al-Haram Ahmad Khatib al-Minangkabawi. Salim returned to the Indies in 1911 and pursued a career in journalism, contributing pieces for magazines and publications like Hindia Baroe, Fadjar Asia, and Moestika. He would later serve as an editor in Neratja, a newspaper aligned with the Sarekat Islam, where he was also an active member. While in that, he founded a private Hollandsche Indische School in his hometown of Koto Gadang, but left after three years to return to Java.  Political activism  Salim became one of the most vocal advocates of the growing Indonesian nationalist movement, in the period known as the national awakening. He became a prominent leader in the Sarekat Islam and was considered a right-hand man of its leader, Oemar Said Tjokroaminoto. The SI contained many political strains, including communists, business leaders and Islamically-minded reformers. Having spent time in the Hejaz, Salim was considered to be on the reformist side of the SI and was at odds with the increasingly leftist faction of SI led by Semaun, Tan Malaka, and Darsono; who would eventually break with SI to found the Communist Union of the Indies. Salim was occasionally accused by those leftists of being too close to the Dutch colonial government. First, his newspaper Neratja had been funded in 1917 with government money (under the direction of Governor General Johan Paul van Limburg Stirum) who wanted a Malay-language forum for perspectives sympathetic to the Dutch Ethical Policy, However, by 1918 Neratja became a harsh critic of the colonial government, regularly printing reports of mistreatment of Muslims in remote regions of the Indies. Nonetheless, allegations continued to surface from the left. The Dutch communist Henk Sneevliet accused Neratja editor Abdul Muis of having advocated for his expulsion from the Indies in 1917. And when Salim's Neratja was the only Malay language newspaper to applaud his expulsion in 1918, its editors were condemned by other newspapers and forced to apologize. Even in the late 1920s, as many communists in the Indies were being sent to concentration camps in Boven Digoel, disputes were still arising over Salim's behavior in 1917. In 1927 Bintang Timoer published allegations that Agus Salim had joined Sarekat Islam and other meetings in the 1910s and delivered reports to government officials and then used government money to criticize communists in Neratja. Salim responded that he had needed money to continue his activities, and that everyone profited from the government in some way or other. Later, after the breakup of the Sarekat Islam, Salim (along with Tjokroaminoto) co-founded the Islamic Union Party (Partai Serikat Islam, PSI), later became PSII. After Tjokro's death in 1934, Salim became the party's intellectual leader. In 1921, Salim was appointed to the Volksraad, the Indies' mainly symbolic and advisory quasi-legislature, representing Sarekat Islam. Despite being a proficient speaker of Dutch language, he insisted to deliver his speeches in Malay, the first member of the council to do so despite hostile reception from other European members. He left the chamber in 1924, frustrated by the chamber's powerlessness (its main function is indeed to solely give advices to the Governor-General) and derided it as just a mere komedi omong (talking comedy). Being an outspoken advocate of social change within Indonesian Islamic community, Salim was widely known for his unorthodoxy on social issues. At the 1927 convention of national Islamic organization Jong Islamieten Bond (JIB) in Surakarta, Salim ripped apart the curtained divider between men's and women's seating area, and proceeded to deliver his speech titled (\\"On Veiling and Separation of Women\\"). Another area of activism that Salim was active was labour's welfare. At request of prominent Dutch trade union Nederlands Verbond van Vakverenigingen (NVV), he served as an advisor for its delegation to the 1929 and 1930 International Labour Convention, both times in Geneva, Switzerland. It was alleged that throughout his early years returning from Jeddah, Salim had been in contact or possibly working for the Politieke Inlichtingen Dienst (PID), the Dutch East Indies's principal state security and intelligence service. Allan Akbar, a historian, conceded that Salim had been asked for a favour by Datuak Tumangguang, a prominent Minangkabau advisor to the colonial government, to covertly enter Sarekat Islam, especially to investigate the relationship between Tjokroaminoto and the Germans. For six weeks, Salim investigated the Sarekat from within, but in a strange twist of history, decided to join the organization in his own will.  Japanese occupation  During the waning years of Dutch rule and early years of Japanese occupation, Salim retired from active politics and was involved in several trades. Unlike most of the future Republican leaders, Salim was never arrested nor exiled, probably owing from his vast connections with the colonial bureaucracy or his rumored services for the colonial intelligence services. On 1943, the Japanese military government asked Salim, a renowned polyglot who speak nine languages, to compile a military dictionary for the use of Pembela Tanah Air, the newly-formed volunteer militia prepared for an impending invasion of the Allied forces. Salim found his way back to politics, being appointed to advise the Indonesian leaders (Sukarno, Mohammad Hatta, Ki Hajar Dewantara, and Mas Mansyur) who is in charge of the Pusat Tenaga Rakyat (\\"Center for People's Power\\", Putera), an intellectual body set up by Japanese government to mobilize popular support for war efforts.  Indonesian independence  Salim and Sukarno in Dutch custody, 1949. Salim was appointed to the Investigating Committee for Preparatory Work for Independence (Badan Penyelidik Usaha-usaha Persiapan Kemerdekaan Indonesia, BPUPK) on March 1945. On June 1, Salim was appointed to a Committee of Nine (Panitia Sembilan) tasked to draft the basis of the state. In the committee chaired by Sukarno, Salim was one of the prominent Muslim leaders alongside Wahid Hasyim and Abdul Kahar Muzakir. One of the issue that must be tackled by the committee was to find a compromise between the secular nationalist bloc, which demanded a secular state; with the Islamist bloc, which argued that being a Muslim- majority nation, an independent Indonesia should be based on Islamic principles. The committee would end up with the Jakarta Charter, which includes Sukarno's proposed Pancasila as official state philosophy and an explicit call for Muslim Indonesians to oblige to the sharia (ketuhanan dengan kewajiban menjalankan syariat Islam bagi pemeluk-pemeluknya). BPUPK as a whole ratified it on July 10. On July 11, Salim was appointed to sit in the Subcommittee for Constitutional Drafting (Panitia Kecil Perancang Undang- Undang Dasar), again chaired by Sukarno. He was highly influential on the early drafting of the constitution and was seen as a respected mediator during heated confrontations. On August 7, the BPUPK was dissolved and replaced with the Preparatory Committee for Indonesian Independence (Panitia Persiapan Kemerdekaan Indonesia, PPKI). For unclear reasons, however, Salim did not sit in committee; he was also not recorded of being present during the independence proclamation at Sukarno's residence on August 17.  Government and diplomatic services  Salim with Eleanor Roosevelt, 1953 Salim did not join the first Indonesian cabinet; Sukarno, now President of the Republic, appointed him to the newly-created Supreme Advisory Council (Dewan Pertimbangan Agung, DPA). He remained in that position until March 1946, when he was appointed Deputy Foreign Minister (Menteri Muda Luar Negeri) under Foreign Minister and Prime Minister Sutan Sjahrir of the Socialist Party. He reprised that role in the third Sjahrir Cabinet before being promoted as Foreign Minister in the first Amir Sjarifuddin Cabinet on July 1947; Amir, like Sjahrir, is a Socialist. As Deputy Foreign Minister, Salim led numerous Indonesian diplomatic missions abroad. He led the Indonesian delegation in the Asian Relations Conference in New Delhi from March to April 1947. The same month, he led a small party consisting of Abdurrahman Baswedan, Rasjidi, and Nazir Sutan Pamuncak to secure diplomatic recognition from Arab states. A fluent speaker of classical (fusha) Arabic, Salim met with Mahmoud El Nokrashy Pasha, the Egyptian premier, and Abdul Rahman Hassan Azzam, the secretary- general of the Arab League. For the next three months, Salim and his delegation successfully secured diplomatic recognition from almost all members of the League. On August 1947, Salim with Sjahrir traveled to the United States to participate in a United Nations Security Council session in Lake Success, New York. With help of banker Margono Djojohadikusumo (grandfather of Prabowo Subianto), the two breached Dutch naval blockade with a plane carrying contraband vanilla to Singapore. Returning home, Salim was part of the Indonesian delegation throughout negotiations aboard USS Renville, which led to an agreement that temporarily reduced tensions after the breaking down of the previous Linggadjati Agreement. During the negotiations, Salim's personal friendship with the Dutch chief negotiator Abdul Kadir Widjojoatmodjo (a KNIL high-ranking officer whom he had worked with in the Dutch consulate in Jeddah) helped to smoothen the process. Salim remained in charge of foreign affairs in the first Hatta Cabinet, while officially serving ad interim. When Dutch started a military offensive called Operatie Kraai, in December 1948 , he was one of the Republican leaders exiled from the capital, Yogyakarta. Alongside Sjahrir and Sukarno, Salim was first exiled to Berastagi in North Sumatera before transferred to Parapat. With the rest of the leaders, Salim returned to Yogya and reclaimed his duties as foreign minister in the second Hatta Cabinet, having been briefly exercised by Sjafruddin Prawiranegara ex officio with his duties as Chairman of the Emergency Government of the Republic in its only cabinet from December 1948 to July 1949. One of Salim's final diplomatic service was as part of the Indonesian delegation in the Dutch‚ÄìIndonesian Round Table Conference in The Hague on late 1949. Hatta's second cabinet was dissolved on December 1949 and the United States of Indonesia was formed. Hatta, the United States' inaugural (and only) premier and foreign minister, appointed Salim to be a special advisor on foreign affairs. The United States itself was dissolved on September 1950. Agus Salim casket draped by the flag of Indonesia and prepped for burial, 1954  Later life and death  After leaving government service, Salim returned to writing and journalism. On 1952, he was appointed to the honorary board of Association of Indonesian Journalists (Persatuan Wartawan Indonesia, PWI). In 1953, he wrote a religious book titled Bagaimana Takdir, Tawakal, dan Tauchid Harus Dipahamkan? (\\"How Should Tawakkul, Taqdir, and Tawhid Be Understood?\\"); later editions saw it updated as Keterangan Filsafat Tentang Takdir, Tawakal, dan Tauchid (\\"Philosophical Addresses on Tawakkul, Taqdir, and Tawhid\\"). On spring of 1953, Salim and his wife lived for six months in Ithaca, New York, where he delivered guest lectures at Cornell University. His lectures would later compiled and published as Pesan-Pesan Islam: Rangkaian Kuliah Musim Semi 1953 di Cornell University, Amerika Serikat. Salim died on November 4, 1954, in Jakarta. He was interred at the Kalibata Heroes Cemetery.  Personal life and legacy  Salim married Zaenatun Nahar, a cousin, on 1912. The marriage produced eight children: Theodora Atia (Dolly); Jusuf Taufik (Totok); Violet Hanifah (Yoyet); Maria Zenobia; Achmad Sjewket; Islam Basjari; Abdul Hadi; Siti Asia; Zuchra Adiba; and Abdurrachman Ciddiq. Hadi and Adiba died as babies, while Sjewket was killed in action during the Indonesian revolution. Chalid Salim, Salim's younger brother, was a communist who became Catholic pastor during his years of exile in Boven Digoel. Emil Salim, a prominent economist and minister in Suharto administration, is a nephew. Dolly, the eldest, was known for being the first person to sing the lyrics of Indonesia Raya, later adopted as the republic's national anthem, during the Second Youth Congress (Kongres Pemuda II) on 1928. Violet married Djohan Sjahroezah, a prominent socialist and underground anti-Japanese activist and a nephew of Sjahrir, Salim's revolutionary protege. Salim was known for his frugality and simple lifestyle. Mohammad Roem, in a piece for Prisma magazine, described the lifestyle of the man whom he succeeded as Foreign Minister as a manifestation of leiden is lijden (\\"leading is suffering\\"), an old Dutch proverb. He and his wife agreed not to send their children to Dutch colonial schools, despite of being a product of the institutions himself; instead, they mostly homeschooled them. Informally bestowed the honorific title of the \\"Grand Old Man\\" (Kamitua yang Mulia), Salim was reported to be fluent in at least nine languages. Minangkabau and Malay would have been his natives languages, followed by English, Dutch, French, Japanese, German, Latin, and Turkish. He raised his children in a multilingual household. In an anecdote told by Cornell professor George McTurnan Kahin to historian Asvi Warman Adam, Salim and South Vietnamese leader (and future president) Ngo Dinh Diem sat together in a faculty dining room at the Cornell campus. Salim stroke a conversation he soon dominated over French-educated Diem. Salim was best remembered for his sharp wit and debating skills. In a version of the story (as told by Jef Last), several Sarekat Islam members tried to mock Salim, who is in the middle of a speech, with goat sounds; alluring to Salim's white beard and in a way, his devout Islamic faith. Salim calmly responded by asking the chair \\"whether Sarekat has invited a herd of goats to its meeting\\"; and if yes, \\"as a polyglot I would honour their right to listen to a speech by speaking in hircine language.\\" In another instance, Salim was mocked by Bergmeyer, a Dutch member of the Volksraad for delivering a speech in Malay. At one point Salim had said ekonomi, the Malayized word for economy, and Bergmeyer challenged him to state the original Malay for the word. Salim quickly retorted: \\"if you can say what 'economy' is in the original Dutch, I'll state the Malay version for you.\\" Both Malay and Dutch absorbed 'economy' from the Ancient Greek word of Œø·º∞Œ∫ŒøŒΩŒøŒºŒØŒ±, so there would be no original word in both languages. He was also popular for his lighthearted humour. A lifelong smoker of cigar (he would sometimes lit one while teaching at Cornell) a common lore was that when Salim, on behalf of the Indonesian government, met Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh (some claimed, however, it's the other British royalties) during a dinner at the coronation of Elizabeth II on June 1953. A British diplomat assigned to him had asked him not to smoke his kretek in the Westminster Abbey and in the palace. During the dinner, however, Salim found the young Duke was still awkward and unsettled while greeting his guests as a new consort to the Queen. He lit his kretek and asked if the Duke knew of it. When the Duke inquired what was Salim smoking, he answered: \\"That, Your Highness, is the reason for which the West conquered the world!\\" Salim was posthumously declared a National Hero in 1960. Padang's main football stadium was named in his honor, alongside numerous roads in major Indonesian cities. in References Bibliography  * Category:1884 births Category:1954 deaths Category:National Heroes of Indonesia Category:Minangkabau people Category:Indonesian diplomats Category:Government ministers of Indonesia Category:People from Agam Regency Category:Indonesian Muslims Category:Foreign ministers of Indonesia Category:BPUPK ","title":"Agus Salim"},{"id":"7220660","text":"When Wise Ducks Meet is a 1924 two-reel comedy film directed by Philadelphian director, Benjamin Stoloff.

While prior H5N1 strains have been known, they were significantly different from the 2006 strain of H5N1 on a genetic level, making the global spread of this new strain unprecedented. The 2006 strain of H5N1 is a fast-mutating, highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAI) found in multiple bird species. It is both epizootic (an epidemic in non-humans) and panzootic (a disease affecting animals of many species especially over a wide area). Unless otherwise indicated, \\"H5N1\\" in this article refers to the highly pathogenic 2006 strain of H5N1. In the first two months of 2006 H5N1 spread to Africa and Europe in wild bird populations possibly signaling the beginning of H5N1 being endemic in wild migratory bird populations on multiple continents for decades, permanently changing the way poultry are farmed. In addition, the spread of highly pathogenic H5N1 to wild birds, birds in zoos and even sometimes to mammals (example: pet cats) raises many unanswered questions concerning best practices for threat mitigation, trying to balance reducing risks of human and nonhuman deaths from the current nonpandemic strain with reducing possible pandemic deaths by limiting its chances of mutating into a pandemic strain. Not using vaccines can result in the need to kill significant numbers of farm and zoo birds, while using vaccines can increase the chance of a pandemic. By April 2006, scientists had concluded that containment had failed due to the role of wild birds in transmitting the virus and were now emphasizing far more comprehensive risk mitigation and management measures. In June 2006 the World Health Organization predicted an upsurge in human deaths due to H5N1 during late 2006 or early 2007. In July and August 2006, significantly increased numbers of bird deaths due to H5N1 were recorded in Cambodia, China, Laos, Nigeria, and Thailand while continuing unabated a rate unparalleled in Indonesia. In September, Egypt and Sudan joined the list of nations seeing a resurgence of bird deaths due to H5N1; followed by Vietnam and South Korea in December. January January 5, 2006 *A second Turkish child from the same family died from bird flu on Thursday at a hospital in eastern Turkey, where she was being treated, a regional governor said.

January 30, 2006 *According to WHO: :The Ministry of Health in Iraq has confirmed the country's first case of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus. The case occurred in a 15-year-old girl who died on 17 January following a severe respiratory illness. Her symptoms were compatible with a diagnosis of H5N1 avian influenza. Preliminary laboratory confirmation was provided by a US Naval Medical Research Unit located in Cairo, Egypt. The girl's 39-year-old uncle, who cared for her during her illness, developed symptoms on 24 January and died of a severe respiratory disease on 27 January. Both patients resided in the town of Raniya near Sulaimaniyah in the northern part of the country, close to the border with Turkey. Poultry deaths were recently reported in their neighbourhood, but H5N1 avian influenza has not yet been confirmed in birds in any part of the country. Poultry samples have been sent for testing at an external laboratory. A history of exposure to diseased birds has been found for the girl. The uncle's source of infection is under investigation. The Ministry of Health has further informed WHO of a third human case of respiratory illness that is under investigation for possible H5N1 infection. The patient is a 54-year-old woman, from the same area, who was hospitalized on 18 January. Specimens are on their way to a WHO collaborating laboratory in the United Kingdom for diagnostic confirmation and further analysis. An international team, including representatives of other UN agencies, is being assembled to assist the Ministry of Health in its investigation of the situation and its planning of an appropriate public health response. WHO staff within Iraq have been directly supporting the government's operational response, which was launched shortly after the girl's death. Iraq is the seventh country to report human H5N1 infection in the current outbreak. The first human case occurred in Viet Nam in December 2003.

February 21, 2006 * The Malaysian government confirms 40 chickens died of H5N1 in Selangor. * Croatia confirmed the previous day's case to be H5N1. *Professor Neil Ferguson, Imperial College London biologist, says: :\\"This is a disease which doesn't go away so we are going to be living with H5N1 in Western Europe, I believe, in wild bird populations - even endemic in wild bird populations - for decades perhaps, or even sporadically in those populations every year.\\" *The respected science journal Nature says: :\\"The virus is highly likely to become endemic, says Peter Openshaw, head of the respiratory viral infections section at the National Heart and Lung Institute in London, UK. We have to change the way poultry are farmed. [...] Jan Slingenbergh, an animal health expert at the United Nation's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in Rome, Italy, points out that H5N1 may survive in icy lake waters over European winters, potentially infecting any migratory birds that subsequently arrive. The virus could also become established in permanently resident European birds; Openshaw notes that H5N1 has so far been able to infect a wide range of species. If this happens, farming practices will have to be changed, says Neil Ferguson, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London, UK, who is advising the British government on how to deal with possible future outbreaks.\\" February 23, 2006 *Slovakia has become the latest EU nation to confirm cases of the virulent H5N1 bird flu strain.

Data used in the analysis were collected for surveillance purposes. Quality, reliability and format were not consistent across data from different countries. Despite this limitation, several conclusions could be reached. # The number of new countries reporting human cases increased from 4 to 9 after October 2005, following the geographical extension of outbreaks among avian populations. # Half of the cases occurred in people under the age of 20 years; 90% of cases occurred in people under the age of 40 years. # The overall case-fatality rate was 56%. Case fatality was high in all age groups but was highest in persons aged 10 to 39 years. # The case-fatality profile by age group differs from that seen in seasonal influenza, where mortality is highest in the elderly. # The overall case- fatality rate was highest in 2004 (73%), followed by 63% to date in 2006, and 43% in 2005. # Assessment of mortality rates and the time intervals between symptom onset and hospitalization and between symptom onset and death suggests that the illness pattern has not changed substantially during the three years. # Cases have occurred all year round. However, the incidence of human cases peaked, in each of the three years in which cases have occurred, during the period roughly corresponding to winter and spring in the Northern Hemisphere. If this pattern continues, an upsurge in cases could be anticipated starting in late 2006 or early 2007.\\" July July 5, 2006 * \\"Nigeria has been infected multiple times with H5N1 bird flu probably carried by migratory birds from southern Russia and northern Europe or introduced by imported chickens, scientists said on Wednesday. After analysing samples from infected birds on two farms in south-western Nigeria they found the viruses were genetically distinct from each other and from H5N1 found in the north of the country. So rather than one strain spreading through the country, different strains had been introduced on separate occasions, which could make controlling the spread of the virus more difficult. [...] The analysed samples were similar to strains found in southern Russia and northern Europe but not from southeast Asia\\" July 7, 2006 *\\"A Spanish laboratory has confirmed the country's first case of H5N1 bird flu after analyzing a sample taken from a wild migratory water bird\\" (the great crested grebe).

December 18, 2006 *The United States summarized progress the U.S. government has made preparing against an influenza pandemic: ** Federal Pandemic Preparedness Plans: All Federal Departments and Agencies are developing their own pandemic preparedness plans to ensure that they are addressing all elements of a comprehensive checklist. The \\"meta-checklist\\" guiding their efforts is available for any institution to use, at www.pandemicflu.gov. ** Statewide Pandemic Planning Summits: Secretary Leavitt and other senior officials from the Department of Health and Human Services have led Statewide pandemic planning summits in all States. We are investing $600 million in State and local preparedness efforts, including the exercising of pandemic plans across communities and at all levels of government. ** Community-Wide Mitigation Strategies: We have focused unprecedented attention on the role of community- wide mitigation strategies, such as early school closure, cancellation of public gatherings, and other \\"social distancing\\" behaviors in reducing illness during a pandemic. Interim guidance on the ways communities can use these interventions most effectively will be released in January. ** Vaccine Production: We have invested over $1 billion in the development of new cell- culture technologies for influenza vaccine production, and will soon announce contracts to adapt existing egg-based vaccine facilities for pandemic vaccine production. ** Adjuvants: Very promising results on the testing of \\"dose- stretching\\" materials, also known as \\"adjuvants\\", have recently been announced by companies involved in this research.

Some epidemiological research on the subject has shown that there is a small but statistically significant positive correlation between height and intelligence after controlling for socioeconomic class and parental education. This correlation arises in both the developed and developing world and persists across age groups. An individual‚Äôs taller stature has been attributed to higher economic status, which often translates to a higher quality of nutrition. This correlation, however, can be inverted to characterize one‚Äôs socioeconomic status as a consequence of stature, where shorter stature can attract discrimination that affects many factors, among them employment, and treatment by educators. One such theory argues that since height strongly correlates with white and gray matter volume, it may act as a biomarker for cerebral development which itself mediates intelligence. Competing explanations include that certain genetic factors may influence both height and intelligence, or that both height and intelligence may be affected in similar ways by adverse environmental exposures during development. Measurements of the total surface area and mean thickness of the cortical grey matter using a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed that the height of individuals had a positive correlation with the total cortical surface area. This supports the idea that genes that influence height also influence total surface area of the brain, which in turn influences intelligence, resulting in the correlation. Other explanations further qualify the positive correlation between height and intelligence, suggesting that because the correlation becomes weaker with higher socioeconomic class and education level, environmental factors could partially override any genetic factors affecting both characteristics.  Previous studies  First inquiries into the correlation of height and intelligence came within the study of development in schoolchildren. William Porter was the first person to conduct a study to find a relationship between the physiology of children and their intelligence. The motive for this research was to attempt to predict the potential ‚Äúdullness‚Äù or ‚Äúprecocity‚Äù of children based on simple measurements teachers could make. He did in fact find a correlation between body size and the learning level of children, but did not focus specifically on height. More recent studies have continued the research into a correlation between height and intelligence, but again were often not directly related to height and intelligence. Some of the earlier large studies cited for height and intelligence are the Scottish Mental Surveys in 1932 and 1947. However, the studies were largely meant to analyze the genetic and environmental contributions to cognitive ability differences. Height (and weight) were added to provide a multivariate analysis. In an effort to better understand this association, numerous other studies were thus carried out. These studies either expanded upon the association or sought to find an explanation. A study by Douglas, et al. (1965) addressed the Scottish study and sought to test if the association reflected a linkage between development of the brain and/or emotional development and the development of the rest of the body. Similarly, in 1986, Wilson et al wanted to study if there is a longitudinal relation between height and intelligence. Nonetheless, as these studies were unable to provide satisfying results and explanations for the correlation, interest in it persists in the 21st century. In 2014, another study was carried out by a team of researchers at Edinburgh University, Scotland, motivated by the understanding that both height and intelligence test scores are predictors of better health outcomes and mortality. The study was constructed to better identify if there are any shared phenotypic and genetic influences from height and intelligence in determining health outcomes and mortality.  Definition of intelligence  Human intelligence can be measured according to an extensive number of tests and criteria, ranging from academic, social, and emotional fields. While there is no clear consensus on a definition of human intelligence, there are common themes among those that exist, summarized generally as \\"Intelligence measures an agent‚Äôs ability to achieve goals in a wide range of environments\\". There are several theories that define different categories of intelligence and associate traits, instead of a single general ability. In most of the studies, intelligence quotient (IQ) tests were used to measure a subject's mental age, which was checked for possible correlation with height. While the use of IQ tests are highly debated among scientists as an accurate measurement of intelligence, they provide a quantitative and normal distribution to compare cognitive abilities among people. Intelligence cannot be strictly defined, and it has been cautioned that intelligence has many different facets. Regardless, studies conducted to compare height with intelligence frequently use the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) which measures verbal and performance abilities for individuals over the age of 16 (WISC for those under 16) years through the following tests: information, general comprehension, memory span, arithmetical reasoning, similarities, vocabulary, picture arrangement, picture completion, block design, object assembly, and a digit symbol test. Many of the studies performed on the relationship between physical stature and intelligence used one of these tests in order to gauge relative cognitive ability based on the age of the participants. In addition to IQ tests, some of the studies that were performed on children use academic performance as a measure of intelligence through standardized tests such as the Wide Range Achievement Test.  Correlation: studies and methodologies  A 1986 study of 13,887 American youths aged 6 to 17 years old sought to examine the correlation between height and intelligence. Height was normalized for age and sex, and intelligence was measured with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children and the Wide Range Achievement Test, measuring intellectual development (IQ) and academic achievement, respectively. Subjects were re-examined 2 to 5 years later. Both the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children and the Wide Range Achievement Test were found to significantly correlate with height. However, change in height was found not to be correlated with IQ score. In 2000 another study found a similar correlation. 127 growth-restricted and 32 non-growth- restricted children aged 9 to 24 months were put on a two-year \\"randomized trial of nutritional supplementation and psychosocial stimulation.\\" Eight years later, the subjects' growth, IQ, and cognitive functions were measured. IQ was also measured using the Wechsler Intelligence Scales. As in the 1986 study, it was found that supplementation to growth was not correlated with cognitive ability. Only psychosocial stimulation was found to increase IQ scores of subjects, and growth-restricted children had lower IQ scores than non-growth-restricted children, lending more evidence to the long-term cognitive consequences of growth restriction. These studies confirmed results found by JM Tanner in 1966. This study found that among children of school age, there is a correlation of about 0.15-0.25 between height and score on the 11+ test, an examination administered to students in England. It was found that this correlation decreases with age, but does not completely disappear; in samples of young adults, correlations of up to 0.2 were found. This study also found that ‚Äúthe greater the number of children in the family the lower their height and the less their scores in mental tests‚Äù, and attributes the effect ‚Äúto co-advancement [of height and cognitive ability] and disappears when maturity is reached.‚Äù The correlation between number of children and intelligence was found to be stronger in poor families than in rich ones, which contributed to the conclusion that there is a strong correlation between height and mental ability between children in different socio-economic groups that persists in adulthood. A study was done by the Newcastle Thousands Families in 1947 to see if there was a correlation between birth weights and IQ at ages 9 and 13. There showed no correlation between birth weights and their IQs. However, height at the age of 9 played a major role in the IQ of the children (standardized regression coefficient b = 2.6, 95% CI 1.6-3.6, P < 0.0001). At the ages of 13, social economics played yet another larger role (b = 3.4, 95% CI 2.3-4.4, P = 0.001). With data from ten consecutive years of quantitative measurements on height and intelligence separated by girls and boys and gathered from the Harvard Growth Study, this compilation of analyses shows the difference in correlation between height and intelligence in the classes of girls and boys. Boys demonstrate no clear correlation between height at a certain age group and intelligence later on in life but girls do. There appears to be a clear link between intelligence levels at 10 and 11 with a girl‚Äôs height at the ages of 8 and 9 with other variables of note, i.e., socioeconomic status, age of first menstruation and ethnicity factoring into the correlation as well. A 1999 study that was conducted on a sample on 32,887 Swedish men, aged 18, free of growth defects showed that, by and large, shorter men (with 2 standard deviations below the mean) demonstrated poorer physical and psychological performance in the context of military service, with increased risk of musculoskeletal diagnoses. Additionally, increased height showed a relationship with increased mean intellectual performance and, under conditions of stress, shorter men showcased demonstrably worse leadership capability and psychological function. A 2011 model which incorporated assortative mating patterns into a bivariate model was used to account for height-to-intelligence factors that related to these mating habits as well as pleiotropic genetic influences when establishing the correlation between height and intelligence. Additionally, this team of researchers was responsible for using a dataset aggregated for Swedish male twins to explain both the genetic and environmental influences of the relationship between height and intelligence and height and capability to manage wartime stress. In 1989 the heights of male and female corporate managers and non-managers were measured in two studies with about 200 subjects. Both studies found a statistically significant correlation between managerial position and height; taller people were more likely to hold managerial positions, regardless of sex. A 2005 study used data on 1,181 identical twins and 1,412 fraternal twins, collected from Norwegian army files and Norwegian twin registries, in order to factor the correlation between intelligence test scores and standing height into environmental and genetic components. It used a structural equation model comparing the correlation between genetic, shared environmental and non-shared environmental factors and found that 59% of the height- intelligence correlation was due to shared environmental factors. Genes were found to contribute 35% of the correlation, and non-shared environmental factors contributed 6%, both statistically significant amounts. A 1991 study conducted on 76,111 Danish men sought to test the height-intelligence positive correlation on either extremes of height. The study defined two groups: the short group, composed of individuals below the 2nd percentile for height and the tall group, composed of individuals above the 98th percentile for height in Denmark. It found that the short group‚Äôs intelligence test score and educational level means lay about two-thirds of a standard deviation below the overall means, but suggested there appeared to be local factors that may have contributed negatively and significantly to the scores. In contrast, the study found the tall group scored about one-half standard deviation above the overall means, but suggested that both groups scored below what would be expected from a linear trend. A study from 1985 to 2005 was conducted on Dutch twin pairs from the ages 5 to 18 to establish a correlation factor. There was shown a positive correlation in childhood and early adolescence. These factors were used to gauge the intelligence in adults. The contributing factors for this study were mainly just genetics and full-scaled IQ. There was weak or no correlation between cognitive ability and height found when examining ten brain measurements from a large elderly population, even when controlled for sex and age. Even though height and brain size are highly influenced by genes, doubt is raised about the relationship between them when considering that the correlation between height and cognitive ability is not steady throughout life. There is an increase in brain development during the adolescent years and a marked decrease afterwards, despite height generally staying constant after reaching adulthood.  Explanations of the correlation  An individual‚Äôs height is determined by a complex interplay between genes and environment. Statistical analysis of multiple research studies have produced a correlation between height and intelligence. Various genetic and environmental factors may influence height, and the reasons are sought for any correlation with measured intelligence. It has been suggested that increases in average height, in response to improved nutrition, have been accompanied by an increase in brain size, and is one explanation for an overall rise in measured intelligence among all tested populations that has been called the Flynn effect. Heritability estimates for height can be generated using comparisons among close relatives, such as between parents and children or siblings. To measure the effect of genetic inheritance, height comparisons are correlated with total shared genetic markers. Common percent values range between 60-80%, with high variation attributed to differences in a population‚Äôs genetic history and environment (such as climate, nutrition, and lifestyle). The most notable contributing environmental influences associated with the correlation of height and IQ include ‚Äúdiet, disease, psychosocial stress and inadequate cognitive stimulation‚Äù Populations that live under stable conditions tend to have higher values of genetic influence, while populations susceptible to events of poor nutrition and illness show greater determination from their environment. An auxological approach that emphasizes multiple influences from all aspects of life, with special attention paid to prenatal and very early child development, seem to offer the most robust and accurate portrayal of overall growth and development. From these perspectives, we can better understand if the correlation persists, especially within developing countries prone to environmental uncertainties. Men on average are taller and have a higher IQ than women however, women's IQ's have been rising significantly more over the years and have even surpassed men in other countries such as Iceland. This means that health and culture may be more of a factor to intelligence than height. PDF The Trivers‚ÄìWillard hypothesis suggests that female mammals are able to adjust offspring sex ratio in response to their maternal condition; a suggested generalization is that bigger and taller human parents are likely to have more sons than the average. PDF As those traits are considered desirable in mates of those respective genders, they confer an evolutionary advantage to offspring. However, a study has shown that maternal intelligence is correlated with reduced child mortality, indicating a higher level of reproductive success for intelligent women. This study suggests that intelligent human females are more fit in an evolutionary sense and that there is positive selection for higher IQ in females, specifically in regions where child mortality is significantly higher than average. Height and intelligence may be correlated, but there is not significant proof of it being caused by genetics. There are many genes associated with genetic transmission of intelligence, but current theories of intelligence point to inheritance of intelligence from parents to be due to both genetic and environmental factors, especially as there is no concrete proof of the relationship between certain genes and intelligence. The correlation between height and intelligence could also be confounded by how cultural and psychological factors affect the expression of intelligence. It is impossible to create a culture-free test for intelligence, as different societies value and cultivate different skill sets and ways of interpreting the world. For example, some cultures put more emphasis on hard work than being clever, making it difficult to accurately test and compare the intelligence of different groups within a population. There is evidence that intellectual development is influenced by the expectations placed on an individual. In an experiment involving elementary school children, researchers found that when teachers believe students are above average intellect, these students tend to do better in school and receive higher IQ scores than students who are perceived as average or below average intellect, regardless of the actual competence of the students. This self-fulfilling prophecy caused by expectations is known as the Pygmalion effect, and it may play have an effect on taller student who are generally viewed as more mature or dominant. Sexual selection and cross-trait assortative mating might also contribute to the correlation between height and intelligence. Because both height and intelligence positively affect an individual's overall fitness, individuals generally look for these traits in potential partners. In other words, smart men are more likely to mate with tall women, and smart women are more likely to mate with tall men, as both traits are affected by perceptions of cross-trait attractiveness.  Statistics  Across studies, the correlation coefficient of height and intelligence was generally found to be around 0.2,Sundet JM, Tambs K, Harris JR, Magnus P, Torjussen TM. Resolving the genetic and environmental sources of the correlation between height and intelligence: a study of nearly 2600 Norwegian male twin pairs. Twin Res Hum Genet. 2005 Aug;8(4):307-11Tanner JM. Relation of body size, intelligence test scores and social circumstances. In: Mussen PH, Largen J, Covington M (eds). Trends and Issues in Developmental Psychology. New York: Holt, Rinehard and Winston Inc., 1969. indicating a positive association between height and intelligence which is weak but still statistically significant. A smaller within-family height-intelligence correlation of 0.10 was also found, indicating that both assortative mating and pleiotropy may be contributing causes for the general correlation. Height and intelligence are both polygenic traits, and as a result it is difficult to isolate possible causes for the variation in each of these traits individually, let alone causes for correlations between them. Results regarding the relative responsibility of genetic and environmental factors in causing the correlation are far from conclusive; while some studies have arrived at similar estimates of the relative responsibility of genetic vs. environmental factors, others have arrived at completely different estimates. It's also important to note that several of the recent studies confirming the correlation employed the standard bivariate ACE model, which is extremely sensitive to assumptions reflected in parameters. For instance, two of these studies arrived at similar estimates for the relative responsibility of common environmental and genetic factors in causing the correlation: 59% and 59% for the former, 31% and 35% for the latter. However, only slight modifications to the coefficient of assortative mating made the difference between the inferred percentage of genetic responsibility being as low as around 30% (the value the authors reported) to as high as 90%. Further, another study using the same model even concluded that genetics alone could explain the correlation, without any influence from common environmental factors such as one's education level and nutrition. This could have been because the studied population was relatively economically egalitarian, meaning access to resources like education and nutrition played less of a role than they might in other populations, or because of differences in how the researches handled the model and its parameters. The ACE model used in these studies was found to be sensitive to assumptions of assortative mating; results should therefore be interpreted with caution, as should the resulting percentages of genetic vs. environmental contribution.

Unless otherwise indicated, \\"H5N1\\" in this article refers to the recent highly pathogenic strain of H5N1. H5N1 caused flu outbreaks in 1959 and in 1991 but these strains were very different from the current highly pathogenic strain of H5N1. Evolution from 1999 to 2002 created the Z genotype which became the dominant strain of highly pathogenic H5N1 in 2004. In January 2004 a major new outbreak of H5N1 surfaced in Vietnam and Thailand's poultry industry, and within weeks spread to ten countries and regions in Asia, including Indonesia, South Korea, Japan and China. In October 2004 researchers discovered H5N1 is far more dangerous than previously believed because waterfowl were directly spreading the highly pathogenic strain of H5N1 to chickens, crows, pigeons, and other birds and that it was increasing its ability to infect mammals as well. From this point on, avian influenza experts increasingly refer to containment as a strategy that can delay but not prevent a future avian flu pandemic.  January  * A major new outbreak of H5N1 surfaced in Vietnam and Thailand's poultry industry, and within weeks spread to ten countries and regions in Asia, including Indonesia, South Korea, Japan and China. Intensive efforts were undertaken to slaughter chickens, ducks and geese (over forty million chickens alone were slaughtered in high-infection areas), and the outbreak was contained by March, but the total human death toll in Vietnam and Thailand was twenty three people.  February  * \\"The Ministry of Public Health in Thailand has confirmed the country's tenth case of H5N1 infection.\\"  July  * Fresh outbreaks in poultry were confirmed in Ayutthaya and Pathumthani provinces of Thailand, and Chaohu city in Anhui, China.

As a result, Singapore has imposed a ban on the importation of chickens and poultry products. Similarly the EU has imposed a ban on Malaysian poultry products.

These moves appear to have been successful and since then, Singapore has lifted the ban and Malaysia has requested the OIE declare Malaysian poultry bird flu free.  September  * More cases of H5N1 in humans in Thailand.  October  * Researchers discover H5N1 is far more dangerous than previously believed. \\"In the past, outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza in poultry began following the primary introduction of a virus, of low pathogenicity, probably carried by a wild bird. The virus then required several months of circulation in domestic poultry in order to mutate from a form causing very mild disease to a form causing highly pathogenic disease, with a mortality approaching 100%. Only viruses of the H5 and H7 subtypes are capable of mutating to cause highly pathogenic disease. In the present outbreaks, however, asymptomatic domestic ducks can directly introduce the virus, in its highly pathogenic form, to poultry flocks.\\" Limiting this conclusion to domestic waterfowl proved to be wishful thinking, as in later months it became clear that nondomestic waterfowl were also directly spreading the highly pathogenic strain of H5N1 to chickens, crows, pigeons, and other birds and that it was increasing its ability to infect mammals as well. From this point on, avian influenza experts increasingly refer to containment as a strategy that can delay but not prevent a future avian flu pandemic.

This migratory bird is a U.S. federally listed endangered subspecies. The total population of the subspecies amounted to 582 breeding pairs in 1974, when census work on this bird began. While numbers have gradually increased with its protected status, the species is still vulnerable to population decline through natural disasters, predation, and human disturbance. Nesting and breeding behavior Least terns and snowy plovers nesting at Batiquitos Lagoon Wintering locations are actually unknown, but suspected to include the South American Pacific Coast. The California least tern arrives at its breeding grounds in late April. Courtship typically takes place removed from the nesting colony site, usually on an exposed tidal flat or beach. Only after courtship has confirmed mate selection does nesting begin by mid-May and is usually complete by mid-June. Nests are situated on barren to sparsely vegetated places near water, normally on sandy or gravelly substrates. In the San Francisco Bay region, breeding typically takes place on abandoned salt flats. Where the surface is hard, this species may use an artificial indentation (such as a deep dried footprint) to form the nest basin. The breeding colonies are not dense and may appear along marine or estuarine shores in areas free from humans or predators. The nest density may be as low as several per acre, but in San Diego County, densities of 200 nests per acre have been observed. The clutch size can be anywhere from one to four eggs, but most commonly consists of two or three. Both female and male incubate the eggs for a period of about three weeks, and both parents tend the semi-precocial young. Young birds can fly at age four weeks. After formation of the new families, groupings of birds may appear at lacustrine settings in proximity to the coast. Late season nesting may be renests or late season arrival activity. In any case, the bulk of the population has left California by the end of August. Feeding and roosting characteristics Juvenile preparing to receive food from parent The California least tern hunts primarily in shallow estuaries and lagoons, or beyond the breakers, even beyond 24 km offshore in areas of upwelling, and where smaller fishes are abundant. They hover until spotting prey, and then plunge into the water without full submersion to extract prey. In the bays and lagoons of Southern California and northern Mexico, the favored prey include anchovy, smelt, silversides, shiner surfperch and small crustaceans. The terns often feed near shore in the open ocean, especially in proximity to lagoons or bay mouths (Baird 2010). Adults do not require cover, so they commonly roost on the open ground. After young chicks are three days old, they are brooded less frequently by parents and require wind blocks and shade. Notable disruption of colonies can occur from predation by burrowing owls and American kestrels (Collins, 1980). Depredation by domestic cats has been observed in at least one colony (California Wildlife, 1990). Relation to other least terns The California least tern is a subspecies of the least tern (Sternula antillarum) that breeds on the United States Atlantic coast from Maine to Florida and Texas. Sternula antillarum is also found in breeding grounds along rivers in the midwest and Great Plains of the United States. Both the Californian subspecies and the nominate race of least tern are approximately 23 centimeters in length. Both have conspicuous black markings on their outermost primaries and fly over water with a distinctive hunchback appearance, with bills pointing slightly downward. The least tern is itself often considered conspecific with the little tern. Sternula albifrons, which has an extensive Old World distribution. The little tern differs from the least tern mainly in that its rump and tail are white, not grey, and it has a different call.

He is considered one of the best National Hunt racing competitors in UK horse racing history but whose quality was overshadowed by arch rival Arkle. Mill House won the 1963 Cheltenham Gold Cup and 1967 Whitbread Gold Cup. Known as 'The Big Horse' on account of his height of 18 hands, Mill House took part in one of the most famous battles of National Hunt Racing when in March 1964, he defended his Cheltenham crown against the Irish star Arkle. Trained by Fulke Walwyn and ridden by Willie Robinson, Mill House matched Arkle stride for stride over the last two miles before losing by five lengths. The following year, Mill House took Arkle on again in the Gold Cup but lost. His size meant increasing back problems, and he failed to participate in 1966 when Arkle won his third crown. In 1967, Mill House was back but Arkle was not, having been retired after suffering a serious leg injury a few months before at Kempton. However, Mill House slipped and fell at an open ditch in the back straight and left the race to a virtual unknown, Woodland Venture. A few weeks later, Mill House won the prestigious Whitbread Gold Cup under top weight at Sandown Park. It was his last major win. Continuing back weakness plagued his campaign in 1968 when he fell again in both the Cheltenham and Whitbread Gold Cups. He died in October 1975.

The cycles in this graph have lengths 5 and 6; therefore, there is no k > 1 that divides all cycle lengths. strongly connected graph with period three. In the mathematical area of graph theory, a directed graph is said to be aperiodic if there is no integer k > 1 that divides the length of every cycle of the graph. Equivalently, a graph is aperiodic if the greatest common divisor of the lengths of its cycles is one; this greatest common divisor for a graph G is called the period of G.  Graphs that cannot be aperiodic  In any directed bipartite graph, all cycles have a length that is divisible by two. Therefore, no directed bipartite graph can be aperiodic. In any directed acyclic graph, it is a vacuous truth that every k divides all cycles (because there are no directed cycles to divide) so no directed acyclic graph can be aperiodic. And in any directed cycle graph, there is only one cycle, so every cycle's length is divisible by n, the length of that cycle.  Testing for aperiodicity  Suppose that G is strongly connected and that k divides the lengths of all cycles in G. Consider the results of performing a depth-first search of G, starting at any vertex, and assigning each vertex v to a set Vi where i is the length (taken mod k) of the path in the depth-first search tree from the root to v. It can be shown that this partition into sets Vi has the property that each edge in the graph goes from a set Vi to another set V(i + 1) mod k. Conversely, if a partition with this property exists for a strongly connected graph G, k must divide the lengths of all cycles in G. Thus, we may find the period of a strongly connected graph G by the following steps: * Perform a depth-first search of G * For each e in G that connects a vertex on level i of the depth-first search tree to a vertex on level j, let ke = j - i - 1. * Compute the greatest common divisor of the set of numbers ke. The graph is aperiodic if and only if the period computed in this fashion is 1. If G is not strongly connected, we may perform a similar computation in each strongly connected component of G, ignoring the edges that pass from one strongly connected component to another. Jarvis and Shier describe a very similar algorithm using breadth first search in place of depth-first search; the advantage of depth-first search is that the strong connectivity analysis can be incorporated into the same search.  Applications  In a strongly connected graph, if one defines a Markov chain on the vertices, in which the probability of transitioning from v to w is nonzero if and only if there is an edge from v to w, then this chain is aperiodic if and only if the graph is aperiodic. A Markov chain in which all states are recurrent has a strongly connected state transition graph, and the Markov chain is aperiodic if and only if this graph is aperiodic. Thus, aperiodicity of graphs is a useful concept in analyzing the aperiodicity of Markov chains. Aperiodicity is also an important necessary condition for solving the road coloring problem. According to the solution of this problem , a strongly connected directed graph in which all vertices have the same outdegree has a synchronizable edge coloring if and only if it is aperiodic.

Snodgrass and directed by Jim Johnston, which was originally intended as a television pilot produced by Paramount Television for UPN. Premise At an unspecified point several centuries in the future, a unified Earth is exploring and colonizing the galaxy. One of its earliest colonies, the planet Cynosura, has declared independence and is attempting to establish its own sphere of influence as Earth's rival. The already tense situation escalates after Earth discovers and claimed a ideally habitable world named Meraz; after negotiations over joint access to Meraz break down, the Cynosurans decide to seize the planet by force. Meraz is undefended, as the Cynosurans have made it clear that they would consider the stationing of an armed garrison there tantamount to a declaration of war. At the orbital headquarters of Earth's Star Corps, a class of graduating cadets is assigned their new postings. Seven of the new ensigns: Oort, Fujisaki, Pressler, Vallas, McGinty, Dundee, and Jackson are assigned a training cruise on the corvette Surprise, in the company of only two experienced officers, captain Ridnoer and first officer Ivorstetter. The Surprise begins its patrol, which includes a docking with an Earth carrier. Meanwhile, a Cynosuran task force of five heavy cruisers intercepts a mail ship headed for Meraz and tortures its pilot to death for information. The Surprise jumps into the Meraz system and is almost immediately ambushed by the Cynosuran task force. Vastly outgunned and with its FTL drive disabled, the corvette flees. After both of the ship's officers are lost in action, Ensign Oort assumes command. The trainees manage to fake their ship's crash on the moon of a gas giant, and the Cynosurans resume their cautious approach to Meraz. On the ice moon, the trainees debate their course of action. Since the Cynosurans are obviously planning to exterminate the 25,000 Earth colonists on Meraz, they vote to relaunch the ship and do everything possible to prevent the attack. Ensign Jackson protests the decision as suicidal, and demands that the Surprise either lay low or surrender to the Cynosurans. He is outvoted, and the trainees begin repairing the ship. The disgruntled Jackson attempts to violently sabotage the launch and kidnaps Oort, Vallas and McGinty, planning on murdering them. However, before he can go through with this, all three are discovered bound and gagged by Fujisaki. She saves them, and the trainees carry out a makeshift court- martial, at which Jackson is sentenced to death, but he commits suicide before the sentence can be carried out. The Surprise is launched and begins stalking the much slower Cynosuran task force. Their first attack involves towing a swarm of asteroids into the path of the unsuspecting Cynosuran cruisers, one of which is destroyed. The Surprise next tries to lay an ambush by concealing itself in a cometary coma, only to have the enemy coincidentally attempt the same thing. A surprise attack from behind causes two of the enemy to collide and explode. Next, the Surprise crew manage to spoof the sensors of the remaining two enemy ships while in close proximity to a gas giant, destroying another cruiser. At this point, out of tricks and ammunition, the Surprise positions itself above Meraz, even though a one-on-one confrontation with the last remaining cruiser is expected to be hopeless. In a fierce battle, the cruiser takes damage, but the Surprise is crippled. As the Cynosuran captain prepares to administer a coup de grace, his missile is intercepted by a newly arrived Earth fleet, causing the enemy to withdraw. Main cast *Jay Underwood .... Ens.

It is a robust species with a rounded snout, widely separated, lobed nasal flaps, and long upper lip grooves that extend as far as the junction of the jawbones. The teeth have straight, erect cusps and are not blade-like. The first dorsal fin has a sloping posterior margin and the pectoral fins are broadly falcate (long and curved). Sometimes the body is uniform in colour but more often it is finely spotted with black. Distribution The spotted houndshark is found on the continental shelves in the eastern Pacific, from the Galapagos Islands and Peru southwards to the north of Chile, between latitudes 0¬∞ and 30¬∞ S. Status The spotted houndshark is caught for human consumption by gillnet, and sometimes by trawling, in artisan fisheries mainly in Peru, along with the humpback smooth- hound (Mustelus whitneyi) and the speckled smooth-hound (M. mento), collectively known (in Spanish) as \\"tollo\\" in local fisheries. Of these three fish species, the spotted houndshark is probably less common than the other two and its total numbers seem to be declining. Some control over fishing has been instituted by the introduction of a minimum size requirement, but this has been set rather low in relation to the size of the fish at sexual maturity. Because of these factors, the IUCN has rated the conservation status of this fish as being \\"vulnerable\\". However, with the decline in the main species sought (M. whitneyi), fishing pressure has decreased and further monitoring is required to assess whether the population trend will be reversed.

The placard reads \\"Warmly celebrate the 57th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China\\". The portrait is that of Sun Yat-sen. National Day (), officially the National Day of the People's Republic of China (), is a public holiday in China celebrated annually on October 1 as the national day of the People's Republic of China, commemorating the formal establishment of the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949. The Chinese Communist Party victory in the Chinese Civil War resulted in the Kuomintang retreat to Taiwan and the Chinese Communist Revolution in which the People's Republic of China replaced the Republic of China. Although it is observed on October 1, another six days are added to the official holiday, normally in lieu of the two weekend breaks around October 1, making it a de facto public holiday comprising seven consecutive days also known as Golden Week () with specifics regulated by the State Council. Festivities and concerts are usually held nationwide on this day, with a grand military parade and mass pageant event held on select years. The parade held on October 1, 2019 marked the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China.  History  The People's Republic of China was founded on October 1, 1949, with a ceremony celebrating the forming of the Central People's Government taking place in Tiananmen Square on the same day that year. The first public parade of the new People's Liberation Army took place there, following the address by the country's first Chairman Mao Zedong officially declaring the formal establishment of the Republic. The Central People's Government passed the Resolution on the National Day of the People's Republic of China on December 2, 1949, and declared that October 1 is the National Day.  National celebrations  National Day marks the start of the only golden week (ÈªÑÈáëÂë®) in the PRC that the government has kept. Removing one of the Golden Weeks caused controversies when it happened in 2007. The day is celebrated throughout mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau with a variety of government-organized festivities, including fireworks and concerts, as well as sports events and cultural events. Public places, such as Tiananmen Square in Beijing, are decorated in a festive theme. Portraits of revered leaders, such as Mao Zedong, are publicly displayed. The holiday is also celebrated by many overseas Chinese.  Wreath-laying ceremony at the Monument to the People's Heroes  From 2004 to 2013, a national wreath-laying ceremony was held on National Day in Tiananmen Square following the flag raising ceremony on years with no parades. The ceremony was centered on the Monument to the People's Heroes, built in 1958 in remembrance of the millions of Chinese who perished during the long years of national struggle. Beginning in 2014, they have been held on a new holiday, National Memorial Day, set on the eve of National Day, September 30, and is presided by the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China (China's paramount leader) and other party and state leaders.  Publication of the National Day Honors List  An old tradition revived in the 2019 is the publication of the \\"National Day Honors List\\" by the State Council as a measure of national gratitude and recognition of services rendered by a number of local and foreign-born individuals in charitable actions, as role models to the Chinese people, in contributing to the growth of the economy and the nation's sporting prestige, in fostering diplomatic relations with countries of the world and preserving and promoting Chinese culture and the arts by their appointment as recipients of national medals and national honorary titles in the name of the state. The President and General Secretary is the presiding officer of the awarding ceremony, which usually is held in the Great Hall of the People days before National Day itself.  National flag-raising ceremony  For many years, the 6 a.m. National Day flag-raising ceremony is the more important act on years without any anniversary parades. Held at the Tiananmen Square, since 2017 the Beijing Garrison Honor Guard Battalion's Color Guard Company is present for the ceremony with the National Marching Band of the PLA. Until 2016 the Beijing People's Armed Police units provided men for the ceremonial color guard. The ceremony is open to the general public and tourists and is widely televised.  National civil-military parade  Marshal Lin Biao surveying the soldiers during the 10th anniversary military parade in 1959. The extraordinary special civil-military parade of the People's Liberation Army, People's Armed Police and the Militia together with representatives of the people of all walks of life including the Young Pioneers of China is held on special years in the morning of National Day itself. It has since 1984 been televised on China Central Television since 1984 (and broadcast around the world from that year as well via satellite and cable television), is a key highlight of the national celebrations in Beijing. Since the parade of 1950, parades have been held on National Day every 10 years (a format which began in 1999) while there were formerly yearly parades held until 1959 when the CPC decided that the holiday would be celebrated \\"with frugality\\". The parade is overseen by the paramount leader in his political duty as General Secretary of the Communist Party of China and constitutional mandate as President of the People's Republic of China, as well as military leadership as the Chairman of the Central Military Commission.

The story revolves around Bobby as he deals with his 'disease,' tries to get back to normal, and even befriends a blind girl. The title is apparently taken from Hebrews 11:1, \\"Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen\\" in the King James Version of the Bible. The book was originally released in 2002 by Philomel Books, an imprint of Penguin Group, but was re-released in 2006 as a platinum edition by Puffin. The platinum edition includes a short interview with Andrew Clements and a redesigned cover. This book was followed by two sequels, Things Hoped For and Things That Are. Plot Robert Phillips, known by his nickname \\"Bobby,\\" wakes up one day to find that he can no longer see himself. Then, to make sure he was right he looked in the mirror and could not see himself. Upon discovery, he heads downstairs and tries to convince his parents that it's not a trick. He drinks a glass of orange juice, which to the astonishment of his parents, seems to make a \\"spoon float in the air.\\" After a brief argument with his mother, Bobby is told to stay at home until his parents get back from work (his mother is an English professor, and his father a scientist). After his parents are gone, Bobby heads to the library, bundled up to conceal his secret invisible self, and after a brief walk around, he hurriedly leaves, bumping into a girl. His scarf comes off so he's scared she will freak out. He helps to retrieve her things, and realizes she's blind when he hands her back her cane. Upon returning home, he gets in trouble because he left the house. His parents leave to get dinner and Bobby watches TV and takes a nap. When he wakes up, the TV says that there was a major three-car crash. He sees one of the cars is his family's car. The police then come to his door and check on him. After they leave Bobby goes to the hospital to see his parents. When he gets there he takes off his clothes (so he can be invisible) and goes to find his parents. He can only find his Mom. After talking to his Mom he uses money she gave him to get a taxi and he goes home. He returns to the library the next day. He goes naked this time, and stumbles upon the blind girl in a listening room. He enters the room with her permission and they start talking. He learns that her name is Alicia, and befriends her. Part of Bobby's journey to become visible involves invading the Sears-Roebuck corporate headquarters. During which he steals a list of names of people who previously complained to Sears-Roebuck about a \\"bad blanket.\\" Bobby uses this list to locate Sheila Borden, who became invisible a few years prior to the events in the book. She tells him never to tell anyone who she is. Bobby tells Alicia, however. Later Bobby instant messages Alicia. Bobby wants to give up on finding a cure, but Alicia has a bright idea. She tells him that two negatives make a positive. So, if he gets his blanket and sleeps with it, his problem will probably be reversed. Bobby crawls under the blanket. He awakens to find several loud voices. Ms. Phillips, his mother, and a random agent come into his room. Bobby doesn't realize that he is visible now, with several people staring at him naked. He quickly covers up. And his mom says that he came back from his extended trip to Florida the night before. His dad is happy that he is back, but is mad he didn't think before acting. Later he goes to tell Alicia the news. She doesn't take it well, feeling that Bobby will leave her alone now that he can go to school. Bobby goes home and tries to instant message her. Finally, she replies with an e-mail and a poem. Bobby goes over to her house to tell her how much he loves her.

Gulbenkian Museum in Lisbon. Ren√© Lalique, sketch for the Peacock brooch. Gulbenkian Museum in Lisbon. Art jewelry is one of the names given to jewelry created by studio craftspeople. As the name suggests, art jewelry emphasizes creative expression and design, and is characterized by the use of a variety of materials, often commonplace or of low economic value. In this sense, it forms a counterbalance to the use of \\"precious materials\\" (such as gold, silver and gemstones) in conventional or fine jewelry, where the value of the object is tied to the value of the materials from which it is made. Art jewelry is related to studio craft in other media such as glass, wood, plastics and clay; it shares beliefs and values, education and training, circumstances of production, and networks of distribution and publicity with the wider field of studio craft. Art jewelry also has links to fine art and design. While the history of art jewelry usually begins with modernist jewelry in the United States in the 1940s, followed by the artistic experiments of German goldsmiths in the 1950s, a number of the values and beliefs that inform art jewelry can be found in the arts and crafts movement of the late nineteenth century. Many regions, such as North America, Europe, Australasia and parts of Asia have flourishing art jewelry scenes, while other places such as South America and Africa have been developing the infrastructure of teaching institutions, dealer galleries, writers, collectors and museums that sustain art jewelry.  Terminology  Lalique \\"Thistle\\" pendant Art historian Liesbeth den Besten has identified six different terms to name art jewelry, including contemporary, studio, art, research, design, and author,Den Besten, Liesbeth, On Jewellery: A Compendium of International Contemporary Art Jewellery, Arnoldsche, 2011, pp 9-10 with the three most common being contemporary, studio, and art. Curator Kelly L'Ecuyer has defined studio jewelry as an offshoot of the studio craft movement, adding that it does not refer to particular artistic styles but rather to the circumstances in which the object is produced. According to her definition, \\"Studio jewelers are independent artists who handle their chosen materials directly to make one-of- a-kind or limited production jewelry..... The studio jeweler is both the designer and fabricator of each piece (although assistants or apprentices may help with technical tasks), and the work is created in a small, private studio, not a factory.\\"L'Ecuyer, Kelly, \\"Introduction: Defining the field\\", in L'Ecuyer, Kelly (ed.), Jewelry By Artists in the Studio, MFA Publications, 2010, p 17 Art historian Monica Gaspar has explored the temporal meaning of the different names given to art jewelry over the past 40 years. She suggests that \\"avant-garde\\" jewelry positions itself as radically ahead of mainstream ideas; \\"modern\\" or \\"modernist\\" jewelry claims to reflect the spirit of the times in which it was made; \\"studio\\" jewelry emphasizes the artist studio over the craft workshop; \\"new\\" jewelry assumes an ironic stance towards the past; and \\"contemporary\\" jewelry claims the present and the \\"here and now\\" in contrast with traditional jewelry's eternal nature as an heirloom passing between generations.Gaspar, Monica, \\"Contemporary jewellery in post-historical times\\", in Maria Cristina Borgesio (ed.), Time Tales, Preziosa, 2007, pp 12-14 The art historian Maribel Koniger argues that the names given to art jewelry are important in order to distinguish this type of jewelry from related objects and practices. The use of the term \\"conceptual\\" jewelry is, in her words, an \\"attempt to detach oneself through terminology from the products of the commercial jewellery industry that reproduce cliches and are oriented towards the tastes of mass consumption on the one hand, and, on the other, the individualistic, subjectively aestheticising designs of pure craft.\\"Maribel Koniger, \\"A class of its own\\", in Florian Hufnagl (ed.), The Fat Booty of Madness, Arnoldsche, 2008, p 32  Critique of preciousness  Art jewelers often work in a critical or conscious way with the history of jewelry, or to the relationship between jewelry and the body, and they question concepts like \\"preciousness\\" or \\"wearability\\" that are usually accepted without question by conventional or fine jewelry. This quality is a product of the critique of preciousness, or the challenge of art jewelers in the United States and Europe to the idea that jewelry's value was equivalent to the preciousness of its materials. Initially, art jewelers worked in precious or semi-precious materials, but emphasized artistic expression as the most important quality of their work, linking their jewelry to modernist art movements such as biomorphism, primitivism and tachisme.Greenbaum, Toni, \\"The studio jewelry movement: 1940-80 - Roots and results\\", in Susan Grant Lewin (ed.), One of a Kind: American Art Jewelry Today, Abrams, 1994, pp 34-37 In the 1960s, art jewelers began to introduce new, alternative materials into their work, such as aluminium and acrylics, breaking with the historical role of jewelry as a sign of status and economic value or portable wealth.Dormer, Peter, and Turner, Ralph, The New Jewelry: Trends + Traditions, Thames & Hudson, 1985, p 11 As the focus on value gave way, other themes took its place as the subject of jewelry. Writing in 1995, Peter Dormer described the effects of the critique of preciousness as follows: \\"First, the monetary value of the material becomes irrelevant; second, once the value of jewelry as a status symbol had been deflated, the relation between the ornament and the human body once again assumed a dominant position - jewelry became body-conscious; third, jewelry lost its exclusiveness to one sex or age - it could be worn by men, women and children.\\"Dormer, Peter, \\"The new movement\\", in Drutt English, Helen W, and Dormer, Peter, Jewelry of Our Time: Art, Ornament and Obsession, Thames & Hudson, 1995, p 24  Arts and crafts jewelry  Necklace Ren√© Jules Lalique The art jewelry that emerged in the first years of the twentieth century was a reaction to Victorian taste, and the heavy and ornate jewelry, often machine manufactured, that was popular in the nineteenth century. According to Elyse Zorn Karlin, \\"For most jewelers, art jewelry was a personal artistic quest as well as a search for a new national identity. Based on a combination of historical references, reactions to regional and world events, newly available materials and other factors, art jewelry reflected a country's identity while at the same time being part of a larger international movement of design reform.\\"Karlin, Elyse Zorn, \\"Early twentieth-century art jewelry\\", in Skinner, Damian (ed.), Contemporary Jewelry in Perspective, Lark Books, 2013, p 86 Initially art jewelry appealed to a select group of clients with artistic taste, but it was quickly picked up by commercial firms, making it widely available. There are many different movements that contributed to the category of art jewelry as we know it today. As part of the English Arts and Crafts movement, flourishing between 1860 and 1920, Charles Robert Ashbee and his Guild and School of Handicraft produced the earliest arts and crafts jewelry in a guild setting. Presenting their work as an antidote to industrial production, the first generation of arts and crafts jewelers believed that an object should be designed and made by the same person, although their lack of specialist training meant that much of this jewelry has an appealing handmade quality.Karlin, pp 87-8 Responding to changes in fashion, as well as the Victorian taste for wearing sets, arts and crafts jewelers made pendants, necklaces, brooches, belt buckles, cloak clasps and hair combs that were worn solo. Arts and crafts jewelry also tended to favor materials with little intrinsic value that could be used for their artistic effects. Base metals, semi-precious stones like opals, moonstones and turquoise, misshapen pearls, glass and shell, and the plentiful use of Vitreous enamel, allowed jewelers to be creative and to produce affordable objects.Karlin, pp 89-90 Art nouveau jewelry from France and Belgium was also an important contributor to art jewelry. Worn by wealthy and artistically-literate clients, including courtesans of the Paris demimonde, art nouveau jewelry by Rene Lalique and Alphonse Mucha was inspired by symbolist art, literature and music, and a revival of the curvilinear and dramatic forms of the rococo period. As Elyse Zorn Karlin suggests, \\"The result was jewels of staggering beauty and imagination, sensual, sexual and beguiling, and at times even frightening. These jewels were a far cry from the symmetrical and somewhat placid designs of Arts and Crafts jewelry, which more closely resembled Renaissance jewels.\\"Karlin, p 91 Lalique and other art nouveau jewelers quite often mixed precious metals and gemstones with inexpensive materials, and favored plique- a-jour and cabochon enamel techniques. Other important centers of art jewelry production included the Wiener Werkstatte in Vienna, where the architects Josef Hoffmann and Koloman Moser designed jewelry in silver and semi-precious stones, sometimes to be worn with clothing also created by the workshop. The Danish Sk√∏nvirke (aesthetic work) movement, of which Georg Jensen is the most famous example, favored silver and native Scandinavian stones and an aesthetic that falls somewhere between the tenets of art nouveau and arts and crafts. Art jewelry in Finland was characterized by a Viking revival, coinciding with its political freedom on Sweden in 1905, while modernisme in Spain followed the lead of art nouveau jewelers. Art jewelry was also practiced in Italy, Russia and the Netherlands.Karlin, pp 93-6 In the United States, arts and crafts jewelry was popular with amateurs, since unlike ceramics, furniture or textiles, it required only a modest investment in tools, and could be made in the kitchen.Janet Koplos and Bruce Metcalf, Makers: A History of American Studio Craft, University of North Carolina Press, 2010, p 63 One of the first American arts and crafts jewelers, Madeline Yale Wynne, was self-taught and approached her jewelry as form and composition with the emphasis on aesthetic qualities rather than skill, stating that \\"I consider each effort by itself as regards color and form much as I would paint a picture.\\"W. Scott Braznell, \\"Madeline Yale Wynne\\", in Wendy Kaplan (ed.), \\"The Art That Is Life\\": The Arts and Crafts Movement in America, 1875-1920, Little, Brown, 1987, p 65 Brainerd Bliss Thresher, another American arts and crafts jeweler, used materials like carved horn and amethyst for their aesthetic qualities, following the example of Ren√© Lalique who mixed quotidian and precious materials in his jewelry. As Janet Koplos and Bruce Metcalf suggest, whereas the British Arts and Crafts movement tried to reunite art and labor, many upper-class Americans like Thresher united art and leisure: \\"The practice of craft as a recreation could be a relief from the pressure of a difficult job, a demonstration of one's good taste and savor vivre, a polite manifestation of progressive politics, or an expression of the sheer pleasure of satisfying labor.\\"Koplos and Metcalf, p 65 Art jewelry fell out of style in the 1920s and 30s, overshadowed by art deco, as well as audience response to its functional and aesthetically challenging nature (too fragile and outrageous). However, it marks a significant break with what came before, and laid down many of the values and attitudes for later twentieth century ideals of art or studio jewelry. As Elyse Zorn Karlin writes, \\"Art jewelry valued the handmade and prized innovative thinking and creative expression. These jewelers were the first to use materials that didn't have the intrinsic value expected in jewelry, and they rejected mainstream jewelry tastes. They thought of their work as an artistic pursuit and made it for a small audience that shared their aesthetic and conceptual values.\\"Karlin, p 97  Modernist jewelry  \\"Sparkling Vortex\\", necklace by Marc Lange, 2007. Made of titanium, zirconium, yellow and white gold, and set with diamonds. The history of art jewelry is tied to the emergence of modernist jewelry in urban centers of the United States in the 1940s. According to Toni Greenbaum, \\"Beginning about 1940, a revolutionary jewelry movement began to emerge in the United States, and this was then spurred on by the devastation of World War II, the trauma of the Holocaust, the fear of the bomb, the politics of prejudice, the sterility of industrialization, and the crassness of commercialism.\\"Greenbaum, Toni, Mesengers of Modernism: American Studio Jewelry 1940-1960, Flammarion, 1996, p 15 Modernist jewelry shops and studios sprung up in New York City (Frank Rebajes, Paul Lobel, Bill Tendler, Art Smith, Sam Kramer and Jules Brenner in Greenwich Village; and Ed Wiener, Irena Brynner and Henry Steig in midtown Manhattan) and the Bay Area on the West Coast (Margaret De Patta, Peter Macchiarini, merry renk, Irena Brynner, Francis Sperisen and Bob Winston). The audience for modernist jewelry was the liberal, intellectual fringe of the middle class, who also supported modern art. Art historian Blanche Brown describes the appeal of this work: \\"About 1947 I went to Ed Wiener's shop and bought one of his silver square-spiral pins . . . because it looked great, I could afford it and it identified me with the group of my choice - aesthetically aware, intellectually inclined and politically progressive. That pin (or one of a few others like it) was our badge and we wore it proudly. It celebrated the hand of the artist rather than the market value of the material.\\"Brown, Blanche, \\"Ed Wiener to me\\", in Jewelry By Ed Wiener, Fifty/50 Gallery, 1988, p 13 In 1946 the Museum of Modern Art in New York organized the exhibition Modern Handmade Jewelry, which included the work of studio jewelers like Margaret De Patta and Paul Lobel, along with jewelry by modernist artists such as Alexander Calder, Jacques Lipchitz and Richard Pousette-Dart.L'Ecuyer, Kelly, \\"North America\\", in Skinner, Damian (ed.), Contemporary Jewelry in Perspective, Lark Books, 2013, p 117 This exhibition toured the United States, and was followed by a series of influential exhibitions at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis.Schon, Marbeth, \\"The Wearable Art Movement Part I\\", Modern Silver Website. http://www.modernsilver.com/Walkerarticle.htm Kelly L'Ecuyer suggests that \\"Calder's jewelry was central to many of the museum and gallery exhibitions of this period, and he continues to be viewed as the seminal figure in American contemporary jewelry.\\"L'Ecuyer, p 117 Using cold construction and crude techniques that suggested a spirit of improvisation and creativity, Calder's jewelry shares his sculpture's use of line and movement to depict or imply space, creating jewelry that often moves with the wearer's body. A strong connection with art movements is a characteristic of American art jewelry during this period. While Calder showed a primitivist interest in African and ancient Greek art, Margaret De Patta made jewelry that was constructivist, manipulating light, space and optical perception according to the lessons she learned from L√°szl√≥ Moholy-Nagy at the New Bauhaus in Chicago.L'Ecuyer, p 118 Toni Greenbaum writes that \\"After his mentor, the painter John Haley, showed him work by Matisse and Picasso, Bob Winston exclaimed: 'That's the kind of crap I'm doing!'.\\"Greenbaum, p 40 The materials of modernist jewelry - organic and inorganic non-precious substances, as well as found objects - correlate to cubist, futurist and dadaist attitudes, while the styles of modernist jewelry - surrealism, primitivism, biomorphism and constructivism - are fine art movements as well.Greenbaum, p 27-43  Art jewelry since 1960  The postwar growth of jewelry in the United States was supported by the concept that jewelry-making techniques, believed to strengthen hand and arm muscles and foster eye-hand coordination, played a role in physical therapy programs for veterans of World War II. The War Veterans' Art Center at the Museum of Modern Art, led by Victor D'Amico, the School for American Craftsman, and the workshops run by Margret Craver in New York City, addressed the needs of returning American servicemen, while the GI Bill of Rights offered free college tuition for veterans, many of whom studied craft.Greenbaum, pp 24-25 As Kelly L'Ecuyer suggests, \\"In addition to individual creativity, the proliferation of craft-based education and therapy for soldiers and veterans in the United States during and after the war provided a stimulus for all studio crafts, especially jewelry and metalsmithing. Public and private resources devoted to veterans' craft programs planted the seeds for longer-lasting educational structures and engineered broad interest in craft as a creative, fulfilling lifestyle.\\"L'Ecuyer, p 49 By the early 1960s, graduates of these programs were not only challenging the conventional ideas of jewelry, but teaching a new generation of American jewelers in new university programs in jewelry and metalsmithing courses.Strauss, Cindi, \\"A brief history of contemporary jewelry, 1960-2006\\", in Cindi Strauss (ed.), Ornament As Art: Avant-Garde Jewelry From the Helen William Drutt Collection, Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, 2007, p 17 Architectonic jewellery was being developed around the same time. In the 1960s‚Äî1970s, the German government and commercial jewelry industry fostered and heavily supported modern jewelry designers, thus creating a new marketplace. They combined contemporary design with traditional goldsmithing and jewelry making. Orfevre, the first gallery for art jewelry, opened in Duesseldorf, Germany, in 1965.

Museum of Arts and Design and ACC Editions, 2009 was fostered in the United States very quickly after World War II by major museums such as the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, each of which held major shows of art jewelry in the 1940s. The Museum of Arts and Design formerly The American Craft Museum, started their collection in 1958 with pieces dating from the 1940s. Other museums whose collections include work by contemporary (American) jewelry designers include: the Cleveland Museum of Art, The Corning Museum of Glass, the Mint Museum of Craft & Design in Charlotte, NC, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, and the Renwick Gallery of the Smithsonian museum. Some famous artists who created art jewelry in the past were Calder, Picasso, Man Ray, Meret Oppenheim, Dal√≠ and Nevelson. Some of which represented at Sculpture to Wear Gallery in New York City which closed in 1977. Artwear Gallery owned by Robert Lee Morris continued in this endeavor to showcase jewelry as an art form. A collection of art jewelry can be found at the Schmuckmuseum in Pforzheim, Germany.

Favoring sandy areas near rocky reefs and gullies, it is an active-swimming species that usually stays close to the bottom. This robust shark reaches in length and has characteristically large, rounded fins; the pectoral fins in particular are broad and sickle-shaped in adults. It also has a short, blunt snout and long furrows around its mouth. This species is gray or bronze in color above, with variable amounts of black spotting. Mainly active at night, the sharptooth houndshark feeds mostly on crustaceans, bony fishes, and cephalopods. It has been observed gathering in groups in shallow water during summertime, possibly for reproductive purposes. This species is aplacental viviparous, meaning that the unborn young are sustained mainly by yolk. Females give birth to 6‚Äì12 pups between late May and August, on a 2- or 3-year cycle. The sharptooth houndshark is often hooked by recreational anglers, and some are also captured on commercial bottom longlines. Because of its small range and low growth and reproductive rates, it is very vulnerable to overfishing. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed this species as least concern. Taxonomy and phylogeny The illustration that accompanied Smith's original species description Scottish zoologist Andrew Smith originally described the sharptooth houndshark as a species of Mustelus in 1839, as part of his work Illustrations of the Zoology of South Africa. His account was based on two specimens caught off the Cape of Good Hope, South Africa. Smith named the shark megalopterus, from the Greek mega (\\"large\\") and pteron (\\"wing\\"), referring to its large fins. Another common name for this shark is \\"sweet William\\". Later authors have reassigned the sharptooth houndshark to the genus Triakis, more specifically to the subgenus Cazon alongside the sharpfin houndshark (T. acutipinna) and the spotted houndshark (T. maculata). A 2006 phylogenetic study by J. Andr√©s L√≥pez and colleagues, based on four protein-coding gene sequences, found that this species did not group with the leopard shark (T. semifasciata). Instead, the flapnose houndshark (Scylliogaleus quecketti) and it formed a clade within the Mustelus lineage. This result suggests that the two subgenera of Triakis‚ÄîCazon and Triakis‚Äîmay not be closely related, which would warrant a redefinition of the genus. Description The sharptooth houndshark is a stout-bodied species with a short, thick, and blunt snout. The nostrils are widely spaced and preceded by lobe-like flaps of skin that do not reach the mouth. The horizontally oval eyes have ridges underneath and are equipped with nictitating membranes. The large mouth bears long, deep furrows at the corners, with those on the lower jaw almost meeting in the middle. The teeth are small and tightly packed to form pavement-like surfaces. Each tooth has a rounded, molar-like base that rises to a sharp, upright central cusp; rarely, a pair of barely developed lateral cusplets may also be present. Five pairs of gill slits are found. The fins are distinctively large and rounded at the tips. The pectoral fins of adults are broad and falcate (sickle-shaped). The dorsal fins have nearly vertical trailing margins, with the first originating over the pectoral fin rear tips. The second dorsal fin is about three-quarters as high as the first. The anal fin is much smaller than the second dorsal fin and originates well behind it. The short, thick caudal peduncle lacks notches at the caudal fin origins. The caudal fin has a small but well-defined lower lobe and a longer upper lobe with a ventral notch near the tip. The skin is often loose. This species is dark gray to bronze above and white below. Young sharks are mostly unmarked, while adults vary from plain to densely covered with irregular black spots. It may reach in length and in weight. Females grow larger than males. Distribution and habitat Sharptooth houndsharks gathering in a gully at Garden Route, South Africa The range of the sharptooth houndshark is limited to the coastal waters of southern Africa, from southern Angola to the Eastern Cape (or rarely KwaZulu-Natal) in South Africa. This locally common species inhabits sandy habitats such as bays; it can be found from the surf zone to a depth of , but the majority is found no deeper than . It generally swims just barely above the bottom, favoring flat areas near rocky reefs or gullies, and seldom rises into open water. Biology and ecology The crab Plagusia chabrus is the most important food source for sharptooth houndsharks off South Africa. The sharptooth houndshark is a highly active species, though it can sometimes be found resting inside rocky crevices. It mainly hunts at night and has been known to pursue prey almost onto the shore. The pointed cusps of its teeth allow it to grasp slippery prey, while their broad bases allow it to crush hard-shelled prey. This shark feeds on a variety of crustaceans (crabs, slipper lobsters, and spiny lobsters), bony fishes (including morwongs, sea catfishes, drums, and porgies), and cephalopods (in particular Octopus vulgaris). Sharks and rays (including catsharks and guitarfishes) and their egg capsules are a minor food source for larger individuals. Off South Africa, the most important prey species is the crab Plagusia chabrus. Its dietary composition changes with age; young sharks under long subsist almost completely on crabs, while larger sharks consume more bony fishes and cephalopods, as well as a greater variety of prey overall. This shark has been observed deviating from its nocturnal habits to feed on chokka squid (Loligo reynaudii) during their mass spawnings. The broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus) is known to prey on this species. During the summer, the sharptooth houndshark forms groups in shallow water. These aggregations are particularly well-documented in False Bay and may be related to reproduction, given the presence of many pregnant females. It is aplacental viviparous, with the developing embryos nourished mainly by yolk. Mature females have a single functional ovary and two functional uteri. Litters of 6‚Äì12 pups are birthed between late May and August, following a gestation period of some 20 months. Larger females tend to produce larger litters. The length at birth has been variously estimated as and by different sources; pups within a single litter may vary in size by up to 30%. Females apparently reproduce either every two or three years, depending on whether she has ovarian eggs developing during the pregnancy that would allow her to mate again within a few months of giving birth. The sharptooth houndshark is a slow-growing species, with both sexes following a similar growth pattern. Males mature sexually at long and 11‚Äì13 years of age, while females mature sexually at long and 15‚Äì16 years of age. The maximum lifespan is at least 25 years. Human interactions Harmless to humans, the sharptooth houndshark adapts well to captivity and has been displayed in public aquariums. It is frequently caught by recreational anglers from shore or ski-boats; it is edible but rarely eaten. Small numbers are also caught incidentally by a commercial demersal longline fishery targeting the school shark (Galeorhinus galeus) in the Gansbaai and False Bay region. The meat from sharks caught in the fishery is either made into biltong or jerky and sold locally, or exported fresh or frozen to Italy and Taiwan. Although in South Africa, the sharptooth houndshark is listed as a noncommercial species, thus cannot be harvested commercially, it is often mistaken for the common smooth- hound (Mustelus mustelus) by fishers. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed the sharptooth houndshark as least concern. This species is highly susceptible to even moderate levels of fishing pressure, due to its restricted range, slow growth rate, and low fecundity. The fact that most sharks caught by fishers are immature is an additional source of concern.

He began his professional career by signing with the San Francisco 49ers as an undrafted free agent in 2003, and has also spent one year of his career in Europe with the Frankfurt Galaxy. He has played for the Philadelphia Eagles for six seasons starting in 2006. He played college football at Texas Tech after transferring from El Camino Junior College. Early years Hanson's parents are John, a musician, and Yolanda, an opera singer. He attended St. Bernard High School in California and was a letterman in football. After not even starting as a junior, he helped lead his team to the state finals as a senior. College career Hanson first played college football at El Camino Junior College, before transferring to Texas Tech for his final two years. He also received interest from Illinois and Arkansas. At Texas Tech, he majored in human development and family studies. Professional career San Francisco 49ers After not being selected in the 2003 NFL Draft, Hanson was signed by the San Francisco 49ers as an undrafted free agent. He did not make the final roster as a rookie, but was retained on the team's practice squad through the regular season. In 2004 he made the active roster and went on to play in 13 games that year, starting three of them. He registered 18 solo tackles, two assists, six pass deflections and a sack. Hanson remained a member of the 49ers through the 2005 offseason, but was cut prior to the beginning of the regular season. Frankfurt Galaxy After his release from the 49ers, Hanson was not picked up by another NFL team and chose to spend a season in Europe with the Frankfurt Galaxy, after they drafted him in the 6th round of the league's free agent draft. The Galaxy won the league championship in his first and only year with the team. Philadelphia Eagles In 2006, shortly after the conclusion of the NFL Europe season, Hanson was signed to a two-year contract by the Philadelphia Eagles. That season, Hanson played in all sixteen games for Philadelphia, starting one, garnering 26 solo tackles, nine assists, and thirteen pass deflections. In 2007 season, he again played in all sixteen games, starting four, and made 45 solo tackles and seven assists, along with a sack and a fumble recovery. This earned him a one-year contract for the 2008 season. Hanson's number was changed from 22 to 21 during the 2008 offseason, due to Asante Samuel signing with the team. On the Thanksgiving night game against the Arizona Cardinals, Hanson started in place of an injured Samuel and recorded his first career interception. In week 17 against the Dallas Cowboys, he returned a fumble 97 yards for his first career touchdown, as part of a victory that sent the Eagles to the playoffs. On February 20, 2009, Hanson agreed to a five-year contract with the Eagles, worth $21 million. He was scheduled to become an unrestricted free agent the following week. On November 11, 2009 it was announced that Hanson was to be suspended for the next four games of the season due to failing a drug test before the NFC Championship the previous season. On December 7, Hanson had his suspension lifted, and was able to play on the active roster for the remainder of the season. Hanson was released on September 3, 2011, during final roster cuts. Hanson was re-signed to a two- year contract by the Eagles on September 7, 2011. He was released again during final roster cuts on August 31, 2012.

His tenure was a period of turmoil in the Malankara Syrian Church. When the Anglican Missionaries of Low Church tried to interfere in the faith and administration of the Malankara church, the Church severed its relations with the Anglican missionaries through the historic Mavelikkara Synod of 1936. A negligible number of the members of the Church joined the C.M.S. Church. Remaining members were divided into two factions, one upholding the received traditions of the Church, and the other in support of a reformation based on Anglican principles as propagated during the missionary activity of the Church Mission Society (CMS). Early life Philipose Dionysius was born in 1781 at the Aanjilimootil family in Pallippad, a place near Cheppad. Cheppad is a scenic village located at Karthikapally Taluk of Alapuzha district in Kerala State, India. It is halfway between Kochi and Thiruvananthapuram on the National Highway 47. Malankara Metropolitan  Punnathara Dionysius Metropolitan (Dionysius III) died 17 May 1825. To select a successor, representatives of the parishes met together at Pallikara palli under the leadership of Philixinos II of Thozhyoor Church who was the Acting Malankara metropolitan at that time when the throne was vacant. The names of Cheppad Anjilimootil Philipose Malpan, Kalloopara Adangapurathu Joseph Malpan and Kottayam Eruthickal Markose Kathanar were proposed. Eruthickal Markose Kathanar withdrew his candidacy during the process and that left 2 strong contesters. After prayer, they cast lots (cleromancy), and the lot fell to Philipose Malpan. The title Malpan represents for those who teach in the Theological Seminary. Adangapurathu Joseph Malpan later became the Vicar General of 72 Parishes at Malankara Syrian Church. Ittup Rampan Malpan (the Senior person among the 3 teachers of the Seminary \\"Ittup Rampan- who became Malankara Metropolitan as Dionysius II\\", \\"Adangapurathu Joseph Malpan\\", \\"Punnathra Kurien Malplan\\") was the source for the Orthodox Seminary \\"Old Seminary\\", as he took the initiative to submit an application to the proper authority in AD 1813, and the construction was completed in AD 1815. Palakkunnathu Abraham Malpan joined the Seminary at a later stage to teach Syriac language there. At first, there were only 5 students, and in the following years the number of students grew significantly. Back then the Angamali Seminary was also available for Syrian Orthodox Church to educate students from the northern part of Malankara. Philipose Ramban was consecrated by Geevarghese Philexenos (Kidangan) of the Malabar Independent Syrian Church on 27 August 1825 at Kottayam Cheria palli.Alex Mathew. Kalloopara parish history. Page 112. Philipose Ramban was given the episcopal title Cheppad Philipose Dionysius. He was the fourth bishop in the Malankara Church to get this title Dionysius  Consecrations In 1829, Dionysius IV consecrated Geevarghese Koorilose (Kuthoorey) (1829‚Äì56), as the Metropolitan of Thozhyoor church. Obstacles During His Reign Problems with C.M.S. Missionaries The relation between the missionaries who came from England was cordial during the first few years. But soon they began to interfere in the internal affairs of the church. They tried to change the liturgy and practices of the Malankara church to their system. Without permission, they began worshipping using Anglican liturgy in Old Seminary chapel. A letter from the bishop of Calcutta in 1835 suggested #to ordain only those who completed their studies from the Seminary and received the certificate from the Principal, #to raise a fund to increase the salary of the priests, #to submit the accounts of the Church every year to the British Resident for annual auditing and #to conduct the church services in vernacular, Malayalam. The Metropolitan rejected all these suggestions outright.Ittoop writer. (1869) History of Syrian Christians of Malabar. Page 228. Soon Dionysius convened a meeting of the representatives of the parishes at Mavelikara (16 January 1836) and officially rejected the suggestions of the Anglican Bishop, stating that decisions on such a matter pertaining to faith was within the ambit of the Patriarch of Antioch.Mavelikara Padiola (Decisions of Mavelikara meeting) First sentence of the original Malayalam version. It has to be noted that even though the Association rejected those suggestions then, each of them was implemented in the Malankara Church in time. It can be concluded that the reason behind the rejection of the suggestions of the Anglican Bishop was that the Church was ready to accept timely changes only with the consent of an established authority & within a disciplined structure, and not simply based on a demanding letter from a Bishop of a foreign Church. Soon the C.M.S. missionaries formed the C.M.S. Church. By a government award known as Cochin Award, they were given a few properties of the Malankara Church. The Association at Mavelikara gave official recognition to the Patriarch of Antioch as the spiritual head of the Malankara Church. Hence, it was at this time Malankara Church came to be referred to as Jacobite Church. Problems with Abraham Malpan Abraham Malpan, Mamalaserry Konattu Malpan and Idavazhikkal Philipose Kathanar were fined by the government for receiving ordination a second time from Athanasius. Athanasius had travelled to Turkey without the permission of the general assembly of the Church to get ordination as a bishop. Dionysius IV did not support reformation movement initiated by Abraham Malpan and his supporters. Abraham Malpan did not attend the Mavelikara Synod of 1836. When Abraham Malpan used the revised liturgy and brought about changes in practices, that offended and disappointed Dionysius IV, and suspended Malpan from religious duties & refused priesthood to the deacons trained under him.George Kassessa, Rev.M.C. (1919). Palakunnathu Abraham Malpan. (Biography in Malaylam) Page 42. Dionysius remained staunch in his stand of upholding the traditional faith and liturgy of the Church. Palakunnathu Deacon Mathews, a deacon trained under Abraham Malpan and was his nephew; through Malpan's canniness and spiritual nurturing and without the permission of the Bishop, he went to Antioch. He was consecrated with the episcopal title Mathews Athanasius by Patriarch of Antioch, Ignatius Elias II (1838‚Äì47), in 1843. In 1846, the Patriarch sent a Metropolitan Euyakim Kurilos to Malankara. In 1852 Dionysius IV abdicated due to poor health.Royal proclamation of 30 August 1852, in favour of Mathews Athanasius. At this time it was necessary for the government to find the successor of Dionysius for the purpose of paying the interest to a fixed deposit (Vattipanam) with the government. Mathews Athanasius and Kurilos made claims. The Maharajah of Travancore appointed a committee of four senior government officers (known as Kollam Panchayat), They decided that a foreign bishop could not be regarded as the Malankara Metropolitan. So the Maharajah issued a proclamation in favour of Mathews Athanasius on 30 August 1852. Even though Athanasius lacked the support of the general assembly of the Church (Malankara Palli-Yogam), the fact that he was a native favoured him. Last days After abdicating, Valia Methrachen (Dionysius IV) was bedridden due to ill health. The people who were with him all these years left him for the changes that had happened. When Mathews Athanasious become aware of this he immediately came to Cheppadu and had done all things necessary for Cheppadu thirumeni. He stayed with him for more than two months and he arranged aide and medical help from Thiruvalla. On 9 October 1855, Cheppad Philipose Dionysius died and was laid to rest at Cheppad Valiya palli (St. George Orthodox Church). The last ceremonies were done by Mathews Athanasious. The Church remembers Dionysius on 12 October.

Air conditioning can be used in both domestic and commercial environments. This process is most commonly used to achieve a more comfortable interior environment, typically for humans and other animals; however, air conditioning is also used to cool and dehumidify rooms filled with heat-producing electronic devices, such as computer servers, power amplifiers, and to display and store some delicate products, such as artwork. Air conditioners often use a fan to distribute the conditioned air to an enclosed space such as a building or a car to improve thermal comfort and indoor air quality. Electric refrigerant-based AC units range from small units that can cool a small bedroom, which can be carried by a single adult, to massive units installed on the roof of office towers that can cool an entire building. The cooling is typically achieved through a refrigeration cycle, but sometimes evaporation or free cooling is used. Air conditioning systems can also be made based on desiccants (chemicals which remove moisture from the air). Some AC systems reject or store heat in subterranean pipes. In construction, a complete system of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning is referred to as HVAC. As of 2018, 1.5 billion air conditioning units were installed, with the International Energy Agency expecting 5.6 billion units in use by 2050. Globally, current air conditioning accounts for 1/5 of energy usage in buildings globally, and the expected growth of the usage of air conditioning, will drive significant energy demand growth. In response to, in 2018 the United Nations called for the technology to be made more sustainable to mitigate climate change. History Evaporative cooling Since prehistoric times, snow and ice were used for cooling. The business of harvesting ice during winter and storing for use in summer became popular towards the late 17th century. This practice was replaced by mechanical ice- making machines. The basic concept behind air conditioning is said to have been applied in ancient Egypt, where reeds were hung in windows and were moistened with trickling water. The evaporation of water cooled the air blowing through the window. This process also made the air more humid, which can be beneficial in a dry desert climate. Other techniques in medieval Persia involved the use of cisterns and wind towers to cool buildings during the hot season. The 2nd-century Chinese inventor Ding Huan of the Han Dynasty invented a rotary fan for air conditioning, with seven wheels in diameter and manually powered by prisoners. In 747, Emperor Xuanzong (r. 712‚Äì762) of the Tang Dynasty (618‚Äì907) had the Cool Hall (Liang Dian ) built in the imperial palace, which the Tang Yulin describes as having water-powered fan wheels for air conditioning as well as rising jet streams of water from fountains. During the subsequent Song Dynasty (960‚Äì1279), written sources mentioned the air conditioning rotary fan as even more widely used. In the 17th century, the Dutch inventor Cornelis Drebbel demonstrated \\"Turning Summer into Winter\\" as an early form of modern air conditioning for James I of England by adding salt to water. Development of mechanical cooling Three-quarters scale model of Gorrie's ice machine at John Gorrie State Museum, Florida In 1758, Benjamin Franklin and John Hadley, a chemistry professor at Cambridge University, conducted an experiment to explore the principle of evaporation as a means to rapidly cool an object. Franklin and Hadley confirmed that evaporation of highly volatile liquids (such as alcohol and ether) could be used to drive down the temperature of an object past the freezing point of water. They conducted their experiment with the bulb of a mercury thermometer as their object and with a bellows used to speed up the evaporation. They lowered the temperature of the thermometer bulb down to while the ambient temperature was . Franklin noted that, soon after they passed the freezing point of water , a thin film of ice formed on the surface of the thermometer's bulb and that the ice mass was about thick when they stopped the experiment upon reaching . Franklin concluded: \\"From this experiment one may see the possibility of freezing a man to death on a warm summer's day.\\" In 1820, English scientist and inventor Michael Faraday discovered that compressing and liquefying ammonia could chill air when the liquefied ammonia was allowed to evaporate. In 1842, Florida physician John Gorrie used compressor technology to create ice, which he used to cool air for his patients in his hospital in Apalachicola, Florida. He hoped to eventually use his ice-making machine to regulate the temperature of buildings. He even envisioned centralized air conditioning that could cool entire cities. Though his prototype leaked and performed irregularly, Gorrie was granted a patent in 1851 for his ice-making machine. Though his process improved the artificial production of ice, his hopes for its success vanished soon afterwards when his chief financial backer died and Gorrie did not get the money he needed to develop the machine. According to his biographer, Vivian M. Sherlock, he blamed the \\"Ice King\\", Frederic Tudor, for his failure, suspecting that Tudor had launched a smear campaign against his invention. Dr. Gorrie died impoverished in 1855, and the dream of commonplace air conditioning went away for 50 years. James Harrison's first mechanical ice-making machine began operation in 1851 on the banks of the Barwon River at Rocky Point in Geelong, Australia. His first commercial ice-making machine followed in 1853, and his patent for an ether vapor compression refrigeration system was granted in 1855. This novel system used a compressor to force the refrigeration gas to pass through a condenser, where it cooled down and liquefied. The liquefied gas then circulated through the refrigeration coils and vaporized again, cooling down the surrounding system. The machine produced three tons of ice per day. Though Harrison had commercial success establishing a second ice company back in Sydney in 1860, he later entered the debate over how to compete against the American advantage of ice- refrigerated beef sales to the United Kingdom. He wrote: \\"Fresh meat frozen and packed as if for a voyage, so that the refrigerating process may be continued for any required period\\", and in 1873 prepared the sailing ship Norfolk for an experimental beef shipment to the United Kingdom. His choice of a cold room system instead of installing a refrigeration system upon the ship itself proved disastrous when the ice was consumed faster than expected. Electrical air conditioning Willis Carrier The creation of the modern electrical air conditioning unit and industry is credited to the American inventor Willis H. Carrier. After graduating from Cornell University, Carrier found a job at the Buffalo Forge Company. There, he began experimenting with air conditioning as a way to solve an application problem for the Sackett- Wilhelms Lithographing and Publishing Company in Brooklyn, New York. The first air conditioner, designed and built in Buffalo, New York by Carrier, began working on 17 July 1902. Designed to improve manufacturing process control in a printing plant, Carrier's invention controlled not only temperature but also humidity. Carrier used his knowledge of the heating of objects with steam and reversed the process. Instead of sending air through hot coils, he sent it through cold coils (filled with cold water). The air was cooled, and thereby the amount of moisture in the air could be controlled, which in turn made the humidity in the room controllable. The controlled temperature and humidity helped maintain consistent paper dimensions and ink alignment. Later, Carrier's technology was applied to increase productivity in the workplace, and The Carrier Air Conditioning Company of America was formed to meet rising demand. Over time, air conditioning came to be used to improve comfort in homes and automobiles as well. In 1906, Stuart W. Cramer of Charlotte was exploring ways to add moisture to the air in his textile mill. Cramer coined the term \\"air conditioning\\", using it in a patent claim he filed that year as an analogue to \\"water conditioning\\", then a well-known process for making textiles easier to process. He combined moisture with ventilation to \\"condition\\" and change the air in the factories, controlling the humidity so necessary in textile plants. Willis Carrier adopted the term and incorporated it into the name of his company. Shortly thereafter, the first private home to have air conditioning was built in Minneapolis in 1914, owned by Charles Gates. Realizing that air conditioning would one day be a standard feature of private homes, particularly in regions with warmer climate, David St. Pierre DuBose (1898-1994) designed a network of ductwork and vents for his home Meadowmont, all disguised behind intricate and attractive Georgian-style open moldings. This building is believed to be one of the first private homes in the United States equipped for central air conditioning. In 1945, Robert Sherman of Lynn, Massachusetts invented a portable, in-window air conditioner that cooled, heated, humidified, dehumidified, and filtered the air. By the late 1960s, most newly built residential homes in the United States had central air conditioning. Box air conditioning units during this time also became more inexpensive which resulted in greater population growth in the states of Florida and Arizona. As of 2015, nearly 100 million homes or about 87% of US households had air conditioning systems. Refrigerant development A modern R-134a hermetic refrigeration compressor The first air conditioners and refrigerators employed toxic or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that could result in fatal accidents when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the first non-flammable, non- toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion home and building comfort cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22). Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common blend used in automobiles in the U.S. until 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone- depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer manufactured in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be purchased and used by certified HVAC technicians. Modern refrigerants have been developed to be more environmentally safe than many of the early chlorofluorocarbon-based refrigerants used in the early- and mid-twentieth century. These include HCFCs (R-22, as used in most U.S. homes before 2011) and HFCs (R-134a, historically used in most cars, refrigerators and chillers) have replaced most CFC use. HCFCs, in turn, are supposed to have been in the process of being phased out under the Montreal Protocol and replaced by HFCs such as R-410A, which lack chlorine. HFCs, however, contribute to climate change problems. Moreover, policy and political influence by corporate executives resisted change.Mate, John \\"Making a Difference: A Case Study of the Greenpeace Ozone Campaign\\" RECIEL 10:2 2001.Benedick, Richard Elliot Ozone Diplomacy Cambridge, MA: Harvard University 1991. Corporations insisted that no alternatives to HFCs existed. The environmental organization Greenpeace provided funding to a former East German refrigerator company to research an alternative ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant in 1992. The company developed a hydrocarbon mix of isopentane and isobutane, but as a condition of the contract with Greenpeace could not patent the technology, which led to its widespread adoption by other firms. Their activist marketing first in Germany led to companies like Whirlpool, Bosch, and later LG and others to incorporate the technology throughout Europe, then Asia, although the corporate executives resisted in Latin America, so that it arrived in Argentina produced by a domestic firm in 2003, and then finally with giant Bosch's production in Brazil by 2004. In 1995, Germany made CFC refrigerators illegal. DuPont and other companies blocked the refrigerant in the U.S. with the U.S. EPA, disparaging the approach as \\"that German technology\\". Nevertheless, in 2004, Greenpeace worked with multinational corporations like Coca-Cola and Unilever, and later Pepsico and others, to create a corporate coalition called Refrigerants Naturally!. Then, four years later, Ben & Jerry's of Unilever and General Electric began to take steps to support production and use in the U.S. In 2011 the EPA decided in favor of the ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant for U.S. manufacture. HFCs like R-404a, R-134a and R-410a are, as of 2020, being replaced with HFO and hydrocarbon refrigerants like R-1234ze in chillers for commercial refigeration and air conditioning, R-1234yf in cars, R-32 in residential air conditioning and CO2 (R-744) in commercial refrigeration. R-600 (isobutane) is already widely used in residential refrigeration. Operating principles Refrigeration cycle A simple stylized diagram of the refrigeration cycle: 1) condensing coil, 2) expansion valve, 3) evaporator coil, 4) compressor Capillary expansion valve connection to evaporator inlet. Notice frost formation. Cooling in traditional AC systems is accomplished using the vapor-compression cycle, which uses the forced circulation and phase change of a refrigerant between gas and liquid to transfer heat. The vapor-compression cycle can occur within a unitary, or packaged piece of equipment; or within a chiller that is connected to terminal cooling equipment (such as a variable refrigerant flow terminal or fan coil unit) on its evaporator side and heat rejection equipment on its condenser side.  Heat pump  Some air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly referred to as \\"reverse cycle air conditioner\\". The heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also switches roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air). Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4‚Äì13 ¬∞C (40‚Äì55 ¬∞F), because heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is partly because ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must temporarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter. The icing problem becomes much more severe with lower outdoor temperatures, so heat pumps are commonly installed in tandem with a more conventional form of heating, such as an electrical heater, a natural gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is used instead of the heat pump during harsher winter temperatures. In this case, the heat pump is used efficiently during the milder temperatures, and the system is switched to the conventional heat source when the outdoor temperature is lower. Evaporative cooling An evaporative cooler In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the incoming air is reduced, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be quite substantial. Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for dwelling occupants. Unlike other types of air conditioners, evaporative coolers rely on the outside air to be channeled through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a house through its air duct system; this cooled outside air must be allowed to push the warmer air within the house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. These coolers cost less and are mechanically simple to understand and maintain. Free cooling Air conditioning can also be provided by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water-glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thereby declining its effectiveness. Free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage (STES) so the cold of winter can be used for summer air conditioning. Free cooling and hybrid systems are mature technology. Humidity control Since humans perspire to provide natural cooling by the evaporation of perspiration from the skin, reducing relative humidity can promote occupant comfort. An air conditioner designed for an occupied space typically will create a 30% to 60% relative humidity in the occupied space to balance comfort, microbial growth, and other indoor air quality factors. Dehumidification and cooling Air conditioning equipment will reduce the absolute humidity of the air processed by the system if the surface of the evaporator coil is significantly cooler than the dew point of the surrounding air. Moisture from the air will condense on the coil and must be disposed of or recycled. Dehumidification program Most modern air-conditioning systems feature a dehumidification cycle during which the compressor runs while the fan is slowed as much as possible to reduce the evaporator temperature and therefore condense more water. When the temperature falls below a threshold, both the fan and compressor are shut off to mitigate further temperature drops; this prevents moisture on the evaporator from being blown back into the room. When the temperature rises again, the compressor restarts and the fan returns to low speed. Occasionally, to thaw any ice produced, the fan runs with the compressor shut down; this function is less effective when ambient temperatures are low. Inverter air conditioners use the inside coil temperature sensor to keep the evaporator as cold as possible. When the evaporator is too cold, the compressor is slowed or stopped with the indoor fan running. Dehumidifier Typical portable dehumidifier A specialized air conditioner that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier. It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a standard air conditioner in that both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the same air path. A standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room because its condenser coil releases heat outside. However, since all components of the dehumidifier are in the same room, no heat energy is removed. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is actually heated, just as by an electric heater that draws the same amount of power. In addition, if water is condensed in the room, the amount of heat previously needed to evaporate that water also is re-released in the room (the latent heat of vaporization). The dehumidification process is the inverse of adding water to the room with an evaporative cooler, and instead releases heat. Therefore, an in-room dehumidifier always will warm the room and reduce the relative humidity indirectly, as well as reducing the humidity directly by condensing and removing water. Inside the unit, the air passes over the evaporator coil first, and is cooled and dehumidified. The now dehumidified, cold air then passes over the condenser coil where it is warmed up again. Then the air is released back into the room. The unit produces warm, dehumidified air and can usually be placed freely in the environment (room) that is to be conditioned. Dehumidifiers are commonly used in cold, damp climates to prevent mold growth indoors, especially in basements. They are also used to protect sensitive equipment from the adverse effects of excessive humidity in tropical countries. Energy transfer In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a standard mode of operation for modern air conditioners) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioner increase. This increase has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner removes that energy. To do so, the air conditioner must increase its power consumption by the inverse of its \\"efficiency\\" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioner's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power. It is typical for air conditioners to operate at \\"efficiencies\\" of significantly greater than 100%. However, it may be noted that the input electrical energy is of higher thermodynamic quality (lower entropy) than the output thermal energy (heat energy). Air conditioner equipment power in the U.S. is often described in terms of \\"tons of refrigeration\\", with each approximately equal to the cooling power of one short ton (2000 pounds or 907 kilograms) of ice melting in a 24-hour period. The value is defined as 12,000 BTU per hour, or 3517 watts. Residential central air systems are usually from 1 to 5 tons (3.5 to 18 kW) in capacity. Seasonal energy efficiency ratio For residential homes, some countries set minimum requirements for energy efficiency. In the United States, the efficiency of air conditioners is often (but not always) rated by the seasonal energy efficiency ratio (SEER). The higher the SEER rating, the more energy efficient is the air conditioner. The SEER rating is the BTU of cooling output during its normal annual usage divided by the total electric energy input in watt hours (W¬∑h) during the same period. : SEER = BTU √∑ (W¬∑h) this can also be rewritten as: : SEER = (BTU / h) √∑ W, where \\"W\\" is the average electrical power in Watts, and (BTU/h) is the rated cooling power. For example, a 5000 BTU/h air-conditioning unit, with a SEER of 10, would consume 5000/10 = 500 Watts of power on average. The electrical energy consumed per year can be calculated as the average power multiplied by the annual operating time: : 500 W √ó 1000 h = 500,000 W¬∑h = 500 kWh Assuming 1000 hours of operation during a typical cooling season (i.e., 8 hours per day for 125 days per year). Another method that yields the same result, is to calculate the total annual cooling output: : 5000 BTU/h √ó 1000 h = 5,000,000 BTU Then, for a SEER of 10, the annual electrical energy usage would be: : 5,000,000 BTU √∑ 10 = 500,000 W¬∑h = 500 kWh SEER is related to the coefficient of performance (COP) commonly used in thermodynamics and also to the Energy Efficiency Ratio (EER). The EER is the efficiency rating for the equipment at a particular pair of external and internal temperatures, while SEER is calculated over a whole range of external temperatures (i.e., the temperature distribution for the geographical location of the SEER test). SEER is unusual in that it is composed of an Imperial unit divided by an SI unit. The COP is a ratio with the same metric units of energy (joules) in both the numerator and denominator. They cancel out, leaving a dimensionless quantity. Formulas for the approximate conversion between SEER and EER or COP are available. : (1) SEER = EER √∑ 0.9 : (2) SEER = COP √ó 3.792 : (3) EER = COP √ó 3.413 From equation (2) above, a SEER of 13 is equivalent to a COP of 3.43, which means that 3.43 units of heat energy are pumped per unit of work energy. The United States now requires that residential systems manufactured in 2006 have a minimum SEER rating of 13 (although window-box systems are exempt from this law, so their SEER is still around 10). Installation types Window unit and packaged terminal Parts of a window unit Window unit air conditioners are installed in an open window. The interior air is cooled as a fan blows it over the evaporator. On the exterior the heat drawn from the interior is dissipated into the environment as a second fan blows outside air over the condenser. A large house or building may have several such units, allowing each room to be cooled separately. In 1971, General Electric introduced a popular portable in-window air conditioner designed for convenience and portability. Packaged terminal air conditioner (PTAC) systems are also known as wall-split air conditioning systems. They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently used in hotels, have two separate units (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and connecting them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and allows each room to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems may be adapted to provide heating in cold weather, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the air conditioner into a heat pump. While room air conditioning provides maximum flexibility, when used to cool many rooms at a time it is generally more expensive than central air conditioning. The first practical semi-portable air conditioning unit was invented by engineers at Chrysler Motors and offered for sale starting in 1935. Split systems Split-system air conditioners come in two forms: mini-split and central systems. In both types, the inside-environment (evaporative) heat exchanger is separated by some distance from the outside-environment (condensing unit) heat exchanger. Split central (ducted) system Common in U.S. homes and businesses, both in the U.S. and abroad. In these, an air handler that may contain a fan coil unit, a mechanism to heat the air and filter is placed inside a house or building and is connected to a condensing unit, which is outdoors. The air handler is controlled by a thermostat placed some distance away from the air handler. A user sets a desired temperature on the thermostat and the thermostat controls the air handler to maintain the set temperature. The air is fed through the air handler and, using ducts, into the spaces to be air conditioned. The air handler is usually placed away from the spaces that are air conditioned, in a different room. The air handler may get its air from outside or from the room, either through vents placed in doors or from ducts. The air handler may also be placed outside, contain a condenser and allowed to draw outside air. When these criteria are met, they are instead known as rooftop systems, rooftop units, rooftop packaged unit or packaged rooftop system. Mini-split (ductless) system Condenser side of a ductless split-type air conditioner Evaporator, or terminal, side of a ductless split- type air conditioner A mini-split system typically supplies air conditioned and heated air to a single or a few rooms of a building. In these, the evaporator unit uses a cross-flow fan to blow air from the evaporator coil. The name mini-split is often used to refer to those mini-split systems that only supply air to a single room. Multi-zone systems are a common application of ductless systems and allow up to 8 rooms (zones) to be conditioned from a single outdoor unit. Multi-zone systems typically offer a variety of indoor unit styles including wall-mounted, ceiling-mounted, ceiling recessed, and horizontal ducted. Mini-split systems typically produce per hour of cooling to a single room or indoor unit. The first mini-split systems were sold in 1954-1968 by Mitsubishi Electric and Toshiba, in Japan. Its invention was motivated by the small size of modern Japanese homes, and the large size of traditional ducted central split systems. Multi-zone (multi-split) systems provide extended cooling and heating capacity up to 60,000 BTU's to multiple rooms or indoor units simultaneously. Large multi-zone systems are known as VRF (Variable refrigerant flow) systems, and are often used in commercial buildings. Multi-zone ductless systems were invented by Daikin in 1973 and VRF systems were also invented by Daikin in 1982. Both were first sold in Japan. Advantages of the ductless system include smaller size and flexibility for zoning or heating and cooling individual rooms. The inside wall space required is significantly reduced. Also, the compressor and heat exchanger can be located farther away from the inside space, rather than merely on the other side of the same unit as in a PTAC or window air conditioner. Flexible exterior hoses lead from the outside unit to the interior one(s); these are often enclosed with metal to look like common drainpipes from the roof. In addition, ductless systems offer higher efficiency, reaching above 30 SEER. The primary disadvantage of ductless air conditioners is their cost. Such systems cost about US$1,500 to US$2,000 per ton (12,000 BTU per hour) of cooling capacity. This is about 30% more than central systems (not including ductwork) and may cost more than twice as much as window units of similar capacity.\\" An additional possible disadvantage is that the cost of installing mini splits can be higher than some systems. However, lower operating costs and rebates or other financial incentives‚Äîoffered in some areas‚Äîcan help offset the initial expense. Multi-split system A multi-split system is a conventional split system, which is divided into two parts (evaporator and condenser) and allows cooling or heating of several rooms with one external unit. In the outdoor unit of this air conditioner there is a more powerful compressor, ports for connecting several traces and automation with locking valves for regulating the volume of refrigerant supplied to the indoor units located in the room. A large Multi Split System is called a Variable refrigerant flow system and can be used instead of a central air conditioner system, as it allows for higher energy efficiency but it is more expensive to purchase and install. Difference between split system and multi-split system: Other common types of air conditioning system are multi-split systems, the difference between separate split system and multi-split system in several indoor units. All of them are connected to the main external unit, but the principle of their operation is similar to a simple split-system. Its unique feature is the presence of one main external unit that connected to several indoor units. Such systems might be the right solution for maintaining the microclimate in several offices, shops, large living spaces. Just few of outdoor units do not worsen the aesthetic appearance of the building. The main external unit can be connected to several different indoor types: floor, ceiling, cassette, etc. =Multi-split system installation considerations= Before selecting the installation location of air conditioner, several main factors need to be considered. First of all, the direction of air flow from the indoor units should not fall on the place of rest or work area. Secondly, there should not be any obstacles on the way of the airflow that might prevent it from covering the space of the premises as much as possible. The outdoor unit must also be located in an open space, otherwise the heat from the house will not be effectively discharged outside and the productivity of the entire system will drop sharply. It is highly advisable to install the air conditioner units in easily accessible places, for further maintenance during operation. The main problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, workers try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system creates more difficulties, since some of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning individually for each room. However, now the market has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units operate separately from each other. The selection of indoor units has one restriction: their total power should not exceed the capacity of the outdoor unit. In practice, however, it is very common to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor units greater than the outdoor capacity by at least 20%. However, it is wrong to expect better performance when all indoor units are turned on at the same time, since the total capacity of the whole system is limited by the capacity of the outdoor unit. Simply put, the outdoor unit will distribute all its power to all operating indoor units in such a way that some of the rooms may not have a very comfortable temperature level. However, the calculation of the total power is not simple, since it takes into account not only the nominal power of the units, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc. Air-only central air conditioning Central ducted A/C provides temperature control and ventilation to an area by conditioning air within an air handler and distributing it to one or more zones. The temperature of individual zones can be controlled by varying the airflow to each zone and/or reheating the air. Central plant cooling A central chilled water plant using air-cooled chillers, water-cooled chillers are cooled by a cooling tower Central cooling plants are used to condition large commercial, industrial, or campus loads. At larger scales, the ductwork required to move conditioned air to and from the plant would be impractically large, so an intermediate fluid such as chilled water is used instead. The plant circulates cold water to terminal chilled water devices such as air handlers or fan/coil units. The plant often consists of a chiller, which may be water or air cooled. If water cooled, the chiller is cooled by a cooling tower. Portable units A portable air conditioner can be easily transported inside a home or office. They are currently available with capacities of about and with or without electric-resistance heaters. Portable air conditioners are either evaporative or refrigerative. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, meaning they use air to exchange heat, in the same way as a car radiator or typical household air conditioner does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which must be vented outside the cooled area; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled area to the outside air. Portable split system A portable system has an indoor unit on wheels connected to an outdoor unit via flexible pipes, similar to a permanently fixed installed unit. The portable units draw indoor air and expel it outdoors through a single duct. Many portable air conditioners come with heat as well as dehumidification function. Portable hose system Hose systems, which can be monoblock or air-to-air, are vented to the outside via air ducts. The monoblock type collects the water in a bucket or tray and stops when full. The air-to-air type re-evaporates the water and discharges it through the ducted hose and can run continuously. A single-hose unit uses air from within the room to cool its condenser and then vents it outside. This air is replaced by hot air from outside or other rooms (due to the negative pressure inside the room), thus reducing the unit's overall efficiency. Modern units might have a coefficient of performance of approximately 3 (i.e., 1 kW of electricity will produce 3 kW of cooling). A dual-hose unit draws air to cool its condenser from outside instead of from inside the room, and thus is more effective than most single-hose units. These units create no negative pressure in the room. Portable evaporative system Evaporative coolers, sometimes called \\"swamp coolers\\", do not have a compressor or condenser. Liquid water is evaporated on the cooling fins, releasing the vapor into the cooled area. Evaporating water absorbs a significant amount of heat, the latent heat of vaporisation, cooling the air. Humans and animals use the same mechanism to cool themselves by sweating. Evaporative coolers have the advantage of needing no hoses to vent heat outside the cooled area, making them truly portable. They are also very cheap to install and use less energy than refrigerative air conditioners. Uses Air-conditioning engineers broadly divide air conditioning applications into comfort and process applications. Comfort applications An array of air conditioners outside a commercial office building Comfort applications aim to provide a building indoor environment that remains relatively constant despite changes in external weather conditions or in internal heat loads. Air conditioning makes deep plan buildings feasible, for otherwise they would have to be built narrower or with light wells so that inner spaces received sufficient outdoor air via natural ventilation. Air conditioning also allows buildings to be taller, since wind speed increases significantly with altitude making natural ventilation impractical for very tall buildings. Comfort applications are quite different for various building types and may be categorized as: *Commercial buildings, which are built for commerce, including offices, malls, shopping centers, restaurants, etc. *High-rise residential buildings, such as tall dormitories and apartment blocks *Industrial spaces where thermal comfort of workers is desired *Cars, aircraft, boats, which transport passenger or fresh goods *Institutional buildings, which includes government buildings, hospitals, schools, etc. *Low-rise residential buildings, including single- family houses, duplexes, and small apartment buildings *Sports stadiums, such as State Farm Stadium in Arizona and in Qatar for the 2022 FIFA World Cup Women have, on average, a significantly lower resting metabolic rate than men. Using inaccurate metabolic rate guidelines for air conditioning sizing can result in oversized and less efficient equipment, and setting system operating setpoints too cold can result in reduced worker productivity. Dubai makes extensive use of air conditioning. In addition to buildings, air conditioning can be used for many types of transportation, including automobiles, buses and other land vehicles, trains, ships, aircraft, and spacecraft. High temperatures in metro system stations may be caused by train air conditioning. Domestic usage Typical residential central air conditioners in North America Air conditioning is common in the US, with 90% of new single-family homes constructed in 2019 including air conditioning, ranging from 99% in the South to 62% in the West. This has been the case since the 1960s. In 2015, 90% of U.S. households had air conditioning.https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/07/22/europe- to-america-your-love-of-air-conditioning-is-stupid/?outputType=amp The U.S consumes more energy for air conditioning than the rest of the world. In Canada, air conditioning use varies by province. In 2013, 55% of Canadian households reported having an air conditioner, with high use in Manitoba (80%), Ontario (78%), Saskatchewan (67%), and Quebec (54%) and lower use in Prince Edward Island (23%), British Columbia (21%), and Newfoundland and Labrador (9%). In Europe, home air conditioning is generally less common. Southern European countries such as Greece have seen a wide proliferation of home air-conditioning units in recent years. In another southern European country, Malta, it is estimated that around 55% of households have an air conditioner installed. In China, the proportion of urban households with air conditioners increased from 8% to 70% in 9 years, from 1995 to 2004. In 2016, it was predicted that by 2031, there would be an additional 700 million air conditioners worldwide.https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy- environment/wp/2016/05/31/the-world-is-about-to-install-700-million-air- conditioners-heres-what-that-means-for-the-climate/ Process applications Process applications aim to provide a suitable environment for a process being carried out, regardless of internal heat and humidity loads and external weather conditions. It is the needs of the process that determine conditions, not human preference. Process applications include these: *Chemical and biological laboratories *Cleanrooms for the production of integrated circuits, pharmaceuticals, and the like, in which very high levels of air cleanliness and control of temperature and humidity are required for the success of the process. *Environmental control of data centers *Facilities for breeding laboratory animals. Since many animals normally reproduce only in spring, holding them in rooms in which conditions mirror those of spring all year can cause them to reproduce year-round. *Food cooking and processing areas *Hospital operating theatres, in which air is filtered to high levels to reduce infection risk and the humidity controlled to limit patient dehydration. Although temperatures are often in the comfort range, some specialist procedures, such as open heart surgery, require low temperatures (about 18 ¬∞C, 64 ¬∞F) and others, such as neonatal, relatively high temperatures (about 28 ¬∞C, 82 ¬∞F). *Industrial environments *Mining *Nuclear power facilities *Physical testing facilities *Plants and farm growing areas *Textile manufacturing *Microclimate control, as in humidors and collections care of cultural heritage In both comfort and process applications, the objective may be to not only control temperature, but also humidity, air quality, and air movement from space to space. Health effects In hot weather, air conditioning can prevent heat stroke, dehydration from excessive sweating and other problems related to hyperthermia. Heat waves are the most lethal type of weather phenomenon in developed countries. Air conditioning (including filtration, humidification, cooling and disinfection) can be used to provide a clean, safe, hypoallergenic atmosphere in hospital operating rooms and other environments where proper atmosphere is critical to patient safety and well-being. It is sometimes recommended for home use by people with allergies. Poorly maintained water cooling towers can promote the growth and spread of microorganisms such as Legionella pneumophila, the infectious agent responsible for Legionnaires' disease. As long as the cooling tower is kept clean (usually by means of a chlorine treatment), these health hazards can be avoided or reduced. The state of New York has codified requirements for registration, maintenance, and testing of cooling towers to protect against Legionella. Environmental impacts Power consumption and efficiency Production of the electricity used to operate air conditioners has an environmental impact, including the release of greenhouse gases. According to a 2015 government survey, 87% of the homes in the United States use air conditioning and 65% of those homes have central air conditioning. Most of the homes with central air conditioning have programmable thermostats, but approximately two-thirds of the homes with central air do not use this feature to make their homes more energy efficient. Lower-energy alternatives Alternatives to continual air conditioning can be used with less energy, lower cost, and with less environmental impact. These include: *In large commercial buildings, making windows able to be opened by occupants when the air outside is cool enough to be comfortable *Setting thermostats to around and allowing workers to wear more climate-appropriate clothing, such as polo shirts and Bermuda shorts. This approach has worked for the Cool Biz campaign in Japan. *Passive cooling techniques, such as: **Passive solar cooling **Natural ventilation under and through buildings **Operating windows to induce a stack effect breeze **Letting in cool air at night and closing windows during the day.: **Operating shades to reduce solar gain **Building slightly underground, to take advantage of unpowered conduction and geothermal mass **Placement of trees, architectural shades, windows (and using window coatings) to reduce solar gain **Thermal insulation placed to prevent heat from entering **Light- colored building materials reflect away more incoming infrared radiation *Using a fan if the air is below body temperature *Using naturally cooler basement rooms more *Taking a siesta during the hottest part of the day *Sleeping outside on a porch or roof *Deep water source cooling Automobile power consumption In an automobile, the A/C system will use around 4 horsepower (3 kW) of the engine's power, thus increasing fuel consumption of the vehicle. Refrigerants The selection of the working fluids (refrigerants) has a significant impact not only on the performance of the air conditioners but on the environment as well. Most refrigerants used for air conditioning contribute to global warming, and many also deplete the ozone layer. CFCs, HCFCs, and HFCs are potent greenhouse gases when leaked to the atmosphere. The use of CFC as a refrigerant was once common, including the refrigerants R-11 and R-12 (sold under the brand name Freon-12). Freon refrigerants were commonly used during the 20th century in air conditioners due to their superior stability and safety properties. When they are released accidentally or deliberately, these chlorine-bearing refrigerants eventually reach the upper atmosphere. Once the refrigerant reaches the stratosphere, UV radiation from the Sun homolytically cleaves the chlorine-carbon bond, yielding a chlorine radical. These chlorine radicals catalyze the breakdown of ozone into diatomic oxygen, depleting the ozone layer that shields the Earth's surface from strong UV radiation. Each chlorine radical remains active as a catalyst until it binds with another radical, forming a stable molecule and quenching the chain reaction. Prior to 1994, most automotive air conditioning systems used R-12 as a refrigerant. It was replaced with R-134a refrigerant, which has no ozone depletion potential. Old R-12 systems can be retrofitted to R-134a by a complete flush and filter/dryer replacement to remove the mineral oil, which is not compatible with R-134a. R22 (also known as HCFC-22) has a global warming potential about 1,800 times higher than CO2. It was phased out for use in new equipment by 2010, and is to be completely discontinued by 2020. Although these gasses can be recycled when air conditioning units are disposed of, uncontrolled dumping and leaking can release gas directly into the atmosphere. In the UK, the Ozone Regulations came into force in 2000 and banned the use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Regulation banned the use of R22 as a \\"top-up\\" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that equipment that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained. The manufacture and use of CFCs has been banned or severely restricted due to concerns about ozone depletion (see also Montreal Protocol). In light of these environmental concerns, beginning on November 14, 1994, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has restricted the sale, possession and use of refrigerant to only licensed technicians, per rules under sections 608 and 609 of the Clean Air Act. As an alternative to conventional refrigerants, other gases, such as CO2 (R-744), have been proposed. R-744 is being adopted as a refrigerant in Europe and Japan. It is an effective refrigerant with a global warming potential of 1, but it must use higher compression to produce an equivalent cooling effect. In 1992, a non- governmental organization, Greenpeace, was spurred by corporate executive policies and requested that a European lab find substitute refrigerants. This led to two alternatives, one a blend of propane (R290) and isobutane (R600a), and one of pure isobutane. Industry resisted change in Europe until 1993, and in the U.S. until 2011, despite some supportive steps in 2004 and 2008 (see Refrigerant Development above). In 2019 the UNEP published new voluntary guidelines, however many countries have not yet ratified the Kigali Accord.  Economic effects   Demographical  Air conditioning caused various shifts in demography, notably that of the U.S starting from the 1970s. First, the number of births became much less varied throughout the year. Whereas, until 1970, the birth rate in the spring was lower than during the other seasons, the introduction of air conditioning leveled out this difference at the end of the 20th century. Mortality rate was also affected, especially during the summer and in regions subject to heatwave; up to a 2% decrease from the 30s to the 90s. More surprising is the gradual movement of populations from northern states to southern states within those same 60 years. The Sun Belt now welcomes 30% of the total US population when it was inhabited by only 24% of Americans at the beginning of the last century. Outside the US, Dubai and Singapore also reflect the magical effects of Carrier's invention.  Effects in production  First designed to benefit targeted industries such as the press as well as large factories, the invention quickly spread to public agencies and administrations. As a matter of fact, studies published by Carrier's at the time showed an increase of productivity close to 24% in places equipped with air conditioning.

The company was established by John Wassell and Liz Pugh in 1991, who identified a niche market for a touring theatre ship, and other aquatic shows on the waterways. The company's work began when the pair purchased a touring theatre ship, the MV Fitzcarraldo. The company's work has now extended far beyond the ship and they work on delivering shows and events, varying in scale from intimate to epic. Walk the Plank have produced work for Toronto‚Äôs Wintercity Festival, Singapore Festival, Euro 2004, Tall Ships 2005, Centerparcs, Sir Paul McCartney, the Commonwealth Games, as well as multiple city and local councils. Perhaps their most well known credit are the opening and closing ceremonies for Liverpool's Capital of Culture celebrations. Their administrative base is in Salford, Greater Manchester and they have workshop facilities in Ramsbottom and Rawtenstall. Their work often involves community engagement and they are known for scheduling and leading participation elements which fit the context of the event they are organising.

It was one of the most influential critical works of the 20th century and was a key foundation work in the formation of the New Criticism school.\\"Sir William Empson\\", Encyclop√¶dia Britannica 2003 DVD Edition. The book is organized around seven types of ambiguity that Empson finds in the poetry he criticises. The second edition (revised) was published by Chatto & Windus, London, 1947, and there was another revised edition in 1953. The first printing in America was by New Directions in 1947. Seven Types of Ambiguity ushered in New Criticism in the United States. The book is a guide to a style of literary criticism practiced by Empson. An ambiguity is represented as a puzzle to Empson. We have ambiguity when \\"alternative views might be taken without sheer misreading.\\" Empson reads poetry as an exploration of conflicts within the author. Seven types  # The first type of ambiguity is the metaphor, that is, when two things are said to be alike which have different properties. This concept is similar to that of metaphysical conceit. # Two or more meanings are resolved into one. Empson characterizes this as using two different metaphors at once. # Two ideas that are connected through context can be given in one word simultaneously. # Two or more meanings that do not agree but combine to make clear a complicated state of mind in the author. # When the author discovers his idea in the act of writing. Empson describes a simile that lies halfway between two statements made by the author. # When a statement says nothing and the readers are forced to invent a statement of their own, most likely in conflict with that of the author. # Two words that within context are opposites that expose a fundamental division in the author's mind.\\"The Sacrifice\\", Chapter VII from \\"Seven Types of Ambiguity\\", William Empson.

(The first enclosed mall in California was Escondido Village Mall.) It is anchored by Bed Bath & Beyond, Costco, JCPenney, Macy's, Forever 21, and Target. At , the Lakewood Center is ranked among the largest retail shopping malls by gross leasable area in the United States.Largest Shopping Malls in the United States In 2004, the Lakewood Center's sales amounted to $393 per square foot with an approximate 11.2 million shoppers. The mall is owned and operated by Macerich and is part of its trifecta of \\"Shop One Shop All\\" malls in southeast Los Angeles County along with the Los Cerritos Center in Cerritos and the Stonewood Center in Downey. History Lakewood Center open in 1952 on 259 acres, located 21 Miles southeast of Downtown Los Angeles. The mall included 18 stores including a 4 Level (347,000 sq ft) May Company store & a 3 Level (88,000 sq ft) Butler Brothers department store. Large department stores were built which were part of the shopping center, but not connected with the mall proper. A 4-level (250,000 sq ft) Bullock's store opened in 1965, with a 2-level (80,000 square foot) Buffums' store beginning business on August 2 of the same year. In the mall proper, JCPenney opened a 2-level (173,000 sq ft) store, at the mall's south end, on January 25, 1967. Montgomery Ward opened a 2-level (155,000 sq ft) store to the mall later in 1975. The refurbishment and expansion continued. In September 1982, construction was completed on a new mall corridor, added east of May Company. This new East Wing extended to a 2-level (80,000 sq ft) Mervyn's store. A 3-screen multiplex, the Pacific Theatres Lakewood Center South 1-2-3, was installed in a vacant store adjoining the Buffums' building. This venue showed its first features on June 12, 1981. Buffums' closed its doors in 1991 and Bullock's a year later (now the site of The Home Depot). Its space was renovated into 6 auditoria. A new 9-screen complex, known collectively as the Lakewood Center South 9, premiered on December 11, 1992. In February 1993, May Company rebranded its store as Robinsons-May. Meanwhile, a turn of the century renovation had reconfigured the mall's East Wing. During the 36 million dollar project, a new 1-level (80,000 sq ft) Mervyn's store was built, which was dedicated in August of the year 2000. The original Mervyn's was gutted and sectioned into an extended mall corridor, with stores on either side. That allowed a new 2-level (210,000 sq ft) Macy's store to be built at the east end of the extended East Wing. It opened for business November 2000 as the chain's first newly-built store in Southern California. The new mall wing was officially dedicated in April 2001. In that same year, Montgomery Ward closed its doors in March 2001. The store, and its Auto Center, were demolished and replaced by a 2-level (160,000 sq ft) Target store, which opened in October 2003. The Robinsons-May store was rebranded as the new Macy's in 2006. The original Macy's, at the end of the East Wing, was abandoned. The former Macy's building was demolished and replaced by a new 1-level (159,000 sq ft) Costco warehouse, which opened on February 2009. After the demise of the Mervyn's chain, in 2009, the former location became a large-format Forever 21. This store also began business on February 2009. Transit access The mall is accessible by LACMTA Metro Local Lines 265 and 266, and Long Beach Transit Lines 91, 93, 103, 111, 112 and 191. Line 91 only runs to the mall on weekends as Line 93 does not run on weekends or holidays. Line 191 stops along Del Amo Boulevard.

The role of such categories C is to approximate, in some sense, the category of linear representations of an algebraic group G defined over K. A number of major applications of the theory have been made, or might be made in pursuit of some of the central conjectures of contemporary algebraic geometry and number theory. The name is taken from Tannaka‚ÄìKrein duality, a theory about compact groups G and their representation theory. The theory was developed first in the school of Alexander Grothendieck. It was later reconsidered by Pierre Deligne, and some simplifications made. The pattern of the theory is that of Grothendieck's Galois theory, which is a theory about finite permutation representations of groups G which are profinite groups. The gist of the theory, which is rather elaborate in detail in the exposition of Saavedra Rivano, is that the fiber functor Œ¶ of the Galois theory is replaced by a tensor functor T from C to K-Vect. The group of natural transformations of Œ¶ to itself, which turns out to be a profinite group in the Galois theory, is replaced by the group (a priori only a monoid) of natural transformations of T into itself, that respect the tensor structure. This is by nature not an algebraic group, but an inverse limit of algebraic groups (pro-algebraic group). Formal definition A neutral Tannakian category is a rigid abelian tensor category, such that there exists a K-tensor functor to the category of finite dimensional K-vector spaces that is exact and faithful. Applications The construction is used in cases where a Hodge structure or l-adic representation is to be considered in the light of group representation theory. For example, the Mumford‚ÄìTate group and motivic Galois group are potentially to be recovered from one cohomology group or Galois module, by means of a mediating Tannakian category it generates. Those areas of application are closely connected to the theory of motives. Another place in which Tannakian categories have been used is in connection with the Grothendieck‚ÄìKatz p-curvature conjecture; in other words, in bounding monodromy groups. The Geometric Satake equivalence establishes an equivalence between representations of the Langlands dual group {}^L G of a reductive group G and certain equivariant perverse sheaves on the affine Grassmannian associated to G. This equivalence provides a non-combinatorial construction of the Langlands dual group. It is proved by showing that the mentioned category of perverse sheaves is a Tannakian category and identifying its Tannaka dual group with {}^L G. Extensions has established partial Tannaka duality results in the situation where the category is R-linear, where R is no longer a field (as in classical Tannakian duality), but certain valuation rings. showed a Tannaka duality result if R is a Dedekind ring. has initiated the study of Tannaka duality in the context of infinity-categories.

Found on or near the bottom, it favors shallow coastal habitats with sandy or vegetated bottoms, and also enters brackish water. This shark reaches in length. It has a short, rounded snout and mostly narrow fins; the pectoral fins are broad and triangular, and the trailing margin of the first dorsal fin is almost vertical. It is gray above and lighter below; younger sharks have darker saddles and dots, which fade with age. Nocturnal and largely solitary, the banded houndshark preys on benthic invertebrates and bony fishes. It is aplacental viviparous, with the developing embryos sustained by yolk. After mating during summer, females bear as many as 42 pups following a gestation period of 9‚Äì12 months. The banded houndshark poses no danger to humans and adapts well to captivity. It is caught as bycatch off Japan, Taiwan, and likely elsewhere in its range; it may be eaten but is not as well-regarded as related species. Because fishing does not appear to have diminished this shark's population, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed it under least concern. Taxonomy The first scientific description of the banded houndshark was authored by German biologists Johannes Peter M√ºller and Friedrich Gustav Jakob Henle, based on a dried specimen from Japan, in their 1838‚Äì41 Systematische Beschreibung der Plagiostomen. They gave it the specific epithet scyllium, derived from the Ancient Greek skylion (\\"dogfish\\"), and placed it in the genus Triakis. Within the genus, it is placed in the subgenus Triakis along with the leopard shark (T. (Triakis) semifasciata). Distribution and habitat Native to the northwestern Pacific Ocean, the banded houndshark occurs from the southern Russian Far East to Taiwan, including Japan, Korea, and eastern China; records from the Philippines are questionable. This common, benthic shark is found over continental and insular shelves, mostly close to shore, but also to a depth of . It frequents sandy flats and beds of seaweed and eelgrass; additionally, it is tolerant of brackish water and enters estuaries and bays. Description The markings of the banded houndshark become indistinct with age. The banded houndshark is a moderately slender-bodied species growing up to long. The snout is short, broad, and rounded; the widely separated nostrils are each preceded by a lobe of skin that does not reach the mouth. The horizontally oval eyes are placed high on the head; they are equipped with rudimentary nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids) and have prominent ridges underneath. The mouth forms a short, wide arch and bears long furrows at the corners that extend onto both jaws. Each tooth has an upright to oblique knife-like central cusp flanked by strong cusplets. There are five pairs of gill slits. Most of the fins are fairly narrow; in adults the pectoral fins are broad and roughly triangular. The moderately tall first dorsal fin is placed about halfway between the pectoral and pelvic fins, and its trailing margin is nearly vertical near the apex. The second dorsal fin is about three-quarters as high as the first and larger than the anal fin. The caudal fin has a well-developed lower lobe and a prominent ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe; in young sharks the lower caudal fin lobe is much less distinct. This species is gray above, with darker saddles and scattered black spots that fade with age; the underside is off-white. Biology and ecology Spoon worms are an important food source for small banded houndsharks. The banded houndshark is nocturnal and generally solitary, though several individuals may rest together, sometimes piled atop one another inside a cave. It feeds mainly on crustaceans (including shrimp, crabs, hermit crabs, and mantis shrimp), cephalopods (including octopus), and spoon worms; polychaete worms, tunicates, peanut worms, and small, bottom-living bony fishes (including flatfishes, conger eels, herring, jacks, drums, and grunts) are occasionally consumed. Shrimp and spoon worms are important prey for sharks up to long; cephalopods predominate in the diets of larger sharks. Mating occurs during the summer, and involves the male swimming parallel to the female and gripping her pectoral fin with his teeth; thus secured, he then twists the distal portion of his body to insert a single clasper into her cloaca for copulation. The banded houndshark is aplacental viviparous, in which the developing embryos are sustained to birth by yolk. Females bear litters of 9‚Äì26 pups after a gestation period of 9‚Äì12 months, though litters as large as 42 pups have been recorded. The newborns measure long. Males mature sexually at 5‚Äì6 years old, when they are long, and live up to 15 years. Females mature sexually at 6‚Äì7 years old, when they are long, and live up to 18 years. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Callitetrarhynchus gracilis, Onchobothrium triacis, and Phyllobothrium serratum, the leech Stibarobdella macrothela, and the copepods Achtheinus impenderus, Caligus punctatus, Kroyeria triakos, and Pseudopandarus scyllii. Human interactions Live banded houndshark on display at a restaurant in China. Harmless to humans, the banded houndshark is commonly displayed in public aquariums in China and Japan, and has reproduced in captivity. Individuals have survived in captivity for over five years. This species is often caught incidentally off Japan in gillnets and set nets; the meat is sometimes sold, but is considered to be of poorer quality than that of other houndsharks in the region. It is caught in lesser numbers off Taiwan, and is probably also fished off Korea and northern China. Off Japan, it can be found in rocky areas that provide refuge from fishing pressure.

Geography Within the territory of the town and commune there are three lakes: Miejskie Lake, Kleszcz√≥w Lake and Czarne Lake. The commune is a typically agricultural area. It is constituted by 1,009 farms and 167 plots of ground. Ostr√≥w Lubelski belongs to the historic province of Lesser Poland. The majority of farms are not concentrated on one particular kind of production; some specialise in cattle breeding for export, others in poultry breeding (geese, ducks), and yet others in pig breeding. Climate and water supplies are favourable for agriculture. In addition to grain, farms also grow herbs (thyme, lovage, camomile and mallow) and oil plants. History \\"Ostr√≥w\\" derives from a Slavic word meaning \\"island\\". On January 25, 1548 King Sigismund the Old granted a foundation privilege to Ostr√≥w along with a privilege of hereditary office to Wac≈Çaw Grzyma≈Ça, a nobleman. At that time the area of Ostr√≥w stretched over 1985 hectares. Ostr√≥w became a royal town, holding a right to organise Saturday fairs and collecting duty on the road from Lublin to Parczew. The fact that it was located on the Polish- Lithuanian route was advantageous for the development of trade and consequently the town. In 1565 the population of Ostr√≥w numbered about 1800 inhabitants, mostly Poles. It was one of the five most densely populated towns in the Lublin Voivodeship at that time. Apart from Lublin, Kazimierz was another town with bigger population than Ostr√≥w. ≈Åuk√≥w and Parczew had nearly the same number of inhabitants. In 1589, in order to increase the colonisation, King Sigismund III granted Ostr√≥w a right to organise three fairs a week. In spite of that, the importance of Ostr√≥w decreased in the following decade. Polish-Ukrainian wars, the Swedish Flood as well as numerous conflicts and the greed of starosties resulted in a considerable deterioration of the town. The devastation of Ostr√≥w by the troops of Moszkowski, Capitain of Horse, in 1657 was one of major factors contributing to its collapse. The number of population decreased to 300 people. The period of rule by Electors of Saxony witnessed further degradation of the town, in particular the years 1712‚Äì1717, when its inhabitants were forced to bear the expense of maintaining troops, although Ostr√≥w was never a battlefield. This situation resulted in the mass exodus of its inhabitants. In 1718 the population of Ostr√≥w numbered only 20. During the Partition period an administrative status of Ostr√≥w altered several times. It functioned as a royal town until 1864, when the Russian government renamed it into a settlers commune. In 1923 a part of Ty≈õmienica commune was annexed to Ostr√≥w commune. The commune population numbered over 8000 people in 1923. During the First World War Ostr√≥w was completely devastated and its population decreased to 2100 inhabitants. The Germans, who occupied it for four years, (1914‚Äì1918) did not permit to rebuild it. The census of 1919 recorded 4648 people. At that time Ostr√≥w was a village commune. After Poland regained its independence in 1918, the inhabitants of Ostr√≥w pronounced their plea for Ostr√≥w to regain its status as a town. On the strength of the Decree of the Minister of Internal Affairs, Thugutt, by the terms of the Resolution of the Executive Seym of July 22, 1919, by the Decree of the State Commander of February 4, 1919 Ostr√≥w became a town. Municipal administration was formed. The first election to the Town Council was carried out in 1920 and Aleksander Samulik became a mayor of Ostr√≥w. In the same year Ostr√≥w was completely devastated and robbed by the Bolsheviks, depriving its inhabitants of all their property. The town suffered from the aftermath of the German-Russian war. Even a church was not saved. To commemorate this occasion bullets were built in the church walls. The period between the First World War and the Second World War was a period of prosperity. Ostr√≥w was rebuilt and developed (concrete pavements along town squares, a bridge over the Ty≈õmienica, a school, community house, fourteen new streets). At that time Ostr√≥w was much overpopulated. In 1928 fire destroyed its buildings. In 1930 there lived 4879 people, including a high percentage of the Jewish population. While Poles were mostly peasants, local Jews took up crafts and trade. The cultural and economic development of Ostr√≥w was terminated by an outbreak of the Second World War. The entire Jewish population was murdered in the Holocaust.

Wind direction is reported by the direction from which it originates. For example, a north or northerly wind blows from the north to the south. Wind direction is usually reported in cardinal (or compass) direction, or in degrees. Consequently, a wind blowing from the north has a wind direction referred to as 0¬∞ (360¬∞); a wind blowing from the east has a wind direction referred to as 90¬∞, etc. Weather forecasts typically give the direction of the wind along with its speed, for example a \\"northerly wind at 15 km/h\\" is a wind blowing from the north at a speed of 15 km/h.  Measurement techniques  A variety of instruments can be used to measure wind direction, such as the windsock and wind vane. Both of these instruments work by moving to minimize air resistance. The way a weather vane is pointed by prevailing winds indicates the direction from which the wind is blowing. The larger opening of a windsock faces the direction that the wind is blowing from; its tail, with the smaller opening, points in the same direction as the wind is blowing. Modern instruments used to measure wind speed and direction are called anemometers and wind vanes, respectively. These types of instruments are used by the wind energy industry, both for wind resource assessment and turbine control. When a high measurement frequency is needed (such as in research applications), wind can be measured by the propagation speed of ultrasound signals or by the effect of ventilation on the resistance of a heated wire. Another type of anemometer uses pitot tubes that take advantage of the pressure differential between an inner tube and an outer tube that is exposed to the wind to determine the dynamic pressure, which is then used to compute the wind speed. In situations where modern instruments are not available, an index finger can be used to test the direction of wind. This is accomplished by wetting the finger and pointing it upwards. The side of the finger that feels \\"cool\\" is (approximately) the direction from which the wind is blowing. The \\"cool\\" sensation is caused by an increased rate of evaporation of the moisture on the finger due to the air flow across the finger, and consequently the \\"finger technique\\" of measuring wind direction does not work well in either very humid or very hot conditions. The same principle is used to measure the dew point using a sling psychrometer (a more accurate instrument than the human finger). Another primitive technique for measuring wind direction is to take a pinch of grass and drop it; the direction that the grass falls is the direction the wind is blowing. This last technique is often used by golfers because it allows them to gauge the strength of the wind.

Between 1989 and 1998, he played for five teams in the National Hockey League: the St. Louis Blues, Tampa Bay Lightning, Montreal Canadiens, Phoenix Coyotes and Carolina Hurricanes.  St. Louis Blues  Jablonski, who played junior hockey the Windsor Spitfires of the Ontario Hockey League, was drafted by St. Louis 139th overall in the 1985 NHL Entry Draft. After three years with the Blues' farm team, the Peoria Rivermen, Jablonski was called up to the NHL at the start of the 1989‚Äì90 season and played four games with the Blues, losing all four. He returned to Peoria until February 1991, when he replaced an injured Curtis Joseph. Jablonski shared goaltending duties with Vincent Riendeau for the remainder of the regular season, as well as for three games in a playoff series with the Minnesota North Stars. He continued as a backup for St. Louis in the 1991‚Äì92 season.  Other teams Jablonski was traded to the expansion Tampa Bay Lightning in June 1992, and was named the starting goaltender for their inaugural season of 1992‚Äì93. Jablonski played 42 games that season, including his only career NHL shutout; against the Ottawa Senators in November. He played 15 games for the Lightning in 1993‚Äì94 before being traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs in February 1994. Jablonski never played in the NHL for Toronto, spending his time in the lockout-shortened 1994‚Äì95 season between their farm team in St. John's and the Chicago Wolves and Houston Aeros of the International Hockey League. He returned to the Blues as a free agent in the summer of 1995, but only played one game for St. Louis before being traded to the Montreal Canadiens in November. After Patrick Roy was traded to the Colorado Avalanche that December, Jablonski shared goaltending duties with Jocelyn Thibault for the remainder of 1995‚Äì96 and into the beginning of the 1996‚Äì97 season. Later career Jablonski was traded to the Phoenix Coyotes in January 1997. In Phoenix, Jablonski saw little playing time, only playing two games as a replacement for Nikolai Khabibulin. He signed as a free agent with Carolina in August 1997, and played five games in the 1997‚Äì98 season for the Hurricanes, with most of the rest of the season spent with the IHL's Cleveland Lumberjacks. Jablonski never played in the NHL again. He played the 1998‚Äì99 season with the Chicago Wolves of the IHL, followed by two seasons for V√§stra Fr√∂lunda HC in Sweden.

The agreement was signed in 1980 in Tarawa, Kiribati, and subject to Rules of Origin regulations, designed to address the unequal trade relationships between the two groups. The textiles, clothing and footwear (TCF) industry has been a major beneficiary of SPARTECA through the preferential access to Australian and New Zealand markets. The agreement entered into force on 1 January 1981. TCF in Fiji The local Fiji textiles, clothing and footwear (TCF) industry has grown over the last 10 years and is now one of the major industries in Fiji. In 1997 the TCF industry accounted for 26% of Fiji‚Äôs total domestic exports; it contributed to some 3.5% of GDP and provided employment for about 18,000 people that account for 16% of those in total paid employment. The rapid expansion of the Fiji TCF industry has been attributed to the removal of TCF quotas by the Australian Government in 1987 which allowed quota free and duty-free access under SPARTECA, the introduction of the Tax Free Factory/Zone (TFF/TFZ) Scheme in 1988 and the Australian Import Credit Scheme (ICS). Australian ICS The Australian ICS commenced in July 1991 as part of a larger package of tariff and other industrial reforms in Australia. It was introduced as a temporary measure to encourage Australian TCF exports and terminated on 30 June 2000, except in the case of Fiji, where an extension had been granted to October 2000. Details of SPARTECA Given the Australian and Fiji Governments‚Äô commitment to developing a WTO-friendly arrangement in place of the ICS, the SPARTECA (TCF Provisions) Scheme was developed. SPARTECA (TCF) provisions concept complements the existing SPARTECA treaty and provides for a change in the way local area content (LAC) is calculated for TCF products (goods) entering Australia from Forum Island Countries (FICs). Under the existing SPARTECA arrangements, goods can enter Australia duty free where the Allowable Factory Cost is greater than or equal to 50% of the total ex-factory cost of manufacturing the goods. These arrangements continue to stand. The SPARTECA (TCF provisions) Scheme enables companies to utilise excess local area content (ELAC) from certain SPARTECA qualifying TCF goods to help meet the 50% content requirement in otherwise non-qualifying Eligible Goods. ELAC is only derived where a product‚Äôs LAC exceeds 70%. Similarly, ELAC can only be used where a product‚Äôs LAC is greater than 35%, and where there is a last process of manufacture performed in the FIC. The duration of the S-TCF Scheme is from March 1, 2001 to December 31, 2004.

Many trains on this route run via Wolverhampton, Birmingham and Coventry, turning off towards Leamington Spa.  History  * The line from Rugby to Birmingham was opened as part of the London and Birmingham Railway, in 1838, and originally ran into its terminus at Birmingham Curzon Street. * The Grand Junction Railway opened its line into Curzon Street the following year, linking Birmingham to Wolverhampton, Stafford, and north to the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. However, this line ran via to Wolverhampton (see map). The London and Birmingham, and Grand Junction railways merged in 1846, to form the London and North Western Railway (LNWR). Soon after, work started on building a new, more centrally located station in Birmingham, which became known as Birmingham New Street station. * Finally, on 1 July 1852, the Stour Valley Line from Wolverhampton to Birmingham via Smethwick opened, from Bushbury, just north of Wolverhampton (where it joined the Grand Junction Railway) to Birmingham New Street. It was promoted by the Birmingham, Wolverhampton and Stour Valley Railway, which was soon absorbed by the LNWR.Tipton Civic Society ‚Äì Brief History of Tipton The LNWR itself became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) in 1923, and part of British Railways at Nationalisation in 1948. The line was electrified along with the rest of the WCML during the late 1960s in the wake of the BR 1955 Modernisation Plan. In 1987, British Rail commissioned artist Kevin Atherton to produce a series of sculptures to be erected along the line between Birmingham New Street station and Wolverhampton. The finished piece was titled Iron Horse, and consists of twelve different horse silhouettes, fashioned from steel. The construction material was chosen for its historic associations with the Black Country.Public Sculpture of Birmingham including Sutton Coldfield, George T. Noszlopy, edited Jeremy Beach, 1998, Many of the smaller stations on the line, were closed in the 1950s and 60s, especially between Birmingham and Wolverhampton. However, some new stations were opened in the late 20th century: station was opened in 1976 to serve Birmingham Airport and the National Exhibition Centre, and in 1995 another new station; was opened, serving as a two-level interchange with trains on the Birmingham Snow Hill to Worcester Line. There was also three services a day to Walsall until May 2019 timetable changes saw it removed and replaced by two morning services a day to Shrewsbury  Accidents  * 1967 ‚Äì Stechford rail crash; 9 killed, 16 injured.  Infrastructure  Despite the heavy traffic carried by the line, it is only double track throughout, and heavily congested, especially on the stretch between Coventry and Birmingham. In the 1930s, the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) started work on quadrupling the line between Coventry and Birmingham, however only preparatory work was carried out before the scheme was cancelled due to the outbreak of World War II. Periodic calls have been made since to quadruple the line between Coventry and Birmingham to ease congestion. The line is electrified with overhead wires at 25 kv AC.

It is the outermost of the three beltways in the Helsinki region, and the first one to be built. It lies across the four Finnish municipalities of Kirkkonummi, Espoo, Vantaa and Helsinki. Shaped like an arch, the road is long, of which only a very small fraction passes within the borders of Helsinki itself. Overview Work on Keh√§ III started in 1962, on the base of an existing road. The construction was finished in 1972, initially with only one lane per direction. Most parts of the road have since been expanded to at least two lanes per direction, although the westernmost end is still one-lane per direction in places. The most recent construction work has been extensive renovation on its busiest stretch in Vantaa, where several interchanges have been built or improved, and lanes added. Industrial development along the road has introduced higher volumes of heavy traffic. The European route E18 is routed through Keh√§ III, bypassing central Helsinki. Keh√§ III is often informally or jokingly considered the outer border of the Helsinki area, because most of the urban development of the capital region is inside the ring. The road itself doesn't follow any legal border and rural and urban landscapes can be found on both sides of it. The new zone system for fares in the HSL area follows the borders of Keh√§ III. History Ring III in Vantaa, looking west. The beginning was constructed between 1962 and 1965 from Bemb√∂le to L√§nsisalmi and the continuation to Jorvas was completed in 1968. Originally, each road was two lanes wide. The amount of traffic grew considerably over time and as a result the original intersections with Helsinki's exit roads became dangerous. Therefore, all intersections with the city exits had been rebuilt as merging loops by the beginning of the 1970s. The road has undergone almost continual modification and widening throughout its existence as traffic has increased in the region. In the mid-1970s, the road between Tikkurila and Helsinki-Vantaa Airport was renovated and 10 years later the road was expanded to four lanes up to Vihdintie. At the end of the 1980s, the road was extended to Muurala and then once again one kilometer farther to the west. This same stretch was rebuilt shortly afterwards when it was expanded to four lanes up through Gumb√∂le during the 1990s. Throughout the 1980s, stretches of Keh√§ III were completed to the Lahti motorway and in the 1990s to the Porvoo motorway. The road to Vuosaari Harbour, completed in 2007, extends from the eastern endpoint of Keh√§ III. At the start of 2000s major improvements were made to the heavily used stretch from Tikkurila to Helsinki-Vantaa Airport: the road was widened to 6 lanes and Tuusulanv√§yl√§ motorway's intersection was rebuilt as a large system connection. When the road was originally built, it was simply called the \\"Ring road\\", but the planning of the other two major roads caused confusion. Therefore, it was called Keh√§ III from the 1970s onward.

Francis, The Cement Industry 1796-1914: a History, David & Charles, 1977; ) was a British cement manufacturer, and a pioneer of the Portland cement industry. Born in London, his father was a charge-hand at Francis & White's \\"Roman Cement\\" plant in Nine Elms. He himself worked there as a labourer from age 16 while studying chemistry. In 1833 he became manager of John Bazeley White's cement plant at Swanscombe on the Thames Estuary which at that time was producing \\"Artificial Cement\\" and \\"Roman Cement\\". Joseph Aspdin's product was successful but very expensive, and was later improved independently by his son William. Johnson set to work trying to discover its composition but because Aspdin's product was protected by explicit patents and extreme secrecy it was impossible to market a copy. After nearly two years' work, he succeeded and started marketing his own considerably improved version. Johnson, a highly moral man, Mayor of Gateshead and a JP, was able to claim that he was the inventor of \\"true\\" Portland cement and is generally recognised as such. Aspdin, however, was driven out of business by financial problems caused by the success of Johnson's superior and cheaper product and this led to Johnson taking over Aspdins Cement works at Gateshead, County Durham. Unfortunately this resulted in an embittered Aspdin making wild and vitriolic charges of how his product had been copied. Johnson left J.B. White's shortly afterwards, and, setting up his own company, established a succession of cement plants at Frindsbury, Cliffe and Greenhithe in Kent, and acquired William Aspdin's plant at Gateshead. He pioneered several innovations, including the production of low- water rawmix slurries, and new designs for kilns and industrial chimneys. His company remained a relatively large and successful player in the British cement industry for the next 60 years. The Greenhithe plant was uprated with rotary kilns in 1901. In 1911 I C Johnson & Co became a part of the Blue Circle Group, and his Greenhithe plant remained in operation until 1971. In 1910 on his 100th birthday Johnson was presented with a silver tea service by representatives of the cement industry in Britain and several European Countries. In the course of his long life, Johnson also served as a borough magistrate for Gateshead, a county magistrate for Kent, and councillor for the Borough of Gravesend, in addition to serving on a number of commissions, services not untypical for a businessman of the period. He was also president of the Gravesend Liberal Association and the Gravesend Total Abstinence Society. Johnson was a founding member of Zoar Strict and Particular Baptist Church, Gravesend, where he served as a deacon for many years. He was also an occasional preacher among the Strict Baptists.Johnson, Isaac Charles, 'Autobiography of Isaac Charles Johnson Esq, JP' (Farncombe & Sons, 1912), p.81. Johnson wrote the Autobiography of Isaac Charles Johnson Esq, JP (published by Farncombe & Sons, London, 1912), which was published after his death.

Journal of Cuneiform Studies, Vol. 26, No. 2 (Apr., 1974), pp. 88-89 > There was a man, a citizen of Nippur, destitute and poor, > Gimil-Ninurta was his name, an unhappy man, > In his city, Nippur, he lived, working hard, but > Had not the silver befitting his class, > Had not the gold befitting people (of his stature). > His storage bins lacked pure grain, > His insides burned, craving food, and > His face was unhappy, craving meat and first-class beer; > Having no food, he lay hungry every day, and > Was dressed in garments that had no change. > In his unhappy mood, he thought to himself: > I'll strip off my garments which have no change, and > In my city of Nippur's market I'll buy a sheep! > So he stripped off his garments which had no change, and > In his city of Nippur's market he bought a three-year-old goat. > In his unhappy mood, he thought to himself: > Suppose I slaughter this goat in my yard- > There could be no feast, for where is the beer? > My friends in the neighbourhood would find out and be furious, > And my family and relatives would be angry with me.Jean Bott√©ro The Oldest > Cuisine in the World: Cooking in Mesopotamia., 2004, page 98 Instead he presents the goat to the mayor. This is interpreted as a bribe and Gimil-Ninurta is given only a mug of third-class beer and the leavings of the meal before being thrown out. Through the medium of the gatekeeper Gimil- Ninurta vows to avenge his mistreatment three times over but when the mayor hears this he laughs all day. Gimil-Ninurta hires a chariot and robe from the king on credit. Returning to the mayor's house with a locked chest containing two birds he presents himself as a royal courier conveying gold to the temple of Enlil. Arising in the night and opening the chest to release the birds, he beats the mayor for the purported theft and is compensated with two minas of red gold, twice the sum owed to the king. Gimil-Ninurta calls upon the mayor again disguised as an itinerant physician come to treat his wounds. Claiming that his medication is only effective in the darkness, he lures the mayor into a private room, binds the mayor's hands and feet to stakes and beats him once more. The mayor instructs his staff to watch for his persecutor but Gimil- Ninurta hires an accomplice to identify himself as 'the man with the goat' at the mayor's gate and draw them out. He hides under a bridge near the mayor's house and beats the mayor nigh to death while he is alone.Henry W.F.

It was followed by Guilty.  Plot  The game takes place in a space-borne setting, in the year 2171. Jack T. Ladd is a thief, his hunting-ground is the whole galaxy, and at the moment, he's in big trouble. He's told by the IRDS (Interstellar Revenue Decimation Service) he's got 28 days to pay his taxes - or else the interstellar tax agency will hunt him down. Termination is a viable punishment for tax offenders in these days. Stranded blank on the barren, run-down planet Tayte, Jack decides that he has to make some cash. For that end he agrees to perform three quests for an individual (either the pawnbroker Ebeniezer or crime boss Git Savage): an egg of a Giant Kahoula bird, a bond for Quargian Pleno-credits stolen from the CitiCitiBank Bank vault, and an art exhibit by Renato Spangle from the Stoneybridge Gallery. When he brings all three items however, the player is set up and delivered to the police. While in jail, an unknown benefactor gives him the means to escape the Alkaseltz Prison. With him comes Narm N'palm, an idiotic maniac who serves as Jack's sidekick for the remainder of the game. Jack is delivered to a space vessel run by a space Federation. He is told that Grand LordMaster P'PauD'P'Pau, the mad dictator of planet Shmul, developed the Transatron able to destroy whole star systems. On his way to steal the superweapon from the Research Laboratory, Jack falls in love with the dictator's daughter, Ruthless P'PauD'P'Pau. They end up in SkyCity where the Transatron is kept; there Jack learns that it is not a superweapon, but an inter-dimensional jewel that will allow him to tap into the IRDS files and become the richest man in the universe; the Federation is after it not because it's dangerous, but to erase some of its debts. In the end, the Transatron and Skycity are destroyed because of one of Nalm's blunders and Jack escapes with Ruth, having managed to erase his own debts. Reception Computer Gaming Worlds Charles Ardai in 1994 stated that Innocent Until Caught was \\"sometimes disappointing but never dull\\". He complained of the many bugs (\\"Innocent broke down at least once every half dozen screens\\") and other problems, but \\"I suppose it is a good sign that even with all the bugs, I never felt inclined to stop playing. Jack's story is interesting enough ... the puzzles clever enough, and most of the graphics and sound good enough\\". Ardai concluded that \\"it is rare that a game startles me in the way this one did ... Unusual games earn points in my book, as do daring ones, and Innocent is both\\". PC Gamers Andy Butcher praised the game's graphics and presentation. However, stated that \\"it tries to be funny, and even succeeds at points, but the jokes tend to fall halfway between intelligent wit and Red Dwarf style parody\\". And added, \\"it's not clever enough to count as a classic\\", citing Sam & Max Hit the Road as an example of a better title in the genre.

They were formally known as Umor, Ekoli, Ilomi, Nkoibolokom and Yakurr be Ibe. Due to linguistic problems encountered by the early European visitors, the settlements have come to be known by their mispronounced versions ‚Äì Ugep, Ekori, Idomi, Nko and Mkpani (Okoi-Uyouyo 2002). In the latter, it is a product of yakpanikpani (a Lok·∫°·∫° word for \\"tricks\\"), a name, which Enang (1980) says was given to them by the Ugep people after being tricked in a conflict (Yakurr News). Territory Yakurr people are predominantly found in territories that lies between latitudes 50 401 and 60 101 north of the equator and longitudes 80 21 and 60 101 east of the Greenwich Meridian and northwest of Calabar, the capital of Cross River State. They are found in the present-day Yakurr Local Government Area and constitute the largest ethnic group in the state. They share their northern and eastern boundaries with the Assiga, Nyima and Agoi Clans of the Yakurr Local Government Area, the southern boundary with the Biase Local Government Area and their western boundary with the Abi Local Government Area. By 1935, Yakurr had a population of 22,000 and 38,000 by 1953 (1939, 1950, and 1964; Hansford et al. 1976; and Crabb 1969). The population numbers of Yakurr based on the 1991 national census were rejected by the local and state government due to discrepancies. The results of the 2006 census by the Nigerian government about the current population are still pending. Origins The language spoken by the Yakurr is Lok·∫°·∫°, an Upper Cross River language. It is described by Iwara (1988) as one of the major languages of Cross River State, comparable, in terms of number of speakers, with Efik, which enjoys the special status of a lingua franca in the state. According to Ethnologue, it was spoken by 120.000 people in 1989 (Eberhard et al. 2019). The Yakurr exhibits a very high degree of social heterogeneity, but linguistic, political, religious and cultural homogeneity. In the absence of written records, linguistic, political, religious and cultural homogeneous patterns are the most dependable evidences of establishing descent and biological connections. All Yakurr people share a common tradition of overland migration and ancestry. The ancestral homeland of the Yakurr people is \\"Akpa\\", said to be a shortened form of \\"L·∫πkanakpakpa\\". This area is believed to correspond with the Cameroon‚ÄìObudu range as it stands today. The Yakurr cites the Okuni, Nsofan and Ojo people as their neighbours at L·∫πkanakpakpa. The traditions of Okuni, Nsofan and Ojo corroborate the Yakurr claim of having lived together at L·∫πkanakpakpa, which is referred to as ‚ÄúOnugi‚Äù by the Okuni and Nsofan people and L·∫πkpamkpa by the Ojo people. The migration of Yakurr from their ancestral homeland started at about AD 1617, when a misunderstanding between the Yakurr and their neighbours, arising from the violation of a burial custom forced their neighbours to wage a war against them, leading to them being driven from their homeland. The migratory history of the Yakurr people, as given by Ubi (1986 and 1978) is that, between 1617 and 1677, the Yakurr migrated from that ancestral homeland to look for a new homeland following a military defeat from Akpa. About A.D. 1660, some Yakurr migrants founded new homelands in their present locations. These locations are Idomi and Ugep. Between 1677 and 1707, some other Yakurr migrants founded the towns of Ekori and Nko. Between 1707 and 1737 yet another wave of Yakurr migrants founded Mkpani settlement. The reasons for the relocation of populations in new settlements by the Yakurr is mainly due to competing demands for land resources, as a result of growing populations in one hand and unresolved conflicts in the other. This development is aided by the patrilocality of marriages and strong patriarchy in the family system. It was thus easy for patriclans to relocate to new settlements. This has produced a slight parallelism in names of patriclans and strong parallelism in names of matriclans in all the Yakurr settlements. Culture References *Crabb, D. W.

Originally placed with the nursery web spiders, it was moved to the Ctenidae in 1967. The genus name is derived in part from Ancient Greek \\"\\" (ancylo-), meaning \\"crooked, bent\\". These spiders live near ponds, lakes, rivers and other freshwater habitats, and can walk on water like water striders due to fine air-trapping hairs on the tips of their legs. They can also dive under the surface, and can stay underwater for over an hour by using the air trapped in hairs surrounding their book lungs. They will consume anything from insects to small lizards and, occasionally, small fish. Description Members of Ancylometes are among the largest araneomorph spiders, with a typical body length of . They are sometimes referred to as \\"giant fishing spiders\\" to distinguish them from Dolomedes, a genus of smaller spiders also called \\"fishing spiders\\". The largest species is A. rufus, with females that grow to a body length of and a leg span of . Males of the species only grow up to in body length, but usually have longer legs than the females. Both sexes are brown with dark spots on the abdomen, and males have two thin lines along their carapace. They have a 2-4-2 eye pattern and a reduced third claw, characteristics of the Ctenidae and Pisauridae, respectively. Members of this genus can be distinguished from all others by ventral spines found on the tarsi of the third and fourth legs. Ancylometes and the more fully aquatic Argyroneta are the only known genera of spiders that can spin webs in water. Though these webs can catch fish, they mostly prey on fish by diving down or lying in wait until prey passes within striking distance. Once caught, these spiders will bring their prey back to the surface before eating it. During mating, the male wraps the female with silk, and the female enters an immobile state. After about a week, she produces a cocoon and carries it with her fangs. After a month, she builds a nursery web above the ground, about in diameter. Over one hundred baby spiders will hatch inside this egg case, each only about long. The baby spiders take about a year to mature. Males only live for sixteen months at most, while females can live for more than two years.

According to Douglas Wilson, this method of instruction was developed by early Christians as part of the Seven Liberal Arts. Wilson's writings and the Logos School he founded have been cited as being influential in reviving the Trivium and fueling a modern educational movement, primarily among American Protestants. Classical Christian education is characterized by a reliance on classical works by authors such Homer, Sophocles, Plato, Josephus, Dante, and Shakespeare, and an integration of a Christian worldview into all subjects. In addition, classical Christian education exposes students to Western Civilization's history, art and culture, teaching Latin as early as the second grade and often offering several years of Greek. Philosophy The modern Classical-Christian educational movement began when Douglas Wilson published \\"The Lost Tools of Learning\\". In it he expanded on a paper written by Dorothy Sayers by the same title. She lamented that the ‚Äúgreat defect of our education\\" was that schools taught information, but did not teach students how to think. Wilson described an educational model based on the child's developmental capabilities and natural inclinations. *From birth, the child learns language and about itself. *From about age 2 to age 4, the child develops social skills and gains mobility and dexterity *The Grammar stage begins around age 5. In this stage, the child is in a \\"parrot\\" stage of repeating what they are told. This phase sees them enjoying simple songs over and over, so songs, rhymes and memory aid teach the basics of reading, writing, numbers and math, and observational science. Many schools begin Latin language training in 3rd grade. Some schools will also teach a Christian Catechism while students are in this phase, as foundation for intensive study of the texts and structures of the Bible. *The Logic stage begins in 6th grade. At this age, students naturally develop an argumentative behavior, and are equipped with tools of logic and how to formulate a defense for an idea. This provides the foundation for Sayers' 'teaching them to think' model. *The Rhetoric phase happens during high school, blending the prior learning with specialized knowledge, generally in a college preparatory curriculum.  The Association of Classical and Christian Schools  Since the 1980s, according to Andrew Kern, the classical education movement has \\"swept\\" America. The Association of Classical and Christian Schools consists of hundreds of member schools and approximately 40,000 students in the United States alone.

Prior to 1997 the trio, consisting of Jeremy Post, Brad McCarter and Brent Nims were known as Black Eyed Sceva. Confusion over the meaning of the name and its constant mispronunciation led the band to change its moniker when drummer Erik Herzog replaced Nims prior to the release of the group's third album. They disbanded in 2000. Influenced by artists as diverse as The Police, Rush and Uncle Tupelo, Model Engine/Black Eyed Sceva's music was a blend of alternative rock, grunge, and progressive rock. All of the group's albums were recorded and released under the 5 Minute Walk label and produced by Bruce Winter, an associate of Toad the Wet Sprocket.  Black Eyed Sceva  The group's original name was a reference to the seven sons of Sceva (pronounced with a silent \\"c\\"), briefly mentioned in the Bible in . As Black Eyed Sceva the band released two commercially unsuccessful but critically acclaimed albums, Way Before the Flood (1994) and the EP 5 Years, 50,000 Miles Davis (1995). As a lyricist Post addressed provocative and intellectually challenging issues from a Christian viewpoint. Among the topics covered were premarital sex (\\"Mudhouse\\"), divorce and child abandonment (\\"Adrien James\\"), secular philosophy (\\"Comte's Perspective\\"), homosexuality and AIDS (\\"Handshake\\"), church divisions (\\"Ecumenical\\") and post-modern Christian media hype (\\"Soapbox\\"). The song \\"Twain\\" was an unapologetic assault on Mark Twain's book Letters from the Earth.

The team played in the Eastern League. Their home stadium was Mackenzie Stadium. The Millers played from 1977 to 1982 and was a farm team of the Milwaukee Brewers the first four years and the California Angels the last two years. In 1980, the team won the Eastern League championship. The nickname 'Millers' was derived from the many paper mills that Holyoke was noted for, especially in the first half of the 20th century. 1981 Holyoke Millers Tom Kayser was general manager and was in his second season as an owner of the Millers. Kayser had been with the club since it moved from Pittsfield, Massachusetts in 1977. Jim Saul was the new manager of the Millers, replacing Lee Sigman who had left the club to become manager of the Vancouver Canadians of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League. Like Sigman, Saul had a long history in baseball as both a player, a catcher, and as a coach and manager. Saul was going into his sixth season as a manager when he joined the Holyoke Millers, having made stops in Salinas, California, Midland and El Paso, Texas. Helping Saul with managerial duties were Dave Thomas and Dave Comforti. who were both interns from the University of Massachusetts and completing their course of study in sports management. T.J. Byrne was a trainer for the club in 1981 and came to the Millers from the Pioneer League's Idaho Falls Angels after the 1980 season.

It was one of the many titles co-created by Rob Liefeld, and released as part of his Extreme Studios imprint. Like many of Liefeld's creations for this and his Maximum Comics line the New Men bore striking similarities to characters from mainstream comic companies; in this case New Men was very similar to Marvel Comics' X-Men franchise. After an initial launch the series underwent a re- design and revamp by writer Eric Stephenson and Penciler Chris Sprouse with Inks by Al Gordon. Publication history The New Men debuted during the Extreme Prejudice imprint wide crossover. Following the end of the crossover story they were given an eponymous 5-issue mini-series. This was a commonly used technique within Image, not just by Liefeld's Extreme Studios, but by most of the co-founders and their imprints. Many notable and top-selling Image titles including The Savage Dragon, Cyberforce and Gen¬π¬≥ started in this manner. The 1994 mini-series was written by Eric Stephenson with art by character designer Jeff Matsuda. Matsuda, Stephenson and Liefeld were also credited as 'co-plotters'. New Men was then granted an ongoing series. Matsuda did not take up the art duties and most of the first 20 issues were pencilled by Todd Nauck. Both mini-series and ongoing series kept a much better schedule than a number of Extreme Comics titles, notably the imprint's 'premiere' title Youngblood. This could be attributed to the minimal role that Rob Liefeld played in the production of the series. Like all of the Extreme titles, a number of issues were taken up by the various imprint-wide crossover storylines, such as Extreme Sacrifice and Babewatch, and the characters, though not the series, were an integral part of the Extreme Destroyer crossover. The series was put on hiatus with issue 20 for the Extreme Destroyer story and was replaced by a 4 issue mini-series, New Force, which starred the same characters and began their revamp. Nauck and Stephenston were again responsible for this. The series resumed after this mini-series via Liefeld's Maximum Comics and received a further revamp, both in plot and style, by Stephenson with Sprouse and Gordon. Until this point reviews and reaction had been mostly lukewarm, but this revamp improved it somewhat. With issue 22 the series was renamed Adventures Of the New Men but despite improved reaction the title fizzled out, possibly due to the problems Liefeld was having with Image Comics and the subsequent problems following his resignation. The Title was not one of the books revived by Awesome Comics and seems to have been lost to obscurity. Fictional character biographies The New Men were 'Nu-Gene' positive teenagers who had banded together supposedly for their own protection under the guidance of a middle aged mentor. 'Nu- Genes' were Extreme Comics' universe's equivalent of Marvel's Mutants, and were also the in-universe explanation for mythical beasts such as Fairies, Centaurs, Vampires and Werewolves; initially thought to be a generic 'default' like the Mutant Gene, it was later revealed to have been the result of genetic tampering by a race of aliens (The Keep) as a way to sort the weak, and increase the strong. The New Men's mentor was also later revealed to have been a worshipper of this alien race, keeping the Nu-Genes for their eventual return to harvest them. Initially the group was five teens: a telepath/telekinetic Reign, (Jason Drew) who initially used a focusing gem he wore on his forehead, but later found it had mind-controlling properties and abandoned its use; Byrd, (Adam Booth) who was friendly and laid back, began with small wings that protruded from his arms, but later evolved further growing feathers, talons and other bird-like features; a blonde speedster called Dash, (Lisa Richards) who was involved in romantic relations with Byrd and Reign; Exit, (Derrick Rowland) who could teleport via entering another dimension (he was later replaced by a being from this dimension, Charade); and Kodiak, (Thomas Runningbear Jr.) the youngest member (who was apparently Native American), who could turn into a giant man-beast. Kodiak later both lost the ability to change and became totally animalistic. Their mentor and leader, John Proctor, who was somewhat untrustworthy. Around this time the New Men are called as part of the trial for the murder case against the Youngblood superhero Knightsabre, who had been accused of killing his teammate Riptide.Judgement Day #1‚Äì3 (June‚ÄìOctober 1997) The events of their ongoing series introduced two old members, Dusk and Narcisse (a vampire), and the team gained two new members ‚Äì Pilot, a time traveller come back from the future to warn the New Men of the coming of The Keep and the truth about the Nu-Gene, and Bootleg, a student who could copy other's powers and use them. Another member was a young Australian man named Pastime, who was able to manipulate the flow of time. Although he only remained with the New Men for a short time he still formed close ties with the group. When not tying into the imprint- wide crossovers, the team fights against various re-occurring enemies and secret organisations, most of which tied into their being 'Nu-Gene Positive' (i.e. 'The Brotherhood of Man') though there was often combat with Khyber, an old ally/acquaintance/enemy of theirs. Of note, Dash experienced an accelerated pregnancy with Reign's child, a child that also suffered from accelerated growth and development, becoming an adult with a very short period of time. Exit was replaced by Charade and in the New Blood story-arc the team also encountered The New Man (who was also granted his own short-running ongoing series), a time traveller who may have been Dash's child. When the Keep eventually returned during the Extreme Destroyer crossover, Proctor's Keep sympathies were revealed and Reign killed him with a psychic blast in a rage. The New Men were among the many characters, including Youngblood's Shaft (who thought himself human) and Glory, who were captured by the Keep; Dash was branded by them. After this the team experienced a personal crisis and backlash to the event (against Nu-Genes) as New Force, including the destruction of their home (Proctor's house), and the loss of Dust and Narcisse. They also gained their final new member, Sundance, who was the herald of The Shepard, who led the Keep's return. Following their revamp the team tried to live normal lives, but this, of course, did not last, and they encountered a shadowy organisation who sent a Chris Sprouce-designed character Bette Nior to kill them.

It is a fictional account of how Queen Victoria was eventually brought out of her mourning for her dead husband, Prince Albert. It was directed by Jean Negulesco, written and produced by Nunnally Johnson and based on the 1949 novel of the same name by American artillery sergeant and San Francisco newspaperman Theodore Bonnet (1908‚Äì1983). It stars Irene Dunne, Alec Guinness and Andrew Ray. \\"Mudlarks\\" were street children who survived by scavenging and selling what they could find on the banks of the River Thames. The film was a hit in Britain and made an overnight star of Andrew Ray, who played the title character. Plot A young street urchin (Andrew Ray), half-starved and homeless, finds a cameo containing the likeness of Queen Victoria (Irene Dunne). Not recognizing her, he is told that she is the \\"mother of all England\\". Taking the remark literally, he journeys to Windsor Castle to see her. When he is caught by the palace guards, the boy is mistakenly thought to be part of an assassination plot against the Queen. Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli (Alec Guinness) realises that the boy is innocent and pleads for him in Parliament, delivering a speech that indirectly criticizes the Queen for withdrawing from public life. The Queen is infuriated by the speech, but she is genuinely moved upon meeting the boy for the first time, and once again enters public life. Cast * Irene Dunne as Queen Victoria * Alec Guinness as Benjamin Disraeli * Andrew Ray as Wheeler * Beatrice Campbell as Lady Emily Prior * Finlay Currie as John Brown, Queen Victoria's servant (gillie) * Anthony Steel as Lieutenant Charles McHatten * Raymond Lovell as Sergeant Footman Naseby * Marjorie Fielding as Lady Margaret Prior * Constance Smith as Kate Noonan * Edward Rigby as The Watchman * Ernest Clark as Hammond * Wilfrid Hyde-White as Tucker Award nomination The Mudlark was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Costume Design in a black-and-white film (Edward Stevenson and Margaret Furse). Historical inspiration In Theodore Bonnet's semi-historical novel upon which this film was based, the story of the young mudlark Wheeler (aged ten in the film, but seven in the book) sneaking into Windsor Castle in 1875 to see Queen Victoria was inspired by a 14 December 1838 incident involving \\"the boy Jones\\", as newspapers called him. A boy was discovered in Buckingham Palace. At first mistaken for a chimney-sweep, until he ran off across the lawns, he was apprehended by a policeman. (Sweeping of chimneys by boys was not made illegal until 1840.) The boy gave his name as Edward Cotton and said that he had been born in the palace; later he claimed to have been living there for only a year, after having come from Hertfordshire. In fact, his name was Edward Jones, the 14-year-old son of a tailor who lived in Bell Yard, some 300 yards distant from the palace. The tailor had turned him out for ill conduct. He had been employed as an errand boy by a carver and gilder in Coventry Street, but had disappeared three days previous to his arrest after saying that he wanted to see the palace's Grand Staircase to sketch it and also to see the Queen (who was actually then at Windsor). At the Westminster Sessions on 28 December, the magistrate's court jury found him not guilty of theft and he was taken back by his employer, who described him as an extremely good lad. (Some details were taken from contemporary reports in the London newspapers The Times, The Sun and The Standard.) The full history of the intruder has been revealed in Jan Bondeson's book Queen Victoria's Stalker: The Strange Story of the Boy Jones (2010). The novel The Mudlark refers to the seven-year-old waif from the East End but it also could be said to figuratively refer to the British PM Disraeli who came from humble beginnings, and whose life is described in some detail. The novel also manages to give a personality to the Fenians and the Irish question, it includes two love affairs as well as the latitude given by Queen Victoria to her Scottish gillie Brown and the relationship between Victoria and her subjects. It also includes the beginnings of enlightened social reform through parliamentary action, and the further extension of British world influence and of Britain's imperial power in India. And for added humour, some bureaucratic overlap and exaggerated suspicions. Production Anthony Steel had just become a film name in The Wooden Horse.

Submarine Troy was a , submarine designed to look like a great white shark. It was created by oceanographer Fabien Cousteau and engineer Eddie Paul's E.P. Industries so that Cousteau could observe and film sharks in their natural habitat without chumming the water. The submarine had space for one person, Cousteau, who piloted the vehicle while lying on his stomach, propped up on his elbows. A wet sub, Troy was filled with water while operating. To breathe, Cousteau carried full diving gear weighing about , providing about 6.5 hours of air. To prevent air bubbles leaving the vessel, spent air was redirected into two empty tanks. Cousteau entered Troy by flipping open the \\"head\\" and crawling in backwards. Troy was covered in SkinFlex fabric combined with glass and sand to make it look and feel like shark skin. The \\"skin\\" was sewn together on the top and held together with Velcro on the bottom. Under that was a layer of bullet- proof Lexan and steel \\"ribs\\" to allow the submarine to survive a shark attack. The spine was made out of flexible plastic. Scars and epoxy teeth were added for realism. Troy was designed to move in a shark-like manner using a series of joysticks to control speed, direction, and pitch. The eyes could roll, the gills puffed, and the mouth opened and closed to enable shark-like communication. Its tail functioned as a rudder and was powered by compressed air. A propulsion system designed by the United States Navy kept noise to a minimum. The submarine could move forward at up to 5 knots, but was unable to react quickly. Depth was controlled by three inflatable buoyancy bags. Unlike real sharks, Troy was odorless. Troy had three cameras to film its surroundings. Originally, cameras were positioned in the shark's eyes but the resulting images were too \\"disconcerting to try to make sense of\\" in real time, so the camera was moved to the top of the shark's head, disguised as a fish. An infrared camera was hidden in a suckerfish attached to the shark's body. The pilot had a video monitor showing him what was going on outside the shark. Originally Troy had a $100,000 budget and two-month time frame. After a year of trial and error in Paul's workshop and pool, the submarine was finally ready for open water testing. Due, in part, to simultaneous documentary filming, overtime payments accumulated and the vessel ended up costing $200,000. It was originally named \\"Sushi\\". Normally, sharks' behavior is affected by the attempts to observe them, with chumming and shark cages leading to footage of aggressive, open mouthed sharks that does not represent their natural behavior. Troy thus allowed Cousteau to observe the animal in more natural way. \\"You must 'become' one of them ... to witness what sharks do amongst themselves naturally\\", Cousteau remarked. \\"By better understanding them we can take one more step towards eliminating the demon image we have created in our minds.\\" After some initial apprehension, sharks appeared to view Troy as another shark. They stayed about away from it, the length of an adult shark, and rolled their eyes, puffed their gills, and changed directions in response to it. These behaviors were observed only in the presence of the shark, not with free divers. Based on the behavior, Cousteau said it appeared Troy was accepted as a dominant female by other great white sharks, but added that he was hesitant to say the behavior proved the sharks saw the submarine as a shark. Inspiration Troy was inspired by The Adventures of Tintin comic Red Rackham's Treasure () in which Tintin uses a shark-like submarine as part of his search for the titular treasure.A la recherche du tr√©sor de Rackham le Rouge (French for \\"In Search of Red Rackham's Treasure\\") by Herg√©, with comments by Daniel Couvreur and Fr√©d√©ric Soumois, published by Editions Moulinsart in November 2007, Unlike in Troy, Professor Calculus' design from the comic has the driver sit upright. Cousteau first read the comic at age seven. Troy, whose name derived from the idea of a \\"Trojan horse\\", was often described as the \\"Trojan shark\\". Impact Troy attracted a great deal of international media attention. It was featured in Australia's Sunday Telegraph and Sun Herald, and the United Kingdom's Daily Telegraph and The Independent, among other publications. In the United States, National Geographic and The New York Times were among dozens of publications with lengthy articles about the submarine. According to Cousteau, his crew was able to get good data on great white territorial boundaries using Troy. Shark: Mind of a Demon Troy was used to make a documentary to demonstrate that great white sharks were not mindless and dangerous animals.Shark-Shaped Submarine Is Latest Cousteau Star Vehicle The documentary, named Shark: Mind of a Demon, was produced by Deep Blue Productions and aired on CBS. In total, Cousteau filmed about 170 hours of footage, which were also made available for scientific study. The film tracked both Troys development and its use in action. In the film, tensions run high between Cousteau and his crew as the vehicle frequently malfunctions. Film critic Andrew Wallenstein said the human drama of the film is compelling, but found it did not teach him much about sharks. Television critic Linda Stasi called it \\"a self-indulgent vanity project.\\" References External links *National Geographic Channel Image Category:Research submarines ","title":"Troy (submarine)"},{"id":"7222038","text":"WWV may refer to: * The World as Will and Representation, a philosophical book by Arthur Schopenhauer * Wagner-Werk-Verzeichnis, an index to the musical works of Richard Wagner * Weera Wickrama Vibhushanaya, a Sri Lanakan military decoration * WWV (radio station), a shortwave radio station which broadcasts official U.S. Government time signals * Wayne Wheeled Vehicles, a manufacturer of school buses in the 1990s * World War Veterans, a progressive organisation of American veterans of World War I ","title":"WWV"},{"id":"7222042","text":"Gold coin of Bartolomeo Gradenigo: the Doge kneeling in front of Saint Marc.

It was also characterized by some diplomatic moves towards Genoa. The most important event was the tempest that struck against Venice on 15 February 1340 and which, according to legend, was pushed back only through the supernatural intercession of St. Mark, St. George and St. Nicholas, brought to the lagoon by a humble fisherman. After the storm had disappeared, the three saints gave the fisherman a ring, called \\"Ring of the Fisherman\\", which he gave to the doges and has since then been part of the ducal jewelry.

Originally mediate Vogts of the Patriarchs of Aquileia, the Counts of Gorizia (Meinhardiner) ruled over several fiefs in the area of Lienz and in the Friuli region of northeastern Italy with their residence at Gorizia (G√∂rz). In 1253 the Counts of Gorizia inherited the County of Tyrol, from 1271 onwards ruled by the Gorizia-Tyrol branch which became extinct in the male line in 1335. The younger line ruled the comital lands of Gorizia and Lienz until its extinction in 1500, whereafter the estates were finally acquired by the Austrian House of Habsburg. History Bruck Castle, Lienz Count Meinhard I, a descendant of the Meinhardiner noble family with possessions around Lienz in the Duchy of Bavaria, is mentioned as early as 1107. As a vogt official of the Patriarchs of Aquileia, he was enfeoffed with large estates in the former March of Friuli, including the town of Gorizia, and from 1127 on called himself a Graf von G√∂rz. The borders of the county changed frequently in the following four centuries, due to frequent wars with Aquileia and other counties, but also to the subdivision of the territory in two main nuclei: one around the Bavarian ancestral seat of Lienz on the upper Drava River up to Innichen in the Puster Valley, the other centered on Gorizia in Friuli itself. Gorizia-Tyrol Meinhard's descendant Count Meinhard III of Gorizia, a follower of the Hohenstaufen emperor Frederick II, upon the extinction of the ducal House of Babenberg was appointed administrator of Styria in 1248. He campaigned the adjacent Duchy of Carinthia but was defeated by the troops of Duke Bernhard von Spanheim and his son Archbishop Philip of Salzburg at Greifenburg in 1252. Nevertheless, the county reached the apex of its power, when Meinhard III inherited County of Tyrol (as Meinhard I) from his father-in-law Count Albert IV one year later. Gorizia Castle After Count Meinhard III had died in 1258, his sons at first ruled jointly until in 1271 they divided their heritage: While the elder Meinhard IV took the comital Tyrolean lands west of the Puster Valley, his brother Albert retained the Meinhardiner ancestral lands around Lienz and Gorizia. After his death, the County of Gorizia was again partitioned among his sons into the \\"inner county\\" at Gorizia, ruled by Henry III, and the \\"outer county\\" around Lienz und Albert II. When Count Henry III was assassinated in 1323, the Gorizia lands were shattered into four countries. The Counts of Gorizia temporarily controlled the Italian March of Treviso (Marca Trevigiana) and the remains of the Istrian march around Pazin (Mitterburg), which Count Albert III of G√∂rz bequeathed to the House of Habsburg in 1365. In 1365 Count Meinhard VI of G√∂rz was granted the princely title by the Luxembourg emperor Charles IV, the county was thereon called Gef√ºrstete Grafschaft G√∂rz. The Meinhardiner nevertheless suffered a steep decline under their powerful neighbours, the Austrian lands of the Habsburg dynasty and the Republic of Venice. After the Habsburgs had acquired the Carinthian duchy with the March of Carniola in 1335 and the County of Tyrol in 1363, the remaining Gorizia lands of Lienz were a thorn in their side, separating the dynasty's \\"hereditary lands\\". Venice had conquered the former Patriarchate territories in Friuli, which were incorporated into the Domini di Terraferma by 1434. The Council of Ten strived for the adjacent \\"inner county\\" lands around Gorizia up to the Venetian Stato da M√†r territories in Istria. Due to the pressure, the Gorizia counts took their residence at Bruck Castle in Lienz. Habsburg Inner and Outer Gorizia territories (in white), late 15th century In 1429 the county was reunited under the single rule of Count Henry VI. His son, the last count Leonhard, died in 1500 and despite claims raised by Venice, according to a contract of inheritance the county fell to the Habsburg emperor Maximilian I. While the Lienz area was administrated with the Tyrolean crown land, the \\"inner county\\" of Gorizia remained an Imperial State of the Holy Roman Empire ruled by the Inner Austrian Archdukes as part of the Austrian Circle, governed by a capitano. Its territory included the Isonzo Valley down to Aquileia, the area of Cormons and Duino, and the former Venetian fortress of Gradisca, which was conquered by Imperial troops in 1511. Monfalcone formed a Venetian exclave in the county from 1420 to 1797. In 1647 Emperor Ferdinand III separated the \\"Principality of Gradisca\\" from Gorizia for his courtier Johann Anton von Eggenberg, until in 1747 both were again merged to form the Princely County of Gorizia and Gradisca, a crown land of the Habsburg Monarchy.

Spark carries a variety of content catering for both mainstream and niche musical audiences, specialising in chart hits and new music throughout the day, and specialist programming after 7 pm. The radio station broadcasts on 107.00FM and online via the station's website. The official launch of Spark took place at the new ¬£12 million CitySpace building in the centre of the city of Sunderland. History The station began broadcasting in November 1997 as Radio Utopia a two-week short term broadcast under the (then) Radio Authority's Restricted Service Licence (RSL) scheme. The station was part of a regional arts festival called \\"Visions of Utopia\\" and the station reflected the scheme and carried various programmes tied-in with the scheme, such as \\"The Quakies\\" a programme produced by children from the former pit village of Quaking Houses in County Durham. Radio broadcasting predated this by several years, with student programming on the community radio station Wear FM, which closed in 1995 and is now the more commercial station Sun FM. The station was low powered but still proved valuable as a training ground for new broadcasters. Programmes were broadcast from studios in the Forster Building, formerly used by Wear FM, with a transmitter on the roof. The station was rebranded the following November as \\"107 Utopia FM\\" and developed a more formatted sound and joined the \\"Student Broadcast Network\\" (SBN) bringing news, national programmes and a 24-hour service to the station. Utopia returned in September 1999 for the first ever freshers broadcast and again proved its value for students and volunteers. The station largely draws volunteers from the University's large undergraduate media courses but has also been part of wider community radio programmes with projects in County Durham, Washington and Sunderland. During the following years Utopia broadcast more frequently, getting up to broadcasts twice a year. In 2002 Utopia began broadcasting on the 102.4FM frequency. In 2003 the station began to use new studios in the ¬£11m Media Centre at the St. Peter's Campus, when media teaching moved there that year. The old studios have now been demolished and the building is now used to teach courses run by the University's School of Education and Lifelong Learning. The move also facilitated the recording of sessions in The Media Centre's new radio and television studios. The station applied for a Community Radio Licence from OFCOM in the 2nd licensing round and was awarded a licence in 2007. The station took on the new name of Spark when it launched in 2009. The name is a reflection of the University logo, which they call a 'spark' in homage to the shipyards that were central to the growth of Sunderland. Volunteers from the station have not only succeeded in gaining recognition in the annual student radio awards in the UK but also awards from the New York Festivals. Station alumni are now found working for BBC and Commercial stations across the UK. Community licence and rebrand When the UK media regulator Ofcom announced a plan to issue Community Radio licences, work began at the station to apply for a Full Time licence. This application was made in early in 2007. In September 2007, Ofcom awarded Utopia FM a full-time 5 year Community Radio licence.Ofcom licence awards September 2007 It was announced in June 2009 that Utopia FM would be changing its name to 107 Spark FM to signal the change in licence and the broadening of the audience.107 Spark FM, TV and Magazine About In 2012, Spark was awarded 'Best North East Radio Station' in the 'Nations & Regional Awards'. In late 2013, the '107' branding was removed for the station and the station was simply known as 'Spark' or 'Spark FM'. In 2015, the station was updated with a refreshed logo, a slogan change to 'Where Sunderland Lives', new on-air imaging provided by Reelworld and a brand new website. As of 2016, the station is now referred to as 'Spark' only on air, dropping the 'fm' suffix. Programming, music and output The majority of Spark's programming is broadcast live from its studio at the David Puttnam Media Centre at St.Peters Campus of University of Sunderland. Spark broadcasts at least eight hours of original programming each weekday, while overnights are non-stop music.

H. Bullen, (9 February 1857, London ‚Äì 29 February 1920, Stratford-on-Avon) was an English editor and publisher, a specialist in 16th and 17th century literature, and founder of the Shakespeare Head Press, which for its first decades was a publisher of fine editions in the tradition of the Kelmscott Press. Photograph of A. H. Bullen by Emery Walker His father George Bullen (d. 1894) was librarian at the British Museum. A. H. Bullen's interest in Elizabethan dramatists and poets started at the City of London School, before he went to Worcester College, Oxford to study classics. His publishing career began with a scholarly edition of the Works of John Day in 1881 and continued with series of English Dramatists and a seven- volume set of Old English Plays, some of which he had discovered in manuscript and published for the first time. He was also the first person to publish some early lyric poems. Bullen wrote more than 150 articles for the Dictionary of National Biography, lectured on Elizabethan dramatists at Oxford University and taught at Toynbee Hall. In 1891 he and H. W. Lawrence went into partnership as the publishers Lawrence & Bullen. This lasted until 1900 when Bullen moved on to publish as A. H. Bullen. With Frank Sidgwick as partner, he then formed the Shakespeare Head Press and published a collected Shakespeare and collected Yeats from their base in Stratford-on-Avon. Bullen was admired by literary figures like Swinburne and was well known in his time for his enthusiastic scholarship and for rediscovering forgotten works of literature, most notably those of Thomas Campion. Because he modernised as he published, his texts are not used as standard editions by scholars today. After Bullen's death the press was continued by a partnership including Basil Blackwell, the Oxford bookseller. It continues today as an imprint of Wiley-Blackwell, now printing on normal commercial presses. Sources *Richard Storer's article on Bullen in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (2004) *H.

The assumption of national psychology is that different ethnic groups, or the people living in a national territory, are characterized by a distinctive \\"mix\\" of human attitudes, values, emotions, motivation and abilities which is culturally reinforced by language, the family, schooling, the state and the media. As a scientific discipline According to the German pioneer psychologist Wilhelm Wundt, the attempt to theorize scientifically about national psychology dates from the mid-19th century . In post-1871 Germany, but especially during the Third Reich, some German professors of linguistics and literature tried to influence English studies with a politically motivated \\"cultural science\\", which Ernst Leisi called the \\"Nationalpsychologische Methode.\\"Ernst Leisi, Das heutige Englisch: Wesensz√ºge und Probleme (Heidelberg, 1955; rev. ed. 1985), p. 15. This paradigm presented a new view of contemporary and past English, on the basis of analogies drawn between specific linguistic traits, practices and constituents of the English (and German) national character. But in reality it amounted to little more than a repetition of preconceived notions of otherness.Richard J. Utz, \\"Criticism and the Nation: The Nationalpsychologische Methode in German Anglistics, 1918-1955,\\" in: Moeurs et images. Etudes d'imagologie europ√©enne, ed. Alain Montandon (Clermont-Ferrand: Centre de Recherches sur les Litt√©ratures Modernes et Contemporaines, 1997), pp. 121-27. Around 1900, national psychology had become an accepted topic of study in the social sciences, at universities in Europe and North America. Use National psychology plays a role in politics via the ideology of nationalism. Politicians will appeal e.g. to \\"the French people\\", \\"the American people\\", the \\"Russian people\\", the idea being that members of a nation have a common national identity, are part of a national community, and share common interests (the \\"national interest\\"). Politicians must try to unify and integrate people to work together for common goals, and appealing to their common national characteristics is often part of that. Closely related is the idea of the national character which refers to the values, norms and customs which people of a nation typically hold, their typical emotional responses, and what they regard as virtue and vice - all factors which determine how they will habitually respond to situations. Nationalism aims to unite people as members of a nation, and for that purpose, the belief that they really have common national characteristics is obviously useful, even if those common characteristics cannot be proved beyond a shared language and a similar physical appearance. Friendly rivalry between national sports teams is often used to symbolize national identity, or to express patriotism. For example, in South Africa sport is \\"the national religion. Transcending race, politics or language group, sport unites the country ‚Äì and not just the male half of it.\\"http://www.southafrica.info \\"Sport in South Africa\\", retrieved 15 January 2013. National psychology has sometimes been used to explain why economic development occurred in a different way in different countries, or why a particular turn of political events happened as it did. Reference is sometimes made to the \\"national psyche\\" or the \\"soul\\" of a nation, to explain why some public events can trigger a commotion or uproar in a country, or why a particular nation gets particularly enthusiastic or obsessed with a sport or cultural practice. The idea is that a nation shares a specific cultural mentality, morality or mindset, embedded in its language and institutions, which causes it to react much more strongly, or much less strongly, to particular situations than people of other nations would, and that people from different nations have different problem-solving strategies. Criticism of the concept However, the validity of the idea of a \\"national psychology\\" has been strongly criticized, for political, moral and scientific reasons. Part of the problem is also that researchers usually interpret another culture from the point of view of the culture they are used to (regarded as \\"normal\\"). Even if many people in a country share a common psychological or biological characteristic, other people in that country may not share that characteristic at all. The important ways in which people differ may outweigh the common characteristics which they can all be proved to share. Psychologists have found in research that when subjects are asked to identify the ethnicity or nationality of individuals by observing a line-up of different people, they cannot accurately recognize what their ethnicity or nationality is. Marketing and Media experts have found that at most people can identify a representative stereotype, archetype or caricature which symbolises a particular ethnic group, or characteristic ways of relating which a nation has. Some additional complications are, that: *the mentality of a nation may change over time, through shared experiences, and therefore that the characteristics which are thought to be \\"typical\\" of a nation may change over time. In modern society, often the young generation no longer identifies with the ways of the old generation, including their ideas of national identity and norms. *large-scale international migration of peoples from different nations means that immigrants take on part of the habits and culture of the country to which they move, while also retaining part of their original culture. In this way, different national cultures are merged or mixed, and a new culture may be formed which has no clear \\"national\\" identification. This, together with the growth of international tourism, also means that people in one country increasingly adopt customs and habits from other countries, so that a nationally distinctive culture declines. *When there are fights about identity, when people feel insecure about their identity, or when they try to get their identity accepted by others, a lot of people may claim they have important characteristics in common, or that they differ greatly from others, even although there is in truth little objective evidence for it. A fairly large \\"national movement\\" may appear of people sharing a national belief, even although in reality they do not have all that much in common. That is, people's desire to feel that they have something in common, makes them act \\"as though\\" it already exists, even though this is not really true. Because of all these difficulties in defining national psychology, often the most insightful portrayals of it are not really \\"scientific\\", but are found rather in the metaphors of fiction, for example in novels and films. These can gives insight into the \\"typical\\" emotional and intellectual world of a people, without pretending to apply to all its members. Globalization and postmodernity Some writers argue that in the era of globalisation,Paul Kennedy and Catherine J. Danks, Globalization and National Identities. Crisis or Opportunity? New York: Palgrave, 2001. national or ethnic differences can less and less explain why people behave as they do. Increasingly, it seems that many people do not identify with being part of a nation, and just want to be recognized as a human being with human rights. They might cherish the place where they were born, without however being particularly patriotic. Other writers note that appeals to a national identity can be revived and used as a xenophobic response to perceptions that a country or region is being \\"taken over\\" by foreign corporations, or \\"overrun\\" by foreign immigrants. Especially in Europe but also in many other parts of the world, adherence to a religion has strongly declined, and therefore the shared view of morality and human nature which religious authorities previously provided is no longer accepted. Religion has had a very strong influence on the shaping of national identity, and as this influence has declined, it can no longer define a national psychology as it used to. However, in other parts of the world, religions have increased their influence, and then national identity and religious identity may influence each other quite significantly. In some strands of postmodernism, nations are no longer viewed as legally enforced territories but as imagined communities in which national identification becomes increasingly vaguer. Thus, for example, Michel Foucault claimed that in the West, \\"the project of the science of the subject has gravitated, in ever- narrowing circles, around the question of sex\\" (Foucault, The history of sexuality, Vol. 1, Vintage, p. 70). This could be understood to mean that people really identify more with sexuality than nationality nowadays. Nevertheless, despite controversy, the concept of a \\"national psychology\\" still persists, insofar as people can observe practically e.g. through tourism and television that there are definitely differences in the way people live life, and how they think about it, in different countries, quite apart from differences in physical appearance or language. There are nowadays books on the national character of practically every people on earth. Modern studies Modern scientific studies of national psychology try to avoid the traps of prejudice and discrimination, mainly focusing fairly strictly on what can actually be measured, tested and proved objectively, but also by taking a positive (or at least neutral) view of national culture. The modern emphasis is on whether systematic patterns of national differences can be genuinely proved to exist, what they are, and how they can be explained.Alex Inkeles, National character. A social-psychological perspective. Transaction publishers, 1997. To an important extent, this approach is more successful than the old psychology, because much more attempt is made to verify hypotheses with comprehensive evidence, instead of making speculative guesses, or basing theories on anecdotal evidence. Yet researchers often cannot avoid altogether being drawn into disputes about national sentiments, sometimes making it difficult to stay neutral, detached and objective.

He has illustrated a number of novels, and worked for a while with DC Comics.  Biography  A sample of Bermejo's work, from American magazine Creepy #71. Bermejo initially learned the trade as the assistant of Manuel Gago, before he began his comic book artist career in Britain in the late 1950s when through the agency A.L.I., he worked in the titles Girls Crystal and Tarzan Weekly. He worked on Thriller Picture, John Steel, War, Battle Picture Libraries, and Pike Mason in the early 1960s. In 1962 he started drawing the war-themed comic strip Mann of Battle for The Eagle, and would draw the strip Heros the Spartan for that title in 1963. Later in the 1960s he would draw the super hero Johnny Future. For much of the 1960s, Bermejo worked out of a studio in Valencia, Spain for the agency Bardon Arts with other artists including Jos√© Ortiz, Miguel Quesada, and Emilio Frego. These artists including Bermejo started working with Italian agent Pierro D'Ami in 1968, where they would do many paintings for books and magazines. During this period Bermejo would do a number of comic strips for the magazines Tell Me Why, Once Upon a Time, Look and Learn and Tiny Tots. In 1974 Bermejo, along with fellow Valencia Studio artists Jos√© Ortiz and Leopoldo Sanchez joined the agency Selecciones Ilustradas and soon started working for Warren Publishing in U.S.A. Bermejo quickly became one of the most prolific artists for Warren, and would draw a total of 78 stories from 1974 through 1983, more than any other artist except for Jos√© Ortiz and Esteban Maroto. Highlights of Bermejo's period with Warren included a full issue of Creepy (issue 71) dedicated to him, as well as the role of the primary artist for The Rook, which was Warren's most well known recurring character after Vampirella. Bermejo would also draw the serial The Fox in Vampirella in 1981 - 1982. He would win the award for Best All Around Artist at Warren in 1981. Bermejo would write and draw an adaption of El Se√±or de los Anillos (The Lord of the Rings) in Spain in 1980. After Warren's collapse, he would draw for Skorpio and Lanciostory in Italy, as well as Relatos Nuevo Mundo, Metropol and Zona 84 in Spain. He also created comics adaptations from the works of Isaac Asimov and Raymond Chandler.

August 1910 The Fal-Car, originally known as A Car Without A Name, was an American automobile manufactured from 1909 until 1914 by a company that identified itself in advertisements only as Department C, 19 North May Street, Chicago. The address had previously been the location where the Reliable-Dayton automobile had been built. It was advertised as \\"trim, classy, speedy and efficient\\". The idea behind the name, or lack thereof, was that it would allow its buyers of the generic vehicle to name the vehicle as they wished (or as ego permitted), without the expense or bother of setting up their own automobile concern. Such practices in the early days of the automobile market were not uncommon, however most companies that were involved with such endeavors at least had publicly known names. The A Car Without A Name was equipped with a 30 hp engine, three-speed transmission, came in three body styles (roadster, coupe-tonneau and touring car), and priced below $1,700 per unit. Because the car had no name, it is impossible to find a concrete production number for the period that builds were undertaken. By 1910, the Car was given an official name, the F.A.L. or Fal-Car, which was derived by its backers last names of Fauntleroy, Averill and Lowe. The Fal-Car continued in production through 1914 at its factory in Chicago until its assets were liquidated at auction. The former business location became an empty lot.

The Soviet designation for her class was Project 45. She was completed in 1941 and fought in World War II as part of the Baltic Fleet. She was indigenously designed in contrast to the Type 7 which was built with Italian assistance and intended as a prototype for future Soviet destroyers. She was not a successful ship, with severe problems with her machinery and stability. Her intended armament of twin-gun turrets were transferred to the destroyer leader and replaced by single gun mounts. Design The Specifications (TTZ in Russian) for this ship were issued in 1934. The ship was intended as a prototype to test a new propulsion system, which was intended to use high-pressure Wagner-type boilers developed by Germany. The Wagner boilers were more compact and powerful than conventional boilers and used super-heated steam (75 atmospheres vs. the 26‚Äì27 atmospheres in conventional boilers used for the Project 7 destroyers). The machinery was mounted in a unit layout with two funnels and alternating boiler rooms and engine rooms. The design speed was 42 knots Due to the weight savings it was designed to mount three twin enclosed gun turrets in positions A, X and Y similar to the Japanese s. A new gun system, the B-2LM, was developed for this ship however due to poor weight control the twin turrets were substituted for single guns. Service The ship was built by Shipyard No. 190 (Zhdanov) in Leningrad, laid down as yard number 500 on 26 June 1935 under the name Sergo Ordzhonikidze.

Named after Gorizia Castle in Gorizia (now in Italy, on the border with Slovenia), they were originally \\"advocates\\" (Vogts) in the Patriarchate of Aquileia who ruled the County of Gorizia (G√∂rz) from the early 12th century until the year 1500. Staunch supporters of the Emperors against the papacy, they reached the height of their power in the aftermath of the battle of Marchfeld between the 1280s and 1310s, when they controlled most of contemporary Slovenia, western and south- western Austria and north-eastern Italy. After 1335, they began a steady decline until their territories shrunk back to the original County of Gorizia by the mid 1370s. Their remaining lands were inherited by the Habsburg ruler Maximilian I. From 1253, the dynasty ruled the County of Tyrol. In 1271, their vast possessions were split. The main branch kept the recently acquired Tyrol and became known as Counts of Gorizia-Tyrol or the Meinhardiner Line after Meinhard, Duke of Carinthia. The cadet branch, known as the Albertine Line, after Meinhard's younger brother Albert, took over the original possessions in the County of Gorizia, the Puster Valley, as well as the title of palatine counts in Carinthia (together with the domains in the upper Drava Valley). Both branches participated in the coalition against the Premyslid king Ottokar II of Bohemia on the side of king Rudolf I of Germany and were awarded vast estates after the former's defeat in the Battle of Marchfeld. In 1286, the Gorizia-Tyrol line became Dukes of Carinthia and landraves of Carniola, and took over de facto rule in Savinja, while the Albertine branch was granted most of the Windic March and the County of Metlika. In 1306 and again from 1307 to 1310, Henry of Gorizia-Tyrol ruled as King of Bohemia and hold the titular title of King of Poland, due to his marriage with the P≈ôemyslid heiress Anne. However, as Henry left no male heirs, the Gorizia-Tyrol branch became extinct upon the death of his daughter Margaret in 1369. Their lands were inherited by the Habsburgs. The Albertine line maintained the rule in the comital lands around Gorizia, in the Puster Valley and in western Carinthia (which comprised the territory of contemporary East Tyrol) until the year 1500, when the family's last count (Leonhard of Gorizia) died without an heir. His remaining estates were inherited by the Austrian House of Habsburg.  History  The dynasty probably hailed from the Rhenish Franconian Siegharding dynasty, which originally descended from the Kraichgau region and in the 10th century ruled in the Chiemgau of the German stem duchy of Bavaria. One Sieghardinger named Meginhard (or Meinhard, d. 1090) is documented as a count in the Bavarian gau of Pustertal. The progenitor of the Meinhardiner, Count Meinhard I of Gorizia, and his brother Engelbert, count palatine of Bavaria, may be his sons. The dynasty first appeared around Lienz and in the 11th century gained the office of a vogt at the town of Gorizia (G√∂rz) in the Patriarchate of Aquileia. Gorizia-Tyrol Albert VI of Austria, 1459 Tyrol already in the early and later Middle Ages was an important mountain pass area with the lowest crossings over the Central Eastern Alps, vital for the Holy Roman Emperors to reach the Kingdom of Italy. The centres of the Imperial power were initially two Prince-bishoprics established by Emperor Conrad II in 1027, Brixen (Bressanone) and Trient (Trento). The bishops were the sovereigns of many semi-free compulsory henchmen (ministeriales) and local noblemen which styled until today the scenery with their numerous castles mostly south of the Brenner Pass. One of that noble families were the Counts of Tyrol, named after the Castle Tyrol near the town of Meran. They speedily ascended as bailiffs, who exercised the judicial power for the Trient and Brixen prince-bishops and finally took over the secular power in southern Bavaria after the deposition of the Welf duke Henry the Lion in 1180. One result of their becoming rulers of the area, was that the area is now called \\"Tyrol\\", after their ancestral castle. Between 1253 and 1258 the Counts of G√∂rz assumed the power in the Tyrolean lands, after the counts at Castle Tyrol had failed to produce a male heir. In 1237 Count Meinhard III had married Adelheid, daughter of Count Albert IV of Tyrol, who died in 1253 leaving no male heirs, and could in this way claim Tyrol as his inheritance. His son and successor Count Meinhard IV not only expanded the county, but also molded it into a more homogeneous country. He also created an administration, which, by the standards of his time, can only be called exemplary. Nevertheless, the three areas of country were to far apart to be ruled by a single count, and therefore it was decided to divide the county in 1267/71, when Meinhard IV ceded the County of Gorizia to his younger brother Albert I. Albert's descendants, the Gorizia line of the Meinhardiner dynasty, maintained their residence in Gorizia, until the line died out in 1500. The descendants of Meinhard IV, who was Count of Tyrol as Meinhard II, ruled Tyrol until 1363. In 1286 Meinhard IV had also received the rule over the Duchy of Carinthia and the adjacent March of Carniola by the Habsburg king Rudolph I of Germany in turn for his support against King Ottokar II of Bohemia. Meinhard's son Henry in 1306 married Anne, the eldest daughter of King Wenceslaus II of Bohemia, and after the sudden death of his brother-in-law King Wenceslaus III in the same year even ascended the Bohemian throne. He however had to deal with claims raised by the Habsburg scion Rudolph III, son of King Albert I of Germany, and in the long run both could not prevail against Count John of Luxembourg, who became Bohemian king in 1310. Decline As Henry himself left no male heirs upon his death in 1335, the Austrian House of Habsburg inherited Carinthia and Carniola from the Gorizia-Tyrol branch. The Habsburgs held these lands until 1918. Henry's only surviving daughter Margaret \\"Maultasch\\" and her husband John Henry of Luxembourg were able to retain the County of Tyrol. In 1363 she ceded the county to the Habsburg duke Rudolph IV of Austria after her only son with her second husband Duke Louis V of Bavaria, Count Meinhard III of Gorizia-Tyrol had died in the same year. The Counts of Gorizia were moreover the Bailiffs of Aquileja. They are famous in numismatics as publishers of the first German golden coin, the \\"Zwainziger\\". The renowned diplomat and minnesinger Oswald von Wolkenstein was a subject of the Counts of Gorizia. The Gorizia branch of the dynasty became extinct in the year 1500, when the last male family member Count Leonhard of Gorizia died without issue.

It operated from 1925 to 1971. For much of its life it offered exclusive all-Pullman service, and it was the first long-distance train to be entirely air-conditioned. The National Limited was one of many trains discontinued when Amtrak began operations in 1971. Amtrak revived the name for another New York‚ÄìSt. Louis service which did not use the B&O; route.  History  The B&O; had previously operated through cars between New York and western points as the National Limited since December 1916.Herbert H. Harwood, Jr., Royal Blue Line. Sykesville, Md.: Greenberg Publishing, 1990. () The all-Pullman version of the National Limited was introduced by the B&O; on April 26, 1925, as trains 1 (westbound) and 2 (eastbound). B&O;'s New York terminus was actually in Jersey City, New Jersey, at the Central Railroad of New Jersey Terminal.Jersey City Terminal Passengers were then transferred to buses that met the train at the platform. These buses were then ferried across the Hudson River to Manhattan Island, where they proceeded to various \\"stations\\" including the Vanderbilt Hotel, Wanamaker's, Columbus Circle, and Rockefeller Center, as well as into Brooklyn. The National Limited traversed some of the most challenging terrain in eastern railroading. It assaulted the Appalachian Mountains in western Maryland and West Virginia. Even through the diesel era, extra motive power was added at the head-end to take the train over these ridges, which meant extra stops on both sides of the mountain heights to add and remove assisting locomotives. The National Limited was originally an all-Pullman train in the 1920s and 1930s. In addition to compartment and drawing-room sleeping cars, it featured a club car, observation library lounge car, and a full-service dining car. Onboard amenities for the deluxe train's clientele included a secretary, barber, valet, maid, manicure, and shower baths. On April 20, 1932, it became the first long-distance train to be entirely air conditioned.Timothy Jacobs, The History of the Baltimore & Ohio. New York: Crescent Books, 1989. () Connections with southwestern railroads, including the Missouri Pacific, Missouri-Kansas-Texas, Cotton Belt, and the Frisco, were made at St. Louis Union Station. In 1939-1940, the National Limited was streamlined and dieselized. In the 1950s, coaches were added to the train's consist, and a Slumbercoach was first used on this train in 1959. Decline and end The National Limited, in common with most name trains in the U.S. by the late 1950s, suffered steadily declining patronage as the traveling public abandoned trains in favor of airplanes and the automobile. The B&O; gave up on competing with the Pennsylvania Railroad into New York, discontinuing all passenger service north of Baltimore on April 26, 1958. Thereafter, the National Limited operated between Baltimore and St. Louis as a through train until 1966, when Washington, D.C., became its eastern terminus (with a connecting B&O; coach- only train between Washington and Baltimore). In 1967, the United States Post Office dealt a heavy blow to the B&O;, cancelling most of its lucrative Post Office contracts. Most of the train's route through West Virginia, southern Ohio, and south-central Indiana and Illinois was, and continues to be, sparsely populated. Few cities or towns existed along the line that could contribute additional revenue or passengers to the train; indeed, it had never profited from high ridership even in its golden age. Between Cincinnati and St. Louis, the B&O; St. Louis line was single-tracked, and it avoided most of the larger Midwestern cities along the way. While branch lines ran to Columbus, Dayton, Louisville, Indianapolis, Springfield, and other cities and towns, the National Limited bypassed them all. This ultimately would seal the train's fate. The B&O;'s National Limited had its final run on April 30, 1971, when Amtrak took over most passenger routes in the United States but did not continue any B&O; trains at the outset. In 1981, however, it revived the Capitol Limited for the portion of its route east of Pittsburgh. Amtrak Effingham, Illinois in 1979. The National Limited name was subsequently revived by Amtrak for a train from New York to Kansas City, Missouri, via Harrisburg, Pittsburgh, Columbus, Dayton, Indianapolis, and St. Louis. This Amtrak train did not use the B&O; route, instead being the successor of the old Pennsylvania Railroad mainstay, Spirit of St. Louis‚Äìthe principal rival of the old National Limited. After being plagued by numerous delays caused by deteriorating Penn Central track in the Midwest, it was canceled on October 1, 1979. Amtrak's Shenandoah served the National Limited B&O; route from Washington to Cincinnati via Cumberland, Maryland, and Parkersburg, West Virginia, from October 31, 1976, to September 30, 1981.

In 1940 the National Limited received refurbished streamlined heavyweight equipment, similar to what the Capitol Limited had received in 1938.

In 1941 these cars were augmented by several lightweight 10-roomette 5-bedroom sleeping cars. In January 1956 the B&O; acquired three Rivers-series sleeper-buffet-lounge-observation cars originally built in 1939 by Pullman- Standard for the New York Central Railroad. These had previously served on the 20th Century Limited among other trains. Each car contained a compartment, drawing room, and two double bedrooms.

A dragsaw or Drag saw is a large reciprocating saw using a long steel crosscut saw to buck logs to length. Prior to the popularization of the chainsaw during World War II, the dragsaw was a popular means of taking the hard work out of cutting wood. They would only work for a log on the ground. Dragsaws are known as the first mechanical saws to be used in the timber industry operation. These tools were most useful in the logging business, because they were efficient and very resilient. Not to be confused with Steam donkey.  History  The use of stone-cutting dragsaws may have started in the Fourth Dynasty, Egypt, about 4,500 years before its commonly accepted date of invention. Early dragsaws of the modern era were human-powered, steam and later gasoline-powered. The post-modern steam-powered dragsaw was most commonly used in logging industry rather than merely clearing land due to its versatility. Many of the basic design principles from early dragsaws still apply to current products in the industry today.  Types   Human-powered  The human-powered dragsaw was a much more commonly used dragsaw among the general population due to their relatively low cost compared with their higher efficiency. Dragsaws powered by humans would often stem from a lever the person would use to manipulate the saw blade in a much easier manner. Other common formats included foot pedals or Treadles. These allowed for greater maneuverability when clearing a tree.  Engine-powered  Gasoline or kerosene powered drag saws were popular between the 1910s-1940s when chain saws became preferable. They usually did 90 strokes of the saw per minute.http://www.herculesengines.com/hercules/hercnews/hercnews0299.html Most of all gasoline-engine-powered dragsaws were made in Portland, Oregon, United States. Steam-powered dragsaws Were a piston hooked directly to the saw blade. The boiler were separate for easier portability. \\"They were very reliable and very rugged and were significantly more efficient than cutting (bucking) by hand.\\" Some engine-powered dragsaws used a separate engine and were geared to a pulley. Manufacturers: * Ottawa Among the first engine-powered drag saw companies. Saws used a four-cycle Hit 'n miss engine usually equipped with an angled water-hopper. Direct gear drive. * Wolf Iron Works Small machine shop that made saws under their own Timber Wolf name as well as Ward Sawer for Montgomery Wards. Saws were two-cycle and had a round gas tank that contained the radiator. Chain-diriven. The factory today resides at Powerland Heritage Park. * Vaughn Made drag saws of similar design to Wolf between 1909-1948. After drag saws lost popularity Vaughn made tracked tractors. Also made steam- powered drag saws. * Multnomah Named for the county Portland, Oregon is in. * Wee McGregor * R.M. Wade. Preservation Engine enthusiasts and vintage logging machinery collectors have restored many examples of engine powered dragsaws. Restored saws can be seen at some steam fairs.

By Charles Johnson Introduction and commentary by David Cordingly. Conway Maritime Press (2002). which was influential in shaping popular conceptions of pirates. Its author uses the name Captain Charles Johnson, generally considered a pseudonym for one of London's writer-publishers. The prime source for the biographies of many well-known pirates, the book gives an almost mythical status to the more colourful characters, and it is likely that the author used considerable licence in his accounts of pirate conversations.Cordingly, Under the Black Flag, p. xix. The book also contains the name of the pirate flag the Jolly Roger and shows the skull and bones design. First appearing in Charles Rivington's shop in London, the book sold so well that by 1726 an enlarged fourth edition had appeared. It pandered to the British public's taste for the exotic; revelling in graphic stories on the high seas. English naval historian David Cordingly writes: \\"It has been said, and there seems no reason to question this, that Captain Johnson created the modern conception of pirates.\\" Scottish novelists Robert Louis Stevenson (author of Treasure Island) and J. M. Barrie (author of Peter Pan featuring Captain Hook) both identified Johnson's General History of the Pyrates as one of their major influences, and Stevenson even borrowed one character's name (Israel Hands) from a list of Blackbeard's crew which appeared in Johnson's book.Jason Porterfield, Treasure Island and the Pirates of the 18th Century, Rosen, 2004, p. 12. Authorship Daniel Defoe 1706 The author has remained unknown in spite of numerous attempts by historians to discover his identity. There has been no record found of anyone with the name Charles Johnson serving as a captain in any capacity, save forty‚Äìtwo years before the publication of A General History. There was a playwright by that name in the early eighteenth century, but there are no ties to piracy found in his works. Some have suggested that the \\"Captain\\" was in fact a common pirate, but again, there is no record of this man.John Robert Moore Defoe in the Pillory, and Other Studies (New York: Octagon Books, 1973). In 1932, a literary scholar and writer named John Robert Moore posited that Daniel Defoe be acknowledged the author of A General History. After years of research in connection with a collection of Defoe's works, Moore published a study of his findings, detailing his argument for Defoe's authorship of this, and other, works. Moore declared that A General History was \\"substantially\\" a work of Defoe based on writing style and content similar to other pieces that have been attributed to Defoe. Moore argued that Defoe's interest in subjects such as \\"seafaring\\" and criminals shows that A General History falls squarely into his repertoire. Moore posited that not only could other works be used to confirm that Defoe wrote A General History, but that A General History could be used to endorse his authorship of those same works. Another point that Moore counted on to validate his claims was that many authors, to include historians, had used A General History of the Pyrates as a source of information for their own writings. Disputes between different Defoe biographers called his body of work into question. Based on the accounts of these many biographers, Defoe's attributed canon went from 101 different works to 570 between the years of 1790 and 1970. Most of these additions were made on the basis of internal, \\"stylistic\\" evidence. Moore's publication of his Checklist of the Writings of Daniel Defoe added almost 200 works alone. Many questioned not only his attribution of A General History to Defoe, but the general trend of biographers to continually add to the canon. One critic even suggested, based on this trend, that all anonymous works from the early eighteenth century be designated Defoe's. Philip Furbank and W. R. Owens' arguments against Defoe's authorship of A General History address the parallels that are drawn to other works of the time (often also attributed to Defoe) and the logical fallacies that are necessary to subscribe to such a large, diverse catalog. Many of the ideas and phrases that Moore points to as parallels, and therefore as proof of Defoe's continuity in his works, were commonplace in the eighteenth century. According to Furbank and Owens, Moore's attribution of A General History to Defoe was based on no external evidence and only those few circumstantial parallels.Philip Nicholas Furbank and W. R. Owens, The Canonisation of Daniel Defoe (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1988). Many other scholars have suggested that the author could have been either Daniel Defoe or publisher Nathaniel Mist (or somebody working for him). Colin Woodard states in his book The Republic of Pirates: Contents A General History introduced many features which later became common in pirate literature, such as pirates with missing legs or eyes, the notion of pirates burying treasure, and the name of the pirate flag the Jolly Roger. The author specifically cites two pirates as having named their flag Jolly Roger (named after the first Pirate and his crew): Welsh pirate Bartholomew Roberts in June 1721, and English pirate Francis Spriggs in December 1723.Charles Johnson (1724), A General History of the Robberies and Murders of the Most Notorious Pyrates, pp. 250, 411-12 The book gives an almost mythical status to the more colourful characters, such as the infamous English pirates Blackbeard and Calico Jack. It provides the standard account of the lives of many people still famous in the 21st century, and has influenced pirate literature of Scottish novelists Robert Louis Stevenson and J. M. Barrie.A general history of the robberies & murders of the most notorious pirates\\". Introduction. p. viii The book was released in two volumes. The first mostly deals with early 18th-century pirates, while Volume II records the exploits of their predecessors a few decades earlier. In the first volume, the author sticks fairly close to the available sources, though he embellishes the stories somewhat. He stretches the truth farther in the second volume and includes the biographies of three subjects who may be entirely fictional. The book has been hugely influential in shaping popular notions of piracy. The buccaneers profiled in Volume I are: * Anne Bonny * Bartholomew (\\"Black Bart\\") Roberts * Blackbeard * Calico Jack Rackham * Charles Vane * Edward England * Edward Lowe * Francis Spriggs * George Lowther * Henry Every * Howell Davis * Israel Hands * James Martel * John Evans * John Gow * Jolly Roger * Mary Read * Richard Worley * Philip Roche * Stede Bonnet * Thomas Anstis Volume II features: * Christopher Condent * John Bowen * John Halsey * Nathaniel North * Samuel Bellamy * Samuel Burgess * Thomas Howard * Thomas Tew * William Fly * William Kidd as well as biographies of the probably fictional captains James Misson, William Lewis (pirate), and John Cornelius.

Carus believed that the modern world required a new Religion of Science. By the 1890s, inspired by the meetings and conversations at the Parliament of the World's Religions in 1893, he had decided that Buddhism was the closest faith to his ideal and created The Gospel of Buddha to popularize the religion in the West. The work was assembled from existing English translations of Buddhists texts, with significant amendments and reworkings. His selection of texts favoured Buddhism as a philosophy without any supernatural elements. While criticized by contemporary scholars, this interpretation proved popular in the West.

It inhabits benthic environments at a depth of , and pelagic environments at a depth of . The smooth lanternshark forms a species group with the larger blurred lanternshark (E. bigelowi), both of which are distinguished from other members of their family by small, irregularly arranged dermal denticles with a truncated shape. This species has a slender, dark brown body with an indistinct black band on the sides over the pelvic fins, and reaches in length. This slow-growing, ovoviviparous shark feeds on smaller squid, fishes, and fish eggs. Smooth lanternsharks are often caught as bycatch in eastern Atlantic and Japanese commercial fisheries. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has evaluated this species as of Least Concern because of its wide distribution and limited threats. Taxonomy and phylogeny Early illustration of a smooth lanternshark, from A history of the fishes of Madeira (1843). The first scientific description of the smooth lanternshark, as Acanthidium pusillum, was published by British biologist Richard Thomas Lowe, in an 1839 issue of the scientific journal Transactions of the Zoological Society of London. This species was later moved to the genus Etmopterus. The specific epithet pusillus means \\"weak\\" in Latin. The smooth lanternshark forms a species group with the blurred lanternshark (E. bigelowi); these two species are distinguished from other lantern sharks by their irregularly arranged, truncated (ending in a flat crown as though the tip were cut off) dermal denticles. Distribution and habitat In the Atlantic Ocean, the smooth lanternshark occurs from the Gulf of Mexico to Argentina in the west, Portugal to South Africa (including Cape Verde and the Azores) in the east, and on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. In the Indian Ocean, it is found off KwaZulu-Natal and Madagascar. In the Pacific Ocean, it has been reported from the East China Sea to southern Japan, in the Hawaiian‚ÄìEmperor seamount chain area, off Australia and New Zealand, and over the Nazca Plate (including the Amber Seamount and off Isla Salas y G√≥mez). Smooth lanternsharks are usually found on or near the bottom on continental and insular shelves and slopes at depths of , and possibly to as deep as . Catch data off southern Portugal suggest this species has a preference for rocky substrates, and may conduct a diel vertical migration. In the South Atlantic, this shark also inhabits the open ocean from the surface to a depth of . It has been observed swimming over fields of hydrothermal vents. Description The smooth lanternshark has a bulbous snout and large oval eyes. Lightly built, the smooth lanternshark has a large head with a pointed snout, large oval eyes, and nostrils with short anterior skin flaps. There are 22-31 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 30-53 tooth rows in the lower jaw. Each upper tooth has a narrow smooth-edged central cusp flanked by 1-2 tiny cusplets; mature males over long grow additional pairs of lateral cusplets with age. The lower teeth are smooth, knife-like, and angled, with their bases interlocking to form a continuous cutting surface. The five pairs of gill slits are long. The first dorsal fin bears a stout spine in front and originates over the free rear tips of the rounded pectoral fins. The second dorsal fin is much larger than the first and has a longer spine. The pelvic fins are low and angular, and there is no anal fin. The caudal fin is short and broad, with a well-developed lower lobe and a ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe. The skin is covered by many widely spaced, small blocky denticles not arranged in regular rows, giving it a smooth appearance. The coloration is a uniform dark brown, with a faint black mark over the bases of the pelvic fins extending both forward and backward on the flank. The smooth lanternshark is very similar to but smaller than the blurry lanternshark, attaining a length of . The two species differ in a number of anatomical characteristics, but can be most reliably distinguished by the number of turns in their spiral valve intestines (10-13 in E. pusillus versus 16-19 in E. bigelowi). Biology and ecology Adult smooth lanternsharks have sexually dimorphic upper teeth. The smooth lanternshark feeds on squid, lanternfishes, smaller dogfish sharks, and fish eggs, as well as crustaceans and fish. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240698772_Feeding_ecology_of_the_deep- sea_lanternshark_Etmopterus_pusillus_Elasmobranchii_Etmopteridae_in_the_northeast_Atlantic This species is ovoviviparous, with the developing embryos being sustained by a yolk sac. Females produce an average of 10 young per reproductive cycle. Males reach sexual maturity at a length of , and females at a length of . The length at maturity varies with geographical region, with sharks in the western Atlantic maturing larger than those from off KwaZulu-Natal. This species grows at a slow rate, with the body becoming relatively longer with age. Off southern Portugal, males live to at least 13 years of age, and females to at least 17 years. Human interactions Large numbers of smooth lanternsharks, predominantly juvenile, are caught incidentally by commercial longline fisheries, and to a lesser extent in bottom trawls and fixed bottom nets, in the eastern Atlantic and off Japan. This species is one of the three most common sharks caught as bycatch in deepwater fisheries off southern Portugal, along with the velvet belly lanternshark (E. spinax) and the blackmouth catshark (Galeus melastomus). Most captured smooth lanternsharks are discarded, although some may be sold dried and salted for human consumption or processed into fishmeal. The smooth lanternshark's slow rates of reproduction and growth may render it vulnerable to population collapse under sustained fishing pressure. However, catch rates currently show no evidence of this occurring, which, coupled with the smooth lanternshark's wide geographic range, has led to the IUCN assessing it as of Least Concern. In June 2018 the New Zealand Department of Conservation classified the smooth lanternshark as \\"At Risk ‚Äì Naturally Uncommon\\" with the qualifiers \\"Data Poor\\" and \\"Secure Overseas\\" under the New Zealand Threat Classification System.

He has been called \\"the only genius ever to operate in the breeding world\\" and \\"the greatest single figure in the history of Italian racing\\". Born in Turin, orphaned at 6 years of age, Federico Tesio obtained a degree from the University of Florence. He served in the Italian Army during World War I and in 1939 was appointed to the Italian Senate. In 1898, he and his wife Lydia Tesio purchased a silk worm farm complete with thousands of Mulberry trees. These were removed and a guest residence, stallion stalls and stallion master's house were established on the Dormello Stud's 19 hectares of today in Dormelletto, Novara on the banks of Lake Maggiore in northern Italy. This has always been where mares with foals and Stallions of the day reside. By the 1930s the complex of stables attributable to Villa Tesio, the largest in Italy, included, within it, several farms in the municipal area that - over time - were established by Tesio: those of \\"Surga\\", the \\"Montaccio\\", the \\"Route\\", the \\"Moretta\\", the \\"Cucchetta\\", the \\"Torbera\\", the \\"Motta\\", each complete with a manager's house, stables and necessary stabling. One was for pregnant mares, one for barren mares, one for yearlings, one with a nearby huge dirt track within the treed forest in a flat over the top of the mount for horses in training and so on. These farms were all part of a stretch of land which took in most of the Dormelletto of today. The Tesio property stretched from the flats of the lake about 4km to the west and up the mounts of about 1500 metres and spread to the South for about 1.5km. The successor to Tesio's property, The Marchese Niccolo Incisa della Rochetta, has sold off much of the original estate, but, for example, still owns several of the farms established by Tesio and an occupied two storey house directly behind the Dormelletto railway station, only 150 metres from the lake, but 1.5km from the main villa. Tesio is given credit for the breeding successes of his farm, while his wife is identified as playing an important role in the social and business aspects of the operation, being responsible for bringing in Marchese Mario Incisa Della Rochetta as his partner in 1932. She kept the records of the stud until 1942. An owner/breeder who also always trained his own horses, Tesio's horses have influenced the breeding of the Thoroughbred internationally. He bred several champions including Nearco, Ribot, Braque and Cavaliere d‚ÄôArpino, whom he considered the best horse that he ever bredTalmadge Phelps, John and Frank , Dormello- Olgiata, 1961-1962, Derby Publishing Co., Milan, 1962 Cavaliere d'Arpino sired Bellini the sire of Tenerani which in turn was the sire of Ribot, who won the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe twice. Nearco sired Nearctic, sire of Northern Dancer. Donatello II won the Prix du Jockey Club but in his only defeat for Tesio, the jockey was instructed to take the lead, and lost. Donatello then immediately went to stud in the UK. Tesio bred, owned and trained 22 winners of the Derby Italiano. In 1947, Ulrico Hoepli of Milano published a book by Federico Tesio which he had titled Puro-Sangue - Animale da Esperimento. In 1958 a book was published titled \\"Breeding the Racehorse\\" accredited to Tesio and as having been edited and translated by Edward Spinola. In 2005 an English translation of the original Tesio Puro-Sangue - Animale da Esperimento translated by Maria Burnett was published by Russell Meerdink Co. Ltd () and was titled Tesio: In His Own Words. The Federico Tesio Stakes at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland is named in his honor. The Premio Lydia Tesio race at the Capannelle Racecourse in Rome is named for his wife and the Premio Federico Tesio for him at San Siro Racecourse in Milan and also the registered Group 3 Australian race Tesio Stakes in Melbourne. He died in 1954, shortly before the debut of Ribot, a horse who has been described as his \\"masterpiece\\". In 1999, nearly half a century after his death, he was named at number 18 in the Racing Post's list of 100 Makers of 20th Century Racing.

It is used for architectural features: trim, or ornament; facing buildings or other structures; statuary; and for garden ornaments. Cast stone can be made from white and/or grey cements, manufactured or natural sands, crushed stone or natural gravels, and colored with mineral coloring pigments. Cast stone may replace such common natural building stones as limestone, brownstone, sandstone, bluestone, granite, slate, coral, and travertine. History Cast stone has been a prime building material for thousands of years. The earliest known use of cast stone dates from about 1138 in the Cit√© de Carcassonne, France. Cast stone was first used extensively in London in the 19th century and gained widespread acceptance in America in 1920. Some researchers have even speculated that the Egyptian pyramids were formed using a form of cast stone, rather than from cut blocks. One of the earliest developments in the industry was Coade stone, a fired ceramic form of stoneware. Today most artificial stone consists of fine Portland cement-based concrete placed to set in wooden, rubber-lined fiberglass or iron moulds. It is cheaper and more uniform than natural stone, and widely used. In engineering projects, it allows transporting the bulk materials and casting near the place of use, which is cheaper than transporting and carving very large pieces of stone. According to Rupert GunnisDictionary of British Sculptors 1660-1851, p22 a Dutchman named Van Spangen set up an artificial stone manufactury at Bow in London in 1800. Having later gone into partnership with a Mr. Powell the firm was broken up in 1828, and the moulds sold to a sculptor, Felix Austin, who had a premises in New Road (now Euston Road), in the city. Although he is known to have copied old ceramic Coade stone designs of Mrs. Coade, his product made from Portland cement, broken natural stone, pounded marble and coarse sand' (The Builder, 1868, now Building). Around 1840 Austin entered into partnership with John Seeley, who had trained at the Royal Academy Schools and also made an artificial stone, which he called 'artificial limestone', before joining with Austin. In 1841 the pair published their first catalogue, 'Collection of Ornaments at Austin & Seeley's Artificial Stone Works for Gardens, Parks and Pleasure Grounds'. The firm continued in production until about 1872. Another well-known variety was Victoria stone, which is composed of three parts finely crushed Mount Sorrel (Leicestershire) granite to one of Portland cement, carefully mechanically mixed and filled into moulds. After setting the blocks are placed in a solution of silicate of soda to indurate and harden them. Many manufacturers turned out a very non- porous product able to resist corrosive sea air and industrial and residential air pollution. Physical properties Today, cast stone is a Portland cement- based architectural precast concrete product manufactured using high quality fine and coarse aggregate as its primary constituents. The use of a high percentage of fine aggregate creates a very smooth, consistent texture for the building elements being cast, resembling natural cut stone. Other ingredients such as chemical admixtures, pozzolans, and pigments also may be added. Cast stone frequently is produced with a low water-to-cement ratio mixture with a \\"dry\\" (or \\"earth moist\\") consistency. The mixture is consolidated into a mould using an air-driven, or electric, tamping device or vibration under pressure, which is much like the formation of natural sedimentary rock. Products manufactured in this manner are referred to as vibrant-dry-tamped (VDT) cast stone. For cast stone mixtures produced with a slumpable consistency mixture, the concrete typically is consolidated using internal or external vibration applied to the production mould, or increasingly by the use of self-compacting additives. Over the last decade, new types of admixtures have been developed for VDT concrete products. These new admixtures do not normally work with \\"wet cast\\" concrete. These new plasticizers are more efficient than using air- entraining agents to increase compaction in VDT concrete. Some plasticizers have chemical properties that react with the cement to increase ultimate strengths of semi-dry concrete. Another important type of admixture for VDT concrete is integral waterproofing formulas. Tests have shown that some of these integral waterproofing admixtures have improved strength by as much as 20% while reducing the absorption by 40%. The increased strength and reduced absorption results in improved freeze/thaw durability. On recent commercial testing laboratory results, the freeze-thaw for VDT concrete using integral waterproofing admixtures was 0.23% weight loss after 300 cycles. Air entraining agents have been the salvation of wet cast concrete as it pertains to its durability. Wet cast concrete with 4% to 6% entrained air normally can withstand numerous freeze-thaw cycles without failing. Other types of admixtures such as water-reducers, super plasticizers and the new self- compacting additives can add to improving the strength and durability of wet cast concrete products. Cast stone products manufactured by the wet cast method are required to meet the same standards as VDT cast products. Standards In the US and some other countries, the industry standard today for physical properties and raw materials constituents is ASTM C 1364, the Standard Specification for Architectural Cast Stone. Membership in ASTM International (founded in 1898 as the American Chapter of the International Association for Testing and Materials and most recently known as the American Society for Testing and Materials) exceeds 30,000 technical experts from more than 100 countries who comprise a worldwide standards forum. The ASTM method of developing standards has been based on consensus of both users and producers of all kinds of materials. The ASTM process ensures that interested individuals and organizations representing industry, academia, consumers, and governments alike, all have an equal vote in determining a standard's content. In the UK and Europe, it is more normal to use the Standard \\"BS 1217 Cast stone - Specification\\" from the BSI Group. The European Commission's \\"Construction Products Regulations\\" legislation states that by mid-2013 CE marking becomes mandatory for certain construction products sold in Europe, including some Cast Stone items\\".

This process allows a Time Lord to undergo a transformation into a new physical form and a somewhat different personality after instances which would normally result in death. Regeneration has been used twelve times throughout the history of the show as a device for introducing a new actor for the lead role of its main character, the Doctor. Other Time Lords and similar characters have also regenerated, usually for narrative reasons, rather than casting. The current incarnation of the Doctor is played by Jodie Whittaker, following the regeneration of the Twelfth Doctor (portrayed by Peter Capaldi) during the 2017 Christmas special \\"Twice Upon a Time\\". Conceptual history Inspiration The concept of regeneration was created in 1966 by the writers of Doctor Who as a method of replacing the leading actor. The role of the Doctor had been played by William Hartnell since the programme began in 1963 but, by 1966, it was increasingly apparent that Hartnell's health was deteriorating and he was becoming more difficult to work with. Producer John Wiles had, following several clashes with Hartnell, intended to have the actor replaced in The Celestial Toymaker; during two episodes of that serial, the Doctor is invisible (owing to Hartnell being on holiday during the recording). Wiles' plan was for the character to reappear played by a new actor. This proposal was vetoed by Gerald Savory, the BBC's Head of Serials (and Wiles' superior), which led to Wiles leaving before The Celestial Toymaker was produced. However, it was apparent that it would not be possible for Hartnell to continue for much longer. On 29 July 1966, production concluded on the final episode of The Smugglers, the last serial recorded in the third production block. During production, Hartnell and producer Innes Lloyd had reached an agreement that he should leave the role, having starred in one more serial that would see a handover to a new actor, which would be the first one produced as part of Season 4. Script editor Gerry Davis proposed that, since the Doctor had already been established as an alien, the character could die and return in a new body. Lloyd took this further by suggesting that the Doctor could do this \\"renewal\\" regularly, transforming from an older man to a younger one; this would allow for the convenient recasting of the role when necessary. The process itself was modelled on LSD trips, with the experience being like the \\"hell and dank horror\\" of taking the drug. At the conclusion of The Tenth Planet, the First Doctor collapses from old age, having commented earlier that his body was \\"wearing a bit thin\\". Then, before the eyes of his companions Ben and Polly, his features shift into that of the Second Doctor, played by Patrick Troughton. In The Power of the Daleks, the Second Doctor's first story, the Doctor draws an analogy between the renewal and a caterpillar turning into a butterfly. Developing the concept It was not clear initially whether the renewal was a natural ability of the Doctor's as opposed to a process initiated by technology. In Power of the Daleks, the Second Doctor describes his renewal as a function of his TARDIS time machine, stating that \\"without it, [he] couldn't survive.\\" When Troughton left the series in 1969, the Doctor was renewed again, but this time the change was forced on him by the Time Lords at the conclusion of The War Games, where it is referred to as a \\"change of appearance\\". As with the first change, this language suggested only a superficial physical change, not one of personality, although Jon Pertwee's portrayal of the Third Doctor also differed quite substantially from Troughton's. Unlike the previous change, this one is treated as a punishment rather than a natural process: in The War Games the Doctor protests, \\"You can't just change what I look like without consulting me!\\" As the series continued, more aspects of the regenerative process were introduced, but the basic concepts of regeneration as accepted by fans of the series today were only firmly established in the final scene of Planet of the Spiders (1974), when Pertwee's Third Doctor turns into Tom Baker's Fourth Doctor. In this scene, the change is called \\"regeneration\\" for the first time, and is explained as a biological process that occurs when a Time Lord's body is dying. It is also stated that following the regeneration the Doctor's brain cells would be shaken up and his behaviour would be \\"erratic\\" for a time, something that would be evident for most subsequent regenerations. In the About Time reference series Lawrence Miles and Tat Wood note that the officially licensed magazine, Doctor Who Monthly, stated in a \\"Matrix Data- Bank\\" column in 1982 that its readers should not confuse the \\"regenerations\\" of later incarnations with the \\"rejuvenation\\" of Hartnell into Troughton. However, dialogue within the series itself explicitly includes the First-to- Second \\"rejuvenation\\" when enumerating the Doctor's regenerations (for example in Mawdryn Undead (1983)). In \\"The Timeless Children\\", it is explained that the Time Lords got their regeneration ability from an unknown person called The Timeless Child, a child found by an explorer called Tecteun. The child has seemingly infinite regenerations. Tecteun splices the regeneration ability from The Timeless Child across all Time Lords. It is revealed The Timeless Child is The Doctor, and that her thirteen lives (by the point of this episode) are not her only ones and she has lived an unknown number of previous lives. Transitions The Fourth Doctor regenerates into the Fifth Doctor (from Logopolis, 1981, and Castrovalva, 1982) The regeneration \\"effect\\" was accomplished during the series' original run from 1963‚Äì1989 primarily through the use of video mixing. Originally, the plan was to have Hartnell collapse at the end of The Tenth Planet with his cloak over his face, which would then be pulled back to reveal Troughton in the next serial. However, vision mixer Shirley Coward discovered and took advantage of a malfunction in the mixing desk which allowed Hartnell's image to be overexposed to the point of almost whiting out the screen, then fading back in to reveal Troughton's face. This also meant that the regeneration scene could take place with both actors at the conclusion of The Tenth Planet, and Troughton was accordingly signed up to participate. Subsequent regenerations retained essentially the same method, with or without additional video or make-up effects. The transition from the Fourth to the Fifth Doctor used an additional make-up effect representing a transitional form known as the Watcher, but aside from this, other regenerations in the original series run simply mixed the image of the incoming actor on top of the outgoing one. The transition from the Seventh to the Eighth Doctor in the 1996 television movie took advantage of the higher budget and modern computer animation technology to \\"morph\\" the features of Sylvester McCoy into those of Paul McGann. With the exception of the transitions from the Second to Third, each regeneration was shown on-screen, with the previous incumbent in the role symbolically \\"handing off\\" the character to the next. The Second Doctor was never seen to actually change into the Third, simply fading off into darkness at the end of The War Games and then stumbling out of the TARDIS, already regenerated, at the start of Spearhead from Space (1970). The regeneration of the Sixth Doctor into the Seventh is the only time that a single actor took on the roles of two incarnations of the Doctor. Colin Baker declined the invitation to film the regeneration sequence at the start of Time and the Rani (1987) due to the circumstances in which the BBC dismissed him from the role. As a result, Sylvester McCoy had to don his predecessor's costume and a blond curly wig, lying face down, with the mixing effect to the Doctor's \\"new\\" features occurring as he was turned over. The 2005 series, which revived the programme after its cancellation 16 years earlier, began with the Ninth Doctor already regenerated and no explanation given as to the circumstances behind the change (although a scene in the debut episode \\"Rose\\" when the Doctor commented on his appearance in a mirror indicated that the change had recently occurred). In the documentary series Doctor Who Confidential, producer Russell T Davies explained his reasoning that, after such a long hiatus, a regeneration in the first episode would be not only confusing for new viewers but also lacking in dramatic impact, as there would have been no emotional investment in the character being replaced. The regeneration into the Ninth Doctor was later seen and explained in \\"The Day of the Doctor\\" (2013). In this episode, the War Doctor automatically begins a regeneration due to old age at the end of the Last Great Time War. However, the full transition is not seen with only the start of the regeneration being shown. The regeneration of the Ninth Doctor into the Tenth at the end of \\"The Parting of the Ways\\" (2005) used computer effects to morph Christopher Eccleston into David Tennant. In the episode of Doctor Who Confidential accompanying the episode \\"Utopia\\" (2007), where the same effect is used for the Master's regeneration, it is stated that the production team decided that this would be a common effect for all future Time Lord regenerations, rather than each regeneration being designed uniquely at the whim of the individual director. This style of transition is seen again in \\"The Stolen Earth\\"/\\"Journey's End\\" (2008) both when the Doctor undergoes an aborted regeneration, and when his hand spawns a clone in the second part; in \\"The End of Time\\" (2010) during which Matt Smith took over the role as the Eleventh Doctor; in \\"The Impossible Astronaut\\" when the Doctor is shot twice and seemingly killed; in \\"Day of the Moon\\" when a young girl regenerates; and in \\"Let's Kill Hitler\\" when Mels (Nina Toussaint-White) is shot and regenerates into River Song (Alex Kingston). \\"The Night of the Doctor\\" and \\"The Day of the Doctor\\" subsequently use the effect to show the Eighth Doctor and War Doctor's regenerations respectively. The Eighth Doctor's regeneration into the War Doctor uses steady beams of light as opposed to the flame effect used for other revived series regenerations. In the Series 10 episode \\"The Lie of the Land\\", the Twelfth Doctor fakes a regeneration as part of a plan to test if Bill still has free will. The effect used is consistent with the one used in the modern series, with the Doctor's hands glowing and emitting regeneration energy before he enters full regeneration. However, as the regeneration was not real, it did not use up a regeneration and the Doctor did not change bodies. The regeneration from the Eleventh to the Twelfth Doctor slightly differs from other regenerations from the revived series. During \\"The Time of the Doctor\\", the Eleventh Doctor reveals that he has used all his regenerations and is in fact in his thirteenth and final body, leading to his aged appearance during the events of the episode. At the conclusion, the Time Lords grant him a new regeneration cycle, and he begins his thirteenth regeneration in the explosive manner that has become tradition (so explosive that it destroys invading Dalek forces including a ship and the village of Christmas in the process). However, as this regeneration is the first in a new cycle, it initially only \\"resets\\" his current body back to its youthful appearance (the Doctor referring to this as the cycle \\"breaking in\\"), and the eventual transition to the Twelfth Doctor happens with a flash and the actor suddenly lurching back, standing back up to reveal the new Doctor. In the 2017 Christmas special \\"Twice Upon a Time\\", the Twelfth Doctor completes his regeneration into the Thirteenth Doctor (played by incumbent actress Jodie Whittaker). The effect used was more akin to the Tenth Doctor's regeneration to the Eleventh, with an explosive energy discharge being released from the Doctor, and steady streams of regeneration energy being emitted from his hands and head before his features were morphed into Whittaker's. Characteristics within the series Relationship with the TARDIS It is mentioned that the TARDIS assists the Doctor during the regenerative process, as suggested by the Second Doctor's statement to this effect shortly after regenerating from the First. This is reiterated by Jack Harkness' insistence that the Doctor be taken into the TARDIS having been shot by a Dalek in \\"The Stolen Earth\\". Of the five occasions on which the Doctor has regenerated outside the TARDIS: one is forced on him by the Time Lords (Second to Third Doctor, The War Games); one requires a Time Lord to give the Doctor's cells a \\"little push\\" to start the process (Third to Fourth, Planet of the Spiders); one results in his being dependent on the TARDIS's \\"Zero Room\\", a chamber sealed from all outside forces, to help him recover (Fourth to Fifth, Castrovalva); one occurs a few hours after he has actually \\"died\\" (Seventh to Eighth, the 1996 television film; the delay at is, however, shown to have been caused by anaesthetic, rather than the Doctor's distance from the TARDIS); one is induced by the Sisterhood of Karn after reviving the Doctor from actual death (Eighth Doctor, \\"The Night of the Doctor\\"). The Seventh to Eighth regeneration remains the only one that takes place significantly far away from the TARDIS, without any obvious interaction from other Time Lords and results in the Doctor suffering near-complete amnesia for nearly a day until an event inside the TARDIS triggers his memories to return. The future Eleventh Doctor is killed in mid- regeneration, showing he is vulnerable to death while regenerating and as such his need for the TARDIS may be for safety rather than aid. However it is later revealed that this regeneration was indeed a simulation since the Doctor who was shot was actually a Teselecta robot. The Eleventh Doctor starts his regeneration outside the TARDIS though he does end it inside it. In the case of the Twelfth Doctor, he briefly begins his regeneration after being shot by a laser from a Mondasian Cyberman away from the TARDIS, but holds it off. When his actual regeneration starts, he emerges from the TARDIS as he struggles to hold it back. When the Twelfth Doctor finally does regenerate, it is within the TARDIS. As the Doctor contemplates his regeneration, the TARDIS appears to make its opinion on the matter known by flashing its lights at the Doctor, eliciting a response from him. in (the timeless child and revealed that as a child the doctor ends up having an accident which results in the first regeneration of history his adoptive mother becomes obsessed and obtaining this power and after many years he manages to extract the powerful regeneration and sharing it with the other lords of the time.The John Peel- authored book The Gallifrey Chronicles attributes regeneration to a \\"nanomolecular virus\\" that rebuilds the body. The audio play Zagreus attributes regeneration to \\"self-replicating biogenic molecules\\" designed by Rassilon, which do much the same thing, with a built-in limit of twelve regenerations to prevent the molecules' decay. According to the Virgin Missing Adventures book The Crystal Bucephalus by Craig Hinton, Time Lords have triple-helix DNA: the third strand was added by Rassilon to make regeneration possible. The novelisation of The Twin Dilemma by Eric Saward states that the regenerative process is triggered by a massive release of the hormone lindos, which is transported at great speed around the Time Lord's body, causing its cells to reform and realign. These varying explanations may or may not be compatible with each other, and like all spin-off media, their canonicity with respect to the television series is unclear. In \\"The Christmas Invasion\\" (2005) it is stated that the regenerative cycle generates a large amount of energy that suffuses the Time Lord's body, and also shown that residual effects from a regeneration allow him to grow back a hand within the first 15 hours after the initial start of the regeneration. Accordingly, in \\"Let's Kill Hitler\\", River Song is able to repel bullets after regenerating. She is later able to send off an energy wave soon after her regeneration, though this particular feat may be one of the abilities gained during this time. In the series four finale of the revived series, \\"Journey's End\\", an injured Tenth Doctor manages to avert a full regeneration by channelling \\"excess regenerative energy\\" into his severed hand, allowing him to heal without changing form. The limb ends up developing into a half-human clone when Donna Noble touches it; the event, a \\"two-way\\" \\"Human-Time Lord Meta-Crisis\\", also gives Donna a Time Lord's mind. Increased strength is sometimes a temporary by-product of regeneration. Shortly after his third regeneration, the Fourth Doctor karate-chopped a brick in half in episode one of Robot, but was unable to repeat the action later in the same serial. In the moments following his regeneration into his eighth incarnation, the Doctor possessed enough physical strength to batter a steel door completely off its hinges. In \\"Twice Upon a Time\\", the First Doctor's dying of old age had earlier rendered him \\"weak as a kitten\\", but his oncoming regeneration temporarily provides him with renewed strength and vitality (as explained to him by the Twelfth Doctor). In \\"The End of Time\\" when the Tenth Doctor regenerates into the Eleventh Doctor, the release of energy damages the TARDIS to the extent that components fall, the door's windows smash and the TARDIS then flies uncontrollably over Earth before crash-landing in Amy Pond's garden. Later, when the Eleventh Doctor begins his regeneration into the Twelfth Doctor in \\"The Time of the Doctor\\", he is able to control his regeneration energy and sends out energy blasts that obliterate nearby Daleks and an entire Dalek saucer. The release of energy also causes a shockwave that severely damages the town where the regeneration took place. The Twelfth Doctor's regeneration into the Thirteenth is also quite explosive; while the streams of regeneration energy being emitted from the Doctor cause some minor damage to the console room, the full extent is revealed when it begins to explode immediately after the Doctor attempts to operate it, and she ends up falling from the TARDIS. Personality change With regeneration also comes a change of personality. The viewing audience sees this most often and most dramatically in the differing quirks and personality traits of the Doctor's various incarnations. The Doctor's core personality traits of heroism and intolerance of injustice are still retained, but in \\"The End of Time\\" the Tenth Doctor laments that demise of his current incarnation, with its own personality and attributes, makes for something much akin to an actual death. His last words before regenerating are \\"I don't want to go.\\" Shortly after the regeneration process, the Doctor sometimes goes through a period of physical and psychological instability. The Fourth Doctor described it as \\"a new body is like a new house - takes a little bit of time to settle in\\". The Second Doctor experiences crippling pain after his first regeneration (in The Power of the Daleks), while the Third Doctor collapses outside the TARDIS following his regeneration (in Spearhead from Space). The Fourth Doctor started rambling random phrases and possessed a higher than usual strength; he could cut a brick in half merely with his hand (in Robot). The Fifth Doctor (in Castrovalva) begins reverting to his previous personalities, and the Sixth Doctor experiences extreme paranoia, flying into a murderous rage and nearly killing his companion (The Twin Dilemma, 1984). The Eighth Doctor experienced amnesia as a result of post-regeneration trauma (the 1996 television film); uniquely, the Doctor was \\"not alive\\" at the time of this regeneration. The regeneration from the Ninth to the Tenth Doctor sees the Doctor experiencing sudden spasms and great pain (\\"Children in Need special\\"), and later being unconscious for most of the next fifteen hours (\\"The Christmas Invasion\\"). The regeneration from the Tenth to the Eleventh Doctor caused the Doctor to experience strange food cravings, only to be disgusted by them upon actually trying them (\\"The Eleventh Hour\\"). The Twelfth Doctor forgot how to fly the TARDIS (as well as the name of the TARDIS) right after the regeneration process in \\"The Time of the Doctor\\". The Brain of Morbius implies that Time Lords other than the Doctor may experience difficult regenerations, since the Sisterhood of Karn had been supplying them with an \\"elixir of life\\" that could assist the process. In \\"The Night of the Doctor\\", the Sisterhood tell the Eighth Doctor they can provide elixirs to give rise to non-random regenerations, allowing the Doctor to specify either a physical type or personality. The Master showed a dramatic personality change upon regenerating into the Mistress/Missy. In that form, she wants nothing more than to renew her bond with the Doctor, even calling him her \\"boyfriend\\" at one point. (\\"Deep Breath, Death in Heaven\\") When she met him again, Missy pretended to be an android and kissed him passionately. (\\"Dark Water\\") Despite still being manic and a psychopath, she later showed a willingness to reform, spending centuries in the Doctor's custody as a show of her commitment. Later, she felt torn between the Doctor, who represented her repentance, and her past incarnation, who represented a return to her old ways; she ultimately chose the Doctor, for which her past incarnation killed her in disgust. In turn, though Missy expressed a love for who she was in her past incarnation, she forced his own regeneration into her to ensure she would become the person she now was (\\"The Doctor Falls\\"). Extent of physical change The Doctor has always regenerated into a humanoid form. However, when explaining the process of regeneration to Rose at the end of \\"The Parting of the Ways\\", the Ninth Doctor suggests that his new form could have \\"two heads\\", or even \\"no head\\", and in the 2005 Children in Need special, which takes place immediately after that episode, the newly regenerated Tenth Doctor, while examining his new body, makes a point of checking that he has two arms, two legs and two hands, implying that regenerations can sometimes result in physically deformed or non-humanoid forms; similarly, the Eleventh Doctor, upon regenerating, shows relief to still have legs and proceeds to check whether he still has fingers and human facial features. It is not clear whether or not these moments are intended as jokes. The beginning of Destiny of the Daleks (1979) featured Romana trying out a number of potential forms, two of which included a blue- skinned pygmy and a giantess. Whether Time Lords could change gender in regeneration was never addressed onscreen during the classic series and not explicitly focused on for much of the revival. In The Hand of Fear (1976), the Kastrian Eldrad compared his transformation from female to male to Time Lord regeneration, possibly suggesting the process could produce a sex change. The concept of Time Lords changing gender upon regeneration was seeded throughout Moffat's tenure as showrunner. In the second part of \\"The End of Time\\" (2010), the Eleventh Doctor (Matt Smith) briefly checks for an Adam's apple upon regeneration to confirm if he is still a man. In the 2011 episode \\"The Doctor's Wife\\", the Doctor recalls a Time Lord acquaintance known as the Corsair, who had at least two female incarnations. In the 2013 short \\"Night of the Doctor\\", the Sisterhood of Karn offer a dying Eighth Doctor (Paul McGann) control over his inevitable regeneration, with \\"man or woman\\" being touted as possibilities. The first on-screen cross-gender regeneration was shown in the 2015 episode \\"Hell Bent\\", in which a white male Gallifreyan general (Ken Bones) regenerates into a black woman (T'Nia Miller), who states that her previous incarnation was the only time she had been a man. The most notable Time Lord to have appeared in both male and female forms prior to Whittaker's casting is the Doctor's nemesis, The Master, portrayed from 2014 to 2017 by Scottish actress Michelle Gomez. This character was known as Missy, short for \\"Mistress\\". In \\"World Enough and Time\\" (2017), the Doctor tells his companion Bill Potts, in reference to Missy, that Time Lords are mostly beyond gender norms and stereotypes; however, Bill points out that the males and females of the species collectively refer to themselves by a male title. From \\"Twice Upon a Time\\" onward, Jodie Whittaker portrays the Thirteenth Doctor, the Doctor's first female incarnation. Female Doctors were previously explored in spin-off productions; Joanna Lumley appeared as a satirical version of the Thirteenth Doctor in the 1999 Comic Relief special The Curse of Fatal Death. Arabella Weir also played an alternate Third Doctor in the Doctor Who Unbound Big Finish episode Exile. Neither portrayal is typically considered to be within the show's main continuity. Spin-off media have also depicted more drastic regenerations than the TV series. For example, in the Big Finish Productions audio Circular Time, a Time Lord known as Cardinal Zero regenerates into an avian life-form after being poisoned.\\"Circular Time\\", Doctor Who Reference Guide. Retrieved on 11 July 2015. Control over regeneration The Doctor's regenerations are always involuntary, and he has no control over his final appearance. In \\"The Parting of the Ways\\" (2005), the Ninth Doctor describes the process as \\"a bit dodgy\\"‚Äîi.e., somewhat dangerous or uncertain‚Äîand the Tenth Doctor refers to regeneration as \\"a lottery\\" (\\"The Day of the Doctor\\", 2013). For example, despite an apparent wish for this to occur, neither the Ninth nor the Tenth Doctors regenerated into redheads. The sole known exception to this is the Eighth Doctor's regeneration into the War Doctor (\\"The Night of the Doctor\\", 2013), as the Doctor was able to consume a potion made by the Sisterhood of Karn which ensured his next body was a warrior able to fight in the last Great Time War, though he didn't appear to make any specifications about the actual physical appearance. The Doctor was also once given the chance to choose his appearance upon his forced regeneration by the Time Lords in The War Games (1969) but rejected all of the options presented to him. The Time Lords grew tired of his stalling and thus sent him away to regenerate into the Third Doctor, an apparently random result. Alternatively, the Tenth Doctor was shown twice to exert control over regenerating, attributed by the Eleventh Doctor to \\"having vanity issues at the time.\\" In \\"Journey's End\\" (2008), after being shot by a Dalek triggered a regeneration, the Tenth Doctor used the regeneration energy to heal his wounds, then channelled the remaining energy into his severed hand and purposely kept his current appearance. When he finally did regenerate into the Eleventh Doctor, he still consciously prevented himself from regenerating to prolong his time as his current incarnation for several hours. Doing this caused a more explosive regeneration that nearly destroyed the TARDIS. In contrast, the first episode of Destiny of the Daleks (1979) depicts Romana undergoing a voluntary regeneration, in which she tries out several different forms before choosing to adopt the appearance of Princess Astra, a person she encountered in a previous adventure (The Armageddon Factor). Many writers of spin-off media have attempted to rationalise the difference between the Doctor's and Romana's regenerations. Doctor Who television writer and script editor Eric Saward suggests in his 1985 novelisation of The Twin Dilemma (1984) that Time Lords can control the appearance of their next body if they trigger the regeneration voluntarily, but not if the regeneration is caused by death or injury. The Doctor Who Role Playing Game by FASA suggests that some Time Lords have a special ability to control their regenerations. The fan reference book The Discontinuity Guide suggests that Romana's various \\"try-ons\\" were projections of potential future incarnations like the K'anpo Rinpoche/Cho Je situation in Planet of the Spiders. Miles and Wood's About Time also mentions this while theorising that the Time Lords had improved the technology of regeneration since the Doctor's time; Romana, being of a later generation than the Doctor, would therefore have finer control over the regenerative process in its early stages. Other moments in the series suggest that other Time Lords have more control over their regeneration than that usually displayed by the Doctor. Prior to regenerating in the episode \\"Utopia\\" (2007), the Master expresses a desire to be \\"young and strong\\" like the Doctor and transforms accordingly. Subsequently, in \\"Last of the Time Lords\\", the Master is shot by Lucy Saxon and is able to prevent regeneration at will, despite the Doctor's pleas. In \\"The Stolen Earth\\" (2008), the Doctor begins to regenerate in a cliffhanger moment, but at the start of \\"Journey's End\\" (the following episode), he interrupts the process after healing his bodily injuries, redirecting the remaining regeneration energy into his preserved hand. In \\"Let's Kill Hitler\\", when Mels begins to regenerate into River Song, she says she is trying to concentrate so she can come out a particular dress size. In \\"Nightmare in Silver\\" (2013), the Eleventh Doctor suggests that he can trigger regeneration voluntarily, using the suggestion to threaten the Cyber-Planner invading his body and mind, saying \\"I could regenerate now. Big blast of regeneration energy, burn out any little Cyber widgets in my brain, along with everything you're connected to. Don't want to. Use this me up, who knows what we'll get next? But I can.\\" (Even though by The Time of the Doctor this was revealed to be a bluff due to the fact that the Eleventh Doctor was actually the final incarnation of his first regeneration cycle.) In \\"The Girl Who Died\\" (2015), the Twelfth Doctor speculates that he deliberately, if not subconsciously, chose the form of Caecilius (from \\"The Fires of Pompeii\\") to remind himself that he is a man who always saves people, even if it is just one. In \\"The Doctor Falls\\" (2017), the Doctor is wounded by Cybermen and starts to regenerate, but is able to hold back his regeneration, refusing to change again. In \\"Twice Upon a Time\\" (2017), the Twelfth Doctor reveals that there is a period of time, what he calls \\"a state of grace,\\" when a regenerating Time Lord's current incarnation is restored to full health for a time if the incarnation resists regeneration. During this time, the incarnation must choose whether or not to regenerate. Once the period is over, if the Time Lord chooses not to regenerate, they will permanently die. Furthermore, as time passes during this \\"state of grace,\\" the Time Lord grows weaker as the period nears its end. The First, Tenth and Twelfth Doctors all used this period of time, though in the case of the Tenth Doctor it was to visit all of his former companions a final time before regenerating rather than out of some form of uncertainty. While in his \\"state of grace,\\" the First Doctor's face got \\"mixed up\\" due to his resisting regeneration, an effect not seen with his subsequent incarnations who used the period. Recognition of the regenerated The television series is inconsistent on the question of whether Time Lords can recognise each other across regenerations. For example, in The Deadly Assassin an old classmate of the Doctor's, Runcible, is slow to recognise the Doctor in his fourth incarnation, and once he has, it then takes him a while to realise that his appearance has changed. However, in The Armageddon Factor (1978), Drax, another old classmate, recognises the Fourth Doctor immediately although they had not seen each other since the Academy (though the Doctor takes a while to remember Drax). There is also inconsistency as to whether the Doctor can recognise his own future incarnations. In the original series, the Doctors usually have no difficulty recognising one another (in The Three Doctors, the First, Second, and Third Doctors all know one another on sight. However, in The Five Doctors, the First Doctor does not recognise the Fifth Doctor as himself and needs to be introduced by the Fifth as his fourth regeneration. In Time Crash, after the TARDIS is at different points in its own timeline merge due to downed shields, the Fifth Doctor spends much of the mini-episode believing that the Tenth was merely a fan who had somehow gotten into his TARDIS, having somehow altered the 'desktop theme'; the Tenth Doctor constantly tries to convince his younger self that he is his future self, only doing so by using a predestination paradox to cancel out a universe-destroying black hole with a supernova by blowing up the TARDIS. When the Tenth and the Eleventh Doctor meet each other in The Day of the Doctor, the Tenth Doctor appears to sceptically recognise his successor, yet he appears to be fully convinced only after both compare their respective sonic screwdrivers. The War Doctor on the other hand is initially completely oblivious to meet two of his future regenerations (initially mistaking them for future companions), again being convinced by their sonic screwdrivers. When the First Doctor meets the Twelfth Doctor, the First Doctor sees his future self as another Time Lord come to take back his TARDIS and requires convincing as to otherwise. The Daleks' ability to recognise the Doctor also varies: they recognise him outright in The Power of the Daleks but need confirmation from other sources in Revelation of the Daleks, \\"Doomsday\\" and \\"The Pilot\\". In \\"Asylum of the Daleks\\", the Daleks' knowledge of the Doctor is tied to a psychic link among them called the path- web, which is hacked to make them forget him. The Cybermen have their own method of recognising the Doctor, usually through his past incarnations, as seen in Earthshock and \\"The Next Doctor\\". In \\"Utopia\\", while the Master was under the chameleon arch, the Doctor could not sense that he was a Time Lord. After the Master's personality reasserted itself, the Doctor instantly sensed him and could tell which Time Lord it was without being told. In \\"The Sound of Drums\\", the Doctor stated that he would be able to recognize the regenerated Master on sight despite having never seen his new incarnation, claiming that Time Lords could always recognize each other. Due to the Master's Archangel Network, the Doctor's ability to sense another Time Lord had been blocked up to that point. During \\"The End of Time\\", the Master and the Doctor could sense each other's presence when in proximity, with both appearing to sniff each other out. However, this ability has a limited range as stated by the Doctor to Wilfred Mott. While he could sense that the Master was still on Earth, he could not tell where he was as the Master was too far away to track precisely. In \\"Dark Water\\", The Doctor failed to recognize that Missy was a regeneration of The Master, and may not have been able to tell that she was a Time Lord at all until she revealed her identity to him. In \\"World Enough and Time\\", the disguised Master figured out that Missy was his own future self, but this was due to deduction from her mannerisms rather than any sort of special ability. In turn, Missy did not realize that the disguised Master was another Time Lord, let alone her own past self until he revealed himself. In \\"Spyfall, Part 1\\", the Thirteenth Doctor doesn't recognize the Master. Maximum number of regenerations in a cycle In The Deadly Assassin (1976), it is established that a Time Lord can only regenerate 12 times, for a total of 13 incarnations. This statement is later repeated in Mawdryn Undead (1983), the 1996 TV film and \\"The Time of the Doctor\\" (2013). This aspect became embedded in the public consciousness despite not often being repeated, and was recognised by producers of the show as a plot obstacle for when the show finally had to regenerate the Doctor a thirteenth time. In the BBC Series 4 FAQ, writer Russell T Davies made a joke that suggested that since the Time Lords were believed to be dead and their rules destroyed, the Doctor may be able to regenerate indefinitely: \\"Now that his people are gone, who knows? Time Lords used to have thirteen lives.\\" In Death of the Doctor (a 2010 The Sarah Jane Adventures serial), the Eleventh Doctor says he can regenerate 507 times (early news reports, before the episode was broadcast, suggested he would say there is no limit to the number of regenerations). However, writer Russell T Davies explained in an interview with SFX that this line was not intended to be taken seriously and insisted that the \\"thirteen lives\\" rule was too deeply entrenched in the viewer consciousness for his throwaway line to affect it. However, the series has depicted exceptions to this rule in the career of the renegade Time Lord the Master. When the Master finds himself at the end of his regenerative cycle in The Keeper of Traken (1981), he takes possession of the body of another person to continue living, although he was using the Source of Traken to bind his mind to the body. In The Five Doctors (1983), the Master is offered a new cycle of regenerations by the High Council of the Time Lords in exchange for his help. In the 1996 television movie, the Master temporarily inhabits the body of a human, and attempts to take the Doctor's remaining regenerations. In \\"The Sound of Drums\\" (2007), the Master is revealed to have been granted a new body by the Time Lords during the Time War. In this new body, the Master appears to have a new regeneration cycle. The Master regenerates in \\"Utopia\\" (2007) and \\"The Doctor Falls\\" (2017) with dialogue in the latter episode suggesting he has at least one more regeneration. The number of previous incarnations of the Doctor was at first unclear within the series. In the Fourth Doctor story The Brain of Morbius (1976), the Doctor participates in a mental 'duel' with another Time Lord and the machine to which their minds are connected begins to project the faces of the \\"losing\\" contestant's regenerations in chronologically descending order. As the Doctor is overpowered by Morbius, the images change successively to those of the third, second and first Doctors, then eight further faces appear. It was the intention of producer Philip Hinchcliffe and script editor Robert Holmes that images were even earlier incarnations of the Doctor. However, the narrative does not explicitly confirm that the faces do represent incarnations of the Doctor, even though, as the faces are shown, Morbius cries \\"How far Doctor? How long have you lived?\\", indicating that they are not incarnations of Morbius, but rather that it is the Doctor's past being shown.Parkin, Lance & Pearson, Lars (2012). A History: An Unauthorised History of the Doctor Who Universe (3rd Edition), p. 715. Mad Norwegian Press, Des Moines. . In other episodes, it was firmly established that the William Hartnell incarnation of the Doctor was the very first. In The Three Doctors, the Time Lord President describes the Hartnell incarnation as \\"the earliest Doctor\\". This is cemented in The Five Doctors when Peter Davison's Fifth Doctor (introducing himself to the First Doctor) says that he is the fourth regeneration, meaning that there have been five of him. The First Doctor also refers to himself as \\"the original\\". Episodes of the revival series showing the lives of the Doctor -- \\"The Next Doctor\\", \\"The Eleventh Hour\\", \\"The Day of the Doctor\\" and \\"The Husbands of River Song\\"‚Äîall begin with the William Hartnell incarnation. In \\"Twice Upon a Time\\", the William Hartnell incarnation is depicted as indeed being the very first incarnation with the First Doctor expressing fear about undergoing his very first regeneration throughout the story. In \\"The Lodger\\", after the Eleventh Doctor shows Craig who he is, he points to his face and says, \\"Eleventh\\". However, in \\"The Name of the Doctor\\", when the Doctor rescues Clara from inside his own time stream, they both see another figure that Clara doesn't recognise. The Doctor then reveals that this is a past incarnation that he deemed unworthy of the name \\"Doctor\\" due to the atrocities he committed during the Time War, and only accepted him after learning the truth of how the war ended (\\"The Day of the Doctor\\"). Ultimately, in \\"The Time of the Doctor\\" the Eleventh Doctor reveals that, counting the War Doctor and the Tenth's aborted regeneration, he is actually in his final incarnation, reaching a point where he is dying of old age after centuries of conflict with the Daleks and others on the planet Trenzalore. However, at the behest of Clara, the Time Lords grant the Doctor a new regeneration cycle, allowing a thirteenth regeneration into an incarnation known as the Twelfth Doctor. The Twelfth Doctor is later able to regenerate into a female incarnation known as the Thirteenth Doctor after suffering fatal injuries during a battle. In \\"The Time of the Doctor\\", the Eleventh Doctor describes his new regeneration ability as the start of a new 'cycle', implying that he's been restored to the customary twelve regenerations. However, in \\"Kill the Moon\\", the Twelfth Doctor says he's \\"not entirely sure [he] won't keep regenerating forever,\\" once again raising the question regarding any limits to this ability. In \\"Hell Bent\\", Rassilon asks the Doctor \\"How many regenerations did we grant you?\\", and during \\"The Doctor Falls\\", two incarnations of the Master express uncertainty about how long it would take them to kill the Doctor, further implying that the Doctor has a finite number of regenerations even as the exact amount remains undetermined. In \\"The Timeless Children\\", it is revealed that the Doctor is the Timeless Child, a being who predated the Time Lords and who can regenerate an unlimited number of times. Temporary potential future incarnations In some cases, future potential incarnations can achieve independent, though temporary, existence. In Planet of the Spiders, a Time Lord, K'anpo Rinpoche, creates a corporeal projection of a future incarnation which has such an existence under the name Cho Je until he regenerates into that incarnation. The Valeyard, an \\"amalgamation of the darker sides of [the Doctor's] nature, somewhere between [his] twelfth and final incarnation\\", appears in The Trial of a Time Lord (1986) opposite the Sixth Doctor; the Valeyard is promised the remainder of the Doctor's regenerations. Another example is \\"The Watcher\\", who repeatedly appears to the Fourth Doctor in Logopolis (1981), and ultimately merges with him as part of his regeneration into his fifth incarnation. The Time Lords' ability to change species during regeneration is referred to in the television movie by the Eighth Doctor in relation to the Master. Mavic Chen states that the First Doctor's resemblance to an Earth creature is \\"only a disguise\\" in The Daleks' Master Plan (1965). In Destiny of the Daleks (1979), the Fourth Doctor's Time Lady companion Romana demonstrates an apparent ability to \\"try on\\" different bodies from a number of different species during her regeneration, before settling on a final, humanoid form which physically resembles Princess Astra of Atrios. Steven Moffat has said that reference will be made to Peter Capaldi's previous appearances in the Whoniverse during his tenure as the Twelfth Doctor: \\"The face is not set from birth. It‚Äôs not like he was always going to be one day Peter Capaldi. We know that‚Äôs the case because in The War Games he has a choice of faces. So we know it‚Äôs not set, so where does he get those faces from? They can‚Äôt just be randomly generated because they've got lines. They've aged. When he turns into Peter he‚Äôll actually have lines on his face. So where did that face come from?\\" In \\"Deep Breath\\" (2014), the Doctor and several other characters speculate about where his new face came from, given that it has lines from frowning. The Doctor considers aloud that it is a face he recognises from somewhere, but due to post-regenerative trauma, he cannot place it. In \\"The Girl Who Died\\" (2015), he concludes that he subconsciously chose the face as a reminder of his decision to save the life of Caecilius (also played by Capaldi) in \\"The Fires of Pompeii\\" (2008) and to remind him to save people even with possible historical consequences by doing so. Regeneration of non-Gallifreyans The fact that the Master is inhabiting a non-Gallifreyan body when he is offered a new cycle of regenerations (see above) implies that it is possible to grant them to a non-Gallifreyan, albeit one inhabited by a Time Lord mind. In addition, River Song is shown to have the ability to regenerate due to altered DNA that has similarities to Time Lord DNA, a side effect of having been conceived on board the TARDIS as it travelled through the spacetime vortex. Non-Gallifreyans are also seen to regenerate in Underworld (1978) and Mawdryn Undead (1983), but with adverse side effects. In Mawdryn Undead, these appear to be the result of mishandling stolen technology, but in Underworld they are implied to be the inevitable result of limited technology that reinvigorates, rather than transforms, the subject's appearance (in this case, the Minyans, with whom the Time Lords shared much of their technology), thereby regenerating 'the body, not the soul'. Failed/fake regeneration It has been suggested in the series many times that regeneration is not guaranteed and can fail. After his cellular structure is decimated by the Metabelis crystals in Planet of the Spiders, the Third Doctor's regeneration requires \\"a little push\\" from fellow Time Lord K'anpo Rimpoche before it can proceed. As he succumbs to spectrox toxaemia in The Caves of Androzani, the Fifth Doctor says, \\"I might regenerate... I don't know... It feels different this time... is this death?\\" He then hallucinates, seeing his former companions encouraging him to survive, before the Master overwhelms them all, telling him he must die. The 1996 TV movie showed the Doctor's regeneration delayed for more than three hours, with the Eighth Doctor later remarking that the fact his Seventh incarnation was under anaesthesia at the time of his \\"death\\" could have \\"destroyed the regenerative process\\", and that he was \\"dead too long this time\\" prior to his regeneration. In many episodes, the Doctor doubts his own survival, though it is not always clear whether such statements refer to the death of only that particular incarnation. (The only time he makes a completely unambiguous distinction between these two scenarios ‚Äì in \\"The End of Time\\" ‚Äì he makes it clear that he regards regeneration as nearly as bad as death, because as he sees it, he dies and \\"a new man\\" walks away). In The Mind of Evil the Master points a conventional firearm at the Doctor and threatens to \\"put a bullet through both [his] hearts,\\" while in \\"Forest of the Dead\\", Professor Song warns that electrocution would stop both the Time Lord's hearts, killing him. In \\"Turn Left\\", in which the Tenth Doctor dies in a parallel world (he drowned without his future companion Donna Noble there to inspire him to leave), a UNIT member speculates that the Doctor's death must have been too quick to allow for regeneration. In \\"The End of Time\\", the Doctor explains to Wilfred Mott that if he is killed before the regeneration can start, then it will fail. In the Series 6 premiere, \\"The Impossible Astronaut\\", a future version of the Eleventh Doctor is shot twice by the titular astronaut and begins to regenerate. However he is then shot again and dies, showing that not only can he be killed before regeneration, but also during the process (However, the later revelation, in \\"The Wedding of River Song\\" that what was shot was in fact a mechanical avatar of the Doctor and not the real person calls this into question). In the episode \\"Let's Kill Hitler\\", the Doctor is poisoned by River Song which disables the ability to regenerate and he seemingly dies, although he is later revived when River gives up her remaining regenerations to save him. \\"The Time of the Doctor\\" later shows that the Doctor did not have any remaining regenerations at this time anyway. In the mini-episode \\"The Night of the Doctor\\", the Eighth Doctor is killed when the ship he is on crashes onto the planet Karn, reinforcing the idea that a sudden, traumatic death may prevent regeneration. The Sisterhood of Karn explain that he was, in fact, dead, but they were able to use their Time Lord-based technology to revive him and force a regeneration anyway. In \\"Heaven Sent\\", the Twelfth Doctor is badly burned by the Veil, preventing him from regenerating properly. However, as his island prison resets itself after leaving a room, he used what was left of his life to download a past version of himself out of the teleporter's hard drive, which also reset. This cycle of bringing himself back to life by burning his current body as energy for the process continued for approximately 4.5 billion years, according to the episode \\"Hell Bent.\\" In \\"The Lie of the Land\\", the Twelfth Doctor fakes a regeneration after his companion Bill Potts shoots him after he pretends to be siding with the Monks. The bullets that are fired are revealed to have been blanks, and the whole thing was a test by the Doctor to see if Bill was under the Monks' influence. Transference of regenerative energy In Mawdryn Undead, it is first stated that a Time Lord can transfer his regenerative life essence to another being. In that story, the Fifth Doctor is coerced by Mawdryn to give up his future regenerations in order to cure Nyssa and Tegan Jovanka from Mawdryn's disease. Although the transfer does not occur (due to the timely interference of Brigadier Lethbridge- Stewart), the Doctor states that the consequence of the transference would be that he would sacrifice his eight remaining lives and cease to be a Time Lord. It is not until \\"Let's Kill Hitler\\" that a similar transference is shown; in that instance, River Song sacrifices her own regenerative power in order to revive the dead Eleventh Doctor. The favour is returned in \\"The Angels Take Manhattan\\" in which River's wrist is repaired by the Doctor, who subsequently gives up a portion of his regenerative energy despite it later being revealed that the Doctor is out of regenerations at that point. A major plot point of the 1996 TV movie involves the Master scheming to steal the Doctor's remaining regenerations for himself. The Tenth Doctor also consciously aborts a regeneration in \\"Journey's End\\" and instead transfers the energy to his previously severed hand (from \\"The Christmas Invasion\\"), which had been saved in a container by Captain Jack Harkness; when Donna Noble touches it, it creates an entirely new person - a \\"meta-crisis\\" half-human Doctor. The Eleventh Doctor confirms, before himself regenerating during the events of \\"The Time of the Doctor\\", that this action used up a full regeneration. In \\"The Witch's Familiar\\", the Twelfth Doctor offers a small amount of regenerative energy to Dalek creator Davros to sustain him in his dying minutes a bit longer. The Doctor says that doing so \\"may cost [him] an arm or a leg down the road\\". Davros, however, siphons off much more regeneration energy from the Doctor to revitalize himself and transform the Daleks on Skaro into superior hybrid creatures. His plan backfires when decaying Daleks‚Äîincapable of dying, and kept in an underground 'sewer' system when their effective 'lives' have expired‚Äîare also reenergized and attack the Daleks on the surface. The Doctor reveals that he expected such a plot and knew it would backfire.

He briefly stalled the process before embracing regeneration in \\"Twice Upon a Time\\" (2017). The First, War and Eleventh Doctors' bodies died from old age. All other incarnations were killed. In \\"The Timeless Children\\" (2020), it is established that the Doctor has infinite regeneration cycles. Romana's regenerations Romana's tongue-in-cheek regeneration scene in Destiny of the Daleks (1979) contrasts markedly with the Doctor's transformations. In the first episode of the serial, Romana undergoes regeneration, in the process trying out several different forms before choosing to adopt the appearance of Princess Astra, a character she encountered in a previous adventure (The Armageddon Factor). Multiple attempts have been made in the spin-off media to explain the necessity for Romana's regeneration. * In the short story \\"The Lying Old Witch in the Wardrobe\\" by Mark Michalowski, published in the Big Finish Productions anthology, Short Trips: Companions, unknown to the Doctor, Romana suffers damage due to exposure to the Key to Time. Just as she is about to regenerate, a humanoid manifestation of the TARDIS, jealous of Romana, traps her in a force field. It proceeds to pretend to be Romana, changing into different forms until finally becoming a double of Princess Astra. This manifestation is the one who appears in Destiny of the Daleks. Realising the error of its ways after that adventure, it releases Romana, but not before making the female Time Lord assume the image of Astra. * The second explanation is given in the Gallifrey audio series. Gallifrey: Lies by Gary Russell reveals that Romana forced her own regeneration to prevent an ancient Gallifreyan evil called Pandora from gaining power over her (see also History of the Time Lords ‚Äì Audio plays). * The third explanation is in the Fifth Doctor audio story The Chaos Pool by Peter Anghelides, which states that the creators of the Key to Time re- disguised its final segment as Romana, which is why she changed and why she chose Astra's form. The Master's regenerations The Master has only been shown to regenerate once onscreen. However, the Master does change appearance several times, often circumventing the limitations ordinarily placed upon Time Lords. Originally played by Roger Delgado, his decrepit later appearance (following Delgado's death) in The Deadly Assassin (1976) is explained as owing to the fact that he is in his final regeneration. He is driven to acquire a new regeneration cycle, but is ultimately able to circumvent the end of his life by possessing the body of Tremas (Antony Ainley) in The Keeper of Traken (1981). Ainley portrays the Master until the conclusion of the classic series, although still plots at several times to obtain a new regeneration cycle. In the 1996 TV movie, the Master is executed but cheats death by possessing a parasitic creature, which in turn possesses a human named Bruce (Eric Roberts), giving the Master another new form. When the Master is reintroduced in 2007, exposition explains he was resurrected by the Time Lords to fight in the Time War, apparently with a new regeneration cycle. In \\"Utopia\\" (2007), he is fatally shot by his assistant and changes from a form known as Professor Yana, played by Derek Jacobi, into a new incarnation, played by John Simm. Before regenerating, the Master expresses desire to become \\"young and strong\\" like the Tenth Doctor. A character named Missy first appears in \\"Deep Breath\\" (2014) before being revealed as the Master in \\"Dark Water\\" (2014), having regenerated off-screen during the character's absence. For most of Missy's appearances, it is unknown how the Master regenerated into her. It is later revealed in \\"The Doctor Falls\\" that it was Missy herself who forced the regeneration. In an effort to ensure that she would come into existence and stand with the Doctor, Missy stabbed the Master in the back to trigger his regeneration, but made the wound \\"precise\\" so that he would have time to reach his TARDIS before the regeneration began. In return, the Master killed Missy with his laser screwdriver and stated that he'd disabled her regeneration so that she would die permanently of the shot. Though the Master's regeneration into Missy was left inevitable, it was not shown on- screen. However, Missy was unsure if that particular incarnation would regenerate into her directly, being afflicted with memory loss resultant from the crossing of their respective timelines. In several of the short stories published in the Doctor Who universe, some regenerations for the Master are seen including two separate reasons for the Roger Delgado incarnation's regeneration. In the short story Pandoric's Box, the Master is depicted as regenerating into Missy due to his battle with Rassilon who also regenerated as predicted by the Moment. However, this is contradicted by \\"World Enough and Time\\" and \\"The Doctor Falls\\". River Song's regenerations River Song, also known as Melody Pond has regenerated twice throughout the course of the sixth series. Although she is human and the daughter of Amy Pond (hence her surname) and Rory Williams, she was conceived on their wedding night aboard the TARDIS and therefore was born with genetic traits similar to the Doctor's own race, the Time Lords. In \\"Day of the Moon\\" (2011), Melody Pond as a child (Sydney Wade) walks through a New York City alley at the end of the episode in early 1970, suffering from an unknown illness. When a vagrant asks of her condition, she explains that all is well, that she is dying, but she can fix it. She subsequently begins to regenerate in the style of the revived series as the vagrant flees in terror. In \\"Let's Kill Hitler\\", it is revealed that she regenerated into a toddler (Maya Glace-Green). This form later matured into Amy Pond's best friend, Mels (Nina Toussaint-White), who regenerated into her more widely known River Song (Alex Kingston) identity after being shot. In the aforementioned episode, post-regeneration, Melody is immune to a barrage of gunfire due to her surplus regenerative energy. In that same episode, River Song used all her remaining regeneration energy to revive the Doctor; as Amy put it \\"You're safe now. Apparently you used all your remaining regenerations in one go. You shouldn't have done that.\\" She was hospitalised as a result and now no-longer possesses the ability to regenerate. In \\"The Husbands of River Song\\", it is revealed that River possesses an augmented lifespan in her final incarnation, but it is never made clear if this is a side-effect of her part- Time Lord physiology or something she obtained from other means. Other regenerations In \\"Hell Bent\\" (2015), while threatened with a gun, the General states to the Doctor that he is currently in his tenth regeneration. The Doctor then shoots him, causing him to regenerate from an old white man into a younger black woman. The General later states that her previous incarnation was her only one as a male. In \\"The Doctor's Daughter\\" (2008), the Doctor's DNA is used to create the titular \\"daughter\\" Jenny (Georgia Tennant), who displays many but not all Time Lord traits. In the episode's close, she is shot in the chest and appears to die. However, long after the Doctor and his companions have departed, she miraculously resurrects and expels energy from her mouth which, ambiguously enough, both resembles regenerative energy and the energy emitted by a planet-restoring plot device in the same episode. The question as to whether this is a true regeneration is left unanswered, since Jenny does not change her appearance. In \\"The End of Time\\" (2009/2010), the Master attacks the Lord President Rassilon with energy bolts, bringing Rassilon to his knees. By the time of his next appearance in \\"Hell Bent\\", Rassilon has regenerated into a much older incarnation. In the short story Pandoric's Box, it is confirmed that the Master's attack prompted this regeneration as predicted by the Moment. In the premiere of the 2009 spin-off series K-9, the original K-9 Mark I (Leeson) is reintroduced and destroyed, but subsequently revealed to have been installed with a \\"regeneration circuit\\". At this point, the traditional K-9 model \\"regenerates\\" into a more sophisticated-looking CGI model.  Visual effects  Each new regeneration was also radically different from the previous one, even in terms of the visual effects used to represent the moment of regeneration. The very first regeneration was devised and executed by vision mixer Shirley Coward, who had rather unexpectedly come up with a method of achieving the effect electronically. The original plan of the production team was simply that William Hartnell would fall to the floor at the end of The Tenth Planet and pull his cape over his face. Troughton would then appear at the top of The Power of the Daleks, retracting the cloak. Coward's then-innovative vision mix necessitated that Troughton be hastily contracted for The Tenth Planet, part four. The series' first regeneration sequence was then duly recorded on 8 October 1966, with the cliffhanger resolution filmed two weeks later on 22 October. (REF: The Second Doctor Handbook) Older portrayals of regenerations were either a simple fade between two incarnations, a glowing effect that revealed the next incarnation, or one incarnation morphing into the next. Each subsequent regeneration was then filmed in a variety of different ways, as dictated by the director on that particular episode. Indeed, no two regenerations were particularly similar until the Russell T Davies era. Only BBC Wales Doctor Who attempted to standardise the way regeneration looked. Ever since \\"The Parting of the Ways\\" (2005), every regeneration has been portrayed as a \\"golden glow explosion\\" (although the colour of the explosion is fiery orange in \\"The Parting of the Ways\\" and is milky white in \\"Utopia\\"). Rose was the first to describe this type of regenerations, saying \\"I saw him sort of explode, and then you replaced him\\" to the Tenth Doctor immediately after the Ninth Doctor regenerated. Also, these regenerations are portrayed as violent discharges that could harm anyone nearby, to the point where the most powerful occurrences, seen in \\"The End of Time\\" and \\"The Time of the Doctor\\", were able to destroy the Tardis interior and send out a shockwave that destroyed a Dalek ship along with several troops respectively. Each time there was a regeneration with people nearby, either the Doctor or his companions had everyone present get away from the person who was regenerating to avoid them being harmed. In smaller discharges, regeneration was far less harmful and could be emitted from the hand in wisps of golden regeneration energy, which was capable of healing the injuries of others. The subsequent Children in Need special established that there was residual \\"regeneration energy\\" in a gaseous state after a transformation that had to be expelled through the mouth. This was seen again in \\"The Christmas Invasion\\", \\"The Eleventh Hour\\" and \\"The Doctor's Daughter\\" ‚Äî though the latter narrative never made quite clear that Jenny actually regenerated. The Tenth Doctor was seen breathing out gaseous regeneration energy shortly after his transformation, as was the Eleventh Doctor. Consciously holding back the regeneration caused a buildup of energy that resulted in a powerful and violent explosive discharge of regeneration energy. Also, gaining a new cycle of regenerations and Time Lords lives being reset resulted in a shockwave and explosion of regeneration energy with the range of a thermonuclear explosion. Directed regeneration energy discharges could destroy anything in its path, even a Dalek Saucer, while the shock wave destroyed any Dalek troops in the vicinity. The actual regeneration of the Eleventh Doctor, following the wild outburst of regeneration energy that only reset his body, is the first time that the revived series differed from the established process of regeneration. When regenerating into the Twelfth Doctor, the process only includes a brief, mostly off-screen (due to the Doctor leaning back out of the camera) blast of energy. This visual standardisation has allowed narratives to play around with regeneration. The mere presence of \\"regeneration energy\\" can now be used to heighten dramatic tension. This visual short cut, unavailable to production teams in the classic era, has been a particular favourite of Steven Moffat, who used the \\"golden glow\\" liberally throughout the 2011 series; in fact, unlike in the Russell T Davies era, in which nearly every regeneration had subtle differences, every Moffat era regeneration until \\"The Time of the Doctor\\" is nearly identical. Several of the 2011 episodes used that VFX in a way that wordlessly suggested regeneration.

It had expanding rear brakes on the rear, but no front brakes.

He served as New York County District Attorney for more than 30 years, during which he achieved a reputation for professionalism and integrity. Early life and education Hogan was born in Waterbury, New Haven County, Connecticut. He studied at and graduated from Columbia College, Columbia University in 1924. At first, Hogan planned on becoming a reporter and studied journalism. He decided to switch his focus to the law and graduated from Columbia Law School in 1928. Hogan was a member of Beta Theta Pi fraternity at Columbia.  Career  After law school, he entered into private practice for several years. In 1935, he began in the New York County District Attorney's office as an Administrative Assistant District Attorney under Thomas E. Dewey. In 1941, Dewey announced that he would not seek re-election. He suggested four prosecutors whom he believed should succeed him. Although Dewey's list included Hogan's name, his selection surprised Dewey. First Hogan, unlike Dewey, was a registered Democrat and his list was meant for the Republicans. In addition, Dewey did not expect the support of Tammany Hall for his preferred candidate, after he prosecuted some of their leaders. Not only did Tammany offer its support, but the Republicans and the American Labor Party endorsed Hogan, which guaranteed his election. Thus, he became the new District Attorney on January 1, 1942. During his time in the New York County District Attorney's Office, Hogan conducted many widely publicized investigations. Corruption and racketeering were high on his list. He prosecuted high-profile crime figures Joseph Lanza, Joe Adonis and Frank Erickson, as well as corrupt politicians such as Manhattan borough president Hulan Jack and former deputy city controller Eugene Sugarman. In the late 1950s, his office was investigated the rigging of television quiz programs, as well as 'fixed' college basketball games. He prosecuted the well-known Lenny Bruce obscenity case. Another high-profile case involved the exoneration of George Whitmore, Jr. in 1963, after his confession regarding the murder of two women in their upper east side Manhattan apartment was found to be false. In 1949, he considered a run for Mayor of New York when William O'Dwyer announced that he would not seek re-election. Hogan ended the campaign after O'Dwyer changed his mind to run again. He decided to run for the United States Senate in 1958 for the seat that Irving Ives was vacating. While Democratic leaders Averell Harriman and mayor Robert F. Wagner preferred a candidate with a larger statewide profile, Carmine DeSapio, the head of Tammany Hall pushed Hogan's candidacy. The move backfired on DeSapio with Kenneth B. Keating defeating Hogan and Nelson Rockefeller becoming Governor of New York. In later years, some of assistants criticized his style as being too rigid and old- fashioned and that he may have been in office too long. They cited his prosecution of comedian Lenny Bruce in 1964 and anti-war protestors at Columbia University in 1968. In 1971, Governor Nelson Rockefeller appointed Maurice Nadjari over Hogan and the other New York City district attorneys to lead investigations under the Knapp Commission, which mayor John Lindsay established to investigate police corruption. Chairman Whitman Knapp said that Hogan did not properly investigate corruption in the New York City Police Department leading to Nadjari's appointment. The move left Hogan feeling humiliated and damaged his friendship with Knapp, one of his former assistants. The Knapp fallout and a primary challenge from William vanden Heuvel led to speculation that Hogan would not seek a ninth term in office. However, he surprised observers by running in the 1973 election. Vanden Heuvel's campaign message was that the city needed someone new in the district attorney's office. Several days before the election, the New York City Bar Association gave vanden Heuvel an \\"unqualified\\" rating, which may have affected his support. In the end, Hogan won with a two-to-one edge in votes. Personal life Hogan served on the Board of Trustees of Columbia University from 1959 until his death in 1974. He was married to the former Mary Egan. He had surgery for a lung tumor in 1973 and later suffered a stroke on August 10, 1973. Citing ill health, he resigned on December 26 and entered the hospital the following day. Governor Malcolm Wilson appointed Richard Kuh to replace him; Kuh would be sworn in on February 13. He died of cancer at St. Luke's Hospital in Manhattan on April 2, 1974. Legacy The street address of the main office of the New York County District Attorney is One Hogan Place in his honor. Hogan Hall, a dormitory at Columbia University, is also named for him.

One of the most common deepwater sharks in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean, the velvet belly is found from Iceland and Norway to Gabon and South Africa at a depth of . A small shark generally no more than long, the velvet belly is so named because its black underside is abruptly distinct from the brown coloration on the rest of its body. The body of this species is fairly stout, with a moderately long snout and tail, and very small gill slits. Like other lanternsharks, the velvet belly is bioluminescent, with light-emitting photophores forming a species-specific pattern over its flanks and abdomen. The ventral photophores are thought to function in counter-illumination, which camouflages the shark against predators and prey. The bioluminescent flank markings may play a role in intraspecific communication. Young velvet bellies feed mainly on krill and small bony fish, transitioning to squid and shrimp as they grow larger. There is evidence that individuals also move into deeper water as they age. This species exhibits a number of adaptations to living in the deep sea, such as specialized T-cells and liver proteins for dealing with the higher concentrations of heavy metals found there. Velvet bellies often carry a heavy parasite load. It is ovoviviparous, giving birth to litters of six to 20 young every two to three years. This species has virtually no commercial value, but large numbers are caught as bycatch in deepwater commercial fisheries. Although it has been assessed as of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the heavy fishing pressure throughout its range and its slow reproductive rate are raising conservation concerns. Taxonomy Profile view of a velvet belly lanternshark, from Les Poissons (1877). The velvet belly was originally described as Squalus spinax by Swedish natural historian Carl Linnaeus, known as the \\"father of taxonomy\\", in the 1758 tenth edition of Systema Naturae. He did not designate a type specimen; the specific epithet spinax is in reference to the spiny dorsal fins. This species was later moved to the genus Etmopterus via the synonymy of Constantine Samuel Rafinesque's Etmopterus aculeatus with Squalus spinax. The velvet belly is grouped with the Caribbean lanternshark (E. hillianus), fringefin lanternshark (E. schultzi), brown lanternshark (E. unicolor), broadbanded lanternshark (E. gracilispinis), combtooth lanternshark (E. decacuspidatus), and dwarf lanternshark (E. perryi) in having irregularly arranged, needle-shaped dermal denticles. Its common name comes from this shark's black ventral surface, which is sharply delineated from the rest of its body like a patch of velvet. Distribution and habitat The range of the velvet belly is in the eastern Atlantic, extending from Iceland and Norway to Gabon, including the Mediterranean Sea, the Azores, the Canary Islands, and Cape Verde. It has also been reported off Cape Province, South Africa. This shark mainly inhabits the outer continental and insular shelves and upper slopes over mud or clay, from close to the bottom to the middle of the water column. It is most common at a depth of , though in the Rockall Trough, it is only found at a depth of . This species has been reported from as shallow as , and as deep as . Description The black underside of the velvet belly lanternshark gives it its common name. The velvet belly is a robustly built shark with a moderately long, broad, flattened snout. The mouth has thin, smooth lips. The upper teeth are small, with a narrow central cusp and usually fewer than three pairs of lateral cusplets. The lower teeth are much larger, with a strongly slanted, blade-like cusp at the top and interlocking bases. The five pairs of gill slits are tiny, comparable in size to the spiracles. Both dorsal fins bear stout, grooved spines at the front, with the second much longer than the first and curved. The first dorsal fin originates behind the short and rounded pectoral fins; the second dorsal fin is twice the size of the first and originates behind the pelvic fins. The anal fin is absent. The tail is slender, leading to a long caudal fin with a small lower lobe and a low upper lobe with a prominent ventral notch near the tip. The dermal denticles are thin with hooked tips, arranged without a regular pattern well-separated from one another. The coloration is brown above, abruptly transitioning to black below. There are thin black marks above and behind the pelvic fins, and along the caudal fin. The velvet belly possesses numerous photophores that emit a blue-green light visible from away. Varying densities of photophores are arranged in nine patches on the shark's sides and belly, creating a pattern unique to this species: photophores are present along the lateral line, scattered beneath the head but excluding the mouth, evenly on the belly, and concentrated around the pectoral fins and beneath the caudal peduncle.Martin, R.A. Deep Sea: Velvetbelly Lanternshark. ReefQuest Centre for Shark Research. Retrieved on June 24, 2009. The maximum reported length is , although few are longer than 45 cm (18 in). Females are larger than males. Biology and ecology Velvet belly lanternshark preserved in formalin. Along with the blackmouth catshark (Galeus melastomus) and the Portuguese dogfish (Centroscymnus coelolepis), the velvet belly is one of the most abundant deep- sea sharks in the northeastern Atlantic. It is found individually or in small shoals. Samplings in the Mediterranean have found females outnumbering males across all ages; this imbalance increases in the older age classes. In the Rockall Trough and the Catalan Sea, large adults are found in deeper waters than juveniles, which may serve to reduce competition between the two groups. However, this pattern has not been observed at other sites in the eastern Mediterranean. The velvet belly's liver accounts for 17% of its body mass, three-quarters of which is oil, making it nearly neutrally buoyant. To deal with the higher concentrations of heavy metals in the deep sea, the velvet belly has T-cells in its bloodstream that can identify and mark toxic compounds for elimination. These T-cells are produced by a lymphomyeloid gland in its esophagus called a \\"Leydig's organ\\", which is also found in some other sharks and rays. In its liver, specialized proteins are also capable of detoxifying cadmium, copper, mercury, zinc, and other toxic contaminants. The velvet belly's bioluminescence is thought to function in counter-illumination, which eliminates the shark's silhouette and camouflages it from upward-looking predators. Its bioluminescence may also serve a social function, such as finding mates or co-ordinating groups, as the pattern is species-specific. The velvet belly is an important food of larger fishes such as other sharks; a major predator of this species is the longnosed skate (Dipturus oxyrinchus). Velvet bellies are often heavily parasitized; this shark has an Anelasma squalicola barnacle attached near the fin spine. Numerous parasites are known for this species, and both juveniles and adults often carry heavy parasite loads. Known internal parasites include the monogenean Squalonchocotyle spinacis, the tapeworms Aporhynchus norvegicus, Lacistorhynchus tenuis, and Phyllobothrium squali, and the nematodes Anisakis simplex and Hysterothylacium aduncum. Some of these parasites use the velvet belly's prey as intermediate hosts and are acquired via ingestion, while others use the shark itself as an intermediate host. The barnacle Anelasma squalicola, an external parasite, attaches to the shark's dorsal spine socket and penetrates deeply into the muscle, in the process often providing an attachment site for a second (and rarely a third) barnacle. Infestation by this barnacle reduces its host's fecundity by impairing the development of the reproductive organs. Feeding As generalist predators, velvet bellies feed on crustaceans (e.g. pasiphaeid shrimp and krill), cephalopods (e.g. ommastrephid squid and sepiolids), and bony fishes (e.g. shads, barracudinas, lanternfishes, and pouts). Sharks off Italy also eat small amounts of nematodes, polychaete worms, and other cartilaginous fishes. Studies of velvet bellies off Norway and Portugal, and in the Rockall Trough, have found small sharks under long feed mainly on the krill Meganyctiphanes norvegica and the small fish Maurolicus muelleri. As the sharks grow larger, their diets become more varied, consisting mainly of squid and the shrimp Pasiphaea tarda, as well fishes other than M. muelleri. It has been speculated that smaller velvet bellies may be too slow to catch fast-moving cephalopods. The cephalopod diet of adults overlaps with that of the Portuguese dogfish; the latter species may avoid competition with the velvet belly by living in deeper water. The bite force exerted by the velvet belly is only around 1 N. Life history The velvet belly is ovoviviparous, with the embryos hatching inside the uterus and being sustained by a yolk sac. The reproductive cycle may be two to three years long, with ovulation occurring in early autumn, fertilization in the summer (or possibly in the winter if females are capable of storing sperm), and parturition in late winter or early spring. The gestation period is under one year. The litter size is six to 20, with the number of young increasing with female size. At birth, the young measure long. The shark's bioluminescence develops before birth; the yolk sac is fluorescent before any photophores have formed, suggesting the mother transfers luminescent materials to her offspring. The first luminous tissue appears when the embryo is long, and the complete pattern is laid down by the time it is long. At birth, the young shark is already capable of counter-illumination with 80% of its ventral surface luminescent. The growth rate of the velvet belly is slow, though faster than some other deep-sea sharks, such as the leafscale gulper shark (Centrophorus squamosus) or the shortspine spurdog (Squalus mitsukurii). Males mature sexually at long and females at long. The average age at maturity is 4.0 years for males and 4.7 years for females, though four-year-old mature individuals of both sexes have been caught in the wild, along with immature females over eight years old. Males and females eight and 11 years old, respectively, have been caught in the wild; the potential lifespan of this species has been estimated at 18 years for males and 22 years for females. Human interactions Throughout their range, substantial quantities of velvet bellies are caught as bycatch in bottom trawls meant for shrimp and lobsters, and deepwater longlines meant for other fish. Lacking commercial value, these sharks are almost always discarded with extremely high mortality, though occasionally they are dried and salted or made into fishmeal. The IUCN has listed the velvet belly under Least Concern overall, as its population remains stable across much of its range, and it is afforded some protection in the Mediterranean from a 2005 ban on bottom trawling below . However, in the northeastern Atlantic it has been assessed as Near Threatened, as its numbers have declined by almost 20% from 1970 to 1998-2004. The slow reproductive rate of this species limits its capacity to recover from population depletion.

Originally published in 1979, and illustrated by comic artist Luis Bermejo, it is the first book of Pournelle's Janissaries series. The following books are Janissaries: Clan and Crown, Janissaries III: Storms of Victory and Janissaries IV: Mamelukes. Like King David's Spaceship, a novel in Pournelle's CoDominium Series, it is the story of a capable military leader undertaking campaigns on a backward planet. Plot introduction In Janissaries, the leader is a United States Army officer from the Cold War period, Captain Rick Galloway, who along with his platoon-sized unit of soldiers primarily from the U.S. are abducted from a CIA-run operation against Cubans in the fictional tropical African country of Sainte-Marie by a flying saucer. The beings abducting them present themselves as rescuers from a hopeless situation where Galloway's unit is about to be overrun by Cubans in a night assault, the aftermath of which is expected to be the deaths of all. Afterwards, the human soldiers have the option of serving the aliens in a special situation involving a more primitive planet on which there are humans living in medieval conditions. The soldiers are expected to be able to use their superior weapons and tactics to conquer part of the planet. Plot summary In the midst of the Cold War, the CIA has recruited a number of soldiers to fight as U.S. proxies against communist Cubans in the fictional tropical African country of Sainte Marie. Nearly all of the soldiers are from the U.S. military, though some seem to be genuine soldiers of fortune. After some success, they suffer combat reversals and are on the run. Part of the group secures a hilltop for aerial evacuation. Others, too wounded to move quickly, but capable of fighting in place, have set an ambush at a crossroads to slow down the pursuing Cubans long enough for helicopters to arrive. The fifty or so troops on the hilltop are commanded by Captain Rick Galloway, Lieutenant Andre Parsons and the highly experienced Sergeant Major Elliott. They hear the sounds of their comrades at the crossroads being overrun; it becomes clear that the Cubans will soon assault the hill. They are able to contact headquarters on the radio but, instead of the hoped-for rescue, they are told the helicopters will not be coming and are ordered to surrender to the Cubans. Knowing that the best they can expect from Cubans if they surrender is execution, they refuse the order and begin to prepare a hopeless defense. Then a \\"flying saucer\\" approaches and lands. Captain Galloway enters the craft, then re-emerges and tells his men that it is a CIA aircraft. He orders everyone to get aboard with all equipment. Some of the mercenaries had fled at the approach of the craft, but Rick and thirty-eight others board. The craft, crewed by aliens, takes them to a base on the far side of Earth's moon. There they are told by a human administrator called Agzaral, who describes himself as the representative of an interstellar confederation, that their leaving Earth was permanent and that they can either work for their alien rescuers, the Shalnuksis, or face an uncertain future in a civilization that has little use for unskilled humans (the same kind of slave-soldier deal offered to the eponymous Janissaries of the Ottoman Empire). The Shalnuksis want the mercenaries to take control of sufficient land on a primitive planet called Tran to grow a crop of illegal, mind-altering recreational plants, which they will trade with the Shalnuksis for necessities and luxuries. There are already humans there, descended from previous Shalnuksis drop-offs, in various states of civilization, all of them well behind that of 20th century Earth. With their modern weapons, they are told, they should be able to take over and live like kings. The mercenaries are set down on Tran and are joined by another Earthling, Gwen, the girlfriend of the spaceship pilot. She had become pregnant with the pilot's child and, since the Shalnuksis would not have allowed the child to live, she chose abandonment instead. Soon afterwards Parsons leads a mutiny because he believes Rick to be too soft for the task at hand. Rick and Corporal Mason are banished, with Gwen electing to go with them. Parsons then takes the mercenaries and helps a local leader, Sarakos, invade and conquer the kingdom of Drantos. Rick's group head in the opposite direction and soon encounter a small party of locals led by a young woman named Tylara, a former duchess of Drantos, who recently escaped the captivity of Sarakos. She is fleeing with two companions back to her homeland, Tamaerthon, where her father Drumold is Grand Chief. Rick decides to join them, and in due course gains his people a new home. When they arrive Rick learns that the highland-living Tamaerthans, who are descended from Celtic arrivals from over 2,000 years ago, have a desperate problem. Due to adverse weather conditions their recent harvest was poor and many will starve in the coming winter unless something is done. Rick organizes and trains the Tamaerthans to fight more effectively, mingling their exceptional longbowmen with defensive pikemen. He then leads them on a raid on an outpost of the neighboring, powerful empire established by humans kidnapped from ancient Rome during the reign of Septimius Severus. The local Roman governor, Marselius, attacks with his heavy, cataphract-like cavalry and is soundly defeated by the pike-longbow combination of the Tamaerathans. After winning the battle, the Tamaerathans obtain enough food to last the winter. Paradoxically, Rick manages to form an alliance with Marcellus that will ensure there will be no reprisals for the raid. Tylara and Rick fall in love and prepare to be married in the spring. Then an opportunity arises to restore Tylara to her former position in Drantos, which will put Rick squarely in opposition to Parsons and his remaining men (two-thirds having deserted). Initially reluctant, Rick comes up with a plan to end Sarakos's dominion over Drantos and begins production of artillery superior to anything except the heavy weapons of the mercenaries. On the eve of battle, having prepared a gunpowder mine trap to kill all of Parsons' men just before dawn, Rick decides to meet with Parsons to try to get him to switch sides in an attempt to avoid killing the mercenaries. Parsons attempts to assassinate him, however Tylara shoots him first. With the death of Parsons, all of his mercenaries join Rick. Without their support, and with the modern tactics and weapons, Sarakos is easily defeated.

Life Millie and Christine (the \\"Carolina Twins\\") were born in Whiteville, North Carolina on July 11, 1851, to Jacob and Monemia McKoy who were slaves of blacksmith, Jabez McKay.Martell, Joanne. \\"Millie- Christine: Fearfully and Wonderfully Made\\". John F. Blair, Publisher, 2000, p. 4. The McKay farm was near the town of Whiteville. Prior to the sisters' birth, their mother had borne seven other children, five boys and two girls, all of ordinary size and form. The twins were conjoined at the lower spine and stood at an approximately 90-degree angle to each other. The twins were first sold at 10 months of age to South Carolinian John C. Pervis. Pervis and McKay reached an agreement where Pervis exhibited the girls for pay and then paid a percentage to McKay. Fourteen months after the original sale, they were sold to a showman, Brower, who had the backing of a wealthy merchant named Joseph Pearson Smith. Brower first exhibited the twins at North Carolina's first state fair, held in 1853. They were constantly being called \\"freaks of nature\\". The North Carolina State Fair was a success for Brower and the Carolina Twins, however Brower's fortune changed over the next months. Brower was conned by a Texas adventurer, who offered land worth an estimated forty- five thousand dollars as a purchase price for the twins. Brower accepted, sent the twins on to the Texan, and then waited several days for the deeds before realizing that he had been swindled. Brower returned to North Carolina to relate the loss to Joseph Pearson Smith. Since Brower was left destitute, Smith was given the promissory note and was now the owner of the Carolina Twins. Millie and Christine were handled by several managers before being reclaimed by Smith in Britain in 1857. On January 1, 1863, the Emancipation Proclamation ended their slave status and they were no longer anyone's property. Before their emancipation, the girls had been showcased in fairs and freak shows in several U.S. cities and even Montreal, Canada. Smith traveled to Britain to collect the girls and brought with him their mother, Monemia, from whom they had been separated. He and his wife provided the twins with an education and taught them to speak five languages, dance, play music, and sing. During their time in Britain, they met Queen Victoria. For the rest of the century, the twins enjoyed a successful career as \\"The Two-Headed Nightingale\\", and appeared with the Barnum circus. In 1869, a biography on the twins, titled History and Medical Description of the Two-Headed Girl, was sold during their public appearances. Joanne Fish Martell, former court reporter, discovered a memoir written by the girls at the age of 17 and with that and other sources, created her book Millie-Christine: Fearfully and Wonderfully Made, which was published in 2000. The twins' motto was \\"As God decreed, we agreed,\\" and they strove to turn impediments into assets. As toddlers, they were clumsy and fell down quite frequently. They eventually developed a sideways walk that turned into a crowd-pleasing dance style. They were able to master keyboard duets with one soprano and one alto voice, and learned to harmonize. When they were in their 30s, the twins moved back to the farm where they were born, which their father had bought from Jabez McKay and left to them. On October 8, 1912, Millie and Christine died at age 61 of tuberculosis; Christine died 12 hours after her sister. They were buried in unmarked graves but in 1969 they were moved to a cemetery in Whiteville. Biography An undated and unsigned biography of the sisters was written around 1905. It includes events from their childhood, their kidnapping and movement to England, and finally their return to the United States and a bit of their life afterwards. The writing is only 22 pages long and contains letters from various physicians attesting to the genuine nature of the twins' conjoined physiology. At the end of the work, the girls answer the question as to whether they are one person or two, saying \\"Although we speak of ourselves in the plural we feel as but one person; in fact as such we have ever been regarded, although we bear the names Millie and Christina\\" (McKoy, 20).

He was the first Rouran ruler to adopt Chinese style era name, which was Yongkang (Ê∞∏Â∫∑ Y«íngkƒÅng 464-484). He was the elder son of Yujiul√º Tuhezhen.  Reign  He sought peaceful relations with Chinese states at first. He sent a tribute to Liu Song in 468 in 471. Another tribute composed of Kumo Xi and Khitan slaves were sent to Northern Wei in February and July 469. He continued his father's campaign against Tarim Base states following year. During a campaign against Khotan in 470, the Khotanese king wrote in his supplicatory letter to the Emperor Xianwen that all of the statelets in the west had submitted to the Rouran, asking for assistance. This brought Rouran against Northern Wei. In February 472 and 473, Yucheng attacked Northern Wei across the western border, targeting Dunhuang. He tried to reconcile with Wei by asking a hand of a princess in 475.However, Wei court refused it, citing frequent raids of Rouran into their territory. Yucheng continued his tributes to Northern Wei in 476 and 477. However in 478, Yucheng used the opportunity of fall of Liu Song to attack Wei. He met with Wang Hongfan (ÁéãÊ¥™ËåÉ), the envoy of Xiao Daocheng, made a common pact and sent 300,000 troops to attack the Northern Wei. He made another alliance in 473, this time with Jangsu of Goguryeo with a view to keeping Northern Wei under control. Allied Rouran-Korean armies crushed Didouyu Khitans later in 479.

Accessed on line November 20, 2007. It can also refer to \\"the process by which Western culture is being exported and diffused into other nations.‚Äù Cultural leveling within the United States has been driven by mass market media such as radio and television broadcasting and nationwide distribution of magazines and catalogs.p. 247, Why Viewers Watch: A Reappraisal of Television's Effects, Jib Fowles, Sage Publications, 1992, . Some of these means and effects are considered artifacts of the Machine Age of the 1920s and 1930s. Today the interactions between countries worldwide have allowed the opportunity for intercultural dialogue. Countries world wide have undergone a form of cultural leveling. Some countries being more open to it than others. Japan, for example, has assimilated Western styles of dress and music into a blend or Western and Eastern Cultures. Today, due to the crossing or travel and communication with time and space there is just about no ‚Äúother side of the world‚Äù anymore, giving us the inevitable result of what is known as cultural leveling. Eclecticism and cultural leveling both share a similar ideology in the separation of culture from human nature creating the potential risk or enslavement and manipulation. Cultural leveling is notably present in minorities instead of large cultures driven to aspire wealth and there is more commonality present in minorities. At times countercultures and subcultures may pose as a resistance to cultural change within society. Local cultures did diffuse across each other in earlier times as material items hence influencing a change in the cultural atmosphere. These diffusions have been part of most significant cultural changes in recorded history. To convey how fundamental the loss of diversity and the subsequent leveling have been, many sociologists such as Daniel Lerner amplified the opinion through the phrase ‚Äúthe passing of traditional society.‚Äù  Relativism and Cultural Leveling Seen as Double Threat  Baku (2009), asserted that Relativism enables diverse cultures to coexist. Meanwhile, cultural leveling eliminates the cultural differences that make a person unique. Further more there has seen to be a ‚Äúcommercialization of cultural exchange: that of cultural eclecticism and that of cultural leveling.‚Äù Cultural leveling results in the standardization of behaviors and lifestyles which sets out to create the danger for losing the significance of cultures and traditions of different countries. Danger lies within cultural leveling such that indiscriminate acceptance of types of conduct and lifestyles. In this way one loses sight of the profound significance of the different nations, of the traditions of the various people, by which the individuals define himself in relation to life‚Äôs fundamental questions.  Transnationality of People, Places and Cultures  It is evident that today that both local and global personal interconnectedness is becoming increasingly opaque.  Der Querschnitt  The golden years of the Der Querschnitt ranged from 1924 to 1929 when it was edited and achieved the cosmopolitism of its contributions by Hermann von Wedderkop. The journal of the Der Querschnitt contained comparisons of cultures, places and religions followed by the pace in which cultural leveling was progressing within a global perspective. The Der Querschnitt makes the concept of cultural leveling quite easy to identify. The Querschnitt is not only a European journal, but a cosmopolitan one as well as it represents contemporary trends both older and newer. By the end of the twenties, people at both ends of the social scale danced to the same rhythms and listened to the same hit songs as high culture was replaced with a popular new version of the high art of reality, the music of mass entertainment, jazz, and the cinema. These new trendy concepts claimed that boxing and jazz were the only interesting art forms of the modern age and \\"negro music\\" set the standards for what was new and stimulating. These different changes were seen to be successful mainly because modernity in cities and regions and the interchangeable aspects of modern life fascinated individuals and provided them with a brand new way of life.  Cultural Products in Balkan Countries  In the twenties, cities in the Balkans were undergoing overwhelming changes. As a Japanese journalist reports, most of the hairstyles we know today were adopted from the styles and fashion from Tokyo. The hairstyle we commonly know today as the \\"bob\\", which is now a major Hollywood style, used to be known as the new Geisha hair cut originating in Tokyo. The entire region between Budapest and Istanbul displayed the same lifestyle: \\"jazz bands, gramophones, Chaplin posters, international press, nudist magazines from Berlin, comics from Paris), taxis, symptoms of women‚Äôs emancipation in the Turkish- Levantine salons.\\" Mass produced goods and multicultural unreality of everyday are two aspects of global cultural leveling displayed in the Balkans. With all the chaotic co-existence of cultural products in the Balkans, reports have stated that it however does not actually frighten the visitor and that people should deal with the chaos of transnational influences that they are suddenly exposed to in the course of time.  National Resistance Against International Modernization  Reports from cities such as Prague and Budapest showed odd mannerism and resistance toward modernization during a period of transition, as old European traditions, legends and monuments are deeply rooted in Prague. Reports on Prague‚Äôs sense of national folklore and Budapest‚Äôs ambivalent modernity demonstrate how the world's old continent cities cope with cultural leveling. The German, along with foreign correspondents typically tend to share the \\"New Sobriety‚Äôs\\" fascination with cultural leveling, while America was consistently referred to as the \\"cultural model of the future\\". Mass culture and technological modernity are typically adopted by large major cities however old traditions place a strain on some cities when it comes to adapting to new trends. Capital cities tend to imitate each other during the spread of cultural modernity. For example, \\"in European capital cities, London was in the shadow of Berlin‚Äôs progressive modernity, while prior to that Berlin was in the shadow of Paris.\\"  Economic Leveling Process  A great Jewish scholar Erich Auerbach wrote in his masterpiece Mimesis during the Second World War: ‚ÄúBeneath the conflicts, and also through them, an economic and cultural leveling process is taking place. It is still a long way to a common life of mankind on earth, but the goal begins to be visible.\\" Still, half a century later one hesitates to describe the globalization that was taking place as an ‚Äúeconomic leveling process.\\" Meanwhile, Auerbach looked at cultural leveling with growing worry, however it was an unquestionable reality yet difficult to grasp. \\"In an essay published in 1952, Auerbach remarked that Goethe‚Äôs concept of Weltliteratur had become increasingly inadequate, explaining the difficulty of a philologist from a single cultural tradition to be able to approach a world in which so many languages and so many cultural traditions interact.\\" Erich Auerbach goes into depth about his belief that one must look for both starting points and concrete details from which the \\"global process can be inductively reconstructed.\\" In the conclusion to Auerbach's Mimesis, he stated \\"The ongoing unification of the world is most concretely visible now in the unprejudiced, precise, interior and exterior representation of the random moment in the lives of different people.‚Äù It is the same kind of class struggle approach in the cultural field that they had taken in the economic field, assembling the shortcoming against the privileged. Cultural leveling efforts were forcefully resumed during the early age among many individuals.  Religion  Religion has always been a main source of cultural change and disruption. Numerous theoretical strategies have been used to explain religion and its role in society. But, in this age of consequent cultural leveling, no theory of religion would be complete if it failed to include the impact of cultural change on religions and the individuals who follow them. Karl Marx, in the words of Brian Morris, believed that \\"religion was, in a sense, a secondary phenomenon and depended on socioeconomic circumstances. It could only be overcome, therefore, when the circumstances that gave rise to religion were themselves transformed.\\" According to A.R. Radcliffe-Brown, \\"religion is a storehouse for the mores and ethics conducive to a well-functioning society and embodies truth and meaning, and the individual's role is merely one of assimilating the existing belief system.\\"  The Negative and Positive Outcomes of Cultural Leveling  Consequently, through the development of cultural leveling it is evident that some of the negative impacts are the disappearance of dialect in the aspect where individuals who spoke different language gradually disappear as the society acknowledges one language. Other negative outcomes include: the reduction of cultural diversity where individuals lose the significance of being different, loss of cultural uniqueness, loss of cultural heritage, and struggle of accepting the results of cultural leveling. Some positive outcomes of cultural leveling include: uniformity, cooperation, and efficient work(common understanding across the board). Cultural leveling influences cultural aspects to unfold what challenges the present precepts of society.  Cultural Leveling and Marxism  It is evident that communist leaders pursued cultural leveling not only because they remained committed to the Marxist doctrine of eliminating class distinctions, but also because they deeply distrusted the old elites and were determined to prevent them from maintaining and reproducing their class advantage. *Cultural appropriation *Cultural assimilation References Category:Cultural assimilation Category:Cultural geography ","title":"Cultural leveling"},{"id":"7223100","text":"Buffalo Blues, baseball team 1915 William E. Robertson was president of the Buffalo, New York Federal League baseball team The Buffalo Blues were a professional baseball club that played in the short-lived Federal League, which was a minor league in 1913 and a full-fledged outlaw major league the next two years. It was the last major league baseball team to be based in the city of Buffalo. In 1913 and 1914, as was the standard for Federal League teams, the franchise did not have an official name, instead going by the generic BufFeds. The Buffalo team played at International Fair Association Grounds. Due to delays in construction of their new ballpark, the team did not play their first home game until a month after the Federal League season had started. Buffalo sold shares of stock of the team to the public through a series of newspaper ads. Preferred shares were sold for $10 each. In the 1914 season, the team posted an 80‚Äì71 record (.530) and finished in fourth place, seven games behind the league champion Indianapolis Hoosiers. In the league's second and final season, the team, then known as the Buffalo Blues, ended in sixth place with a 74‚Äì78 mark (.487), 12 games behind the Chicago Whales. An unusual player who played for the Blues in 1914 was Ed Porray; the only major leaguer whose birthplace is not a place, but rather noted as \\"on a ship somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean,\\" on December 5, 1888. Between the Buffalo players who had experience in the American and/or National leagues were Hugh Bedient, Walter Blair, Hal Chase, Tom Downey, Howard Ehmke, Ed Lafitte, Harry Lord and Russ Ford. Buffalo Baseball Buffalo has had three attempts at major league baseball. Prior to the Buffeds, were the Buffalo Bisons, from which the current minor league team derives its name and history. They entered the NL in 1879 and came in third place only 10 games out from first place. They had two notable players; Hall of Famers Pud Galvin and Dan Brouthers. The Bisons team was dropped from the NL in 1885. In 1890, another Buffalo baseball team emerged coincidentally called the Bisons. This team, a member of the upstart Players League, has notably one of the worst season records to date. The Buffalo Blues were the last of the three major league teams Buffalo had between 1879 and 1915.http://mopupduty.com/index.php/buffalo-baseball-briefly/ A proposed Continental League team (to be owned by future Buffalo Sabres owner Robert O. Swados) was slated for Buffalo in 1961, but the league folded before playing any games. The closest that any major league baseball team has come to Buffalo since then is Toronto ( away as the crow flies), where the Toronto Blue Jays have played since 1977. The Blue Jays have a modest following in Buffalo, particularly since the team affiliated with the Bisons in the 2013 season and subsequently improved its on-field fortunes to qualify for the playoffs in 2015. (Major League Baseball, despite the proximity, does not consider Buffalo to be in the Blue Jays' territory for regionally televised broadcasts, instead placing the area in the territory of the two New York City teams, southeast and further away than MLB teams in Toronto, Cleveland and Pittsburgh). Due to border travel restrictions stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Blue Jays are playing their home games at Buffalo's Sahlen Field (a facility designed to be easily upgraded to MLB standards) for the 2020 Major League Baseball season, marking the first major league games played in Buffalo in 104 years.https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/bluejays/2020/07/24/toronto- blue-jays-play-home-games-buffalo-2020/5502146002/ See also * 1914 Buffalo Buffeds season * 1915 Buffalo Blues season * Buffalo Blues all-time roster References External links *Baseball Hall of Fame *Baseball Reference *Bison's History: The 1910s *Federal League ballparks *Federal League teams *Buffalo Baseball at mopupduty.com Category:Baseball teams established in 1914 Category:Baseball teams disestablished in 1915 Category:Federal League teams Buffalo Buffeds Category:Sports in Buffalo, New York Category:History of Buffalo, New York Category:1914 establishments in New York (state) Category:1915 disestablishments in New York (state) Category:Defunct baseball teams in New York (state) ","title":"Buffalo Blues"},{"id":"7223123","text":"Shadowplay is a fantasy novel by American writer Tad Williams, the second book in the Shadowmarch tetralogy. It was released in hardcover in the US in March, 2007 and has been released with a region-specific hard cover in the United Kingdom (March 1, 2007). Book one, Shadowmarch, was published in November 2004. Book three of Shadowmarch, Shadowrise was released in March, 2010. A fourth book, Shadowheart, completes the series. Shadowmarch was originally released between June 2001 and August 2002 as a bi-weekly episodic serial online, with a one-time $14.99 charge necessary to read chapters beyond the five initial free ones, however a lack of subscribers led to the completed first novel (and subsequent volumes) returning to orthodox publishing.Slashdot: Results of Another Web Publishing Experiment The book contains additional chapters not found in the original online version. UK edition cover by Steve Stone Originally, Tad Williams conceived Shadowmarch as an idea for a fantasy movie and later a fantasy TV series. Shadowmarch became a print project only after both options fell through. Originally, Michael Whelan was the cover artist for Shadowmarch and indeed for most Tad Williams books since 1988, but since he is now concentrating on his fine-art work, artist Todd Lockwood has taken over the series from him. The Shadowplay cover features a painting of Xis, the city of the Autarch.

The Leboku New Yam festival is peculiar to the core Yak·∫°·∫° speaking communities: Ugep, Idomi, Ekori, Mkpani and Nko, and the international version is celebrated in Ugep once in a year. Each of the communities mentioned being peculiar to the Festival have a distinct day secluded or set aside for the celebration in their respective communities. These are; Lemomor boku, Lelomi boku, Lekoli boku, Lekpanikpani boku and Lekakaa boku. This is celebrated to honor the earth goddess and the ancestral spirits of the land in Ugep, one of the five settlements of Yakurr. The three- week festival is the culmination of many events: the beginning of the yam harvest, a time to appease the gods and ancestors, a public parade of engaged maidens, a commemoration of events that led to the migration from the Yakurr ancestral home to the present site, and a period of holiday in the Yakurr traditional calendar (mid-August through mid-September). The Yakurr calendar runs from August to July. During the Leboku, people keep away from intense farming activities and exchange visits with their families. The Leboku is also meant to usher in peace, good health and prosperity. Leboku celebration The three-week celebration starts with the Mblemi. On this day, the harvest of new yams is officially flagged off. Beautifully attired women from different farm-roads and groups later parade the town with their harvests. The second day is the Janenboku, which literally translated means \\"women‚Äôs festival day\\". On this day, gifts are given to women by their loved ones and friends. Some traditional dances also take place. Tourists on the night of Janenboku are faced with two options ‚Äì the traditional carnival-like drumming and dancing to the rhythm of the Ekoi drums to usher in the Ledemboku, held in the playground or the modern-day Miss Leboku Beauty Pageant, held in one of the hotels within the town. Day three is the Ledemboku or \\"men‚Äôs festival day\\". It involves exchange of gifts to males, performance by the male Ekoi dancers, a parade of the Obol Lopon and his Bi-Inah (council of chiefs), a parade and dances by leg-bangle-wearing Leboku maidens to the rhythm of the Ekoi drums, and a display by the Etangala masquerade, whose only outing yearlong is on this day. It should also be noted that the all-embracing Etangala group have as its head, a non-Ugep, Chief Ig Ekpenyong, the Obol Etangala I of Ugep is an Efik man. After a day of rest, which affords the Leboku maidens opportunities to cultivate new friends, known as Nkokeboi, there is Leteboku. The Leteboku is a performance poetry contest among Leboku maidens from each of the traditional Ugep wards. The songs danced to, and the rhythm produced by the leg-bangles worn by the maidens is a delight to watch. Two days after the Leteboku, which are normally observed as rest days, is the Yekpi. It is a day when boys and Leboku maidens parade the town in a ceremony believed to usher in peace and prosperity. The Yeponfawa follows the Yekpi. This is a ceremony reserved only for initiates of the Libini group, to declare the first phase of the Leboku over. Although this takes place during the night, it is also a day non- initiates stay awake to listen to the songs. After the Yeponfawa, young boys and girls participate in a one-week music and festival through their dance ensembles known as Egbendum (for boys) and Oka (for girls). Every neighbourhood has its own group, which is directed by an adult, who also teaches them songs and dance steps. The Leboku comes to an end with the exit of the Egbendum and Oka sessions. Children are normally hosted to a feast of yam porridge and palm wine. The yams and palm wine are collected from parents, relatives and farmers in farm-roads located in the children's neighbourhood.

History  Zenith had experimented with pay television as early as 1931, believing that advertising alone could not support television broadcasting as a viable enterprise in the long term. Zenith had originally occupied television channel 1 in Chicago starting on February 2, 1939, when W9XZV went on the air. W9XZV was one of America's first non-mechanical television stations and, until October 1940, the only television station in Chicago. Zenith's allocation was later moved to channel 2. In 1947, Zenith announced a perfected pay television system and selected the name \\"Phonevision\\" as the trademark for the concept. In 1950, in preparation for the public pay television test, the experimental station moved from the Zenith factory to the Field Building and became KS2XBS. In July 1953, Zenith was forced to shut down KS2XBS when WBBM-TV was moved from channel 4 to channel 2 by the Federal Communications Commission as a side effect of channel shuffling in Wisconsin. The KS2XBS station's transmitter was later donated to Chicago's first educational station, PBS member station WTTW (channel 11). In 1954, Zenith resumed testing in the eastern United States (on WOR-TV in New York City, now WWOR-TV and licensed to nearby Secaucus, New Jersey) and later negotiated foreign contracts in Australia and New Zealand. It also broadcast for a short time in Connecticut. In spite of its failure to gain national success, a significant amount of publicity and advertising for Phonevision was created for a short time. The Phonevision system was operational on station WHCT in Hartford, Connecticut, for at least five years, ending early in 1968. The station would run conventional (non-subscription) entertainment programming during the day as an \\"independent\\" and then switch to Phonevision- encoded programming in the evening.  Phonevision concept  The concept behind Phonevision involved making Hollywood films available to home viewers at $1 per movie (equivalent to $/movie after inflation). Viewers were required to purchase a descrambler unit that sat on top of the television, plugged into the TV's antenna leads and also into the telephone line. Someone wishing to view a movie would call the Phonevision operator, who would add them to the viewer queue. A signal sent via phone lines would allow the box to descramble the signal and at the end of the month, viewers would be billed for the movie on their regular telephone bill. Some of Zenith's 1951 model TV sets were equipped with a special connector for Phonevision, and included a section in the owner's manual explaining the Phonevision concept, providing instructions on how to order, and a schedule for film broadcasts.Zenith Owner's Manual, 1951 The Theatre Owners of America called the service a monumental flop. However, according to then Zenith president Eugene F. McDonald, the service was a roaring success.\\"Report on Phonevision\\" Time June 4, 1951 Even though the three films initially available to the first 300 test households were more than two years old, only about 18 percent of Phonevision viewers had seen them at the movies, and 92 percent of Phonevision households reported that they would prefer to see films at home.  Technical information  The system operated by switching a delay line in and out of the video, which chopped the picture into slats (like looking through an open venetian blind). Half of the slats would be shifted to the right by a significant amount. Decoding reversed the process and slid the other slats over the same amount, realigning the picture. The video information was also reversed in phase, exchanging black and white. The audio was processed by \\"frequency inversion scrambling\\", shifting the audio spectrum up 2.625 kHz in frequency. This produced audio that sounded much like single sideband radio except that only high frequencies were present. Decoding of the audio was done by a dual-conversion processor. The audio was first shifted up 31.5 kHz, and then shifted down 34.125 kHz, producing a net \\"downshift\\" of 2.625 kHz. 31.5 was double the horizontal sweep frequency of 15.750 kHz, and 34.125 kHz was 13/6 ths of 15.750, giving a convenient frequency reference. The frequency tolerance was so tight that if encoded audio were recorded during a Phonevision broadcast, and then played back later into a homemade processor running on normal network programming, a slight frequency error could be detected in the restored audio. Also, when the station switched to local sync to run a local commercial, the frequency change could be heard. One of the major limitations of the Phonevision system was that due to the delay line being switched in and out, color could not be broadcast, as the 3.58 MHz phase lock necessary for NTSC color broadcasting could not be held. This limitation contributed to the demise of the system, along with the FCC authorization of subscription programming in 1969.

Starting from 492, Doulun's cruelty and losses in battles made nobles to grow distressful. They persuaded Nagai to be the khagan. Nagai initually refused and said that Doulun was a legal khagan until death. This was a signal for nobles who killed Doulun and his mother in a coup d'√©tat, brought their corpses to Nagai, subsequently proclaiming him khagan.

A capulana (also spelled \\"kapulana\\", or in Changana \\"nguvu\\" or \\"vemba\\") is a type of a sarong worn primarily in Mozambique but also in other areas of south-eastern Africa. It is a length of material about 2 metres by 1 metre. It can either be used as a wrap-around skirt, dress or can become a baby carrier on the back. It is considered a complete piece of clothing. Capulanas have been in Mozambique since the establishment of the Arab/Indian trade routes. It was received from Indian traders as a means of trade for other goods. First, they came primarily in three colors: red, white, and black. White represented the protection of the ancestors, black represented evil, and red represented the spirit of war. After this time, Mozambicans preferred using capulanas to the traditionally- used animal skins. Due to Africa's wildlife and environment, the most common early designs included suns, leopards, lions, the style \\"ndjiti\\" (a white and red geometric design), the style \\"xithango\\" (plaid, with the word meaning \\"shield\\"), and the style \\"ximangelani\\" (wild birds spotted black and white). These styles were dominant until the advent of the Portuguese Colonial power. Today, these early styles of capulana are used primarily by \\"tinyanga\\" (witch doctors, spirit healers, \\"curandeiros\\"). \\"Palu\\", a style with very small plaid patterns in blue and white, was also popular in early years of the capulana. Today, there are many kinds of capulanas of various designs and colors. The capulana is often worn with a headscarf and tailored blouse in Mozambique. They are used in a variety of manners, including everyday casual-wear, carrying heavy loads, or even careful tailored for special events. Early traditional colors and styles of capulana are highly coveted and sell for higher prices in markets today. In Mozambique they have a high value and are considered particularly beautiful. Brightly colored, capulana are often offered as gifts to women. Some couples make matching capulana outfits for special events or for a significant reason such as a traditional marriage between the two.

It was the brainchild of Charles Jeantaud, a coachbuilder who built his first electric carriage in 1881. Among the vehicles he constructed was the first car to set a land speed record (, driven by Gaston de Chasseloup-Laubat), as well as coupes and hansom cabs; in these the driver sat high, and to the rear. Some cars had an unusual bevel-gear front-wheel-drive layout. From 1902 to 1904, Jeantaud offered a range of gas-engined cars similar to 1898 Panhards. The company ceased trading in 1906 following the suicide of its founder.(Archived copy) JEANTAUD (France) 1881/1893-1906 accessed 18 December 2018, Originally at www.vea.qc.ca/vea/marques/jeantaud.htm Specifications of record breaker Count Gaston de Chasseloup-Laubat on the Jeantaud Duc Profil√©e The 1899 Jeantaud Duc Profil√©e was powered by a 36 horsepower (26.8 kilowatts) electric engine. The car weighed around 1,400 kg and transmitted its power to the rear wheels through a chain-drive gearbox. The Profil√©e was designed to be more aerodynamic than its older brother, featuring pointy ends on both the front and back, which allowed it to break the record top speed of 49 mph of its less pointy rival the GCA Dogcart on 4 March 1899, achieving a speed of 57 mph. Its record, though, was quickly broken by the more famous La Jamais Contente, the first purpose-built land speed record car, which reached 65 mph on the same day.

Beginning with the simple sentence \\"A mouse sat under a tree\\", the book goes on to tell the story of a mouse who has to trick Weasel from turning Mouse into Mouse Soup. He does that by telling stories about Bees and the Mud, Two Large Stones, The Crickets, and The Thorn Bush, and tells Weasel to put them into his soup. It is then assumed that Mouse got away and Weasel got stung by bees.  Plot  A male mouse leaves his house to sit under a tree to read a book. While he reads, a weasel suddenly captures him. The weasel then takes the mouse back to his home, thinking of making Mouse Soup with the mouse. Just as the weasel puts the mouse into the pot, the rodent tells the crafty weasel that the soup will not taste good without any stories in it at all. The weasel does feel hungry, but agrees to let the mouse tell him four stories that will go in the pot. In the first story, a second male mouse is walking along when a bee nest falls on his head. He tries to reason with the bees to go away, but the bees like his head as their home. The mouse then comes up with a plan to go into a mud hole (making the bees think it's his home). As he goes deeper, the bees still like the mouse until they hate his bed (the rodent being submerged in the mud) and finally go away, allowing the mouse to go home to take a bath. In the second story, two large stones sit on a hill and wonder what's on the other side, as they can't move from the spot where they sit. When they ask a bird to check, the avian soon returns and tells them about buildings and cities on the other side. The thought of not being able to see those things makes the stones sad. A hundred years soon pass and when a third male mouse comes, the stones ask him to check the other side of the hill. The rodent soon tells them that it is the same as the side the stones reside on. This make the stones feel glad that they're not missing anything, but wonder whether the mammal or the bird was right. In the third story, a cricket gets the urge to sing a song in the middle of the night. But his singing disturbs a female mouse, who is trying to get some sleep. Each time the lady mouse demands not to have any more music, the cricket thinks she said she wants more music and so calls over a lot of friends. Soon, the crickets are making so much noise with their singing that the lady mouse simply shouts at them to go away, to which the cricket wonders why she didn't say so before. After the crickets go away, the mouse goes back to bed. In the fourth story, a male police mouse comes to the home of an old and female mouse because she is crying. She shows him a thorn bush that is growing out of her chair and explains she's crying because it's dying. Right away, the police mouse advises her to throw some water on the thorn bush, causing it to grow into a bunch of roses. To thank the police mouse, the old female mouse gives him both a kiss on the cheek and some of the roses as his payments. After finishing his stories, the mouse tells the weasel to bring in the things that were associated with the stories. The weasel leaves his house, without closing the door on the way out, allowing the mouse to escape and follow the weasel at a distance. The rodent then witnesses the predator suffering for his fool's errand. After getting stung by bees, gathering up wet sticky mud, struggling with two heavy stones, jumping to catch crickets, and getting pricked by a thorn bush, the weasel thinks he'll have a tasty soup. Upon arriving home, the weasel, seeing the empty pot, realizes he has been tricked. The mouse, at this time, hurries back to his own house and, after having some dinner, finishes reading his book. Audio recording In 1978, Scholastic Records issued a 7-inch 33 r.p.m. record (SCC 2807) of the author reading the story. It was directed by Bernice Chardiet, produced by Robert Mack, and contained music by Albert Hague. Stop motion film In 1992, the book was made into a 26-minute musical stop motion animated film by Churchill Films, directed by John Clark Matthews and starring Buddy Hackett as the voice of Mouse.

Stewart, in Carterville, Missouri. In October 1931, the station was apparently sold to Paul L. Carriger, and moved to Shreveport. The next month the frequency was changed to 1594 kHz, and a number of shortwave frequencies were authorized. The call sign was changed to W5XA. The station officially went on the air on January 11, 1932 with both audio and video transmissions. The audio was transmitted on 1594 kHz and the video on the 160 meter amateur radio band. Newspaper accounts, and the recollection of W. E. Antony, a radio pioneer who was involved in the station, say that TV broadcasting started in 1929. The equipment shown below dates from 1932, so another camera must have been used, probably a home made one. The call-sign for the television station was listed in newspapers as W9XX, however, it is likely that the confusion came from a photo of a station a microphone, purchased as part of the station in Carterville, with W9XX on it. Paul L. Carriger gave up on TV in 1934 as money and interest had become scarce during The Great Depression. The station broadcast with 45 horizontal scanning lines, and 15 frames per second.

Seventy (70) ships were built between 1949 and 1953. The Soviet designation was Project 30bis. Design The ships were derived from the Project 30 , but were slightly larger with better sea-keeping and significantly increased endurance. These ships were longitudinally framed and completely welded. The ships were built in 101 modular pre-fabricated sections which led to rapid building times. The machinery and main armament was essentially identical to those of the Ognevoy class destroyers but the boilers employed forced draught for increased power. Modernisation The ships were modernised in the 1950s with new anti-aircraft guns and anti-submarine mortars and updated sensors (new radar and sonar). One bank of torpedo tubes were removed and extra accommodation (deckhouses) added. Ships 70 ships were built for both the Soviet navy and for export, this is the largest production run for any large Soviet surface warship.

Sometimes these samples have been used by agencies to sell products that they will distribute to local vendors. Sample sales are often associated with the fashion industry. These sales are an opportunity to get near perfect merchandise at a fraction of the price. It is often difficult to have information on the date and time of sample sales, although there are websites which list information about sample sales. They are also used to draw in new clients, hoping that the new people will return to the company's store and buy more merchandise. In the past, sample sales were a way for retailers to sell their items which were used in advanced showings, fashion shows, and presentations for interested buyers. These samples were often very limited in sizes and quantities due to the purpose the items served, but present day sample sales are often much larger in both sizes and selection. Some of the items sold at sample sales are from previous seasons, overstocked items, returned, or were never sold in stores. Sample sales are particularly popular in the bridal industry. Bridal salons typically carry two collections per year, and so often offer their in-store sample dresses at a discount in order to make room for new bridal gowns. While bridal sample sales are most common in early summer and late fall, some stores sell sample merchandise throughout the year and even online. Sample sale websites are a new trend expanding upon the popular brick-and-mortar (B&M;) sample sales that often occur in New York, Los Angeles, and other prominent locations. Sample sale sites are usually invite-only websites that receive the opportunity to sell certain products from top labels in the fashion industry (often these items are from previous seasons, but just as often they are current products) at a heavily discounted rate. Each sample sale tends to run for about 24 to 48 hours, or until sold out; since inventory is often limited and some sites are extremely popular, some items on some sites will sell out in a matter of minutes or even seconds. Sometimes these sites place their orders for the number of products they would like ahead of time, sometimes they place their orders after receiving the customers' orders (in the latter case, shipping to you will take longer). The popularity of these sites has exploded in recent months such that many of the sites have expanded beyond fashion labels to household items, wines, and even travel. Comparatively speaking, the prices and selection are typically better than department store discount stores. Popular bridal resource websites have sample sale calendars that alert users to upcoming sales at local bridal salons and online dress merchants. Individual bridal salons are also beginning to feature their sample dresses online, with the option of purchasing in-store or through the website. Sample sales increased in popularity during the Great Recession because of the increasing economic challenges facing both the fashion industry and the consumer. Shoppers are advised to check their merchandise carefully before purchase, as sample sales are final.

The group has had a very fragmented history, due to a variety of reasons. Nonetheless they were an important act during the heyday of prog-rock in Argentina in the mid 1970s, and one of the few bands from that period that are active today.  History  The band spent its first two years in the tour circuit, their live performances achieving some notoriety by word-of-mouth. In 1975 they would release their first LP by the name of Cris√°lida. It was both critically and commercially acclaimed as one of the finest Argentine symphonic rock records of the year. It was a prog-rock album with echoes from Genesis and Yes. The band was at their pinnacle: good response from both fans and the press and spectacular live shows.Esp√≠ritu www.progarchives.com -Your Ultimate Prog Rock Resource After a line-up change where ex-Los Gatos Ciro Fogliatta replaced Gustavo Fedel at keyboards, Esp√≠ritu's second full-length Libre y Natural was released in 1976, at the peak of prog-rock production in Argentina. The stage presentation of the album at the Coliseo Theater was one of the highlights of that year in Argentine rock. However exhaustion between members would lead to the band's break-up by 1977.Esp√≠ritu www.rock.com.ar (Spanish) The band briefly reunited in 1982 during the very short lived prog-rock revival in Argentina, and quickly ended up recording Esp√≠ritu III. The album was more focus on jazz-rock, but it also showed new-wave tendencies that were removed from progressive. Whether it was a conscious effort to make the album more commerciable is unclear, but it still sold poorly in spite of being a solid record. By then Argentine rock was moving full ahead into the \\"New Democracy Sound\\" that would become the foundation of the 80s Argentine rock international explosion. Amazingly, Esp√≠ritu would return in 2002 and recorded a new studio album, Fronteras M√°gicas. It was well received by the prog-rock community.

Annamacharya, who was also patroned by Saluva Narasingaraya wrote hundreds of kritanas in praise of Lord Venkateswara of Tirupati.,Annamayya, a popular Carnatic music composer that became popular Telugu prayer songs. His wife and the first known Telugu poet, Tallapalka Timmakka wrote Subhadra Parinaya.

Late Vijayanagar During the reign of Krishnadevaraya Telugu culture and literature flourished and reached their heyday. The great emperor was himself a celebrated poet having composed Amuktamalyada. In his court, eight Telugu poets were regarded as the eight pillars of the literary assembly. In the olden days, it was believed that eight elephants were holding the earth in eight different directions. The title Ashtadiggajas celebrates this belief and hence the court was also called Bhuvana Vijayam (Conquest of the World). The period of the Empire is known as \\"Prabandha Period,\\" because of the quality of the prabandha literature produced during this time. Among these eight poets, Allasani Peddana is considered to be the greatest and is given the title of Andhra Kavita Pitamaha (the father of Telugu poetry). Svarocisha Sambhava or Manucharita is his popular prabandha work and was dedicated to Krishnadevaraya. Nandi Thimmana wrote Parijathapaharanam. Madayyagari Mallana wrote Rajasekhara Charitramu. Dhurjati wrote Kalahasti Mahatyamu and Ayyalaraju Ramabhadrudu wrote Sakalakatha Sangraha and Ramaabhyudayamu. Pingali Surana wrote Raghava Pandaviyamu, Kalapurnodayam, Prabhavate Pradyamana. Raghavapandaveeyamu is a dual work with double meaning built into the text, describing both the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. Kalapurnodayam(means full bloom of art) has been treated as the first original poetic novel in Telugu literature. Battumurthy alias Ramarajabhushanudu wrote Kavyalankarasangrahamu, Vasucharitra, Narasabhupaliyam and Harischandranalopakhyanamu. Among these works the last one is a dual work which tells simultaneously the story of King Harishchandra and Nala and Damayanti. Tenali Ramakrishna first wrote Udbhataradhya Charitramu, a Shaivite work. However, he converted to Vaishnavism later and wrote Vaishnava devotional texts Panduranga Mahatmyamu, and Ghatikachala Mahatmyamu. Tenali Rama remains one of the most popular folk figures in India today, a quick-witted courtier ready even to outwit the all-powerful emperor. Other well-known poets were Sankusala Nrisimha Kavi, who wrote KavikarnaRasayana, Chintalapudi Ellaya, who wrote Radhamadhavavilasa and Vishnumayavilasa, Molla, a poet wrote a version of Ramayana, Kamsali Rudraya wrote Nirankusopakhyana, and Addanki Gangadhara wrote Basavapurana.

She is a figure on the academic side of the electronic music genre, connected with the conservatory and the university (like her older contemporary Karlheinz Stockhausen), rather than the more popular expression of the genre that followed upon the widespread availability of synthesizers and personal computers in the 1970s and after. Her writing covers a range of topics related to musical composition and has been the subject of studies by other scholars.  Biography  Born in Bamberg, West Germany of Ukrainian heritage, Semegen pursued an academic career in music, earning her MA from Yale University in 1971; she has studied at the Eastman School of Music and the Rochester Institute of Technology. She taught at the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center (1971-75). She studied composition under B√ºlent Arel and Alexander Goehr, and in turn has taught other composers, including Joseph DiPonio, Daniel Koontz, Gilda Lyons and Philip Schuessler.  Career  In a distinguished academic career in a field still heavily dominated by men, Semegen has received six grants from the National Endowment for the Arts; has been selected as a Fulbright fellow; and has been awarded fellowships at the MacDowell Colony, Tanglewood, the Chautauqua Institution, and Yaddo -- among a range of other awards and distinctions. She is currently associate professor of composition, theory, and electronic music composition at Stony Brook University, and is director of its Electronic Music Studio. Her best-known piece is probably Electronic Composition No. 1 (1971). Her work Arabesque premiered in 1992.

A private collection is a privately owned collection of works (usually artworks). In a museum or art- gallery context, the term signifies that a certain work is not owned by that institution, but is on loan from an individual or organization, either for temporary exhibition or for the long term. This source is usually an art collector, although it could also be a school, church, bank, or some other company or organization. By contrast, collectors of books, even if they collect for aesthetic reasons (fine bookbindings or illuminated manuscripts for example), are called bibliophiles, and their collections are typically referred to as libraries. History This corner of a cabinet of curiosities, painted by Frans II Francken in 1636, reveals the range of connoisseurship a Baroque-era virtuoso might evince. Art collecting was common among the wealthy in the Ancient World in both Europe and East Asia, and in the Middle Ages, but developed in its modern form during the Renaissance and continues to the present day. The Royal collections of most countries were originally the grandest of private collections but are now mostly in public ownership. However the British Royal Collection remains under the care of the Crown, though distinguished from the private property of the British Royal Family. The cabinet of curiosities was an important mixed form of collection, including art and what we would now call natural history or scientific collections. These were formed by royalty but smaller ones also by merchants and scholars. The tastes and habits of collectors have played a very important part in determining what art was produced, providing the demand that artists supply. Many types of objects, such as medals, engravings, small plaquettes, modern engraved gems and bronze statuettes were essentially made for the collector's market. By the 18th century all homes of the well-to-do were expected to contain a selection of objects, from paintings to porcelain, that could form part of an art collection, and the collections of those who would normally qualify for the term had to be considerably larger, and some were enormous. Increasingly collectors tended to specialize in one or two types of work, although some, like George Salting (1835-1909), still had a very wide scope for their collections. Apart from antiquities, which were regarded as perhaps the highest form of collecting from the Renaissance until relatively recently, and also books, paintings and prints from the late 15th century onwards, until the 18th century collectors tended to collect fairly new works from Europe. The extension of serious collecting to art from all periods and places was an essentially 19th-century development, or at least dating to the Age of Enlightenment. Trecento paintings were little appreciated until about the 1830s, and Chinese ritual bronzes and jades until perhaps the 1920s. Collecting of African art was rare until after World War II. In recognition of its importance in influencing the production of new art and the preservation of old art, art collecting has been an area of considerable academic research in recent decades, having been somewhat neglected previously. Famous art collections Very famous collections that are now dispersed include the Borghese Collection and Farnese collection in Rome, and the Orleans Collection in Paris, mostly sold in London. When this happens, it can be a large loss to those interested in art as the initial vision of the collector is lost. The Princely Family of Liechtenstein have works by such artists as Hals, Raphael, Rembrandt and Van Dyck, a collection containing some 1,600 works of art, but were unable to show them since 1945 when they were smuggled out of Nazi Germany. The works were finally displayed in the Liechtenstein Museum after nearly 60 years with most in storage. The important collection of the Thyssen family, mostly kept in the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum, which settled in Madrid in 1992, was bought by the Spanish state. Only an exhibited part, the collection of Carmen Cervera, widow of the late Baron Thyssen, remains private but exhibited separately in the museum. Many collections were left to the public in some form, and are now museums, or the nucleus of a museum's collection. Most museums are formed around one or more formerly private collection acquired as a whole. Major examples where few or no additions have been made include the Wallace Collection and Sir John Soane's Museum in London, the Frick Collection and Morgan Library in New York, The Phillips Collection in Washington DC, and the Museu Calouste Gulbenkian in Lisbon Portugal. Other collections remain complete but are merged into larger collections in museums. Some important 19th/20th examples are: *The Waddesdon Bequest of Renaissance objects was bequeathed to the British Museum, where it is displayed in its own room (a condition of the bequest), as is the Percival David Collection of Chinese porcelain. Many other bequests or purchased collections are split up within the museum's collection. *Sergei Shchukin, was an important Russian art collector, mainly of French Impressionist and Post- Impressionist art. His collection is now divided between the Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts in Moscow and the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg. *The Charles Lang Freer Collection became an important part of The Smithsonian‚Äîthe Freer Gallery of Art. *When the banker Robert Lehman died in 1969, his foundation donated 2,600 works of art to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Housed in the \\"Robert Lehman Wing,\\" the museum refers to the collection as \\"one of the most extraordinary private art collections ever assembled in the United States\\".Metropolitan Museum of Art press release, September 1999 To emphasize the personal nature of the Robert Lehman Collection, the Met housed the collection in a special set of galleries which evoked the interior of Lehman's richly decorated townhouse; this intentional separation of the Collection as a \\"museum within the museum\\" met with mixed criticism and approval at the time, though the acquisition of the collection was seen as a coup for the Met.Thomas Hoving. Making the Mummies Dance. New York: Simon and Schuster, 1993. Unlike other departments at the Met, the Robert Lehman collection does not concentrate on a specific style or period of art; rather, it reflects Lehman's personal interests.

A hook grip provides the lifter with a more secure, tight grip and takes the pressure off muscles in the arm, hands and wrist, reducing the risk of injury. When used in the deadlift, the hook grip has a number of advantages. Traditionally, lifters tend to use a \\"mixed\\" grip when working with heavy loads on the deadlift; that is, one hand being supine and the other prone. This mixed grip creates an imbalance of the shoulders, with one shoulder being externally rotated and the other internally rotated. This difference in rotation between the shoulders can create imbalances in the muscles of the back over time. If the grip on the bar is not secure, it is going to be hard to lift the weights. To perform a hook grip one must first wrap their thumb around the bar and then wrap their index, middle, and ring finger around the outside of the thumb. The pinky finger typically ends up resting on the bar.  Advantages  * Bar stabilization: the lifter has a more symmetrical pull resulting in a more technically sound lift and more even muscle development. The athlete also has more control over the barbell roll. * Secure bar grip: with hook grip, athletes can rely less on grip tension and focus more on their strength and technique during their sessions and competitions. The hook grip is more secure than grips in which the thumb remains outside the other fingers, like the closed grip or the natural grip. During a snatch or clean, the lifter can exert forces up to 2-3 times the weight of the loaded barbell at rest, and the hook grip allows an athlete to maintain a grip on the bar during the phase of highest bar acceleration, the second pull. The hook grip does this by preventing the bar from rolling in the hands, whereas the bar would have a tendency to roll towards the fingertips in a normal overhand grip.http://www.docstoc.com/docs/29712579/BARBELL-ACCELERATION-ANALYSIS  Disadvantages  * Pain: the hook grip may cause pain, especially before the skin and fingers have developed calluses and gotten used to the new pressure they have to endure. * Skin tears: although there are some techniques to mitigate tears, it is still likely that the thumb skin will rip while acclimating to hook grip. * Difficult with small hands: if the thumb cannot reach around the barbell due to the barbell size, the hook grip will be difficult to use. The hook grip places a relatively large amount of pressure on the thumb. As a result, it may cause pain or injury to the skin or thumbnail, although this can be overcome by regular training and gradually working with heavier loads. It generally takes up to 2 weeks to grow accustomed to the hook grip. Many Olympic weightlifters tape their thumbs with athletic tape.  Pain reduction  The following techniques can reduce pain after lifting using the hook grip: * Submerging the hands in a bucket of water after each session for 5‚Äì10 minutes. * Wrapping elastic tape around the thumbs during training to reduce friction on the skin provides a more secure and less painful grip. Note that traditional athletic tape will hinder the grip's range of motion, so elastic tape is preferable.  Grip strengthening  The below tips can aide hook grip strength: * Reducing the use of lifting straps by only using them when necessary. * Performing slow pulling movements such as deadlifts or rows can help develop key muscles to improve performance during more complex movements. * Using hand grippers a couple of times per week and completing wrist strengthening/stretching exercises before training sessions. * To train thumb and finger positioning, the hook grip can be practiced using household items such as a broomstick, steering wheel, or bottleneck.

Early life Savage was born in Streamstown, Ballisodare, County Sligo on 12 October 1897. He was the youngest son of Michael Savage who was known locally as a Fenian activist and Bridget Savage; formerly Gildea. After leaving school he worked as an apprentice grocer in Sligo Town before committing himself to the fight for Irish Independence.  Military action  Savage moved to Dublin in 1915 and joined the Irish Volunteers. As a 18-year-old he took part in the 1916 Easter Rising in Dublin and fought at the Four Courts. He was captured by the British Army and imprisoned in Richmond Barracks. On 30 April 1916 he was deported to Knutsford Detention Barracks in Cheshire, England along with 200 other captured prisoners. Upon his release Savage returned to Dublin and re-engaged in paramilitary activity and became a Lieutenant in the 2nd Battalion of the Dublin Brigade. Within republican circles he was known as a shy, slim built, handsome Sligonian who was a popular and trusted especially amongst the likes of Dan Breen, Se√°n Treacy and Se√°n Hogan.

PB) p.85, p.90 - p.95, p.168  The Ashtown ambush  Planning by Breen On 19 December 1919, Savage and 10 fellow Volunteers including Mick McDonnell, Tom Kehoe, Se√°n Treacy, S√©umas Robinson, Se√°n Hogan, Paddy Daly (Leader), Vincent Byrne, Tom Kilcoyne, Joe Leonard and Dan Breen, met after planning to assassinate the then British Viceroy, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland and Supreme Commander of the British Army in Ireland, Lord French, as he returned from a private party which he had hosted the previous evening at his country residence in Frenchpark, County Roscommon.My Fight For Irish Freedom, Dan Breen, 1989. PB) It was not originally planned that Savage was to take an active part in the ambush, however, after a chance meeting with Breen and Hogan, Savage insisted that he join the ambushing force. Sean Hogan initially attempted to dissuade him, but relented and gave Savage an automatic pistol. The unit's intelligence operative had informed it that Lord French would be travelling in the second car of the armed convoy that comprised an outrider and three following cars, which would bring Lord French from Ashtown railway station to the Vice-Regal Lodge in Phoenix Park, Dublin. Events of the day On the day of the ambush, Savage attended work as usual and slipped away early in the morning to meet with the other men who were to take part in the attack who were gathered at Fleming's Pub in Drumcondra. They departed Drumcondra in small groups to avoid raising suspicion as they cycled through Phibsboro and up the Cabra Road, and then regrouped at Kelly's Public House (now called the Halfway House) in Ashtown. At approximately 11:40 a.m., as the train carrying Lord French pulled into the station, they left the pub and took up positions along the crossroads at Ashtown. The plan was for Martin Savage, Tom Kehoe and Dan Breen to push a hay-cart halfway across the road and then, after the out-rider and the first car had passed, they would push it the rest of the way across the road, thereby completely blocking the path of the remaining vehicles. They had been informed that Lord French was to be in the second car and this car they intended to attack with Mills Bombs and rifle fire. As they pushed the hay-cart across the road their plan was almost foiled as a member of the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) disturbed them, telling them to move on. One of them threw a grenade at him, although it didn't explode it struck the police officer on the head, knocking him unconscious. The police officer was then dragged from the road and the attack went ahead as planned.Wayne Sugg Lord French's car and the gun battle When the convoy appeared minutes later the attack commenced, forcing the target second car in the convoy to swerve off the road. However, unknown to the attackers Lord French was travelling in the first car, which managed to drive through the blockade. The occupants of the second car, part of Lord French's guard, returned fire. As the gun battle developed the third car of the convoy arrived on the other side of the cart, and its occupants began firing with rifles on the now exposed ambushing force. In the exchange of fire Breen was shot in the leg, and seconds later Savage fell mortally wounded after being hit by a bullet in the neck. He died in the arms of Breen and his last words to Breen were \\"I'm done, but carry on....\\". Tom Kehoe and the wounded Breen succeeded in carrying Savage's body from the road and back to Kelly‚Äôs Pub while the gun battle continued. Two Royal Irish Constabulary police officers and a driver were also wounded in the gun battle. At this point the British military, including some wounded, began to withdraw from the scene and continued on towards the Phoenix Park. Knowing British reinforcements would be on their way, the IRA unit itself dispersed to safe houses in the Dublin area. Breen was helped onto his bike by Paddy Daly who helped him to a safehouse in the Phibsboro' area, where he was medically treated to by the captain of the Dublin hurling team, Dr J.M. Ryan. The next morning, the Irish Independent published an article which described the attackers as \\"assassins\\" and included other such terms as \\"criminal folly\\", \\"outrage\\" and \\"murder.\\" Taking these terms as an insult to their dead comrade, it was decided to attack the newspaper's offices. On Sunday, at 9pm, between twenty and thirty IRA men under the direction of Peadar Clancy entered the offices of the Independent where they proceeded to wreck its machinery of production. Despite this, with the assistance of the other Dublin newspapers, the Independent was able to appear the next day, and the owners were awarded ¬£16,000 pounds in compensation. According to Breen in his memoir, neither the Independent, nor any other Dublin newspaper, ever dared refer to the IRA as 'murderers or assassins' again.Dan Breen, My Fight for Irish Freedom, [Talbot Press, 1924], 1989, .  Funeral  Savage's body was taken by British military and an inquest was held into his death. The inquest was attended by his brother and his employer William Kirk, who described the dead paramilitary as \\"a steady, sober and industrious young man, gentlemanly in manner and extremely courteous.\\" After the inquest, Savage's body was handed over to his relatives. His remains lay overnight at Broadstone Station before departing for Sligo where it was met at Collooney railway station by a large crowd.My Fight For Irish Freedom, Dan Breen, 1989.

Critically and popularly acclaimed, the band was considered to be the focal point of a 1980s renaissance in British jazz. It was the main launchpad for the careers of many future leading British jazz players including Django Bates, Iain Ballamy, Eddie Parker, Julian and Steve Arg√ºelles, Mark Lockheart, Steve Berry, Tim Whitehead, Ashley Slater. In 2015, the band reformed to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the band's formation, with concerts at the Cheltenham Jazz Festival, Brecon Jazz Festival and a sold out week at Ronnie Scott's. \\"The band‚Äôs individual brand of contemporary orchestration incorporates a welcome humour (often lacking in such weighty aggregations), drawing on a diversity of sources ‚Äì minimalism, spacey ECM- inspired balladry, funky blues, Latin, swing, even Carla Bley-like passages ‚Äì in all, a combination of cool precision and collective pandemonium, performed with a persuasive joie de vivre. The ‚Äô85 album Loose Tubes and the ‚Äô86 Loose Tubes Too (distributed by the London-based Import Music Service division of Polygram) combine into an excellent two-part catalogue of a wealth of inspiration.\\" The Illustrated Encyclopedia Of Jazz (1986) History Origins The band originated from a jazz workshop put together by the British jazz composer and educator Graham Collier in 1983. During the first few weeks of the workshop, keyboard player Django Bates and bass player Steve Berry began to introduce original music to the ensemble. Under the supervision of workshop administrator-turned-manager Colin Lazzerini, the ensemble chose the name Loose Tubes and played its first London gig in 1984. The band was notable for its size (averaging 21 players) and was run as a co-operative without a single clear leader. While Bates, Berry and trumpeter Chris Batchelor were responsible for a great deal of the music, there were also composing contributions from flute player Eddie Parker, trumpeters Dave DeFries and John Eacott, as well as trombonist John Harborne. During live concerts, trombonist Ashley Slater (later to become frontman of the pop group Freak Power) acted as the band's comp√®re and became renowned for his sarcastic wit. Style, impact and rise Loose Tubes' music was drawn from elements of the whole history of jazz as well as many other musical styles such as samba and hi-life. During its existence, the band was garlanded with critical praise. Time Out referred to them as \\"the most important band to appear on the British jazz scene\\" and hailed them as \\"the best instrumentalists of their generation.\\" The Guardian called them \\"the most impressive young orchestra to have emerged in London\\", while The Times claimed \\"it's hard to imagine anyone else anywhere producing anything as exciting as this in 1985.\\" Loose Tubes were voted the Best UK Band in 1989 by the readers of The Wire magazine. The band were iconoclastic, with a strong sense of fun, and made a sense of humour an important component of their music. This occasionally led to criticism.Interview with Adrian Reid in Inside British Jazz: Crossing Borders Of Nation, Race And Class by Hilary Moore, pp. 126-127. Success In 1987, Loose Tubes became the first jazz orchestra to play at the Proms, the BBC's annual classical music festival held at the Royal Albert Hall. They also collaborated with the Docklands Sinfonietta. Other high points included a UK tour for the Contemporary Music Network and a residency at Ronnie Scotts, at the end of which they marched out into the streets of Soho at 3 a.m. still playing, with the audience following. Loose Tubes released three albums between 1985 and 1989 ‚Äì Loose Tubes, Delightful Precipice and Open Letter. The last of these was produced by Teo Macero who commented \\"These guys are interested in real composition, real melodies, not just being super hip. I haven't seen a young band in the US that wants to do things like that.\\"Quoted on Django Bates homepage, accessed 19 September 2009 A live album, Loose Tubes: JazzbucheBerlin 87 was also released. In addition, the band set up their own Loose Tubes record label. The label released albums by the Human Chain duo (Bates and Steve Arg√ºelles), The Iains (a quartet led by Iain Ballamy), a quintet led by Tim Whitehead, a trio led by Steve Berry and a duo with Stan Sulzmann and John Taylor playing the music of Kenny Wheeler. Disbandment Loose Tubes disbanded in 1990, largely due to the difficulty in financially sustaining and organising such a large ensemble of musicians (a situation not helped by the contemporary economic crisis in the UK). The collective leadership of the band had also become unmanageable and it was time for many of the musicians to move onto more focussed individual careers. Saxophonist Iain Ballamy later reflected \\"It kind of reached the stage where the band had to change a lot ‚Äî and nobody could change it ‚Äî or it had to end so something new could come along. And that‚Äôs what happened.\\"\\"Converging Philosophies\\", interview with Iain Ballamy by Anil Prasad 7 July 1993 on Innerviews website In 2010, twenty years after the band had disbanded, Django Bates announced that he would be releasing a Loose Tubes live album called Dancing on Frith Street on his own label Lost Marble Recordings. The recordings were made at Ronnie Scotts during the band's last week of live activity in 1990. Dancing on Frith Street was released in September 2010.Dancing on Frith Street press release, July 2010 ‚Äì Lost Marble Recordings (press release hosted on Django Bates' website) Reunion In 2014, to celebrate their 30th anniversary Loose Tubes reformed for a series of concerts. A unanimous declaration the band laid down for this 30th Anniversary reunion was that, to be relevant in 2014, there had to be new music; they \\"definitely didn't want to be their own tribute band\\". To this end, BBC Radio 3 in association with Jazz on Three commissioned new works from Chris Batchelor, Django Bates. Steve Berry and Eddie Parker. These were premiered at Cheltenham International Jazz festival on Saturday 3 May 2014, alongside Loose Tubes‚Äô classic repertoire from the 1980s, including Yellow Hill, Shelley, The Last Word, Sticklebacks and Sunny. The band followed this with a sell-out headlining week at Ronnie Scotts Club the band's spiritual home. They also played Brecon international Jazz festival on 8 August 2014 and Gateshead International Jazz Festival on 12 April 2015. On 10 June 2015, Loose Tubes won the Jazz FM Award for Best Live Experience for last year's reunion concert at Cheltenham Jazz Festival, beating two other worthy nominees, The Blue Note 75th Birthday at EFG London Jazz Festival and Jamie Cullum at the Love Supreme Jazz Festival. The winner of this category was chosen by public vote.  2014 line up  Flutes: Eddie Parker, Clarinets: Dai Pritchard Alto Soprano saxophones: Steve Buckley & Iain Ballamy Tenor Saxophone: Mark Lockheart & Julian Nicholas Baritone: Julian Arg√ºelles, Trumpets: Lance Kelly, Noel Langley, Chris Batchelor & John Eacott Trombones: Paul Taylor, John Harborne, Ashley Slater & Richard Pywell, Bass Trombone: Richard Henry, Tuba: Dave Powell, Keyboards:Django Bates, Guitar: John Parricelli, Bass: Steve Watts, Drums: Martin France, Percussion: Louise Petersen Matjeka Legacy The legacy of Loose Tubes continues strongly both through its former members, who continue to be leading lights of the UK music scene, and also its inspirational effect on younger musicians. F-IRE Collective founder Barak Schmool, who worked as a roadie for Loose Tubes, cites Loose Tubes as a formative influence. In 1991, Django Bates formed his large ensemble Delightful Precipice which includes many musicians from Loose Tubes and is in certain respects a continuation of their work (albeit one with a single leader).

His older half sister was Ethel May Fox, a music teacher, born in Michigan to Charles Aldrich Fox and Katie Eldridge. He was educated at Ohio State University, where he participated in theatrical productions.  Career  Foxe left for New York City as a young man and became a stage actor, working for two years as the Garrick Stock Company's leading man. He performed on stage with Douglas Fairbanks before going into films. Foxe was a cousin of the stage actor Robert T. Haines. On Broadway, he performed in Princess Virtue (1921), Come Seven (1920), and Dancing Around (1915). He appeared in some films in New York City and lived at the Lambs Club in the early 1920s at 130 West 44th Street in New York City but moved to California in 1922 and signed a contract with Fox Film Corporation. Foxe acted in 148 films between 1912 and 1946.  Personal life and death  Foxe married Gladys Borum in 1923 and later legally adopted her son Chester E. Foxe.

History The early artificial insemination organizations were largely farmer-owned cooperatives. The first such cooperative in America was organized at Clinton, New Jersey, through efforts of Enos J. Perry, Extension Dairyman, New Brunswick, and began operations May 17, 1938. It began operations with 102 members and 1,050 cows enrolled. Using frozen semen for dairy cattle has been done since the 1950s. The oldest semen believed to be in existence was from a sire named Cottonade Emmet, who was a member of the American Breeders Service sire battery in 1952. Semen was collected on Emmet in November 1952 and has been used several times to produce offspring. However, the last time any such offspring was born was in the mid-1980s. Osborndale Ivanhoe, who was probably the most famous Holstein bull of the early semen era, died in November 1963. From time to time calves will still be born from his frozen semen. Ivanhoe was a member of The Atlantic Breeder's Co-op Sire battery. His sons who have had considerable influence include, Penstate Ivanhoe Star, Provin Mtn Ivanhoe Jewel, and Fleetridge Monitor. His grandsons who have dominated the Holstein breed include Carlin-M Ivanhoe Bell, and Round Oak Rag Apple Elevation. Types of semen packaging Semen in the early days of artificial insemination was delivered everyday to technicians by bull studs as semen was not frozen at this point. It was not until the addition of glycerol to semen extenders that semen could be frozen. In those early days semen was extended by bulls stud into a type of bottle, or test tube, kept at low temperatures, and delivered to technicians usually everyday. The freezing process was discovered by a man named Polge. It was placed in containers called glass ampules, sealed, frozen in dry ice and alcohol and kept in that type of solution until it was needed for insemination. Later the liquid nitrogen refrigerator was invented by Union Carbide with money given to them by John Rockefeller Prentice, who used it exclusively for his bull stud before a number of years later giving it to the entire artificial insemination (A.I.) industry at no charge or royalty. Liquid nitrogen boils at ‚àí195.79 ¬∞C (77 K; ‚àí320 ¬∞F), which allows very little deterioration of bovine semen. The ampules were fastened to a cane which was placed inside the canister. The process of insemination involves transferring the ampule to a water/ice bath. The ampule thaws for several minutes and when opened, the semen is drawn up into a pipette. Other semen packages that have been tried include the \\"Magic Wand\\" developed by Badger Breeders Co-op in the mid-1960s. This was a frozen pipette that contained about .75 cc of extended semen. With the use of a connector and adapter which had a syringe or rubber bulb attached it was air thawed or thawed in the cow. The frozen polybulb was another semen package that had some usage. Semen was actually placed in a plastic polybulb and frozen on canes. The polybulb was thawed, sealed end cut, and attached to a pipette. The semen expelled through the pipette. There were several size of ampules used during the early days. The 1cc ampules were used by Curtiss Breeding Service, .75cc ampules were used by Tri-State Breeders Co- op, and the .50cc ampules were almost excursively used by American Breeders Service. The .75 and 1cc ampules were usually attached six to a metal cane. The .50 cc ampules were attached eight per cane. Plastic straw packaging In the 1960s a straw package that utilized a plastic straw was invented by the Robert Cassou family business called IMV in France. This straw was made of PVC and had two cotton plugs with powder in between them (the \\"factory end\\") while the other end was open. Semen was sucked up into the straw and was placed directly onto a comb and semen was expelled to make an airspace. Then the straw was placed directly into a pile of PVC powder that sealed the straw. Then the straw was placed into a water bath for a period of time to plug the end sealed. Then dried with cloth towels and frozen on metal racks. After freezing the straws were placed in 95 ¬∞F water and thawed for 60 seconds before being placed into a stainless steel gun. A sheath was placed over the gun and locked into place by an o-ring. Then the cow was inseminated the usual way. In the early 1970s an automated machine was invented by IMV. This machine would seal the straws (ultrasonically) one by one. Then several years later a machine that would fill and seal straws three at a time came out. This greatly increased processing times for bull studs. In the mid-2000s a machine that would not only fill three straws at a time but also have the capability to print the desired information on the straw, became available. How semen is collected Bull semen can be collected by using an artificial vagina (AV), electro-ejaculator, or by manual massage. Preparation of the AV The most desired use is the AV. The AV is made up of a piece of heavy rubber hose about in diameter and up a or more (in some cases less) in length. A small screw cap attachment is fitted or drilled preferably in the middle of the housing. A piece of latex or silicone rubber (usually rough inside, but some cases smooth) then is put through the hose and pulled up at both ends. Another latex or silicone cone shaped attachment is placed on one end of the AV an held by a rubber band. On the end of the cone a glass or plastic centrifuge tube is attached usually 15ml size). Through the cap attachment water usually around 54¬∞C is filled until the AV is 1/2 full (temperature may vary from bull to bull). This water is between the inside rubber and the inside hose wall of the AV. A small amount of K-Y jelly or Vaseline is placed just inside on the unconed end and then it is smeared with a pipette or greasing stick. Finally in most cases and AV jacket is tied or attached onto the cone end to cover the cone and tube. This will help prevent cold shock to the semen by keeping the cone and tube warm. The collector then goes cautiously to the side of the bull when he is in mount, directs the bull's penis inside the AV by grabbing the sheath directly behind the extended penis (never touching the penis itself). The bull then ejaculates after his penis slides through the AV. The bull should be ejaculating through the AV into the cone of the AV so there is very little chance of temperature shock to the semen. After the bull has dismounted, the AV should be held in the upright position so the semen runs into the tube onto the end of the cone. Then the tube is detached and placed upright in a water bath of about 29-32¬∞C. Preparation of the bull In a commercially or Custom Stud a bull is generally brought to a collection area where there are gates or other protection areas set up. In most cases of Dairy Bulls the bull has a halter or rope inserted into his nose ring. This is so he can be led and his handler can be a safe distance away, yet have some control over the animal. In the collection area there usually is a stall or stanchion where a mount animal is tied in. A mount animal can be a steer, a cow, or even another bull. Some bulls can be rather aggressive and have no problems or issues mounting another animal. Others are rather passive and may show little or no interest in mounting. Different scenarios are used to try to entice him to mount. Such scenarios may include a different breed of steer, a different bull, or even a cow. Sometimes a bull may be wary of the individual who is approaching him to collect. In which cases a blindfold may have to be put over his eye in that side. The bull mounts and semen is able to be collected as the bull doesn't worry about what is going on. Collection on farm A number of bulls are not collected in commercial or stud setups. These bulls may not be good enough to enter active AI service. However the owner may only elect to use him a small amount in his own herd or perhaps a syndicate may want to control the amount of breedings or services to him. In this case the bull may be sent to a custom stud or be collected on farm. The owner may elect to only collect a few hundred to several thousand units (straws) on the bull. In most of the custom studs the semen can be stored and sent out to other breeders. In some cases where there is not a significant population of females in a particular breed, a bull may have a designated supply of semen collected and then be sent to slaughter. However, a bank or supply of his semen is kept in storage for many years, still breeding females for many years after he has departed. While many beef bulls are collected in stud, a good share are collected on farm or in custom studs. Many of the bulls will be used in the owners' herds during beef breeding season. However, they have the genetic merit to be used in many others as well. A beef bull may only be able to service 20 to 30 head via natural service during the breeding season. He will be able to service many more during the breeding season via artificial insemination. If he becomes hurt, disabled, or even dies, he can still sire hundreds or thousands of progeny.

It is about a soldier called Thomas \\"Tommo\\" Peaceful, who is looking back on his life from the trenches of World War I in France. Structurally, each chapter of the book brings the reader closer to the present until the story turns to present tense. The story especially underlines the senselessness of war and ineptitude of the commanding officer. Plot The tale is of a young man named Thomas Peaceful, who tells the story in account format from the past to the present day events of his experiences. His eldest brother, \\"Big Joe\\", has learning difficulties due to brain damage at birth, and is always looked out for by his younger brothers. The earlier part of the story tells of his life as a boy, before the Great War; the tale of his love for Molly ‚Äì a beautiful girl he had a lot of feelings for, whom he met on his first day at school and grew to love besottedly; and Charlie Peaceful, Tommo's brother who is older than him, but younger than Joe. Also early on in the story Tommo and his dad go woodcutting where a tree nearly falls on Tommo. However, Tommo‚Äôs dad saves him but sadly in the process gets killed by the tree. Tommo kept it a secret that he was the reason for his father's death. The trio had grown up together; their mischievous adventures included braving the beastly \\"Grandma Wolf\\" (the boys' great-aunt ‚Äì also referred to as the Wolfwoman), defying the Colonel and skinny-dipping, the latter leaving a large impression on Tommo. They had also seen an airplane together ‚Äì the first people in their village to do so. Charlie, Molly and later Tommo all find jobs on the estate or in the village. Charlie, being older than Tommo, had always protected and looked out for his younger brother. Also, he and Molly become closer as they are both older than Tommo, while Tommo begins to be left out. Later, it is revealed that Molly and Charlie were secretly having sex with each other and that Molly had become pregnant with Charlie's baby. She is thrown out of her house, and moves in with the Peacefuls. Tommo became extremely heartbroken after the couple rushed to get married a short time later in the village church before Tommo and Charlie were forced to go to France to fight in World War I. All through this time, Tommo recorded his feelings in the novel. The rest of the story describes the brothers' experiences of the war: their Sergeant \\"Horrible\\" Hanley, the near-misses during the battle on the front line, and Charlie's continued protection of Tommo. During a charge of the German lines, Charlie disobeys a direct order from Sergeant Hanley and stays with Tommo while he is injured on no- man's-land. As a result, Charlie is accused of cowardice and given a court- martial. The book's chapters count down to dawn when Charlie will be executed. At dawn, Charlie is marched before the firing squad, where he dies happily singing their favorite childhood song, \\"Oranges and Lemons\\". The story ends with Tommo preparing for the Battle of the Somme. In 2006, 306 British and Commonwealth soldiers who (like Charlie) were executed for offenses including cowardice, desertion, insubordination, and sleeping at their posts were pardoned. Play The book was adapted into a play of the same name by Simon Reade, first performed at the Bristol Old Vic in April 2004, and starred Alexander Campbell. Later the production enjoyed sell-out transfers to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and London's West End, and then toured the United Kingdom. Another production toured United Kingdom provincial repertory theatres in 2014. Concerts In 1986 the trio Coope, Boyes, and Simpson were commissioned to create a concert in Passchendaele church, with Flemish musicians. This was released as a live album entitled \\"We Are Here Because We're Here: Concert Party Passchendaele\\". Morpurgo met the trio in September 2000 at a conference on \\"Children's Literature In Peace and War\\". He was so impressed by their songs that he invited them to add music to \\"Some Desperate Glory\\", a set of readings of war poetry devised by Morpurgo and read by Jim Broadbent and others. Soon after this, they put together the material for a series of concerts called \\"Private Peaceful\\". The concerts consisted of readings by Morpurgo with songs and tunes by Coope, Boyes, and Simpson. They were performed in 2005 and 2006 at the Wembley Arena. Feature-length film A feature film version of Private Peaceful, directed by Pat O'Connor and narrated on the audiobooks by Peel P50, was released in October 2012.

Steptoe and Son in Murder at Oil Drum Lane is a play written by Ray Galton and John Antrobus that brought the Steptoe and Son saga to an end. It was first performed in 2005. The title of this play was inspired by the Swedish 1982 play Albert & Herbert: Mordet p√• Skolgatan 15 (meaning Albert & Harold : The Murder at Skolgatan 15) by Sten-√Öke Cederh√∂k, although in that play, the murder refers not to Albert but to their home in Haga, Gothenburg. Background Steptoe and Son had been a successful British sitcom in the 1960s and 1970s. Ray Galton had been one of the two writers of the original series, and he co-wrote this play. It brought an end to the Steptoe and Son saga, explaining the two protagonists' lives together and their deaths. Plot The year is 2005. Steptoe's old house is now the property of the National Trust. Harold Steptoe, now in his 70s, visits the place but gets shut in after closing time. Through his monologue, the audience discovers that he eventually killed his father by throwing a spear at him when he was sitting on the toilet. Since then, he has been living in secret in Rio de Janeiro. While pondering his old home, the ghost of his father, Albert, re- appears. Albert explains that he has been trapped in this house with the \\"poncy\\" National Trust man, and that the only thing that Albert needs to get into heaven is an apology from Harold. But Harold refuses to give it, because he blames Albert for ruining his life. Most of the story is told in flashback. Albert refused to let him go to school, forcing him into a life of no education. Albert forced Harold to take the blame for looting in the Blitz. Albert then stopped him going to the D-Day landings. Albert had locked him in a secret compartment throughout the war. When the war ends, Harold is arrested and sent to fight in the Malayas. When he returns, Albert continues to ruin his life. In an attempt to be rid of Albert forever, Harold plans to emigrate to New Zealand with his fianc√©e, Joyce. Albert ruins it by telling them that Joyce is secretly Harold's sister. Harold sets off for New Zealand but Albert gets him arrested by framing him as a thief. When Harold gets out of jail, Albert thwarts all his attempts to get a girlfriend. Harold is absolutely mad at Albert until he discovers that in all the junk he has a copy of the Gutenberg Bible, worth ¬£3 million. Harold is over the moon and runs off to celebrate. Albert is not so happy, realising that his simple life with Harold will be over. In the next scene, Harold returns home to find the Bible missing, and presumes his father has destroyed it. In a fit of rage he throws a spear at the toilet door. At that moment, Albert opens the door and is stabbed by the spear. The flashbacks end. Harold finds it in his heart to forgive Albert. It is then that he has a heart attack (due to finding the Bible was hidden for safe measures, not destroyed, yet over time it had been chewed and ripped) and becomes a ghost along with Albert. The next morning, his body is discovered, and Joyce, who has become a nun, asks for him to be buried next to his father, much to Harold's annoyance. Albert accidentally tells Harold that Joyce and he aren't really related. Harold is furious and in the argument they fly into the sky on their old wagon, pulled by their old horse Hercules, arguing over which one will go to Heaven.

Reign  He was firstborn son of Yujiul√º Futu and he succeeded his father when he was killed in a battle against Gaoche. This was when Gaochang king Qu Jia (È∫¥Âòâ) rebelled against Rouran and resubmitted to Gaoche. In the summer of 510 he sent the Wei court to the Buddhist monk Hong Xuan (Ê¥™ÂÆ£), who presented the Emperor Xuanwu with a statue inlaid with pearls. As an answer, Xuanwu decided to send general Ma Yishu (È¶¨Áæ©Ëàí) as an envoy in 514, however Xuanwu died soon after decision, therefore embassy was cancelled. This time Chounu switched sides and sent his envoy Qijin Bijian (‰øüÊñ§ÊØîÂª∫) to Liang Dynasty same year. In 516, he marched on Gaoche in order to avenge his father. This campaign was a success, Gaoche leader Mietu was arrested and in reprisal towed to death by a horse. Moved by his success, he immediately sent his envoys Qijin Bijian, Hexi Wuiliba and Gong Guli (ÈûèÈ°ßÁ§º) to neighboring Northern Wei and Liang with gifts. Another tribute composed of 700 slaves was sent to Wei court in 519.  Family life and death  Soon, Chounu began having problems in family life. His infant brother Zuhui disappeared from the headquarters and no one could find him. Khagan was very worried. The twenty-year-old shamaness Dauhun Diwan appeared, who announced that Zuhui was taken alive by spirits to heaven and can be returned. Khagan ordered a seven-day prayer service and, unexpectedly, Zuhui ran into his yurt and said that he had been living in heaven for a year. Chounu was happy and ordered Diwan to divorce her husband Fusheng (he was given 3,000 horses and bulls) and made her his wife. Soon Chounu fell in love with her and ceased to deal with management affairs. When Zuhui grew up, Dowager Khatun Hou Luling (‰æØÂëÇÈôµ) found out that the story of heaven was invented by Diwan, and Zuhui lived in her yurt for all these days. Chouni did not believe this and soon Divan persuaded him to execute Zuhui. While Dowager Khatun Houluilin ordered his servants to strangle Dawhun Diwan. Moreover, unexpectedly, the Gaoche attacked and defeated the Rourans. Chounu decided to return to the headquarters and execute the murderers of his wife, but on the orders of the his mother Chounu was executed by the princes as well, who put his younger brother Anagui on the throne in 520.

First featuring in the 2009 film Pok√©mon: Arceus and the Jewel of Life, Arceus is a mythical Pok√©mon which can first be obtained in the games Pok√©mon Diamond and Pearl. Within the lore of the Pok√©mon series, Arceus is the creator deity which created the games' universe. Following its release, Arceus was received relatively favorably, being voted the most favorite Pok√©mon in a poll of Japanese fans by The Pok√©mon Company. Design and characteristics Referred to as the \\"Alpha Pok√©mon\\" in the in-game Pok√©dex, Arceus is a largely white, quadrupedal creature with a black-toned underbelly. A prominent feature of the physical form is a round, wheel-like cross attached to its torso. The wheel is yellow in its default Normal-type form, but it changes color when Arceus is given special items which also change its type. In the lore of the Pok√©mon series, Arceus created the universe. The Pok√©mon has a \\"signature\\" move that is not learnable by other species called \\"Judgment\\". Arceus is a \\"mythical\\" Pok√©mon, one of four released in the fourth generation of the series. Appearances In video games Arceus was first obtainable in the game Pok√©mon Diamond and Pearl through distribution events by Nintendo. It also appeared as a statue, although not obtainable, in the spin-off game Pok√©mon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky. In Pok√©mon HeartGold and SoulSilver, transferring Arceus into the game allows a special event to be triggered in which the player visits an altar and Arceus generates a legendary Pok√©mon - either Dialga, Palkia and Giratina dependent on player choice - with the game showing real life photographs. Prior to the introduction of Mega Evolution in Pok√©mon X and Y, Arceus had the highest base stats of any Pok√©mon. Arceus is also featured in the spin-off Pok√©mon Conquest, being awakened after the player unites the region the game is set in - which is shaped like Arceus. Figures of Arceus were given out as pre-order bonuses in Japan for HeartGold and SoulSilver. Nintendo had held multiple official distributions for Arceus - which, being a Mythical Pok√©mon, is not obtainable through normal gameplay \\\\- including events in 2016 and 2018. Arceus also appeared in two entries of the Super Smash Bros. series. In For Wii U & For 3DS, Arceus featured as an obtainable trophy, and in Ultimate it was obtainable as a Spirit. Arceus is also summonable via the Master Ball and Pok√©ball items in both games, in which, upon being summoned, it will perform the move \\"Gravity\\", launching aerial opponents downward. In other media Arceus features as a main character in the 2009 movie Pok√©mon: Arceus and the Jewel of Life, where it was voiced by Tom Wayland (English) and Akihiro Miwa (Japanese). It also made an appearance in the 2015 movie Pok√©mon the Movie: Hoopa and the Clash of Ages. Reception In a 2010 Japanese fan survey conducted by The Pok√©mon Company before the release of Pok√©mon Black and White, Arceus placed first as \\"most favorite Pok√©mon\\", ahead of franchise mascot Pikachu which was fourth. Arceus placed second in a 2016 The Pok√©mon Company poll. In a separate poll conducted by IGN, Arceus placed as the sixty-first top, with IGN's staff commenting that Arceus was \\"kind of funny looking\\". Several writers noted the in-lore strangeness of obtaining Arceus, noting that it would be equivalent to \\"a kid catching a deity\\". Official Nintendo Magazines Chris Scullion ranked Arceus among the 10 best Pok√©mon due to its versatility, strength, and rarity that makes Arceus \\"potentially strong against any Pok√©mon\\". Destructoid's Jonathan Holmes called it a \\"bad cross between a Yu-Gi-Oh monster and the spirit of the forest from The Princess Mononoke\\".

It is primarily used for baseball, but also has a separate football field. The baseball side and football side of QU Stadium holds 2,500 people. The football side of the stadium (located beyond the right and right center field fence of the baseball field) only has bleachers on one side of the field. The stadium is surrounded by its original limestone wall built in 1938. History The stadium was built in 1938 as part of the WPA and originally owned by the City of Quincy. It is constructed of large limestone blocks and concrete. A \\"sister\\" facility of limestone and concrete was built near Quincy High School (which was then located at 13th & Maine). This sister facility was the practice field for Quincy High School athletic teams until a new high school was built at 30th & Maine. At that time, the building at 13th & Maine became Quincy Junior High School and the athletic fields continued to be used by QJHS athletic teams. In 1984, the city sold the stadium to Quincy College (later Quincy University), a local liberal-arts 4-year Roman Catholic college affiliated with the Order of Friars Minor (Franciscans). The name of the stadium was changed to QC stadium and then to QU stadium, after Quincy College changed its name to Quincy University. Baseball history The stadium has been home to the Quincy Gems of the Three-I League from 1946 to 1956. From 1960 to 1961 the Quincy Giants of the Midwest League (ML) played there. During the 1962 and 1963 seasons the Quincy Jets of the Midwest League, a New York Mets farm team, played their home games at the stadium and in 1964 another Quincy Gems team played at the stadium. From 1965 to 1973, the Quincy Cubs, a Chicago Cubs farm team, also of the Midwest League called Q Stadium home. The Quincy Rivermen of the Central Illinois Collegiate League (CICL) played at the stadium from 1974 to 1987. Since 1995, it has been the home of Quincy University Hawks baseball team. In 1996, the Quincy Gems of both the CICL and Prospect League have played at the stadium. Football history The stadium was originally used for football by Quincy Senior High School and Quincy Notre Dame High School as their home football field until a new stadium was completed in 1980 (Flinn Stadium). Both schools, as well as Quincy College (later Quincy University), used the baseball side of the stadium for football. After both high schools quit using the stadium for football, the Quincy YMCA Tackle Football League began using the football side for the 7th & 8th grade league. The YMCA also used the field for two youth flag football leagues ‚Äì a 2nd through 4th grade league, and a 5th & 6th grade league. The Quincy Family YMCA completed a field on its property, so the tackle football and flag football leagues moved to that field in 1984. In 1987, then Quincy College re- instated its football program after an over 30 year hiatus. The Hawks began using the football side of QC Stadium competing in NCAA Division III. The Hawks moved up to NCAA Division II during the 1990s. In 2010, the football team moved to Flinn Stadium, but moved back to QU Stadium in 2014 after a major renovation.

W6XAH was operated by Frank Schamblin, Leo Schamblin and Charles Schamblin of the Pioneer Mercantile Company, which also started the first radio station in Bakersfield in 1933, KPMC, operating on 1560 kHz. Lee de Forest was involved in the television station, and a nearly lifesize picture of him was on the wall at KPMC. The station made its first broadcast on January 6, 1932. According to Leo Schamblin's son (also named Leo), a receiver was installed in the showroom of the Pioneer Mercantile hardware store in Taft, California, about 40 miles away. People from the town came to watch the first transmission, which was of the Walt Disney cartoon Steamboat Willie. The following day, Leo received a phone call from Walt Disney, who inquired as to how the transmission went. Leo told him that everything went well, and Walt replied that he had been following the progress of W6XAH, but unfortunately Disney was going to file suit against the station for use of the cartoon. Leo was astounded, but Walt then told Leo that the damages that Disney would demand would be $25, and that Disney would send Leo a check for that amount. Walt explained that Disney had to protect its copyright position with the new medium of television. Apparently the station stopped broadcasting a regular schedule later that year, but continued to experiment with television until 1935. FCC records show the station licensed for the 2000‚Äì2100 kHz band in 1935. During 1932, the audio portion of the TV transmissions was apparently broadcast on 1550 kHz.

He is most known for being the founder, guitarist, and vocalist of the band Agalloch, and later Pillorian. He is also a designer who has created packaging and merchandise for several record labels and bands, including every project in which he has performed. From 2008 to 2018 he was the co-owner, creative director, and curator of the D√§mmerung Arthouse. Early life John Haughm was born in Ellensburg, Washington, and grew up in Montana. He played in several metal bands as a teenager, some of which were with future Agalloch bassist Jason Walton. Career Agalloch and Sculptured (1996 - 2016) Haughm and Walton moved to Portland where they met Don Anderson, guitarist of Sculptured, and found that they had \\"tremendously similar taste in music and cinema\\". Haughm helped found Agalloch in January 1996, and had a brief stint in Sculptured, performing as the drummer on Apollo Ends. Pillorian (2016 - 2019) After Agalloch split in 2016, Haughm formed Pillorian with Stephen Parker and Trevor Matthews. This band was much more aggressive musically and more active as a touring act than Agalloch. They released Obsidian Arc in March 2017 and performed 100 shows in support of the album, including two American and two European tours between spring 2017 and summer 2018. Controversy In February 2019, Haughm was strongly criticized by his most recent former Agalloch bandmates, all three of whom are presently in the band Kh√¥rada, for posting a flippant comment on Facebook that was perceived as anti-Semitic. Both Parker and Matthews left Pillorian, leaving Haughm as the band's only remaining member. In his apology letter, Haughm stated that his own comment was \\"insensitive, juvenile, reprehensible, and thoughtless to say the least.\\" Haughm also signaled that Pillorian, despite having a 2nd album completely written and ready to record, was retired as a band. In January 2020, an interview with Don Anderson indicated that he and John had mended their friendship and that Haughm regretted making the comment. Post- Pillorian (2019 - present) Currently, Haughm is focused on solo and collaborative projects outside of the heavy metal genre.

It is written by Bezos and Andreas Morfonios and directed by Morfonios. The series aired 1996 and lasted two seasons. It is one of Bezos' most popular sitcoms. Title The title means \\"Those and me\\". \\"Those\\" refers to the women surrounding the series' main character, a hopeless womaniser. It was based on Costas Pretederis' earlier hit series Ekeines kai Ego (1996), and featured Lambros Konstantaras in the role of Lambros Donganos, Antonis Yakovakis as his friend Dimitris Marikos and Rena Voutsina as Debora. The original series was directed by Dimitris Nikolaidis. Pretederis was also the writer for the 1996 version. Main characters Zahos Donganos The protagonist of this series is Zahos Doganos (Yannis Bezos) a rich ladies' man whose interests revolve around women and partying hard. Although he has a fianc√©e, Eleni, this doesn't seem to affect his life. In fact in every episode he dates a different female who in most cases comes from his past. In a few episodes we see him with huge lists of the names of women he has dated in the past. He lives with his housekeeper Debora (an African girl) who is also his protegee. Zahos is completely against marriage, in contrast with some of the other main characters of the show. He co-owns the \\"Doganos-Marikos\\" corporations along with his friend and associate Dimitris Marikos. One of their best clients is Iason Papapetrou who gets tricked all the time by Zahos because of his affection for him. One of Zahos' most favorite places for entertainment is bouzoukia, where he goes with either ladies or his friends and relatives; actually in most episodes we see him sing too. Dimitris Marikos Marikos (Tasos Kostis) is Zaho's friend and associate. He is a workaholic. He always tries to advise Zahos, although Zahos never listens to him. He is often teased for his weight, either by Zahos or Lili (girlfriend of Petrakis, Zahos' nephew and a secretary at \\"Donganos- Marikos\\" corporations). In most episodes he appears to be single but often shows up with his girlfriend Mara. He always gets mad with Zahos, mostly because he never comes to the office, and generally about his way of life. However, it's obvious that sometimes he envies Zahos. Deborah Debora (Niki Sereti) (pronounced \\"Thevora\\") is Œñahos' housekeeper. She comes from Africa and like all the other characters she is teased a lot for her skin color. She lives with Zahos. Her main characteristic is that she pronounces all words and names wrong; for example she calls Zahos \\"Mr. Zahous\\", Eleni \\"Ilini,\\" and Papapetrou \\"Papatreha\\". Debora has a boyfriend, Ksenofon (she calls him \\"Ksifounon\\"), who appears in a few episodes but he doesn't like talking, so he almost never speaks. The writers tried to make fun out of that by showing him and Debora talking on the phone. Debora likes bouzoukia like Zahos and she listens to Sakis Rouvas and other Greek singers. She only knows how to make spinach pie (spanakopita; Greek: œÉœÄŒ±ŒΩŒ±Œ∫œåœÄŒπœÑŒ±) and she calls it \\"spakanopita\\" and everything else that can be made with spinach, something that often irritates Zahos. Eleni Eleni (Loukia Pistiola) is the long- time fianc√© of Zahos, who loves him very much although she knows about his womanizing past and present. Sometimes, though, she becomes outrageous with the most severe \\"adulteries\\" of Zahos. She has been working as a secretary in \\"Doganos-Marikos\\" corporation although it is mentioned in the Christmas special episode that she is financially strong and has a large dowry. In many cases she colalborates with dimitris, Lilly, Petros, Deborah and aunt Ortansia into tricking Zahos and playing severe jocks on him, related with the women of his life. Lilly Lilly (Valeria Kouroupi) is a young woman coming from a mother and a father that have been divorced and remarried several times each. She is irascible, audacious and can manipulate her fianc√© Petros and even dominate him in various ways, although in fact she is fragile and loves him very much. She is constantly in war with Zahos because she shows no respect to him and makes fun of his behavior as a womanizer and narcissus, something that causes Zahos's rage, irony and anger against her. Aunt Ortansia Triovoulou Ortansia (Nteniz Mpaltsavia in 1st season, Anna Paitatzi in the 2nd season) is the elderly sister of Zahos late mother. She tries to correct Zahos's behavior and is very fond of Eleni, working with her usually to help her reach wedding with Zachos. She has a phlegmatic and patient butler, Ioulios, who tolerates her old-styled and dominating behavior and seems to despise her, although in fact he is very careful of her. She has money and a comfortable income but she uses to hide her money for \\"future use\\" and lends money from Zahos all the time. Nevertheless, usually in her house there is a shortage of food for her butler who is forced to eat food sent to him by his relatives, having no other choice. In certain occasions she seems to have a light dementia and is very strict and steep with people she considers illiterate and non-gentle. Zachos always talks ironically and negatively about her behind her back, but never dares to doubt her commands or wills.

Description The male's plumage is dark grey above with black wingtips and a white rump. The underparts are pale grey, with a rufous streaked belly. The female's plumage is brown above, with a white rump, and cream coloured underneath, with a streaked belly similar to the males. The female is larger than the male with an average size of compared to the male's . The wingspan is .

Houghton Mifflin (2001), Habitat and Ecology This bird can be found in different open habitats, ranging from lowland marshes to the Andean Altiplano at a maximum altitude of 4000 meters (13123 ft). Like other harriers it nests on the ground. It is usually considered to be sedentary, and may migrate during April and May and returning to breeding grounds between September and October.Gould, J. and Darwin, C.R.

They endured hard physical labour, low wages and maltreatment by landowners. According to the Encyclopedia of Irish History and Culture, \\"(t)heir numbers were greatest during the difficult years of the 1820s and 1830s. On the whole, the seasonal workers were people who had close ties to the land: small farmers, cottiers, agricultural laborers, and generally poor people with family responsibilities and no means of earning a living at home. Women began to participate as workers to an important degree only in the middle of the nineteenth century, in the Scottish potato fields. Even before this, they provided support for the men by traveling with them; they begged for food and money to keep themselves and their children alive until the men returned home, and they undertook and organized essential farm work back in Ireland, thereby maintaining the small holding of land as the family home\\". The difficult life of the landless labourer found ample echo in the arts. An example in folk tradition of exactly how harsh life for a spailp√≠n was can be sensed in the song; \\"An Sp√°ilp√≠n F√°nach\\" a lament of a man who had to become a spailp√≠n because of his family's eviction. To avoid this terrible life, he joined the French army to fight overseas. Some spailp√≠n√≠ found comfort and catharsis in the arts. Several were reputed scholars, musicians and poets. To reflect the misery and hardship in their everyday lives, many of their songs and poems were laments. For an excellent example of such a lament, see Matt Cranitch, The Irish Fiddle Book, Ossian Pub, page 114 and recording number 47. Irish-language writer M√°irt√≠n √ì Cadhain's writing featured \\"dark ambiguities, seething resentments and petty humiliations\\" endured by spailp√≠n√≠.

Alien Contamination, Toxic Spawn or Larvae) is a 1980 science fiction-horror film directed by Luigi Cozzi and starring Ian McCulloch. The film is about an alien cyclops creature that uses human agents to place eggs all over Earth. The eggs release a gelatinous goo that causes people to explode when they come into physical contact with the substance. The tagline on the Italian one-sheet (\\"...e ora tocca a voi!\\") translates as \\"...and now it's your turn!\\".  Plot  A large ship drifts into New York Harbor, seemingly abandoned. The ship is discovered to be carrying large containers of coffee, hidden inside of which are a series of football-sized green eggs. The crew sent in to explore the ghost ship find the mutilated remains of the former crew gathered in one place, and they soon discover the reason why: when disturbed, the green eggs explode, spraying a viscous liquid over everything. The liquid is toxic to living creatures, and causes the body to immediately explode. The military's answer to this phenomenon is Colonel Stella Holmes (Marleau). She establishes a link between the green eggs and a recent mission to Mars that ended badly for the two astronauts who descended to the planet. One of them disappeared, and the other, Commander Hubbard (McCulloch), had a breakdown and subsequently became an alcoholic. When pressed, Hubbard agrees to help Holmes in her investigation of the insidious plot to bring the deadly eggs to Manhattan, and it takes them, along with sarcastic New York cop Tony Aris (Mas√©), to a Colombian coffee plantation. All is not as it seems; Hubbard's former astronaut colleague is apparently alive and well and living under the influence of a monstrous alien cyclops, which is using mind control to further its plot to flood the world with the green eggs and wipe out human life on Earth.

On seeing Ridley Scott's film Alien his producer decided he wanted Cozzi to make something similar. Due to budgetary constraints Cozzi decided to set the film on Earth, although retaining the ideas of the alien eggs and a large creature from Scott's film, and duly wrote a script called Alien Arrives on Earth. Producer Claudio Mancini wanted to use the name Contamination, which had been the working title for an aborted film he had been developing based on the Jane Fonda film The China Syndrome. The name was duly changed against Cozzi's wishes, with the producer also insisting on Cozzi developing more James Bond-style elements as opposed to his science fiction theme. The film's production offices were in the same building as those used by the makers of Zombi 2 and, impressed by the profits that film had made, Cozzi decided to try to hire the same cast members, although ultimately Ian McCulloch was the only actor to work on Contamination. Cozzi wanted to use Caroline Munro (who had been featured in Starcrash) as Colonel Holmes but once again the producer overruled him and hired Louise Marleau instead. Contamination was shot in eight weeks between 14 January and 4 March 1980. The film schedule included three weeks in Rome and then a further two weeks split between location shooting in New York City, Florida and Colombia. Cozzi had wanted to use animation or stop motion photography to realise the alien cyclops at the film's climax but was once again overruled by the producer, and an animatronic version was constructed instead. Cozzi subsequently claimed that this creature failed to work properly and would barely move, so he had to use rapid jump cuts to hide the fact that it was being pulled about by stagehands.  Release and controversy  Contamination was released in Germany on 9 May 1980, where it was distributed by Residenz- Film. After the Video Recordings Act, Contamination was classed as a video nasty. Specifically, the film includes graphic depictions of human bodies exploding violently in slow motion, as well as the grisly remains of such explosions. While the explosion effects are not technically graphic (each of the exploding victims is encased in some kind of bulky costume that is obviously hiding the mechanism that sprays the gore), they are extremely bloody. Years later, the BBFC classified the uncut version with a 15 certificate. It was released on home video in the United States under the titles Alien Contamination and Toxic Spawn, which are both heavily edited. Cozzi later revealed that Cannon Films, the film's North American distributor, had changed the name to Alien Contamination in order to capitalize on the popularity of Ridley Scott's Alien (1979). It is now available in the US in an unedited version which has been released on DVD. Arrow Video released the film uncut on Blu-Ray in 2015. The uncut version runs 95 minutes.  Critical reception  In a contemporary review, Variety referred to the film as a \\"routine tale\\" that was a poorly written horror film that did not hide its Italian origins with \\"silly English dialog\\" and \\"poor dubbing\\" being its giveaways. From retrospective reviews, Kim Newman (Monthly Film Bulletin) stated that the films combination of \\"splattery violence\\", \\"James Bond spy thriller\\", and \\"monster-filled s-f\\" was \\"at times uneasy, but Cozzi carries it off with sufficient bravura to paper over the cracks\\" and that \\"If the film relies on familiar images...it at least has a class, very loud score by Dario Argento's usual collaborators, The Goblins, to punch up the frissons.\\" Mike Long (DVD Talk) stated that Contamination \\"makes good use of the ideas that it's stolen, at heart it is simply another boring Euro-horror film.\\" In a 2010 interview with Fangoria, Cozzi revealed that the film was made as a ripoff of Alien, going so far as to say, \\"Without the existence of Alien, we could not have made this movie at all\\" and that the original title for the film had been Contamination: The Alien Arrives on Earth.

Debmar signed a deal with CBS to distribute a handful of films and specials, such as My Fair Lady, Gunsmoke telefilms, the first two feature length Peanuts films (A Boy Named Charlie Brown and Snoopy, Come Home) and some Dr. Seuss/DFE animated specials.

If those 10 episodes achieve acceptable ratings, the show would be renewed for an additional 90 episodes. This allows the show to have a profitable life in off-network syndication, in which 100 episodes is considered the desired number for a show to begin entering daily reruns. This unique broadcast syndication model for television was used with the TBS and OWN cable television networks for multiple sitcoms created by the multihyphenate Tyler Perry, and for multiple series with the FX cable television network, featuring the likes of actors Charlie Sheen (Anger Management), Kelsey Grammer and Martin Lawrence (Partners), and George Lopez (Saint George). The model eventually broke down, with Saint George and Partners failing to reach the threshold for a 90-episode renewal (along with Comedy Central's 2010 series Big Lake, a co-production with Lionsgate and Funny or Die), and Anger Management quietly being de-emphasized by FX after middling scripts that went against that network's 'premium' image and accompanying low ratings, and actress Selma Blair accusing Lionsgate of maintaining a hostile workplace and departing the series. The series also performed poorly in its later run in broadcast syndication. The rise of streaming video providers such as Netflix, Hulu and Prime Video and their minimum quality standards also made the 10/90 model untenable in the long run. Tyler Perry also departed Lionsgate in 2011 for more creative freedom on his own in other arrangements with OWN and BET.

O. J. Matthijs Jolles, translator. of Carl von Clausewitz's magnum opus, On War. Jolles himself is a bit obscure to students of military affairs, largely because his translation of On War was his only published effort in that field. Even his nationality has been misidentified‚Äîhe has been variously identified as Hungarian, Czech, and Dutch. Military historian Jay Luvaas once quoted an unidentified Israeli professor as saying \\"whereas the first English translation was by an Englishman who did not know German, the 1943 American translation was by a Hungarian who did not know English.\\" There is little in the Jolles translation to warrant such a comment. In the field of German literature, Jolles is quite well known, especially for his work on Friedrich Schiller. Most of his published work, however, is in German. Life Born in Berlin of a Dutch father and German mother, Jolles was brought up as a German and educated at the Universities of Leipzig, Hamburg, and Heidelberg. He received his doctorate in the philosophy of literature from Heidelberg in 1933. He then served one year as a volunteer in the horse artillery. Although he was not Jewish, his anti-Nazi politics got him into trouble. In 1934 he emigrated to France, where he studied at the Sorbonne. The following year he emigrated to Wales, where he taught German. Offered a teaching position at the University of Chicago, he entered the United States with his new British wife in 1938. He became a professor of German language and literature, obtaining American citizenship in 1945. Leaving Chicago in 1962, he spent the remainder of his life at Cornell. University of Chicago Even before the United States entered the war, the University of Chicago had begun casting about for ways to assist the war effort. These efforts grew out of both patriotism and self-interest: the university's leaders were concerned that unless they established Chicago as a center of military learning and research, the university's considerable assets (particularly in cartography and linguistics) might be hauled off in army trucks, \\"to be returned torn and soiled, if at all.\\" (31) Courses in preinduction military training began as early as September 1940. A formal Institute of Military Studies was created in April 1941. Since Jolles taught military German and German military organization, and On War was considered to be a key to German military behavior, he seemed to be the natural man for the job even though he was not familiar with Clausewitz when he set out. His British father-in-law (a retired professor of classics) provided assistance with the English, although he too had little military background and was new to Clausewitz. Translation Jolles quickly developed a good appreciation of On War's significance. His purpose in translating it was to argue that what Clausewitz had to say was much more relevant to the Western Allies than to Germany, and that the Germans' one-sidedly offensive interpretation of On War would prove to be, for them, a fatal error. Jolles's short but penetrating introduction stressed Clausewitz's fundamentally conservative, balance-of- power view of international affairs, finding its most important expression in Clausewitz's argument concerning the power of the defense: Clausewitz's aim was not merely to prove the strategic superiority of Napoleon's lightning attacks as so many writers and strategists--British and American, unfortunately, as well as German--seem to believe. This is but one part of his theory and far from the most important one, for he goes on to show why Napoleon, greatest of all aggressors up to that time, was necessarily in the end completely defeated. More than one third of his work On War is devoted to Book VI, on \\"Defense.\\" Reception Jolles's translation of Clausewitz is generally considered to convey more of Clausewitz's subtleties than the older Graham translation did and is certainly clearer on some points than the overrated Howard/Paret translation (1976/84). Oddly, Jolles's translation did not catch on, and the Graham translation continued to serve as the basis for most subsequent condensations. This development was most likely a result of financial considerations rather than of the qualities of the respective versions, since the Jolles translation remains under copyright (Random House) whereas the Graham copyright had lapsed.

The Diesel were evicted after the 2015 season, with the mayor of Olean saying that the team had damaged the playing field during a game in the 2015 season that was played in a rainstorm. The Diesel were able to negotiate a compromise before the 2016 season that limits their home appearances to one game per month during baseball season. A revived Olean Oilers, this version a member of the New York Collegiate Baseball League, took up residence at the stadium in 2013.

Arca Continental is listed on the Mexican Stock Exchange since 2001 and is a constituent of the IPC, the main benchmark index of Mexican stocks. History Origins The origins of the company date back to the times of the Mexican Revolution, to the founding of three independent companies in different cities. In Monterrey, the sparkling water bottler Topo Chico Company started operations in 1908 and became the first Mexican bottler of The Coca- Cola Company in 1926; Procor became its holding company in 1980. In Saltillo, the ice producing company Arma was founded in 1918 and it also became a Coca- Cola bottler in 1926; Argos initiated the same activity in Ciudad Juarez in 1936. Embotelladoras Arca Embotelladoras Arca, S.A. de C.V. was created in 2001 as a merger of the three oldest bottlers in Mexico: Argos, Arma, and Procor. This merger created the second largest Coca-Cola bottler in Mexico. At that time, the company distributed its products in Northern Mexico. Merger with Continental In 2011, Embotelladoras Arca and Grupo Continental ‚Äîa Coca-Cola bottler headquartered in Tampico, Tamaulipas‚Äî agreed to merge into Arca Continental. Estimates at the time of the merger suggested that sales would be about 1.2bn. Only Coca-Cola FEMSA was a larger bottler at the time of the merger. Acquisitions Embotelladoras Arca fuel its growth during the 2000s by acquiring companies in Mexico, Argentina, and Ecuador. In 2017, Arca announced the closing of a transaction with The Coca-Cola Company to acquire Great Plains Coca-Cola Bottling Company, which operates in some areas of the Southwestern United States, including the State of Texas, and parts of Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Arkansas. In May 2018, Arca announced the construction of the first new bottling plant in the United States in over a decade. The new $250 million plant will be 1 million sq. ft on a 140-acre site in Houston, Texas.

Opened in 1908‚Äì1909 and demolished in 1972, it was composed of a terminal station for the Hudson & Manhattan Railroad (H&M;), as well as two 22-story office skyscrapers and three basement stories. The complex occupied much of a two- block site bounded by Greenwich, Cortlandt, Church, and Fulton Streets, which later became the World Trade Center site. The railroad terminal, contained five tracks and six platforms for H&M; trains traveling to and from New Jersey via the Downtown Hudson Tubes, which traveled under the Hudson River to the west. The two 22-story office skyscrapers above the terminal, the Fulton Building to the north and the Cortlandt Building to the south, were designed by architect James Hollis Wells of the firm Clinton and Russell in the Romanesque Revival style. The basements contained facilities such as a shopping concourse, an electrical substation, and baggage areas. The complex could accommodate 687,000 people per day, more than Pennsylvania Station in Midtown Manhattan. The buildings opened first, being the world's largest office buildings upon their completion, and the terminal station opened afterward. The H&M; was successful until the mid-20th century, when it went bankrupt. The railroad and Hudson Terminal were acquired in 1962 by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which rebranded the railroad as the PATH. The Port Authority agreed to demolish Hudson Terminal to make way for the World Trade Center, and the railroad station closed in 1971, being replaced by the PATH's World Trade Center station. While the buildings were demolished in 1972, the last remnants of the station were removed in the 2000s as part of the development of the new World Trade Center following the September 11 attacks in 2001.  History   Planning and construction  In January 1905, the Hudson Companies was incorporated for the purpose of completing the Uptown Hudson Tubes, a tunnel between Jersey City, New Jersey, and Midtown Manhattan, New York City, that had been under construction intermittently since 1874. The Hudson Companies would also build the Downtown Hudson Tubes, which included a station in Jersey City's Exchange Place neighborhood, as well as a terminal station and a pair of office buildings in Lower Manhattan, which would become Hudson Terminal. Following the announcement of the Downtown Tubes, the rate of real estate purchases increased around Hudson Terminal's future location. The Hudson and Manhattan Railroad Company was incorporated in December 1906 to operate the Hudson & Manhattan Railroad (H&M;), a passenger railroad system headed by William Gibbs McAdoo, which would use the tubes. The system connected Hoboken, Pavonia, and Exchange Place, three of the five major railroad terminals on the western shore of the Hudson River waterfront.left Land acquisition for the buildings started in December 1905. The Hudson Companies acquired most of the two blocks bounded by Greenwich Street to the west, Cortlandt Street to the south, Church Street to the east, and Fulton Street to the north. Some low-rise buildings on Cortlandt Street were acquired to protect the views from the Hudson Terminal buildings. One landowner‚Äîthe Wendel family, which owned a myriad of Manhattan properties‚Äîrefused to sell their property, assessed at $75,000, and filed an unsuccessful lawsuit against H&M; in which they spent $20,000 on legal fees. By May 1906, H&M; had taken title to most of the land. The acquired for the complex had cost an average of . The New York Times predicted that the development of Hudson Terminal would result in the relocation of many manufacturing plants from New Jersey to Lower Manhattan. Excavations at the site of the office buildings were underway by early 1907, and the first columns for the substructure were placed in May 1907. Because of the presence of wet soil in the area, and the proximity of the Hudson River immediately to the west, the cofferdam for the Hudson Terminal buildings was said to be five times larger than any such structure previously constructed. At the time, there was a lot of office space being developed in Lower Manhattan, even as the area saw a decrease in real-estate transactions. The project was completed for $8 million (). The buildings were owned by the H&M; Railroad upon their completion.  Opening and usage  alt= By April 4, 1908, tenants started moving into the towers. Originally, the northern office building was called the Fulton Building while the southern office building was called the Cortlandt Building, reflecting the streets that they abutted. The H&M; terminal opened on July 19, 1909, and the Downtown Tubes had opened on the same day as the Hudson Terminal station. The combined rail terminal and office block was the first of its kind anywhere in the world. The space in the office buildings was in high demand, and the offices were almost fully rented by 1911. The following year, McAdoo denied rumors that H&M; would acquire the low-rise buildings on Greenwich Street to expand the Hudson Terminal buildings. Upon the tubes' opening, they were also popular with New Jersey residents who wanted to travel to New York City. Passenger volume at Hudson Terminal had reached 30,535,500 annually by 1914, and within eight years, nearly doubled to 59,221,354 passengers per year. Several modifications were made to the complex in the years after its completion. Smaller annexes were added to the office buildings at some point after they opened, during the early or mid-20th century. A passageway to the Independent Subway System (IND)'s Chambers Street station was opened in 1949. Early tenants of the Hudson Terminal buildings included companies in the railroad industry; the offices of U.S. Steel; and some departments of New York City's general post office, which had been crowded out of its older building. U.S. Steel, the post office, and six railroad companies occupied , or over a third of the total space in the buildings. The top floors of each building had private dining clubs: the Downtown Millionaires Club atop the Cortlandt Building and the Machinery Club atop the Fulton Building. With the exception of a brief period between 1922 and 1923, the terminal's post office operated until the United States Postal Annex at 90 Church Street opened two blocks north in 1937. Space in the buildings was also occupied by agencies of the United States federal government in the 1960s. Decline and demolition H&M; ridership declined substantially from a high of 113 million riders in 1927 to 26 million in 1958, after new automobile tunnels and bridges opened across the Hudson River. The H&M; had gone bankrupt in 1954. The state of New Jersey wanted the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to take over the railroad, but the Port Authority had long viewed it as unprofitable. In 1958, the investment firm Koeppel & Koeppel offered to buy the terminal buildings for $15 million, as part of a reorganization hearing for the H&M.; The Port Authority ultimately took over the H&M; as part of an agreement concerning the construction of the World Trade Center. The Port Authority had initially proposed constructing the complex on the East River, on the opposite side of Lower Manhattan from Hudson Terminal. As an interstate agency, the Port Authority required approval for its projects from both New Jersey's and New York's state governments, but the New Jersey government objected that the proposed trade center would mostly benefit New York. In late 1961, Port Authority executive director Austin J. Tobin proposed shifting the project to Hudson Terminal and taking over the H&M; in exchange for New Jersey's agreement. On January 22, 1962, the two states reached an agreement to allow the Port Authority to take over the railroad and build the World Trade Center on the Hudson Terminal site, which was by then deemed obsolete. The World Trade Center project would include a new PATH station to replace the Hudson Terminal station, as well as a public plaza to replace the buildings. Groundbreaking on the World Trade Center took place in 1966, and as with the Hudson Terminal buildings, a slurry wall to keep out water from the Hudson River. During excavation of the site and construction of the towers, the Downtown Tubes remained in service, with excavations continuing around and below the tunnels. The Hudson Terminal station closed on July 2, 1971, to allow a three-day maintenance period to divert service to its replacement, the original World Trade Center PATH station. The World Trade Center station opened on July 6, 1971, west of the Hudson Terminal station. Just before the buildings' demolition, in early 1972, the New York City Fire Department used the empty Cortlandt Building for several fire safety tests, setting fires to collect data for fire safety. The Hudson Terminal complex was demolished by the end of 1972. After the World Trade Center station opened, the sections of the Downtown Tubes between the Hudson Terminal and World Trade Center stations were taken out of service and turned into loading docks for the 4 World Trade Center and 5 World Trade Center buildings on Church Street. The original PATH station was destroyed in 2001 during the September 11 attacks. The last remnant of the Hudson Terminal station was a cast-iron tube embedded in the original World Trade Center's foundation, located near Church Street. The tube was located above the level of the PATH station and the station's replacement after the September 11 attacks. The cast-iron tube was removed in 2008 during the construction of the new World Trade Center.  Railroad station  The railroad terminal's construction was overseen by Charles H. Jacobs, chief engineer, and J. Vipond Davies, deputy chief engineer. The terminal was two stories below street level and consisted of five tracks numbered 1‚Äì5 from west to east. The tracks were served by four island platforms and two side platforms. The Spanish solution layout of the platform allowed each track to abut two platforms, thereby enabling passengers to exit trains from one side and enter from the other. The Hudson Terminal station was arranged as a balloon loop connecting both of the Downtown Tubes, which ran in its own tube with a loading gauge large enough to fit one train. Trains entered from the south and exited from the north. The station ran perpendicularly to both of the Downtown Tubes, and at either end of the station, there were sharp curves to and from each tube, with track radii of . The eastbound tunnel ran under Cortlandt Street and the westbound tunnel ran two blocks north under Fulton Street.  Platforms and tracks  The station had been built with five tracks because, at the time of its construction, there were plans to build another pair of tunnels under the Hudson River near the Downtown Tubes. The H&M; anticipated that two terminal tracks would be needed for each pair of tunnels, and a fifth track would be needed for service flexibility. Track 5, the westernmost track, was used by baggage trains and was designated as the \\"emergency\\" track. The westernmost side platform, serving Track 5, was used for handling baggage, delivering coal, and depositing ashes from the buildings' power station. The easternmost side platform adjacent to track 1, as well as the island platforms between tracks 2/3 and 4/5, were used by alighting passengers only. The island platforms between tracks 1/2 and 3/4 were used by boarding passengers. Each of the platforms were long and could fit eight-car trains of cars. The platform widths were determined by the projected passenger loads for each track. The eastern side platform was wide because it was used only by alighting passengers from track 1, and the island platform for alighting passengers between tracks 4/5 was wide because track 5 was not used in regular service. The other three island platforms were wide because they each served two tracks that were used in regular passenger service. Except at the platforms' extreme ends, they contained straight edges to minimize the gap between train and platform. Other stations located on loops, including the City Hall and South Ferry stations of the New York City Subway that had been built by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT), contained curved platforms, whose gaps between platform and train posed a great liability to passenger safety. Illuminated departure signs on each platform displayed the destinations of the trains on each track. The station was lit by incandescent lamps throughout.  Surrounding infrastructure  The station tunnels contained provisions for an unbuilt extension northward to what is now the 34th Street‚ÄìHerald Square subway station. If this extension had been built, it would have tripled the maximum number of trains that could go into the Hudson Terminal station. The sections of tunnel around the Hudson Terminal station were taken out of regular service when the World Trade Center station was built about to the west. The World Trade Center station could fit ten-car trains, and sat underneath Greenwich Street, which was oriented further northwestward compared to the Hudson Terminal station parallel to Church Street. Because it was longer than the Hudson Terminal station, a large jughandle curve was built from either tube to the World Trade Center station, surrounding the Hudson Terminal approach tracks. The sections of the tubes east of Greenwich Street were subsequently turned into loading docks serving 4 and 5 World Trade Center. The single tubes of the Downtown Tubes enabled better ventilation of the station by the so-called piston effect. When a train passed through the tunnel, it pushed out the air in front of it toward the closest ventilation shaft, and also pulled air into the rail tunnel from the closest ventilation shaft behind it. The Hudson Terminal station also used fans to accelerate the movement of air.  Connections  When the Hudson Terminal buildings opened, direct transfers were available to the IRT's Sixth Avenue elevated at Cortlandt and Church Streets, and to the Ninth Avenue elevated at Cortlandt and Greenwich Streets. The connection to the Sixth Avenue Line station, opened in September 1908, was via an elevated passageway from the third floor of the Cortlandt Building. In 1932, the Independent Subway System opened the Hudson Terminal station on its Eighth Avenue Line, though the IND station was operationally separate from the H&M; station. Though the IND had also planned for a passageway between its Chambers Street station and the H&M;'s terminal in the original plan for the Eighth Avenue Line, a direct passageway to the Chambers Street station was not opened until 1949.  Towers  This view from the southwest shows how Hudson Terminal was situated on what would become the World Trade Center site. The terminal is at center-left; in the background to its left is the Woolworth Building; in the background to its right are the Singer Building and the Equitable Building; and in the foreground to its right is 90 West Street. Hudson Terminal included two 22-story Romanesque-style office skyscrapers above the H&M; station. The buildings were designed by architect James Hollis Wells, of the firm Clinton and Russell, and built by construction contractor George A. Fuller. Purdy and Henderson were retained as the structural engineers. Located on what would later become the World Trade Center site, the Hudson Terminal buildings preceded the original World Trade Center complex in both size and function. When the Hudson Terminal buildings opened, the height and design of skyscrapers was still heavily debated, and New York City skyscrapers were criticized for their bulk and density. Some of the city's early-20th-century skyscrapers were thus designed with towers, campaniles, or domes above a bulky base, while others were divided into two structures, as at Hudson Terminal. The buildings occupied most of the site bounded by Cortlandt Street to the south, Church Street to the east, and Fulton Street to the west, with the northern building at 50 Church Street and the southern building at 30 Church Street. The site was also abutted by several low-rise buildings on Greenwich Street to the west. They were respectively called the Fulton Building and the Cortlandt Building, and were also collectively referred to as the Church Street Terminal. The buildings were separated by Dey Street, since the city government would not allow the street to be closed and eliminated.  Form  The Hudson Terminal buildings, along with 49 Chambers, were the city's first skyscrapers to include an \\"H\\"-shaped floor plan, with interior \\"light courts\\" to provide illumination to interior offices. The buildings' land lots originally occupied a combined . According to the Engineering Record, the Fulton Building occupied a lot measuring about , while the Cortlandt Building occupied a lot measuring about . However, the New-York Tribune gave slightly different measurements of for the Fulton Building and for the Cortlandt Building. By the mid-20th century, annexes had been added to both buildings, giving them a combined lot area of . The two buildings were otherwise designed similarly. The first through third stories of both buildings were parallelogram in plan, while the buildings contained \\"H\\"-shaped floor plans above the third story. The light courts of both buildings faced north and south, while the main corridors of each level on both buildings extended eastward from Church Street. The Cortlandt Building's light courts measured , while the Fulton Building's light courts were . The wings on either side of the light courts were of asymmetrical width. The main roofs of the buildings were carried to above ground. Small projecting \\"towers\\" with pitched roofs rose from the Church Street side of both buildings, rising to .  Facade  The designs for the buildings' facades called for Indiana limestone cladding below the fifth-floor cornice, and brick and terracotta above. The original proposal included rows of triple-height Doric columns supporting the roof cornice. As built, the lowest four stories of each building were made of polished granite and limestone; each ground level bay was filled with glass. The top six stories of each building contained light-toned terracotta, as in the original plan. The corners of each building had light terracotta strips as well. Tall arches connected three of the top six stories. Because of the differing dimensions of the buildings, the Fulton Building had eighteen bays facing Church Street and nineteen facing Dey Street, while the Cortlandt Building had twenty-two bays facing Church Street and twenty facing Cortlandt Street. The two buildings were connected by a pedestrian bridge over the street on the third story of each building. A bridge connecting the buildings' 17th floors was approved and built in 1913, soon after the complex had opened.  Features  As completed, the buildings used 16.3 million bricks, 13,000 lighting fixtures, 15,200 doors, 5,000 windows, and 4,500 tons of terracotta, as well as of partitions and of concrete floor arches. Also included in the buildings were many miles of plumbing, steam piping, wood base, picture molding, conduits, and electrical wiring.  Structural features  left The superstructure of the Hudson Terminal buildings required over of steel, manufactured by the American Bridge Company. The superstructure of the Fulton Building was intended to carry a dead load of and a live load of , for total, while the Cortlandt Building could carry a dead load of and a live load of , for total. The columns were allowed to take a minimum stress of and a maximum stress of . The floors were generally made of reinforced concrete slabs placed between I-beams, with cinder concrete fill and yellow-pine finish. Terracotta tile, brick, and concrete was used to encase the structural steel frame. The I-beams were supported by columns or on plate girders. Large wind braces were not used; instead, the flanges of the beams and girders were riveted to the columns with what the Engineering Record described as \\"a moment of stiffness equal or somewhat superior to the depth of the girder\\".  Interior  The towers had a combined 39 elevators, which could carry 30,000 people a day. This included 17 passenger elevators and a freight elevator in the Fulton Building, and 21 elevators in the Cortlandt Building. Of the 39 elevators in the buildings, 22 ran nonstop from the lobby to the eleventh floor while the remainder served every floor below the eleventh. Three of the elevators continued to the underground concourse, although the elevators did not descend to the concourse except during emergencies. With a total rentable floor space of , some of which was taken by the H&M; Railroad, the Fulton and Cortlandt Buildings were collectively billed as the largest office building in the world by floor area. Each building contained of office space on each floor; the Fulton Building had per floor and the Cortlandt Building per floor. The towers could house a combined ten thousand tenants across 4,000 offices. At ground level, the buildings contained glass-enclosed shopping arcades that were \\"much larger than the famous European arcades\\".  Basements  There were three stories of basements beneath the office buildings. The first basement level was a shopping and waiting concourse directly below the street. The second basement level contained the H&M; platforms. The third and lowest level contained the baggage room, electrical substation, and an engine and boiler room for the substation. Four cement ramps, two each from Cortlandt and Fulton Streets, descended to the first basement level. There were also two bluestone staircases from Dey Street. According to architectural historians Sarah Landau and Carl Condit, \\"At full capacity, the Hudson Terminal could accommodate 687,000 people per day; in comparison, Pennsylvania Station (1902‚Äì1910) was designed with a capacity of 500,000.\\"  Facilities  The concourse, on the first basement level, contained ticket offices, waiting rooms, and some retail shops. It measured , much of which was open pedestrian space. The floor of the concourse was made of white terracotta with colored mosaic bands, while the columns and walls were made of plaster wainscoted with white terracotta. The concourse contained a dropped ceiling, concealing some utility pipes and wires placed beneath the main ceiling. The basements were equipped with baggage handling facilities for the baggage trains traveling on Track 5. Two freight elevators carried baggage from Dey Street to the westernmost side platform or the baggage room in the third basement. Four elevators also existed to transport baggage from the baggage room to any of the four island platforms. The basements also contained a training school and break rooms for the H&M; Railroad, as well as an ice-making plant, elevator hydraulic pumps, a generating plant, and a storage battery. Hudson Terminal's electrical substation consisted of two rotary converters for the railroad and four rotaries for the buildings. From the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad Powerhouse in Jersey City, an 11,000-volt line of alternating current transmitted power to Hudson Terminal, where it was converted to 625 volts of direct current for the railroad and 240V DC for the offices.  Substructure  The O'Rourke Engineering and Contracting Company were hired to build the complex's foundation. The foundation used irregular framing because of the presence of the tracks on the second basement level, and the cofferdam was said to be five times larger than any other similar structure previously constructed. The perimeter of the foundation was excavated using 51 pneumatic caissons, drilled to depths of between , with an average depth of . This required the underpinning of every building nearby. The caissons were made of reinforced concrete with walls. At this location, the underlying rock layer descended a maximum of beneath Church Street. Within the interiors of the enclosed cofferdam, 115 circular pits and 32 rectangular pits were dug. The steel columns supporting the superstructure were then placed in the pits; they weighed up to and could carry loads of . The entire lot area was then excavated to the second basement level. Part of the third basement was also excavated down to bedrock. Overall, of earth were excavated manually and excavated via caissons. The Hudson Terminal station's platforms contained columns at intervals of about every . Some of the girders in the substructure were spaced irregularly because of the placement of the railroad platforms at the second basement level. Heavy sets of three distributing girders, encased in concrete, were used in these locations to support the weight of the Fulton and Cortlandt Buildings. Dey Street was carried above the mezzanine via a series of plate girders and I-beams, which formed a \\"skeleton platform\\" measuring about long by wide. The structure carrying Dey Street could accommodate loads of up to . In total, the substructure included of concrete and of structural steel. Notable incidents During the complex's existence, the buildings experienced several incidents. Within a year of the office building's opening, in 1909, a man died after falling from a window in the Fulton Building; other deaths from falling occurred in 1927 and 1940. A bag full of explosives was found in the terminal in 1915, with enough explosives to blow up several buildings of the Hudson Terminal towers' size. The elevators were also involved in several accidents: two people were slightly injured by a falling elevator in 1923, and a woman was killed two years later after being trapped in an elevator. Phillips Petroleum Company executive Taylor S. Gay was also shot and killed in the terminal in 1962. There were several incidents in the H&M; station as well. In 1937, a 5-car H&M; train crashed into a wall, injuring 33 passengers. Twenty-six people were injured in a 1962 crash between two H&M; trains at the terminal.

It was designed by Aristarchos Oikonomou, and build between 1971 and 1973. It is a box girder bridge with three spans; the largest span is 196 m. The bridge is situated on the border of the regional perfectures Aetolia-Acarnania and Evrytania. The nearest village is Triklino. The name Tatarna comes from a nearby monastery. History In the same place there was a 17th-century arch stone bridge over the river Achelous. Adjacent to the old bridge was the largest spring of the Achelous, known to the locals by the name Mardacha (ŒúŒ±œÅŒ¥Œ¨œáŒ±). Both the bridge and the spring were submerged when the Kremasta Dam was built in the 1960s and the area overflowed by the waters. Near the old Tatarna bridge the first battle of the Greeks from Roumeli against the Turks during the struggle for independence (1821) took place. Not very far from the new bridge is located an abyss hole on the ground. In that hole (according to the locals and other sources) many opponents to E.A.M. organisation were killed and thrown in the abyss dead or alive. A monument erected near the place in order to remind this event. References Notes * ŒíŒ±œÉŒπŒªŒµŒØŒøœÖ Œô.
