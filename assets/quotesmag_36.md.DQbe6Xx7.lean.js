The Andrians were compelled to join the fleet of Xerxes I in his invasion of Greece, in 480 BCE; in consequence of which Themistocles attempted to levy a large sum of money from the people, and upon their refusing to pay it, laid siege to their city, but was unable to take the place. The site was situated nearly in the middle of the western coast of the island, at the foot of a lofty mountain. Its citadel strongly fortified by nature is mentioned by Livy. It had no harbour of its own, but it used one in the neighbourhood, called Gaurion (ŒìŒ±œçœÅŒπŒøŒΩ) by Xenophon, and Gaureleon by Livy, and which still bears the ancient name of Gavrio. The site is located at Palaiopolis, where extensive ruins of the ancient city are to be found. Among other artefacts discovered there, were inscriptions, including an interesting hymn to Isis in hexameter verse. The town and its territory were celebrated for its wine in antiquity, and the whole island was regarded as sacred to Dionysus. There was a tradition that, during the festival of this god, a fountain flowed with wine.

The film stars Y≈´ichi Nakamura as Jun Shibahara, Y≈´ta Takahashi as Naoki Murai and Sh≈ç Kubo as Sh≈çichi Kato. The film was released on May 10, 2008. The movie also has a sister film premiered simultaneously titled Classmates, which is composed of the same cast but with different plot and without BL themes. Plot Jun Shibahara is a high school student with high expectations for swimming, but as the team coach's son he is nicknamed \\"Taiikukan Baby\\" (gymnasium baby) and no one believes his position is due to his own merits. Jun also must deal with constant rumors that his father got his late mother pregnant (who was one of his students) and never married her, another reason why he is nicknamed like that. After being diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, Jun is forced to stop swimming and loses all reason to exist. During his visits to the hospital, he meets Nozomi Hayakawa, a classmate who has been admitted due to a cancer and he discovers that she has not much time left to live. Shortly after, Naoki Murai (his replacement in the swimming team), asks Jun to be his coach since he admires him a lot. Jun and Murai begin to spend time together, and Murai soon confess his love for Jun and kiss him, a fact that leaves Jun confused. Jun tells what happened to his best friend Sh≈çichi, who takes an overprotective attitude towards him and another defensive towards Murai, since he is also in love with Jun. Both boys swear a mutual rivalry that starts a complicated love triangle. Murai and Kato compete in order to earn Jun's affections; however, Jun is not able to reciprocate the feelings of any of the two, since he is also dealing with his forced exit from the swimming world. Finally, on the day of the graduation, Murai tries to kiss Jun in the middle of the ceremony after receiving his diploma, only to be stopped by Kato, who bursts into the kiss by interposing a photograph of the already deceased Nozomi. A very frustrated and embarrassed Jun leaves the ceremony while telling both suitors to follow him; the film ends with the three boys walking away while laughing.

The issue was his expulsion from Dawson College for exposing a security flaw in the school's computer system. He became a technology entrepreneur after the incident.  Early life  Al-Khabaz was born to a Shia Muslim family who fled Iraq in the early 1990s. His father was educated as a doctor at Indiana State University. He was, however, imprisoned when he came back to Iraq due to his religious beliefs. Al-Khabaz' interest in computers stemmed from playing games at an early age. He was thrilled about the idea of breaking stuff and making new discoveries. He hacked into computer games like the real-time strategy Warcraft game and the first-person shooter video game, Counter-strike. At age 16, he would code in C++ and inject dynamic-link libraries into video games, which he would release to public chat forums. After high school, he applied for the computer science program at Dawson College but was not accepted. He was, however, admitted to the school's social studies program and transferred to computer science later.  Controversy  When he was 20 years old, Al- Khabaz was expelled from Dawson College for what the school called as \\"unauthorized access\\" offense. As a member of the school's software development club, he was creating a mobile application that would allow students easier access to their personal information. In the course of the application development, he discovered that the college's online administration system, which uses Omnivox software, was vulnerable to hacking due to what Al-Khabaz cited as \\"sloppy coding\\". The software, a system widely used by Quebec's general and vocational colleges, was developed by a company called Skytech Communications. The vulnerability exposed the personal information of over 250,000 students, including social insurance number, credit card numbers, home address, phone number, class schedule - basically all the information the college has on a student. It was reported to the college's director of information services and technology. Al-Khabaz was initially congratulated for his work with a promise from the school that the system would be fixed. When he did not hear from administrators after a few days, Al-Khabaz checked if the problem was addressed using Acunetix, which is a program used to analyze the security of web applications. This was how he was accused of cyber attack for being spotted in the Skytech system without prior notification from the system administrator. According to Dawson College, he was expelled for violating the school's code of professional conduct on account of his repeated and unauthorized attempts to access the college information system.  Hearing  The story attracted national attention in Canada after it was published by the National Post. Al-Khabaz maintained that he did not receive a fair hearing when a panel of 15 faculty members voted in favor of expulsion, 14-1 although he was interviewed by the dean of Dawson College and his computer science program coordinator. The expulsion received criticism from some quarters such as the Dawson Student Union, which later worked for Al-Khabaz' reinstatement. An online petition urging the school to revoke its decision gathered 12,000 signatures. The school stood by its decision and cited how Al-Khabaz was repeatedly warned to cease and desist but failed to do so.  Technology entrepreneur  After he was expelled, Al- Khabaz received numerous job offers from technology and software companies. These included a public offer from Edouard Taza of Skytech Communications who said that the student is ‚Äúextremely bright‚Äù, promising a full scholarship to a private CEGEP and a part-time job at his company. Al-Khabaz, however, opted to launch Outpost Travel, a startup that aggregated peer-to-peer travel accommodations with business partner Ovi Mija, a fellow Dawson College student. His company was awarded $200,000 in venture capital, and counted Dave McClure as one of the investors. In 2016, Al-Khabaz relocated to Boulder, Colorado where he got accepted to the Travelport Labs Accelerator program. Al- Khabaz has since co-founded a travel tech company named, Stay22, which is a free accommodations widget for event websites that allow users to view price- coded map of all accommodations in the area where an event is taking place. Stay22 raised over $750,000 from various investors including Travelport, FounderFuel, Real Venture, and 7 Gate Venture.

He is a founding member of Squishface Studio, a co-share workspace for comic artists.  Animation  Blumenstein's film Shit Party was a selection of the 2002 Melbourne International Film Festival. He directed the short animated film Herman, the Legal Labrador in 2004; it starred Shaun Micallef, Katrina Mathers, Loc Nghe and Santo Cilauro. He later directed the music video The Happiest Boy for The Bedroom Philosopher, segments of the C31 anthology series Take One and the animated series Be A Man. He worked as a storyboard artist on the children's series Wakkaville and Jar Dwellers SOS, and as an animator on the children's series Dogstar and the adult animated series Pacific Heat. In 2014 he was one of a group of animators selected for the Designing Dreams Studio, an initiative of ACMI and Dreamworks.  Comics  In 2012, Blumenstein co-founded Squishface Studio, Australia‚Äôs first open comics studio, which functions as a workplace, retail space and classroom. It supports itself through workshops and memberships. He was also part of the Caravan of Comics, a cartoonist tour of North America. In 2013, he won an award for Graphic Short Story in Melbourne's Lord Mayor's Creative Writing Awards for a piece called The Bolt Report. Blumenstein wrote the piece in epistolary voice, as his school-aged younger brother, Tristian, completing a media studies assignment. The piece was subsequently attacked by its subject, conservative commentator Andrew Bolt. Blumenstein later continued writing in Tristian's voice for pieces published at Daily Review and The Lifted Brow. He also illustrated a comics piece written by Paul Owen covering the Australian federal election for Guardian Australia. In 2015, Blumenstein wrote #takedown: My evening on a pier with pick-up artists and protesters, a book about professional pickup artist Julien Blanc, who was heavily protested, and eventually ejected from the country, while on a controversial tour of Australia. After submitting a piece by Tristian to the Senate inquiry into George Brandis' funding cuts to the Australia Council for the Arts in 2015, Blumenstein was warned that making a submission purporting to be from a non-existent person could find him in contempt of Senate. He withdrew Tristian's submission but made one himself on behalf of Squishface Studio. Blumenstein wrote Free Money, Please in 2019 and released it simultaneously on Medium and zco.mx. It is a graphic essay about cryptocurrency and passive income. Blumenstein has written for Junkee, Crikey, Daily Review, Medium, The Nib and Guardian Australia. He is currently serving as deputy president of the Australian Cartoonists Association.  Other media  In 2014 Blumenstein was interviewed by comedian/writer Justin Heazlewood for the book Funemployed, which is about the financial challenges that face artists working in Australia. He also appeared on the subsequent ABC radio series of the same name. Blumenstein co-hosted a podcast in 2017 called Pitchface in which he and co-host Adam Wajnberg pitch creative and business ideas.  Design career  Currently Blumenstein works as a service designer and visual communicator. He was hired in 2015 as a founding designer in the IAG Labs, and spoke about his drawing, prototyping and design work at the UX Australia conference in 2017.

He was a forest ranger employed by the United States Forest Service from 1916 to 1951 at a ranger station in Darrington, Washington, where he was a civic booster. Biography Bruseth was born on August 1, 1886, to Norwegian immigrants who moved from Michigan to Stanwood, Washington. He had two brothers and two sisters. Bruseth attended schools in Silvana and took over his father's farm after his death in 1905, but sold it in 1913 and spent the following two years in California. Bruseth returned to Washington in 1916, taking a position with the United States Forest Service at their Darrington station, where he would be employed for 35 years. He served as the fire lookout at Mount Pugh and settled on a homestead in the Darrington area. Bruseth made the first recorded ascent of Whitehorse Mountain in 1909 and Mount Pugh in 1916. According to local legend, Bruseth courted Beate Staff Falk, a recent Norwegian immigrant to the area, by making the descent from Mount Pugh once a week to take her to the town's dance hall. The two were married on May 10, 1921, and had two children. As a forest ranger, Bruseth developed mountain trails in the North Cascades and was active in civic affairs for the Darrington community. He volunteered as the head of several local improvement committees, including those organizing the Timber Bowl festival and other events, and taught children to ski. Bruseth was also a noted local historian, photographer, botanist, guitarist, geologist, and author. He wrote a weekly column in The Arlington Times and published several books, including a compilation of indigenous legends from the Stillaguamish and Sauk-Suiattle. For his contributions to Darrington, local residents honored Bruseth as \\"Mr. Darrington\\" in 1950, following an attempt to make him the newly-incorporated town's first mayor, which he turned down as a federal employee who was ineligible to hold a civic office. Bruseth retired in 1951 and spent much of his retirement painting local landscapes, which were donated to causes in Darrington.

Early life  She was born on 21 July 1994. She is the youngest of six siblings.  Career  She is best known for her collection of drawing called the Hshouma project created in 2018, depicting nude women and calling out double standards and sexual taboos. Hshouma was first exhibited in Madrid, Spain. Her work aims to fight censorship, taboos and shame in Morocco. She is also founder of the collective /Women Power/ that sponsors 20 women to take part in workshops. In 2014, she moved to Casablanca, where she currently lives. She started drawing when she was four years old. Many of Fasiki's illustrations are self-portraits often nude portrayed in the hammam or painted as characters such as Wonder Woman. One of her most iconic images is a nude, all green figure of herself keeping watch over Casablanca. In her comics, the women she draws do not have because she says \\"I see women as statues in my society and I want to free them.\\" I want them to be free human beings. She claims she has \\"never felt free\\" in Morocco or with her paintings as printers in Morocco are reluctant to print her work. She prefers to portray women undressed, strong, and unafraid. Through her images she tries to normalize women's bodies in art and media by countering the objectification and sexualization of women that is prevalent in Morocco and in the Middle East region. In October 2018, she partnered with a UN Refugee Agency to animate a story of the lives of four refugees from Sub-Saharan Africa including one woman subjected to female genital mutilation. In November 2018, her work was exhibited at Le Cube Gallery in Rabat. In October 2019, she was named a TIME magazine Next Generation Leader for her comic book Hshouma. The title addresses the shame culture and works to be a \\"guidebook\\" and discuss gender based violence, censorship and sexuality.

Situated in the Pernik Province, it is part of the Tran Municipality. Mraketintsi has a permanent population of 15.  Topography  Mraketintsi is situated in a high elevation, hilly region of Bulgaria. It is surrounded by thick forest in every direction. Route 63 passes through Mrakentintsi, on its way to Tran, from Pernik. The village also has a stream that flows into the River Yablanitsa which passes Mraketintsi alongside Route 63.  Climate  The climate is temperate and characterised by four distinct seasons; Warm but not hot summers, with very cold winters. Spring is cool with plenty of precipitation, towards the end of march and beginning of April. Fall is warmer than spring but similar.  Toponymy  The name of Mraketintsi (Bulgarian: –ú—Ä–∞–∫–µ—Ç–∏–Ω—Ü–∏) originates from the word (Bulgarian: –ú—Ä–∞–∫) meaning 'Darkness'. According to locals this came about due to the history of the village, as it used to be a hiding place for Bulgarian liberation forces and rebel fighters at night, during the Russo-Turkish War.  History  The first recorded written mention of the name/place Mraketintsi was in 1878. According to locals, Bulgarian liberation forces and rebel fighters would hide in Mraketintsi at night during the Russo-Turkish War and that's where the name comes from. It was seen a good hiding place due to it being well-hidden at night and easy to defend. Many of the older homes in the village have back doors and basements in case the Ottoman forces came so they could easily escape in the night. They would also cover the windows so no light would be seen. However the war itself never made it to Mraketintsi. Today Mraketintsi faces the same fate as most of rural Bulgaria‚Äîdepopulation. The village only has a permanent population of 15. Most of the houses are now being used as holiday villas that locals, now living in the large cities, only come to maintain and use in the summer time.

Early life Ram√≠rez whose full formal name was 'Manuel Ram√≠rez de Galarreta y Planet' was born in 1864 in Alhama in Aragon, Spain to Jos√© Ram√≠rez de Galarreta, a very well-off land owner. His father Jos√© Ram√≠rez de Galarreta had been born in Salvatierra and had originally come to Madrid to work for the Marques de Salamanca who was a property developer responsible for the Barrio del Salamanca, an upmarket area of Madrid. When his older brother Jos√© Ram√≠rez opened his guitar making workshop in Madrid in 1882, Manuel joined him. Founding of his own workshop In 1891 Ram√≠rez decided to move to Paris and establish himself there, to which his brother Jos√© offered his support. However, for unknown reasons, Ram√≠rez changed his plans, and decided instead to start his own workshop in Madrid, which would be in direct completion with his brother. This caused a lasting enmity between the brothers and they never spoke again. Ram√≠rez opened his workshop at Cava Baja n¬∫ 24, before relocating to Plaza de Santa Ana n¬∫ 5, and in 1897 to Calle Arlab√°n n¬∫ 10 where he remained until 1912, before moving next door to n¬∫ 11. Enrique Garcia (1868-1922) who began an apprenticeship with Jos√© Ram√≠rez in 1883 joined Manuel Ram√≠rez. The workshop took some time to attract customers which lead Ram√≠rez to bring in income by working for a period as an electrician for the Madrid Electric Company, leaving the workshop in the hands of Garcia. The business also made violins as well. In 1893 Manuel won a medal at that year's Chicago Fair. Manuel Ram√≠rez's style of guitar followed the ideas of Antonio Torres and came to be regarded as his successor, yet at the same time he inquisitively experimented and further developed Torres's ideas. As a result he began producing guitars that had a lighter delicate sound, that became popular within the flamenco community. As well as Enrique Garcia among the luthiers that Ram√≠rez trained were Antonio Emilio Pascual Viudes, Domingo Esteso (1882‚Äì1937) and Modesto Borreguero (1893-1969) who became his apprentice at the age of 12. Manuel Ram√≠rez was also regarded as am excellent maker of violins. In 1895 Enrique Garcia left his position as Ram√≠rez 's foreman to move to Barcelona to establish his own workshop. Ramirez subsequently hired Santos Hernandez (1873 - 1943) in about 1905 as foreman. By 1912 Manuel Ram√≠rez had been appointed luthier to the National Conservatoire in Madrid.  Andr√©s Segovia and the 1912 In 1912 a young Andr√©s Segovia visited Ram√≠rez with a request to rent a guitar for a concert at the Ateneo de Madrid. as he had been finding that the guitar made by Benito Ferrer of Granada which he had been using up until then was proving insufficient. After hearing him play Ram√≠rez gave him the guitar, which had been largely made by Hernandez and originally intended for Gim√®nez Manj√®n. Segovia used the guitar in concerts and on recordings from 1912 to 1937 and played it at his United States debut in the New York Town Hall in 1929. After the guitar developed a crack Segovia switched to using a guitar made by Hermann Hauser. These performances bought Manuel Ram√≠rez's style of guitar and Hernandez's skill to the notice of other players. The guitar that Ram√≠rez gave Segovia was gifted by Segovia's widow, Emilita to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, where it now resides. The guitar given by Manuel Ram√≠rez to Andr√©s Segovia in 1912. It is now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Death Manuel Ram√≠rez died on 25 February 1916 leaving no offspring. Following his death Borreguero planned to open his own workshop, and even had labels printed, but changed his plans after Ram√≠rez‚Äôs widow asked him as well as Estero and Hernandez to stay. The instruments made during this period carry the Vuida de Manuel Ram√≠rez (widow of) label. Esteso left in 1917 to establish his own workshop followed by Hernandez in 1920. Hernandez went on to become one of the greatest guitar makers of the first half of the 20th century Borreguero continued working for the workshop despite the death of Ram√≠rez‚Äôs widow in 1921, until the business finally closed around 1923. Legacy In the early 1990s his brother's great- grand children, Amalia and Jose IV Ram√≠rez visited the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York where they extensively studied, and measured the 1912 guitar.

He recently joined the Janata Dal (Secular) as the State Secretary of Maharashtra State.  Early life and education  Patil was born on 18 September 1942, in the village of Guha, Ahmednagar (in present-day Maharashtra state). His parents were landless farm laborers, who worked on the fields of the local landlord for daily wages. He attended a local primary school till 7th grade, after which he dropped out because his parents couldn't afford the high school fees. He worked as a farm- hand for five years and rejoined high school when the government high school in Ahmednagar started providing free secondary education. He completed his education till 12th grade and thereafter attained a B.Sc. degree, supporting his education by working as a daily wage worker and doing several odd jobs. After B.Sc., he secured an appointment as a school teacher in Khadakwasala near Pune. While working as a teacher, he completed his Bachelor of Laws degree from the Law College in Pune and specialized in criminal law thereafter.  Legal career  His career as a lawyer was fairly successful and he gained fame due to his role in a few high-profile trials like the Manwath murder case and the Joshi-Abhyankar serial murder trial. He joined the Pune bar council in 1973. In that capacity, he raised the issue of relaxing the judicial entry age limit by ten years for backward castes and five years for all categories. He was appointed district public prosecutor in 1981 by the government of Maharashtra and continued in that role till 1985. In 1985, at the age of 43, he was appointed as judge of the Bombay High Court. During his judicial tenure, he delivered strict judgments against tax and octroi evaders. His judgement in \\"Kanjilal Premjit vs Range Forest Officer\\" led to an amendment to the Forest Act which held saw-mill owners liable to punishment for buying illegally chopped timber. Another of his notable judgments was in the case of \\"Associated Bearings Pvt. Ltd. vs the Union of India\\"; he held that taxes evaded by exploiting loopholes should not be retrospectively refunded by the government to corporations because the corporations do not refund the consumers and effectively pass the tax burden to them. His difference of opinion with Justice Shah, in that case, is widely cited in the legal literature. He was also instrumental in getting the government to institute the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay High Court. He resigned prematurely from the judiciary in 1990 to pursue social activism full-time.  Activism  After leaving the judiciary, he founded the Lokshashan Andolan (People's Democratic Movement). He has been associated with another former judge-turned-activist Justice P.B. Sawant (former judge of the Supreme Court of India). He spearheaded various grassroots movements throughout Maharashtra. Most of the movements were for social and economic justice for rural, Adivasi, small farmers and displaced people. Notable movements among them include: An agitation march of landless and small farmers in Maharashtra, led by B. G. Kolse-Patil * Anti Enron protests in Maharashtra in the late 1990s. In 1997, he was arrested under section 151 of the CrPC to prevent him and his associates from taking part in the planned hunger strike against Dhabol Power project. * Movement of farmers and Adivasis against the Alibag SEZ in the 2000s * Protest against the Dow chemicals plant in Shinde-Vasuli near Pune * Movement against the Jaitapur Nuclear Power Project in Konkan Besides popular movements, he has been part of fact-finding teams which have investigated several matters of civil rights and social justice, such as: * Fact-finding team investigating Khairlanji murder case in 2006 * Rehabilitation and resettlement of Manibeli Oustees Sardar Sarovar project inquiry report (Inquiry into the status of Manibeli Oustees conducted by him on behalf of Indian People's Tribunal on Environment & Human Rights) * Concerned Citizens Inquiry on the Nanded blast in February 2007 For his role in these people movements, he was kept under surveillance and profiled by the private surveillance company Stratfor, which had been hired by Dow Chemicals. This was revealed when WikiLeaks released the Stratfor papers.  Politics  In March 2019, he announced his candidature for the 2019 Lok Sabha election from Aurangabad constituency on behalf of the opposition alliance called Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (Front of the Deprived Majority) on a Janata Dal (Secular) ticket with support from the Congress.

Her most famous work is her \\"South Bronx Spirit\\" photo series, documenting the urban decay of the South Bronx due to its total economic collapse during the 1970s.  Personal life  A New Yorker with Puerto Rican roots, de Leon grew up in the black and Latino neighborhoods of the South Bronx. During the second half of the 20th century, white flight, economic changes, and the construction of the Cross Bronx Expressway led to racial tensions and rising rates of crime, decreasing property values and further disadvantaging the poor working classes of the South Bronx. De Leon was convinced that the mainstream media was not accurately portraying what was happening to the South Bronx and its people during her upbringing, and this led her to capture the daily lives of the children and families who still remained in the decaying neighborhoods using photographs. De Leon also considers herself an activist, and in 2018 she joined forces with LuminAid and University of Puerto Rico students to distribute solar lights to remote areas of the island following Hurricane Maria in 2017.  \\"South Bronx Spirit\\" Photo Series (1970s - 1980s)  Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, de Leon used photographs to document the communities of the South Bronx, occupied predominantly by African Americans and Latinos. These images became her \\"South Bronx Spirit\\" photo series, which offered a counter-narrative to the negative stereotypes aimed at the residents of the South Bronx after the beginning of its economic collapse. Her photographs document the damage to the African American and Latino neighborhoods by the construction of the Cross Bronx expressway, fragmenting their community and infrastructure, and the subsequent devastation by extensive fires during the 1970s. She photographed residential streets that were reduced to rubble to the degree that they appeared like bomb sites. The photographs feature children playing outside and engaging with de Leon amongst the ruins. The series is intended as a historical document showing the consequences of U.S. austerity, and highlighting U.S. policy towards poor black and Latino communities. The \\"South Bronx Spirit\\" Photo series has been featured in exhibitions at the El Museo del Barrio, Smithsonian American Art Museum, and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. In 2018 she appeared on the radio broadcast Constructive Forces hosted by Kate Yoland on Resonance FM to discuss the history behind the project.  Exhibitions   Down These Mean Streets: Community and Place in Urban Photography (2017)  De Leon was one of ten Latino photographers featured in the Smithsonian American Art Museum's Exhibition: Down These Mean Streets: Community and Place in Urban Photography. The exhibit focused on multiple cities that underwent drastic changes in terms of demographics and economy due to white flight and the construction of new highways that cut through once thriving neighborhoods. The ten artists documented the economic and social disintegration that especially occurred in working class African American and Latino communities. De Leon's photo series, \\"South Bronx Spirit\\" was featured. The exhibit was also on view at El Museo del Barrio from September 2018 to January 2019.  Home-So Different, So Appealing (2017)  The \\"South Bronx Spirit\\" photo series was featured in an exhibition that was organized by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in collaboration with the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. Home‚ÄîSo Different, So Appealing featured U.S. Latino and Latin American artists from the late 1950s to the present. According to LACMA's press release on the exhibit, \\"the artists deceptively use the simple idea of 'home' as a powerful lens through which to view the profound socioeconomic and political transformations in the hemisphere. De Leon was one of 39 artists who contributed a total of 100 works that the exhibit used to explore contrasts within art related to targeted immigration policies and political repression.  She Persists (2019)  De Leon was one of 44 female artists from New York City to be featured in the first ever woman's Art Exhibition to be on display at Gracie Mansion. The event was hosted by Mayor Bill de Blasio and curated by Art Historian Jessica Bell Brown. The exhibit aimed to reflect a fuller representation of New York's history by featuring women, who were largely underrepresented during the 220 years of Gracie Mansion's existence.  Books   Decades Under Fire: The Invisible Puerto Rican-American (2019 - 2020)  Decades Under Fire: The Invisible Puerto Rican-American is an upcoming book by Perla de Leon that seeks to compare economic collapses, fires, and U.S. policies in the South Bronx, Vieques, and Puerto Rico.  Other works   The Afro Descendant Project - Puerto Rico (2017)  In recognition of Puerto Rico completing 500 years since the beginning of colonial rule under Spain since 1517, de Leon started a new photo-series consisting of photo- portraits of the citizens of Puerto Rico with African American roots. The purpose was to document Puerto Rico's \\"most vulnerable and invisible citizens,\\" whose ancestors were brought over by slave ships to build the foundation for Puerto Rico's economy.

It has smooth bark, broadly lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, creamy-white flowers and hemispherical fruit. It is thought to be a hybrid between E. kessellii subsp. eugnosta and E. semiglobosa. Description Eucalyptus √ó balanopelex is a mallee that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth pale grey to brownish bark throughout. The leaves on young plants and on coppice regrowth are dull green, egg-shaped, long, wide and always have a petiole. Adult leaves are lance-shaped, sometimes broadly lance-shaped, long and wide with a petiole long. The adult leaves are usually the same glossy green on both side and have a dense network of veins. The flowers are arranged in groups of seven or nine in leaf axils on a pendulous peduncle long, the individual flowers on a pedicel long. The mature buds are oval, long and wide with a conical operculum about 50% longer than the floral cup. The flowers are creamy-white and the fruit is a hemispherical capsule, long and wide with the valves protruding above the rim. The Australian Plant Census lists this species as a natural hybrid between E. kessellii subsp. eugnosta and E. semiglobosa. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus √ó balanopelex was first formally described in 1992 as Eucalyptus balanopelex by Lawrie Johnston and Ken Hill who published the description in the journal Telopea. The specific epithet (balanopelex) is derived from the Ancient Greek words balanos meaning \\"acorn\\" or \\"barnacle\\", and pelex meaning \\"a helmet\\", referring to the shape of the operculum. Distribution and habitat This eucalypt grows on a low-lying sandplain near Esperance. In 2012, Dean Nicolle and Malcolm French proposed that E. balanopelex is a hybrid of E. kessellii subsp. eugnosta and E. semiglobosa and should be delisted from the list of threatened flora. It is no longer listed by FloraBase.

At the same time, musicians could also enjoy great status, like in the case of the emperor Hongzhi who was very well known for being a proponent of music. Most musicians however, were not part of imperial or gentry family and Ming music culture was characterized by four distinct but closely interrelated subcultures. These were the court, literati, religious, and commoner music subcultures. The lives of these different types of musicians were incredibly different, but songs were a shared art form that demonstrated the ideals of both the elites and commoners. Elite musicians  Literati  Officials in Ming China used Confucian philosophy in their music playing, and by playing the qin the literati would better themselves morally with the end goal being to better serve society. Taoists played the qin to become enlightened individuals and become one with nature. Furthermore, qin music was not a form of music that was used by the literati to make money, in essence qin when played by the literati was elevated from the same position most other music had, and it occupied a special role in the lives of these learned officials. Some officials even considered playing virtuousically to be a negative as it took away from the profoundness of playing the qin. The musiking of the literati led to the foundation of music centers in cities around China, like Beijing, Nanjing, Suzhou, or other cities where many scholars visited or lived. These music centers created their own musical subcultures as well, showing how diverse music was in Ming China.  Emperor  The emperor along with their subjects shaped the music culture of Ming China. When emperors used their music to become a part of court institutions and cultural traditions, their rule would become more powerful, like in the case of Emperor Hongwu who directly shaped the foundation of Ming court music. Hongwu Emperor set up four court music offices with the help of his subjects. These four music offices were the State Sacrificial Music Office, the Eunuch Music Office, the Entertainment Music Office, and Palace Women Music Office. Common musicians  Soldiers  During the Ming period soldiers were often expected to play music in processions when the Emperor would travel. These soldiers were used by the emperor to demonstrate his power. By having many soldiers following him, the Emperor would put himself in a position of power and the soldiers would be lost in the crowd, being a backdrop for the Emperor rather than being an individual musician exploring their art like the Literati. Being a musician for the military did not change their profession, soldiers were expected to protect the emperor while acting as musicians for the procession. Unlike the Literati, soldiers would play loud instruments like drums and horns rather than delicate instruments like the qin. Their music would be characterized by being very rhythmic and loud in order to show off the qualities of a strong man that they were expected to have. Professional qin performers Unlike the Literati who played the qin, those who made their living off of performing aimed to make the audience feel the beauty, excitement, and emotion of the music. These professional performers compiled and wrote their own pieces for the qin which are still being played in modern times. Although these professional qin players had a different philosophy to music, they still interacted with the Literati. In fact, the Literati often had professional Qin performers as their teachers whom they learned all about the qin from. Furthermore, through interacting with the literati these commoner musicians learned the arts that the literati practiced and they also learned to follow the same philosophy. However, due to the prejudice towards those who used music to make a living these commoner musicians were not well respected by their employers, the literati. Female musicians While Confucian scholars disregarded female musicians as improper and they had a disdain for their work, in actuality female musicians were able to rise in the occupation like their male counterparts. Many folk songs are credited to female musicians and were included in the book of odes. Young gentry girls learned to play the qin from their fathers and teachers. In 1530 Shizong Emperor commanded blind female singers to sing the value of female virtues to female virtues to his court ladies. Female musicians were respected, but not allowed to fill the offices of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices because proper music was a male and courtly jobs. To the common man however, female musicians were very well respected and because their music was more interesting than the music of rituals and the state.

As commander of the 200th Division of the National Revolutionary Army, he distinguished himself in the Battle of Kunlun Pass and the Battle of Toungoo during the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Burma Campaign. He was wounded in battle while returning to China from Burma, and died in May 1942. He was posthumously promoted to lieutenant general by Chiang Kai-shek and awarded the Legion of Merit medal by US President Franklin D. Roosevelt.  Early life and career  Dai was born in 1904 into a family of farmers in Wuwei County, Anhui, Qing China. His birth name was Dai Yangong (), and was later given the name Dai Bingyang () in school. An excellent student, he was accepted by the Anhui Public School run by Tao Xingzhi. In 1924, Dai went to Guangzhou (Canton) after learning about the establishment of the Whampoa Military Academy. He was accepted by the academy later that year, and changed his name to \\"Anlan\\", which means \\"calming the waves\\". After graduating from Whampoa in early 1926, Dai was appointed a platoon commander in the National Revolutionary Army. He participated in the Northern Expedition and fought against the Japanese army during the Jinan incident.  Second Sino-Japanese War and Burma Campaign  Following the Mukden Incident in 1931, the Empire of Japan occupied Northeast China and persistently encroached upon North China. In March 1933, Dai, by then a regiment commander, fought the Japanese army at the Gubeikou Great Wall, where his poorly trained peasant force suffered significant losses against the well equipped Japanese. When the Second Sino- Japanese War fully broke out in 1937, Dai had been promoted to a brigade commander. He fought in many battles including at Taierzhuang and Wuhan, and was promoted to deputy commander of the 89th Division and then commander of the 200th Division. In December 1939, Dai commanded the 200th Division on the front line of the Battle of Kunlun Pass and successfully defended the pass against Japanese attack. Severely wounded in the battle, he returned to the unit after undergoing more than a month of medical treatment.  Battle of Toungoo  After the outbreak of the Pacific War in December 1941, the Japanese quickly captured the British colonies of Hong Kong and Singapore, and launched a major attack against British Burma. The British requested assistance from China, and the Kuomintang government sent 100,000 troops to fight in the Burma Campaign. Dai's 200th Division served as the vanguard of the Chinese Expeditionary Force and reached Toungoo in lower Burma on 8 March 1942. They engaged the Japanese for the first time on 19 March. After destroying the British Air Force in Burma, the Japanese surrounded Toungoo with a force four times as numerous as Dai's defenders. However, the 200th Division fended off Japanese attacks for ten days, killing more than 5,000 enemy troops. After losing 4,000 of his own soldiers, Dai decided to give up Toungoo and the division broke out of the siege on 30 March.  Retreat and death  The 200th division retreated north across the Sittaung River and linked up with the 22nd Division. They blocked Japanese advance up the Sittaung and captured Taunggyi in central Burma from the Japanese on 25 April. However, as the Chinese and British forces both suffered heavy losses, the Kuomintang government ordered the Expeditionary Force to withdraw from Burma. While on their way home, the 200th Division was ambushed by the Japanese. They broke out of the siege, but Dai was wounded on 18 May in the battle, while two of his regiment commanders were killed. Eight days later, Dai Anlan died at Mogaung in northern Burma.  Memorials and honours  Tomb of Dai Anlan on Mount Zheshan in Wuhu Statue of Dai Anlan When the 200th Division returned to China, Dai's coffin was greeted by tens of thousands of mourners. In July 1942, he was given a state burial in Quanzhou, Guangxi, the home base of his division. Chiang Kai-shek composed an elegy in his memory and posthumously promoted his rank from major general to lieutenant general. As Dai's memorial service was held in Quanzhou, the Communist leader Mao Zedong, then based in Yan'an, composed the following poem: In 1944, when the Japanese launched the Operation Ichi-Go and attacked Guangxi, Dai's coffin was temporarily moved to Guiyang for protection. After the end of World War II, a permanent tomb was built for him on the scenic in Wuhu, overlooking his hometown. When his coffin was reburied in 1947, the funeral procession was long. On 28 October 1942, US President Franklin D. Roosevelt awarded Dai the Legion of Merit medal, making him the first Chinese soldier to receive a military medal from the United States. In 1945, US President Harry S. Truman and Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson signed a certificate for the award. The medal and certificate were destroyed during the Cultural Revolution. In the 1980s, when Dai's eldest son Dai Fudong was a visiting scholar in the US, he wrote President Ronald Reagan to request a reissue of the items. His request was granted, and Fudong later donated the medal and certificate to the Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution. In 1975, the Chunghwa Post of Taiwan issued a set of six stamps to commemorate the 30th anniversary of victory over Japan, featuring six national heroes who died in the war: Zhang Zizhong, Gao Zhihang, Sa Shijun, Xie Jinyuan, Yan Haiwen, and Dai Anlan. In 2013, Dai's children, together with other descendants of the soldiers of the 200th Division, built a Buddhist pagoda in Mogaung to commemorate Dai Anlan and other soldiers who died in the Burma Campaign.  Family  Dai Anlan with wife Wang Hexin and two of their children: Fanli and Jingdong After Dai's death, his wife Wang Hexin () donated the entire death benefit of Fabi $200,000 she received from the Kuomintang government to build the Anlan Memorial School in Quanzhou, Guangxi. When the Kuomintang lost the Chinese Civil War in 1949, Wang and her children were offered the chance to retreat to Taiwan with the government. However, she chose to stay in mainland China to be near her husband's tomb. Dai and his wife had three sons and a daughter: Dai Fudong, Dai Fanli (), Dai Jingdong (), and Dai Chengdong (). Fudong became a distinguished architect who was elected an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering; Fanli, the only daughter, enlisted in the People's Volunteer Army during the Korean War; Jingdong was a professor of the Nanjing Institute of Technology, and Chengdong was a senior hydraulic engineer in Jiangsu province.

The AASC is one of the leading and groundbreaking organizations to have substantial and credible resources for their research. Located in Campbell Hall, the AASC quickly became a center for resource-gathering and scholarship for the Asian American movement. Asian American student organizations at CSULA, Occidental, USC, and other colleges soon followed. It was a vital hub and training ground for young activists, a place where they could earn a salary while doing community work.  History  The AASC was founded in 1969 by student activists, community advocates, alumni, and faculty allies as a result of the Asian American Movement and the strikes by the Third World Liberation Front (TWLF). The Asian American movement which was most active during the 1960s through the 1970s was a sociopolitical movement for racial justice and protested against racism and US neo-imperialism. The movement demanded reformations in institutions such as colleges and universities and sought out social services such as healthcare, food, and housing for underrepresented Asian Americans. The TWLF was a coalition of the Black Students Union, the Latin American Students Organization, the Intercollegiate Chinese for Social Action, the Philippine American Collegiate Endeavor, American Indian Student Organization, Mexican American Student Confederation and the Asian American Political Alliance that formed in San Francisco State University and at the University of California, Berkeley in 1968‚Äì1969. Students of color protested against the university‚Äôs administrations for ethnic studies and open admissions in response to the Eurocentric education and lack of diversity within the disciplines and teachers. On November 6, 1968, African American, Asian American, Chicano, Latino, and Native American students initiated and sustained the San Francisco State Strike which became the longest student strike in US history and lasted for 167 days. On January 22, 1969, the UC Berkeley Third World Strikes began which continued the fight for student of colors to gain ethnic studies into their college education.  Organization  The AASC serves the UCLA campus and students and faculty in the social sciences, the humanities department, and the professional schools. The center also serves the wider audiences in the state, nation, and internationally by bridging professionals, scholars, and leaders around the world to the UCLA community. The AASC is one of four ethnic studies centers established at UCLA in 1969 that are now part of the Institute of American Cultures (IAC) [iac site], which reports to the Office of the Chancellor at UCLA. The AASC works to initiate and advance innovative research, events that will promote awareness, diversity, advocacy, and discussion of issues related to race and ethnicity, fellowships and research grant programs, scholarships and civic engagement.  Academics  The AASC‚Äôs formal Interdepartmental Degree Program was officially re-established as a Department of Asian American Studies at UCLA in 2004, during the thirty-fifth anniversary of the AASC. The Executive Board of the Academic Senate at UCLA voted in favor of departmentalization with the Chancellor‚Äôs approval.1 A community reception was held in the Los Angeles Chinatown to celebrate the new UCLA Department of Asian American Studies, where community members and leaders, such as California Assembly members Judy Chu and George Nakano, shared stories about how UCLA Asian American Studies had affected their lives. Part of UCLA‚Äôs College of Letters and Science the undergraduate program in the Department offers a Bachelor of Arts degree for Asian American Studies. The graduate program of the Department offers a Master of Arts degree.  Facilities  Inside the AASC Library/Reading Room UCLA Asian American Studies Library/Reading Room (RR/L) * The RR/L provides any student on campus with information on Asian American Studies. It is open at specific times during each quarter of the academic year. The RR/L tries to help the students and curriculum in two different ways: 1) developing and maintaining current information and research and 2) developing additional information to different resources.  Publications  The AASC also produces publications through UCLA AASC Press, including Amerasia Journal, AAPI Nexus Journal, and CrossCurrents. AAPI Nexus is a national journal that focuses on policies, practices and community research and draws information from professional schools, applied social science scholars, practitioners and public policy advocates to support Asian American Studies‚Äô mission to serve AAPI communities and provide practical research. The Center Press has published Amerasia Journal since 1971 and the founding publisher of Amerasia Journal was Don T. Nakanishi.

The type and only species is Galleonosaurus dorisae.  Discovery and naming  Galleonosaurus dorisae was described by Matthew C. Herne, Jay P. Nair, Alistair R. Evans and Alan M. Tait in 2019. The holotype specimen is NMV P229196, a complete left maxilla with partial dentition. Other specimens referred to Galleonosaurus include NMV P212845, a partial left maxilla lacking erupted dentition; NMV P208178, a partial left maxilla with erupted dentition; NMV P208113, a worn right maxillary tooth; NMV P208523, worn left maxillary tooth; and NMV P209977, partial left maxilla, lacking erupted dentition and NMV P186440, a posterior portion of left maxilla, left palatine, and fragment of left lacrimal. All specimens were collected from the Flat Rocks locality. The generic name is derived from \\"galleon\\" (a type of large sailing ship) and \\"saurus\\" (New Latin from the Greek sauros for lizard), in reference to the appearance of the maxilla to the upturned hull of a galleon. The specific name dorisae was given in recognition of Doris Seegets-Villiers for her geological, palynological, and taphonomic work on the Flat Rocks fossil vertebrate locality.  Description  Galleonosaurus was a small-bodied non- iguanodontian ornithopod. It is characterized by five potential autapomorphies: ascending ramus of maxilla has two slot-like foramina on the anterior margin that communicate with the neurovascular tract; neurovascular tract bifurcates internally to exit at two anteroventral maxillary foramina; lingual margin of maxillary tooth roots in midregion of tooth row form an S-bend at their bases; posterior third of maxilla on some, but not all, specimens deflects posterolaterally at an abrupt kink; and lateral end of palatine lateral ramus forms a hatchet-shaped flange.

Jones was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire in the 2006 New Years Honours List for services to Equality and Human Rights in the Armed Forces.  Early Life and education  Jones was born on 17 July 1968 in Bingley, West YorkshireGeneral Register Office England & Wales Birth Index 1916-2007 Volume 2c Page 94 and was educated at Bingley Grammar School prior to joining the University of Portsmouth. He was a member of Southampton University Royal Naval Unit in the rank of Midshipman Royal Navy Reserves between 1986 and 1989 and trained in HMS FENCER. Mid-way through his degree studies he was offered a Commission in the Royal Navy.  Naval career  Jones joined Britannia Royal Naval College Dartmouth in 1989 and passed out in April 1990. He completed his Fleet Time in HMS UPTON, HMS ARIADNE and HMS ALACRITY, before joining the Fleet as a Lieutenant in HMS CORNWALL in 1992. He was the Royal Navy's first Helicopter Fast Rope Boarding Officer and led operations to clear stranded shipping from the Shatt Al Arab after the 1st Gulf War. He was an Executive Officer in the border regions of Northern Ireland during \\"the troubles\\" conducting counter terrorism boardings and searches in the coastal regions. Later he was Deputy Navigator of the aircraft carrier HMS INVINCIBLE during Operation Bolton. After completing the Principal Warfare Officers Course, he was the Operations Officer of the Amphibious Flagship HMS FEARLESS. In 2004 he was the Fleet Signals Intelligence Officer at Northwood HQ and his final role was at the Ministry of Defence as the Maritime Signals Intelligence Procurement Officer. From the day of the lifting of the gay ban on 12 January 2000 and until leaving the Service in 2008, Jones led the LGBTQ community in the British Armed Forces and negotiated with Service Chiefs the unravelling of the impact of decades of prohibition.  Military law and homosexuality  Homosexuality was decriminalised under the Sexual Offences Act 1967, but this did not extend to members of the armed forces where men & women serving were dishonourably discharged if their sexuality was discovered. Warrant Officer Robert Ely, a bandsman who joined the army at seventeen and served for twenty years before being dismissed for his homosexuality, set up Rank Outsiders in 1994 with Lt Elaine Chambers, a Queen Alexandra's Royal Army Nursing Corps nurse who had endured a harrowing dismissal from a much loved career. Royal Navy Officer Edmund Hall later joined Rank Outsiders and set up the Armed Forces Legal Challenge Group in 1995 and is credited with winning the support of Stonewall to drive the British Government into lifting the ban. In 1998, the campaign worked with Stonewall on behalf of Jeanette Smith, who had been thrown out of the Royal Air Force, and Duncan Lustig Prean, a Royal Navy commander who was being dismissed. They asked Stonewall to arrange legal representation, leading to a long battle through the courts with Graham Grady and John Beckett also joining the case. Although the judges in the High Court and Court of Appeal said that they felt the ban was not justified they could not overturn it and Stonewall had to take the case to Strasbourg and the European Court of Human Rights before winning it. On 12 January 2000 the long-standing ban on homosexuals in the British Armed Forces was finally lifted. Announcing the change to Parliament, the Secretary of State for Defence, Rt Hon Geoff Hoon acknowledge that \\"There will be those who would have preferred to continue to exclude homosexual, but the law is the law. We cannot choose the decisions we implement. The status quo is simply not an option.\\"  Campaigner  As the \\"gay ban\\" was lifted Jones came out in an ill-prepared Armed Forces which had opposed the lifting of the ban for decades. By his own admission he forcefully petitioned Service Chiefs to unravel the impact of decades of prohibition, and is widely credited with driving change at a pace which was counter to the MODs intent. In 2005 the Royal Navy was the first armed service to sign up to Stonewalls Diversity Champions programme. In 2006, then a relatively junior officer, he was exceptionally and reluctantly given leave by the MOD to speak in the United States Congress tacitly advocating for the repeal of \\"Dont Ask Don‚Äôt Tell\\" (DADT) with members of Congress and Staffers. Jones continued to receive criticism at the Ministry of Defence for speaking openly about the resistance of some service chiefs to change, notably about the MOD not allowing members of the armed forces to march in uniform at Pride. In 2006 the Royal Navy was given permission to march in uniform at Pride followed by the Royal Air Force in 2007 and Army in 2008. He returned to Washington in 2009 for discussions at Brookings as the Pentagon prepared for their own policy change. In 2008, Jones was engaged as a consultant to the Equality and Human Rights Commission during their compliance investigation of the alleged harassment of women in the Armed Forces. The enquiry found that the Armed Forces were making steady progress and working towards greater compliance. Jones was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire in 2006 for services to Equality and Human Rights in the Armed Forces and completed his service career in 2008. To mark the 20th anniversary of the lifting of the British Armed Forces 'gay ban' Jones edited and published Fighting with Pride, a charity anthology book which brings together LGBT+ servicemen and women who have served in every conflict since WW2 to the present. Fighting with Pride was launched as a charity, supporting LGBT+ veterans on 12 January 2020. Minister of State for the Armed Forces, Anne-Marie Trevellyan MP read extracts from Fighting with Pride at a 20th anniversary reception at the House of Commons hosted by Johnny Mercer MP.

He is regarded as a pioneer in children's health services and infant nutrition. Early life Opp√© was born in 1925 in Hampstead to Ernest Frederick, a banker, and Ethel Nellie (n√©e Rackstraw). His paternal uncle was the historian and art collector Paul Opp√©. Tom Opp√© attended University College School, and went into banking at the age of 15. He left after six months, deciding that he would prefer to study medicine, and began his pre-clinical training at Guy's Hospital in 1942. He was evacuated to Tunbridge Wells for much of the Second World War, and graduated with honours in 1947. He completed his national service as a surgeon lieutenant with the Royal Navy Medical Service, working mostly on board the aircraft carrier HMS Implacable. Career Opp√© had decided to pursue paediatrics as a medical student. He completed a year as house physician at Guy's Hospital, although this was interrupted when he was hospitalised for nine months with tuberculosis. He then moved to Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital for two years and travelled to Harvard University for a research fellowship. After two years at St Mary's Hospital as a paediatric registrar, in 1955 he was appointed a consultant paediatrician in Bristol. In Bristol he worked alongside the neonatology pioneer Beryl Corner, who would continue to influence him after he left Bristol. In 1960 he returned to St Mary's in London, where he would spend the rest of his career and was appointed a professor of paediatrics in 1969. Opp√© had vast research interests, and the topics of his published articles included premature infants, hypoglycaemia in infants, infant respiratory distress syndrome, the treatment of rhesus disease, and vitamin D deficiency. His most cited work was on the nutrition of babies; he chaired a Department of Health and Social Security working party which produced a report in 1974 recommending that infants be breastfed for the first 4‚Äì6 months of life, which came at a time when most British babies were being fed with infant formulas based on cow's milk. He had a special interest in Williams syndrome after working with a Navy colleague whose child had the genetic condition. Opp√© was an adviser to the government on many aspects of child health and nutrition, and was a key member of the committee that published the 1976 report \\"Fit for the Future\\", which outlined a plan for the provision of child health services.

She graduated from Beijing Industrial Art Institute in July 1984, majoring in Non-Traditional Machining; and she started working in the sculpture creation studio in Central Academy of Fine Arts after graduation from CAFA in July 1991, with a Sculpture major.  Artistic Practice  The themes of Jiang Jie's sculpture works reveal the instinct of humanistic care. She uses flowing sculpture lines to bring viewers imaginary space, highlighting a female perspective investigating the world. At the same time, her works point to weakness and fragility as well as the contradiction and tension of life. Her work is usually microscopic and psychological, even in large sculptural and installation works, which are derived from her observation towards the vulnerability and decay of life existence. Jiang Jie's works have been characterized as introducing sculpture language into the field of installation. Another artistic indication that has been developed throughout her art-making is the theme of hope upon first impression, would usually turn out to be tragic atmosphere. Her use of inflants is said to be inspired by Jiang Jie's sympathy, as she uses \\"mystery, vulnerability, softness, wetness, sensitivity and desolation\\" in infants' bodies to indicate the loneliness and fragility of adults.  Representative Artworks   Fragile Products (1994) („ÄäÊòìÁ¢éÁöÑÂà∂ÂìÅ„Äã  Similar to The Appearance of Life (1994), infants are also a theme in Fragile Products (1994) and the vulnerability of human beings. She expresses vulnerability in order to reveal the cruelty of life. Jiang Jie used moist and fragile wax to make infants with broken arms and legs that are slightly larger than the real sizes of babies. In an exhibition of the work she piled up 50 duplicated infants of three different poses, and put them into a sheet of thin film plastic six meters long and five meters wide. Because the corners and sides of the thin film were hung vertically, 50 shattered infants were inevitably squeezed and bumped into each other in a state of disorder. The piece bridges the relationship between adult society and the world of children, as well as the relationship between soul and objects. It refers to the \\"fragility\\" of an infant or a person. At that time, Chinese feminist art criticism had not yet been fully realized, but Jiang Jie's works were classified as representing a kind of contemporary sculpture rather than Chinese feminist sculpture. After post-modernism spread in Chinese art circles, Jiang Jie's series of works had a stable relationship with feminism.  Parallel Men and Women (1996) („ÄäÂπ≥Ë°åÁî∑Â•≥„Äã)  Still working with infants, in this work the infants were used as products of a conceptual change by the use of duplication on the basis of sculpture, to the use of ready-made children-like models. Jiang Jie used wax and gauze layers on the two child-like models which look the same and show no gender characteristics. She also reshaped their bones, muscles and gender organs, and placed the couple horizontally on the base in a position that their heads and legs are facing toward each other. Since the original child-like models' color and the shape of legs still somehow remained, people could still see the commercial image from them. Plus, with the traces of wrapped medical gauze, the whole piece became closer to audiences. The characteristic of soluble wax further enhanced the ambiguous sense.  Approaching (1995) („ÄäÊé•Ëøë„Äã)  Composed of 28 wax infant models, this work included nets that were made of transparent silk and silk thread, the 28 infants were divided into several groups doing the same poses---as trying to approach each other with hands and faces up. The piece demonstrated that even if it's deliberate to get close to each other, they still couldn't really get close enough. The silk net that pulled by transparent silk thread in the air, which looks like a spider web, as well as the virtual scene under the lights both added a lot to this kind of absent- minded state and psychedelic atmosphere. Getting close to each other purposely would directly result in collision in the further step.

In 2002, the collective achieved a No. 13 UK hit with \\"Champagne Dance\\". After Pay As U Go disbanded, Wiley went on to form the grime crew Roll Deep with fellow Pay As U Go members. Roll Deep would eventually included prominent artists such as Dizzee Rascal, Tinchy Stryder and Skepta. The crew has been credited for paving the way for grime music, alongside So Solid Crew and Heartless Crew. History In 1998, Maxwell D and his friends Carl, DJ Target, and Wiley began performing on London pirate radio station Rinse FM. Together they formed a group called 'The Ladies Hit Squad'. Major Ace, Plague, God's Gift, and DJ Slimzee also hosted their own show on Rinse FM every Sunday. In the summer of 2000, the Pay As You Go phone network was experiencing network errors coincidentally every Sunday coinciding with their show, allowing everyone to call into the radio show for free. After three weeks of this, Plague dubbed the show the \\"pay as you go show\\". The pay as you go radio show and Ladies Hit Squad's show on Rinse FM were the most popular shows on Rinse FM at the time, leading to the owner of Rinse FM suggesting that Ladies Hit Squad and the pay as you go show merge together, leading to the official Pay As U Go crew being formed. Flowdan, Riko Dan, Dom P, Breeze and Bubbles later joined the group. The group released a dubplate, \\"Know We\\", in late 1999. The song was officially released in 2000 as their debut single. In 2001, Wiley, Flowdan, Bubbles and Breeze recorded a song entitled \\"Terrible\\", which record stores perceived to be a follow-up to \\"Know We\\". Wiley decided he did not want to release it under the Pay As U Go name, so Flowdan suggested the name Roll Deep; a homage to the phrase \\"rolling deep\\", popular within bashment songs. Following the creation of Roll Deep, Dogzilla and Lady J joined Pay As U Go in 2003. Flowdan cited the introduction of Dizzee Rascal to Roll Deep and his subsequent popularity as the reason why Pay As U Go eventually disbanded and Roll Deep rose to prominence.

She has worked as a foreign correspondent around the world, including the Middle East and South Asia. Nazish founded and is the director of The Coalition For Women In Journalism, a worldwide support organization for women journalists.  Career  In the early 2000s Nazish started her career in print journalism and went on to work in other media, including radio and television. Nazish has won awards for her work and has extensively covered conflict, peace and security in South Asia and the Middle East.  Pakistan‚Äôs tribal regions  Her work included stories from Pakistan‚Äôs tribal regions. She wrote, \\"I wanted to learn how journalists work in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, a semiautonomous, conflict-ridden region made up of seven tribal 'agencies' along the Afghan border known as the 'war zone.' Twelve journalists have been killed there since the terrorist attacks in the US on 9/11. If Pakistan is the worst place to be a journalist, FATA is the worst of the worst.\\" In Pakistan, she reported from the conflict-ridden FATA under Taliban control and later when the Pakistan army started its operation against terrorists in the region.  Life in Mosul  In 2017, Nazish catalogued the experiences of journalists working out of Mosul. ‚ÄúJournalists are beaten or executed as spies‚Ä¶ the militant group ISIS began rounding up journalists suspected of leaking negative information about the Islamic State,‚Äù she reported.  ISIS in Kobani, Syria  She did several stories on the ISIS presence in Kobani. In one article, Nazish noted, \\"Many dead bodies of Islamic States fighters are strewn across street corners, and this is creating a hygiene issue for the children and pregnant women still living inside.\\" She later wrote about ISIS in Pakistan. Nazish produced reports on civilians trapped in Aleppo during 2016. Her work focused on the plight of the civilians.  Kurdish struggle  Nazish covered Turkey‚Äôs curfews and their impact on Kurdish towns. ‚ÄúA 24-hour curfew was imposed on the town of about 130,000 people last December, and was only lifted this month. Residents who had fled the violence were allowed to return to Cizre on March 2, but many quickly discovered they had little to come home to.‚Äù, she wrote in one piece.  Daniel Pearl fellow  She was the Daniel Pearl fellow in 2014, at which time she worked at The New York Times.. While at the Times, Nazish focused on terrorism courts in Manhattan, the NYPD and the New York Muslim community. Nazish contributed reporting at the foreign desk.  Threats and exile from Pakistan  While investigating a story involving the influence of intelligence agencies on democratic institutions in Pakistan, Nazish received death threats and was forced to drop the story. In the wake of the threats, Nazish lived in self- exile for years. She was vocal about the threats women journalists faced during the time, and the impunity that the culprits enjoy. A 2017 study chronicled the many ways that women journalists had been surveilled and monitored, leading to self-censorship, documenting her experiences and exile.  The Coalition For Women In Journalism  As founding director of The Coalition For Women In Journalism, Nazish pioneered the first global mentorship program for mid-career women journalists. The organization emphasizes the safety, wellbeing and growth of women journalists. The organization launched in 2017 and worked as a pro-bono organization. In 2019, The Coalition For Women In Journalism received funding support from Craig Newmark Philanthropies. The organization initiated its advocacy, including documentation of the threats and abuse that women journalists face globally. The Coalition established a network in several countries, each including local mentors, who offer guidance to CFWIJ Fellows in their respective local language. Nazish sought to address gaps she saw in the industry and threats that women journalists face. ‚ÄúIn a precarious and largely misogynist environment, female journalists feel stressed, stuck and often tired,‚Äù she said in an interview. Nazish spoke at length about issues that women journalists face across the globe, and produced a research article for Women‚Äôs Media Center on how women journalists work in Mexico. The organization has networks in South Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and North America.  Academia  Nazish is the Stanley Knowles Distinguished Professor for 2019-2020 and is teaching journalism to undergraduate students at Brandon University. She taught courses such as Covering Conflict and International Journalism at the O.P. Jindal Global University in Delhi, India. She initiated journalism training programs and fellowships through her initiative at the Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS).  Recognition  Nazish received an Agahi Award in 2013 for best reporting for her story on internally displaced children in Dawn and was nominated for other pieces during 2012. Her work was on the Foreign Policy AfPak Channels‚Äô Top 10 of 2012. Her interview with Pakistani politician (and Prime Minister elect in 2018) Imran Khan made the list.

Lithuanians took Jews out of the ghetto to perform hard manual labor, accompanied with humiliations and beatings, and some were murdered and did not return to the ghetto. The living conditions (filth, overcrowding, lack of food and water) in the ghetto led to high mortality and disease, particularly so among the elderly.

It was initially intended to identify people who would be willing to assist Germany in the event of an invasion of the United Kingdom, but as it developed, it also acted to divert its targets away from harmful activities. Although it ended up providing information on more than 500 suspects, it was the source of conflict within MI5, and after the war ended it remained secret, with none of the targets ever aware that they had been its subject. It was revealed in a release of files to the National Archives in 2014. Personnel The operation was run by the counter-sabotage section of MI5, designation B1c. The head of this small section was Victor Rothschild, who had joined MI5 in 1940 to do scientific liaison. He was assisted by Theresa Clay, an entomologist whom he'd recruited. The agent at the heart of the operation was Eric Roberts, a former bank clerk who had been working undercover for MI5 inside the British Union of Fascists since 1934. The operation While looking for a spy ring at the British branch of the Siemens company in 1941, Roberts had come into contact with a British fascist, Marita Perigoe. Although MI5 believed Perigoe to be of \\"mixed Swedish and German origin\\", she was actually the London-born daughter of the Australian composer May Brahe. Perigoe was determined to help Germany win the war. At the start of 1942, Rothschild proposed that she should instead be put to work for MI5. Roberts, working under the alias \\"Jack King\\", told Perigoe that he was the Gestapo's agent in London, with instructions to find people who would be willing to help Germany in the event of invasion. Perigoe agreed to help and began bringing in recruits including her friend Eileen Gleave and a former fascist acquaintance Hans Kohout. The intention was that this would be a passive operation, but the recruits wanted to be put to work, either as sabotage agents or spies. MI5 decided the safest thing to do would be to allow them to gather intelligence. Kohout in particular was a prolific gatherer of intelligence: he brought in the specifications of the new Mosquito bomber, clues to night-vision technology and details of \\"Window\\". Other recruits supplied information on fellow fascists and Nazi sympathizers. The group met in a flat at 499 Park West, which had been bugged by MI5. By the end of the war, Roberts was estimated to be directly or indirectly in contact with 500 fascists. The operation was opposed by some within MI5, who argued that Roberts was effectively an agent provocateur. But Guy Liddell, director of counter-espionage, defended it: \\"In a very mild sense it is, but in the absence of other methods, I do think it is desirable to ascertain something about evilly intentioned persons.\\" Aftermath At the end of the war, MI5 considered prosecuting or unmasking the Fifth Column members, but opted instead to keep them running as informants. At a ceremony in January 1946, Roberts presented Perigoe and Kohout with Nazi medals - the Kriegsverdienstkreuz 2.Klass - and thanked them for their work. The files don't reveal when the operation was run down, but it seems to have tailed off by 1947. The members of the Fifth Column went to their deaths unaware of the truth of the operation. After Kohout died in 1979, his son Ernest found the medal among his things. War Merit Cross 2nd Class, given to Hans Kohout in January 1946 by the MI5 officer Eric Roberts, and found by Kohout's son Ernest after his death. Revealing of operation The operation came to light in files released by MI5 to the National Archives in February 2014. At the time, although the agent 'Jack King' wasn't identified, the Daily Telegraph newspaper named him as John Bingham. A subsequent set of files released by MI5 in October 2014 revealed that he was Eric Roberts, a previously unknown MI5 officer. The operation is the subject of the 2018 book Agent Jack by the journalist Robert Hutton.

She is remembered in particular for the vignettes she engraved for albums illustrating Bayonne and the Basque Country. She was also a competent painter of both portraits and landscapes, exhibiting in the Paris salon from 1836. Biography Born on 2 November 1812 in Paris, Jos√©phine Jeanne H√©l√®ne Feillet was the daughter of the painter and lithographer Pierre Jacques Feillet (1794‚Äì1855) and H√©l√®ne Pernotin. She was introduced to art by her father before studying portraiture under the Dutch artist Ary Scheffer (1795‚Äì1858). Her elder sister, Blanche Hennebutte-Feillet (1815‚Äì1886), was also a lithographer. In 1929, during a visit to Madrid with her father and sister, she created lithographs as illustrations in Spanish journals. She continued the work, even after the family had settled in Bayonne in 1834. In particular, she made five engravings for El Artista, two illustrating poems by Jos√© de Espronceda and three for the poetry of Eugenio de Ochoa. They are considered to be among the finest romantic illustrations of the period. From 1835 to 1940, Feillet created six lithographs to illustrate F√©lix Morel's Bayonne, vues historiques et descriptives. She then collaborated with her sister, creating an extensive series of illustration's for her brother-in-law, Charles-Henri Hennebutte. They appeared in his albums for tourists: Album des deux fronti√®res and Guide du voyageur de Bayonne √† Saint-S√©bastien. Feillet was nevertheless primarily a painter, exhibiting at the Paris salon from 1936. Notable examples of her work include a portrait of Juana Cano (1836), \\"Vue des environs de Bayonne, prise au Boucau\\" (1839), \\"Espagnole √† l‚Äô√©glise\\" and \\"Gitana en San Isidro, environs de Madrid\\". Her painting of \\"Arriv√©e √† Bayonne du duc et de la duchesse d‚ÄôOrl√©ans\\", painted 1839‚Äì40, was exhibited at the Salon in 1942. She was also commissioned to paint works to decorate the chapel of the Military Hospital in Bayonne and the church at Jasse en B√©arn.

He is a Vice Chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) and the chairman of the State Physical Culture and Sports Guidance Commission. Choe's portfolio as the Vice Chairman of the party covers workers' and social organizations affairs. Choe is also an alternate member of the Politburo of the WPK, member of the Central Committee of the WPK, and a deputy to the Supreme People's Assembly. Choe was a relatively low-profile politician working in the cultural field and the Kim Il-sung Socialist Youth League until about 2013 or 2014. With his ascension to the post of senior deputy director of the Propaganda and Agitation Department (PAD) in 2013, he became seen as a potential successor to propaganda chief Kim Ki-nam. After becoming the chairman of the State Physical Culture and Sports Guidance Commission in 2017, Choe has been seen as rising to the power elite of the country. Early life Choe Hwi was born in 1954. His father was Choe Chae-ha. He has a sister, Choe Mi-rim. Choe Hwi was educated at the Red Flag Mangyongdae Revolutionary School and Kim Il-sung University Department of Philosophy. Career Choe received his first significant political post in 1985 as a manager of the Sea of Blood Opera Troupe. In 1987 he became the head of the Pyongyang Art Troupe. In the 1990s he was a vice chairman of (Pan National Alliance for Korea's Unification). In January 1996, Choe became a secretary on the central committee of the Kim Il-sung Socialist Youth League and was tasked with extracurricular education. He returned to his old post as the head of the Pyongyang Art Troupe in 2000. In 2004, he became a deputy director of a department of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK). He was involved in setting up the Unhasu Orchestra and the Moranbong Band. In April 2013 Choe became the senior deputy director of the Propaganda and Agitation Department (PAD). In December 2015, Choe was the leader of the Merited State Choir and the Moranbong Band on a tour to China when the planned concerts were abruptly called off. Until around 2013 and 2014, Choe was a relatively routine member of Kim Jong-un's on-the-spot guidance tours. With his promotion to PAD, however, he was seen as a potential successor to propaganda chief Kim Ki-nam. According to Adam Cathcart of Sino- NK, \\"Choe Hwi has a lot to say about statues, monuments, and inscriptions\\" and of propaganda overall. Choe was elected to the 13th Supreme People's Assembly in the March 2014 election from Constituency 171 (Subok). He became a member of the 7th Central Committee of the WPK at the party's 7th Congress in May 2016. During the second plenary meeting of the central committee, he was elevated to the position of Vice Chairman of the WPK and alternate member in its politburo. Choe's portfolio as the Vice Chairman of the party covers workers' and social organizations affairs. In December 2017, he replaced Choe Ryong-hae as the chairman of the National Physical Culture and Sports Guidance Commission. Before this appointment, Choe was considered relatively unknown and it was seen as a sign of Choe's rise to the power elite of North Korea. Choe belonged to the delegation that traveled to South Korea for the 2018 Winter Olympics to meet President Moon Jae-in. A special permit by the United Nations Security Council's North Korea sanctions committee had to be secured for Choe's travel, because the Security Council had imposed an international travel ban and an asset freeze on him with the of 2017.

It is north of Bolton town centre, south of Blackburn, and northwest of Manchester.  History  Astley Bridge Mill. Astley Bridge is quite a modern place name and only came into general use during the second half of the 19th century. It now refers to the large district in the modern Metropolitan Borough of Bolton, but prior to then it simply meant the bridge over Astley Brook which ran through the lower end of the township of Sharples. A Local Board of Health for Astley Bridge was constituted in 1864. The District comprised the higher (or detached) portion of Little Bolton and the lower portion of Sharples. After the Public Health Act 1875 was passed by Parliament in that year, Astley Bridge Local Board of Health assumed extra duties as an urban sanitary district, although the Local Board's title did not change. Following the implementation of the Local Government Act 1894, Astley Bridge Local Board was replaced by an elected urban district council in January 1895 but was dissolved in 1898 under the Bolton, Turton and Westhoughton Extension Act and its powers vested in Bolton County Borough Council.  Governance Since 1974, Astley Bridge has been part of the Metropolitan Borough of Bolton and gives its name to one of Bolton Council's electoral wards, the Astley Bridge ward which includes the Sharples, Bank Top, Eagley Bank, and Horrocks Fold areas. It is represented in Bolton Town Hall by three councillors. The ward is also part of the Bolton North East constituency which has been represented in the House of Commons by the Conservative Party MP Mark Logan since 2019.

Brooks House, also known as the Jabez S. Fitch House or the Charles T. Gorham House, is a historic home located at 310 N. Kalamazoo Avenue in Marshall, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970, with the surrounding grounds added in 1984. History Jabez S. Fitch was a wealthy Marshall dry-goods dealer. In about 1840, he constructed this house, possibly using plans from New York architect Richard Upjohn. Fitch died in 1843, and the house was sold to Charles T. Gorham in 1851. Gorham was born in Connecticut in 1812, and came to Marshall in 1836. He opened a bank in 1840 and was active in the community. He was one of the founders of the Republican Party and served as a state senator and a delegate to the Republican national convention. He was appointed minister to the Hague by Ulysses S. Grant and served there from 1870 to 1875, then served as Assistant Secretary of the Interior from 1876-1877. Gorham owned the house until his death in 1901. In 1921, prominent Midwest landscape architect Jens Jensen designed the surrounding grounds. In the mid-1930s, preservationist Harold C. Brooks purchased the house from the Gorham family to use as his own home and furnished it with antiques. The house has been frequently noted in architectural histories as one of the best-known examples of Greek Revival architecture in the Midwest. The house has undergone significant renovations over the past decade by current owners Kevin Koenig and Todd Hokanson in an effort to preserve its history as one of the nation's most notable examples of Greek Revival architecture. Description The Brooks House is a two and ¬Ω-story brick temple-style Greek Revival house sitting on a stone foundation. The cellar of this home was finished as a traditional German-style rathskeller. The windows, door sills, and lintels are made of stone. The main wing measures 51 feet long and 39 feet wide, with a service wing which is at the rear measuring 26 by 25 feet. The front portico is 10 feet deep and contains five Ionic columns. The windows in the front are ten feet high and extend to the floor. The tympanum above the door contains a fanlight with wrought iron grilles and an eagle with outstretched wings. The sidelights and transoms on the entrances are also covered with wrought iron grilles.

Gaytan is best known for his live streams on the Twitch platform, where he streams his gaming and IRL experiences. He is a former member of Offline TV, an online social entertainment group of content creators.  Early life  Gaytan was born in 1995 to Mexican-American parents. He grew up with a brother in the Los Angeles area and attended the University of California, Santa Cruz. Gaytan dropped out in his last semester to pursue a career in video editing and to support his mother and brother after the death of his father.  Career  Gaytan was a full-time video editor for content creator Christian \\"IWDominate\\" Rivera, a former pro player for Team Liquid. He stopped editing for Rivera as he was invited to join the group Offline TV as an editor in June 2017. On July 8, 2017, he published his first YouTube video with the group, where he was formally introduced as the group's editor. Retrieved March 6, 2019 He was named as talent in January 2018 and was added to the OfflineTV streamer roster.  Twitch  Gaytan began his streaming career in early January 2018, after transitioning from being the editor for Offline TV. In the same year, his Twitch emote called \\"Fed7\\" had been used a reported 431 million times in three months, making it the most popular emote on the site at that time.  Ban history  Gaytan has been banned by Twitch on several occasions since he began streaming. His first ban occurred on November 28, 2017, where he was banned for jokingly photoshopping cleavage on pictures of his roommates Pokimane and Lilypichu for a YouTube thumbnail. The ban lasted 24 hours. Retrieved March 13, 2019 He was banned a second time in May 2018 after he showed a business card with personal information during an IRL stream. The ban lasted 3 days. His third ban, which occurred on July 20, 2018, was met with controversy. Gaytan was doing an unusual stream at the time, watching paint dry on a canvas while also not interacting with the online audience. An anonymous donator submitted a message with the pejorative \\"N-word.\\" A text to speech system read the message out loud and could not by stopped by his roommate due to a bug in the streaming software. Twitch responded with a 7-day ban, mainly due to Gaytan staying in character and not being able to mute the audio. His fourth ban occurred on April 1, 2019, after an intoxicated Gaytan knocked over private property during a live stream in Japan. The ban lasted 14 days. FEDMYSTER2 was temporarily banned on May 1, 2020 after Gaytan accidentally showed a glimpse of a nude picture of another streamer named Alinity while scrolling on Twitter. The ban, originally set for 3 days, was controversial as it was longer than the one imposed on Alinity herself (24 hours). The ban was lifted early after Gaytan appealed it to Twitch staff. On May 8, 2020, Gaytan's emote FedSimp had been taken down on the grounds of targeted harassment and bullying. Although he claimed my community never used it with ill intent and It was mostly banter and, in some cases, a compliment. Really unfortunate... One of my favorite emotes, the spamming of this emote on another streamer's channel lead to it being taken down. Sexual misconduct allegations On June 27, 2020, fellow Offline TV members Yvonne \\"Yvonnie\\" Ng and Lily \\"LilyPichu\\" Ki came forward with sexual misconduct allegations involving Gaytan. Ng stated that on two separate instances, Gaytan would enter her room uninvited, lay down on her bed, and begin inappropriately touching her. Ki stated that Gaytan would also enter her room uninvited and make inappropriate advances on her. These allegations resulted in Gaytan's immediate removal from the group. The situation was further elaborated on by fellow roommate and streamer Pokimane (Imane Anys), wherein she discussed that he had also made advances on her personal life and fueled growing distrust between the two. Anys also conveyed how the situation with Gaytan contributed the most to her leaving the Offline TV house.

History   Desilu Productions  Desilu Productions was an American production company founded and co-owned by husband and wife Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball, best known for shows such as I Love Lucy, Star Trek, and The Untouchables. Until 1962, Desilu was the second-largest independent television production company in the U.S. behind MCA's Revue Productions until MCA bought Universal Pictures, and Desilu became and remained the number-one independent production company until it was sold in 1967. Ball and Arnaz jointly owned the majority stake in Desilu from its inception until 1962, when Ball bought out Arnaz and ran the company by herself for several years. Ball had succeeded in making Desilu profitable again by 1967, when she sold her shares of Desilu to Gulf+Western for $17 million ($ in dollars). Gulf+Western then transformed Desilu into the television production arm of Paramount Pictures, rebranding the company as Paramount Television.  Paramount's early involvement in television  The Paramount Television Network was a venture by American film corporation Paramount Pictures to organize a television network in the late 1940s. The company built television stations KTLA in Los Angeles and WBKB in Chicago; it also invested US$400,000 in the DuMont Television Network, which operated stations WABD in New York City, WTTG in Washington, D.C., and WDTV in Pittsburgh. Escalating disputes between Paramount and DuMont concerning breaches of contract, company control, and network competition erupted regularly between 1940 and 1956, and culminated in the dismantling of the DuMont Network. Television historian Timothy White called the clash between the two companies \\"one of the most unfortunate and dramatic episodes in the early history of the television industry.\\" The Paramount Television Network aired several programs, including the Emmy Award- winning children's series Time for Beany. Filmed in Hollywood, the programs were distributed to an ad-hoc network of stations across the United States. The network signed affiliation agreements with more than 50 television stations in 1950; despite this, most of Paramount's series were not widely viewed outside the West Coast. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which filed suit against Paramount for anti-trust violations, prevented the studio from acquiring additional television stations. Paramount executives eventually gave up on the idea of a television network, and continued to produce series for other networks. Paramount Pictures had made a couple of attempts in the mid-1950s to produce series themselves under the Telemount (Television + Paramount) banner. The first, Cowboy G-Men, was a joint effort with Mutual Broadcasting for syndication. The second, Sally starring Joan Caulfield, was a short-lived series on NBC during the 1957‚Äì58 season. The spun-off theater chain purchased control of the American Broadcasting Company, and due to legal requirements sold WBKB-TV (now WBBM-TV) to CBS. Another attempt by Paramount was known as Paramount Pictures Television. One of the series was Destination Space, a pilot to a proposed series that never got off the ground, produced in association with the CBS Television Network in 1959.  The 1960s  In 1966, Paramount was on the verge of bankruptcy, when the studio was bought out by Gulf+Western. By that point, Paramount had largely distanced itself from television, having stopped production of its early shows, closed down its networks, and sold off the stations it owned. It also sold most of the early half of its sound-era theatrical library (mostly pre-1950 works) to such companies as EMKA, Ltd.‚Äîa wholly owned subsidiary of MCA (pre-1950 theatrical live-action sound features; now part of Universal Pictures), U.M. & M. TV Corporation (most short subjects released through September 1950; now part of Paramount-owned Melange Pictures), Associated Artists Productions ‚Äì also called a.a.p. [sic] for short (Popeye cartoons; now part of WarnerMedia's Turner Entertainment and Warner Bros. units), Harvey Films (most short subjects released between September 1950 and March 1962; now also owned by Universal Pictures, which bought DreamWorks Classics and its parent, DreamWorks Animation in 2016), and National Comics (Superman theatrical cartoons; later DC Comics, now also owned by WarnerMedia).  Sale and re-incorporation  In 1967, Charles Bluhdorn's Gulf+Western brought Desilu, which was merged with Paramount, who had been Desilu's next door neighbor since the closure of RKO Pictures. The sale resulted in Desilu's re-incorporation as Paramount Television in December of that year. The three Desilu lots the original RKO Studios and two Culver City locations were included in the sale, but the Justice Department forced Bluhdorn to sell the Culver Studios to avoid a monopoly.Dick, Bernard F. \\"Engulfed: the death of Paramount Pictures and the birth of corporate Hollywood\\" (pp. 118‚Äì119).

Wikimapia.org (March 19, 1966). Retrieved 18 August 2013. The first PTV production to premiere after the re-incorporation was Here's Lucy. Paramount only produced the first season however, selling their stake in the show to Ball after the season finale. Gulf+Western had plans to launch a television network in the late 1970s, the Paramount Television Service, with a new Star Trek series as the cornerstone of the network. But these plans were scrapped, and Star Trek: Phase II was reworked into Star Trek: The Motion Picture.  Ownership changes and library expansion  In 1989, Gulf+Western was re-incorporated as Paramount Communications, named after the company's prime asset, Paramount Pictures (the name of which was also used for the company as a whole). That firm was sold to Viacom in 1994. The Viacom merger gave Paramount a larger television library as well, since Viacom had television production and distribution units as well prior to the Paramount acquisition. The distribution company, Viacom Enterprises (which syndicated the classic CBS library among other shows), was merged into Paramount Domestic Television while the production company, Viacom Productions (known at the time for its co-productions with Fred Silverman and Dean Hargrove), continued as a PTV division until 2004. The first major hit from Viacom Productions to debut after becoming a PTV division was Sabrina, the Teenage Witch, based on the Archie Comic of the same name. Starring Melissa Joan Hart as the title character, the series lasted four seasons on ABC (in contrast to the lack of success from the parent company on the network in this period) and three on The WB between 1996 and 2003. Paramount continued to build its TV library. In 1999, Viacom acquired full interest in Spelling Entertainment Group (which included Spelling Television, Big Ticket Entertainment, Worldvision Enterprises, and Republic Pictures, among other companies), and the rights to Rysher Entertainment's TV holdings.  Launch of UPN and co-ownership with CBS  In January 1995, Paramount finally launched a TV network, the United Paramount Network, or UPN for short, which later merged with Time Warner's WB Network to form The CW. PTV produced the bulk of the series airing on UPN, including the first program ever shown on the network, Star Trek: Voyager. UPN became 100% owned by Viacom in 2000 after Chris-Craft sold its share (its TV stations were sold to News Corporation). Along with Voyager, the most successful PTV shows on UPN were One on One, Star Trek: Enterprise and Girlfriends. In 2000, Viacom acquired its founding parent CBS, which had actually spun off Viacom in 1971. PTV began producing more shows airing on CBS (it already produced JAG a former NBC production, Becker starring Cheers veteran Ted Danson, and Nash Bridges, having acquired the latter from Rysher). Most of the new PTV series that debuted on CBS after the merger were not very successful, including Bram & Alice and Out of Practice (starring Happy Days veteran Henry Winkler). However, four of these series would become hits: JAG spin-off NCIS, Numb3rs, Criminal Minds, and Ghost Whisperer (the latter two were co-productions with Touchstone Television, which later became ABC Studios). All four of these series would continue under CBS Paramount Television and later CBS Television Studios, with only NCIS and Criminal Minds still airing (both also had spin-offs of their own, with varied success).  Acquisition by CBS  At the end of 2005, Viacom split into two completely separate companies, one of which was called CBS Corporation, the other retaining the Viacom name. Despite Paramount Pictures being owned by the new Viacom, CBS inherited Paramount Television, as well as the right to retain the Paramount name. On January 16, 2006, CBS renamed the unit CBS Paramount Television.Friedlander, Whitney. (January 16, 2006) Eye lift for Par TV. Variety. Retrieved 18 August 2013. Paramount's final series was Courting Alex (co-produced with Touchstone Television) for CBS. Because National Amusements retains majority control of both CBS Corporation and the new Viacom, CBS programs (both before and after the split) are still distributed by Paramount Home Entertainment. The company survived as CBS Paramount Television for three years. However, CBS began phasing out the Paramount name as early as 2007, when the American distribution arm was merged with King World Productions (bought by CBS just prior to the Viacom merger) to form CBS Television Distribution. The international arm of PTV was merged with CBS Broadcast International in 2004 (two years before the CBS/Viacom split) to form CBS Paramount International Television. In 2009, CBS quietly announced that the Paramount name would be stripped from: the main company (CBS Paramount Television), its production arm (CBS Paramount Network Television), and its international arm, with the latter two being renamed CBS Television Studios and CBS Studios International, respectively. With these transactions, Paramount's involvement in television at least in name only since 2006 came to an end after 70 years (when the experimental TV stations that later became KTLA and WBBM were founded). Paramount had been the first major Hollywood studio to be involved in television. When CBS Paramount Television was renamed to CBS Television Studios, Paramount Pictures joined forces with Trifecta Entertainment & Media in distributing the Paramount and Republic film libraries on television.  Companies and individuals associated with Paramount Television  In addition to its various subdivisions, Paramount often co-produced multiple series with different companies, and had several people work on multiple series for the studio. Some examples are: * Grub Street Productions (Wings, Frasier, The Pursuit of Happiness, Encore! Encore!) * Garry Marshall/Henderson Productions (The Odd Couple, the Happy Days franchise, Me and the Chimp, Who's Watching the Kids) * Miller-Milkis(-Boyett) Productions (the Happy Days franchise, Angie, Petrocelli, Bosom Buddies) * Ubu Productions (Making the Grade, Family Ties, The Bronx Zoo, Day by Day, Duet, Open House, Brooklyn Bridge) * Hometown Films (Friday the 13th: The Series, War of the Worlds) * Ken Levine and David Isaacs (Cheers, Big Wave Dave's, Almost Perfect) * Ted Danson (guest appearances on Laverne & Shirley, Taxi, and Frasier, and starring roles on Cheers (Sam Malone) and Becker) * Henry Winkler (starring roles on Happy Days (Fonzie) and Out of Practice, guest appearance on Big Apple, executive producer of MacGyver, Mr. Sunshine, and Sightings) * Judd Hirsch (starring roles on Taxi, Dear John, George & Leo, and Numb3rs, as well as guest appearance on Philly) * Kelsey Grammer (starring role on Cheers and Frasier, guest appearances on Star Trek: The Next Generation and Wings, executive producer of Fired Up)  See also  * Paramount Television Studios ‚Äì the current TV division of Paramount Pictures References Category:Predecessors of CBS Television Studios Category:Mass media companies established in 1967 Category:Mass media companies disestablished in 2006 Category:1967 establishments in California Category:2006 disestablishments in California Category:ViacomCBS subsidiaries Original ","title":"Paramount Television (original)"},{"id":"60199193","text":"Amphisbaena bahiana is a species of worm lizards found in Brazil.

Jain. Background Since Elizabeth De Michelis's 2004 A History of Modern Yoga and Mark Singleton's 2010 book Yoga Body, the origins of the modern practice of yoga as exercise have been debated by scholars of religion. Singleton examined its origins in the physical culture of India in the early 20th century. Andrea Jain is a scholar of South Asian Religions and yoga at the Indiana University School of Liberal Arts. She gained her bachelor's degree in 2004 at Southern Methodist University; and then a master's degree in 2009, a graduate certificate in the study of women, gender, and sexuality in 2010, and her PhD that same year, all at Rice University. She is editor of the Journal of the American Academy of Religion. She contributed the essay on modern yoga to the Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Religion. In 2015 she published the book Selling Yoga : from Counterculture to Pop culture. Book Synopsis Jain prefaces the book with a personal note in which she explains how she came to research the subject, and records that despite her name she is not a practising Jain. The book is introduced with an account of premodern yoga systems. It then examines the role of yoga in western counterculture, and its relationship to consumer culture. It examines with worked examples the branding and commercialisation of modern yoga. It then analyses the extent to which modern (postural) yoga can be seen as a body of religious practice. Finally, it looks at the debate between the yogaphobia seen for example in some branches of Christianity, and the Hindu nationalist claim that modern yoga has Hindu origins; Jain illustrates the weaknesses in both types of claim. The book is illustrated with a small number of monochrome photographs. There is an academic bibliography and a detailed index. Reception The anthropologist Joseph Alter, reviewing Selling Yoga in Nova Religio, writes that the book is about much more than just the selling of yoga, covering in \\"a carefully argued and exceptionally sensitive and insightful account\\" both yoga's combination of the body, spirituality, and branding, and the interaction of politics with \\"the embodied fetishization of cultural heritage and identity.\\" Maya Warrier, reviewing the book in the Journal of American Studies, writes that Jain \\"decisively counters the notion that there is such a thing as an 'authentic' form of yoga\\", arguing instead that yoga has always been \\"polymorphous and adaptable\\", among other things, fitting into Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain traditions. Warrier notes that Jain's account of early Western \\"entrepreneur-yogis\\" like Ida C. Craddock, Pierre Bernard, and Sir John Woodroffe were all countercultural, appealing to westerners with \\"unorthodox\\" religious views. Jaime Kucinskas, reviewing the book for Sociology of Religion, notes that there has been confusion, even amongst academics, as to what yoga is and where the modern form of it came from, and states that the book \\"provides important and insightful answers\\" to these questions. Kucinskas writes that Jain describes \\"contemporary postural yoga\\" as \\"a new product that formed through dialogical interactions between Indians and Westerners from the nineteenth century to the present\\", building in \\"transnational cultural elements\\" like military callisthenics and modern medicine. yoga practitioners are predominantly female, young, affluent, fit, and white, something not wholly taken on board in Jain's book. Kimberley J. Pingatore, reviewing the book for Religion, writes that Jain \\"challenges the notion that all yogas exist as part of a monolithic, unbroken lineage... [and] convincingly locates [modern postural yoga]'s recent popularization in Europe and the United States as part of capitalist consumer culture\\", arguing that Jain then makes use of this consumer centre of gravity to attack the argument that this yoga belongs to non-Westerners. Pingatore finds Jain's first two chapters \\"brilliantly\\" summarize the research of the major scholars of yoga including David Gordon White, Joseph Alter, Christopher Key Chapple, Mark Singleton, Sarah Strauss, Elizabeth De Michelis, and Hugh Urban. Pingatore argues, too, that Jain \\"ferociously\\" deconstructs the East/West, Us/Them dichotomised understanding, in Chapter 3 showing that modern yoga systems grew \\"in response to transnational [consumer] cultural developments\\". On the other hand, Pingatore observes that while Jain argues that modern yoga defies attempts at definition or regulation, and disagrees that it is spiritual, she claims that it is a \\"body of religious practice\\". Pingatore remarks the absence of gender in Jain's account, writing that this is surprising given that yoga practitioners are predominantly female, young, affluent, fit, and white.

Bunka and his father were wounded in battle and recuperated in Zlatoust Hospita. Sent to the Belorussian front, Bunka was attached to the 1452nd Self-propelled Artillery Regiment. He was subsequently attached to the 10th Don Cossack regiment, serving in an intelligence role due to his German language skills. Bunka served in the Battle of Berlin.

Their distinctive pottery and dwelling construction styles emerged in the area around 750 CE. Ancestral Pueblo peoples are renowned for the construction of and cultural achievement present at Pueblo Bonito and other sites in Chaco Canyon, as well as Mesa Verde, Aztec Ruins, and Salmon Ruins. *The Hohokam tradition, centered on the middle Gila River and lower Salt River drainage areas, and extending into the southern Sonoran Desert, is believed to have emerged in approximately 200 CE. These people lived in smaller settlement clusters than their neighbors, and built extensive irrigation canals for a wide range of agricultural crops. There is evidence the Hohokam had far- reaching trade routes with ancient Mesoamerican cultures to the south, and show cultural influences from these southerners. * Mogollon peoples lived in the southwest from approximately 200 CE until sometime between 1450 and 1540 CE. Mogollon archaeological sites are found in the Gila Wilderness, Mimbres River Valley, along the Upper Gila river, Paquime and Hueco Tanks, an area of low mountains between the Franklin Mountains to the west and the Hueco Mountains to the east. In addition, three distinct minor cultures inhabited the eastern, western, and northern extremes of the area. From 1200 CE into the historic era a people collectively known as the La Junta Indians lived at the junction of the Conchos River and Rio Grande on the border of Texas and Mexico.Miller, Myles R. and Kenmotsu, Nancy A. \\"Prehistory of the Mogollon and Eastern Trans-Pecos Regions of West Texas.\\" in Perttula, Timothy K. The Prehistory of Texas. College Station: TX A & M Press, 2004, pp. 205‚Äì265 Between 700 and 1550 CE, the Patayan culture inhabited parts of modern-day Arizona, California and Baja California. The Fremont culture inhabited sites in what is now Utah and parts of Nevada, Idaho and Colorado from 700 to 1300 CE. Culture Contemporary Pueblo Indians continue to be organized on a clan basis for pueblo activities and curing rituals. The clans of the eastern Pueblos are organized into the Summer people and the Winter people (Tanoans) or as the Turquoise people and the Squash people. The western Puebloans are organized into several matrilineal lineages and clans.

Producers of the film include Greg Boustead, Elliot Kirschner and Dan Rather. The film describes the gene editing process of CRISPR (an acronym for \\"Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats\\"), and premiered in Austin, Texas at the South by Southwest film conference and festival on March 10, 2019. Synopsis Human Nature is a film documentary which presents an in-depth description of the gene editing process of CRISPR, and its possible implications. The film describes the process from the perspective of the scientists who invented the process, and of the genetic engineers who are applying the process. The CRISPR process, a 2013 breakthrough in biology, provides a way of controlling the basic genetic processes of life, and may help cure diseases, and many more benefits to humankind and the human impact on the environment. In addition, the film documentary considers several relevant questions including, How will this new gene-editing ability change our relationship with nature? and, What will this new gene-editing ability mean for human evolution? The film, in beginning to answer such questions, presents a review of the distant past, and takes an educated look into the, perhaps, not-too-distant future. Participants The documentary film includes the following notable participants (alphabetized by last name): * David Baltimore ‚Äì American biologist * Jill Banfield ‚Äì American researcher * Rodolphe Barrangou ‚Äì American researcher * Alta Charo ‚Äì American bioethicist * Emmanuelle Charpentier ‚Äì French microbiologist * George M.

It's hopeful about CRISPR's ability to help us fix diseases that have plagued humans for millennia, while also questioning if we're ready to make genetic changes that'll affect us for generations to come.\\" Reviewer Danielle Solzman writes, \\"There‚Äôs a lot of science involved here. I can't stop but grow cautious when it comes to the Jurassic Park [film] comparisons. At the same time, I also want scientists to push for finding cures to cancer, MS, sickle cell anemia, etc. Maybe gene editing is one possible solution as Human Nature shows.\\" Film reviewer Sam Machkovech of Ars Technica asks, \\"[Does this film describe] the future of health? The future of a ... nightmare? By anchoring both of those extremes with a funny, human touch, Human Nature made me feel comfortable with a landing point somewhere closer to the middle.\\" Reviewer Sean Boelman notes, \\"Overall, Human Nature [is] an interesting and effective documentary.

It is a tall headdress that features two handfuls of hair, parted to each side of the head, sometimes with the addition of wire frames, extensions and ornamentation. Liangbatou was made famous by Empress Dowager Cixi and her Manchu court ladies, becoming popular and evolving starting from the Qing Dynasty through the Republican Period (1910-1940's). It was known nationally and internationally for its towering shape and ornamentation, and was influenced by the theatrical representations of non-Han ethnicities. It was used to reveal a woman's social and marital status, and became symbolic of Manchu identity. It was eventually used as imperial propaganda to show support for the Qing Dynasty and strengthen Manchu ties.  History  During the 19th century, the Manchu man's queue hairstyle was mocked and discarded around the world, and symbolize national shame by anti-Manchuism in China. Contrarily, the liangbatou captivated onlookers worldwide. Many were entranced by its size and the fact that it was not seen anywhere else in Asia. One of the most famous images of the liangbatou is shown in the postcard, ‚ÄúManchu Ladies‚Äù, photographed by John D. Zumbrum. It captures two ladies in Beijing wearing the headpiece while walking down a road. Empress Dowager Cixi wearing Liangbatou by Katherine A. Carl 1903 The earliest known depiction of this hairstyle was through the photography of John Thomson in 1894. Another known depiction was an unauthorized oil painting of Empress Cixi by Katherine A. Carl. In diplomatic paintings, it evolved from a simple hair arrangement, to reflecting purpose. The practice of wearing the liangbatou to diplomatic functions was started by Cixi and her court ladies. They would wear it paired with ceremonial robes as a satire on political views. It acted as a means of re- consolidation of power in spite of criticism. While the Qing dynasty failed to revive the headdress, it became increasingly popular on stage. Silang Tanmu (Fourth Son Visits his Mother) was the most famous play to feature the liangbatou. The headdress, which was once the Manchu's symbol of power became a comical prop.In theatrical shows, the image of the liangbatou worn by ‚Äúboy actresses‚Äù, served as imperial propaganda. The liangbatou then began to represent the customs, traditions and desire to reinstate the Qing to power. Unlike its predecessor the queue, the liangbatou became a symbol of the Manchu and continued to entice the curiosities of the population.  Material and style  The Liangbatou was originally created by twisting the wearer's hair up and around a flat strip (also known as the bianfang) usually consisting of ivory, wood or precious metal. Eventually, the liangbatou evolved from a hairstyle into a headpiece with added structural components. The hair was held together by silk cording. The satin follows the original direction of the hair. The headdress frame was wrapped with stiffened black satin, which gave it a defined angle and sharp edges. A wire-mesh base was placed atop the wearer's head for support. Because of the additional assistance from the wired frame, styles of the headdress became more decorative and elaborate. The bianfang began to evolve from function to fashion, allowing higher and wider headpieces that demonstrated social status. Particularly during the Qing Dynasty, the headpiece spread into a fan shape that sat on the wearer's head like a flat crown. It featured flowers like the peony and chrysanthemum and silk tassels. Court ladies usually preferred intricate floral arrangements with jade, pearl, coral and other stone. Common women preferred a more demure look that featured inlaid metals and velvet flowers. Hairpins used to attach the headdress often emphasized wealth and beauty. Jade and stone hairpins were usually worn by the wealthy, while commoners donned pins made of silver and bone. The liangbatou's two styles were the yizitou and the dalachi . The simpler yizitou takes after the Chinese character for ‚ÄúOne‚Äù. The more elaborate dalachi is the more elaborate, reflecting the character for ‚Äústretched wings‚Äù.  Culture  In the eyes of foreign visitors, the liangbatou marked the wearer as Manchu. The Liangbatou was distinctly different depending on group, class and region within the multi-ethnic Qing military social organization. This headdress combined Mongol and Chinese practices of adornment. Manchu women decorated their liangbatou with fresh and artificial flowers that made the headdresses significantly different from the Mongol's, which lacked flowery accessories. The Liangbatou did not appeal to all Chinese women, especially the Han. Cixi had been trying to downplay the difference between Han Chinese and Manchu because of the anti-Manchuism movement. After the Qing dynasty was overthrown in 1911, Manchu women adopted Han style clothing and adopted the Chinese chignon.  Modern entertainment  The Qing Dynasty is a popular subject in entertainment and media. Dramas such as Legend of Zhen Huan (2011) and My Fair Princess - Huan Zhu Ge Ge (1998) spread knowledge of the look of royal court ladies. Other dramas featuring this headdress include The Story of Yanxi Palace and Ruyi‚Äôs Royal Love in The Palace. These productions often used the styling of the Liangbatou to define the characters. For example, in Ruyi‚Äôs Royal Love in The Palace, Ruyi (the main character) wears simple liangbatou's when she first arrives at the forbidden city. As the plot develops, her personality changes and she rises in rank, while her liangbatou becomes more expensive, more complex and dramatic.

The bar has happy hour each weekday, as of 2016. In her 2013 walking guide of Portland, Becky Ohlsen described Kenton Club as \\"an excellent lowbrow hangout with a rocky facade, a wood-paneled interior, cheap drinks, live music, and a friendly, rowdy crowd\\". History The Kenton Club opened in 1947, and became a \\"honky-tonk and rumble-ready\\" biker bar shortly thereafter. In 1972, the venue appeared in Kansas City Bomber, starring Raquel Welch. The Kenton Club adopted the \\"world famous\\" tagline, and became known as the World Famous Kenton Club as a \\"permanent memorial\\" to the film and Welch. Memorabilia related to Kansas City Bomber and Welch are displayed throughout the venue. Daryl and Doreen Waitt purchased the business in 2006.

Reception Memorabilia and merchandise displayed inside the venue, 2018 The Oregonian Seth Lorinczi described Kenton Club as \\"lovably shabby\\" and said \\"its notoriety derives from weekend country and rockabilly acts\\". In his 2008 review of Smoky Mountain BBQ, Lorinczi quipped about the venue and its clientele, \\"Brave dim lighting and aged tipplers, or slink back to the cave with your kill.\\" In her 2019 book Walking Portland, Becky Ohlsen said the Kenton Club has a \\"charming bravado\\". Barbara Mitchell of the Portland Tribune wrote in her 2007 review, \\"Drinks are stiff, cheap and simple for the most part ‚Äì after all, this is a watering hole that pours its wine out of a box. If you're craving an artisan cocktail, you'd be in the Pearl District, not here.\\" She said the bar has a \\"fantastic neighborhood feel\\" and \\"welcoming atmosphere\\", opining: > The World Famous Kenton Club does a fantastic job of maintaining a no-fuss > honky-tonk vibe, and it's easy to imagine Willie Nelson and a passel of pals > meeting up here for an afternoon beer, a late night hootenanny or a morning > constitutional... Leave any pretensions you've been carrying on the sidewalk > before you step into the dark and laid-back environs. The world has enough > hipsters: The World Famous Kenton Club is an establishment whose coolness > cannot be co-opted, and whose vibe-y atmosphere may have been immortalized > but can't be duplicated. Chris Sutton of The Portland Mercury described the Kenton Club as a \\"special kind of time machine taking you back to much simpler days‚Äîwhen there were fewer beer choices and hairy-chested macho men like Burt Reynolds were considered gods\\". He said the venue \\"straddles the line between public house amenity and dimly lit seediness so well\\", and its video poker machines \\"only [add] to the charm of a classic watering hole dripping with historic sentimentality\\". The venue is ranked number 94 on Willamette Week list of Portland's \\"100 best bars\\". Zach Middleton quipped, \\"Get here soon, or don't. Neither Raquel Welch nor the day patrons give a shit.\\" In 2017, the newspaper's Matthew Korfhage called Kenton \\"one of Portland's last bars to still have hair on its chest and a swagger in its boots\\". He wrote, \\"The beer is cheap, the music's almost always free from Thursday to Sunday, and somebody's always spilled some beer. It used to be a bit more rough-and-ready in here, but even slightly cleaned up for the new karaoke-and-game-night crowds, it remains lovingly imperfect in every way that matters.\\" Historic District The ornamental concrete block building is located within the Kenton Commercial Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places. It was built in 1949 by the Kenton Building and Contracting Company and designed by Swift & Company. The building as constructed would have made it a Contributing Property to the historic district had its exterior not been significantly modified. Exterior tile work, removal of storefronts, and the covering of some windows have \\"damaged its historic integrity\\", causing it to be classified as \\"historic noncontributing\\".

For a long time it was known as the Sydney Art School. The Julian Ashton Art School building, and some of its equipment, have been heritage listed, in part due to the significance of the school itself. History After Julian Ashton died in 1942, the school was run by Henry Gibbons (1884‚Äì1972). Henry Gibbons had started at the school as a student in April 1919 and soon became the teacher of the night drawing classes. In 1924 Gibbons proposed starting a Saturday afternoon class so that he could teach some of the night drawing students to paint. The Saturday class started in February 1924 and the first nine students were Dobell, Dundas, Passmore, Badham, Lawrence, Brackenreg, Byrne, Hubble and Cox. Gibbons taught many winners of the NSW Traveling Arts Scholarship. Henry Gibbons retired in 1960. Henry King showing members of the Society of Artists' 1907 Selection Committee, including Julian Ashton (far left) and Norman Lindsay (fifth from left) Howard Ashton's son, J. Richard Ashton, and his wife Wenda ran the School from 1960, when, among many gifted artists, Ian Chapman and Archibald Prize winner Francis Giacco attended, until 1977 when Phillip Ashton (Richard's son) became Principal, this being the time of Hadyn Wilson, political cartoonist Bill Leak and artist Paul Newton. In 1988 the school was incorporated and Paul Delprat, Julian Ashton's great-grandson, himself an ex- student took over the running of the school, becoming the current Principal. In 1989 the school's antique casts and easels, which date back to 1890, were classified by the National Trust. The school's main campus is in The Rocks, Sydney, located opposite the Museum of Contemporary Art Australia at 117-119 George Street, The Rocks. The building is listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register. Since 2004 the school has also conducted classes at Headland Park, Georges Heights, Mosman. Scholarships The School currently offers: * The Sir William Dobell * Brett Whiteley * John Olsen * Thea Proctor * Portrait Artists Australia * Sydney Mechanics' School of Arts * The Art Express :scholarships to encourage fine drawing and painting. Notable alumni Julian Ashton students have included Elioth Gruner, George Lambert, B. E. Minns, Thea Proctor, Adrian Feint, Howard Ashton (Julian's son), Dorrit Black, J. J. Hilder, William Dobell, Edmund Arthur Harvey, Eric Wilson, Jean Bellette, Douglas Dundas, Arthur Freeman, William Dadswell, John Passmore, Yvonne Audette, Joshua Smith, John Olsen, Michael Johnston, Jim Russell, Florence Turner Blake, Sydney Ure Smith, Alexander McKenzie, Brett Whiteley, Susan Dorothea White, Nigel Thomson, Nora Heysen, Salvatore Zofrea, Helen Stewart, Madge Tennent, and Anne Dangar. The poet Lola Ridge (1873-1941) also studied with Julian Ashton. Recognising the early talent of Ray Wenban, Ashton taught him gratis, helping him become a respected and successful painter and illustrator.

Biography Born in Paris on 5 November 1815, Blanche Feillet was the daughter of the painter and lithographer Pierre Jacques Feillet (1794‚Äì1855) and H√©l√®ne Pernotin. On 24 January 1844, she married Charles Henry Firmin Hennebutte, a publisher, with whom she had two children: Henri Joseph Ernest (1845) and Pierre Louis Gaston (1856). She moved to Madrid with her family in 1829 before settling in Bayonne in 1834. Unlike her sister H√©l√®ne, she was more of a lithographer than a painter. She did nevertheless exhibit in the Paris Salon in 1841 with \\"Vue d‚Äôun moulin pr√®s de Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port\\" and in 1848 with \\"Naufrage dans les rochers de Biarritz pr√®s de Bayonne\\" and \\"Vue de l‚Äôentr√©e de la Barre de Bayonne\\".

A Super NES version with the same golf courses, titled Jack Nicklaus Golf, was released in May 1992. It is the second in a series of golf games named after golfer Jack Nicklaus, following Jack Nicklaus' Greatest 18 Holes of Major Championship Golf (1988). The game includes a golf course designer that allows the player to create customized courses. The computer version was praised for its graphics and course designer, although reviewers criticized the long reanimation times in each version of the game. It was followed by Jack Nicklaus Golf & Course Design: Signature Edition (1992). Gameplay The game includes the real-life Muirfield Village and the fictional game-only course \\"The Bear's Track,\\" both designed by Nicklaus. Unlike its predecessor, the game also includes a golf course designer, allowing the player to create a customized course. Three vacant plots exist for the player to create custom courses, and the two existing courses can also be edited. In designing courses, the player can choose between three types: mountainside, parkside, and seaside. The course designer features various options, including hills, valleys, trees, and lakes. The player can also create custom backgrounds for the courses. Several add-on disks, released for the game and its predecessor, can be used to add additional golf courses. Courses created with Jack Nicklaus' Unlimited Golf & Course Design can be imported into the subsequent game, Jack Nicklaus Golf & Course Design: Signature Edition. Game modes include skins and stroke, and the player can choose to rewind a poor golf shot and try it again. The golfer is viewed from a third-person perspective, and each hole starts with an overhead angle above the course which allows the player to view the distance to the hole. The game informs the player of the distance to the hole, and offers a selection of golf clubs. A power bar along the left side of the screen controls the shot. Jack Nicklaus appears in the game to give advice to the player before each hole, and the game provides an option to view each shot through a reverse-angle replay. The Super NES version features the same courses and a course designer. It also includes a password feature, and a replay option with various angles. Release Jack Nicklaus' Unlimited Golf & Course Design was released in the United States in June 1990, for the Amiga and MS-DOS. Jack Nicklaus was involved in the game's design. The game was accompanied by a 224-page guide book, The Official Guide to Jack Nicklaus Computer Golf, which gives advice on course design. The book was published by Compute Publications and written by Mark Harrison, with a foreword by Nicklaus. The Super NES version, titled Jack Nicklaus Golf, was released in the United States in May 1992. It was published by Tradewest, along with an unrelated Game Boy version also titled Jack Nicklaus Golf. The Amiga version received a budget re-release in 1994, published by Action Sixteen. Reception The computer version received praise for its graphics and course designer. Jeff Prosise of PC Magazine considered it to be \\"the best, most realistic golf simulation on the market\\", and praised the sound and various game options. PC Magazines Jonathan Matzkin ranked it among the magazine's compilation of the best games of 1990. Amazing Computing considered the game superior to its 1988 predecessor, praising the \\"nicer\\" graphics and stating that they load faster than the previous game, although others criticized the slow reanimation. Albert Kim of Sports Illustrated considered the game entertaining and praised the course designer, but stated that the designer took some time to master, with the instruction manual being 156 pages long. Boston Herald called it \\"one of the best computer golf games available,\\" and praised its add-on course disks. Michael J. Himowitz of The Baltimore Evening Sun praised the gameplay, realistic courses, and various camera angles. Tom Malcom of .info considered it to be the best golf game available up to that time. The Super NES version was also criticized for slow reanimation; Jonathan Davies of Super Play stated that because the \\"nice\\" graphics take so long to animate, the game was \\"virtually unplayable.\\" N-Force praised the digitized graphics and the replay options of the Super NES version, but stated that the game needed more holes, while reviewers for Electronic Gaming Monthly considered the game to be average. Several critics reviewed the game's Amiga re-release. Amiga Action considered the graphics to be average and stated that it was \\"far too easy to mess a shot up.\\" The magazine further wrote that the game possibly had the thickest instruction manual ever for a golfing game, with more than half of it devoted to the course designer, and stated that designing courses would be fun, but \\"the long wait for the whole thing to activate isn't worth it.\\" Jonathan Davies, then writing for Amiga Power, stated that the course designer \\"works undeniably well,\\" but that it would only appeal to hardcore golfers. Davies considered PGA Tour and Nick Faldo's Championship Golf to be superior games. Tony Dillon of CU Amiga criticized the graphics for being blocky, simple, and repetitive. Dillon also criticized the gameplay, writing that it alternated between too easy and too difficult. The One Amiga praised the game's graphics and various options, including the course designer, but criticized the sluggish controls and inconsistent shot accuracy.

Biography Zundelevich grew up in a lower middle class Jewish family in a small town in the Oshmyany uyezd of the Vilna Governorate. He studied at the Vilna Rabbinical School until 1873, where he organized a revolutionary circle whose members included Aaron Liebermann and Abraham Cahan. Zundelevich later joined the Circle of Tchaikovsky in St. Petersburg and, as a founding member of the secret society Land and Liberty, he advocated the use of terror as a means of political struggle. He fled to K√∂nigsberg and Berlin in 1875 under the threat of arrest, but soon returned to Russia illegally. On 30 June 1876, Zundelevich participated in the organization of Peter Kropotkin's escape from the Nikolaev Military Hospital. The following year, Zundelevich began to organize the import of illegal literature and printing equipment to St. Petersburg and organized a clandestine \\"free press\\" to spread Narodnik propaganda. He joined the Russian revolutionary group Narodnaya Volya, soon becoming an elected member of its Executive Committee, responsible for relations with foreign groups and the dissemination of revolutionary publications. Zundelevich participated in the assassination attempt of Sergey Kravchinsky on Nikolay Mezentsov on 4 August 1878 and the preparation of Alexander Soloviev's attempt on the life of Alexander II on 2 April 1879. Zundelevich was arrested in the National Library on 28 October 1879 and sentenced in the October 1880 Trial of the Sixteen to indefinite hard labour. He was imprisoned in the Peter and Paul Fortress, and thereafter in the Kara and Akatuy katorga prisons. He was released after the 1905 Russian Revolution, and emigrated to England in 1907.

In 2015, he was elected deputy of the National Assembly from Vargas. He is the president of the National Assembly's Health Subcommission, where he has spearheaded the National Health Crisis Provision Law and directed humanitarian aid to counteract the effects of the medicine shortage in Venezuela. He is also the president of the Permanent Commission on Integral Family Development. Olivares has been a major figure in the opposition movement against the government of Nicol√°s Maduro. In June 2018, Olivares and his family fled to Colombia, where he has helped direct the shipment of humanitarian aid to Venezuela. Early life Jos√© Manuel Olivares was born in the San Jos√© de Maiquet√≠a Hospital in Maiquet√≠a, Vargas on 19 August 1985. He is the son of Maiquet√≠a native Jos√© Manuel Olivares Corredor and Luc√≠a Marquina, a native of 23 de Enero in Caracas. Olivares had a tranquil childhood until 1999, when the flooding and landslides of the Vargas tragedy wiped out most of the state's infrastructure. The Olivares family home in the Los Corales housing development was destroyed in the disaster. Olivares attended the Franciscan school Colegio Divina Providencia and the Colegio San Vicente de Pa√∫l. Olivares initially studied biochemistry at the Central University of Venezuela, but transitioned to studying medicine in 2004. After graduating in 2010, Olivares spent his mandatory year of military service working in a clinic in Tacarigua de Mamporal, Miranda. In 2013, he began his postgraduate studies at the Hospital Cl√≠nico Universitario in Caracas, specializing in oncology, radiation therapy and nuclear medicine. Student movement of 2007 As president of the Student Center at the Central University of Venezuela's medical school, Olivares helped create the biggest student movement since the Generation of 1928. The students demonstrated against excessive red tape, advocating for Internet access, fair schedules for students, updates to the school's technology and increased access to books. Olivares took to the streets in peaceful protest together with other leaders like Yon Goicoechea, Stalin Gonz√°lez, Miguel Pizarro, Ricardo S√°nchez Mujica, Freddy Guevara and David Smolansky. The students demanded freedom of expression and rejected constitutional reforms by president Hugo Ch√°vez. Political career Olivares was a candidate of A New Era for Vargas state governorship in 2012, supported by other MUD parties; he lost to the incumbent governor Jorge Garc√≠a Carneiro by a large margin. Olivares won the deputy seat in the 2015 parliamentary elections on 6 December 2016. He assumed office on 5 January 2016. After taking office, Olivares was immediately elected to lead the Health Subcommission. Olivares used his position to highlight the poor conditions of Venezuelan hospitals, including shortages of medicine and medical and surgical supplies. He helped implement the approval of the National Assembly's Health and Humanitarian Crisis Declaration Agreement. Olivares traveled to Washington D.C. to formally petition the World Health Organization to provide medicines in the form of humanitarian aid and to give Venezuela access to the WHO's Strategic Fund. In 2016, the National Assembly passed the Special Law to Address the National Health Crisis, which established parameters for defining when shortages would become critical and which organizations would be able to request humanitarian aid. The law was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Tribunal of Justice. The same year, there was an increase in cases of malaria in Venezuela and diseases like diphtheria reappeared. This health crisis spawned debates over the scope of legislative powers in situations like Venezuela's public health crisis. As a consequence, the Assembly approved various healthcare accords to address the health crisis. Olivares was the main voice advocating for these accords in the Assembly. In addition to legislative action, Jos√© Manuel Olivares has been a main organizer of events like the Marcha de los R√©cipes, where patients marched to the Apostolic Nunciature to Venezuela, demanding access to humanitarian aid. In 2017, Olivares became a candidate in Vargas regional elections again, being a Justice First candidate supported by other MUD parties without primaries, by consensus. He lost election to governor Garc√≠a Carneiro for the second time in a row but by a much lesser margin this time compared to 2012. On May 10, 2017, after more than 30 days of demonstrations in Venezuela, the Venezuelan National Guard shot and killed Miguel Castillo, a 27-year-old demonstrator. Olivares denounced the shooting on Twitter, calling it an assassination. In 2017, Olivares' brother was detained and jailed for several months. In July 2018, a SEBIN agent informed Olivares that the intelligence agency would arrest his family if he did not cease his political activities. On 19 July 2018, Olivares and his family fled Venezuela for Colombia. After Juan Guaid√≥ declared himself Venezuela's Acting President, Olivares began assisting Guaid√≥ in his efforts to bring humanitarian aid to Venezuela.

The first game, Jack Nicklaus' Greatest 18 Holes of Major Championship Golf, was developed by Sculptured Software and published by Accolade. It was released for various platforms beginning in 1988. Accolade would publish subsequent games in the series for the next decade, before selling the rights to Activision in 1998. Activision published a sixth game in the series, Jack Nicklaus 6: Golden Bear Challenge, in 1999, but chose not to publish a sequel due to poor sales. The next game in the series, Jack Nicklaus Perfect Golf, was released by a new company in 2016. Games Jack Nicklaus' Greatest 18 Holes of Major Championship Golf (1988) Jack Nicklaus' Greatest 18 Holes of Major Championship Golf was developed by Sculptured Software and published by Accolade for various platforms beginning in 1988. It was released for Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Apple II, Atari ST, Commodore 64, MS-DOS, Macintosh, MSX, Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), PC-88, Sharp X68000, and TurboGrafx-16. A Game Boy version, titled Jack Nicklaus Golf, was released in 1992; it was published by Tradewest, which also released an unrelated game with the same title for the Super NES. The game features Jack Nicklaus' favorite 18 golf holes, all put together in a single course, which includes holes from Augusta National Golf Club, Muirfield, Pebble Beach Golf Links, Royal Lytham & St Annes Golf Club, and Old Course at St Andrews. Two courses designed by Nicklaus are also featured in the game: Castle Pines (Colorado) and Desert Mountain (Arizona). Additionally, the Game Boy version includes Muirfield Village as a course. Add-on disks Between 1989 and 1991, several add-on computer disks were released for Jack Nicklaus' Greatest 18 Holes of Major Championship Golf and Jack Nicklaus' Unlimited Golf & Course Design, adding additional golf courses and features. The disks are compatible with both games. * Jack Nicklaus Presents the Major Championship Courses of 1989 adds courses from major 1989 golf championships: Oak Hill Country Club (1989 U.S. Open), Royal Troon Golf Club (1989 Open Championship), and Kemper Lakes Golf Club (1989 PGA Championship). Compute! praised the courses for their realistic difficulty, and Paul Statt of inCider rated the disk 4 out of 5. * Jack Nicklaus Presents the International Course Disk (1990) adds three courses designed by Nicklaus: The Australian Golf Club, St. Creek Golf Club (Japan), and St. Mellion Golf & Country Club. * Jack Nicklaus Presents the Major Championship Courses of 1990 adds Medinah Country Club (1990 U.S. Open), Old Course at St Andrews (1990 Open Championship), and Shoal Creek Club (1990 PGA Championship). * Jack Nicklaus Presents the Great Courses of the U.S. Open (1991) adds Pebble Beach Golf Links, Oakmont Country Club, and Baltusrol Golf Club, all of which had previously hosted U.S. Open championships. * Jack Nicklaus Presents the Major Championship Courses of 1991 adds Royal Birkdale Golf Club (1991 Open Championship), Hazeltine National Golf Club (1991 U.S. Open), and Crooked Stick Golf Club (1991 PGA Championship). Alan Dykes of CU Amiga rated the disk 78 percent and stated that it added nothing new aside from the courses. He criticized the game's copy protection and its slow reanimation. Computist rated it three stars out of five. * Jack Nicklaus' Course Designers Clip Art Volume 1 (1991) was released as an add-on disk for Jack Nicklaus' Unlimited Golf & Course Design with various features. The disk includes a new course, Desert Highlands (Arizona), and allows the player to add three new environments to custom golf courses, including a desert atmosphere. The disk includes nine new backgrounds and more than 70 objects, such as trees, rocks, animals, fountains, and golf carts. Computist rated it three stars out of five. Jack Nicklaus' Unlimited Golf & Course Design (1990) Jack Nicklaus' Unlimited Golf & Course Design was developed by Sculptured Software and published by Accolade in June 1990, for the Amiga and MS-DOS. The game includes the real-life Muirfield Village and the fictional game-only course \\"The Bear's Track,\\" both designed by Nicklaus. The game also includes a golf course designer, allowing the player to create a customized course. A Super NES version with the same golf courses, titled Jack Nicklaus Golf, was released in May 1992. Jack Nicklaus Golf & Course Design: Signature Edition (1992) Jack Nicklaus Golf & Course Design: Signature Edition was developed by Sculptured Software and published by Accolade on March 31, 1992, for MS-DOS. Following Access Software's introduction of the Links series, the Jack Nicklaus series lost a significant number of players, prompting Accolade to release a new game with improved graphics and additional course designer options. Accolade advertised it as the third game in the series. Following the game's release, Accolade renewed its agreement with Jack Nicklaus to continue producing golf games with his name into the mid-1990s. The game includes strokes and skin, as well as three difficulty levels. The game features two golf courses, English Turn and Sherwood Country Club, and courses created with Jack Nicklaus' Unlimited Golf & Course Design can be imported into Signature Edition. The game offered online tournaments through Prodigy. Jack Nicklaus' Power Challenge Golf, a scaled-down version of Jack Nicklaus Golf & Course Design: Signature Edition, was released for the Sega Genesis in 1993. It excludes the course designer feature, but includes English Turn and Sherwood Country Club, as well as Baltusrol Golf Club. Two add-on disks, Jack Nicklaus Signature Tour Vol. 1 and Jack Nicklaus Signature Tour Vol. 2, provide additional courses for the MS-DOS version. In 1995, both disks were re-released along with Signature Edition as a compilation titled Jack Nicklaus: The Tour Collection. Cancelled game (1990s) Jack Nicklaus Golf‚ÄìCDTV was announced by Accolade in June 1991, during the Summer Consumer Electronics Show. It was to be released for the Commodore CDTV during the third quarter of 1991. The game would have featured Muirfield Village, created from over 9,000 digitized images taken of the course. The process required a group of more than 30 photographers and technicians, and the photographs, taken from all angles, would be rendered in 4,096 colors. The player would be able to choose from five golf partners, including Jack Nicklaus, who could also be an opponent. Nicklaus would be featured through digitized imaging. Chris Bankston was the game's producer. As of June 1992, there were still plans to release the game on the CDTV. In June 1994, Atari announced during the Consumer Electronics Show that the game would be released on its new Atari Jaguar CD, under the title Jack Nicklaus Cyber Golf. The game would now include full motion video of Nicklaus and other golfers, and would feature commentary from David Livingstone, who would also provide advice to the player. The game was expected to be released in early 1995. As of January 1995, the game had an expected U.S. release date in the late spring. The project was ultimately scrapped for being unacceptable. A prototype of the game, in Jaguar cartridge format, had become available by 2019. It features a few basic menu screens and limited music, as well as a single playable hole of golf. Jack Nicklaus 4 (1997) Jack Nicklaus 4 was developed by Cinematronics and published by Accolade in March 1997, for Microsoft Windows. Development was underway as of January 1995, and the game was developed for Microsoft Windows due to the operating system's increased prevalence. Macintosh and DVD versions were also released. A PlayStation version, titled Jack Nicklaus '98 and featuring the same courses as Jack Nicklaus 4, had been scheduled for release in late 1997, although it was never released. Jack Nicklaus 4 includes eight different game modes and a course designer. The game features five 18-hole courses, including four real-life courses: Muirfield Village, Colleton River Plantation, Country Club of the South and Cabo del Sol. The fifth course is Winding Springs, a fictional location created by the developers using the game's course designer. The game includes the ability to import and convert online user-created golf courses from Jack Nicklaus Golf & Course Design: Signature Edition, and courses created in Jack Nicklaus 4 are compatible with the game's sequel, Jack Nicklaus 5. Jack Nicklaus 4 received positive reviews, but sold poorly. Jack Nicklaus Online Golf Tour (1998) Jack Nicklaus Online Golf Tour was developed by Hypnos Entertainment, and was released online in 1998. The game, originally titled Jack Nicklaus 4 Online, was announced in December 1996. Accolade unveiled a partnership with Aries Online Games, owned by Kesmai, to publish the game as an online multiplayer version of Accolade's then-upcoming computer game, Jack Nicklaus 4. The game would differ from the retail version as it would feature online tournaments. The game was originally expected to be released by mid-1997. It would be the first tournament-based golf game played across the Internet, and Accolade stated that over 1,000 people would be able to play the game simultaneously. A beta tournament had been scheduled for July 1997, but did not occur as expected. The game was later planned for release in November 1997, alongside Jack Nicklaus 5. Ultimately, the game was launched on Kesmai's GameStorm website in April 1998. It was based on the Jack Nicklaus 4 game engine, and online courses created with Jack Nicklaus 4 were playable through Jack Nicklaus Online Golf Tour. The game featured more than 100 downloadable courses for players to compete on, and featured an option to play foursomes. Accolade remained involved in the game, despite selling the series rights to Accolade that year. At the time of its release, Stephen Poole of GameSpot praised the game as \\"the fastest and smoothest golf action on the Internet, along with a wonderful community of friendly players.\\" However, he stated it would be nice if GameStorm offered prizes for the game, \\"even if they're just a putter or tickets to a PGA event.\\" The game was released on AOL's Games Channel in November 1998. Tournaments included: * Global Internet Golf Invitational, held in July 1998 and played on the game's Muirfield Village course. * Jack Nicklaus Spring Golf Tour, held in April 1999 as a collaboration between Kesmai, AOL, and CBS SportsLine. * 1999 Jack Nicklaus Online Golf Championship, presented by Comfort Inn, which jointly developed it with GameStorm and Jack Nicklaus Productions. The championship was expected to take place over two months, beginning in November 1999. It would be set across four of the game's courses. It was the largest Internet golf tournament, with more than 11,000 players signing up for it. * NFL Players Online Golf Challenge, a three-day tournament held in January 2000, with 11 teams competing for NFL-related prizes, including tickets to a real golf tournament played by active NFL players. The online tournament was jointly created by Kesmai and the NFL Players Golf Club. Jack Nicklaus 5 (1997) Jack Nicklaus 5 was developed by Eclipse Entertainment and published by Accolade in November 1997, for Windows 95. Eclipse's development team included members of the Cinematronics team that worked on Jack Nicklaus 4. Jack Nicklaus 5 has several gameplay modes, including a tournament mode. It also includes a course designer. Unlike previous games, the course designer in Jack Nicklaus 5 allows players to import customized graphics and sound effects. The course designer was also backwards compatible with Jack Nicklaus 4 courses. The game features 10 courses, each with 18 holes. Five of the courses are from the previous game, while new real-life courses include Hualalai Resort Golf Club (Hawaii), South Shore Golf Club (Lake Las Vegas), and Mount Juliet Golf Course (Ireland). The game's two other courses are original designs created with the course designer. Five of the real-life courses featured in the game were designed by Nicklaus. Like its predecessor, Jack Nicklaus 5 received positive reviews but sold poorly. It was the last Jack Nicklaus game published by Accolade, which, after 10 years, sold the rights to Activision in April 1998, to focus primarily on action games. Jack Nicklaus 6: Golden Bear Challenge (1999) Jack Nicklaus 6: Golden Bear Challenge was developed by Hypnos Entertainment and published by Activision in March 1999, for Microsoft Windows. Mike Franco, who produced Jack Nicklaus 4 and Jack Nicklaus 5, began working on a new game in the series in November 1997, when the latter game was released. After Activision purchased the series rights in April 1998, the company hired Hypnos Entertainment to develop the series' next game. Hypnos Entertainment was made up of team members who worked on earlier Jack Nicklaus games, including Jack Nicklaus Online Golf Tour. Full work on the new game began in April 1998, after the sale was complete and after Franco joined Hypnos Entertainment. Jack Nicklaus 6: Golden Bear Challenge received mostly positive reviews, with an 86 percent rating on GameRankings. However, the game sold poorly, prompting Activision not to publish a sequel. The game's title is a reference to Nicklaus' nickname, \\"Golden Bear.\\" It is the first game in the series that allows the player to play as Jack Nicklaus. The game features six golf courses, all recreations of real courses: Shoal Creek, Muirfield Village, Montecastillo, Sherwood Country Club, Cochise at Desert Mountain, and Nicklaus North in Whistler, British Columbia. In addition to the game's six golf courses, nearly 300 compatible courses from the previous game were also available online when Jack Nicklaus 6 was released. The golf courses featured in the game were designed by Nicklaus in real life. The game also includes a golf course designer. Jack Nicklaus Perfect Golf (2016) Jack Nicklaus Perfect Golf was developed by Perfect Parallel, and was released for Linux, macOS and Microsoft Windows through Steam in 2016. Perfect Parallel was primarily a golf services company, and it previously released the game as Perfect Golf in January 2015, through Early Access on Steam, before releasing Jack Nicklaus Perfect Golf on Steam on May 3, 2016. Jack Nicklaus Perfect Golf featured 12 courses upon its release, including the real Bethesda Country Club in Bethesda, Maryland. The game features 20 game modes, including match, skins, stroke, better ball, foursome, and scramble. The game also includes a multiplayer option. At the time of its release, there were plans to eventually allow players to create their own modes, which could also be shared with others. Polygon described the game's 2016 release as \\"a strangely low-key launch\\" considering it was \\"a sports title with such a big name attached to it.\\" A course of Jack Nicklaus' Muirfield Village was released for the game in June 2016. Other real-life courses had been created by the company and were expected to be added into the game later in the year. The company expected to release the game for Xbox One by the end of 2016, and discussions were also held about releasing it for PlayStation 4.

Transgender women are excluded from the military of South Korea.  History  There have been multiple historical obstacles imposed on transgender people within the South Korean military service. South Korea does not criminalize LGBT citizens, and it does not have discriminatory laws in place other than those disallowing same sex couples to marry or adopt children. There are also no laws in place to protect LGBT people from work discrimination or hate crimes. When transgender individuals seek to legally change their gender, they must provide proof they are unmarried, do not have minor children, and have parental consent, no matter their age. Another step in legal gender change is the process of medical and psychological examination. Courts rely almost exclusively on this examination to proceed with the change. Medical examinations and treatment are not covered by health insurance, and few facilities offer specific treatment for transgender people. Transgender self- identification visibly emerged in the 2000s after Korean singer Harisu publicly came out as a transgender woman. Although there was a dramatic emergence in the 2000s, transgender identity can be traced back to the 1950s. In earlier history, transgender was referred to as \\"y≈èjangnamja\\", which translates to \\"men in women's clothes\\", and \\"chungs≈èng\\", which translates to \\"gender neutral\\". Systematic discrimination against LGBTQ people has occurred in various ways. As an example, under hojuje, family members were defined by their relationship to the head of the household, which was always a male figure. The Family Relations Register replaced hojuje as the legal system of identity in 2008. They dictate gender roles, specifically women's roles as mothers and sisters. The Resident Registration System establishes three parts of a citizen's legal identification. It establishes their birthday, place of origin, and gender. Gender is a binary code of either 1, indicating male, or 2, indicating female. This numeric code serves as a form of legal identification and is unchangeable. However, if a transgender person obtains a change of their legal gender, they can petition to have their Family Register number changed. Transgender people who are unable to change their legal gender and ID number face problems, such as finding work and accessing services. Legally recognized gender identity in South Korea is binary, as determined by the male/female designation of the Resident Registration System. There are no other legal gender classifications found in other countries, such as India. In 2013, a court ruled that transgender individuals did not need to have gender reassignment surgeries to legally change their gender. During this time, requests by transgender individuals to change their Family Register number to reflect their gender were filed. Few were actually granted.  Policies  According to Timothy Gitzen, the need for compulsory military service comes from \\"a Cold War binary\\". In this case, the perceived threat of North Korea created the perceived need for mandatory military service. The military institution interconnects with the institutions of family, education and healthcare to shape citizens' perceptions of sex and gender and, in the process, marginalize transgender bodies. The military can be viewed as a rite of passage to manhood and more importantly, citizenship in terms of nationality and belonging. Compulsory military service allows the military system to control male-presenting bodies. Militarization masculinity in South Korea follows men's lives before and after serving in the military. For trans bodies, serving in the military is a matter of life or death, not just from the actual dangers of serving in dangerous conditions but also because in forcing trans bodies into the molds of soldiers, the military erases and separates trans bodies from their true identities.  Discriminatory policies  LGBT discriminatory laws do not exist in the South Korean government, except within the military. The South Korean military does actively discriminate against non-binary people and does criminalize same-sex relations, while policies surrounding transgender rights are generally vague. Article 92 in the Korean Military Penal Code is about rape and indecent acts. Section 6 is an anti-sodomy clause that criminalizes and punishes consensual same-sex sexual relationships. The policy explains that anal intercourse is punishable by law for up to two years. The government continuously defends Article 92-6 by explaining that by prohibiting indecent behavior, they are able to maintain discipline among the predominantly male military. Amnesty International has lamented that Article 92-6 is viewed by the military as a \\"tacit permission to target LGBT people inside and outside the military.\\" In 2005, eight soldiers were discharged for being gay. Determining who is gay and who is not is determined through doctor diagnosis and information from fellow soldiers who may have seen someone involved in same-sex sexual activities. Men who wish to evade the military because they are gay may even be asked to provide photographic evidence, an invasion of privacy. Article 92-6 does not explicitly mention transgender people. However, not all transgender people have gender reassignment surgeries (GRS). The policy would apply to gay transgender men and heterosexual transgender women who have not had gender reassignment surgeries. The extent of the policy is unknown.  Body examinations  Biological male conscripts' bodies are closely examined by the Military Man Power Administration. Various types of doctors and specialists from neurologists to dermatologists work together to examine men's bodies. The Draft Physical Examination in 1978, introduced \\"sexual perversion\\" and later became \\"gender identity disorder\\" to determine physical and mental disabilities. If trans people have already been examined by medical professionals, they have to provide either a court decision or their entire physical examination report thus far that proves that they are, in fact, transgender. There is emphasis on medical proof that transgender people are expected to have to validate their existence.  Transgender women  According to Gitzen, transgender women \\"pose a dilemma\\" because they go against the conscription of men. Transgender women have only two options: to gain full exemption or serve as \\"men\\". Transgender women that have not had any gender-confirmation surgeries are required to serve in the military, as men. Sexual anatomy and being able-bodied are important determining factors for conscription. When the military is faced with transitioning bodies that do not perfectly fit normalized ideas of sex and gender, they base decisions solely on anatomy. Transgender women who have not undergone gender reassignment surgery are expected to serve and are subject to body examinations. Due to the high cost of surgeries, many trans women cannot be exempt by way of legal gender change. One way to gain exemption would be if they were diagnosed with severe gender identity disorder by a military doctor. Exemption can also be granted when there is extensive medical proof of gender identity disorder and \\"treatment\\". One other way of exemption is the irreversible orchiectomy surgery, which is the removal of the testicles, to achieve objective feminization. Irreversible surgery as a method of exemption is considered unethical and a coercive act of body mutilation. Between 2012 and 2015, 104 transgender women were exempt based on \\"testicle loss\\" and only 21 transgender women were exempt from service based on gender identity disorder. The irreversible surgery tends to occur when trans women are in their early 20s, giving them little time to think and decide if that is what they actually want. Trans women serving as \\"men\\" are assigned to second eligible conscription status, also known as de facto exemption, in the military.  Transgender men  Transgender men who have legally changed their name are assigned to the service called second eligible conscription status, a lower ranking than their cisgender, male counterparts. This is because they are considered \\"disabled\\" and their bodies are seen as less valuable. Trans men are presumed to be less masculine and not fit to serve in active duty, even if they wished to do so. Sometimes, trans men serve in the military, rather than seek exemption, to prove their masculinity.

Biography Born in 1899 in Aurora, Illinois, Haffer and her family moved to the utopian community of Home in South Puget Sound in Washington state in 1907. When she was 15 years old Haffer became the apprentice of the photographer Harriette H. Ihrig. She opened her own portrait photography studio in Tacoma, Washington and began publishing her photographs in 1924. Haffer was known for experimenting with unusual, quirky techniques and created her own artistic style that stretched the boundaries of artistic classifications in the early twentieth century. Haffer's work was eccentric; she produced pictorialist, modern, surreal, and documentary style work. Haffer was married three times, the second time to socialist and labor advocate Paul Raymond Haffer, with whom she had one son, Jean Paul Haffer. One of her works as a commercial photographic portraitist was a childhood picture of future glass artist Dale Chihuly. Haffer's work was first exhibited in 1924 in the Fifth Annual F&N; Salon of Pictorial Photography, and in 1928 at the Seattle Camera Club's Fourth International Exhibition. By 1930 her work was internationally recognized, and often appeared in publications such as the American Annual of Photography. In addition, she won recognition and prizes in photographic competitions in the United States in the 1930s.Sandler, Martin W., Against The Odds: Women Pioneers in The First Hundred Years Of Photography. St. Martins Press, 2002. In the 1960s she took an interest in producing photograms, and in 1969 she published a book about the process called Making Photograms: The Creative Process of Painting With Light. Haffer's work was also the subject of several solo exhibitions at locations including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1960; California Museum of Science and Industry, Los Angeles, 1964; New York Camera Club, 1967 and the Museum of Contemporary Crafts, NYC, 1968.

The party was founded after the resignation of the evangelical singer and journalist Fabricio Alvarado Mu√±oz to the Christian party National Restoration for disagreements with the Executive Committee chaired by Deputy Carlos Avenda√±o. Alvarado was the latter's presidential candidate in the 2018 elections with major protagonism, since he was the most voted in the first round with 25% of the votes and jumping into the run-off but was defeated by the Citizen's Action Party nominee Carlos Alvarado Quesada. After a series of disputes arising from irregular contracts made by the campaign team without permission from the Executive Committee and the apparent payment of the surveys published by the firm OPol Consultores, there were mutual accusations between Alvarado and Avenda√±o that led to the exit of the former and the foundation of his own party together with the majority of deputies elected by PRN (8 of 14, however one of the defectors would later return to RN's caucus). The party finalized the recollection of signatures required by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal (at least 3000, although the group managed to collect 5000) and carried out the 82 cantonal assemblies that culminated in the founding National Assembly on January 30, 2019. Its first major nation-wide election was the 2020 Costa Rican municipal elections with disappointing results, as the party did not win any mayoralty and only managed to elect 29 aldermen.

The new terminal, sometimes referred to as the LIRR's East Side station, started construction in 2008 and is estimated to open in 2022. It is located beneath Grand Central Terminal, which serves the MTA's Metro-North Railroad. The Long Island Rail Road has terminated on the west side of Manhattan, at Penn Station and its predecessor, since 1910. The new terminal aims to ease congestion at Penn Station and decrease travel times for passengers going to and from the east side of Manhattan. The new terminal will connect to the Metro-North Railroad's Harlem, Hudson and New Haven Lines, as well as the New York City Subway at Grand Central‚Äì42nd Street station.  Services  The project will connect Grand Central Terminal to the railroad's Main Line, which connects to all of the LIRR's branches and almost all of its stations. However, due to clearance restrictions in the 63rd Street Tunnel, the C3 bilevel coaches used in diesel territory will not be able to use the terminal, thus not allowing for direct trips to and from non-electrified portions of the system (ie: to/from Oyster Bay or Port Jefferson), requiring passengers from diesel portions of the system to transfer.  History  LIRR concourse construction, 2019 45th Street escalator, 2019 The first proposals for Long Island Rail Road trains entering the east side of Manhattan date to 1963. In 1968, the 63rd Street Tunnel and a new \\"Metropolitan Transportation Center\\" at 48th Street and Third Avenue were proposed for the LIRR as part of the Program for Action. After people living near the proposed transportation center objected, the MTA's board of directors voted to use Grand Central as the terminal for the proposed LIRR route in 1977. However, due to the 1975 New York City fiscal crisis, the LIRR project was postponed indefinitely before the 63rd Street Tunnel could be completed. The East Side Access project was restarted after a study in the 1990s that showed that more than half of LIRR riders work closer to Grand Central than to the current terminus at Penn Station. Cost estimates jumped from $4.4 billion in 2004, to $6.4 billion in 2006, then to $11.1 billion. The new stations and tunnels are anticipated to begin service in December 2022. The MTA originally planned to build and open additional entrances at 44th, 45th, 47th, and 48th Streets. The station would connect to existing entrances at Grand Central North. The new LIRR station would also contain entrances at 335 Madison Avenue, near the southeast corner with 44th Street; at 270 Park Avenue and 280 Park Avenue near 47th and 48th‚Äì49th Streets, respectively; and at 347 Madison Avenue, on the east side of the avenue at 45th Street. An entrance on 46th Street between Lexington and Park Avenue was also built, connecting with Grand Central North. However, the MTA later announced its intent to defer construction of an entrance at 48th Street because the owner of 415 Madison Avenue wanted to undertake a major construction project on the site. The MTA would also connect the new station to the existing 47th Street cross-passage. The escalators would be up to long and descend more than . The escalators and elevators would be among the few privately operated escalators and elevators in the entire MTA system.  Station layout  The station will have , including for passengers and of retail space. Concourse The retail and dining concourse will be accessed from street-level or the Metro-North terminal via stairwells, 22 elevators, and 47 escalators. The number of elevators in this terminal would exceed the 19 escalators in the remainder of the LIRR system combined. Entrances to the LIRR terminal will exist from Grand Central Terminal's Dining Concourse and Biltmore Room. Additionally, the MTA plans to build and open new entrances to the LIRR station at 45th, 46th, and 48th streets. Platforms and tracks LIRR trains will arrive and depart from the twin station caverns and through a tunnel that will sit below Park Avenue and more than below the Metro-North tracks. The LIRR terminal will add four platforms and eight tracks (numbered 201‚Äì204 and 301‚Äì304) in two bi-level caverns. There will be four tracks and two platforms in each of the two caverns, and each cavern would contain two tracks and one platform on each level. A mezzanine will sit on a center level between the LIRR's two track levels. Reaching the street from the lowest new level, more than deep, will take about 10 minutes.

Ethiopian Airlines immediately grounded its remaining MAX fleet. On March 11, the Civil Aviation Administration of China ordered the first nationwide grounding, followed by most other aviation authorities in quick succession. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) publicly affirmed the airworthiness of the airplane on March 11, but grounded it on March 13 after receiving evidence of accident similarities. All 387 aircraft, which served 8,600 flights per week for 59 airlines, were barred from service by March 18, 2019. The groundings became the longest ever of a U.S. airliner. In November 2018, Boeing revealed the MAX had a new automated flight control, the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), that could repeatedly push the airplane nose down. Boeing had omitted any mention of the system in the aircraft manuals. A week after the first accident, Boeing and the FAA sent airlines urgent messages emphasizing a procedure to recover from a malfunction. In a presentation to the FAA, Boeing deflected blame and continued to assert that appropriate crew action would save the aircraft. Before the second accident, the FAA anticipated that Boeing would deliver a software update to MCAS by April 2019. During the groundings, the U.S. Congress, Transportation Department, FBI and ad hoc panels investigated the FAA certification of the MAX. The Indonesian NTSC accident report faulted aircraft certification, maintenance, and flight crew actions. The Ethiopian ECAA determined that the flight crew had attempted the recovery procedure. The U.S. NTSB said Boeing failed to assess the consequences of MCAS failure and made incorrect assumptions about flight crew response. The U.S. Inspector General said Boeing deliberately misrepresented MCAS to avoid scrutiny. The FAA revoked Boeing's authority to issue airworthiness certificates for individual MAX airplanes and imposed a fine on Boeing for exerting \\"undue pressure\\" on its designated aircraft inspectors. The House of Representatives faulted engineering flaws, mismanagement, cover- up, and oversight lapses rooting from the FAA's delegation of authority to Boeing. In January 2020, with 400 aircraft awaiting certification and delivery, Boeing suspended production of the MAX until May 2020. By March 2020, the grounding had cost Boeing $18.6 billion in compensation to airlines and victims' families, lost business, and legal fees. Airlines and leasing companies that once struggled without the MAX had cancelled nearly 800 orders of the MAX by September 2020, months into the COVID-19 pandemic. On July 1, Boeing completed several days of certification flights. In August, the FAA published details of changes related to aircraft defects and pilot training that will be mandated before the MAX returns to service, expected no earlier than mid-October 2020.  Timeline  2018 * October 29, a 737 MAX 8 operating Lion Air Flight 610 crashed after take-off from Jakarta, killing all 189 on- board. * November 6, Boeing issued a service bulletin warning that with \\"erroneous data, the pitch trim system can trim the stabilizer nose down in increments lasting up to 10 seconds\\" which \\"can be stopped and reversed with the use of the electric stabilizer trim switches but may restart 5 seconds after\\" and instructed pilots to counteract it by running the Runaway stabilizer and manual trim procedure. * November 7, the FAA issued an Emergency airworthiness directive requiring revising \\"the to provide the flight crew with runaway horizontal stabilizer trim procedures\\" when \\"repeated nose-down trim commands\\" are caused by \\"an erroneously high single AoA sensor\\". * November 10, Boeing referred to MCAS in multi-operator messages. The automated flight control could cause unintended nosedives, but was omitted from crew manuals and training. * November 27, the Allied Pilots Association of American Airlines had a meeting with Boeing to express concerns with the MCAS effectiveness, and was unnerved by the airframer's responses. * December 3, the FAA conducted an unpublished \\"Transport Aircraft Risk Assessment Methodology‚Äù (TARAM) analysis that concluded, \\"if left uncorrected, the MCAS design flaw in the 737 MAX could result in as many as 15 future fatal crashes over the life of the fleet‚Äù; it was exposed by the United States House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on . 2019 * March 10, another 737 MAX 8 operating Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashed shortly after take- off from Addis Ababa airport, killing all 157 on-board, due to a similar faulty MCAS, initiating a worldwide flight ban for the aircraft, starting with China. * March 13, the U.S. FAA was among the last to order the grounding of the 737 MAX, after claiming there was no reason: China had the most aircraft in service, 96, followed by the U.S. with 72, Canada with 39 and India with 21. * March 27, Boeing unveiled a software update to avoid MCAS errors, already developed and tested it in-flight, to be certified. * April 5, Boeing announced it was cutting 737 production by almost a fifth, to 42 aircraft monthly, anticipating a prolonged grounding, and had formed an internal design review committee. * May 13, Republican Congressman Sam Graves at the House Aviation subcommittee hearing, blamed the 737 MAX crashes on poor training of the Indonesian and Ethiopian pilots; he stated that \\"pilots trained in the U.S. would have been successful\\" in handling the emergencies on both jets. * June 18, IAG signed a letter of intent for 200 737 MAXs at the Paris air show, followed by Turkish SunExpress and Air Astana later in the year. * June 26, flight tests for the FAA uncovered a data processing issue affecting the pilots' ability to perform the \\"runaway stabiliser\\" procedure to respond to MCAS errors. * October 30, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg testified before U.S. Congress committees, defending Boeing's safety culture and denying knowledge of internal messages in which Boeing's former chief technical pilot said he had unknowingly lied to regulators, and voiced its concerns on MCAS. * November 22, Boeing unveiled the first 737 MAX 10 flight-test aircraft. * November 26, the FAA revoked Boeing's Organization Designation Authorization to issue airworthiness certificates for individual MAX airplanes. * December 17, Boeing confirmed the suspension of 737 MAX production from January 2020. * December 23, Dennis Muilenburg resigned, to be replaced by board chairman David Calhoun. 2020 * January 7, Boeing recommended \\"simulator training in addition to computer based training\\". * January 9, Boeing released previous messages in which it claimed no flight simulator time was needed for pilots, and distanced itself from emails mocking airlines and the FAA, and criticising the 737 MAX design. * January 13, David Calhoun became CEO, pledging to improve Boeing‚Äôs commitment to safety and transparency, and estimating the return to service in mid-2020. * January 21, Boeing estimated the ungrounding could begin in mid-2020. * May 27, Boeing resumed production of the MAX at a \\"very gradual pace\\". * June 28 to July 1, the FAA conducted flight tests with a view to recertification of the 737 MAX. * September 16, the U.S. House of Representatives releases its concluding report, blaming Boeing and the FAA for lapses in the design, construction and certification. * September 30, a Boeing 737 MAX test aircraft was flown by FAA administrator Stephen Dickson.  Groundings   Accident investigations   Lion Air Flight 610  Flight 610 Preliminary investigations revealed serious flight control problems that traumatized passengers and crew on the aircraft's previous flight, as well as signs of angle-of-attack (AoA) sensor and other instrument failures on that and previous flights, tied to a design flaw involving the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) of the 737 MAX series. The aircraft maintenance records indicated that the AoA Sensor was just replaced before the accident flight. The report tentatively attributed the accident to the erroneous angle-of-attack (AoA) data and automatic nose-down trim commanded by MCAS. The NTSC final report, published on October 23, 2019 was prepared with assistance from the U.S. NTSB. NTSC's investigator Nurcahyo Utomo identified nine factors to the accident, saying: > \\"The nine factors are the root problem; they cannot be separated. Not one is > contributing more than the other. Unlike NTSB reports that identify the > primary cause of accidents and then list contributing issues determined to > be less significant, Indonesia is following a convention used by many > foreign regulators of listing causal factors without ranking them\\". The final report has been shared with families of Lion Air Flight 610, then published on October 25, 2019.  Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302  ET-AVJ, the Ethiopian Airlines aircraft that crashed as Flight 302 The initial reports for Flight 302 found that the pilots struggled to control the airplane in a manner similar to the Lion Air flight 610 crash. On March 13, 2019, the FAA announced that evidence from the crash site and satellite data on Flight 302 suggested that it might have suffered from the same problem as Lion Air Flight 610 in that the jackscrew controlling the pitch of the horizontal stabilizer of the crashed Flight 302, was found to be set in the full \\"nose down\\" position, similar to Lion Air Flight 610. This further implicated MCAS as contributory to the crash. Ethiopian Airlines spokesman Biniyam Demssie said that the procedures for disabling MCAS had just been incorporated into pilot training. \\"All the pilots flying the MAX received the training after the Indonesia crash,\\" he said. \\"There was a directive by Boeing, so they took that training.\\" Despite following the procedure, the pilots could not recover. The Ethiopian Civil Aviation Authority (ECAA) is leading investigations for Flight 302. The United States Federal Aviation Administration will also assist in the investigation. Both the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder were recovered from the crash site on March 11, 2019. The French aviation accident investigation agency BEA announced that it would analyze the flight recorders from the flight. BEA received the flight recorders on March 14, 2019. On March 17, 2019, the Ethiopia's transport minister Dagmawit Moges announced that the black box had been found and downloaded, and that the preliminary data retrieved from the flight data recorder show a \\"clear similarity\\" with those of Lion Air Flight 610 which crashed off Indonesia. Due to this finding, some experts in Indonesia suggested that the NTSC should cooperate with Flight 302's investigation team. Later on the evening, the NTSC offered assistance to Flight 302's investigation team, stating that the committee and the Indonesian Transportation Ministry would send investigators and representatives from the government to assist with the investigation of the crash. The Ethiopian Civil Aviation Authority published an interim report on March 9, 2020, one day before the March 10 anniversary of the crash. Investigators have tentatively concluded that the crash was caused by the aircraft's design.  United States  The vertical airspeeds of the Boeing 737 MAX 8s involved in the JT 610 and ET 302 crashes On November 6, 2018, four days before it identified MCAS by name, Boeing published a supplementary service bulletin prompted by the first crash. The bulletin describes warnings triggered by erroneous AoA data, and referred pilots to a \\"non-normal runaway trim\\" procedure as resolution, specifying a narrow window of a few seconds before the system would reactivate and pitch the nose down again. The FAA issued an emergency airworthiness directive, 2018-23-51, on November 7, 2018 requiring the bulletin's inclusion in the flight manuals, and that pilots immediately review the new information provided.. On March 11, FAA defended the aircraft against groundings citing these emergency procedures (Continued Airworthiness Notification to the International Community) for operators. In December 2018, a month after the Lion Air accident, the FAA had conducted an internal safety risk analysis predicted fifteen more crashes with no repairs to MCAS, but that report was not revealed until the U.S. House hearing in December 2019. FAA's administrator, Stephen Dickson, who assumed the position during the accident investigations, said in retrospect that the accident risk was unsatisfactory. On September 26, 2019, the NTSB released the results of its review of potential lapses in the design and approval of the 737 MAX. The NTSB report concludes that assumptions \\"that Boeing used in its functional hazard assessment of uncommanded MCAS function for the 737 MAX did not adequately consider and account for the impact that multiple flight deck alerts and indications could have on pilots' responses to the hazard\\". When Boeing induced a stabilizer trim input that simulated the stabilizer moving consistent with the MCAS function, \\"... the specific failure modes that could lead to unintended MCAS activation (such as an erroneous high AOA input to the MCAS) were not simulated as part of these functional hazard assessment validation tests. As a result, additional flight deck effects (such as IAS DISAGREE and ALT DISAGREE alerts and stick shaker activation) resulting from the same underlying failure (for example, erroneous AOA) were not simulated and were not in the stabilizer trim safety assessment report reviewed by the NTSB.\\" The NTSB questioned the long-held industry and FAA practice of assuming the nearly instantaneous responses of highly trained test pilots as opposed to pilots of all levels of experience to verify human factors in aircraft safety. The NTSB expressed concerns that the process used to evaluate the original design needs improvement because that process is still in use to certify current and future aircraft and system designs. The FAA could for example randomly sample pools from the worldwide pilot community to get a more representative assessment of cockpit situations.  Responsible states  ICAO regulations Annex 13, ‚ÄúAircraft Accident and Incident Investigation‚Äù, defines which states may participate in investigations. For the two MAX accidents these are: # Indonesia, for Lion Air Flight 610 as state of registration, state of occurrence and state of operator. # Ethiopia, for Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, as state of registration, state of occurrence and state of operator. # The United States, as state of manufacturer and issuer of the type certificate. The participating state or national transportation safety bureaus are the NTSB for the US and the NTSC for Indonesia. Australia and Singapore also offered technical assistance, shortly after the Lion Air accident, regarding data recovery from the new generation flight recorders (FDR). With the exception of Ethiopia, the officially recognised countries are members of the Joint Authorities Technical Review (JATR).  Type certification and return to service   Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System  The MAX uses an adjustable stabilizer, moved by a jackscrew, to provide the required pitch trim forces.

The headline contrasted Masango as \\"the dropout\\" and the other wife as \\"the graduate.\\" After refusing to issue an apology, Makhubu was fired from the Times. Another press scandal occurred after Masango's death. Photographs of her vigil and funeral at the royal palace were leaked to the press by members of the king's royal guards. The guards were fined for the incident.

History  The 3rd Brigade was originally formed in August 1914, just after the outbreak of World War I. It was created in Jullundur, India from the merger of 18 Battery, 62 Battery, and 75 Battery. The individual batteries were, before the war, a part of the 3rd (Lahore) Division. Shortly after its formation, the regiment moved to Peshawar, from where it was ordered to England. Upon arrival in England in November 1914. The brigade was restructured at Winchester, where for a short time it was called CXLVI Brigade. By the end of the restructuring, 75 Battery had left the brigade and 365 Battery had taken its place. The regiment then joined the 28th Infantry Division and was first deployed to France for the remainder of the year, before being moved to Thessaloniki, Greece, in 1915. In February, 22 Battery of XXXIV Brigade joined the brigade for a short period of time before being removed. After a duration of minimal action for the brigade, D Battery of CXLVI Brigade joined the unit and became D (Howitzer) Battery. In August, 365 Battery was broken up and parts of the battery joined 18 and 64 Batteries. At the end of the war the brigade consisted of 18, 62, and D (Howitzer) Batteries. Organization At the time of World War I, Royal Field Artillery regiments were designated as brigades, which consisted of three artillery batteries merged together. Each brigade would use only one type of artillery gun. In addition to the three batteries, each brigade also contained an ammunition column and base depot. The column consisted of 158 officers and men and controlled the movement of all artillery, supplies, and security groups. The depot consisted of a junior officer, two sergeants, and 40 enlisted men held in reserve as casualty replacements or storemen.

Originally written in Latin, the title translates as The Secrets of Women or Of the Secrets of Women. Drawing on Hippocratic, Galenic, and Aristotelian theories, this text discusses sexuality and reproduction from both a medical and philosophical perspective. Over eighty manuscript copies of the treatise have been identified, and it has been translated into multiple different languages over several centuries. This suggests that the ideas expressed in this work were hugely popular and influential.  Contents  Owing to both the medical and philosophical nature of the text, a variety of topics are discussed by pseudo-Albert. While some of the thirteen chapters are strictly medical, such as those on the signs of conception, the period of gestation, and the nature of the menses, others are largely theoretical. For example, the author discusses at length how the planets and constellations can affect a developing fetus. It can come as no surprise that the author's philosophical discussions are more in-depth and developed considering natural philosophy was more significant than medicine in the sources, such as Aristotle, from which the author drew his information. Therefore, the nature of Secreta Mulierum is more accurately categorized as cosmological or philosophical in focus and not medical. In fact, the author demonstrates a lack of basic medical knowledge, even for the time period. For example, the author states in his discussion of menses that urine and menstrual blood are expelled from the body through the same opening. Scholars have concluded the writing may have been designed to be used as an instructional text on human reproduction for the religious community due to its nature, rather than for medical training.  Chapters  # On the Generation of the Embryo # On the Formation of the Fetus # Concerning the Influence of the Planets # On the Generation of Imperfect Animals # On the Exit of the Fetus From the Uterus # Concerning Monsters in Nature # On the Signs of Conception # On the Signs of Whether a Male or Female Is In the Uterus # On the Signs of Corruption of Virginity # On the Signs of Chastity # Concerning a Defect of the Womb # Concerning Impediments to Conception # On the Generation of the Sperm  Views of menstruation Like many philosophers of this time, the author reasons that human embryos are made from the seed of the father and the menses of the mother. It was believed that menstrual blood was surplus food that had not been used by the woman's body. The author states that the menses comes once a month due to the cold and humid nature of women and is the color of blood except in corrupt women. It was thought that women who had been corrupted by bad or viscous humors would have menses the color of lead. When conception occurs, the womb \\"closes up like a purse on all sides\\" and therefore menstruation stops. However, the author suggests that the woman is still taking in excess food during her pregnancy that is not being purged and therefore claims pregnant women have a greater desire for sexual intercourse. The author suggests that women keep themselves away from men during their monthly flow. The author believes that menstrual flow is poisonous and can even harm the eyes of children if they are looked upon by the woman. When menstruation stops at menopause, the retention of menses builds up and results in an excess of evil humors, which can escape through the eyes and infect the air, polluting the world.  Astrology  The formation of the fetus is a key topic in the text, and the influence of celestial bodies on the fetus is important to the author, as they endow the fetus with certain abilities. Saturn: gives the fetus the ability to reason and discern, as well as consolidates the seed that makes the child, giving it the power of growth and motion in the first month. Jove (Jupiter): grants generosity and passion in the second month Mars: brings animosity, anger, and desire to the fetus; forms the head of the fetus and divides the arms from the torso during the third month Sun: bestows the power of knowing and remembering, as well as creates the heart Venus: causes separation of hands and feet, and it creates exterior features, such as the mouth, nose, and outer sexual organs Mercury: the sixth month is characterized by development of the voice, eyes, and hair; Joy is also created by Mercury Moon: brings formation of the fetus to an end by completing the skin The author also attributes certain body parts to the twelve signs of the Zodiac. For example, the formation of the feet and sole is attributed to Pisces. Thus, it can be seen that astrological influence on reproduction was a popular idea to this author and others in this time.

Biography  Women of the Mexican Revolution (\\"adelitas\\" or \\"soldaderas\\") with crossed bandoliers. Petra Herrera, dressed as a man and with the pseudonym Pedro Herrera, actively participated in many battles of the Mexican Revolution in order to join the league commanded by General Francisco (Pancho) Villa. She joined the military during her mid- twenties. She had an excellent reputation and demonstrated exemplary leadership. She was able, after a time, to reveal that she was a woman, but she was refused military rank and was removed from the army. Female participation in the Revolution was common, but in activities such as food and accompaniment. Herrera's involvement was exemplary.She was able to keep her identity as a woman a secret due to ingenious strategies, such as pretending to shave her beard every morning, thereby avoiding questions about facial hair. She eventually reached the rank of captain and led a brigade of 200 men. Although she had some victories, Pancho Villa refused to give military credit to a woman and would not permit Petra Herrea to serve as a General. As a result of being removed from Villa's forces, Herrera formed her own brigade, exclusively for women. She fought in the second battle of Torre√≥n on May 30, 1914 with 400 other women. Her strategy of attack included exploding bridges. She had a great capacity for leadership. This manifested once her feminine identity was revealed and she formed a group of soldaderas which fought some battles next to the troops of General Villa. One of her most important triumphs was the previously-mentioned second battle of Torre√≥n, Coahuila, on May 30, 1914.Poniatowska, Elena. (1999) Las soldaderas.

She was born on August 12, 1930, in The Key First Nation, Saskatchewan, and died on August 10, 2005, in Regina, Saskatchewan.  Indigenous Peoples History  The Truth and Reconciliation Commission 94 Calls to Action are dependent on identifying and making publicly available the history and legacy of residential schools and the history of Indigenous Peoples in Canada. There is a lack of documentation for their history as it was one of forced assimilation by a dominant culture looking to erase those cultures, which means little may be available. Plus digitization efforts to date have not prioritized items under copyright nor non-mainstream cultures and languages, resulting in claims of digital or electronic colonialism. Thus the paucity of information and references for this notable Indigenous person who was publicly honoured by an Indigenous organization (FSIN) for her lifetime achievements. Early years She was born Gwendolyn Lucy O'Soup in 1930. Her brothers and sisters include Raymond Brass, Frances Crowfoot, and Geraldine Wardman. Personal life She married Clifford Crane of the Key First Nation after his service in World War II and raised nine children, Terry, Dennis (residential school specialist and later, Chief), Garda, Gilda, Trent, Brenda, Joy, Karen, and Cliff. Norman predeceased his parents in 1956 at just over 2 years of age. She lived in Moose Jaw (1961-67) and Edmonton (1967-84) with most of her children before returning to the reserve to retire. Gwen Crane was a lifetime member of the Anglican Church and sat on the national Anglican Council for Indigenous People (ACIP). \\"She spent the last few years trying to convince the province and the federal government to recognize the old St. Andrew's Anglican Church, which was built by members on the reserve in 1885, as a historical monument.\\" Kookum [\\"grandmother\\"] to Corey O'Soup, the first Advocate for Children and Youth for the province of Saskatchewan with Indigenous heritage. Career At the age of 24 she was nominated for the position of Chief and won by three votes in December 1954, becoming Canada's first female, First Nations Chief and first elected under the current electoral system. There are reputed to be other female Chiefs pre- contact but the colonial, male dominated culture refused to deal with women, and thus the decline in balanced leadership until her win. Political service was limited to a two-year term at the time, which she fulfilled (1954‚Äì56). Her mandate was Indigenous education and revitalizing a health care centre (Union Hospital) in Norquay, and that \\"our main thrust is to get the Indians working together in harmony.\\" She was a seamstress in a clothing factory in Moose Jaw. She was also the first woman porter at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Edmonton. She is reported to have also cleaned buses and did housecleaning while living in Edmonton.

Others Dos cajoncitos de dos en dos, alzan la pata y dicen adios (Two Little Boxes Two By Two, Lift Their Leg and Say Adieu) (1967)  Career and exhibitions  Guti√©rrez held her first group exhibition in 1962, before going to study in France. In the following years, she had solo exhibitions in multiple locations including, Bogot√°, Cucuta, Medellin, Bucaramanga, where she displayed several works such as, Los que son (1968). Guti√©rrez's work was influenced by Pop Art and focuses on the political struggles of Colombia, as seen in her 1972 painting Seguiremos diciendo patria', which portrays a man and a woman being hung upside down by their ankles, with their backs turned to the viewer. In addition, her paintings were a representation of the violence during the time between the people and the dictatorship. In 1977, she created the painting Y con unos lazos me izaron (And they lifted me up with rope), which she based on the case of Dr. Olga L√≥pez who, along with her five-year-old daughter, was arrested unjustly and tortured by Columbian police officers for two years. The name comes from L√≥pez's testimony, where she stated that she was tied up with rope and lifted, and per Politika's Silvia Arana, is meant to represent men and women who were victimized or murdered by the State of Colombia. Guti√©rrez does not show the faces of the people she paints but instead discloses their name and situation. In 2017, Guti√©rrez displayed Y con unos lazos me izaron in the exhibition \\"Radical Women: Latin American Art, 1960‚Äì1985\\" at the Hammer Museum, where the themes were resistance and fear. Sara Solaimani wrote a review on the art exhibitions in the Hammer Museum and described how the different creations of arts, photography, moving elements, drawings, sculptures, etc. Guti√©rrez art work was displayed. Solaimani writes, the concept of \\"Radical Women is a dynamic experience that draws the viewer into their bodies, movements, feelings, and thoughts\\" . In addition to the different art exhibitions displayed, the overall take of Radical Women: Latin American Art, 1960‚Äì1985 brought up the topic of intersectionality, history, and women's rights. The theme of the art exhibition at the Hammer Museum was resistance and fear and the artwork of Guti√©rrez that was used was that of a faceless women hung upside down, \\"Y con unos lazos me izaron\\". Finalizando los a√±os sesenta, Sonia Guti√©rrez se dio a conocer como artista con su primera exposici√≥n individual en 1967 en la Biblioteca Nacional. In Latin American, the selected exhibitions that Guti√©rrez was part of were: 1967 19th Sala Gregorio V√°squez, Biblioteca Nacional, Bogot√°, 1967 Sal√≥n de Artistas Nacionales, Biblioteca Luis √Ångel Arango, Bogot√°, 1968 Bienal Iberoamericana de Pintura Coltejer, Medell√≠n, Colombia, 1968 1st Bienal de Artes Pl√°sticas, Lima, and 1991 Astistas santandereanos en la d√©cada del 1960 Museo de Arte Moderno de Bucaramanga, Colombia.Fajardo-Hill, C., & Giunta, A.

Style and artworks  Guti√©rrez used patterns, textures, and vivid colors to give a sense of pop aesthetic. She, unlike many other artist, transitioned from 'abstraction' and in the 1960s she created new work around the \\"go-go\\" period, yet during the 1970s she started creating art around Colombian politics. Following, the \\"go- go\\" period disappeared and is not very well known outside of Latin America. In the political scene, some of her famous images explore the political violence in Colombia that influenced Guti√©rrez to explore the violence that was occurring. She paints ropes and fabric on individuals to the violence that many had to endure during that time. Sonia Gutierrez artwork is the \\"Y con unos Lazos me izaron (And they lifted me up with a rope) it was created in 1977 with the medium being acrylic on canvas.

Pop art is an art movement that emerged in the United Kingdom and the United States during the mid-to-late 1950s. The movement presented a challenge to traditions of fine art by including imagery from popular and mass culture, such as advertising, comic books and mundane cultural objects. Artists that were known for creating Pop Art include, American artist Andy Warhol with one of his known paintings being the Campbell's Soup Cans in 1962 and Shot Marilyns 1964.Schroeder, Jonathan E. ‚ÄúAndy Warhol: Consumer Researcher.‚Äù ACR Special Volumes, 1 Jan. 1997, acrwebsite.org/volumes/8089/volumes/v24/NA-24.

Guti√©rrez, while continuing to retain her pop art aesthetic, began to create art that was more political and that in a sense would open communication about the violence that was happening in Colombia. She shifted her artistic pop art career to a more political one in the 1970s, two of her political art pieces, that are popular are titled, \\"Y siguiremos diciendo patria\\" (And we'll continue to say\\") and \\"Y con unos lazos me izaron\\". In these pieces, she painted the violence that was occurring, with men and women tied up in ropes, hung upside down. Distinctions and honors Guti√©rrez received several distinctions and honors during the 1960s: Premio Pintura at the 3rd Sal√≥n 10 de mayo (1965), Primer Premio Dibujo at the 10th Sal√≥n Cano (1966), honors at the 1st Bienal Iberoamericana de Pintura Coltejer in Medellin (1968) with her painting Pintura Pop (1968, Fourth Prize that Guti√©rrez won at the III Sal√≥n Nacional de Pintura [Third National Painting Salon] that was organized by Croydon, a private company, in 1967.

C. Gill (1879 ‚Äì 1923), often known as Ted Gill was a British socialist activist. Born in Leominster in Herefordshire, Gill's family moved to Abertillery in Wales when he was ten years old. He left school and began working, becoming a coal miner five years later. Despite his shyness, he came to prominence in the South Wales Miners' Federation, which sponsored him to study at Ruskin College from 1907 to 1909. While there, he was a founder member of the Plebs' League, and thereafter frequently spoke in favour of workers' education. He also joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP) and devoted much time to the party, arguing in favour of the nationalisation of the mines. Like the majority of the ILP, Gill initially opposed World War I, stating that \\"unless strenuous efforts are made to organise anti-war feeling, we are on the eve of a holocaust too terrible for contemplation\\". However, within days he changed his mind, joining the 10th South Wales Borderers. Unexpectedly, he received a commission as a second lieutenant, and also qualified as a machine gun instructor before sailing to France at the end of 1915. While in the trenches at Festubert, he crawled into no man's land three times, to organise a retreat of troops at the advanced posts, and then to rescue an injured soldier, for which action he was awarded the Military Cross. He was badly wounded at Mametz Wood, but was said to have leapt from a stretcher to rally the troops he was leading. As a result of his injuries, he was invalided out, with the rank of captain. After the war, Gill suffered ongoing poor health. He devoted his time to the Labour Party, standing in Frome at the 1918 United Kingdom general election. Although he did not win the seat, the party saw his potential as a propagandist, specifically to counter the charge that the party was unpatriotic. For the 1922 United Kingdom general election, he worked with J. W. Kneeshaw and W. F. Toynbee, speaking across the country, with his focus being the south west of England. He also stood again in Frome, this time taking 48.8% of the vote and a very close second place. Gill travelled to campaign for the Labour Party in the 1923 Morpeth by- election, but the strain on his health led to his death.

The locomotive, painted at the Horicon, Wisconsin, shops of Wisconsin and Southern Railroad, was unveiled at a private ceremony for UP's ex-CNW employees at Proviso Rail Yard in suburban Chicago on July 15, 2006, before being publicly displayed at North Western Station (C&NW;'s former station) in Chicago. After its unveiling, the locomotive pulled freight train MPRCB from Proviso to Council Bluffs, Iowa, in conjunction with CNW 8646 and 8701 (a set of GE Dash 9-44CW locomotives at the time still in CNW paint). The 1995 then entered regular revenue service, eventually operating through Iowa, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. In 2020, the locomotive suffered some electronic issues and was put out of service. Union Pacific does not know if they will put it back to service or not at this period in time. * Union Pacific 1996: Its paint scheme is based on both the Daylight and \\"Black Widow\\" paint schemes of the Southern Pacific Railroad. It was unveiled on August 19, 2006, and is currently operating in regular revenue service. Southern Pacific 6051, a Daylight-painted EMD E9 locomotive that is preserved at the California State Railroad Museum was in attendance at UP 1996's unveiling.

UP 949, 951 and 963B are a trio of streamlined General Motors Electro-Motive Division E9 passenger locomotives built in 1955. They are used to haul the UP business cars during excursions and charter specials. While externally they are 1955 vintage locomotives, the original twin 1,200-hp 12-cylinder 567 series engines have been replaced with single EMD 16-645E 2000 hp (1.5 MW) engines (which were salvaged from wrecked GP38-2 locomotives) and the electrical and control equipment similarly upgraded, making them more modern locomotives under the skin. The set is made of two A units and one B unit, the latter which contains an HEP engine-generator set for powering passenger cars. The two A units have been modified to eliminate the nose doors to increase safety in a collision. UP 951 has carried its original number since its entry into service. UP 949 was built with its current number, but later was sent to the Chicago and North Western Railway and Regional Transportation Authority as CNW/RTA #511 before being reacquired by the UP. UP 963B was built as UP E9B 970B and served as a heater car on Amtrak upon its formation before being reacquired by the UP. The heater car number was AMTK 669/1919. EMD DDA40X Centennial diesel- electric locomotive in the world, as seen near Watseka, Illinois in February 2008. UP 6936 is an EMD DDA40X \\"Centennial\\" diesel-electric locomotive, the last of its class in service. These were the largest diesel locomotives ever built and were manufactured specifically for UP. In November 2000, UP 6936 collided with a dump truck at a grade crossing in Livonia, Louisiana, damaging its front end. The unit was stored in North Little Rock, Arkansas, until the damage could be repaired. Another collision took place in 2007, though there were no injuries. Steam locomotives Since 1960, the Union Pacific has operated steam locomotives on a variety of excursions. These include: * UP 844: a 4-8-4 Northern type express passenger steam locomotive (class FEF-3), operated in excursion service since 1960. It was the last steam locomotive built for UP and has been in continuous service since its 1944 delivery. Many people know the engine as the No. 8444, since an extra '4' was added to its number in 1962 to distinguish it from a diesel numbered in the 800 series. It regained its rightful number in June 1989, after the diesel was retired and donated to the Nevada Southern Railroad Museum in Boulder City, Nevada. A mechanical failure occurred on June 24, 1999, in which the boiler tubes from the 1996 overhaul, being made of the wrong material, collapsed inside the boiler and put the steam locomotive out of commission. The UP steam crew repaired it and returned it to service on November 10, 2004. It was rebuilt again in 2015 and returned to service in 2016. In addition to being one of UP's oldest locomotives, it is the only steam locomotive to never be officially retired from a North American Class I railroad. * UP 4014: a 4-8-8-4 Big Boy class freight steam locomotive, began operating in excursion service in 2019. It is largest operational steam locomotive in the world. Delivered in 1941, the locomotive operated in revenue service until it made its last run on July 21, 1959, and was placed in storage until it was officially retired in 1961. Following retirement, it was donated in late 1961 to the RailGiants Train Museum in Pomona, California, where it became one of the eight Big Boys preserved around the United States. On July 23, 2013, it was announced that the UP was acquiring UP 4014 from The Southern California Chapter of The Railway and Locomotive Historical Society in Pomona, with the goal of restoring it to service. No. 4014 was moved from Pomona to the Union Pacific West Colton yard on January 26, 2014, and then to Cheyenne, Wyoming from April 28, 2014 to May 8, 2014. Restoration to full operating condition was completed in May 2019, with its first excursion called \\"The Great Race to Ogden\\" taking place during the same month. One steam locomotive, which previously operated in excursion service, has since been retired: * UP 3985: a 4-6-6-4 Challenger class dual-service steam locomotive, operated in excursion service from 1981 to 2010 and currently retired as of January 2020. Delivered in 1943, it operated in revenue service until it was withdrawn from service in 1962. Following retirement, it was stored in the UP roundhouse until 1975, when it was moved to the employees' parking lot outside the depot in Cheyenne, Wyoming. It sat on display until 1979, when a team of employee volunteers restored it to service in 1981. Following the restoration, it was the largest operating steam locomotive in the world until it lost the title to UP 4014. In 2007, it underwent repairs for service, and was back up and running in 2008 to continue its run, but further mechanical problems caused it to be placed back into storage in October 2010. It was subsequently retired in January 2020 following 4014's restoration and is now stored at the roundhouse in Cheyenne.

Passenger cars The Union Pacific operates a fleet of passenger cars that are often used for excursions and office car specials. Originally ordered by a variety of railroads, the oldest dates to 1912, but most were built in the mid-20th century, at the height of passenger train service. The fleet also carries a variety of important people, such as presidents, senators, generals, soldiers, artists, architects, singers and actors.

Navarro was born on March 23, 1955, in Barranquilla, Colombia. She was born in Hospital de Barranquilla. She is the daughter of Carlos Navarro Orozco and Rosa Mar√≠a Barandica. Navarro was exposed to the arts since her birth because her mother was an artist who worked with several mediums. At an early age, Navarro began to learn and draw the human body on the wet sand which was in her home's patio. She also utilized wood, box cartons and clay, where she would get it from her father's ladrilleria (brick gallery). She was an active artist in the early 1980s. Her first artwork consisted of conceptual art and explored the semiotic meanings and possibilities of her name. Her name \\"Rosa\\" means both \\"rose\\" and \\"pink\\" in Spanish. There are other photographs where she utilizes her body as a vehicle to represent herself. Her artwork can be classified as self-portraits. Navarro has exhibited in group and solo exhibitions in Colombia. She has received awards and won second place at the First Salon Colombo-americano in 1982. Navarro currently lives and has her gallery in Santo Tomas, Atlantico Colombia. She is also currently working on an artwork titled Rosalogico which depicts the human existence as a unique phenomenon inside the beauty that art can only create.  Education  Rosa Navarro studied at La Normal de F√°tima and went on to study at El Instituto Ariano in Barranquilla where she developed her artist portfolio. In 1977 she joined the faculty of the Architecture department and in 1978 she went on to study plastic arts at La Facultad de Bellas Artes, Universidad del Atl√°ntico, Barranquilla.  Artwork   R-O-S-A Lenguaje de los Sordomudos, 1981  In 1981 a few professors like Antonio Iginio Caro, Alvaro Herazo and Ida Esbra incentivized Rosa to create her first photography artwork titled R-O-S-A, inspired by body parts as language and the color pink. Letras \\"R\\", \\"O\\", \\"S\\", A\\", is a reference to her name is sign language. Navarro spells ROSA in sign language with each of the photograph as one letter and colored in pink. This piece inspired her to create other ones like ‚ÄúHuellas en Rosa‚Äù and ‚ÄúUna Rosa es una Rosa‚Äù. In addition, she created a piece titled, \\"La Amorosa\\", \\"La Furiosa\\", \\"La Misteriosa. All of these photos there are natural thorns and then appear throughout her face. They allowed her to be part of a museum exhibition at the Arte Moderno de Medell√≠n museum, ‚ÄúII Sal√≥n Arturo y Rebeca Rabinovich‚Äù in 1982. She became interested in the nature of flowers in the work of Paul Gauguin and began to work with her name Rosa, which is also a flower. In her photography she includes herself not because of her name but because of her identity and as a symbol. In certain occasions she also uses the word Rosa and in some she uses the themes and classic metaphors. For example, she used the classic theme of Dafne, who converts into the Laurel tree after Apollo chases her. She uses that theme but also converts herself throughout her art. She converts into a rose from a rose bush.  Juego de Palabras Amorosa, Misteriosa, Furiosa, Dolorosa 1984  In 1984 she is invited to showcase her work at the ‚ÄúIX Sal√≥n Atenas‚Äù del Museo de Arte Moderno en Bogot√°. Afterwards to showcase at the sal√≥n ‚ÄúNominados‚Äù de la fundaci√≥n Gilberto Alzate Avenda√±o. In 1986 has her first invitation to participate in the XXX Sal√≥n Nacional de artistas en Bogot√°. Later she participates at the ediciones XXXII, XXXIV, XXXV. Since that period she has been part of several exhibitions where she showcases her work: ‚ÄúRosa de los Vientos‚Äù, ‚ÄúJuego de Palabras‚Äù, ‚ÄúRomana‚Äù, ‚ÄúRosa Patri√≥tica-Rosa Ecol√≥gica‚Äù, ‚ÄúRecogiendo Espacio‚Äù and ‚ÄúRosa Rosae‚Äù. She has gained excellent publicity and art criticisms which have exposed her internationally. Some of her artwork has been exhibited in France several occasions, they include: ‚ÄúUn Rev√© Rose pour une Rose‚Äù en el CDI santa Melanine Chantepie 2001, ‚ÄúMire salle des Fertes de la Chatoais a Vern‚Äù 2002, ‚ÄúFantas√≠a de una Rosa Caribe‚Äù LA MIR La Maison Internacionale de Rennes, 2007.  Nacer y Morir de una Rosa, 1982  Nacer y Morir de una Rosa (Birth and Death of a Rose) is a black and white series of seven photographs.

He is an inaugural Playwright Fellow at Denver Center for the Performing Arts as well as a lead organizer for TEDxBoulder‚Äîone of the largest TEDx events in the world. He is known for working with cities to use writing to highlight communities as well as for his upcoming musical, My Country, My Country He served as the campaign architect for his father, Emmanuel Weyi, during his presidential run in the Democratic Republic of Congo.  Education  Weyi was born in Dallas, Texas, and grew up in Denver, Colorado; he is the son of Congolese immigrants and has two brothers. He grew up speaking French and Lingala, and later learned Japanese and Portuguese. He attended George Washington High School, where he helped captain the inaugural mock trial team to become the first team in Denver Public Schools history to win a State Championship and earn a top-5 national title. Weyi then attended Whitman College, where he earned degrees in both philosophy and history. While at Whitman, he was a practiced performer who appeared in many staged theatre works, founded a hip-hop crew and co-founded an award-winning poetry team; he also engaged in a passion for improvisation, DJing, and music. He eventually went on to dance professionally for a period.  Career   Multi- disciplinary work  Weyi has created a reputation for his multi-disciplinary storytelling and creative work, which aims to pull in different mediums to immerse audiences in deep topics. In 2019, he partnered with the Denver Museum of Nature and Science and Groupmuse to produce an event titled Living History. It was an multi-disciplinary exploration -- through classical music, storytelling, poetry and musical theatre -- of how the perspectives of history shape our understanding of the world. It featured classical music of Chevalier de Saint-Georges, a performance from a member of the Flobots, and a presentation of his My Country, My Country musical inside the wildlife halls of the museum.  Writing and travels  After completing his undergraduate education, Weyi moved to Thailand, where he lived and worked at a meditation and martial arts school. He has written for numerous digital and print publications, and is known for his poetic essays, often addressing various humanist topics. He is also known for his travels, and has visited over 60 nations. After returning to Colorado in 2014, Weyi became an early adopter of the sharing economy, becoming a top host and community contact for Airbnb.  Performance work  In 2015, Weyi joined Playback Theatre West, Colorado's longest-running improvisational theatre company, which uses theater an empathy-building tool. In the same year, he also co-founded Storytellers Acapella, an all-male vocal quintet with the mission of bringing together communities with music and storytelling. Weyi has performed individually and with groups for various stakeholders to honor communities.  Empathy Museum  In 2019, Weyi was a featured storyteller of Denver's edition of the Empathy Museum, a travelling pop-up that encourages members of the public to walk in each other's shoes in order to increase understanding and compassion in cities. The project was originally founded by artist Clare Patey, and Denver's edition was put on by the Biennial of the Americas, also featuring stories from Suzi Q Smith, Mayor Michael B Hancock, and many others.  My Country, My Country musical  In 2016, Weyi began work on a stage musical focusing on Congolese independence in the backdrop of the Cold War named My Country, My Country. The piece highlights the story of Patrice Lumumba and Baudouin I of Belgium and the tumultuous time of nationalism and Communism around the world that eventually led to Lumumba's death. Weyi staged his first reading at the Denver Art Museum in 2018. In late 2018, Weyi became the first Coloradan to host a Massivemuse‚Äîa large, multidisciplinary arts event‚Äîfor national classical music company Groupmuse, which featured a staged reading of My Country, My Country and the music of Fanny Mendelssohn. Due to the strength of the piece and its positive reception, Weyi was named as an inaugural Playwright Fellow at the Denver Center for the Performing Arts, a new yearlong play-writing fellowship for four high-potential Colorado playwrights. In 2019, Weyi presented My Country, My Country twice more, including at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science and became a community voice to speak to the history of Congo during the Cold War.  Congolese presidential campaign  In 2014, Weyi's father, Emmanuel Weyi, announced that he would plan to run for president in the 2016 elections in the Democratic Republic of Congo when incumbent Joseph Kabila completed his second and last term in office as mandated by the DRC's constitution. Weyi was the head campaign architect and created the slogan \\"Stand By Me\\" for the campaign. Though slated for 2016, the election was delayed several times over two years‚Äîoften leading to violence‚Äîdue to what many thought was an intentional effort by Mr. Kabila to hold on to power. The election was eventually held in December 2018, with Kabila backing his former interior minister Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary. It was mired in controversy as results were delayed for weeks and nationwide communications blackouts raised suspicions about the election's veracity. Eventually, Felix Tshisekedi was named the winner. Despite many opposition leaders in Congo and the African Union calling for an extensive review of the election, Tshisekedi was eventually inaugurated. The main opposition leader, Martin Fayulu, who many presumed won the election, continues to maintain that he was true winner and called for nonviolent protest on several occasions. Emmanuel Weyi has also raised many questions about the validity of the electoral process given Congo's place as the most mineral rich nation in the world.

She works in a wide range of media including painting, sculpture, printmaking, book art, video, and installation. She currently works with blown glass and with smells to evoke memories and emotions in her project Diary of Smells. Is an on-going cross-disciplinary sensorial project considering the olfactory as protagonist among other typically dominant components in contemporary art such as video, sound, photography, bookart and installations. Each artwork represents a page from the diary such as Passages, Shards, Glass Ceiling, Affectio.  Education  Carvalho's higher education started at the Armando Alvares Penteado Foundation. Upon moving to the United States, Carvalho graduated with a bachelor's degree from the University of Washington, School of Architecture in 1967. After she transitioned into a teaching role, she taught at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, School of Architecture from 1971‚Äì1974.  Selected works   The Silkscreen Project (1976 - 1987)  Founder and director of The Silkscreen Project, which operated at St. Mark's Church in- the-Bowery from 1976 to 1987. to allow community members to learn silkscreen printing so that they‚Äôd be able to make posters and banners to use for protest and activism. * Recognition with community involvement and progress with the Silkscreen Project lead to Carvalho being invited to U.N. Mid-Decade Conference for Women, which covered issues relating to social, political, and economic discrimination toward female artists. Other women and conference attendees were taught how to silkscreen press as well. * Invited by the and the Workers Party back in Brazil to teach the how to create silkscreen banners that were going to be used for protest and activism. The party's leaders then passed down this information to community members that they worked with. Carvalho created the Latin American Women Artists to bring attention to other Latina artists in the United States. This project was initiated in 1983 and ended in 1987. * Series contained work from various Latina artists from various backgrounds and experiences to share their work, from poetry to films.  Book of Roofs (Livro de Telhas) (1997)  Interactive Installment - videos/photographs This project was initiated when Carvalho saw a stack of clay tiles and the worker's process of creating these tiles from the initial shaping stage to the final stage of having to place of the tiles. This process, and labor in specific, was art to Carvalho. The major theme in this installment, which include approximately 3,000 tiles, is the idea of shelter and how there is a loss of shelter with the involvement of wars and natural disasters. The loss and destruction of one's shelter then leads to a domino effect that leads to deterioration and damage to one's physical, psychological, and emotional loss of an individual. Carvalho implemented an interactive component which is available in two ways - the interactive website that's available online and allowing viewers become a tile-maker for this installment. In 2000, this online installment earned Carvalho Creative Capital Foundation individual artist grant. Access to installment can be found at http://bookofroofs.com/index.cfm  Ciranda I (1993)  Installation - Videos/photographs Bring attention to the abuse and violence of children in Brazil as many children had to rely on each other, sell their bodies into prostitution, become drug distributors, and steal whatever was accessible to them for survival. Many of these children were often killed by gunshot wound or decapitation by government officials or citizen vigilante groups to eradicate them from this region. The video installation for this piece featured images of Brazilian children, both dead and alive, and lists all the names and ages of the children that were found dead in Rio de Janeiro in the year 1991.  Rape and Intervention (1984)  Silkscreen This piece was created for the Artists Call Against the U.S. Intervention in Central America, which was a nationwide call to protest initiated by artists themselves in 1984. Using her notorious silkscreen printing that Carvalho is known for, it features a young girl at the top of the wearing only underwear with soldiers underneath her in military clothes and guns.

It aired in the United States on Fox on March 10, 2019. This episode was dedicated to Luke Perry who died on March 4, 2019 and previously guest-starred as himself in the episode \\"Krusty Gets Kancelled\\" (fourth season). The name of this episode is taken from a title of a Beatles' song from the album Abbey Road. Plot Marge and Homer are compelled to go to Drug and Alcohol Night of Knowledge (D.A.N.K.) at Springfield Suites‚Äô Convention Center so hire Shauna Chalmers to babysit, but her boyfriend Jimbo Jones sneaks into the house. Bored with the D.A.N.K. seminar they sneak out, but in the hallway are enticed to sneak into the Springfield Wedding Expo using name tags of the Heffernens. Meanwhile, at home Lisa and Maggie are traumatized by the horror movies Jimbo is playing, while Bart is mesmerized by Jimbo and Shauna making out. The kids leave to do a walk, and the babysitters throw a house party. Ned Flanders sees the kids and has them over for a mug of hot coconut milk. Back at the wedding expo, Homer and Marge, mistaken as Doctor and Mrs. Heffernen, are forced to improvise the expo's keynote speech, ‚ÄúNext Year's Wedding Trends‚Äù. Back home, Marge and Homer are in bliss because of their time together at the expo but the mood is almost soured when Homer finds the house party still in process, so he clears out the partyers. Homer, still feeling romantic, attempts to carry Marge upstairs. At the top, something snaps and they fall down the stairs. At the hospital, Marge has a sprained ankle, and Homer finds out he developed an inguinal hernia. Back at home, side effects of the medication makes him hallucinate his hernia, now named Wallace (Wallace Shawn), is talking to him in the form of a small man. The next day, at Springfield Physical Therapy, Marge gets trained by a New Zealander therapist named Nigel who talks her into learning kite-surfing. Wallace the hernia convinces Homer to blow off exercising, as well as a trip to the beach with Marge, causing a rift. The next day Marge is visibly disappointed when Homer uses his injury to get out of babysitting, she tells him to call Selma and Patty to help. They in turn abandon Homer in the woods while he sleeps. Meanwhile, in the park, Lisa, with no other couple to turn to, asks Jimbo and Shauna for advice, who tell her the parents should find common interests. Back at home, Lisa persuades Homer to drive the kids to the beach for her ‚Äúschool project‚Äù, while Maggie, who can see and hear Wallace, slaps the animated hernia. At the beach Homer recoils at how overweight Chief Wiggum is, and decides to join Marge kite-surfing, where they reconcile, but the wind blows their kites into a wind farm where they get new injuries. At the Springfield Police Station, Marge finds out from Chief Wiggum that Nigel is really a Russian spy named Dimitri, who was attempting to spy on Homer and Springfield's nuclear power plant. Wiggum and the Federal agents arrest Dimitri. In the epilogue, a trailer for a spy movie, Mission: Simpossible, that also stars Wallace the Hernia as a pastiche of the \\"Theme from Mission: Impossible\\" plays. Reception Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode a D, stating, \\"The show looks crisp, and vibrant, the show's animation melding its cartoonish elements with a uniquely pleasing color palette to pop like no other show on TV. The title is a reference to one of the Beatles‚Äô sludgiest and most un-commercial songs, a mesmerizingly plodding meditation on love and desire whose infamously abrupt ending feels like something breathtakingly catastrophic. There's a title card at the end of the episode bidding a sad farewell to memorable one-time guest star, Luke Perry, which is very sweet.\\" \\"I Want You (She's so Heavy)\\" scored a 0.8 rating with a 4 share and was watched by 2.21 million people, making The Simpsons Fox's second highest rated show of the night, behind Family Guy.

It was founded in the 1980s under the name Vaccination Risk Awareness Network (VRAN) and adopted its current name in 2014. The group has been contributing to vaccine hesitancy in Canada, encouraging citizens to forego immunization and legislators to support anti-vaccine regulations and legislation. Vaccine hesitancy VCC spreads the discredited hypothesis that vaccination causes autism and denies that the introduction of vaccines led to a decline of the targeted diseases. They blame vaccination for a variety of ailments, including autism spectrum disorders, learning disabilities, ADHD, allergies, and asthma. The group argues a vaccine against COVID-19 is unnecessary. Late in the pandemic, it still repeated the discredited myth that the pandemic is no more severe than the flu. Although a small fraction of vaccine doses provoke serious adverse reactions, health professionals agree the benefits of being protected against a wide range of infectious diseases far outweigh the risks. Responding directly to communications from Vaccine Choice Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada stated that the science on vaccines is unequivocal, but laments the actions of \\"a small but vocal anti-vaccination community that spreads false information. They use powerful emotional images and misinformation with their message. This creates confusion and fear for parents who are trying to make the best decisions for the health and wellbeing of their children.\\" Timothy Caulfield estimates the proportion of Canadians who exhibit vaccine hesitancy between 20 and 30 percent, connecting the anti- vaccination movement to a rise in populism and a mistrust in expertise. The World Health Organization has identified vaccine hesitancy as one of 2019's ten global health threats to watch. Role in COVID-19 pandemic Similarly to many anti-vaccination groups, Vaccine Choice Canada is opposing several measures instituted by public health authorities to limit the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Its President repeated some of the most widespread myths about the virus, including that it's no more dangerous than influenza and that developing a vaccine is therefore unnecessary. Influenza is actually responsible for 3,500 deaths in a typical year, while the death toll of four months of COVID-19 already exceeded 8,000 at that point. Jonathan Jarry from the Office for Science and Society warned that with anti-vaccination groups misrepresenting legitimate concerns about rushing vaccines into production as anti-vaccine arguments, \\"we have the beginnings of a perfect storm on our hands to fuel vaccine misinformation\\". Vaccine Choice Canada partnered newly- created group Hugs Over Masks, a newly-created group protesting against mandatory mask-wearing. With Denis Rancourt and others, Vaccine Choice Canada tabled a lawsuit against most Canadian governments, seeking to have the courts strike down measures mandated by public health authorities, including regulations introducing the obligation to wear masks in interior public spaces that several provinces adopted. The lawsuit, filed in July 2020 by lawyer Rocco Galati with the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, alleges lock downs, physical distancing and mandatory masking violate the constitutional rights of Canadians. It also makes wider claims about a \\"New (Economic) World Order\\" and a \\"massive and concentrated push for mandatory vaccines of every human on the planet earth with concurrent electronic surveillance\\" at the behest of \\"global Billionaire, Corporate and Organizational Oligarchs\\", which refer to conspiracy theories widely shared on social media by a variety of fringe groups. The lawsuit also names the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, accusing the information network of a \\"stalinist\\" campaign to hide the truth about public health measures. Public communications Vaccine Choice Canada reaches the Canadian public mainline through the internet, with its website and social media channels. However, it has recently experimented with other forms of public outreach. In February 2019, Vaccine Choice bought space on 50 billboards in the Toronto area to broadcast anti-vaccine messages, such as one inviting parents to learn how to get around the obligation to vaccinate children in order to have them attend public schools. The messages displayed on the billboards were characterized as \\"half-truths\\" by Toronto's Associate Medical Officer of Health. The campaign was discontinued by Outfront Media after a request from Toronto City Council. The campaign was denounced by Ontario health Minister Christine Elliott, who encouraged Ontarians to get inoculated. In August 2019, Vaccine Choice Canada admitted it had paid the expenses of American anti-vaccination activists coming to participate in parliamentary committee hearings on vaccine exemptions for school children in New Brunswick, including Bob Sears. During the hearings, VCC spokesperson Ted Kuntz indicated the group intended to take the province's government to court if it decided to eliminate non-medical exemptions. New Brunswick's Education Minister Dominic Cardy denounced the conspiracy theories presented by the witnesses: \\"If you believe in evidence-based decision-making, you have to look at the evidence, and the evidence is incontrovertible.\\" Also in early 2019, Vaccine Choice wrote to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to oppose upcoming changes that would make anti-vaccine messages less likely to be propagated by the social media platform, such as not sharing them as automatic recommendations. Speaking for VCC, Ted Kuntz equated these proposed changes in programming with censorship. A representative of the group also participated to a panel of anti-vaccination activists in Toronto, in April 2019. In October 2019, Vaccine Choice Canada held a rally in Toronto in support of a court case the group launched jointly with five parents against Ontario's Immunization of School Pupils Act, which requires that pupils must have received certain vaccines to attend the public school system. While legal experts believe the court challenge is unlikely to be successful, President of the Ontario Medical Association Sohail Gandhi is concerned the increased visibility gained by the group may result in more disinformation about vaccines being disseminated in the public. Vaccine Choice issued \\"Adding Insult To Injury Awards\\" in 2016 and 2017 to media outlets that produced news reports it disliked. The host of one program was thus targeted, The Sunday Edition's Michael Enright, sarcastically accepted the award with pride, on behalf of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. He took the opportunity to talk about pediatrician Peter Hotez's warning that anti-vaccine campaigns will lead to serious outbreaks of measles. The segment of the program VCC was reacting to was an interview with Brendan Nyhan about the \\"backfire effect\\".

Photography Koike arrived in Seattle in 1916 at the age of 38, and established a medical clinic in the downtown area near Main Street and 5th Avenue. Although he was a respected professional surgeon, his first love was photography. He was a participant in the first Frederick & Nelson art salon, noted for his pictorialist style, and innovative combination of an Eastern and Western aesthetic. He was a member of the Royal Photographic Society of Great Britain, and was designated a Fellow in 1928. He was also Director of the Associated Camera Clubs of America. His solo exhibitions included the Kodak Park Camera Club, Rochester, NY, 1926, the Portage Camera Club, Akron, Ohio, 1927, the Brooklyn Institute of Arts & Sciences in 1928, and The Art Institute of Seattle in 1929. Koike was the originator of the Seattle Camera Club. Given his thriving practice in the Japanese community in Seattle, his professional income allowed him not only to concentrate on his photography but to underwrite many of the expenses of forming the club. He was the editor of the club's newsletter Notan. He left all of his photographs and extensive records of the Seattle Camera Club to fellow club member Iwao Matsushita upon his death. Poetry Koike was also a noted poet, under the pen name Banjin. He was a member of the Rainier Ginsha, a Seattle Haiku poetry society formed in 1934 by poet Kyou Kawajiri. Internment during World War II During Internment of Japanese Americans in World War II all of his photographic equipment was confiscated by the U.S. government, and he was taken to the Minidoka War Relocation Center in Idaho. While being detained he formed a new poetry society called Minidoka Ginsha. By 1945, the group consisted of over 158 poets. Koike became ill in the camps and died in 1947, shortly after his release.

In 1974 he was jailed for promoting the Islamist regime and was killed in jail in 1978. Niazi is remembered as the father of Political Islam in Afghanistan. He believed Islam had an important role in the social and political structure of Afghanistan. Many of Afghanistan's most prominent politicians are influenced by the groundwork Niazi laid.  Early years  Gholam Mohammad Niazi was born in 1932 in the Andar district of the Ghazni province which lies east of central Afghanistan. He spent his early childhood in Andar before moving to Kabul for primary education.  Education  Al-Azhar University in the early 1930s. Niazi attended the local Hajwiri primary public school and then transferred to the Abu Haneefa school in Kabul. He was very successful in school, so he was given the opportunity to further his studies in Egypt. Niazi enrolled in Al-Azhar University in Cairo, where he obtained a master's degree in Islamic law in 1957. He was one of the first Afghan students to study Islam in Egypt. Niazi's educational path was uncommon in Afghanistan. Traditionally ulema studied in private madrasa in Afghanistan and the few Afghans that had the opportunity to study abroad studied in Pakistan. The influx of Afghani students studying in Egypt brought new Middle Eastern political influence to Afghanistan. Niazi led the way for new modernist and politicized intellectuals to abandon traditional madrasa.  Time in Egypt  During his studies in Cairo, Niazi joined the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood. The Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood deeply influenced his visions of Islam and triggered his conception of an Islamic movement in Afghanistan. Sayyid Qutb was his main source of intellectual inspiration. Specifically, Niazi's advocacy for a legal system exclusively based on Sharia law is rooted in Qutb‚Äôs works. In 1954, Nasser, the president of Egypt, outlawed the Muslim Brotherhood. The Muslim Brotherhood became an underground organization. This greatly shaped Niazi's experience of activism. The Muslim Brotherhood‚Äôs emphasis on popular support and connection with the masses inspired Niazi's political strategy.  Political career  Flag of Jamiat-e Islami Niazi returned to Afghanistan from Egypt in 1957. Upon arrival he spread his ideas in intellectual circles throughout Kabul. He established a cell at an Abu Haneefa seminary in Paghman, a suburb of Kabul, and held informal meetings with other professors and intellectuals to spread his ideas. Initially, they secretly gathered, but they became a formal political organization named Jamiat-e Islami in 1972. Niazi was the president of the organization, which had as members such as Sebghatullah Mojaddidi and Minhajuddin Gahiz among others.  Ideology  Niazi opposed westernization and communism because of their secular nature. He called for a spiritual revolution and emphasized the need to obtain a deep knowledge of Islam. Niazi believed religion and science should go hand in hand. He worked towards establishing a new education model that followed the ideas and principles of the Muslim Brotherhood. Niazi rigorously studied Islamic history and applied a political science lens to his learnings to understand the failures of past Islamic regimes. His publication, Majalle-ye Shariat (Review of Muslim Law) reinforced the Islamic movement and supported establishing an Islamic government in Afghanistan. While his ideology was highly intellectual in nature, he also supported the formation of an armed branch within the movement to be prepared to take action if necessary.  Muslim Youth  Many of the members of Jamiat-e Islami were professors, so they often spread their ideas directly to their students. The Islamist ideas spread rapidly among students in Kabul, and the students created the Sazman-e Jawanan-e musalman (Muslim youth) in 1969. They became a militant student organization that opposed Zionism, American and Soviet imperialism, the partition of Pakistan and the Afghan Monarchy. They supported an Islamic social justice system with more equitable economic redistribution. The student movement, inspired by Niazi, operated more overtly than Jamiat-e Islami and harbored important politicians such as Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and Burhanuddin Rabbani. When the communist party was established in 1965, the students of the Islamist political party overtly expressed their disagreements which caused a lot of disorder and resistance at Kabul University between 1965 and 1972. The secretive nature of Niazi's political engagement makes it difficult to evaluate his role in the Muslim Youth. Rabbani claims that the student movement was obedient to Niazi and the Professors. On the other hand, Hekmatyar argues that Muslim Youth and the Professors were completely separate, despite their shared ideological perspectives, because the Professors feared overt opposition to the Afghan political structure would put their positions at risk.  Political participation  Niazi never directly participated in protests or demonstrations, but he instigated and inspired many. He likely did not participate due to fear of government repression. In spring 1971, he initiated a demonstration in Kabul in reaction to the publication of a communist journal that he deemed blasphemy. Tens of thousands of people demonstrated throughout the streets of Kabul, making it the largest demonstration in the history of the city. Despite his secretive nature, Niazi leveraged his position as the Dean of the Religious Science Faculty at Kabul University to advocate for official reforms. He used his institutional power to expand the Islamic Studies department at the university and to amend the entrance exam to include religious knowledge as a compulsory subject. Additionally, Niazi tried to spread his ideas to other countries to trigger the creation of Islamic movements. In 1970, he and another professor attended the Peace Conference of Soviet Muslims, held in Tashkent. At the conference, they expressed their support to the Muslims repressed under communism. Despite having some personal connections with figures of political Islam in Egypt, Pakistan, and India, Niazi and the Professors were never able to create meaningful institutional ties with any Islamic Movement abroad.  Challenges to the Islamic movement in Afghanistan  Flag of the Communist (Maoist) Party of Afghanistan. Due to the covert nature of the Islamist movement, Gholam Mohammad Niazi and the Islamist movement faced numerous challenges. Initially, challenges to the movement were contained to the Kabul University campus and were mainly perpetrated by rival communist student groups, inspired by the Communist Party of Afghanistan. As the Islamist movement grew new challenges arose outside of the university.  Communism  The Islamist student movement led by Professor Gholam Mohammad Niazi faced numerous challenges from communist groups. Between 1965 and 1972, the University became a site of clashes between the anti-communist Islamists and the communist student groups. These clashes took place on the University's different campuses and were bloody at times.  Opposition of traditional Ulema  The ulema was initially skeptical of the Muslim youth movement taking place at the Kabul University. Except for the ulema in three provinces, Nangrahar, Kunar and Laghman, there was little cooperation between religious leaders and Islamist student movements. This was primarily due to mutual distrust between the two groups. The Ulema saw the youth movement as radical whereas the students saw the ulema as too conservative. However, this distrust was not felt by Professor Mohammad Niazi, he, along with his fellow professors, wished to maintain friendly relations with the ulema.  Government repression  After taking power through a bloodless coup in 1973, Mohammed Daud Khan proclaimed himself President of the newly instated Republic of Afghanistan which officially ended monarchy in the state. His pro-soviet political party, the National Revolutionary Party, did not have the high levels of popularity originally envisaged. Daud undertook repressive action against the different factions of opposition beginning with the Islamists. In 1974, in cooperation with Communist members of the police, Daud ordered the arrests of Islamist militants. Among those arrested was Gholam Mohammad Niazi. Many of those who were not arrested fled to Pakistan where the Islamist movement regrouped. In 1975, Pakistan exiled Afghan Islamist groups led violent attacks in the northeast of Afghanistan prompting further crackdowns by the Daud regime.  Death  During the period of targeted Islamist repression by Daud's authoritarian regime, Gholam Mohammad Niazi was jailed in 1972, but he was released soon after. In 1974 he was jailed again in Pul-e-Charkhi prison, along with many other Islamists. Two hundred known prisoners, including Gholam Niazi and Mawlawi Fayzani, were kept without judgment. After four years of imprisonment, Niazi was killed in prison in June 1978. The circumstances of his death remain unclear. Accounts differ as to whether he was summarily executed with other Islamists or if he was murdered by prison guards. It is also debated whether the Soviets were involved in his death, directly, indirectly, or at all.  Legacy  Burhanuddin Rabbani serving as President of the Islamic State of Afghanistan. Gholam Mohammad Niazi is remembered as the father of political Islam in Afghanistan. He was successful in transforming Islam into a political movement by utilizing the power of popular support. However, the Islamic movement he established did not achieve unity. After Niazi's death, the remaining members of the Jamiat-e Islami were exiled, and the movement quickly fragmented.  Notable affiliations   Burhanuddin Rabbani  Burhanuddin Rabbani was a professor at Kabul University who became the leader of the Jamiat-e Islami in 1972. He succeeded Gholam Mohammad Niazi as founder and transitioned the organization from a secretive group into a formal Islamist political party. Rabbani was exiled in 1974 due to the state's desire to repress opposing parties and views. Under the Peshawar Accords, he served as the country's president from 1992 to 2001.  Gulbuddin Hekmatyar  Gulbuddin Hekmatyar was an engineering student at Kabul University. He was an Islamic student said who was attracted to Niazi's political ideology. Hekmatyar was a member of the Muslim Youth. While participating in demonstrations, he threw acid in women's faces and famously assassinated Saidal, a member of the Showla-i-Javid, a Mao- ist political party at Kabul University. Later, in 1975 he founded the Hezb-i Islami, a segment of the Jamiat-e Islami who split under Rabbani's leadership. In 1992, he became Prime Minister of the new post-Soviet regime. Sayyaf (left) as Afghan mujahideencommander in 1984.  Abdul Rassul Sayyaf  Abdul Rassul Sayyaf was a professor at Kabul University. In 1972, he became the deputy of the Jamiat-e Islami. He was exiled from Afghanistan and then jailed for affiliation with Gholam Mohammad Niazi and his political group in 1973. Sayyaf was highly against the political rule of then King Zahir Shah.

Since then, numerous women have been infected with the HIV/AIDS virus. The main direct causes of HIV and AIDS are sexual activity and drug use.  History  Historically, women have often been excluded from HIV and AIDS advocacy, treatment, and research. At the start of the AIDS epidemic in 1981, medical and scientific communities did not recognize women as a group for research. Women were excluded from clinical trials of medication and preventative measures. They were also often blocked from being subjects in clinical research with exclusionary with restrictions like \\"no pregnant or non-pregnant women\\". The National Institutes of Health (NIH) rejected grants that were targeted at understanding HIV in low-income women of ethnic minorities. This lack of attention is often attributed to the prominence of the gay rights movement in the area of HIV and AIDS. HIV's clinical symptoms differ between men and women, and the focus on male symptoms caused medical professionals to overlook symptoms in women. The first case of HIV in a woman in the US was reported in 1981. In December 1982, the first cases of mother-to-child HIV transmission were recorded. The number of children infected with the virus increased throughout the decade. Zidovudine (ZDV), alternatively named azidothymidine (AZT), was introduced as a drug to treat HIV in the late 1980s, reducing the chance of mother-to-child transmission by up to 70%. , women account for about 20% of reported HIV cases. The two major modes of transmission to women are heterosexual sexual intercourse and intravenous drug use. Factors that increase the likelihood of HIV in women include lack of access to high-quality healthcare, injecting drugs, being a sex worker, and low income. Due to shame, many women who have been diagnosed to have HIV or AIDS do not report the matter to others or seek proper treatment.  Timeline  1982 * The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) declared \\"prostitutes\\" a risk category of contracting HIV. * Female (as well as male) drug users were observed to contract the disease. 1983 * The NIH began to hire female nurses such as Barbara Fabian Baird to research AIDS. * The Women's AIDS Network was established. * The CDC added \\"female sexual partners of males with AIDS\\" as a risk category. 1984 * Social worker Caitlyn Ryan became the first executive director of AID Atlanta, the oldest AIDS service organization in the Southwestern US. 1985 * The San Francisco AIDS Foundation produced its first brochure about women and AIDS. * The San Francisco General Hospital, for the first time, admitted a woman to the AIDS ward (Ward 5B). 1986 * Women represented 7% of cases of AIDS in the US. * The first book about AIDS policy, AIDS: A Public Health Challenge, was co-authored by Caitlyn Ryan. It served as a guide to many public officials. * Marie St. Cyr became the first director of the -based Women and AIDS Resource Network (WARN). 1987 * The NIH allocated 13.5% of its total budget to women's health issues. * At the time, women were excluded from HIV trials unless they used birth control. No specifically AIDS- or HIV-related medical assistance or gynecological (relating to the female reproductive system and the breasts) care was provided. *The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved ZDV (AZT) as the first antiretroviral drug to treat AIDS. 1988 * An article in the magazine Cosmopolitan incorrectly stated that women are able to have sexual intercourse with HIV-positive men without risk of contracting HIV if they have \\"healthy vaginas\\".Maggenti, Maria.

Jawali was designated successor to Jikirmish by Muhammad I Tapar when he attacked and killed his predecessor, thus becoming atabeg in 1106, seizing Mosul and his hostage Baldwin. Joscelin I, himself ransomed in 1107, started negotiations with Jawali over the release of Baldwin. Jawali demanded a ransom and the release of Muslim prisoners from Edessa. Muhammad later was unhappy with the growing power of Jawali and dispatched Mawdud to unseat him. Expelled from Mosul, Jawali fled to the fortress of Qal‚Äôat Ja‚Äôbar, taking Baldwin with him. Jawali accepted a ransom offer by Joscelin and released Baldwin in the summer of 1108. Mawdud became atabeg of Mosul in 1109.

Baiersdorf entered the margrave's service in 1670, becoming highly esteemed at Ernst's court, at the same time using his influence for the good of his coreligionists. He influenced the margrave to issue a decree in 1695 granting the Jews freedom of trade, and it was chiefly through his influence that they were allowed to stay in the land in peace. In 1700, for a short time his position at the court was shaken by a hostile counselor of the margrave, but it was soon re-established. In the same year he gave his daughter in marriage to a son of Gl√ºckel of Hameln, Moses Hameln, who became later on rabbi at Baiersdorf. Under Baiersdorf's influence, a 'Jews' corporation' was organized in the Margraviate of Bayreuth in 1709 which bought additional privileges in regard to rabbinical jurisdiction and to establish two cemeteries.

It is a monotypic genus, and the only species in the genus is Promachocrinus kerguelensis. This is a coldwater crinoid which is found in the seas around Antarctica and surrounding island groups, including under the sea ice. Description This crinoid is one of two living genera that has ten radial ossicles, each giving rise to a pair of arms; there is a single canal in each radial ossicle and no basal rays. At the base are a number of clawed structures known as cirri. Distribution and habitat P. kerguelensis is endemic to the waters of Antarctica. Its range includes the Graham Land peninsula, the South Shetland Islands, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, Bouvet Island, Heard Islands and the Kerguelen Islands. The type locality is at the Kerguelen Islands, and it is from here that it gets its specific name. It occurs at depths between about . This is a common and abundant species in the waters around Antarctica, but molecular studies have suggested that it may not be a single species. As many as five or six different \\"phylogroups\\" have been identified, each having a circumpolar distribution, being sympatric (living alongside each other) and being adapted to a wide range of depths. The large depth range of this species may be because its non-feeding larvae have a yolk which makes them buoyant, giving them a wide dispersal potential but a limited ability to select where to settle. Ecology These crinoids inhabit either rocky areas or soft sediments and can move about using their cirri to grip the substrate, or swim by flapping their arms. They are suspension feeders, choosing locations with strong currents and extending their arms, catching plankton and suspended particles floating past with the tube feet on the pinnules. The tube feet are covered with sticky mucus that traps the food particles, which are then rolled into balls and moved along the ambulacral groove in the arms by cilia which propel them to the mouth.

Birth and education Alfred Wyndham was the second son of Captain Alexander Wadham Wyndham (d1869) and Emma (n√©e Trevelyan) of West Lodge, Blandford in Dorset. His mother, an accomplished artist, was the daughter of Sir John Trevelyan Bt of Nettlecombe, Somerset. Following his great-uncle Dr Thomas Wyndham (clergyman) and other members of the Wyndham family since the 17th century, he was educated at Sherborne in the Dorset town of that name. He was brought up at the West Lodge estate in the Cranbourne Chase where hunting became a favourite pastime, and at the family's sporting estate at Burrishoole, co Mayo, Ireland. The Burrishoole estate had been acquired by Captain Wyndham in the 1850s from the Rev John Harvey Ashworth (author of The Saxon in Ireland, Rathlynn and other books), and there he built Burrishoole House which was completed in 1862. West Lodge, Dorset, where Colonel Alfred Wyndham was born and brought up Burrishoole House, county Mayo, Ireland, built by Alfred Wyndham's father, Captain Alexander Wadham Wyndham Dinton Ranch, Alberta, Canada, from a painting by Colonel Alfred Wyndham. Mrs Wyndham recorded moving in when the temperature was ‚àí20 ¬∞F in 1887 Beatrice Wyndham who inherited her father's political interests and after whom the Beatrice Wyndham Park nature reserve in Okotoks is named. Biography Despite being born into one of the most influential and wealthy families in the West Country, Alfred Wyndham's early adult years were riddled with indecision. He left the Royal Naval College, having decided against a career at sea, and in 1855 enlisted as an ensign in the Royal Wiltshire Militia and spent a time on garrison duty in a number of Mediterranean outposts. In 1858 Wyndham decided to emigrate to Canada and, leaving the Militia, he settled in Simcoe County in southern Ontario, where he became a prominent gentleman farmer with a pretty house on the shore of Lake Simcoe. He contracted a good marriage in the following year, and maintained his military connections by volunteering for the 12th Regiment, York Rangers, a militia regiment. His promotion was steady until in 1882 he was appointed Lt-Colonel commanding the regiment. Thus it was that at the outbreak of the North-West Rebellion by the M√©tis people under Louis Riel in 1885, Colonel Wyndham commanded the 12th York Rangers in the field, where he and his regiment were involved in several hard skirmishes with the rebels across Northwest Territories. Colonel Wyndham also led his regiment into the Battle of Batoche where the success of federal government forces resulted in the crushing of the rebellion and the surrender and hanging of Louis Riel. One long-term outcome of this victory was that the Prairie Provinces became controlled by English rather than French speakers. In leading his regiment across the Northwest Territories, Colonel Wyndham came to admire the wild beauty of Alberta and recognised its agricultural potential. He decided to return west in 1886 and was given a North-West Rebellion script on one quarter, and another quarter of homestead land, at a prime site by the Bow river near Carseland to the south east of Calgary, a combined total of 320 acres. His wife and children followed in 1887, Mrs Wyndham recording in her diary that the family moved into their cottonwood log house at a temperature of below zero. Colonel Wyndham soon became one of the most prominent ranchers in Alberta. He named his ranch Dinton, after his family's ancestral home and estate in Wiltshire, and soon the whole district became known as Dinton, acquiring a post office and an Anglican church dedicated to St Thomas which stands to this day.Lucille H Campey, Ignored but Not Forgotten: Canada's English Immigrants, Toronto, 2014 Colonel Wyndham remained deeply interested in Territorial politics and ran for the Conservative party in the territorial government in 1898, losing to the Liberal candidate. He maintained a strong interest in political affairs and the pages of the Okotoks Review were often filled with his political commentary on provincial and national events.Austin Mardon, Alberta Anglican Politicians, 2013'Austin Mardon and Ernest Mardon, The Men of the Dawn: Alberta Politicians from the North West Territories of the District of Alberta and Candidates for the First Alberta General Election, 1991 He was also a talented amateur artist, working mostly in watercolour, and one of his paintings can be found in the Royal Ontario Museum. Colonel Wyndham has been described as the nearest thing to a squire in OkotoksLewis Gwynne Thomas, Patrick Alexander Dunae, Ranchers' Legacy: Alberta Essays, University of Alberta Press, 1986 although his eccentricity was sometimes marked. One of his wife's cousins said of him that he was an honest, true-hearted Christian gentleman, but having come to Canada with a good deal of money, he was of that type who seem to be born with a genius for muddling away wealth. She did concede however that if he lost money, he also won respect and affection, and that long after his death there were many who had cause to bless the name of The dear old Colonel.Lucille H Campey, Ignored but Not Forgotten: Canada's English Immigrants, Toronto, 2014 Family A year after arriving in Simcoe County, Wyndham married Caroline Elizabeth, daughter of the prominent Ontario lawyer and politician John Stuart and Elizabeth (n√©e Van Rensellaer Powell). In what was the first divorce in Upper Canada, John Stuart had sued his wife's lover, Lieutenant John Grogan, for adultery in 1839 and won ¬£600 plus costs, forcing Grogan to sell his commission. Royal assent, in the form of An Act for the Relief of John Stuart, was granted in 1841. Colonel and Mrs Wyndham had eleven children, Alexander (b. 1860), Agnes Stuart (b. 1862), Walter Trevelyan (b. 1864), Emma Ethel (b. 1866), Ernest Alfred (b. 1868), Spencer (b. 1869), Charles Wadham (b. 1872), Beatrice Ida Wyndham (b. 1874), Julia (b. 1876), Mary Sophia (b. 1878), and John Stuart (b. 1880). Most of the boys were educated in England and continued to farm and keep a hand in military service like their father. Colonel Wyndham's political interests perhaps found the greatest expression in his daughter Beatrice who, in 1919, became the first woman ever elected to public office in Okotoks. She served on the Okotoks School Board for 12 years, on the Okotoks Agricultural Society's fair board, volunteered with the Red Cross, was a member of the St. Peter's Anglican Church women's auxiliary and the Okotoks Book Club; altogether a tireless community worker. She was also an avid curler with the Wild Cat Team, a fitting name for a tenacious woman who was not afraid to stand up for her beliefs. The Beatrice Wyndham Park, a nature reserve and bird sanctuary in Okotoks, is named after her. Colonel Arthur Wyndham died on 10 March 1914 at the age 79, and was buried at Okotoks, Alberta.

She still works at the Whittington Press as a compositor and illustrator. She has created images for other fine press publishers, including the Folio Society and Primrose Hill Press. Macgregor is a self-taught wood engraver and member of the Society of Wood Engravers and Royal Society of Painter-Printmakers. She has furnished wood engravings for the horticultural journal, Hortus, in addition to countless wood engravings and pochoir illustrations for books and posters published by the Whittington Press. In addition to the texts she has illustrated, her subjects primarily concern English rural life, farming, architecture, botany, and felines. Macgregor has published several collections of her own images, and curated a collection of contemporary wood engravings of cats, published by Primrose Hill Press in 1999 as Cat cuts.

The running mass of a fermion or massive boson depends on the energy scale at which the observation occurs, in a way described by a renormalization group equation (RGE) and calculated by a renormalization scheme such as the on-shell scheme or the minimal subtraction scheme. The running mass refers to a Lagrangian parameter whose value changes with the energy scale at which the renormalization scheme is applied. A calculation, typically done by a computerized algorithm intractable by paper calculations, relates the running mass to the pole mass. The algorithm typically relies on a perturbative calculation of the self energy. Propagator pole A loop in a Feynman diagram requires an integral over a continuum of possible energies and momenta. In general, the integrals of products of Feynman propagators diverge at propagator poles, and the divergences must be removed by renormalization. The process of renormalization might be thought of as a theory of cancellations of virtual particle paths, thus revealing the \\"bare\\" or renormalized physics, such as the pole mass.

The court considered that the actions taken by Flesch were not criminal. In 2018 Flesch had been mentioned in an inquiry of plea deals between JBS executives and the district attorney (DA) in Brazil. In 2017 she sued the Trench Rossi Watanabe law firm after she was fired in an episode in which former DA Marcello Miller was hired by Trench to participate in negotiations of plea deals with JBS. Amongst the reasons for the lawsuit were access to documents that the firm declined to provide. In April 2018 her request was granted by the S√£o Paulo Court of Law (TJSP). A report in the Folha de S. Paulo newspaper revealed that before she was fired, Flesch ‚Äúwas interviewed in the United States by four members of Baker McKenzie in a locked room for ten hours.‚Äù In the case, Flesch confirmed that the decision to hire the former DA was taken by a committee. In December 2018, VEJA magazine disclosed that Esther Flesch's defence had proof, including an e-mail, that revealed that the administration of Trench Rossi Watanabe had knowledge of the deal made with JBS. This included a bill in the amount of 700,000 reals sent to the company by the firm.

The New Jersey Midland Railway (NJM) was formed in 1870 as a consolidation of several smaller railroads. By March 1872, the NJM line had been extended west from Hackensack, with stations at Maywood, Paterson (at Vreeland Avenue and two others) Wortendyke, and Butler, among others, to Newfoundland. It was later extended to Sparta, Newton, Blairstown and across the Delaware River to Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania. Soon thereafter trains were running east and south to the Hudson River waterfront at Pennsylvania Railroad's depot in Jersey City using the Bergen Hill Cut.

History First Defenders from Pennsylvania, who later became members of the 25th Pennsylvania Infantry, were quartered in mid-April 1861 at the U.S. Capitol Building in Washington, D.C. (shown here on March 4, 1861). In anticipation of the call by President Abraham Lincoln for volunteer troops to assist in the defense of the nation's capital following the firing on Fort Sumter by Confederate States forces on April 12, 1861, 476 officers and enlisted men from the communities of Allentown, Lewistown, Pottsville, and Reading, Pennsylvania, who were already active with existing militia units in those communities (the Allen Rifles of Allentown, Logan Guard of Lewiston, National Light Infantry and Washington Infantry of Pottsville, and Ringgold Light Artillery of Reading), began equipping themselves on April 13, and assembled in Harrisburg on April 17, two days after Lincoln issued his proclamation requesting the response of 75,000 volunteers. Administered the oath of service on April 18, 1861 at the railroad station in Harrisburg, they departed aboard Northern Central Railroad boxcars, and arrived at noon at the Bolton Station in Baltimore, Maryland, where they disembarked. After marching two miles to the Camden Station, they boarded a new train and headed for Washington, D.C., where they arrived at 6:00 p.m. Later given the honorific of \\"First Defenders\\" in recognition of their prompt action, they were initially stationed in various rooms of the United States House of Representatives and Senate before moving to the U.S. Capitol Building where, at 9:00 p.m. that same evening, they were issued new Springfield rifles and ammunition as Lincoln and key members of his cabinet looked on. Afterward, Lincoln shook the hand of each volunteer.Thompson, Heber Samuel. The First Defenders, pp. 1-15.

On the same day that these First Defenders were arriving in Washington, the remainder of the regiment, which would ultimately be designated as the 25th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry, was being organized in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania by Colonel Henry L. Cake, Lieutenant Colonel John B. Selheimer and Major James H. Campbell. They were then also transported via train to Washington, D.C. by way of Baltimore. Initially assigned to the Department of Washington, Companies A, G and H of the First Defenders (the Ringgold Light Artillery, Logan Guard, and Allen Rifles) were quartered in the U.S. Capitol Building, and assigned to guard the Washington Arsenal and Washington Navy Yard while Companies D and E (the Logan Guard and Washington Artillery) were stationed at Fort Washington.

Located entirely within Nemaha County, K-187 runs from K-9 in Centralia north to U.S. Route 36 (US-36) west of Seneca. It is a paved, two-lane road for its entire length. K-187 was established as a state highway on March 9, 1955. Route description K-187 begins at K-9, also known as John Riggins Avenue, in Centralia and begins traveling north along 2nd Street. The highway exits the city after about as it continues north through rural farmlands. After roughly it crosses Weyer Creek, a tributary of North Fork Black Vermillion River. Another approximately north it intersects Stringtown Road also known as Rural Secondary 1228 (RS-1228). It continues north through more rural farmlands and after another roughly it has an at-grade crossing with a Union Pacific Railroad track. From here it continues north and ends at US-36 west of Seneca. The Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT) tracks the traffic levels on its highways, and in 2017, they determined that on average the traffic was 915 vehicles per day. The entire route is paved with partial design bituminous pavement. K-187 is not included in the National Highway System. The National Highway System is a system of highways important to the nation's defense, economy, and mobility. K-187 does connect to the National Highway System at its junction with US-36. History Before state highways were numbered in Kansas there were Auto trails, which were an informal network of marked routes that existed in the United States and Canada in the early part of the 20th century. K-187's southern terminus closely follows the former Kansas White Way and the northern terminus closely follows the former Pikes Peak Ocean to Ocean Highway. K-187 was assigned by the State Highway Commission of Kansas, now known as KDOT, on March 9, 1955, and its alignment has not changed since. K-187's southern terminus, K-9, originally went south from Centralia then east to K-63 in Corning. Then in a different March 9, 1955 resolution, K-9 was approved to be realigned to go directly east to K-63 from Centralia.

The artist neither signed nor dated it, but it was produced in the first phase of his career, probably between 1620 and 1625. It is also known as The Hurdy-Gurdy Player in a Hat (Le Vielleur au chapeau) or The Hurdy-Gurdy Player with a Fly (Le Vielleur √† la mouche). It is now in the Mus√©e d'Arts de Nantes. Description The painting depicts an impoverished blind beggar singing in the street to the music of his hurdy-gurdy, an instrument traditionally associated with street singers. The hurdy-gurdy, portrayed in great detail in de la Tour's canvas, works by means of a hand turned wheel rubbing against a set of strings, whose pitch can be adjusted by hand operated wedges. The beggars distorted face and worn clothing are designed to invoke sympathy in the viewer for his situation. The existence of a fly on the singer's doublet (above his right knee) gives the work its alternative name and, in its proximity to such a beautiful instrument, can be interpreted as a comment on the fragility of life.  History, attribution and provenance The first recorded mention of the work is in the collection of the Nantes-born diplomat Fran√ßois Cacault (1847-1805) at Clisson - a posthumous assessment of his collection on 6 November 1808 called the work \\"very capital\\", attributed it to Murillo and valued it at 6000 francs. The city collection bought it and it was hung in mayor Bertrand Geslin's office in the town hall, before being moved to its present home in 1830. From 1830 until 1903 the museum's catalogues noted it as a work by Murillo or the Spanish school. In 1836 Prosper M√©rim√©e, then inspector general of France's historic monuments, admired the work during a trip to survey paintings in western France. From 1923 doubts about the attribution of the painting began to surface but it was not until 1934‚Äì35 that general acceptance of its authorship, primarily by comparison with other similar works by the artist, was achieved.

First deployed on the Boeing KC-46 Air Force tanker, MCAS adjusts the horizontal stabilizer trim to push the nose down when the aircraft is operating in manual flight, with flaps up, at an elevated angle of attack (AoA), so the pilot will not inadvertently pull the airplane up too steeply, potentially causing a stall. However, in both cases, MCAS activated by erroneous indications from its sensors. During aircraft certification, Boeing removed a description of MCAS in the MAX flight manuals, leaving pilots unaware of the system when the airplane entered service. On November 10, 2018, twelve days after Lion Air Flight 610 crashed, Boeing publicly revealed MCAS in a discussion with airline operators and other aviation interests. Yet, a recovery procedure highlighted by Boeing and the FAA failed to prevent the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, which led to the global grounding of all 737 MAX aircraft pending investigations and software fixes. In April 2019, Boeing admitted that MCAS played a role in both accidents and asserted that MCAS is not an anti-stall system. On the Boeing 737 MAX, MCAS was intended to mimic pitching behavior similar to aircraft in the previous generation of the series, the Boeing 737 NG. The investigations identified numerous defects with associated systems, including an AoA disagree message that should have prevented MCAS activation. The Wall Street Journal reported that Boeing failed to share information about that issue for \\"about a year\\" before the Lion Air crash in Indonesia.  MCAS on the 737 MAX  The MAX uses an adjustable stabilizer, moved by a jackscrew, to provide the required pitch trim forces. Generic stabilizer illustrated. The (MCAS) flight control law was implemented on the 737 MAX to mitigate the aircraft's tendency to pitch up because of the aerodynamic effect of its larger, heavier, and more powerful CFM LEAP-1B engines and nacelles. The stated goal of MCAS, according to Boeing, was to provide consistent aircraft handling characteristics at elevated angles of attack in certain unusual flight conditions only and hence make the 737 MAX perform similarly to its immediate predecessor, the 737NG.  MCAS's role in the accidents  The tracking data of Lion Air Flight 610 from Flightradar24 The vertical airspeeds of the Boeing 737 MAX 8s involved in the JT 610 and ET 302 crashes Investigators determined that MCAS was triggered by falsely high angle of attack (AoA) inputs, as if the plane had pitched up excessively. On both flights, shortly after takeoff, MCAS repeatedly actuated the horizontal stabilizer trim motor to push down the airplane nose. Satellite data for the flights, ET 302 and JT 610, showed that the planes struggled to gain altitude. Pilots reported difficulty controlling the airplane and asked to return to the airport. On March 11, 2019, after China had grounded the aircraft, Boeing published some details of new system requirements for the MCAS software and for the cockpit displays, which it began implementing in the wake of the prior accident five months earlier: * If the two AoA sensors disagree with the flaps retracted, MCAS will not activate and an indicator will alert the pilots. * If MCAS is activated in non-normal conditions, it will only \\"provide one input for each elevated AoA event.\\" * Flight crew will be able to counteract MCAS by pulling back on the column. On March 27, Daniel Elwell, the acting administrator of the FAA, testified before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, saying that on January 21, \\"Boeing submitted a proposed MCAS software enhancement to the FAA for certification. ... the FAA has tested this enhancement to the 737 MAX flight control system in both the simulator and the aircraft. The testing, which was conducted by FAA flight test engineers and flight test pilots, included aerodynamic stall situations and recovery procedures.\\" After a series of delays, the updated MCAS software was released to the FAA in May 2019. On May 16, Boeing announced that the completed software update was awaiting approval from the FAA. The flight software underwent 360 hours of testing on 207 flights. Boeing also updated existing crew procedures. The implementation of MCAS has been found to disrupt autopilot operations. On April 4, 2019 Boeing publicly acknowledged that MCAS played a role in both accidents.  Purpose of MCAS and the stabilizer trim system  The FAA and Boeing both refuted media reports describing MCAS as an anti-stall system, which Boeing asserted it is distinctly not. The aircraft had to perform well in a low-speed stall test. The \\"considers that the STS/MCAS and elevator feel shift (EFS) functions could be considered as stall identification systems or stall protection systems, depending on the natural (unaugmented) stall characteristics of the aircraft\\". The JATR said, \\"MCAS used the stabilizer to change the column force feel, not trim the aircraft. This is a case of using the control surface in a new way that the regulations never accounted for and should have required an issue paper for further analysis by the FAA. If the FAA technical staff had been fully aware of the details of the MCAS function, the JATR team believes the agency likely would have required an issue paper for using the stabilizer in a way that it had not previously been used; this [might have] identified the potential for the stabilizer to overpower the elevator.\\"  Description  an angle of attack (AOA) sensor  Background  The Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) is a flight control law built into the Boeing 737 MAX's flight control computer, designed to help the aircraft emulate the handling characteristics of the earlier Boeing 737 Next Generation. According to an international Civil Aviation Authorities team review (JATR) commissioned by the FAA, MCAS may be a stall identification or protection system, depending on the natural (unaugmented) stall characteristics of the aircraft. Boeing considered MCAS part of the flight control system, and elected to not describe it in the flight manual or in training materials, based on the fundamental design philosophy of retaining commonality with the 737NG. Minimizing the functional differences between the Boeing 737 MAX and Next Generation aircraft variants allowed both variants to share the same type rating. Thus, airlines can save money by employing and training one pool of pilots to fly both variants of the Boeing 737 interchangeably. When activated, MCAS directly engages the horizontal stabilizer, thus is distinct from an anti-stall device, such as stick pusher, which physically moves the pilot's control column forward and engages the airplane's elevators when the airplane is approaching a stall. Boeing's former CEO Dennis Muilenburg said \\"[MCAS] has been reported or described as an anti-stall system, which it is not. It's a system that's designed to provide handling qualities for the pilot that meet pilot preferences.\\" The 737 MAX's larger CFM LEAP-1B engines are fitted further forward and higher up than in previous models. The aerodynamic effect of its nacelles contributes to the aircraft's tendency to pitch up at high angles of attack (AOA). The MCAS is intended to compensate in such cases, modeling the pitching behavior of previous models, and meet a certain certification requirement, in order to enhance handling characteristics and thus minimizing the need for significant pilot retraining. The software code for the MCAS function and the computer for executing the software are built to Boeing's specifications by Collins Aerospace, formerly Rockwell Collins. The trim wheel and cutoff switches in a previous generation cockpit As an automated corrective measure, the MCAS was given full authority to bring the aircraft nose down, and could not be overridden by pilot resistance against the control wheel as on previous versions of the 737. Following the Lion Air accident, Boeing issued an Operations Manual Bulletin (OMB) on November 6, 2019 to outline the many indications and effects resulting from erroneous AOA data and provided instructions to turn off the motorized trim system for the remainder of the flight, and trim manually instead. Until Boeing supplemented the manuals and training, pilots were unaware of the existence of MCAS due to its omission from the crew manual and no coverage in training. Boeing first publicly named and revealed the existence of MCAS on the 737 MAX in a message to airline operators and other aviation interests on November 10, 2018, twelve days after the Lion Air crash.  Safety engineering and human factors  As with any other equipment on board an aircraft, the FAA approves a functional \\"design assurance level\\" corresponding to the consequences of a failure, using the SAE International standards ARP4754 and ARP4761. MCAS was designated a \\"hazardous failure\\" system. This classification corresponds to failures causing \\"a large reduction in safety margins\\" or \\"serious or fatal injury to a relatively small number of the occupants\\", but nothing \\"catastrophic\\". The MCAS was designed with the assumption, approved by FAA, that pilots would react to an unexpected activation within three seconds.  MCAS technology readiness  The MCAS design parameters originally envisioned automated corrective actions to be taken in cases of high AoA and G-forces beyond normal flight conditions. Test pilots routinely push aircraft to such extremes, as the FAA requires airplanes to perform as expected. Before the MCAS, test pilot Ray Craig determined the plane did not fly smoothly, in part due to the larger engines. Craig would have preferred an aerodynamic solution, but Boeing decided to implement a control law in software. According to a news report from the Wall Street Journal, engineers who had worked on the KC-46A Pegasus tanker, which includes an MCAS function, suggested MCAS to the design team. With the MCAS implemented, new test pilot Ed Wilson said the \\"MAX wasn‚Äôt handling well when nearing stalls at low speeds‚Äù and recommended MCAS to apply across a broader range of flight conditions. This required the MCAS to function under normal G-forces and, at stalling speeds, deflect the vertical trim more rapidly and to a greater extent‚Äîbut now it reads a single AoA sensor, creating a single point of failure that allowed false data to trigger MCAS to pitch the nose downward and force the aircraft into a dive. \\"Inadvertently, the door was now opened to serious system misbehavior during the busy and stressful moments right after takeoff\\", said Jenkins of The Wall Street Journal. The FAA did not conduct a safety analysis on the changes. It had already approved the previous version of MCAS, and the agency's rules did not require it to take a second look because the changes did not affect how the plane operated in extreme situations. The Joint Authorities Technical Review found the technology unprecedented: \\"If the FAA technical staff had been fully aware of the details of the MCAS function, the JATR team believes the agency likely would have required an issue paper for using the stabilizer in a way that it had not previously been used. MCAS used the stabilizer to change the column force feel, not trim the aircraft. This is a case of using the control surface in a new way that the regulations never accounted for and should have required an issue paper for further analysis by the FAA. If an issue paper had been required, the JATR team believes it likely would have identified the potential for the stabilizer to overpower the elevator.\\" In November 2019, Jim Marko, a manager of aircraft integration and safety assessment at Transport Canada aviation regulator's National Aircraft Certification Branch questioned the readiness of MCAS. Because new problems kept emerging, he suggested to his peers at FAA, ANAC and EASA to consider the safety benefits of removing MCAS from the MAX.  Scrutiny  Altitude and speed of Lion Air Flight 610 The MCAS has been under scrutiny following the fatal crashes of Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 soon after takeoff. The Boeing 737 MAX global fleet has been grounded by all airlines and operators, and a number of functional issues have been raised. The MCAS deflects the horizontal stabilizer four times farther than was stated in the initial safety analysis document. Due to the amount of trim the system applies to the horizontal stabilizer, aerodynamic forces resist pilot control effort to raise the nose. As long as the faulty AOA readings persist, a human pilot \\"can quickly become exhausted trying to pull the column back\\". In addition, switches for the horizontal stabilizer trim assist now serve a shared purpose of turning off the MCAS. In simulator sessions, pilots were stunned by the substantial effort needed to manually crank the trim wheel out of its nose down setting. Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg has stated that there was \\"no surprise, or gap, or unknown here or something that somehow slipped through a certification process.\\" On April 29, 2019 he stated the design of the aircraft was not flawed and reiterated that it was designed per Boeing's standards. In a May 29 interview with CBS, Boeing admitted that it had botched the software implementation and lamented the poor communications. On September 26, the National Transportation Safety Board criticized Boeing‚Äôs inadequate testing of the 737 MAX, and pointed out that Boeing made erroneous assumptions on pilots‚Äô response to alerts in 737 MAX, triggered by activation of MCAS due to a faulty signal from an angle-of-attack sensor. The Joint Authorities Technical Review (JATR), a team commissioned by the FAA for 737 MAX investigation, concluded that FAA failed to properly review MCAS. Boeing failed to provide adequate and updated technical information regarding the MCAS system to FAA during Boeing 737 Max certification process, and had not carried out a thorough verification by stress-testing of the MCAS system. On October 18, Boeing turned over a discussion from 2016 between two employees which revealed prior issues with the MCAS system. Boeing's own internal design guidelines related to the 737 MAX's development stated that the system should \\"not have any objectionable interaction with the piloting of the airplane\\" and \\"not interfere with dive recovery\\". The operation of MCAS violated those.  NTSB  On September 26, 2019, the NTSB released the results of its review of potential lapses in the design and approval of the 737 MAX. The NTSB report concludes that assumptions \\"that Boeing used in its functional hazard assessment of uncommanded MCAS function for the 737 MAX did not adequately consider and account for the impact that multiple flight deck alerts and indications could have on pilots' responses to the hazard\\". When Boeing induced a stabilizer trim input that simulated the stabilizer moving consistent with the MCAS function, \\"... the specific failure modes that could lead to unintended MCAS activation (such as an erroneous high AOA input to the MCAS) were not simulated as part of these functional hazard assessment validation tests. As a result, additional flight deck effects (such as IAS DISAGREE and ALT DISAGREE alerts and stick shaker activation) resulting from the same underlying failure (for example, erroneous AOA) were not simulated and were not in the stabilizer trim safety assessment report reviewed by the NTSB.\\" The NTSB questioned the long-held industry and FAA practice of assuming the nearly instantaneous responses of highly trained test pilots as opposed to pilots of all levels of experience to verify human factors in aircraft safety. The NTSB expressed concerns that the process used to evaluate the original design needs improvement because that process is still in use to certify current and future aircraft and system designs. The FAA could for example randomly sample pools from the worldwide pilot community to get a more representative assessment of cockpit situations.  Supporting systems The updates proposed by Boeing focus mostly on MCAS software. In particular, there have been no public statements regarding reverting the functionality of the stabilizer trim cutout switches to pre-MAX configuration. A veteran software engineer and experienced pilot suggested that software changes may not be enough to counter the 737 MAX's engine placement. Seattle Times notes that while the new software fix Boeing has proposed \\"will likely prevent this situation recurring, if the preliminary investigation confirms that the Ethiopian pilots did cut off the automatic flight-control system, this is still a nightmarish outcome for Boeing and the FAA. It would suggest the emergency procedure laid out by Boeing and passed along by the FAA after the Lion Air crash is wholly inadequate and failed the Ethiopian flight crew.\\" Boeing and the FAA decided that the AoA display and an AoA disagree light, which signals if the sensors give different readings, were not critical features for safe operation. Boeing charged extra for the addition of the AoA indicator to the primary display. In November 2017, Boeing engineers discovered that the standard AoA disagree light cannot independently function without the optional AoA indicator software, a problem affecting 80% of the global fleet which had not ordered the option. The software remedy was scheduled to coincide with the roll out of the elongated 737 MAX 10 in 2020, only to be accelerated by the Lion Air accident. Furthermore, the problem had not been disclosed to the FAA until 13 months after the fact. Although it is unclear whether the indicator could have changed the outcome for the ill-fated flights, American Airlines said the disagree indicator provided the assurance in continued operations of the airplane. \\"As it turned out, that wasn't true.\\"  Runaway stabilizer and manual trim  In February 2016, the EASA certified the MAX with the expectation that pilot procedures and training would clearly explain unusual situations in which the seldom used manual trim wheel would be required to trim the plane, i.e. adjust the angle of the nose; however, the original flight manual did not mention those situations. The EASA certification document referred to simulations whereby the electric thumb switches were ineffective to properly trim the MAX under certain conditions. The EASA document said that after flight testing, because the thumb switches could not always control trim on their own, the FAA was concerned by whether the 737 MAX system complied with regulations. The American Airlines flight manual contains a similar notice regarding the thumb switches but does not specify conditions where the manual wheel may be needed. Boeing's CEO Muilenburg, when asked about the non-disclosure of MCAS, cited the \\"runaway stabilizer trim\\" procedure as part of the training manual. He added that Boeing's bulletin pointed to that existing flight procedure. Boeing views the \\"runaway stabilizer trim\\" checklist as a memory item for pilots. Mike Sinnett, vice president and general manager for the Boeing New Mid-Market Airplane (NMA) since July 2019, repeatedly described the procedure as a \\"memory item\\". However, some airlines view it as an item for the quick reference card. The FAA issued a recommendation about memory items in an Advisory Circular, Standard Operating Procedures and Pilot Monitoring Duties for Flight Deck Crewmembers: \\"Memory items should be avoided whenever possible. If the procedure must include memory items, they should be clearly identified, emphasized in training, less than three items, and should not contain conditional decision steps.\\" In November 2018, Boeing told airlines that MCAS could not be overcome by pulling back on the control column to stop a runaway trim as on previous generation 737s. Nevertheless, confusion continued: the safety committee of a major U.S. airline misled its pilots by telling that the MCAS could be overcome by \\"applying opposite control-column input to activate the column cutout switches\\". Former pilot and CBS aviation & safety expert Chesley Sullenberger testified, \\"The logic was that when MCAS was activated, it had to be, and must not be prevented.\\" In October, Sullenberger wrote, \\"These emergencies did not present as a classic runaway stabilizer problem, but initially as ambiguous unreliable airspeed and altitude situations, masking MCAS.\\" In a legal complaint against Boeing, the Southwest Airlines Pilot Association states: > An MCAS failure is not like a runaway stabilizer. A runaway stabilizer has > continuous un-commanded movement of the tail, whereas MCAS is not continuous > and pilots (theoretically) can counter the nose-down movement, after which > MCAS would move the aircraft tail down again. Moreover, unlike runaway > stabilizer, MCAS disables the control column response that 737 pilots have > grown accustomed to and relied upon in earlier generations of 737 aircraft. In May 2019, The Seattle Times reported that the two stabilizer cutoff switches on the MAX operate differently than on the earlier 737 NG. On previous aircraft, one cutoff switch deactivates the thumb buttons on the control yoke that pilots use to move the horizontal stabilizer; the other cutoff switch disables automatic control (as from autopilot) to move the stabilizer in the tail. On the MAX, both switches do the same thing: they cut off all electric power to the stabilizer, both from the yoke buttons and from an automatic system, like MCAS. With all power to the stabilizer cut, pilots have no choice but to use the mechanical trim wheel in the center console. However, as pilots pull on the 737 controls to raise the nose of the aircraft, aerodynamic forces on the elevator create an opposing force, effectively paralyzing the jackscrew mechanism.> It becomes very difficult for pilots to hand crank the trim wheel. The problem was encountered on earlier 737 versions, and a \\"roller coaster\\" emergency technique for handling the flight condition was documented in 1982 for the 737-200 but did not appear in training documentation for later versions (including the MAX).  MCAS circumvention for ferry flights  During the groundings, special flights to reposition MAX aircraft to storage locations, as per 14 CFR ¬ß 21.197, flew at lower altitude and with flaps extended to circumvent MCAS activation, rather than using the recovery procedure after the fact. Such flights required a certain pilot qualification as well as permission from corresponding regulators, and with no other cabin crew or passengers.  Horizontal stabilizer actuator  The horizontal stabilizer is fitted with a conventional elevator for flight control. However it is itself all-moving about a single pivot and can be trimmed to adjust its angle. The trim is actuated via a jackscrew mechanism. Slippage concern Sylvain Alarie and Gilles Primeau, experts on the horizontal stabilizers, observed anomalies in the data from the aircraft data recorders: a progressive shift of 0.2 degrees of the horizontal stabilizer, before the crash. \\"It may not seem like much, but it is an order of magnitude higher than what is normally allowed when designing systems like these\\", says Gilles Primeau. They say that the movements are easily observable, and disallowed according to Regulation 395A. These anomalies raise fundamental questions about this jack screw, which controls the horizontal stabilizer since the beginning of the 737 models, first certified in 1967. These slips are particularly visible on flight ET302: \\"While there is no MCAS command, and no control of the pilots, we see a movement of the jack screw which controls the horizontal stabilizer, we see a slip. And at the very end of the flight, the jack screw starts to slide again with an increase in the speed of the plane and its dive,\\" says Alarie. Since its original design, the 737 has become 61% heavier, 24% longer, and 40% wider, and its engines twice as powerful. These experts are concerned that the loads on the jack screw have potentially increased since the creation of the 737. By regulations, the controls must be designed for 125% of the foreseeable loads. These experts have raised concerns about the motors possibly overheating in April 2019. Manual trim stiffness In the early 1980s a problem was found with the 737-200 model. When the elevator operated to raise or lower the nose, it set up a strong force on the trim jackscrew which opposed any corrective force from the control systems. When attempting to correct an unwanted deflection using the manual trim wheel, exerting enough hand force to overcome the force exerted by the elevator became increasingly difficult as speed and deflection increased and the jack screw effectively jammed in place.Jon Ostrower; \\"Vestigial design issue clouds 737 Max crash investigations\\", The Air Current, April 4, 2019. (retrieved November 21, 2019) A workaround was developed called the \\"roller coaster\\" technique. Counter- intuitively, to correct an excessive deflection causing a dive the pilot first pushes the nose down further, before easing back to gently raise the nose again. During this easing back period, the elevator deflection reduces or even reverses, its force on the jackscrew does likewise and the manual trim eases up. The workaround was included in the pilot's emergency procedures and in the training schedule. However while the 737 MAX has a similar jackscrew mechanism the \\"roller coaster\\" technique has been dropped from the pilot information. During the events leading to the two MAX crashes, the stiffness of the manual trim wheel repeatedly prevented manual trim adjustment to correct the MCAS- induced nose-down pitching. The issue has been brought to the notice of the DoJ criminal inquiry into the 737 MAX crashes. In simulator tests of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 flight scenario, the trim wheel was \\"impossible\\" to move when one of the pilots would instinctively pull up from the nosedives. It takes 15 turns to manually trim the aircraft one degree, and up to 40 turns to bring the trim back to neutral from the nose down position caused by MCAS.  Angle of Attack (AoA)  As per Boeing technical description: \\"the Angle of Attack (AoA) is an aerodynamic parameter that is key to understanding the limits of airplane performance. Recent accidents and incidents have resulted in new flight crew training programs, which in turn have raised interest in AoA in commercial aviation. Awareness of AOA is vitally important as the airplane nears stall.\\" Chesley Sullenberger said AoA indicators might have helped in these two crashes. \\"It is ironic that most modern aircraft measure (angle of attack) and that information is often used in many aircraft systems, but it is not displayed to pilots. Instead, pilots must infer (angle of attack) from other parameters, deducing it indirectly.\\"  AoA sensors  Though there are two sensors on the MAX only one of them is used at a time to trigger MCAS activation on the 737 MAX. Any fault in this sensor, perhaps due to physical damage, creates a single point failure: the flight control system lacks any basis for rejecting its input as faulty information. Reports of a single point of failure were not always acknowledged by Boeing. Addressing American Airlines pilots, Boeing vice-president Mike Sinnett contradicted reports that the MCAS had a single-point failure, because the pilots themselves are the backup. Reporter Useem said in The Atlantic it was \\"showing both a misunderstanding of the term and a sharp break from Boeing's long- standing practice of having multiple backups for every flight system\\". Problems with the AoA sensor had been reported in over 200 incident reports submitted to the FAA; however, Boeing did not flight test a scenario in which it malfunctioned. The sensors themselves are under scrutiny. Sensors on the Lion air aircraft were supplied by United Technologies' Rosemount Aerospace. In September 2019, the EASA said it prefers triple-redundant AoA sensors rather than the dual redundancy in Boeing's proposed upgrade to the MAX. Installation of a third sensor could be expensive and take a long time. The change, if mandated, could be extended to thousands of older model 737s in service around the world. A former professor at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Andrew Kornecki, who is an expert in redundancy systems, said operating with one or two sensors \\"would be fine if all the pilots were sufficiently trained in how to assess and handle the plane in the event of a problem\\". But, he would much prefer building the plane with three sensors, as Airbus does.  AoA Disagree alert  In November 2017, after several months of MAX deliveries, Boeing discovered that the AoA Disagree message, which is indicative of potential sensor mismatch on the primary flight display, was unintentionally disabled. Clint Balog, a professor at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, said after the Lion Air crash: \\"In retrospect, clearly it would have been wise to include the warning as standard equipment and fully inform and train operators on MCAS\\". According to Bjorn Fehrm, Aeronautical and Economic Analyst at Leeham News and Analysis, \\"A major contributor to the ultimate loss of JT610 is the missing AoA DISAGREE display on the pilots' displays.\\" The software depended on the presence of the visual indicator software, a paid option that was not selected by most airlines. For example, Air Canada, American Airlines and Westjet had purchased the disagree alert, while Air Canada and American Airlines also purchased, in addition, the AoA value indicator, and Lion Air had neither. Boeing had determined that the defect was not critical to aircraft safety or operation, and an internal safety review board (SRB) corroborated Boeing's prior assessment and its initial plan to update the aircraft in 2020. Boeing did not disclose the defect to the FAA until November 2018, in the wake of the Lion Air crash. Consequently, Southwest had announced to pilots that its entire fleet of MAX 8 aircraft will receive the optional upgrades. In March 2019, after the second accident of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, a Boeing representative told Inc. magazine, \\"Customers have been informed that AoA Disagree alert will become a standard feature on the 737 MAX. It can be retrofitted on previously delivered airplanes.\\" On May 5, 2019, The Wall Street Journal reported that Boeing had known of existing problems with the flight control system a year before the Lion Air accident. Boeing defended that \\"Neither the angle of attack indicator nor the AoA Disagree alert are necessary for the safe operation of the airplane.\\" Boeing recognized that the defective software was not implemented to their specifications as a \\"standard, standalone feature.\\" Boeing stated, \\"...MAX production aircraft will have an activated and operable AoA Disagree alert and an optional angle of attack indicator. All customers with previously delivered MAX airplanes will have the ability to activate the AoA Disagree alert.\\" Boeing CEO Muilenburg said the company's communication about the alert \\"was not consistent. And that's unacceptable.\\"  Visual AoA indicator  The primary flight display of a Boeing 737-800 aircraft with a functional angle of attack display on the upper right; the AoA Disagree alert would appear as a text message. Boeing published an article in Aero magazine about AoA systems, \\"Operational use of Angle of Attack on modern commercial jet planes\\": Boeing announced a change in policy in the Frequently Asked Questions in a (FAQ) about the MAX corrective work, \\"With the software update, customers are not charged for the AoA Disagree feature or their selection of the AoA indicator option.\\" In 1996, the NTSB issued Safety Recommendation A-96-094. > TO THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION (FAA): Require that all transport- > category aircraft present pilots with angle-of-attack info in a visual > format, and that all air carriers train their pilots to use the info to > obtain maximum possible airplane climb performance. The NTSB also stated about another accident in 1997, that \\"a display of angle of attack on the flight deck would have maintained the flightcrew's awareness of the stall condition and it would have provided direct indication of the pitch attitudes required for recovery throughout the attempted stall recovery sequence.\\" The NTSB also believed that the accident may have been prevented if a direct indication of AoA was presented to the flightcrew (NTSB, 1997).\\"  Flight computer architecture  In early April 2019, Boeing reported a problem with software affecting flaps and other flight-control hardware, unrelated to MCAS; classified as critical to flight safety, the FAA has ordered Boeing to fix the problem correspondingly. In October 2019, the EASA has suggested to conduct more testing on proposed revisions to flight-control computers due to its concerns about portions of proposed fixes to MCAS. The necessary changes to improve redundancy between the two flight control computers have proved more complex and time-consuming than the fixes for the original MCAS issue, delaying any re-introduction to service beyond the date originally envisaged. In January 2020, new software issues were discovered, affecting monitoring of the flight computer start-up process and verifying readiness for flight. In April 2020, Boeing identified new risks where the trim system might unintentionally command nose down during flight or prematurely disconnect the autopilot.  Microprocessor stress testing  The MAX systems are integrated in the \\"e-cab\\" test flight deck, a simulator built for developing the MAX. In June 2019, \\"in a special Boeing simulator that is designed for engineering reviews,\\" FAA pilots performed a stress testing scenarioan abnormal condition identified through FMEA after the MCAS update was implementedfor evaluating the effect of a fault in a microprocessor: as expected from the scenario, the horizontal stabilizer pointed the nose downward. Although the test pilot ultimately recovered control, the system was slow to respond to the proper runaway stabilizer checklist steps. Boeing initially classified this as a \\"major\\" hazard, and the FAA upgraded it to a much more severe \\"catastrophic\\" rating. Boeing stated that the issue can be fixed in software. The software change will not be ready for evaluation until at least September 2019. EASA director Patrick Ky said that retrofitting additional hardware is an option to be considered. The test scenario simulated an event toggling five bits in the flight control computer. The bits represent status flags such as whether MCAS is active, or whether the tail trim motor is energized. Engineers were able to simulate single event upsets and artificially induce MCAS activation by manipulating these signals. Such a fault occurs when memory bits change from 0 to 1 or vice versa, which is something that can be caused by cosmic rays striking the microprocessor. The failure scenario was known before the MAX entered service in 2017: it had been assessed in a safety analysis when the plane was certified. Boeing had concluded that pilots could perform a procedure to shut off the motor driving the stabilizer to overcome the nose-down movement. The scenario also affects 737NG aircraft, though it presents less risk than on the MAX. On the NG, moving the yoke counters any uncommanded stabilizer input, but this function is bypassed on the MAX to avoid negating the purpose of MCAS. Boeing also said that it agreed with additional requirements that the FAA required it to fulfill, and added that it was working toward resolving the safety risk. It will not offer the MAX for certification until all requirements have been satisfied. Early news reports were inaccurate in attributing the problem to an 80286 microprocessor overwhelmed with data, though as of April 2020 the concern remains that the MCAS software is overloading the 737 MAX's computers.  Computer redundancy  , the two flight control computers of Boeing 737 never cross-checked each other's operations; i.e., each was a single non- redundant channel. This lack of robustness existed since the early implementation and persisted for decades. The updated flight control system will use both flight control computers and compare their outputs. This switch to a fail-safe two-channel redundant system, with each computer using an independent set of sensors, is a radical change from the architecture used on 737s since the introduction on the older model 737‚Äì300 in the 1980s. Up to the MAX in its prior-to-grounding-version, the system alternates between computers after each flight. The two computers' architecture allowed switching in-flight if the operating computer failed, thus increasing availability. In the revised architecture, Boeing required the two computers to monitor each other so that each one can vet the other.  Trim system malfunction indicator  In January 2020, during flight testing, Boeing discovered a problem with an indicator light; the defect was traced to the \\"redesign of the two flight computers that control the 737 MAX to make them more resilient to failure\\". The indicator, which signals a problem with the trim system, can remain on longer than intended by design.

The other to are Gatuna/Katuna and Kagitumba/Mirama Hills. In February 2019, Rwanda closed its borders to Ugandans and Ugandan goods, including at the Chanika/Kyanika border crossing. As a result, the annual trade worth approximately US$180 million to Uganda and about US$10 million to Rwanda came to a halt. As of February 2020, attempts by the presidents of Angola, Jo√£o Louren√ßo and of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, F√©lix Tshisekedi, have not yet resolved the impasse. Points of interest The border crossing is in close proximity to Volcanoes National Park in Rwanda, Mgahinga Gorilla National Park in Uganda, and Virunga National Park, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

In 1978 Mr. and Mrs. Charles Wrightsman gave it to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, where it still hangs. The painting depicts Mary Magdalene, a companion of Christ, who exchanged her previous lifestyle for a life of penance and contemplation. She is shown, illuminated by a candle, sitting in a meditative pose in front of a mirror. The light from the candle and its reflection create a strong chiaroscuro effect, with the subject's brightly lit face and breast contrasting with the darkness of the rest of the composition. Both the candle and the human skull she is holding are metaphors for the fragility of life and her discarded jewellery for the meaningless value of worldly possessions and for her atonement. The work is one of several by the artist featuring a candlelit Mary Magdalene.

He was later imprisoned by his erstwhile ally and kinsman, Caliph Marwan II in 745 and presumably died in incarceration. Life Bishr was a son of the Umayyad caliph al-Walid I (r. 705‚Äì715).Vaglieri 1960, p. 1244. During his father's reign, he led a number of military campaigns against the Byzantine Empire along the caliphate's northern frontier, including in 710/11 and the winter of 714/715. Also in 714, he was appointed amir al-hajj by his father, putting him in charge of leading the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca that year. Due to his high education, he was dubbed  øalim Ban≈´ MarwƒÅn (scholar of the Marwanids), i.e. the ruling house of the Umayyad dynasty.Hinds 1990, p. 217. Bishr returned to Syria after his father's death in early 715, according to 8th/9th-century historian al-Waqidi.Hinds 1990, p. 218. Bishr is not mentioned again in the medieval sources until 743/44 when he became involved in the internecine struggle over the caliphate between the Umayyad dynasty. To that end, he fought against his cousin Caliph al-Walid II in support of his brother, Yazid III, despite warnings from his other brother and prominent wartime general, al-Abbas, to remain neutral. An account by Bishr's unnamed son of Bishr's disagreement with al-Abbas was recorded in the history of 9th-century historian al-Tabari.Hillenbrand 1989, p. 141. Twelve other brothers of Bishr likewise supported Yazid III, who went on to become caliph after al-Walid II's assassination in 744. Yazid III ruled for a few months before dying and being succeeded by his brother Ibrahim, who months later, in 745, surrendered the caliphate to Marwan II. At the time of the latter's accession, Bishr had been serving as governor of Jund Qinnasrin (military district of Qinnasrin) in northern Syria. Marwan II subsequently compelled the largely Qaysi troops of Qinnasrin to arrest and hand over Bishr and the latter's full brother Masrur who became captives. They are not heard of again and are assumed to have died in prison.

With the formula Mg(C14H10)(thf)3, this air- and water-sensitive orange solid is obtained by heating a suspension of magnesium in a thf solution of anthracene. Structure and reactivity According to X-ray crystallography, the Mg center is 5-coordinate, occupying a C2O3 ligand sphere. The fold angle between the two benzo groups is 72.6¬∞. The compound behaves as a source of the carbanion [C14H10]2- as well as a source of highly reactive Mg. With electrophiles, the compound reacts to give dihydroanthracene derivatives C14H10E2. Electrophiles include ketones, CO2, organotin chlorides, and organoaluminium chlorides. Ethylene inserts into one Mg-C bond. Hydrogen induces release of anthracene, yielding magnesium hydride (MgH2).

Roberts was the third woman to receive an advanced degree in physics from the University of Michigan. Roberts is recognized as one of the \\"Glass Heroes\\" of Corning Glass for the research she conducted with the company as a post-graduate student, prior to receiving her master's degree in physics.  Life and education  Roberts received a B.A. in mathematics and minor in history from the University of Michigan (1915). During college, Roberts also taught high school classes and began a research position at Corning Glass Works. After Corning, Roberts returned to the University of Michigan to further her studies in physics and received her M.S. in 1921. Not only was it rare to be a woman studying physics at the time, but Roberts was also accomplished in her studies. She was the recipient of a University Scholarship ($300) for the 1920-1921 academic year, and the only student with a physics affiliation to receive that fellowship that year. She would go on to receive her master's degree in physics in 1921 and was a member of the Sigma Xi Honor Society.  Research, career, and publications  Roberts held a position as a research physicist at Corning (1917-1920). Upon her appointment in 1917, Roberts would become one of the first female research scientists at Corning Glass. During her time with the company, Roberts ran experiments on conductivity, expansion, viscosity, and thermal shock of glass. She specifically worked on research questions relevant to the development of Pyrex and was a collaborator of John T. Littleton. Her first author publication with Littleton is linked below: * Roberts would go on to hold a varied career after Corning including research positions in several other major industries including: the Engineering- Technical Laboratories of Sears, Roebuck & Co and also as a research specialist in Home Economics at the Washington Agricultural Experiment Station. With the Washington Agricultural Experiment Station (based at Washington State College), Roberts wrote articles and reports on a series of topics including: * \\"The Bactericidal Effectiveness of Home Laundering Methods for Silk and Rayon\\" * \\"The present use of work time of farm homemakers\\" *\\"Vacuum Cleaning\\" *\\"Suitability of vacuum cleaner types for various rugs and carpets\\" While this work is distant from her post-graduate research at Corning glass, it is not surprising that this was an accessible research field for female scientists at the time. In addition, Roberts prior research experience was on Pyrex, a commercial brand heavily marketed for the home and for homemakers during the 1920s which was when Roberts was a recent graduate of the University of Michigan seeking employment. During Robert's time at the Washington Agricultural Experiment Station, her research department was distinguished by being composed solely of women who all held at least one advanced degree and several women in the division also held joint faculty appointments.

In his political life he was member of the Departmental council, socialist mayor of Toulouse where he initiated several reforms and improvements to the city. He later became senator for Haute-Garonne in the Third French Republic. Life Born in Toulouse on 31 August 1845, Camille Ournac, became a wholesale wine merchant, a miller and then Conseil g√©n√©ral of French Departments, Ournac was the first of a succession of radical socialist mayors of Toulouse who founded the labor exchange and set up the first horse-drawn streetcars in the city. His tenure was from 20 May 1888 until October 1892. Like his brother Henry, Ournac was a cartoonist, signing his works \\"Ka-Mill\\". He was made a knight of the Legion d'honneur in 1889. Ournac's son, Jean, died in Royan age thirty-six on 15 December 1911 while his father, Camille, was 79 years of age when he died on 24 January 1925 in Toulouse. Mayor of Toulouse Elected on the list of radical and socialist republican union sponsored by La D√©p√™che du Midi, against the republican list where Josef Sirven appeared. He was elected on 15 May 1892, but on 6 October Ournac resigned with his deputies, Honor√© Serres and Jean Jaur√®s. He was re-elected on the 9th and resigned a second time. By a municipal decree of 14 April 1891, under the direction of mayor Ournac Mus√©e Saint-Raymond became a \\"museum of ancient and exotic decorative arts\\" in Toulouse and was inaugurated by him on 24 April 1892. In 1892, Ournac decided to create the Salle des Illustres, a large gallery of works by Toulouse artists in the Capitole de Toulouse, now used as a reception hall. The state, which was responsible for half of the renovation costs, and the city, contested the list of artists who would participate in the work. The city's choice to use only artists of the school of Toulouse prevailed when this was decided on 20 January 1892. Artists whose work decorates the hall are Jean- Paul Laurens, Jean-Joseph Benjamin-Constant, Jean-Andr√© Rixens, Paul Gervais, √âdouard Debat-Ponsan, Henri Rachou Paul Pujol and Henri-Jean Guillaume Martin.

Roucolle uses the images of Ournac, along with Paul Feuga and Ournac's mayoral successor Honor√© Serres, as attending figures, because of their involvement in deciding to create the Salle des Illustres using local artist's works. Also in July 1892, Ournac inaugurated the new Bourse du Travail in Place Saint-Sernin. Senator He was first elected as senator for Haute-Garonne in the Third Republic on 3 January 1897, and re-elected in the 1906 election, but in 1920 lost his seat. Ournac joined the French Democratic Left party and intervened on budgetary issues related to agriculture and was also a member of committees on finance, railways, initiative, local interest, and the economic organization of the nation in time of war. On 15 October 1915, Ournac introduced a motion protesting the German execution of Edith Cavell. It passed unanimously in the Senate.

At first, he pursued a career in law, graduating from the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru in 1994. After working one-year as a lawyer, he decided to pursue a career in acting. Enrolled in Alberto √çsola's workshop, he starred in a variety of national classical theatre productions. Subsequently, he starred in three television series' directed by Luis Llosa. He gained international fame in 2000 for his portrayal of \\"Captain Pantale√≥n Pantoja\\" in Captain Pantoja and the Special Services film adaptation of Mario Vargas Llosa's classical novel, directed by Francisco J. Lombardi. The film was selected as Peru's 72nd Academy Awards Best Foreign Language Film Award submission, but was not nominated. Del Solar took a brief hiatus of acting as he travelled to New York to pursue a master's degree in international relations at Syracuse University. Upon finishing his graduate studies, he acted in a variety of television productions, and ultimately relocated to Colombia and Mexico. Among other works, he starred in The Missing Elephant in 2013, and debuted as film director with Magallanes in 2014. After years dedicated to cultural promotion in his country, President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski appointed him Minister of Culture in a cabinet reshuffle on December 5, 2016, switching the previous Minister of Culture to Defense. In his one-year tenure as minister, he took a prominent role in promoting Peruvian cinema, and relaunching renowned museums throughout the country. He tendered his resignation on December 27, 2017, alongside other cabinet ministers in protest of president Kuczynski's pardon of former President Alberto Fujimori. Upon C√©sar Villanueva's resignation as Prime Minister of Peru, Del Solar was appointed by president Mart√≠n Vizcarra as Villanueva's successor, on March 11, 2019. As tension arose between the executive branch and the fujimorist dominated Peruvian Congress in the months of his premiership, Del Solar and Vizcarra worked towards finding a solution to the ongoing political crisis. The situation escalated when Congress convened a new election of the Constitutional Court magistrates, prompting Del Solar to appear before Congress asking for a vote of confidence in order to modify the magistrate's election rules for institutional preservation. The majority of Congress ignored his presentation, and proceeded to elect the new magistrates. President Vizcarra interpreted the election as factual denial of confidence, ultimately dissolving Congress by constitutional decree on September 30, 2019. Due to the denial of confidence against the cabinet, Del Solar tendered his resignation on the same day. He was succeeded by Vicente Zeballos.https://www.americaeconomia.com/politica- sociedad/politica/presidente-de-peru-martin-vizcarra-disuelve-el-congreso-y- convoca-nuevashttps://amp.dw.com/es/vizcarra-disuelve-el-congreso-de-per√∫-y- convoca-elecciones/a-50651308https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/video/martin-vizcarra- disuelve-congreso-peru-brk/amp/ Del Solar is the first Peruvian politician to be heavily involved in the film industry and acting as a career.

Del Solar was appointed Minister of Culture by president Pedro Pablo Kuczynski in a cabinet reshuffle, as the previous holder was switched to the Ministry of Defense, on December 5, 2016. Del Solar's appointment was viewed by pundits as a populist move by Kuczynski, amid the starting confrontation between the executive branch and the opposition-dominated Peruvian Congress led by Popular Force. During his tenure as minister, Del Solar promoted the ministerial initiative for the new Cinema Law, which sought to increase the subsidy to Peruvian cinematographic works, including up to 30% of the project's investment.https://elcomercio.pe/economia/peru/solar-nueva-ley-cine- beneficiara-audiovisual-cine-noticia-459556 Del Solar also participated in a project for the relaunching of the Museum of the Nation, and the construction of the National Museum of Lur√≠n.https://diariocorreo.pe/cultura/salvador-del- solar-anuncia-relanzamiento-del-museo-de-la- nacion-750691/?outputType=amphttps://diariocorreo.pe/cultura/obras-de- salvador-del-solar-ministro-de-cultura-794067/?outputType=amp Amidst the political turmoil regarding Alberto Fujimori's pardon granted by president Kuczynski's on December 24, 2017, Del Solar tendered his resignation as Minister of Culture on December 27, alongside other cabinet ministers. His resignation was accepted on January 9, 2018, as Kuczynski appointed the former director of the National Library of Peru, Alejandro Neyra, as Del Solar's successor.

On March 11, 2019, Del Solar was appointed President of the Council of Ministers of Peru by president Mart√≠n Vizcarra, succeeding C√©sar Villanueva, who resigned three days before. Two weeks later, Del Solar met with President of Congress Daniel Salaverry, to announce his prompt visit to Congress and request the vote of confidence (known as investiture vote).https://elcomercio.pe/politica/salvador-solar-pedira-voto-investidura- congreso-republica-4-abril-noticia-nndc-620222-noticia/%3foutputType=amp On April 4, he appeared before Congress to expose, according to law, the general policy of the government and the measures that his management as head of the Cabinet would take.https://andina.pe/agencia/noticia-salvador-del-solar- expone-politica-general-del-gobierno-ante-congreso-747527.aspx Del Solar began his exposition analyzing the national situation and the discontent of the population with political parties and institutions.

Although the arrest, internment and/or deportation of belligerent country nationals was common practice in both Axis and Allied countries (and their colonies) during both World War I and World War II, subsequent US Congressional investigations and reparations during the 1980s and 1990s, especially for Japanese Americans interned, have raised awareness of the injustice of such practices. Unlike Allied civilians held in Nazi concentration camps or those interned by the Japanese, Axis nationals interned in Allied countries did not suffer from systematic starvation and widespread mistreatment by their captors. Although conducted ostensibly to curb Axis subterfuge, like the Internment of Japanese Canadians, the Internment of Japanese Americans, and the Internment of German Americans, many of the deportees were not supporters of the Nazi regime. Persons deported even included Jewish refugees who had fled Nazi Germany prior to the German declaration of war against the United States. Of the 4,656 deportees sent to the US in 1942, 2,242 were exchanged with Axis powers for citizens of Allied countries arrested and interned by the Axis powers and 2,414 remained in the US until the end of the war. The deportation of Germans was preceded by the immigration of tens of thousands of German immigrants to Latin America during the 19th and early 20th centuries. While the vast majority of these immigrants integrated into Latin American societies, some still held German citizenship at the time of Germany's declaration of war in 1941. Prior to World War II both the German and U.S. governments were actively competing for political and economic influence across Latin America and with the outbreak of war the U.S. government was fearful that nationals of the belligerent countries could pose a threat. Subsequently several thousand German, Japanese and Italian nationals were arrested by Latin American governments and many were deported to internment camps in the U.S. for the duration of the conflict. A minority were even deported to Nazi Germany. Following the war most were repatriated to their home countries.  Background   German Influence in Latin America  Germany's involvement in the region had existed since the 19th century. Waves of German immigrants had been generally welcomed into the region, partially as a result of the popularity of racist ideologies among Latin America's political and economic elites who often believed in the myth of the Protestant work ethic and the superiority of Northern European Protestants immigrants over Southern European Catholics. The Nazi German Government primarily viewed Latin America as a source of raw materials and attempted to deepen commercial relations with the region during the inter-war period.Vampire diplomacy: Nazi economic Nationalism in Latin America, 1934‚Äì40, Salvatore Prisco, Diplomacy & Statecraft, Vol. 2, 1991 Germany offered military training and sold weapons to several Latin American governments and several Latin American governments in an attempt to undermine U.S. influence in the region. During the 1930s sympathetic far-right and fascist political movements, most notably Brazil's Integralism movement and Argentina's Nacionalismo movement attempted to gain control in their respective states. Following World War II thousands of Nazis would escape to Latin America and avoid capture by the Allies thanks to Nazi sympathizers in Latin America, some of whom held military and political positions in Latin America's governments.  American influence in Latin America  Since the establishment of the Monroe Doctrine the United States Government sought and gained an influential position in the Western Hemisphere. During the 1930s, the American intervention in region, which began in 1898 (see the Spanish American War and the banana wars) on behalf of local elites and U.S. corporations, was replaced by the Good Neighbor policy which was made official at the Montevideo Convention in 1933. American influence in the region remained significant during the pre-war period and included the U.S. control over the recently built Panama Canal.  U.S. - Germany Relations in Latin America immediately prior to 1941  By 1941, the US was supplying war materials to democracies fighting against the Axis powers under the Lend-Lease Act of 1941. The US Navy also assisted the Royal Navy against German submarines in the Atlantic and hostility against Germany spilled over to ethnic Germans in the United States and in Latin America. Ethnic Germans in Latin America were placed under surveillance at the behest of the US. Ethnic Germans in Latin America deemed ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù were placed on the Proclaimed List of Certain Blocked Nationals. Created in June 1941 by the US, those of the list were subjected to economic sanction and were blocked from doing businesses with American companies.  Rationale for deportation   Inadequate American intelligence  American intelligence on Latin America was very poor and inaccurate, thus overstating the threat of ethnic Germans in Latin America, motivating the deportation and internment. Pre-war American intelligence gathering in Latin America was dependent on embassy cables, reports by G-2 (Army intelligence), ONI (Naval Intelligence), and civilian volunteers. Latin America was shunned by talented officers as backwater and ‚Äúprejudicial to their promotions‚Äù, therefore, intelligence staff posted Latin America were often from the bottom of the barrel. For example, Colonel Carl Strong, the military attach√© in Bogota, warned of a German attack on Colombia ‚Äúvia Dakar and Nepal,‚Äù demonstrating his ignorance of Latin American geography. Intelligence work in Latin America became a priority as Nazi Germany advanced across Western Europe. In June 1940, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was charged with monitoring Latin America by President Franklin Roosevelt. The ~700 FBI agents poured into Latin America were not much more competent. Agent Donald Charles Bird of the FBI was given two weeks of Spanish lessons before being sent to Brazil, a Portuguese speaking country. These intelligence officers often overstated the level of German influence in Latin America and grossly exaggerated the threat of ethnic Germans as a potential fifth column. One such example was the FBI‚Äôs portrayal of the 12,000 ethnic Germans in Bolivia as an imminent threat, ignoring the fact that 8,500 of them were Jews escaping from German-occupied Europe.  British disinformation  To further skew American assessment of the situation in Latin America, British Security Co-ordination (BSC), an arm of the British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), fabricated many ‚Äúevidences‚Äù of Nazi aggressions and infiltrations in Latin America to induce the US to join the war. These hoaxes and fabrications were in many cases readily accepted by American intelligence as truth. For example, in June 1940, the BSC forged a letter to implicate Major Elias Belmonte, former Bolivian military attach√© to Berlin, in a German-sponsored coup plot in Bolivia. The letter and the alleged coup attempt became proof for German subversion in Latin America and was circulated by the FBI. On 27 October 1941, President Roosevelt dramatically announced, \\"I have in my possession a secret map, made in Germany by Hitler's government - by planners of the new world order. [...] It is a map of South America and a part of Central America as Hitler proposes to reorganize it.\\" This map, printed in German, indicates plans to conquer South America and partition it into five satellite states. This map was also a fabrication by the BSC.  Overstated threat  The combination of inadequate American intelligence and abundant British disinformation convinced American policy- makers that the ethnic German population in Latin American constituted a threat to Latin America, and consequently, the United States. Lieutenant Jules Dubois, chief of the Intelligence Branch of the US Army in Panama declared, ‚ÄúWith their sights trained on Latin America, the Axis Powers began to groom puppets and sympathetic groups in every republic to seize the reigns [sic] of their governments‚Äô machinery [‚Ä¶] There were approximately three million Axis nationals residing in Latin American then, each of whom could have been made available to form part of a militant striking force capable of implementing the plans of the Axis at the appropriate time‚Äù After the US entered the war, neutralizing the perceived threat against Latin America and securing the strategically important Panama Canal was seen by the US government as vital.  Deportation   U.S. Government requests the arrest and deportation of ‚Äúall dangerous aliens‚Äù  The United States elected to use internment and deportation to neutralise the perceived threat posed by ethnic Germans following American entry into war. Because of the perceived incompetence and possible German infiltration of Latin American governments, local internment was deemed insufficient as a solution. Immediately after the attack on Pearl Harbor the Government of Panama carried out arrests of Japanese, German, and Italian nationals. Following the arrests the US Ambassador in Panama requested that the Panamanian government send the internees to the U.S., citing the logistical difficulties of housing and feeding the internees in Panama. On 20 January 1942, the US State Department instructed its embassies in Cuba, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Honduras, El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti to obtain an agreement to send ‚Äúall dangerous aliens‚Äù to the US for internment. In neutral Colombia, US Ambassador Braden urged for the expulsion of Germans even before US entry to the war.  Latin American response to U.S. demand  The Latin American countries were generally receptive to American demands. Their motivation varied between American influence, promise of military and economic aid, domestic anti-German sentiments, and the opportunity to seize the land and property of the Germans. Panama, which was tightly controlled by the US, agreed to send the ‚Äúmore dangerous‚Äù internees to the US on 13 January 1942. Little opposition arose in the Latin American countries that have declared war on Germany. Guatemala, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Honduras, El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti all agreed to deport ‚Äúdangerous enemy aliens‚Äù by mid-February 1942, while Cuba compromised with interning selected Germans in the isolated Isle of Pines (now Isla de la Juventud). Colombia initially refused American demands, citing national sovereignty and constitutional rights. She relented in November 1943 after she was promised military aid under Lend-Lease from the US. Together with Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia, they agreed to send selected Germans to the US under the promise that the deportees will be repatriated to Germany rather than interned in the US.  Selection of deportees  The selection of deportees was arbitrary and inaccurate in picking out potentially dangerous Germans. The selection was conducted by both by local governments and by American instructions. In total, 4,058 Germans were deported to the US. The Proclaimed List of Certain Blocked Nationals was used as the basis for deportation in many Latin American countries. Many more ethnic Germans in Latin American were also selected for deportation. Outspoken Nazi Party members, such as Otto Krogmann, leader of the Nazi Party in Costa Rica and brother of Carl Vincent Krogmann, Nazi politician and mayor of Hamburg, were quickly arrested and deported. German American internment sites during World War II However, many other ethnic Germans were also detained and deported with scant evidence. Carl Specht, a labour organiser for Indian rubber trappers in Colombia was deported without evidence. Post-war investigators noted that he ‚Äúincurred the enmity of some of the American rubber interest‚Äù. After deportation to the US, he volunteered to join the US Army. Wilhelm Wiedermann, tractor driver and naturalised Costa Rican citizen, was also deported after being reported by the US military attach√© Lt. Col. E. Andino. Andino was later dubbed ‚Äúone of the most unreliable intelligence officers in the employ of the United States Government‚Äù by post-war investigator. In Panama, out of the 1000+ ethnic Germans interned, the ‚Äúmost dangerous‚Äù 150 of them along with their 97 family members were deported to the US. 30 of them were Jewish refugees, five of which have spent time in concentration camps before moving to Panama, while 37 members of the local Nazi Party were allowed to stay. The Justice Department concluded in 1943 that selection of internees and deportations were conducted ‚Äúwithout inquiry as to the loyalty or the danger of the particular alien.‚Äù  Internment   Legal basis of internment  Internment camp memorial in Crystal City, Texas Before their forced arrival to the United States, the deportees were deliberately not issued any visas. Once they arrived, they were arrested by the US Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) as illegal immigrants, which formed the legal basis for the US government to intern or expell them.  Conditions of the internment camps  The conditions of the internment in the beginning were quite poor as it was believed that the internees would be quickly repatriated. Once it was clear that many internees would stay in the camps for extended period of time, the Justice Department, which operated the camps, began improving conditions. Internees of German, Japanese, and Italian descent from both the US and Latin America were interned together. Crystal City, a purpose-built internment camp for large families had notably well conditions. Japanese internees beautified the camp with gardening and landscaping; education was provided in English, German, Japanese, and Spanish; a swimming pool was built for the children, large families have their own house with kitchens, bathrooms, running water, and ice boxes. Karl-Albrecht Engel, one of the internees from the camp, reported in a letter to the German government: ‚ÄúWe grew tan and swelled up like doughnuts from the good meal. Three hot meals a day, starting with eggs and sausages in the morning and ending with oysters or meat and potatoes for dinner. The canteen sold three kinds of beer.\\"  Repatriation   Ecuador  As the war came to a close, many of the interned Ecuadorians in American detention camps began requesting permission to return home to Ecuador (Becker 317). Camilo Ponce, The Ecuadorian Minister for Foreign Relations, agreed to most of the requests, stating ‚Äúthe majority of them, if not all, are individuals who have lived most of their lives in this country and did not leave of their own free will‚Äù. In 1945 Ecuadorian Ambassador, Galo Plaza, petitioned the secretary of state for the return of Axis country nationals still in internment camps, noting the justification for deporting these residents was ‚Äúto prevent them from engaging in subversive activities against the security of the American republics,‚Äù but now that the threat had passed. In 1946 the US State Department asked Ecuador if it would like those remaining in internment camps to return. Ecuador took control of its residents in April 1946 when an agreement was finalized and Ecuadorian residents began to return home.  Cuba, Peru, and Guatemala  For the Cuban and Peruvian residents interned in the United States efforts to return home were often improbable at best. Beginning in 1940 the American government took to blacklisting companies and individuals with German ties from these, and most, Latin American countries. The stated rationale was to deny funding to local Nazi sympathizing factions, however the reality was that these American policies made it increasingly difficult for any German detainee to return to their family and home. A nice side effect, for Washington, was of course the fact that in many cases these German companies were their greatest competitors in the region, so these blacklists effectively created American monopolies in certain industries. By the end of the war, those held in internment camps were either sent to the Axis powers in return for American nationals, or were given leave to return home. Of the returnees, 15 were eventually interviewed on their experiences in the American internment camps. Repatriation was particularly difficult for returning deportees who would lose everything through the internment, as with the case of Hugo Droege, whose farm in Guatemala had been seized after he was forcibly taken to America. Party ties prior to deportation often made repatriation difficult, as with the case of Droege, and some others, affiliations with the Nazi party, called by Droege ‚Äúnot real membership‚Äù haunted them beyond the war.  Post-war  Many of the deported German Latin Americans who would return to South America saw great difficulty in continuing life the same. Many countries had adopted strict anti-Nazi and anti-German policies, contributing to the governments seizing German holdings across Latin America. Repatriation took much more than just returning home, it was a process of becoming at home in Latin America again, a process that took longer than many would have hoped.  Aftermath and legacy   Aftermath  In the aftermath of the mass deportations, many companies owned by German deportees in Latin America were confiscated and expropriated, despite US intelligence recognizing that the resulting seizures would cause grave economic harm. Additionally, upon learning about the mass deportations of Germans from Latin America, the Nazi regime retaliated on the nations cooperating with the United States by scouring German occupied territory for their citizens and forcibly interning them. For the deportees, their fate after the war had varied greatly. Many had already been sent to Germany over the course of the war, but for those who had stayed in the US, some (depending the country they had been deported from) were given the opportunity to return back to Latin America. However, their return wasn‚Äôt necessarily the end of their ordeal, with many returning to find that their property and belongings had been confiscated. Additionally, these returning Germans found themselves marked and excluded from societies that the once thought of as home, as anti- immigrant and German sentiment dogged many Latin American countries as a result of the deportations.  US Congressional investigation and reparations  Ronald Reagan signing Japanese reparations bill In 1980, a Commission was approved by Congress as a ‚Äúfact finding study‚Äù to look into the deportation of civilians to U.S. internment camps. This commission published its report in 1983, bringing to light the US government‚Äôs actions in this period. However, this commission‚Äôs recognition of the treatment of German civilians from Latin Americans was limited only to its appendix. In 1988, the United States Congress passed the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, which granted a formal apology and reparations to Japanese Americans interned during World War 2, with a $20,000 US payout to all survivors. However, these reparations and the subsequent apology did not pertain to non-U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents who were deported to the United States from Latin America. Because the law was restricted to American citizens, and to legal permanent residents, ethnic Japanese who had been taken from their homes in Latin America (mostly from Peru), were not covered in the reparations, regardless of whether they had remained in the United States, had returned to Latin America, or had been deported to Japan after the war. In 1996, Carmen Mochizuki filed a class- action lawsuit,Court TV Library: Civil Rights Cases ‚Äì Japanese WWII Internment and, from what was left of the funds from the CLA, won a settlement of around $5,000 per person for those who were eligible. One hundred and forty-five of those affected were able to receive the $5,000 settlement before funds ran out. In 1999, funds were approved for the US Attorney General to pay compensation to the remaining claimants. To this day, no formal apology has ever been issued to Germans deported from Latin America.

When requested to disperse following the reading of the Riot Act, the workers refused to do so, and pelted the Yeomanry with stones and lumps of cinders. In response the Yeomanry, led by Lieutenant Colonel Edward Cludde, opened fire on the crowd. The uprising resulted in the deaths of three miners, two of whom were killed outright whilst another, Thomas Palin, was hanged for his participation in the disturbance on 7 April 1821. The name Cinderloo derives from the similar Peterloo Massacre which had taken place in Manchester just 18 months beforehand. Peterloo had itself been named after the Battle of Waterloo which had ended the Napoleonic Wars.  Background  The end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 brought with it a period of economic depression across the United Kingdom. Twinned with this, the Coalbrookdale Coalfields had begun to enter into a period of industrial stagnation and suffered competition from the iron works and coal production industries of South Wales and from the neighbouring Black Country. Facing industrial decline and competition from more productive coalfields, local ironmasters, including men such as Thomas Botfield, made an illegal pact to reduce the pay of their workers by 6d per day in order to compensate for their losses, announcing to their workers on 31 January 1821 that the pay reductions were necessary on the grounds of 'stagnation of trade' and the falling value of iron.  Collier Strike  In response to the lowering of their wages, colliers across the Coalbrookdale Coalfields went on strike on 1 February 1821 in order to demonstrate their dissatisfaction with the reductions being made to their pay. Production across the area was halted. A large body of men marched to ironworks at Madeley Wood and Dawley, blowing out all the furnaces, damaging machinery, and inciting unstriking workers to join in. The following day saw the strike continue. At that point it was considered necessary for county magistrates to call out the local yeomanry, initially two troops of the South Shropshire Yeomanry based at Wellingon under command of Lieutenant-Colonel Cludde, to aid the civil power. Striking colliers, many armed with sticks and bludgeons, left the ironworks at Donnington before moving on to halt the production of the furnaces at Old Park, about three miles from Wellington. Following this the crowd, now numbering between 300 and 400 people, moved on to the ironworks in Lightmoor, Dawley, and Horsehay. The striking colliers had intended to end their march at Coalbrookdale yet word of the strike had reached the Yeomanry. Instead of continuing on to the ironworks of Coalbrookdale the crowd returned to the furnaces at Old Park. By this point the size of the strike had swelled to an estimated 3,000 people including many women and children.  Arrival of the Yeomanry  By the mid afternoon the Yeomanry arrived to break up the crowd which had gathered at Old Park near two industrial spoil heaps known as the 'Cinders Hills'. As the magistrate, Thomas Eyton, began to read the Riot Act out to the crowd, ordering that they dissipate and return home, the mob refused to do so and the strikers responded by hurling rocks and cinders at the troops that had arrived to assist in their dispersal. An hour later the Yeomanry moved forward to arrest the ringleaders of the strike yet came under continued assault from the crowd. At this point Lieutenant Colonel Cludde gave the order for 'the cavalry to advance, to endeavour to disperse them'. The advance made by the cavalry resulted in the arrest of eight strikers who were removed from the crowd and were prepared for transportation to nearby Wellington in order to stand trial. Yet when the Yeomanry began to transport those detained away from the strike they came under a relentless shower of stones and cinders. In the confusion two of those being transported away managed to escape. In retaliation Colonel Cludde gave the command for the Yeomanry to open fire on the crowd. The Yeomanry opened fire on the crowd instantly killing William Bird, an 18 year old collier. By the time the crowd dispersed the Yeomanry had arrested the eight strikers. Another collier, Thomas Gittens, and possibly one other unnamed man, would later die as a result of the wounds he received.The account on page 21 of The Shropshire Yeomanry by E.W. Gladstone, states \\"One of the rioters was killed and several wounded, two more would die afterwards\\" (user's emphasis). Thomas Palin, singled out as the ringleader of the disturbances by the authorities, would later be arrested after he sought treatment from a local doctor for a bullet wound he received. An unknown number of strikers were wounded following the response of the local Yeomanry to the unrest. The Yeomanry reported a number of injuries as a result of the rocks and cinders hurled at them, however the most serious injury suffered by the Yeomanry came as a result of a misfired pistol going off in the holster of a cavalryman, injuring his leg.  Aftermath  On 3 February, Colonel Cludde was sent reinforcements by a troop of his own regiment from Halesowen (then an exclave of Shropshire within Worcestershire), both troops of the separately commanded Shrewsbury Yeomanry cavalry, and staff from the county Militia. On 4 February military presence in the area was increased to prevent any further outbreaks of violence. Three troops of the Shropshire Yeomanry were stationed in the coalfields alongside a troop of the 6th Dragoon Guards, who had arrived at Shifnal. This prevented the rioters assembling in large bodies although \\"numerous small parties spread themselves over the neighbourhood, begging, robbing and destroying property\\". The rioters gradually quietened, enabling the yeomanry troops to be sent home by 6 February.The Shropshire Yeomanry 1795-1945 by E.W. Gladstone, page 22. The initial dispute which had caused the riot was resolved soon after, with some ironmasters agreeing to reduce the daily pay of the workers by 4d instead of 6d. An inquest into the deaths of William Bird and Thomas Gittens resulted in a jury returning a verdict of Justifiable Homicide on 6 February. Of the nine arrested, seven were sentenced to nine months hard labour whilst Thomas Palin and Samuel Hayward were sentenced to death by hanging for the crime of Felonious Riot. Hayward managed to secure a reprieve on 2 April and avoided the death sentence. Thomas Palin was executed for his role in the strike on 7 April.  Legacy  The Cinderloo Uprising has been the subject of a number of songs. Notably the event forms the basis of the song \\"We've had enough\\" by local band Savannah. A bridge connecting Telford Railway Station and Telford Town Centre has also been referred to as \\"Cinderloo Bridge\\" by some residents of the town.

First formally described in 2013, the species is only known from two small populations, and is considered critically endangered. Description A slender palm, Coccothrinax jimenezii can grow to be high. Its leaves have sheathing leaf bases which wrap around the stem. These leaf sheaths are and lack spines. The petiole length can range from , but is usually long. The leaf leaves are palmately compound, is made up of 21‚Äì28 leaf segments which are long and wide and covered with whitish hairs. The entire leaf is long. Taxonomy Coccothrinax has a circum-Caribbean distribution, with most of its diversity in species endemic to the islands of Cuba and Hispaniola. The genus is considered \\"taxonomically difficult\\", and in need of a complete taxonomic treatment. Of the 39 accepted species of Coccothrinax in Cuba, 38 are endemic to the island; one species, C. fragrans is also found on the island of Hispaniola. Coccothrinax jimenezii was formally described in 2013 based on specimens collected by Dominican botanists Ricardo Garc√≠a & Milc√≠ades Mej√≠a in 2010, and named in honour of Dominican botanist Francisco Jim√©nez Rodr√≠guez. Based on DNA microsatellite markers the Haitian and Dominican populations appear to be sufficiently different that Brett Jestrow and colleagues recommended that the two populations should be managed separately for conservation purposes, and that individuals should not be transferred from one population to the other. Distribution C. jimenezii is known from two sites ‚Äì on the shore of Lago Enriquillo in the Dominican Republic and near the Baie des Gona√Øves, near Gona√Øves, Haiti. As of 2015 the Dominican population consisted of 16 adults and two juveniles, while the Haitian population consisted of 43 individuals, most of which were juveniles.  Conservation  Only two populations of C. jimenezii are known, and neither of them are considered secure. The population in the Dominican Republic lies within a protected area ‚Äì Parque Nacional Lago Enriquillo e Isla Cabrito ‚Äì the level of this hypersaline lake has been rising, and the population is at risk of inundation. Garc√≠a and Mej√≠a did not assign a conservation status to the species in their description because they did not know the status of the population in Haiti beyond a single collection from 1985. An expedition organised to find additional individuals in Haiti located a second population. The Haitian population is not protected, and the leaves are heavily harvested to make brooms; Br√≠gido Peguero and colleagues found only one individual in the Haitian population with a full set of mature leaves. Based on these findings, C. jimenezii was classified as critically endangered by Jestrow and colleagues in 2015.

The initiative tied together economic, environmental, and security issues in the Arctic. Gorbachev's aim was to transform the Arctic Circle from being a military theater to an international zone of peace among the Arctic powers. The initiative was launched as an invitation for disarmament of nuclear weapons and establishment of an East-West dialogue around the Arctic. The Murmansk speech's goals paralleled Gorbachev's ambitions in previous speeches, like the one in Vladivostok (July, 1986) dealing with Asia-Pacific relations and a later speech in Belgrade (March, 1988) dealing with problems pertaining to security in the Mediterranean Region.√Ötland (2008), p. 293. The Murmansk Initiative was considered a major turning point in the Arctic policy of the Soviet Union (USSR) and represented the application of Gorbachev's \\"new political thinking\\" in Northern Europe. It helped guide the foreign policy of the newly-formed Russian government in the Arctic after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.  History  Before the end of the 1930s, the Arctic had not been considered a zone of particular strategic interest due to its climate and difficulty of access. However, as developments of sea and air technology facilitated access, the Arctic North would open up to become another front in the Second World War. The Soviet invasion of Finland and German invasion of Norway and Denmark marked an unprecedented militarization of the zone, and following the German invasion of the Soviet Union, Murmansk provided Allied supply ships from the United Kingdom, an important avenue through which the Allies supplied the Soviets.left Following the end of the Second World War, improvements in air-power and rising tensions between the United States of America and the Soviet Union further intensified militarization of the Arctic. What had traditionally been a barrier between the two superpowers had become the shortest route between them, and fears of Soviet aerial incursions into North America fostered the creation of the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and the Distant Early Warning Line system in the late 1950s. Later tensions over intercontinental ballistic missiles and submarine launched ballistic missiles would lead to the Arctic becoming the principal area of operations for NATO submarines. For the Soviets, the strategic importance of the Arctic could not be overstated. Murmansk and the Kola Bay would become the home for the bulk of the Soviet submarine fleet, as NATO presence in the Dardanelles limited the capability of their fleet in the Black Sea.Nuttall (2005), p. 1306. The collection of Soviet military installations along the Kola Peninsula would be considered by Western analysts as being the most heavily concentrated system of air, naval, and missile bases in the world. These sites were critical in protecting key military and industrial sites in Northern Russia, including space launch and nuclear testing zones, sites to extract and process oil, natural gas and uranium, and a vast network of early-warning radars to detect any Western incursions into Soviet airspace. This response to the United States and NATO‚Äôs nuclear arms races would lead to the Kola Peninsula and surrounding waters to become the most nuclear region in the world, remaining this way until the disarmament initiatives were brought about by the Murmansk speech.Nuttall (2005), pp. 1301‚Äì1302. The idea of a nuclear-free Arctic, the first point of Gorbachev‚Äôs speech, was not a new one. A formal Soviet proposal had been made in 1958 by then Soviet Premier Nikolai Bulganin, and similar ideas had become popular in the following decades, especially in specific governments and organizations in Nordic countries. Gorbachev had seen these countries as potentially being more responsive to his ‚Äúnew political thinking‚Äù and towards the shift toward East-West dialogue, coming off the heels of the Reykjavik Summit of 1986, which Gorbachev would explicitly refer to as a watershed for more peaceful Cold War politics in the Murmansk speech.  Overview  Map indicating the area within the Arctic Circle On October 1, 1987, Mikhail Gorbachev gave a speech to the city of Murmansk that marked the beginning of a change in foreign policy that would be called the ‚ÄòMurmansk Initiative‚Äô.Nuttall (2005), p. 152. In the speech, Gorbachev discussed hopes for nuclear disarmament and more diplomacy with regards to the Arctic. He stated that the Soviet Union's military-industrial complex was a barrier to these peaceful discussions and spoke of the importance of the Arctic as a meeting place of three continents (Europe, Asia, and the Americas) and of ongoing security concerns.Gorbachev (1987), pp. 2-3. His speech invited all those in the Arctic region to engage in discussions about establishing a nuclear-free zone,Gorbachev (1987), p. 4. restricting naval activity, and encouraged peaceful cooperation on topics like resource extraction, scientific exploration, issues of indigenous peoples, environmental protection, and northern shipping routes.Gorbachev (1987), pp. 5-6. The speech had been called the beginning of the end of the Cold War in the Arctic.√Ötland (2008), p. 289.  Proposed nuclear weapons-free zone in the Arctic  At the time of Murmansk speech, the world already had achieved nuclear weapons-free zones in South America and Antarctica. Neither areas, however, were of as much strategic importance as the Arctic. Gorbachev offered to act as a ‚Äòguarantor‚Äô for the zone; he would agree to not use or threaten the use of nuclear weapons against other countries in the zone.Purver (1988), p. 148. The topic for a nuclear-free zone was mainly planned to be discussed with the Nordic countries.√Ötland (2008), p. 296. Norway and Sweden had both expressed interest in such a proposal previously and the Soviets were hoping that dismantling long- and short-range missiles would appease their objections. However, the idea was negatively received in the West overall. Some suggested that the denuclearization proposal was an attempt for the USSR to achieve a strategic advantage, something that the Soviet Union fervently refuted.√Ötland (2008), p. 297. As a result of the mounting pressure from the United States, no Nordic countries took up negotiations with the Soviet Union on this issue. This was not the first time that a proposal for a nuclear-free zone was put in place in the region. In fact, it was put forward even earlier by then Finnish President - Urho Kekkonen - in 1963, who pushed for a Nordic nuclear-free zone.  Naval restrictions in Arctic Seas  USS Skate (SSN-578), one of the US Navy's nuclear submarines used in the Arctic during the early 1980s Mikhail Gorbachev wanted to start relevant consultations on naval restrictions between NATO and the Warsaw Pact. He proposed to hold a meeting in Leningrad to discuss the prohibition of naval activities in mutually agreed zones of international straits and intensive shipping routes in the Arctic.Fokin & Smirnov (2012), p. 9. The aim of these discussions was to limit the size and frequency of naval exercises in the European Arctic and to totally ban naval activity in mutually agreed zones, but Gorbachev did not specify the exact location of the zones.√Ötland (2008), p. 298. It is possible that these initiatives were a response to the US Navy‚Äôs Forward Maritime Strategy and its increased submarine presence in the Arctic, allowing the United States to have a sizable advantage in the Arctic in the case of an all out war.Purver (1988), p. 154. There had been no large-scale Soviet exercises since 1985 due to budget constraints, so the proposal would have primarily impacted NATO allies. Thus, the proposal was passed off by the Western countries, believing these naval restrictions would have given the Soviets a unilateral advantage.√Ötland (2008), pp. 298-299.  Resource development  Gorbachev saw cooperation on resource development important to the Soviet Union's economic revival.√Ötland (2008), p. 301. This was part of a larger project to gain Western technology and capital. Gorbachev suggested setting up joint energy projects in the Barents Sea with Canada, Norway and others.√Ötland (2008), p. 300. The Norwegians rejected the offshore drilling initiative because of territorial disputes. Gorbachev was also interested in cooperating with Western companies in terms of mineral extraction in the Kola Peninsula. This was a major shift in Soviet foreign policy, however, it did not lead to joint ventures immediately.  Scientific exploration  Prior to the late 1980s, there was little interaction between the Soviet and Western spheres regarding scientific exploration of the Arctic. Scientists from the Soviet Union were not included in scientific gatherings in Western territory, and any collaboration was plagued with distrust.√Ötland (2008), p. 302. To change this, Gorbachev in his Murmansk speech proposed an international conference to be held in Murmansk for the purpose of coordination of scientific research in the Arctic region.Fokin & Smirnov (2012), p. 10. A picture of a Siberian Yupik woman taken during the time of the Russian Empire  Indigenous peoples  The relationship between Soviet Indigenous peoples and Western indigenous peoples was a delicate issue at this time. There were 26 Indigenous groups with almost 200,000 people living in the Soviet Union, and the industrialization and militarization of the Arctic had a negative impact on their livelihood due to increased pollution. Resource extraction, such as mining and ore processing, disturbed ecosystems which had further consequences on the quality of life for Indigenous people.√Ötland (2008), pp. 302-303. Prior to the 1980s, the lack of cooperation between the Soviet and Western spheres meant that Indigenous groups in the Soviet Union had not been given the opportunity to shed light on this issue in an international context. The Murmansk initiatives encouraged the Soviet Inuit to attend the 1989 International Circumpolar Conference meeting, providing an opportunity to bring attention to these issues.  Environmental protection  Prior to the Murmansk Initiative, the Soviet Union had a reputation for either ignoring environmental degradation or pursuing isolationist policies. They were not in the practice of pursuing or encouraging international environmental cooperation. Thus Gorbachev‚Äôs proposal to increase international environmental cooperation in terms of developing a joint plan for the protection of the Arctic's vulnerable environment, including the monitoring of radiation, departed from the USSR's previous policy decisions.  Northern sea route  Mikhail Gorbachev, on the dependence on the normalization of international relations, promised to open the Northern Sea Route for the passage of foreign vessels with the help of Soviet icebreakers. The Northeast Passage acts as a link between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and was seen by the Soviet Union as a crucial strategic and military area. However, as the shortest sailing distance between Northwestern Europe and Northeast Asia, it also had ample potential to provide trade and economic security.√Ötland (2008), p. 304. Cold War-era arguments which favored a military focus over commercial traffic were increasingly irrelevant given a new Soviet security sphere, and this contributed to the push for the opening of the Northern Sea Route.√Ötland (2008), pp. 304-305.  Reception  Grand Kremlin Place, the meeting place of the CPSU The Murmansk Initiative was heard and received positively throughout the world. It led to a restoring confidence in diplomatic negotiations in the European North which were lost during the Cold War, and laid the foundation for a fundamentally new arena for cooperation.Fokin & Smirnov (2012), p. 11. Domestically, after Gorbachev's speech, the Central Committee on the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) adopted Resolution 338 in 1988 titled \\"On Measures to Accelerate Economic and Social Development of the Murmansk Oblast from 1988-1990 to 2005.\\" The resolution helped to boost Murmansk on the world stage in terms of authorizing new contacts through Sister Cities International and, more locally, allowing the city and its surrounding Oblast to become more involved in discussions involving other Nordic counties in the Cap of the North. However, Resolution 338 itself was not fully implemented due to a lack of finances and the growing disorganization of the USSR's national economy.Fokin & Smirnov (2012), pp. 10-11.  Outcome  Gorbachev‚Äôs speech in 1987 sparked the beginning of various reforms intended to achieve the goal of increased cooperation and stability in the Arctic. Although there were no significant reductions in the military sector, other sectors saw reduced tensions and even cooperation in certain ventures.  Demilitarization  Limited demilitarization occurred in the Arctic in the aftermath of the Murmansk Initiative. Many of the demilitarization offers made by the USSR were considered negligible by Western observers.Purver (1988), p. 149. There were three main parts to Gorbachev's proposal for demilitarization: denuclearization, naval arms limitations, and confidence-building measures. The denuclearization initiatives were mostly unsuccessful because of Western suspicions towards the intentions of the USSR and the unwillingness for both the United States and USSR to withdraw nuclear submarines from the region. In a similar manner, Western states considered a naval-arms treaty too advantageous to the USSR to be worth practical consideration. The confidence- building measures were also mostly rejected due to the Nordic countries already establishing a process for such measures. Despite this, there were some positive demilitarization results that Gorbachev attributed to the Murmansk Initiative: the signing of the INF Treaty, the removal of INFs from areas adjacent to the European North, the elimination of sea-based nuclear missiles in the Baltic Sea, and the reduction in the number of ground troops stationed in both the European part of the USSR as well as in the Warsaw Pact countries by 200,000.  International relations  Current map of the member states and observer states of the Arctic Council Relations between the states involved in the Arctic normalized following the Murmansk Initiative. Western states like Norway and Finland were cautiously optimistic about the proposals made by Gorbachev. In fact, Norway and the USSR signed a joint agreement on June 5, 1991, in which they agreed on paying special attention on developing versatile and mutually beneficial cooperation in the Arctic.Fokin & Smirnov (2012), p. 14. The non-security proposals put forward by Gorbachev were received relatively enthusiastically and cooperation over development of the Arctic increased, particularly in regards to economic development. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the newly-formed Russian government co- founded the Council of the Baltic Sea States (1992), the Barents Euro-Arctic Council (1993), and later, the Arctic Council (1996). All intergovernmental organizations were created for the purpose of establishing multilateral cooperation on issues in their respective regions. Russia's participation in these organizations traced a continuity in its foreign policy development course that Mikhail Gorbachev laid out earlier in his Murmansk Initiative speech.  Economic outcomes  The Northern Sea shipping route was opened by the Soviet Union on July 1, 1991 to foreign vessels in part as a result of the Murmansk Initiative.√Ötland (2008), p. 305. Extraction of natural resources like oil and natural gases increased following the Murmansk Initiative due to greater cooperation between the various Arctic states. In particular, the USSR sought to establish a 'special zone' in the Barents Sea that would be open to extraction by the USSR and Norway. While the proposal was initially rejected by Norway, the USSR had established a willingness to cooperate with foreign companies in the sector.  Indigenous peoples  Gorbachev‚Äôs remarks on the need for closer ‚Äúcultural ties‚Äù led to closer interaction between various Northern indigenous groups. Until the late 1980s, indigenous peoples had little recourse to discuss various environmental and economic problems they faced within the USSR. With the Murmansk Initiative, indigenous groups were able to participate in conferences like the Inuit Circumpolar Conference held in Greenland in 1989. The participation of Soviet indigenous groups was symbolically important; however, little progress was made in practically improving their situation.√Ötland (2008), p. 303. The Arctic fox, a mammal endemic to the Arctic region  Scientific initiatives  The Murmansk Initiative encouraged further scientific research missions in the Northern Sea and Arctic regions. Gorbachev‚Äôs call to action for international cooperation in the Arctic was a catalyst in the International Arctic Science Committee (IASC), a non-profit organization composed of international science groups participating in Arctic science research. In 1988, over 500 delegates from the USSR, Canada, the United States, and the five Nordic states gathered in Leningrad for the Conference of Arctic States on Coordination of Scientific Research in the Arctic. Cooperation began in fields of research there were not sensitive, such as geophysics and biology, and gradually even fields like oceanography and resource development were included.√Ötland (2008), pp. 301-302. This marked the first time the two spheres had merged to collaborate on such an issue. These initiatives demonstrated the success of Gorbachev‚Äôs call to desecuritize the Arctic, and helped to facilitate emerging political cooperation in other areas at the time.

He also cites on the same page a pamphlet in which the term was used. Elsewhere the origin of the name is cited as a letter by Prince Maurice to one of his partisans in which he uses this qualification.) was a resolution taken by the States of Holland and West Friesland on 4 August 1617 on the proposal of the Land's Advocate of Holland, Johan van Oldenbarnevelt, in the course of the Arminian-Gomarist, or Remonstrant/Counter-Remonstrant controversy that was disturbing the internal politics of the Dutch Republic during the Twelve Years' Truce. The resolution brought serious disagreements about the interpretation of the Union of Utrecht (the Republic's \\"constitution\\"), that had long simmered, into focus. It started a political conflict that eventually brought down the Oldenbarnevelt-regime and led to Oldenbarnevelt's arrest on 29 August 1618, together with his colleagues Hugo Grotius, Rombout Hogerbeets, and Gilles van Ledenberg, and their 1619 trial, which resulted in their conviction of high treason, and Oldenbarnevelt's execution on 13 May 1619. Background Article XIII of the Union of Utrecht stipulated that the regulation of religion was a matter of policy for the individual provinces (so not of the \\"Generality\\"). It first reaffirmed the provision in the Pacification of Ghent, which gave the States of Holland and the States of Zeeland full discretion in religious matters in their jurisdictions, while the other provinces were constrained by the provisions of the \\"religious peace\\" previously promulgated by Archduke MatthiasAt the time the treaty was concluded (January 1579) the signatories were still formally members of the Union of Brussels who accepted Matthias as governor-general of the Habsburg Netherlands. Matthias had promulgated the \\"religious peace\\" (on the advice of William the Silent) in 1578. The article also provided that no province would be authorized to intervene in religious matters in another province.Finally the article stipulated that Freedom of Conscience was guaranteed for everybody, even where Freedom of Worship could be limited. The States of Holland, the government of the province of Holland after 1588, took its responsibility serious and in 1590 made a regulation for the Dutch Reformed Church, which gave it great influence on the organisation of the church, the appointment and pay of its ministers, and the financial support of the congregations of the churchThis made the Dutch Reformed Church almost, but not quite a State church, like the Church of England. But Israel prefers to use the designation \\"Public church\\", because the civil authorities refrained from interfering in doctrinal matters. Other churches, like the Lutheran church and the Mennonites were tolerated, while Roman Catholic public worship was initially prohibited.. In itself this was acceptable to the church as long as its autonomy, especially in doctrinal matters, was respected. But the fact that the parties in the debate between the followers of two rival theologians, Jacobus Arminius and Franciscus Gomarus at the University of Leiden about the doctrine of Predestination asked for the intervention of the public authorities made it inevitable that the government became involved. Some of the Regenten that made up the States and the local vroedschappen became partisans themselves. Others, like Grotius, tried to find a solution that would at least preserve the public peace. But the attempt to impose \\"tolerance\\" in doctrinal matters was itself seen as doctrinal encroachment, especially by the Counter-Remonstrants as the followers of Gomarus were known. The Counter-Remonstrants demanded that the doctrinal conflict should be decided in a National Synod, but this was unacceptable to Oldenbarnevelt, because this would make it a matter of national policy, and not of provincial policy, as prescribed by art. XIII of the Union of Utrecht. The dispute got out of hand when the members of the Dutch Reformed congregations took to the streets in 1614 and later years. This led to mob violence by which the city governments felt threatened, also because the schutterijen, who were responsible for keeping the public peace were often made up of Counter- Remonstrants themselves, and refused to protect the Remonstrant victims of the violence. Similarly, the stadtholder Prince Maurice, who was ex officio commander-in-chief of the Dutch States Army, was sympathetic to the Counter- Remonstrants, and refused to let his troops intervene to restore order. This came to a head when Counter-Remonstrants in The Hague forcibly occupied the Cloister Church for their services on 9 July 1617. The local authorities did not dare to intervene, and Prince MauriceCalling him \\"Prince\\" Maurice here is a bit of an anachronism, as he only inherited that title after his elder brother Philip William died in February 1618. Before that he was just Count of Nassau. made his sympathies clear by attending church services in this church. Israel, pp. 438 The resolution As The Hague was the de facto capital of the Republic where both the States of Holland and the States General of the Netherlands held their meetings, this defiance of the government was considered intolerable. Oldenbarnevelt overreacted by proposing a resolution to the States of Holland on 4 August 1617 which contained the following four points: # The States came out explicitly against convening a National Synod of the Dutch Reformed Church;Platt, p. 112 # This decision could not be protested before the Hof van Holland or the Hoge Raad van Holland en Zeeland, but only by petitioning the States directly;Historiek, Scherpe Resolutie # The local authorities in Holland were authorized to start recruiting mercenaries by the name of WaardgeldersThe name is derived from the German word Wartegelt (retainer). It was usually reserved for mercenaries who were hired to temporarily man the garrisons and fortresses when the States Field Army was out on campaign. to help maintain civil peace in their jurisdictions; # The commanders of the Dutch States Army garrisons who were paid by the province of Holland were ordered to obey the local Holland city governments, and not the commander of the army, in case they were requested to give assistance in maintaining local order.Israel, p. 441 Immediately there arose political and constitutional difficulties with the resolution. It was a majority decision where \\"Counter-Remonstrant\\" cities like Amsterdam (represented by pensionary Adriaan Pauw) were outvoted by \\"Remonstrant\\" cities like Rotterdam (represented by its pensionary Grotius). Majority decisions were not unusual in the States of Holland, but the minority accused the majority of having the decision prepared in secret discussions, initiated by Oldenbarnevelt, although the latter always denied that.Wijne, pp.245-250This accusation was one of the grounds for the court that convicted him in 1619 to declare him guilty of \\"leading a faction\\"; Wijne, pp. 248 However that may be, the minority never resigned itself to the decision, but remained steadfast in its opposition. Nevertheless, in itself the decision to formally reject the convocation of a National Synod (as advocated by the Counter-Remonstrants) was certainly within the remit of the States, even though it might be considered imprudent to abandon the putative neutrality of the Holland authorities in the conflict. As the Union of Utrecht prohibited every province from interfering in the religious policy of another province, and as the States General were supposed to decide by unanimity, Oldenbarnevelt could reasonably expect that the Resolution effectively vetoed the plans to convoke the National Synod. But his opponents outmaneuvered him and in September 1617 a bare majority of four against three provinces voted to convene a National Synod by May 1618.Israel, p. 446 The fact that the States reserved the adjudication of conflicts arising out of the Resolution for themselves, thereby taking the highest courts of Holland \\"out of the loop,\\" may seem objectionable to modern eyes, but the Separation of Powers doctrine had not yet been invented by this time and (like in most European countries) the courts acted in name of the sovereign power, who could take certain matters in its own hand, if it so desired. In the Republic the States of the provinces had assumed sovereignty after the Act of Abjuration. The States of Holland were therefore within their constitutional right. This was not a matter of dispute. But the assertion of absolute sovereignty in the decision to authorise the recruitment of mercenary troops to help in maintaining public order clearly was. The sovereign States of the seven Dutch provinces had agreed to \\"pool\\" their military resources and to delegate external defense and foreign affairs to the States General in the Union of Utrecht treaty. But did they by this act of delegation also transfer part of their sovereignty to the States General? Oldenbarnevelt denied it and he steadfastly asserted the absolute sovereignty of the States of Holland in this case.This was to be a central tenet of the ideology of the Dutch States Party in later years. His opponents, especially stadtholder Maurice, on the other hand, held the view that the States General were supreme in matters of defense and foreign policy. They therefore condemned this part of the Resolution as a breach of the Union of Utrecht, even though it could be argued that the authorization to employ Waardgelders was not a matter of external defense, but of maintenance of internal security.Israel, pp. 441, 446 Finally, the assertion that the federal troops that fell within the Holland repartitie (i.e. were paid from the contribution by Holland to the common defense budget) were first of all beholden to the Holland authorities, and not the stadtholder, was of course unacceptable to Maurice. Aftermath Maurice and the Counter-Remonstrant party vehemently rejected the Resolution, but Maurice was slow in taking forceful action. So the recruitment of Waardgelders was allowed to proceed in a number of Holland cities. Even the States of Utrecht passed a similar resolution and allowed the raising of Waardgelders in the city of Utrecht. But after a while Maurice started to undermine the Oldenbarnevelt party by \\"turning\\" city governments in Holland and Gelderland (like Nijmegen and Brielle, both garrison towns) that supported the Remonstrant cause, by intimidation with the help of States-Army troops, thereby reducing Oldenbvarnevelt's majority in the StatesIsrael, pp. 441-444 Also the States-Army garrisons of several towns refused to obey the Holland Gecommitteerde Raden (Executive of the States).Israel, p. 444 Then, in March of 1618, Maurice began to mobilize the five \\"Counter-Remonstrant\\" provinces in the States General. In May 1618 he managed to bring over the States of Overijssel (previously a Holland ally) to the Counter-Remonstrant side. The decision to convene a National Synod was then reaffirmed by a stronger majority in the States General, over the objection of the Holland delegation, led by Grotius. Grotius objected to the fact that the decision was not unanimous in a matter that the Union of Utrecht explicitly reserved for the individual, sovereign, provinces. In his view majority voting was only allowed in matters that had been delegated to the States General, like defense. Maurice objected in a speech to the States of Overijssel in May 1618 that the unrest about the religious controversy had become so serious that it had become a matter of internal security of the entire country, and therefore within the remit of the States General. On 9 July 1618 the States General began deliberating the disbandment of the Waardgelder troops in Holland and Utrecht, over the objection of those provinces. The usual standpoints were exchanged and the States General overruled Holland and Utrecht by five votes to two. The States General then authorized the stadtholder to disband the Waardgelders in the city of Utrecht. In desperation Oldenbarnevelt sent Grotius and Hogerbeets to Utrecht province to summon the commanders of the federal troops in that province that were paid by Holland (i.e. most of them) to obey the States of Holland and not the stadtholder. This action was later to be the main article in the indictment before the court that tried Oldenbarnevelt, Grotius and the other \\"conspirators\\" for high treason. Maurice was not deterred and proceeded with the disarmament of the Waardgelders in Utrecht city. Next he purged the Delegated States of Utrecht, bringing that province into the Counter-Remonstrant fold.Israel, pp. 447-448 Oldenbarnevelt then conceded defeat. The Remonstrant cities in Holland voluntarily disbanded their Waardgelders. Grotius and he also acquiesced in the convening of a National Synod. But these concessions were not enough. The States General passed a secret resolution on 28 August 1618, authorizing the stadtholder to arrest Oldenbarnevelt and his colleagues, which he did the next day. They were brought before an ad hoc court as the States General did not have its own judiciary. The defendants protested this in vain with an appeal to the principle of Jus de non evocando. Also the charge of high treason against the States General (Crimen laesae majestatis) was dubious on the by now familiar ground that the supremacy of the States General was contested, but the court unanimously convicted the defendants on 12 May 1619. Oldenbarnevelt was executed the next day.Israel, pp. 448-449Ironically, the Counter-Remonstrant preacher Antonius Walaeus, who ministered to Oldenbarnevelt in the night before the latter's execution later asserted that Oldenbarnevelt turned out to have theological ideas that were much closer to those of Gomarus than those of Arminius on the doctrine of Predestination. Apparently, Oldenbarnevelt was therefore no Remonstrant personally ; Cf.

The regiment was divided into two companies in 1944 upon moving into France including; * 2nd Tactical Air Force Main Company * 2nd Tactical Air Force Reserve Company At the end of the Second World War, the regiment's two companies were stationed at Bad Eilsen and Bueckeburg in Western Germany. From 1952 to 1954 the squadron supported the West Germany-based No. 83 Group RAF. In 1959, the 11th Air Formation Support and 12th Air Formation Support Signals Regiment were hurriedly deployed to the Far East but were disbanded in 1971 upon returning to Germany. As a result of their disbandments, 21st Signal regiment was the only remaining air formation signals regiment. From 1971 until 1992 the regiment was part of the 4th Signal Group supporting the British Army of the Rhine. After the Options for Change plan, the regiment was re-designated as 21st Signal Regiment (Air Support) and moved to Colerne where it remains presently. During the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, the regiment provided communication support for the Joint Helicopter Command (which consisted of 27 Puma and Chinook helicopters, as well as around 1,100 personnel).Cordesman, Anthony H., The Iraq War: Strategy, Tactics, and Military Lessons, Praeger, 2003, After the initial Army 2020 reforms, the regiment was assigned as part of 7th Signal Group within 11th Signal Brigade and Headquarters West Midlands.

For example, the Brazilian isolate is referred to as SPLCV-Br. The sweet potato leaf curl virus is one of more than 20 viruses known to infect the sweet potato. It is part of a group of sweet potato-infecting Begomoviruses generally known as \\"sweepoviruses\\". Viruses are common among sweet potatoes because their propagation is commonly dependent on stored roots or stems. Therefore, viruses can build up and have delayed emergence over the years. Viruses in sweet potatoes are problematic because they decrease crop yield and quality of storage roots. This is problematic as sweet potatoes are ranked seventh for global food crops. Sweet potato leaf curl virus is commonly transmitted from insect to plant by whiteflies (Bemisia tabaci). Additionally, it can be transmitted from plant to plant via vegetative propagation, grafting, or the seeds. It is widely speculated that management of the whitefly population is essential to managing the spread of the SPLCV virus between infected and uninfected plants. In one case, the infection spread rapidly between plants within only two years of field planting.  Structure  The virus is short, rod-shaped, and non- enveloped. The nucleocapsid has been measured at 38 nm long and 15-22 nm in diameter. Each nucleocapsid includes 22 capsomeres. Particles are two incomplete icosahedra joined together.  Genome  The genome consists of 2.8 kb of circular single stranded DNA (ssDNA). Unlike the majority of virus genomes in the Begomovirus family which are bipartite, the SPLCV is monopartite. It contains only a single genomic component, which is similar to DNA-A of bipartite viruses. DNA-A typically encodes products for DNA replication, controls gene expression, and controls insect transmission. This suggests it is originally from the Old World. However, SPLCV (and other related sweepoviruses) are phylogenetically distinct from both Old World and New World Begomovirus groups. The genome contains six open reading frames (ORF). Two are located on virion sense strand which runs 3‚Äô to 5‚Äô (V1 and V2). The other four are located on complementary sense strand which runs 5‚Äô to 3‚Äô (C1, C2, C3, and C4). They are separated by an intergenic region (IR) which contains a conserved stem-loop sequence motif.  Replication cycle  Virus particles enter the host cell and then the uncoated viral genome enters the nucleus of that cell. Within the nucleus, the viral genome is amplified and goes through the process of DNA replication.  Entry into cell  At this time, the mechanisms behind the entry of SPLCV into host cells are unclear.  Replication and transcription  One aspect of the replication process of the geminivirus (SPLCV genus) replication cycle includes the conversion of (-) viral ssDNA to (+) dsDNA intermediate. Many mechanisms of (-) DNA replication initiation in the SPLCV have been identified but this first step in the replication process is thought to be catalyzed by host factors. The presence of DNA primase along with polymerase activity has been noted as one method of replication initiation. During replication, (-) viral ssDNA is converted to (+) dsDNA intermediate upon activation of the (-) strand origin of DNA replication. As replication continues, elongation occurs in order to produce dsDNA followed by the production of covalently closed circular dsDNA. During another aspect of SPLCV replication, supercoiled (ccc)dsDNA is converted into dsDNA and ssDNA by rolling-circle replication. Pivotal viral proteins have various effects on the replication and translation of SPLCV. All geminiviruses encode a REP protein, which is one protein that influences initiation of replication while also allowing for the continuation of replication past that point. The RepA protein contains three RCR conserved motifs and behaves similarly to the REP protein. The REn protein has been identified during this process but its role is currently unknown. Other proteins such as R2 and CP have been hypothesized to participate in the witch from the rolling circle to the ssDNA genomes. TrAP is a 15-kDa transcriptional activator protein that is also called AC2 or AL2 and is unique to begomoviruses (SPLCV family). C2 is a related protein that was identified in the SPLCV replication and transcription processes but it is unclear what it accomplishes. TrAP is a required activation protein. Truncated mRNAs found in SPLCV cannot be spliced. They are able to be translated into the RepA protein. The RepA protein is necessary in the viral-sense transcription that results in the production of MP and CP. Termination mechanisms for SPLCV replication are present but their exact mechanics have yet to be identified.  Assembly and release  The Rep protein is responsible for termination. It cuts and releases newly synthesized ssDNA in order to create many copies of viral ssDNAs.  Symptoms  Leaf curl virus on Capsicum plant. Physical symptoms are synonymous in sweet potatoes.The primary symptom of SPLCV includes upward leaf curling. This is primarily seen in young plants with SPLCV. As plants mature, it is common for visual symptoms to dissipate. Additional symptoms of SPLCV include seedling twisting, deformation of floral tissues, and reduction of pollen fertility and seed number. A common method for analyzing symptoms is through the use of PCR (Polymerase chain reaction). Another symptom is stunted development of the anther and pollen. A C4 protein related to the SPLCV interacts with brassinosteroid-intensive 2 (ABtBIN2) in the plasma membrane of host cells. This results in the C4 protein re-localizing AtBIN2-interacting proteins in the nucleus of the host cell, altering the expression of brassinosteriod (BR)-genes to cause the activation of BR-signaling pathway. This causes the down-regulated expression of key genes that are necessary to the development of the anther and pollen. SPLCV is most common in sweet potatoes, but symptoms have also been observed in blue morning glory (Ipomoea indica).  Interaction with host  Bemisia tabac). The sweet potato whitefly (Bemisia tabac) transmits over 100 plant viruses, one of these being SPLCV. Both male and female whiteflies have been shown to transmit SPLCV to a similar efficiency. Furthermore, the whiteflies do not carry the virus for life. Instead, they have been shown to carry it for a maximum of 35 days. Transmission occurs in a persistent-circulative manner. Persistent refers to how the virus passes through the gut to the haemolymph, and then to the salivary glands. Circulative denotes that the virus cannot replicate in both the parent and the insect. SPLCV is protected inside the whitefly by a chaperone protein produced by symbionts. This protein is called symbionin.  Control and prevention  Insecticides have been tested towards SPLCV prevention. A study in 2014 published in the Journal of Agricultural and Urban Entomology reported that insecticides were ineffective in decreasing whitefly populations, but they had a positive effect in decreasing SPLCV in about half of the sprayed plots. In order to work toward controlling the spread of SPLCV, it is necessary to know the three conditions that result in insect-transmitted viruses spreading. These conditions include a source of the virus, an insect vector that is present, and an insect that moves about. In many cases, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques are used to determine whether SPLCV has been transmitted. Whiteflies (Bemisia tabac) have been identified as the vector for the SPLCV and it is hypothesized that the reduction in this population would result in a reduction of the SPLCV cases. It has been determined that decreased feeding or increased flight activity of the whiteflies (Bemisia tabac) could interfere with the spread of SPLCV. This is one reasoning that generally backs up the use of insecticides. Control of whitefly (Bemisia tabac) vectors with insecticides has met with limited success in preventing the spread of virus diseases. In one study that spanned over two years, only 2 out of 36 plots used represented a decrease in the presence of whiteflies. Insecticides used in this particular study included imidacloprid, pyriproxyfen, acetamiprid, and pymetrozine. Due to the outcomes in this study as well as data gathered from similar studies, the consensus is that insecticides should not be depicted as a possible management approach for insects that infect sweet potatoes. In an attempt control the spread of SPLCV neonicotinoids were introduced. However, this resulted in worldwide resistance due to extensive exposure. In addition to this, there are now many examples of a cross cross resistance with other insecticide classes. Generally, when insecticides are used in an attempt to control the spread of SPLCV, rather than resulting in a decrease in viral infection, the incidence of disease increased. Despite previous evidence, it has also been reported that the chitin synthesis inhibitor, buprofezin, and the juvenile hormone analog, pyriproxyfen, when used along with neonicotinoids has been successful in managing the spread of SPLCV through whiteflies (Bemisia tabac).  Associated diseases  Sweet potato leaf curl virus is one of 322 species in the genus Begomovirus. It is most closely related to its isolates, distinguished by location. Some of the currently known isolates of SPLCV include: * Sweet potato leaf curl virus Brazil (SPLCV-Br) *Sweet potato leaf curl virus Puerto Rico *Sweet potato leaf curl Canary virus (SPLCCaV) *Sweet potato leaf curl China virus (SPLCV-CN) * Sweet potato leaf curl Georgia virus (SPLCGV) *Sweet potato leaf curl Guangxi virus *Sweet potato leaf curl Henan virus *Sweet potato leaf curl Lanzarote virus (SPLCLaV) *Sweet potato leaf curl Sao Paulo virus *Sweet potato leaf curl Sichuan virus 1 *Sweet potato leaf curl Sichuan virus 2 *Sweet potato leaf curl South Carolina virus (SPLCSCV) * Sweet potato leaf curl Spain virus (SPLCESV) *Sweet potato leaf curl Uganda virus (SPLCUV) Additionally, SPLCV is related to other sweepoviruses. Sweepovirus refers to all Begomoviruses isolated from sweet potatoes and other Ipomoea species. Examples include Sweet potato Golden vein associated virus (SPGVaV), Sweet potato mosaic virus, Ipomoea leaf curl virus (ILCV), Sweet potato mild mottle virus (SPMMV).  Tropism  The exact type of cell that SPLCV infects to cause disease is currently unclear.

The 2,860 square-foot Federal style building was built no later than 1852. After serving a variety of uses over the decades, the structure opened as a French restaurant on July 9, 1970. Over its decades as a bar and restaurant, Martick's was known as an artists' refuge, \\"a tiny isle of Bohemia set in a conservative city.\\" So steeped in the particular culture of its city in the 20th century, the restaurant was referred to as \\"the Natty Boh of French dining in Baltimore.\\" The building is located within the city's Bromo Arts District, and is within the Market Center district listed in the National Register of Historic Places, as well as the locally designated Howard Street Commercial Historic District. While not itself a designated landmark, Martick's was one of the historic structures used to justify the Howard Street district when it was proposed in 2018. Writing in the context of the demolition of many of its neighboring buildings (both in the 20th and 21st centuries), a 2018 Baltimore Commission for Historical and Architectural Preservation (CHAP) report described Martick's as \\"the only remaining vestige of the historic appearance of the street.\\" Early history The rowhouse at 214 West Mulberry Street was built between the 1830s and 1850s. Converted to a storefront around the turn of the 20th century, Yiddish-speaking Polish Jewish immigrants Harry and Florence Martick purchased the building as a grocery store in 1917. During Prohibition, the Marticks ran a clandestine speakeasy out of the store. Their son, Morris Martick, would later report that they kept bootleg gin and whiskey under the floorboards of the bathroom. Harry was imprisoned for a year for violations of the Volstead Act. After the repeal of Prohibition in 1933, the Marticks applied for and received a liquor license. They used this to convert the grocery into a corner bar, known to some patrons as the Mahogany Tavern. Martick's Lower Tyson Street Tavern In the late 1940s, taking ownership over from his parents, Morris Martick renamed the bar Martick's Tyson Street Tavern or Martick's Lower Tyson Street Tavern. He expanded beyond the traditional scope of a corner bar by bringing in such events as silent movie nights, chess tournaments and live jazz bands. Martick opened a nearby art gallery (Salon Des Refuses) down the street at 108 West Mulberry Street. The gallery served the art of many of his patrons who could not be accepted in more mainstream galleries. He eventually began allowing artists to feature their art in the bar itself, a rarity at the time, and the first in the city to do so. Shows at Martick's eventually brought critical attention to fledgling artists like Joan Erbe. By the 1950s, Martick's was viewed as \\"Baltimore's intellectual meeting place\\" and one of \\"the roots of Baltimore bohemian culture.\\" Leonard Bernstein, on visits to the city, was known to play the bar's piano. Billie Holiday, in the final years of her life, visited Martick's and sang with the house jazz band. Not associated simply with jazz performers, even Hank Williams was documented as having played at Martick's during this era. The bar was open to gays, at a time when this was still uncommon in the city (and country). As early as the 1950s, the bar was known as an important gathering place for \\"not only gay men and women but other members of what is now called the LGBTQ+ community, including bisexuals, crossdressers and people undergoing sex change operations by Johns Hopkins Hospital physician John Money.\\" Martick's is also cited as \\"one of the first integrated bars in Baltimore,\\" existing as such even while de jure segregation was still in effect in the city. In later years, Martick would state in interviews that the tavern had not in fact been integrated while Jim Crow was still on the books, but this is contradicted by other late statements of his about that time, that he \\"served anyone who came in [and] didn't worry about their race.\\" A former employee summarized the ethos of Martick's in the 1950s and 1960s as one where \\"you weren‚Äôt defined by your sexuality or your skin tone.\\" The bar also drew a clientele of diverse professions, from newspaper and radio men (Russell Baker, J. Anthony Lukas, Louis Rukeyser, Harley Brinsfield) to local and national artists (Joan Erbe, May Wilson, Raoul Middleman). Future film director John Waters frequented the area before he was of legal drinking age, loitering in the alley and depending on regulars to sneak him drinks. Waters, who visited with his friend, the future drag icon Divine, found Martick's a formative location for the group of artists that would eventually become known as the Dreamlanders. It was at Martick's that Waters met Pat Moran, with whom he would collaborate on all of his feature films. It was also where Waters first met actor and projectionist George Figgs. Maelcum Soul, yet another early Waters collaborator, was a Martick's bartender, and also the subject of an art show there in 1965, featuring 25 portraits of her in the nude. Meanwhile, the neighborhood around Martick's continued to evolve: originally part of a block of rowhouses, by 1950 the building at 214 West Mulberry Street was the last building of this type left on the block. In the mid-1960s, Martick closed the Tavern, stating in an interview that he \\"didn't care for the drunks and the bums\\" in the changing neighborhood. Despite the Tavern's prestige among the arts community, Martick would reflect back on it in a 1981 interview as merely \\"a crummy bar... I mean a crummy one.\\" Martick's Restaurant Francais An undated interior photo of Martick's Restaurant Francais Following the closure of the bar, Morris Martick traveled to the Normandy region of France to seek training in French cuisine. Opening July 9, 1970, after two years of renovation, the new Martick's Restaurant Francais boasted of being the first French restaurant in Baltimore. Initially, the restaurant attempted to affect the trappings of a traditional french restaurant, with waiters in tuxedos, a maitre'd and an authentically French chef from Paris. However, in short order, the chef was gone and Morris Martick himself took the reins in the kitchen. Taking on the bohemian character of the bar which had previously inhabited it, as well as the proprietor, Martick's restaurant was noted for its eclectic decor - snakeskin wallpaper, stained glass, hubcaps, bowling balls and plastic baby dolls hanging from wires.. This decor was entirely the work of Morris Martick. John Waters, now old enough to drink, remained a frequent patron. For this and other reasons, it gained a reputation as \\"one of Baltimore's quirkier restaurants.\\" Over the years Martick and his restaurant became famous for a few dishes, particularly the p√¢t√©, profiteroles, bouillabaisse. Due to a car crash, as well as security concerns, the storefront window and entrance were boarded up at some point in the 1970s. As the neighborhood continued to decline, the building was among those listed in city ordinances in June 1998 and May 1999 that permitted the city to take ownership of as part of an urban renewal scheme. Under a pact with the Maryland Historical Trust, then-Mayor Martin O'Malley arranged to protect many of those buildings, including Martick's. Closure and legacy Martick closed the restaurant in August or September 2008. At the time, he was receiving citations from Baltimore Housing inspections regarding flaking paint and lack of zoning permits. Martick continued to live in the building until his death on December 16th, 2011. The building then passed into the hands of his family. Even after its closure, Martick's has remained a frequent mention as one of Baltimore's \\"iconic eateries of yesteryear\\", and one of its \\"traditional destinations.\\" Particularly after Morris Martick's passing in 2011, a number of articles described the building and restaurant as \\"a hub of city artistic life,\\" and \\"utterly unlike anywhere else.\\" Failed revivals 214 W Mulberry following the closure of Martick's In December 2012, it was reported that the property was to be redeveloped as an imitation speakeasy-style bar, following a popular trend at the time. The plan for the new establishment, to be called Martick's, was partially spearheaded by Alex Martick, Morris Martick's brother. Initially predicted to open in February 2013, later this was pushed to August. Plans for the revival evidently were abandoned by December 2013 though, as the owners of the license transferred it to another club in nearby Harlem Park. In 2014, revival again seemed imminent, as the city's liquor board approved a new liquor license, to feature live entertainment. Despite the buzz of the previous year, the building was subject to a Vacant Building Notice as of 2015. In the same year, Baltimore architecture firm Murphy Dittenhafer proposed a large-scale redevelopment of the entire block in a plan which would have worked around the existing building at 214 W Mulberry, and in fact depicted it in their concept renderings of the larger project. In that case, the building was not part of their RFP submission since, unlike the rest of the block, the city did not own it. In April 2018, the building was sold to developer Jabber Five who announced yet another plan to revive it as an \\"eclectic, artsy eatery.\\" The developers had initially planned to demolish the building, but changed their mind after being informed of the building's historic heritage. Jabber Five's new plan was to have a restaurant downstairs, with an artist live-work space above. These plans too fell through, and the building was sold in December 2018 to Park Avenue Partners. Planned redevelopment and demolition In December 2018, Park Avenue Partners, LLC proposed to build a six-story mixed-use apartment and retail building with 115 units at the site of the former Martick's. The developers framed their plan as part of a rejuvenation of the historic Baltimore Chinatown, with a stated intention of encouraging Asian restaurateurs and entrepreneurs to occupy the space. The developer claims they attempted to integrate the historic building into the development plan, but ultimately requested approval to demolish it. The adjacent 1950s-era parking deck was approved for demolition and had already been removed in 2018. The interior of the building had been described as \\"gutted\\" by its previous owners in April 2018. The developers argued that the structure at 214 W Mulberry was too degraded at this point, suffering from water damage, crumbling masonry and mold. At the January 18, 2019 hearing of the city's CHAP, the staff recommendation was made that the Martick's building be determined to contribute to the historic Howard Street Commercial District. They based its historical significance upon three criteria: the building's significant contributions to the \\"commercial history of Baltimore's historic retail core,\\" the building's \\"association with Morris Martick\\" himself, and the building's significant \\"architecture as an example of a modest early-19th century side gable Federal style building that was later modernized with Italianate details.\\" The CHAP staff made the recommendation that the developer attempt to incorporate \\"all or a portion of the building\\" into any new development plans. At the February 12, 2019 hearing of CHAP, the developer again applied for demolition, arguing \\"retaining and rehabilitating the historic building will create a financial hardship.\\" The developer submitted six scenarios to CHAP, from full rehabilitation of the structure to its complete razing, and attempted to make the case that retention of the building would not be economically feasible. They argued a restoration of the building would cost 1.1 million dollars. The proposal touched off what the Baltimore Sun described as a \\"spontaneous revolt\\" among attendees to the hearing. Community activists, as well as the director of Baltimore Heritage argued for a postponement of approval at a minimum, citing questions about how the financial feasibility had been calculated by the developer. The Baltimore Development Corporation, the Downtown Partnership of Baltimore and the Market Center Merchants Association submitted written support for the demolition. The demolition also has the support of the president of the Baltimore City Council. Despite these endorsements, CHAP staff recommended a finding that the developer did not adequately demonstrate that retaining all or some portion of the building would be a significant financial hardship, and recommended disapproval of the request for the full demolition of the building. The CHAP committee postponed a final decision for a later hearing a month later. The Park Avenue Partners development group returned in early March with a proposal to restore and retain the front third of the Martick's building, in exchange for permission to tear down the remainder. The revised proposal followed consultation with CHAP representatives and others who favored preservation. At the March 12, 2019 meeting of CHAP, the committee voted 9-0 to approve this compromise plan, which retains the older portion of the structure, while tearing down the later (although still 19th century) construction in rear. The developer stated that carrying out this modified plan would be contingent on raising approximately $300,000 in additional funds, which they planned to explore raising with a non-profit partner. While the consent from the committee was unanimous, it was opposed by the Mount Vernon Belvedere Association and members of the community, who presented a petition asking the entire building to be retained. Johns Hopkins, head of Baltimore Heritage, supported the arrangement, seeing the retained portion as the \\"core\\" of the former restaurant and \\"the best shot we have at saving Martick‚Äôs.\\" References External links *Martick's Restaurant at Baltimore Heritage Category:1970 establishments in Maryland Category:2008 disestablishments in Maryland Category:Defunct restaurants in Maryland Category:Downtown Baltimore Category:Federal architecture in Maryland Category:French-American cuisine Category:French-American culture in Baltimore Category:French restaurants Category:LGBT culture in Baltimore Category:Restaurants in Baltimore ","title":"Martick's Restaurant Francais"},{"id":"60204703","text":"The Provincial Minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa for Finance is the head of the department of Finance in the Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

She later joined the Ottoman women's movement, and became one of the Republican era's women to obtain political rights by becoming the first female member of the Istanbul Municipal Assembly in 1930. In 1934, she became one of the first women parliamentarians of the Republic of Turkey, representing Erzurum for three terms.Erzurum Finance Office website , retrieved: 8 February 2009  Life  Elg√ºn was born in 1882 in Istanbul. In 1911, she was appointed to the newly opened Istanbul ƒ∞nas School after the Second Constitutional Era. She played an active role in social life as well as in the education sector. She was a clerk in the Association of Teal-i Nisvan, one of the earliest Ottoman women's organizations. During her tenure at ƒ∞nas School, the Ministry of Education asked her to prepare a project that would lead the system in the renewal of education levels; she later proposed that students should take courses in white-colored classes. When her projects were rejected by the Ministry of Education, she resigned in 1914. Between 1914-1917 she worked at the Pious Ministry (Evkaf Nazƒ±rlƒ±ƒüƒ±); she was involved in the rehabilitation and organization of the Foundation Schools established in Sultanahmet. In 1916, upon the invitation of the Governor of Syria, Djemal Pasha, she led the establishment of girls' teacher schools together with Halide Edib Adƒ±var in Syria, where she taught Turkish in Damascus, Jerusalem and Beirut. As the Ministry of Education, on the basis of centralizing all the education, took control of all the foundation schools, Elg√ºn thought that there was no longer a task for her in the official school sector and left her position. She later accepted the offer to restore an old school, which was established in Beyazƒ±t in 1915, but had come to the point of disintegration when Mustafa Satƒ± Bey resigned from his position as the school's principal.

After the war, Elg√ºn took part in the opening of the Istanbul Branch of the Turkish Aeroplane Society, which was originally established in Ankara, and was the president of this branch. She also took part in the establishment of the Istanbul branch of the Economy and Savings Society and later worked at the Halkevleri Istanbul Branch. Meanwhile, she returned to her working life in 1929 and was appointed as the director of Istanbul Girls High School. However, when women were granted the right to be elected to the municipal and provincial councils in 1930, she quit her post and joined Istanbul General Assembly as a member from Beyoƒülu. She was the first woman to be elected as a member of the Permanent Council of the Assembly. In the 1934 elections, she was again elected to the Istanbul General Assembly and the Standing Council. On 5 December 1934, when women were given the right to vote and to be elected, Elg√ºn participated actively in the celebrations organized by women. In the elections of 8 February 1935, she was nominated as a member of parliament by the Republican People's Part, and with 870 votes, she entered the parliament as a deputy from Erzurum in the fifth term.Erzurum Finance Office website , retrieved: 8 February 2009 On 24 March 1935, she was elected President of the Society at the Fourth Meeting of the Society for the Protection of Women. On 25 May 1935, she was elected as a member of the Central Executive Board of the Turkish Aeronautical Association and on 13 June 1936 she was elected as a member of the General Staff of the Institution in the General Assembly of the Child Protection Organization. In 1938, she assumed the task of chairman of the Topkapƒ± Fukaraperver Society and continued her role in this position until her death. She died on 23 March 1954 in Istanbul. An avenue in Osmanbey is named after her.

AB 250-3  The AB 250-3 could be suspended horizontally within a bomb bay or fuselage or wing hardpoint. It also had trunnions so it could be dropped by dive bombers. The body of the AB 250-3 was constructed of mild sheet steel and was of clamshell construction and hinged at the tail. It was divided into three compartments; a dome-shaped nose compartment, a cylindrical center compartment, and a cone-shaped tail compartment. The AB 250-3 could carry 108 x SD 2 anti-personnel bombs in its center section. The AB 250-3 was similar to the other AB 250 containers except it had six tail fins instead of four welded to the container with braces riveted between each fin. The nose compartment housed the fuze pocket which was welded to a bracket on the upper half of the container. The two halves were held together by a shear wire which passed through a steel anvil, in the lower part of the fuze pocket. When dropped a time fuze was triggered and after a few seconds, the wire holding the container together was sheared by a small exploder under the fuze. The case then opened and allowed the bombs to fall out. The containers were painted dark green with two longitudinal red stripes on tail cone.

Among other positions, he was the German Generalkommissar zur Besonderen Verwendung (\\"Commissioner-General for Special Duties\\"), directing the political affairs and propaganda in the occupied Netherlands from the middle of July 1943 until 7 May 1945, the end of World War II. Family Wilhelm Ritterbusch was a son of Hermann Ritterbusch a bricklayer from Zschakau (now Beilrode) a municipality in the district of Nordsachsen, in Saxony, Germany. His brother Paul Ritterbusch was one of the most prominent NS science functionaries. Another brother, Fritz Ritterbusch, was a Hauptsturmf√ºhrer of the Waffen-SS and Allgemeine-SS, a member of the guard staff of several Nazi concentration camps, and the commander of the Trautenau-Parschnitz camp. Life and work Ritterbusch participated as a company commander in World War I. In 1923 he joined the NSDAP (Member No. 6,316). During the Kampfzeit (\\"the time of struggle\\") before 1933, he allegedly worked as a Gauleiter (\\"Party Leader\\") for a while.Longerich: Parteikanzlei, S. 180. In 1937 he became the Kreisleiter (\\"County Leader\\") of the NSDAP in Torgau, Gau Halle-Merseburg. Ritterbusch giving a speech In the fall of 1939 Ritterbusch was considered by the staff of the Parteikanzlei (\\"Deputy F√ºhrer\\") for the position of Stellvertreter-Gauleiter (\\"Deputy Gau Leader\\"). In September 1939, Helmuth Friedrichs, a department head on the staff of Deputy F√ºhrer Rudolf Hess, classified him \\"to be used on all duties\\". After the German occupation of the Netherlands in May 1940, Ritterbusch was assigned to its administration in June. There he was subordinated as Reichskommissar Arthur Seyss-Inquart's Commissioner for the occupied Netherlands' province of North Brabant, to Commissioner-General for Special Duties, Fritz Schmidt. In a report Schmidt judged him to be \\"the best commissioner of the Reichskommissar in Holland\\".: Die Stellvertretenden Gauleiter und die Vertretung der Gauleiter der NSDAP im \\"Dritten Reich\\", S. 8. From October 1941, Ritterbusch was head of Department II B in the Parteikanzlei (\\"Party Chancellery\\") of the NSDAP. Department II B was responsible for the reporting system, propaganda and \\"celebration organization\\", as well as training issues within the NSDAP. Following Schmidt's death under uncertain circumstances in June 1943, Heinrich Himmler and Martin Bormann agreed to appoint Ritterbusch as his successor as Commissioner-General for Special Duties for the Netherlands. Accordingly, Adolf Hitler appointed Ritterbusch to the position and also as Head of the Netherlands Division of the NSDAP.Armin Nolzen: Der Arbeitsbereich der NSDAP im Generalvoern, in den Niederlanden und der besetzten SU. Ritterbusch was thus directly subordinated to Reichskommissar Arthur Seyss-Inquart as one of his four assistants. After Seyss-Inquart and SS representative Hanns Rauter, Ritterbusch was the third most important NS functionary in the occupation administration of the Netherlands. During his time in office, Ritterbusch's highest rank in the hierarchy of the NSDAP was Hauptdienstleiter (\\"Head Service Leader\\"). In 1943, Dutch resistance fighters launched several deadly attacks against leading Dutch National Socialists. On 5 September 1943, Ritterbusch decided secretly, with the Commissioner-Generals Hanns Rauter and Friedrich Wimmer, to introduce assassinations in reprisal for the resistance attacks. Death squads of the Dutch Waffen-SS were formed. These groups led to the formation of Operation Silbertanne (\\"silver fir\\") under Henk Feldmeijer. Reichsleiter Robert Ley (middle) and Anton Mussert (right), February 1944 During Ritterbusch's time in office as Commissioner-General, the influence of the NSDAP party apparatus in the Netherlands was strongly repressed in favour of an expansion of the SS power base in the occupied country. This was precisely what Himmler had set as his goal before Schmidt's appointment. Schmidt had put many obstacles in the way of the SS. Accordingly, Himmler demanded that Schmidt's successor must be a \\"strict representative of the Greater Germanic line\\"., pp. 1108 Bormann who, since 1942, had pursued a policy of submissive cooperation between the party and the SS, had bowed to this claim with the appointment of Ritterbusch. At a meeting held in The Hague on 30 July 1943, shortly after Ritterbusch's appointment, he was informed by Seyss-Inquart that unconditional loyalty to the SS leadership was a requirement of his future work. The SS representative, Hanns Albin Rauter, judged Ritterbusch as a \\"quiet, very orderly man of a pastoral character\\", pp. 1106 because of his obedient administration. According to the SS he refrained from interfering in their \\"political shaping\\" and was an exponent of the party who favored the politics of the SS. He was viewed as weak and did not cause the SS any difficulties. Bormann also conceded in a later report that Ritterbusch was not very energetic. However, he rejected the idea of Ritterbusch being appointed head of the NSDAP's main archive as proposed by his co-worker Walkenhorst, who characterized him as a \\"kind of party philosopher\\".Longerich: Parteikanzlei, 1992, p. 106. In history books, Ritterbusch has also mostly been described as a \\"colourless party functionary\\".Gabriele Hoffmann: NS-Propaganda in Den Niederlanden: Organisation Und Lenkung Der Publizistik Unter Deutscher Besatzung 1940-1945, 1972, p. 41.

She works on scanning electron microscopy, including Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), diffraction contrast and cathodoluminescence imaging.Carol Trager-Cowan's  Education and early career  Trager-Cowan was an undergraduate student at the University of Glasgow, where she earned a bachelor's degree in natural philosophy in 1983. She moved to the University of St Andrews for her graduate studies, earning a master's degree in 1984. Her dissertation considered hot electrons in Gallium arsenide. She moved to Royal Holloway, University of London for her doctorate, completing her thesis on electrostatic electron lenses in 1987 supervised by . She completed experimental and theoretical investigations into electrostatic lenses.  Research and career Trager-Cowan is a Reader (Associate Professor) in Physics at the University of Strathclyde. She develops fast, non-destructive characterisation techniques to study crystalline materials. In particular, Trager-Cowan works on nitride semiconductor thin films. Nitride semiconducting films form the basis of solid-state lighting, satellite communications and cable television. The performance of nitride light emitting devices depends on the number of extended defects, which can cause scattering of light or charges and result in poor device performance with short lifetimes. Defects limit device performance due to non-radiative recombination and high leakage currents. Extended defects including threading and partial dislocations, grain boundaries and stacking faults, and can be electrically active. Trager-Cowan develops sensitive characterisation techniques that can detect nanoscale defects, including electron backscatter diffraction and electron channeling contrast imaging. These make it possible to uncover the structure, texture and strain within semiconducting crystals. Trager-Cowan uses the Timepix semiconductor hybrid pixel detector developed by CERN. Timepix allows direct electron detection with exceptional detail. Electron channeling contrast imaging allows Trager-Cowan to analyse the failure mechanisms in nanoscale electronic devices. Trager-Cowan is a member of ManuGaN, a multi-university collaboration to fabricate gallium nitride on a manufacturing scale.  Public engagement and outreach  Trager-Cowan is involved in public engagement and outreach, delivering popular science lectures and running science workshops with schools. She was described by Gail McConnell as an inspiration. Trager-Cowan has worked with the Royal Philosophical Society of Glasgow, Glasgow Science Festival and European Researchers Night.

The project was developed by SunEdison, built by Mortenson Construction, and commissioned in September 2016. The electricity is being sold under a 20-year power purchase agreement to Rocky Mountain Power which serves customers in Utah, Idaho, and Wyoming. Project details Planning was initiated by the independent renewable energy developer First Wind (founded 2002) which began expanding into photovoltaic energy around 2012. The Enterprise Solar Farm comprises a minority of the 320MW Four Brothers Project, which also includes the three co-located 80 MW Escalante Solar Project units located about 5 miles north of Milford, Utah in Beaver County. The land area for each 80 MW unit ranges from 600 to 700 acres. First Wind and its extensive portfolio of assets in western Utah were acquired by SunEdison and its TerraForm Power yield co in November 2014. Beginning construction at the time was the 20.2 MW Seven Sisters Project, a dispersed set of ~3 MW facilities throughout Beaver and Iron counties. To finance construction of Four Brothers, SunEdison entered into a joint venture with Dominion Resources. The resulting entity, Dominion Renewable Energy, utilized $150 million from SunEdison and $500 million from Dominion to start construction in July 2015. Likewise, the two companies extended their joint venture to construct the 210 MW Three Cedars Project, which consists of three similarly sized facilities dispersed to the west of Cedar City, on about the same timeline. Four Brothers was built by Mortenson Construction. SunEdison provided about 1.3 million crystalline silicon solar panels from its team of international suppliers. Work progressed simultaneously at all four sites, employed an estimated 500 workers, and was completed in September 2016. Along with the electricity to power about 90,000 homes, Four Brothers is expected to produce $66 million in property and income taxes for the region over 20 years. The completed facilities are operated and maintained by Swinerton Renewable Energy. SunEdison filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on April 21, 2016, but was able to complete the project on time with its receipt of $300 million in bankruptcy debt financing. On September 13, 2016 the company was forced to sell its stake in the completed facilities in a fire sale. NRG Energy was the successful bidder.
