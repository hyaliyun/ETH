Hard Cash (1863) Charles Reade ‚Äì psychiatrists in 19th century fiction, in British Journal of Psychiatry, Feb 2009, 194 (3) 211 Background From later illustrated edition of novel It was originally serialised under the title Very Hard Cash in Charles Dickens' All the Year Round from 28 March to 26 December 1863, but the magazine's family readers blanched at Reade's strong attacks on asylums, so it did not perform well and actually depressed sales of the periodical. Dickens appended a note to the last instalment noting that the opinions of the work should be attributed to the author, not the periodical. Reade's work did better when released (with some reordering and amendment of the text, less concerned with creating instalment cliffhangers) as Hard Cash in three-volume book form by Sampson Low in December 1863.Wynne D.

The ‚ÄúHard Cash‚Äù is the sum of > ¬£14,000, the earnings of years, of which Richard Hardie, a bankrupt banker, > defrauds David Dodd, a sea-captain. Dodd has a cataleptic shock and goes > insane on realizing his loss. Hardie's son Alfred loves Julia, Dodd's > daughter. He detects his father's villainy, accuses him of it, and to insure > his silence is consigned by his father to a private insane asylum. There he > meets Dodd; a fire breaks out, and both escape. Dodd enlists and serves as a > common seaman, appearing to be capable but half-witted, until a second > cataleptic shock restores his reason, when he returns home. Alfred reaches > his friends, and vindicates his sanity in a court of law. The receipt for > the ¬£14,000 is found, and the money recovered from the elder Hardie. The > book properly divides itself into two parts. One embraces the maritime > adventures of Dodd with pirates, storms, shipwreck, and highwaymen, while > bringing his money home; and his subsequent service as a half-witted > foremast-hand until his restoration to reason.

The US Bureau of Land Management owns and administers the wilderness area. The semi- arid wilderness includes few natural resources but has a diverse geology, as well as a range of plant and animal species. There were multiple failed legislative attempts to establish the Sabinoso Wilderness, both as an individual bill as well as part of more comprehensive legislation, prior to the eventual success in 2009 as part of an omnibus bill. , the wilderness was inaccessible to the public without trespassing, as it and adjoining state- owned property were entirely surrounded by privately owned land. In conjunction with the Wyss Foundation, a plan to allow public access through the donation and purchase of additional adjacent lands was implemented and the wilderness opened to the public on November 10, 2017. Legislative history On June 7, 2007, Tom Udall introduced H.R. 2632, the Sabinoso Wilderness Act of 2008, which would have set aside a total of 15,995 acres of land for the site. The bill passed the US House of Representatives on June 9, 2008 by a voice vote, but never passed the Senate. On March 13, 2008, Ra√∫l Grijalva introduced H.R. 5610, the Protecting America‚Äôs Wild Places Act of 2008. Title III of the act, Sabinoso Wilderness, would have set aside 19,880 acres of land for the site. It was passed by neither the House nor the Senate. On February 9, 2009, Ben Luj√°n introduced H.R. 921, the Sabinoso Wilderness Act of 2009, which would have set aside 15,995 acres for the site, and was not passed by either chamber. Sabinoso was finally established as part of the Omnibus Public Lands Management Act of 2009, signed into law by Barack Obama on March 30, 2009.

Description View across Ca√±on Largo The Sabinoso Wilderness area consists of canyons and steep-sided mesas with elevations ranging from to . The mesa tops are grassland while the canyon walls support a pinyon pine and juniper woodland with scattered groves of ponderosa pine. The area is semi-arid receiving to precipitation annually. The canyon bottoms have periodically flowing streams, as well as deep incisions cut by the Ca√±on Olguin, Ca√±on Largo, and Lagartija Creek. Riparian vegetation such as cottonwood and willow trees is found along the ephemeral streams. Wildlife includes, elk, mule deer, black bear, and wild turkey. The northeastern corner of the wilderness area is near the Canadian River and the 1890s settlement of Sabinoso, now mostly abandoned except for a few remaining buildings. No other settlements, except a few ranches, are near the wilderness area. The nearest city is Las Vegas, New Mexico, about 50 miles distant by road. =Geology= The Sabino Wilderness contains a sequence of sedimentary rocks, which are close to flat lying or dipping very gently to the southeast. These rocks are almost entirely sandstones, siltstones, and shales, and represent geological time from the Late Triassic to the Early Cretaceous epochs. These rocks record a variety of paleoenvironments, including alluvial streams, floodplains, lakes and ponds, wind-blown eolian dunes, and in the youngest of the rocks, some sandy shallow marine settings. The geological formations represented at the surface within the Wilderness include the Santa Rosa, Chinle, Entrada, Morrison, and Mesa Rica Formations. Buried beneath the area are Paleozoic sedimentary rocks and Precambrian crystalline rocks making up the geological basement. Several of the lithologies present in the Wilderness have eroded to form prominent cliffs, including the thick sandstone beds of the Chinle Formation, and the Entrada Sandstone. The former are reddish-brown to maroon; the latter a salmon-orange color. =Mineral resources= United States Geological Survey map showing areas of moderate potential for Uranium In 1987 the United States Geological Survey published a report on the mineral resources of Sabinoso. They concluded that \\"no identified mineral resources were found in the study area.\\" While they identified some occurrences of uranium associated with the Chinle Formation, the deposits were too small, scattered and low-grade to constitute a viable resources for uranium. =Cultural resources= As of 2013 the area had not been systematically surveyed for cultural resources. However, the archaeological record of the surrounding territory suggests a high density of prehistoric Paleo-Indian sites, as well as sites related to the period of homesteading and ranching, around the mid-19th century. Many of the artifacts which have been found in the area are centered along the Largo Canyon Road which is thought to be a pre-historic trail, as well as a road used by the United States Army to connect Fort Union and Fort Bascom. =Grazing= Cattle grazing on Sabinoso is rare due to the relative scarcity of water. However, 10 grazing allotments had been granted as of 2013, with grazing taking place mostly in the southern portion of the area. Public access Map of the Sabinoso Wilderness including grazing areas, state owned land, and the planned addition of the Rimrock Rose Ranch and an access road. Sabinoso Wilderness Area is surrounded by privately owned land and initially had no route for public access. About a dozen state-owned parcels of land adjoin Sabinoso, but they are themselves also \\"landlocked,\\" entirely surrounded by privately owned property. In 2016 the Wilderness Land Trust, financed by the Wyss Foundation, purchased the Rimrock Rose Ranch for $3,150,000 with the goal of enabling public access to the area. The environmental evaluations needed before visitors would be allowed to enter the park, were estimated to require up to a year to complete, and were made available for public comment as of August 2016. In August 2016, The Bureau of Land Management proposed to accept a donation of of the Rimrock Rose Ranch for addition to the Wilderness Area. The BLM proposed to purchase the remaining of the ranch, as well as of inholdings. They also plan to cancel two allotments for livestock grazing to alleviate the impact on the sparse riparian environments. The transfer of the land was finalized in 2017. The Wilderness became open to the public on November 10, 2017, accessible from an improved dirt road along San Miguel County Road C51A. Ryan Zinke, the United States Secretary of the Interior stated \\"the Sabinoso Wilderness Area is finally open and accessible to hunters and all members of the public for the first time ever.\\" See also * List of U.S. Wilderness Areas * National Wilderness Preservation System Notes References External links Wilderness Areas of New Mexico Protected areas of San Miguel County, New Mexico Bureau of Land Management areas in New Mexico Protected areas established in 2009 2009 establishments in New Mexico ","title":"Sabinoso Wilderness"},{"id":"53491539","text":"Light Fantastic is an album by the American ambient musician Steve Roach, released in 1999.

Probably built in 1851 for a local lockmaker, it is one of three surviving 19th-century water wheels in the state. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places listings in 2002. Description and history The Terryville Waterwheel is located in Terryville, a historic 19th- century manufacturing district of eastern Plymouth, and now the town's main commercial center. It is located on the north side of Main Street (United States Route 6) on the western bank of the swiftly flowing Pequabuck River. The wheel is built out of wood and iron, and is mounted in its original wheel well formed out of rubblestone capped in concrete. It is in diameter and wide, and is sheltered by a form-fit shelter erected in 1951. Most of the wheel's parts are pressure-treated wood, replacing original materials in a 1990-91 restoration. The axle of the wheel is cast iron, with a cast iron hub providing attachment mortises for the wheel's arms. The arms are fastened to the hub with metal bolts, and are cross braced with iron tie rods. The wheel was traditionally thought to date to the construction of Eli Terry's clock factory, which was built on this site in 1824. However, that factory was destroyed by fire in 1851, and was rebuilt by its then-owner, the Lewis Lock Company. It is believed that the present wheel fittings date to that period. The wheel was powered by water delivered from a dam upriver (no longer extant) via a wooden head race (also not extant, although it survived until 1951). This wheel provided power to lockmaking concerns until about 1940, when the factory was demolished. Of Connecticut's three surviving 19th-century water wheels it is the best preserved.

He appeared in 175 La Liga matches during seven seasons, with Athletic Bilbao and Rayo Vallecano. Playing career =Early years / Athletic= Born in Bergara, Gipuzkoa, Basque Country, Etxeberria began playing with local Mondrag√≥n FC in Tercera Divisi√≥n, based in Arrasate. In 1994 he moved to SCD Durango at the same level, helping them promote to Segunda Divisi√≥n B in his sole season. Exteberria's performances drew the attention of regional giants Athletic Bilbao, and in summer 1995 he was signed on the recommendation of goalkeeping legend Jos√© √Ångel Iribar, joining a professional club for the first time at the relatively old age of 22. He was initially assigned to the reserve team, who was eventually relegated from Segunda Divisi√≥n. Etxeberria was promoted to the main squad for 1996‚Äì97, and after spending the first half of the campaign as back-up to Juanjo Valencia he made his La Liga debut on 9 February 1997 in a 1‚Äì1 away draw against Rayo Vallecano, and subsequently became the starter. The former later stated that he enjoyed competition between them, and that he considered the latter a friend (both went on to work as youth coaches at San Mam√©s). In 1997‚Äì98, Etxeberria played all 38 league games as the Lions finished in second position, adding 37 the following season. In that year's UEFA Champions League group stage, even though his team ranked last, he conceded only six goals in as many matches. Etxeberria eventually lost his starting position to I√±aki Lafuente, being further demoted to third-choice by fellow youth graduate Daniel Aranzubia under manager Txetxu Rojo. He was willing to leave the club, but Athletic asked for a transfer fee which no other clubs were willing to meet, so he remained on the payroll without making a single appearance during the 2000‚Äì01 campaign; he left on 30 June 2001, having made 140 appearances all competitions comprised. =Rayo / Later career= Etxeberria then moved to fellow league side Rayo Vallecano, replacing the departed Kasey Keller. In his first season he beat competition from veteran Julen Lopetegui, helping to an 11th-place finish. From 2002 to 2004, Etxeberria played 35 league games but was also consecutively relegated. In the latter campaign, which saw Lopetegui kickstart his managerial career, the player was largely overlooked in favour of Sergio Segura by Lopetegui's successor Jorge D'Alessandro, who then brought in another goalkeeper, his compatriot Sebasti√°n Saja, on loan; Rojo became the third coach in February 2004, and he also had no place in his plans for Etxeberria, who was released and trained with Bilbao Athletic to stay fit. Etxeberria then dropped down to the third level to play for Cultural y Deportiva Leonesa, leaving at the end of the season. He returned to division two and his native region in the summer of 2005, being first-choice for SD Eibar but being relegated as last; he then chose to retire from the game, aged 33. =International= Etxeberria never earned any caps for Spain at any level. He did feature for the unofficial Basque Country regional team. Coaching career Afterwards, Etxeberria spent some years as goalkeeping coach for Athletic's youth teams, interrupted by a spell performing the same role at SD Lemona working under his former teammate Aitor Larraz√°bal. In 2012, he became Bilbao Athletic's goalkeeping coach as part of the backroom team led by another former teammate, Jos√© √Ångel Ziganda. When Ziganda was promoted to senior team boss in summer 2017, Etxeberria moved up with him to continue in his specialist role. Personal life Etxeberria operated a training scheme for young goalkeepers, based in Deusto. He was not related to Joseba Etxeberria, his teammate for several years at Athletic and later a colleague on the coaching staff at the club. Coincidentally, they were raised just a few miles from one another (Joseba hailed from Elgoibar).

History Modern bridge into the castle The castle was probably built in the 13th century by the Masein/Rialt family near Untertagstein Castle. In 1316 Margareta von Rialt left all her properties in Tagstein to her nieces. The first mention of a castle in the area is in 1322, but it probably refers to Untertagstein in Masein. In 1322 the male line of the Rialt family died out and it was inherited by the B√§renburg family. The B√§renburg family were ministerialis, or unfree knights in service to a higher noble, to Vaz family. After the extinction of the Vaz family in 1337, they became vassals of the Counts of Toggenburg and the castle was given to the Tumb family. They began to refer to themselves as von Tagstein, but again probably referring to Untertagstein. In 1385 and 1387 Untertagstein is specifically mentioned. The castle was originally built with an outer gate at the south-west corner of the castle. This gate led to narrow path that wrapped around the southern side of the castle, passed through a middle gate and then led to an inner gate on the east side. At some point in the castle's history the western wall at the main cistern collapsed. The cistern was abandoned and the hole in the wall became a new gate. The old outer gate was then walled up. In the 15th century the castle was gutted by a fire and abandoned. In 1512 the ruins of Obertagstein were recorded in the property of Cazis Priory. As early as the 16th century the castle was visited by hikers who carved their initials and dates into the plaster walls. Castle site Floorplan of the castle The castle occupies the entire top of a small rock outcropping south of Thusis. The castle complex is about . Storage buildings and workshops were probably built on the mountain side of the outcropping and were separated from the castle by a ditch. Above the ditch was a ring wall that is mostly still standing. During construction the trunks of two trees were left standing and incorporated into the wall.

Originally a Swedish Army officer, Virgin became commanding officer of the Svea Train Corps (T 1) in 1926 and was appointed Inspector of the Swedish Army Service Troops the year after. In 1931 he was appointed Chief of the Air Force for the newly established Swedish Air Force. Virgin left the position as major general in 1934 to become advisor to the Emperor of Abyssinia. He left Abyssinia two days before the outbreak of the Second Italo- Ethiopian War in 1935 and back in Sweden he was placed in the Swedish Air Force reserve where he remained until 1947. Virgin died three years later. Career Virgin was born on 18 May 1876 in Sk√∂vde, Sweden, the son of colonel Ivar Virgin and his wife Hedvig (n√©e af Klint). He was commissioned as an officer in Sm√•land Grenadier Corps (I 7) in 1898 with the rank of underl√∂jtnant and attended the Royal Central Gymnastics Institute from 1899 to 1901 and the Royal Swedish Army Staff College from 1902 to 1904. Virgin served at the Horse Life Regiment (Livregementet till h√§st, K 1) in 1903 and was promoted to l√∂jtnant in 1904 and served as a company officer at the Royal Military Academy in 1905. Virgin then served at Wendes Artillery Regiment (A 3) in 1907 and at the Swedish State Railways from 1908 to 1910. He was a teacher at the Royal Swedish Army Staff College from 1910 to 1916 and became captain of the General Staff in 1912. The year after, Virgin served at Positionsartilleriregementet (A 3) and he became captain in the Life Regiment Grenadiers (I 3) in 1916. He accompanied the 1st, 5th and 10th Austro- Hungarian Army in 1917 and was a member of the Study Commission to the German Western Front in 1918. Back in Sweden, Virgin was appointed chief adjutant (√∂veradjutant) and major of the General Staff in 1918 and was appointed head of the Communications Department there in 1919. Virgin was appointed chief adjutant and was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1922. He became commanding officer of Svea Train Corps (Svea tr√§ngk√•r, T 1) in 1926 and was appointed Inspector of the Swedish Army Service Troops (Tr√§nginspekt√∂r) in 1927. Virgin was promoted to major general and was appointed Chief of the Air Force and head of Flygstyrelsen in 1931. He left the post in 1934 to become political and military advisor to the Emperor of Abyssinia the same year. Virgin and captain Viking Tamm as well as four other military officers (the lieutenants Nils Bouveng, Arne Thorburn, Gustaf He√ºman and Anders Nyblom) entered together into the Abyssinian service to organize the country's only military school for the training of Abyssinian officers. A Swedish military academy for cadets was established in Holeta Genet under captain Tamm who, with his staff, stayed on in Abyssinia after the outbreak of the Second Italo-Ethiopian War despite pressure by the Swedish government to return. Virgin, who in Abyssinia was called \\"the White Emperor\\" and \\"Italy's enemy No. 1\\" because of his great influence, did nothing to dampen the Italian annoyance. On the contrary, he tried to tease Rome by recurrent condescending comments about Italians' military skills and their little prospect to emerge victorious from an armed conflict with the Abyssinians. He went so far as to even captain Tamm and the Swedish consul in Addis Ababa turned to the Foreign Ministry in Stockholm and asked for a transfer of the talkative general. The result was that Virgin left Abyssinia on 1 October 1935, only two days before the Italian invasion. Back in Sweden he was placed in the Swedish Air Force reserve in 1936 where he stayed until 1947. Other work Major General Virgin (third from right) in Addis Ababa in 1934. Virgin was chairman of the Military Association K.H.S. from 1918 to 1923 and secretary of Military Literature Association (Milit√§rlitteraturf√∂reningen) from 1914 to 1918. He was also an expert for the reorganization of the Road and Waterway Construction Service Corps in 1924, for the drafting of war regulations for the Swedish Air Force in 1928 and chairman of the experts drafting the new field service regulations for the Swedish Army in 1929. He became a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of War Sciences in 1924 and was second president from 1937 to 1940. Virgin was a member of the National Board of the Swedish Red Cross in 1927 and of the central board of the voluntary defense organization R√∂da stj√§rnan from 1928 to 1931. He was a board member of the Royal Automobile Club in 1928 and was its chairman from 1933 to 1934 and its first vice chairman from 1940 to 1943.

Being the first of the eleven Street Fighter V Premier Events of the 2017 Capcom Pro Tour, the winner of the tournament automatically qualified for the Capcom Cup in December 2017. The event also hosted an Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 tournament after the game was absent in 2016, and the first major For Honor tournament. Background Final Round 20 took place on March 10‚Äì12 in Atlanta, Georgia and featured various fighting game tournaments. As staff and participants of Final Round 19 encountered issues regarding the size of the venue, Final Round was held in a 37,500 square foot exhibit hall, with all games being played in one room. Online registration for the event was handled by Smash.gg. In celebration of its 20th anniversary, Final Round hosted an Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 tournament, which was absent in the previous year due to the game's lack of popularity. After a \\"somber\\" display of the game at Evo 2016, Capcom and its community of fans worked to get Marvel vs Capcom back in the spotlights, resulting the Curleh Circuit, a series of fighting game events Final Round is part of. Final Round also hosted the first tournament of the 2017 Capcom Pro Tour, and thus kicked off the second season for Street Fighter V. The tournament attracted a large variation of international talent - among which Fuudo, Yusuke Momochi, and Capcom Cup 2016 champion NuckleDu - as its winner would take a sizable advantage for the rest of the season. Final Round 20 was the first major event to hold a For Honor tournament. Competitors played Ubisoft's open world fighting game, which was released one month prior, in two-versus-two matches. Street Fighter V tournament summary Final Round 20 continued the rivalry between Joshua \\"Wolfkrone\\" Philpot and Kenneth \\"KBrad\\" Bradley, which started at Frosty Faustings two months earlier when Wolfkrone harshly taunted KBrad after winning 2‚Äì1. Both players had won their respective pools when they met in the winner's bracket of the top 64. KBrad defeated Wolfkrone 2‚Äì0, not losing a single round during their matches, followed by KBRad literally putting his head inches in front of his opponent's face while the crowd went wild. KBrad eventually took fourth place in the finals, while, Wolfkrone came in at 13. The top 8 featured a larger variation of characters than usual, as the metagame was still catching up with the gameplay changes of the new season. Three players made a comeback by finishing in the top 8, two of them being Hiromiki \\"Itabashi Zangief\\" Kumada and Gustavo \\"801 Strider\\" Romero. The third was Kun Xian Ho, who dominated the tournament with Ibuki and defeated Fuudo's R. Mika in the grand finals. Xian became known for playing the low- tier character F.A.N.G., having told Compete that he \\"never think[s] about high or low tier [but instead] like[s] playing characters that look cool and hype.\\" When Ibuki was introduced in Street Fighter V around the end of the 2016 Capcom Pro Tour, Xian was looking to change his game, noting that he \\"had some matchups I just couldn't figure out.\\" Some fans have speculated that Xian was only able to win the stacked tournament by switching to a mid-tier character. BlazBlue upset During the pool play finals of Final Round 20's BlazBlue: Central Fiction tournament, low-seeded player Glyn \\"Doza\\" Mendoza defeated top-seeded Japanese player and Evo 2014 finalist Ryo \\"Dogura\\" Nozaki. When Dogura offered Doza a handshake, Doza initially turned it down, thinking their winners finals set was supposed to go to three wins rather than two. After asking tournament organizers for confirmation multiple times, Doza jumped out of his chair, enthusiastically celebrated with his friends, and accepted Dogura's handshake. Video footage of this scene went viral. Dogura went on to win the tournament, while Doza landed on fifth place.

M. Martin, she co-authored Social Class and Educational Opportunity (1956). Her next book was Education, Economy, and Society: A Reader in the Sociology of Education (1961), co- authored with Halsey and . Social Class and Educational Opportunity gave evidence that the 11-plus exam for grammar school entrance was unfair for working-class children. Floud wrote that \\"within wide limits, the educability of children is determined by the subtle interaction of the social influences of home and school\\". Their findings started a long debate on the value and fairness of the 11-plus exam. Academic posts In 1962 Floud was appointed as the second female Fellow of Nuffield College, Oxford (1962‚Äì72). She was made an Honorary Fellow at Nuffield in 1983.

Shabazz was a minister and spiritual leader of thousands of Muslims in Newark and Jersey City and had been a member of the Nation of Islam, or Black Muslims, for more than 30 years. He was murdered in the driveway to his home in September, 1973.  Personal life  Shabazz was originally from Southern Pines, North Carolina and was the father of 13 children.  NOI  Shabazz was the head of Muslim Mosque No. 25 in Newark and in Jersey City at the time of his murder.  Murder  Shabazz was shot several times in the face while opening the door of his 1973 Cadillac in the driveway of his South Seventh Avenue home in Newark. Two gunmen ran off on foot. Police reports indicated that was a power struggle among the Black Muslims and discontent due to several Muslims being recently disbarred from membership.  Funeral  Shabazz's funeral at Mosque No. 25 was attended by over 3,000 people.  Related incidents  McGregors murder was one of three related incidents within a year that involved Black Muslims. The Hanafi Murder and the murder of Major Coxson being the other two. Police believed the killing was motivated by internal strife. After the murder, three reportedly Black Muslims, abducted an off‚Äêduty policeman from the street near Mr. Shabazz's home. He was driven around in a car, questioned him about Mr. Shabazz, and released. They were arrested later that day and were charged with kidnapping. The day following the kidnapping and release of the police officer, a black man was abducted nearby, driven around in a car for 24 hours, questioned about the Shabazz murder, and released. A Chicago Tribune article reported, \\"Internal disputes, including burning of mosques, have characterized the Black Muslims, also known as the Nation of Islam during the last decade. Some of the dissent has been between supporters of Elijah Muhammad, of Chicago and those who think it is time to replace the 75-year old leader of the sect which preaches racial separation. Previously another racial separatist group known as the Black Nationalists rivaled the [Black] Muslims for control of New York during the mid-1960s.\\" On October 18, 1973, two decapitated bodies of Warren Marcell and Michael A.

Sources within the police told the Chicago Tribune, \\"they suspected the deaths were linked to a violent internal struggle within the Muslims. Twin brothers, Roger and Ralph Banston were killed one month earlier on September 18. A prison brawl occurred in October 1975 that involved 4 people from the New World of Islam that were serving life sentences for the murder. One prisoner was killed and six were stabbed with sharpened chisels.

We live in a connected world. An estimated 40% of the world‚Äôs population now uses the internet and this number is growing at a remarkable rate. While there are significant variations in internet connectivity among countries and regions, the number of households with such links in the global South has now overtaken those in the global North. Moreover, over 70% of mobile telephone subscriptions worldwide are now in the global South. Five billion people are expected to go from no to full connectivity within the next twenty years. However, there are still significant gaps among countries and regions, for example between urban and rural areas. Limited broadband speed and lack of connectivity hamper access to knowledge, participation in society and economic development. The internet has transformed how people access information and knowledge, how they interact, and the direction of public management and business. Digital connectivity holds promise for gains in health, education, communication, leisure and well- being. Artificial intelligence advances, 3D printers, holographic recreation, instant transcription, voice-recognition and gesture-recognition software are only some examples of what is being tested. Digital technologies are reshaping human activity from daily life to international relations, from work to leisure, redefining multiple aspects of our private and public life. Such technologies have expanded opportunities for freedom of expression and for social, civic and political mobilization, but they also raise important concerns. The availability of personal information in the cyber world, for example, brings up significant issues of privacy and security. New spaces for communication and socialization are transforming what constitutes the idea of ‚Äòsocial‚Äô and they require enforceable legal and other safeguards to prevent their overuse, abuse and misuse. Examples of such misuse of the internet, mobile technology and social media range from cyber-bullying to criminal activity, even to terrorism. In this new cyber world, educators need to better prepare new generations of ‚Äòdigital natives‚Äô to deal with the ethical and social dimensions of not only existing digital technologies but also those yet to be invented. Education and internet are interrelated to each other.In pandemic time of 2020 online class are very important for students study for that online class internet has help a lot we can any information regarding our subject in internet Education and technology in developing countries The OLPC laptop being introduced to children in Haiti Technology plays an increasingly significant role in improving access to education for people living in impoverished areas and developing countries. Educational technology is not merely a matter of education and technology alone but is also about the societal culture wherein that educational technology is implemented. Charities like One Laptop per Child are dedicated to providing infrastructures through which the disadvantaged may access educational materials. According to one article, technology in developing countries is mostly limited, but some countries do have new advances in terms of pro-technology policies and biotechnology developments. One position effect of improving technology in developing countries is less dependence of developing countries on developed countries' exports of goods or technology. Developing infrastructures, promoting entrepreneurship, and formulating more open policies to technology are all somewhat effective ways of improving education and economies of developing countries. The OLPC foundation, a group out of MIT Media Lab and supported by several major corporations, has a stated mission to develop a $100 laptop for delivering educational software. The laptops were widely available as of 2008. They are sold at cost or given away based on donations. In Africa, the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) has launched an \\"e-school program\\" to provide all 600,000 primary and high schools with computer equipment, learning materials and internet access within 10 years. An International Development Agency project called nabuur.com, started with the support of former American President Bill Clinton, uses the Internet to allow co-operation by individuals on issues of social development. India is developing technologies that will bypass land-based telephone and Internet infrastructure to deliver distance learning directly to its students. In 2004, the Indian Space Research Organisation launched EDUSAT, a communications satellite providing access to educational materials that can reach more of the country's population at a greatly reduced cost. Educational tech (EdTech), mostly, information and communication technology can address issues, such as, an absent school teacher by conveying better lessons, preparing instructors and motivating students. In this generation, the price of educational technology has fallen to the point where EdTech is easily accessible even in generally poor nations. Tablets cost as low as $28 and India has the least expensive data plans on the planet. With less expensive data plans new companies such as ExtraClass has come into light which aims to provide affordable education to 260million school students in India. The OETC Consortium is composed of educational organizations, joined under a common conviction that everybody has access to technology for extraordinary learning. Together, these establishments employ a solid negotiating voice with the goal that each of the 1,000 individuals from OETC, can provide the educational technology to all students that deserve.  Technology Effects on Education  The key job that innovation needs to play in education is proportional access to a portion of the core tools that can make an important effect in the lives of both instructors and students. Some important themes can be identified to create worldwide techniques to help advancements that match the particular needs of a developing society. Some of the significant topics is to guarantee that students have access to the correct learning material, particularly in their own dialects since it guarantees a better comprehension of subjects. An AI-based tutoring system, Education Dominance, was put into an entry-level IT school in Pensacola by the U.S. Navy. This system relates to a human tutor in which the student's progress is monitored while providing individual assessments. According to the Navy, the students that worked with the digital tutoring system consistently performed better on the tests than did the students who did not use the digital tutor. The adaptive technology appears to affect students positively because it can assist individuals that have different learning skills than others and therefore better equipped to learn on their own. Technology programs that are already being used in education fields: Tablets, such as google chrome book, where students can access a range of google's educational software. DreamBox, Zearn, and ST Math, are math software programs that adapt to students as they learn.  Controversy  We are designing technologies to address different challenges in topics such as education, health and global poverty, But we can still identify cases in which this is not working or the results achieved are far away from the expectations. Kentaro Toyama, in his book Geek Heresy mentions examples in which this happen. He highlights the cases of computers in Bangalore that are locked away because teachers don't know what to do with them and mobile phone apps meant to spread hygiene practices and fail to improve health in Africa. Moreover, these past decades we experienced huge improvements in technology which have done little to turn rising poverty and inequalities, even in developed countries like United States. In addition to this, an interesting example is the one found by the economist Ana Santiago and her colleagues at the Inter-American Development Bank which conclude no educational advantage in a One Laptop per Child program in Peru. Another team of researchers found similar results in Uruguay, and concluded: \\"Our findings confirm that the technology alone cannot impact learning\\".

Vishal Vashishtha and Madirakshi Mundle play the lead roles. Plot Love stories of Jat tribe, like Heer Ranjha, Sohni Mahiwal and Mirza Sahiban are considered legendary for showcasing the passion, the pain and the eventual separation of lovers. But this very notion of unhappy endings is what the protagonist Bittu disagrees with. Representing the rebellious nature of today's youth, he wants to change the popular belief with his own, that every love story must have a happy ending only. While on the other side of the spectrum is Munni, who lives in the shadows of her brothers. A life which is highly protected, make believe and devoid of any men. When the path of the typical independent carefree fearless Jat boy Bittu crosses with timid and shy Jat girl Munni, there is bound to be firework, thus making Jaat Ki Jugni, a Visphotak Prem Kahani (an explosive love story).

Neuroanatomical organization The MLR was first described by Shik and colleagues in 1966 when they observed that electrical stimulation of a region of the midbrain in decerebrate cats produced walking and running behavior on a treadmill. Twenty-eight years later, Masdeu and colleagues described the presence of a MLR in humans. It is now widely acknowledged that, along with other motor control centers of the brain, the MLR plays an active role in initiating and modulating the spinal neural circuitry to control posture and gait. Anatomically, as the name suggests, the MLR is located in the mesencephalon (or midbrain), ventral to the inferior colliculus and near the cuneiform nucleus. Although identifying the exact anatomical substrates of the MLR has been subject to considerable debate, the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN), cuneiform nucleus, and midbrain extrapyramidal area are thought to form the neuroanatomical basis of the MLR. Nuclei within the MLR receive inputs from the substantia nigra of the basal ganglia and neural centers within the limbic system. Projections from the MLR descend via the medullary and pontine reticulospinal tracts to act on spinal motor neurons supplying the trunk and proximal limb flexors and extensors. The PPN within the MLR is composed of a diverse population of neurons containing the neurotransmitters gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA), glutamate, and acetylcholine (ACh). Results from animal and clinical studies suggest that cholinergic neurons in the PPN play a crucial role in modulating both the rhythm of locomotion and postural muscle tone. Glutamatergic and cholinergic inputs from the MLR may be responsible for regulating the excitability of reticulospinal neurons that in turn project to spinal central pattern generators to initiate stepping. Clinical significance The integration of motor and sensory information during walking involves communication between cortical, subcortical, and spinal circuits. Step-like motor patterns of the lower extremities can be induced through activation of the spinal circuitry alone; however, supraspinal input is necessary for functional bipedal walking in humans. Pathologies of the nuclei within the MLR have been associated with a combination of clinical features that are unique to midbrain dysfunction and can be differentiated from other subcortical neurological conditions such as those associated with Parkinsonism and cerebellar lesions. In a clinical case series, three adult males with isolated lesions of the MLR presented with gait hesitation and gait ataxia characterized by stepping that lacked uniform direction, amplitude, and rhythmicity. Although gait hesitation and ataxia are also clinical features of Parkinson's disease and lesions of the cerebellum, respectively, the authors noted that the patients did not display any other common signs or symptoms associated with these neurological conditions, suggesting that pathologies of the midbrain can produce gait disturbances even when cerebellar and basal ganglia function are intact. In a study investigating high-level gait and balance disorders in elderly adults who had no evidence of rheumatologic, orthopedic, or neurologic disease, brain imaging data revealed an association between reduced gray matter density of the PPN and cuneiform nucleus and impaired gait initiation, step execution, and postural control. Additionally, among eighteen individuals with Parkinson's disease who either did or did not experience Freezing of Gait, functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed reduced activity in the MLR and supplementary motor area among those individuals who experienced episodic gait hesitation. Freezing of Gait has also been associated with functional reorganization of supraspinal locomotor networks whereby altered connectivity and communication between the supplementary motor area and MLR were observed. These findings suggest that the MLR does in fact play a unique role in human locomotion, especially with respect to step initiation and motor planning. =Deep brain stimulation= Given the role of the MLR in gait initiation and postural control, researchers and clinicians have investigated the effects of targeted deep brain stimulation (DBS) on gait disturbances in clinical populations. Plaha and Gill reported significant improvements in gait dysfunction and postural instability in two patients with advanced Parkinson's disease who were treated using DBS electrodes implanted in the region of the PPN. Likewise, in a more recent study, six patients with Parkinson's disease demonstrated improvements in posture, gait, and postural stability following 6 months of DBS to the PPN and subthalamic nucleus. Bachmann and colleagues applied DBS to the MLR in rats with chronic, incomplete spinal cord injury and reported improved hindlimb function and near normal restoration of locomotor function following treatment.

The film's sets were designed by Don Russell, although a number of the scenes were shot on location. The screenplay, written by T.J. Morrison and Arthur Reid, was based on a 1939 radio play by Patrick Hamilton, who had been encouraged to write the story as part of a government road safety campaign. Hamilton had himself been knocked down by a drunk driver. The story was updated slightly, and represents the post-war malaise with the use of noirish sequences.Hutchings p.44-45 After making the film Fisher graduated to directing several more expensive productions for Gainsborough Pictures. Synopsis While having a quiet drink together in a road house, a young working-class couple Fred and Nancy fall into the company of two raffish motorists including the self-confident Captain Cole. After a game of billiards and a number of drinks, they drive out on the road. While spreeding along in the dark they hit what they think to be a man on a bicycle. Although Fred wants to stop, Captain Cole insists on driving on. Nancy takes Cole's side and begins taunting Fred, who eventually manages to escape and raise the alarm. A police investigation reveals that nobody had been injured in the collision with the bike, which had belonged to a poacher who didn't report the accident. In the meantime, Cole, Nancy and the other passenger have suffered a crash of their own while drunken speeding, killing all three of them.

As a self-taught painter, his work was exhibited internationally. He was the author of several books, including collections of essays and novels. He was also a contributor to France Culture. A communist-turned-libertarian, he was a co-founder of Coop√©rative des Malassis, an anti-consumerist artists' collective. He was best known for The Red Men, a series of figurative paintings depicting aspects of the Cold War like the May 1968 events, the Vietnam War and Red Scare, and his 150 still lifes, or \\"portraits,\\" of potatoes. Early life Henri Cueco was born on 19 October 1929 in Uzerche, Corr√®ze, a rural part of France. His father, Vicente Cueco, was an immigrant from Spain. His mother was French. He was essentially self-taught, though his father also taught him how to paint from the age of 13. Career Cueco began his career as a landscape painter in the 1950s. He became a figurative painter, associated with the school of in 1960s. His artwork was political, and he was a critic of materialism and minimalism. He did paintings of hunting dogs and snakes, followed by 150 still lifes, or \\"portraits,\\" of potatoes. In 1969‚Äì1970, Cueco co-founded an artists collective called Coop√©rative des Malassis with Lucien Fleury, Jean-Claude Latil, Michel Parr√© and G√©rard Tisserand. Together, they designed a politically satirical fresco called Le Grand M√©choui in 1972. They designed Qui tue ? ou l‚Äôaffaire Gabrielle Russier in 1973. They also designed Radeau de la M√©duse ou la D√©rive de la soci√©t√©, a decor on consumerism in the Grand'Place, Grenoble, in 1973‚Äì1975. They designed Les affaires reprennent in 1977. His work was first exhibited at the Salon de la Jeune peinture, followed by the Atelier populaire. In 1970, he exhibited The Red Men, a series of paintings on the Cold War (including the May 1968 events, the Vietnam War and the Red Scare), at the Mus√©e d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris. In 1986, when he exhibited an irreverent portrait of Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud and Mao Zedong in Beijing, China, he was asked to take it down. The painting included the following quotation by Henri Jeanson: \\"Capitalism is the exploitation of men by men. Communism? It is the opposite.\\" In 1997, Cueco exhibited paintings inspired by Nicolas Poussin and Philippe de Champaigne at the Centre d'art contemporain in Meymac. In 2010, he exhibited nudes in the manner of Ingres at the Mus√©e Ingres in Montauban. He exhibited his work at the Mus√©e d'art et d'arch√©ologie du P√©rigord in 2014, when he was the guest of honour at the Expo√©sie Festival. His last exhibition was held at La Maison Rouge in February 2017. Cueco was the founder of the Association Pays Paysage in Uzerche. He was a contributor to the French radio station France Culture, especially its programmes called Les Papous dans la t√™te and Les D√©craqu√©s. He was the author of several books, including novels and collections of essays. One of his novels was made into a 2007 film directed by Jean Becker, Conversations with My Gardener. Cueco was an avid reader of Marxist texts. He was member of the French Communist Party from 1956 to 1976. He also joined the General Confederation of Labour (CGT), one of the main labour unions in France. With Ernest Pignon-Ernest, he co- founded the Syndicat national des artistes plasticiens CGT in 1977. However, by the 1980s, he had become a libertarian. Personal life and death Cueco had a wife, , and a son, , a professional zarb player. He resided between Vigeois in his native Corr√®ze and Paris. Cueco died of a kidney infection but was weakened by Alzheimer's disease on 13 March 2017 in Paris. He was 87.

The technology is used to reduce the use of drinking water and primary energy consumption for water heating. By lowering the (household) hot water demand, water recycling showers also allow for smaller heating appliances, like boilers, solar water heating systems and other HVAC solutions.  History  The first recycling shower, operated by a hand pump, was patented in England in 1767 by the stove maker William Feetham. This recycling shower used the pump to push the water into a basin above the user's head. To receive the water, the user pulled a chain to release the water from the basin. Like this, the invention would recycle the same dirty water during the entire session. It also gradually lost temperature. It was not until 200 years later, in 1979, that Billy G. Bloys invented a motorized version of the same concept, discarding the hand pump. Using no filtration or a means of re-heating the water, the contraption likened the original invention by Feetham but did not improve on it beyond the electronic pump and some fixtures. It was never commercialized. In 1988, Francis R. Keeler patented a similar but smaller and more mobile version of the recycling shower for usage in motor homes, boats and airplanes. In 2011, Nick Christy of Australia won the Postcode Lottery Green Challenge, an annual competition for sustainable ideas for his version of the water recycling shower. The shower aimed to collect, filter, pasteurize and then dilute the water with fresh tap water to cool it again to the set temperature. Citing cultural problems and lack of traction in his native Australia, Christy aimed for the UK market. They are yet to collect certification standards. In 2013, the Swedish company Orbital Systems introduces their first shower, the launching company being a spinoff from a NASA internship. It comprises a closed-loop system where the water is purified using a replaceable filter. These filter out particulate matter and microbes from drain water before sending the water back through the head. After the capsules have been depleted, they have to be replaced at cost. Orbital Systems has had several high-profile investors, including Skype and Kazaa co-founder Niklas Zennstr√∂m and Karl-Johan Persson, CEO of the fashion company H&M.; In 2015, the Dutch company Hamwells introduced the e-Shower at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in London. Citing hygiene issues in earlier solutions, Hamwells opted for a solution with a semi-closed loop where the water is used several times instead of the entire session. External hot water is used to maintain temperature, with incoming hot water replacing the used water within the loop. In addition to replacement, water within the loop is filtered and purified with UV light. For users unable or unwilling to use the recycling mode, the e-Shower offers a classic shower where all the water is drained. Being a computer, the e-Shower is able to self-clean, regulate shower times between users and offer the user music streaming and remote control through mobile apps.  Benefits  Water recycling showers have been explored by people who wish to conserve water and the energy needed to heat the water, for both environmental and economic reasons. = Energy savings = According to the U.S. Department of Energy, water heating is typically the second- largest energy expense in homes (after space heating). Mostly destined for the shower, it accounts for roughly 17% of total household energy consumption. Energy efficiency was the main driver behind the federal regulation, mandating the top flow of a shower head to be restricted to 2.5 gallons per minute. Manufacturers of recycling showers typically claim a 70% to 90% reduction in shower energy consumption. = Water savings = Nearly 1.2 trillion gallons of water is used in the United States annually just for showering. This is enough to supply the water needs of New York and New Jersey for a year. Manufacturers of recycling showers typically claim an 80% to 90% reduction in shower water consumption. Also, before the shower reaches the set temperature, users leave the tap running. Typically 20 percent of every shower session is essentially lost this way. = Comfort increase = A typical shower delivers 9.5 liters per minute (2.5 gallons per minute). Scientific studies that monitored hundreds of homes across the nation have shown that flow rates have little influence on the duration of the shower.

(This was Id's Raven engine, licensed to Raven Software for their 1993 game ShadowCaster.) Mind Shear agreed enthusiastically, expecting that they would be working on a nearly complete Doom engine. Only after contracts were signed and development was underway did they discover just how buggy and incomplete the codebase was. Problems with lag, jerky animation, and slow rendering plagued the project right up until a significantly delayed release. The game was re-released under the name Assassinators by Memorex Software in 1998. After years of non-availability, the game and its source code were released as non-commercial freeware by the programmer around 2014.Greed on redshadowsoftware.com \\"These sources are provided for educational and historical purposes. No assets or code may be used in any way commercially. Personal and educational use only.\\" (2014) Reception Reception of the game by press and gamers was mostly unimpressed to negative. However, some game aspects like curved surfaces, the \\"rear mirror\\" mechanic, and the colorful protagonists were positively mentioned.The Technology Behind ID's Games on slashdot.com by Sean Clifford \\"Softdisk tried to produce a couple of games, one called Greed (later In Pursuit of Greed) which was basically a 3D Doom-clone shooter. There was some neat technology (e.g. curved surfaces), but the art was...uh, well weak. The gameplay was decent, but there were some bugs to stomp and the ship date slipped...and slipped...and slipped. It was released, but didn't live up to the hype. The game was torn to shreds in the reviews.\\" (August 13, 2002) Also the soundtrack, done by Andrew Sega, was positively noted. The game was not the hoped for commercial success due to the technical problems with the unfinished engine and the competing high-profile title Duke Nukem 3D, released shortly before Greed, which lead all to a cool reception from the press and the public alike. The game was reviewed with 59/100 in the PC Gamer August 1996 issue, stating \\"The Doom frenzy breeds another strange offspring, where mercenary cows, lizards, and cyborgs kill for sport. It's all pretty forgettable.\\".PC Gamer 1996-08 by T.

While living in Rome, she and her husband, George Washington Wurts, created an art collection containing approximately 3,000 works that was donated on her death in 1933 to Benito Mussolini. The art collection remains in Rome, and their villa and gardens are open to the public.  Early life  Henrietta Tower was the last of seven children of Charlemagne Tower, a lawyer, businessman, and graduate of Harvard University. On her father‚Äôs death in 1889, Tower inherited a vast fortune from his business ventures which included a coal mining operation in Pennsylvania and an iron production plant in Minnesota. This inheritance made her one of the wealthiest women in the United States at that time.  Life in Rome and art collection  Villa Sciarra in Rome Tower married George Washington Wurts in 1898. In 1902 the couple moved to Rome and bought a villa, known as the Villa Sciarra-Wurts, which they spent the rest of their lives renovating and decorating with a variety of art works. They frequently entertained the wealthy, ambassadors, and aristocratic members of society. After her husband‚Äôs death in 1928 Tower gave their villa to the city of Rome on the condition that the vast garden be turned into a public park and cultural center in honor of the German poet, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. (Included with this was a gift of $50,000 to maintain the property.) The park so dedicated was opened in 1932 and a year later, in 1933, Tower died in Lucerne, Switzerland and is buried in the Protestant cemetery in Rome. Through her will Tower bequeathed the vast art collection that she and her husband had expanded over several decades to Benito Mussolini, on the condition that it be kept in a museum. The collection was given to Rome's Museo nazionale del Palazzo di Venezia where it has remained since (although several works remain in the Villa Sciarra-Wurts). Included in the collection are over 3,000 items including: ceramics, textiles, tapestries, paintings (including works by Ottaviano Nelli, Vincenzo Pagani, John Russell, Paolo Veneziano, and Michael Wolgemut), about 80 wooden sculptures, various works from China and Japan, and a significant number of works from Russia including 33 late 19th-century women's hats. Tower‚Äôs will also established The Henrietta Tower Wurts Foundation in Philadelphia which in addition to funding Meals on Wheels also provides small grants to ‚Äúorganizations serving disadvantaged children and youth and/or the elderly‚Äù.

As of December 1894, he was serving as President of the New York City Board of Health as well. Career When the New York Mining Stock Exchange and the National Petroleum Exchange were consolidated in 1883 into the Consolidated Stock and Petroleum Exchange of New York, Charles G. Wilson was elected president and held the office until 1900. In 1890, he was appointed president of the New York City Board of Health, and as president, by September 1892 he was handling a cholera outbreak in New York City. As of December 1894, he was serving as both president of the Board of Health as well as President of the Consolidated Exchange. After re-appointment by the mayor, he kept his position at the health board until 1898. At the annual Consolidated Stock Exchange election on June 11, 1900, Mortimer H. Wagar defeated Wilson for the presidency of the Consolidated Stock and Petroleum Exchange. According to The New York Times, \\"the contest was the most closely fought in the history of the Exchange, the total number of votes cast being 793. The largest vote ever polled in a previous election was 628.\\" After Wilson's fifteen years as president, Wagar took over in 1900 with \\"a large majority of the members\\" supporting him, having polled 504 votes to 287. On May 29, 1902, he sent a letter to the editor of the Times, clarifying that he was not in fact in opposition to the then present administration of the Exchange, as reported prior. Personal life As of 1894, he had apartments in Chelsea at 23rd Street. He was the stepfather of Mrs. A. E. Kofoed, who disappeared from her home in August 1899. Wilson asserted that she might have been kidnapped, as compared to suicide. His wife, Augusta J. Wilson, died on November 21, 1904. The funeral was held at her home on 94th Street in New York. On February 9, 1929, Charles G. Wilson married Helen L. Carmichel, daughter of Wiliam Carmichel of New York. Afterwards, the couple returned to Boston, where Wilson was active with the Founders Security Trust Company. See also *William S.

Hashimoto is currently ranked first in the lightweight division. Hashimoto rose to prominence by becoming national champion at the All-Japan Judo Championships in 2015. He then became one of the lightweight division's top judokas by winning five tournaments consecutively, spanning from the World Masters to the Grand Slam Tokyo and Paris. He is known for his dynamic style of judo and strong groundwork. Career =2015 Grand Prix Qingdao= Hashimoto's first opponent in Qingdao was Bang Gui-man of Korea. It was a heavy fight for grips, with many penalties on both sides. However, despite both being level with three shidos each, Bang was penalised for the fourth time and awarded hansoku make, bringing Hashimoto through to his second fight. He then faced American Nicholas Delpopolo, in a relatively equal match, with only a yuko separating them when Hashimoto attacked with an osoto gari. Even though the throw was relegated from ippon, it was enough to send the Japanese to the quarter-final. Hashimoto made short work of his opponent, Italian Enrico Parlati, pressuring the latter to be penalised for a false attack with a drop seoi nage in the early seconds of the fight. Hashimoto then threw Parlati with a seoi nage for ippon in just 30 seconds. He again showed a masterclass in the semi-final against Giyosjon Boboev of Uzbekistan, again pressuring the latter to make a false attack with a drop seoi nage just 12 seconds in. Hashimoto unsuccessfully attempted a drop seoi otoshi, however he managed to bring the fight to the ground. He finished the fight by ippon with a signature juji gatame. In the final, Hashimoto was against top-ranked Rustam Orujov. He scored ippon with a seoi nage in a little over a minute, winning the tournament's gold medal. =Rise to prominence: Undefeated run since 2016 till 2018= 2016 Masters Guadalajara At the invitation-only Masters, Hashimoto faced Sainjargalyn Nyam-Ochir in his first fight. It was a smaller group of fighters as the event was only months away from the 2016 Olympics. The bout was shido-filled, both fighters having been penalised for false attacks and passivity. However, Hashimoto pulled through when Sainjargalyn was penalised with a third shido. He then faced Israeli Sagi Muki, in another tight, shido-dominated fight. Over two minutes into the bout, Hashimoto scored a wazaari with an osoto gari. Despite being penalised for avoiding grip twice following the score, he was through to the semi-finals as Muki failed to score. Hashimoto was against rival Orujov for a place in the final. Another tactical fight ensued, with only a shido separating them. Hashimoto's opponent for the gold medal was Ganbaataryn Odbayar. He showed a newaza masterclass with an unusual juji-gatame for ippon. IJF commentators remarked that the armbar was reminiscent of Brazilian jiu-jitsu than judo. They speculate that Hashimoto had trained in BJJ. 2016 Grand Slam Tokyo Hashimoto was against Lee Fengmao of Taiwan in Round 2. He caught Lee with an ippon seoi nage a minute and a half into the fight, and scored wazaari. He then connected to a yoko shiho gatame for ippon. In the following fight, he faced Boboev who was ready for a tactical battle. Hashimoto succeeded when Boboev picked up a second shido for passivity. Hashimoto carried on with a tactical strategy as he went against countryman Arata Tatsukawa in the semi-final. He also won by a single shido, controlling the grips and causing Tatsukawa to be defensive. The final was set against Takeshi Doi in another level fight. Doi tried to bring the fight to the ground in the opening moments of the bout, and fought with a lasso guard as Hashimoto remained in a stand-up stance while attempting osaekomi. He then managed to break Doi's guard as Doi rolled to his front, which Hashimoto followed with an unsuccessful juji gatame attempt. The fight then varied between newaza and fighting for grips. Doi then lost the final by stepping outside the tatami, giving the gold medal to Hashimoto.

His has empirically investigated \\"the Korean Peoples' identity & their mass-psychology\\" by connecting it to a variety of issues such as self, online world identity, consumption behavior, love & relationships, power desire and political decision making. He has mainly researched the different psychological types of people and how the human mind works in on and offline settings. His most well-known projects are WPI (Whang's Personality Inventory), research on the identities of online game players, and research on politicians' public images. Whang has been a professor at Sejong University from 1994-1997 and at Yonsei University from 1994-2016. In January 2016, he was dismissed from his position as a tenured professor at Yonsei University, by excuse of violating an ethical rule, 'having a job outside of professorship without the permission of the university president.' There is controversy and speculation surrounding his dismissal. The unusual dismissal of a tenured professor from his position was a retaliatory decision made because of Whang's criticism against Geun-hye Park, the 11th President of South Korea. She was later impeached and dismissed from the presidency. Whang's dismissal was planned and executed by the late president of Yonsei University, Gap Young Cheung who denied his involvement of this case as a president of university. The late president Gap Young Cheung had a strong reputation that he had wished to hold a government or Blue House position during Ms. Park's presidency. After the impeachment of Ms. Park, Cheung retired from the university and remained as an honorary professor. Whang's dismissal is appreciated as an example of an evidence of latent oppression on academia by power. Dr. Whang currently runs a podcast WhangShimSo, where he provides free consultations on personal and career conflicts, and commentates on the diverse social issues in Korean Society.  Early life and family  He was born as a second child in the town of Jinhae, and lived there until he was 9 years old when his parents decided to move to the bigger city of Pusan for the opportunity to better educate their children. He has said the thought ‚ÄúI need to do well academically in ordered to be treated like a person‚Äù was a motivating factor in his youth to study hard. In an interview with Chosun Ilbo, he recalled ‚ÄúOnce I received grades that put me in 25th place in class and the kids who used to ask me questions during recess stopped asking me any questions. They would not even reply when I said something. What was even more surprising was that kids who were known to be physically dominant in the class started bothering me. It was strange. So I came in 2nd place in class on the next test. The teacher told me to stop playing with grades. And the other kids treated me normally again. This led me to think that in Korean society I need to do well academically in order to be treated properly as a person even before having any idea of what I really want to do.‚Äù  Education and academic career  = College = In the spring of 1981, Whang was admitted into Seoul National University's Social Sciences department. He himself has said it was pure coincidence that he came to major in Psychology. He initially went to the Social Sciences department in order to become a diplomat, but started to rethink his path after spending his first year of college drinking. It was overwhelming for him to consider majoring in Sociology only to be living in and out of jail afterwards due to the political oppression at the time. He did not want to live as a person who had to tout himself for someone or something. He chose psychology because he thought he could quietly study human behavior in a lab instead of having to go on expeditions into remote areas if he had chosen anthropology. In his second- year of college, he was selected as a scholarship recipient of The Korea Foundation for Advanced Studies and received 50,000 won ($50) per month, an event from which he gained hope and confidence to study abroad and pursue the path of a scholar, which he used to assume would be difficult. He was determined to go to America and become B.F. Skinner's student after reading Walden II. = Graduate school = After receiving his BA in psychology in 1985, Sang Min Whang continued his studies at East Graduate School under professor Bong Yeon Suh's guidance. And in September 1986, he received a scholarship from The Korea Foundation for Advanced Studies to study Social Cognitive Development under Sheldon White's guidance in Harvard University's psychology doctorate program. The question that continues to be repeated in Sang Min Whang's work since his graduate school days can be summarized as follows: \\"How are peoples' minds living in a particular society or culture expressed in different ways for each individual?\\" His doctoral dissertation \\"The Organization of Everyday Places and their Dimensional Features: The Priming Effect of Dimensions on the Congruence of Place and Behavior\\" explored what kind of conceptions people had of everyday places, how the psychological meaning people attribute to places can be measured, and whether the measured results came from absolute characteristics of places or were results of peoples‚Äô responses to places. In this study, he employed non-parametric statistical analysis, which unlike parametric statistical analysis that presumes a few set patterns exist, uses data to find an unknown pattern. Since his postdoctoral fellowship, Sang Min Whang focused on the ‚Äúhuman mind that operates in the Internet.‚Äù Under the guidance of Rob Kling at University of California, Irvine, he started research on the mind in the PC network environment and was a pioneer in early research on the virtual world. He accurately predicted that shopping and other real life activities will occur over the Internet and classified the characteristics of the type of person who first finds new electronic products and the characteristics of the consumer that spreads the use of new electronic products. (Refer to \\"Digital Freaks Decide Future Consumption\\") = Academic career and research = In his life as a researcher, Sang Min Whang delved into the subject of the ‚Äúself,‚Äù especially ‚Äúidentification and respect for an individual‚Äôs disposition‚Äù based on the study of ‚ÄúKorean Peoples‚Äô Identity.‚Äù In particular, he researched the relationship between ‚Äúthe self oneself perceives‚Äù and ‚Äúthe self others perceive,‚Äù or the ‚Äúreal self‚Äù and the ‚Äúideal self‚Äù Koreans experience and build in various aspects by connecting it to specific fields in education, development, politics, marketing, etc. He especially asserts that instead of the medical model that defines a student or a child's particular behavior as a ‚Äúproblem‚Äù and tries to solve it, the ‚Äúdevelopmental perspective,‚Äù which helps a student or a child understand herself by diagnosing and understanding each individual's character and the meaning each individual attributes to her actions, needs to be applied to education and psychotherapy. He rejected mainstream psychology that looks for the ‚Äúaverage‚Äù among people and tried to define the different individual characteristics expressed in a cultural or societal setting and measure these ‚Äúunknown concepts‚Äù using MDS (Multidimensional Scaling). However, he started to feel there was a fundamental limitation to his research when it could find factors showing quantitative differences exist among individuals, but could not find each individual's characteristic that has its own attributes manifest in different ways from each other, and later used the Q Methodology to overcome this. Q Methodology Development In order to find a method that can investigate the characteristics of each individual living in a sociocultural environment instead of assuming an absolute and immutable attribute, Sang Min Whang organized a seminar called ‚ÄúWhat is Research Methodology?‚Äù with his students after starting his post in Yonsei University. One of the people invited to this seminar was Heung Gyu Kim, a former professor at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, who introduced Q Methodology to Whang. Afterwards, Whang studied the different thoughts people had from each other on various topics such as ‚ÄúInternet Psychology,‚Äù ‚ÄúFuture Electronic Products,‚Äù etc. According to Sang Min Whang, Q Methodology makes it possible to do a quantum-mechanical interpretation of the mind unlike the existing factor analysis that was being used in psychology. That is, psychology based on the existing R-technique factor analysis defines each factor as an absolute characteristic that everyone has and only differs in the extent, while Q Methodology made it possible to deduce how each factor comes together differently and manifests in different ways according to each individual in different environments. It applied the fact that like how the subject can be conscious of the observer and decide on its movements and change, an individual can be aware of her environment and her own characteristics to manifest them (Refer to Q Workshop Manual). Afterwards, Sang Min Whang felt the limitation of interpreting each factor deduced from Q Methodology analysis as one characteristic according to the traditional analysis method. This was because he thought there was a need to separate the positive, easily shown disposition and the negative or hidden disposition that both appear within a single factor instead of abstractly lumping them together. In order to overcome this limitation, he divided the statements arranged according to the weight attributed to each statement into high, middle, and low and interpreted them as each different characteristics drawn from one factor. Afterwards, the middle-ranked statement was excluded because it could not reveal a clear disposition about the relevant factor and one factor was interpreted by being divided into two extreme dispositions shown by the highest-ranked statement and lowest-ranked statement. This is the principle of ‚Äúextremes meet‚Äù being applied to Q Methodology and by interpreting one factor into two extreme dispositions, not only was it clearer how each disposition shows itself in a studied society and but it also became possible to show each characteristics‚Äô interaction with one another. In addition, by dividing one factor into two extremes, it was possible to find out in Q Methodology research that proceeds with a comparatively small number of participants not only the disposition that is easily admitted by people or accepted in a societal situation (mainstream), but also the characteristic people are reluctant to show or only a minority of people have (non- mainstream). This new interpretative method based on Q Methodology is found in a number of Sang Min Whang's research. Research on Koreans' psychology =WPI (Whang‚Äôs Personality Inventory)= Sang Min Whang thought there needs to be a tool differentiated from the western psychology tests to measure ‚ÄúKoreans‚Äô psychology‚Äù because Asians and Westerners define and think about ‚Äúthe self‚Äù in different ways. In the field of personality study, the Big 5 Theory of Personality (openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism) was already known to exist through Costa & McCrae and others‚Äô research. However, Sang Min Whang thought these five factors would combine and manifest in different ways depending on the sociocultural environment and an individual's experience and beliefs. According to the metaphor he uses frequently, it is important to know the fact that ‚Äúwhen making bread, the ingredients you need are ‚Äòflour,‚Äô ‚Äòeggs,‚Äô ‚Äòmilk,‚Äô ‚Äòyeast,‚Äô and ‚Äòbutter.‚Äô But the bread is not the ingredient. It only becomes bread when you mix the ingredients together to make the dough, proof it, put it in the oven, and bake it. Likewise, a persons‚Äô mind becomes known not by the score from individual psychological traits or factors, but only after going through a larger frame that can look at those comprehensively.‚Äù (<> He was able to classify two dimensional types, the self that yourself sees (I), and the self that others see (Me) based on Q Methodology and after constructing many statements indicating Koreans‚Äô emotion, lifestyle, and behavior pattern based on the Big 5 Theory of Personality. The way Koreans define themselves have been differentiated into 5 types: (I) Realist, Romantist, Humanist, Idealist, and Agent, and the way they define themselves using others as a medium (Me) was differentiated into these 5 types: Relation, Trust, Manual, Self, and Culture. His findings empirically proved how William James‚Äô theory that the ‚Äúself‚Äù is a combination of ‚Äúthe self that yourself thinks of (I)‚Äù and ‚Äúthe self that others see (Me)‚Äù manifests itself in a specific sociocultural setting and WPI (Whang's Personality Inventory) has been organized as a personality test that is being used in counseling and education. =WPI's 5 Types= * Realist: A realist tries to have good relationships with other people because he or she acquires his or her sense of being through others‚Äô acknowledgement. She or he is considerate of other people and caters well to others because she or he does not like big changes or conflicts, but also goes through heartache or a ‚Äúgood person complex‚Äù as a result. In any organization, if there is not a lot of conflict within it, it could be due to the work of a realist. Realists think of the organization they belong to, their wealth, and their academic pedigrees as measures they can use to gain others‚Äô recognition and they also strive for self-improvement in order to live textbook definitions of successful lives, which are decided on by the outside world. * Romantist: Romantists feel alive when they share their feelings with others. If a romantist, for whom the sharing of sensibilities and emotions are important, feels that his or her feelings are not appreciated then he or she may have a heart that is the more impoverished than anyone else even though he or she may be living an abundant life. A romantist's sensibility, delicate like a glass bead, is sometimes also expressed in an artistic sense. Additionally, when working on something new, romantists might appear to be very hesitant because they have a lot of fear and anxiety, but on the contrary, they may also appear to be meticulous and deliberate. * Humanist: Humanists acquire their sense of being through relationships with people. They are out-going, sociable and friendly. They have the ability to utilize their personal networks to solve problems. In contrast, they also show a side where they start off strong and end weak by setting up grand goals without being detailed enough and have difficulty putting in any effort for a long time to achieve said goals. They think it is a matter-of-course and natural to treat superiors with respect and to appear authoritative to subordinates. They can be confident in their ability to build relationships, but they have a hard time noticing delicate and subtle feelings. * Idealist: Idealists acquire their sense of being when they feel free and gain an understanding about the world. They seek something of their own that is different from others, which gives the impression of being idealistic, abstract, and disconnected from reality. Also, they may appear to another person to be selfish and individualistic at times because idealists are only concerned with what they‚Äôre interested in and indifferent to everything else. They prefer spending time alone and try to live independently. Idealists can change their interests frequently because they have a lot of curiosity and are creative, but it is important above all else for idealists to become immersed in one thing and build their own expertise. * Agent: Agents acquire their sense of being through their achievements. Their work is what they are and they feel a joy greater than anything else when they complete a task in the way they wanted to. They have a tendency to prioritize work above relationships and they do not like someone meddling in their work process. This is because they enjoy themselves becoming immersed in the process of their work as it progresses as they have planned. This tendency may also connect to their hobbies. If they start to approach their hobbies like it is work, they can become scarily absorbed and bring to mind the image of an obsessive-compulsive otaku (geek). Koreans‚Äô desires and \\"the Relationship between image and true self\\" In \\"The President and Louis Vuitton\\", Sang Min Whang thought (luxury good) consumption and elections clearly showed how Koreans‚Äô dress up their desires instead of saying what they want, thinking that if they choose the vaguely ‚Äúgood thing,‚Äù it will produce the results they want. When you make a decision to dress up your desire without being able to distinguish between ‚Äúwhat you really want‚Äù and ‚Äúwhat you are saying you want,‚Äù you feel ‚Äúduped‚Äù and cannot be satisfied even after spending money. On the other hand, he suggested ‚Äúthe mind‚Äôs MRI,‚Äù a development from Q Methodology, for suppliers to use as a method to diagnose the consumer's hidden desire and the desire they freely talk of in a societal setting.  Dismissal from Yonsei University and controversy  = Criticism against Geun Hye Park‚Äôs Regime and Dismissal from Yonsei University‚Äôs full professorship = In May 2015, Sang Min Whang researched the types of image the public has about the then President Geun Hye Park using Q Methodology and published his findings in the monthly magazine Shin Dong Ah with the title ‚ÄúFoolish Ruler> Face Madame >Our VIP.‚Äù According to Whang‚Äôs research, people perceived Ms. Park mainly as a ‚Äúpuppet.‚Äù The ‚Äúpuppet‚Äù image the majority of people had of Ms. Park was divided into more detailed types: foolish ruler, our VIP, and face Madame. The study simultaneously found the public expected a president with the image of a ‚Äúleading hero‚Äù as an alternative to Park. This meant the public already knew through her image that Park is incompetent and, at the same time, only a sort of ‚Äúceremonious figure‚Äù with someone else calling the shots. She was being perceived as a leader that did not have the ability to govern a nation. After publishing his ‚ÄúPresident Geun Hye Park Image‚Äù research in Shin Dong Ah magazine, Sang Min Whang was sent to Yonsei University's disciplinary committee for ‚Äúviolation of prohibition on holding a job outside of professorship and violation of prohibition on engaging in commercial activity‚Äù and the former Yonsei University president, Gap Young Cheung, who was being mentioned as a potential minister nominee in Geun Hye Park's regime, passed the dismissal motion on his last day in office on January 29, 2016. Yonsei University has claimed there is no relation between Sang Min Whang's research and the exclusionary disciplinary action and that he was removed because of ‚Äúholding concurrent offices,‚Äù but through the Soon Sil Choi affair it was proven Sang Min Whang's research predicted the hidden commander's existence. The retaliatory decision to dismiss a tenured professor, along with Yoo Ra Chung's illicit admission incident, showed that universities lost academic autonomy and became an instrument of political power. Professor Ho Geun Lee from Yonsei University, who agreed to an interview with Dong-A Ilbo newspaper, claimed that if Whang had only ‚Äúviolated the prohibition on holding a job outside of professorship and the prohibition on engaging in commercial activity‚Äù then he would not have been dismissed and implied that Whang was dismissed because he was negligent in carrying out his duties as a professor. Lee cited examples such as Whang's absence from meetings with professors, scheduling all of his courses to teach on one day during the week, and managing an outside research lab named Wisdom Center even though Whang did a lot of research. However, it was confirmed Sang Min Whang did not receive any salary or engage in any commercial activity for profit and only conducted research by accepting projects through Wisdom Center. In Korea and in the U.S., it is difficult for the excuse ‚Äúholding another office outside of professorship‚Äù to be the grounds for dismissal because many professors in both countries establish their own research labs to work more freely on research or they hold offices at companies in related areas of study. Ultimately, according to Lee's interview, Yonsei University presented the reasons that Whang was ‚Äúnegligent‚Äù because he did not attend the professor meetings and fit all of his courses into one day to remove a tenured, full professor with satisfactory research performance. This kind of measure taken by Yonsei University is one of the examples of how people who satirized Geun Hye Park were oppressed under the regime. Gap Young Cheung, who removed Sang Min Whang from Yonsei University, was one of the figures being mentioned as a nominee for the first chief of staff or the minister of economy under Geun Hye Park's regime, but he unable to take a government post. Afterwards, he tried for reappointment of Yonsei University's president, but failed after ‚Äúbeing ranked as the lowest among potential candidates on performance and qualifications in an opinion gathering session by Yonsei University faculty.‚Äù After the next term (18th) president of Yonsei University was decided to be Yong Hak Kim, the dismissal procedure for Whang progressed quickly. Gap Young Cheung signed the dismissal resolution on his last day of his president term and announced it is ‚Äúchance‚Äù that the two dates coincide. Some analyze Gap Young Cheung's removal of Sang Min Whang, who continued to maintain a critical tone of Geun Hye Park's regime on a daily basis, as a move Cheung made to become appointed to public office under Geun Hye Park's regime. However, Gap Young Cheung claimed in an interview with the press that he ‚Äúdid not know‚Äù about Sang Min Hwang's dismissal from Yonsei University's professorship and that he only followed the decision of the disciplinary committee even though he was Yonsei University's president when the dismissal process was in progress. These actions by Gap Young Cheung along with the illicit admission of Yoo Ra Chung into Ewha University is analyzed as a case of how university personnel have transformed into, not people who pursue learning, but rather agents of political power under Geun Hye Park's regime. In other instances of abuse of power, it became known Geun Hye Park's regime not only made the conglomerate CJ group discontinue the Saturday Night Live television program that satirized Geun Hye Park, but also exerted pressure on CJ group's human resources to influence management position appointments within the company. This example shows thorough vindictive punishment was carried out against people who revealed the true nature of Geun Hye Park's regime by applying ‚Äúcharges that do not have anything to do with the regime.‚Äù Like how in the dynasty era the suspicion of ‚Äúhaving taken part in a conspiracy‚Äù was cast on everyone to cause a ‚Äúpurge‚Äù to happen and was used as an excuse to punish people, in Geun Hye Park's regime where she was called the ‚Äúqueen‚Äù by the masses, the suspicion of ‚Äúhaving engaged in profit-seeking activity‚Äù that could easily incur hatred among people was used to discipline a company that could legitimately engage in profit-seeking activity and discipline a professor who had the right to freely research. The attempt to discipline Sang Min Whang in 2015 was not the first time. In 2014, he was sent to the disciplinary action committee for ‚Äúlack of research production and negligence in teaching students,‚Äù but the charge fell apart after it was revealed not to be true. This is because in 2014 when Sang Min Whang was sent to the disciplinary action committee, he did five presentations in international and domestic academic societies and published one dissertation and the book The Person That Is Me. Also, he was on the editing staff for the Journal of Human Subjectivity and was editor-in-chief of the Korean Society for the Study of Human Subjectivity. In the following year of 2015, he published \\"The New Consumer Psychology: Scanning buying behavior with MRI of the Mind\\" through Routledge, America's publishing company specializing in social sciences. In addition, when the genital scandal arose, Sung Joo Kim who was the co-chair of the Presidential Campaign Committee for Saenuri party, visited Yonsei University demanding Sang Min Whang's resignation from professorship and revealed that she was promised disciplinary action by Yonsei University. It was brought up that Sung Joo Kim may be a member of the hidden power organization called ‚Äúeight fairies‚Äù related to the Soon Sil Choi scandal, but she denied the allegation. Professor Chang Yong Kim, who asserts that he also experienced the dangers of disadvantages caused by criticizing the regime, criticized Yonsei University's actions against Whang and warned against the current danger the state of social sciences is in Korea and scholars‚Äô freedom becoming limited by saying as follows: > ‚ÄúHe was easily terminated by the so-called ‚Äúgenital‚Äù comment even though he > was a full professor who was guaranteed retirement (tenure). If you look at > it, what is wrong with this comment? It was nothing more than an ordinary > opinion, not degradation nor defamation. > After being terminated, professor Whang appeared on a TV program and > claimed, ‚ÄúI became an object of hatred after defining Geun Hye Park as a > ‚Äòfoolish ruler‚Äô and even if there was pressure to terminate me from the Blue > House because of this, the faculty council and university president should > have stepped forward acting as a shield saying it [my comment] is within > academic domain.

It was shown the image the public has of the president can be divided into 8 types through this research. The following is the body of the research explanation that was published in Shin Dong Ah. > ‚ÄúTo the public that perceives President Park as a ‚Äòfoolish ruler,‚Äô she is > like ‚Äúa king that tries to privatize the country.‚Äù Above all, she is an > ‚Äúincompetent and lazy‚Äù leader. She is a person who does not take > responsibility and only has the desire for power. She cannot tolerate a > competent subordinate and is strongly likely to engage in random behavior in > order to maintain power. So the public is anxious and fearful the foolish > ruler may do something a senseless child might do. Above all, to a foolish > ruler, the people and the country is a means to satisfy her desires. She > likely regards ‚Äòthe country=power=me.‚Äô > Even with this kind of presidential image, she is a fine enough leader for > those who want to maintain conservative power. She could even be a really > needed leader if one‚Äôs gains or interests fit well together with the > president. However, the people who see President Park in the image of the > foolish ruler has the thought ‚Äúthe country has been left to someone who is > incompetent and causes uneasiness with the possibility she may do something > preposterous.‚Äù The public having this kind of image about the president does > not, by any means, mean that ‚Äúthe president is this kind of person.‚Äù It just > means some perceive the president as a foolish king. > The more the public think the president is a foolish king, the more the > image of the political leader they desperately want becomes the ‚Äúgreat > commander (strategist).‚Äù A great commander who torments and agonizes himself > and at the same time tries to change society. He may more or less fall short > in taking actual action or combat because he is a strategist, but the public > is satisfied with a leader who provides direction to keep the people from > feeling confused. It is the image of a leader who can tell us the tasks and > crisis our society faces and can solve it together. This kind of image > stands out more when the uncertainty of the current situation becomes > greater.‚Äù This research was made into PCIC (President Candidate Image Checklist) that diagnoses what kind of wish, desire, and belief people have of a particular politician and is being utilized as material that analyzes the public image of tentative presidential candidates in current event programs. = Genitals remark dispute = Sang Min Whang appeared on the 219th episode of the television program ‚ÄúGordian Knot‚Äù and discussed the phenomenon that Park, who was a presidential candidate at the time, was being advertised as the ‚Äúfirst female president.‚Äù In the episode, he argued the public is delusional to expect a mother like aspect from candidate Park who was raised only as a princess and did not marry or experience becoming a mother. This is because in Korean society the life of a woman comes from having to perform a societal role, not from the genitals that are different from men. After this episode was aired, many in the press including Kyunghyang Shinmun, SBS, Dailian, etc. released articles saying Whang remarked ‚ÄúGeun Hye Park is a woman only in her genitals‚Äù and there was hot debate on the internet on ‚Äúhow a professor could say something like ‚Äòa woman only in her genitals?‚Äô‚Äù As a result, the debate on candidate Park‚Äôs qualifications and tendencies as a leader moved onto value assessment and criticism on a remark made by a peculiar professor, and the question ‚Äúis it possible for the people to expect candidate Park to demonstrate the role and capability of a woman in Korean society?‚Äù was not brought up again. However, in the actual recording of Gordian Knot, the sensational line ‚ÄúCandidate Park is a woman only in her genitals‚Äù was not found and there was only a comment ‚Äòthat (the claim by anchor Jong Jin Park that at-the-time candidate Geun-hye Park also has femininity) is an issue of genitals (not) acting in the role of a woman‚Ä¶‚Äô Sung Joo Kim, who was the co- chair of the presidential campaign committee of Saenuri party at the time, visited Yonsei University in protest and demanded Whang's resignation from professorship in relation to this incident and appeared on Hyun Jung Kim's news show and testified that she received a promise from Yonsei University to send Sang Min Whang to the disciplinary action committee. Sung Joo Kim's comment that ‚ÄúYonsei University promised sending Sang Min Whang to the disciplinary action committee‚Äù as she demanded Whang's resignation shows Yonsei University's decision to terminate Whang is not unrelated to the Geun Hye Park regime. Sang Min Whang said ‚Äú[I] did not [use the word ‚Äúgenitals‚Äù to] belittle women as a whole but used [the word] as an academic term to differentiate between societal role and biological difference,‚Äù but Sung Joo Kim retorted, ‚Äúhis action is one of not being able to distinguish things you should say and things you should not say.‚Äù On this, Sang Min Whang analyzed if Sung Joo Kim ‚Äúis idolizing candidate Park as a divine being and not as a person then it shows the state of mind as is that considers the word ‚Äúgenitals‚Äù as profane and blasphemous.‚Äù > [Gordian Knot Episode 219 relevant section recording (Sang Min Whang / ‚óè: > Jong Jin Park)] > Whang: When we say a woman is less corrupt than a man, in that instance is > the difference between a woman and a man a difference in genitals or are we > talking about a difference in how they live? * > Park: I don‚Äôt know about that.

Criticism of college star athletes preferential treatment and Yuna Kim Show controversy  Sang Min Whang who was a regular on CBS Radio‚Äôs ‚ÄúMi Hwa Kim‚Äôs Everybody‚Äù program criticized colleges‚Äô preferential treatment of its sports stars on May 22, 2012. > > When did Yuna Kim go to college? Do you go practice teaching as you > graduate high school? When we say diligence it means practicing an > undertaking consistently well. It is true athlete Kim (Yuna Kim) is busy but > it does not mean she practiced teaching diligently. If Yuna Kim goes to > teaching practice, does it mean she fulfilled all the prerequisites to > become a student-teacher by going to class assiduously for 4 years in > college and received grades for completing courses? Yuna Kim trains mainly > abroad for personal or national work and goes around abroad. Is Korea > University a school that lets one graduate with no classes required? We > provide a lot of special benefits for sports stars exempting them from > military service and paying them a lot of money. Either Yuna Kim‚Äôs parents > or the school is teaching athlete Kim, who is trying to become a teacher, > the wrong way. Yuna Kim receiving a certificate as if she is collecting them > may be thought of as her just showing her face and receiving a certificate > from a regular student-teacher‚Äôs position. The college is using stars like > Kim for marketing in order to make their name known among the public. A > college has given up being a college and stooped to the level of gaining > publicity like a regular corporation.‚Äù Unlike Sang Min Whang's intention to discuss ‚ÄúKorean universities‚Äô utilizing students as a means for gaining publicity and the preferential treatment of elite sports athletes,‚Äù he became embroiled in the controversy of ‚Äúfact checking Yuna Kim‚Äôs teaching practice.‚Äù A teacher from Yuna Kim's teaching practice site, Seoul Jinseon Girls' High School, refuted in an interview on ‚ÄúMi-hwa Kim‚Äôs Everybody‚Äù to ‚Äúplease check the fact that [Yuna Kim] is coming to school and diligently coming to practice teaching‚Äù and on June 6 Yuna Kim's management company, All That Sports, sued Sang Min Whang for slander saying ‚Äúthere are parts of what he said that are untrue that he spoke of as if it were true and because that damages the athlete‚Äôs honor we are taking legal measures.‚Äù However, they also left the possibility of dropping the lawsuit open by saying, ‚Äúwe can drop the suit at any time if professor Whang apologizes for the false information that was not checked.‚Äù On the controversy surrounding his comments, Whang said ‚ÄúI think it is possible to specially grant college admission to any number of (star athletes). But on whether the athletes receive a proper education while going to college, on whether colleges have a real interest in educating these students, right now they do not‚Äù and ‚Äúthey are only a means to gain publicity and the students grow up really as sports machines completely swayed by sports. And when that student graduates from college is he or she really a person at the intellectual level of a person who graduated from a 4-year university? And later when [that person] does a masters or doctorate program and even becomes a professor in that field, we already saw through athlete Dae Sung Moon‚Äôs case how the dissertation is not written but copied from other sources‚Äù and ‚Äúwe discussed this issue from the perspective of psychological reasoning, from the side of let‚Äôs think about this aspect, but if [Yuna Kim] thought of this as talking about her and sues then who in Korea would raise questions about a problem or issue that makes us frustrated?‚Äù Whang expressed his frustrations for having been weirdly attacked for trying to raise an educational issue. He did not back down from his opinion saying, ‚ÄúI just called it as I saw it,‚Äù but apologized for the discomfort Yuna Kim may have felt being taken as an example and stepped down from the radio program ‚ÄúMi Hwa Kim‚Äôs Everybody.‚Äù Afterwards, Yuna Kim's side dropped the suit against Sang Min Whang saying ‚Äúwe do not want to be caught up in this anymore.‚Äù However, the possibility was mentioned that this decision was made conscious of the potential controversy that may rise when the fact comes out that Yuna Kim cannot normally become a student teacher because she did not attend almost all of the undergraduate classes at Korea University if the defamation lawsuit progressed and the problem of ‚Äúwhether [Yuna Kim] went to teaching practice diligently‚Äù and ‚Äúwhether [Kim] has the qualifications to practice teaching‚Äù had to be proven. Some compared Yuna Kim with ex-Tae Kwon Do athlete Dae Sung Moon's example and the opinions ‚Äúraising national prestige itself does not give [star athletes] the right to skip school‚Äù and ‚Äúthis needs to be a starting point to face the inconvenient truth that we cannot foster ‚Äòstudying athletes‚Äô‚Äù were raised.  Life after dismissal  At the end of 2016, the occurrence of \\"Geun Hye Park‚ÄìSoon Sil Choi Gate\\" shed new light on Sang Min Whang's dismissal from Yonsei University in the press and in politics. He also took this time to reset his own values, which can be known from his words in the following: \\"If I could do what was enjoyable to me then I was not going to be concerned with anything else and tried hard to be indifferent and lived thinking \\"a professor's duty is only to do research.\\" I tried to live detached from the power struggle as an aloof scholar who would occasionally observe it from afar and provide advice. But in Korea, after knowing the truth that I cannot do the work I enjoy and do well at all outside of its influence‚Ä¶ I realized the truth that I was terminated because my desire to stay as an aloof scholar was not as clear compared to those who tried to gain power who had very clear desires and was thorough in their pursuit of it. So I thought I should no longer stay as an observer‚Ä¶ The people were also deceived by Lee-Myung-Park-Geun-Hye because they did not face what they want and did not make it clear enough.\\" After diagnosing the Korean peoples' mind as being in \\"a state of slavery\\" in relation to the \\"Geun Hye Park‚ÄìSoon Sil Choi Gate,\\" Whang spoke out more proactively and clearly on his opinions in politics in the press and on his podcast after his dismissal, and is leading \\"the Korean Peoples' Psychological Independence Movement\\" with the public through the podcast Whangshimso.

After winning twice in his native France he moved to England and won the Top Novices' Hurdle in 2016. In the following season he won two steeplechases before reverting to hurdle races to win the Contenders Hurdle and then recording his biggest success in the Champion Hurdle. In the 2017‚Äì18 season he was unbeaten, winning the Fighting Fifth Hurdle, Christmas Hurdle and a second Champion Hurdle. Background Buveur d'Air (French for \\"drinker of air\\") is a bay gelding with a small white star bred in France by G√©rard Fert√©. In his early racing career he was trained in France by his owner Philippe Chemin. Buveur d'Air's sire Crillon won five races including the Listed Prix Denisy and ran second to Montjeu in the Prix Foy. He later became a successful sire of jumpers whose other offspring have included Alex he Larredya (Grand Prix d'Automne) and Jemy Baie (Prix Troytown). His dam History was unraced but produced several other winners including Punchestowns whose victories included the Long Walk Hurdle and the Scilly Isles Novices' Chase. She was a distant female-line descendant of Kandy who won the 1000 Guineas in 1932. She was not, however, considered a Thoroughbred as her pedigree included the Selle Fran√ßais stallion Evainqueur. Racing career =2014-2015: National Hunt Flat races= Buveur d'Air began his racing career in flat races restricted to AQPS horses. He was unbeaten in two French races, winning at Saint-Jean-de-Monts in August 2014 and at Nantes on 2 October. The gelding was then acquired by Potensis Bloodstock and Chris Giles and was sent to England where he was trained at Upper Lambourn in Berkshire by Nicky Henderson. Competing for his new connections in National Hunt Flat races he finished second to Barters Hill in February 2015 at Newbury Racecourse and then finished fourth behind the same horse in the more competitive Champion Standard Open NH Flat Race at Aintree's Grand National meeting in April. =2015/2016 National Hunt season= In the 2015/2016 National Hunt season Buveur d'Air was campaigned in novice hurdle races. On his debut over obstacles he won a maiden hurdle at Newbury in November taking the lead at the final flight and accelerating clear to win in \\"impressive\\" style by eleven lengths from the favoured Wait For Me. At Huntingdon Racecourse in January he started at odds of 2/11 and won \\"very easily\\" by seven lengths from eight opponents. Buveur d'Air made his first appearance at the Cheltenham Festival on 15 March 2016 when he started the 10/1 third favourite in a fourteen-runner field for the Supreme Novices' Hurdle. After being restrained by his regular jockey Noel Fehily in the early stages he stayed on without ever looking likely to win and finished third behind his stablemate Altior and the Irish-trained Min. Buveur d'Air returned to Aintree in April and started the 11/4 second favourite behind Limini (winner of the Dawn Run Mares' Novices' Hurdle) in the Grade 1 Top Novices' Hurdle. Equipped with ear-plugs, he moved into contention at the final flight, caught the leader Petit Mouchoir in the final strides and won by a neck with a gap of eight lengths back to Limini in third. The unplaced runners included Bleu et Rouge (Deloitte Novice Hurdle) and Agrapart (Betfair Hurdle). At the end of the season he was bought privately by J P McManus. =2016/2017 National Hunt season= Buveur d'Air began the 2016/2017 National Hunt season by competing in novice chases. On his debut over fences at Haydock Park on 17 December he was ridden by Aidan Coleman and won \\"easily\\" by three and a quarter lengths from Cloudy Dream. He followed up two weeks later at Warwick Racecourse, taking the lead on the run-in and winning by two and a quarter lengths from Gino Trail at odds of 30/100. With several leading hurdlers being injured and the Henderson-trained Altior dominating the novice chase division it was decided to return Buveur d'Air to the smaller obstacles for the remainder of the season. In the Contenders Hurdle at Sandown Park Racecourse he was partnered by Barry Geraghty and went off at odds of 1/4 against three opponents headed by the dual Fighting Fifth Hurdle winner Irving. After racing in fourth place for most of the way he \\"cruised\\" into the lead on the run-in and won by one and a half lengths from Rayvin Black. In the 2017 Champion Hurdle at Cheltenham on 14 March Buveur d'Air started the 5/1 second favourite behind the Christmas Hurdle winner Yanworth. The other nine runners included Petit Mouchoir (winner of the Irish Champion Hurdle), Brain Power (Wessex Youth Trust Handicap Hurdle), The New One, My Tent Or Yours, Footpad (Prix Alain du Breil, Prix Renaud de Vivier) and Wicklow Brave (Irish St. Leger). Ridden by Fehily Buveur d'Air settled in mid-division as Petit Mouchoir set the pace, and moved into contention after the fifth flight. He overtook Petit Mouchoir approaching the final obstacle and drew away on the run-in to win by four and a half lengths. My Tent Or Yours stayed on to take second ahead of Petit Mouchoir, Footpad and The New One. In the Aintree Hurdle over two and a half miles in April, the gelding was partnered by Geraghty and was made the 4/9 favourite against five opponents. After tracking the leaders he went to the front approaching the final flight and drew clear to win by five lengths from My Tent Or Yours with The New One coming home in third. After the race McManus commented \\"It doesn‚Äôt get much better than that. I can‚Äôt remember what Nicky said when he wanted to return Buveur D‚ÄôAir to hurdles but he said it more than once. He was pretty insistent and in the end we let him have his way. He was sure he wanted to give him a shot even before Faugheen and Annie Power were declared non-runners. He's a top man and sometimes you have to go along with it\\". =2017/2018 National Hunt season= Buveur d'Air was ridden by Geraghty in all four of his races in the 2017/2018 National Hunt season. He began his campaign in the Fighting Fifth Hurdle at Newcastle Racecourse on 2 December and won in a \\"canter\\" by five lengths from Irving after taking the lead three hurdles from the finish. Only three horses took the field against the champion in the Christmas Hurdle at Kempton Park Racecourse 24 days later and The New One was the only one of the trio given any serious chance of causing an upset. Starting at odds of 2/11, Buveur d'Air raced in second before overtaking The New One at the last and \\"cruised\\" away to win by two and a quarter lengths. As in 2017, Buveur d'Air prepared for the Cheltenham Festival with a run in the Contenders Hurdle and started at 1/16 against two opponents. He led from the start, went clear after the second last hurdle and was eased down on the run-in only to be challenged by the Swinton Handicap Hurdle winner John Constable, leaving Geraghty needing to drive the favourite out to win by one and three quarter lengths. On 13 March 2017 Buveur d'Air attempted to repeat his 2017 success in the Champion Hurdle and was made the 4/6 favourite. His ten opponents included Faugheen, Melon (WKD Hurdle), Elgin (Kingwell Hurdle), Wicklow Brave, Yorkhill (Baring Bingham Novices' Hurdle) and John Constable. The favourite raced in third as his stablemate Charlie Parcs set the pace from Faugheen and moved up to take the lead at the second last. He was immediately joined by Melon and the pair engaged in a sustained struggle up the straight before Buveur d'Air gained the advantage in the final strides and prevailed by a neck. Geraghty commented \\"There was nowhere to hide. The best horse was going to win and, thankfully, I was on the best horse. You don't win these back to back unless you are very good and he's won everything all season. He scrapped it out today. He's been flashy all season because he hasn't had to deal with much but today he had the opposition and he lived up to it. It was a proper race and the runner-up put it up but my fella is battle-hardened and tough as nails\\". =2018/2019 National Hunt season= As in 2017, Buveur d'Air began his campaign in the Fighting Fifth Hurdle, a race which saw him matched at against two of the previous season's outstanding novices Samcro (Baring Bingham Novices' Hurdle) and Summerville Boy (Supreme Novices' Hurdle). He raced in second place behind Samcro before taking the lead at the final hurdle and accelerating away to win by eight lengths in \\"impressive\\" style. The gelding started at odds of 1/4 when he attempted to repeat his 2017 success in the Christmas Hurdle and looked likely to win when he took the lead at the second last. On the run-in however, he was strongly challenged by his stablemate Verdana Blue and beaten a short head into second place. On 2 February Buveur d'Air attempted to win the Contenders Hurdle for the third time and went off at odds of 1/5 against four opponents. He led for most of the way before accelerating away from his rivals on the run in and winning by two lengths from Vision des Flos, having been eased down by Geraghty in the final strides. At the Cheltenham Festival, Buveur d'Air attempted to emulate Hatton's Grace, Sir Ken, Persian War, See You Then and Istabraq by winning the Champion Hurdle for the third time. Starting at odds of 11/4 he was tracking the leaders when he fell for the first time in his racing career at the third hurdle. He apparently suffered no ill effects as he continued riderless, crossing the line alongside the winner Espoir d'Allen.

It is located in the Butetown area of the city. Originally developed in the late 1800s as a residential location for nearby dock workers, it quickly became a centre for upscale residential properties which revolved around the main square. By 1900, commercial activity had taken its place, dominated by the Coal Exchange, which occupied the once open central space. The square contains a high concentration of listed buildings, which represent a range of architectural styles and some of Cardiff's finest examples of late 19th and early 20th Century commercial architecture. Mount Stuart Square area was designated a Conservation Area in July 1980.Mount Stuart Square: Conservation Area Appraisal, Cardiff County Council, 2009 Geography The area which Mount Stuart Square currently occupies was originally coastal mudflat.The Cardiff Coal Exchange: Conservation Management Plan, Edwards, Zoe, Cotswold Archaeology July 2017 In its present form, it is an urban area, bordered by the A4119 James Street, a major road to the south, early twentieth century social housing to the north (on a site which had previously been used as a rail yard), historic commercial properties to the west on West Bute Street, and the historic Glamorganshire Canal to the east. The canal was drained in December 1951 when a steam suction dredger crashed into the inner lock gates, forcing them to collapse, and all the water was released into the estuary.Rowson, Stephen; Wright, Ian L., The Glamorganshire and Aberdare Canals (Volume 2), Lydney: Black Dwarf Publications, 2004. The gates were never repaired, and for a number of years the canal remained dry until the land was filled in and converted to parkland, named Canal Park. The square lies approximately half a mile to the south of Loudoun Square, which was also built as a residential square but never developed a commercial hub. Junctions with James Street and West Bute Street provide vehicular access to the square, and pedestrian access exists to the parkland to the west. The square has a one way traffic system, where vehicles enter at the junction with James Street to the south west, and exit via either James Street or West Bute Street. Mount Stuart Square has a distinctive form with buildings on four sides facing the Cardiff Coal Exchange building in the centre. It is not a square in the true sense because the building area was limited by the physical restrictions of the canal to the west. The nearest railway station is Cardiff Bay. History Mount Stuart Square in 1920, Ordnance Survey Aerial view of Mount Stuart Square in 1920, looking northeast The development of Mount Stuart Square is closely linked to that of the coal industry in South Wales. The mining of coal in the South Wales valleys in the 1790s onwards meant that Cardiff developed into a port through which the coal was shipped and exported worldwide. It was initially transported using the Glamorganshire Canal, and later by rail on the Taff Vale Railway, both of which terminated close to the site of the square. A number of docks were constructed to facilitate the movement of this coal, and the entire Butetown area of Cardiff was transformed to accommodate the new industry. By the 1830s, Cardiff became the pre-eminent iron-exporting port, shipping almost half of British overseas iron exports; between 1840 and 1870, the volume of coal exports increased from 44,350 to 2.219 million tonnes.The Welsh Academy Encyclopedia of Wales. Cardiff: University of Wales Press 2008. The population of the area increased accordingly, and a grid pattern residential suburb for port-related workers was built on land which included the site of the square. In its original form, Mount Stuart Square was a residential square with a central garden. It was constructed in 1855 as a select residential enclave around ornamental gardens for merchants and sea captains, and originally consisted of 45 stuccoed three-storey town houses.Square peg: DICMORTIMER'S BLOG www.dicmortimer.com. Retrieved 16 March 2017 The land had originally been mudflats, but later the Cardiff Glassworks had partially occupied the area. As a result, the underlying soil was a mixture of alluvial mud and slag from the glassworks, which required 30 feet concrete shafts to be constructed that rested on a bed of hard gravel in order to construct the foundations of the square. In the period immediately before construction of the square commenced, the land was used as stables for canal horsesWhat Lies Before‚Ä¶ www.savethecoalexchange.com, retrieved 17 May 2018 Named after Lord Mountstuart,Finch, Peter, Real Cardiff, Seren, 2009. the area was the vision of the second Marquess of John Crichton-Stuart, 2nd Marquess of Bute, who wanted to create a grand Georgian space to rival Berkeley Square in London.Cardiff's neglected coal boom era area 'in danger' BBC, 22 January 2017 The development of the square was part of his vision to transform Cardiff into a major port, improve the value of his lands in Cardiff itself and increase the value of the royalties he could charge on his coal fields.Davies, John, Cardiff and the Marquesses of Bute, University of Wales Press, 1981 As the docks rose in prominence, wealthy residents moved out and it became a commercial centre. The construction of the Coal Exchange building between 1884 and 1888 by Edwin Seward solidified the change in focus to commercial, and it became central to the coal trade activity in Cardiff docks for much of the early part of the 20th century.Cardiff's Coal Exchange saved in ¬£40m hotel revamp BBC, 8 April 2016 Built to provide a dedicated location for merchants and traders to sell coal, it followed construction of buildings of a similar function in London, Liverpool and Manchester.

In 1904 the world's first recorded ¬£1m deal was struck there. Those of the original town houses not converted were replaced by purpose-built offices for coal and shipping firms.

The impact of WW1 was significant on the square, having a damaging effect on the coal industry. By 1921, only six of the 52 companies operating in 1888 were still in business, with the industry never recovering. The Coal Exchange closed in 1958, which in turn reduced the demand for commercial premises on the square and allowed boarding houses to be established.Cape Verde Islands made massive impact on Cardiff Wales Online article, 10 March 2010 By the early 21st century, all banks had vacated their properties on the square. The western side of the square saw a gradual demolition of original properties, and by the 1990s was no longer enclosed on its border with the canal.

A key characteristic are the variances in the scale between buildings. This is especially dramatic where the remaining 2-storey buildings are side by side with imposing 5-storey commercial buildings. St Stephens and St James Mansions are large high rise residential buildings constructed in 2003, which occupy a large section of the north western part of the square.

(Today it is in Poland a short distance to the south of the border with the Kaliningrad enclave.) Her father was a landowner. During the war, between 1914 and 1918 she worked on the other side of the country in the city welfare office in Frankfurt am Main, as a counsellor for those bereaved and / or injured by the war. It was here that she met Siegfried Kraus from Vienna whom she married, but the two of them separated quite soon after that. By the end of the war she was recognised for her expertise in social matters, and on 1 October 1919 she was appointed as the first female official in the Prussian Welfare ministry, initially as an internal consultant and, from 1922, as a government officer. She was entrusted with leadership department for child care and morally endangered young women. However, in 1924 she entered into temporary retirement. At the outbreak of the war Kraus-Fessel was a member of the Social Democratic Party (SPD). However, the decision by the party leadership in 1914 to implement what amounted to a parliamentary truce over the financing of the war was contentious within the SPD from the outset: the tensions only increased as front line slaughter and home front destitution mounted. One result was a series of party splits, and by 1919 Meta Kraus- Fessel was a member of the recently launched Communist Party of Germany. Within the party she became involved in the Workers International Relief operation, launched in 1921, and in 1924 she was a co-founder of the complementary International Red Aid organisation. As Stalinist hardliners, in conscious emulation of developments in Moscow, tightened their control over the Communist Party in Germany, Kraus-Fessel became disillusioned with it, and her political loyalties switched progressively from Communism to Anarchism. She was also working during the 1920s as an assistant to the pioneering sexologist, Magnus Hirschfeld. Following the concentration camp murder of her fellow anarchist, Erich M√ºhsam, she took care of his widow, Zenzl. Fairly soon afterwards the two of them fell out. The change of government in January 1933 heralded a rapid switch to one-party dictatorship. The Reichstag fire in February 1933 was instantly blamed on \\"communists\\", after which people with any sort of a political past involving the Communist Party either fled abroad or were arrested. In 1934 Meta Kraus-Fessel emigrated to Vienna. One of her achievements during the next few years included helping the anarchist, historian and linguistics scholar Max Nettlau escape from Vienna to Amsterdam by 1938. Possibly even more challenging was the rescue and transfer of his very large library and the archives collections that it contained. These were sold to the International Institute of Social History in Amsterdam. She herself was able to escape to the United States in 1938. In 1940, after learning that she was incurably ill, she killed herself.

The post is partly ceremonial although the mayor does also preside over full meetings of the council and has the duty of holding decision makers to account. The mayor is elected by fellow councillors in May of each year. Before 1865, when the municipal borough was incorporated, the position was associated with the Court Leet of the Lords of Dudley, which governed the borough of Dudley from at least the middle of the 16th century and probably from the Middle Ages. The earliest known mayor, John A‚ÄôParke was selected in 1565.  History  In the earliest records, the Mayor of Dudley was an official of the Court Leet of the Lords of Dudley. This was a manorial court that provided local governance to the borough of Dudley. The first named mayor is John A'Parke who was mayor in 1565. Records of the court leet before the middle of the 18th century are sparse so only a few names of the earliest mayors are known. One notable early mayor was the ironmaster, Richard Foley, chosen in 1615. Oliver Dixon, mayor in 1690, came from a prominent local family that gave their name to the Dixons Green area of Dudley. Although the leading body governing the town changed in 1791, as the Town Commissioners came into being, the court leet continued to meet until the year after the incorporation of the borough in 1865. The mayor selected in 1860 was Charles Francis George Clark, author of The Curiosities of Dudley and the Black Country. Since 1865 mayors have been chosen from an elected councillor. The first mayor of the new municipal borough, selected on 20 June 1865, was Frederick Smith, Mineral Agent to the Earl of Dudley. One of his first acts was to organize tea, cake, refreshments and entertainment for 4,000 local school children at his residence at the Priory, Dudley. Smith's tenure of the position was short, as on 9 November 1865 his successor, Charles Cochrane was selected by the council. Smith's two successors as municipal mayor were also selected as mayors of the Court Leet. A notable mayor from this period was the industrialist Noah Hingley (1869-70). Noah's son Benjamin Hingley was the last mayor of the municipal borough, serving two terms from 1887. The Local Government Act 1888 changed the status of Dudley to a County Borough, effective from 1 April 1889. The first mayor selected by the new authority was William Squires Gorton. Notable mayors from this period include William Humble Ward, 2nd Earl of Dudley (1895-96) and the founder of Bean Cars, Sir George Bean, who served three terms as mayor: in 1908 and 1911-1912. After the Earl of Dudley had finished his two terms, the next mayor was the Netherton- born George Henry Dunn, who had started his working life, still a child, in a colliery. In 1929, John Harry Molyneux, became the first Labour Mayor of Dudley. In 1933 there were a total of 4 different mayors during the year, as the mayor chosen in the previous year, Joseph Fulwood died at the very beginning of the year and his successor, Henry Joseph Golding, died in August of the same year. John Harry Molyneux was elected for the remainder of the municipal year until the selection of William Charles Williams. In 1949, there was a difficulty in selecting a mayor because: \\"the more experienced eligibles were unable to accept for health reasons, and the younger councillors had to decline because they had neither the time to spare from their work nor the means to supplement the expenses allowed for the office\\". Eventually, John Harry Molyneux, who had first been mayor 20 years previously, was elected. The first female Mayor of Dudley was Dr Katherine Churchill Rogers. She was elected in 1971, and then again in 1985. In 1974 the Metropolitan Borough of Dudley was created from the former County Borough of Dudley and other neighbouring local authorities. The first mayor of the new Metropolitan Borough of Dudley was Mrs. Mary J.Pargeter. The present custom is to elect the mayor and deputy mayor in May of each year. The position of Mayoress or Consort is appointed by the mayor and is usually the spouse of the mayor. The position of Mayor is partly ceremonial although the office holder also presides over meetings of the full council and has the duty of holding council decision makers to account. The mayor also raises money for nominated charities during the period of office. Regalia Both the mayor and deputy mayor have ceremonial robes. The mayor also has a badge and chain as does the mayoress or consort. Since the badges predate the creation of the Metropolitan Borough in 1974, they carry the civic arms of the County Borough of Dudley. The regalia also includes a mace and staff. The silver mace, the oldest item in the regalia, was presented by William, Viscount Dudley and Ward to the town of Dudley in 1798.

After exploring how the various pieces in it straddle or stretch the genres of science fiction and fantasy, he concludes \\"maybe this eliding of genre boundaries is no bad thing. ... Maybe all we are seeing here is a necessary breaking down of artificial divisions in fiction, writers more freely exploring what the fantastic in its broadest terms allows them to. Whatever, this latest volume in a very long-running series, continues to mark not just the best of the genre at one particular moment, but also, perhaps, the direction in which the genre is moving.\\" The contributions by Chiang, Fowler, Duncan, Johnson, Shepard, Kress, Pelland and Levine are all discussed in some depth.Kincaid, Paul. \\"Nebula Awards Showcase 2009 edited by Ellen Datlow\\" (review), 2009.

The title traces its origin from the times of the Old Pahang Sultanate, and was historically known as Maharaja Indera Putera. The traditional pegangan ('fief') of the nobility is Temerloh, as well as the entire land between the Triang river basin to the borders of Selangor and Rembau in Negeri Sembilan (approximately the constituencies of Bera and Bentong). During the reign of Raja Bendahara Tun Ali, the title was renamed 'Orang Kaya Indera Segara'. The title is the second-most influential among the four major chiefs, as his territory is the second-farthest from the capital. Role Historically, the Orang Kaya Indera Segara was part of the Orang Besar Berempat ('four major chiefs') that wielded very wide powers in Pahang. They had the authority to impose taxation and to decide all criminal and civil cases except those which involved capital punishment. In fact, their power was limited only by the capacity of the monarch to restrain them, and it varied according to their proximity to Pekan, the further from the court, the greater their authority. They were obliged to appear at Pekan once a year to menjunjung duli ('pay homage'). They had to pay a form of tribute called banchi to the monarch. Their districts were subject to serahan; the obligation to buy, at exorbitant prices, goods the monopoly for the sale of which, in certain localities the ruler was in the habit of granting to one of his favourites. In the month of Muharram. they appeared at court with offerings. In the time of war they were required to take the field with men, arms and food. The installation of the monarch was incomplete unless the Orang Besar Berempat assisted thereat. The Pahang constitutional theory was that the Orang Besar Berempat and, to a lesser degree, the other chiefs were the foundation upon which the monarch's authority rested. During the time of Johor Empire, the four major chiefs gave allegiance to the Bendahara as representing the Sultan, but, in time, the sovereign being to them a nebulous figure, their allegiance tended to become more and more a matter of loyalty to the Bendahara personally. This became formally sealed with the establishment of Pahang Kingdom in the late 18th century. Succession The titles of the Orang Besar Berempat were hereditary. When a chief died, his successor, before approval of his appointment, was required to make a ceremonial offering to the monarch. This usually took the shape of gold-hilted kris, but other forms of offering were permissible. If the eldest son of a deceased chief were unfitted for the succession, it was proper to appoint a younger son, a brother, or a nephew to the chieftaincy. Genealogical tree Five generations of chiefs are traditionally holding the title, until the Orang Kaya Indera Segara V, Tahir. After the death of Tahir, the title was allowed to lapse, but it has again been revived, though not in the same family, in the person Che Engku Abdul Jamal, who is a grandson of Tun Ali. From here onwards, the title has always been bestowed to a member of Pahang royal family.

Location The v√°rzea forests of this ecoregion extend along the low, seasonally flooded rivers of the central and lower basin of the Amazon River, including a large part of the Madeira River basin, the mouth of the Purus River, tributaries of these rives and an isolated patch of v√°rzea along the Mamor√© River between Bolivia and Brazil. Major population centers in or near the ecorgion are Manaus, Itacoatiara, Coari and √ìbidos. The ecoregion adjoins the Madeira-Tapaj√≥s moist forests to the southeast and the Uatuma-Trombetas moist forests and Japur√°- Solim√µes-Negro moist forests to the north. The Purus-Madeira moist forests lie to the west of the Madeira and the south of the Amazon. The Purus v√°rzea is upstream along the Solim√µes and Purus rivers and their tributaries. The Gurupa v√°rzea is downstream along the Amazon. Physical Elevations range from in the east, where the Tapaj√≥s meets the Amazon river, to on the Madeira. The soils are fertile sediments formed in the present Holocene epoch, carried down from the Andes. The annual floods renew the sediments, making very rich soils compared to the higher terra firme on either side of the v√°rzea. The river waters, loaded with sediment, rise by each year, flooding the land for as long as eight months. The river course through the floodplain constantly shifts over time, creating oxbow lakes, levees, meander swales and bars. These landscape elements support diverse vegetation, predominantly seasonally flooded tropical evergeen rainforest. Typically the levees are relatively high, formed by the deposit of sediments along the river margins. Behind them the land slopes down, flattens out and then rises to the terra firme forest. The area behind the levees holds canarana grassland and lakes that expand and contract with the flood cycle. Climate The K√∂ppen climate classification is \\"Af\\": equatorial, fully humid. Average monthly temperatures range from with an annual average of . Average annual rainfall in the east is less than , while in some parts of the Madeira in the west it exceeds . Ecology The ecoregion is in the Neotropical realm and the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests biome. =Flora= The main vegetation types are aquatic vegetation, permanent swamp vegetation, succession vegetation and forest mosaics. Typically there are fewer tree species in the v√°rzea than on terra firme, although many trees are common to both environments. Trees in the v√°rzea are usually shorter than on terra firme, with a canopy of up to . There are some palms, and often a dense understory of plants in the genus Heliconia and families Zingiberaceae and Marantaceae. Tree species that grow only in wetlands include Virola surinamensis, Calycophyllum spruceanum and A√ßa√≠ palm (Euterpe oleracea). The economically valuable palms Astrocaryum jauari and Mauritia flexuosa are common on the floodplain. Other trees that feed the fruit-eating fish that enter the forest during flood periods are the yellow mombim (Spondias mombim), socor√≥ (Mouriri ulei) and tarum√£ (Vitex cymosa). Grasses in the canarana areas include Echinochloa and Hymenachne species, with tall grasses along the river margin such as Gynerium sagittatum, Paspalum repens and Echinocloa polystachya. Shrubs include Coccoloba ovata, Eugenia inundata, Ruprechtia ternifolia and Symmeria paniculata. Slightly higher up there are early succession trees such as Acosmium nitens, Buchenavia macrophylla, Cecropia latiloba, Crateva benthamii, Ficus anthelminthica, Machaerium leiophyllum, Macrolobium angustifolium, Piranhea trifoliata, Pseudobombax munguba and Tabebuia barbata. Higher up again, but still in flooded areas, trees include Calycophyllum spruceanum, Ceiba pentandra, Couroupita guianensis, Hura crepitans, Pirahnea trifoliata, Virola surinamensis, Genipa americana, Hevea brasilienses, Lecointea amazonica, Sterculia elata and Rheedia brasiliensis. =Fauna= The ecoregion is home to 200 species of mammals including jaguar (Panthera onca), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), South American tapir (Tapirus terrestris), capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris), kinkajou (Potos flavus) and white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari). The hairy-tailed bolo mouse (Necromys lasiurus), and Amazonian sac- winged bat (Saccopteryx gymnura) are endemic. Aquatic mammals include Amazon river dolphin (Inia geoffrensis), tucuxi (Sotalia fluviatilis) and the endangered Amazonian manatee (Trichechus inunguis) is also endangered. The giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis) is also endangered. Large reptiles include black caiman (Melanosuchus niger), spectacled caiman (Caiman crocodilus) and green anaconda (Eunectes murinus). Primates include spider monkey (subfamily Atelinae), Venezuelan red howler (Alouatta seniculus), common squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus), bare-eared squirrel monkey (Saimiri ustus) and red-handed tamarin (Saguinus midas). Endemic primates include Hoffmanns's titi (Callicebus hoffmannsi), ashy black titi (Callicebus cinerascens), Hershkovitz's titi (Callicebus dubius), Santarem marmoset (Mico humeralifer) and white-footed saki (Pithecia albicans). Endangered primate include white-bellied spider monkey (Ateles belzebuth), Peruvian spider monkey (Ateles chamek), white-cheeked spider monkey (Ateles marginatus), white-nosed saki (Chiropotes albinasus), black bearded saki (Chiropotes satanas) and pied tamarin (Saguinus bicolor). 681 species of birds have been reported, including herons and egrets (genera Egretta and Ardea), whistling ducks (subfamily Dendrocygninae), sharp-tailed ibis (Cercibis oxycerca), ibis (genus Theristicus), and the roseate spoonbill (Platalea ajaja). Endemic birds include ash-throated crake (Mustelirallus albicollis), plain-breasted ground dove (Columbina minuta), red-shouldered macaw (Diopsittaca nobilis), green- rumped parrotlet (Forpus passerinus), scaled ground cuckoo (Neomorphus squamiger), and stygian owl (Asio stygius). Endangered birds include sun parakeet (Aratinga solstitialis), wattled curassow (Crax globulosa), varzea piculet (Picumnus varzeae), green-thighed parrot (P'ionites leucogaster) and red-necked aracari (Pteroglossus bitorquatus). =Status= The World Wildlife Fund lists the ecoregion as \\"Critical/Endangered\\". The ecoregion is threatened by contamination of the water and fish by gold mining, and heavy sedimentation caused by destruction of the forests. Huge areas of the floodplain forests are cleared and burned by ranchers to create pastures for livestock. Global warming will force tropical species to migrate uphill to find areas with suitable temperature and rainfall.

The film's sets were designed by John Stoll. The film reflects the media interest in the notorious and elusive cat burglar of the 1930s Harry Edward Vickers who was nicknamed Flannelfoot because he would cover his boots with cloth to silence his footsteps. The title and the burglar's use of cloth on his boots are the only two resemblances between the actual case and the film's plot, with the latter instead mainly set in the early 1950s. Plot At New Scotland Yard Inspector Duggan returns to duty, still suffering from memory loss after having a wall toppled on him in the American sector of post-war Berlin many years previously whilst trailing a jewel thief. He is assigned to the 'Flannelfoot' jewel-thief case, which bears many similarities to the thief in Berlin. Offering information on 'Flannelfoot' to the police, the ex-con informer 'Ginger' Watkins is turned away and instead takes it to Mitchell, a newspaper crime writer specialising in 'Flannelfoot', who advises him to take a job with Dr. Milligan, the owner of the car Watkins had seen 'Flannelfoot' driving. There Watkins tells Milligan about prison rumours of \\"Yank Peterson\\", the thief who had toppled the wall on Duggan, rumoured to be an American deserter with a talent for accents. Mitchell's employer Lord Wexford seeks advice from crime novelist Tyrone Fraser, father of Andy and Kathleen. Watkins informs both Mitchell and the police of a meeting Milligan has planned, but both their surveillance operations fail, with Milligan tipped off and Watkins murdered by 'Flannelfoot'. Wexford invites alcoholic Bill Neilson and his wife Angela to a house-party, asking him to bring his jewel collection as bait for 'Flannelfoot'. Wexford's daughter Renee reprimands her boyfriend Andy for getting too close to Angela - he excuses it as an attempt to get Angela's business for his car firm, but in fact he hopes to uncover evidence of the Neilsons being involved in the 'Flannelfoot' affair. 'Flannelfoot' steals jewels from the Wexford residence and murders a servant during his escape, hiding the body in Andy's car, where is found when Andy is pulled over by the police for speeding. Duggan arrests Andy, hoping this will cause the real 'Flannelfoot' to break cover. 'Flannelfoot' meets Milligan to fence Kathleen's jewels and recognises 'Miss Armitage', in fact Kathleen working undercover as Milligan's personal assistant. That night, Fraser disguises himself as 'Flannelfoot', steals some of Neilson's jewels and plants one beside Kathleen's car before hiding in it. Renee and Wexford discover the planted jewel and call in Duggan and his DS Fitzgerald, thinking the real 'Flannelfoot' has struck again and intends to murder Kathleen. Fraser reveals the ruse and the police arrest Milligan, who mentions that 'Flannelfoot' had an American accent. Among the jewels Milligan was planning to fence for 'Flannelfoot' Duggan sees one stolen in Berlin, restoring his memory of 'Yank Peterson'. The Neilsons plan to flee to France, but 'Flannelfoot' arrives and kills Bill, who had been employing him in Berlin and England to expand his collection of jewels and was the only man who could give him away. The police arrive and Fitzgerald manages to push 'Flannelfoot' from the roof, fatally injuring him and revealing him as Mitchell. Cast * Ronald Howard as Det. Sgt.

B. A. Behrens, was a British historian and academic. Her early interests included Henry VIII, Charles II, and the early modern period of English history, with her later research focused on the Ancien R√©gime (the Kingdom of France from the Middle Ages to the French Revolution). She was elected a Fellow of Newnham College, Cambridge in 1935, and moved to become a Fellow of Clare Hall, Cambridge after the publication of The Ancien R√©gime (1967). She \\"achieved an international reputation\\" with The Ancien R√©gime, with reviews describing it as \\"remarkable and absorbing\\" and \\"a lively, thought-provoking essay in historical revision\\". Early life and education Behrens was born on 24 April 1904 in London, England. Her father was Noel Edward Behrens (1879‚Äì1967), a Jewish civil servant and banker who had inherited a large amount of money from his father. Her mother Vivien Behrens (1880‚Äì1961), the daughter of Sir Cecil Coward, was a Christian. She was educated at home by a series of governesses and never attended school. She spoke French and English from an early age and later added German. In 1923, Behrens matriculated into Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford to study modern history. She graduated in 1926 with a first class Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree. She was awarded a Commonwealth Fellowship to Radcliffe College, a women's liberal arts college in Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States, in 1928. Academic career Having returned to the United Kingdom, Behrens held research posts at Bedford College, London and at University College, Oxford. In 1935, she was elected a Fellow of Newnham College, Cambridge. Additionally, she was appointed an assistant lecturer in the Faculty of History, University of Cambridge in 1938 and promoted to lecturer the following year. Her research in the mid-1930s was focused on Henry VIII, and she published a number of articles on this period including on his divorce and on resident diplomats. Her interests moved to later English history and she published an article on Charles II in 1941. As with many academics, Behrens offered her services during the Second World War. Therefore she left academia for a number of years to work in Whitehall, where she was likely assigned to the Ministry of War Transport. After the war ended, she spent ten years researching and writing an analysis of the role of British-controlled merchant ships during the war. Personal life In 1966, Behrens married Ted Carr, a fellow historian and former diplomat.

Previously, she took the field for New South Wales Breakers and Sydney Sixers. Born in Grafton, New South Wales, Sutherland began playing cricket when she was nine years old. Although her South Grafton school did not have enough girl players to make up a girls cricket team, she was later a prominent member of the NSW Youth squads. On her debut for the New South Wales Breakers in October 2010, Sutherland earned a Player of the Match award. During the 2010‚Äì11 season, she played a major role in the Breakers' Twenty20 squad, and also a bit-part in its WNCL 50-over matches. The following season, her on-field results were disappointing, and she played only one WNCL match. However, she also received the Bradman Scholarship from the Bradman Foundation and a Ben Lexcen Scholarship from the University of New South Wales, and toured New Zealand with the Shooting Stars. During pre-season training for the 2012‚Äì13 season, Sutherland was diagnosed with Plantar fasciitis, or \\"jogger's heel\\", initially in one of her feet, but later in both. The jogger's heel put her at a disadvantage against most of her team mates, but eventually she fought back to resume her place in the Breakers squad. In 2013‚Äì14, Sutherland played in all the Breakers' WNCL games apart from the first one, which she missed due to a broken thumb, and took a bag full of wickets in the Twenty20 competition. At the end of that season, she was once again selected for a Shooting Stars tour, to Sri Lanka. In 2014‚Äì15, Sutherland played for the Breakers in the WNCL semi- final against Victorian Spirit, but was not selected for the final against the South Australian Scorpions. She then joined English county side Kent, for which she achieved her best bowling figures for the year of 3-17 against Lancashire. At the start of the 2015‚Äì16 season, Sutherland moved to the Queensland Fire, where she sought more opportunities to break into the Southern Stars team. However, she also joined the Sydney Sixers squad for its inaugural WBBL01 season (2015‚Äì16). Explaining her choice of WBBL club, she told The Daily Examiner, \\"Sydney's a great city. The colour of the team helped and I guess the rest of the squad that we have was the major drawcard to play for the Sixers.\\" In June 2016, Sutherland injured her knee ligaments in a fall; the injury caused her to concentrate on her batting while she was recovering. Despite that setback, she played for Queensland Fire in its last three matches of the 2016‚Äì17 WNCL competition, including the final, and was signed by Brisbane Heat for the WBBL02 season. Sutherland is a cousin of Mitchell Aubusson, who won an NRL premiership with the Sydney Roosters in 2013. When not playing cricket, she is a member of Queensland Cricket's Game and Market Development team, and has also played soccer.

The production of the car is planned to be 275 units at ¬£2 million, all of which have been already sold. Mercedes-AMG received orders for four times the production amount, but have stated that production will not be increased from the planned 275 units, in order to maintain the exclusivity of the car. Currently, the car is at the concept state, since it has not reached homologation regulations yet. The official name of the car was changed from \\"Project One\\" to simply \\"One\\".https://www.motor1.com/news/267680/mercedes-amg-one- hypercar/https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/mercedes-amg-one-hypercar/  Development  The cars will be evaluated on their performance, durability, and ability in Mercedes-Benz's proving grounds and on racing circuits. The Head of Mercedes-AMG, Tobias Moers also states that when \\"the time is right\\", Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 team driver and six-time champion Lewis Hamilton, who has worked on the development of the car, will test the prototypes. Mercedes- AMG Project One Project One wheel  Specifications  = Powertrain = The powertrain of the Mercedes-AMG ONE is expected to be rated at through a hybrid drivetrain that shares many features with modern Formula One cars. The car has five motors with different functions onboard: one internal combustion engine (ICE) and four electric motors.  Internal combustion engine  The Mercedes-AMG F1 W07 Hybrid (being driven by Lewis Hamilton in 2016). A car on which the engine and design of the Project One is based The Mercedes-AMG ONE will utilise a modified 1.6-litre turbocharged 90-degree V6 engine from the Mercedes-AMG F1 W07 F1 car, as confirmed by Mercedes-AMG board member Ola K√§llenius. Modifications will be done to the engine due to the engine's illegality in RPM idle and redline. The head of Mercedes-AMG, Tobias Moers, states that the engine will be at 1,280 rpm when idle, and at 11,000 rpm when at its redline limit. However, the engine will only last for and the owners will have to return their cars for engine refurbishment. The ICE produces , with torque figures still unknown.  Electric motors  The ICE will work in conjunction with four electric motors: a Motor Generator Unit-Kinetic (MGU-K) coupled to the crankshaft, a Motor Generator Unit-Heat (MGU-H) coupled to the turbocharger, and two electric motors at the front axle. The MGU-K and MGU-H are Formula One-style motors responsible for recovering energy and improving efficiency during operation of the car. More specifically, the MGU-K serves to generate electricity during braking, while the MGU-H serves to eliminate turbocharger lag and improve throttle response by keeping the turbine spinning at high speeds. The final two electric motors drive the front wheels to allow for an all-wheel drive drivetrain, and the sum of these four electric motors will contribute effective power to the total power output figure of the Project One. = Transmission = The transmission will be an 8-speed single-clutch automated manual transmission variant (which is actually a similar type of transmission used in modern Formula 1 cars) and will deliver the bulk of the engine power and torque to the rear wheels. The use of a single-clutch over a dual-clutch transmission was due to AMG's engineers wanting to keep the car light and due to concerns over the dual-clutch's ability to handle the high- revving V6 ICE. = Wheels = The Project One has wheels made of aluminium alloy and carbon fibre with diameters of 19 inches at the front and 20 inches at the rear with centre-lock wheel nuts. The tyres are Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2s with codes of 285/35 ZR 19 for the front and 335/30 ZR 20 for the rear. The brakes are ventilated carbon-ceramic discs. = Interior features = Interior The interior is mostly minimalist and driver-focused, continuing the Formula One theme of the Project One. This includes a Formula One-style steering wheel and pedals, and a driver-oriented central infotainment screen. There are some traditional luxury features in the interior, notably napa leather and hand stitching on the bucket seats. = Exterior features = left The exterior of the car is designed primarily for aerodynamics, although it still maintains a profile reminiscent to a road legal car. The notable aerodynamic features include the large front air inlets, the roof-mounted air intake and the large aerodynamic fin extending down the back half of the car. = Chassis = The body will be made entirely of carbon fibre to reduce weight, resulting in a final estimated kerb weight of around .

GLAD-PCR assay do not require bisulfite treatment of the DNA. Method was specially designed to determine methylation of RCGY site of interest in human and mammalian genomes in excess of corresponding unmethylated sites. This is a typical situation for DNA preparations from clinical samples of blood and tissues. GLAD-PCR assay is based on the new type of enzymes - site-specific methyl-directed DNA- endonucleases (MD DNA endonucleases). These enzymes are very similar to restriction enzymes in biochemical properties and cleave DNA completely, but act in opposite way: they cleave only methylated DNA and do not cleave unmethylated DNA at all. Recognition sites of available MD DNA EndonucleasesMammalian DNA-methyltransferases DNMT1, DNMT3a and DNMT3b catalyze a reaction of DNA methylation. * DNMT1 maintains DNA methylation pattern in vivo modifying a new strand after replication. * DNMT3a and DNMT3b are responsible for DNA methylation de novo including abnormal hypermethylation in cancer cells. It is well known that hypermethylation of CpG-islands in regulatory regions of promoter and/or first exon in a variety of genes often occurs at early stages of sporadic carcinogenesis. This leads to downregulation of the genes expression in tumor cells, whereas in a healthy tissue the corresponding genes remain to be active. Thus, the detection of such epigenetic biomarkers is one of the most promising diagnostic and prognostic tools Study of DNMT3a and DNMT3b substrate specificity has shown that both enzymes predominantly recognize RCGY site and modify internal CG- dinucleotide to form 5‚Äô-R(5mC)GY-3‚Äô/3‚Äô-YG(5mC) R-5‚Äô sequence. One of new enzymes GlaI recognizes and cleaves site R(5mC)GY. Due to this unique substrate specificity, GlaI is a convenient tool for identification of de novo methylated sites in the human and mammalian DNA.DNMT3 and GLAI equal specificityGLAD-PCR assay includes 3 simple steps: # GlaI hydrolysis of the studied DNA. At this step only R(5mC)GY sites are hydrolyzed. Unmethylated RCGY sites remain uncut. # The universal adapter ligation. As an adapter an oligonucleotide duplex 5‚Äô-CCTGCTCTTTCATCG-3‚Äô/3‚Äô-pGGACGAGAAAGTAGCp-5‚Äô is used, where ‚Äúp‚Äù means phosphate. #Subsequent real-time PCR with Taqman probe.

(Contrast:-Dr King You Me [Yamei] was adopted and brought up by an American missionary family). Her medical career is well-documented, as she was treated as a celebrity by American media, due to the lack of even American women studying medicine at the time. Early life H√º was born to a Chinese Christian family in Fuzhou. Her father's family had been military bureaucrats and had practised Buddhism, but H√º's father converted to Christianity in the 1870s, later becoming a minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church. H√º's mother joined her husband in spreading the gospel and travelled with him to various impoverished areas near Fuzhou. Lady H√º was a friend of Sarah Moore, the wife of the missionary Nathan Sites, who recorded that she endured much persecution as the wife of a minister, but was instrumental in preaching to female visitors interested in Christianity. The family had several daughters, one of whom died only months before H√º was born in 1865. In accordance with contemporary fashions, H√º's feet were bound to make them smaller. During the process, her father decided that foot binding was unnatural and removed the bandages. When he left on a trip, Lady H√º reapplied the bandages, but removed them once again when H√º's father returned. Later, H√º visited a relative, who bound her feet again, but Lady H√º made her take the bandages off when she returned home. H√º argued that she was ashamed of her large feet that everyone ridiculed, but Lady H√º responded, \\"tell them bound-footed girls never enter the emperor's palace.\\" Education Gurubai Karmarkar, H√º, and Mary H. Platt, members of the Class of 1892 at the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania H√º attended the Fuzhou Boarding School for Girls, which was run under the auspices of Woman's Foreign Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church. After leaving school, she trained at the Foochow Woman's Hospital under the guidance of Sigourney Trask, who wrote to the Woman's Foreign Missionary Society describing H√º's skills and good character. She requested that H√º should go to the United States to train in medicine. In 1884, H√º travelled to New York City, then to Philadelphia. On arrival in the United States, H√º could not speak English and she spent the summer before college learning intensively with Sarah Moore. She then attended Ohio Wesleyan Female College from 1884‚Äì1888, which by that time had been merged with Ohio Wesleyan University. In 1888, H√º went to the Woman's Medical College of Philadelphia. After two years, H√º fell ill and took a break from study to visit her family in China, with a trip to Japan on the way there. By this time, her father was suffering from tuberculosis and H√º spent her time nursing him, overseeing the construction of a new family home and working in the local hospital. When the house was finished in 1892, she returned to Philadelphia to complete her training, graduating in May 1894. She then worked for a year in the Philadelphia Polyclinic. Career H√º returned to Fuzhou in 1895 and began work at the Foochow Hospital for Women and Children. After one year, the supervising doctor returned to the United States and H√º was put in charge of the entire hospital. In 1899, she became resident physician at the Woolston Memorial Hospital. At first, many patients demanded to see a foreign doctor not a, \\"Chinese student,\\" but by the summer the number of patients had increased and H√º had to open the dispensary on extra days. From 1899‚Äì1901, H√º trained two medical students, one of whom was her younger sister H√º Seuk Eng (). The hospital struggled with the number of patients, to the extent that a house was built for H√º on a hill outside the hospital grounds to allow for more patient beds to be installed. The number of cases dealt with by the hospital increased from 1,837 in 1899 to 24,091 in 1910. Although it has been reported that H√º acted as representative to the International Congress of Women 1899, London, the minutes of the meeting list the representative of China as Madame Shen. In 1906, H√º opened the course taught at the Woolston Memorial Hospital to any female who could pass a certain exam. Of the four students that passed that year, three were not Christian. However, the hospital continued to run Christian services every morning. Some of the patients Hu treated converted to Christianity, but this was relatively small in relation to the total number of patients the hospital served.Pripas-Kapit, Sarah. (2015). Educating Women Physicians of the World: International Students of the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania, 1883-1911 (PhD). University of California, Los Angeles. In 1907, H√º fell seriously ill and was unable to run the hospital. Though some advised that the hospital should be closed, her younger sister took over the responsibilities of management. Seuk Eng recalled that many patients arrived expecting to be cured by merely touching H√º's clothing or looking at her and were disappointed to see, \\"the little Dr H√º.\\" However, the hospital continued running and H√º returned to advise her sister when she had recovered. Later life When the Woolston Memorial Hospital was burned down by bandits in January 1927, H√º moved with her younger sister to Singapore. She suffered a stroke and died on 16 August 1929. Awards *Honorary degree in Master of Science, Ohio Wesleyan University Compositions H√º is recorded as having been very popular with her teachers and classmates at college and some of her literary writings are preserved.

The first permanent public artwork along the Greenway, the concept was selected through a competition for commission by the Mass Highway Department, and integrated into site construction in collaboration with engineers during building of the Central Artery/Tunnel Project (Big Dig). The Harbor Fog sculpture is part of a genera of environmental artworks that use high pressure cold water fog, hot steam fog, or other gaseous materials, to produce immersive environmental sculpture. Background In the 17th century the site was at the edge of Boston Harbor. During periods of development over the following 260 years, urban rubble and fill was deposited, creating made land between former wharfs. The sculpture is inspired by the dynamic historical landform alterations at the location, changing light and weather patterns found at the ocean's edge, and the industrial design of harbor navigational aids. Design details The sculpture is constructed of three column forms fabricated from stainless steel and bronze, that reference the shape of buoys, each column contains multiple fog nozzles, LED light sources, motion sensors, and sound systems. The sculptural columns are surrounded by a boat-shaped outline of granite seawall blocks, salvaged from landfill containing 18th century piers that were discovered during sub-surface highway construction. The 2000 lb granite seawall blocks are elevated on stainless steel supports that allow the fog to travel under the blocks, and openings between the elevated blocks allow passage into the interior space. Multiple motion sensors on top of the vertical columns register pedestrian activity that is transmitted to a computer processor to control changing sequences of fog, light, and sound. The technology that operates the sculpture is maintained by the non-profit Rose Kennedy Greenway Conservancy. Open all year, the water fog system operates seasonally.

It was lost for 150 years and when found attributed to her brother Felix, before finally being recognized as hers. It premiered in her name on 7 September 2012, played by Andrea Lam.https://www.cvnc.org/eventDetail.cfm?eventId=6383 It received a second performance by Sofya Gulyak on 8 March 2017 for BBC Radio 3. It was the second sonata composed by Fanny Mendelssohn and was completed in 1828. During most of her lifetime, Fanny Mendelssohn's works remained unpublished. A few were published under her brother's name, with her knowledge and consent. The Easter Sonata was not published, but is mentioned as her work in her diary and letters written to her family members in 1829. The manuscript, which is signed \\"F. Mendelssohn\\", was found in France in 1970 and the piece was recorded for the first time in 1972 by √âric Heidsieck, attributed to Felix Mendelssohn. Some musicologists suggested that the piece might be by Fanny Mendelssohn, but the proposal was not seriously considered by most because of the lack of a known autograph manuscript. In 2010 the manuscript was examined by Angela Mace Christian who verified that the manuscript was in Fanny Mendelssohn's handwriting and determined that it had been cut from her book of compositions.https://www.angelamacechristian.com/easter-sonata The sonata depicts the Passion of Christ and the second movement contains an \\"ecclesiastical fugue\\".

It is an extensive collection of short stories and poems, the first of which was published in 1822 under the title of '.Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 37. Rimen en Teltsjes developed its present-day form in the course of the 19th century, when the Halbertsma's continuously added new work to their previous publications.Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 37.Wiersma, p. 5. Eventually their works were gathered together, and the first edition of the actual Rimen en Teltsjes was published posthumously in 1871.Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 37.Wiersma, p. 5. Although the literary value of this collection was later disputed by some critics,Breuker 1993, pp. 594‚Äì596. Rimen en Teltsjes and its predecessor De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar played a role of crucial importance in the development of a new literary tradition after Western Frisian had been used almost exclusively as a spoken language for three centuries.Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 37.Jensma, p. 197. The authors The three Brothers Halbertsma, the authors of Rimen en Teltsjes, were born in the village of Grou, in the central part of the Dutch province of Friesland in the late 18th century.Breuker 1993, p. 587. The two most important of the brothers were Justus Hiddes Halbertsma (1789‚Äì1869), a Mennonite minister in Bolsward en from 1822 onwards in Deventer,Breuker 1993, p. 588. and Eeltsje Hiddes Halbertsma (1797‚Äì1858), who was a physician in Grou.Breuker 1993, p. 592. Justus was a man of science, a prominent linguist, who was acquainted with German literary figures such as the Brothers Grimm. He strongly sensed what the public needed, but at the same time he was a somewhat distant and cerebral author, which tended to have an averse effect on his poetry.Breuker 1993, pp. 588‚Äì591.Dykstra and Oldenhof, pp. 38‚Äì40. His brother Eeltsje, whose prose and poetry were of equal quality, was probably the most talented of the brothers. He was also a much more emotional persoan, who was sometimes overcome by periods of melancholy, which found an outlet in his writings.Breuker 1993, pp. 592‚Äì593.Dykstra and Oldenhof, pp. 40‚Äì42.Wiersma, pp. 9‚Äì10. The third brother, Tsjalling Hiddes Halbertsma (1792‚Äì1852), who was a butter and cheese merchant in Grou, was greatly overshadowed by his brothers as a literary writer. His oeuvre mainly consisted of folk literature, which, however, became quite popular with the common man.Breuker 1993, pp. 591‚Äì592.Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 42. Origins As Justus Hiddes Halbertsma would tell it later, the first step towards the writing of Rimen en Teltsjes was taken when his brother Eeltsje returned from his study in Heidelberg, in Germany, in 1818, and noticed that the street songs in the Netherlands were of a very low quality compared to those in Germany. According to Justus, Eeltsje then set out to write poetry with the intent of replacing the existing songs with better ones of his own making.Breuker 1993, p. 593. The linguist Philippus H. Breuker, who added an extensive and penetrating afterword to the reprint of Rimen en Teltsje of 1993, observed, however, that this assertion could \\"never be more than half the truth,\\" as Eeltsje's early poetry was not of a high literary standard; quite the opposite, in fact. According to Breuker, it seems more likely that Eeltsje wanted to emulate these Dutch street songs.Breuker 1993, p. 593. Justus Hiddes Halbertsma In any case, Justus as well as Eeltsje started writing poetry and short fiction, and as Justus remained the editor of Eeltsje's works for his entire life, their oeuvres were strongly connected and published together from the very beginning.Breuker 1993, p. 593. In 1822, the best of their early works were collected under the title of De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar (\\"Gabe Tailor's Rag Basket\\"; original, archaic spelling: De Lape Koer fen Gabe Skroor), a booklet consisting of 36 pages, and including six poems and one short story.Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 37. This publication was attributed to the fictional 'Gabe Skroar', a lame farmer's son who became a tailor and a writer, but died young.Breuker 1993, p. 597.Twerda, p. 297. This character was in all probability a creation of Eeltsje's.Breuker 1993, p. 597. Hiding behind such a fictional author was fairly normal at that time,Breuker 1993, p. 597.Twerda, p. 297. but Breuker suggests that an extra reason may have been that the Halbertsmas felt it was a little silly to put two names on such a limited collection.Breuker 1993, p. 597. The character of Gabe Skroar (or 'Gabe Tailor') was somewhat ambiguous from the very beginning, which was caused by the difference in the styles of writing used by Justus and Eeltsje. Where Eeltsje's Gabe remained a simple farmer's son who liked to potter about with his writings in the wasted hours, Justus' Gabe was implicitly a more lettered man, who clearly had literary ambitions.Breuker 1993, p. 597. Furthermore, Gabe Skroar's role changed in the course of time: in 1822, he was presented only as the writer of the collection, but in the publications of 1829 and 1834, he developed into the main character of the stories.Breuker 1993, p. 597. In the long run, the character of Gabe became unusable, which was mostly due to Justus' constant little adjustments, and in 1839 even Eeltsje had to admit that there was no point anymore to publishing their works under Gabe Skroar's name.Breuker 1993, p. 597. Development The first edition of De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar, published in 1822, consisted of 200 copies only.Breuker 1993, p. 594.Breuker 2016, p. 1124.Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 37.Oppewal and Boorsma, p. 16.Terpstra, p. 313.Twerda, pp. 297‚Äì298.Wiersma, pp. 5, 11. Those were not sold, however, but at the expense of Justus Halbertsma presented to acquaintances of his all over Friesland.Breuker 1993, p. 594.Oppewal and Boorsma, p. 16.Twerda, p. 298. In this way he awoke among his public a desire for more reading-matter of this nature.Breuker 1993, p. 594.Hemminga, p. 56.Twerda, p. 298. Later he would write about this: \\"That first blow was half the battle. The fans who did not receive a copy were squealing like bleeding pigs, and the way was cleared for all the stories and poems which followed.\\"Breuker 1993, p. 594. The contents of De Lapekoer were in fact something entirely different from what readers were used to, not only as to what language they were written in, but also and especially concerning their informal style. Copies of the booklet were often shared around through entire networks of family and friends, and frequently its stories and poems were transcribed by hand before the booklet was given back or passed on.Terpstra, p. 313.Wiersma, p. 11. A second, expanded edition of De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar, consisting of 237 pages, was published in 1829, followed by a third, further expanded edition in 1834, running to almost 500 pages in a larger size.Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 37.Terpstra, p. 313.Twerda, p. 298.Wiersma, p. 5, 11. After that, additions were published separately in 1836 (De Noarger R√∫n oan Gabe Skroar), 1840 (Twigen √∫t in Alde Stamme), 1854 (Leed en Wille en de Flotgerzen), and 1858 (De Jonkerboer and Teltsjes fan de Wize Mannen fan Esonst√™d).Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 37.Brothers Halbertsma 1958, pp. 589‚Äì594. Eeltsje Hiddes Halbertsma After the death of all three brothers, their short fiction and poetry was collected and published in 1871 by the publishing house of J. de Lange in Deventer (where Justus Halbertsma had lived) under the title of Rimen en Teltsjes (\\"Rhymes and Tales\\").Breuker 1993, pp. 603‚Äì606.Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 37.Oppewal and Boorsma, p. 16.Terpstra, p. 313.Wiersma, p. 5. This was done in thirteen installmentsBreuker 2016, p. 2251. (the first of which was published in October 1868),Breuker 2016, p. 2251. which meant it took more than two years before the buyers, who had to subscribe to the entire series of installments, possessed the book in its complete form.Breuker 1993, p. 603.Breuker 2016, p. 2251. The decision to publish Rimen en Teltsjes was made in 1863,Breuker 2016, p. 2251. and the first two installments were edited by Justus Hiddes Halbertsma himself.Breuker 1993, p. 604. He even wrote some new pieces for the collection, such as the short story It Grouwe Pak (\\"The Thick Suit\\").Breuker 2016, p. 1127.Breuker 2016, p. 2251. The rest of the installments were, however, composed under the supervision of librarian and archivist Gerben Colmjon and bookseller and historian Wopke Eekhoff,Breuker 1993, p. 604.Wiersma, p. 5. with Eekhoff giving permission to add the works by Eeltsje Halbertsma which had originally been published by him, not De Lange.Breuker 2016, p. 2251. Rimen en Teltsjes, in its complete form, was a thick book, with 586 closely printed pages, full to the brim with short stories and poems, including classics like De Boalserter Merke (\\"The Bolsward Fair\\"),Brothers Halbertsma 1993, p. 8-9. Jonker Pyt en Sibbel (\\"Squire Pete and Sibylle\\"),Brothers Halbertsma 1993, p. 11-12. Deagraverssankje (\\"Grave-digger's Song\\"),Brothers Halbertsma 1993, p. 13.

Sibbel fan De Ryp (\\"Sibylle from De Ryp\\"),Brothers Halbertsma 1993, p. 86. Skipperssankje (\\"Skipper's Song\\"),Brothers Halbertsma 1993, p. 133.

The first reprint of Rimen en Teltsjes was published in 1881, again by the firm of J. de Lange.Breuker 1993, p. 607. This time, the sole editor was Gerben Colmjon, who, in general, did not make many changes to the first edition, although he did introduce \\"a certain unity in the spelling of vowels and consonants.\\"Breuker 1993, p. 607. It is possible that in 1887 there was a reprint issued of the 1881 edition, although Breuker considers it likely that the scant sources for this were actually referring to a remnant of the 1881 printing. In any case, nothing was changed in the text of the book.Breuker 1993, p. 608. In 1891 G. M. Merkelbach from Bolsward resolved to publish a new edition, but nothing came of it,Breuker 1993, p. 608. and neither did the linguist succeed in publishing the new edition he contemplated in 1892.Breuker 1993, p. 608. Hence it was not until 1895 before a new edition saw the light, published by the Deventer Boek- en Steendrukkerij (formerly the firm of J. de Lange).Breuker 1993, p. 608. It was edited by W. P. de Vries, who changed the text to the so-called Selskipsstavering (\\"Society Spelling\\"), which had been introduced for the Western Frisian language in 1879. However, because he retained the lay-out from the 1881 edition, this caused a rather restless page image, as he kept exactly the same words on a given line, while the number of letters within the words was changed quite dramatically in some cases.Breuker 1993, p. 608. In 1904, publisher Rinse van der Velde from Leeuwarden bought the rights to Rimen en Teltsjes and the remnant of the 1895 printing from De Lange's heirs. After he had sold the last of the 1895 books in 1916, he began to prepare for a new edition, which would see the light in 1918.Breuker 1993, p. 608. To that end he asked his friend, the artist Ids Wiersma, to make a series of illustrations, which afterwards developed into a permanent fixture of Rimen en Teltsjes, and have become almost as famous as the book itself.Breuker 1993, pp. 608‚Äì609.Breuker 2016, p. 2251. Wiersma, as a matter of fact, was paid for his drawings by the Halbertsma family, instead of by Van der Velde.Breuker 1993, p. 608. The 1918 edition of Rimen en Teltsjes was printed on thin paper by Jacob Hepkema of Heerenveen.Breuker 1993, p. 609. Minister Geart Aeilco Wumkes was asked to write an introduction, for which he could draw on the extensive correspondence between the Halbertsma Brothers which the family made available for his use. This meant that after 37 years the Dutch-language introduction Eekhoff had added to the 1881 edition was finally discarded.Breuker 1993, p. 609. The composition of Rimen en Teltsjes itself was also changed, especially by adjusting the sequence in which the stories and poems were placed, and also by the addition of several of the Brothers Halbertsma's works which had remained outside of the collection up until then.Breuker 1993, p. 609. The most important of these was De Wiersizzerij fan Maaike Jakkeles (\\"The Fortune-telling of Maaike Jakkeles\\"), with which the contribution of Tsjalling Hiddes Halbertsma finally took on a more visible form.Breuker 1993, p. 609. This was primarily done on the insistence of Wumkes,Breuker 2016, p. 2251. who was an admirer of Tsjalling Halbertsma.Wumkes, p. 485. The 1918 edition of Rimen en Teltsjes was again published in installments, which meant the book did not reach its complete form before October 1919.Breuker 1993, p. 608. In the Second World War the German authorities in the German-occupied Netherlands gave permission towards the end of 1943 for a fifth edition of Rimen en Teltsjes to be issued,Breuker 1993, p. 609. which was yet again published in installments, by Van der Velde of Leeuwarden, between the summer of 1944 and September 1945.Breuker 1993, p. 609. This edition was printed by Miedema & Co. in Leeuwarden,Breuker 1993, p. 609. and had a large printing (for the standards of Western Frisian literature) of 2,500 copies, which was however outsubscribed three times and therefore sold out immediately.Breuker 1993, p. 596. The editor this time was the author J. P. Wiersma, who added a new introduction of his own making, in which he offered a romanticised biography of the Brothers Halbertsma.Breuker 1993, p. 609. Tsjalling Hiddes Halbertsma When in 1958 the sixth edition was published, Wiersma was again the editor.Breuker 1993, p. 609. At that time, he replaced his earlier introduction with a new one, which was clearer and more matter-of-fact and to the point, but he also made further changes to the Halbertsma's text and choice of words, which he had smoothed and simplified somewhat already for the 1944 edition. This intervention (or interference) of Wiersma's led to a large amount of criticism, although there is a case to be made that these changes were actually beneficial to the uninitiated reader.Breuker 1993, pp. 609‚Äì610. The publishers of the 1958 edition were Van der Velde and A. J. Osinga Publishers of Bolsward.Breuker 1993, p. 610. Afterwards two facsimile editions were published in 1969 and 1978, which were direct photocopies of the 1958 edition (in 1969), and the 1969 edition (in 1978) respectively. Especially Ids Wiersma's illustrations were not improved by making a copy of a copy.Breuker 1993, p. 610. In 1993 the 10th edition of Rimen en Teltsjes was published by A. J. Osinga Publishers of Drachten,Breuker 1993, p. 610. in the framework of the series of Fryske Klassiken (\\"Frisian Classics\\"), consisting of the repubishing of fourteen classics of Western Frisian literature.Schroor, p. 936. For the composition of this edition editor Philippus H. Breuker reached back to the original edition of 1871, while retaining later additions, like Ids Wiersma's illustrations and the stories and poems which had been absorbed into the collection in 1918. These were now appended to the rear of the original Rimen en Teltsjes under the title Neirisping (\\"After-harvest\\"), to which Breuker also added some earlier, lower- quality works by the three authors, which had never before been part of Rimen en Teltsjes.Breuker 1993, pp. 610‚Äì611.Breuker 2016, p. 2251. As for the spelling, Breuker remained as close as possible to the 1871 edition as long as that did not make the text entirely incomprehensible to modern readers.Breuker 1993, p. 612. The 1993 edition had a (for Western Frisian literature) ambitious printing of 3,000 copies, but was sold out within two months.Breuker 2016, p. 1124. Reception When the Brothers Halbertsma started on De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar, there was not much enthusiasm in Friesland for reading Western Frisian-language literature.Breuker 1993, p. 594. The so- called Grutte Lapekoer (\\"Big Rag Basket\\"; that is to say, the 1834 edition) needed twenty years to sell out, to Justus Halbertsma's disappointment.Breuker 1993, p. 596. In the letters he wrote later in life, Justus indicates, however, that he would do it all over again, as he and Eeltsje had set themselves the goal of making the Frisian people start to read in their own language again, and by 1850 they had succeeded handsomely.Breuker 1993, p. 594. By that time they had won a large number of loyal fans, as they would be called today, consisting mostly of people of standing, such as ministers, physicians, public notaries, gentleman farmers, etc., and also of the peasantry.Breuker 1993, p. 594. Furthermore, there must also have been interested persons from outside of Friesland, and from among the urban middle class, as Gerben Colmjon mentioned in 1881 that Rimen en Teltsjes was often read, by that time, by people who did not speak Frisian in daily life.Breuker, 1993 p. 594. By the end of the 19th century, Rimen en Teltsjes were held in high regard in Western Frisian literary circles, being the book which had rescued the Western Frisian language from literary oblivion.Breuker 1993, p. 594. In the oeuvre of poets like Obe Postma and Pieter Jelles Troelstra, who grew up in that period, Rimen en Teltsjes reverberates quite clearly.Breuker 1993, p. 595. Even in 1918, Geart Aeilco Wumkes wrote, \\"this book remains a monument for a section of the life of a nation, which calls on the Frisian soul to love its own nature and being.\\"Breuker 1993, pp. 594‚Äì595. At the beginning of the 20th century, such admiration turned to aversion, a development coinciding largely with the formation of the Jongfryske Mienskip (\\"Community of Young Frisians\\") in 1915.Breuker 1993, p. 594. This was inevitable, really, since Rimen en Teltsjes was the seminal book of the generation against which the Young Frisians were reacting.Breuker 1993, p. 594. Douwe Kalma, the pre-eminent representative of the new order, maintained that \\"on the development of the Frisian spiritual life [this book] can not have other than an unsuitable and unfavourable influence.\\"Breuker 1993, p. 594. Kalma measured (in concurrence with the notions of his time) the literary value of a book by the degree of life tragedy which it included, and concluded that Rimen en Teltsjes were no more than \\"vulgar children's amusement\\" and a \\"cruel mockery\\" of said life tragedy.Breuker 1993, p. 595. He even went so far as to say that the works of the Brothers Halbertsma had \\"spiritually murdered thousands of people.\\"Breuker 1993, p. 595. Another Young Frisian, Eeltsje Boates Folkertsma, missed in Rimen en Teltsjes not so much life tragedy as the mysticism which he felt was an indispensable element of true literature. In fact, for all intents and purposes Kalma's opinion and Folkertsma's were much the same when it came to Rimen en Teltsjes.Breuker 1993, p. 595. In the middle of the 20th century, when the Young Frisian fire had died down somewhat, the pendulum swung back in the other direction. At that time literary critics like Anne Wadman, Jelle Hindriks Brouwer and Ype Poortinga again found beauty in Rimen en Teltsjes, referring primarily to Eeltsje Halbertsma's poetry.Breuker 1993, p. 595. Wadman wrote that the Halbertsmas gave \\"the Western Frisian people a literary monument, in which it saw its own life as a nation [...] reflected.\\"Wadman, p. 14. As neither Willem Bilderdijk nor Isa√§c da Costa were fit to hold a candle to Eeltsje Halbertsma (Wadman also wrote), one would look invain for someone of the same stature in the Dutch literature of the same period.Breuker 1993, p. 595. The linguist Philippus H. Breuker, writing in 1993, for the most part subscribed to the same view, and elucidated that it was the whistfulness for wat was and the surprise for wat is which makes Eeltsje Halbertsma's poetry in particular so special. Justus Halbertsma's works, on the other hand, are more abstract, revolve more around ideas and not so much around emotions, and therefore they feel more sharp-edged.Breuker 1993, p. 595. As of today the Brothers Halbertsma's Rimen en Teltsjes still occupies the first slot in the ranking of Western Frisian literary classics.Jensma, p. 197. It is commonly seen as \\"the classical work of Western Frisian literature. It is read by high and low, by learned and unlearned, maybe even still by Frisian and un-Frisian.\\"Breuker 1993, p. 594.

Education Nordgren earned a B.A. in physics from Reed College and an M.S. and Ph.D. in astronomy from Cornell University. Research Before joining the University of Redlands in 2001, Nordgren was an astronomer at the United States Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station and Lowell Observatory. In 2004, with six other astronomers and artists, Nordgren helped develop MarsDials, functioning sundials that NASA's Spirit, Opportunity, and Curiosity rovers carried with them to Mars. Nordgren also designed the giant sundial that resides on the wall of Appleton Hall at the University of Redlands and is accurate within 10 minutes. For the past five years, Nordgren has been traveling around the U.S. to educate the public about what eclipses are and how the opportunity to see the total solar eclipse on August 21, 2017 should not be missed. More of Nordgren's research on eclipses can be found in his most recent book Sun Moon Earth: The History of Solar Eclipses from Omens of Doom to Einstein and Exoplanets (Basic Books, 2016). Collaboration with U.S. National Park Service Nordgren has been a member of the National Park Service Night Sky Team since 2007, working with the U.S. National Park Service to protect the night skies and promote astronomy education in U.S. national parks. Nordgren has helped document the parks' night skies with photography that has been on display in galleries from New York City to Flagstaff, Arizona, and is on display in a number of national parks. The Acadia Night Sky Festival has featured many of his photographs.

It suppresses allergic reactions by binding to FcŒµRI receptor in mast cells, thereby inhibiting production of histamines. It is absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and is proven hepatotoxic for dogs as a result of its accumulation in the biliary canaliculus.  History  Proxicromil was developed in the late 1970s as an oral analogue and a successor of anti-allergy drug Intal, whose patent protection period was to expire in 1982. Disodium cromoglycate in the form of an inhaler licensed as Intal (derived from ‚Äòinterfere with allergy‚Äô) had become the Fisons company's leading product, generating immense income and stimulating further research; thus several attempts at developing a congener were undertaken. Nevertheless, because of its possible carcinogenic properties, Fisons decided to withdraw the drug in 1981, just before it was to be marketed.  Structure and reactivity  Proxicromil has a strongly acidic chromone skeleton. The 5-hydroxy group increases the activity and, along with the 10-alkyl group, causes an increase in lipophilicity of the compound. The relatively high lipophilicity of the molecule allows it to be absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. It is postulated that the absorption may take place via ion-pair formation. Due to these properties proxicromil operates efficiently as a mast cell stabilizer, preventing the release of histamine. This causes the compound to have anti-allergic properties.  Synthesis  The condensation of 6-acetyl-7-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene (I) with allyl bromide (A) using of K2CO3 in DMF gives 6-acetyl-7-allyloxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene (II), which is isomerized to 5-allyl-7-acetyl-6-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene (III) by warming at 200 ¬∞C. Reduction of (III) with H2 over Pd/C in ethanol results in 5-propyl-7-acetyl-6-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene (IV), which is now cyclized using diethyl oxalate (B) using sodium ethoxide in refluxing ethanol to give ethyl 10-propyl-4-oxo-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-4H-naphtho[2,3-b]pyran-2-carboxylate (V). The nitration of (V) with nitric acid in sulfuric acid gives ethyl 10-propyl-4-oxo-5-nitro-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-4H-naphtho[2,3-b]pyran-2-carboxylate (VII), which is hydrogenated with H2 over Pd/C in ethanol-acetic acid to afford the corresponding amino derivative (VIII). At the end, this substance is diazotated with NaNO2 and H2SO4 and afterwards treated with 50% H2SO4 at 120 ¬∞C. The synthesis of Proxicromil from 6-acetyl-7-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene through respectively condensation, isomerization, hydrogenation, cyclization, nitration, reduction and diazotation. The schematic representation is created using Chemdraw Professional.  Mechanism of action  Mast cells are a type of white blood cells that function in the immune and neuro-immune system. Allergic reactions or responses to inflammation or invading microorganisms are coordinated by these cells in a process called degranulation. Antimicrobial cytotoxic and inflammatory mediators, such as histamine, proteoglycans, serotonin and serine proteases, are released from cytoplasmic granules in the mast cells once their high-affinity receptors FcŒµRI detect IgE antibodies and bind their Fc region. The released histamines cause irritations to the organism such as sneezing and an itchy sensation in the nose. Proxicromil acts as an inhibitor of this process, competing with IgE antibodies for binding with the FcŒµRI receptors, thereby reducing the irritation caused by histamines. The substance was found to reduce allergic reactions and the severity of clinical diseases when administered just before the onset. Furthermore, the antihistamine blocks the elicitation of adoptively transferred EAE, an allergic brain inflammation reaction, and it shows a reducing effect on the severity of skin irritation. The inhibiting effect of Proxicromil on the high-affinity FcŒµRI disables bonding to the IgE antigen and that way blocks the release of mediators such as histamine that would normally give an allergic response.  Metabolism  The pathway of metabolism, by most tested species, is by hydroxylation of the alicyclic ring to yield monohydroxylated metabolites with trace amounts of dihydroxylated product. This pathway occurs in rats, hamsters, rabbits, squirrel monkeys, cynomolgus monkeys, baboons and humans, where the metabolites are found in urine and faeces. For dogs a different elimination occurs, which is essentially as the unchanged drug. The reason for this difference in species, results from the dog having a higher dependence on biliary excretion of the unchanged drug for clearance. The value of the plasma clearance for dogs (0.2 ml min-1 kg-1), is 20 fold lower than the value for rats (4.1 ml min-1 kg-1), a species which is capable of metabolism. This difference leads to the different clearance route. Which becomes saturated after administration of a toxic dose of the drug. If the metabolism of proxicromil in a rat is inhibited with SKF-525A, the plasma clearance of proxicromil is lowered (0.6 ml min-1 kg-1), which increases the amount of unchanged drug cleared by biliary excretion. After giving nursing rat mothers proxicromil, the drug and its metabolites gets also excrete in the milk of these rats. At a maternal dose level of 20 mg/kg, an amount 1-2% was present in the milk. From which 63% was proxicromil and 37% the hydroxylated metabolites.  Efficacy, toxicity and side effects  Proxicromil is tested through a variety of independent studies for its beneficial effect as an anti- allergen, its efficacy against migraine, asthma and tumor enhancement. It shows no effect as a prophylactic against migraine. The reported side effects during this study related mainly to transient gastrointestinal troubles and were generally of a mild nature. For asthma and exercise-induced bronchospasm, Proxicromil was found to be mildly effective. But the investigation was discontinued when malignancies occurred in long-term animal studies. In preventing in vitro antigen-induced pulmonary anaphylaxis, Proxicromil was found to be twenty times less potent than Cl-922, another anti-allergy compound. The same result were found in an animal model with rats. Treatment with Proxicromil reverses the tumor enhancement in immunosuppressed animals. Proxicromil is a mast-cell stabilizer that prevents degranulation and release of mediators such as histamine from mast cells. In normal animals, the drug has no effect. Proxicromil is found to be hepatotoxic in dogs but not in rats, which is a result from the different metabolisms. This comes through the route of excretion which Proxicromil undergoes and which leads to a high concentrations at the biliary canaliculus and thus its accumulation and a consequent increase in hepatic exposure. Animal studies revealed possible carcinogenic properties.

Carb√≥ writes poetry, essays, and edits magazines and anthologies. He is primarily known for his book of poetry titled Secret Asian Man (2000) Tia Chucha Press which won the Asian American Writers Workshop's Readers Choice Award. He also won the 2005 Calatagan Award from the Philippine American Writers & Artists for his book Andalusian Dawn (2004) Cherry Grove Collections. His most noted award is the 1999 Gregory Millard/New York City Department of Cultural Affairs New York Foundation for the Arts Fellowship. Carb√≥ spent most of his early career developing contemporary Filipino-American literature as a genre and he is credited by scholars such as Elisabetta Marino as playing an instrumental role in its modern conception. Through his anthologies Returning a Borrowed Tongue, Babaylan, and Pinoy Poetics, he consolidates both Filipino and Filipino-American experiences.  Life and career  = Early life = Carb√≥ was born in Legazpi City, where he and his younger sister Maribri were adopted by Sophie and Alfonso Carb√≥. At age 7, the family moved from their large home in Bicol to Makati, Metro Manila. He attended the International School of Manila for Grades 2‚Äì12, putting him in direct contact with Filipino, American, and international elite. Carb√≥ has stated that some of his early poems, such as \\"Civilizing the Filipino,\\" stem from his experiences with the injustice of white administrators. As the capital city of the Philippines, Manila's close ties with America resulted in a heavy saturation of American pop culture and television shows like The Bionic Man, Charlie's Angels, and Star Trek which dominated his childhood. The movie and story of South Pacific particularly resonated with him, as the family dynamic of the French plantation owner and his two children in the movie musical resembled his own, as noted in his featured interview on National Public Radio. Carb√≥ also enjoyed local Tagalog TV shows such as John N Marsha, Kulit Bulilit, and Uncle Bob's Lucky Seven Club. His father was a major influence in Carb√≥'s decision to become a writer and poet. Carb√≥'s father was well connected to Philippine literature, as he was college friends with Philippine literary giant Raphael Zulueta y da Costa, whose book Like the Molave and Other Poems won the Commonwealth Literary Prize in 1940. He was also friends with the legendary short story writer Bienvenido N. Santos who used to play tennis in their house in Legazpi. His father often interrupted his television time to quiz him on classic literature and read poetry. Between ages 7 and 10, Carb√≥'s father would cajole him to recite Philippine national hero Jos√© Rizal's \\"Mi Ultimo Adios\\" at large dinner parties, instilling in him an interest in classic literature. In the fall of 1984, Carb√≥ moved to the United States to attend Bennington College, and he began to write poetry that Carb√≥ calls \\"silly love poetry that rhymes a lot.\\" He was impressed by the famous writers that taught at Bennington like W.H. Auden, Theodore Roethke, and Bernard Malamud. While there he took classes from noted scholar Jose Hernan Cordova who exposed him to important Latin American writers Jorge Luis Borges, Julio Cortazar, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Rosario Castellanos, Octavio Paz, Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz, Gabriela Mistral, and Jose Lezama Lima. During that period at Bennington College writers were getting published or signed by New York literary agents even before they graduated like Bret Easton Ellis and Donna Tartt. That was where Carbo forged a life-long friendship with Vietnamese writer Jade Ngoc Huynh, author of South Wind Changing. In 1985 he moved to San Antonio, Texas and he finally graduated from St. Mary's University where he helped to establish the Pecan Grove Poets. That group would go on to become the Pecan Grove Press. In 1990 he was accepted into the Masters of Fine Arts Poetry Program at Sarah Lawrence College. He studied under the poets Brooks Haxton, Thomas Lux, and Jean Valentine. Carb√≥ married fellow American poet Denise Duhamel on August 22, 1992, at the Stadler Center for Poetry at Bucknell University, where he was serving as the Stadler Resident Poet. Both worked for anti-censorship causes as a result of having their works banned. In 2008, the couple divorced. = Works and reception = Literary reviewers such as Vince Gotera and critics such as M. Evelina Galang have called Carb√≥'s poetry witty, humorous, and avant-garde. Gotera has also described his work as balancing cynical satire with poignant humor while addressing American erasures of Asian history. The most clear example, according to Gotera, is Carb√≥'s Secret Asian Man. The book's main premise is mishearing the lyrics in Johnny Rivers's 60s hit \\"Secret Agent Man\\" as 'secret Asian man.' The poetry's protagonist is named Ang Tunay na Lalaki (The Real Man) and he comments on New York pop culture through a Filipino-American lens. The book itself is written as a novel-in-verse and the character Orpheus acknowledges his status of being a character of Carb√≥'s first book, El Grupo McDonald's. The unconventional inter-textual approach to narrative in Secret Asian Man became a staple to Carb√≥'s style. His work in collecting Filipino- American poetry into anthologies has set foundation for a Filipino-American literary culture to build off the rudimentary literary tradition of its mother country. There are not strong fundamentals for a literary tradition in the Philippines; in his 1961 lecture at Yale University \\"Philippine Literature: A Two-Fold Renaissance\\", Miguel Bernad contended that Philippine literature as an \\"inchoate literature of many languages.\\" With 175 indigenous languages and both Spanish and American imperialism giving them new languages, Philippine authors split their readerships when choosing which language to write in. Carb√≥'s conscious decision to amass Filipino-American writers into his anthology Returning A Borrowed Tongue intended to base Filipino-American literature in the English language to keep their audience whole, which literary critics such as Al Camus Palomar appreciate. The anthology includes poetry that recounts symbols of Filipino and Filipino-American life, such as jeepneys and cuisine, and use them as vehicles to convey the issues of their united identity. Palomar comments that the poets, who range from the early 1900s to 1990, are masters of English nuance and idioms and the volume as a whole being a stylish testament to Filipino poetry. Not all reviewers appreciated the focus on English, however; Roger J. Jiang Bresnahan opposed the decision, claiming it bred disunity by ignoring their common Philippine culture.  Influence  Carb√≥'s efforts to create both a Filipino and Filipino-American literary genre has, according to Marino, established him as a major influence among his peers. He describes his first two books of poetry, El Grupo McDonald's and Secret Asian Man as \\"collective biographies,\\" sharing the experiences of Filipinos other than him. Carb√≥ often alludes to older Filipino works, his stories often contain historical figures, continuing the literary tradition F. Sionil Jos√© established in Dusk by depicting the famous Apolinario Mabini in the novel. In an interview with El Ghibli's Elisabetta Marino, Carb√≥ claimed \\"the necessity of publishing more Filipino-related material for a world where there was no previous representation takes over the creative impulse.\\" Carb√≥, alongside his poetry, began editing anthologies to group his contemporaries into the Filipino-American genre. In his introduction to the anthology Babaylan, Carb√≥ establishes discourse on Filipina identity, citing Spanish and American colonialism to be the cause of the Filipinas' disconnect to identity. His introduction serves as an unbiased account of the Philippine colonial history, and the role Spaniards and Americans played in the creation of Philippine culture and identity. His contemporary colleague Eileen Tabios's introduction serves as an artist's take on history, starkly contrasting Carb√≥'s with her inclusion of emotion and experience as a Filipina. The verse and prose celebrate the Filipina and their struggle, and Carb√≥ uses Babaylan to establish Filipino-American literary tradition further.

Northampton Borough Council information sheet Hazelrigg House (OS map reference SP7504560412 - ) It is not known exactly when the building was built, but an examination of the building's roof trusses suggests that the property dates from the early 16th century and it is one of the few houses to escape the Great Fire of Northampton in September 1675, when only a part of it was destroyed. The building's name derives from the Hazelrigg family who owned it for many years. It has also been known as Cromwell House and Hazelrigg Manor. The Cromwell reference derives from a local tradition that Oliver Cromwell spent the night at Hazelrigg House on his way to the Battle of Naseby in 1645. Unfortunately this local reference isn't supported by any documentary evidence. The property has a tiled roof and has three gables; the house as built was originally wider, with five rather the current three gables which were added in the 17th century, probably at the same time that the front of the house was remodelled; an extension was also added at the rear. This rebuilding may have been made in addition to the repairs after its partial damage caused by the Great Fire. The property was divided into three separate houses sometime in the 19th century, and subsequently (sometime before 1886) reduced in width from 5 gables to the present 3 gables when part was demolished. The house stayed in the Hazelrigg family until 1831. After this, the new owner let the property. In 1913 the Northamptonshire Ladies Club purchased the building to use as its meeting place, sharing it with the local Women's Institute branch as well as the Northamptonshire Architectural & Archaeological Society. In the early 1960s it was acquired by the national architects practice of Marshman Warren Taylor who remained there until the late 1970s. After this the building sat empty for most of the 1980s, by which time it had been acquired by Northampton Borough Council. In 1989 it was refurbished by its tenant, another firm of architects. In 1994 English Heritage became the tenant, staying until 2004; after this the property was occupied by a succession of children's nurseries.; the property is presently occupied by a dance company. Pevsner describes the building thus: \\"Dates from 17th C. Altered later and reduced in size. Coursed rubble, three big dormers with semi-circular gables typical of the mid 17th C. Tall mullioned windows. Irregular fenestration. Doorway with flat classical surround. Staircase with twisted balusters.

In standard statistical models the effects of a categorical explanatory variable are assessed by comparing one category (or level) that is set as a benchmark against which all other categories are compared. The benchmark category is usually referred to as the 'reference' or 'base' category. In order for comparisons to be made the reference category is arbitrarily fixed to zero. Statistical data analysis software usually undertakes formal comparisons of whether or not each level of the categorical variable differs from the reference category. These comparisons generate the well known ‚Äòsignificance values‚Äô of parameter estimates (i.e., coefficients). Whilst it is straightforward to compare any one category with the reference category, it is more difficult to formally compare two other categories (or levels) of an explanatory variable with each other when neither is the reference category. This is known as the reference category problem. Quasi- variances are approximations of variances. Quasi-variances are statistics associated with the parameter estimates (coefficients) of the different levels of categorical explanatory variables within statistical models. Quasi- variances can be presented alongside parameter estimates to enable readers to assess differences between any combinations of parameter estimates for a categorical explanatory variable. The approach is beneficial because such comparisons are not usually possible without access to the full variance- covariance matrix for the estimates. Using quasi-variance estimates addresses the reference category problem. The underlying idea was first proposed by Ridout but the technique was set out by David Firth. The suitability of this technique for social science data analysis has been demonstrated. An on-line tool for the calculation of quasi-variance estimates is available and a short technical description of the methodology is provided. Quasi-variances can be calculated in Stata using the QV module and can also be calculated in R using the package qvcalc.

Early life Mac Todman was born on Christmas day 1923 in Tortola, British Virgin Islands. Like many successful Caribbean nationals, he began life as a teacher. In 1952 he married Audrey Creque, to whom he would remain married for life. Together they would have three children, one of whom predeceased him. Todman was also a regular lay preacher at the Road Town Methodist Church. Politics After he left teaching Mac Todman held various administrative posts during the colonial administration in the British Virgin Islands before the introduction of self- rule in 1967. This role took him first to Antigua, and later in 1957 to Barbados as part of the doomed Federation of the West Indies. Todman played in active role in supporting the right of the British Virgin Islands for political self-determination. He famously described the constitutional reforms which led to the 1950 general election as \\"an instrument minimal in its intent and its effect\\". He was also a longstanding member of BVI Public Service Commission, serving from 1970 until 1994, just two years before his death. For his services to Government he was awarded an OBE in 1970, and promoted to be a CBE in 1988. Law In 1967 he travelled to London and trained as a barrister at Gray's Inn, becoming the first Belonger from the British Virgin Islands to be called as a lawyer. In 1980 he was elevated to Queen's Counsel. He was the first, and still one of the very few, native-born lawyers from the British Virgin Islands to be so honoured. He founded his own practice, McW Todman & Co, which continues in existence today. He has been described as a lawyer of \\"exceptional ability.\\" In 1981 in the early days of the British Virgin Islands financial services industry, other than the Chief Minister of the British Virgin Islands Lavity Stoutt, Mac Todman was the only native-born member of the delegation sent by the Territory to negotiate with the United States in relation to the proposed cancellation of the double tax treaty between the two countries. He memorably described the process as one of \\"plea-gotiation\\" rather than \\"negotiation\\". Death On 7 March 1996 he died peacefully of natural causes. In his memory the BVI Bar Association instituted an annual lecture series in his name.

He finds Hand's story \\"pretty, poetic, but undistinguished ... a fine read, but lone survivor stories have been done many times before and I wasn't sure why this one stood out as the best story of the year.\\" Kelly's story he deems a disparaging response to Henry David Thoreau's Walden that demonstrates the author \\"didn‚Äôt understand what Thoreau was trying to do,\\" though he calls it \\"[a] fine story, well told as far as it goes, and if Kelly hadn't made the remarks he did at the beginning none of it would have bothered me.\\" Beagle's story he calls \\"a classic fantasy tale, well told,\\" noting that it is a sequel to the author's now-classic novel 'The Last Unicorn'. He finds Mirabelli's piece, \\"[t]he only nominated non-winner presented in the volume ... a well-told story; in fact, I liked it better than [Hand's] story that won the award, but it‚Äôs not science fiction.

The farm began to produce certified Vitamin A and Vitamin D milk from these cattle, whose genetics had gained a fair amount of popularity as the Van Hoosen Farm began branching out into retail sales during the Great Depression. The farm was run scientifically, and earned a reputation in being efficient as well as economically progressive which eventually earned her the title of \\"Master Farmer\\" by the Michigan Farmer in 1933. Her cattle won prizes in breeding and she was awarded the title of \\"Michigan Premier Breeder\\" for a total of nine years. = Work in education = Jones had made significant contributions to civic and educational affairs and served on the Rochester school board from 1924 to 1961, earning her a local nickname as the \\"first lady of Rochester.\\" She was elected for two six-year terms to the State Board of Agriculture, which was the governing board of Michigan State University. Dr. Jones was also a member and president of the Association of Governing Boards of State Universities and Allied Institutions. She made a generous contribution to Michigan State University, first by donating 350 acres of farm land, and eventually, in her will, the remainder of her property, which included a dozen houses.

From 1989 to 2003 she wrote a regular column titled Love Letters to Lubrication Engineers in the journal of the Society of Tribologists and Lubrication Engineers, and was remembered in a 2016 memorial in that journal as \\"the mother of the oil life monitor found in most GM cars, which is responsible for not having to change oil nearly as often as we did previously, or conversely, not ruining your engine if you don't change it often enough.\\" When presenting her with an achievement award in 1999, the Society of Women Engineers summarized Dr. Schwartz's career thusly: \\"Dr. Schwartz has examined engine oil degradation; wear, corrosion, and elastomer durability in engines; the effects of methanol and ethanol fuel on engines; and lubricants for air conditioners that use alternative refrigerants (other than Freon R12). Her work in these areas have been targeted towards: * obtaining the maximum useful life of engine oil * finding acceptable ways to use alternative energy sources * developing refrigerant systems that will not hurt the earth's ozone layer\\"  Awards and honors  Schwartz was named a fellow of the Society of Automotive Engineers in 1999 and was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 2000 \\"for contributions to lubrication engineering and for enriching the technical community through free-lance writing.\\" She additionally received many industry awards: * General Motors Kettering Award (1988): Awarded for computer-based method that assesses engine oil degradation as a function of oil temperature and displays the remaining life of the oil for the vehicle * General Motors McCuen Award (1993) * Gold Award from the Engineering Society of Detroit (1989) * Wilbur Deutsch Memorial Award from the Society of Tribologists and Lubrication Engineers (1987) * Colwell Award (1992) from the Society of Automotive Engineers * Distinguished Speaker Award (1995) from the Society of Automotive Engineers  Personal life  She married her husband Ron Schwartz in 1957.

She was later a schoolteacher and a professor at two historically black colleges and universities in Kansas and Missouri. The Mowbray Scholars Program at the Michigan State University Honors College is named in her honor.  Early life  Mowbray was born in Adrian, Michigan. Her father was a messenger for the secretary of state in Lansing, the state capital. Prior to her arrival in East Lansing, she graduated from George R. Smith College in Sedalia, Missouri, and for a year was an elementary schoolteacher in Missouri.  Michigan Agricultural College  Myrtle Craig's father persuaded her to attend the Michigan Agricultural College (M.A.C.) over the University of Michigan. Craig worked her way through college by waiting tables and working other side jobs, and did not live in the Women's Building on campus, either because she was not allowed to or could not afford to. She first boarded with the family of Addison M. Brown, who was the secretary to the State Board of Agriculture, and worked for the family as a cook; she later boarded with the family of Assistant Professor of Drawing Chance Newman before taking up residence in Lansing. She was one of four African American students on campus and, of those, the only woman, and was one of 15 women in the class of 1907. While Craig was one of the few African Americans at the university, she reflected on her experience by saying, \\"I didn't feel any different because of my race, there were sororities for girls, but I was so poor, I didn't have the time or money for those things.\\" During her time of study, she was affiliated with the A.M.E. Church in Lansing. She received her diploma on May 31, 1907, from U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt, the commencement speaker.  Teaching career  After graduating from the Michigan Agricultural College, Craig spent her next forty years teaching African American youth in Kansas and Missouri. From 1907 to 1910 she taught at Western University in Quindaro, Kansas, then taught domestic art for two years at Lincoln Institute in Jefferson City, Missouri, during which time she exhibited at the 1911 Missouri State Fair, winning a blue ribbon and other prizes for work in domestic arts. She then taught for three years at Sumner High School in Kansas City, Kansas; returned to teaching at Lincoln Institute from 1917 to 1922; taught elementary school in Fulton, Missouri, from 1922 to 1934; and again at Lincoln Institute from 1934 to 1947.  Personal life  Craig married Rev. W.H. Bowen in 1915, and married George H. Mowbray in 1951. At the time of her death on November 8, 1974, she lived in Kansas City, Missouri.

The worship of Kubjika as one of the main aspect of Adishakti was in its peak in 12th century CE. She is still praised in tantric practices that are followed in Kaula tradition.  Etymology  KubjikƒÅ means \\"to crook\\" or \\"to curve\\" in Sanskrit. Once lord NavƒÅtman embraced his consort Vakrika and before the copulation, she suddenly felt shy and bent her body earning the name, KubjikƒÅ, \\" the hunchback one\\" or Vakrika (crooked one).  Worship  A tantric text named \\"Kubjikamata\\" or \\"pisumata\\" dated back to 9th or 10th century CE describes the worship of Kubjika. Though she was very famous among the tantric tradition of Kashmir Valley in the past, Kubjika cult was not familiar among the devotees. Though it seemed that Kubjika was no longer worshipped in the valley either, in mid 1980s, she was discovered in a secret tantric worship that still exists among the Newar people. According to Chinjinimatatantra a text that praises Kubjika, Kaula tradition was taught to four disciples who were sent in the four directions. The disciple sent to the west founded the Western Stream (PascimƒÅmnaya) of Kaulism, the cult of Navatman and Kubjika. The eastern disciple created PurvƒÅmnaya, the cult of Kulƒìsvari while the northern disciple taught UttarƒÅmnaya, the cult of KƒÅlasangarshini. the Southern tradition was known as Dakshinamnaya, the cult of KƒÅmƒìsvari. Nowadays,the southern Srikula sect of Kamesvari and northern Kalikula sect of Kali are still known as Shaktism sects while the other two (kubjika and Trika) are usually identified as Saivism sects along with other Kashmiri Saivite traditions.

It features six video games originally developed by Capcom and released for the Nintendo Entertainment System, all based on animated series from the television block The Disney Afternoon.. The compilation was released on April 18, 2017 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. Gameplay All six games in the collection are primarily side-scrolling platform games. The games retain their original style and gameplay, but the compilation also includes the ability to rewind game time to correct mistakes, and time attack and boss rush modes, in which players able to compete in online leaderboards. Additionally, the compilation includes concept art, music, and additional assets created for the original games. Development The ports to modern systems were developed by Digital Eclipse. According to John Faciane, associate producer for the collection, the idea of compiling the various Capcom games developed in association with The Disney Afternoon show block was already in place when he joined Capcom in July 2016. He said that there was growing fan interest in these games after Digital Eclipse released the Mega Man Legacy Collection in August 2015, and when he had joined, the company was in the final stages of figuring out which games to include in the collection. The ports are based on the studio's Eclipse Engine, also used in the Mega Man Legacy Collection, which is able to take the original ROM images and decompile them so that they can then re-execute the code in a virtual machine developed for modern systems. The studio recognized, like many games of the 8-bit era, that these titles were generally difficult compared to more contemporary games, and incorporated features like save states and the rewind feature to help players. Some of the additional content for the game were from archives that Digital Eclipse's head of restoration Frank Cifaldi had made when he \\"pirated\\" the games as a youth. Reception The Disney Afternoon Collection received mostly positive reviews on upon release, earning average scores of 78 out of 100 for the PC version, 76 out of 100 for the PlayStation 4 version, and 75 out of 100 for the Xbox One version from Metacritic. Many reviewers commented on the appeal of the games being potentially limited to players familiar with games from the 8-bit era. In his review for Gamespot, Jason D'Aprile called the collection \\"a refined time capsule that covers a very specific chapter in gaming history,\\" and that the appeal was the entire package rather than any specific game, elaborating that \\"While these games might not be anything to get overly excited about individually, in a package that includes plenty of history and extras, this collection is a nostalgic curiosity with heart.\\" Samuel Claiborn of IGN called the compilation \\"a collection aimed squarely at fans of old-fashioned platformers that makes little effort to update them for modern conventions,\\" and that the quality of each game varied, calling them \\"three hits and three duds.\\" The website would additionally praise the title's extra features and art gallery. Ray Carsillo of EGM called the title \\"pure nostalgia,\\" but that it could be recommended to newer Disney fans \\"as long as they can appreciate the 8-bit ‚Äúvintage‚Äù look.\\" However, the publication remarked that the game's rewind feature could sometimes cause crashes or slowdown.

Etymology  The toponym Ghazni is known to have existed prior to the Islamic period. Classical authors mention the name in various forms, including the Greek G√°zaca (), and the Chinese Ho(k)-si(k)-na.  History of the Ghaznavid city  =Background= Although not a member of the Ghaznavid family, the foundation of the Ghazni as a Ghaznavid city can be attributed to the Turkic slave commander of the Samanid Empire, Alp-Tegin, who after his unsuccessful attempt to put the Samanid prince Nasr on the throne, was forced to flee from the court in Bukhara. In 963, Alp-Tegin accompanied by his personal guard of Turkic slave-soldiers and group of Iranian ghazis left for Ghazni, which was a small town in Zabulistan ruled by the local Lawik dynasty. He seized Ghazni from Abu Bakr Lawik, a kinsman of the Kabulshah, and secured his position by receiving an investiture from the Samanids as the governor of Ghazni. Alp-Tegin died a few months later (September 963) and was succeeded by his son Abu Ishaq Ibrahim, who briefly lost control of Ghazni after an invasion by its former ruler, Abu Bakr Lawik. However, he managed to regain it with Samanid aid. Some time later, Abu Ishaq Ibrahim died and was succeeded by a Turkic slave commander named Bilgetegin. =Under the Ghaznavid rulers= Dirham of Mahmud minted in Ghazni in 1024. Ferdowsi with the other poets from the court of Ghazni. In 1052, the rebellious slave-soldier (ghulam) Toghrul seized Ghazni, had Abd al-Rashid killed, and had the sultan's men jailed in a stronghold. However, Toghrul's reign lasted only 15 days; he was defeated and killed by Ghaznavid loyalists, who put Farrukh-zad (r. 1053‚Äì1059) on the throne. The city's good fortune came to an unexpected and ruthless end when it was sacked and set on fire in 1151 by the Ghurid Sultan Ala al-Din Husayn (r. 1149-1161). All the tombs of the Ghaznavid rulers, with the exception of Mahmud, Mas'ud I and Ibrahim, were broken open and the remains burned. From these events, Ala ad-Din Husayn gained the nickname, JahƒÅns≈´z (meaning the World Burner).C.E.

It was located at 9 Swallow Street, on the edge of Mayfair and close to Piccadilly Circus. The club's launch on 22 June 1966 was attended by many artists and celebrities, including the Beatles, members of the Rolling Stones, Michael Caine, Julie Christie, David Bailey and Mary Quant. Like the Ad Lib and the Scotch of St. James, the club was a popular meeting place for rock musicians and other artists until trends changed in the London scene. Sibylla's was conceived as an exclusive venue for leading figures in the Swinging London era. Its major shareholders and owners were advertising copywriter Kevin Macdonald, photographer Terry Howard, and property developer Bruce Higham, while baronet and champion horse rider William Pigott-Brown provided much of the finance for the venture. George Harrison of the Beatles was given a shareholding in the club, in return for the publicity his association would bring, and disc jockey Alan Freeman was also a shareholder. The club's interior was designed by David Mlinaric. Since Sibylla's closed, the site has continued to be a nightclub location. Concept and launch Part of the archway marking the southern end of Swallow Street (on Piccadilly). The site at number 9 had been home to nightclubs for over 50 years before Sibylla's. In their plan for the club, Kevin Macdonald, Terry Howard and Bruce Higham conceived of a meeting place for the elite of Swinging London. Higham said the clientele they envisaged \\"[have] a kind of self-confidence, an awareness, which they transpose to their environment\\". As a great-nephew of newspaper proprietor Lord Northcliffe, MacDonald was from an aristocratic family, yet his interest was in establishing an elite that was not governed along lines of social class. Sir William Pigott-Brown, a baronet, provided half the funds for the venture. Guinness heir Tara Browne was another of the financial backers. George Harrison of the Beatles, a friend of Howard, was given a 10 per cent shareholding, on the understanding that his name could be used to attract publicity, and disc jockey Alan Freeman was also a stakeholder. The site at 9 Swallow Street, on the eastern edge of Mayfair, had been a nightclub venue since 1915. The building's new interiors were designed by David Mlinaric, who said at the time that his concept was to give the club \\"a feeling of under-decoration\\" to match contemporary fashions in clothes design. Macdonald, Howard and Higham named the venue after Sibylla Edmonstone, a London socialite and the granddaughter of American entrepreneur Marshall Field. The club was run under the company name of Kevin Macdonald Associated Ltd. Sibylla's was launched with a private party held on 22 June 1966. One of the three owners declared that the club was \\"the first Classic London Discotheque\\". Among the guests were the Beatles, who had just finished recording their Revolver album that day. The full guest list was later published in Queen magazine and included Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones; actors Michael Caine, Julie Christie and Jane Birkin; and fashion figures such as David Bailey, Mary Quant and Michael Rainey. Writing in Queen, television presenter Cathy McGowan said that \\"A more glittering line up of guests could hardly be imagined.\\" Popularity and decline Carnaby Street, circa 1966. The owners of Sibylla's sought to attract only the most elite figures from the burgeoning Swinging London cultural scene. In his book on 1960s London, Shawn Levy states that, in their policy for Sibylla's, Macdonald, Howard and Higham allowed exclusivity based on \\"hipness\\" to replace the old class divisions of \\"breeding, schooling and wealth\\". Levy adds, \\"Of course, it worked\\", as 800 of the people they contacted agreed to become members of the club, at an annual fee of around ¬£8. Along with the Ad Lib and later the Scotch of St. James, the club was a popular meeting place for rock musicians such as the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. Speaking to journalist and author Jonathan Aitken in 1966, Macdonald said that Sibylla's represented the classless society of Swinging London. He said that he and his co-owners had brought together \\"the new aristocracy in Britain ‚Ä¶ the current young meritocracy of style, taste and sensitivity\\", namely: \\"the top creative people; the top exporters; the top brains; the top artists; the top social people\\". According to MacDonald, in its \\"marrying up\\" of working-class artists and photographers with members of high society, Sibylla's was the realisation of the psychedelic aesthetic, a trend that had emerged in contemporary music that year. The club's manager was Laurie O'Leary, who had previously managed Esmeralda's Barn, a nightclub in Knightsbridge owned by the Kray twins. The musical acts who performed at Sibylla's included Jokers Wild, a band featuring future Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour, and were booked through an agency owned by the Krays' elder brother, Charlie Kray. Freddie Foreman, a convicted associate of the Kray twins, later wrote that, despite the restrictive door policy at Sibylla's, \\"I always welcome at the club\\" due to O'Leary's presence. In October 1966, Macdonald, who was suffering from depression, died after jumping from a rooftop in west London. Author Steve Turner describes him as an early casualty among London's psychedelic drug users, at a time when the full psychological effects of LSD were not widely known. According to cultural historian David Simonelli, MacDonald's suicide was indicative of the downside of \\"the changes in British society and its sociocultural image\\" in the psychedelic era. Tara Browne, who was a regular at the club in the company of the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, died after crashing his sports car into a parked van in December 1966. In 1968, O'Leary left Sibylla's to manage the Speakeasy Club, which had become the new night spot for musicians and record industry executives. Sibylla's closed that same year, as a result of what Levy terms \\"the vagaries of fashion among its In Crowd membership\\". Following its closure, 9 Swallow Street continued to be a nightclub venue. On 24 October 2016, the Aristocrat opened on the site, applying a restrictive door policy that, according to GQ magazine, outdoes all rival local clubs.

Spearheaded by Edna Beilenson, co-proprietor of the Peter Pauper Press, a group of women active in fine press and book making collaborated to produce a feminist work entitled Bookmaking on the Distaff Side, published in 1937. Beilenson, Jane Grabhorn, Bruce Rogers, and others contributed, and convinced Frederic Goudy to include a memorial to his wife, which he later published separately as Bertha M. Goudy: Recollections by One Who Knew Her Best (Marlboro, NY: The Village Press, 1939), and set in Bertham type. He had named his hundredth typeface, Bertham, in honor of his wife (\\"Bertha M.\\"). Female members of the same group of friends formed the Distaff Press, which later republished selections from Bookmaking on the Distaff Side, along with additional contributions, to produce Bertha S. Goudy: First Lady of Printing in 1958. This \\"remembrance of the distaff side of the Village Press\\" was issued as a fine press, limited edition publication, in the spirit of Bertha Goudy's own private press productions, hand-bound and hand-printed.

Dragsters, also commonly called \\"diggers\\", can be broadly placed in three categories, based on the fuel they use: gasoline, methanol, and nitromethane. They are most commonly single-engined, though twin-engined and quad-engined designs did race in the 1950s and 1960s. The design of dragsters evolved from the front-engined rail (named for the exposed frame rails) of the earliest days of drag racing, into the \\"slingshot\\" (with the driver between or behind the rear tires, or \\"slicks\\") of the early to middle 1960s, to the \\"modern\\" type common in the 1970s. Depending on the class they run in, dragsters can be injected or supercharged (or turbocharged), with a variety of possible engines. The engines are most often derived from automobiles'; some early examples used surplus aircraft engines. Today, they may also be electric. Dragsters are distinct from \\"bodied\\" cars such as funny cars and gassers, as well as from Altereds.  History  =Front engine= The front engine dragster came about due to engines initially being located in the car's frame in front of the driver. The driver sits angled backward, over the top of the differential in a cockpit situated between the two rear tires, a design originating with Mickey Thompson's Panorama City Special in 1954, as a way of improving traction. This position led to many drivers being maimed when catastrophic clutch failures occurred. Due to limited traction, some dragsters with four rear drive wheels were attempted as well as designs with twin engines. The final Top Fuel driver to win a National Hot Rod Association national event in a front engine dragster was Art Marshall on August 6, 1972 at the Le Grandnational outside of Montreal, Canada. =Rear engine= The drawbacks of front-engine designs (including fatalities) led to several attempts at rear- engined cars. Among them were pioneering rear-engined dragsters (and funny cars, including Doug Thorley's and Dave Bowman's\\"Gallery: The Best of 1970s Drag Racing\\", written by Dave Kommel on April 25, 2017, at Hot Rod online (retrieved 22 May 2017)) were Steve Swaja's AA/Gas Wedge I from 1963, Roger Lindwall's 1966 Top Fuel Re-Entry and Kent Fuller's fueller Sidewinder III, both in 1969.Taylor, Thom. \\"Tony Nancy Gas Dragster\\", \\"Roger Lindwall Re- Entry\\", and \\"Kent Fuller Sidewinder III\\", in \\"Beauty Beyond the Twilight Zone\\", pp.34, 38, and 42.NHRA.com (retrieved 24 May 2017) In mid-1969, Drag Wedge, built by Logghe Brothers for Andy Granatelli, debuted, and later that year, prodded to action by the death of John Mulligan, Woody Gilmore (following the mid-engined Funny Car he built for Doug Thorley) and Pat Foster developed a rear-engined fuel dragster, which was unveiled in December.Burgess, Phil, National Dragster editor. \\"Front to back: The rear- engine transition\\", written 20 February 2015, at NHRA.com (retrieved 1 November 2018) Driven by Foster, the Gilmore car ran just once, getting up on its single rear wheelie bar and breaking in two at around , at Lions Drag Strip.Burgess, Phil, National Dragster editor. \\"Front to back: The rear-engine transition\\", written 20 February 2015, at NHRA.com (retrieved 1 November 2018) Gilmore and Foster built a similar car, Pawnbroker, for Dwane Ong, incorporating the lessons of the previous car; it debuted in 1970, and proved considerably better.Burgess, Phil, National Dragster editor. \\"Front to back: The rear-engine transition\\", written 20 February 2015, at NHRA.com (retrieved 1 November 2018) In August, Ong won the 1970 AHRA Nationals in the car.Burgess, Phil, National Dragster editor. \\"Front to back: The rear-engine transition\\", written 20 February 2015, at NHRA.com (retrieved 1 November 2018) Pawnbroker won the American Hot Rod Association Summernats in Long Island, New York, the first national event win for a rear-engined car, with a pass of 6.83 at .Hot Rod staff writers. \\"The History Of Hot Rodding ‚Äì 1970s\\", written 29 August 2013, at Hot Rod Network (retrieved 19 June 2017) \\"Big Daddy\\" Don Garlits examined the car and was so impressed with the forward view, he could not understand why everyone did not drive one--and why it did not work.Burgess, Phil, National Dragster editor. \\"Front to back: The rear-engine transition\\", written 20 February 2015, at NHRA.com (retrieved 1 November 2018) Around the same time, Bernie Schacker's rear-engined car, the first with a rear wing, was the first to run in the sixes, with a 6.98 at , at New York National Speedway's Spring Nationals (an event sanctioned by none of the national bodies).Burgess, Phil, National Dragster editor. \\"Front to back: The rear-engine transition\\", written 20 February 2015, at NHRA.com (retrieved 1 November 2018) In April 1970, Mark Williams' car, built for Mike Dollins and Dan Widner (at a cost of only US$2,111.16), first appeared; its wheelbase was significantly longer than the usual for fuellers at the time.Burgess, Phil, National Dragster editor. \\"Front to back: The rear-engine transition\\", written 20 February 2015, at NHRA.com (retrieved 1 November 2018) The car ran well, but required new driving techniques; Dollins and Widner lacked the money to continue racing it, and it was sold to a Colorado team, which switched to a hemi (rather than the usual .Burgess, Phil, National Dragster editor. \\"Front to back: The rear-engine transition\\", written 20 February 2015, at NHRA.com (retrieved 1 November 2018) Others rear-engined cars included ones built by Art Malone (before working with Garlits on his), the National Speed Products Research carbuilt by Frank Huszar (Race Car Specialties) on a stunning wheelbase; driven by Chuck Tanko, it was overweight, at , and could only achieve 7.20s at , never running in competition.Burgess, Phil, National Dragster editor. \\"Front to back: The rear-engine transition\\", written 20 February 2015, at NHRA.com (retrieved 1 November 2018) On March 8, 1970, at Lions Drag Strip,NHRA.com (retrieved 24 May 2017 Garlits was driving Swamp Rat XIII, also called the Wynnscharger, a slingshot rail, when the vehicle suffered a catastrophic failure, and the car broke in half in front of the cockpit.NHRA.com photo (retrieved 24 May 2017) Garlits returned to Pomona with a brand new mid-engined car, Swamp Rat XIV, in 1971.

She was among the first generation of women to take the Classical Tripos examinations at the University of Cambridge, and was the only person to be placed in the top division of the first class at the end of her third year, in 1887. She married the Master of Trinity College, Henry Montagu Butler, in August 1888, becoming the leading hostess in Cambridge. She published a version of Book VII of Herodotus' Histories in 1891. Early life and education Punch published a cartoon by George du Maurier about her examination success. As she was the only person in the first class of the Classical Tripos that year, placing above all the men, Mr Punch and his dog Toby are shown ushering her into a first class compartment which is for ladies only. She was born Agnata Ramsay in London on 28 January 1867, the daughter of Sir James Henry Ramsay, 10th Baronet of Bamff, and Elizabeth Mary Charlotte n√©e Scott-Kerr. She came from a family with a history of academic achievement as her father published books on history, her uncle George Gilbert Ramsay was a professor of humanity at Glasgow University and her grandfather, Sir George Ramsay, published works on philosophy. Brought up in Perthshire, she attended St Leonards School in St Andrews. In 1884, she went as the Misses Metcalfes' Scholar to Girton College, Cambridge, where she read Classics. Her achievement in being the only candidate in 1887 to be placed in the top division of the first class in the Classical Tripos examinations ‚Äì thereby being placed above all of the men in her year ‚Äì was marked with a cartoon in Punch which was entitled 'Honour to Agnata Frances Ramsay' and showed her boarding a train's first-class compartment marked 'For Ladies Only'. Personal life du Maurier cartoon in Punch about the 'crib for Herodotus' While a student, she worked hard at her studies but also found time for outdoor pursuits which she enjoyed, including tennis and skating. She was president of the debating society and, while she did not speak often, she impressed others with her eloquence and humility. In August 1888, she married the Master of Trinity, Henry Montagu Butler. They had met at the Cambridge Greek Play, a performance of Oedipus Rex in November 1887 for which Butler had arranged a large party of 42. He had included Agnata because of her prowess in the classics but he later wrote that it was her \\"goodness ... not her Greek and Latin, which have stolen my heart\\". Even so, he allowed that, on their honeymoon, they \\"read a great deal of Greek together\\". They had three sons, James, Gordon, and Nevile. Their first child was born while she was working on her edition of Herodotus, which prompted Punch to run another punning cartoon, in which she was portrayed as ordering 'a crib for Herodotus'. James became an academic, and was Regius Professor of Modern History at Cambridge University; Gordon was killed in action in Egypt in 1916; Nevile became a diplomat, serving as British Ambassador to Brazil and to the Netherlands. After the death of her husband in 1918, she remained in Cambridge, where she was involved in the local Christian Science church. She died in Harrow on 27 May 1931. Classical scholarship At Cambridge, she worked on a version of Book VII (Polymnia) of Herodotus' Histories. It was published in the original Ancient Greek with notes in 1891, as part of Macmillan's Classical series for colleges and schools. She may have been the first British woman to produce an edition of a classical author. In 2006, Mary Beard wrote that \\"Agnata Ramsey was one of the most notorious casualties of the university marriage market\\", as she \\"did very little classics ever after\\". Her husband, Montagu Butler, was friends with the poet laureate, Alfred, Lord Tennyson. In 1892 the couple visited Farringford House, where she and Tennyson discussed classical works such as the Alcaics of Horace and Sappho. She recalled his scepticism about the recent discovery of Troy, Another famous classicist was A. E. Housman who wrote in 1911 to thank her after a visit, Prize A prize for the best classics students in their second or third year was established and awarded by the Butlers ‚Äì the Agnata Butler Prize. Winners included Caroline Skeel (1893/4), Dorothy Tarrant (1907) and Barbara Wootton (1917).

He is noted for having been a teacher of George Gershwin. Biography Hambitzer was born into a musical family in Beloit, Wisconsin. The year of his birth is variously given as either 1878 or 1881. His great-grandfather was a violinist in the Russian royal court and his father owned a music store in Milwaukee. He studied with Julius Albert Jahn and Hugo Kahn after which he played in the orchestra of the Arthur Friend Stock Company. He taught piano, violin, and cello at the Wisconsin Conservatory of Music. In 1908, he moved to New York City where he joined Joseph Knecht's orchestra at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, usually appearing as piano soloist. During that time he lived on the Upper West Side of Manhattan where he wrote music and opened a music school. Among his most notable pupils was George Gershwin, who became one of America's leading composers. In 1914, Hambitzer's wife died of tuberculosis and four years later he died of the same disease. George once said that Charles was his first major musical influence in life. Nathaniel Shilkret, a noted composer and conductor, was a member of the Waldorf-Astoria Orchestra during the period that Hambitzer was there. Shilkret's autobiography includes a brief discussion of Hambitzer's life, including the following comments about their common time with the Waldorf- Astoria Orchestra: \\"Hambitzer played viola, oboe, bassoon, cello and organ, but [during this period], never piano.\\" Shilkret said that Frank Longo, the then-Waldorf-Astoria Orchestra pianist, dared Hambitzer to show how good he was when an orchestra member told Longo to take piano lessons from Hambitzer. Shilkret writes about Hambitzer's response: \\"Hambitzer said, 'I have not touched the piano for years, but I'll try.' He sat down and played one classic composition after another. He could play any number we suggested. He was the most natural pianist I ever heard--barring no one--and his memory was phenomenal. Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, Schubert, Chopin, Schumann, Liszt. . . Pieces just poured out of him flawlessly. . . . Of course, Hambitzer's performance got around, and in a short time he became the busiest teacher in New York. . . . I studied piano with him.\\"Shilkret, Nathaniel, ed. Shell, Niel and Barbara Shilkret, Nathaniel Shilkret: Sixty Years in the Music Business, Scarecrow Press, Lanham, Maryland, 2005.

As an A&R; executive at the Victor Talking Machine and a conductor who had conducted for very large number of the finest musicians of his era, Shilkret was eminantly qualified to judge a musician's talent. Compositions  Hambitzer was noted for his prodigious musical talent and feverish compositional skill. He wrote many songs, and his work also included orchestral tone poems and incidental music for plays by Shakespeare and other playwrights.

Konstantin Stanislavski, the MAT director, was her husband. In 1933 Lilina was designated as a Meritorious Artist of RSFSR.Maria Petrovna Lilina. Biography at the Moscow Art Theatre site Career Lilina was a founding member of the MAT troupe which she joined in 1898. Her two breakthrough performances, which brought her to fame, were Masha in The Seagull and Sonya in Uncle Vanya, both praised for \\"fitting perfectly Chekhov's aesthetics.\\" Also lauded were her Natasha in Three Sisters; later Varya in The Cherry Orchard and Nina Zarechnaya in the renewed Seagull. In 1906-1915 Lilina played three parts in Alexander Griboyedov's Woe from Wit: Liza, a sly and clever peasant servant, as well as graceful Countess the Granddaughter, and Khlyostova, the latter with satyrical verve and wit. Her tandem with Stanislavsky in Leo Tolstoy's The Living Corpse (he Prince Abrezkov, she Anna Dmitriyevna) has been described as \\"the living amalgam of the fullness of life and the precision of the expression.\\" Lilina was said to have \\"understood perfectly the electrically charged dynamics of the Dostoyevsky prose, full of emotional overload,\\" and was stunning as Karpukhina in The Uncle's Dream and as Khromonozhka (Limping Girl) in Nikolai Stavrogin (based upon Besy), according to Inna Solovyova. \\"Many considered her the most subtle and deep of the MAT actresses,\\" this critic argued. Lilina has always regarded her husband as her teacher and Stanislavsky often referred to her as his 'best ever student'. He dedicated his book The Actor's Work on Himself (–†–∞–±–æ—Ç–∞ –∞–∫—Ç–µ—Ä–∞ –Ω–∞–¥ —Å–æ–±–æ–π) to Lilina.

As a Captain, she piloted the Dublin-based Rescue 116 helicopter. She was killed in the 2017 Irish Coast Guard Rescue 116 crash in March 2017. Background Fitzpatrick had originally wanted to join Aer Lingus, but didn't get accepted. The Irish Air Corps was hiring pilots, so she began taking helicopter lessons. She was one of the first women to pilot an aircraft for the Irish Marine Emergency Service, the precursor to the Coast Guard. She was initially stationed with the Shannon-based search and rescue team, before transferring to Waterford in 2002 where she became chief pilot of the Rescue 117 helicopter, a Sikorsky S-61N. She later joined the Dublin Coast Guard crew and was pilot in charge of Rescue 116, a Sikorsky S-92A. In 2010, Fitzpatrick and her crew received the \\"Best of Irish Award\\" for rescuing an airplane pilot who had crashed into the Irish Sea. In August 2013, Fitzpatrick and her colleague, Captain Carmel Kirby, made Irish aviation history when they crewed the first all-female mission in the Irish Coast Guard helicopter service. In 2007, she created a video with the Irish Bishops‚Äô Conference, on the theme of \\"alcohol and the challenge of moderation.\\" She was also known for her starring role in Rescue 117, a 2011 documentary series on RT√â which gave behind-the-scenes access to the helicopter search and rescue service. Death EI-ICR, the aircraft involved in the accident Fitzpatrick died after her search and rescue team's helicopter, Rescue 116, crashed into the Atlantic Ocean while providing top cover for the Sligo-based search and rescue helicopter, Rescue 118, during a rescue mission off the west coast of County Mayo, Ireland. Fitzpatrick was found and later pronounced dead at Mayo University Hospital in Castlebar. The body belonging to one of the missing crew was found in the cockpit section of the aircraft on 24 March by Navy divers and it was retrieved on 26 March after which it was identified as that of co-pilot Captain Mark Duffy. Two other members of the crew, Winchman Ciar√°n Smith and Winch Operator Paul Ormsby remained missing and memorial services were held for them in May 2017 and June 2017 respectively.

It was first described from the eastern Mediterranean where it is an invasive species having colonised the coasts of the Levantine Sea from the Red Sea by Lessepsian migration from the Red Sea via the Suez Canal. Description Ixa monodi has a transversely ovoid carapace which is laterally stretched to form a process on each side which is cylindrical and covered in tubercles. The forehead is forked and the orbits are deep and completely overhang the eyes with three indentations in their outer margins. The posterior margin bears two granulose tubercles. The dorsal surface of the carapace has two longitudinal grooves which fork before the long. thin chelipeds. The carapace is pale reddish-orange in colour with more intensely coloured granules, the lateral processes are paler towards their tips, the chelipeds are orange and the pereopods are paler orange. The largest individual recorded had a carapace length of 59.2 mm. Distribution Ixa monodi is native to the Red Sea and was probably originally identified as Ixa cylindrus by Dr. Theodore Monod in 1938 from the Gulf of Suez but it was definitely described in 1956 from specimens collected by Holthuis & Gottlieb off the coast of south- easternTurkey at Mersin Bay in 1955. It has since been recorded from Israel, Syria, Rhodes and Egypt. Habitat Ixa monodi occurs on sandy or muddy substrates in shallow waters between 14m and 60m in depth. Naming Ixa monodi is named in honour of Dr. Theodore Monod, who was director of the Institut Francais d'Afrique Noire at Dakar, as he was the first scientist to publish an illustration of this species. The specimen collected by Holthuis and Gottlieb in Mersin Bay in 1955 is the holotype of Ixa monodi and has been preserved in the collection of the Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie in Leiden.

It features 23 rooms and encompasses 9200 square feet. Henn owned eight acres surrounding the house, on which he grew grapes which he sold commercially. Henn lost his fortune during the great depression and, unable to pay his municipal taxes, he turned his house and his property over to the City of Euclid on stipulation that he be allowed to reside on the premises until his death, which occurred in 1947. The adjoining land became Sims Park, and the mansion was used as classrooms, the Euclid Board of Education's offices, and then as the location of Euclid's Recreation Department. The structure was allowed to deteriorate in the 1990s, and the city proposed to demolish it in 1996, upon which the Friends of the Henn Mansion was founded. The Albert W.

She founded the National Urban League Guild in 1942 in order to raise funds in support of the League's racial equality programs. Lester B. Granger, then director of the Urban League, challenged Moon personally to help the league become 'financially stable.' At first an informal group, it eventually developed bylaws and held elections, with Moon serving as president until her death 1990. The Guild's most well- known fundraising event was its annual Beaux-Arts Ball, a charity gala with a different theme each year. The Ball was held in various locations in New York City, starting in the Savoy Ballroom, moving to Rockefeller Center in 1948, and then to the Waldorf Astoria in 1960. Winthrop Rockefeller, also a board member of the National Urban League, signed the invitations to the 1948 event along with Moon, when the move to Rockefeller Center proved controversial. =Later career= Moon served on the national advisory council for Department of Health, Education, and Welfare's Food and Drug Committee from 1972 to 1976. Moon received recognition for her decades of service to the Guild in later life, receiving both the Equal Opportunity Award from the National Urban League and the President's Volunteer Action Award from President George H.

In an edited version it made its way into the In Twilight (–í —Å—É–º–µ—Ä–∫–∞—Ö), 1887 collection, published in Saint Petersburg. In 1898 the Tilde Press released it as a separate edition.

Khudozhestvennaya Literatura. Moscow, 1960. Vol. 4, pp. 540-541 Synopsis The protagonist takes a trip across the Goltva river on the Easter Eve to visit a local church and enjoy the nightly Easter festivities. On his way he is engaged in a conversation with a monk ferryman named Ieronym, a slightly eccentric 30-something man who is deeply shattered by the recent death of his best friend and mentor, monk Nikolai. The latter appears to have been a genius master of Akathist, who had never in his life had one single reader or listener of his wonderful stories, beside Ieronym... The protagonist returns by the same ferry, disturbed by the cruel contrast between the joyful, flamboyant church service, and the grief and loneliness of this extremely sensitive person, so forsaken in this world, on the other... Where nobody had even cared to send him a changer, so that he now has to start his second shift in a row. Reception The theatre historian Nikolai Drizen (in his 1929 essay) quoted Alexey Pleshcheyev as saying: \\"Reading [In Twilight], I felt as though Turgenev's aura was embracing me... The same placid poetry of prose, these wondrous descriptions of nature...\\" The story that impressed him most was \\"Easter Eve\\", according to Drizen.N.V. Drizen. Chekhov and His Plays.

Speaking of the monk Nikolai character, he interpreted him as another loser, similar to Likharev from \\"On the Way\\" [–ù–∞ –ø—É—Ç–∏, published in Severny Vestnik, No.11, 1888]. Chekhov felt baffled. \\"What kind of loser he is? He'd had an enviable life. Was close to God, knew not of hunger, was endowed with literary gift... Dividing people into losers and winners is too narrow an approach,\\" he wrote to Alexey Suvorin in a letter dated 3 November 1888. References External links * –°–≤—è—Ç–æ—é –Ω–æ—á—å—é.

When a subsea power cable is laid, there is an area where the cable can be subjected to increased dynamic forces, which the cable is not necessarily designed to survive over the lifetime of the installation. Cable protection systems are used to allow the specification, and thus cost, of a subsea power cable to be reduced, by removing the need to include additional armoring of the cable. The resulting cables can be produced more cheaply, whilst still providing the 20 years + lifetime required. Offshore windfarm developers in particular have adopted the use of Cable protection systems due to the dynamic area where the cable comes from the seabed and enters the monopile/J-tube. This is in part due to the potential for localised scouring to occur near the structure. A CPS generally consists of three sections, a Centraliser or Monopile interface, a protection system for the dynamic area, and a protection system for the static area. The installation of J-Tubes for offshore renewable monopiles was viewed as a costly approach, and a 'latching' type of cable protection system which penetrates the outer wall of the monopile, via a specifically designed angled aperture enables the simplification of monopile design, and removes the need for additional works post pile driving which usually involved the use of divers. This approach is becoming the industry standard in monopile design, assisting developers to reduce their costs for construction.  History  Articulated half-pipe Cable protections systems have traditionally been used for the protection of cables at shore landings, and other areas where cable damage could be envisaged, and burial was not practical. Patents for variations of articulated pipe cable protections date back to 1929. The system was described as a cable armor shield > \\"adapted to protect the cable from damage and wear occasioned by rubbing on > rocks, contacting with ships, anchors or other objects, and has for its > object to provide a practical flexible armor shield of this class which can > be readily applied to the cable at any point along its length.\\" From their outset cable protection systems were designed to be simple, effective, and easy to assemble. The systems consisted of a series of half shells which had a convex flange at one end and a larger socket flange at the other allowing the sections to form a flexible universal joint connection between them. Due to the intended use of heavy cast or forged metals they also had the added advantage of increasing the weight of the cable being installed, thus reducing movement on the seabed. Over the years innovations have occurred improving the articulation of the joints with modern articulated pipes being more akin to ball-joints, and some manufacturers providing 'boltless' articulated pipes, thus saving assembly time. Changes in the metallurgy have also happened, leading to most half shell articulated pipe now being made from ductile iron, due to its improved strength and elasticity characteristics. Today these articulated pipes are also utilised for their bend restriction properties, allowing them to be utilised as bend restrictors for the protected cable.  Design considerations  Cable protection systems are predominantly designed to protect the system from damage throughout the lifetime of the cable caused by fatigue, overbending of the cable, and to provide protection of the cable until it reaches an area of burial. = Design life = The cable protection system will be designed to provide protection for a specific lifetime, the 'design life' of the system, which may vary dependent upon the conditions encountered. = Overbending of cable = Overbending of the cable occurs when the cable is bent in a radius of less than the minimum bending radius defined by the manufacturer. Although the cable may initially survive the overbending, this can lead to subsequent fatigue within the cable ultimately leading to cable failure. The CPS selected should maintain a radius which is greater than the specified minimum bend radius. = Fatigue of CPS/cable within = Subsea cable protection systems can encounter wear due to movement, and general changes in composition due to being submerged for a prolongued period of time, such as corrosion or changes in polymer based compounds. Consideration should be given to the induced effects on the CPS resulting from the dynamic elements in the environment. Simple changes such as changes in temperature, current or salinity can result in changes in the ability of the CPS to offer protection for the life of the cable. It is advisable to carefully assess the potential effects of movement of the CPS, relating to the dynamic abilities of the cable. The CPS may withstand the worst conditions seen over a 100yr period, but would the cable inside the CPS survive these movements. In some instances, such as shore ends for fibre optic cables where rocky outcrops are present, dynamic influences can be reduced by securing the articulated pipe to the seabed rock, thus reducing the degree of movement remaining. Some manufacturers have performed independent empirical testing to provide a simulated 25yr life cycle of the dynamic forces applicable to their product in order to provide customers with improved confidence in the survivability of the system. Another cause for failure of subsea power cables is caused by overheating, which can occur where a cable is contained within a CPS without adequate ability to dissipate the heat produced by the cable. These lead to early fatigue of the cable insulation, necessitating the replacement of the cable. Subsea cable incidents account for around 77% of the total global cost of wind farm losses. Since 2007 this percentage, which has varied between 70% and 80%, is statistically reported year after year. = Seabed stability = Seabed stability is an important factor associated with cable protection systems. Should the cable protection system be too buoyant, it is less likely to remain in contact with the seabed, thus the CPS is more likely to require additional remedial stability measures, such as installation of concrete mattresses, rockbags, or rockdumping. = Suspension strength = When a CPS is being installed to interface with a monopile structure, there is likely to be seabed scouring to some degree. Should the scouring become excessive, the CPS may be suspended within a scour hole, and needs to be capable of supporting its own weight, and that of the cable within. Failure to sustain this loading scenario will lead to failure of the CPS, which will in turn allow the forces to act upon the cable within, ultimately leading to cable damage. = Installation = Within the renewables market in particular, installation of CPS's are preferred to be completely diverless, as this reduces the developers cost, and removes risk to human life through diving in a hazardous area. = Removal/Reinstallation = A final consideration for CPS is that of removal of the cable should a failure occur. Some designs require diver intervention to recover the cable with the CPS. Due consideration should also be given to the removal of a CPS should the CPS itself fail. The costs associated with CPS replacement during the operational lifetime of an offshore wind farm are not insignificant, as the cable will most likely require repair/replacement as part of the process.  Bend restrictors  Various innovative systems have been developed to provide restriction of bending, including ductile iron articulated pipe, and polymer or metal based vertebrae systems. Vertebrae bend restrictors are available in both metal and polymer based forms. Some cable protection systems include a polymer based vertebrae system which restricts the bend radius to a maximum of a few degrees per segment. These systems are lighter (in water) than their metal equivalents and often more expensive to produce but must be carefully assessed for longevity in the proposed application. Due to the use of polymers these systems tend to be of a larger diameter than their metal counterparts, which presents a larger surface area for drag induced forces caused by currents.  Bend stiffeners  Bend stiffeners are conically shaped polymer mouldings designed to add local stiffness to the product contained within, limiting bending stresses and curvature to acceptable levels. Bend stiffeners are generally suitable for water depths of 35 metres or less, and their suitability is highly dependent on currents and seabed conditions at site. Extreme care must be taken when selecting a stiffener, especially relating to the lifespan of the system as these themselves can become fatigued/fragile. As the stiffness of these products are dependent upon the nature of the plastic used, careful testing and QA of plastics should be carefully considered as flaws introduced during material manufacture, processing, machining and molding.  Other systems  Various other polymer based systems have been developed which provide a flexible 'tube' which can be attached to the structure in advance of the cable being installed, although these are relatively new to the industry, and considered by some as unproven. = Applicable Standards = Although there are no specific standards for cable protections systems, DNVGL-RP-0360 Subsea power cables in shallow water includes a section on Cable Protection at the interface to a structure (Section 4.7).

He is the managing director and founder of Storck Bicycle, award-winning designer and innovator, and his current developments hold the world record lightness and stiffness to weight ratios.  Early life  Storck was born in 1964 in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, where he worked in his parents' bicycle shop, and the first German retailer of Cannondale bicycles. Storck comes from a long lineage of bicyclists and bike racers. His great, great grandfather joined a cycling club in 1876 and was a member for over 25 years. His grandfather, Willi Muller, and granduncle were professional racers on the Opel professional racing team, with his grandfather winning several track and road races. Most of his extended family either competed in races or was heavily involved in cycling. Storck started biking at an early age and competed in his first road race at six. His grandparents and parents owned several bicycle shops and Storck was involved in the shops at a young age. As a teenager, his parents opened another shop which Storck ran after school. His family interest in bicycles led him to complete a business course in the bicycle trade, followed by launching his first business, Bike- tech, in 1986. He founded Storck Bike-tech GmbH in 1989 and Storck Bike-tech, Inc. in the US in 1992, and in 1995 rebranded the company under the name \\"Storck Bicycle\\".  Career  = Storck Bike-tech = Early in Storck's career, his focus was on the import and trade of bicycles from Klein, Merlin, Fat Chance, Ritchey, Crank Brothers, as well as bike frames from Taiwan and Japan he rebranded under the Storck name. In 1990, Storck traveled to Japan to study under bicycle master frame-builder and founder of Toyo, Yoshiaki Ishigaki. He learned to work with steel, titanium, aluminum, and magnesium to build custom bike frames, which later led to his carbon fiber innovations. Storck went on to engineer and develop the world's first ever carbon fiber bicycle crank in 1992, which started selling in 1993. Weighing at 280g they were the lightest cranks ever built and the innovative use of carbon fiber founded the standard Storck would follow in future bicycles, components, and accessories. = Storck bicycle = Markus Storck on one of his Storck road bikes at Cap Formentor, Mallorca A contract termination with Klein bicycles in 1990 due to its acquisition by Trek bicycles led to the rebranding of Storck Bike-tech and Markus Storck's renewed design and development of his own bicycle and component production. In 1995, Storck began the design and manufacturing of aluminum frame bicycles in Portland, Oregon with the assistance of Kinesis USA, a subsidiary of Kinesis Industry, and in 1996, Dutch mountain bicyclist Bart Brentjens won the gold medal at the first cross- country mountain bike race of the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, Georgia, on a mountain bike of Storck's design collaboration with Hercules, Schauff, and American Eagle. Markus Storck's innovations using Vacuum Void Controlled production technology allowed him to reduce the resin content of the high- grade carbon bicycle frames by a third, allowing his future designs to have lighter, stiffer frames, while maintaining comfort and stability. Between 1997 and 2017, Storck has designed and produced over 100 bicycles, including road bikes, cross- and triathlon bikes, mountain bikes, and hybrids. In 2008, Storck opened up the first Storck brand store in Korea followed by stores in Singapore, Taiwan, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines, Japan, UK, Switzerland. Storck Bicycle was last reported to have earnings in 2007 of ‚Ç¨3.9 million.  Other ventures  In 1990, together with his friend Erich Reiss, Storck founded the Eurobike show, a bicycle trade fair which has grown from 268 international exhibitors to over 1,000. Eurobike is considered the world's largest bicycle trade show. In 2003, he was a jury member of the iF Industrial Design forum in Hanover, for their international design competition. In 2005, Storck was a jury member of the Materialica Design Awards in Munich. In 2008, Storck, along with Energy S√ºwagSupplier under a German government funded project to explore electromobility in the Rhine-Main region, designed and manufactured 200 custom battery-powered eBikes (pedelec) and solar charging stations. In 2015, Storck partnered with Rehau to design a new eBike concept for the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Energy, called nam:e: In 2016, he received the JEC Innovation Award and in 2017, the German Design Award for nam:e:  One of Seven Projects and Collaborations  One of Seven paired Storck with famous brands to design a limited run of bespoke items. Storck collaborated on the design and incorporated carbon fiber into all of the designs. Creating only seven of each product, Storck kept the original of each. = McLaren = In 2015, Storck and McLaren unveiled the super rare McLaren 650S. Storck, McLaren's Special Ops division, and the Dorr Group created what they call an \\"automotive sculpture.\\" It has all of the internal parts of the McLaren 650S Spider with new design elements, including a paint mixture that shifts from copper to brown, depending on the light. Storck worked with McLaren to use their own carbon fiber parts, so every part is able to be replaced from the factory. In 2016, the McLaren 1of7 received a German Design Award special mention. = Blac Carbon Sunglasses = Storck teamed up with Blac to create custom carbon sunglasses. Blac uses a proprietary blend of lightweight carbon fiber and titanium to create a light, strong frame. = Storck Aeronario Platinum Disc = Creating a bike to match the McLaren, Storck used the same paint to create a color-shifting limited run bicycle. = Balthasar-Ress Wine = Storck and Balthasar-Ress released seven exclusive bottles of wine. The packaging included a handmade wooden box with a matte black surface. Aluminum paper and a laser-engraved plate were used as well to create a unique package. = Blaken Rolex = Storck next teamed up with Rolex to create an individually designed Blaken watch. The Blaken line uses a Diamond Like Carbon Coating which appears similar to carbon fiber. = Aston Martin = Storck teamed up with the Q division of Aston Martin to create a new version of the Vanquish, using black satin paint and adding in carbon fiber to much of the vehicle. During the process, Aston Martin created a new manufacturing process for the carbon fiber bodywork. Custom details included hand stitching, the One of Seven symbol and carbon fiber Aston Martin symbols. In 2017, the Aston Martin Vanquish 1of7 received a German Design Award special mention.  Awards and recognition  In 1997, Storck entered his Adrenalin \\"fully\\" bicycle in the Red Dot competition for design and won first place. This was his first ever international competition. In 1998, Storck's carbon fiber Power Arms bicycle crank won the design competition. In 1999, Storck won the design competition again, this time for the Storck \\"Organic\\" mountain bike. In 1999, Storck launched the \\"Stiletto Light\\" road bike fork, which weighed 280 grams and was the test winner of Tour bike magazine. Additionally, his carbon fiber Power Arms bicycle crank won the 1999 iF Design Award. Also in 2008, the Fascenario 0.7 IS road bike received the \\"Milestone\\" award for the most innovative bike product by Tour magazine, followed by the constructors' classification award in 2009. In 2002, Markus Storck's \\"Storck Organic\\" mountain bike was showcased at the ‚ÄòIngenious Bicycle Patents‚Äô exhibition at the German Patent and Trade Mark Office in Munich. In 2003 and 2006, Storck's bikes The Adrenalin Carbonhttp://www.bikeradar.com/us/gear/category/bikes/mountain- bikes/product/review-storck-adrenalin-carbon-10153/ and Scenario CD1.0 10th Anniversaryhttp://www.bikeradar.com/us/gear/category/bikes/road/product/review- storck-cd-1-0-road-10360/ were recognized with the iF Product Design Award at Eurobike.

She is the first woman to hold the position of Secretary in the ACTU‚Äôs 90-year history. Prior to becoming Secretary she served as a Vice President and Campaigns Director. Before joining the ACTU, McManus was the Branch Secretary and an organiser with the Australian Services Union (ASU) in NSW and the ACT for 22 years. She has led many campaigns in the private, public and community sectors, including the first collective agreement for IBM workers anywhere in the world, the anti-privatisation campaign at Sydney Water, as well as the equal pay campaign for community workers. This was a seven-year campaign that delivered between pay increases of 18-40 per cent for all workers, the vast majority of which were women.  Early life and background  McManus grew up in Carlingford, New South Wales, Australia and is the daughter of a railway worker and a clerical staffer at a Parramatta pharmaceuticals factory. She has two younger brothers. At the age of 16, McManus was first involved in union activity when she joined with other students supporting a teachers strike protest against mass teacher lay-offs by the Greiner Liberal state government in 1988.  Education  McManus went to Carlingford High School and studied for a Bachelor of Arts in philosophy at Macquarie University where she graduated with a first class honours. At 19, McManus was elected president of the Macquarie University Union. She stopped smoking in the university bar and banned single-use plastics on campus. Deputy Leader of Labor, Tanya Plibersek knew McManus during their time at University.https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/is-sally-mcmanus-the-woman- the-coalition-fears-most-20181011-p508zx.html Career McManus started work when she was 14 and worked as a shop assistant, Pizza Hut driver, cleaner and call centre worker prior to joining the ACTU‚Äôs Trainee Organisers Program in 1994. From there, she became an Organiser for the Australian Services Union, focusing on workers in call centres and the IT sector. In 2004 she became Branch Secretary of the ASU in NSW and the ACT and oversaw membership grow from 9500 to 12,000. In 2012, McManus founded the Destroy The Joint campaign formed in response to radio broadcaster Alan Jones' criticism of then Prime Minister Julia Gillard and other prominent women. Her activism was recognised in 2015 when she received an Edna Ryan Award in the Grand Stirrer category. In 2015, McManus moved to the ACTU as Vice-President and Campaigns Director and was ultimately elected ACTU Secretary two years later. Her first television interview as Secretary sparked controversy, when McManus refused to back down from the use of illegal industrial action as a method of union campaigning. Asked by presenter Leigh Sales, on the ABC‚Äôs news and current affairs program 7.30, if the ACTU would distance itself from such action, McManus responded ‚ÄúThere is no way we‚Äôll be doing that,‚Äù later adding ‚ÄúI believe in the rule of law when the law is fair and the law is right, but when it‚Äôs unjust I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a problem with breaking it.‚Äù The statement was widely condemned by business and industry groups, as well as then Liberal Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, who said he was unlikely to work with her. In February 2019, her book 'On Fairness' was published by Melbourne University Publishing. In June 2019, McManus called for the resignation of CFMMEU Victorian state secretary John Setka, after he stated he was pleading guilty to domestic violence charges. Prior to the 2019 Federal Election McManus lead the union movements ‚ÄòChange the Rules‚Äô campaign, which pushed for workplace rights. Rallies were held across the country, with worker and supporter turn-outs reaching over 200,000 across the country. During the COVID-19 pandemic Sally McManus led the successful ACTU campaign for a national wage subsidy scheme, negotiating with the conservative Morrison Government to secure the JobKeeper wage subsidy, and campaigned for Paid Pandemic Leave. Personal life McManus is an enthusiastic player of computer games, and describes herself as ‚Äúthe definition of a total gamer‚Äù, who has been playing since the DOS era. She particularly enjoys Metal Gear Solid, on PlayStation, and says her favourite of all is Civilization. McManus has a black belt in kung-fu and taekwondo. She is also a keen bird watcher and photographer. McManus has strong sporting links being a foundation member of both the Western Sydney Wanderers and Greater Western Sydney Giants as well as being a long-term support of Parramatta Eels.

It was therefore imperative that a sample of this natural formation be protected under the National Park regime, in order to preserve forever its original conditions for the benefit of present and future generations. It is warm and presents two very marked seasons: the summer or drought, from November to March, the rainy or winter, which runs from April to October, during which the vegetation takes on an aspect of great frontiality.

Different forms of reality According to Business Horizons, there are multiple forms of reality, most of which are used in an abstract sense and can be divided into three distinct categories, real constructs, virtual constructs and possible constructs. Real constructs refer to physical, tangible objects, (i.e. books, pencil, dog). Virtual constructs are of a digital existence but are undoubtedly real and have the capability to be interacted with; (i.e. computer programs, virtual assistants, digital currency). Possible constructs are unique, since they possess the aspect that they do not exist, yet, in any forms of reality; (i.e. philosophy, metaphysics, ideas). =Separation and subdivisions= There are several different forms of virtual reality seen in works of fiction, some of which are listed below: * Augmented reality - Digital information overlaid or consolidated on the actual world of reality and vice versa. Superimposes mixed realities to join, forming possible scenarios that behave as if real, while still maintaining virtual element(s). * Virtual reality - Full digital render/ representation of the real world; our reality.http://wiki.arl.wustl.edu/images/4/47/Zyda-2005-computer.pdf * Mixed reality - A combination of virtual reality and reality. * Virtuality - A virtual portrayal of contingent or non-contingent possibilities. Fiction Many science fiction books and films have imagined characters being \\"trapped in virtual reality\\" or entering into virtual reality. Laurence Manning's 1933 series of short stories, \\"The Man Who Awoke\\"‚Äîlater a novel‚Äîdescribes a time when people ask to be connected to a machine that replaces all their senses with electrical impulses and, thus, live a virtual life chosen by them (√† la The Matrix, but voluntary, not imposed). A comprehensive and specific fictional model for virtual reality was published in 1935 in the short story \\"Pygmalion's Spectacles\\" by Stanley G. Weinbaum. Other science fiction books have promoted the idea of virtual reality as a partial, but not total, substitution for the misery of reality, or have touted it as a method for creating virtual worlds in which one may escape from Earth. Stanis≈Çaw Lem's 1961 story \\"I ( Corcoran)\\", translated in English as \\"Further Reminiscences of Ijon Tichy I\\", dealt with a scientist who created a number of computer- simulated people living in a virtual world. Lem further explored the implications of what he termed \\"phantomatics\\" in his nonfictional 1964 treatise Summa Technologiae. A number of other popular fictional works use the concept of virtual reality. These include William Gibson's 1984 Neuromancer, which defined the concept of cyberspace, and his 1994 Virtual Light, where a presentation viewable in VR-like goggles was the MacGuffin. Other examples are Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash, in which he made extensive reference to the term avatar to describe one's representation in a virtual world, and Rudy Rucker's The Hacker and the Ants, in which a programmer uses VR for robot design and testing. The Otherland series of 4 novels by Tad Williams, published from 1996 to 2001 and set in the 2070s, shows a world where the Internet has become accessible via virtual reality. Virtual reality stories based upon video games have also become popular in recent years, such as the 2011 novel Ready Player One by Ernest Cline, which is about a virtual reality system called the OASIS that people use to escape from the grim reality of a dying Earth in 2045. Other recent example include Conor Kostick's 2004 children's novel Epic 2006 and Louis Bulaong's 2020 sci-fi book Escapist Dream. September 05, 2020 August 29, 2020 Film The concept of virtual reality was popularized in mass media by movies such as Tron (1982), Brainstorm (1983), and The Lawnmower Man (1993). The .hack multimedia franchise is based on a virtual reality MMORPG dubbed \\"The World\\". The French animated series Code Lyoko is based on the virtual world of Lyoko and the Internet. * Rainer Werner Fassbinder's 1973 film Welt am Draht, based on Daniel F. Galouye's novel Simulacron-3, shows a virtual reality simulation inside another virtual reality simulation * The 1982 film Tron told the story of a computer hacker sucked into a digital world physically inside a computer system. He attempted to escape with the help of the titular hero, a computer program within that virtual reality. * In 1983, the Natalie Wood/Christopher Walken film Brainstorm revolved around the production, use, and misuse of a VR device. * The 1990 film Total Recall, directed by Paul Verhoeven and based on the Philip K. Dick story \\"We Can Remember It for You Wholesale\\" * A VR-like system, used to record and play back dreams, figures centrally in Wim Wenders' 1991 film Until the End of the World. * The 1992 film The Lawnmower Man tells the tale of a research scientist who uses a VR system to jumpstart the mental and physical development of his mentally handicapped gardener. * The 1993 film Arcade is centered around a new virtual reality game (from which the film gets its name) that actively traps those who play it inside its world. * The 1995 film Strange Days is a science-fiction thriller about a fictional virtual reality trend in which users buy illegal VR recordings of criminal offences recorded from the offender's point of view (POV). * The 1995 film Johnny Mnemonic has the main character Johnny (played by Keanu Reeves) use virtual reality goggles and brain‚Äìcomputer interfaces to access the Internet and extract encrypted information in his own brain. * The 1995 film Virtuosity has Russell Crowe as a virtual reality serial killer name SID 6.7 (Sadistic, Intelligent and Dangerous) who is used in a simulation to train real-world police officer, but manages to escape into the real world. * The 1999 film The Thirteenth Floor is an adaptation of Daniel F. Galouye's novel Simulacron-3, and tells about two virtual reality simulations, one in another. * In 1999, The Matrix and later sequels explored the possibility that our world is actually a vast virtual reality (or more precisely, simulated reality) created by artificially intelligent machines. * eXistenZ (1999), by David Cronenberg, in which level switches occur so seamlessly and numerously that at the end of the movie it is difficult to tell whether the main characters are back in \\"reality\\". * In the film Avatar, the humans are hooked up via advanced technologies with avatars, enabling the Na'vi avatars to remotely perform the actions of the humans that they wouldn't do on the gas-based planet Pandora. * Surrogates (2009) is based on a brain‚Äìcomputer interface that allows people to control realistic humanoid robots, giving them full sensory feedback. * The 2010 science fiction thriller film Inception is about a professional thief who steals information by infiltrating the subconscious. He creates artificial thoughts that are so realistic that once they are implanted in a person's mind, the person thinks these are his own thoughts. * OtherLife (2017) - about a form of biological virtual reality. * The 2018 movie Ready Player One directed by Steven Spielberg is an adaptation of Ernest Cline's novel of the same name about a VR entertainment universe known as the OASIS. The film is set in the near future of 2045 James Halliday creates this virtual reality world called the oasis. Halliday left his immense fortune and control of the Oasis to the winner of a contest designed to find a worthy heir. Television * The Doctor Who serial \\"The Deadly Assassin\\", first broadcast in 1976, introduced a dream-like computer-generated reality, known as the Matrix. * The British BBC2 sci-fi series Red Dwarf features a virtual reality game titled \\"Better Than Life\\" that allows its users to experience a utopia. In the novel adaptations of the series, headsets for the game are treated like an illicit drug, and the main characters end up spending many years unknowingly connected. * Saban's syndicated superhero television series VR Troopers also made use of the concept where the titular characters fight villains that seek to invade from the virtual world. * The holodeck featured in Star Trek: The Next Generation is one of the best known examples of virtual reality in popular culture, including the ability for users to interactively modify scenarios in real time with a natural language interface. The depiction differs from others in the use of a physical room rather than a neural interface or headset. * The 2012 anime series Sword Art Online involves the concept of a virtual reality MMORPG of the same name, with the possibility of dying in real life when a player dies in the game due to the side effects of the NerveGear. In its 2014 sequel Sword Art Online II, the idea of bringing a virtual character into the real world via mobile cameras is posed; this concept is used to allow a bedridden individual to attend public school for the first time. * The anime Accel World (2012) expands the concept of virtual reality using the game Brain Burst, a game which allows players to gain and receive points to keep accelerating; accelerating is when an individual's brain perceives the images around them 1000 times faster, heightening their sense of awareness. * Episodes of Black Mirror have featured virtual reality: ** The episode Playtest features an American traveler (portrayed by Wyatt Russell) who signs up to test a revolutionary new gaming system developed by the video game company SaitoGemu, but soon can't tell where the hot game ends and reality begins. ** The episode San Junipero features a simulated reality set in different time periods at the titular beach resort town that the characters can inhabit, even past death, as seen with its main characters (portrayed by Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Mackenzie Davis). San Junipero is made by the company TCKR Systems as the robots there maintain it. ** The episode USS Callister features Callister Inc.'s MMORPG game \\"Infinity\\" that uses virtual reality from TCKR Systems. Utilizing virtual reality technology in his modded \\"Infinity\\" game, Callister Inc.'s CTO Robert Daly portrays the captain of the titular ship from his favorite show \\"Space Fleet\\" where he orders around the crew members who are sentient digital clones of his Callister Inc. co-workers made from the Digital Clone Replicator that he has. ** The episode Striking Vipers features two friends (portrayed by Anthony Mackie and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) starting to have sex in a virtual reality fighting game called \\"Striking Vipers X.\\" * In the fourth season of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Leo Fitz created the Framework as a training program that was expanded into a virtual reality by Holden Radcliffe. When AIDA reworked the Framework, she created a virtual reality in it in where HYDRA ruled the world. After AIDA concluded her plan by creating a real body for herself, she arranged for the Framework to be deleted as its virtual inhabitants are slowly deleted. In season five, a possible future involving a broken Earth and the Kree ruling the Lighthouse had Deke Shaw rebooting the Framework allowing the Lighthouse's inhabitants to use it for leisure in exchange for currency. In season six, the Framework technology was used by a time-displaced Deke Shaw to create the virtual reality game \\"Remorath Rumble\\" that was produced by his unnamed tech company. \\"Remorath Rumble\\" enables the players to aid Quake in fighting the invading Kree and Remorath soldiers as well as flying a Confederacy Destroyer Ship. * In the fifth season of Supergirl, Andrea Rojas' company Obsidian Tech started to develop the Obsidian Lenses that enabled the users to enter virtual reality. Though this was secretly a plot by Leviathan to secretly trap them in virtual reality. Leviathan's plot was thwarted by Supergirl and Lena Luthor. Radio * In 2009, BBC Radio 7 broadcast Planet B, a science-fiction drama set in a virtual world. Planet B was the largest ever commission for an original drama programme.

Created by writer Kieron Gillen and artist Salvador Larroca, she first appeared in Marvel Comics' 2015 Star Wars: Darth Vader comic book series. Aphra became a breakout character, and began appearing in her own comic series, Star Wars: Doctor Aphra, in December 2016. She is a morally questionable, criminal archaeologist initially in the employ of Darth Vader, but later in hiding from him. Aphra is the first original Star Wars character not from the films to lead a Marvel comic series. Character Doctor Aphra is a criminal archaeologist with an expert knowledge of droid and weapons technologies, with a particular interest in ancient weapons and Jedi artifacts. She travels in a unique starship called the Ark Angel, which features a custom white-and-blue paint job. StarWars.com described Aphra as \\"a (mostly) morally bankrupt, in-over-her-head archaeologist\\", and Slate called her \\"driven, selfish, decisive, and wildly unpredictable\\". SyFy Wire called the character an anti-hero who \\"shares the snark of Han Solo and sexual charisma of Lando Calrissian, but toes the line between right and wrong far more regularly than these two characters‚Äîand more often than not steps over it into the downright naughty.\\" IGN explained, \\"Aphra has all of Han's swaggery, scoundrel-y charm, but little of his noble streak.\\" Creator Kieron Gillen noted that the character's main interest is \\"this weird obsession she has with uncovering old stuff\\". Noting that \\"Aphra's sarcasm and the careful way she codes her words are a vital part of her character\\", StarWars.com also explains that though she is somewhat of a genius, Aphra's ability to think on her toes is what has kept her alive in situations where her genius fails her. Gillen noted that readers can never be sure what the character will or will not do. Doctor Aphra writer Si Spurrier explained that despite the expectation that Star Wars characters \\"will always do the right thing\\", Aphra makes mistakes and sometimes chooses the unexpected. Sarah Kuhn, the author of Doctor Aphra: An Audiobook Original, agreed that \\"[Aphra] is the definition of chaos ... You never really know exactly what she's going to do, which means that, personally, I think she's having the most fun of anyone in the Star Wars galaxy.\\" In creating the character, Gillen looked to what he called \\"The Indiana Jones archaeologist archetype\\", which he believed fit well into Star Wars. His original concept for Aphra was Indiana Jones and his ramshackle problem solving, but with inverted ethics. He said that Aphra falls somewhere between a hero and a villain in that \\"You do see her do good things and bad things.\\" Gillen added, \\"She's kind of fun but at the same time, there's a really dark heart to her.\\" He explained, \\"She has this very fun-loving attitude, she's very fun to be around, but she's really bad as a person.\\" He added: Spurrier said, \\"She knows that Vader is probably not a nice person. She's aware that space fascism is not necessarily a good thing but it may be the right thing for a chaotic universe\\". Gillen compared Aphra to Darth Vader in that fans root for both as anti-heroes, but explained that while Aphra is a \\"bad person in many ways\\", Vader is on another level as \\"one of the greatest villains of all time.\\" Gillen added, \\"you can root [for her], because she makes really bad life decisions and sort of rolls with them ... She doesn't like killing people. She's not like a random murderer.\\" He noted that Aphra is complex in that she is \\"adamantly pro-Empire\\" but still tends not to obey the Empire's rules. SyFy Wire described Aphra as a \\"queer woman of color\\", noting her affinity for women and slightly Asian appearance. Slate agreed that the character is \\"drawn with a suggestion of Asian heritage\\", and also noted, \\"She aches for two different women who have claims to her heart‚Äîtwo women whom, inevitably, she must betray to survive.\\" Gillen confirmed Aphra's sexuality, saying he has written her primarily romantically interested in women rather than men, but noted that \\"Star Wars doesn't really have the terminology that we do ... homophobia as we know it doesn't really exist in the Star Wars universe\\". Of Aphra's relationship with Magna Tolvan, Gillen said he imagined \\"This hard-bitten, kind of very serious kind of person chasing down this more whimsical person and the sexual tension ... the flip of it is, Aphra's the person who's also pursuing Tolvan.\\" Appearances =Comics= Darth Vader (2015‚Äì2016) Aphra first appeared in Star Wars: Darth Vader #3 (March 2015), which is set after the original Star Wars film and was created by writer Kieron Gillen and artist Salvador Larroca. Aphra's appearance in the comic is being adapted as an audiobook for release on July 21, 2020. In the story, she is recruited by Darth Vader to aid in his schemes. At the end of the series Vader attempts to kill Aphra, but she escapes, leaving him thinking he succeeded. Gillen said of the story: From 2015 to 2016, Aphra appeared in Star Wars: Vader Down, a six-issue crossover comic miniseries which includes its own debut issue, issues #13‚Äì15 of Darth Vader, and issues #13‚Äì14 of the Star Wars comic series. Concurrent with the Darth Vader series, in 2016 Aphra also appeared in the Rebel Jail arc of the Star Wars comic, which comprises Star Wars issues #16‚Äì19. Doctor Aphra (2016‚Äì2019) After first being teased in September 2016 as Star Wars: Classified, Star Wars: Doctor Aphra was announced in October 2016, and began to be released in December 2016. The story picks up after Vader's attempt to kill Aphra at the end of the Darth Vader series. She is in hiding so that Vader will not discover that she is alive, but needs to get back into her life as an archaeologist so she can repay her enormous debts to the Wookiee Black Krrsantan, and fulfill her promise to help locate the people who tortured him in the past. Gillen said he wanted to write the series to explore \\"what makes her tick and why she's doing what she's doing\\". Gillen wrote issues #1 to #13, and then cowrote #14 to #19 with Simon Spurrier. Spurrier took over for a departing Gillen as of #20. Larroca and Kev Walker shared the artwork for issue #1, with Walker doing it alone for #2 and #3, followed by Walker and various other artists rotating in and out of the series. According to Spurrier: The series was nominated for Outstanding Comic Book at the 30th GLAAD Media Awards. Alan Scherstuhl of Slate wrote of the series, \\"The stories, like Death Stars, tend to explode, but unpredictably so, with escalating twists, striking moral quandaries, and only occasionally anything like a truly happy ending.\\" He explains, \\"Besides the vigorous storytelling and startling twists, the Doctor Aphra comics ... fill in shades of gray that are otherwise missing from Star Wars moral spectrum.\\" Jesse Schedeen of IGN called Doctor Aphra \\"Marvel's riskiest Star Wars project to date\\", but noted that \\"the distance from the movies gives Doctor Aphra a greater sense of freedom in terms of tone, style and plot possibilities.\\" Schedeen described the series as \\"very much like a Bizarro Han Solo story with a dash of Indiana Jones thrown in\\", and noted that it \\"thrives on its dark sense of humor.\\" In 2017, Aphra appeared in the five-issue crossover miniseries The Screaming Citadel, which is made up of its own debut issue, issues #31‚Äì32 of Star Wars, and issues #7‚Äì8 of Doctor Aphra. The initial Doctor Aphra series ended in December 2019 with issue #40. She is also the main subject of in the short comic \\"Epilogue\\", collected in the Empire Ascendant one-shot comic, which is in turn collected in the thirteenth volume of Marvel's Star Wars series. In 2020, the series won a GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Comic Book. Doctor Aphra (2020) Doctor Aphra relaunched in 2020, and is set between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. The first issue was scheduled for April, but all Marvel titles were delayed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The first issue was instead released digitally on May 3 (in recognition of Star Wars Day) and was physically released on May 27. =Audiobook= An expanded audiobook adaptation of Aphra's introduction in the Darth Vader series, titled Doctor Aphra: An Audiobook Original, was released on July 21, 2020. Written by Sarah Kuhn, the audio drama added new scenes and featured a full voice cast. =Short story= \\"The Trigger\\" (2017) \\"The Trigger\\" is a short story written by Gillen, published in the 2017 Star Wars anthology From a Certain Point of View. Set during the 1977 Star Wars film on the day that the Empire destroys the planet Alderaan with the Death Star, the story finds Aphra captured by Imperial troops and reacting to the news of Alderaan's destruction. Slate noted: Gillen said he wrote the story with the intent of \\"working out a fairly logical reason, why with her background, she thinks the Empire is bad to the alternative. If you grew up in a galactic civil war, I think peace by any means might be better than war. That's kind of Aphra's take. Aphra can handle everything. She lies to herself. But normal people? Normal people would probably like to live under a fascist regime rather than actually people just killing each other in a war. And that's a really dark hole to think about but I can buy someone believing that with Aphra's background.\\" =Video game= Doctor Aphra is a playable character in the defunct 2017 player versus player real-time strategy mobile game, Star Wars: Force Arena. Relationships =Mentorship tree= Impact and reception Increased sales of Darth Vader #3 convinced Gillen of Doctor Aphra's instant popularity, and he called the character \\"a big part\\" of the unexpected success of the Darth Vader series. Aphra became a breakout character, and was placed in her own series, Doctor Aphra, which is the first ongoing Marvel Star Wars comic focused on an original character not from the films. Gillen said in April 2018, \\"[Doctor Aphra] was the number two trade in February. A completely new character selling that well is shocking in comics. That kind of response is enormously impressive, as it doesn't happen often.\\" He added, \\"Sal[vador Larroca] and I cooked her up but enough people have written her now to make [her] bigger than me. She definitely feels like she's outgrown me, essentially. So I quite like giving her away to other people who'll get to play with her.\\" Aphra has also become a popular cosplay. Gillen said of Aphra's popularity: Spurrier added: Trent Moore of SyFy Wire deemed Aphra \\"arguably the best thing\\" about the Darth Vader series, and Catrina Dennis of StarWars.com called her \\"the type of character that steals every scene she's in.\\" Hanna Flint of SyFy Wire described Aphra \\"an edgy, cool and refreshingly diverse character\\", and Bria Lavorgna of StarWars.com called her \\"one of the coolest characters in Star Wars right now.\\" Noting that Aphra's first appearance was an homage to Indiana Jones, Alan Scherstuhl of Slate said that she subsequently \\"gains a depth that Indiana Jones never quite did\\", and praised the fact that Gillen has \\"never exploited or exoticized her sexuality.\\" Citing Aphra's \\"feats of technological prowess coupled with her unpredictable personality\\" as the characteristics which \\"make her a character worth watching\\", Dennis wrote, \\"Aphra has stolen the hearts of fans everywhere with her unpredictable humor and a complicated backstory that has unfolded into something much more than her introduction to the saga may have let on.\\" Merchandising In 2018, Hasbro released an action figure set of Doctor Aphra and her two killer droids, 0-0-0 and BT-1.

It is part of the Amazon biome. The ecoregion is home to a vegetation adapted to floods of up to that may last for eight months. There is a great variety of fish and birds, but relatively fewer mammals. Ground-dwelling mammals must migrate to higher ground during the flood season. Threats include logging, cattle farming, over-fishing and mercury pollution from gold mining. Location The Purus v√°rzea is a low- lying region of the central Amazon basin that is seasonally flooded. It covers of eastern Colombia and western Brazil. It extends along most of the Juru√°, central Purus, and Caquet√° (Japur√°) rivers and their tributaries. In the east it reaches the confluence of the Japur√° and Solim√µes Rivers. Urban centers in or around the region are Tef√©, Tabatinga and Carauar√≠. To the southeast the varzea adjoins the Purus-Madeira moist forests, and to the northeast it adjoins the Japur√°-Solim√µes-Negro moist forests. Streams that flow through the Southwest Amazon moist forests, Solim√µes-Japur√° moist forests and Caqueta moist forests to the west, and the Juru√°-Purus moist forests in the central region all contain stretches of the varzea. The Monte Alegre v√°rzea is downstream along the Solim√µes. Physical Altitudes range from . The forests are seasonally flooded by whitewater rivers, which carry suspended sediment washed from the eastern slopes of the Andes and organic material. Water levels rise by up to in the flood period, which may last for eight months of the year. The soil is fertile, composed of sediments that have accumulated in the present Holocene epoch and that are renewed by the annual floods. The river course through the floodplain constantly shifts over time, creating oxbow lakes, levees, meander swales and bars. These landscape elements support diverse vegetation adapted to flooding, which gradually merges into the surrounding terra firme forest. Ecology The ecoregion is in the Neotropical realm and the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests biome. =Climate= The K√∂ppen climate classification is \\"Af\\": equatorial, fully humid. Average temperatures range from , with a mean temperature of . Average annual precipitation is about . Rain falls throughout the year, but is heaviest in January‚ÄìMarch and lightest in July‚ÄìAugust. =Flora= Japur√° River The floodplain holds aquatic vegetation where drainage is poor, successional vegetation, forest mosaics and permanent swamp vegetation. The v√°rzea forests holds more species than v√°rzea on the lower Amazon, but fewer species than in the surrounding terra firme forests. The forest is continuous. The rich understory includes plants of the families Zingiberaceae, Marantaceae and Heliconiaceae. Economically valuable timber trees include Carapa guianensis, Iryanthera surinamensis, Ceiba pentandra and Calycophyllum spruceanum. On the upper levees the most common trees are Ceiba pentandra, Hura crepitans and Parinari excelsa. On the lower levees common trees include Pterocarpus santalinoides, Eschweilera albiflora, Piranhea trifoliata and Neoxythece elegans. The lowest areas contain abundant bamboo (Bambusa species), and pioneer trees that include Cecropia species, Pseudobombax munguba, many Ficus species and the Astrocaryum jauari palm. There are relatively few palms compared to the terra firme forests. Other palm species include Astrocaryum murumuru, Mauritia flexuosa and Bactris species including the endemic Bactris tefensis. Trees that support fruit-eating fish that enter the forest in the flood period include yellow mombim (Spondias mombim), jauari palm (Astrocaryum jauari), birib√° (Rollinia deliciosa), tarum√£ (Vitex cymosa), and apui (Ficus species). The largest tree in the v√°rzea is Ceiba pentandra. Other typical v√°rzea trees are Parkia inundabilis, Septotheca tessmannii, Coumarouna micrantha, Ceiba burchellii, Ochroma lagopus and Manilkara inundata. Flooded forests hold Virola surinamensis and Euterpe oleracea. =Fauna= The endemic black squirrel monkey (Saimiri vanzolinii) 199 species of mammals are found in the region, fewer than in the surrounding terra firme forests. There are no ground-dwelling species in flooded v√°rzea forests isolated from the mainland, but areas of v√°rzea in contact with terra firme forests house ground-dwelling mammals that migrate to higher ground in the flood periods. There are two endemic primates in the Mamirau√° Sustainable Development Reserve, the bald uakari (Cacajao calvus) and black squirrel monkey (Saimiri vanzolinii). The reserve is also home to white-footed saki (Pithecia albicans), emperor tamarin (Saguinus imperator), moustached tamarin (Saguinus mystax), Nancy Ma's night monkey (Aotus nancymaae) and Hershkovitz's titi (Callicebus dubius). Other mammals include white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari), common agouti (Dasyprocta genus), lowland paca (Cuniculus paca), jaguar (Panthera onca), capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris), spiny tree-rat (genus Echimys) and the Ega long-tongued bat (Scleronycteris ega). Aquatic mammals include the Amazon river dolphin (Inia geoffrensis), tucuxi (Sotalia fluviatilis) and Amazonian manatee' (Trichechus inunguis). Endangered mammals include the white-bellied spider monkey (Ateles belzebuth), Peruvian spider monkey (Ateles chamek), white-cheeked spider monkey (Ateles marginatus), Marinkelle's sword-nosed bat (Lonchorhina marinkellei) and giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis). 633 bird species have been reported. These include many aquatic species such as heron and egret (genera Egretta and Ardea), whistling duck (Dendrocygna species), ibis (Cercibis and Theristicus species) and roseate spoonbills (Platalea ajaja). Endangered birds include wattled curassow (Crax globulosa) and green-thighed parrot (Pionites leucogaster). The very large green anaconda (Eunectes murinus) is found in the v√°rzea. Other reptiles include black caiman (Melanosuchus niger) and spectacled caiman (Caiman crocodilus). The ecoregion is home to the endangered Johnson's horned treefrog (Hemiphractus johnsoni). Large fruit-eating fish that enter the forest during the flood period include pacu (genera Metynnis and Mylossoma), tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum), pirarucu (Arapaima gigas) and sardinha (Triportheus angulatus). Other fish include piranha (Serrasalmus species) and decorative fish from whitewater rivers and their blackwater tributaries and lakes such as blue discus (Symphysodon aequifasciatus), cichlids (genus Cichlasoma), characins (family Anostomidae), tetras (genera Hemigrammus and Hyphessobrycon), and catfish (families Aspredinidae, Callichthyidae, Doradidae and Loricariidae). =Status= According to the World Wildlife Fund the status of the ecoregion is Critical/Endangered. Smallholders along the rivers undertake mixed agriculture, forest exploitation, small-scale logging and livestock raising. In some areas the v√°rzea forest is threatened by large- scale logging and cattle farming. Fish populations are threatened by large- scale fishing operations and may be threatened by excessive collection of aquarium fish such as the red discus (Symphysodon discus). Gold mining contaminates the Purus and Japur√° with mercury.

She photographs the daily lives of girls and women in the Middle East and in the United States, including Syrian refugees.  Early life  Matar was born and raised in Lebanon and moved to the U.S. in 1984. Originally trained as an architect at the American University of Beirut and at Cornell University, she later studied photography at the New England School of Photography and the Maine Photographic Workshops. Since 2009 she has taught photographic workshops for teenage girls in Lebanon‚Äôs refugee camps. She now teaches at the Massachusetts College of Art and Design and exhibits her work worldwide.  Career  Matar has made several series of photographs, including L'Enfant Femme, Unspoken Conversations, Women Coming of Age, A Girl and Her Room, Invisible Children, and Ordinary Lives. Her portraits explore gender studies and often consider varying national identities. L'Enfant Femme depicts preteen girls living in the United States and the Middle East, and focuses on documenting the age between childhood and maturity. Mothers and daughters are photographed together and present a universal nature of womanhood in the series Unspoken Conversations. Matar began her series Invisible Children after a visit to Beirut in 2014. She noticed how many Syrian refugee children were on the streets begging for work and money. This series documents the individuality of each child. In 2017, Matar's work was included in the Biennale of the Contemporary Arab World held in Paris at the Arab World Institute.

He was a member of the Soci√©t√© fran√ßaise de philosophie. In his research, Tosel was a critic of consumerism. He argued that capitalism was inherently violent as it rested upon servitude and poverty through debt. He argued in favour of emancipation from the \\"passive revolution\\" of globalised capitalism through resistance, or the advocacy of workers rights, feminism, postcolonialism, multiculturalism, and the rejection of neo-colonialism. According to philosopher Yvon Quiniou, Tosel played a critical role in disseminating Marxist theories in academic circles. Personal life, death and tributes Tosel was married with children. He was a member of the French Communist Party from 1972 to 1984, and he re-joined the party in 2012, when he became associated with the Left Front. Tosel died on 14 March 2017 in Nice.

A March 2017 photograph of him sitting on his bed, smoking a pipe and listening to his wind-up record player in a rubble-strewn room has been widely reproduced. Early life Anis studied medicine in Zaragoza, Spain, in the 1970s. His father was a wealthy textile dye entrepreneur.\\"Aleppo automotive lover goals to revive his ¬¥wounded¬¥ classics  World\\", Laalo.net. Career In the 1970s, he was employed in Italy translating Fiat car manuals into Arabic. Later he went back to Syria and opened a cosmetics factory called \\"Mila Robinson\\". Car collection Anis states that his fascination with classic cars goes back to the 1950 Pontiac that his father drove, and which Anis still owns. His first purchase was a 1947 Plymouth. His collection now includes dozens of cars from the 1940s and 1950s, and prior to the Syrian Civil War, he had hoped to open a museum in Syria. His favourite among his collection is a 1947 Cadillac convertible, now badly damaged, that he bought in a 2005 auction. He maintains that \\"no car collection is complete without at least one Cadillac\\", and his collection also includes a VW Thing, a 1955 Buick Super, a 1949 Hudson Commodore, a 1957 Mercury Montclair, a 1958 Chevrolet Apache, a cargo-van bodied Citroen 2CV, a 1947 Plymouth, as well as other vintage Buicks and Cadillacs. Anis's collection of classic cars reached some 30 vehicles, but has slowly dwindled during the war. In January 2016, he had 24 vintage cars, having lost six to shelling. To prevent theft of the cars, he removes the steering wheels and seats. During the conflict, his neighbours stopped rebels who wanted to mount an anti-aircraft gun on a 1958 Chevrolet. He had to leave Aleppo for a time at the height of the Battle of Aleppo, and when he returned only 13 cars were left (including his 1947 Cadillac convertible, now badly damaged), seven having been impounded by the Syrian police, and 10 either missing or destroyed in the war. In March 2017, Anis estimated that altogether, one-third of the collection had been either destroyed or stolen. He says, \\"When one of my cars is hit, it's as if I or one of my relatives has been hit. It's as if they were my children, so I come down to check on them\\". Personal life Anis lives alone in the formerly rebel-held neighbourhood of al-Shaar in Aleppo, his family having fled due to the war. He has eight children with two wives, one in Aleppo, the other in Hama, and would like to leave his cars to his children, two to every boy, one to every girl. He speaks five languages, and likes to smoke a pipe while listening to classical music, and to Syrian singers such as Mohamed Dia al-Din.

Shutt was notably one of the first women to start a software business not only in the United States but the entire world. Early life and education Elsie Shutt was born in New York City and grew up in Baltimore, Maryland. After her father died when she was four, her mother worked as a chemistry technician at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Shutt attended Eastern High School in Baltimore and graduated with an undergraduate degree at age 20 from Goucher College, from which her mother had also graduated with a degree in chemistry. Shutt went on to complete a graduate fellowship at Radcliffe College in mathematics. She became the second ever female teaching fellow after Lisl Novak Gaal. Shutt also taught remedial trigonometry to Harvard students, the first female graduate student to do so. Following this, Shutt was awarded a Fulbright scholarship to teach English in France Career = Early Years = Shutt learned to program on ENIAC successor ORDVAC (Ordnance Discrete Variable Automatic Computer) under Dick Clippinger during a summer job at U.S. Army's Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland. In 1953 Shutt was hired at Raytheon (an aerospace and defense manufacturing company) by her old boss, Dick Clippinger. There, she started work on software for the Raycom computer. When she became pregnant in 1957, Massachusetts state law required her to quit Raytheon. However, Raytheon began to refer Shutt to their clients because the company was scaling back its outside programming projects. Shutt began doing freelance programming work from her home. This work was done for over a year with her friend Irma Wyman. Shutt eventually decided to pursue the entrepreneurial venture of starting a business that would give women part time work in this technical field, an opportunity that was nonexistent before. = Computations Incorporated = Shutt founded Computations Incorporated (CompInc) in 1957 as a primarily all-female company in the early era when software companies worked part time from homes as freelancers.Schafer, Val√©rie, and Benjamin G.

Shutt reportedly refused to hire more than 13 staff members and lead the company for more than 45 years. At the time, it was highly unusual for pregnant women to continue in their professional endeavors, leading some to dub Shutt and her employees \\"the pregnant programmers.\\" She began CompInc to prove that women could still hold programming occupations while taking care of a family‚Äîhaving a baby did not detract from their technical expertise. Shutt employed preferential hiring of young women with little children. She hoped that by doing this she would increase a woman's chance of getting a full time job as a programmer once her children grew up. Even women with no experience were hired because there was a training program in place. CompInc's employees were mainly women with a few men, but all the partners were women. The company's primary clients were the United States government and the science, education, and business industries. Computations, Inc. also emphasized ‚Äúdesk-checking‚Äù between employees (manually checking each other‚Äôs code), and clients claimed they saved as much as 50% by outsourcing to Shutt‚Äôs company. At its peak, her company entered into contracts with Minneapolis-Honeywell, Raytheon, St. Regis Paper Co., Harvard University, The University of Rochester, and the United States Air Force. = Personal Life = Shutt had the support of her husband, both emotionally, financially, and domestically, and even hired a babysitter to work every Wednesday, so she could offer that day without having to tell the client she‚Äôd have to look for a sitter. She enjoyed the days with her children and would rent computer time from companies during ‚Äúnon-prime times‚Äù who wanted to keep their computers on in the evening.

Note the talcum powder/rubbing alcohol lubricant mixture applied around the top perimeter of the enclosure, to prevent ants from escaping. Ant-keeping (or Ant Keeping) is a hobby involving the capture, care, and observation of ants and ant colonies. History Keeping ants as pets has been a common hobby since the mass- marketed Uncle Milton's Ant Farm achieved commercial success in the late 1950s, though these ant farms did not include a queen ant for legal reasons. U.S. Federal law prohibits shipping live queen ants (And other ‚Äúplant pests‚Äù.) in interstate commerce, though the species Pogonomyrmex occidentalis is not subject to these regulations as of August 9th, 2019. Reasons for Ant- keeping Ant keepers may choose to keep ants in captivity for the purpose of documenting ant behavior (in the case of an ant species which is difficult to observe in the wild). This field of study is called Myrmecology. Ant keepers may also choose to keep ants as a casual hobby; i.e., as pets. People who keep ants may also keep them for scientific purposes and experiments. Starting a colony There are differing methods of starting, caring for, and housing an ant colony. In the United States queen ants can be bought from vendors provided that the seller is from your state and that the species purchased is also native to your state. If you are in the UK or in any other European country, most exotic species of ant can be purchased legally through vendors though it depends on local laws. =Locating a queen ant= The first step involved in ant keeping is capturing a fertilized queen ant. Ants engage in nuptial flights during spring and summer, and after these flights a fertilized queen ant will land and remove her wings before locating a spot to found her new colony. If a queen has already chewed her wings off, she is likely (but not certainly) fertilized. If a queen ant on the ground still has her wings, she is likely unfertilized. A queen ant can be distinguished from a worker ant by the relatively larger size of the thorax (which at this point contains the wing muscles of the queen), and the enlarged abdomen which contains eggs. Beware that certain species have large workers similar in size to a queen, if the possible queen you are looking at has marks on either side of the thorax (Wing scars, where the wings of the queen were) it is a queen. If not, it's a supermajor; a larger worker of the colony. =Housing the queen ant= For fully claustral species, the queen should be sealed in a dark, aerated small container with access to water. One way to provide this environment involves using a test tube, some water, and two cotton balls. One cotton ball is pressed against the water, the queen is inserted, and the other cotton ball is used to plug the end of the tube. This nesting chamber should be kept in the dark for one month while the queen lays her eggs and tends to them until they hatch. A claustral ant species need not be fed during this period, as a queen ant will digest her now-useless wing muscles to provide her with the necessary energy until her first generation of workers emerges. But feeding a small drop of honey energises the queen ant and reduces the chances of her eating her own eggs. For a semi-claustral species, which will require food during this nesting phase, protein rich foods should be provided intermittently during the pre-worker phase, with the frequency and type of food determined by the specific species of ant. =Moving the ants into a larger housing= Camponotus nearcticus workers traveling between two formicaria through a connector tube. If successful with feeding the first generation of workers, the queen ant should continue laying eggs. Eventually (at about 25 worker ants), the colony should be moved into a larger housing such as a formicarium to allow continued growth of the colony. If you wish to put your ants into a setup before this 'worker limit', you may purchase a 'test tube outworld' which will allow them to be fed more easily, while still inside the test tube.  Caring for ants  = Dietary needs = An ant's diet should consist primarily of sugars/carbohydrates (such as fruit, sugar water, raw honey, or honeydew) and proteins (such as mealworms, cockroaches, or bits of egg). The sugars are necessary to provide the ants with energy, and the proteins are necessary for the growth of the colony. Uneaten food should be removed to prevent the growth of mold in the formicarium. = Environmental needs = Besides the obvious need of a formicarium and outworld (A separate container, often decorated to resemble the outside world, in which the ants forage for food.), ants require certain conditions to thrive. For one, almost all ants, save for a few twig nesting species, will not survive without a source of humidity in their nest. This can be accomplished in many ways; some nests are made of a naturally absorbent material, such as plaster, some contain a sponge or cotton ball which is watered when need be, and others still contain a reservoir of water which evaporates over time. Most ants also appreciate a heat source; as ants are cold blooded, their colonies develop faster the warmer their nest is. A heating cable is the preferred method of many antkeepers, but heat lamps, heating pads, and un-air conditioned rooms are all worthy alternatives. Many antkeepers keep their ants in a dark area to avoid stressing them (Ants usually live underground and flee from light in their nest, which would indicate a breach.), though most species become desensitized to light after being exposed to it frequently. While light-aversion can be a useful tool when moving colonies to new habitats, the benefits of having ants both indifferent to observation and more easily monitored far outweighs this, especially when more effective alternatives, such as physical disturbance to or partial disassembly of the formicarium exist.  Laws on keeping ants  The legality of intentionally shipping reproductive ants (usually a mated queen or whole colony) across state, provincial, or international borders varies substantially by country. In the United States, it is illegal to ship live queen ants across state lines without a license or explicit permission from relevant state or federal entities. As of 2019, however, at least one species (Pogonomyrmex occidentalis) is legal to ship within the United States, with the exception of Alaska, California, Florida, and Hawaii. In Europe, some domestic species (such as Formica rufa) are protected, and it is illegal to own, keep, buy, or sell these ants, or to damage their nests. However, unlike for reptiles and spiders, there are no rules for owning, keeping, buying or selling non-protected species inside the EU and many other countries. In popular culture Over the years Ant Keeping has become more normalised through the internet. Ants Canada and Ants Australia are both some of the key influencers in Ant Keeping Culture. They have together helped society think of ant keeping as a normal hobby and not one to be afraid of.

Similar to other strains of Polynesian dogs, it was introduced to the Marquesas by the ancestors of the Polynesian people during their migrations. Serving as a tribal totems and religious symbols, they were sometimes consumed as meat although less frequently than in other parts of the Pacific because of their scarcity. These native dogs are thought to have become extinct before the arrival of Europeans, who did not record their presence on the islands. Petroglyphic representations of dogs and the archaeological remains of dog bones and burials are the only evidence that the breed ever existed. Modern dog population on the island are the descendants of foreign breeds later reintroduced in the 19th century as companions for European settlers. Linguistic Map of the Marquesas Islands There are two words in the Marquesan language for dog: peto, used in the Northern Marquesas, and nuhe, used in the Southern Marquesas. The former might have been an English loanword from pet or a Spanish loanword from perro (dog), although pero was an alternative for dog (kurƒ´) in the related MƒÅori language. According to another theory supporting its foreign origin, the name came from a New Haven dog named Pato left on Nuku Hiva by the American sea captain Edmund Fanning from 1798 to 1803. The South Marquesan Nuhe is unique in the Polynesian languages, but may have some connection to wanuhe, the word for dog in the Papuan language of the Brumer Islands. French Catholic missionary Ren√©- Ildefonse Dordillon listed two other forms: moho ªio and mohokio in his 1904 dictionary Grammaire et dictionnaire de la langue des iles Marquises. History Little is known about the Marquesan Dog. They were introduced to the Marquesan Islands by the original Polynesian settlers along with domesticated chickens, pigs, and the Polynesian rat. The dog is thought to have become extinct prior to the arrival of Spanish explorers in 1595, although some might have survived beyond this point. No European accounts were ever written about them. They were thought to be fairly rare and \\"never numerous in the islands\\" even before the arrival of Europeans. Unlike in other parts of Polynesia, dogs were not considered an important food source, although they were sometimes eaten as shown by the presence of cut marks on dog bones found in archaeological excavations. Due to their rarity, they were venerated by the Marquesans and were closely associated with the high chiefs and priestly classes. Many petroglyphs or carved images of dogs were found near religious centers and chiefly residential areas indicating their venerated status and importance in the culture. A survey by American archaeologist Sidsel N. Millerstrom noted that a majority of dog petroglyphs have been found in the valleys of  ªA ªakapa, Ha ªatuatua, and Hatiheu on the northern coast of Nuku Hiva, the me ªae Vaikivi on Ua Huka, and the me ªae I ªipona and Eiaone Valley on Hiva Oa. Their regional distributions possibly reflected the role of dogs as symbols of tribal/clan loyalty and identity in the islands. They were totem animals associated with the Naki ªi tribe. Characteristics Petroglyphs often depict the Marquesan Dog in exaggerated forms. Millerstrom noted that these representations deviated from the typical characteristics of the Polynesian dog and wondered if they were meant to be realistic. She stated: > The Marquesan dogs' images show that the necks and the bodies are > exaggerated in length. The tails are long and curved over the back while the > ears and muzzle may be pointed, square or rounded. The legs are short and in > one case from Hatiheu Valley the paws were pointed in the wrong direction... > The early post-contact dog is white or spotted, small to medium size, with > pointed snout and ears, and a long tail. Could the Marquesans of the past > have forgotten what the dog looked like or did it matter how they depicted > the dog? Archaeological evidence =Stone carvings= German archaeologist Karl von den Steinen was the first European visitor to observe evidence of ancient dogs in the Marquesas in 1897‚Äì98. In his excavation of me ªae I ªipona, a temple complex near the village of Puama ªu on the northeastern coast of the island of Hiva Oa, he uncovered several stone tiki including two with zoomorphic (animal shaped) quadruped figures carved on them. During this period, the property and temple site was owned by Reverend James Kekela, a Hawaiian Protestant missionary, who von den Steinen befriended. He also relied on an elderly Marquesan named Pihua, who was the only living person who knew the names of the tiki at the site. Opferkopf Manuiotaa, currently at the Ethnological Museum of Berlin Tiki Maki ªi Tau ªa Pepe at I ªipona Measuring high, and in diameter, the first tiki was a megalithic stone head representing an unknown  ªupoko he ªaka \\"sacrificial victim\\". Von den Steinen named it Opferkopf Manuiotaa (\\"Sacrificial Head Manuiotaa\\"), after the famous 18th-century Marquesan sculptor Manuiota ªa from the Naki ªi tribe, who is believed to have carved both statues and many other tikis on the site. The head bore totem motifs of quadrupeds and little stick figures representing the Marquesans etua (gods) tattooed on each side of its mouth. He was informed that the quadrupeds could depict either dogs, rats or pigs. However, he concluded they were rats since at the time, dogs were believed to have been introduced by Europeans. He transported the head back to Germany where it is now displayed at the Ethnological Museum of Berlin. The second statue was named Tiki Maki ªi Tau ªa Pepe after Manuiota ªa's wife, known as Tau ªa Pepe (the \\"Butterfly Priestess\\"); she reportedly died in childbirth with Maki ªi meaning \\"writhing in agony\\". There are disagreements if the statue should be set in the reclining position as it was discovered or the prone position as it is currently displayed. It is believed to represent a female in a prone position, head and arms reaching skyward, giving birth, although it has also been interpreted as a female deity bearing the Marquesan people on its back. Images of quadrupeds were carved as bas-reliefs on each side of the square base of this statue. This tiki remained in its original spot and is visible today at the site of I ªipona. Only one of the dog carving is discernible now; the other one has weathered away. In 1956, Norwegian adventurer and ethnographer Thor Heyerdahl later claimed the reliefs on Tiki Maki ªi Tau ªa Pepe were llamas or pumas instead to bolster his theory that Polynesia was settled from South America. Later unidentified writers and rumors have insinuated that Heyerdahl deliberately altered and defaced the images in his process of restoring them. The modern consensus is that the carvings represent the extinct dog; they do not represent llamas, pumas or rats. =Bones and burials= In 1956, Robert Carl Suggs, with the American Museum of Natural History, led the first stratigraphical excavation of the islands and uncovered many dog bone fragments and one dog burial across a few sites on the island of Nuku Hiva. Between 1964 and 1965, American archaeologist Yosihiko H. Sinoto, with the Bishop Museum, discovered a drilled dog canine used as a pendant, one pre-molar and two dog burials in the sand dunes at Hane on the island of Ua Huka. In 1998, American archaeologist Barry Vladimir Rolett discovered dog bones in all levels of settlement at Hanamiai, on the island of Tahuata, indicating that the breed may have continued to exist on this island until the mid-19th century. Some of these bones had visible cut marks. In 2000, French archaeologist Pascal Sellier discovered three dog skeletons alongside several human burials at Manihina, Ua Huka; one dog was buried in a coffin. Millerstrom summarized these earlier findings and personally analyzed many of the petroglyphs of dogs left by the prehistoric Polynesians in her 2003 paper \\"Facts and Fantasies: the Archaeology of the Marquesan Dog\\". She noted that further research needs to be done on the linguistic evidence tracing the movement of dogs within Oceania, the socio- economic roles of dog in Marquesan and Oceanian cultures, and a study into the morphology of the bones and dog burials found in the Marquesan archaeology sites. Reintroduction of dogs Dogs of different breeds were later reintroduced by European settlers and visitors to the Marquesas. The first European dogs seen were those that accompanied Spanish explorers √Ålvaro de Menda√±a de Neira and Pedro Fernandes de Queir√≥s in 1595. While they were on Hiva Oa, the Marquesans attempted to steal one of the small dogs on their ships. Anthropologist Katharine Luomala noted that nothing suggested that these dogs were left by the Spanish. Possibly the first dogs reintroduced were those left by American ships during the early 1800s in the care of early beachcombers, missionaries and settlers who kept them as pets. One of the first reported cases was a New Haven dog named Pato, who had been \\"found guilty of sheep stealing about the year 1797 and was banished for the above crime\\". Around 1798, Captain Edmund Fanning left him on Nuku Hiva in the care of British missionary William Pascoe Crook who left him with a local ruler Keattonnue (i.e. King Cato), but on June 8, 1803, another American Captain Brinell recalled Pato and replaced him with two other dogs. During the Nuku Hiva Campaign of 1813, United States Naval Captain David Porter reported a few dogs on the island and observed the islanders were afraid of the two mastiffs on board his ship. Paul Gauguin's 1902 probable depiction of the Marquesan swamphen being killed by a dog. By the 1890s, English traveler Frederick William Christian noted the ideological conflict over dog meat consumption as island populations increased. He noted how the Marquesans living in the eastern valleys of the island of Hiva Oa had resumed eating baked dog meat \\"with delight\\" while the inhabitants of the western valleys \\"will barely touch [dog meat] even in times of famine\\". Christian also observed dog being eaten on Tahuata and Fatu Hiva. French artist Paul Gauguin depicted scenes including dogs in the Marquesas in several works while he lived on Hiva Oa. His 1902 painting Le sorcier d'Hiva-Oa ou Le Marquisien √† la cape rouge possibly depicts a dog killing the now-extinct Marquesas swamphen (Porphyrio paepae). In Herman Melville's 1846 semi-fictionalized work, Typee: A Peep at Polynesian Life, the narrator Tommo gives an unflattering account of dogs living in the valley of Tai Pƒ´ on Nuku Hiva: > I Think I must enlighten the reader a little about the natural history of > the valley. Whence, in the name of Count Buffon and Baron Cuvier, came those > dogs that I saw in Typee? Dogs!‚ÄîBig hairless rats rather; all with smooth, > shining, speckled hides‚Äîfat sides, and very disagreeable faces. Whence could > they have come? That they were not the indigenous production of the region, > I am firmly convinced. Indeed they seemed aware of their being interlopers, > looking fairly ashamed, and always trying to hide themselves in some dark > corner. It was plain enough they did not feel at home in the vale‚Äîthat they > wished themselves well out of it, and back to the ugly country from which > they must have come.

The freebore is located just forward of the chamber neck and is usually cylindrical in shape. The diameter of the freebore is always larger than the groove diameter of the gun barrel bore so that no rifling is present and projectiles used in the firearm can move in the freebore without resistance. Location and dimensions Closeup of chamber throat depicting relationship between freebore diameter, rifling groove diameter, and land diameter. The chamber is the rearmost portion of a firearm barrel that has been formed to accept a specific cartridge or shell. For firearms having a rifled barrel, the bullet typically extends forward from the leading edge of the cartridge. The portion of the barrel forward of the chamber that provides clearance for the loaded bullet of a cartridge is known as the throat. The throat is composed of both a freebore and a leade. The freebore is typically slightly larger in diameter than the rifling grooves in order to allow the cartridge to be loaded into the chamber without the resistance. The leade is the tapered section of the throat that transitions in diameter from the freebore to the rifling lands at a small angle, typically between 1 and 3 degrees. Freebore length affects the distance the bullet will jump before engaging the rifling when the weapon is fired. Greater freebore length permits bullets to extend further out of the cartridge case to increase space for propellant within the case. Increasing freebore length in order to increase bullet jump is used to delay the onset of resistance from friction and deformation that results when the bullet engages the rifling. Dimensions of freebore length and diameter may gradually increase as hot gas wears the interior barrel surface each time the weapon is fired.

The film stars Michael Caine, Katie Holmes, Odeya Rush, Seth Green, and Jason Biggs. The plot follows a sixteen-year-old American girl who becomes the pen pal of a notorious island nation dictator even when he is deposed. Plot The Vincent regime's flag Tatiana Mills (Odeya Rush), a fifteen-year-old American girl, lives a quasi-chaotic alone with her single mother Darlene (Katie Holmes), who is in a complex romantic relationship with her married boss Dr Charles (Seth Green) who is a dentist with a foot fetish. Tatiana becomes pen pals with Anton Vincent (Michael Caine), a notorious island nation dictator. When Vincent is deposed by his own people, who rise up against his violent and oppressive rule, he disappears, causing Tatiana to worry about his safety. A few days later, he unexpectedly arrives in the United States and seeks refuge in Tatiana's suburban garage. There, he develops a grandfatherly relationship with the teen and her struggling mother, becoming a useful man around the house whilst organising his restoration as leader with loyalist forces back in his unnamed homeland. Anton shifts his focus to Tatiana's high school life and her desire to deliver payback to the popular girls that pick on her. He makes her a dictator-in- training and teaches her to rise to power in her school in a similar way to his ascent to power in the Caribbean. Ultimately his plans go too far, putting her at odds with Tatiana, who also comes under investigation from the security services who have picked up on Anton's communication with his loyalist forces and suspect she is involved with terrorism. The police interview both Tatiana and Darlene and search the house, blissfully unaware that the old man in the house is Anton Vincent - whose whereabouts is unknown. No evidence is found and they are released, but upon release Tatiana informs the police that the old man is Vincent and he is arrested pending extradition.

It is a ground orchid with a single erect, hairy leaf and usually only one yellowish-green flower. It is similar to the endangered Mellblom's spider orchid (Caladenia hastata) but has a much larger leaf and the petals lack glandular tips. Description Caladenia richardsiorum is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single, erect, hairy leaf. The leaf is long, wide and has reddish-purple blotches near its base. Usually only a single yellowish- green flower about across is borne on a spike tall. The sepals, but not the petals, have blackish, club-like glandular tips long. The dorsal sepal is erect, long, wide and the lateral sepals are long and wide, spread apart and curve stiffly downwards. The petals are long, wide and curve stiffly downwards. The labellum is long and wide, and greenish cream-coloured. The sides of the labellum turn upwards and have dark red, linear teeth up to long, and the tip curves downwards. There are six rows of reddish calli with cream- coloured tips along the labellum mid-line. Flowering occurs from late September to early November. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia richardsiorum was first formally described in 1991 by David Jones and the description was published in Australian Orchid Research. The specific epithet (richardsiorum) honours Helen and Barry Richards for their assistance to Jones. Distribution and habitat The little dip spider orchid occurs in coastal areas mainly between Southend and the Coorong growing in heath and woodland. Conservation Caladenia richardsiorum is classified as \\"endangered\\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and the South Australian Government National Parks and Wildlife Act (1972).

The 850-foot-long artwork depicts the location of a pre-colonial shoreline by graphically etching silhouettes of materials that are found typically along the high tide line. The artwork offers a way to engage the imagination in an exploration of the changes to this now urban site from a salty tidal marsh, to an active pedestrian plaza. Background The shoreline and topography of Boston, Massachusetts, as it was from 1630‚Äì1675, overlaid on an 1880 street map The public plaza the artwork is located on was historically one of the first Boston Harbor landing places, named Town Dock. When the dock, and adjacent sections of the harbor were filled to create new land during the late 17th century, the area became known as Dock Square. The shoreline marking project and artwork details were developed in consultation with the Boston Art Commission, the office of the Boston City Archeologist, and the Boston Landmarks Commission. Plans and construction documents for the artwork are based on research of historic maps from the Norman B. Leventhal Map Center collection, and writings of historian Nancy Seasholes. The entire shoreline surrounding the original land mass of Boston has been repeatedly filled in and modified, starting in the early 17th century, through a process known as wharfing out. The A Once and Future Shoreline artwork presents one section of that pre-colonial shoreline to the public in an actively used downtown location. Geographic coordinates = Design details The estimated position of the pre-colonial shoreline edge at high tide is cut into granite using hand-made stencils of high-tide line debris, including: sea grass; Bladder Wrack seaweed; skate egg casings; quahog shells; Blue Mussels; feathers; sea cucumber; Sea Robin; rock crabs; pieces of old rope. In addition to the shoreline etching, the plaza paving pattern presents an overlay from an 1820 map of the area, depicting an historical street layout in grey granite block, and the building plot locations from the same time period marked with etched dash lines and a shift to pink granite paving blocks. The A Once and Future Shoreline artwork is adjacent to the relocated 19th c. sculpture of Samuel Adams by Anne Whitney Geological context The public plaza land area where the sculpture is located, in what is now known as downtown Boston, is inland from the location of the ocean's edge 5000 years ago. At that time early native people occupied low grassy plains and forest covered hills that today are under the water of Boston Harbor. The placement of this now land-locked shoreline marking may indicate the shoreline again in the future due to the impact of rising ocean levels as a consequence of global climate change  References  External links * Boston Art Commission Walking Tour * Boston History * Boston Mapjunction Over 200 historical maps since 1630 and aerial photos compared with Maps of Today * City of Boston Archaeology - Program and Lab Public art in Massachusetts Cultural history of Boston Landmarks in Boston Boston National Historical Park Seashells in art ","title":"A Once and Future Shoreline"},{"id":"53497378","text":"Alf's Baby, also known as Her Three Bachelors, is a 1953 British comedy film directed by Maclean Rogers and starring Jerry Desmonde, Pauline Stroud and Olive Sloane.Chibnall & MacFarlane p.103 It was made by ACT Films, and released as a second feature.

He was a citizen of the United States, and was noted for having been one of few Native Americans to vote Republican in the Presidential election of 1856, as most voted Democrat out of fear of the government. He is regarded as the most documented Odawa Indian of his time, due to his relation as the son-in-law of Rev. George Smith, the personal diaries of whom currently reside in the Library of Congress. Personal life Wolfe was born about 1833. His father was Nayan Miengun (Wolfe) and his mother, Charlotte Waukazoo, also known as Kin-ne-quay, was the daughter of a war chief and sister of both Peter and Joseph Waukazoo. Peter Waukzoo and Reverend George Nelson Smith founded the town of Waukazooville, renamed Northport, Michigan in 1854. Wolfe attended the village school in Northport, and was fluent in both the Odawa and English languages. He was married on July 29, 1851 to Mary Jane Smith, the 15-year-old daughter of Reverend George Smith. Smith performed the services for his daughters wedding, and kept an account of the event in his personal diary. Payson and Mary Jane lived on a farm in Northport overlooking Grand Traverse Bay and raised thirteen children, born between 1852 and 1874. The experience at Andersonville left Wolfe at merely 60 pounds, and with a permanent disability of his left arm caused by a bout of scurvy.DeLand, James S. Affidavit on the Pension File of Payson Wolfe. August 8, 1866. Wolfe fell into bad habits as a result of lasting physical and psychological effects of the war, which greatly strained his relationship with Mary Jane. He moved from Northport to Cross Village in 1878, and divorced Mary Jane in 1879.

Military service In March 1863, a state bounty act allowed for Native Americans to receive the same benefits as white men who enlisted to fight in the Civil War. A recruiting drive was led through the northern half of Michigan to assemble Native Americans to join a company of sharpshooters. Wolfe, already the father of six children, enlisted on August 3, 1863 in Northport and mustered in at Dearborn, Michigan on August 8, 1863. He was a member of Company K of the 1st Regiment Michigan Volunteer Sharpshooters, and fought with the regiment during Grant's Overland Campaign. Wolfe was a skilled shooter, and would often fill baskets with birds that he shot out of the sky to feed his family. With Company K, Wolfe fought at the Battle of the Wilderness, Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, Battle of Cold Harbor, and Petersburg. He was captured late on June 17, 1864, after his brigade was ordered to support a charge on Confederate earthworks near the Shand House during the Second Battle of Petersburg.Reports of Brig. Gen. James H. Ledlie, U. S. Army, commanding First Division, of operations June 17 and July 30. After he was captured, Wolfe spent 3 weeks at Libby Prison in Richmond before spending 5 months at the infamous Andersonville Prison in Georgia. Conditions at Andersonville were brutal; prisoners often went up to 4 days without food, and slept in the open, exposed to the elements, Wolfe being no exception.Smith, George N. December 20, 1864. Diary Entry. George Nelson Smith journals and letters, 1840-1879, Library of Congress. He told his father-in- law stories of how men had been forced to eat boiled rice with maggots, and that the food was so scarcely available that many had to eat the vomit of others who could not stomach it in order to survive.Smith, George N. December 30, 1864. Diary Entry. George Nelson Smith journals and letters, 1840-1879, Library of Congress. Wolfe was finally released in August 1864, as part of an offer made by the Confederacy to return sick and wounded Union prisoners. He was one of only 8 men out of the 15 from Company K to survive his time at Andersonville. Following his release, Wolfe spent time in Northport to recuperate, returned to service with the other surviving members of Company K on December 2, 1864. He was discharged from service as a paroled prisoner on June 13, 1865. References Further reading * Czopek, Chris.

History Weeds have existed since humans began settled agriculture have existed since the advent of settled agriculture around 10,000 years ago it is been suggested that the most common characteristic of the ancestors of our presently dominant crop plants is their willingness‚Äîtheir tendency to be successful, to thrive, in disturbed habitats, mostly those around human dwellings. Farmers have likely always been aware of weeds in their crops, although the evidence for their awareness and concern is nearly all anecdotal. Unlike other agricultural sciences like entomology or plant pathology, the emergence of weed science is comparatively recent, occurring largely within the 20th century and coinciding with the development of herbicides. Weeds are controlled in much of the world by hand (roguing) or with crude hoes. The size of a farmer's holding and yield per unit area are limited by several things and paramount among them is the rapidity with which a family can weed its crops. More human labor may be expended to weed crops than on any other single human enterprise, and most of that labor is expended by women. Weed control in the Western world and other developed areas of the world is done by sophisticated machines and by substituting chemical energy (herbicides) for mechanical and human energy. There is a relationship between the way farmers control weeds and the ability of a nation to feed its people. Successful weed management is one of the essential ingredients to maintain and increase food production. In 1923, Clark and Fletcher suggested that the \\"annual losses due to the occurrence of pernicious weeds on farm land in Canada, although acknowledged in a general way, are far greater than is realized.\\" Clark, G.H. and J. Fletcher. Farm weeds of Canada. Second edition. Revised and enlarged by G. H. Clark first published in 1909. Reprinted by Canada Department of Agriculture. Ottawa, Canada They thought this was because \\"farmers gave little critical attention to the weeds growing among their crops.\\" They did not deny that farmers were aware of the weeds only that they could do little about them. Many of the same weeds described by Clark and Fletcher are shown in most current weed identification books. In spite of continued research to mitigate weeds annually many of the same species continue to be problematic. The first U.S. Congressional appropriation for weed control was made in 1901 for work on control of johnsongrass, 23 years after Congress had appropriated funds for work on cotton insect pests. Petroleum-based herbicides were first used on California crop land in 1924 and soon became widely accepted in Southwestern states. In 1942, oils were used extensively for weed control in carrots and subsequently were used in forest nurseries. French scientists sprayed apple trees with dinitro dyes to control mosses, algae, and lichens. Some noticed that grasses that were wet from the spray did not die and that observation, or, more likely, a series of observations, led to the use of dinitros as herbicides for selective control of broadleaved weeds in cereals and flax. Sinox (sodium dinitro cresylate) was developed by Pastac in 1933. Pastac, I. 1973. Les colorants nitres et leurs applications particulieres. J. De al Hutte Chemique Contre les Ennemis das Cultures. 38:4. It was the first selective organic herbicide introduced in the US. From the early 1930s until about 1945, it was used extensively in grains, clover hay, grass seed crops, peas, cane berries, onions, and lawns. Timmons, writing in 1970 reported that \\"available literature indicates that relatively few agricultural leaders and farmers became interested in weeds as a problem before 1200 A.D. or even before 1500 A.D.\\" Timmons, F.L. 1970. A history of weed control in the United States and Canada. Weed Science 18:294-307. Republished Weed Science 53:748-761. 2005 The ‚Äúcritical attention‚Äù Clark and Fletcher thought was absent increased slowly, primarily because the general attitude seemed to be that ‚Äúweeds were a curse which must be endured, and about which little could be done except by methods which were incidental to crop production, and by laborious supplemental hand methods.\\" Jethro Tull, in 1731, appealed for greater attention to weeds: > It is needless to go about to compute the value of the damage weeds do, > since all experienced husbandmen know it to be very great, and would > unanimously agree to extirpate their whole race as entirely as in England > they have done the wolves, though much more innocent and less rapacious than > weeds. Farmers however were bound by their inability to do much about weeds except by laborious hand methods. Insects cause both human health and crop problems. Weeds, with a few exceptions, do not cause direct harm to humans. Those that do such as poison ivy and poison oak can be avoided. Poisonous weeds have never been widespread as a weed of crops nor of great concern to the majority of people. Many weeds aggravated human allergies but many did not and other common plants are also allergenic. Insects and insecticides were respectively causes of and solutions to human disease problems. Weeds and herbicides were not and less attention was paid to them. Weeds and herbicides were agricultural problems. They were not of general societal concern. There were a few scientists interested in the study of weeds and in developing techniques to reduce the crop losses caused by weeds. There were only three full-time weed experts in 1934 and only a few part-time ones. By late 1951, 46 state agricultural experiment stations had active weed research programs and most of them were working on weed control with herbicides. Now all colleges of agriculture in land-grant universities have weed scientists and a well- developed weed management program. Weed science has been strongly influenced by herbicides and mechanical technology developed by supporting industries, by research by weed scientists, and, ultimately, used by farmers. Herbicides greatly expanded the opportunities and range of methods for vegetation management and weed control. The definition accepted by the Weed Science Society of America (WSSA) is ‚ÄúA chemical substance or cultured biological organism used to kill or suppress the growth of plants.‚Äù Weed scientists have tended to focus on results and progress. Modern agriculture in the world's developed nations has addressed but not eliminated most weed problems through extensive use of herbicides and the more recent development of herbicide resistant crops through genetic modification. These methods while undeniably successful for their intended purpose also have created environmental, non- target species, and human health problems. Farmers in the world's developing nations use some herbicides but newer herbicides and the necessary application technology are often unavailable or too expensive. Weeds are always present in these farmer's fields but often the most available, affordable control methods are mechanical weeding, usually with animal power, or by hand, and most of the labor is provided by women. Neither the hypothesis that more energy is expended for the weeding man's crops than for any other single human task nor the corollary hypothesis that women do most of the world's weeding has been verified, but they are widely accepted.  Objectives of Weed Science  = Management of particularly troublesome weeds = While any plant can be a weed, approximately 250 plant species are sufficiently troublesome, cosmopolitan and economically injurious to warrant targeted research into their biology to assist in their management and control. Examples of some of these troublesome weed species in North America are Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri S. Watson), common lambsquarter (Chenopodium album L.), horseweed (Erigeron canadensis L.), morningglory (Ipomoea spp.), waterhemp (Amaranthus tuberculatus (Moq.) J. D. Sauer) and common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.). Some weed science researchers provide extension resources for farmers and land managers by trialing a variety of weed control tools and tactics on a specific weed, publishing the results and providing recommendations for their future management. Other researchers may study the biology of weed seeds in order to determine how long weed seeds can remain viable in a soil. Much of this research is conducted at public land-grant universities. = Herbicide application and interaction = Another aspect of weed science research is concerned with generating knowledge about the active ingredients of herbicides. Specifically, evaluating the response of weeds and crops to different combinations of herbicides at varying rates, droplet sizes, and environmental conditions within different cropping systems containing different weed communities. Some herbicides become more effective when mixed together (syngerism), while other herbicide combinations reduce the overall control (antagonism). Some weed science researchers trial a variety of herbicides applications and combinations on weeds to evaluate their impact on the weeds and crops. Most of this research is conducted by private companies. = Herbicide fate and action = Another aspect of weed science is concerned with how herbicides move in the environment after they are applied. Some herbicides degrade very quickly in sunlight and can be made inactive before entering the plant while others can persist for years in the soil after they are applied, causing problems for future crops. Registering herbicides can cost hundreds of millions of dollars in order to demonstrate how the chemical moves and degrades within the environment it is applied . Most of this research is conducted by private companies in order to be able to register their products for sale.

Career  As a member of Them (on keyboards) he recorded and toured with Van Morrison behind hit records \\"Baby, Please Don't Go\\", \\"Gloria\\" and \\"Here Comes the Night\\"; sharing stages with The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Who and The Kinks. Later when Van Morrison went solo, McAuley joined Paul Brady in Dublin band, The Kult. Moving back to London he formed The Belfast Gypsies, recording just one album Them Belfast Gypsies, which was produced by Kim Fowley. The album is hailed as one of the rawest and most powerful to emerge during the 1960s R&B; boom. McAuleys psych-folk duo Trader Horne, with ex Fairport Convention singer Judy Dyble also only released one album Morning Way in 1970. The album, much played by BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel at the time, has been re-released seven times since. Through the 1970s and beyond, McAuley recorded and worked with artists such as Viv Stanshall of the Bonzo Dog Do Da Band to Clodagh Rodgers, Jamaican reggae group The Heptones, Rick Wakeman and also as musical director with Lonnie Donegan on guitar and fiddle. In 1982, his songwriting came to fruition when he and John Gustafson of Roxy Music penned the hit song, \\"Dear John\\", for Status Quo. Meanwhile they formed Rowdy with Billy Bremner (The Pretenders) and Les Binks (Judas Priest). In the late 1980s, McAuley led for several years the critically acclaimed Celtic rock outfit Poor Mouth, recording the album Gael Force. After an accident almost severing his finger, McAuley during recovery began to write more solo driven material. Since breaking up the band in the 1990s, he has released several well reviewed albums under his own name. Recently McAuley and Dyble reformed Trader Horne for a one-off London gig, which was awarded four stars in a review in The Times. And his songwriting was recognised once again in the Hollywood movies Humble Pie, American Fork (William Baldwin) and Stranger Things (Winona Ryder). He is currently working as the Jackie McAuley Band with PierLuigi Cioci and Joe Toal.

Inside, the travertine lobby sported a \\"Prussian blue rug, wood-paneled walls, pumpkin-colored plaster, and tall windows\\". On one side of the lobby stood a shrine to the Abbey Theatre in England. The lower lobby and bar was accessed via a grand staircase. The theatre had seating for 550. Its Prussian-blue stage curtain was complemented by gray side walls and red carpeting. Backstage were nine dressing rooms. Monroe designed an electronic lighting switchboard ‚Äì a \\"smaller version of the system used in New York City's Metropolitan Opera House\\" ‚Äì to accommodate a variety of productions, including plays, operas, concerts, films, and lectures. The venue was also appropriate for use as a television studio. Helen Bonfils consulted with actor Raymond Burr on the theatre layout. Decades later, the Perry Mason TV movies starring Burr used the premises as a filming location between 1987 and 1989. History The Bonfils Memorial Theatre was built at a cost of $1.25 million by Helen Bonfils, a Denver philanthropist and owner of The Denver Post, in memory of her parents, Frederick Gilmer Bonfils and Belle Barton Bonfils. Bonfils designated the theatre as the new home for the University Civic Theatre, an amateur theatre which since 1929 had operated on the campus of the University of Denver. In 1942 Bonfils gifted a different site, at 1425 Cleveland Place, to the University Civic Theatre, but due to World War II the building could not be remodeled. In 1948 Bonfils acquired the property at 1425 Elizabeth Street and arranged for the removal of a ten-room house to make room for construction of a theatre, which she rented to the newly renamed Denver Civic Theatre for one dollar a year. With its opening on October 14, 1953, the Bonfils Memorial Theatre was the first live-performance theatre to open in Denver in four decades. It quickly became the \\"social center of the city\\", with opening nights presided over by Bonfils and attended by society figures. President Dwight D. Eisenhower dispatched a congratulatory telegram to Helen Bonfils upon the theatre's opening. The first production, Green Grow the Lilacs, was seen by an audience of 500. =Productions and performers= The theatre presented main stage, cabaret, and children's theatre. It staged more than 400 productions from 1953 to 1986. Performers at the Bonfils Memorial Theatre included John Ashton, Tony Church, and Cleo Parker Robinson. Celebrities who appeared in theatrical productions included Helen Bonfils (herself an actress and theatrical producer), Mary Jo Catlett, Julia Child (she gave a cooking demonstration), Kevin Kline, Patti LuPone, Ted Shackelford, David Ogden Stiers, Marilyn Van Derbur (Miss Colorado 1957 and Miss America 1958), Joan Van Ark, Emlyn Williams, and Paul Winfield. Bonfils lent her extensive collection of \\"fur coats, jewels, silver, furniture, and rugs\\" as props for many productions. During the summers, the theatre sent a \\"summer festival caravan\\" around to city parks to entertain audiences, and presented a free outdoor musical in Cheesman Park. Henry Lowenstein, hired as a set designer in 1956, became the theatrical producer in 1967. In 1985 the theatre was renamed the Lowenstein Theatre in his honor. =Closure= The theatre remained open for more than a decade after Helen Bonfils' death in 1972. In 1973 the Denver Civic Theatre moved to the Denver Center for the Performing Arts (DCPA), and in 1974 the Bonfils Memorial Theatre came under the jurisdiction of the governing board of the DCPA, which had been formed from Bonfils' estate. The board continued to operate the Bonfils Memorial Theatre as a community theatre, but in 1984, as professional theatre gained popularity at the DCPA, the board closed the main stage. The cabaret and children's shows continued to be staged until 1986, when the board closed the theatre permanently. Renovation Tattered Cover bookstore in the former theatre; the orchestra pit is in the foreground The theatre sat vacant for two decades. In May 2005 Charles Woolley of the St. Charles Town Company purchased the property from the Bonfils Foundation for $1.9 million. The development company undertook a $16 million preservation and renovation project to convert the theatre into a bookstore and add a record shop, art cinema, and 230-space parking garage to the adjoining lot. In June 2006 the theatre building reopened as a Tattered Cover bookstore. While few changes were made to the exterior, the sloped flooring of the theatre had to be leveled and the interior redesigned for retail trade. The redesign, executed by architect Josh Comfort, retained many \\"historical details and finishes\\"; for example, some original red mohair-covered seats were retained in two rear balcony areas, and the original orchestra pit, accessed via a ramp, was filled with a display of \\"books on the performing arts\\". The backstage dressing rooms, rehearsal area, and offices made way for a restaurant and coffee shop. The development company received the 2006 Community Preservation Award from Historic Denver for the project. The theatre building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006.

The album, which consists solely of music from the label's catalogue, displays the happy gabba or \\"popcore\\" sound that had emerged from Dutch underground raves during the mid-1990s and had partly started to reach mainstream success, such was the case with the album's lead single \\"I Wanna Be a Hippy\\" by Technohead. Upon its release, the album received critical acclaim for its upbeat, manic tone and happy spirit. Robert Christgau named it the 53rd best album of 1997, and, as an example of its acclaim had continued over years, Rolling Stone named it the 30th greatest EDM album ever in 2012. Background Dutch dance music record label Mokum Records was founded in 1993 by Freddy B.CNRRecodsUK.co.uk News 16-01-04. Accessed: November 26, 2006 Originally releasing intense gabba music, such a \\"I'll Show You My Gun\\" by Annihilator, the label eventually started to release the lighthearted, \\"hilariously giddy\\" tone of happy gabba music over the ensuing two to three years. Happy gabba, and its darker originator gabba, have been described as taking \\"the sound of Dutch Nineties skinheads who liked their drugs speedy and their music even speedier.\\" The label described the happy gabba music it released as \\"popcore\\", and its releases were popular in Dutch underground raves being held in warehouses. After the label had seen international success with \\"I Wanna Be a Hippy\\" by Technohead in late 1995 and early 1996, the Make 'Em Mokum Crazy compilation album was conceived by Mokum in attempt to document their catalogue and how the \\"popcore\\" sound was transitioning from its underground origins \\"to the top of the Euro pop charts.\\" Music Technohead, pictured here in their Greater Than One days. The liner notes of Make 'Em Mokum Crazy describe the music as \\"hyper speed happy anthems\\" and \\"the new sound of popcore\\", further noting that the songs emerged from the \\"underground warehouse raves of Holland.\\" Music critic Robert Christgau described the music as \\"happy tunes\\" in \\"high registers that range from unnatural to very unnatural,\\" advising listeners to \\"apply the broad brush it deserves and call it The Chipmunks Go Techno.\\" Rolling Stone describe the album's happy gabber content as \\"hilariously giddy.\\" More broadly, the Babysue zine described the music as \\"goofy techno.\\" Technohead's \\"I Wanna Be a Hippy\\", which was an international hit earlier on in 1996, quotes David Peel with its lyrics and features the lyrics \\"I wanna get stoned ‚Äì on thuuuh marijuana\\" yipped by \\"a maniacal sprite.\\" The song appears twice on the album, first in its original version and also with a remix by Ilsa Gold. Lollipop noted that the album \\"revolves around\\" the inclusion of \\"I Wanna Be a Hippy\\". Technohead also appear with the \\"Mobile Mecca Mix\\" of their song \\"Headsex\\" and with \\"Happy Birthday\\" which samples a Martin Luther King Jr. speech.\\" Party Animals appear with a recording of the traditional \\"Hava Nagila\\" and a \\"ride-the-lightning cover\\" of \\"Have You Never Been Mellow\\" by Olivia Newton-John. Release and reception Make 'Em Mokum Crazy was released in Holland by Mokum Records on 9 September 1996. Later on in 1996, the label released the album in the United States, where it was marketed by Roadrunner Records and distributed by RED Distribution, while Attic Records released the album in Canada. Modino Graphics are credited for the packaging's graphic design which features figure illustrations by Peter Conlon. The album was released to critical acclaim. Music zine Babysue described the music as \\"way upbeat and funny\\": \\"Techno bands take themselves way too seriously much of the time, but that's certainly not the case here. This almost sounds like techno/house music if it were combined with Saturday morning cartoons.\\" AllMusic rated the album four stars out of five. In The Village Voice, Robert Christgau rated the album \\"A‚Äì\\", indicating \\"the kind of garden-variety good record that is the great luxury of musical micromarketing and overproduction.\\" He praised the good-spirited \\"idiotic\\" nature of the album and said that the album was \\"intensely irritating, perversely delightful, and (trust me on this) just the thing for a 12-year-old's coming- out party.\\" He ranked the album at number 53 on the \\"Dean's List\\" of his favourite albums of 1997, curated for the annual Pazz & Jop critics' roll. Chuck Eddy of Spin magazine called the album \\"deliriously cute.\\" In his 1999 book Generation Ecstasy: Into the World of Techno and Rave Culture, Simon Reynolds cited Make 'Em Mokum Crazy as key happy gabba release.

On 7 December 1996, a CASA C-212 Aviocar registered as PK-VSO crashed onto a gas factory shortly after take off from Syamsudin Noor International Airport. 17 people, including one on the ground, died at the scene, 12-year-old child died on the way to the hospital while a worker died at the hospital. One passenger, identified as 40-year-old Irianto, was the only one who survived the crash. Official investigation determined that the crew lost control of the plane after its right engine malfunctioned. Flight The flight took off from Syamsudin Noor International Airport around 15:30 local time with 15 passengers and 2 crew members and was heading to Sampit, a city known for its strategic location and economy in South Kalimantan. The aircraft was piloted by Captain Herybert and was co-piloted by First Officer Sofyan Noor. Approximately one minute after take off, the right engine malfunctioned. The crew then reported to the tower, but instead of reporting the malfunctioning engine, the crew accidentally reported the other engine was working normally. The crew then stated that they would \\"return to base\\", but whilst making an emergency landing they lost control of the aircraft and it crashed through the rooftops of PT. Barox Utama Jaya, a factory producing oxygen tanks and acetylene. The crash site was located from the airport. 13 passengers and both crew members were killed. A factory worker was also killed and 3 others were injured due to the subsequent explosions. Two passengers of Flight 5940, identified as 40-year old Irianto and 12-year old Rusdiana survived the impact. Both were rushed to nearby hospitals. Rusdiana however succumbed to her injuries while on the way to the hospital. A worker, initially survived the crash in critical injuries, died due to the severity of his injuries. Passengers and crew The aircraft was carrying 15 passengers, including a 12-year-old child, and 2 crew members. Little is known about the crews' flying experience. The bodies were evacuated to Syamsudin Noor Hospital in Banjarmasin. The repatriation and identification progress were observed by the then South Kalimantan Governor Gusti Hanan Aman. The sole survivor was a 40-year-old man identified by authorities as Irianto. He suffered bone fractures and facial injuries and underwent a 4-hour surgery in Dr. Soeharsono Military Hospital. The surgery was conducted by Lieutenant Colonel Dr. Dedi Zamhuri from the nearby Indonesian Air Force Military Hospital. Investigation Immediately after the crash, the Indonesian Ministry of Transportation appointed the NTSC to conduct an investigation into the cause of the crash. As the plane was a produced both by the Indonesian IPTN and the Spanish CASA, they expected the Spanish investigation team to join and assist the NTSC. According to the ATC worker in Syamsudin Noor Airport, Captain Herybert had announced the engine failure and had stated his intentions to make an emergency landing. According to the Indonesian Transportation Minister, Haryanto Dhanutirto, the procedure the crew took was correct, and this claim was also correct. Observation on the crash site revealed that the plane's wreckage was heading towards the airport, meaning that the crew did attempt to return to the airport. =Response= In response to the crash, the Governor of South Kalimantan visited the survivor and the injured shortly after hearing the news. Indonesian Minister of Transportation Haryanto Dhanutirto visited the crash site. He, alongside with the South Kalimantan Governor, made a condolence statement to the families affected by the crash. Haryanto later added that the local government should make a regulation on industrial location around the airport and its risks. The insurance company told the media that there would be compensation for each passengers and crew members at Rp 40 million each person. They stated that they would only compensate the surviving passenger's hospital bill, up to a maximum of Rp 10 million. The insurance company, however, would not compensate the victims on the ground. The General Manager of PT. Barox Utama Jaya, Ranius, stated that he demanded a compensation from the airliner. He stated that his company suffered a Rp 500 million loss due to the crash, specifically a loss of a Fuso truck, an electrical generator, and the shutdown of the factory for three consecutive days. He later added that he would file a lawsuit if the airliner dismissed his demands. =Controversy= The CASA C-212 Aviocar was produced by the Spanish CASA and the Indonesian IPTN. The head of IPTN Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie claimed that the plane was \\"tough\\" in its class. For example, he noted the crash of a CASA C-212 in 1991 in Tihengo Mountain when the plane flew onto a tree and became stuck. Habibie stated that the plane didn't suffer any substantial damage. The same year a Pelita Air Service CASA C-212 crashed into the sea off Lampung. This crash later caused a public debate on the worthiness of the plane.

At the time of description A. dlusskyana was one of eight ant species known from Sakhalin fossil. History and classification A. dlusskyana is known from a single adult female fossil, the holotype, specimen number \\"PIN3387-172\\" which, at the time of the genus description, was residing in the Paleontological Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences, in Moscow. The described specimen is a worker caste adult preserved as an inclusion in a transparent chunk of Sakhalin amber. The amber specimen was recovered from deposits on Sakhalin island, in far eastern Russia during a 1972 collecting expedition. The expedition recovered amber from the beaches of the Okhotsk Sea at the mouth of the Naiba River and upstream on the banks of the river eroding out of exposures of Naibuchi Formation strata. Sakhalin amber has been attributed a range of geological ages, with Vladimir Zherikhin in 1978 suggesting dates between 59 and 47 million years old. In 1988, Gennady Dlussky suggested a tentative Paleocene age, which was followed by subsequent authors through 2013. Research published in 1999 on the Naibuchi Formation, in which Sakhalin amber is directly preserved, however, gives a Middle Eocene age based on geological and paleobotanical context. The Sakhalin amber forest had a variety of plants living in a mixed coastal swamp, river, and lake environment. The river and lake system had numerous swampy areas that resulted in active peat bog formation. The bogs were surrounded by Osmunda, Nymphaeaceae and Ericaceae plants, while Taxodium, Alnus, Salix, and other trees populated the forest. The amber fossil specimen was first studied by paleoentomologists A. G. Radchenko and E. E. Perkovsky of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, with their 2016 type description for the species being published in the Paleontological Journal. The species name was coined as a patronym honoring the Russian paleoentomologist and myrmecologist Gennady Dlussky, who had died in 2014. Radchenko and Perkovsky suggested in the description that A. dlusskyana was the oldest described Myrmicinae species belonging to a living genus of the subfamily. They noted older fossils are reported in the literature, but no detailed descriptions of the specimens have been published. Head of the A. dlusskyana holotype Head of the Aphaenogaster amphioceanica holotype A. dlusskyana has a pair of distinctive long spines near the rear of her propodeum that are not seen in any of the late Eocene European amber species, or in any Upper Eocene United States amber species. Workers of two amber species, Aphaenogaster amphioceanica from Miocene Dominican amber and Aphaenogaster praerelicta from Late Oligocene to Early Miocene Mexican Amber have similar spines. A. dlusskyana is separated from A. praerelicta in the shape of the spines, which widen near the base in A. praerelicta, in the more rounded petiole of the A. dlusskyana, and overall size, with A. praerelicta workers being more than longer. A. amphioceanica has a very elongated head that does not have distinct rear corners, rather the rear margin forms a \\"collar\\" shape, features not seen in the A. dlusskyana worker. Description The single worker of A. dlusskyana has a long body and a long head. The body has a number of long hairs scattered on it, with a large amount present on the upper surface of the gaster, while the tarsi have a dense covering of hairs that lie almost flat and curl upward at the tips. There is coarse parallel ridging running the length of the mesosoma, and the gaster, waist, and head are smooth with no surface sculpturing. The head is rectangular in outline, being 1.3 times as long as wide and with very slightly convex sides. The rear margin of the head also is slightly convex and the rear corners are \\"narrowly\\" rounded. Two lobes are well developed toward the front of the head, and partly cover the bases of the antennae and antennal sockets.

The unit was deployed in German-occupied areas of the Soviet Union, in the Army Group Centre Rear Area and was responsible for large-scale war crimes and atrocities. Operational history The division was formed in June 1942 on the basis of the 203rd Security Brigade that was itself formed in December 1941. It operated in the Army Group Centre Rear Area, of the occupied regions of the Soviet Union behind Army Group Centre's front lines. Its duties included security of communications and supply lines, economic exploitation and combatting irregular fighters (partisans) in Wehrmacht's rear areas. The so-called anti-partisan operations in \\"bandit-infested\\" areas amounted to destruction of villages, plunder and enslavement of civilian population. In July 1942, the division took part in '\\"Operation Peter\\". The unit received specific instructions regarding the villages deemed \\"bandit-friendly\\" (those failing to meet agricultural quotas). The division was to appropriate livestock, deport the population for slave labour to Germany and burn the villages down. The unit suffered heavy losses during the Soviet Red Army summer offensive Operation Bagration in 1944. In October 1944 it was designated the 203rd Infantry Division, and continued to fight on the Eastern Front until Germany's surrender.

It went into scheduled service on December 24, 1940. * Ship 41 went into service on January 19, 1941, flying from Atlanta to Ft. Worth, Texas. Delta Air Lines used the airplane for 17 years until 1958. Ship 41 was acquired by another airline in Delta‚Äôs family tree‚ÄîNorth Central. North Central became part of Delta's history through its merger with Northwest Airlines in 2008. The aircraft then flew for a number of different airlines before finally being operated by Air Puerto Rico, a Puerto Rican cargo airline company. Restoration In 1990, a group of Delta retirees and enthusiasts located one of Delta's first five DC-3s in order to restore it to flying condition. Their investigation led them to \\"Ship 41\\", then flying as a cargo aircraft, registered N29PR for a local Puerto Rican airline, Air Puerto Rico.

It was also released as a single off the album, backed with the more famous \\"The Shape I'm In\\" and, although it failed to reach the Top 40 in the United States, it peaked at #13 in the Netherlands. It has also been featured on several Band compilation and live albums. Lyrics and music On the surface, the lyrics of \\"Time to Kill\\" extoll the joy of country life, which the Band members had enjoyed prior to becoming famous. Music critic Barney Hoskyns states that the song sounds like a \\"celebration of the 'mountain hideaway' to which they'd at last returned,\\" and the lyrics explicitly reference the town Catskill in the Catskill Mountains, near Woodstock where the Band recorded The Basement Tapes with Bob Dylan. The music is also happy and upbeat. Steve Millward described the song as \\"a catchy medium-pacer.\\" Rolling Stone critic John Burks describes the music as having an old fashioned sound that a Kentucky moonshiner may have hummed to himself in the 1890s. Burks also describes Robertson's guitar intro to the song as sounding like 1956 rock 'n' roll and also sounding like \\"like tier of sound in motion.\\" The Band FAQ author Peter Asron notes that the song has an unusual rhyming structure, in which rhymes do not occur at regular intervals and sometimes appear to be out of sync with the song's meter. The happy lyrics and music belie the song's irony. Hoskyns notes that the song may just as easily be expressing the group's fear about how the world has encroached on their bucolic lifestyle since their first two albums made them famous. Aaron states that the music and title are misleading and that the real theme of the song is the danger of having too much idle time on one's hands. Allmusic critic William Ruhlmann similarly states that the song's theme is the \\"pitfalls of fortune and fame.\\" Something Else critic Nick DeRiso points out that around the time of the song's release the group in real life acted in accordance with the sentiments of the song, flying back to Woodstock by private plane when the opportunities arose during their concert tour. Burks notes that even the reference to Catskill may be a pun on a darker phrase \\"cats kill.\\" Rick Danko and Richard Manuel sing the lead vocal. Garth Hudson plays electric piano, in a style that DeRiso describes as sounding like coming from a \\"red light-district\\" and Hoskyns describes as \\"tinking.\\" Normal Band drummer, Levon Helm plays rhythm guitar on the song while Manuel takes the drums. Robertson plays lead guitar and Danko plays bass. Reception Hoskyns feels that this song plays it safe, describing it as \\"the most harmless piece of music the group had yet recorded as the Band.\\" Hoskyns does praise Hudson's piano, and the combination of Helms' \\"funky\\" rhythm guitar with Robertson's \\"piercing\\" guitar solo. DeRiso states that \\"Robertson‚Äôs guitar weaves in with a serrated economy, working in counterpoint to Levon Helm‚Äôs tough rhythm riffs.\\" Rolling Stone critic Dave Marsh described \\"Time to Kill\\" as one of the most notable \\"fine moments\\" from the Stage Fright album, along with \\"Stage Fright\\" and \\"The Shape I'm In.\\" Burks praised Robertson's guitar opening and described the song as \\"a controlled performance, if, paradoxically, a bashing one,\\" with \\"a complacent lyric\\" that he compared to Dylan's work at the time. \\"Time to Kill\\" peaked at #77 in the US on the Billboard Hot 100. It peaked higher in Canada at #45. But it did much better in the Netherlands, reaching #13. Other appearances \\"Time to Kill\\" has been released on several of the Band's compilation albums, including the UK and Australian versions of The Best of the Band, Greatest Hits and A Musical History. The Band also played the song live in concert on several tours, including in 1970 and 1974. A live recording from 1971 was included on the 2001 CD release of Rock of Ages.

History The Congregational (or \\"Independent\\") Church in Adelaide had its beginnings in 1837 in a marquee erected by T. Q. Stow, then progressed to a pug and pine chapel on North Terrace, succeeded in November 1840 by a more substantial building on Freeman Street (later part of Gawler Place). In June 1851 a breakaway group led by William Peacock and I. J. Barclay founded their \\"Ebenezer Chapel\\" on land donated by Peacock off Rundle Street, near the old East Terrace Market. Revs. M. H. Hodge, of Port Adelaide, and George Stonehouse, of the Lefevre Terrace Baptist Church, North Adelaide took the first services before Rev. Joseph Haynes was appointed their pastor. Then came the rush to the Victorian goldfields, of which Haynes was a participant and the Ebenezer Chapel closed for fifteen months. In July 1853 Rev. John Hotham, recently arrived from England, reorganized the church. Two years later, Hotham took charge of the Port Elliot chapel, and his place was taken by Rev. Edward Dewhirst. A year later Dewhirst left to join the Baptist Church, and the British and Foreign Bible Society appointed Rev. F. W. Cox to take charge of the church. In the meantime Stow supervised both branches of the Congregational Church in Adelaide. Cox arrived in South Australia in 1857 and preached his first sermon at the Ebenezer Place (named for the chapel and not vice versa) chapel. Soon the little church (\\"obscurely situated in a dirty lane off Rundle street\\" ‚Äî Rev. W. Harcus) was full to overflowing, and it was clear a larger chapel was called for. :A public meeting was held at White's Assembly Rooms, with William Peacock presiding over a gathering of 1,000 people. Vigorous addresses were delivered by the Hons. J. H. Barrow, Alexander Hay and Thomas Reynolds and Revs. William Butters, William Harcus, and Silas Mead of the Flinders Street Baptist Church, and as a result plans for a new building were soon under way. A block near the centre of the east side of Hindmarsh Square was purchased for ¬£700 and in the first year the congregation raised ¬£1,030 towards a new building, which was matched by Peacock. George Abbott (who also designed the first Clayton Congregational Church and the Flinders Street Presbyterian Church, died 3 April 1869) was the selected architect and English & Brown (also known for Chalmers/Scots Church) the builders. Abbott's design, described as \\"modified Byzantine\\", provided for a pair of steeples, which the committee decided to do without, as an economy measure.This was not unusual: the spire of St Peter's Cathedral, the \\"Victoria Tower\\" of the Adelaide GPO and the steeple of the Flinders Street Lutheran Church were built shorter than originally designed; the cathedral by some . The cornerstone was laid by Peacock on 21 August 1861 and new building, built to seat 450 and with its schoolroom and vestries completed a year later, cost ¬£5,075. Extensive stabling was erected to the south of the building, which was to have been called the Ebenezer Congregational Church, but that was rarely observed, invariably being referred to by its location. The first service was held on Friday 5 September 1862, conducted by Revs. J. Jefferis and H. Cheetham. Hindmarsh Square Congregational Church, c. 1867 Compare with St. Saviour's Catholic Church, Port Road, Hindmarsh Rev. Cox preached his first sermon in the new church on Sunday 7 September 1862, assisted by Charles Manthorpe, and C. W. Evan, and was uninterruptedly associated with this church until 1897, and died eight years later. Rev. S. Lenton served the Hindmarsh Square Church from 1898 to 1904, when he transferred to Rose Park, and was followed by Henry Gainford, who shortly transferred to Carlton, Victoria, and was replaced by Joseph Thomas Huston (died 1953). =Later use= The building later became a \\"Protestant Hall\\", controlled by John Amos, and the subject of complex financial manoeuvering. The Australian Broadcasting Company (a commercial organisation) took over the building for the 5CL broadcast studio, from 1930 part of a national broadcasting network. This became the Adelaide studios of 5AN and 5CL for the Australian Broadcasting Commission (which later became the Australian Broadcasting Corporation). The church and its outbuildings became the orchestral studio and PMG technical workshops. The circular detail between the turrets was emblazoned with the callsigns \\"5AN\\" and \\"5CL\\" and lightning bolt motifs. The stables were demolished for a complex of ABC studios and other facilities. The broadcast studios and facilities joined the TV studios at Collinswood in 1974. What remained of the original Church building was demolished in the 1980s. Nothing now remains of these structures.

He has won a number of martial arts awards.  Biography  Luttrell has lived his whole live in New Mexico. He wrestled on the varsity team all four years at Manzano High School in Albuquerque. Throughout his teenage and young adult years, Luttrell trained in judo, which is how he met and befriended Mike Winkeljohn. Winkeljohn recruited him to start working with his kickboxing students, to teach them grappling skills, and in exchange he received instruction in various forms of striking (kickboxing, boxing, Muay Thai.) It was also through his judo classes that he met one of Greg Jackson's students and eventually Jackson himself, later introducing Jackson to Winklejohn. He went to college at University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, where he obtained his bachelor's degree in criminal justice.  Career  = Criminal justice = He served in the Bernalillo County Sheriff's department as a reserve deputy from 1995 to 2000 and then accepted a position with the New Mexico State Police.

Chris introduced Mike Winkeljohn to Greg Jackson and eventually talked Greg into converting his self defense gym into an MMA gym. They then needed to develop a system that they thought had the most effective, fight proven techniques. Luttrell did this by traveling the country as a flight attendant, finding every fight gym or serious martial arts dojo and requesting to train for a night. Chris trained with everyone from Royce Gracie and Pat Militech to Megaton Diaz with whom he had epic roll at his academy. City by city, as his travels took him, he trained, learned, and recorded, Chris would return to his hotel and take notes in a journal on every technique he'd learned at each academy and bring it back to Albuquerque. These techniques would then be tested in the gym, in the bars, streets, and wherever was necessary to verify the legitimacy of the technique and what didn't work was discarded. When cage matches or Vale Tudo matches first began happening in the southwest, Chris was the first to compete. Along with Jackson and Winklejohn, the three organized a belt system for Gaidojutsu, and in 2000 Luttrell was the first to obtain a black belt in the art. The original team was made up of the following: Chris Luttrell, Brad Ahrensfeld, Tom Vaughn, Josh Groves, Chad Lemoine, Keith Jardine, Diego Sanchez, and Kyle Seals. direct interview with Chris Luttrell. He was approached in 2011 by Keith Jardine to help establish a school to teach mixed martial arts as both a form of fitness training and self-defense.

Poteat was born at Forest Home in Caswell County, North Carolina, near the community of Yanceyville. She was the daughter of James and Julia A. McNeill Poteat; her siblings included William Louis Poteat, and through her niece Helen she was for a time the aunt-in-law of Laurence Stallings. She was also the great-aunt of philosopher William H. Poteat.The Raleigh News & Observer, Tuesday 23 May 2000, obituary of \\"William H. Poteat\\" and The Raleigh News & Observer, Thursday 25 May 2000, \\"Remembrances of One Great Teacher,\\" by Jim Jenkins, supplemented by telephone conversations and email messages with Poteat's second wife Patricia Lewis Poteat and James W. Stines, a close family friend and co-editor of The Primacy of Persons and the Language of Culture. Her early education came in local schools before she went to the Raleigh Female Seminary. She then traveled to New York City, studying at the New York School of Fine and Applied Arts and the Cooper Union and having lessons at the School of Applied Design in Philadelphia. She was a private pupil of William Merritt Chase, and also studied with Robert Henri, Charles Parsons, and Louis Mounier during her career. She also spent several summers abroad, studying at various times in London, Florence, Venice, and Carcassonne. Poteat first worked at the Oxford Seminary in Oxford, North Carolina, but she joined the faculty of the Baptist Female University, today Meredith College, in Raleigh upon its opening on September 27, 1899. She remained there until her death over forty years later. She turned the art department into one of the most highly regarded in the southern United States, modeling its curriculum on those of schools in New York, Philadelphia, and Paris. Among her pupils at Meredith was painter Francis Speight; others include Mary Tillery, Ethel Parrot Hughes, Lucy Sanders Hood, Mrs. Herbert Peele, Heslope Purefoy, Dorothy Horne Decker, and Effie Raye Calhoun Bateman Goff. Poteat designed costumes for the faculty's quadrennial production of Alice in Wonderland; she also designed the university seal, adopted in 1909. Poteat was a devout member of the Baptist Church. She never married. After her father's death her mother came to live with her; the two would frequently visit her brother William at Wake Forest University during his presidency. On her death she was buried in the family cemetery near Yanceyville. A portrait of Poteat, done by her pupil Mary Tillery and presented to Meredith College by a group of alumnae in 1938, hung in the dormitory Poteat Hall until 1995, when it was destroyed by vandalism. She was also memorialized with a magnolia tree on campus and with the creation of the Poteat Scholarship.

Leaving for Europe in 1894, by 1896 he became a director of Typograph Setzmachinen-Fabrik, a German manufacturer of typesetting machines. Beginning in 1899 and continuing until 1936, a year before his death, Pierpont first helped to establish and then act as factory manager and later board member of the British branch of Lanston Monotype in Salfords, Surrey, England. While working for Monotype he supervised the reproduction of revivals of classic type designs and new designs such as Times New Roman.Friedl, Frederich, Nicholas Ott and Bernard Stein.

He reportedly had doubts about the artistic ambitions of Monotype's artistic adviser Stanley Morison and publicity manager Beatrice Warde, complaining in one 1920s memo of the Gill Sans typeface, then in development, that \\"I see nothing in this design to recommend it and much that is objectionable.\\" In his spare time Pierpont enjoyed growing roses.

In 1953 he was closely involved in Operation Cabin 12, arranging the defection of Vladimir Petrov from the Soviet Union to Australia. In 1954, he was appointed Deputy Director-General of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), roughly equivalent to the FBI and MI5. He received the Order of the British Empire in 1957. Early life and career Richards was born on 27 November 1905, in Nottingham, England. He moved to Australia at age 21 and joined the Western Australia Police in 1928. He later worked in the Criminal Investigation Branch and, from September 1939 to 1942, led the Special Bureau and Aliens Office. Richards began his intelligence career with a secondment to the Commonwealth Security Service until November 1945. In March 1942, he was key in the arrests of four members of the Australia First Movement in Perth, two of whom were convicted of conspiring to assist the enemy; the others were interned. Richards was appointed Perth's regional director of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation in 1949 after its formation on 16 March and became involved in the multi-national Venona project, looking into leaks of information to the Soviet Union discovered in diplomatic cables intercepted by the United States. In 1950, Richards became deputy director for Venona and went to work with MI5 in November 1952, after which he became ASIO's deputy director for New South Wales. Petrov Affair Ron Richards (centre) with defectors Vladimir and Evdokia Petrov In 1953 and 1954, as deputy director for New South Wales, Richards was in charge of Operation Cabin12, the arrangement of the defection of USSR spy Vladimir Petrov. Since February 1951, Petrov had been working for the KGB from the Canberra embassy. Michael Bialoguski was assigned to stay close to Petrov and report on his activities to ASIO, for whom he worked part- time. In time, Petrov started to hint to Bialoguski about defection. After Bialoguski was fired by ASIO, he told them on 23 November 1953 that Petrov and his wife wanted to defect but also threatened to go to the papers if he were not reinstated. It was Richards who warned the Director-General, Charles Spry, about the situation. On 27 November, Richards met Bialoguski and re-employed him on behalf of ASIO and briefed him on how he was to deal with Petrov. Richards reported frequently to Spry from this point until the end of the operation.Manne 2014, pp.40‚Äì41 At this point, the planning for Petrov's defection was called Operation Cabin 11 (possible defectors were called \\"Cabin Candidates\\"). In December and January, the tentative plan was for Petrov to buy a chicken farm as the basis for his new life. Bialoguski showed him around the \\"Dream Acres\\" farm near Sydney on 12 December.Manne 2014, p.41 In January 1954 the plan was redesignated Operation Cabin 12. Richards' first in-person meeting with Petrov took place on 27 February 1954. In Bialoguski's flat, Richards offered Petrov political asylum and on 19 March offered him ¬£5,000 in cash.Manne 2014, pp.54‚Äì56 In all, Richards met with Petrov twelve times, frequently recording him and negotiating the terms of the defection, particularly aiming to make sure Petrov brought with him valuable documents to share with the Australian government. Petrov's defection ultimately took place on 3 April and was announced on the 13th by thenPrime Minister Robert Menzies.Manne 2014, p63 In response, the Soviet Union closed its Australian Embassy on 23 April. Richards debriefed Petrov, starting on the day of his formal defection.Manne 2014, pp.67‚Äì71 Later career Richards with Charles Spry during the Petrov Royal Commission As a result of the Petrov affair, a Royal Commission on espionage was convened in May 1954. Richards was appointed deputy director-general of ASIO under Spry, in which role he had charge of ASIO's commission unit. He arranged for the Petrovs to appear before the commission and submitted ASIO documents to it, but Richards was not in the end questioned. In 1957, he was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE). He subsequently served on a committee of security experts in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and in 1961 was chairman of the counter- subversion expert study group of the same organisation. In 1965, during the Cold War, Richards, together with ASIO head of counter-espionage Don Marshall, recruited defence analyst Paul Dibb to identify KGB agents at the re- established Soviet Embassy in Canberra and try to recruit them in turn, which Dibb did until 1984. Dibb remembered Richards as the only man Marshall ever referred to as \\"Sir\\". Dibb was later investigated by ASIO on suspicion of being a double agent but was exonerated, and wrote the influential Dibb Report about Australia's defence policy in 1985 and 1986. After four years as senior liaison officer at Australia House, Richards retired in 1969. Personal life Richards was married on 27 April 1929 to Clarice Edna Counsel, with whom he had one daughter, and a son who died in infancy. Clarice died on 22 December 1982, and Ron died on 25 September 1985 at home in Victoria Park, Perth. Both were buried in Karrakatta Cemetery.

Personal life  Caleb Dyer was born in Stoneham, Massachusetts, on May 5, 1996, to Mitchell Edmund Dyer and Elizabeth Erica Dyer (n√©e Swenson). For a brief period his family lived in Everett, Massachusetts, before moving to New Hampshire. In the late 1990s, his family moved to Hudson, New Hampshire, where he was raised. He attended Hills-Garrison Elementary School, Hudson Memorial Middle School, and Alvirne High School. He graduated from Alvirne High School in 2015. While a student at Alvirne, he was a member of the B Naturals, a select jazz choir, which had the distinct honor of performing the national anthem before the New Hampshire House of Representatives.

Dyer announced at a press conference at the Legislative Office Building that he had officially changed his voter registration from Republican to Libertarian.

Joseph Stallcop that he had changed his party affiliation and registration to Libertarian, Rep. Dyer announced that the two representatives had re- established the House Libertarian Caucus and made plans to meet regularly in the Legislative Office Building prior to each regular session of the House.

Scott's early work contributed to the modern understanding of the biology of insulin and its use in diabetes management, though the exact role and significance of his research in this context has been a subject of controversy. Later, Scott developed a standard blood test for diabetes. After retiring from Columbia in 1942, Scott went on to become a noted horticulturist. Education and academic career Scott was born in 1877 in Kinsman, Ohio. He attended Ohio Wesleyan University as an undergraduate and received his B.S. in 1902. He received his M.S. from the University of Chicago in 1911, working with Anton Carlson, and left Chicago to begin his faculty career with a brief period teaching at the University of Kansas. In 1912 he moved to a teaching position at Columbia University. He received his Ph.D. from Columbia in 1914 and remained on the faculty until his retirement in 1942, briefly interrupted by World War I service with the American Expeditionary Force in France. His tenure at Columbia included the development of blood tests for blood glucose and characterization of standards for identifying diabetes by blood test. Among his notable graduate students is physiologist Albert Baird Hastings. Role in the discovery of insulin Scott's work with Carlson at the University of Chicago subsequently became a subject of controversy over the scientific priority of significant discoveries about insulin and diabetes, which earned Frederick Banting and John Macleod the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1923. Although Scott was only a master's student, he worked relatively independently in the Carlson laboratory, using dogs with surgically disrupted pancreas as animal models to measure his efforts to isolate a hypothesized anti-diabetic \\"active principle\\" found in pancreatic secretions. Evidence from his 1911 master's thesis suggests that he did successfully isolate a protein with observable clinical benefits in his experimental diabetic dogs, which by his description must have been insulin. However, Scott's thesis was not published in its original form until much later, in 1966. Instead, while departing for his new position in Kansas, Scott left his thesis with Carlson, who published a version in Scott's name in 1912 in the American Journal of Physiology. In their subsequent work on insulin and diabetes, Frederick Banting and Charles Best expanded upon the themes in Scott's work and cited the 1912 paper. However, later controversy arose regarding Carlson's edits to Scott's thesis to produce the paper, which included a summary and conclusion paragraph described as \\"cautious\\" and insufficient to establish his priority in isolating insulin; in fact, writing in 1964, Scott himself denied authorship of the 1912 paper. The award of the 1923 Nobel to Banting and Macleod attracted dispute from a variety of sources, with Banting himself objecting to Macleod's inclusion and ultimately sharing his award money with his research associate Charles Best; Macleod sharing his with another member of the team, James Collip; and other researchers in the field, including Scott, contending that their role in the discovery had been overlooked and earlier work undercited. Scott's wife self-published a book on the subject years later called Great Scott: Ernest Lyman Scott's work with insulin in 1911. Personal life Scott's wife Aleita Hopping Scott also held a Ph.D. in physiology and shared his interest in plants and gardening. After Ernest Scott's retirement from Columbia, the couple established a reputation as horticulturists, extensively documenting their garden at their home in New Jersey. Ernest Scott served as the founding president of the National Chrysanthemum Society of America and Aleita co-founded the American Primrose Society. The couple coauthored a book on chrysanthemums. Ernest Scott died in 1966. His papers are held by the National Library of Medicine and the New York Botanical Garden.

Salom√© Karwah ( ‚Äì February 21, 2017) was a Liberian nurse who was named co-Person of the Year by Time magazine in 2014 for her efforts to combat the West African Ebola virus epidemic. She appeared on the cover of Time in December 2014 with other health care workers and colleagues working to end the epidemic. Karwah survived ebola herself, before returning to work with M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res (Doctors Without Borders) to help other patients afflicted with the disease. The actions of Karwah and other health care professionals are believed to have saved lives of thousands. However, two years later, Karwah died from complications of childbirth; her widower suggested that this might have been due to the widespread, mistaken belief that ebola survivors can still transmit the virus. Even before the ebola outbreak, Liberia had one of the highest rates of maternal mortality in the world. Biography Karwah's father was a doctor. She met her future husband, James Harris, at a mutual friend's in 2013 after both had recently ended previous relationships. They began dating shortly afterwards. =Ebola work= One year after Karwah and Harris began dating, the West African Ebola virus epidemic struck Liberia, as well as neighboring Guinea and Sierra Leone, in 2014. Her family was among the first to become ill with ebola during the summer of 2014. Her father was the first to die from ebola, which ultimately killed both her parents and seven other relatives. Karwah, her sister, Josephine, her mother, and Harris were all soon stricken with ebola as well. Salome, Harris and Josephine Karwah were all placed in a Doctors Without Borders medical unit in Monrovia with other ebola patients to be treated. Salome Karwah's priority was to care for her sister, Josephine Manly, who was pregnant at the time she contracted ebola. Salome cared for Josephine, who nearly died, by changing her clothes and cleaning fluids that contained ebola. She withheld the news of their mother's death from Josephine, fearing that it would have a detrimental effect on her health. By September 2014, both the Karwah sisters had recovered, determined free of the disease, and discharged from the hospital. Salome Karwah was released from the ebola unit on August 28, 2014. Karwah's boyfriend, James Harris, also recovered and was released from the medical unit a few days later. The staff at Doctors Without Borders (MSF) had noticed that Karwah and Harris had both shown an ability to care for other ebola victims, regardless of the risk to their own health, while they had been patients. Shortly after their discharge from the hospital, MSF hired them to serve as mental health counselors in their ebola units. Salome Karwah returned to the unit, this time as a counselor and nurse, one month after her release. As survivors, she and Harris had developed a natural immunity to that particular strain of ebola. Karwah, who was interviewed on her work by NPR in 2014, recalled that \\"It was not hard to come back [to the Ebola treatment center]. Of course I lost my two parents here...but if I can help someone survive, I will be very happy.\\" She remained at the unit until the end of the ebola epidemic.In October 2014, Karwah wrote a guest piece in The Guardian noting that helping others with ebola brought meaning to her life. In the same essay, Karwah reiterated that \\"if someone has Ebola, it isn‚Äôt good to stigmatize them, because you don‚Äôt know who is next in line to contract the virus.\\"Time magazine named Salome Karwah as its co-Person of the Year, alongside several other \\"ebola fighters\\". She appeared on the worldwide cover of Time in December 2014 just months after being released from the hospital. Harris and Karwah became engaged. They were married to January 2016 while Karwah was pregnant with their third child, who was born a few months later. In the summer of 2016, Karwah became pregnant with their fourth child, which they agreed would be their last. The couple, who were religious but already had three small children, thought of having an abortion, but chose to keep the baby. =Death from complications of childbirth= Salome Karwah went through a difficult pregnancy. In February 2017, Karwah underwent a caesarean section though she was suffering from high blood pressure at the time. Although she had high blood pressure, Karwah was discharged from Eternal Love Winning Africa Hospital (ELWA) on the outskirts of Monrovia several days after undergoing the caesarean. She and Harris returned to their home to care for their new infant son, Jeremiah Solomon Karwah, and their other children. Karwah continued to feel unwell, exhibit spikes in blood pressure, and confided to family members that staff at ELWA hospital had neglected her complications. Just hours after arriving home, Karwah collapsed and began foaming at the mouth. Her husband rushed her back to ELWA hospital on the night of February 19, 2017. However, the doctor who specialized in treating ebola survivors was not on duty. Another doctor refused to treat Karwah, who remained in the car for three hours while suffering from convulsions and seizures. Harris eventually went to the emergency room himself and brought out a wheelchair to bring his wife into the hospital. According to Harris, the doctor and nurses on duty still refused to see or touch Karwah, telling him that he would have to take her to another hospital. Harris gave his account to NPR, saying \\"\\"[The doctor] was checking Facebook...I had to rush into the emergency room myself to get a wheelchair, but I was struggling to take her from the car to put her in it. Other nurses came to help me, but the doctor told me that she would not touch her, and that if [Salome] stayed [at the hospital] she would die.\\" He managed to contact an epidemiologist named Dr. Mosoka Fallah, who arrived at ELWA three hours later and finally admitted Karwah to the hospital. Despite his efforts, Salome Karwah, who had survived ebola, died from complications of child birth on February 21, 2017, at the age of 28, just four days after giving birth. She was survived by her husband and their four children, including the newborn, Jeremiah Solomon Karwah. Harris and Karwah's sister, Josephine, accused the ELWA staff of malpractice due to her status as a former ebola patient. They accuse the medical staff of providing inadequate care because they were afraid to touch her. Josephine Manly, Karwah's sister who also survived ebola, reiterated Harris's claims of poor treatment by hospital staff, saying \\"They said she was an Ebola survivor. They didn't want contact with her fluids. They all gave her distance. No one would give her an injection.\\" Manly believes that Karwah would have survived the child birth complications if she had received proper, timely emergency medical treatment. The mistaken belief that ebola survivors can still transmit the disease remains widespread across the country, including among medical staff, which may have contributed to Karwah's death. According to the Associated Press, the country's chief medical officer, Dr. Francis Kateh, echoed this falsehood when he told reporters that \\"the hospital knew she had Ebola and they operated on her, which put them at more risk.\\" Tributes came in from around the world, including her former employer, M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res, who wrote, \\"Salome's own experience of Ebola gave her incredible empathy for the patients that she worked so hard to care for...Our many staff who remember working with her speak of her strength and compassion, but also of her smile...She made a huge contribution to MSF's work at the height of the outbreak in Monrovia.\\" Ella Watson-Stryker, a MDF health promoter and colleague of Karwah, told Time magazine of the shock of her death, \\"To survive Ebola and then die in the larger yet silent epidemic of health system failure ‚Ä¶ I have no words.\\"Karwah's life was remembered on BBC Radio 4's obituary programme Last Word by Time magazine‚Äôs Africa correspondent, Aryn Baker.

He is the son of Fakir Saheb and he has five siblings. He grew up in Beluvai/Moodbidri and completed his B.Com degree at Mahaveera College, Moodbidri. He later obtained a law degree from SDM Law College, Kodialbail, Mangaluru. (formerly known as \\"Sri Dharmasthala Manjunatheshwara Law College\\"). After taking his law degree, Nazeer enrolled as an Advocate on 1983 and practiced at the Karnataka High Court in Bengaluru. In May 2003, he was appointed as an Additional Judge of the Karnataka High Court. He was later appointed a Permanent Judge of the same High Court. In February 2017, while serving as a judge of the Karnataka High Court, Nazeer was elevated to the Supreme Court of India. He became only the third judge ever to be elevated in this way, without first becoming the chief justice of some high court. In the Supreme Court, Abdul Nazeer was the lone Muslim judge in a multi-faith bench which heard the controversial Triple Talaq case in 2017. Though Justice Nazeer and one other judge upheld the validity of the practise of Triple Talaq (Talaq-e-Biddat) based on that fact that it is permissible under Muslim Sharia Law, it was barred by the bench by 3:2 majority and asked the Central government to bring legislation in six months to govern marriage and divorce in the Muslim community. The court said till the government formulates a law regarding triple talaq, there would be an injunction on husbands pronouncing triple talaq on their wives.

In his time, he was well-known beyond the borders of Italy and was hired for the court of Mecklenburg.  Life  Medini was hired as a personal chef, sometime after 1800 by the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, to the court of later grand Duke of Mecklenburg- Schwerin, Friedrich Franz I. He received the title of chief chef. He was the head of the kitchens in the residence and later, during the annual summer residence of the ducal family in Doberan, also set up tents near the pavilions at the Kamp. Medini was married to a Swedish woman Maria (1766‚Äì1821). The architect Carl Theodor Severin, who was responsible for realizing many of the buildings in Heiligendamm and Doberan, built a house for Medini around 1825 near the Kamp on today's Severinstrasse. Medini lived in this house until his death in 1857. The building still exists and is now a monument.

In 2013, there was an \\"unprecedented reunion of the great 'Bombay School' of poets who emerged in the 1970's, including Eunice de Souza, Gieve Patel, Arvind Krishna Mehrotra and Manohar Shetty.\\" = 2014 = GALF 2014 saw senior journalists discuss \\"the changing nature of the national media\\". These included Rajdeep Sardesai, Sagarika Ghose, Sreenivasan Jain, Naresh Fernandes, Samar Halarnkar, Priya Ramani, Govindraj Ethiraj, Sachin Kalbag, Prashant Jha, Cyril Almeida. Then Indian Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar released Sardesai's 2014: The Election that Changed India. = 2016 = GALF 2016 included some new partnerships with Ministry of Culture, Government of India and North Eastern Council, Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region, Shillong Meghalaya.

The keynote addresses at the inaugural were given by Sahitya Akademi award winning writers Shashi Deshpande and Jerry Pinto. The ninth edition was co-curated by Damodar Mauzo and Vivek Menezes. It featured book releases like Sita Valles: Revolutionary Until Death by Frederick Noronha's Goa 1556. Response The online StageCulture.com said of GALF: \\"Hosted annually in December, this Fest has proven beyond doubt, that Goa is much more than just a hip beach destination and rave hotspot.\\" Skyscanner.co.in said: \\"The Goa Arts and Literary festival ... is now in its fifth year, and is quickly establishing itself as one of the literary events of the year. In between attending literary events, readings and book launches, you‚Äôll be able to visit the popular beaches of [G]oa for some sun, sand and seafood! ...Participation is free, with pre-registration.\\" Writing in The Navhind Times, one critical point of view commented: \\"Goa needs to create rooms of its own to spur on the creative process. But, now, just when writers from here have an enhanced chance of getting heard, we could be building new hierarchies. Local work needs to be validated by the tastes of someone in New Delhi or New York, before it can be deemed as significant and having value for Goa. This is a deeply disturbing idea, even if it is implemented subconsciously. There seems to be little consultation happening to source out potential participants. In the case of national and international participants, one can go by what is said about them, or reputations built in other literary festivals. How does one choose participation from Goa when we are still to understand the field of who‚Äôs doing what?\\" Mridula Garg writes, \\"Sometimes, in a blink of an eye, we discover that the someone we thought lay at the extreme end of the margin is actually closest to us; in fact is our alter ego... That is the point when we begin to create literature or art. That‚Äôs why a Damodar Mauzo can write about a Goan boy‚Äôs life in East Africa in the last century with the same ease he can write about Goa now. It‚Äôs important to remember that the margin is not a homogenous space. Within the margin lie a number of invisible margins peopled with dissenters. And each of them is a significant other because dissent is the life-blood of literature and social change.\\"  See also  * Jaipur Literature Festival * International Film Festival of India References External links *GALF website *Videos from GALF (amidst other subjects) 2010 establishments in India December events Festivals established in 2010 Festivals in Goa Literary festivals in India ","title":"Goa Arts and Literature Festival"},{"id":"53499121","text":"Sitalcas is a monotypic genus of North American sheet weavers containing the single species, Sitalcas ruralis.
