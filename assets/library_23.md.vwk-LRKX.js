This chapter contains the middle portion of the Sermon on the Mount, including the Lord's Prayer.Turner, David L. Matthew 2008 p. 210. Text Lectionary 239 Folio 39 verso with the Greek text of Matthew 6:14-21 (13th century) The original text was written in Koine Greek. This chapter is divided into 34 verses. Textual witnesses Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are: *Codex Vaticanus (~325‚Äì350; complete) *Codex Sinaiticus (~330‚Äì360; complete) *Codex Washingtonianus (~400) *Codex Bezae (~400; extant verses 1-19) Structure The first part of this chapter, Matthew 6:1‚Äì18, deals with the outward and inward expression of piety, referring to almsgiving, private prayer and fasting.Talbert, Charles H. 2010 Matthew pp. 87‚Äì91. This part of the chapter, sometimes called the \\"Discourse on Ostentation\\", goes over the three most important outward expressions of Jewish piety, alms giving, prayer, and fasting. Jesus endorses the standard teachings that these acts are important. Throughout this section he stresses that worship and piety should not be ostentatious, and ideally should be done in secret. He strongly contravenes those who make public displays of their piety, which can be understood as teaching that those who are pious to impress others will only impress people, and will do nothing to impress God. Matthew 6:19‚Äì34 deals with possessions and the issues of priorities and trust. The first part in Matthew 6:19‚Äì24 has three elements about two treasures, two eyes and two masters. The second part in Matthew 6:25‚Äì34 deals with trust in God and also has three elements and provides reasons for not being anxious. In John Wesley's analysis of the Sermon on the Mount, chapter five outlines \\"the sum of all true religion\\", allowing this chapter to detail \\"rules for that right intention which we are to preserve in all our outward actions, unmixed with worldly desires or anxious cares for even the necessaries of life\\" and the following chapter to provide \\"cautions against the main hinderances of religion\\".Wesley, J., Sermon 21, Upon Our Lord's Sermon on the Mount: Discourse One, accessed 10 August 2019 Wesley further analyses chapter 6 as follows: *Verses 1‚Äì4: the right intention and manner of giving alms *Verses 5‚Äì15: the right intention, manner, form, and prerequisites of prayer *Verses 16‚Äì18: the right intention, and manner of fasting *Verses 19‚Äì34: the necessity of a pure intention in all things, unmixed either with the desire of riches, or worldly care, and fear of want.Wesley, J., Wesley's Notes on Matthew 6, accessed 15 August 2019  Verses  Full text In the King James Version this chapter reads: ¬πTake heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven. ¬≤Therefore, when thou doest [thine] alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. ¬≥But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth: ‚Å¥That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly. ‚ÅµAnd when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites [are]: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. ‚Å∂But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly. ‚Å∑But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen [do]: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking. ‚Å∏Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him. ‚ÅπAfter this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. ¬π‚Å∞Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven. ¬π¬πGive us this day our daily bread. ¬π¬≤And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. ¬π¬≥And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever and ever. Amen. ¬π‚Å¥For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you: 15But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses. ¬π‚Å∂Moreover, when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. 17But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face; ¬π‚Å∏That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly. ¬π‚ÅπLay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: ¬≤‚Å∞But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal: ¬≤¬πFor where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. ¬≤¬≤The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light. ¬≤¬≥But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great [is] that darkness! ¬≤‚Å¥No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon. ¬≤‚ÅµTherefore, I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment? ¬≤‚Å∂Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they? ¬≤‚Å∑Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature? ¬≤‚Å∏And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: ¬≤‚ÅπAnd yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. ¬≥‚Å∞Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, [shall he] not much more [clothe] you, O ye of little faith? ¬≥¬πTherefore, take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed? ¬≥¬≤(For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things. ¬≥¬≥But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you. ¬≥‚Å¥Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day [is] the evil thereof. Uses In the book \\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\\" by J. K.

XXX was released as a free download by Brooklyn, New York-based record label Fool's Gold Records. Brown cited XXX as his attempt at \\"experimenting and seeing how far [he] could push listeners\\" with his music. Brown explains that XXX is an effort at a serious concept album with a storyline, citing track 13 \\"DNA\\" as the start of Side B: \\"The cover looked like a vinyl to me, so I was going with that whole vibe\\". He explained that \\"the first side is all having fun\\" before the album takes a serious turn from \\"DNA\\" onward. While recording the album, Brown was listening to a lot of Joy Division.

Set in the Malnad region, the film narrates a story of the land and life of a feudal family in pre-independence Malnad. The film marked Karnad's return to directing after a lapse of over a decade. This is the only instance in the Indian cinema history where one Jnanpith Awardee directed a movie based on the work of another Jnanpith Awardee. Synopsis Subbamma (Tara), third wife of Chandre Gowda (Girish Karnad), is a rebellious mistress of the household and encourages sporadic acts of defiance against men from among her women friends. When her husband dies, she uses her position of authority to avenge all the wrongs ever done by man to woman. Her actions end up destroying her, and her place is taken by liberal intellectual Hooviah. Cast * Girish Karnad as Chandre Gowda * Tara as Subbamma * Mallika Prasad Sinha as Site * Srinivas Prabhu as Seregara (Manager) * Suchendra Prasad Production The film was shot on locations in the Malnad region at the foothills of the Western Ghats in Karnataka. The film was released on video in 2007. Background The novel by Kuvempu consisted of 700 pages and dealt with over 150 characters. It took Karnad eight months to reduce it to a feature film screenplay which concentrated on four main characters: Chandre Gowda, Seetha, Hoovayya, and Subbamma - Gowda's third wife. After the shooting began, the women of Megaravalli are returning to their native dress. Even the names of their houses were changed to the titles described in the novel. Director Karnad said that while the film did justice to the Kuvempu novel, it was only an attempt to portray the complexities of the women characters in Kuvempu's work through an attempt to show the three different aspects of womanhood in a feudal set-up, and the novel itself could not be depicted in full. Reception After release, the film rekindled the interest in the novel and approximately 2,000 copies were reprinted.

In 1490,more probably, as has been suggested by Heleen Murre-van den Berg, 1499) two Christians from Malabar arrived in Gazarta to petition the East Syrian patriarch to consecrate a bishop for their church. Two monks of the monastery of Mar Awgin were consecrated bishops and were sent to India. The patriarch Eliya V (1503‚Äì04) consecrated three more bishops for India in April 1503. These bishops sent a report to the patriarch from India in 1504, describing the condition of the church in malabar and reporting the recent arrival of the Portuguese. Eliya had already died by the time this letter arrived in Mesopotamia, and it was received by his successor, Shemon VI (1504‚Äì38).MSS Vat Syr 204a and Paris BN Syr 25 The arrival of the Bishops on the Malabar On reaching India the bishops put in first at Cragnaoor, and introduced themselves as Christians to the twenty or so Portuguese who were living there. They were most kindly received, and helped with clothes and money. They stayed for about two and a half months. Before they left, they were invited to celebrate the holy mysteries after their own fashion: ‚ÄòThey prepared for it a beautiful place fit for prayer, where there was a kind of oratory. on the Sunday Nosardel[seven days after Pentecost],after their priests had celebrated, The Bishops were admitted and celebrated the Holy Sacriiiee, and it was pleasing for the foreign missionaries. Accounts of foreign missionaries In a letter to kingJohn III of Portugal dated 26 January 1549 Francis Xavier describe Yaqob Abuna as a virtuous and saintly man Francis Xavier wrote a letter from Cochin to king John III of Portugal on 26 January 1549, in which he declared \\"A bishop of Armenia (Mesopotamia by the name of Yaqob Abuna has been serving God and Your Highness in these regions for forty¬∑five years. He is a very old, virtuous,and saintly man, and, at the same time, one who has been neglected by Your Highness and by almost all of those who are in India. God is granting him his reward, since he desires to assist him by himself, without employing us as a means to console his servants. He is being helped here solely by the priests of St. Francis Y. H. should write a very affectionate letter to him, and one of its paragraphs should include an order recommending him to the governors, to the veadores da fazenda, and to the captains of Cochin so that he may receive the honour and respect which he deserves when he comes to them with a request on behalf oft the Christians of St. Thomas Your Highness should write to him and earnestly entreat him to undertake the charge of recommending you to God, since YH. has a greater need of being supported by the prayers of the bishop than the bishop has need of the temporal assistance of Y.H. He has endured much in his work with the Christians of St Thomas.\\"COSTELLIOE,Letters 232-246 In that same year Francis Xavier also wrote to his jesuit colleague and Provincial of Portugal, Fr.Simon Rodrigues giving him the following description: ¬ªFifteen thousand paces from Cochin there is a fortress owned by the king with the name of Ctanganore. It has a beautiful college, built by Frey Wcente, a companion of the bishop, in which there are easily a hundred students, sons of native Christians, who are named after St. Thomas. There are sixty villages of these Thomas Christians around this fortress, and the students for the college as I have said, are obtained from them There are two churches in Cranganore, one of St Thomas, which is highly revered by the Thomas Christians. This attitude of St. Francis Xavier and the Franciscans before him does not reflect any of the animosity and intolerance that kept creeping in with the spread of the Tridentine spirit of the Counter- Reformation which tended to foster a uniformity of belief and practice. It is possible to follow young Portuguese historians like jo√©o Paulo Oliveira e Cosca's line of atgument, yet they seem to neutralize the Portuguese cultural nationalism in their colonial expansion and the treatment of the natives. However, documents brought out from the Portuguese national archives recently help to confirm a greater openness or pragmatism in the first half of the 16th century).Arquivio Nacional torre do Tombo Lisbo:Nucleo Antigo N 875 contains a summary of letters from india written in 1525 and also the kings replay to it :Cf.OLIVERIA E COSTA,Portughese,Apendice Documental 170-178 Later years and death It seems that about the year 1543 Mar Yaqob, feeling the weight of years, withdrew from active direction of the affairs of the Serra and settled in the Franciscan convent of St Antony in Cochin; he had a long-standing friendship with the friars of that convent. Though not an outstanding leader, Mar Yaqob was at man of great integrity highly respected by all who knew him. In a letter dated 26 January 1549, Xavier urges the king of Portugal to show him special favour. One touching occurrence is related in connection with the death of Mar Yaqob. On his death bed he asked his friend Pero Sequeira to redeem for him the Knai Thoma copper plate grant recording the privileges of the Knanaya community, about which he had written to the king of Portugal in 1523, but which he had later given in pledge to a man in the interior for twenty cruzados. Before his death, he had the happiness of knowing that this had been done.A History of Christianity in India: The Beginnings to AD 1707 By Stephen Neill Page 199-200 The first half century (1500‚Äì1550) of relations between the Portuguese and the Thomas Christians were, in spite of misunderstandings, on the whole marked by cordiality and good will. Mar Yaqob had maintained good relations with the Westerners throughout the long period of his episcopate, and was rewarded by the good opinions expressed by many concerning him.

Upper Baoquan Reservoir The Upper Baoquan Reservoir was formed by excavating a valley above the lower reservoir and constructing a tall concrete-face rock-fill dam. The walls around the reservoir are blanketed with concrete and asphalt. The upper reservoir has a storage capacity of which can be used for power generation. Baoquan Reservoir The lower reservoir was formed by raising the height of the existing Lower Baoquan Dam while the Upper Baoquan Reservoir is located in a valley above the north side of the lower reservoir. During periods of low energy demand, such as at night, water is pumped from Baoquan Reservoir up to the upper reservoir. When energy demand is high, the water is released back down to the lower reservoir but the pump turbines that pumped the water up now reverse mode and serve as generators to produce electricity. The process is repeated as necessary and the plant serves as a peaking power plant. The lower reservoir can store up to of water.

Grand juries in the United States are groups of citizens empowered by United States federal or state law to conduct legal proceedings, chiefly investigating potential criminal conduct and determining whether criminal charges should be brought. The grand jury originated under the law of England and spread through colonization to other jurisdictions as part of the common law. Today, however, the United States is one of only two jurisdictions, along with Liberia, that continues to use the grand jury to screen criminal indictments. Generally speaking, a grand jury may issue an indictment for a crime, also known as a \\"true bill,\\" only if it finds, based upon the evidence that has been presented to it, that there is probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed by a criminal suspect. Unlike a petit jury, which resolves a particular civil or criminal case, a grand jury (typically having twelve to twenty-three members) serves as a group for a sustained period of time in all or many of the cases that come up in the jurisdiction, generally under the supervision of a federal U.S. attorney, a county district attorney, or a state attorney-general, and hears evidence ex parte (i.e. without suspect or person of interest involvement in the proceedings). The federal government is required to use grand juries for all felonies, though not misdemeanors, by the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. While all states in the U.S. currently have provisions for grand juries, only half of the states actually employ them and twenty-two require their use, to varying extents. The modern trend is to use an adversarial preliminary hearing before a trial court judge, rather than grand jury, in the screening role of determining whether there is evidence establishing probable cause that a defendant committed a serious felony before that defendant is required to go to trial and risk a conviction on those charges. Some states have \\"civil grand juries,\\" \\"investigating grand juries,\\" or the equivalent, to oversee and investigate the conduct of government institutions, in addition to dealing with criminal indictments. See, e.g., these 2003 and 2011 grand jury investigation of this type in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania https://www.bishop- accountability.org/reports/2003_09_25_First_Philadelphia_Grand_Jury_Report.pdf https://www.phila.gov/districtattorney/PDFs/GrandJuryWomensMedical.pdfSee, e.g., this 2002 grand jury investigation of this type in Westchester County, New York https://www.bishop- accountability.org/reports/2002_06_19_Westchester_NY_Grand_Jury/See, e.g., a new report concerning of civil grand jury investigation in DeKalb County, Georgia on February 11, 2013 https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/judge-refuses- seal-grand-jury-report-burrell-ellis/242562226 History In the early decades of the United States grand juries played a major role in public matters. During that period counties followed the traditional practice of requiring all decisions be made by at least twelve of the grand jurors, (e.g., for a twenty-three-person grand jury, twelve people would constitute a bare majority). Any citizen could bring a matter before a grand jury directly, from a public work that needed repair, to the delinquent conduct of a public official, to a complaint of a crime, and grand juries could conduct their own investigations. In that era most criminal prosecutions were conducted by private parties, either a law enforcement officer, a lawyer hired by a crime victim or his family, or even by laymen. A layman could bring a bill of indictment to the grand jury; if the grand jury found there was sufficient evidence for a trial, that the act was a crime under law, and that the court had jurisdiction, it would return the indictment to the complainant. The grand jury would then appoint the complaining party to exercise the authority of an attorney general, that is, one having a general power of attorney to represent the state in the case. The grand jury served to screen out incompetent or malicious prosecutions. The advent of official public prosecutors in the later decades of the 19th century largely displaced private prosecutions.‚ÄúIf It's Not a Runaway, It's Not a Real Grand Jury‚Äù, Roger Roots, Creighton L.R., Vol. 33, No. 4, 1999‚Äì2000, 821 The federal constitutional right to have federal criminal charges screened by a grand jury is one of just a handful of provisions of the federal Bill of Rights that does not also apply to state and local governments. Federal law Grand Jury Clause The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that \\"No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger . . . .\\"U.S. Const. Amend. V. Misdemeanors are not presented to a grand jury, and are instead charged by prosecutor's \\"information.\\" In the United States armed forces, an Article 32 hearing is used for a similar purpose. The grand jury right may be waived, including by plea agreement. A valid waiver must be made in open court and after the defendant has been advised of the nature of the charge and of the defendant's rights. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6 Rule 6 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure governs grand juries. It requires grand juries to be composed of 16 to 23 members and that 12 members must concur in an indictment. A grand jury is instructed to return an indictment if the probable cause standard has been met. The grand jury's decision is either a \\"true bill\\" (formerly billa vera, resulting in an indictment), or \\"no true bill\\". Selection Members of a grand jury are selected at random from the population of the district or division in which the federal grand jury convenes. All citizens have an equal opportunity and obligation to serve.https://www.ndd.uscourts.gov/jury/jury_handbook_grand_jurors.pdf Secrecy Grand jury proceedings are secret. No judge is present; the proceedings are led by a prosecutor; and the defendant has no right to present his case or (in many instances) to be informed of the proceedings at all. While court reporters usually transcribe the proceedings, the records are sealed. The case for such secrecy was unanimously upheld by the Burger Court in Douglas Oil Co. of Cal. v. Petrol Stops Northwest, 441 US 211 (1979).Powell, J. and Stevens, J.The opinion of the Court and a dissenting opinion, Douglas Oil Company of California v. Petrol Stops Northwest, 441 US 211 (1979), at Justia. Accessed 17 Jun 2013. The dissenting opinion was joined by Justices Burger and Stewart but concurred with the Court's opinion as to the importance and rationale of grand jury secrecy. Writing for the Court, Justice Powell found that \\"if preindictment proceedings were made public, many prospective witnesses would be hesitant to come forward voluntarily\\"; \\"witnesses who appeared before the grand jury would be less likely to testify fully and frankly\\"; and \\"there also would be the risk that those about to be indicted would flee, or would try to influence individual grand jurors\\". Further, \\"persons who are accused but exonerated by the grand jury [should] not be held up to public ridicule\\". United States v. Procter & Gamble Co., 356 US 677 (1958), permitted the disclosure of grand jury transcripts under certain restrictions: \\"a private party seeking to obtain grand jury transcripts must demonstrate that 'without the transcript a defense would be greatly prejudiced or that without reference to it an injustice would be done'\\" and must make its requests \\"with particularity\\". Further, First Amendment protections generally permit the witnesses summoned by a grand jury to discuss their testimony, although Dennis v. United States, 384 US 855 (1966), found that such public discussion permits release of the transcripts of their actual testimony. The Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 3500, requires the government to disclose to the defense any statements made by the accused to the grand jury, and, with respect to non-party witnesses, that after a witness has testified on direct examination at trial, any statement made to the grand jury by such witness be disclosed to the defense. Investigatory role The grand jury can compel a witness to testify. The target of a grand jury investigation has no right to testify or put on a defense before the grand jury. The U.S. Attorney's Manual anticipates the possibility of allowing investigatory targets to testify. The U.S. Attorneys' Manual states that prosecutors \\"must recognize that the grand jury is an independent body, whose functions include not only the investigation of crime and the initiation of criminal prosecution but also the protection of the citizenry from unfounded criminal charges\\" and that targets of investigations have the right to, and can, \\"request or demand the opportunity to tell the grand jury their side of the story.\\" Special grand jury United States law also provides for the formation of special grand juries. While a regular grand jury primarily decides whether to bring charges, a special grand jury is called into existence to investigate whether organized crime is occurring in the community in which it sits. This could include, for instance, organized drug activity or organized corruption in government. As provided in , the U.S. District Court in every judicial district having more than four million inhabitants must impanel a special grand jury when requested by a designated official of the Justice Department. State laws The grand jury clause of the Fifth Amendment has not been incorporated against the U.S. states.Hurtado v. California, 110 U.S. 516 (1884). As a matter of state law, nearly all states employ some form of grand jury, though only about half require a grand jury indictment to commence a criminal prosecution, and among those, many limit the requirement to felonies or even certain types of felonies. The size of the grand jury and the number of grand jurors required to issue an indictment varies among the states and even, at times, within a single state. California The California constitution requires each county to have at least one grand jury impaneled at all times. Grand juries are governed by Title 4 and Title 5 of the California Penal Code, as well as Government Code ¬ß3060 and other more general provisions. In addition, grand juries are not subject to the Brown Act. Most county grand juries in California do not consider criminal matters. A decision to present criminal cases to the grand jury may be made by the county District Attorney, but it is neither a constitutional nor a statutory requirement. These county-level grand juries primarily focus on oversight of government institutions at the county level or lower. This is why California's grand juries are often called civil grand juries. Almost any entity that receives public money can be examined by the grand jury, including county governments, cities, and special districts. Each panel selects the topics that it wishes to examine each year. A jury is not allowed to continue an oversight from a previous panel. If a jury wishes to look at a subject that a prior jury was examining, it must start its own investigation and independently verify all information. It may use information obtained from the prior jury but this information must be verified before it can be used by the current jury. Upon completing its investigation, the jury may, but is not required to, issue a report detailing its findings and recommendations. Most grand juries are seated on a fiscal cycle, i.e. July through June. Most counties have panels consisting of nineteen jurors, some have as few as eleven jurors, others have as many as twenty-three. Due to the length of service, grand jurors are usually selected on a volunteer basis. The grand jury is required to publish a minimum of one report containing a minimum of one finding and one recommendation. The published reports are the only public record of the grand jury's work; there is no minority report. Each published report includes a list of those public entities that are required or requested to respond. The format of these responses is dictated by California Penal Code ¬ß 933.05, as is the time span in which they must respond. County grand juries develop areas to examine by two avenues: juror interests and public complaints. Complaints filed by the public are kept confidential. The protection of whistleblowers is one of the primary reasons for the confidential nature of the grand jury's work. Grand juries may charge public officials of \\"willful or corrupt misconduct in office.\\" The accusation is tried as if it were an indictment, and may not be dismissed for political or extra-legal motives. The definition of \\"willful misconduct in office\\" is reserved for serious misconduct, that is, criminal behavior or \\"purposeful failure to carry out mandatory duties of office.\\"Steiner v. Superior Court, 50 Cal. App. 4th 1771 (1996) Florida In Florida, a capital crime (one for which the imposition of the death penalty is a possible punishment) must be prosecuted by presentment or indictment of a grand jury.Fla. Const. Art. I, ¬ß 15(a) Other crimes may be prosecuted by presentment or indictment of a grand jury, but in most cases, prosecution for a non-capital criminal offense is begun by an ‚Äúinformation‚Äù (charging document) filed under oath by the prosecutor.Fla. Const. Art. I, ¬ß 15(a) Kentucky In Kentucky, grand jurors are impaneled in each county, at the Circuit Court level (felonies only) for a four-month term (three panels per year). During the trial jury orientation for the given four-month term, the grand jurors are selected from the trial jury pool, although the method of selection is not necessarily random. The meetings are twice a month in most counties (however, grand juries in more populous counties such as Jefferson (Louisville) and Fayette (Lexington) generally meet more often), with each meeting usually going through 20‚Äì30 cases in a four- to five-hour period. The indictment rate is about 98‚Äì99%; the grand jury can broaden (about 1% of the time) or narrow (about 3% of the time) the counts in the indictment as well. Usually, fifteen to twenty grand jurors are required to report to meetings; the hope is that twelve will show to each meeting, which is the number of jurors required to hear cases (an additional juror may be kept as an alternate while other extra jurors are typically excused for the day). It takes nine yes votes to the question of probable cause to sign a true bill of indictment. Fewer than nine yes votes either causes a no true bill or a narrowing of the indictment (depending on the votes per count). The rules are very similar to the federal process; the grand jury usually only hears from law enforcement personnel, with the exception of property crimes, where store detectives or actual victims of theft or vandalism are called to testify. The only cases brought to the grand jury are those initiated from the Commonwealth's Attorney's office (the prosecutor for felonies). For the vast majority of cases, the grand jurors generally only hear a recitation of facts from the police report, crime laboratory & medical examiner reports, and other documentation generated during the evidence gathering process. Grand jurors can ask factual questions of the witnesses and legal questions of the Commonwealth's Attorney or Assistant Commonwealth's Attorney. The ability to broaden or narrow indictments does technically allow for grand juries to open new avenues of investigation, although since it is dependent on prosecutors for facts, this is very rarely done. Rules of confidentiality that apply to Kentucky grand jurors are similar to those that apply to federal grand juries. Louisiana The law of Louisiana is distinct from the other 49 states; it has a civil law legal system rather than a common law system. The start of a grand jury may be attributed to an 1805 enactment of a law requiring all \\"crimes, offenses and misdemeanors [to] be taken, intended and construed according to and in conformity with the common law of England.\\"LexisNexis ‚Äì 1978 Tulane University Tulane Law Review Provisions for a grand jury are spelled out in Article V Section ¬ß 34 (a) of the Louisiana Constitution of 1974 which states a grand jury shall consist of twelve members of a community, as peers of an accused, to weigh evidence presented to them to determine whether there is probable cause to charge the person with the offense. Secrecy is also covered, to be stipulated by law. Section ¬ß34 (b) provides for a witness' right to counsel stating, \\"The legislature may establish by law the terms and conditions under which a witness may have the right to the advice of counsel while testifying before the grand jury.\\" However, since a witness has no \\"right to counsel\\" under the United States Constitution, a Constitutional Amendment would be required to implement this language. Historically, a grand jury was empowered to investigate crimes committed within its jurisdiction, identify persons suspected of having committed offenses, determine whether there is probable cause to charge the person with the offense, and publish its findings to the court. This has changed over time, most notably in Article 209 of the 1928 Code stating the grand jury \\"is to investigate non-capital offenses triable within the parish only when called to their attention by the district attorney or the court,\\" and further removing the ability \\"to act as a censory body of public morals.\\" This effectively relegated the grand jury as a tool of the prosecutor. The 1950 Revised Statutes made a return to an 1870 provision that \\"any member of the grand jury is required, under penalty of law, to bring to the attention of his fellow members any violation of the criminal law which may have come to his personal knowledge, or of which he may have been informed.\\" This gives the view that a grand jury could initiate investigations or file charges on its own. Privileges against self- incrimination and the fact that a prosecutor can declare Nolle prosequi provides limitations. Although a grand jury may have the right to subpoena and to have persons and documents called before it, this is almost always limited to evidence and witnesses presented by a prosecutor. A grand jury is considered a jury of accusation and the petit jury as the jury of conviction. A grand jury may be presented with a bill of indictment, before or after a warrant of arrest on an indictable charge, at the discretion of a district attorney. He or she then presents evidence and witnesses to prove the charge. A grand jury can return a true bill, no true bill or a third option, \\"pretermitting entirely the matter investigated\\". This requires nine of the twelve grand jurors to determine there is not enough evidence presented to determine if a person should or should not be charged with a crime. A grand jury is sometimes referred to as the passive collaborator of a prosecutor or a \\"rubber stamp\\" for an indictment, especially if simple acceptance of the bill of indictment is returned as a \\"true bill.\\" If a \\"No True Bill\\" is presented by a grand jury, the case is usually dropped. If a defendant is incarcerated, unless there are other charges, a prosecutor declares nolle prosequi, resubmits an indictment with new evidence, or brings charges of a lesser crime then, providing there is no gross oversight, the defendant is released. The theory is that if a prosecutor cannot obtain a true bill, presenting the prosecutorial evidence with no defensive rebuttal, then a conviction is not likely. ; Suggestions for improvement A 1979 National Criminal Justice Reference Service (NCJRS) document identifies three steps that could be taken to remove the adversarial role of the grand jury and make them more independent; (1) giving the target of the grand jury investigation the opportunity to testify; (2) making a grand jury subpoena returnable only when the grand jury is sitting and identifying the general subject area of the investigation; and (3) recording all grand jury proceedings (except the jurors' deliberations), making them accessible for pretrial discovery. Minnesota Hennepin County, Minnesota (which contains Minneapolis) keeps a grand jury impaneled at all times. Each grand jury serves a term of four months, typically meets one day each week, and focuses almost exclusively on homicide cases. New York In the State of New York, while a person can initially be charged with a felony via a sworn written accusation alone (a \\"felony complaint\\"),NY Criminal Procedure Law ¬ß 100.10(5). the state constitution provides a defendant with a right to have all felonies prosecuted by way of a grand jury indictment.Procedure Law article 180, NY Const. Article 1, ¬ß 6. This right can be waived by a defendant, who can then be prosecuted using an indictment substitute called a \\"superior court information.\\"NY Criminal Procedure Law Article 195. Grand juries are composed of between 16 and 23 jurors (16 being a quorum for all proceedings) and indictments require a minimum vote of 12 such jurors.NY Criminal Procedure Law ¬ß¬ß 190.05 & 190.25. Grand juries may produce not only indictments but may direct the filing of misdemeanor charges in local courts, the removal of cases to Family Court, and may also issue \\"grand jury reports\\" concerning malfeasance of public officials and recommending their discipline.NY Criminal Procedure Law ¬ß¬ß 190.60 & 190.85. Both the prosecutor and the grand jury itself have the right to call witnesses to testify before the grand jury.NY Criminal Procedure Law ¬ß 190.50. With few exceptions, every witness who testifies before a grand jury receives transactional immunity automatically, whether they invoke their right to silence or not.NY Criminal Procedure Law ¬ß 190.40. If a grand jury is considering criminal charges against a person, that person has a right to testify before that grand jury, provided they make a timely written demand and then agree to waive their right to immunity.NY Criminal Procedure Law ¬ß 190.50(5). Despite this fact, an unwitting target of a grand jury proceeding has no right to be informed that their case is even being considered by a grand jury in the first place, unless they have already been arraigned on a felony complaint charging a related crime and are awaiting a preliminary hearing on that complaint.NY Criminal Procedure Law ¬ß 190.50(5)(a). A defendant held in the state may testify to the grand jury. Virginia The Commonwealth of Virginia requires that all felonies be presented to a grand jury either directly or, more often, after certification following a preliminary hearing in district court. Commonwealth's attorneys also have the option of obtaining a misdemeanor indictment from a grand jury. Grand juries are a part of the Commonwealth's circuit court system and they meet at the beginning of each court term.  Criticism  Jury makeup The most persistent criticism of grand juries is that jurors are not a representative sampling of the community, and are not qualified for jury service, in that they do not possess a satisfactory ability to ask pertinent questions, or sufficient understanding of local government and the concept of due process. Unlike potential jurors in regular trials, grand jurors are not screened for bias or other improper factors. They are rarely read any instruction on the law, as this is not a requirement; their job is only to judge on what the prosecutor produced. The prosecutor drafts the charges and decides which witnesses to call. Limited constitutional rights The prosecutor is not obliged to present evidence in favor of those being investigated. Individuals subject to grand jury proceedings do not have a Sixth Amendment constitutional right to counsel in the grand jury room, nor do they have a Sixth Amendment right to confront and cross-examine witnesses. Additionally, individuals in grand jury proceedings can be charged with holding the court in contempt (punishable with incarceration for the remaining term of the grand jury) if they refuse to appear before the jury. Media coverage is not allowed. Furthermore, all evidence is presented by a prosecutor in a cloak of secrecy, as the prosecutor, grand jurors, and the grand jury stenographer are prohibited from disclosing what happened before the grand jury unless ordered to do so in a judicial proceeding. In 1974 the Supreme Court of the United States held in U.S. v. Calandra that \\"the exclusionary rule in search-and- seizure cases does not apply to grand jury proceedings because the principal objective of the rule is 'to deter future unlawful police conduct,' ... and 'it is unrealistic to assume that application of the rule to grand jury proceedings would significantly further that goal.'\\" Illegally obtained evidence, therefore, is admissible in grand jury proceedings, and the Fourth Amendment's exclusionary rule does not apply. Intimidation tactic After a grand jury was commissioned to investigate whistleblowers organization WikiLeaks, grand juries have been accused of being used as an intimidation and persecution mechanism against whistleblowers who have been accused of leaking classified information. Rubber stamp for the prosecution According to the American Bar Association (ABA), the grand jury has come under increasing criticism for being a mere \\"rubber stamp\\" for the prosecution without adequate procedural safeguards. Critics argue that the grand jury has largely lost its historic role as an independent bulwark protecting citizens from unfounded accusations by the government. Grand juries provide little protection to accused suspects and are much more useful to prosecutors. Grand juries have such broad subpoena power that they can investigate alleged crimes very thoroughly and often assist the prosecutor in his or her job. Grand juries sometimes compel witnesses to testify without the presence of their attorneys. Evidence uncovered during the grand jury investigation can be used by the prosecutor in a later trial. Grand jurors also often lack the ability and knowledge to judge sophisticated cases and complicated federal laws. This puts them at the mercy of very well trained and experienced federal prosecutors. Grand jurors often hear only the prosecutor's side of the case and are usually persuaded by them. Grand juries almost always indict people on the prosecutor's recommendation. An unnamed Rochester defense lawyer was quoted in a 1979 newspaper article claiming that a prosecutor could get a grand jury to \\"indict a ham sandwich\\", a saying subsequently repeated by the chief judge of New York State's highest court, Sol Wachtler. And William J. Campbell, a former federal district judge in Chicago, noted: \\"[T]oday, the grand jury is the total captive of the prosecutor who, if he is candid, will concede that he can indict anybody, at any time, for almost anything, before any grand jury.\\" Police incidents The grand jury system in the United States came under renewed criticism following three high-profile cases in 2014, where police officers killed Michael Brown, Eric Garner, and Tamir Rice. In all three cases, after being presented the evidence, the grand juries voted not to return indictments. Public perception was that the officers involved had failed to follow proper police procedure. As a result, these grand jury decisions sparked protests across the United States. In 2020, a grand jury returned no charges for the police killing of Breonna Taylor. That result too sparked protests across the United States, especially in Louisville, Kentucky, the city where the incident took place. It also led to criticism of Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron, who supported the result, as well as calls for the grand jury transcript to be released to the public.  Reform of federal grand jury system  Due to the criticism against the federal grand jury system there are some reform proposals which include the following proposals: * Better instructions from judges to jurors about the grand jury's powers and its independence from prosecutors * Increased access to grand jury transcripts for suspects who are eventually indicted * Expanded safeguards against abuse of witnesses, including education about their rights and the presence of their attorneys * Notification of targets of investigations that they are targets * Optional rather than mandatory appearances by targets of investigations * An end to the requirement that prosecutors present defense evidence, and replacement with a requirement that grand jurors be informed that the defense was not represented in the hearing. Besides the above stated reform proposals, the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (NACDL) established The Commission to Reform the Federal Grand Jury, a bi-partisan, blue-ribbon panel that included current and former prosecutors, as well as academics and defense attorneys. The unanimous conclusions and proposals of this diverse group were contained in the publication Federal Grand Jury Reform Report & 'Bill of Rights'. Among the reforms detailed in that report were the right to counsel for grand jury witnesses who are not receiving immunity, an obligation to present evidence which may exonerate the target or subject of the offense, and the right for targets or subjects to testify. Researchers Erin Crites, Jon Gould and Colleen Shepard of the Center for Justice, Law & Society at George Mason University studied the experiences of prosecutors, defense lawyers, and retired judges in New York and Colorado. Four key reform recommendations emerged from their Evaluating Grand Jury Reform in Two States: The Case for Reform research study are: #Defense representation in the grand jury room, #production of witness transcripts for the defense, #advance notice for witnesses to appear, and #the presentation of exculpatory evidence to the grand jury. The Cato Institute, an American libertarian think tank headquartered in Washington, D.C., presented a report, A Grand Facade: How the Grand Jury was Captured by Government which addresses the history of, problems with, and reforms for the grand jury system. \\"Runaway\\" grand jury Occasionally, grand juries go aggressively beyond the control of the prosecuting attorney. When the grand jury does so the situation is called a \\"runaway\\" grand jury. Runaway grand juries sometimes happen in government corruption or organized crime cases if the grand jury comes to believe that the prosecutor himself has been improperly influenced. Such cases were common in the 19th century but have become infrequent since the 1930s. The 1935 Runaway Grand Jury in New York County was investigating gambling and mobster Dutch Schultz when jury members complained in open court that prosecutors were not pursuing obvious leads and hinted that the district attorney was possibly receiving payoffs.

Biography Sydney Leon Miller, was born on 24 December 1901 in Strathfield, New South Wales, the son of a newsagent. Miller attended Fort Street High School until the age of fifteen when he left to work briefly at a pharmaceutical importer and then as a trial apprentice in the process engraving department of The Bulletin. Inspired by the work of The Bulletin's artists, he took art classes at night at the Royal Art Society of New South Wales. In 1917 Miller joined Harry Julius and was associated with his company Filmads, which produced the first animated cartoons made commercially in Australia. As a freelance artist he contributed to many periodicals, including the Bulletin, Aussie and in 1920, Smith's Weekly. Miller was employed by Smith's for the next twelve years, to draw political, sports and general cartoons, as well as to write and illustrate film and stage reviews. In 1923 he married Susan Austin and they had two children, Robn in 1928 and Peter in 1930. Miller was a founding member of the Black and White Artists‚Äô Club in 1924. During the 1930s Miller continued to create newspaper comic strips, such as Curiosities, in Melbourne's The Herald and Nature Notes and Weird and Wonderful in Sydney's The Daily Telegraph. In 1938 he collaborated with Ted Maloney of the J. Walter Thompson agency to create Chesty Bond, designed with the idea of promoting the Bonds clothing company's singlets. Miller handled the advertising strip until he joined the Herald and Weekly Times in 1945 and the strip passed to another artist, Francis 'Will' Mahony. From 1942 to 1945 Miller published numerous comic books, with his single column spot, Animalaughs, which started in 1948 appearing throughout Australia, as well as being syndicated in England, Scotland and South Africa. Between 1945 and 1956 he worked for The Herald, where he created the strip, Rod Craig, in 1946 which ran until 1995 (a record for a continuity strip in Australia at that time). In 1955 he created a new daily strip, Us Girls, which appeared in The Herald on 3 December 1955, and ran until he resigned from his job in 1957 to enter into a partnership at Ajax Films, in the production of television animation and sound-slide films. In the mid-1950s he created a second advertising comic, A Little Bear Will Fix It, promoting the sale of adhesive tape for Behr-Manning. Miller retired in the mid-1960s. Miller's wife, Susan died in 1978 and five years later, he suffered a severe stroke and was admitted to Sydney Adventist Hospital, where he died on 31 December 1983.

The companies Cohen has been involved in since the 1980s include: Playnet Technologies, Voltage Capital, LAMIA, Aristo International and Ecast. In April 2012, Cohen was sentenced to 22 years in federal prison for a conviction on 15 counts of wire fraud, 11 counts of money laundering and three counts of tax evasion. He is currently serving a 22-year prison sentence at Terminal Island Federal Correctional Institution. Career In the mid-1990s Cohen put together a team of veteran video game producers, engineers, marketing specialists, and executives for Playnet, a public company listed on NASDAQ. Cohen was President, CEO, and Chairman of the company. Employees included Nolan Bushnell, the inventor of Pong and founder of Atari and Chuck E. Cheese; Joe Ybarra, who worked at Apple before joining Electronic Arts in their startup phase as a producer, and was president of Infocom and Sr. VP of Cheyene Mountain Entertainment; and Glenn Sblendorio, former CFO of Sony Entertainment. The company developed two main products: A touchscreen controlled \\"bar top\\", coin-operated video game machine and a digital jukebox, capable of storing an extremely large selection of songs and able to download new releases. Playnet, later Aristo International, had offices in San Francisco, New York, and Virginia. In October 1997 Playnet announced an agreement with Holiday Inn, a major international hotel chain, to launch a pilot program to install the video game machine in a minimum of six Holiday Inn and Crowne Plaza locations across the US. Playnet filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1998. Cohen was the founder of Voltage Capital, a company that Cohen claimed was involved in research and investments in solar energy and other forms of green technology. Personal life Cohen was born in Jerusalem, Israel. He migrated to the USA in 1987. He is married to Stacy Jean Stripling, also known as Stacy Cohen, who is the author of the book \\"Kosher Billionaire's Secret Recipe\\" published in 2007. Cohen was featured in the TV series American Greed. An entire episode about his scams were discussed in the Season 7 episode titled: \\"Dealing in Deceit\\". Conviction In 2009, Mouli Cohen defrauded investors of more than $28 million and two lawsuits were filed. Cohen told investors that his company, Ecast, Inc., was about to be acquired by Microsoft. Based on those false representations, victims purchased some of Cohen's founders' shares in Ecast. A federal grand jury in 2010 indicted Cohen on 32 felony counts of fraud and money laundering, and he was arrested in August 2010. In November 2011, Cohen was found guilty of 15 counts of wire fraud, 11 counts of money laundering, and three counts of tax evasion. He was acquitted of six additional charges. After the verdict, Cohen was remanded into custody by judge Charles Breyer. U.S. Attorney Melinda Haag said evidence at the trial showed that Cohen collected more than $30 million from defrauding over 55 investors, including actor Danny Glover and the Vanguard Public Foundation (a San Francisco-based nonprofit supported by Glover and Harry Belafonte that funded civil rights efforts). Cohen was cited as largely responsible for the eventual dissolution of Vanguard in 2011. Cohen didn't testify at trial and his lawyer said he expected Cohen would appeal the conviction. At the sentencing hearing, Cohen's lawyer asked for a reduced sentence as recognition of Cohen having given $2 million to charity but the judge pointed out that, \\"It's other people's money. The fact of the matter is that you gave their money to others and pretended it was yours.\\" The prosecution described Cohen as a \\"congenital liar and serial fraudster\\" and recommended to the court that Cohen be sentenced to between 30 years to life and be denied bail while awaiting sentencing. On April 30, 2012, Cohen was sentenced to 22 years in prison.

Representative leader At a winter meeting in 1876, Toohoolhoolzote had been appointed the head speaker for the Nez Perce bands of Joseph, Looking Glass, White Bird and his own for the coming meeting with U.S. Army General Oliver O. Howard. The leaders allowed him to speak for them, and to deny or allow the military's demands. Numbers by band In the upcoming conflict his following of 50 people was fourth in size after Joseph's (about 300 people), White Bird (about 250 people), and Looking Glass (about 70 people). These Nez Perce bands totaled about 660 men, women and children. Of those fewer than 200 were men. About half that number were considered in prime warrior age. As the conflict progressed, more bands would join, with a maximum fighting strength of 250 or less. This includes about 25 Palus men under the chief Hahtalekin (also known as Taktsoukt Jlppilp - \\"Echo\\" or \\"Red Echo\\") and Husishusis Kute (Husis Husis Kute, Hush-hush-cute - \\"Bald Head\\", \\"Naked Head\\"). Native Americans' concerns One of the major concerns of the leaders was that they have sufficient time to prepare to leave and to move their livestock. They wanted to wait until autumn as a minimum, or ideally, a year. Toohoolhoolzote also expressed the natives' reluctance to sell their land, which went against their religious beliefs. Conflict The military, on the other hand, demanded that they be moved in 30 days, or the soldiers would use force. General Oliver O. Howard put this to them strongly, after Toohoolhoolzote began to speak on the sacredness of the Earth to his people: Toohoolhoolzote stood up to General Howard, and told him he would not obey. Yellow Wolf reported the final words: This arrest was one of the events which ultimately led to the war. Simiakia Toohoolhoolzote's use of the Nez Perce word simiakia is not clearly defined anywhere online. The following quotations illustrate some of its meaning. The quotes are from contemporary times, long after Toohoolhoolzote uttered the word. Faith As a follower of the Dreamer Faith, he tried to be a pacifist. The Dreamer religion called for throwing off white culture peacefully, by rejecting it and not participating in it. Yellow Wolf said of him: Although he advocated for peace, when pushed he became a strong fighter, labeled \\"fighter from hell\\" by writers of the era. Name According to the Nez Perce dictionary, Toohoolhoolzote was a transliteration of tukulkulc√∫·êßt, which meant antelope.

Plot summary Blondie proves to be a real nuisance to her husband Dagwood and causes domestic disturbance in the Bumstead home, when she insists on getting a maid. Dagwood is forced to take the request seriously, and asks his boss, J.C. Dithers, for a raise. As a rule, Dithers refuses the raise, but instead he offers Dagwood and his family a two-week stay at a country house, complete with servants. The house is the size of a palace, formerly owned by Batterson, a newly deceased magician. With the consent of his wife, Dagwood accepts the offer, and they prepare for take off to the country. They arrive at the empty house during a terrible thunderstorm, and find out from a local that the place definitely is haunted in some way. When they enter the house they realize that the house truly must be haunted, since it shows definite signs of a poltergeist living there with chairs starting to move around. A man named Horatio Jones is in fact responsible for the haunting by moving the chairs, covered by a white blanket. He has been ordered to do this as an initiation to a lodge he is trying to get membership in. The haunting continues later in the night when two more persons, Anna and Eric Vaughn, arrive and pretends to be servants, and start a series of frightening events, like sliding panels and moving shadows. Later Anna and Horation disappear from the house, and Dagwood finds a newspaper clipping with a picture of Eric. He reads that his servant is responsible for plunging a knife into the back of an attorney, claiming that he stole Eric's inventions and gave them to Batterson, the former owner of the house. The clip also says that Eric claims to be the rightful heir to the estate and the house. When Blondie hears about this she regrets that she asked for servants in the first place. Dagwood sets out to catch Eric, and succeeds just in time to prevent the man from stabbing his own wife Blondie in the back. When the press hears about the events that lead to Eric's capture, they name Dagwood a hero, and he finally gets his raise from his boss.http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/69081/Blondie-Has-Servant-Trouble/  Cast  * Penny Singleton as Blondie Bumstead * Arthur Lake as Dagwood Bumstead * Larry Simms as Baby Dumpling Bumstead * Danny Mummert as Alvin Fuddle * Jonathan Hale as J.C.

Ciralsky fought the allegations and, in so doing, unearthed many documents, including, an incendiary memorandum from a top CIA official: \\" I'd like to know if he admits his family has actual contacts with right wing politicians like Prime Minister Netanyahu. If not contacts, then maybe his family has donated money to Israeli government causes. From my experience with rich Jewish friends from college, I would fully expect Adam‚Äôs wealthy daddy to support Israeli political or social causes in some form or other, perhaps though the United Jewish Appeal.‚Äù While under investigation by the CEG, Ciralsky was subjected to a polygraph test which ‚Äì one of the Agency's own documents suggests ‚Äì was rigged: \\"[CIA Director] Tenet says this guy is out of here because of his lack of candor‚Ä¶subject is scheduled for a poly‚Ä¶Once that's over, it looks like we'll be waving goodbye to our friend.\\" Ciralsky subsequently passed a polygraph test administered by the former chief of the FBI polygraph lab. Ciralsky subsequently sued the CIA for discrimination. The case prompted a CIA investigation of the CEG and led the Agency to hire the Anti-Defamation League to provide \\"sensitivity training\\" to CEG employees. During the case, it was revealed that Ciralsky's CIA polygraph administrator referred to him as ‚Äúthat little Jew bastard‚Äù when speaking to a colleague. Tenet conceded that the Agency's actions were ‚Äúinsensitive, inappropriate and unprofessional,‚Äù and could be construed as anti-Semitic. Ciralsky's 2010 deposition of CIA director George Tenet is considered unprecedented. Victoria Toensing, the former chief counsel for the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said that she had not heard of any such thing happening before. ‚ÄúUsually the agency tries to circle the wagons and protect the director from ever having to provide facts,‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúThe fact that he was privy to the gross violations that occurred here is what is significant.‚Äù After 12 years, Ciralsky withdrew his lawsuit. He said that he was not concerned about financial compensation, but wanted merely to bring facts into the public eye and to use them to spur changes in the CIA. He said that he was still ‚Äúproud of [his] service with the CIA and‚Äù had ‚Äúa deep and abiding respect for the organization and its mission.‚Äù 60 Minutes Following his departure from the CIA in December 1999, Ciralsky was hired by the CBS Newsmagazine 60 Minutes. His first story, \\"Death by Denial\\", which dealt with the scourge of HIV/AIDS in Africa, won a Peabody Award for Significant & Meritorious Achievement in Broadcasting & Cable.See also List of Peabody Award winners (2000‚Äì09) While he was at 60 Minutes, Ciralsky's stories were nominated for three Emmy Awards. During that time, he also helped track down and interview the only participant in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing to remain at large. NBC News In 2004, Ciralsky joined NBC News where his work covering the 2006 Lebanon War earned him his first Emmy. His multi-part series entitled Trophy, about U.S. Army efforts to scuttle an Active Protection System designed to shoot down rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs), earned Ciralsky his second Emmy as well as the George Polk Award for special achievement in journalism; specifically for ‚Äúinvestigative and enterprise work that is original, requires digging and resourcefulness, and brings results.‚Äù The Trophy series also went on to win the Gerald Loeb Award for Distinguished Business and Financial Journalism in the Television Daily category and the Barone Award from the Radio and Television Correspondent Association (RTCA) for excellence in Washington-based reporting on national affairs and public policy. Ciralsky followed Trophy with another multi-part series about the U.S. Army's decision to ban Dragonskin, a flexible form of body armor, and instead force soldiers to wear Army-issue body armor called Interceptor. The body armor series won Ciralsky his third Emmy award. While at NBC News, Ciralsky earned an additional four Emmy nominations. Vanity Fair Ciralsky became a contributing writer at Vanity Fair in 2009, later joining the masthead as contributing editor in 2018. He has written numerous high-profile, long-form investigatory pieces for Vanity Fair, including: * ‚ÄúTycoon, Contractor, Soldier, Spy,‚Äù an in-depth profile of Blackwater founder Erik Prince.

(November 2018) P3 Media In 2008, Ciralsky started his own production company, Physics Package Productions, which in 2008 became P3 Media. In addition to developing original concepts for film and television, the company adapts Ciralsky's original reporting and investigative work for the screen. In 2018, Ciralsky's P3 Media signed a first-look deal with ABC Studios for scripted content. The company's first project was a primetime docu-series on NBC, titled The Wanted. The series was canceled because of bad ratings after two episodes domestically and six episodes internationally. The show's premiere focused on Mullah Krekar, an Iraqi refugee living in Norway since 1991 who is also one of the founders and early leaders of the Ansar al- Islam organization, an Islamist group considered a terrorist organization by U.N. authorities as well as by the European Union. In 2003, the deportation of Krekar from Norway to Iraq was ordered, but the order was suspended due to concerns about the human rights situation in Iraq, particularly the risk that Krekar would be tortured or executed. In November 2014, a motion picture adaptation of Ciralsky's ‚ÄúTycoon, Contractor, Soldier, Spy‚Äù was announced, with Ciralsky, Nicolas Chartier, and Craig Flores as producers.https://deadline.com/2014/11/blackwater-erik-prince-voltage- iraq-1201282746/https://variety.com/2014/film/news/nicolas-chartier- developing-biopic-on-blackwater-founder-1201355024/ Two months later, Stuart Beattie signed on to write the script.https://deadline.com/2015/01/erik- prince-blackwater-stuart-beattie-voltage-1201354442/ Ciralsky's Vanity Fair piece, \\"Harveygeddon: Inside Harvey Weinstein‚Äôs Frantic Final Days,\\" was optioned in March 2018 by Ryan Murphy and Fox 21 Television Studios. In 2019, it was announced that Ciralsky's Vanity Fair piece, \\"Tycoon, Contractor, Soldier, Spy,\\" will serve as the basis for the script of the forthcoming film Prince of War about the controversial life of Erik Prince, an ex-Navy SEAL and founder of the private military contracting firm Blackwater. The Somali Project Ciralsky co-directed and co-executive produced the feature-length documentary film, The Somali Project (originally titled The Project) along with his former 60 Minutes colleague Shawn Efran. The documentary profiles the Puntland Maritime Police Force (PMPF) as it takes \\"the hijacking of the African waterways and the kidnapping of innocent citizens into their under- trained hands\\" and \\"face mutiny, death and a loss of corporate funding in their dangerous quest to free the Middle East shipping industry from terror.\\" The film's world premiere took place at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2013. It was also shown that year at film festivals in Vancouver, Bergen and Austin, where it was nominated for the award for Best Documentary Feature.

It has three stages with rotating artists and several sideshow events and happenings. The first festival commenced in 2010 and since 2011, the festival has been held at √Ödalen in √Öbyh√∏j. The 2017 festival was attended by 40,000 people each day. The festival now goes by the name NorthSide to avoid confusion with the Northside Festival in Brooklyn. It is a privately owned festival, owned by Down The Drain Holding, who also owns the Tinderbox music festival in Odense and is shareholder in other music business activities in Denmark. Besides the musical profile and a goal of creating profit for its owners, NorthSide has a mission statement focused on innovation, sustainability, and customer involvement.  History  NorthSide Festival was initiated by Danish promoter Brian Nielsen, who then approached German concert-company FKP Scorpio. This company is owned by the German businessman Folkert Koopmans, who also owns the Southside and Hurricane Festival and now also owns a part of NorthSide. The rest is owned partly by a holding-company under Flemming Myllerup and Brian Nielsen and partly by Beatbox Entertainment. The festival launched in 2010 at Tangkrogen in Aarhus as a one-day event featuring five Danish acts (Nephew, Turboweekend, Mew, Selvmord, and Veto). In 2011 the festival moved to its current location in √Ödalen and expanded into a two-day event, which was sold out. The second edition of the festival featured acts such as Band of Horses, Suede, White Lies, Interpol, and Elbow. In 2013, the festival was expanded into a three-day event, which ran from 15 to 17 June. The event was completely sold out two weeks prior to the event selling 25,000 tickets in total. As of 2018, Down The Drain Holding (part of Down The Drain Group with Brian Nielsen as CEO) owns NorthSide Festival along with other music events in Denmark. It is the biggest independent festival and concert organiser in the Nordic countries. Down The Drain Holding saw some financial difficulties in the late 2010s but in 2018, US based equity fund Orkila invested heavily in the company.  Sustainability  NorthSide has an ambition of becoming the most sustainably driven and environmentally conscious festival in the Nordic countries. Since 2015, the festival has developed reports in collaboration with local counselling company Worldperfect on their progress in this regard. In 2017, the festival reached part of the ambitious sustainability goals, when all food, wine, champagne and coffee were organic products. All other products for sale was close to 100% organic origin as well. The sustainability also extends to green energy and waste control. Customers pays a deposit for plastic cups which is then refunded when the cups are returned. In this way 91% of sold plastic cups were returned for recycling in 2017. All in all, 78%, amounting to 210 tons of all waste, was sorted in sixteen categories and subsequently recycled. NorthSide has a goal of running on CO2-neutral green energy exclusively by 2020 but in 2017, the festival used only 10% green energy (solar and wind).

The Byzantine army of the East had been weakened by a mutiny in April 588, caused by unpopular cost-cutting measures and directed against the new commander, Priscus. Priscus was attacked and fled the army camp, and the mutineers chose the dux of Phoenice Libanensis, Germanus, as their temporary leader. Emperor Maurice then restored the former commander, Philippicus, to the post, but before he could arrive and take control, the Persians, taking advantage of the disorder, invaded Byzantine territory and attacked Constantina. Germanus organized a force of a thousand men which relieved the siege. As the historian Theophylact Simocatta records, \\"with difficulty [Germanus] spurred on and incited the Roman contingents with speeches\\" and managed to assemble 4,000 men and launch a raid into Persian territory. The arrival of Maurice's envoy Aristobulus eased the tension in the Byzantine camp, and the soldiers were restored to discipline. Germanus then led his army north to Martyropolis, from where he launched another raid across the border into Arzanene. The attack was blocked by the Persian general Maruzas (and possibly corresponds also with the raid defeated in battle at Tsalkajur near Lake Van by the Persian marzban of Armenia, Aphrahat), and turned back. The Persians under Maruzas followed close behind, and a battle was fought near Martyropolis which resulted in a major Byzantine victory: according to Simocatta's account, Maruzas was killed, several of the Persian leaders were captured along with 3,000 other prisoners, and only a thousand men survived to reach refuge at Nisibis. The Byzantines secured much booty, including the Persian battle standards, and sent them along with Maruzas' head to Maurice in Constantinople.

Hodophobia should not to be confused with travel aversion. Acute anxiety provoked by travel can be treated with anti-anxiety medication. The condition can be treated with exposure therapy, which works better when combined with cognitive behavioral therapy. Signs and symptoms People with fear of traveling experience intense, persistent fear or anxiety when they think about traveling and/or during travel. They will avoid travel if they can, and the fear, anxiety, and avoidance cause significant distress and impair their ability to function.

Diagnosis The diagnosis is clinical. It is often difficult to determine if the specific phobia of hodophobia should be the primary diagnosis, or if it is a symptom of a generalized anxiety disorder or another anxiety disorder. Classification Hodophobia is a specific phobia as classified in the DSM-5. * Management Acute anxiety caused by travel can be treated with anti-anxiety medication. The condition can also be treated with exposure therapy which works better when combined with cognitive behavioral therapy.

Built in 1753, it is the oldest church in the province. Architecture and layout Blenduk Church, at 32 Letjen Suprapto Street in the old town of Semarang, Central Java, is located in a small courtyard between former office buildings. The Jiwasraya building is located to the south, across the street, while the Kerta Niaga offices are to its west. The octagonal church, built on a stone foundation and with single-layer brick walls, has its ground floor at street level. It is topped by a large, copper-skinned dome, from which it gets its common name; the Javanese word mblenduk means dome. The dome is supported by 32 steel beams, 8 large and 24 small. Two towers, square at the base and slowly rounding until topped with a small dome, are located on either side of the main entrance, while a cornice consisting of horizontal lines runs around the building; Roman-style porticoes covered in saddle-shaped roofs are located on its eastern, southern and western faces. Blenduk also features etched and stained glass windows, as well as wood-panel double doors at the south-facing entrance. The wooden pews inside Blenduk have rattan seats, while the pulpit is completely made of wood and located on an octagonal platform made of teak. A nonfunctional Baroque pipe organ from the 1700s is also located inside. The floor is covered in black, yellow, and white tiles. In the northern part of the interior is a spiral staircase, etched with name of its manufacturer, (Rolling Mill, The Hague), which leads to the second floor. History Blenduk in 1940 Blenduk was established in 1753; the initial building had a joglo-style. Although meant for Protestants, Catholics also used it until the first Catholic church in the city, in Gedangan, was built. The church was later rebuilt in 1787. Another re-imagining, spearheaded by H.P.A. de Wilde and W. Westmas, began work in 1894. During this renovation, the dome and two towers were added. Another series of renovations began in the early 2000s. As of 2004, the church has 200 families in its congregation and holds regular Sunday services; it is also a tourist attraction. In 2003 the church celebrated its 250th year. Awards In February 2009, Blenduk received an award for Best Maintained Old Place of Worship from the Central Java branch of the Architects' Society of Indonesia.

History The mansion was built in the 15th century and is incorrectly considered to have been the home of Jean de Xaincoings, treasurer of the assets of Charles VII. The house was the property of Ren√© Gardette, a descendant of a family of silk merchants from Tours. The reworking of the facade that dates from the 16th century includes the addition of the porch and loggia and the left wing in early Renaissance style. The sub-basement contains Galloroman remains. The name Go√ºin is taken from a wealthy family of Breton bankers who purchased the building in 1738. The family undertook several improvements including the balcony over the rear courtyard, demolition of two houses on the roadside, the enlargement of the south yard, removal of the south balcony, and construction of the entry gate. In 1944 during the Second World War the building was almost entirely destroyed by bombs leaving only the facade intact. In the 1950s the main accommodation and the entrance were partially restored, while no traces of the garden and north yard remain. The building once hosted the Soci√©t√© arch√©ologique de Touraine (Touraine Archeological Society), and is now the home of the Go√ºin Museum. In 1967, on the occasion of the 40th congress of the French Federation of Philatelic Societies, the building was featured on the 0.40 franc postage stamp.

Recorded at Unique Recording Studios in New York City, New York, it was produced by Bob Held and features nine cover versions of songs by classic blues artists and three original tracks (two co-written by Mike Himelstein, one by Will Jennings). The album was released on August 26, 2003 by Medalist Entertainment and reached number 8 on the US Billboard Top Blues Albums chart. Named after the song of the same name by The Jeff Beck Group, a recording of which is featured on the album, Blues Deluxe was reportedly not originally intended to serve as Bonamassa's third album, but was ultimately deemed to be of high enough quality for release. The album received generally positive reviews from critics, with commentators praising Bonamassa's renditions of several blues standards, as well as the quality of his three original compositions on the album. Background and release Joe Bonamassa recorded Blues Deluxe at Unique Recording Studios in New York City, New York with producer Bob Held and engineer Gary Tole. Recording began in May 2003 and was completed by June. Following the conclusion of the touring cycle in promotion of his 2002 release So, It's Like That, Bonamassa recorded a number of blues songs to \\"blow off some steam\\", after his performances of such tracks were well-received by live audiences. According to the album's press release, \\"The resulting masters were so compelling that Bonamassa and his label decided to finish the record and release Blues Deluxe\\". The album features nine cover versions and only three original tracks ‚Äì \\"I Don't Live Anywhere\\", \\"Mumbling Word\\" (both co-written by Mike Himelstein) and \\"Woke Up Dreaming\\" (co-written by Will Jennings). Due to its abundance of blues covers, Brian Reiser of record label J&R; Adventures suggested that \\"Blues Deluxe is Joe's way of asserting that he above all else is a bluesman\\", describing it as \\"a return to Joe's deepest blues roots\\". The album is named after the song \\"Blues Deluxe\\" by The Jeff Beck Group, a cover of which is featured on the release. Reception Commercial Blues Deluxe debuted on the US Billboard Blues Albums chart at number 8, its peak position, for the week of September 13, 2003. It spent a total of eight weeks on the chart, and is Bonamassa's latest release (and only release, besides his 2000 debut studio album A New Day Yesterday) to not reach the top five of the chart. Critical Media response to Blues Deluxe was generally positive. Writing for AllMusic, Mark Keresman praised Bonamassa's \\"fierce, scorching guitar\\" as the highlight of the album, adding that \\"If axemen such as Peter Green, Rory Gallagher, and Buddy Guy are your cup of tea, this Deluxe item is a necessity.\\" Vintage Guitar magazine's Dave Hussong hailed Blues Deluxe as \\"One of the best \\"traditional\\" blues releases from late in the Year of the Blues\\", praising Bonamassa's \\"diversity\\" and praising him as \\"bordering on peerless\\". Blues magazine's Ed Mitchell named the guitar solo in the album's title track as one of Bonamassa's ten best in a 2015 feature, outlining that \\"There's a stripped down Chicago blues club vibe to this one.

The second dorsal fin and the anal fin are roughly the same size. The pectoral fins are rounded and shorter than the length of the head. The ventral fins are pointed and fused with a bridge of skin (a frenum). The caudal fin is rounded and are about the same length as the head. This goby is reddish-green on its dorsal surface with a number of small black spots. The head has short black lines.

The line links Winterthur in the canton of Zurich with Schaffhausen in the canton of Schaffhausen. The Rheinfall Railway was constructed by the independent Rheinfallbahn-Gesellschaft. Towards its northern end, the Rheinfall Railway crosses the Rhine on a viaduct adjacent to the famous Rhine Falls, from which it takes its name.  History  The Rheinfallbahn-Gesellschaft was founded in 1853 by the Schaffhausen industrialist Heinrich Moser. Construction of the line commenced in 1855, and it was opened on 16 April 1857. The section of line between Andelfingen and Schaffhausen proved particularly difficult and costly to build, including as it does major bridges across the rivers Rhine and Thur, together with a tunnel under Laufen Castle. The Swiss Northeastern Railway (NOB) acquired the Rheinfallbahn-Gesellschaft on 4 November 1856 prior to the line's opening, providing connections to Zurich and beyond. In 1902, the NOB became part of the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB CFF FFS), who retain ownership of the line. Until 1897, the Rheinfall railway provided the main railway route between Schaffhausen and the rest of Switzerland. However in that year the Eglisau to Neuhausen line opened, providing a shorter route to Zurich via B√ºlach that is now used by all long distance trains. The line was electrified on 11 April 1943. In 2007 its 150th anniversary was celebrated by the operation of historic steam trains over the line.  Operation  Today the Rheinfall Railway is served by two lines of the Zurich S-Bahn. The S16 provides an hourly through service between Zurich and Schaffhausen, with only limited stops on the Rheinfall railway section of its route. The S33 links Winterthur and Schaffhausen twice an hour, stopping at all intermediate stations. The northernmost section of the line, between Neuhausen and Schaffhausen, also carries all the traffic using the Eglisau to Neuhausen railway line, including most long distance trains between Schaffhausen and the rest of Switzerland, together with Zurich S-Bahn line S22 from B√ºlach to Schaffhausen. The line is predominantly single track with passing loops at stations, although there are double track sections between Hettlingen and Henggart, in the Marthalen area, and between Neuhausen and Schaffhausen. It is long, standard gauge and electrified at supplied by overhead line. The S-Bahn service over the single-track railway south of Neuhausen leaves little room for other trains, and most freight and long-distance passenger services use alternative routes.

Whatever the grounds on which the rescission of a judgment may be sought at common law, it is abundantly clear, the court found, that at common law any cause of action relied on as a ground for setting aside a final judgment, must have existed at the date of the final judgment. There must be some causal connection between the circumstances which give rise to the claim for rescission and the judgment. If a judgment is obtained in respect of a disposition not for value, no ground exists for setting aside such judgment merely because the disposition was not made for value and it is proved that, immediately after such disposition, the judgment debtor's liabilities exceeded his assets. It is only if insolvency or liquidation supervenes that such a disposition acquires legal significance by reason of the provisions of section 26 of the Insolvency Act,Act 24 of 1936. read with, in the case of a company, section 181 of the Companies ActAct 46 of 1926. But it does not follow that a judgment in respect of such a disposition can on that account be set aside under common law, for, when the judgment was granted, no grounds existed for setting it aside. The court was fully entitled to grant the judgment on all the facts, and the causa which existed at the date of the judgment. A judgment, as such, is not a disposition \\"made by an insolvent,\\" as contemplated by the Insolvency Act. In a case where the only purpose of taking judgment is to enable the judgment creditor to enforce his right to payment of the debt under a mortgage bond, by means of execution, if need be, it seems realistic, and in accordance with the views of the Roman-Dutch writers, to regard the judgment not as novating the obligation under the bond, but rather as strengthening or reinforcing it. The court held that a trustee or liquidator is not privy to the insolvent or to the company in liquidation. He is not bound by any judgment against the insolvent or the company to which he was not a party, and a plea of res judicata cannot be raised against him in respect of such a judgment because he does not derive his authority from the insolvent or the company; he has an independent right of action under the Insolvency Act. Accordingly, where the liquidator of a company claimed an order setting aside a mortgage bond and an order for the cancellation of the bond on the ground that the bond constituted a disposition without value in terms of section 26 of the Insolvency Act, read with section 181 of the Companies Act, the Court held that a plea of res judicata, founded on the fact that the creditor had obtained a final judgment against the company based on the mortgage bond, could not be successful if raised against the liquidator. The decision in the South West Africa Division, in Dyke NO v Swadif (Pty.) Ltd, was thus confirmed in part and reversed in part.

Michael Straczynski, under the Babylonian Productions label in association with Straczynski‚Äôs Synthetic Worlds Ltd. and Warner Bros. Domestic Television. After the successful airing of a backdoor pilot movie, Warner Bros. commissioned the series as part of the second year schedule of programs provided by its Prime Time Entertainment Network (PTEN). It premiered in the United States on January 26, 1994 and ran for the intended five seasons. Describing it as having \\"always been conceived as, fundamentally, a five year story, a novel for television\\", Straczynski wrote 92 of the 110 episodes and served as executive producer, along with Douglas Netter. Set between the years 2257 and 2262, it depicts a future where Earth has sovereign states and a unifying Earthgov. Colonies within the solar system, and beyond, make up the Earth Alliance and contact has been made with numerous spacefaring races. The ensemble cast portray alien ambassadorial staff and humans assigned to the five mile long Babylon 5 space station, a centre for trade and diplomacy. Described as \\"one of the most complex programs on television\\" the various story arcs drew upon the prophesies, religious zealotry, racial tensions, social pressures and political rivalries which existed within each of their cultures, to create a contextual frame for the motivations and consequences of the protagonists actions. With a strong emphasis on character development set against a backdrop of conflicting ideologies on multiple levels, Straczynski wanted \\"to take an adult approach to SF, and attempt to do for television SF what HILL STREET BLUES did for cop shows.\\" The original show spawned a multimedia franchise of spin-offs consisting of a miniseries, five television movies, twenty-two novels, two tabletop games (an RPG and a wargame), and various other media such as technical books, comics, and trading cards.  Television movies  During and after production of Babylon 5, six television films set in the Babylon 5 universe were produced. * The Gathering (February 22, 1993) * In the Beginning (January 4, 1998) * Thirdspace (July 19, 1998) * The River of Souls (November 8, 1998) * A Call to Arms (January 3, 1999) * The Legend of the Rangers: To Live and Die in Starlight (January 19, 2002) The Gathering is the pilot, depicting the arrival of several major characters upon the Babylon 5 station in the year 2257. In the Beginning depicts the events of the Earth-Minbari War, as revealed in the first few seasons, in chronological order, and in greater detail than the main series. Thirdspace and The River of Souls are largely stand-alone storylines. A Call to Arms sets up the initial premise of the Crusade series, depicting the alien Drakh species releasing a nanovirus plague on Earth, which will destroy all life on the planet within five years, if it is not stopped. To that end, the Earth Alliance destroyer Excalibur is sent to look for a cure beyond Earth itself. To Live and Die in Starlight, also known as Babylon 5: The Legend of the Rangers, was intended as the pilot for the series of the same (Legend of the Rangers) name, but since the show was never picked up, it is now considered to be the sixth and last Babylon 5 telefilm.  Television spin-offs   Crusade  The spin-off series Crusade ran on TNT for 13 episodes, having been set up by the TV film A Call to Arms. The production team received help from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory to ensure that the series depicted space science and futuristic technology accurately, according to current scientific theory. However, creative differences between Straczynski and TNT caused problems; the network wanted more sex and violence, and forced Straczynski to begin the first episode with a fistfight. The sex-and-violence request was later withdrawn, and TNT allocated more money to Crusade, giving the actors better uniforms and new sets mid-season. However, due to further creative differences, TNT eventually decided to cancel the series after 13 episodes had been produced, but before any of them were aired. At the time of the cancellation, only hints of major story arcs had yet come into play, though unproduced scripts published online by Straczynski.  Legend of the Rangers  A television film titled To Live and Die in Starlight was produced by the Sci-Fi Channel. It was the proposed pilot episode of a new series titled Babylon 5: The Legend of the Rangers. Rescheduled after the September 11 attacks, the film aired on January 19, 2002. However, it was scheduled against an NFL AFC Divisional Championship playoff game. The pilot's poor ratings contributed to the lessening of the network's interest in a series pick-up, as did the poor reception it received from fans and critics alike, particularly for its depiction of a virtual-reality weapon, but the final nail in its coffin was the dispute between Warner Bros. and Vivendi Universal (owners of the Sci-Fi Channel) over revenue-sharing for the potential weekly series.  The Lost Tales  A new project set in Babylon 5 universe was announced by Straczynski at San Diego Comic Con 2006. Babylon 5: The Lost Tales is a set of mini- stories featuring established characters from the series, released direct-to- DVD. Production of the first anthology of two stories, named collectively Voices in the Dark, commenced in November 2006 with Straczynski writing, producing, and directing. It was released July 31, 2007. In a Usenet post on September 5, 2007, Straczynski stated that Warner Bros. \\"are most pleased as sales have been several orders of magnitude beyond what they anticipated.\\" On July 13, 2008, Straczynski revealed that he had no plans to continue The Lost Tales. He said that although the studio was interested in another disc, they wanted to budget the next installment similarly to the first. Citing his disappointment with the first release due to the low budget, Straczynski said he did not want to dilute Babylon 5's legacy with further sub-par stories. He stated that he would only return to the Babylon 5 universe if Warner Bros. wanted to do a large-budgeted cinema release.  The Memory of Shadows (unproduced)  In 2004 and early 2005, rumors widely circulated about a planned Babylon 5 film for theatrical release. However, on February 25, 2005, a post from Straczynski announced that the project had fallen through, and was, for all practical purposes, dead. The proposed film, titled The Memory of Shadows (TMoS), was written by Straczynski. Filming was to have begun in April 2005 in the UK, with Steven Beck as the director. During the \\"Spotlight on J. Michael Straczynski\\" panel at the 2010 New York Comic Con, Straczynski revealed, \\"I said to Warner Bros. a while back, 'When you‚Äôre ready to do something real with Babylon 5, either a big-budget film or a TV show, if you want to do one of those two things, call me; otherwise, don't bother me.' About a month ago the phone rang. I don't know where this is gonna go yet, but when they call you, there's something going on. I can't tell you what it is yet, and it may not go anywhere, but there is movement in the tall grass.\\"  Untitled Feature Film Reboot  During the San Diego Comic Con event of 2014, Straczynski announced that he would soon be sitting down to write a Babylon 5 feature film, which is envisioned as a reboot of the iconic sci-fi series. JMS said that he plans to get the script locked down by the end of 2015 and the film would then enter production in 2016. However, this film has yet to be produced. Novels Unique to the Babylon 5 universe among virtually all other shared universes is the sanctioned canonicity of many of its offshoot novels and comic book stories; nearly all of the Babylon 5 novels and novelizations to date having been based on outlines written directly by J. Michael Straczynski. The later Del Rey books are considered to be more canonical than some of the earlier Dell ones, although ‚Äì per Straczynski's own remarks ‚Äì canonical elements exist in every single book published to date; Straczynski's deeper involvement in the novel-publishing program from 1996 onward having ensured a greater level of canonicity within such works. The seventh Dell novel has been described as 90% canonical, and the ninth novel is considered fully canonical by J. Michael Straczynski, with canon elements interspersed throughout the other books. # Babylon 5: Voices by John Vornholt (1995, ) # Babylon 5: Accusation by Lois Tilton (1995, ) # Babylon 5: Blood Oath by John Vornholt (1995, ) # Babylon 5: Clark's Law by Jim Mortimore (1996, ) # Babylon 5: The Touch of Your Shadow, the Whisper of Your Name by Neal Barrett, Jr. (1996, ) # Babylon 5: Betrayal by S.M.

Mongoose Publishing, publisher of the Babylon 5 role-playing game (RPG) material, announced plans to release a line of Babylon 5 novels and graphic novels, beginning in the summer of 2006. J. Michael Straczynski made it clear that he was not involved with this project, and considered the works to be \\"fan-fiction.\\" In 2007, Straczynski was writing the manuscript for a Babylon 5 graphic novel, which was to be published by Wildstorm Productions. The premise, characters, and plot have not been officially confirmed, but it has been reported that Straczynski originally planned to write a story that takes place before the Season Three two-parter \\"War Without End,\\" featuring Sinclair and Sheridan, and involving Mars, Minbar, Babylon 5, and a conspiracy. It has also been reported that he subsequently decided to tie in elements from the spin-offs Crusade and Legend of the Rangers into the book. The graphic novel was to be 100 pages long. When asked by a fan during the \\"Spotlight on J. Michael Straczynski\\" panel at the 2010 New York Comic Con, Straczynski said no new Babylon 5 comics were in the works.

Babylon 5 Mini-Comic A special ashcan-sized comic book was included exclusively with Best Buy-sold DVD copies of Babylon 5: The Lost Tales, written by series creator J. Michael Straczynski.  Cookbook  In 1998, the series briefly published a cookbook titled Dining on Babylon 5. Set during season 3 and ostensibly by the owner of the Fresh Air Restaurant, Emerson Briggs-Wallacewith, it was actually written by Stephen C. Smith. It was a limited run published only in the United Kingdom but made an appearance in one episode. In \\"A View from the Gallery\\", a character is shown reading it; since the book was not yet finished, a mock-up was used with a different cover. The book is, however, considered canon.  Security Manual  In 1996, the security manual for the station was published by Boxtree/MacMillan in the UK followed by re-issues in the US and Australia. Whilst written by Roger Clark, Allan Adams and Jim Morimore, it was in the style of the station manual and is considered canon.  Games  In November 1997, Chameleon Eclectic Entertainment published the original The Babylon Project: The Roleplaying Game Based on Babylon 5. In 2003, Mongoose Publishing printed the Babylon 5 Roleplaying Game & Factbook. The Babylon 5 Component Game system was also released in 1997 by 'Component Game Systems'. It was a complex political and military based game, using a number of individually purchased expansions or components, which could take up to 5 hours to play. Component Game Systems came out with a number of component game systems that used the same semi- collectible approach, and was derived from the unpublished Galactic Empires board game, based on the CCG of the same name‚ÄîCompanion Games (Galactic Empires' publisher) became Component Game Systems in the process. The basic idea is that each player need only buy his part of the game, representing in this case a specific political entity from the Babylon 5 universe. Players sit down at the same table and combine their components to have a game. 'Component Game Systems' folded in 1999 after having released only the first two 'years' (2258 and 2259) worth of Babylon related components for the game, and even their domain name (www.c-g-s.com) has been recycled by some unrelated group. A group of fans are working to release their own version of this game adding in elements from other games and material from the show not originally considered. The group manages its work within a group section of facebook.Babylon 5 CGS group Kenn Ferguson, Leo Dunin, Paul Woodroffe, William Minsinger, Wolfgang Lackner-Warton, Alexander Schneider, James Davis-Mann The Babylon 5 Wars wargame was first published by Agents of Gaming in 1998. The game was developed in close contact with the creators of the show, and most of the published material is considered canon.Graw, B. and Glass, R.: Babylon 5 Wars Second Edition Rules Compendium., page 1. Agents of Gaming, 2000 Agents of Gaming later published Babylon: 5 Fleet Action, which focused on battles of a larger scale. In 2004, Babylon 5: A Call to Arms was released by Mongoose Publishing after Glass took a job with that company. The game is similar in many ways to Babylon 5 Wars but some consider it to have more streamlined rules set and games may take a less time to complete. Precedence Entertainment produced the Babylon 5 Collectible Card Game between 1997 and 2000. In its original form, the game allowed for 2‚Äì4 players with each one playing one of the ambassadors to the B5 council: Sinclair, Delenn, G'Kar or Londo. Later expansions increased the maximum number of players that could play at once and expanded the players' options. Players could represent the League of Non- Aligned Worlds or could play alternative ambassadors such as Bester for the Psi Corps or Lord Refa for the Centauri. The game was discontinued after Precedence lost the license from Warner Bros. in 2000. There are no officially licensed Babylon 5 video games on the market, though in 1998 a video game based on Babylon 5, named Into the Fire, was being developed by Yosemite Entertainment, an internal division of Sierra Entertainment. Work on this game ended on September 21, 1999, when, as part of a corporate reorganization, Sierra cancelled it and laid off its development staff when the game was only a few months away from release. This game was to have cast the player as the pilot of a Starfury fighter craft, giving the player an opportunity to \\"move up through the ranks,\\" and eventually take command of capital ships and even fleets. Christopher Franke composed and recorded new music for the game, and live action footage was filmed with the primary actors from the series. A number of unauthorized Babylon 5 modifications have been created for other computer games such as Homeworld and Homeworld 2, as well as at least one (unlicensed) independent project to develop a standalone game. The only finished work as yet though is the free and standalone game \\"The Babylon Project\\" based on the FreeSpace 2 Source Code Project. Another unauthorized modification is being developed for X3:Terran Conflict by a group of fans working over the internet called X3: Babylon 5. The game is expected to feature many canon ship and station designs, work from the licensed materials, as well as numerous new art. The developers, including Amras Arfeniel, are still drafting 3D meshes for the game but hoped to begin game trials by Summer 2016. The team is not yet looking for testers but is recruiting 3D artists.X3: Babylon 5 ; Amras Arfeniel, Xell, Azodiac, Maverick, Anton Rosenthal, Hunter, SAVOTW, Momijisu, Paul Woodroffe In 2012 an independent group of fans of the Agents of Gaming game started work on a browser based game. The intention was to get as close as possible to the Tabletop Strategic game with the added advantage of playing on a worldwide scale. The game called Fiery VoidFiery Void (2012 ‚Äì ?) Coded by Aatu Riuttamaki and Jasper van Rosmalen is now in closed Beta testing and is intended to be used without any commercial goals. Another unofficial game is Babylon 5: I've Found Her, a freeware space combat simulator developed by Space Dream Factory, which‚Äîlike Into the Fire‚Äîallows players to fly Starfuries.

Axel Maurer (12 April 1866 ‚Äì 26 September 1925) was a Norwegian stagewriter, editor and theatre director. He was born in Kristiania. He took the law degree cand.jur. in 1889, but did not practise as a lawyer, as he instead traveled abroad to study theatre. From 1895 to 1896 he was the artistic and financial director of the Karl Johan Theatre in Kristiania.Salmonsens konversationsleksikonIllustreret norsk konversationsleksikon This theatre had been established in 1893 in the premises of Kristiania Tivoli, and led by Olaf Hansson before Maurer took over, but it went defunct in 1896.Salmonsens konversationsleksikon During this period he wrote and issued the play Lykkens Pamphilius, which was staged at Sekondteatret in 1900 to mediocre reviews. The same reception happened to his next play, Kundskabens Tr√¶, staged in November 1897 at Christiania Theatre. His play Babylons konge, staged at Nationaltheatret, received somewhat more mixed reviews. Another play, Arilda, was accepted by Nationaltheatret, but probably never staged. Maurer edited the humorous magazine Tyrihans from 1898 to 1899. His songbook Kristiania-viser, issued in 1906 with new lyrics to known melodies, was received well. He also embarked on recitation tours in Norway as well as in Denmark (1909), the US (1910) and Germany (1911). In 1917 he issued the novel Den store kj√¶rlighed, and the humoresques Portn√∏klen and Mindeb√¶geret in 1918 and 1919 respectively.List of publications in BIBSYS Maurer was not uncontroversial. In 1905, when Norway was about to dissolve the union with Sweden, he attacked the Negotiations in Karlstad in a leaflet which was sold on the street. The leaflet was soon forbidden by the Norwegian authorities, who did not want a critical viewpoint on the negotiations, according to the diaries of Johan Castberg. In 1915 Maurer attended the general assembly of Nationaltheatret. In the open discussion at the assembly, he denounced the presence of a \\"camorra\\" in Norwegian art and literature, which acted as a \\"secret society\\". The \\"camorra\\" had a secret influence over which plays were staged, and which artists that received grants. The purported \\"chairman\\" of this \\"camorra\\" was theatre critic Sigurd B√∏dtker. A debate was called in Kunstforeningen, where Maurer was asked to back his allegations up. During the debate it was pointed to a work by Axel Borge, which had supposedly been refused under murky circumstances, but Borge himself appeared to deny this and support B√∏dtker. B√∏dtker denied the claim of a camorra, and stated that the probable reason for the attack was the refusal of one of Maurer's plays. Maurer was strongly attacked by Nils Kj√¶r, and also received unfavourable comments from Peter Egge, Hjalmar Christensen and Arnulf √òverland. He died in 1925, only 59 years old. A street in Oslo, Axel Maurers vei, was named after him in 1934.

The marsh was used as pasture for summer grazing since Anglo- Saxon times. During the mid 20th century much of the marsh was given over to gravel extraction. The resulting flooded gravel pits were used for landfill which raised the profile of the site. On completion of the A1055 road in the late 20th century, the marsh was bisected from north to south.

It replaced the former Department of Forest and unified all the Provincial Forest Divisions and the Forest Industries Council. This restructuring was the result of the 1989 Barnett Commission of Inquiry into forestry in Papua New Guinea. The mandate of the PNGFA is to ‚ÄúPromote the management and wise utilization of the forest resources of Papua New Guinea as a renewable asset for the well-being of present and future generations.‚Äù  Background The PNGFA is overseen by the National Forest Board, which advises the Minister for Forests and gives directions to the National Forest Service, the operational arm of the PNGFA. Since July 2010, the Minister for Forests has been Timothy Bonga and in 2007 Kanawi Pouru was appointed Managing Director of the National Forest Board. Papua New Guinea has a total land area of 46.284 million hectares, of which an estimated 29.437million hectares is covered by forest. This land is home to an estimated 15,000 to 20,000 higher order plant species, of which over 2,000 are tree species and 400 may be currently utilised for harvesting, or other commercial uses, such as timber production or log exports. Of the forest land, 62,277 hectares is commercial forest plantations and PNGFA conducted a valuation of these plantations in 2005, with funding assistance from AusAID. The valuation found that the total estimated investment value of the PNGFA‚Äôs forest plantations is PGK123 million. An estimated 95 per cent of land in Papua New Guinea is owned and managed by customary landowners. Therefore, forest related operations, such as logging and reforestation, must be agreed upon in consultation between the PNGFA and the landowners. The PNGFA is headquartered at Hohola in the National Capital District, with 19 provincial offices and over 386 permanent employees throughout the country. The 2012 budget allocated to the PNGFA by the Department of Treasury is PGK11.8 million. Illegal logging According to the PNGFA, the total log harvest of Papua New Guinea in 2006 was 3,389 million cubic metres. However, in August 2006, the World Bank estimated that illegal logging could account for as much as 70 per cent of logging in Papua New Guinea, which would fall well outside the official national log harvest figures. Since 2004, Greenpeace has mounted an aggressive campaign against illegal logging in Papua New Guinea, after publishing a report indicating that 90 per cent of logging could be illegal. It is alleged that in response Rimbunan Hijau, the largest logging company in Papua New Guinea, at the centre of Greenpeace‚Äôs accusations, commissioned ITS-Global to write a report attacking Greenpeace. During 2008 the International Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO) helped to trial a new electronic tracking service at timber concessions in Papua New Guinea in a bid to restrict the levels of illegal timber trading in Papua New Guinea. Following this trial period, the government launched the two-year project, Enhancing Forest Law Enforcement in Papua New Guinea alongside the PNGFA. An ongoing Commission of Inquiry into Special Agricultural and Business Leases (SABL) has highlighted that despite the appointment of Pouru as Managing Director in 2007, the level of illegal logging has continued to grow in Papua New Guinea. Controversies In 1989, an attempt was made to kill the Australian judge, Tos Barnett after his commission published findings of its inquiry into corruption in the Papua New Guinea forest industry. As the Chairman of the Commission of Inquiry, Barnett later went on to state that the ‚Äúcontrol of forestry operations was left to the decentralised, dismembered, disorganised and demoralised forestry service administrating the toothless and out-of-date Forestry Act.‚Äù In 2008, the Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea quashed a decision to grant logging rights in the Kamula Doso forest area to Malaysian logging company Rimbunan Hijau, after the company admitted that earlier logging rights, previously granted to it, had been illegally obtained. In 2010, the report submitted by the Auditor- General to the Public Accounts Committee on the PNGFA found that PGK100 million (US$41 million) in public funds allocated to the Forest Authority from 1999 to 2005 could not be accounted for. The Auditor-General‚Äôs report reiterated substantive concerns about the failure of the PNGFA to maintain proper accounting. In response to these reports, Timothy Bonga, the then Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee stated that ‚Äúthe whole functional system of the (Forest) Authority has collapsed‚Äù.

In Thorn, she is known today as \\"the sick lady\\" and she is better known than her sister Anna Salome, although the latter presided over Thorn Abbey for more than 40 years as abbess. In 1673, Clara Elizabeth donated a Loreto Chapel. A magnificent epitaph in the St. Michael Church, the former Abbey Church, in Thorn, commemorates her.  Life  Clara Elisabeth of Manderscheid-Blankenheim suffered from disease most of her life. At times, she suffered from paralysis, convulsions and fevers. She would faint, or lose the ability to speak. For long periods, she did not tolerate any food other than milk. Nevertheless, she would care for other sick people. She would treat minor injuries herself, or give away medicine from her own pharmacy. Sometimes, as many as 50 people seeking help were waiting outside her house. She experienced an improvement in her health on 13 July 1681, when she was blessed by the miracle healer Marco d'Aviano. He blessed her from Liege and healed her to the point that she could get up and walk a few steps and even attend mass in the abbey church. She could also participate in the procession to celebrate the consecration of the Lorate Chapel she had donated (the chapel had been consecrated on the day she had been miraculously cured). On 24 July, she travelled to nearby Roermond, where she visited Marco d'Aviano.

Designed by George Vaughan Maddox and built in 1837, it retains its original galleries, organ loft and sophisticated pulpit. In common with many non-conformist places of worship in the town built when town authority lay very much with the established church, it was deliberately set back behind the houses to avoid making too prominent a challenge to the established order. This is one of 24 buildings on the Monmouth Heritage Trail and is Grade II* listed. History In the eighteenth century the new Methodists were challenging the presumption of the established churches in Monmouth. Visiting Methodist ministers were stoned and abused by unruly crowds who were encouraged by the churchwardens and gentlefolk.Bold, Rev. W. E. (1987), Methodism and its Beginnings in Monmouth, Monmouth Methodist Church They were sometimes seriously injured ‚Äì a preacher was killed by a blow in an open-air service near Hay-on-Wye in 1840. They persevered however and established their first chapel in Inch Lane, now called Bell Lane, a narrow alley off Church Street. John Wesley came to preach in the town, firstly in 1779, and four more times in later years, and a larger chapel was built in Weirhead Street as Wesleyan Methodism grew. Finally, as this chapel proved too small, the present church was designed by George Vaughan Maddox, a local architect who had worked on The Hendre. The 340 seated church with its impressive fa√ßade was built in 1837.Newman, John (2000) The Buildings of Wales: Gwent/Monmouthshire. Penguin Books Maddox included Ionic pilasters with round-headed Georgian windows on the first floor but with triangular window heads on the ground floor, and a fine pediment over all. The church is enhanced by the later Ionic porch. The box pews allow 340 worshippers in sit in three sections below and in a gallery that follows three sides of the interior. The pulpit was much higher than it appears today; it was lowered in 1885 while the floor was raised by two feet. As a consequence, the internal columns bases are not visible as they are covered by the raised floor. The Reverend Peter Mackenzie (1824‚Äì1895) The Reverend Peter Mackenzie was employed as preacher and he drew a large following; he had a personal relationship with many Methodists, whilst his sermons were filled with \\"grotesque descriptions and extremely funny stories\\". Mackenzie arrived from Burnley, Lancashire, and lived at Coleford with his wife and two children using a donkey to travel around the circuit. A lady visitor, Mrs Bullock, commented whilst waiting for the minister to arrive for the service that she would buy an organ if ever the church was full. The minister arrived and immediately the church had reached its capacity. True to her word an organ was purchased and installed in celebration of this achievement. This church is considered to be one of the most architecturally distinguished Methodist chapels in South Wales with an interior that reflects its purpose and design. According to the local Pevsner architectural guide:John Newman, The Buildings of Wales: Gwent/Monmouthshire, Penguin Books, 2000, , p. 399 \\"The interior, quite exceptionally for an early C19 chapel, is a coherent piece of considered architecture.\\" The church as a whole is described as \\"a most satisfying work.\\" The church today The church has morning and evening services every week with a family service every month.

The history and legends of the East Syriac prelates in India prior to the arrival of European explorers are shrouded in mystery because of the unavailability of surviving documents. The Vatican Syrian codex 22, the oldest surviving Syrian manuscript written in Malabar, specifically mentions an East Syriac bishop who was residing in Malabar at that time. According to this ancient document, (now in the Vatican Library), which was written by a Deacon named Zachariah bar Joseph addresss Mar Jacob as Metropolitan and director of the holy see of the Apostle St Thomas, the great captain and the director of the entire holy church of India. Introduction. The Christians of St. Thomas became strong enough to achieve independence. Before the coming of the Portuguese, St. Thomas installed Christian rulers of their own (Villarvattom) to be absorbed into the rajahs of Cochin.A handbook of Kerala, Volume 1 -Page 152 Quoted by T. Madhava Menon, International School of Dravidian Linguistics. The metropolitan of Angamali was assisted in the operations of his office by an archdeacon. The archdeacon was selected by the Catholics from the influential Pakalomattom family. Upon the death of the metropolitan, the archdeacon was left with the task of managing the office alone. He petitioned the patriarch to name a successor to the deceased metropolitan. Painting a comprehensive picture of this time in Ancient Indian Christianity remains an insurmountable task. The source material for this dark period, which existed in the East Syriac repositories of Mesopotamia and in the old records of the Indian churches, was destroyed by the Mongol hordes on the one side and by the Portuguese on the other. In fact, the vandalism of the Mongol invasions of the Middle East was only surpassed in this sphere by the repercussions of the Synod of Diamper in 1599. That act of faith simply led to the obliteration of all Indian records, since it was decided to burn all religious manuscripts tainted with the heresy of Nestorius.The history of Christianity in India: Volume 2 By James Hough Thus historic records of The Malabar Church became lost to time. Cardinal Tisserant, however, registers a few minor references bearing upon the later medieval history of that church. The first dates from the fourteenth century, when a copyist named Zaccharias bar joseph bar Zaccharias made an allusion to the Catholicos Yahballaha III (1245‚Äì1314) and to Mar Jacob, bishop of India, in 1301.MS Vat Syr 22; Wilmshurst, EOCE, 343 and 391.A History of Eastern Christianity (Taylor & Francis)-Page365 Patriarch Yahballaha III and the Metropolitan Ya øqob of India. The dating formula in the colophon to a manuscript copied in June 1301 in the church of Mar Quriaqos in Cranganoor mentions the patriarch Yahballaha III (whom it curiously describes as Yahballaha V), and the metropolitan Ya øqob of India(described as ‚Äòvicar and governor of the seat of the apostle Thomas‚Äô, and probably the bishop Yacqob mentioned as the scribe's tutor).. Cranganore, described in this manuscript as 'the royal city', was doubtless the metropolitan seat for India at this time. The scribe was the fourteen-year-old Deacon Zakarya, son of Joseph, son of Zakarya, who is described as ‚Äòthe pupil of the bishop Yacqob‚Äô.MS Vat Syr 22; Wilmshurst, EOCE, 343 and 391.The ecclesiastical organisation of the Church of the East, 1318-1913, Volume 582 By David Wilmshurst-Page 343 The colophon of the manuscript suggests the ongoing relationship between the churches of Seleucia- Ctesiphon and Malabar Christian inculturation in India by Paul M.

Podipara page 15 The language used by the scribe about the patriarch Yahballaha III, however, is intriguing. The dating formula reads as follows: > When the great governor, the holder of the key of the Holy Apostolic Church > of the East and the bright lamp illuminating its territories, the chief of > the chief priests, the father of fathers, our blessed and holy father, was > Mar Yahballaha the Fifth, the Turk, catholicos-patriarch of the East, the > chief region of the world, which guides and illuminates the other regions; > who stands above the Catholic Church like a lampstand to give light to all > its servants and to dispel its fears.MS Vat Syr 22; Wilmshurst, EOCE, 343 > and 391.Origin of Christianity in India: a historiographical critique By > Benedict VadakkekaraThe Christians of St. Thomas in South India and their > Syriac manuscripts by J. P. M. van der Ploeg ‚Äìpage 187. It is interesting to see the superiority of the East over the West upheld in this formula, as three years later, in 1304, Yahballaha acknowledged the primacy of the Roman Church.Phillips, p. 123 Protestant and Catholic scholars have long disputed the significance of this acknowledgement, and it seems likely that Yahballaha's acknowledgement in 1304 meant little in practice. It made sense for Yahballaha to cultivate good relations with Rome, but the recognition by the Church of the East of the primacy of the See of Saint Peter did not, in the eyes of the East Syriacs, give the Western church the right to dictate their beliefs. The colophon of MS Vat Syr 22 is an interesting indication of how the East Syriacs really saw themselves at this period. But there is one puzzling aspect of this colophon. It is not surprising to find the Ongut patriarch Yahballaha III referred to as a ‚ÄòTurk‚Äô. But it is surprising to find him referred to as ‚ÄòYahballaha the Fifth‚Äô. The standard lists of the Easy Syrian patriarchs know only two earlier patriarchs named Yahballaha, viz. Yahballaha I (415‚Äì20) and Yahballaha II (1190‚Äì1222). None of the known anti-patriarchs were named Yahballaha. Contact with Western missionaries About the same time, unexpected circumstances briefly provided the Indian Church with western contacts. Two of those visitors stand out as particularly important from the viewpoint of inter-Christian relations. The first was the Dominican Friar Jordan Catalanl of Sevcrar: [d.c. 1336) who, after the first stay in India, prompted Pope John XXII (1361-44] to establish the first Latin-rite diocese in the subcontinent at Quilon.Primary sources Of Jordanus' Epistles there is only one MS., viz. Paris, National Library, 5006 Lat., fol. 182, r. and v.; of the Mirabilia also one MS. only, viz. London, British Museum, Additional MSS., 19,513, fols. 3, r.f 2 r. It was, however, a very short-lived attempt. The second was the Franciscan and papal envoy John de Marignolli. who stayed in Quilon for sixteen months In 1348-49.Fontes rerum bohemicarum, iii. 492-604 (1882). Their reports, as well as those of other such casual visitors, help us to get a clearer picture of Eastern Christianity in India in these centuries. In the 1320s the anonymous biographer of the patriarch Yahballaha III and his friend Rabban Bar Sauma praised the achievement of the Church of the East in converting 'the Indians, Chinese and Turks'.Wallis Budge, The Monks of Kublai Khan, 122‚Äì3.

Description √éle aux Cochons photographed from on Loch Etive in between 1885 and 1911. √éle aux Cochons photographed from on Loch Etive in between 1885 and 1911. √éle aux Cochons is the westernmost island of the archipelago, lying some 30 km north-west of √éle des Pingouins and 15 km south- west of the √élots des Ap√¥tres. It is an eroded volcanic dome, scattered with inactive craters, and a coastline consisting partly of low cliffs. Introduced species include cats, rabbits and mice. The introduced pigs that gave the island its name have been eradicated. There is no human infrastructure and visits by researchers are rare. Important Bird Area The island has been identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International as a breeding site for seabirds, and notably for its large penguin populations. It held the world's largest king penguin colony, with about half a million breeding pairs in the 1980s, but by 2018 this had fallen to 60,000 pairs, for as yet unexplained reasons. There are also substantial numbers of gentoo, macaroni and northern rockhopper penguins. It also has the largest colony of wandering albatrosses in the Indian Ocean, with some 1200 pairs, as well as four million pairs of medium-billed prions and a million pairs of South Georgia diving petrels. Eaton's pintails are present. There are large populations of southern elephant seals, Antarctic fur seals and subantarctic fur seals.BirdLife International. (2012). Important Bird Areas factsheet: √éle aux Cochons. Downloaded from http://www.birdlife.org on 2012-01-09. Penguin population decline In a 2018 report in Antarctic Science, researchers estimated that the population of King penguins on the island had dwindled from 500,000 breeding pairs to just 60,000. With the last count of penguin population in 1982, the most recent demonstrates an 88% decrease in colony population. Researchers are still uncertain of the cause but have suggested climate change, disease, or resource scarcity. A research expedition to the island is planned for late fall of 2019.

Seven of these matches have since been decreed as Test matches by the Australian Rugby Union and Loudon, who led the side in one such match in 1928, was therefore a captain of the Australian national team. After rugby union restarted in Queensland in 1929, and national selections were made from the two states Loudon played in six further full Australian Wallaby Test sides. In addition to his thirteen Test matches he made a further twenty-one tour match appearances for representative Australian sides on three international tours between 1923 and 1933. Rugby career Loudon, was born in Leeston, New Zealand and initially attended Christ's College, Christchurch. He relocated to Sydney during his youth and attended Sydney Grammar School. He was proficient in competitive Surf Life Saving at Sydney's Manly Beach and stroked the Manly Surf Club boat to win the national championship in 1927-28. Loudon made his representative debut on the New South Wales tour to New Zealand in 1923 as a versatile back. He played in eight of the ten matches, including three Tests (one as a replacement). He appeared on tour as a centre, fullback and winger. With no Queensland Rugby Union administration or competition in place from 1919 to 1929, the New South Wales Waratahs were the top Australian representative rugby union side of the period and a number of their 1920s fixtures played against full international opposition were decreed by the Australian Rugby Union in 1986 as official Test matches. Loudon made six such appearances against New Zealand XVs and one against a New Zealand MƒÅori rugby union team on two tours to New Zealand. By his second tour of 1928 Loudon was a specialist flanker. He captained the Waratahs side in the second Test match of that 1928 series as well as in two tour games and thus qualifies as an Australian national rugby union team captain. Howell asserts that Loudon was a certainty for the 1927‚Äì28 Waratahs tour of the British Isles, France and Canada and would have earned a more highly regarded name in Australian rugby folklore but for the fact that he declared himself unavailable for the tour. He made a Test appearance in 1929 again opposite New Zealand and then in 1933 was selected for the first-ever Wallaby tour of South Africa. He played in four Tests on tour and in 10 other minor matches. In 1934 he made further state representative appearances for New South Wales and played his final Test match, all against New Zealand in Sydney. His brother Darby Loudon also represented for Australia in rugby union and captained the national side. Bob and Darby were the first pairs of brothers to captain their country in international rugby.

It contains two species. Description Oplopomus is characterized by elongated bodies and compressed heads. They possess 24 to 30 ctenoid scales on the body, becoming cycloid on the nape before disappearing just behind the eyes. Their snouts are short and round, smaller than the diameter of the eyes. The lower jaw protrudes past the upper jaw, with a pair of canine teeth on each side. The dorsal fins are separated with six rays on the first. The ventral fins are joined by a bridge of skin (a frenum). The caudal fins are round. They can grow to a maximum length of . They superficially resemble members of the genus Acentrogobius, but Oplopomus can be distinguished by having the first rays of both dorsal fins ending in a sharp point (pungent). Taxonomy The genus Oplomopus was first used by the German zoologist Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg for Oplopomus pulcher (a synonym of Oplopomus oplopomus, first described by the French zoologist Achille Valenciennes in 1837). It was made available through subsequent usage by the Austrian zoologist Franz Steindachner in 1860. It has been classified under the subfamily Gobiinae of the goby family, Gobiidae, although the 5th edition of Fishes of the World does not recognise any subfamilies in Gobiidae.

Early life  She comes from an artistic family who supported her since her early age to do a musical career, so she entered into a conservatory at the age of 12. Her voice and her face allowed her to be noticed and she took part of a Moroccan singing competition \\"Noujoum El Ghad\\", produced by the local channel 2M, in which she arrived third. Wishing to diverse her talent, she flew to Switzerland in Geneva and studied at the \\"Institut sup√©rieur de musique\\", in which she learned the basics of Western music.  Career  In 2006, she took part of the Arabic version of The X-Factor, produced by Rotana, in which was also discovered fellow Moroccan Rajaa Kasabni (which eventually won). Hoda got eliminated quickly by Egyptian singer and judge Nelly Artin Kalfayan, but her voice got the attention of Rotana's CEO Salim El Hindi, which invited her to join the label. She released her first album, \\"Ertaht\\" in 2008, which features songs in various dialects, from her native Moroccan dialect to Lebanese, Egyptian and Gulf. Three singles were released from the album and turned into video clip, two Egyptian songs \\"Ma Saddaq\\" and \\"Ma Kountesh\\", and the Moroccan song \\"Ma Tfakarnish\\" which she wrote and composed herself. It is very rare indeed that Moroccan artists release singles in the Moroccan dialect due to the fact that it is very hard to get for middle-easterns. But the single was a good success, due to the efficient promotion from Rotana, and Hoda was showcased in many scenes and television shows across the Middle-East. She sang a duet with Iraqi singer Majid El Muhandes titled \\"Ala Bali\\" and released another successful single in Moroccan dialect, \\"Bghito Walla Krehto\\" which she also wrote and composed. The clip was shot in Turkey by a French video director. The single was later included in her second album titled \\"Tayr El Hob\\", released in 2011 and produced by Rotana. This album is a premiere in the Middle-East as being the first album entirely performed in the Moroccan dialect. Hoda wrote and composed all the songs and recorded the songs in studios in United Kingdom, Lebanon and Egypt. A second single from the album was released into a video clip, the main single \\"Tayr El Hob\\" in January 2012. Hoda Saad wrote songs for other Moroccan singers such as Asmaa Lamnawar, Tahra Hamamish or Leila Gouchi and even wrote and composed a song for the great Syrian singer Assala Nasri's upcoming album.

Written by Brian Lynch, the series starred comedian Ed Byrne. Plot The show evolved around three members of the twenty-something Cassidy family living in a house outside Dublin. Emma is a moderately successful business woman striving to be sophisticated and suave, but she is failing miserably. Barry is a neurotic out of work actor who thinks he is well-rounded and well-balanced. Lisa is deeply insecure but disguises this with her sarcasm and condescension. We follow them through their trials and tribulations, their quest for love and their search for something far more meaningful than each other. Production The interior scenes for the series were shot in Studio 4 at the RT√â Television Centre while the exterior scenes were shot at various locations around Dublin. The series was filmed in front of a live studio audience. Reception The series received mostly negative reviews from the very start. Sin√©ad Egan, writing in the Sunday Tribune, was critical of the first episode, referring to the script as lame and not funny with stereotypical characters. Liam Fay of the Sunday Times described the show as \\"relatively awful\\" and compared it with Upwardly Mobile. Other critics dismissed it as a \\"second-hand dire comedy, which isn't funny\\" and derided its weak characterisation and lack of comedy.

The name was derived from the iconic Goa Police headquarters building, which has seven windows each to its either ends and the entrance. The building originally had a ground floor and three sets of seven windows each on the first floor.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtZ4_irUPp0 In 1843, a statue of the legendary Portuguese general Afonso de Albuquerque was laid inside the domed structure at the Maidan. It is said that the iron beams and granite pillars for the monuments were brought from the Convent of S. Domingos, Velha Goa. The pillars and columns for the dome came from the College of St. Thomas Aquinas, located on a hillock of Concei√ß√£o.

It was heard in the Appellate Division by Joubert JA, Nestadt JA, Van den Heever JA, Olivier JA and Van Coller AJA on 19 September 1995, with judgment passed on 29 November. M. Tselentis SC (with him AC Thompson) was counsel for the appellant; MJD Wallis SC (with him LB Broster) appeared for the respondents.  Cession  Cession is a particular method of transferring rights in a movable incorporeal thing in the same manner in which delivery (traditio) transfers rights in a movable corporeal thing. It is in substance an act of transfer (Afrik oordragshandeling) by means of which the transfer of a right (translatio iuris) from the cedent to the cessionary is achieved. The transfer is accomplished by means of a transfer agreement (oordragsooreenkoms) between the cedent and the cessionary arising out of a iusta causa from which the former‚Äôs intention to transfer the right (animus transferendi) and the latter's intention to become the holder of the right (animus acquirendi) appears or can be inferred. It is an agreement to divest the cedent of the right and vest it in the cessionary.345F/G-H/I. Logically speaking, as the court noted in the present case, a non-existent right of action or a non- existent debt cannot be transferred as the subject-matter of a cession.346C. The parties may agree in the obligatory agreement to cede and transfer to the cessionary a future or contingent right of action (spes futurae actionis), or a future or conditional debt (debitum conditionale, debitum futurum) as and when it comes into existence and accrues or becomes due and payable, whereupon it will be transferred to the cessionary. If it never comes into existence it will amount to a non-existent right of action or a non-existent debt which cannot qualify as the subject-matter of a cession.346F-G.  Facts  On 31 December 1984, N (Pty) Ltd executed a deed of cession in securitatem debiti in favour of First National Bank (FNB). The deed was headed '\\"Cession of Book Debts\\" and provided that N Ltd did > hereby cede, assign, transfer and make over to and in favour of [the bank > ...] all our right, title and interest in and to all and any moneys and > amounts which may now [be] or which may hereafter become due and owing to us > by any person whomsoever as security for the fulfilment of all obligations > undertaken by us to the bank and as security for the payment of all money > now and from time to time hereafter owing by us to the bank for any cause of > debt whatsoever [...]. In order to give effect to the cession herein > contained, we hereby nominate, constitute and appoint the bank irrevocably > and in rem suam to be our attorneys and agents, with full power and > authority for use and in our name or in its own name to demand, sue for, > recover and receive all debts or sums of money whatsoever which now or > hereafter may become due, owing, payable or belonging to us. N Ltd, the contractor, thereafter entered into a construction contract with the Government of QwaQwa for the construction of a public road. By 29 August 1990, the contractor had completed all work in terms of the contract. A certificate of completion was issued on 27 August specifying a sum of money that was to be retained by the employer government against defective work and for maintenance for a period of one year. At the expiry of this period, 27 August 1991, subject to any defect being repaired, the contractor's claim for payment of the retention money would become enforceable. On 10 June 1991, a progress certificate was issued, certifying that the balance of the retention money amounted to a sum of R1,106,376.37, payable when a final certificate of completion was issued by the project's engineer within fourteen days of the expiration of the retention period. On 10 June, the contractor was placed in provisional liquidation and was finally wound up on 26 July. On 2 July, the engineer issued a final certificate of completion. A dispute arose between the bank and the respondents in the present case, the joint liquidators of the contractor, as to who was entitled to payment of the balance of the retention money. The joint liquidators applied to a Provincial Division for a declaratory order that, on a proper construction of the contract of cession, no security had been conferred on the bank in respect of retention money certified in terms of the contract for payment by the employer subsequent to 10 June 1991. On 15 December 1993, the application was granted with costs against the bank. Relying on the authority of Muller v Trust Bank of Africa,1981 (2) SA 117 (N). the court held that the right to the retention money had not vested in the contractor at the time of the issue of the completion certificate, and that, at most, the contractor could be said to have had a mere spes or expectation of a right not yet in existence which was not capable of cession prior to the contractor's liquidation. The bank appealed against the decision.  Judgment  The Appellate Division held,Per Van den Heever JA, with Van Coller AJA concurring. agreeing with Joubert JA's analysis of the deed of cession as evidencing an intention to deal with future rights which the contractor might acquire, and not merely with rights extant at the time of conclusion of the cession agreement, that the questions to be determined were # whether the cession contemplated a transfer only of the contractor's then exigible debts and of future debts as and when they became exigible, or whether the parties to the document contemplated also a transfer of the contractor's claims then extant but imperfect because, for example, they were subject to some time clause or condition, and of similar imperfect claims as and when they arose in the future; and, if the latter # whether the contractor's claim against the employer was merely a future claim or such an imperfect one; and, if so, # whether present effective transfer was possible of such a claim, or whether future and contingent rights were equally incapable of present \\"delivery.\\"350B-E. As to the first question, the court held that the inquiry had to be into what the parties to the cession had had in mind: what the contractor intended to deliver to the bank which was willing to finance, as far as necessary, the contractor's ongoing operation by means of overdraft facilities, and what the bank was content to accept as security for the recovery of the funds it was prepared to advance.350F-F/G. The court reasoned that it would make poor commercial sense for the bank to want no more than to ensure that the contractor channelled into the bank's possession money earned only as and when received as being exigible in reduction of the contractor's overdraft with the bank.350I-I/J. In judging what was the content of the rights intended to be transferred and accepted as security, it was relevant that the sequence provided for in the contract, as in most engineering or building contracts, was that the contractor would perform first: it was only after the contractor had spent energy as well as money for the benefit of the employer, that performance‚Äîpayment‚Äîby the employer enriched thereby became due in the sense of only then becoming exigible.351B-C. The personal rights intended to be transferred by the cession included rights to money owing, or which might become owing, to the contractor. The cession did not limit the rights to be transferred to the contractor's right to money then payable; or only as and when money became payable in future.351G-G/H The parties to the cession intended to extend the ambit of the rights of the contractor to be transferred to the bank as security as widely as lawfully possible.351H-I. As for the third question, the court found nothing in logic or law to militate against acceptance of the notion that an extant right may be transferred to another forthwith despite its being subject to a condition. It is accepted law that a contingent right is capable of immediate transfer. The fact that the right may in time turn out to be worth little, or less than the parties anticipated, does not detract from this proposition; the requirement that the object of a cession be certain did not mean that the money value of the ceded right had to be precisely calculable when the transfer of that right occurred.352E-E/F, 352F/G-G, 352H/I-I. The dictum in Tuckers Land and Development v Strydom1984 (1) SA 1 (A).24E-25B. was applied by the court, and Muller v Trust Bank of Africa1981 (2) SA 117 (N).called into question. As to the second question, since by 29 August 1990, the contractor had completed all work relating to the construction stage and had moved off the site, and since the work had been accepted by the employer, the contractor was owed what it had earned, subject only to the condition that it could forfeit a portion of that money if it did not maintain the work done for the period agreed upon, or if it did not remedy such minor defects as might become manifest during the period in question.353D/E-E/F. The court held, accordingly, that the contractor had acquired before liquidation a personal right to performance by the employer of its part of their bargain: that performance (payment by the employer) was delayed for the maintenance period, and was subject to the condition that the amount held in the retention fund could be reduced. That right was transferred by cession to the bank before liquidation.352F-G. (Joubert JA and Nestadt JA dissented from this finding.) The court held accordingly that the appeal should be upheld.352G. The court held furtherPer Olivier JA, concurring in the order proposed by Van den Heever JA. that the certificate of completion signified the coming into existence of a right to claim payment of the retention money subject to a suspensive condition, namely the repair of any defects which might manifest themselves during the retention period.357A/B-B. It has been accepted in commerce and by the courts of South Africa for more than a century that future rights could be ceded and transferred in anticipando.360A-A/B. Accordingly, the cession of 31 December 1984, was a valid one. If it incorporated a transfer in anticipando of the right in question (which only came into being at a later stage), it would have been legally effective.360F-F/G. The words of the deed, in particular the words \\"transfer and make over,\\" and the reference to moneys and amounts becoming due and owing in future, indicated a present mutual intention of now transferring rights as they came into existence in the future. Accordingly, by virtue of the cession of 31 December 1984, the contractor's right to claim payment of the retention money when it came into being on 27 August 1990 (even though that right was subject to a suspensive condition), had been transferred to the bank.360H/I-361A/B. (Joubert JA and Nestadt JA dissented again.) The decision in the Natal Provincial Division, in Lynn v FNB, was thus reversed.

His wife was Mileva Roller and they were members of the Viennese Secession movement.  Life and work  Roller was born in Br√ºnn (Brno), Moravia. He at first studied painting at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna under Christian Griepenkerl and Eduard Peithner von Lichtenfels, but eventually became disenchanted with the Academy's traditionalism. In 1897 he co-founded the Viennese Secession with Koloman Moser, Joseph Maria Olbrich, Josef Hoffmann, Gustav Klimt, and other artists who rejected the prevalent academic style of art. He became a professor of drawing at the University of Applied Arts Vienna (Kunstgewerbeschule) in 1899, and president of the Secession in 1902. In his early career Roller was very active as a graphic designer and draughtsman. He designed numerous covers and vignettes for the pages the Secessionist periodical Ver Sacrum, as well as the posters for the fourth, fourteenth, and sixteenth Secession exhibitions. He also designed the layout of the exhibitions themselves. In 1902 Roller was introduced to the composer Gustav Mahler by Carl Moll. Roller expressed an interest in stage design and showed Mahler several sketches he had made for Wagner's Tristan und Isolde. Mahler was impressed and decided to employ Roller to design the sets for a new production of the piece. The production, which premiered in February 1903, was a great critical success. Roller continued to design sets for Mahler's productions. In 1906 he married the Viennese Secession painter Mileva Roller and they had two sons Dietrich (1909-2001) became a doctor, Ulrich (1911-1941) became a stage designer and died in Stolpovo near Kaluga (in the Soviet Union ) during the Russian campaign shortly after Christmas 1941.Nachlassverzeichnis Ulrich Roller Eventually Roller left the Secession and his teaching post at the Kunstgewerbeschule to be appointed chief stage designer to the Vienna State Opera, a position he held until 1909.

History  After a fire destroyed a large part of Bingen in 1490, the city authorities tried to raise money to repair the city by levying a market fee. Fees were also collected from M√ºnster-Sarmsheim and other towns in the Palatinate. The citizens of M√ºnster- Sarmsheim logged a complaint, and when this was unsuccessful, they turned to Elector Philip the Righteous. He gave M√ºnster-Sarmsheim the privilege to have its own weekly market. In 1493, this market was protected by a customs barrier, consisting of a walled area with a pier and a round tower built on a hill. In 1504, during the War of the Palatinate Succession, Landgrave William II of Hesse attacked M√ºnster-Sarmsheim. He fired cannon at the city and set it on fire.

In the New York Evening Post, Hammett praised Green Ice: \\"Here are 280 pages of naked action pounded into tough compactness by staccato, hammerlike writing\\".The Black mask boys: masters in the hard-boiled school of detective fiction by William F. Nolan. William Morrow, 1985 (p. 131) Whitfield ceased writing fiction and moved to Hollywood in the late 1930s. Although he was fairly wealthy, by the 1940s he had lost most of his money. Later, Whitfield contracted tuberculosis and had to be hospitalized. Personal life Whitfield was married three times. His first marriage was to a fellow reporter. Shortly after marrying, they quit their jobs and went to Florida, where he began writing full time. They eventually divorced. In 1933, Whitfield married Emily O'Neill (n√©e Davies) Vanderbilt Thayer (1903‚Äì1935). Emily was the former wife of William Henry Vanderbilt III, son of Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt, and Sigourney Thayer, which both ended in divorce. She was the daughter of Frederick Martin Davies, granddaughter of Daniel O'Neill, owner of the Pittsburgh Dispatch newspaper, and the grandniece of Frederick Townsend Martin, a prominent writer of the 1920s. After beginning divorce proceedings, Emily committed suicide by self- inflicted bullet wound in 1935. Whitfield was his wife's sole heir. His third wife, Lois Bell, a barmaid he had been seeing before his second wife's death, also killed herself. She jumped from a hotel window and died on September 27, 1943https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NR3QBQAAQBAJ&pg;=PT16&dq;=%22RAOUL+WHITFIELD+%E2%80%9C%22lois+bell%22&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwip- rKWjcLqAhXjrnEKHfacDaMQ6AEwAXoECAEQAg#v=onepage&q;=%22RAOUL%20WHITFIELD%20%E2%80%9C%22lois%20bell%22&f;=false Whitfield died from tuberculosis in Los Angeles, California on January 24, 1945.

It was in use from 1910 until 1915, and again from 1923 until 1925. History The Bristol and North Somerset Railway (B&NSR;) opened a branch line from to on 1 March 1882, although it had been funded by the Great Western Railway (GWR) which worked the trains on the line from the outset and purchased the B&NSR; Company in 1884. The line was extended from Camerton to in 1910 where it made a connection with the GWR's Wilts, Somerset and Weymouth Line. When the line opened were no stations between Hallatrow and Camerton. In 1899 the Timsbury Colliery Company signed an agreement with the GWR for a siding at Radford. The GWR siding was opened for traffic on 19 July 1900 and the line connecting it to the colliery came into use in October that year. Radford and Timsbury Halt opened for passenger trains on 9 May 1910, the same day as the line was extended through to Limpley Stoke. The term 'halt' was used by the GWR to denote railway stations without staff or public goods facilities. Passenger services on the line were withdrawn on 22 March 1915 due to World War I. They were eventually restored on 9 July 1923, four and a half years after hostilities had ceased. They did not last long as they were withdrawn again on 21 September 1925, never to be resumed. Freight trains continued to operate until 8 February 1932 and the track was lifted shortly afterwards. Description The station was from Hallatrow and just from Camerton. The timber-built platform was situated on the south side of the line. It was long, wide, and provided with oil lamps and a corrugated iron shelter. Access was by a footpath from the road bridge that crossed the line at the east end of the station. No public goods facilities were provided, but a loop siding on the north side of the line immediately to the west of the passenger platform was connected at its east end to a cable-worked incline up to the colliery. Loaded wagons coming down provided the power to haul empties back up to the colliery. Services Passenger trains on the Hallatrow to Limpley Stoke line were operated by steam railmotors or, later, by auto trains. In 1914 there were five trains each day, Monday to Saturday only. In 1923 this had been reduced to four.

His commanding presence and ambitious personality caused him to emerge as an unofficial spokesperson during the four years he toured with them. He later became internationally famous as the leader of his own brand of Jubilee Singers, the Loudin Jubilee Singers, who toured internationally.Marsh, J. B. T. The Jubilee Singers and Their Songs; Loudin, F.J. \\"Supplement containing an account of their six years' tour around the world, and many new songs\\". Dover Publications, Inc., 2003 p. 153. Background & Education Loudin was born to free parents in Charlestown, Ohio, circa 1836. His parents moved to rural Ohio from Burlington, VT to be farmers, but when they learned that, although they had made regular financial contributions to Hiram College, their son would not be allowed to enter their preparatory program, they promptly removed their children from the local school and enrolled them in school in Ravenna, Ohio. Frederick excelled in his studies and was therefore eligible for a privileged seat in the class. Many White parents took umbrage with this occurrence and pulled their children out of school, rather than have a \\"Negro\\" sit in a seat of honor they felt their children deserved based on skin color, rather than merit.Marsh, J. B. T. The Jubilee Singers and Their Songs; Loudin, F.J. \\"Supplement containing an account of their six years' tour around the world, and many new songs\\". Dover Publications, Inc., 2003, pp. 112-115. Loudin continued to show promise as a strong student and in his late teens began apprenticing for a printer. When asked to take over the literary department of the abolitionist newspaper for which he worked, Loudin elected to remain a compositer since he did not fully share the views of the paper's editor. Discouraged when he discovered that other white printers were unwilling to do business with him, Loudin gave up printing altogether.Stikes, Norman C. Frederick J. Loudin . . . A Man for All Times; Self-published, date unknown, p. 1. Musical career The racism he experienced extended beyond school and work. In the Methodist church he had joined in Ravenna, Loudin was prohibited from singing in the choir. This was especially disappointing since Loudin, who had descended from a family of musicians, was gifted with a beautiful voice. This experience discouraged him from pursuing a formal education in music, despite his desire to sing. While in his early 20s, Loudin moved to Pittsburgh where he met and married Harriet Johnson. Four years later, the couple moved to Memphis. Music played a large part in Loudin's life: teaching, learning the organ and leading a choir. When a friend told him about the Jubilee Singers, he wrote to George White. White, who was looking for a baritone, came to Memphis to hear Loudin sing. He invited him to join his choir. Loudin, the oldest member of the Jubilee Singers, forged a strong relationship with George White over the next few years while touring Europe. A bitter rival of Ella Sheppard, he also fell out with Erastus Milo Cravath, Fisk‚Äôs president, over the Jubilees‚Äô rights to rest and remuneration. In 1879, after the Jubilee Singers disbanded, Loudin and White reorganized the choir together, calling it the Fisk Jubilee Singers for the sake of name recognition though the group was no longer associated with Fisk University. After White was injured while directing the troupe at Chautauqua, New York, the group continued on a two-year tour of the U.S. and Canada, under Loudin's direction. Performances In 1884 Loudin launched a six-year world tour. As sole director of the choir, Loudin became particularly careful about selecting his singers, investigating their backgrounds to ensure they had committed no misdeeds and that they came from cultured families. As a group now purely composed of and run by African Americans, it was important to Loudin that no character flaws could be pointed to as proof of their inferiority. Loudin led his choir to England, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, India, Singapore, China, Japan, and finally across the American West. The success of this tour‚ÄîLoudin and his singers earned enough to settle comfortably upon their return‚Äîwas partly due to its management by Loudin's wife, who had traveled with him since his Jubilee Singers days. After returning to his hometown of Ravenna, Ohio and building his family a house, Loudin continued to tour with his troupe for the next twelve years.Marsh, J. B. T. The Jubilee Singers and Their Songs; Loudin, F.J. \\"Supplement containing an account of their six years' tour around the world, and many new songs\\". Dover Publications, Inc., 2003, pp. 123-158. Business ventures In addition to meeting the demands required by his career as a singer and choir director, Loudin somehow found time for political and business pursuits. In the 1890s, after returning from his world tour, Loudin became the owner of two shoe manufacturing companies and patented two inventions. In 1879, and again in 1893, he served as a delegate to a national conference of black men. He joined anti-lynching journalist Ida B. Wells-Barnett and Frederick Douglass in advocating for the representation of African Americans at the World‚Äôs Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Loudin also maintained his relationship with Fisk throughout his life‚Äîsending the school regular updates on his choir's work abroad and visiting the school whenever he could‚Äîdespite the fact he was never a student at Fisk or any other college. Manufacturing On November 17, 1892 the F.J. Loudin Boot and Shoe Manufacturing Company was dedicated in Ravenna, Ohio. By April 1893 the company was employing an integrated staff of nearly 70 men. This in and of itself was a revolutionary act in Ravenna of the 1890s. Their workers were making 300 shoes/day, under the Loudin brand. The staff and the shareholders were integrated, as well, but in the end none of this was able to help the company stay afloat. Within one year of opening the company was bankrupt and had to close up shop. During this time Loudin‚Äôs Fisk Jubilee Singers were on tour under the direction of their choir director cum businessman. Frederick Loudin was at the height of his creative abilities, as exemplified by the two inventions for fasteners which he patented during this period of time.Abbott, Lynn & Serott, Doug, \\"Out of sight: The rise of African American popular music, 1889-1895, Univ.

For the whole intra-EU-transfer only one transfer licence is necessary. There are three types of export licences: the general transfer licence; the global transfer licence as well as the individual transfer licence. The individual transfer licences would remain the exception.see Commission 2007, 765, p. 7 http://eur- lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2007:0765:FIN:EN:PDF Global transfer licence According to Article 6 of the directive,e a global transfer licence shall be granted on request to individual suppliers. With such a licence the supplier can deliver products to one or more recipients in other member states during a period of three years. The licence is renewable. Individual transfer licence Article 7 of the directive describes the usage of an individual transfer licence. Such a licence shall be granted on request. With an individual transfer licence a supplier can deliver products only once to only one recipient in another member state. General transfer licence According to Article 5 of the directive, general transfer licences are granted ex officio. A request for them is not needed. All movements that meet the legal conditions of the licence are authorized automatically. Such licences give suppliers the chance and the opportunity to export different kinds of defence-related products to different recipients placed in different member states without a request. Under Article 5 of the directive, general transfer licences shall be published at least in the following cases, for transfer: * to certified recipients * to the armed forces of other member states * for demonstration, evaluation or exhibition purposes * for maintenance and repair purposes Certification of recipients Article 9 of the directive lays down the rules for the \\"certification of recipients\\" and provides some criteria, which have to be considered during the certification process. Furthermore there is the Commission Recommendation 2011/24/EU on the certification of defence undertakings under Article 9 of Directive 2009/43/EC. In each member state there is a competent authority, which has to carry out the certification of companies based on certain criteria. If a company is certified, suppliers from other member states can deliver defence-related products to this company by using a general transfer licence. The certification will be valid for five years. Obligations of suppliers Article 8 (3) of the directive foresees the obligation for the suppliers to keep certain records of their transfers. According to Article 8 (1,2) of the directive suppliers have to inform * recipients of the terms and conditions of the transfer licence. * the competent authority of their intention to use a general transfer licence for the first time.

It is the sole species classified under the genus Rhinogobiops. They are common inhabitants of coral reefs and rocky habitats along the Eastern Pacific Ocean coasts of Mexico, the United States, and Canada, although they are hardly noticed, as they often rest motionless near their shelters. Other common names for the species include bluespot goby and crested goby. Blackeye gobies range in color from creamy white to a mottled dark purple-brown, but can easily be recognized by the distinctive black spot on their first dorsal fins and an iridescent blue spot beneath their eyes. They are capable of rapidly changing their color in response to social situations or threats. They are also protogynous hermaphrodites, starting out in life as females. They are highly territorial and each male usually maintains a harem of two to eight females. Description Blackeye gobies can easily be identified by the fleshy crest on the upper surface of their heads, the distinctive black upper anterior edge of the first dorsal fin, their large scales, and large, dark eyes. They are small fish, reaching a maximum length of only 15 cm (6 in). A blackeye goby with the iridescent blue spot below the eye clearly visible The body is elongated, slightly compressed, and almost completely covered by scales. The head lacks scales and is wider than it is deep, with a small terminal mouth and a projecting lower jaw. The maxilla does not extend below the anterior margin of the eye. The teeth are conical and are present in double rows on both jaws. The eyes are directed slightly upwards and sideways. The dorsal fins are close together, with the first dorsal fin having five to seven rays and the second having 12 to 15. The pectoral fins have 21 to 24 rays, all of which are rigid. The anal fin has 11 to 14 rays with no spines. It is about the same size as the second dorsal fin. The caudal fin is rounded with about 17 rays, 12 of which are segmented and branched. The pelvic fins are completely fused with each other, forming a disk, each with four rays. These function as suckers. Coloration can vary, as blackeye gobies are capable of rapidly changing color during social interactions and for camouflage. The basic body color is creamy white to pale tan, but can become a mottled dark purple-brown. The body is irregularly speckled with metallic blue-green. Below the eye is an iridescent bluish spot clearly visible if illuminated (the source of their other common name ‚Äì bluespot goby). The first dorsal fin has a distinctive black upper anterior edge that is retained even when the fish changes color. During breeding season, the pelvic fins of the males (normally gray in both sexes) turn jet black. Taxonomy and nomenclature The blackeye goby (Rhinogobiops nicholsii) is monotypic in the genus Rhinogobiops. It is a true goby, which was classified ino the subfamily Gobiinae of the goby family Gobiidae, but the 5th edition of Fishes of the World does not include any subfamilies in the Gobiidae. The species was first described in 1882 by the American ichthyologist Tarleton Hoffman Bean from a specimen from Departure Bay, British Columbia, recovered in 1881 by the American survey vessel Hassler. He named it Gobius nicholsii, after Henry E. Nichols, the collector of the specimen and the captain of the ship. It was transferred to the genus Rhinogobius in 1907 by Edwin Chapin Starks and Earl Leonard Morris. In 1926, American ichthyologist Carl Leavitt Hubbs moved it to its own genus, Rhinogobiops. The name comes from Greek, meaning \\"resembling Gobius\\". In 1960, James E. B√∂hlke and C. Richard Robins synonymized Rhinogobiops with Coryphopterus, though they noted that it differed from other members of the latter in the number of fin rays and scales and should be treated as a subgenus. In 1995, John E. Randall expressed doubts as to the validity of this move. He was supported by ichthyologists Ray S. Birdsong and even Robins himself in believing that Rhinogobiops is in fact distinct from Coryphopterus. This was confirmed in 2002 in a phylogenetic study on Coryphopterus by Christine E. Thacker and Kathleen S. Cole. They concluded that blackeye gobies were more closely related to a clade containing Lophogobius cyprinoides than to the rest of the genus. They transferred it back to the genus Rhinogobiops and it is now valid as Rhinogobiops nicholsii. Distribution and habitat Blackeye gobies are found in the eastern North Pacific, along the coasts of Canada, the United States, and Mexico. It reaches as far north as St. John Baptist Bay (near Partofshikof Island) in Alaska to as far south as San Martin Island of Baja California, Mexico. Its range does not extend into the Gulf of California, however. Its northern range was previously believed to have reached only as far as Skidegate Channel in the Haida Gwaii Archipelago and the waters around Wales Island, both in British Columbia. However, a 2000 survey recovered blackeye gobies from Sitka and Klawock in southeastern Alaska. This makes the blackeye goby the only known species of goby to be found in Alaskan waters, though the arrow goby (Clevelandia ios) and the bay goby (Lepidogobius lepidus) have also been recovered from northern British Columbia. Subsequent observations on the recovered specimens in aquaria noted that blackeye gobies could only survive in temperatures exceeding , making them unlikely to be found further north than St. John Baptist Bay. Blackeye gobies are extremely abundant. They are exclusively marine and usually inhabit rocks and reefs from intertidal areas to depths of from the surface, though they have been found in depths as much as . They are most commonly found in the border area between reefs and sand bottoms. They usually seek out natural crevices and holes in the rock and reef surfaces but are capable of digging their own burrows in softer substrates if needed. They are difficult to see due to their habit of resting completely still until approached closely. When threatened they dart quickly back to their shelters. Ecology and biology Blackeye gobies are highly territorial. Each male usually guards a harem of two to eight females and a small territory around a shelter. They are diurnal and mostly prey on small crustaceans and mollusks. They are protogynous hermaphrodites, with all individuals being born females and turning into males once they reach a certain size under the correct conditions. They exhibit courtship display and breed between April and October. The larvae are pelagic. Social behavior A blackeye goby showing coloration typical of a subordinate individual Male blackeye gobies form harem with both females and juveniles. The males in such groups are usually larger than the female members, typically in length, while the females range in size from . Males are highly territorial and actively defend nest sites and females from intruders. Their territories can range from as small as to as large as . Larger males defend larger territories. During breeding season, the size of the territorial range can decrease even further as males concentrate on closely guarding the nests instead of foraging. Due to the relative closeness of the territories, males often encounter each other. When two males meet, they approach each other, slowly undulating their bodies, and assume combat-threat display with all fins stiffly outstretched. Once directly face-to-face, they gape their mouths and expand their throats. They take turns doing this until the \\"loser\\" assumes a mottled darker coloration and retreats to his shelter. From then on, the established dominant fish may harass the subordinate fish by chasing or nipping him if he strays too close. Reproduction and life history Blackeye gobies are sexually dimorphic, with different sexes distinguishable from genital papilla, size, and length of dorsal and anal fins. Females attain sexual maturity at in length, while males mature at in length. The breeding season lasts for five to seven months, between April and October. During this, the fused pelvic fins (the disk) of the males turn very dark in color. They exhibit interesting courtship behavior. Males first prepare a nesting site by fanning, rubbing, scooping, and nibbling a selected area. They then entice females into the nesting site by swimming up for or more with mouths open and fins outstretched then back down again. After doing this once or several times, they resume cleaning the nest site. At times, the males may also rush towards the females. Uninterested females often swim away to a shelter, in which case the males give chase, often nipping her fins. Interested females directly approach the males and slowly undulate their bodies while opening their mouths widely and spreading their fins. The females spawn a single layer of around 1700 eggs on the bottom surface of the nest, and may spawn several times. The males follow the females around as they lay the eggs, constantly nipping and bumping them. The males then fertilize the eggs during or immediately after they have been laid. The eggs are spindle-shaped and attached directly to rock surfaces. They are a pinkish to orange color when freshly laid but darken as they mature. The males defend the eggs until they hatch (after 10 to 33 days). The newly hatched planktonic larvae are in length and grow rapidly. They are pelagic, and can be found more than from the shore at depths of several thousands of feet. They differ from adults in having dark-orange vertical bands. They mature after their first winter. The longest known lifespan in an individual is five years. Protogynous hermaphroditism Blackeye gobies are protogynous hermaphrodites ‚Äì all of them are born females but can shift once to become males once they reach a length of . This is likely to be the result of the limited availability of good nesting sites. Larger males have a competitive advantage in defending these nesting sites, thus larger males and smaller females have much higher reproductive success rates than small males. A change in sex ratio and size distribution can cause of females to undergo the change to become males. Sex change in blackeye gobies has been correlated with the steroids 17Œ≤-estradiol and 11-ketotestosterone. A decrease in the former and an increase in the latter induces females to change to males. This has been artificially replicated in laboratory conditions with the application of 11-ketotestosterone, 11-ketoadrenosterone, and fadrozole (an aromatase inhibitor) on females. The change from female to male takes about four weeks in captive individuals, but the length of time it takes in the wild is unknown. Diet and predators Blackeye gobies are diurnal, being primarily active during daytime. They feed almost exclusively on small crustaceans and mollusks. The most common prey include amphipods, copepods, isopods, decapods (particularly hermit crabs), snails, and clams. Other less important prey include annelids and other invertebrates. Parts of echinoderms (mostly sea urchins) and bryozoans are also found in the contents of the stomachs of blackeye gobies, though this is likely the result of incidental ingestion rather than true predation. The preferred prey can vary by season depending on their abundance. Blackeye gobies have also been observed feeding directly on chemosynthetic bacterial mats. It is of particular significance if substantiated, as it would be the first known instance of a fish deriving nutrition directly from chemosynthetic bacteria. Blackeye gobies feed mostly by simply picking off the prey directly from the substrate. Occasionally, they may feed by taking a mouthful of substrate, spitting it out, then picking off edible prey as it drifts to the bottom. Blackeye gobies are heavily preyed upon, in turn, by bass (such as kelp bass and barred sand bass), rock cod, greenling, and other predatory fishes of their rock and reef habitats, as well as birds such as Brandt's cormorants and double-crested cormorants. Sea urchins of the genus Strongylocentrotus are also known to dislodge blackeye gobies from their territories, possibly as a result of egg predation by the former. Parasites of blackeye gobies include the trematodes Pronoprymna petrowi and Lecithaster gibbosus. Fossil record Abundant otolith fossils of blackeye gobies from the Pliocene epoch (5.3 to 3.6 million years ago) have been found in Lomita Marl. Pleistocene fossils of the species have also been recovered from other fossil localities in California. Aquaculture Blackeye gobies adapt well to aquaria and are often caught alive for such purposes. However, they can be troublesome if kept with other males and other species of fish, as they are extremely territorial and aggressive.

It is endemic to Western Australia. Together with Acacia truncata, it was the first Australian endemic to be scientifically described and named, and the specimen upon which that description is based is the oldest extant specimen of an Australian plant, and very likely among the first Australian plant specimens ever collected. Description Synaphea spinulosa grows as a small shrub with multiple steps up to in height. The leaves are deeply divided into three lobes, and each lobe is usually also divided into three. The ultimate lobes are usually triangular, and even these usually end in up to three sharp points. The leaf lamina does not lie flat but is concave. Overall the leaves are from long, and wide, on a petiole long. Flowers are bright yellow, and occur crowded together in spikes from long, on a branched peduncle arising from the upper axils of branches. Taxonomy Taxonomic history Tab. 87 from Nicolaas Laurens Burman's 1768 Flora Indica; engraving by Adolf van der Laan. The upper plant, labelled Polypodium spinulosum, is in fact S. spinulosa. Synaphea spinulosa bears the distinction of holding several 'firsts' in Australia botanical history. Together with Acacia truncata it was the first Australian endemic to be scientifically described and named, and the specimen upon which that description is based is the oldest extant specimen of an Australian plant, and very likely among the first Australian plant specimens ever collected. Nothing is known of the original collection of the specimen, except that it was necessarily collected before publication of the species description in 1768. Prior to this, the only known visit by Europeans to an area where S. spinulosa occurs was the voyage of Dutch mariner Willem de Vlamingh, who explored Rottnest Island and the Swan River in December 1696 and January 1697 respectively. It is therefore very likely, but not proven, that the specimen was collected during that voyage, and thus predates by nearly three years the oldest authenticated collection of Australian plants, that made by William Dampier in 1699. It is known that Dutch botanist Nicolaas Witsen asked Vlamingh to collect plants for him during the voyage, and it is recorded that Vlamingh returned to Holland with plants, fruits, and wood samples. However, according to Mabberley, at least one of the two specimens came from Christiaan Kleijnhoff who had established a botanic garden in Java (which is where Burman describes S. spinulosa as coming from - \\"ex Java\\"). Burman, N.L. (1768) Flora Indica: cui accedit series zoophytorum indicorum, nec non Prodromus Florae Capensis: 233, t. 67, fig. 1 In 1768, Dutch botanist Nicolaas Laurens Burman acquired the two specimens and published names, descriptions and illustrations of them in his Flora Indica. S. spinulosa was wrongly identified as a Javanese fern, and named Polypodium spinulosum; A. truncata was similarly misidentified and misnamed. The specimen of A. truncata is now lost, but the specimen of S. spinulosa is extant, and currently lodged in the Herbarium of the Conservatoire et Jardin botaniques de la Ville de Gen√®ve (CJB) in Geneva, Switzerland; it is among the oldest extant botanical specimens of an Australian endemic. (Some older specimens collected by William Dampier, e.g. Swainsona formosa, still exist at the Druce Herbarium in Oxford, but were not described.) The next known collection of S. spinulosa was made in December 1801, when King George Sound was visited by HMS Investigator under the command of Matthew Flinders. On board were botanist Robert Brown, botanical artist Ferdinand Bauer, and gardener Peter Good. All three men gathered material for Brown's specimen collection, including specimens of S. spinulosa. Neither Brown's nor Good's diary can be used to assign a precise location or date for the first collection of this species, but one of Brown's specimen slips is dated \\"Decr 19 1801\\". Brown, however, did not recognise the species as distinct; in his specimen collection, specimens of S. spinulosa are attributed to S. polymorpha, and when he eventually published the genus in his 1810 monograph On the Proteaceae of Jussieu, he assigned Burman's Polypodium spinulosum to S. petiolaris. In 1919, American botanist Elmer Drew Merrill identified Burman's Polypodium spinulosum with S. polymorpha. Claiming priority for Burman's name, he transferred P. spinulosum into Synaphea as S. spinulosa, relegating S. polymorpha to synonymy. This synonymy was accepted for many years, though the more established name S. polymorpha was preferred. The species was finally recognised as distinct in 1995 when Alex George divided S. polymorpha into several species in his treatment of the genus for the Flora of Australia series of monographs. Relationships within Synaphea The only published infrageneric arrangement of Synaphea is that provided by Alex George for the Flora of Australia series. In George's arrangement, Synaphea is divided into four sections. S. spinulosa is placed at the front of S. sect. Synaphea, by far the largest section with 44 members, because of its \\"entire to emarginate or shortly horned stigma\\": :Synaphea ::S. sect.

It is an important indicator of the performance of the European Union (EU) economy, because it focuses on the size and the evolution of imports and exports.  Introduction  International Trade Trade statistics follow the value and the quantity of goods exchanged between the Member States of the EU (intra-EU trade) and between the Member States and third countries (extra-EU exchanges) They constitute the official source of information on the imports, exports and the trade balance of the EU, its Member States and the euro zone. Data Statistics relating to the international trade represent an important source of data for many decision makers of the public and private sectors on national or international levels. Examples : # Inform multilateral and bilateral negotiations within the framework of the common trade policy # Define and implement anti-dumping policy # Evaluate the progress of the Single Market or the integration of EU economies # Carry out market research by businesses and define their commercial strategy # Compile balance of payments statistics and national accounts Data collection Traditionally, customs records are the main source of statistical data on international trade. Following the adoption of the Single Market on 1993, customs formalities between Member States were removed, and so a new data collection system, Intrastat, was set up for intra- EU trade. In the Intrastat system, intra-EU trade data are collected directly from trade operators, which send a monthly declaration to the relevant national statistical administration. Information on extra-EU and intra-EU trade is collected monthly by Member States. External trade data are subject to frequent revisions, as a consequence of errors, omissions or ‚Äì particularly with the Intrastat system ‚Äì late declarations by information providers. When data for the latest period are released, revised data for previous periods are also made available.  Data Eurostat publishes external trade statistics of Member States, Candidate Countries and EFTA countries. For each dataset the following basic information is available: * reporter (country or geo-economic area like EU-27, EU-25 ... or euro area), * reference period (annual or monthly), * trade flows (import, export) and balance, * product, * partner country (EU Member States or third countries) or geo-economic area. Aggregated data contain macro-economic indicators on both a monthly and annual basis (short-term and long-term indicators respectively). Trade flows are aggregated according to the product (main groups of SITC or BEC classification) and according to the partner (geo-economic areas). Short term indicators include: * gross and seasonally adjusted trade value (in million Euro), * unit-value indices, * gross and seasonally adjusted volume indices, * growth rates of trade values and indices. Long term indicators include: * trade value (in billion Euro), * shares by reporting country or by main trading partners, * unit-value indices, * volume indices. Detailed data record the monthly and annual trade (imports and exports) for the European Union and the euro area as well as for each EU Member State and EFTA countries. Data are disseminated by single declaring country and by single partner, at the most detailed level of several product nomenclatures (CN, HS, SITC, BEC, CPA, and NST/R). Additional datasets provide supplementary information on EU trade by means of transport and on the tariff regime for Extra EU imports. For detailed data the following indicators are disseminated: *trade value (gross value in Euro), *trade quantity in 100 kg, *trade quantity in supplementary units (litres, square metres, quantity of objects...)  Statistical Yearbook  The yearbook on external and intra-European Union trade provides data on long-term trends in the trade of the European Union and its Member States. In particular, it contains annual statistics on the trade flows of the EU with its main trading partners on the one hand and between the Member States on the other. These statistics are broken down by major product groups. The publication also includes extra chapters on the trade of candidate countries and EFTA members.  Classifications  Combined Nomenclature (CN) This classification has been used by the Community for all tariff and statistical purposes since 1988. The CN follows the structure of the harmonized system (HS), using the codes from the HS plus their subdivisions, making a total of more than 10 000 eight-digit headings. Prior to 1988, data were expressed using the NIMEXE classification of goods for external trade statistics. This covered some 10 000 products in 21 sections. Standard International Trade Classification (SITC) The United Nations Statistical Commission at its thirty-seventh session (March 2006) accepted a 4th Revision of it. It comprises 2 970 basing headings which are amalgamated into 262 groups, 67 divisions and 10 sections. Standard goods classification transport statistics (NST/R) in force since 1989, this classification comprises 99 chapters headings and 10 sections. You have the choice between goods containerised or not and the nationality of the transporters. Data sources are collected by the statistical services of the States members (NSI's) and the statistical offices of the United Nations.

Pilat (born July 29, 1975), known as Mike Pilot and \\"Tha Mike\\", is an American broadcaster. He is the creator and co-host of the iTunes- distributed Full Of Sith Star Wars Podcast, along with Bryan Young and Bobby Roberts. Pilot started his podcasting career in 2006 with the groundbreaking and extremely popular The Awful Show podcast (2006‚Äì2009). 3 years and almost 4 million downloaded shows later he then retired from The Awful Show and was later drafted in June 2009 as the co-host for The Mediocre Show with the founder of the Mediocre Show, Eric Tomorrow. That same month and year (June 2009), Pilot created the Obviously Oblivious podcast. Early life Mike Pilot was born into an Italian American family in Reading, Pennsylvania. The only son and second oldest child of five children born to Jan and BonnieSue‚Äôs (Leonardo), Pilot joked many times that his four sisters, Brandy, Bonnie, Samantha and Kyrie, taught him how to treat a lady by their teaming up and physically beating on him. His father, Jan, worked as a steelworker and power coating operator, and his mother BonnieSue stayed home and raised the children until going back to get her degree in Child Services. Pilot graduated from Reading High School. Career After moving out of his parents‚Äô home in his early twenties, Pilot worked as a steelworker to support himself and by coincidence broke his way into broadcasting by chance thru a friend of a friend who was the 7 to Midnight DJ at then York, Pennsylvania 105.7 WQXA-FM Top 40 station. Pilot was told to come in and make an air check tape which he did that was then passed along to the stations Program Director. Shortly after making the tape Pilot met with the Program Director and was offered a job on the sister AM station to gain experience by working as a board op during Philadelphia Phillies games. Pilot has said that it was a very weak AM station and he grew bored of the job quickly and decided to do the play by play for the games with his unique sense of humor. A week later the FM station was bought out by Citadel Broadcasting and was changed to Alternative Rock 105.7 the Edge (which eventually became the X) and the majority of the DJ‚Äôs quit on the spot. Being in the right place at the right time, Pilot was pushed onto the air for the 7 to Midnight shift where he stayed for about a year while earning respectable Arbitron ratings until the station started carrying The Howard Stern show and the Program Director decided to hire professional DJ‚Äôs to surround the Stern show. Pilat was switched to overnight on the weekends for 2 years until frustration grew and a life-threatening automobile accident destroyed his back and the 60 mile drive became impossibility for him. While being injured Pilot learned the basics of Web Development and Design from friends and eventually thru trial and error how to be a professional Webmaster. Pilot worked freelance for over a year until he accepted his first job as a Web Developer in 1999. Since then Pilot has changed companies a few times in order to help himself expand his skills and further his career. In March 2014 Pilot left The Mediocre Show but continues to do Full of Sith and Obviously Oblivious on a weekly basis. On October 10, 2014 Pilot received an Honorary Induction to the Empire City Garrison of the 501 Legion. Personal life On September 22, 2001, Pilot married his first wife. He filed for divorce in September 2003 which was finalized in mid 2004. In January 2005 Pilot proposed to his high school sweetheart Ariana Arndt on her birthday. They were married in a small, romantic ceremony on September 9, 2005 and their daughter Anyah was born on October 4, 2005. They live in Cumru Township, Berks County, Pennsylvania.

The Race used various colours for route markers; yellow and red, yellow and white, and yellow and green, whereas in the original version, a single colour scheme is used. The non-elimination penalty was called a Handicap (Handikap). It affects teams by making a certain task in the next leg harder for the team or by giving a penalty. For example, in the second leg, Martha & Elise had to make 75 dung cakes instead of 50 and make a higher stack of dried dung cakes than the other teams in order to receive their next clue. In Leg 10, the team was required to do both Detours. This season was the first international spin-off (and second edition to date) in which the location of the Starting Line was also the location of the Finish Line: Holmenkollbakken. The other edition to do so was the ninth season of the original version. Cast Applications were accepted from 11 October 2011 and ended on 31 October 2011.

He was the ninth Fulani emir, as well as the first emir from the current ruling Sullubawa dynasty, succeeding Yero dan Musa, the last emir from the Dallazawa dynasty which was installed by the Jihad of Usman dan Fodio. He came to power shortly after British rule began in 1903 following the signing of a treaty between the then Emir, Abubakar dan Ibrahim, and British officials. He was succeeded by his son Usman Nagogo who held the title of Emir from 1944 until his death in 1981. He and his entourage were photographed on multiple occasions. The Emir of Katsena with officials in 1911 at Katsina Early life and education Dikko was born in 1865, during the reign of emir Muhammadu Bello, to Muhammadu Gidado, who held the powerful title of Durbi, one of the king-makers, and his wife Ta-Malamai. Dikko received Islamic education from the scholars of Katsina at Tsagero from an early age. In 1882, when Dikko was still young, the Emir Ibrahim died, and Musa, an old enemy of Gidado, became emir. He confiscated the family's properties, stripped Gidado of the Durbi title and gave it to his own son Yero. This brought hardship to Dikko, but Musa's death and the ascension of his younger rival and Ibrahim's son Abubakar brought reprieve. Yero was stripped of the title and Dikko's older brother Muhammadu Sada was appointed. Abubakar also imprisoned Yero accusing him of the murder of Gidado. Durbi Being well educated and from a noble family, Dikko was given the title \\"Karshi\\" (currently held by one of his great- grandchildren) by Abubakar. Dikko was a warrior, and fought bravely in many of Katsina's wars with Maradi, further earning the trust and admiration of Abubakar, who appointed him Durbi (Sada having died before), his father's old title, making him the district head of Mani. It is said that this happened after a battle, and Abubakar was so astonished by Dikko's bravery, that he removed his own turban and used it to bestow the Durbi title on Dikko. Being Durbi brought Dikko even more closer to the emir, earning him more power and prestige, but bringing along a lot more responsibility, enemies, and new friends. Among Dikko's friends and confidants was Mallam Haruna, a scholar and prince from Kanon-Bakashe (now in Niger), who had settled at Tsagero, a town close to Katsina, where the Emir's children and other nobles were taken to study then, and where Dikko himself was educated. Dikko was given the responsibility of leading many more battles, he was also given the task of monitoring the civil war in Kano, where two claimants, Tukur and Alu, were fighting over the emirship. Dikko is said to have had the dream of one day becoming emir himself, and his quick rise to power and his increasing popularity were said to have worried the emir. Before the death of Sada, he had instructed Dikko to obey and be loyal to Abubakar. The arrival of the British and rise to the throne In April 1903, the British army, led by Lord Frederick Lugard arrived at the gates of Katsina. Having already conquered most of Hausaland, including nearby Kano and the Sokoto, the capital of the caliphate established by Danfodio, the British were welcome by the emir, and Katsina surrendered without a fight. The arrival of the British created a dilemma for emir Abubakar, who feared that the British may depose and exile him if he offended them, as they did to other emirs of conquered territories, but was not too eager to please them either. Abubakar was also worried about further disappointing the Katsina people, who were already angry over his surrender to people they saw as infidels, who had come to destroy legacy of Dan Fodio's jihad. This led to the emir appointing Dikko as his liaison with the British, also being responsible for their welfare and the provision of supplies. Abubakar enjoyed some degree of autonomy, but was often in disagreement with the British and their policies. The appointment of Dikko has been interpreted by some as an attempt by the emir to insulate himself from having to interact directly with the British, it has also been accused by some to be a plot by the emir, because Dikko might offend the British, and he might be taken away, ridding the emir of a powerful potential rival. However, Dikko tried hard to please the British and earn their trust. The British were not comfortable with Abubakar as emir, because of the disagreements he had with them, as well as the influence that the palace chiefs and the nobles had on him, making their policy of indirect rule ineffective. In late 1904, a dead dog was found in the British resident R.E Olivier's well. Abubakar was blamed, and he was removed and exiled to Ilorin in January 1905. Needing a loyal emir, Yero, former emir Musa's son, a rival of Abubakar, the British assumed, would be loyal to them and would most certainly not be influenced by Abubakar's loyal courtiers. Olivier, was said to have warned Yero that henceforth all dismissals and appointments had to be approved by the British, but Yero resented the British and was poised to have his way. He dismissed many officials, including Abubakar's sons, replacing them with his supporters and loyalists. He also used his own court to overrule judgements given by the British and the local judges. In February 1905, Olivier was transferred and Herbert Richmond Palmer was brought to Katsina as resident. Not long after he arrived, Palmer indicated his desire to undertake reforms in the judiciary and reorganize the districts, Yero disagreed and never cooperated. Meanwhile, there was an uprising in Sokoto, and Palmer was instructed to immediately for Kano. Before leaving, he instructed Yero to look after what he was leaving behind. Yero, thinking that the British had left permanently, ordered his men to loot the properties. When the British eventually returned, Palmer asked Yero to provide labour and materials to rebuild the looted properties, but neither Yero nor his loyal officials were willing to comply. Meanwhile, the British needed a supply of camels and firearms, and the trusted Dikko was sent by Palmer to Agadez to make the purchase. While Dikko was away, on November 9, 1906, Palmer got tired of Yero's antics and deposed him, accusing him of incompetence and insubordination. Yero was exiled to Lokoja, and Palmer announced Dikko's appointment as the interim emir, even though he was not from the ruling Dallazawa clan. The expected heirs to the throne, including the Yarima (crown prince), were overlooked in Dikko's favour. Dikko returned, oblivious to his new status as the emir, and was at Katsina's famous Kofar Sauri gate, when a man accosted him and ran towards him, and on meeting him, bowed down and greeted him in the style that only the emir was greeted, the man also praised Dikko as the \\"Sarki\\" of Katsina. Dikko was baffled by the man's behaviour, and asked him if he had gone mad, but the man broke the news to him of Yero's deposition, and his subsequent appointment as emir. Dikko, who had caught a Guinea worm infection, was unable to ride a horse, and had made his return journey from Agadez on a camel, he first stopped at his house at Kofar Sauri, before being escorted to the palace by cheering supporters. Dikko cooperated well with the British throughout the time he was acting emir, and on 25 January 1907, the visiting acting British High Commissioner William Wallace confirmed Dikko as the new emir of Katsina. Reign (1906‚Äì1944) Dikko faced stiff resistance from the deposed Dallazawa and their loyalists, who saw him as an usurper and a stooge imposed by the British. Dikko consolidated his position by appointing many of his loyalists to key posts, including his Friend Mallam Haruna, who was appointed as the first ever Waziri (second-in-command) of Katsina. Dikko also strengthened his relationship with many of the district heads and nobles by marrying out his daughters to them. During Dikko's reign, various reforms were initiated, they include the introduction of various taxation systems, and the departmentalization of the native authourity, with his son Usman Nagogo becoming the head of the Police department 1929. Nagogo was later made Magajin gari, the district head of Katsina metropolis in 1937, making him the closest of the princes to his father. Another major reform was the relocation of the district heads, who had previously lived inside Katsina, to their various districts. This relocation also somehow affected Dikko himself, as his closest confidant and second-in- command, Mallam Haruna, was reappointed by the British as a district head and relocated to Kaita, and the Waziri title was given to Mallam Zayyana. Dikko also built a hospital and established the famous Katsina College, the first secondary school in Northern Nigeria, in 1922. Dikko promoted western education, giving some of his own children to study under the British, and encouraging other nobles to do so too. In 1935, Dikko demolished and reconstructed the mosque built by the Dallazawa clan's patriarch, Ummarun Dallaje. The mosque became known as Masallacin Dutsi. He also became the first reigning emir to go to Mecca for Hajj, doing so by car in 1921, from where he also became the first emir to go to England, where he and his entourage met King George V, and visited the famous London Zoo. Dikko returned England in 1924 and 1937. After the British conquest, Katsina was no longer at war with anybody. Dikko, a skilled horseman himself, encouraged the use of Katsina's hitherto war horses for sports like racing and Polo. He dedicated and constructed a large Polo ground, which is still in use today. Dikko encouraged his own sons and other nobles to play the sport. Dikko's son and successor, Usman Nagogo, attained a handicap of +7, the highest ever attained by an African. Dikko's successors still hold the life presidency of the Nigerian Polo association. Death and succession Dikko died in early 1944 after suffering from an illness, leading to a succession struggle. On one hand were the Dallazawa princes led by the powerful Yarima, a descendant of emir Abubakar, who felt that the emirship was theirs by right, and on the other hand were Dikko's powerful sons who also tussled between themselves for the throne. In March 1944, the king-makers settled for Dikko's younger son Usman Nagogo, who was the clear choice of the British because of his sound western education, as well as his closeness to his father. Nagogo was turbaned on 19 May 1944. Dikko is buried in a garden inside the Katsina emir's palace. The all-seater Muhammadu Dikko Stadium and a street in Katsina town are named after him.

The Fokker F-27 broke up and sank; the Philippine Coast Guard and local fishermen rushed to the scene but 19 passengers and crew had died. The pilot and co-pilot of Flight 585 plus Roman Catholic Bishop Jose Paala Salazar were among the survivors. Investigation The owner of Laoag International Airlines, Paul Ng, stated sabotage caused the crash, but retracted his statement very soon afterwards. A month after the crash, Ng plus the Airlines chief mechanic, were arrested by Philippine immigration authorities and charged with working without having a proper permit.Airline condemns arrest of chairman On January 10, 2003, it was announced that pilot error was the cause of the crash. The plane's two surviving pilots, Captain Bernie Crisostomo and First Officer Joseph Gardiner, failed to notice that the fuel valves were closed. Transportation and Communications Secretary, Leandro Mendoza, placed the blame for the pilot's fatal lapse on the principal officers of Laoag International Airlines. Five months after the investigation was complete, a special committee of the Senate began proceedings to revoke Laoag International Airlines' congressional franchise.

(derived from the word Quick Understanding of Block Extrusion) is a physics-based puzzle video game developed and published by Toxic Games, with help from Indie Fund, a group of independent game developers. The game, an expansion of a student project by the founding members of Toxic Games, was released for Microsoft Windows through a number of digital distribution platforms, first through Desura on 17 December 2011 and then through Steam on 6 January 2012. An OS X port was later released on 17 December 2012 through Steam and on 18 December 2012 through Desura. In the game, the player guides their avatar through a series of levels to make their way to an exit. The player character is equipped with special gloves that can perform a number of functions on specific blocks to reach the exit. The game employs a sterile monochromatic environment that highlights the coloured blocks that the player can interact with, and has been compared to the Portal series. A sequel Q.U.B.E. 2 was announced in August 2017, and was released on Windows, macOS, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on 13 March 2018. Gameplay The player's character, after waking up from some incident, finds himself with a pair of gloves that can interact with specific blocks that are in the walls, floors, and ceilings of the various rooms as he progresses. The function of the blocks are distinguished by colour: red blocks can be extended or retracted; yellow blocks, always in groups of three, can be used to make stair-like structures; blue blocks can be retracted to act like a springboard to whatever touches them; purple blocks provide means to rotate sections of walls of a room; and green blocks provide a sphere or cube, which the player will need to manipulate. In the early stages, the player's goal is to use a combination of these blocks to get themselves to an exit point, allowing them to move to the next chamber. As the player progresses deeper into the unknown complex, new puzzle aspects are introduced. In one stage, the bulk of the chambers are dark except for specific coloured blocks, requiring the player to remember the location of other blocks as they manipulate them. Another section features light-oriented puzzles, with the player using cubes and other features to orient the light beam in the correct fashion. Story Waking inside a sterile, cube patterned environment, the player finds themselves wearing a special suit with unique gloves, and is contacted over radio by a woman named Commander Nowak. Nowak says that she is an astronaut aboard the International Space Station, and warns that the protagonist may have amnesia as a side effect of the space travel that they have undergone; they are currently aboard a cube-shaped alien vessel on a collision course with Earth. The player is informed they must use their suit to decipher their way through the barren ship in a few hours, which will cause the ship to self-dismantle and collapse before it can destroy the planet. With the player unable to send messages back and the Space Station orbiting behind earth, Nowak encourages the player to push onwards, before routinely losing contact. Proceeding through the puzzles, between Nowak's contact the player is soon reached by a desperate man warning that the story about Earth and space are all lies, and that the player is actually underground and a lab rat acting in tests. Warning the player that they are being drawn on with false promises, Nowak soon intercepts one of the signals and warns that it is an unauthorized broadcast that the player should ignore; Nowak soon claims the man is a lost astronaut codenamed 919, who was thought to be dead when his shuttle lost contact, whilst 919 insists that Nowak is lying to push the player into completing tests for data. With the environments collapsing in the final sectors, the player soon reaches a shuttle as the area self-destructs; Nowak demands the player enter as it is an escape pod, whilst 919 is adamant it will plunge the player into a furnace as they are no longer necessary. Climbing inside, the pod launches and the player finds themselves in space, revealing Nowak was telling the truth; having narrowly destroyed the ship between the Earth and its moon, huge rectangular fragments of the ship can be seen drifting off. The game closes as the US President thanks the player for their efforts, and vows to locate 919. Development Q.U.B.E. represents the final student project of Daniel Da Rocha, Jonathan Savery and Dave Hall, at Newport University. Upon graduation, the three had received strong feedback for their game, and founded their own company, Toxic Games, to continue its development. During this initial period of development, the team had considered the difficulty of obtaining publishing deals given their inexperience in the field, but instead happened upon funding provided by the Indie Fund, based on the potential of their game, allowing them to work at a more relaxed pace while retaining the intellectual property for themselves. Q.U.B.E. represents the first game funded through the Indie Fund to be released. Aaron Isaksen of the Indie Fund noted that they were drawn to the project while it was still a student project, believing the first-person puzzle game offered new concepts and ideas while providing a clean and simple interface without any time pressure or pin-point accuracy for the player. The Indie Fund provided three separate rounds of funding during the course of Q.U.B.Es development starting in August 2010. This funding, a total of $90,000, was recouped within four days of the game being available on the Steam platform, with over 12,000 copies sold. None of the Toxic Games team members are programmers: Hall noted that at no time during the development did they have to work directly with programming source code, and Q.U.B.E. demonstrates that it is possible to develop a full game without having to be a programmer. Though Da Rocha, Savery, and Hall remain the core members of the Toxic Games team, they had expanded their team for the release of Q.U.B.E. including the outsourcing of work; for example, they employed James Tan of Teotl Studios, who had worked on The Ball, to help with the menu interface and the details of the player's gloves. The original student project was completed by the three team members in about six weeks working part-time, while the complete version of the game took over eight months of full-time work by its team. At the time of initial development, they were considering using Unreal Engine 3 for their game engine, but at about the same time, Epic Games announced the freely available Unreal Development Kit, which not only reduced the costs for development but simplified some of the development tasks, such as using the Kismet visual scripting language to provide the game's logic and gameplay. The team wanted to keep the project relatively simple in both presentation and story to allow the focus to be on the puzzle aspects. The game's world is mostly constructed of cubes and blocks, allowing them to quickly model the world, but giving them enough flexibility to play with those elements in later levels to give the feeling of different environments. Toxic Games wanted to have the player feel immersed in the puzzles, and spent more time emphasising that player's interaction. The game was planned to introduce each puzzle element in isolation to allow the player to learn how to use it without providing any specific instructions, building up to more complex puzzles in later sections of the game. The team originally had a story envisioned for the game, in which the player would hear infrequent narration by a feminine artificial intelligence in the game, voiced by Emily Love, a friend of the team members. The team felt this was necessary because they had been \\"spoiled\\" by the use of GLaDOS from the Portal series. Toxic Games decided to drop the incomplete narration and story to assure they could get the game out before the Christmas holiday, having anticipated it would have taken three more months to complete the work. They also expressed concern that players outside England would not understand the accents, something they noticed when they had presented the game at E3 2011. Some elements of this narration remain in the released product, such as a room where the walls attempt to crush the player to create a sense of claustrophobia. Toxic Games has stated that they are considering additional downloadable content for the game after completing ports to other platforms, including content that re-adds this story as well as a level editor. Q.U.B.E. was initially developed for Microsoft Windows. In January 2012, Toxic Games announced that an OS X version as well as an OnLive compatible version are expected to be released in the first quarter of 2012, while they are currently prototyping a version for the iOS mobile platform. Toxic Games demonstrated a version working on the Wii U in April 2013, with a planned release later in the year, and have considered a port to the PlayStation Vita. Director's cut A \\"Director's Cut\\" of Q.U.B.E. was announced in May 2014, with the Windows version released on 21 May 2014 and for other platforms later in 2015. The Director's Cut adds story elements to the game, with a script penned by video game writer Rob Yescombe, and with voice acting by Rachel Robinson and Rupert Evans. In addition, the game features ten new levels for speedrun trials, a new musical score, and support for the virtual reality Oculus Rift headset. Reception Q.U.B.E. was one of the twelve finalists, but did not win, for the 2011 Indie Game Challenge sponsored by the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences. The game received an aggregated score of 69/100 on Metacritic, indicating mixed or average reviews. Reviewers noted that the game was immediately comparable to the two Portal games, providing puzzles within a sterile environment. The game was praised for building on similar puzzle mechanics while introducing its own ideas. Puzzles involving magnetism, however, were found to be rather tedious compared to the other puzzle elements. The presentation of the new gameplay elements was considered to be well-done, providing a gentle introduction for each before culminating into a larger puzzle. At the same time, reviewers noted that the game lacked any of the personality in story or atmosphere that Portal provided, leaving the player's experience lacking and providing no goal for the player to continue towards beyond seeing what the next puzzle may be. Reviews also noted that the physics of some of the objects like balls and blocks were strange to the point of being manipulated by the game to assure completion of certain puzzles instead of allowing for unlucky bounces that would happen in real life. Sequel Toxic Games showed an early demo version of the sequel Q.U.B.E. 2 to the press during the March 2017 Game Developers Conference; Jessica Conditt of Engadget commented that \\"Q.U.B.E. 2 takes the best aspects of the original and throws them all in a beautiful new 3D environment\\" in an Engadget article. The player takes the role of Amelia Cross, a British archeologist who awakes in an abstract space, and is guided by another entity, Emma, on solving puzzles to help her escape. While the first game required players to use cubes that already existed in the environment, Q.U.B.E. 2 gives players the ability to create cubes of different functions to now control the environment. The game was released on Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One platforms on March 13, 2018. In August 2017, Toxic Games announced that Q.U.B.E. 2 was set for an early 2018 release for Windows, macOS, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Along with a new setting, Q.U.B.E. 2 was developed with a stronger narrative while providing more non-linearity to the game's approach. In addition to Toxic Games' staff, additional material was provided by environmental artist Harry Corr, composer David Housden, and writer and producer Benjamin Hill. The sequel was built using Unreal Engine 4, with minimal coding as the original game; the team expanded to include only one programmer, Jonathan Savery, who developed reusable objects for the game in Unreal's Blueprint system.

Rangaraj. The film stars Mohan, Lakshmi and Revathi, with Goundamani, Anand Babu, and Prathapachandran in supporting roles. It revolves around a singer who is facing a death sentence for a murder he did not commit, and the efforts of a young girl to clear his name. The film was released on 13 April 1985 and was a commercial success, running for 148 days in theatres and thereby becoming a silver jubilee film.  Plot  Arun is a singer sentenced to death. He meets Shanthi, a fan, during one of his concerts and she follows him on many occasions both within and outside prison. Arun shows deep animosity towards Shanthi's behaviour and continuously shuns her, but a persistent Shanthi refuses to give up. Maari, an inmate, attempts a prison escape but is stopped by Arun. He tells Arun about his sick daughter, and his inability to pay for her operation. A sympathetic Arun promises to raise funds for the sick child through his next concert, which he also plans shall be his final one. Leela Chowdhry is the newly appointed Superintendent of Police for the Madras Central Jail, where Arun is imprisoned. Shanthi talks her into getting her married to Arun, who also agrees to it after deeply thinking and deliberating. The wedding takes places in Leela's house. During their wedding night, Shanthi stabs Arun and reveals herself as the sister of Anand, for whose murder Arun was convicted. Anand was Arun's musical partner in their troupe before his murder. Arun claims he was wrongfully convicted and Shanthi, believing him, promises to clear his name. Leela allows Shanthi and Arun to go to a nearby temple, but sends policemen along with them to prevent Arun from escaping. Shanthi outsmarts them and takes Arun to her home where she imprisons him, much to his dislike. She makes it seemingly impossible for him to escape, until she is able to prove his innocence. Leela is later punished for having let Arun \\"escape\\", and simultaneously realises that Arun is her long lost son, becoming heartbroken. However, she remains bound to her duty of capturing Arun, and a manhunt for him begins. Shanthi later meets Shankar, the real killer of Anand. He admits to the murder, but states that did so because he witnessed Anand sleeping with his wife. Shanthi, knowing that Shankar's wife is promiscuous (it was she who seduced the reluctant Anand), takes him to her and Shankar is angered on seeing his wife with another man in bed. He kills her, but not before she mortally wounds him. Arun, having escaped, is confronted by Leela who he realises is his mother. She allows him to perform his final concert, but has to have him hanged to death him after that. Right after he finishes his concert he is arrested, but Shanthi and Shankar finally arrive and tell the truth about Anand's death, after which Shankar succumbs. Arun's death sentence is revoked.

It is used in comprehensive community initiatives as well as small-scale settings and is designed to help groups accomplish their goals. According to David Fetterman, \\"Empowerment evaluation is the use of evaluation concepts, techniques, and findings to foster improvement and self-determination\\". An expanded definition is: \\"Empowerment evaluation is an evaluation approach that aims to increase the likelihood that programs will achieve results by increasing the capacity of program stakeholders to plan, implement, and evaluate their own programs.\\" Scope Empowerment evaluation has been used in programs ranging from a fifteen million dollar Hewlett-Packard corporate philanthropy effort to accreditation in higher education and from the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory‚Äôs Mars Mars Rover project to battered women's shelters. Empowerment evaluation has been used by government, foundations, businesses, and non- profits, as well as Native American reservations. It is a global phenomenon, with projects and workshops around the world including Australia, Brazil, Canada, Ethiopia, Finland, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Nepal, New Zealand, South Africa, Spain, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. A sample of sponsors and clients includes Casey Family Programs, Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Family & Children Services, Health Trust, Knight Foundation, Poynter, Stanford University, State of Arkansas, UNICEF and Volunteers of America. History and publications Empowerment evaluation was introduced in 1993 by David Fetterman during his presidential address at the American Evaluation Association‚Äôs (AEA) annual meeting. The approach was initially well received by some researchers who commented on the complementary relationship between EE and community psychology, social work, community development and adult education. They highlighted how it inverted traditional definitions of evaluation, shifting power from the evaluator to program staff and participants. Early supporters positively noted the focus on social justice and self-determination. One colleague compared the writings of approach to Martin Luther's 95 Theses. Empowerment Evaluation: Knowledge and Tools for Self-assessment and Accountability the first empowerment evaluation book, provided an introduction to theory and practice. It highlighted EE's scope, ranging from its use in a national educational reform movement to its endorsement by the W. K. Kellogg Foundation‚Äôs Director of Evaluation. The book presented examples in various contexts, including: federal, state, and local government, HIV prevention and related health initiatives, African American communities and battered women‚Äôs shelters. This first volume also provided various theoretical and philosophical frameworks as well as workshop and technical assistance tools. Foundations of Empowerment Evaluation, was the second EE book. The book provided steps and cases. It highlighted the role of the Internet to facilitate and disseminate the approach. The third book was titled: Empowerment evaluation principles in practice. It emphasized greater conceptual clarity by making explicit EE's underlying principles, ranging from improvement and inclusion to capacity building and social justice. In addition, it highlighted its commitment to accountability and outcomes, by stating them as an explicit principle and presenting substantive outcome examples. Cases described include educational reform, youth development programs and child abuse prevention programs.See Donaldson, 2005 review of Empowerment evaluation principles in practice  Theories  The primary theories guiding empowerment evaluation are process use and theories of use and action. Process use represents much of the rationale or logic underlying EE in practice, because it cultivates ownership by placing the approach in community and staff members‚Äô hands. The alignment of theories of use and action explain how empowerment evaluation helps people produce desired results. See Bandura, 1982 concerning self-efficacy. Process use Empowerment evaluation is designed to be used by people. It places evaluation in the hands of community and staff members. The more that people are engaged in conducting their own evaluations the more likely they are to believe in them, because the evaluation findings are theirs. In addition, a byproduct of this experience is that they learn to think lucratively. This makes them more likely to make decisions and take actions based on their evaluation data. This way of thinking is at the heart of process use. Principles Empowerment evaluation is guided by 10 principles. These principles help evaluators and community members align decisions with the larger purpose or goals associated with capacity building and self-determination. #Improvement ‚Äì help people improve program performance #Community ownership ‚Äì value and facilitate community control #Inclusion ‚Äì invite involvement, participation, and diversity #Democratic participation ‚Äì open participation and fair decision making #Social justice ‚Äì address social inequities in society #Community knowledge ‚Äì respect and value community knowledge #Evidence-based strategies ‚Äì respect and use both community and scholarly knowledge #Capacity building ‚Äì enhance stakeholder ability to evaluate and improve planning and implementation #Organizational learning ‚Äì apply data to evaluate and implement practices and inform decision making #Accountability ‚Äì emphasize outcomes and accountability Concepts Key concepts include: critical friends, cultures of evidence, cycles of reflection and action, communities of learners, and reflective practitioners. A critical friend, for example, is an evaluator who provide constructive feedback. They help to ensure the evaluation remains organized, rigorous and honest. Steps EE's three-step approach includes: #establish their mission; #review their current status; and #plan for the future. This approach is popular in part due to its simplicity, effectiveness and transparency. A second approach is the 10-step Getting to Outcomes (GTO). GTO helps participants answer 10 questions using relevant literature, methods and tools. The 10 accountability questions and literature to address them are: #What are the needs and resources? (Needs assessment; resource assessment) #What are the goals, target population and desired outcomes? (Goal setting) #How does the intervention incorporate knowledge of science and best practices in this area? (Science and best practices) #How does the intervention fit with existing programs? (Collaboration; cultural competence) #What capacities do you need to implement a quality program? (Capacity building) #How will this intervention be carried out? (Planning) #How will the quality of implementation be assessed? (Process evaluation) #How well did the intervention work? (Outcome and impact evaluation) #How will quality improvement strategies be incorporated? (Total quality management; continuous quality improvement) #If the intervention is (or components are) successful, how will the intervention be sustained? (Sustainability and institutionalization) A manual with worksheets addresses how to answer the questions. While GTO has been used primarily in substance abuse prevention, customized GTOs have been developed for preventing underage drinking and promoting positive youth development. Several books are downloadable. In addition, EE can employ photo journalism, online surveys, virtual conferencing and self-assessments. Monitoring Conventional and innovative evaluation tools monitor outcomes, including online surveys, focus groups and interviews, as well as the use of quasi-experimental designs. In addition, program specific metrics are developed, using baselines, benchmarks, goals and actual performance. For example, a minority tobacco prevention program in Arkansas established: #Baselines (the number of tobacco users) #Goals (the yearly number of subjects helped) #Benchmarks (the monthly number of subjects helped) #Performance (the number of subjects who stop smoking) These metrics help the community monitor implementation, by comparing performance with benchmarks. It also enables them to make mid-course corrections. Selected case examples Stanford University School of Medicine applied the technique to curricular decision making. EE contributed to improvements in course and clerkship ratings. For example, the average student ratings for required courses improved significantly (P = .04; Student‚Äôs one-sample t test). EE guided Hewlett-Packard‚Äôs $15 million Digital Village Initiative. The initiative was designed to help bridge the digital divide in communities of color. Outcomes ranged from Native American‚Äôs building one of the largest unlicensed wireless systems in the country to creating a high-resolution digital printing press. The State of Arkansas used EE in academically distressed schools and tobacco prevention. Outcomes include improving test scores, upgrading school-level performance and preventing and reducing tobacco consumption. A school district in South Carolina invested millions of their own dollars to provide each student with a personalized computing device as an educational tool. EE was used to support large scale implementation of the initiative and monitor outcomes associated with teacher and student behavior change.Lamont, A., Wright, A., Wandersman, A, & Hamm, D. (2014). An empowerment evaluation approach to implementing with quality at scale. In Fetterman, Kaftarian, & Wandersman (Eds), Empowerment evaluation: Knowledge and tools for self assessment, evaluation capacity building, & accountability (2nd ed). Rationale Response to critique EE is conducted by an internal group, not an external individual. Programs are dynamic, not static and thus require more fluid, responsive, and continual assessment. The evaluator becomes a coach, rather than the expert. Investigating worth and merit is not sufficient. The focus should also be on program improvement. Empowerment evaluation, as a group activity, builds in self-checks on bias. Internal and external forms of evaluation are compatible and reinforcing. However, the Joint Committee's standards were applied and empowerment evaluation was found to be consistent with the spirit of the standards. Empowerment evaluation is not a threat to traditional evaluation. It may instead help to revitalize it. Empowerment evaluation is part of an emancipatory research stream. Its unique contribution is its focus on fostering self-determination and building capacity. Empowerment evaluation is guided by process use. Additional effort could be made to further distinguish empowerment from collaborative, participatory, stakeholder, and utilization forms of evaluation. Empowerment evaluation should be limited or focused on the disenfranchised and issues of liberation. Empowerment evaluation has become a part of the evaluation landscape. Empowerment evaluation is part of a worldwide movement. It is now part of the evaluation field. However, empowerment evaluation needs to focus on the consumer, rather than staff members. In addition, the definition of empowerment evaluation has changed. Bias in evaluation can be removed by distancing oneself from the group or program being assessed. Internal and external forms of evaluation are needed. Empowerment evaluators serve as evaluation consultants. The definition of empowerment is the same as when the approach was first defined and introduced to the field. However, it has been expanded to further clarify the purpose of the approach. Fetterman and Wandersman agree that empowerment evaluation is part of an emancipatory stream of research. It also relies on process use to guide it. They also believe that greater effort is needed to further distinguish empowerment from other forms of stakeholder involved approaches. However, empowerment evaluation can be viewed along a continuum from less empowering to more empowering in nature. Empowerment evaluation is designed to help the disenfranchised. However, the boundaries are much broader and inclusive. Everyone can benefit from self- assessment and becoming more self-determined. Fetterman advocated that evaluation be shared with a broader population. Debates and controversy Empowerment evaluation challenged the status quo concerning who is in control of an evaluation and what it means to be an evaluator. Conventionally, evaluations are conducted by a specialist. In EE, the group or community performs the evaluation, guided by an empowerment evaluator or ‚Äúcritical friend.‚Äù First wave of criticism Shufflebeam claimed that evaluation should be left in the hands of professionals who objectively investigate the worth or merit of an object and that EE violates the (as yet unadopted) Joint Committee's Program Evaluation Standards. Fetterman and Scriven agreed on the value of both internal and external evaluations. They also agree on a focus on the consumer. However, staff members, sponsors, and policy makers also have important roles to play in evaluation. Scriven however claimed that the evaluator must maintain distance from program participants to avoid bias.Debate between Fetterman, Patton and Scriven is available online in text form from Journal of MultiDisciplinary Evaluation . It was also recorded and is available in Claremont's virtual library Chelimsky re-framed the discussion between Fetterman, Patton and Scriven, explaining that evaluations serve multiple purposes: 1) accountability; 2) development; and 3) knowledge. Scriven, and to a lesser extent Patton, focused on accountability, while Fetterman focused on development. Second wave  The second wave of debate and discussion emerged between 2005-2007. The primary critiques focused on conceptual and methodological clarity: Cousins attempted to differentiate between similar approaches, e.g. collaborative, participatory, and empowerment evaluation. Cousins asked whether EE is practical (focusing on decision making), or transformative (focusing on self-determination) and viewed self-evaluation as more likely to have a self-serving bias. This critic noted the variability in attempts at empowerment evaluation. Miller and Campbell conducted a systematic literature review of empowerment evaluation. They highlighted types or modes of EE, as well as settings, reasons for use, selection process and degree of participation. The highlighted practice variants depending on the size of the evaluation. They suggested that clients were selecting it for appropriate reasons, such as capacity building, self-determination, accountability, cultivating ownership and institutionalization of evaluations. However, they also found that approximately 25% were empowerment in name only. In addition, they argued for additional conceptual clarity. Patton accepted EE as part of the evaluation field and proposed that given its established status, additional clarity distinguishing collaborative, participatory, utilization and empowerment evaluation would be fruitful. He acknowledged improvements ranging improved definitions and added the 10 principles. He was concerned that self-determination was not on the list. Patton applauded and recommended process use for empowerment evaluation. He accepted the contributors' commitment to forthrightly describing problems. Patton proposed greater emphasis on outcomes or results in EE. Scriven believes that self-evaluation is flawed, because it is inherently self-serving, and rejected its use for professional development. He questioned the ability of EE to actually empower people and recommended a neutral evaluator role. He suggested that internal and external evaluations are not compatible. He also suggests that empowerment as well as randomized controls are merely forms of ideology. Response to critique Fetterman and Wandersman responded by attempting to enhance conceptual clarity, provide greater methodological specificity and highlight EEs commitment to accountability and outcomes. They acknowledged and applauded Miller and Campbell's systematic review of EE projects, while noting neglected or omitted case examples and questioning some of their methodology. They claimed that the 10 principles contributed to conceptual clarity and that people empower themselves. They asserted that evaluations are inherently subjective and are shaped by culture and political context, and that EE is committed to honesty and rigor. EE is more inclusive than traditional evaluations, placing cross-checks on data and decisions. Participants often know more about problems than outsiders and have a vested interest in making their programs work. They claimed that internal and external evaluations can operate together effectively as additional cross-checks. While the similarities among collaborative, participatory and empowerment evaluation were described in the first and second empowerment evaluation books, they recommended Cousins' tool to highlight the differences, focusing on depth of participation and control of evaluation technical decision making The most significant response to the critiques focused on outcomes. Fetterman & Wandersman argued that outcomes and results were important to EE. They highlighting specific project outcomes including: Outcomes *CDC funded a study using a quasi-experimental design that demonstrated improved outcomes as a result of empowerment evaluation. *Empowerment evaluation used in Arkansas distressed schools, increased standardized test scores. *Native American's built a wireless system and digital printing press supported by empowerment evaluation. * Stanford University's School of Medicine used EE to prepare for an accreditation site visit. Increases in student course ratings were statistically significant. *Arkansas save millions in excess medical costs from applying empowerment evaluation to tobacco prevention programs. This resulted in legislation creating the Arkansas Evaluation Center. Scriven's assessment Scriven agreed that external evaluators sometimes miss problems obvious to program staff members. He also stated they have less credibility with them than an internal evaluator. As a result, he concluded, it is less likely their recommendations will be implemented. Scriven agreed that EE contributed to improvements in internal staff program evaluations and that empowerment evaluation could make a contribution to evaluation if combined with third-party evaluation. Professional association affiliation and awards Empowerment evaluation was a catalyst for the creation of the American Evaluation Association's Collaborative, Participatory, and Empowerment Evaluation topical interest group. Approximately 20% of the American Evaluation Association membership is affiliated with the topical interest group.

In 1922, the Wedell brothers left for New Orleans where they started an air service and a flying school. They met millionaire Harry P. Williams from Patterson, Louisiana. Williams was in the oil, sugar and lumber businesses and was married to Marguerite Clark, a former star of silent movies. Wedell taught Williams how to fly and they became the best of friends, bonded by their interest in aviation.Hirsch and Schultz 2001, p. 5.

The site supports a wide variety of flora and fauna and includes Bronze Age barrows. Conservation work is carried out on the site by the owners, the Cornwall Wildlife Trust. Geography The SSSI, notified in 1979, is located north of the hamlet of Rosenannon within the civil parish of St Wenn, south-west of the town of Wadebridge. The streams rising on this site feed into the River Camel Valley and Tributaries SSSI.Ordnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 200 Newquay & Bodmin The nature reserve is owned and managed by the Cornwall Wildlife Trust. The Downs have been leased by the Trust from 1999 and were bequeathed to them in 2009 by Theresa Knowles. History A Bronze Age barrow within the nature reserve To the north of the site are three Bronze Age barrows, dated to around 2500 BC. The SSSI was previously named Rosenannon Bog, but was renamed after the site was expanded to its current limits. The Downs have not been grazed since the 1960s, although a proposal to reintroduce this is going ahead. Wildlife and ecology Flora The two main types of habitat on the site are heathland and bogland, which support a wide variety of species. The dry heath comprises five main species of plant, of which the common heather (Calluna vulgaris) is the most prolific with bell heather (Erica cinerea) and western gorse (Ulex gallii) also dominant; bristle bent (Agrostis curtisii) and purple moor-grass (Molinia caerulea) to a lesser extent. Other species found in this habitat are heath milkwort (Polygala serpyllifolia), lousewort (Pedicularis sylvatica), saw-wort (Serratula tinctoria), deer grass (Trichophorum cespitosum) and the heath spotted-orchid (Dactylorhiza maculata). The wet heath areas also contain purple moor-grass along with bog myrtle (Myrica gale) and cross-leaved heath (Erica tetralix) as the three most prolific species. Black bogrush (Schoenus nigricans) are prominent in the wetter, more base-rich parts, whereas bog mosses (Sphagnum spp.) and the insectivorous round-leaved sundew (Drosera rotundifolia) can be found in the wet hollows. Along with cross-leaved heath and purple moor-grass the valley bog habitat supports bog asphodel (Narthecium ossifragum), bog pimpernel (Anagallis tenella), common cottongrass (Eriophorum angustifolium), lesser skullcap (Scutellaria minor), pale butterwort (Pinguicula lusitanica) and white beak-sedge (Rhynchospora alba). Royal fern (Osmunda regalis) and wavy St. John's-wort (Hypericum undulatum), species which are not common within Britain, can also be found in the bogland. A broad-leaved woodland surrounds the valley bog which mainly contains sessile oak (Quercus petraea), and willows (Salix spp.). An area of scrub is present on the southern edge of the Downs, which supports Cornish bladderseed (Physospermum cornubiense). Fauna Heathland birds which feed, nest and breed on the site include the common snipe (Gallinago gallinago), curlew (Numenius arquata), and the meadow pipit (Anthus pratensis), as well as the stonechat (Saxicola torquata), which is in national decline. Other birds recorded on the reserve include the hen harrier (Circus cyaneus), Montagu's harrier (Circus pygargus) and the skylark (Alauda arvensis). Conservation alt=An orange butterfly sitting on a pink flower The Cornwall Wildlife Trust has been given permission by the Secretary of State for Environment to allow the site to be fenced in order to re-introduce cattle grazing on the site for management purposes. This is to be carried out in order to reduce the chance of uncontrolled fires and to benefit the small pearl-bordered fritillary butterfly (Boloria selene), whose larva feed mainly on marsh violet (Viola palustris) on the mid‚ÄìCornwall moors; a low‚Äìgrowing plant which is out competed by the more vigorous purple moor- grass. Fencing to enable cattle grazing was started in December 2011. For the third year in the last four there has been an uncontrolled fire on the reserve which is thought to be arson; the latest in March 2012 burnt .

The club was established in 1876 and is the oldest lacrosse club in England. Stockport currently field both men's and women's lacrosse teams as well as running respective junior programmes. The club have been based at Cale Green Pavilion in Davenport since 1883. History The Beginning Stockport Lacrosse Club was founded in 1876 as a result of an exhibition tour organised by the \\"founding father of the modern game', William George Beers. Stockport Lacrosse Club is widely regarded as one of (if not the) oldest existing lacrosse club in the world. Montreal Lacrosse Club and Mohawk Lacrosse Club were founded earlier but have folded and re- formed in that period.http://www.pitchero.com/clubs/stockportlacrosseclub/news/stockport- lacrosse-club-a-glorious-history-1420574.html The Great Years The Senior Flags victory of 1896 was the start of the first of two conquering periods. For eight consecutive seasons from 1896 to 1903, Stockport swept aside all opposition to win the Flags, a record that has not been equalled since. In the same period the Iroquois Cup and First division Championship were both won six times. The Club has to thank in particular two families, the Masons and Johnsons whose family members made up between them nine out of the total of twenty who played on the team during that period. The Mason family alone accounting for six of the players. A major trophy of the period remains in the possession of the Club. This is the Flags Final Challenge Flag, which was won outright in 1898. The flag is a large, finely detailed embroidered Trophy depicting two lacrosse players dressed in the kit of the period stood on each side of a shield, with the winning Clubs of the previous seasons scrolled on each side. The Challenge Flag is permanently on display at the Club's Headquarters. Cale Green Pavilion In 1883, the Mayor of Stockport, Henry Bell JP, donated the Cale Green ground to the town with financial support from the club. This ground was the home to Stockport Lacrosse Club but also to Stockport Cricket Club and Cheshire County Cricket Club. The layout of the ground has changed very little over the years, with the cricket pitch in front of the pavilion, two bowling greens and a separate pitch on a lower level which is the club's main pitch. The original pavilion is shown on the right, shows the original entrance in the middle at the front, and two windows above the door. The enclosure in front of the pavilion was for club members only, and a tiered grass banking led down to the pitch. It was some fifty years before the next major change, which saw an extension being added to the western end of the building which in due course became the function room. There is a clear line along the roof tiles which shows the size of the extension. The extension also added a new area below ground and the changing rooms were moved below ground with the exit being next to the front door. The picture to the right shows the extension, and also the effects of some maintenance which has led to the removal of the two windows above the door and the central chimney from the roof. L. R. Grainger Junior development is the key to the future of lacrosse. Throughout the decades, in particular since 1945 there has been a number of stalwarts of Junior Schemes who gave themselves the task of developing their own particular club's juniors and given the natural ageing process, the senior strength also. Without the existence of this dedicated care during the 1950s and 60s many of the clubs which were able to continue after the War years could have faded through the lack of new players. One such stalwart for the Stockport Club in 1950 was Les Grainger. Another such enthusiasts of that period was Ted Donnet for South Manchester and Wythenshawe. Les took on Stockport's juniors at the Annual General Meeting on Monday 12 September 1949 when he was appointed unanimously as Honorary Junior Secretary for the then forthcoming season 1949/50. The first junior games arranged by Les in his new role as Junior Secretary were... 22 October, Manchester Grammar School, 24 November, Ashton, 7 January, Cheadle. There is no record of the results entered into the minute's books, however Leslie's memory provides a favourable record if not an actual result. The position of Junior Scheme Secretary was retained by Les without a break through the '50s, '60s '70s and '80s until 1989, a total of forty continuous years. A remarkable record of achievement. Retirement was not on the agenda however, the all-encompassing position of recruitment, beginners and U12s team manager was undertaken until the early 2000s when he retired due to health reasons. A quite remarkable fact is that virtually all the current Stockport players from the juniors upwards, through all the senior teams, including the veterans, have been trained within the L.R.G. Junior training scheme and bear all the skills and loyalty alike. Another major achievement by Leslie was the creation of the Stockport Metros, an umbrella organisation for combinations of Clubs to be able take juniors on tours with specifically the USA in mind, and has succeeded in doing so on 13 occasions since 1976, the last twelve of these being part of an annual exchange with Anne Arundel County Youth Lacrosse, Maryland, USA, which still continues.http://metroslacrosse.co.uk/about-the- metros/history/ Mr. Grainger died in 2011.http://metroslacrosse.co.uk/mr-g/ Senior Lacrosse Men's Lacrosse Stockport currently field three senior men's teams.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. History In the 1910s and 1920, the booming automobile business expanded Lansing's population, and the schools became overcrowded. Several new subdivisions on the south side of Lansing caused the school overcrowding there to become acute, and in 1924, the Lansing School Board acquired a six-acre lot on which to build a school. The Board hired local architect Judson N. Churchill to design a building. Construction began in late 1924, and the school was completed in time for classes in 1925. It had space for grades seven through nine, and additional space for grades one through six. In 1950, the school was converted to be completely a junior high, and in 1957 a new wing was added. However, falling enrollment cased the school to be closed in 1981. In 1983, the Eyde company purchased the school building. In 1996 the building re-opened as a charter school, the Walter French Academy of Business and Technology, which included a middle and high school. About four years later, sometime between 1999 and 2000, it added a K-12 program to become the \\"...first local public school to offer kindergarten through 12th grade under one roof.\\" In 2004, the school lost ties to its authorizer, Central Michigan University and was ultimately shut down that year due to financial problems. On August 5 2016 the building caught fire; the cause of the fire was unknown. In January 2018, the families of Louis and George Eyde donated the building to the Capital Area Housing Partnership, a non-profit affordable housing group. The organization plans to redevelop the building for housing. Description The Walter H. French Junior High School is a three-story, steel-frame brick building constructed in a Tudor style with a flat roof and large window bays. The exterior features elaborate stone door surrounds and intricate polychromatic brickwork in red, yellow, and brown shades. Another wing projects to the rear; this wing was enlarged with additions in 1957 and in the 1970s. A limestone base rises to the sill level of the first floor windows, and there is a stone belt course between the first and second stories. The main building has two wings, meeting at a right angle with a three-bay angled facade at the intersection. The formal entry is at this intersection, through an elliptical arch. A secondary entrance is at one end of one of the wings.

The social network perspective provides a set of methods for analyzing the structure of whole social entities as well as a variety of theories explaining the patterns observed in these structures. The study of these structures uses social network analysis to identify local and global patterns, locate influential entities, and examine network dynamics. Social networks and the analysis of them is an inherently interdisciplinary academic field which emerged from social psychology, sociology, statistics, and graph theory. Georg Simmel authored early structural theories in sociology emphasizing the dynamics of triads and \\"web of group affiliations\\". Jacob Moreno is credited with developing the first sociograms in the 1930s to study interpersonal relationships. These approaches were mathematically formalized in the 1950s and theories and methods of social networks became pervasive in the social and behavioral sciences by the 1980s. Social network analysis is now one of the major paradigms in contemporary sociology, and is also employed in a number of other social and formal sciences. Together with other complex networks, it forms part of the nascent field of network science. Overview Barab√°si model. The social network is a theoretical construct useful in the social sciences to study relationships between individuals, groups, organizations, or even entire societies (social units, see differentiation). The term is used to describe a social structure determined by such interactions. The ties through which any given social unit connects represent the convergence of the various social contacts of that unit. This theoretical approach is, necessarily, relational. An axiom of the social network approach to understanding social interaction is that social phenomena should be primarily conceived and investigated through the properties of relations between and within units, instead of the properties of these units themselves. Thus, one common criticism of social network theory is that individual agency is often ignoredScott, John P. (2000). Social Network Analysis: A Handbook (2nd edition). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications. although this may not be the case in practice (see agent-based modeling). Precisely because many different types of relations, singular or in combination, form these network configurations, network analytics are useful to a broad range of research enterprises. In social science, these fields of study include, but are not limited to anthropology, biology, communication studies, economics, geography, information science, organizational studies, social psychology, sociology, and sociolinguistics. History In the late 1890s, both √âmile Durkheim and Ferdinand T√∂nnies foreshadowed the idea of social networks in their theories and research of social groups. T√∂nnies argued that social groups can exist as personal and direct social ties that either link individuals who share values and belief (Gemeinschaft, German, commonly translated as \\"community\\") or impersonal, formal, and instrumental social links (Gesellschaft, German, commonly translated as \\"society\\").T√∂nnies, Ferdinand (1887). Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft, Leipzig: Fues's Verlag. (Translated, 1957 by Charles Price Loomis as Community and Society, East Lansing: Michigan State University Press.) Durkheim gave a non-individualistic explanation of social facts, arguing that social phenomena arise when interacting individuals constitute a reality that can no longer be accounted for in terms of the properties of individual actors.Durkheim, Emile (1893). De la division du travail social: √©tude sur l'organisation des soci√©t√©s sup√©rieures, Paris: F. Alcan. (Translated, 1964, by Lewis A. Coser as The Division of Labor in Society, New York: Free Press.) Georg Simmel, writing at the turn of the twentieth century, pointed to the nature of networks and the effect of network size on interaction and examined the likelihood of interaction in loosely knit networks rather than groups.Simmel, Georg (1908). Soziologie, Leipzig: Duncker & Humblot. Moreno's sociogram of a 2nd grade class Major developments in the field can be seen in the 1930s by several groups in psychology, anthropology, and mathematics working independently.For a historical overview of the development of social network analysis, see: See also the diagram in In psychology, in the 1930s, Jacob L. Moreno began systematic recording and analysis of social interaction in small groups, especially classrooms and work groups (see sociometry). In anthropology, the foundation for social network theory is the theoretical and ethnographic work of Bronislaw Malinowski,Malinowski, Bronislaw (1913).

Human Relations, (7): 39‚Äì58. J. Clyde Mitchell and Elizabeth Bott Spillius, often are credited with performing some of the first fieldwork from which network analyses were performed, investigating community networks in southern Africa, India and the United Kingdom. Concomitantly, British anthropologist S. F. Nadel codified a theory of social structure that was influential in later network analysis.Nadel, S. F. 1957. The Theory of Social Structure. London: Cohen and West. In sociology, the early (1930s) work of Talcott Parsons set the stage for taking a relational approach to understanding social structure.Parsons, Talcott ([1937] 1949). The Structure of Social Action: A Study in Social Theory with Special Reference to a Group of European Writers. New York: The Free Press.Parsons, Talcott (1951). The Social System. New York: The Free Press. Later, drawing upon Parsons' theory, the work of sociologist Peter Blau provides a strong impetus for analyzing the relational ties of social units with his work on social exchange theory.Blau, Peter (1956). Bureaucracy in Modern Society. New York: Random House, Inc.Blau, Peter (1960). \\"A Theory of Social Integration\\". The American Journal of Sociology, (65)6: 545‚Äì556, (May).Blau, Peter (1964). Exchange and Power in Social Life. By the 1970s, a growing number of scholars worked to combine the different tracks and traditions. One group consisted of sociologist Harrison White and his students at the Harvard University Department of Social Relations. Also independently active in the Harvard Social Relations department at the time were Charles Tilly, who focused on networks in political and community sociology and social movements, and Stanley Milgram, who developed the \\"six degrees of separation\\" thesis.

D. Berkowitz. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. Beginning in the late 1990s, social network analysis experienced work by sociologists, political scientists, and physicists such as Duncan J. Watts, Albert-L√°szl√≥ Barab√°si, Peter Bearman, Nicholas A. Christakis, James H. Fowler, and others, developing and applying new models and methods to emerging data available about online social networks, as well as \\"digital traces\\" regarding face-to-face networks. Levels of analysis Self-organization of a network, based on Nagler, Levina, & Timme, (2011) Centrality In general, social networks are self-organizing, emergent, and complex, such that a globally coherent pattern appears from the local interaction of the elements that make up the system.Newman, Mark, Albert-L√°szl√≥ Barab√°si and Duncan J. Watts (2006). The Structure and Dynamics of Networks (Princeton Studies in Complexity). Oxford: Princeton University Press. These patterns become more apparent as network size increases. However, a global network analysis of, for example, all interpersonal relationships in the world is not feasible and is likely to contain so much information as to be uninformative. Practical limitations of computing power, ethics and participant recruitment and payment also limit the scope of a social network analysis.Kadushin, C. (2012). Understanding social networks: Theories, concepts, and findings. Oxford: Oxford University Press. The nuances of a local system may be lost in a large network analysis, hence the quality of information may be more important than its scale for understanding network properties. Thus, social networks are analyzed at the scale relevant to the researcher's theoretical question. Although levels of analysis are not necessarily mutually exclusive, there are three general levels into which networks may fall: micro-level, meso-level, and macro-level. Micro level At the micro-level, social network research typically begins with an individual, snowballing as social relationships are traced, or may begin with a small group of individuals in a particular social context. Dyadic level: A dyad is a social relationship between two individuals. Network research on dyads may concentrate on structure of the relationship (e.g. multiplexity, strength), social equality, and tendencies toward reciprocity/mutuality. Triadic level: Add one individual to a dyad, and you have a triad. Research at this level may concentrate on factors such as balance and transitivity, as well as social equality and tendencies toward reciprocity/mutuality. In the balance theory of Fritz Heider the triad is the key to social dynamics. The discord in a rivalrous love triangle is an example of an unbalanced triad, likely to change to a balanced triad by a change in one of the relations. The dynamics of social friendships in society has been modeled by balancing triads. The study is carried forward with the theory of signed graphs. Actor level: The smallest unit of analysis in a social network is an individual in their social setting, i.e., an \\"actor\\" or \\"ego\\". Egonetwork analysis focuses on network characteristics such as size, relationship strength, density, centrality, prestige and roles such as isolates, liaisons, and bridges. Such analyses, are most commonly used in the fields of psychology or social psychology, ethnographic kinship analysis or other genealogical studies of relationships between individuals. Subset level: Subset levels of network research problems begin at the micro-level, but may cross over into the meso-level of analysis. Subset level research may focus on distance and reachability, cliques, cohesive subgroups, or other group actions or behavior. Meso level In general, meso-level theories begin with a population size that falls between the micro- and macro-levels. However, meso- level may also refer to analyses that are specifically designed to reveal connections between micro- and macro-levels. Meso-level networks are low density and may exhibit causal processes distinct from interpersonal micro- level networks. Social network diagram, meso-level Organizations: Formal organizations are social groups that distribute tasks for a collective goal. Network research on organizations may focus on either intra-organizational or inter-organizational ties in terms of formal or informal relationships. Intra- organizational networks themselves often contain multiple levels of analysis, especially in larger organizations with multiple branches, franchises or semi- autonomous departments. In these cases, research is often conducted at a work group level and organization level, focusing on the interplay between the two structures. Experiments with networked groups online have documented ways to optimize group-level coordination through diverse interventions, including the addition of autonomous agents to the groups. Randomly distributed networks: Exponential random graph models of social networks became state-of-the-art methods of social network analysis in the 1980s. This framework has the capacity to represent social-structural effects commonly observed in many human social networks, including general degree-based structural effects commonly observed in many human social networks as well as reciprocity and transitivity, and at the node-level, homophily and attribute-based activity and popularity effects, as derived from explicit hypotheses about dependencies among network ties. Parameters are given in terms of the prevalence of small subgraph configurations in the network and can be interpreted as describing the combinations of local social processes from which a given network emerges. These probability models for networks on a given set of actors allow generalization beyond the restrictive dyadic independence assumption of micro- networks, allowing models to be built from theoretical structural foundations of social behavior. Examples of a random network and a scale-free network. Each graph has 32 nodes and 32 links. Note the \\"hubs\\" (shaded) in the scale- free diagram (on the right). Scale-free networks: A scale-free network is a network whose degree distribution follows a power law, at least asymptotically. In network theory a scale-free ideal network is a random network with a degree distribution that unravels the size distribution of social groups. Specific characteristics of scale-free networks vary with the theories and analytical tools used to create them, however, in general, scale- free networks have some common characteristics. One notable characteristic in a scale-free network is the relative commonness of vertices with a degree that greatly exceeds the average. The highest-degree nodes are often called \\"hubs\\", and may serve specific purposes in their networks, although this depends greatly on the social context. Another general characteristic of scale-free networks is the clustering coefficient distribution, which decreases as the node degree increases. This distribution also follows a power law.Barab√°si, Albert-L√°szl√≥ (2003). Linked: how everything is connected to everything else and what it means for business, science, and everyday life. New York: Plum. The Barab√°si model of network evolution shown above is an example of a scale- free network. Macro level Rather than tracing interpersonal interactions, macro-level analyses generally trace the outcomes of interactions, such as economic or other resource transfer interactions over a large population. Diagram: section of a large-scale social network Large-scale networks: Large-scale network is a term somewhat synonymous with \\"macro-level\\" as used, primarily, in social and behavioral sciences, in economics. Originally, the term was used extensively in the computer sciences (see large- scale network mapping). Complex networks: Most larger social networks display features of social complexity, which involves substantial non-trivial features of network topology, with patterns of complex connections between elements that are neither purely regular nor purely random (see, complexity science, dynamical system and chaos theory), as do biological, and technological networks. Such complex network features include a heavy tail in the degree distribution, a high clustering coefficient, assortativity or disassortativity among vertices, community structure (see stochastic block model), and hierarchical structure. In the case of agency-directed networks these features also include reciprocity, triad significance profile (TSP, see network motif), and other features. In contrast, many of the mathematical models of networks that have been studied in the past, such as lattices and random graphs, do not show these features. Theoretical links Imported theories Various theoretical frameworks have been imported for the use of social network analysis. The most prominent of these are Graph theory, Balance theory, Social comparison theory, and more recently, the Social identity approach. Indigenous theories Few complete theories have been produced from social network analysis. Two that have are structural role theory and heterophily theory. The basis of Heterophily Theory was the finding in one study that more numerous weak ties can be important in seeking information and innovation, as cliques have a tendency to have more homogeneous opinions as well as share many common traits. This homophilic tendency was the reason for the members of the cliques to be attracted together in the first place. However, being similar, each member of the clique would also know more or less what the other members knew. To find new information or insights, members of the clique will have to look beyond the clique to its other friends and acquaintances. This is what Granovetter called \\"the strength of weak ties\\". Structural holes In the context of networks, social capital exists where people have an advantage because of their location in a network. Contacts in a network provide information, opportunities and perspectives that can be beneficial to the central player in the network. Most social structures tend to be characterized by dense clusters of strong connections. Information within these clusters tends to be rather homogeneous and redundant. Non-redundant information is most often obtained through contacts in different clusters. When two separate clusters possess non-redundant information, there is said to be a structural hole between them. Thus, a network that bridges structural holes will provide network benefits that are in some degree additive, rather than overlapping. An ideal network structure has a vine and cluster structure, providing access to many different clusters and structural holes. Networks rich in structural holes are a form of social capital in that they offer information benefits. The main player in a network that bridges structural holes is able to access information from diverse sources and clusters. For example, in business networks, this is beneficial to an individual's career because he is more likely to hear of job openings and opportunities if his network spans a wide range of contacts in different industries/sectors. This concept is similar to Mark Granovetter's theory of weak ties, which rests on the basis that having a broad range of contacts is most effective for job attainment. Research clusters Communication Communication Studies are often considered a part of both the social sciences and the humanities, drawing heavily on fields such as sociology, psychology, anthropology, information science, biology, political science, and economics as well as rhetoric, literary studies, and semiotics. Many communication concepts describe the transfer of information from one source to another, and can thus be conceived of in terms of a network. Community In J.A. Barnes' day, a \\"community\\" referred to a specific geographic location and studies of community ties had to do with who talked, associated, traded, and attended church with whom. Today, however, there are extended \\"online\\" communities developed through telecommunications devices and social network services. Such devices and services require extensive and ongoing maintenance and analysis, often using network science methods. Community development studies, today, also make extensive use of such methods. Complex networks Complex networks require methods specific to modelling and interpreting social complexity and complex adaptive systems, including techniques of dynamic network analysis. Mechanisms such as Dual- phase evolution explain how temporal changes in connectivity contribute to the formation of structure in social networks. Criminal networks In criminology and urban sociology, much attention has been paid to the social networks among criminal actors. For example, murders can be seen as a series of exchanges between gangs. Murders can be seen to diffuse outwards from a single source, because weaker gangs cannot afford to kill members of stronger gangs in retaliation, but must commit other violent acts to maintain their reputation for strength. Diffusion of innovations Diffusion of ideas and innovations studies focus on the spread and use of ideas from one actor to another or one culture and another. This line of research seeks to explain why some become \\"early adopters\\" of ideas and innovations, and links social network structure with facilitating or impeding the spread of an innovation. Demography In demography, the study of social networks has led to new sampling methods for estimating and reaching populations that are hard to enumerate (for example, homeless people or intravenous drug users.) For example, respondent driven sampling is a network-based sampling technique that relies on respondents to a survey recommending further respondents. Economic sociology The field of sociology focuses almost entirely on networks of outcomes of social interactions. More narrowly, economic sociology considers behavioral interactions of individuals and groups through social capital and social \\"markets\\". Sociologists, such as Mark Granovetter, have developed core principles about the interactions of social structure, information, ability to punish or reward, and trust that frequently recur in their analyses of political, economic and other institutions. Granovetter examines how social structures and social networks can affect economic outcomes like hiring, price, productivity and innovation and describes sociologists' contributions to analyzing the impact of social structure and networks on the economy. Health care Analysis of social networks is increasingly incorporated into health care analytics, not only in epidemiological studies but also in models of patient communication and education, disease prevention, mental health diagnosis and treatment, and in the study of health care organizations and systems.Levy, Judith and Bernice Pescosolido (2002). Social Networks and Health. Boston, MA: JAI Press. Human ecology Human ecology is an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary study of the relationship between humans and their natural, social, and built environments. The scientific philosophy of human ecology has a diffuse history with connections to geography, sociology, psychology, anthropology, zoology, and natural ecology.Crona, Beatrice and Klaus Hubacek (eds.) (2010). \\"Special Issue: Social network analysis in natural resource governance\\". Ecology and Society, 48.Ernstson, Henrich (2010). \\"Reading list: Using social network analysis (SNA) in social-ecological studies\\". Resilience Science Language and linguistics Studies of language and linguistics, particularly evolutionary linguistics, focus on the development of linguistic forms and transfer of changes, sounds or words, from one language system to another through networks of social interaction. Social networks are also important in language shift, as groups of people add and/or abandon languages to their repertoire. Literary networks In the study of literary systems, network analysis has been applied by Anheier, Gerhards and Romo, De Nooy, and Senekal, to study various aspects of how literature functions. The basic premise is that polysystem theory, which has been around since the writings of Even-Zohar, can be integrated with network theory and the relationships between different actors in the literary network, e.g. writers, critics, publishers, literary histories, etc., can be mapped using visualization from SNA. Organizational studies Research studies of formal or informal organization relationships, organizational communication, economics, economic sociology, and other resource transfers. Social networks have also been used to examine how organizations interact with each other, characterizing the many informal connections that link executives together, as well as associations and connections between individual employees at different organizations. Many organizational social network studies focus on teams. Within team network studies, research assesses, for example, the predictors and outcomes of centrality and power, density and centralization of team instrumental and expressive ties, and the role of between-team networks. Intra-organizational networks have been found to affect organizational commitment, organizational identification, interpersonal citizenship behaviour. Social capital Social capital is a form of economic and cultural capital in which social networks are central, transactions are marked by reciprocity, trust, and cooperation, and market agents produce goods and services not mainly for themselves, but for a common good. Social capital is split into three dimensions: the structural, the relational and the cognitive dimension. The structural dimension describes how partners interact with each other and which specific partners meet in a social network. Also The structural dimension of social capital indicates the level of ties among organizations.(Claridge, 2018).. This dimension is highly connected to the relational dimension which refers to trustworthiness, norms, expectations and idenfications of the bonds between partners.The relational dimension explains the nature of these ties which is mainly illustrated by the level of trust accorded to the network of organizations. (Claridge, 2018). The cognitive dimension analyses the extent to which organizations share common goals and objectives as a result of their ties and interactions. (Claridge, 2018). Social capital is a sociological concept about the value of social relations and the role of cooperation and confidence to achieve positive outcomes. The term refers to the value one can get from their social ties. For example, newly arrived immigrants can make use of their social ties to established migrants to acquire jobs they may otherwise have trouble getting (e.g., because of unfamiliarity with the local language). A positive relationship exists between social capital and the intensity of social network use. In a dynamic framework, higher activity in a network feeds into higher social capital which itself encourages more activity.  Advertising  This particular cluster focuses on brand-image and promotional strategy effectiveness, taking into account the impact of customer participation on sales and brand-image. This is gauged through techniques such as sentiment analysis which rely on mathematical areas of study such as data mining and analytics. This area of research produces vast numbers of commercial applications as the main goal of any study is to understand consumer behaviour and drive sales. Network position and benefits In many organizations, members tend to focus their activities inside their own groups, which stifles creativity and restricts opportunities. A player whose network bridges structural holes has an advantage in detecting and developing rewarding opportunities. Such a player can mobilize social capital by acting as a \\"broker\\" of information between two clusters that otherwise would not have been in contact, thus providing access to new ideas, opinions and opportunities. British philosopher and political economist John Stuart Mill, writes, \\"it is hardly possible to overrate the value ... of placing human beings in contact with persons dissimilar to themselves.... Such communication [is] one of the primary sources of progress.\\" Thus, a player with a network rich in structural holes can add value to an organization through new ideas and opportunities. This in turn, helps an individual's career development and advancement. A social capital broker also reaps control benefits of being the facilitator of information flow between contacts. In the case of consulting firm Eden McCallum, the founders were able to advance their careers by bridging their connections with former big three consulting firm consultants and mid-size industry firms. By bridging structural holes and mobilizing social capital, players can advance their careers by executing new opportunities between contacts. There has been research that both substantiates and refutes the benefits of information brokerage. A study of high tech Chinese firms by Zhixing Xiao found that the control benefits of structural holes are \\"dissonant to the dominant firm-wide spirit of cooperation and the information benefits cannot materialize due to the communal sharing values\\" of such organizations.Xiao, Zhixing; Tsui, Anne (2007). \\"When Brokers May Not Work: The Cultural Contingency of Social Capital in Chinese High-tech Firms\\". Administrative Science Quarterly. However, this study only analyzed Chinese firms, which tend to have strong communal sharing values. Information and control benefits of structural holes are still valuable in firms that are not quite as inclusive and cooperative on the firm- wide level. In 2004, Ronald Burt studied 673 managers who ran the supply chain for one of America's largest electronics companies. He found that managers who often discussed issues with other groups were better paid, received more positive job evaluations and were more likely to be promoted. Thus, bridging structural holes can be beneficial to an organization, and in turn, to an individual's career. Social media Computer networks combined with social networking software produces a new medium for social interaction. A relationship over a computerized social networking service can be characterized by context, direction, and strength. The content of a relation refers to the resource that is exchanged. In a computer mediated communication context, social pairs exchange different kinds of information, including sending a data file or a computer program as well as providing emotional support or arranging a meeting. With the rise of electronic commerce, information exchanged may also correspond to exchanges of money, goods or services in the \\"real\\" world. Social network analysis methods have become essential to examining these types of computer mediated communication. In addition, the sheer size and the volatile nature of social media has given rise to new network metrics. A key concern with networks extracted from social media is the lack of robustness of network metrics given missing data.

We claim that the best rank k approximation to A in the spectral norm, denoted by \\\\|\\\\cdot\\\\|_2, is given by : A_k = \\\\sum_{i=1}^k \\\\sigma_i u_i v_i^\\\\top where u_iand v_i denote the ith column of U and V, respectively. First, note that we have : \\\\|A-A_k\\\\|_2 = \\\\left\\\\|\\\\sum_{i=k+1}^n \\\\sigma_i u_i v_i^\\\\top \\\\right\\\\|_2 = \\\\sigma_{k+1} Therefore, we need to show that if B_k = XY^\\\\top where X and Y have k columns then \\\\|A-A_k\\\\|_2=\\\\sigma_{k+1}\\\\leq \\\\|A-B_k\\\\|_2. Since Y has k columns, then there must be a nontrivial linear combination of the first k+1 columns of V, i.e., : w = \\\\gamma_1v_1+\\\\cdots+\\\\gamma_{k+1}v_{k+1}, such that Y^\\\\top w = 0. Without loss of generality, we can scale w so that \\\\|w\\\\|_2 = 1 or (equivalently) \\\\gamma_1^2+\\\\cdots +\\\\gamma_{k+1}^2 = 1. Therefore, : \\\\|A-B_k\\\\|_2^2 \\\\geq \\\\|(A-B_k)w\\\\|_2^2 = \\\\|Aw\\\\|_2^2 = \\\\gamma_1^2\\\\sigma_1^2+\\\\cdots+\\\\gamma_{k+1}^2\\\\sigma_{k+1}^2\\\\geq \\\\sigma_{k+1}^2. The result follows by taking the square root of both sides of the above inequality.  Proof of Eckart‚ÄìYoung‚ÄìMirsky theorem (for Frobenius norm)  Let A\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{m\\\\times n} be a real (possibly rectangular) matrix with m\\\\geq n. Suppose that : A = U\\\\Sigma V^\\\\top is the singular value decomposition of A. We claim that the best rank k approximation to A in the Frobenius norm, denoted by \\\\|\\\\cdot\\\\|_F, is given by : A_k = \\\\sum_{i=1}^k \\\\sigma_i u_i v_i^\\\\top where u_i and v_i denote the ith column of U and V, respectively. First, note that we have : \\\\|A-A_k\\\\|_F^2 = \\\\left\\\\|\\\\sum_{i=k+1}^n \\\\sigma_i u_iv_i^\\\\top \\\\right\\\\|_F^2 = \\\\sum_{i=k+1}^n \\\\sigma_i^2 Therefore, we need to show that if B_k = XY^\\\\top where X and Y have k columns then : \\\\|A-A_k\\\\|_F^2=\\\\sum_{i=k+1}^n\\\\sigma_{i}^2\\\\leq \\\\|A-B_k\\\\|_F^2. By the triangle inequality with the spectral norm, if A = A' + A then \\\\sigma_1(A)\\\\leq \\\\sigma_1(A') + \\\\sigma_1(A). Suppose A'_k and A_k respectively denote the rank k approximation to A' and A by SVD method described above. Then, for any i,j\\\\geq1 : \\\\begin{align} \\\\sigma_i(A')+\\\\sigma_j(A) &= \\\\sigma_1(A'-A'_{i-1}) + \\\\sigma_1(A-A_{j-1})\\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\geq \\\\sigma_1(A-A'_{i-1}-A_{j-1})\\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\geq \\\\sigma_1(A-A_{i+j-2})\\\\qquad (\\\\text{since } {\\\\rm rank}(A'_{i-1}+A_{j-1})\\\\leq {\\\\rm rank\\\\,}A_{i+j-2})\\\\\\\\\\\\ &=\\\\sigma_{i+j-1}(A). \\\\end{align} Since \\\\sigma_{k+1}(B_k) = 0 , when A' = A-B_k and A = B_k we conclude that for i\\\\geq 1,j=k+1 : \\\\sigma_i(A-B_k) \\\\geq \\\\sigma_{k+i}(A). Therefore, : \\\\|A-B_k\\\\|_F^2 = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\sigma_i(A-B_k)^2 \\\\geq \\\\sum_{i=k+1}^n\\\\sigma_i(A)^2 = \\\\|A-A_k\\\\|_F^2, as required.  Weighted low-rank approximation problems  The Frobenius norm weights uniformly all elements of the approximation error D - \\\\widehat D. Prior knowledge about distribution of the errors can be taken into account by considering the weighted low-rank approximation problem : \\\\text{minimize} \\\\quad \\\\text{over } \\\\widehat D \\\\quad \\\\operatorname{vec}^{\\\\top}(D - \\\\widehat D) W \\\\operatorname{vec}(D - \\\\widehat D) \\\\quad\\\\text{subject to}\\\\quad \\\\operatorname{rank}(\\\\widehat D) \\\\leq r, where vec(A) vectorizes the matrix A column wise and W is a given positive (semi)definite weight matrix. The general weighted low-rank approximation problem does not admit an analytic solution in terms of the singular value decomposition and is solved by local optimization methods, which provide no guarantee that a globally optimal solution is found. In case of uncorrelated weights, weighted low-rank approximation problem also can be formulated in this way : for a non-negative matrix W and a matrix A we want to minimize \\\\sum_{i,j} ( W_{i,j}( A_{i,j} - B_{i,j} ))^2 over matrices, B, of rank at most r.  Entry-wise L_p low-rank approximation problems  Let \\\\|A\\\\|_p = \\\\left(\\\\sum_{i,j}|A_{i,j}^p|\\\\right)^{1/p} . For p = 2 , the fastest algorithm runs in nnz(A) + n \\\\cdot poly(k/\\\\epsilon) time , . One of the important ideas been used is called Oblivious Subspace Embedding (OSE), it is first proposed by Sarlos . For p = 1 , it is known that this entry-wise L1 norm is more robust than the Frobenius norm in the presence of outliers and is indicated in models where Gaussian assumptions on the noise may not apply. It is natural to seek to minimize \\\\|B - A\\\\|_1 . For p=0 and p \\\\geq 1, there are some algorithms with provable guarantees , .  Distance low-rank approximation problem  Let P = \\\\\\\\{ p_1 , \\\\ldots, p_m \\\\\\\\} and Q = \\\\\\\\{ q_1, \\\\ldots, q_n \\\\\\\\} be two point sets in an arbitrary metric space. Let A represent the m \\\\times n matrix where A_{i,j} = dist(p_i,q_i) . Such distances matrices are commonly computed in software packages and have applications to learning image manifolds, handwriting recognition, and multi- dimensional unfolding. In an attempt to reduce their description size, one can study low rank approximation of such matrices.  Distributed/Streaming low-rank approximation problem  The low-rank approximation problems in the distributed and streaming setting has been considered in .  Image and kernel representations of the rank constraints  Using the equivalences : \\\\operatorname{rank}(\\\\widehat D) \\\\leq r \\\\quad\\\\iff\\\\quad \\\\text{there are } P\\\\in\\\\R^{m\\\\times r} \\\\text{ and } L\\\\in\\\\R^{r\\\\times n} \\\\text{ such that } \\\\widehat D = PL and : \\\\operatorname{rank}(\\\\widehat D) \\\\leq r \\\\quad\\\\iff\\\\quad \\\\text{there is full row rank } R\\\\in\\\\R^{m - r\\\\times m} \\\\text{ such that } R \\\\widehat D = 0 the weighted low-rank approximation problem becomes equivalent to the parameter optimization problems : \\\\text{minimize} \\\\quad \\\\text{over } \\\\widehat D, P \\\\text{ and } L \\\\quad \\\\operatorname{vec}^{\\\\top}(D - \\\\widehat D) W \\\\operatorname{vec}(D - \\\\widehat D) \\\\quad\\\\text{subject to}\\\\quad \\\\widehat D = PL and : \\\\text{minimize} \\\\quad \\\\text{over } \\\\widehat D \\\\text{ and } R \\\\quad \\\\operatorname{vec}^{\\\\top}(D - \\\\widehat D) W \\\\operatorname{vec}(D - \\\\widehat D) \\\\quad\\\\text{subject to}\\\\quad R \\\\widehat D = 0 \\\\quad\\\\text{and}\\\\quad RR^{\\\\top} = I_r, where I_r is the identity matrix of size r.  Alternating projections algorithm  The image representation of the rank constraint suggests a parameter optimization method in which the cost function is minimized alternatively over one of the variables (P or L) with the other one fixed. Although simultaneous minimization over both P and L is a difficult biconvex optimization problem, minimization over one of the variables alone is a linear least squares problem and can be solved globally and efficiently. The resulting optimization algorithm (called alternating projections) is globally convergent with a linear convergence rate to a locally optimal solution of the weighted low-rank approximation problem. Starting value for the P (or L) parameter should be given. The iteration is stopped when a user defined convergence condition is satisfied. Matlab implementation of the alternating projections algorithm for weighted low-rank approximation: function [dh, f] = wlra_ap(d, w, p, tol, maxiter) [m, n] = size(d); r = size(p, 2); f = inf; for i = 2:maxiter % minimization over L bp = kron(eye(n), p); vl = (bp' * w * bp) \\\\ bp' * w * d(:); l = reshape(vl, r, n); % minimization over P bl = kron(l', eye(m)); vp = (bl' * w * bl) \\\\ bl' * w * d(:); p = reshape(vp, m, r); % check exit condition dh = p * l; dd = d - dh; f(i) = dd(:)' * w * dd(:); if abs(f(i - 1) - f(i)) < tol, break, end end  Variable projections algorithm  The alternating projections algorithm exploits the fact that the low rank approximation problem, parameterized in the image form, is bilinear in the variables P or L. The bilinear nature of the problem is effectively used in an alternative approach, called variable projections.G. Golub and V. Pereyra, Separable nonlinear least squares: the variable projection method and its applications, Institute of Physics, Inverse Problems, Volume 19, 2003, Pages 1-26. Consider again the weighted low rank approximation problem, parameterized in the image form. Minimization with respect to the L variable (a linear least squares problem) leads to the closed form expression of the approximation error as a function of P : f(P) = \\\\sqrt{\\\\operatorname{vec}^{\\\\top}(D)\\\\Big( W - W (I_n \\\\otimes P) \\\\big( (I_n \\\\otimes P)^{\\\\top} W (I_n \\\\otimes P) \\\\big)^{-1} (I_n \\\\otimes P)^{\\\\top} W \\\\Big) \\\\operatorname{vec}(D)}. The original problem is therefore equivalent to the nonlinear least squares problem of minimizing f(P) with respect to P. For this purpose standard optimization methods, e.g. the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm can be used. Matlab implementation of the variable projections algorithm for weighted low-rank approximation: function [dh, f] = wlra_varpro(d, w, p, tol, maxiter) prob = optimset(); prob.solver = 'lsqnonlin'; prob.options = optimset('MaxIter', maxiter, 'TolFun', tol); prob.x0 = p; prob.objective = @(p) cost_fun(p, d, w); [p, f ] = lsqnonlin(prob); [f, vl] = cost_fun(p, d, w); dh = p * reshape(vl, size(p, 2), size(d, 2)); function [f, vl] = cost_fun(p, d, w) bp = kron(eye(size(d, 2)), p); vl = (bp' * w * bp) \\\\ bp' * w * d(:); f = d(:)' * w * (d(:) - bp * vl); The variable projections approach can be applied also to low rank approximation problems parameterized in the kernel form. The method is effective when the number of eliminated variables is much larger than the number of optimization variables left at the stage of the nonlinear least squares minimization. Such problems occur in system identification, parameterized in the kernel form, where the eliminated variables are the approximating trajectory and the remaining variables are the model parameters. In the context of linear time-invariant systems, the elimination step is equivalent to Kalman smoothing. A Variant: convex- restricted low rank approximation Usually, we want our new solution not only to be of low rank, but also satisfy other convex constraints due to application requirements. Our interested problem would be as follows, : \\\\text{minimize} \\\\quad \\\\text{over } \\\\widehat p \\\\quad \\\\|p - \\\\widehat p\\\\\\\\quad\\\\text{subject to}\\\\quad \\\\operatorname{rank}\\\\big(\\\\mathcal{S}(\\\\widehat p)\\\\big) \\\\leq r \\\\text{ and } g(\\\\widehat p) \\\\leq 0 This problem has many real world applications, including to recover a good solution from an inexact (semidefinite programming) relaxation. If additional constraint g(\\\\widehat p) \\\\leq 0 is linear, like we require all elements to be nonnegative, the problem is called structured low rank approximation. The more general form is named convex-restricted low rank approximation. This problem is helpful in solving many problems. However, it is challenging due to the combination of the convex and nonconvex (low-rank) constraints. Different techniques were developed based on different realizations of g(\\\\widehat p) \\\\leq 0. However, the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) can be applied to solve the nonconvex problem with convex objective function, rank constraints and other convex constraints, and is thus suitable to solve our above problem. Moreover, unlike the general nonconvex problems, ADMM will guarantee to converge a feasible solution as long as its dual variable converges in the iterations  See also * CUR matrix approximation is made from the rows and columns of the original matrix References * M.

Published by Taylor and Francis. History The tramway replaced the horse tram service previously provided by the Lincoln Tramways Company. The assets of this company were purchased by the Lincoln Corporation in July 1904 for the sum of ¬£10,488The Tramways of the City of Lincoln, D. H. Yarnell, Tramway Review, Vol.8, No.64, Winter 1970 (). It was a single route from Bracebridge, along Newark Road and High Street to Cornhill. The depot was on the corner of Newark Road and Ellison Street at . The depot building survives to this day. Eight Tramcars were purchased from the Brush Electric Company of Loughborough. The company livery was pale green and cream. After trial running which started on 29 October 1905, the tramway opened for public service on 23 November 1905. A council report mentions that 40,000 passengers were carried during the first eleven days. The journey time was fifteen minutes, and this allowed a two- minute turnround. This made reasonable allowance for delays at the two level crossings. Typically, a minimum of three cars provided a scheduled ten-minute service, but at busy periods all eleven cars could be in service at the same time, and this offered a car every three minutes. Griffiths-Bedell stud system The tramway was one of very few in England operated with a Griffiths- Bedell Stud contact system in the roadway. This initial method of power provision survived until 1919 when this was replaced with overhead wires.The Golden Age of Tramways, Taylor & Francis The reason for the replacement was that gas leaked from the mains which found its way into the electric power cable conduit. This appeared in a startling and dangerous manner, as the gas ignited by the arcing of the magnetic switches, with the result that the cast iron covers for the inspection boxes were blown off, and on more than one occasion, hurled into the air. To minimise the risk of explosion, and electric blower was installed at the Depot, and was started up every morning before the first car left the Depot, and this blew a current of air through the conduit, clearing it of any gas. The other main problem with the stud system, was the requirement to have a large magnetic contact under the tramcar to activate the studs. These magnetic contacts would collect any metal based debris (horse shoes etc.) left on the road surface. This occasionally caused a dead short, actuating the circuit breakers at the Brayford Power station, and bringing all cars to a halt. By 1919, the Corporation decided to replace the stud system with overhead wires. Accidents and incidents The Electricity and Tramways Committee of the Corporation reported on 6 June 1908 that there had been an explosion and claim for compensation for injuries received by Mrs. Blatherwick.Lincoln Corporation, Electricity and Tramways Committee Minutes, 6 June 1908 In 1913 a collision occurred between two cars and claims for injuries were deposited on behalf of four passengers. Closure The system was closed on 31 December 1929. References External links * Lincoln Corporation Tramways at the British Tramway Company Badges and Buttons website.

In a career that lasted from October 1854 to September 1855 he ran four times and won three races including The Derby. He was an unusual Derby winner, as neither his owner nor his trainer had any previous experience of Thoroughbred racing. Wild Dayrell was retired to stud at the end of his three-year-old season, and had some success as a stallion, siring several good winners. Background Wild Dayrell was bred at Littlecote House and returned there as a stallion Wild Dayrell was a big, powerful brown horse standing 16.1 hands high and described as \\"one of the finest specimens of a racehorse\\" ever seen. He was bred Francis Leyborne Popham of Littlecote House, near the village of Chilton Foliat in Wiltshire although much of the credit could be given to Popham's \\"hunting groom\\", John Rickaby, who became the colt's trainer. Rickaby, acting on Popham's behalf, bought the mare Ellen Middleton for 50 guineas and arranged her mating with the stallion Ion, the Derby runner-up of 1838 and a male-line descendant of the Byerley Turk. Popham had no previous experience of breeding Thoroughbreds and Rickaby, as his job title suggests, had been mainly employed in supervising the care of his employer's hunters. During Wild Dayrell's racing career the horse was disparagingly described as being \\"trained by a gardner\\". Wild Dayrell was foaled in April 1852. Shortly after his birth he was moved to a warmer stable in a wheel-barrow by Popham's butler, who reportedly claimed that he was \\"wheeling the winner of the Derby\\". The colt was named after a local legend about one of Popham's ancestors, who had murdered an illegitimate baby by throwing it on a fire and whose ghost was alleged to haunt Littlecote.Diana Norman, Tom Corbett's Stately Ghosts of England, Taplinger Publishing Company, New York 1970 Popham initially decided not to keep the colt for racing and offered him for sale as a yearling. He was bought by the trainer John Kent on behalf of Lord Henry Lennox, the son of the Duke of Richmond and entered training with Kent at Goodwood. The sale price was 100 guineas, with an extra 500 guineas to be paid if the colt won the Derby. Racing career 1854: two-year-old season Wild Dayrell was very backward and immature in the early part of his two-year-old season, and showed very little ability in his training gallops at Goodwood. The colt was therefore put up for sale again and was bought back by Popham for 250 guineas and returned to Littlecote, where Rickaby took over his training. Popham then sold a share in Wild Dayrell to Lord Craven and the colt's training base was moved to Craven's estate at Ashdown Park. As his owners had no other racehorses, Rickaby trained Wild Dayrell at Ashdown by galloping him against various hacks and hunters. In autumn, it was decided that Wild Dayrell was ready for a racecourse test and he was sent to Newmarket for the \\"First October\\" meeting. On 27 September he ran in a three-horse Sweepstakes and won very easily, beating Para and Hazel by two lengths and impressing observers to the extent that he became regarded as a contender for the following year's Derby. 1855: three-year-old season Wild Dayrell was trained at Ashdown, Oxfordshire Early in 1855, Popham and Craven reportedly turned down an offer of ¬£3,000 for Wild Dayrell from Baron Meyer de Rothschild. In the spring, his owners decided that Wild Dayrell needed more challenging tests in training and bought a succession of increasingly able thoroughbreds against which to gallop him. The process culminated in a trial race ten days before the Derby in which Wild Dayrell, ridden by the professional jockey Robert Sherwood, conceded twenty-one pounds to three rivals including a top class colt named Jack Shepherd and won easily. Reports of the supposedly private trial became public and Wild Dayrell's status as a leading Derby contender was confirmed. Wild Dayrell's position at the head of the Derby betting made him the target of unscrupulous gamblers and bookmakers who stood to lose money if he won at Epsom and Popham responded by sacking a member of staff who had been behaving suspiciously and putting the horse under twenty-four-hour guard. The plots continued: the horse-box which was hired to take the colt to Epsom was sabotaged, and collapsed when Popham had it tested it with a bullock. Finally a bribe of ¬£5,000 was offered to Wild Dayrell's owners to withdraw him from the race. Popham rejected the bribe and the horse was sent to Epsom. At Epsom on 27 May Wild Dayrell started the even money favourite against eleven rivals, with his main rival expected to be the 2000 Guineas winner Lord of the Isles who started second favourite at 7/4. The weather was fine but the mood of the crowd was less festive than usual, a fact possibly explained by progress of the Crimean War. Ridden by Sherwood, he tracked the leader Kingstown before making his challenge just over a furlong from the finish. He moved quickly into the lead and won easily by a length from Kingstown, with Lord of the Isles finishing third. A great deal of money was won on the race, with Lord Craven taking ¬£10,000 in winning bets. The jockey Jack Charlton, who had ridden Jack Shepherd in the \\"private\\" trial was also reported to be among the winners, clearing ¬£1,000 The ground at Epsom was unusually firm and Wild Dayrell returned from the race lame in his left foreleg. Wild Dayrell's lameness caused him to be withdrawn from his planned run in the Goodwood Cup. He next appeared at York in August where he won the \\"Ebor St Leger\\" in impressive style from a highly valued colt named Oulston. Wild Dayrell had not been entered in the St Leger at Doncaster Racecourse and was instead aimed at the Doncaster Cup over two and a half miles. He started odds-on favourite for the race despite carrying a seven-pound weight penalty for winning the Derby and appearing for the race with his legs heavily bandaged. As feared, his leg problems resurfaced in the race and he was pulled up lame, failing to finish the course behind Rataplan. It proved to be his first and only defeat as he was retired to stud shortly afterwards. Assessment and honours Wild Dayrell was a difficult horse to assess, as he was never extended in any of his victories and was injured in his only defeat: one writer, reporting on his death commented that, \\"there is no saying how good as a rachehorse he really was\\". R. H. Copperthwaite, in his book \\"The Turf and the Racehorse\\", offered the opinion that Wild Dayrell won the Derby with at least twenty pounds in hand. Wild Dayrell's name seems to have been popular with owners of boats and ships. A Confederate blockade runner named the \\"Wild Dayrell\\" was destroyed by Admiral Samuel Phillips Lee off Wilmington, North Carolina in 1864 and at least two other registered vessels bore the name, one of them a famous Opium clipper. Stud career Wild Dayrell stood as a stallion at Littlecote at an initial fee of 30 guineas. He became a reasonably successful sire, getting many winners and two particularly notable horses. His daughter Hurricane won the 1000 Guineas in 1862, and later foaled the 1874 2000 Guineas winner Atlantic. His best son was Buccaneer, a good racehorse who became an excellent stallion. Buccaner was British Champion sire in 1868 and 1869 where his offspring included the multiple Classic winner Formosa. He was later exported to Hungary, where he sired the Derby winner Kisber. Wild Dayrell died in his stall at Littlecote in November 1879.

Prata. It portrays the events surrounding the Siege of Malta in the 16th century, at that time held by the Knights Hospitaller and by Suleiman the Magnificent. Although some of the characters (most notably Knight Commander Jean Parisot de Valette and Suleiman himself) are factual, most of the rest of the knights and Moors are fictional. Overview The novel Angels in Iron is based on a true story about the Siege of Malta which took place in 1565. Nicholas C. Prata poignantly portrays the unparalleled heroism displayed by the Hospitallers during the true events of the battle. In 1523, the Turks overpower Rhodes. The vanquished, known as the Knights of the St. John and as the Hospitallers, flee the island. If given the command, a dashing young knight named Jean Parisot de Valette would have stood the onslaught and defended the island. After 42 years, the Turkish army of Suleiman strikes again and the Hospitallers face the same crisis at the besieged fortress at Malta, a war against Christendom. The circumstances, however, are different this time as assisted by his fellow knights, de Valette bravely puts up a fierce fight against the invading Turks. Along with his compatriots he sacrifices his life to defend the Cross from the Koran, a bitter battle between faith and despair. Critical reviews * \\"Angels in Iron is compellingly written and surprisingly difficult to put down....The characters are well developed and the pace of the novel is brisk. The short chapters are like potato chips...you can't stop after just a few and you keep going back for more. A fascinating read for adults and teens....\\" ‚Äî The St. Linus Review * \\"After reading this inspiring work, one is drawn to the inescapable conclusion that, above all, it was the knight‚Äôs abnegation for the Faith that led to victory....The story is engaging and inspiring. Not only will its non-stop action keep you on the edge of your seat, but it exemplifies the virtue of abnegation, so necessary for faithful Catholics in these trying times.\\" ‚Äî Michael Whitcraft for The American Society for the Defense of Tradition, Family, and Property * \\"Prata caught my interest immediately with his outstanding depiction of the Siege of Malta. He fully captures the reality of the situation and has no problems with portraying the bravery, sacrifice, loss, anguish, and frustration of both sides....Real history told in an entertaining fashion. I couldn't put it down.\\" ‚ÄîNth Degree: The Fiction and Fandom 'Zine.

The New England Female Medical College had been established two years earlier in 1848. Originally called the Female Medical College of Pennsylvania, the college changed its name in 1867 to Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania. The associated Woman's Hospital of Philadelphia was founded in 1861. Upon deciding to admit men in 1970, the college was renamed as the Medical College of Pennsylvania (MCP). In 1930, the college opened its new campus in East Falls, which combined teaching and the clinical care of a hospital in one overall facility. It was the first purpose- built hospital in the nation. In 1993, the college and hospital merged with Hahnemann Medical School. In 2003, the two colleges were absorbed by the Drexel University College of Medicine.  Founding  R.C. Smedley's History of the Underground Railroad cites Dr. Bartholomew Fussell with proposing, in 1846, the idea for a college that would train female doctors. It was a tribute to his departed sister, who Bartholomew believed could have been a doctor if women had been given the opportunity at that time. Her daughter, Graceanna Lewis, was to become one of the first woman scientists in the United States. At a meeting at his house, The Pines, in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania, Fussell invited five doctors to carry out his idea. The doctors invited were: Edwin Fussell (Bartholomew's nephew) M.D., Franklin Taylor, M.D., Ellwood Harvey, M.D., Sylvester Birdsall, M.D., and Dr. Ezra Michener. Graceanna also attended. Dr. Fussell would support the college, but had little to do with it after it started in 1850 in Philadelphia. Ellwood Harvey (who attended the 1846 meeting, but did not start teaching at the college until 1852), helped keep the school alive, along with Edwin Fussell. Dr. Harvey not only taught a full course load but took on a second load when another professor backed out. Dr. Harvey also continued his medical practice. Among his patients were William Still and his family. Still, a renowned Philadelphia abolitionist, became a historian of the Underground Railroad after keeping extensive records of fugitive slaves aided in Philadelphia rescues. Harvey was later sued for libel by Dr. Joseph S. Longshore, an instructor at the college who was forced out. Longshore started a rival women's medical college at the Penn Medical University. Using his previous connections from the Female Medical College, Longshore began to raise money for his own college. Clara Marshall (1847‚Äì1931) graduated from the college. She served as dean from 1888 to 1917 and thought of Edwin Fussell as the founder of the school. Other students credited Longshore and William J. Mullen as being primary founders in terms of their contributions. Most considered these three men, whether official founder or not, to be instrumental in the creation of the Female Medical College of Pennsylvania. The Feminist Movement during the early to mid 19th century generated support for the Female Medical College of Pennsylvania. The Society of Friends in Philadelphia, a large group of Quakers, were supportive of the women's rights movements and the development of the Female MCP. MCP was initially located in the rear of 229 Arch Street, Philadelphia (the address was later changed to 627 Arch Street when Philadelphia renumbered streets in 1858). In July 1861, the board of corporators of the Female Medical College of Pennsylvania chose to rent rooms for the college from the Woman's Hospital of Philadelphia on North College Avenue. Deans of the College The first dean of what was then known as the Female Medical College was a man: Nathaniel R. Mosely, appointed 1850‚Äì1856. The second dean was also a man, Edwin B. Fussell, who held the position from 1856 to 1866. From then on, the Woman's College had a long history of female deans, lasting almost 100 years. The first woman to be a dean of this (or any) medical school was Ann Preston. The following women were deans of the college in the years stated: * 1866‚Äì1872, Ann Preston * 1872‚Äì1874, Emeline Horton Cleveland * 1874‚Äì1886, Rachel Bodley * 1886/1888‚Äì1917, Clara Marshall * 1917‚Äì1940, Martha Tracy (Henry Jump served as interim dean during Tracy's sabbatical.) * 1940/1943‚Äì1943/1946, Margaret Craighill * 1946‚Äì1963, Marion Spencer Fay No woman was found to replace Marion Fay. After her, the position of dean was held by Glen R. Leymaster from 1964 to 1970, at which time the institution became known as the Medical College of Pennsylvania.  Woman's Hospital of Philadelphia  In part to provide clinical experience for WMC students, a group of Quaker women, particularly Ann Preston, founded the Woman's Hospital of Philadelphia in 1861. In 1929, the West Philadelphia Hospital for Women merged with the Woman's Hospital of Philadelphia, retaining the latter's name.  Issues in clinical training  The Female Medical College of Pennsylvania faced difficulties in providing clinical training for its students.Peitzman (2000), A New and Untried Course, p. 78 Almost all medical institutions were confronted with the demand for more clinical practice due to the rise of surgery, physical diagnosis, and clinical specialties.Edward Atwater, \\"'Making Fewer Mistakes': A History of Students and Patients,\\" pp. 165-187, Bulletin of the History of Medicine 57, 1983 During the 1880s, clinical instruction at the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania relied mainly on the demonstration clinics. In 1887, Anna Broomall, professor of obstetrics for the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania, established a maternity outpatient service in a poor area of South Philadelphia for the purpose of student education. By 1895, many students cared for three or four women who were giving birth.Peitzman (2000), A New and Untried Course, p. 79  East Falls campus and Drexel University  In the late 1920s, the college raised money to build a new campus. Designed by Ritter & Shay, the most successful of the Philadelphia urban architecture firms in the 1920s, the East Falls Campus was the first purpose-built hospital in the nation. The design allowed both teaching and hospital care to take place in one facility, helping provide for more clinical care. Post-WWII housing shortages in the city were a catalyst for development of additions to the East Falls Campus, the first of which was the Ann Preston Building (designed by Thaddeus Longstreth), which provided housing and classrooms for student nurses. Falls Center Front of the Falls Center Today, the building is known as the Falls Center. It is operated by Iron Stone Strategic Capital Partners as student housing, commercial space, and medical offices. In 1993 the Medical College of Pennsylvania merged with Hahnemann Medical College, retaining its Queen Lane campus. In 2003, the two medical colleges were absorbed as a part of Drexel University College of Medicine, creating new opportunities for the large student body for clinical practice in settings ranging from urban hospitals to small rural practices.

The 19th-century Germans who settled the Texas Hill Country used part of the Pinta Trail on their journey northward from New Braunfels to found Fredericksburg. A historic battle between a Texas Rangers patrol and a band of Comanches is often said to have occurred near a ford where the Pinta Trail crossed the Guadalupe River. Route The Pinta Trail began in San Antonio and proceeded through the Texas Hill Country, crossing the Guadalupe River near Sisterdale and fording the Pedernales River east of Fredericksburg. From there its route is not certain, but it appears to have continued north to the Llano River along a route shown on an 1847 survey map drawn by James P. Hudson. Historic maps and original Texas land surveys establish that north of San Antonio the trail traversed the Balcones Escarpment through a canyon that is now the route of the Northwest Military Highway. From there, the trail passed Comanche Spring before crossing Cibolo Creek at Post Oak Creek, below Balcones Creek. The trail proceeded northwest to the Guadalaupe River near Sisterdale, crossing Spring Creek, Sabinas Creek, and Wasp Creek on the way. After fording the Guadalupe, the trail followed West Sister Creek to Jung Creek, then followed that stream to its headwaters before crowning a ridge and dropping into the Grape Creek drainage, then fording the Pedernales River about 4.5 miles east of today‚Äôs downtown Fredericksburg. History The Pinta Trail makes its first appearance in the journals of Nicol√°s Lafora and the Marqu√©s de Rub√≠ chronicling a 1767 inspection of Spanish frontier presidios. Leaving the Presidio San Saba, their expedition followed the San Saba Road (which was to the west of the Pinta Trail and was known to German immigrants as the Camino Viejo) until the road reached the Guadalupe River. There, they followed the river until they came to the Pinta Trail ford near today‚Äôs Sisterdale, where they picked up the Pinta Trail and followed it to San Antonio. Neither Lafora nor Rub√≠ (nor any other Spanish writer) gave a name to the trail, but geographical landmarks mentioned in Lafora‚Äôs journal mark the route clearly. In April 1846, German settlers under the auspices of the Adelsverein colonization company ventured west from their initial townsite at New Braunfels and picked up the Pinta Trail north of San Antonio, following it to found their next frontier settlement at Fredericksburg. The trail was used by Ferdinand Roemer in January 1847, Lieutenant Francis T. Bryan in June 1849, and John Russell Bartlett in October 1850, all on journeys passing through Fredericksburg. In 1854, Frederick Law Olmsted observed that the lower extent of the trail was overgrown and disused, having been abandoned in favor of a new road that passed through Boerne on the way to Fredericksburg via Welfare, with a branch offering an alternate route through Sisterdale. In June 1844, a squad of Texas Rangers led by the legendary Captain Jack Hays fought a band of Comanche warriors led by Yellow Wolf in an engagement known as the Battle of Walker‚Äôs Creek. The fight is famous for the rangers‚Äô use of the new Colt Paterson 5-shot revolver. One participant in the battle places it at the Pinta Trail ford of the Guadalupe River; another places it about four miles east. Hays‚Äôs own report does not mention the Pinta Trail, even though he surveyed the trail at the ford five years earlier. The Pinta Trail above Sisterdale remained at least partly in use until 1879, but soon thereafter its upper reaches were eclipsed by a road passing through Luckenbach on the way to Fredericksburg. Modern roads The only sections of the Pinta Trail that are resembled by modern roads are a short stretch of San Antonio‚Äôs Northwest Military Highway through the Balcones Escarpment and, 30 miles further north, two miles of Texas Farm-to-Market Road 1376 above the Guadalupe River. Most of the old trail is on land that is not open to the public. Misconceptions Though some legends state that the trail connected San Antonio to the abandoned Spanish Presidio San Sab√°, there is no historical evidence to support that assertion; those legends, along with other accounts that have the trail passing through Boerne, Comfort, or Menard, confuse the trail with the San Saba Road, the Fredericksburg Road (a variation and extension of the San Saba Road) or other routes. Accounts that have the trail passing through Cain City, Fredericksburg, Luckenbach, or Mason confuse the trail with roads that emerged later. The Pinta Trail did not become the Emigrant Road to California or the Military Road to U.S. Army forts on that route; those roads were established after Fredericksburg was founded.

Her first novel, A Time Outworn, was released to critical acclaim in Ireland in 1952. She continued to publish up to her death, notably a series of novels and short stories in the 1970s and 1980s. She also worked as a journalist and columnist and was often heard on the radio. Early life Mulkerns was born in Dublin in 1925 to James Mulkerns and Esther O'Neill. She was educated at the Dominican school at Eccles Street, and grew up in an artistic family, her father being a Dublin strolling player and writer of satirical verse. After a stint in the Irish Civil Service, she moved to England, where she worked as a teacher. Hiking around Connemara on holiday in 1951, she met, by chance, the novelist Kate O'Brien. The experience encouraged Val to return to Ireland. After moving back to Ireland, she began to write, and worked as an associate editor and theatre critic of The Bell, a famed Irish literary review founded by Se√°n √ì Faol√°in and Peadar O'Donnell. Works Her two early novels were A Time Outworn (1951), and A Peacock Cry (1954). While taking time off from her fiction career to raise a family in the decade that followed, she was a well-known journalist and columnist with the Irish national newspaper the Evening Press from 1963 to 1983. In 1978 she wrote Antiquities (Andr√© Deutsch), the first of three acclaimed collections of short stories. The others were An Idle Woman (Poolbeg, 1980), and A Friend of Don Juan (John Murray, 1988). Two novels followed, The Summerhouse (John Murray, 1984) and Very Like A Whale (John Murray 1986). She has also penned two children's books, which have been translated into German and published by Benziger of Zurich. She was joint winner of the AIB Prize for Literature in 1984, and became the Mayo County Library's first writer-in-residence in 1987‚Äì1988. During this time, she edited an anthology entitled New Writings from the West. She is included in several key Irish literature anthologies, including The Field Day Anthology (Edited by Seamus Deane), and The Penguin Book of Irish Fiction (edited by Colm T√≥ib√≠n). She was also included in The Granta Book of The Irish Short Story edited by Anne Enright. In 2014, a third edition of The Summerhouse was published by Tara Press. A new collection of her short fiction, entitled Memory and Desire, was published in May 2016 by 451 Editions. Her memoir Friends with the Enemy, also published by 451 Editions in December 2017, was her last work. The Irish author Anne Enright, writing in the Irish Times, summed up Mulkerns' thus: It was not easy being a liberalising voice in the Ireland of the day, but Mulkerns wrote like a fighter. Her short stories looked for the angle, and took the shot. Later life She was married to the writer Maurice Kennedy, and edited a posthumous collection of his work, The Way to Vladivostok, in 2000. She was the mother of the journalist Maev Kennedy. She lived outside Dublin, and frequently broadcast on Sunday Miscellany, a programme of writers‚Äô original reflections on RT√â.

Plot Alf‚Äôs son Hughie and his girlfriend Jan plan to document Anzac Day for the university newspaper, focusing on the drinking on Anzac Day. For the first time in his life Hughie refuses to attend the dawn service with Alf. When he watches the march on television at home with his mother and Wacka, he is torn between outrage at the display and love for his father. Characters Alf Cook, Dot Cook, Hughie Cook, Wacka Dawson and Jan Castle. Origins The play was inspired by an article in the University of Sydney newspaper Honi Soit criticising Anzac Day and Seymour's own observations of how ex-servicemen behaved on that day. The character of Alf was based on Seymour's brother in law. Productions The play was rejected by the Adelaide Festival of Arts Board of Governors in 1960, but made its debut on 20 July 1960 as an amateur production by the Adelaide Theatre Group. Jean Marshall, the Director, and those involved in the Adelaide production received death threats. The first professional season was in April 1961 at the Palace Theatre in Sydney. It proved controversial and Seymour also received death threats however it was popular and there have been productions ever since. In 1961 Seymour travelled to London where the play was directed by Raymond Menmuir at the Theatre Royal Stratford East. 1962 Australian television version The play was adapted for Australian TV in June 1962. It was directed by Rod Kinnear and adapted by John Sumner.The One Day of the Year at IMDb Australian TV drama was relatively rare at the time. Cast * Syd Conabere as Alf * Stewart Weller as Wacka * Dennis Miller as Hughie * Elaine Cusack as Jan Castle * Bunney Brooke as Dot Cook Production The production was produced by GTV-9 in Melbourne after a 16 week run of the show in which 28,000 people saw the show. It was estimated 300,000 would see the television production. Some of the language from the original play was cut. It was the first of three plays of The General Motors Hour that year. The cast were all members of the Melbourne Union Theatre Repertory Company, which originally presented the play in Melbourne and toured three states. Reception The TV critic for the Sydney Morning Herald said the shortened adaptation \\"suffered much less than might have been expected in its transfer\\" to television, saying it \\"sometimes tended to focus more sharply the growing and bitter awareness of the increasing estrangement between an ill-educated, soured lift-driver and his university student son. On' the other hand, some scenes of richly meaningful theatrical impact missed badly.\\" The TV critic for The Age said the \\"subject of this play overshadow the acting and the sets, giving the production a sleek look that it did not entirely merit.\\" The Bulletin called it \\"awful\\". Awards The TV movie won Best Drama and Best Actor (for Syd Conabere) at the Logie Awards of 1963.Logie Awards History 1962 British television version The play was adapted for British TV in 1962 and produced by James Ormerod.

The journal was established as a scholarly but not fully peer-reviewed publication in 1996 by Fritz Muntean and Diana Tracy with the subtitle A New Journal of Neopagan Thought. In 2001 the production of the journal was put on hiatus, as Muntean stepped down as editor, to be replaced by Clifton when it resumed publication, this time as a fully peer-reviewed academic publication and with its current subtitle.  History  The front cover to The Pomegranate: A New Journal of Neopagan Studies (issue 17 portrayed). The idea for The Pomegranate was initially developed by Fritz Muntean, a graduate student in religious studies at the University of British Columbia in Canada, who started the venture with his friend Diana Tracy, who was then living in Oregon in the United States.Clifton 2004. p. 5. Initially naming their work The Pomegranate: A New Journal of Neopagan Thought, the stated intention of the publication was to \\"provide a scholarly venue for the forthright and critical examination of Neopagan beliefs and practices\\". From 1996 to 2001, Muntean published 18 issues of The Pomegranate on a quarterly basis, gaining a growing readership as time went on, particularly after Muntean and Tracy introduced the journal to the assembled members at the third Nature Religions Scholars Network (NRSN), a group which met in conjunction with the annual San Francisco meeting of the American Academy of Religion. Muntean eventually decided to move on from his work as editor of The Pomegranate, leaving that position to be occupied by Clifton. Together, Muntean and Clifton searched for a new publisher, in 2003 eventually signing an agreement with Equinox Publishing. Under Clifton's control, the journal's subtitle was changed to The International Journal of Pagan Studies and it adopted a peer review structure for the papers which it published.Clifton 2004. p. 6.

The Japanese school classes remained on the Rosemary Hall campus; the Hebrew school leased several buildings on the campus to the Japanese school for up to eight years. The classes of each school are held in separate buildings, while both schools share the fieldstone gymnasium. In 2005 an arson incident occurred on the school campus. An office building was destroyed as a result of the arson.Borsuk, Ken. \\"At Greenwich Japanese School Arson destroys building.\\" Greenwich Post. February 24, 2005. 1A, continued on 10A.

Aspects of the Japanese curriculum offered at the school include art, English, Japanese, music, physical education, and social studies. In addition to the Japanese curriculum, students also take American social studies and extra English lessons. The total amount of English instruction per week per student, as of 1988, was five hours per week, while each student took one hour of American social studies instruction per week. The school does not have electives. As of 1987 it offers a \\"morals\\" class which teaches children how to work in groups and following the mores of Japanese society. As of 2002, with the exception of English, all classes are taught in the Japanese language. In 1987 Torao Endo, the principal, said that in this school students are encouraged to volunteer their own answers to questions and to directly say what they think, in keeping with American culture; Endo said that such behaviors are discouraged in Japanese schools. In 1986 the school had 16 American teachers; these teachers give English and American social studies classes. As of 1986 the school arranges one day exchanges with local American schools so that the students attending The Japanese School of New York do not become too isolated from the United States. As of 1988 the school was certified by the New York state government, so graduates are eligible to attend American high schools. Student body the students attending the school tended to be the children of bankers, businesspeople, and diplomats. over 30% of parents of Japanese mandatory school age children in the New York City area sent their children to the Japanese day school instead of using a combination of the local American schools and the Japanese Weekend School of New York; parents who chose to send their children to the JSNY wanted to raise them as mainstream Japanese people as opposed to being more influenced by foreign cultures. As of the 1980s, students who graduated from the school typically went back to Japan to enter high schools and universities in Japan. Since parents placed greater expectations on male children to do well on examinations, compared to girls, more boys are enrolled at the school than girls. Japanese society had the concept that boys would take jobs in large, stable companies, and that girls would become educated, but would primarily become housewives. When the school was first established, most of the students lived in Queens, and some commuted from New Jersey and Westchester County. As of 1983 students came from New York City and from suburbs of New York City. In 1983 the school had 325 boys and 125 girls. In 1986 students came from all five New York City boroughs, Long Island, New Jersey, and Westchester County. In 2002 about 75% of its students consisted of families living in Westchester County, New York. In 1975 the school had 152 students and covered grades four through six.\\"School Helps Japanese.\\" Associated Press at the Reading Eagle. Sunday December 28, 1975. 76. Retrieved from Google News (77 of 141) on January 9, 2012. In 1983 the school had 450 students. In 1986 it had 482 students. In 1987 it had about 460 students, and covered grades five through nine. As of 1988 the school enrollment was capped, with 560 students being the highest allowable number. In 1992 the school had 417 students. In 2001 it had 314 students. In 2002 it had 253 students. The enrollment declined because of a decreasing Japanese corporate presence in the New York City area due to the stagnation of the Japanese economy. In 2005 it had 240 students in grades one through nine. Student discipline In 1983 Suzanne Paluszek, an American national who taught English at the school, said that students at the school were better behaved than students at American schools. As of 1987 the school does not have a dress code, in keeping with the practices of most American schools. Tuition and funding As of 1988 tuition and other private sector sources funded about 40% of the school's expenditures while the Japanese public sector provided the remaining 60%. In 1983 the tuition was $300 ($ according to inflation) per month, and bus transportation was included. In 1987 the tuition ranged from $1,910 ($ when adjusted for inflation) to $2,280 ($ when adjusted for inflation) per year.Kleiman, Dena. \\"Japanese Power Soars in New York.\\" The New York Times. June 9, 1987. 2. Retrieved on January 10, 2012. In 1994 for elementary students the yearly tuition was $3,384 ($ adjusted for inflation) while for junior high students it was $3,816 ($ adjusted for inflation). In 2002 the tuition was $7,000 ($ adjusted for inflation) per year per student. Weekend schools about 1,300 students of Greenwich Public Schools attend Saturday classes at the Japanese School of New York. In 1983 the school held weekend schools in several locations. Most classes are held in public school facilities, and as of 1983 classes operate for two hour periods on Saturdays. In 1983 the majority of Japanese national students within Greater New York City attended U.S. schools. To have education in the Japanese language and Japanese literature, they attend the weekend classes offered by the Japanese School of New York. Extra-curricular activities As of 1986 the school holds an annual fair. When it moved to a new location in Queens in 1980, it held a fair to introduce Japanese culture to Americans living in the area. The fair was so popular that the school continued holding it.

Mariken van Nieumeghen is a Middle Dutch text from the early 16th century. The protagonist of the play spends seven years with the devil, after which she is miraculously released. The oldest edition dates from 1515 and was printed by Willem Vorsterman.Coigneau 7. Linguistic evidence suggests it was written by a poet from an Antwerp chamber of rhetoric. Themes and genre Like the fourteenth-century Beatrijs, the story involves a beautiful young woman who is seduced, but unlike that poem Mariken has a lively, \\"Burgundian\\" style in often lower-class language, as opposed to the courtly elegance of the Beatrijs.Coigneau 8-9. Though the story is often called a miracle play, Dirk Coigneau, in his 2002 edition, argues that the story was not intended as a drama; he likens its organization (the text is separated into sections where verse dialogues are preceded by prose introductions) to that of a prose novel.Coigneau 10-11. History The earliest known version, printed in 1515 in Antwerp (found in the Bavarian State Library, Munich) is designated A. The story was popular enough to become widespread very quickly. An English translation was printed by Antwerp printer , as of... Mary of Nemmegen in the early-sixteenth century--this manuscript is usually designated D.Coigneau 9-10. The actual origins of the story are not well known, though in 2009 Dirk Coigneau proposed that it may originate in Syria, claiming as evidence a sixth-century novella about the fourth-century Assyrian Saint Abraham, a text which Coigneau claims shows many similarities with the Mariken. Later translations and adaptations From a 1950 outdoor production A Latin version was included by Hadrianus Lyraeus in his Trisagion Marianum (1648), and ended up in the Italian book Sabati del Gies√π di Roma by P. Joannes Rho (1655), from which it traveled to the Marianischer Gnaden- und Wunderschatz (Augsburg 1737) and finally in Alphonsus Maria de Liguori's Italian Glorie di Maria (1750).Wolthuis 21-51. Luise von Ploennies made a German Faust out of her (1853). Eugen d'Albert wrote an opera in 1923 (libretto by Herbert Alberti), Mareike von Nymwegen, in 1923. The book was translated into German (1918 and 1950), English (1924), French (1929), and Norwegian (1975), and adapted for radio in Afrikaans.Coigneau 9 n.4. The story was popular in the Middle East as well. In 2008, Herman Teule, professor of Eastern Christianity at Radboud University Nijmegen, discovered an 1821 translation in Syrian, which turned out to be a popular translation of an Italian version, distributed by Christian missionaries. The story has been adapted for film twice, in 1974 by Jos Stelling and in 2000 by , the latter based on a Peter van Gestel's adaptation of the story in children's book Mariken.

When defining Utsuro- bune, the bune part means \\"boat\\" while Utsuro means empty, or hollow. Accounts of the tale appear in three texts: Toen sh≈çsetsu (1825), Hy≈çry≈´ kish≈´ (1835) and Ume-no-chiri (1844). According to legend, an attractive young woman aged 18-20 years old, arrived on a local beach aboard the \\"hollow ship\\" on February 22, 1803. Fishermen brought her inland to investigate further, but the woman was unable to communicate in Japanese. She was very different from anyone else there. The fishermen then returned her and her vessel to the sea, where it drifted away. Historians, ethnologists and physicists such as Kazuo Tanaka and Yanagita Kunio have evaluated the \\"legend of the hollow boat\\" as part of a long-standing tradition within Japanese folklore.Kunio Yanagita, Fanny Hagin Mayer, Nihon H≈çs≈ç Ky≈çkai: The Yanagita Kunio guide to the Japanese folk tale. Indiana University Press, Bloomington (IN) 1986, , p. 176‚Äì178. Alternatively, certain ufologists have claimed that the story represents evidence for a close encounter with extraterrestrial life.  Historical sources  The best-known versions of the legend are found in three texts: * , composed in 1825 by Kyokutei Bakin. The manuscript is today on display at the Muky≈´-Kai-Toshokan at Machida (Tokyo prefecture). * , composed during the Edo period in 1835 by an unknown author. It is today on display at the library of the Tenri University at Tenri in the Nara prefecture. * , composed in 1844 by Nagahashi Matajir≈ç. It is today on display at the private library Iwase-Bunko-Toshokan (Â≤©ÁÄ¨ÊñáÂ∫´Âõ≥Êõ∏È§®) at Nara. Description in all three books bear similarity, thus they seem to have the same historical origins. The book Toen sh≈çsetsu contains the most detailed version.  Legend   Toen sh≈çsetsu  On February 22, 1803, local fishers of the shore in the Hitachi province(Â∏∏Èô∏ÂõΩ, today Ibaraki prefecture) saw an ominous \\"ship\\" drifting in the waters. Curious, they towed the vessel back to land, discovering that it was 3.30 metres (10.83 feet) high and 5.45 metres (17.88 feet) wide, reminding the witnesses of a K≈çhako (Japanese incense burner). Its upper part appeared to be made of red coated rosewood, while the lower part was covered with brazen plates, obviously to protect it against the sharp-edged rocks. The upper part had several windows made of glass or crystal, covered with bars and clogged with some kind of tree resin. The shape of the hollow boat resembled a wooden rice pit. The windows were completely transparent and the baffled fishermen looked inside. The inner side of the Utsuro-bune was decorated with texts written in an unknown language. The fishermen found items inside such as two bed sheets, a bottle filled with 3.6 litres of water, some cake and kneaded meat. Then the fishermen saw a beautiful young woman, possibly 18 or 20 years old. Her body size was said to be 1.5 metres (4.92 feet). The woman had red hair and eyebrows, the hair elongated by artificial white extensions. The extensions could have been made of white fur or thin, white-powdered textile streaks. This hairstyle cannot be found in any literature. The skin of the lady was a very pale pink color. She wore precious, long and smooth clothes of unknown fabrics. The woman began speaking, but no one understood her. She did not seem to understand the fishermen either, so no one could ask her about her origin. Although the mysterious woman appeared friendly and courteous, she acted oddly, for she always clutched a quadratic box made of pale material and around 0.6 m (24 in) in size. The woman did not allow anyone to touch the box, no matter how kindly or pressingly the witnesses asked. An old man from the village theorised, \\"This woman could be a princess of a foreign realm, who married at her homeland. But when she had an affair with a townsman after marriage, it caused a scandal and the lover was killed for punishment. The princess was banned from home, for she enjoyed lots of sympathy, so she escaped the death penalty. Instead, she might have been exposed in that Utsuro-bune to leave her to destiny. If this should be correct, the quadratic box may contain the head of the woman's deceased lover. In the past, a very similar object with a woman was washed ashore on a close-by beach. During this incident, a small board with a pinned head was found. The content of the box could therefore be the same, which would certainly explain why she protects it so much. It would cost lots of money and time to investigate the woman and her boat. Since it seems to be tradition to expose those boats at sea, we should bring the woman back to the Utsuro-bune and let her drift away. The townspeople were frightened. In a different version, the lady from the hollow boat stays where she landed and grows to old age. From human sight it might be cruel, but it seems to be her predetermined destiny.\\" The fishermen reassembled the Utsuro-bune, placed the woman in it, and set it to drift away into the ocean.Kazuo Tanaka: Did a close encounter of the Third Kind occur on a Japanese beach in 1803?

It reminded the witnesses of a rice cooking pot, around its middle it had a thickened rim. It was also coated with black paint and it had four little windows on four sides. The windows had bars and they were clogged with tree resin. The lower part of the boat was protected by brazen plates which looked to be made of iron of the highest western quality. The height of the boat was 3.33 m (10.83 ft) and its breadth was 5.41 m (17.75 ft). A woman of 20 years was found in the boat. Her body size was 1.5 m (4.92 ft) and her skin was as white as snow. The long hair dangled smoothly down along her back. Her face was of indescribable beauty. The dress of the woman was of unknown style and no one could recognise it. She spoke an unknown language. She held a small box no one was allowed to touch. Inside the boat two unusually soft carpets of unknown style and fabric were found. There were supplies such as cake, kneaded food and meat. A beautifully decorated cup with ornaments no one could identify was also found.  Similar traditions  There are several further documents about Utsuro-bune sightings in Japan, for example and . The investigation started in 1844, and continued in 1925, and 1962. In 2010 and 2012 two rare ink printings were found and investigated by Kazuo Tanaka. In 1977 they contained stories about Utsuro-bune with very similar content to that of the Hy≈çry≈´ kish≈´, although they claim a different location for the events: (harbour of B≈çsh≈´).Reporting of newly discovered Utsuro-bune stories in the official Ibaraki-Shimbun  Other legends concerning Utsuro-bune  A well known Japanese legend is that of the origin of the K≈çno clan of the Iyo Province.http://yunzu.qee.jp/translations/utsurobune/utsurobune.html In the 7th century, a fisherman named from Gogo island found a 13-year-old girl inside an Utsuro-bune drifting at sea. He brought her to land, where she told him that she was the daughter of the Chinese emperor and that she had been forced to flee to escape her stepmother. The fisherman named her (\\"princess Wake\\") and raised her, before she married an imperial prince of Iyo province and gave birth to a son named , the ancestor of the K≈çno clan. A part of this folktale held that she was responsible for bringing the first silk cocoons to Japan. Princess Wake is still worshiped at the Funakoshi Wakehime Shinto shrinehttp://home.e-catv.ne.jp/naka/mukasi-hanasi/densetu/funakosi- zinnzya/funakosi-zinzya.htm in the village of Funakoshi on Gogo island.Wake- hime shrine at Funakoshi (Go-Go island)Moku J≈çya: Japan And Things Japanese. Japan Times, Tokyo 1958. S. 227 & 228. There are more myths that share many similarities to Utsune-Bune. Toen shosetsu, which translates to \\"rabbit in the garden\\", a book written by Kyokutei Bakin, tells the story of a few castaways marking their journey and end up in the same situation. Another story written by an unknown author Umi-nu-chiri, which translates to \\"dust of the apricot\\" is another story that shares many similarities to Utsuro-Bune.  Interpretations  Ink drawing of the Utsuro-bune by Kyokutei Bakin (1825).  Historical investigations  The first historical investigations of the Utsuro-bune incident were conducted in 1844 by Kyokutei Bakin (1767‚Äì1848). Kyokutei reports about a book called , written by Kanamori Kinken. The book describes traditional Russian clothes and hairstyles and mentions a popular method to dust hair with white powder. It also mentions that many Russian women have natural red hair and that they wear skirts, similar to that of the lady of the legend. Based upon the book, Kyokutei suggests that the woman of the Utsuro-bune incident could have been of Russian origin. He writes that the stories are similar to each other, as they differ only in minor descriptions (for example, one documents says \\"3.6 litres of water\\", another says \\"36 litres of water\\"). He also questions the origin of the alleged exotic symbols found in and on the boat. Because he is convinced that he saw similar signs on a British whaler stranded shortly before his writing, Kyokutei wonders if the woman was a Russian, British or even American princess. Furthermore, he expresses his disappointment about the drawings of the Utsuro-bune, because they obviously do not fully match the witness descriptions.  Modern investigations  Further investigations of the Utsuro-bune incident were done in 1925 and in 1962 by ethnologist and historian Yanagida Kunio. He points out that circular boats were never anything unusual in Japan since early times; only the western-like details, such as the windows made of glass and the brazen protective plates, make the Utsuro-bune look exotic. He also found out that most legends similar to that of the Utsuro-bune sound alike: Someone finds a strange girl or young woman inside a circular boat and rescues the stranded or sends her back to the ocean. Yanagida also points out that the eldest versions of Utsuro-bune describe humble, circular and open log-boats without any dome atop. Yanagida assumes that the details of the brazen plates and windows made of glass or crystal were added because skeptics would question the seaworthiness of a humble log-boat on the high seas. A steel reinforced Utsuro-bune with glass windows would more easily survive travelling on the ocean than an open, unreinforced wooden boat. Dr. Kazuo Tanaka (Áî∞‰∏≠ ÂòâÊ¥•Â§´), Japanese professor for computer and electronics engineering from Gifu University at Tokyo (Êù±‰∫¨), investigated the original scripts in 1997. He considers the popular comparisons of the Utsuro-bune with modern UFO sightings to be far-fetched. He points out that the Utsuro-bune of the legends never flies or moves on its own, nor does it show any signs of extraordinary technologies. It simply drifts motionless on the water. Tanaka concludes that the tale of the Utsuro-bune was a literary mixture of folklore and imaginations. He bases his assumptions on the 1925 investigations of the Japanese historian Yanagida Kunio, who had also studied the tales of the Utsuro-bune. Dr. Tanaka himself found out that the locations \\"Haratono-hama\\" and \\"Harayadori\\" are fictitious. To make the anecdote sound credible, the author designated the beaches as personal acreages of a Daimy≈ç named Ogasawara Nagashige. This daimy≈ç actually lived during the Edo period, but his acreages were placed at heartland and it seems sure that Ogasawara never had any contact with the fishermen of the Pacific coast. The Ogasawara clan served the famous Tokugawa clan, who held power over the most north-eastern part of Japan until 1868 and their main acreages were placed in the Hitashi province, geographically very close to the eastern beaches. Tanaka finds it very odd that no incident of such alleged importance was commented on in the curatorial documents, since strangers leaving the shore had to be reported at once. But the only remarkable incident during the late Tokugawa clan happened in 1824, when a British whaler was stranded at the north-eastern coast of the Hitachi district. Tanaka also found out that, during the rulership of the Tokugawa clan, the Ogasawara family and the Tokugawa started mapping their territories and acreages. And both names of \\"Haratono-hama\\" and \\"Harayadori\\" are missing. They also do not appear on the maps of the first complete mappings of the whole of Japan in 1907. If the name of a village, city or place had changed in history, this would have been noted in some curatorial documents, but it is not. Tanaka thinks it rather unlikely that important places such as \\"Haratono- hama\\" and \\"Harayadori\\" actually could have been forgotten in records. The peculiar European appearance of the woman, the upper part of the Utsuro-bune and the unknown writings lead Tanaka and Yanagida to the conclusion that the whole story was based on the historical circumstance that people of the Edo period totally encapsulated Japan against the outer world. To bedizen a stranded woman with European attributes showed how much the peoples were afraid of bad cultural influences from the western world, especially North America and Great Britain. The story of the Utsuro-bune is significantly constructed in a way that makes the tale sound incredible at one site, but self-explaining at the same time (the woman and her craft are sent away so no one could ever consult her personally). Furthermore, Tanaka and Yanagida point out that the people of Edo period shared great interests in paranormal things such as y≈´rei, onibi, hitodama and y≈çkai, so it would not be surprising to find stories of exotic boats like the Utsuro-bune. In his conclusions, Tanaka points to the difficulty in the correct reading of the place names. In modern transcriptions, the Kanji ÂéüËàé have to be read as Harasha. But in Toen Sh≈çsetsu the signs are written in Kana and they have to be read as Hara-yadori. In Ume no chiri they are written in Furigana making the place to be named as Haratono-hama. Alternatively, the kanji for Haratono could be read as Hara- yadori. According to Tanaka‚Äôs investigations, the transcription of ÂéüËàé„É∂Êµú in the Hy≈çry≈´ Kish≈´ as \\"Harasha-ga-hama\\" is therefore a typo based on a misreading and should originally be read as \\"Haratono-ga-hama\\". Thus, all writings describe the same place. Tanaka also points out that the word Utsuro means \\"empty\\" or \\"abandoned\\" and that the word Utsubo means \\"quiver\\" and describes the bags in which hunters and archers once carried their arrows. But both words also describe old, hollowed tree trunks and branch holes of sacred trees. The word Fune/Bune simply means \\"boat\\". Altogether, the word Utsuro- bune means \\"hollow ship\\". On May 26, 2014, reported Tanaka found Jinichi Kawakami's regarding and place name (as of 2014, ) where coast surveyed in 1801 and on Dai Nihon Enkai Yochi Zenzu (:ja:Â§ßÊó•Êú¨Ê≤øÊµ∑ËºøÂú∞ÂÖ®Âõ≥ maps of Japan's coastal area) by In≈ç Tadataka.  Ufological  In Ufology, the legend of the Utsuro-bune has been described as an early case of a documented close encounter of the third kind based on the similarities between the drawings of the vessel from the Edo period and 20th century descriptions of flying saucers. Some Ufologists suggest the Utsuro-bune could have been an unidentified submarine object (USO). They note the mysterious symbols which were reportedly found on the object that regularly appear as addenda within the depictions. They are suggested by some to be similar to the symbols reported at the Rendlesham Forest Incident in England, which was used by the United States Air force. The same writing is also found in caves. Caves also show many drawings of odd figures along the symbols. UFO proponents further point to the ominous box held by the woman as well as her physical appearance and unusual dress as evidence of an extraterrestrial encounter. The assumptions of any historian and ethnologist about those items are repeatedly ignored.Ry≈´tar≈ç Minakami, Kazuo Shimizu, Sh≈çichi Kamon: Êñ∞„Éª„Éà„É≥„Éá„É¢Ë∂ÖÂ∏∏ÁèæË±°60„ÅÆÁúüÁõ∏ (= Sceptic Library, Band 6). Otashuppan, Tokyo 2007, , p. 206.  Utsuro-bune in manga and anime  Utsuro-bune are popular motifs in manga and anime. A prominent example appears in the television series Mononoke (2007), which revolves around the tales told by a traveller known as the \\"medicine seller\\" (Ëñ¨Â£≤„Çä). In episodes 3‚Äì5, the protagonist tells the story of Umib≈çzu, in which a sunken Utsuro-bune features prominently. Here it is depicted as a decorated, sealed, hollow tree trunk, and contains the corpse of a young woman who had been sacrificed to sea demons.Dani Cavallaro: Magic As Metaphor in Anime: A Critical Study. McFarland, Jefferson (N.C.) 2010, , p. 89. In the third season of Mysterious Cities of Gold, an Utsuro-bune coming from the sunken third City has ended up in the forest near Kagoshima. When activated, it reveals a water- like hologram of a woman that tells the protagonists of the next key item to find.

Bassett starring Art Hindle, Trudy Young and John Vernon. The story line concerns a rookie Toronto Maple Leafs ice hockey player and his romance with a musician. Several National Hockey League players also appeared in the film. Plot Hockey player Billy Duke joins the Toronto Maple Leafs, and must adapt to the big league game with assistance from his room-mate, George Armstrong. Meanwhile, Duke starts a relationship with rock singer Sherri Lee Nelson, who objects to Duke's often rough hockey playing. As the two become more involved, Leafs' coach Fred Wares worries that Sherri is causing Duke to lose his on-ice focus. Cast The main cast, per the opening credits, are: The 1970‚Äì71 Toronto Maple Leafs served as Billy Duke's National Hockey League (NHL) team, with players appearing in real game footage as well as many scripted scenes throughout the film. Leafs player Jim McKenny wore #18 with the team that season, thus served as #18 \\"Billy Duke\\" in actual game footage. Some Leafs players had scripted lines of dialogue, including: Paul Henderson, dances with Sherri at New Year's party, \\"You're a real swinger\\"; Jim Dorey, fights with Billy in the dressing room, \\"Who the hell do you think you are\\"; Ron Ellis, gets some medical attention in the dressing room, \\"Hey Billy boy - aren't you going to ask us how we lost those three games\\"; Rick Ley, teases Billy in the dressing room, \\"What's the secret of faking a 10-day layoff?\\"; while George Armstrong is a credited performer, with numerous speaking lines. Players from other NHL teams also made appearances, in filmed scenes or actual game footage, including Jean B√©liveau, Gordie Howe and Bobby Hull. Game film included, and the closing credits acknowledged, the 1970‚Äì71 Boston Bruins, 1970‚Äì71 Montreal Canadiens, 1970‚Äì71 Los Angeles Kings, 1970‚Äì71 Chicago Black Hawks, 1970‚Äì71 Detroit Red Wings, 1970‚Äì71 Philadelphia Flyers, 1970‚Äì71 California Golden Seals, 1970‚Äì71 Vancouver Canucks and 1970‚Äì71 New York Rangers. Some members of the actual press corps that covered the Leafs and the NHL had lines in the film, including George Gross, Scott Young and Fergie Olver (misspelled \\"Oliver\\"). The long-time medical trainer for the Leafs, Joe Sgro, had scripted lines as the \\"Leaf Trainer\\", appearing in one scene with a silent Leafs owner Harold Ballard as \\"Leaf Doctor\\". Production The film was produced by Basset's Agincourt International studio and was financially supported by the Canadian Film Development Corporation. Product placements, besides the presence of the Toronto Maple Leafs brand, included visible use of Molson brand beer and scenes filmed at Eaton's and the Inn on the Park hotel. The Eaton's connection included then-racecar-driver George Eaton, future chief executive officer of Eaton's, playing the role of Max in the film. Release The film's debut was in Toronto on 12 November 1971 and released the following week throughout Canada at 20 theatres which was then the widest distribution of a Canadian feature film. The film was distributed in 1971 by Alliance Film Distribution in Canada, and Cannon Films in the U.S. Reception The film generally received negative reviews. Martin Knelman of The Globe and Mail found the production \\"downright head-clutchingly terrible.\\" Regina's Leader- Post cited \\"terrible acting and inane dialogue\\". Dave Billington of The Gazette (Montreal) also panned the production noting that \\"most of the ingredients of a good film were there and they were sacrificed to box office expediency.\\" The Windsor Star was also critical noting such deficiences as \\"a sluggish pace and fumbling character development.\\" Face-Off grossed $600,000 in Canada ($ million today) at the box office by early 1973, the highest- grossing Canadian English language film in Canada. Although a substantial box office income for a Canadian film, the Canadian Film Development Corporation did not expect to fully recoup its investment unless the film earned twice that amount. Upon the 2011 DVD release of Face-Off, Sun Media's Bruce Kirkland acknowledged the \\"cheesy\\" production but noted the historic value of filmed scenes which included professional hockey players which he deemed of superior quality compared to the \\"crappy TV archives\\" of NHL footage of that time. Video release Face-Off was restored from an extant 35 mm print and released in Blu-ray format by Video Services Corp on 15 November 2011. Only 10,000 discs were produced, due to complications in obtaining permission from the NHL for the hockey footage used in the film. The DVD release includes the Second City Television parody of the film, \\"Power Play\\", which featured John Candy as Billy.

The knitted round caps were used by both soldiers and sailors, and they were widely exported. History In the early 14th century, the area immediately north of Monmouth, known as Archenfield, became known for the high quality of its wool, produced from Ryeland sheep. The wool was ideal for the production of high quality felt, and the location of Monmouth, on the River Wye some inland from the Severn estuary, allowed the produce of the area ready access to wider markets. The industry of cap manufacture by hand knitters in and around Monmouth was well established by the 15th century, when court records show Capper as a common surname in the town. Jennifer L.

Monmouth caps were essential equipment for soldiers, sailors and labourers of the period, so familiar and widely used that they were taken for granted. According to one 19th century encyclopedia, they were at one time \\"worn by a large portion of the population of England and Wales.\\" The Cappers Act of 1488 forbade, on penalty of a fine, the wearing of foreign-made caps in England and Wales. A further Act of Parliament in 1571, during the reign of Elizabeth I, stated that every person above the age of six years (excepting \\"Maids, ladies, gentlewomen, noble personages, and every Lord, knight and gentleman of twenty marks land\\") residing in any of the cities, towns, villages or hamlets of England, must wear, on Sundays and holidays (except when travelling), \\"a cap of wool, thicked and dressed in England, made within this realm, and only dressed and finished by some of the trade of cappers, upon pain to forfeit for every day of not wearing 3s. 4d.\\" This legislation was intended to protect domestic production, as caps were becoming unfashionable and were being challenged by new forms of imported headgear. It was repealed in 1597 as unworkable.Victoria and Albert Museum: description of cap.

In the 1620s, the sponsors of the Massachusetts Bay Colony ordered Monmouth caps - described as \\"thick, warm, fulled by hand- and foot- beating and much favored by seamen\\" - as part of the outfitting of the settlers. Daniel Defoe, in his 1712 Tour through the Whole Island of Great Britain, described Monmouth caps as being worn predominantly by Dutch seamen. Peter the Great of Russia wore one when working for the East India Company in 1697; it is preserved in the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg. As the caps were increasingly made outside Monmouthshire, the term \\"Monmouth cap\\" came to mean the style of cap, rather than any location of manufacture. Areas, such as Coventry, produced other varieties of cap, and similar caps were known simply as knitted caps, Kilmarnock cauls, Scotch bonnets, or watch caps.Mara Riley. Knitted caps. Accessed 28 February 2012 Description Thousands of Monmouth caps were made, but their relatively low cost, and the ease with which the knitting could unravel, means that few remain. The picture of the brown hat with the carrying loop is from Monmouth Museum and shows this rare example, which was knitted from coarse 2 ply wool. The cap was made by casting on at the lower edge and knitting in the round towards the top. The crown consists of a classic rounded top, with the last remaining stitches cast off. The yarn tail was wrapped around just below the cast off stitches to gather them, leaving the little lump commonly, but inexactly, referred to as a button. The doubled brim was formed by picking up stitches inside the body of the cap, and worked down to the original cast on. The cast on loops were picked up, and a 3 needle bindoff worked to finish and join the inner brim to the outer cap, ending with a little loop. Patterns that attempt a stitch for stitch reproduction sometimes result in a cap that is slightly too narrow, after felting, due to the different felting characteristics of modern knitting yarn. Each hat was made weatherproof by felting, a process which reduced its size. The distance from the centre to the hem in this example varies between 5 and .

Published in 2010 by W. W. Norton & Company, the book serves as a biographical portrait of United States President Abraham Lincoln, discussing the evolution of his stance on slavery in the United States over the course of his life. The Fiery Trial, which derives its title from a State of the Union address by Lincoln, was the 22nd book written by Foner, the DeWitt Clinton Professor of History at Columbia University. It was praised by critics and won the 2011 Pulitzer Prize for History, the Bancroft Prize, and the Lincoln Prize. Synopsis In the preface to The Fiery Trial, Eric Foner states his intention to trace \\"the evolution of Lincoln's ideas and policies about slavery from his early life through his career in the Illinois legislature in the 1830s, his term in Congress in the 1840s, his emergence as a leader of the new Republican party in the 1850s, and his presidency during the Civil War\\". The book closely examines Lincoln's speeches and writings, and avoids direct engagement with previous Lincoln historians. The Fiery Trial begins with Lincoln's encounters with slavery in his early life, growing up in Kentucky and Indiana. He occasionally dealt with issues of slavery in his law practice in Illinois. The book also discusses Lincoln's position on slavery in the context of his political career. Lincoln was a moderate, attempting to bridge the gap between the abolitionist Radical Republicans and conservative Democrats, including those in the slave-holding states, whom he hoped would choose preserving the Union over steadfastly defending slavery. Lincoln initially supported the idea of voluntary colonization of freed blacks to Africa, a stance supported by some politicians at the time, although considered unethical by many. However, Lincoln eventually abandoned his moderate stance on slavery when he determined that to win the American Civil War, he needed to act to end slavery. In the epilogue, Foner praises Lincoln's \\"capacity for growth, the essence of [his] greatness\\", and speculates that had he not been assassinated, he could have helped to prevent the disenfranchisement and segregation of blacks that followed emancipation. Foner concludes with a quotation by abolitionist Lydia Maria Child: > I think we have reason to thank God for Abraham Lincoln ... With all his > deficiencies, it must be admitted that he has grown continuously; and > considering how slavery had weakened and perverted the moral sense of the > whole country, it was great good luck to have the people elect a man who was > willing to grow. Background Eric Foner, the book's author Eric Foner, the book's author, is the DeWitt Clinton Professor of History at Columbia University. His specialties include the American Civil War and the subsequent Reconstruction Era. The Fiery Trial was his 22nd book. Foner's 1989 book Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863-1877 won the Bancroft Prize of Columbia University, an award also given to The Fiery Trial. Before The Fiery Trial, several of Foner's works had discussed Lincoln, but this was the first of his books to study the president directly. Foner began the book because he believed \\"that it was still possible to say something new, despite the voluminous literature that's out there.\\" The Fiery Trial was published in 2010 by W.W. Norton & Company. The book's title is a quotation from Lincoln's December 1, 1862 State of the Union address, in which he said of the Civil War: \\"Fellow citizens, we cannot escape history. We of this Congress and this administration, will be remembered in spite of ourselves ... The fiery trial through which we pass, will light us down, in honor or dishonor, to the latest generation.\\" Reception The Fiery Trial was generally well received by critics, who praised its insights and lucidity. David S. Reynolds, reviewing for The New York Times, described the book as a \\"political biography of Lincoln\\", and concluded that \\"More cogently than any previous historian, Foner examines the political events that shaped Lincoln and ultimately brought out his true greatness.\\" James M. McPherson, a previous winner of the Pulitzer Prize for History, stated of the book that \\"No one else has written about [Lincoln's] trajectory of change with such balance, fairness, depth of analysis, and lucid precision of language.\\" Library Journal called it \\"an essential work for all Americans\\": \\"In the vast library on Lincoln, Foner's book stands out as the most sensible and sensitive reading of Lincoln's lifetime involvement with slavery and the most insightful assessment of Lincoln's‚Äîand indeed America's‚Äîimperative to move toward freedom lest it be lost.\\" David M. Shribman, writing in The Boston Globe, called Foner \\"perhaps the preeminent historian of the Civil War era\\" and the book \\"a masterwork that examines Lincoln's passage to Gettysburg and beyond\\". In the San Francisco Chronicle, David W. Blight called The Fiery Trial \\"a distinctive and valuable book, showing persuasively that we should not understand Lincoln from the myth-glazed outcome reading backward, but from the beginning, through one transformative event after another, looking forward.\\" In a review for The Historian (journal), Lawrence Frederick Kohl wrote of the book that \\"Eric Foner's prodigious research and his deep knowledge of the era allow him to provide perhaps the best account of this subject available today. Even seasoned scholars will find facts in this volume that are new to them and fresh insights that they will want to consider.\\" Patrick Prendergast stated in The Irish Times that \\"For the interested but non-specialist reader Foner's book is a triumph, and he explains the progression in Lincoln's views of slavery in an accessible and exciting way.\\" Reviewing for The Washington Post, Fred Kaplan was more critical. Though Kaplan stated that the \\"comprehensive review of mostly familiar material\\" would make The Fiery Trial \\"the book of first convenience to go to on the subject\\", he also argued that in contrast to Foner's thesis of growth, \\"a stronger argument can be made that Lincoln hardly 'grew' at all on the issue of slavery, that he responded to changing circumstances that he did not create\\". The Fiery Trial won the 2011 Pulitzer Prize for History, the Bancroft Prize, and the Lincoln Prize. The New York Times Book Review listed The Fiery Trial as one of its 100 Notable Books of 2010, writing, \\"Foner tackles what would seem an obvious topic, Lincoln and slavery, and sheds new light on it.\\" References Sources * External links Presentation by Foner on The Fiery Trial, October 27, 2010, C-SPAN *Interview with Foner on The Fiery Trial, September 24, 2011, C-SPAN *Presentation by Foner on The Fiery Trial, September 24, 2011, C-SPAN Category:2010 non-fiction books Category:21st-century history books Category:American biographies Category:Biographies of Abraham Lincoln Category:History books about the American Civil War Category:Non-fiction books about American slavery Category:Pulitzer Prize for History-winning works Category:W.

Anantavarman Chodaganga () was a ruler of the Eastern Ganga dynasty which ruled the southern part of Kalinga, India. He was the son of Rajaraja Deva and Rajasundari, the daughter of emperor Virarajendra Chola. The Chola king Kulothunga Chola I of the Chola dynasty was his uncle. However, historian S.N. Sen states that Anantavarman was the maternal grandson of Kulottunga I. The Jagannath Temple at Puri was rebuilt in the 11th century atop its ruins by Anantavarman Chodaganga. King Chodaganga was originally a Shaivite from Srimukhalingam(which was in Kalinga/Odisha till 1934,as part of Undivided Ganjam District) but embraced Sri Vaishnavism under the influence of Sri Ramanuja when the latter visited the Jagannath Puri temple. In his Sindurapura grant(1118 A.D) Anantavarma styles himself Paramavaishnava. Despite being related to Anantavarman, Kulothunga Chola I did not stop from burning Anantavarman's empire. Historians propose that it was probably because the king failed to pay his rent for two consecutive years. He was ousted by Kulothunga's general Karunakara Thondaiman and this victory is detailed in the Tamil classic Kalingattupparani. Monarchs from this region of the subcontinent regularly assumed the title Chodaganga Deva throughout the ancient and medieval periods to allude to their Chola and Ganga heritage From various inscriptions it is known that King Anantavarman Chodaganga Deva established the present temple some time near the end of the eleventh century. A copper plate inscription made by King Rajaraja III found on the Tirumala Venkateswara Temple near the north entrance states that Jagannath temple was built by Gangesvara, i.e., Anantavarman Chodaganga Deva. Later, King Ananga Bhima Deva II (1170‚Äì1198) did much to continue the work of Chodaganga Deva, building the walls around the temple and many of the other shrines on the temple grounds. He is thus often considered one of the builders of the temple. He also did much to establish the regulations around the service to the Deity. A scion of this dynasty made rich donations to the Koneswaram temple, Trincomalee on Puthandu, 1223 CE in the name of King Chodaganga Deva. Shortly afterwards, the Konark temple was constructed in Odisha. A brother of the king titled Ulagaikonda Permadi is known to us from several inscriptions.

These files are generated as output by short read aligners like BWA. Both simple and advanced tools are provided, supporting complex tasks like variant calling and alignment viewing as well as sorting, indexing, data extraction and format conversion. SAM files can be very large (10s of Gigabytes is common), so compression is used to save space. SAM files are human-readable text files, and BAM files are simply their binary equivalent, whilst CRAM files are a restructured column-oriented binary container format. BAM files are typically compressed and more efficient for software to work with than SAM. SAMtools makes it possible to work directly with a compressed BAM file, without having to uncompress the whole file. Additionally, since the format for a SAM/BAM file is somewhat complex - containing reads, references, alignments, quality information, and user- specified annotations - SAMtools reduces the effort needed to use SAM/BAM files by hiding low-level details. Usage and commands Like many Unix commands, SAMtool commands follow a stream model, where data runs through each command as if carried on a conveyor belt. This allows combining multiple commands into a data processing pipeline. Although the final output can be very complex, only a limited number of simple commands are needed to produce it. If not specified, the standard streams (stdin, stdout, and stderr) are assumed. Data sent to stdout are printed to the screen by default but are easily redirected to another file using the normal Unix redirectors (> and >>), or to another command via a pipe (|). SAMtools commands SAMtools provides the following commands, each invoked as \\"\\". ; view : The command filters SAM or BAM formatted data. Using options and arguments it understands what data to select (possibly all of it) and passes only that data through. Input is usually a sam or bam file specified as an argument, but could be sam or bam data piped from any other command. Possible uses include extracting a subset of data into a new file, converting between BAM and SAM formats, and just looking at the raw file contents. The order of extracted reads is preserved. ; sort : The command sorts a BAM file based on its position in the reference, as determined by its alignment. The element + coordinate in the reference that the first matched base in the read aligns to is used as the key to order it by. [TODO: verify]. The sorted output is dumped to a new file by default, although it can be directed to stdout (using the -o option). As sorting is memory intensive and BAM files can be large, this command supports a sectioning mode (with the -m options) to use at most a given amount of memory and generate multiple output file. These files can then be merged to produce a complete sorted BAM file [TODO - investigate the details of this more carefully]. ; index : The command creates a new index file that allows fast look-up of data in a (sorted) SAM or BAM. Like an index on a database, the generated or file allows programs that can read it to more efficiently work with the data in the associated files. ; tview : The command starts an interactive ascii-based viewer that can be used to visualize how reads are aligned to specified small regions of the reference genome. Compared to a graphics based viewer like IGV,IGV it has few features. Within the view, it is possible to jumping to different positions along reference elements (using 'g') and display help information ('?'). ; mpileup : The command produces a pileup format (or BCF) file giving, for each genomic coordinate, the overlapping read bases and indels at that position in the input BAM files(s). This can be used for SNP calling for example. ; flagstat : Examples ; view : \`samtools view sample.bam > sample.sam\` Convert a bam file into a sam file. : \`samtools view -bS sample.sam > sample.bam\` Convert a sam file into a bam file. The option compresses or leaves compressed input data. : \`samtools view sample_sorted.bam \\"chr1:10-13\\"\` Extract all the reads aligned to the range specified, which are those that are aligned to the reference element named chr1 and cover its 10th, 11th, 12th or 13th base. The results is saved to a BAM file including the header. An index of the input file is required for extracting reads according to their mapping position in the reference genome, as created by samtools index. : \`samtools view -h -b sample_sorted.bam \\"chr1:10-13\\" > tiny_sorted.bam\` Extract the same reads as above, but instead of displaying them, writes them to a new bam file, tiny_sorted.bam. The option makes the output compressed and the option causes the SAM headers to be output also. These headers include a description of the reference that the reads in sample_sorted.bam were aligned to and will be needed if the tiny_sorted.bam file is to be used with some of the more advanced SAMtools commands. The order of extracted reads is preserved. ; tview : \`samtools tview sample_sorted.bam\` Start an interactive viewer to visualize a small region of the reference, the reads aligned, and mismatches.

The horizontal band of livestock across the foreground, although childlike in its simplicity, clearly presents each prize-winning animal as an individual portrait. Hicks' delight in creating ornamental pattern is evident in the arrangement of fences, while the rich red and bright white of the house and barn symmetrically flank this central landscape.

All living members of the genus are found in the waters around Antarctica but the first species described in the genus was a fossil and was found in Europe. Description Members of the genus Sterechinus have compound ambulacral plates that are trigeminate (composed of three elements). These plates have a primary tubercle articulating with a spine on the middle element, a small secondary tubercle in the interambulacral groove on one side of it and 3 pairs of pores on the other. The tube feet are connected to these pores in the living animal and the pore pairs are arranged in a vertical arc. The sutures between the plates are deeply indented. The area of narrow plates around the mouth is small and the buccal notches are shallowly grooved.Stirechinus Desor, 1856 The Natural History Museum. Retrieved 2012-01-09. Species The type species of this genus is Stirechinus scillae which was first described from a fossil by Pierre Desor in 1856. Stirechinus scillae lived from the Late Miocene to the Plio-Pleistocene and further fossils have since been found in France, Sicily and Malta. None of the fossilized urchins so far discovered had any apical plates. Since then, other members of the genus have been described, all from the waters around Antarctica.

Background Osmakac, an Albanian and a naturalized U.S. citizen, was arrested January 7, 2012, for his plot. He intended to bomb nightclubs, detonate a car bomb, fire an assault rifle, wear an explosive belt in a crowded area, and take hostages. Osmakac recorded an eight-minute video prior to his arrest describing the planned attack as retribution for wrongs committed against Muslims. The Federal Bureau of Investigation claimed Osmakac bought explosives and firearms from an undercover agent. He had been under investigation since September 2011, when a confidential source informed federal authorities that Osmakac walked into a business seeking al-Qaeda flags. Osmakac appeared in videos posted to an extremist YouTube nom de guerre \\"Abu Samia\\", in which he condemned other religions and secular Muslims. Osmakac was kicked out of two mosques in the Tampa Bay area and reported to the FBI by a Muslim acquaintance. The FBI then set up a sting operation, supplying Osmakac, who could not even afford to fix the car he intended to drive, with money to purchase weapons and a video camera stolen from Best Buy to make his video.

At some point following the demise of Aj Wosal Chan K ºinich in about 615, Naranjo repudiated the long-standing overlordship of the Snake kingdom. This may have come about as the result of the death of the powerful Kaan monarch Scroll Serpent and the temptation of client states to test the mettle of his successors. It may have taken place under Tajoom Uk ºab K ºahk's immediate predecessor Yuknoom Ti º Chan, who is known to have been on the throne by 619.

They all live together with Charlotte's step-sister Joan (Rhonda Fleming), as well as Joan's mother, the scattered chatterer Inez (Mabel Albertson). They also have a boarder, Dr. Jake Diamond (Efrem Zimbalist, Jr.), who, according to Arnold (Dan O'Herlihy), has been experiencing anti-Semitism at the college where they both teach. Arnold shuns Charlotte, sleeping on the couch, instead of in their bed, keeping away from her with a multitude of excuses, while chumming around with Joan. Part of Charlotte's commitment to the mental facility hinged on her continuing suspicions of an attraction between her husband and her beautiful step-sister. Inez bosses Charlotte mercilessly while a maid in their kitchen scolds her. Diamond disconcertedly is a calm, pipe smoking, handsome figure who shows Charlotte gentle and knowing sympathy, tempting her into a romantic relationship. Two acquaintances, Hamilton Gregory (Steve Dunne) and Cathy Bergner (Joanna Barnes), separately imply to her that an affair between Arnold and Joan is a reality. Charlotte walks several miles through the snow to the college to confront her husband. Later, before a dinner with important faculty, she comes dressed and coiffed to resemble Joan, disrupting the dinner and appearing to be headed toward another breakdown. She also learns from Diamond that his chance for promotion at the college was sabotaged by Arnold. Charlotte agrees to a divorce. Diamond asks her to join him in New York.

It is intended to be a high-precision primary reference for prediction and observation of those positions and motions, and which provides a basis for further refinement of the model. It is generally not intended to cover the entire life of the Solar System; usually a short-duration time span, perhaps a few centuries, is represented to high accuracy. Some long ephemerides cover several millennia to medium accuracy. They are published by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory as Development Ephemeris. The latest releases include DE430 which covers planetary and lunar ephemeris from Dec 21, 1549 to Jan 25, 2650 with high precision and is intended for general use for modern time periods . DE431 was created to cover a longer time period Aug 15, -13200 to March 15, 17191 with slightly less precision for use with historic observations and far reaching forecasted positions. DE432 was released as a minor update to DE430 with improvements to the Pluto barycenter in support of the New Horizons mission. Description The set of physical laws and numerical constants used in the calculation of the ephemeris must be self- consistent and precisely specified. The ephemeris must be calculated strictly in accordance with this set, which represents the most current knowledge of all relevant physical forces and effects. Current fundamental ephemerides are typically released with exact descriptions of all mathematical models, methods of computation, observational data, and adjustment to the observations at the time of their announcement.See, for instance, ; ; This may not have been the case in the past, as fundamental ephemerides were then computed from a collection of methods derived over a span of decades by many researchers. A chapter from an as-yet-unpublished (Feb 2012) version of the Explanatory Supplement (see Sources) The independent variable of the ephemeris is always time. In the case of the most current ephemerides, it is a relativistic coordinate time scale equivalent to the IAU definition of TCB. In the past, mean solar time (before the discovery of the non-uniform rotation of the Earth) and ephemeris time (before the implementation of relativistic gravitational equations) were used. The remainder of the ephemeris can consist of either the mathematical equations and initial conditions which describe the motions of the bodies of the Solar System, of tabulated data calculated from those equations and conditions, or of condensed mathematical representations of the tabulated data. A fundamental ephemeris is the basis from which apparent ephemerides, phenomena, and orbital elements are computed for astronomical, nautical, and surveyors' almanacs. Apparent ephemerides give positions and motions of Solar System bodies as seen by observers from the surface of Earth, and are useful for astronomers, navigators, and surveyors in planning observations and in reducing the data acquired, although much of the work of latter two has been supplanted by GPS technology. Phenomena are events related to the configurations of Solar System bodies, for instance rise and set times, phases, eclipses and occultations, and have many civil and scientific applications. Orbital elements are descriptions of the motion of a body at a particular instant, used for further short-time-span calculation of the body's position when high accuracy is not required. History Astronomers have been tasked with computing accurate ephemerides, originally for purposes of sea navigation, from at least the 18th century. In England, Charles II founded the Royal Observatory in 1675, which began publishing The Nautical Almanac in 1766. In France, the Bureau des Longitudes was founded in 1795 to publish the Connaissance des Temps. The early fundamental ephemerides of these publications came from many different sources and authors as the science of celestial mechanics matured.See Explanatory Supplement (1961), chap. 7 or Explanatory Supplement (1992), chap. 13 for extensive lists of sources of the early fundamental ephemerides of the Nautical Almanac. (see Sources) At the end of the 19th century, the analytical methods of general perturbations reached the probable limits of what could be accomplished by hand calculation. The planetary \\"theories\\" of Newcomb and Hill formed the fundamental ephemerides of the Nautical Almanac at that time. For the Sun, Mercury, Venus, and Mars, the tabulations of the Astronomical Almanac continued to be derived from the work of Newcomb and Ross through 1983. In France, the works of LeVerrierLeVerrier developed and published his original theories of the outer planets in Annales de l'Observatoire de Paris, M√©moires |volume=X-|volume=XIV and Gaillot formed the fundamental ephemeris of the Connaissance des Temps. From the mid 20th century, work began on numerical integration of the equations of motion on early computing machines for purposes of producing fundamental ephemerides for the Astronomical Almanac. Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto were based on the work of Eckert, et al. and Clemence through 1983. The fundamental ephemeris of the Moon, always a difficult problem in celestial mechanics, remained a work-in-progress through the early 1980s. It was based originally on the work of Brown, with updates and corrections by Clemence, et al. and Eckert, et al.See also . Starting in 1984, a revolution in the methods of producing fundamental ephemerides began.See for a good description of the new methods from their early days. From 1984 through 2002, the fundamental ephemeris of the Astronomical Almanac was the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's DE200/LE200, a fully numerically-integrated ephemeris fitted to modern position and velocity observations of the Sun, Moon, and planets. From 2003 onward (as of Feb 2012), JPL's DE405/LE405, an integrated ephemeris referred to the International Celestial Reference Frame, has been used. In France, the Bureau des Longitudes began using their machine-generated semi-analytical theory VSOP82 in 1984, and their work continued with the founding of the Institut de m√©canique c√©leste et de calcul des √©ph√©m√©rides in 1998 and the INPOP; ; series of numerical ephemerides. DE405/LE405 were superseded by DE421/LE421 in 2008.

Background Prior to the institution of a common currency, the then European Economic Community decided in 1962 to denominate its transactions in its own internal unit of account ‚Äì initially the gold parity unit of account, fixed to the value of gold, and equivalent to the US dollar.B. Steiner (1993).\\"Of Snakes in the Tunnell, Green ECU's and the EMU\\". University of Reading. Accessed 9 January 2012. Following the devaluation of the French franc and the revaluation of the Deutsche Mark in 1969, the governments involved considered that agricultural support should not be subject to the fluctuations of floating exchange rates, arguing that lower prices would be unacceptable for farmers, while higher prices would be inflationary.Brian E. Hill. The common agricultural policy: past, present, and future. Instead, they continued to use a form of fixed exchange rates for agricultural support, resulting in the so-called 'agricultural conversion rates' or 'green exchange rates', including the green pound after the United Kingdom's accession to the EEC on 1 January 1973. Revaluations, devaluations and politics Although the value of the green pound was changed from time to time, initially such changes could only take place by agreement between the governments, making the value of the green pound a significant political issue. At certain points during the 1970s the green pound was overvalued by up to 30% compared to the pound sterling, keeping food prices and British farmers' incomes artificially low. On 23 January 1978, following a campaign by the National Farmers Union (NFU) that was opposed by the trades unions and other interests, the Callaghan Government was defeated in a vote in the House of Commons when a Conservative amendment to devalue the green pound by 7.5%, rather than the 5% devaluation proposed by the Government, was passed with the support of other opposition parties and some Labour backbenchers.The Politics of the Green Pound, 1974-79, Wyn Grant, JCMS: Journal of Common Market Studies Vol 19 No 4, Blackwell Publishing Ltd, doi 10.1111/j.1468-5965.1981.tb00239.x, published 1981-06-04Speech to National Farmers Union Margaret Thatcher Foundation, published 1978-01-24, accessed 2012-01-11The Campaign Guide Supplement 1978, Conservative and Unionist Central Office, published March 1978, accessed 2012-01-11 Cabinet papers later revealed that the Government considered that a 5% devaluation was the minimum necessary to stem the decline in the UK's beef and pig sector in the face of competition from Danish bacon and Irish pork, potentially saving several thousand jobs, but that this was forecast to increase the cost of food by 1%.Cabinet Memorandum CAB 129/199/3: The Green Pound, John Silkin, published 1978-01-16, accessed 2012-01-09 In practice, the Government applied the devaluation selectively and in stages, with an initial 5% devaluation applying to livestock only.

In this speech, Lincoln spoke about the dangers of slavery in the United States, as the institution could corrupt the federal government. Lincoln warned that mobs or people who disrespected U.S. laws and courts could destroy the United States. He went on to say the Constitution and rule of law in the United States are \\"the political religion of our nation.\\"Eli Merritt, \\"The Constitution is Our 'Political Religion: Remembering Lincoln‚Äôs Words,'\\" Seattle Times, March 8, 2019 The speech The subject of Lincoln's speech was citizenship in a constitutional republic and threats to U.S. institutions. In the speech, Lincoln discussed in glowing terms the political system established by the founding fathers, but warned of a destructive force from within. He asked his listeners: > \\"Shall we expect some transatlantic military giant to step the ocean and > crush us at a blow? Never! All the armies of Europe, Asia, and Africa > combined, with all the treasure of the earth (our own excepted) in their > military chest, with a Bonaparte for a commander, could not by force take a > drink from the Ohio or make a track on the Blue Ridge in a trial of a > thousand years. At what point then is the approach of danger to be expected? > I answer. If it ever reach us it must spring up amongst us; it cannot come > from abroad. If destruction be our lot we must ourselves be its author and > finisher. As a nation of freemen we must live through all time or die by > suicide.\\" Lincoln indirectly blamed slavery for lawlessness in the United States.Foner, p. 27 In this context he warned that > whenever the vicious portion of [our] population shall be permitted to > gather in bands of hundreds and thousands, and burn churches, ravage and rob > provision stores, throw printing-presses into rivers, shoot editors, and > hang and burn obnoxious persons at pleasure and with impunity, depend upon > it, this government cannot last. By such things the feelings of the best > citizens will become more or less alienated from it, and thus it will be > left without friends, or with too few, and those few too weak to make their > friendship effectual. Lincoln then warned that a tyrant could overtake the U.S. political system from within. He said: > It is to deny what the history of the world tells us is true, to suppose > that men of ambition and talents will not continue to spring up amongst us. > And when they do, they will as naturally seek the gratification of their > ruling passion as others have done before them. The question then is, Can > that gratification be found in supporting and maintaining an edifice that > has been erected by others? Most certainly it cannot. Many great and good > men, sufficiently qualified for any task they should undertake, may ever be > found whose ambition would aspire to nothing beyond a seat in Congress, a > gubernatorial or a presidential chair; but such belong not to the family of > the lion or the tribe of the eagle. What! think you these places would > satisfy an Alexander, a Caesar, or a Napoleon? Never! Towering genius > disdains a beaten path. It seeks regions hitherto unexplored. It sees no > distinction in adding story to story upon the monuments of fame erected to > the memory of others. It denies that it is glory enough to serve under any > chief. It scorns to tread in the footsteps of any predecessor, however > illustrious. It thirsts and burns for distinction; and if possible, it will > have it, whether at the expense of emancipating slaves or enslaving freemen. > Is it unreasonable, then, to expect that some man possessed of the loftiest > genius, coupled with ambition sufficient to push it to its utmost stretch, > will at some time spring up among us? And when such an one does, it will > require the people to be united with each other, attached to the government > and laws, and generally intelligent, to successfully frustrate his designs. > Distinction will be his paramount object, and although he would as > willingly, perhaps more so, acquire it by doing good as harm, yet, that > opportunity being past, and nothing left to be done in the way of building > up, he would set boldly to the task of pulling down. To prevent this, Lincoln concluded that there was a need to cultivate a \\"political religion\\" that emphasizes \\"reverence for the laws\\" and puts reliance on \\"reason, cold, calculating, unimpassioned reason.\\" During the speech, Lincoln referenced two murders committed by pro-slavery mobs. The first was the burning of Francis McIntosh, a freedman who killed a constable, and was subsequently lynched by a mob in St. Louis in 1836.Foner, p. 28 Lincoln also referenced the death of Elijah Parish Lovejoy, a newspaper editor and abolitionist, who was murdered three months earlier by a pro-slavery mob in nearby Alton, Illinois. Legacy The address was published in the Sangamon Journal, helping to establish Lincoln's reputation as an orator. As the Lyceum address was one of Lincoln's earliest published speeches, it has been examined thoroughly by historians. Gore Vidal claimed to have used this speech to fully understand Lincoln's character for his historical novel Lincoln. The speech is re-arranged and slightly misquoted at the beginning of the first episode of Ken Burns's documentary series The Civil War. This arrangement of the quotation is repeated at the beginning of the song \\"A More Perfect Union\\" by New Jersey-based band Titus Andronicus from their second album The Monitor. A large portion of the speech is used in the Disneyland attraction Great Moments With Mr. Lincoln (1965-present).

Published in September 2011 by Hachette Book Group, an imprint of Little, Brown and Company. The story follows Karou, a seventeen-year-old Prague art student. Karou was raised by chimaera, or creatures that have attributes of different animals and humans. The chimaera she lives with demand teeth in exchange for wishes and send Karou to fetch these teeth for them. In the beginning, Karou has yet to discover what the teeth are eventually used for and why there are rules such as \\"no baby teeth\\" and \\"no rotting\\". While on one of these missions, Karou finds a seraph named Akiva who finds something familiar in her. Daughter of Smoke and Bone received high reviews from critics such as Chelsey Philpot from The New York Times, and Universal Pictures has acquired the rights for a film adaptation. Daughter of Smoke and Bone is the first in a trilogy. The second book, Days of Blood and Starlight, was released on 6 November 2012.Days of Blood & Starlight (Daughter of Smoke and Bone): Laini Taylor: 9780316133975. Accessed 4 September 2012. The third and final book, Dreams of Gods and Monsters, was released on 8 April 2014. Plot summary Karou, a 17-year-old art student living in Prague, goes about her daily life attending classes and hanging out with her best friend Zuzana, while simultaneously trying to evade her ex-boyfriend Kazimir. It is soon revealed, however, that Karou was raised by four chimaera living in a workshop on a trans-dimensional plane between the human world and Eretz, from where the chimaera originate. The workshop is owned by Brimstone, who is her father figure. While with Zuzana, Karou is summoned by Brimstone to do a job, which requires her to collect teeth - both of human and animal origin - from her world and bring them to him. He uses the teeth for unspecified purposes and pays Karou in physical trinkets which she uses to perform wishes. Karou, having grown weary of her job, which usually includes dealings with illegal dealers and graverobbers, reluctantly departs. When she returns to the workshop via portal doors that connects to all parts of the world, she finds the door scorched with a black handmark. Across the world, more of Brimstone's doors are marked with the black handmark. The perpetrators turn out to be an angel named Akiva and his, essentially brother and sister, Liraz and Hazael, belonging to a race of seraphim at war with the chimaera in their local Eretz. When Karou returns to the workshop for another mission, the chimaera tell her of their fears of her \\"taking her freedom\\" and abandoning them. Feeling uncomfortable with the thought of leaving her family, Karou ventures into Morocco to purchase human teeth from an old graverobber, Izil, who is burdened with a cursed angel, Razgut, on his shoulder. In her meeting with this man, the graverobber tells her Brimstone once asked to purchase baby teeth. Razgut recognizes and makes contact with Akiva, who was watching Karou. Akiva promptly attacks Karou, and she barely escapes his sword by fleeing into the workshop through a portal door. Inside of the workshop, Karou is taken by curiosity and decides to slip beyond the door leading to Eretz and has her first look at this world. When Brimstone discovers her, however, he is taken by anger and returns her to Prague, sealing off the entrance back in. While Karou is sealed off from Brimstone's workshop, all the portals in the human world leading to it are burned away by the seraph's black handprints. Consumed by a desire to see her family again, Karou travels the world, taking the physical wishes from Brimstone's teeth dealers by force. She eventually uses one of her wishes to obtain the ability to fly. In Marrakech, she connects with Razgut, and makes a deal with him to take her to Eretz. She returns one last time to Prague for the sake of seeing Zuzana's puppet show. In Prague, however, Karou is once more pursued by Akiva. She confronts and defeats him in a mid-air battle, and takes him to her apartment, where she questions him about Eretz and the chimaera-seraphim war. She strikes up a careful friendship with the angel. Eventually, Akiva discovers Karou's wishbone-necklace - the only thing she still has left from her chimaera family - and cries out, proclaiming he knows who she really is. Upon realizing Karou's identity, Akiva defies his brother and sister, who want Karou dead. In a confrontation that takes place in public, exposing angels to the human world, Akiva sends Karou off to safety from his siblings. In Akiva's flashbacks, the truth is unveiled - Brimstone's business was to build new bodies using the teeth he collects, by which means he was able to endlessly resurrect fallen chimaera soldiers in the war against the seraphim, and \\"Karou\\" is simply the human incarnation of a deceased chimaera - born into a human body using the baby teeth once mentioned by Izil. Karou's original identity was that of Madrigal Kirin, a chimaera who once spared the life of Akiva when she found him on the battlefield, and subsequently fell in love and started an affair with the seraph. Because of this, she was eventually publicly executed. Once Akiva realizes this, he also helps Karou see the truth by shattering her wishbone necklace, restoring the memories of Karou's previous life. At last, however, Akiva must also reveal to her that his previous efforts to end the seraphim-chimaera war was by destroying Brimstone's business, and that all Karou's chimaera family is dead. Critical reception The New York Times reviewed Daughter of Smoke and Bone. The reviewer was disappointed that it was the first in a series, saying that she \\"felt stood up\\", but was positive of the book in itself. She called it a \\"breath-catching romantic fantasy\\" and said that the \\"descriptions and language stop your heart and then ... start it up again.\\" She ended by saying that even though she had wanted it to be its own book, she would \\"be back for more\\". Kirkus Reviews also reviewed Smoke and Bone and were also rather positive. They said that though the novel \\"hinges on major contrivances\\", the language was \\"heightened ... even casual banter came off as wildly funny\\". The review ended with saying that the series began \\"deliciously\\". Daughter of Smoke and Bone was a finalist for the 2011 Andre Norton Award. Film adaptation Universal Pictures acquired the rights for a film adaptation. The producer for the movie was announced on 18 December 2012 to be Joe Roth. Stuart Beattie was attached as writer. However as of 2020, no film has been made.

It was his only public speech on the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, following the army's intervention and use of force on the student-led protests on June 4. Portions of the speech aired on the CCTV program Xinwen Lianbo on that same evening. The speech was delivered to a group of People's Liberation Army generals in Beijing. It set the defiant tone for the Chinese leadership that the army's use of force was fully justified, demonstrated that Deng was still firmly in charge of China, quelled rumours of impending civil war, and signaled that China's economic reforms would continue as planned. Main points The speech contains three major parts: assessing the nature of the Tiananmen Square protests, evaluating the correctness of Deng's major policies since 1978, and setting the tone for future development. Deng re-affirmed the party's decision to authorize the use of force on June 4. He said that given \\"the macro-international climate and China's own micro climate,\\" (referring to Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union in the former) some sort of anti-party, anti-communist movement was bound to occur. Deng re-iterated the line put forth by the April 26 Editorial that the movement was out to overthrow China's political system and the Communist Party, going as far as to call the student movement a \\"counter-revolutionary rebellion.\\" He praised the role of the People's Liberation Army in taking decisive action against protesters, calling soldiers \\"sons and brothers of the people\\", and lamented PLA casualties on June 4. He said in taking the role it did, the army passed a 'serious test'; i.e., loyalty to \\"the people, the teachings of the party, and the interests of the country.\\" Deng acknowledged that some parts of the Communist Party leadership did not agree with the course of action, but said that he had faith that in the long run, they will change their minds. Deng went on to ask rhetorically whether the reform and opening policies that he had implemented in the 1980s were correct. He asked his audience to \\"ponder\\" this question. He stated that the goal of China was to become a moderately developed nation by 2050, and that he believes this is only achievable through the leadership of the party and political stability. Essentially this is summed up by his signature epithet \\"One Center, Two Basic Points\\": that the central focus of the Chinese state was economic development, but that such development should occur simultaneously through 1) centralized political control (i.e., the Four Cardinal Principles) and 2) aggressive market reforms and openness to the outside world. Deng asserted that the Tiananmen protests arose out of a failure of the leadership to uphold strongly the control exercised by the party as well as ideological flexibility that pandered to Western values. He framed Western-style democracy as a sign of bourgeois liberalism and as an ideology that is not well-suited for China's internal conditions. He called on the leadership to further entrench party orthodoxy among young people, effectively re-introducing restrictions on freedom of speech, the press, and assembly. These freedoms were prominent during the more liberal political environment of the late 1980s. Deng also referenced the United States in the speech. He criticized the United States for interfering in China's internal affairs, and alluded to the United States shooting its own student protesters and therefore having no moral authority to criticize China. This is believed to be a reference to the 1970 Kent State shootings. Significance At the time of the Tiananmen Square protests, Deng's only official title was that of the Chairman of the Central Military Commission, which means that he held ultimate control of the army. Deng delivered the speech in this capacity, as to not overstep his 'official' titles, but in reality it also gave an impression that he was in firm control and the country was no longer at risk of a civil war or uprising. The speech acted to clarify any doubt in the party line for lower level officials and among the general populace. Party organizations organized citizens to study the contents of the speech. Prior to the speech, to avoid speculation that he was ruling from 'behind the throne', Deng had shied away from public appearances for the duration of the protests - with the notable exceptions of appearing at the state funeral of Hu Yaobang, and meeting Mikhail Gorbachev in mid-May. However, Zhao Ziyang's comment to Gorbachev that Deng is still the paramount authority in China put Deng back into the spotlight both among the Chinese public and international media. While the Speech was unequivocal in its support for the Army's actions, it also insisted on continuing economic reform policies that have become a hallmark of Deng's tenure. Nonetheless, Deng's economic policies lost significant traction within the party following the protests, and the rigour of reform was not renewed until his nanxun (\\"Southern Tour\\") in 1992.

Early life The youngest son of Benjamin and Anne Gascoyne was born at Chiswick, and baptised in its parish church on 26 August 1700. He set up in business as a brewer in Gravel Lane, Houndsditch.Osborn, Complete Guide, 1749, p. 137. His residence was at Barking in 1733, and the baptisms of his four youngest children are recorded there between 1733 and 1738. In 1755 he is described as of Mincing Lane, where he probably lived in the house of his father-in-law, Dr. Bamber, though still carrying on the brewhouse in Houndsditch in partnership with one Weston. Gascoyne was admitted a freeman of the Worshipful Company of Brewers by redemption (purchase) 17 December 1741, he took the clothing of the livery 8 March 1744, fined for the offices of steward and the three grades of wardenship 19 August 1746, and was elected an assistant 11 October 1745, and master of the company for 1746‚Äì1747. Political life Gascoyne was elected alderman of Vintry ward 20 June 1745, and sworn into office on 2 July.Vintry Wardmote Book, Guildhall Library MS. 68. He served the office of sheriff of London and Middlesex in 1747‚Äì1748. In December 1748 he took a prominent part, at the head of the committee of city lands, in passing through the common council an act for the relief of the orphans of the City of London, whose estates, vested in the guardianship of the corporation, had greatly suffered through the exactions of the Civil War period and the illegal closing of the exchequer by Charles II.William Maitland, History of London, 1756, i. 670. Gascoyne became Lord Mayor in 1752, and was the first chief magistrate who occupied the present Mansion House, the building of which had been commenced in 1739 on the site of Stocks Market. Owing to the change of style, the date of the mayoralty procession was this year altered from 29 October to 9 November. Gascoyne presided as lord mayor at the trial of the women Squires and Wells, convicted of kidnapping Elizabeth Canning. His suspicions being aroused he started further inquiries, which resulted in proving that Canning's accusation was false. The mob took Canning's part, insulted the lord mayor, breaking his coach windows, and even threatening his life. Gascoyne justified himself in an address to the liverymen of London,London, 1754, folio; abstract in ‚ÄòLondon Magazine,‚Äô xxiii. 317‚Äì320. and received a vote of thanks from the common council at the end of his year of office.Maitland, i. 708. Early in his mayoralty, 22 November 1752, Gascoyne was knighted on the occasion of presenting an address to the king; he was also a verderer of Epping Forest, in which office he was succeeded by his eldest son.London Magazine, 1763. He purchased large estates in Essex, including the buildings and grounds of an ancient hospital and chapel at Ilford, and the right of presentation to the living (see Impropriation). Death and estate Gascoyne died on 28 December 1761, and was buried on 4 January 1762 in Barking Church, in the north aisle of which is a large monument with an inscription, erected to his memory by his four children.History of Essex, Elizabeth Ogborne , 1814, p. 39 His will, dated 20 December 1761, was proved in the P.C.C. 4 January 1762 (St. Eloy, 13). He married Margaret, daughter and co-heiress of Dr. John Bamber, a wealthy physician of Mincing Lane, who purchased large estates in Essex and built the mansion of Bifrons at Barking.Munk, College of Physicians, 2nd edit., ii. 107‚Äì8. A drawing of this house as it appeared in 1794 is preserved in the Guildhall Library copy of Daniel Lysons's Environs (vol. iv. pt. i. p. 88). Gascoyne had four surviving children‚ÄîBamber, Joseph, Ann and Margaret. His wife was buried in Barking Church 10 October 1740. Dr. Bamber died in November 1753, and his property descended in entail to Bamber Gascoyne (1725‚Äì1791), the eldest son.Gent. Mag. 1753, p. 540. Bamber Gascoyne entered Queen's College, Oxford (1743); was barrister of Lincoln's Inn (1750); was M.P. for Malden 1761‚Äì63, Midhurst 1765‚Äì70, Weobly 1770‚Äì1774, Truro 1774‚Äì1784, and Bossiney 1784‚Äì1786; and was also receiver-general of customsFoster, Alumni Oxon. and a lord of the admiralty.Gent. Mag. 1791, ii. 1066. On his death in 1791 the Bamber estates descended to his son Bamber (1758‚Äì1824), M.P. for Liverpool 1780‚Äì96, who cut off the entail, pulled down the house of Bifrons, and sold the site and park. His daughter and heiress married the second Marquis of Salisbury, who took the name of Gascoyne before that of Cecil, and became possessed of the Bamber property, worth, it is said, ¬£12000 a year (Munk's Roll). Their son was Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury, three times prime minister. A mezzotint portrait of Crisp Gascoyne by James McArdell, from a painting by William Keable, was published in the London Magazine for July 1753.

Pal√§ontologische Zeitschrift, 83(2), 267‚Äì291. doi:10.1007/s12542-009-0021-9 It is the only genus in the extinct family Tuarangiidae and order Tuarangiida. The genus is known solely from Middle to Late Cambrian fossils found in Europe and New Zealand. The genus currently contains two accepted species, Tuarangia gravgaerdensis and the type species Tuarangia paparua. Description Tuarangia is a minute bivalve which was first described in 1982 by David I. MacKinnon of the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand. Generally the shells of Tuarangia are subquadrate to trapezoidal and elongate in shape. The long hinge is straight with an indistinct umbone positioned close to the lateral midline of the hinge. The subparallel bar-like teeth of Tuarangia are taxodontic, and with a grouped into two rows with a ridge in between. An erect, narrow ligament is placed on the separating ridge. The shell structure of Tuarangia is noted for being composed of platy calcite sections in a zig-zag patterning. This is different from the shells of other Cambrian bivalves, which have a prismatic calcite shell and layers of carbonate nacre which similar to the laminar aragonite layer found in extant monoplacophora. The genus name is taken from the Maori word tuarangi, which means \\"ancient or of ancient date\\". Tuarangia paparua is based on the holotype specimen, UCM 923, and the paratype specimens, UCM 924-UCM 931, all of which are housed in the University of Canterbury Geology Department. The fossils were found in sediments of the late middle Cambrian aged Tasman Formation which outcrops west of Cobb Reservoir in the Tasman Region, South Island, New Zealand. The specific epithet is from the Maori words papa, which translates as \\"shell\\", and rua, which means \\"two\\". The species would have lived along the coast of the paleocontinent Eastern Gondwana. The second species of Tuarangia to be described, Tuarangia gravgaerdensis, is from sediments of the middle Cambrian aged Ardrarum Limestone Formation which outcrops on the island of Bornholm in the Baltic Sea.The Paleobiology database \\"At Olea\\" entry accessed 9 January 2012 During the Cambrian Bornholm was a segment of ocean floor off the coast of the paleocontinet Baltica. The species was proposed by Berg- Madsen in 1987. The family Tuarangiidae and the order Tuarangiida were first proposed by MacKinnon in his 1982 paper on the genus. Since that description, the superfamily Tuarangiacea, which MacKinnon also proposed has been dropped from use. Tuarangiidae is now placed directly into the order Tuarangiida and the order is placed into the bivalve evolutionary grade Euprotobranchia. This puts Tuarangiida as a sister taxon to the order Fordillida. Euprotobranchia includes the earliest confirmed crown group bivalves to have been described, with Tuarangia being one of only four accepted bivalve genera to have been described from the Cambrian, the other three being Fordilla, Pojetaia, and Camya.

Richard Barthelmess stars in a role for which Griffith had screentested Rudolph Valentino.The American Film Institute Catalog Feature Films: 1911-20 by The American Film Institute, c. 1988 In today's time, this film is considered by many to be one of Griffith's worst films though it might have worked better as a short film. This film was unlike others created by D.W. Griffith. According to an article written for the \\"Cincinnati Inquirer\\", written on the 16 of November 1919: \\"Unlike other recent Griffith production, Scarlet Days is a story of the old West, of the gold rush days of 49- Bret Harte transferred to the screen!\\" The Western film genre was expanding at this time and Scarlet Days fits into this category. Western films were popular for this time. Considered a lost film, a print was found in the State Film Archives of the Soviet Union, which donated it to the Museum of Modern Art in 1969. The film was screened to the public, for the first time since its rediscovery, on March 24th and 25th, 1969. Scarlet Days was shown alongside another missing film, A Romance of Happy Valley, at the Museum of Modern Art's auditorium with titles still printed in Russian. English titles were later created by the Department of Film at the Museum of Modern Art. Plot As described in a film magazine, Rosie Nell (Besserer), a woman of dance halls in early lawless California, is wrongly charged with the murder of one of her fellow entertainers. Because her daughter (Dempster), who knows nothing of her mother's station in life, is to return the next day from her school in the east, Rosie is granted three days of grace to be spent in company with her daughter at a nearby cabin. The three days pass happily, but King Bagley (Long), manager of the dance hall, has seen the daughter and determined to make her his own. The women barricade themselves in the cabin to resist capture and Alvarez (Barthelmess), a young outlaw with considerable local prestige, comes to their assistance. John Randolph (Graves), who also loves the young woman, joins the fight on their side, which ends with the timely arrival of the Sheriff (Fawcett). This results in a happy ending.

Many news sources in 1919 published review articles complimenting and comparing Scarlet Days to other films created by D.W.Griffith. News outlets such as the \\"New-York Tribune\\", \\"San Francisco Chronicle\\", \\"Cincinnati Enquirer\\", and more were including reviews on Scarlet Days as well as announcing local showtimes for this film. A review article from the \\"Cincinnati Enquirer\\" stated that: \\"The latest D.W. Griffith production soon will be ready for local release. Griffith as usual has assembled a sparkling cast for his new picture.\\" Scarlet Days traveled across the country to show in various theaters after its release date on November 9, 1919. Prior to the actual showing, news articles would be released to inform readers of short plot summaries and events in the production. On an opposing view written for \\"Variety\\" magazine wrote on Scarlet Days negatively, and claimed that: \\"Scarlet Days as a story was not worthy of Griffith's direction in picturization. It is entire too commonplace.\\" For current day moviegoers, this film is one of the least popular of D.W. Griffith's directed pictures. Scarlet Days was considered to be made too late in the era where Western films were becoming popular. Though some new sources gave positive feedback in response to the release of this film, opposing viewpoints claimed that: \\"Outside of [the lack of plot depth] there is nothing more to say except that it is a surprise that Griffith should at this late date take to filming rip- snorting Western mellers with a lot of harum-scarum rough stuff with gunplay.\\" References External links Scarlet Days ; AllMovie/synopsis * Scarlet Days free download at Internet Archive *Lobby poster *Film stills at silenthollywood.com *DVD availability at Oldies.com and Grapevine Video Category:1919 films Category:American silent feature films Category:American films Category:1919 Western (genre) films Category:Films directed by D.

He was in Louisiana throughout the early years of the 20th Century. He became a noted aviation owner of the Wedell-Williams Air Service Corporation that dominated air racing in the United States during the so- called Golden Age of Aviation. Early years Williams was born on October 6, 1889 in Patterson, Louisiana to Francis Bennett Williams and Emily Williamson Seyburn. His father was a prominent Louisiana industrialist and civic leader, career paths that his son would later follow. Williams was educated at Lawrenceville Academy, Lawrenceville, New Jersey and at the University of the South, Sewanee, Tennessee. In 1906, like his brothers, he entered his father's lumber business with his first job was operating a dredge in south Louisiana swamps for $50 a month. In World War I, he served as a lieutenant in the Engineers Corps. After the war, Williams became active in politics, becoming the Mayor of Patterson, as well as serving as the president of police jury in St. Mary Parish and state highway commissioner. Business career Williams' business interests were also an area where he was prominent, as president of the Patterson State Bank, director of the St. Bernard Cypress Co. and treasurer of the Franklin and Abbeville Railway Co. He also served as a director of the Williams, Inc. and F. B.

Retrieved: January 9, 2012. Aviation career In the late 1920s, the St. Bernard Cypress Co. lumber operation was being wound up, and Williams began to explore other options, first concentrating on a personal interest in speed boats. In 1927, spurred by the news of the Lindbergh solo flight across the Atlantic, he had purchased a similar Ryan monoplane from Jimmy Wedell, a noted race pilot. After working closely with Wedell in learning to fly, Williams formed a partnership with Wedell and his brother, Walter Wedell, that was realized in the formation of Wedell-Williams Air Service Corporation in 1928, based in Patterson. While Wedell provided the \\"seat-of-his-pants\\" design ingenuity coupled with Williams' business acumen and a reported $2 million-dollar stake, the two friends formed a strong bond. The Wedell-Williams Air Service Corporation provided a passenger service from New Orleans to Houston, Louisiana's first commercial airline and also started their own postal air service, as well as operating a flying school. Continuing his earlier work as a designer, Wedell had a factory built to design and build low-wing monoplanes, starting with the Wedell-Williams Model 22, proceeding through the more successful Model 44 and ultimately, the Model 45.\\"Jimmie Wedell.\\" Texas City Library.

In 1934, Wedell was involved in not only air racing but also exhibition flying and even flight training where he was killed in an accident on June 24, 1934. Wedell's death garnered national attention, and was a major blow to the Wedell-Williams Air Service Corporation, but Williams was willing to step up his involvement.\\"Death of Jimmie Wedell.\\" Louisiana State Museum.

The loss of Williams, along with the recent deaths in air crashes of both Wedell brothers who had co- founded the company along with the company test pilot, led his wife, Marguerite Clark Williams, to sell the assets of the company in 1937 to Eastern Air Lines.

In her 2010 solo exhibition, Dissonance at Hollins University‚Äôs Eleanor D. Wilson Art Museum, Frederick referenced the atomic bomb and the Cold War, themes that have often surfaced in her work. Her 1996 installation Caution: Appearance (Dis)appearance explored the significance of the atomic bomb fifty years after its first detonation. In this installation, Frederick, who was born shortly before the first testing of the atomic bomb, examined her own personal connection with the bomb and how it has impacted her life, as well as its implications for the natural world.Protzman, Ferdinand. ‚ÄúA fusion of nuclear reactions.‚Äù The Washington Post.

He has been working in the Paleontological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences since 1987. Doctor of biological sciences, Senior Research Professor of the Paleontological Institute, RAS. Professor of the RAS. During the Phanerozoic the biodiversity shows a steady but not monotonic increase from near zero to several thousands of genera. In collaboration with Andrey Korotayev he has demonstrated that a rather simple mathematical model can be developed to describe in a rather accurate way the macrotrends of biological evolution. They have shown that changes in biodiversity through the Phanerozoic correlate much better with hyperbolic model (widely used in demography and macrosociology) than with exponential and logistic models (traditionally used in population biology and extensively applied to fossil biodiversity as well). The latter models imply that changes in diversity are guided by a first-order positive feedback (more ancestors, more descendants) and/or a negative feedback arising from resource limitation. Hyperbolic model implies a second- order positive feedback. The hyperbolic pattern of the world population growth has been demonstrated by Korotayev to arise from a second-order positive feedback between the population size and the rate of technological growth. According to Markov and Korotayev, the hyperbolic character of biodiversity growth can be similarly accounted for by a feedback between the diversity and community structure complexity. They suggest that the similarity between the curves of biodiversity and human population probably comes from the fact that both are derived from the interference of the hyperbolic trend with cyclical and stochastic dynamics.

Biography  Arshi Pipa was born in 1920 in Shkod√´r and attended school there until 1938. Pipa received a BA equivalent degree (\\"Laurea\\") in philosophy at the University of Florence in 1942. After he completed his studies he was a teacher of Italian language in different schools in Albania. He was imprisoned for ten years (1946‚Äì56) in Communist Albania because he antagonized the communist regime with his recitation of a verse from a \\"Song of the Flea\\" by Goethe found in a translation of Faust. After he was released from prison (his original sentence was 20 years, but after amnesty it was cut to 10) he escaped to Yugoslavia and lived in Sarajevo during the period 1957‚Äì9. In 1959 he emigrated to the United States where he taught at Adelphi College, Georgetown University, Columbia University, and UC Berkeley. Then, from 1966 to 1989, he was a professor of Italian literature in the Department of Romance Languages at the University of Minnesota. Pipa died in Washington DC on July 20, 1997.  Work  The first poetry Pipa composed in late 1930, Lund√´rtar√´ [Seamen], was published in Tirana in 1944. When he was in prison he thought out and actually wrote some parts of his best-known collection of poems, Libri i burgut [The Prison Book], published in 1959. His epic poem Rusha (1968), composed in 1955 during his imprisonment, describes love between Albanians and Serbs in the late 14th century. Pipa claimed that the unification of the Albanian language was wrong because it deprived Albanian language of its richness at the expense of Gheg. He called the unified literary Albanian language a \\"monstrosity\\" produced by the Tosk communist leadership, who conquered anti-communist north Albania and imposed their Tosk Albanian dialect on the Ghegs.

History Uthira Kosa Mangai is a tiny hamlet, known for the Siva temple considered to be 3000 years old. It is considered to be one of the very ancient Hindu temples which Tamil literature describes as \\"Mann Mundhiyo Mangai Mundhiyo?\\" meaning \\"Did the mud (mann) come first or is the Mangai(The Female Deity of the Temple)?\\". This is the place where Siva transferred the secrets of Vedas to Parvati. Uthiram means (updesham) kosam (secrets) Parvati (Mangai) hence this place is known as Uthira Kosa Mangai. The main deity here is Mangalanathar ( Siva) and his consort is Mangleshwari. There is a Nandi just outside the sanctum and a bigger Nandi in the outer prakaram known here as Pradosha Nandi. Special poojas are conducted here on Pradosham days in the evenings as it is believed that Siva dances between the horns of Nandi during that time. There are also shrines for Kalabhairavar and Sanishwarar here. Each pillar in this temple has carvings and the ceiling is painted in myriad hues. The main attraction of this temple is a statue of Natarajar made of emerald which is about 51/2 feet tall. This idol is known as Margatha Natarajar and the deity is always covered with sandal paste. Only in the Tamil month of Margazhi on Tiruvathira nakshtram (latest was on 17 December 2013) the sandal paste gets removed and there is abhishekam for the idol and this special darshan is known as Arudhra darishanam. Lakhs of devotees visit the temple on this day and on the next day again the idol gets smeared with sandal paste. To have a darshan of this deity, one must be there around 12.00 noon on regular days. On the way to Natarajar temple one can find other sub shrines dedicated to Sahasra Lingam, which has thousands of tiny Lingams carved on a single Shiva Linga and a separate shrine for Manikka Vasagar(the saint poet who was a regular visitor to this temple) near the Agnitheertham (tank). The sthala vricksham is also considered as old as the temple. The base of this tree has a huge hollow in which images of serpents can be found. Sri Vedavyasa's Paaduka are placed under the old tree in the temple premises. Transportation The nearest airport is Madurai.

Family and education Janko was born on May 30, 1955, the descendant of an Austro-Hungarian revolutionary who left Vienna in 1848 to find refuge in London. Janko was educated at Bedford Modern School\\"School of the Black and Red, A History of Bedford Modern School\\" by Andrew Underwood (1981), reset and updated by Peter Boon, Paul Middleton and Richard Wildman, 2010 and won a scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge. With the encouragement of his parents, an electrician and a shopkeeper, he learned Greek from Andrew M. Wilson, who translated Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. As a student he took part in the British excavations at Agios Stephanos in Laconia, directed by Lord William Taylour, and wrote a doctoral dissertation under John Chadwick. He was elected a Research Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge. Scholarship Janko's scholarship has focused primarily upon Bronze Age Greece, archaic Greek epic, especially the Iliad of Homer, ancient literary criticism, especially the \\"Poetics\\" of Aristotle, early Greek religion and philosophy (especially Empedocles, Orphism, and the Derveni papyrus), and the reconstruction of ancient books on papyrus-rolls. His study of epic diction, Homer, Hesiod and the Hymns, established by a statistical study of language the relative chronology of the corpus of early Greek epic poetry. Janko published a controversial book Aristotle on Comedy, arguing that a summary of the lost second book of Aristotle's Poetics on comedy and humour survives in a tenth-century manuscript in Paris, the Tractatus Coislinianus. This was shortly followed by an annotated translation of Aristotle's Poetics itself. He wrote the volume on Homer's Iliad 13-16 in the set of commentaries on Homer's Iliad edited by Geoffrey Kirk; in this he argues that Homer was a consummate artist of oral poetry.. Janko was awarded a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Fellowship in 1986. In 1993 he delivered the Martin Classical Lectures on ancient literary criticism at Oberlin College.Richard Janko, Curriculum Vitae; History of the Martin Classical Lectures at Oberlin College. His edition and translation of Philodemus' On Poems Book 1, reconstructed from a series of Herculaneum papyri, was awarded the Goodwin Award of Merit by the American Philological Association in 2001.List of Goodwin Award winners at the APA website. In 2008 he brought out the site-report of the excavations at the Bronze Age and Medieval settlement of Ayios Stephanos in Laconia; these excavations do much to clarify relations between Minoan Crete and the Mycenaean mainland. In 2011 he published Philodemus' On Poems Books 3 and 4, which contains fragments of Aristotle's lost dialog On Poets. University positions Janko is currently the Gerald F. Else Distinguished University Professor of Classical Studies at the University of Michigan.University of Michigan, Department of Classical Studies faculty directory. He has previously held positions at St. Andrews University, Columbia University, UCLA and University College London, where he was Professor of Greek. He has held Visiting Professorships at the Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa and at the American School of Classical Studies in Athens.

The journey between St Benedict's Square and Bracebridge was covered in 20 minutes, and consisted of two stages of one penny each (Cranwell House, near St. Botoph's Church, being the intermediate point). In 1901 the directors of the company introduced half-penny fares for workmen, which brought about a dramatic increase in patronage. Vehicles There were 10 tramcars according to an inventory of 1903.

The USGS Library has major branches in Reston, Virginia (National Headquarters), Lakewood, Colorado (Denver Federal Center), and Menlo Park, California.

U.S. Geological Survey Library Classification System The newly revised classification system presented in this report is designed for use in the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Library and other earth science libraries. Prior to the administration of Fred Boughton Weeks, 1903‚Äì1908, the library lacked a classification scheme. The Dewey Decimal system for geologic material was not sufficiently developed to accommodate the range of specialized material collected at the USGS Library, and The Library of Congress Classification System had not yet been published. The library staff and patrons were concerned about continued development of the collection without an acceptable classification scheme. Mr. Weeks and bibliographer John M. Nickles of the library staff, with the assistance of three consultants from the New York Public Library, developed the USGS classification system designed specifically for an earth science library. The U.S. Geological Survey Library classification system has been designed for earth science libraries. It is a tool for assigning call numbers to earth science and allied pure science materials in order to collect these materials into related subject groups on the library shelves and arrange them alphabetically by author and title. The classification can be used as a retrieval system to access materials through the subject and geographic numbers. The classification scheme has been developed over the years since 1904 to meet the ever-changing needs of increased specialization and the development of new areas of research in the earth sciences.Sasscer, R.

The majority of the collection dates from 1879 and relates to work done in the contiguous United States. Materials in the collection represent almost 130 years of scientific investigations by the USGS, from the earliest days of the agency to recently completed projects. Records contributed by approximately 1,200 USGS scientists are presently archived. Located in the Central Region Library in Denver, Colorado, the collection is available for on-premises examination during normal library hours. Field records and project archives on Alaska are kept in the Alaska Technical Data Unit Field Records Archive. Rare Books and Maps The Rare Book Collection of the USGS Library comprises unusual publications, rare books, and maps collected since 1879. Included are historical maps and publications of the Survey, as well as early publications of many federal, state and other geological surveys. Records of select geological societies are also maintained in the collection, such as the Geological Society of Washington, which was founded by John Wesley Powell and other noted scientists after the Civil War. Of special note are many 19th century maps with topics such as American political boundaries, transportation, geology, and mining. Desnoyers Collection At an auction in Paris, France, pieces of M. Jules Desnoyers's (1800‚Äì1887) library were purchased in 1885 by the USGS Library to start the foreign country collection. M.

His works include Adventure Is Underground (1959), Caves of California (1962), Caves of Washington (1963), Depths of the Earth (1966), Caves and Cavers of the United States (1966), American Caves and Caving (1974), Discovery and Exploration of the Oregon Caves: Oregon Caves National Monument (with Frank K. Walsh; 1976) and, Floyd Collins of Sand Cave: A Photographic Memorial (1998). He donated his private collection of rare and out-of-print books and pamphlets on caves, caving and speleology to the USGS Library in 2000. Dr. Halliday has also donated several collections of private papers, correspondence and research to the University of Washington Library and to the J. Willard Marriott Library of the University of Utah. Kunz Collection In 1933, the Library acquired the George F. Kunz collection for $1.00 from the estate of the former USGS employee and Vice-President of Tiffany & Co. The George F. Kunz Collection is a significant special collection on gems and minerals including rare books on gemology, the folklore of gemstones through history, lapidary arts and archival gem trade records important to the provenance of named stones such as the \\"Hope Diamond.\\" Kunz was a former USGS employee, a vice-president of Tiffany & Co., and one of the world's preeminent gem experts. The collection was acquired through the genroisty of Dr. Kunz's heirs, Mrs. Opal Kunz and Mrs. Hans Zinsser. Mr. Walter E. Reid, mining consultant and strong friend of the library, was largely instrumental in securing the Kunz collection.Heers, William H. 1937. \\"The U.S. Geological Survey Library.\\" The Mineralogist. Volume V (6), pages 3‚Äì4, 27. \\"The George F. Kunz Collection is a significant special collection of many rare books, pamphlets, and other unique materials on the acquisition, collecting and lore of jewels and precious stones. Acquired by the US Geological Survey Library in 1933 after the death of George F. Kunz, a noted mineralogist and vice- president of the Tiffany & Co. of New York, the Kunz Collection today is fairly unknown outside of a small circle of gemologists, historians, and art collectors. In this paper, a short biography of George F. Kunz is given, as well as a description of the contents and scope of his collection held in the USGS Library. Some examples of the unique materials held in the collection are shown. How the Kunz Collection is used by library patrons and museums is also discussed. Appended to the paper is a bibliography of the works by and about Dr. Kunz.\\"Hadden, Robert Lee. \\"George F. Kunz Collection.\\" Denver, Colorado: Geoscience Information Society, 34th annual meeting, 1999. Includes bibliographic references (p. 142‚Äì146). Paper presented to the Geological Society of America Annual Convention in Denver, CO. Map Collection The library's map collections have provided invaluable aid to authorities and scientists in times of crisis (the California Northridge earthquake in 1994 and major fires in the nation's forests). Topographic maps have also been used for genealogy research to pinpoint where ancestors lived, locate forgotten cemeteries, provide information on boundary changes, and research natural and man-made changes to areas over time. Planners have used the foreign map collections to study foreign terrain, geologic conditions and natural resources. During WWII, The New York Times (June 11, 1944) reported \\"A 'Commando' raid by a group of civilian scientists, a search through obscure seventeenth century French manuscripts, months of study of geological reports, experiments with model beaches ‚Äì all these were part of the Allied preparations for the invasion of Normandy ‚Ä¶ The dramatic story of the preparations, which began in ‚Ä¶ libraries, shifted to laboratories and ended on the shell-swept beaches ‚Ä¶\\". The collections were consulted for the military interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq. Library maps have provided aid in international disaster areas such as the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch and volcanoes worldwide. A brief mention of a diamond found in the 1906 annual report of the USGS began a trail of research and investigation that led one geologist to prospect for diamonds in Canada. Topographic Map Archive Responsibility for the Topographic Map Archive was formally transferred to the USGS Library in Reston, Virginia, in March 2003. The Archive includes each U.S. state and territory, in all scales, editions and various printings. With coverage dating from the 1880s when the USGS began publishing standard topographic quadrangles; the Archive is the most complete collection of USGS topographic maps. Heringen Collection The Heringen Collection, is a group of military texts and maps, looted by the Nazis from European libraries, universities, geological societies, private businesses, homes and offices. Hidden in a potash mine in Heringen, Hesse, Germany, they were transported by the U.S. military at the end of WWII as captured war materials. Some 23,000 reports, books and maps were accepted by the USGS Library and integrated into the main collection. The materials are consulted for research ranging from European road development, water resources use or mining and construction. In 1946, the Heringen Collection was transferred from the U.S. Geological Survey's Military Geology Unit to the Library.Hadden, Robert Lee. \\"The Heringen Collection.\\" Information Bulletin. Western Association of Map Libraries (WAML). Volume 40 (1), November 2008. . Page 15. In an article published in journal, Earth Sciences History, the author says that the results of the German theft of Russian maps influenced the way they made maps for the next two generations. \\"The Heringen Collection at the US Geological Survey is a special collection of maps, books and reports stolen by units of the German Wehrmacht (armed forces) as they invaded and occupied countries during World War II. The materials in the Collection came from private, society and public library collections, and were used by military geologists in each German army to help protect its soldiers, to advance their invasion, and to consolidate their occupation. They used the maps of the occupied countries against their peoples. For a generation after the invasion of the Soviet Union, this influenced the way Russian maps were drawn and printed.\\"Hadden, Robert Lee. \\"The Heringen Collection of the US Geological Survey Library of Reston, Virginia.\\" Earth Sciences History, Volume 27, Number 2. Page 242. United States Antarctic Resource Center The U.S. Antarctic Resource Center (USARC) was located at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in Reston, Va. It maintained the nation's most comprehensive collection of Antarctic aerial photography, maps, charts, satellite imagery and technical reports. When operational, it was a joint effort of the USGS National Mapping Division and the National Science Foundation United States Antarctic Program. The USARC collection includes materials produced by the following Antarctic Treaty nations: Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Chile, China, Ecuador, Finland, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, the Republic of Korea, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Peru, Poland, the Russian Federation, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Uruguay. For further information or assistance in obtaining Antarctic information, contact the USGS Library. USGS Photographic Collection The Photographic Library is an archive of still photographs and original sketches dating from the 1870s and taken by USGS scientists as part of their field studies. Topics include USGS personnel, earthquakes, volcanoes, geologic hazards and other phenomena, historical mining operations, and earth science photographs. The works of pioneer photographers such as William Henry Jackson, Timothy H. O'Sullivan, Carleton Watkins, John Karl Hillers, Thomas Moran, Andrew J. Russell, E. O. Beaman and William Bell (photographer) are represented in the collection. Some photographs have been used to illustrate publications, but most have never been published. History Congress authorized a Library for the United States Geological Survey (USGS) in 1879. The library was formally established in 1882, with the naming of the first librarian, Charles C. Darwin, and began with a staff of 3 and a collection of 1,400 books. The Act of Congress establishing the USGS authorized the creation of a program for exchanging copies of USGS reports for publications of state, national, and international organizations. The exchange program was modeled after a program used by Dr. Ferdinand V. Hayden when he was head of the Interior Department's U.S. Geological and Geographical Survey of the Territories (1867‚Äì1879). The U.S. Geological Survey Library inherited 1,000 volumes of serials from Dr. Hayden's former exchange program, which he had based on the program begun by the Smithsonian Institution in 1846. After Dr. Hayden died in 1887, his widow donated his personal collection to the U.S. Geological Survey Library. Other early gifts were made by Major John Wesley Powell, second Director of the US Geological Survey, who donated his collection of State Geological Survey reports and the family of Dr. Isaac Lea (Philadelphia publisher and gem collector whose family donated nearly 600 items of his personal library). Dr. William Halliday, a world-renowned speleologist began donating his cave collection in 2003. In a review of the USGS Library operations in 1937, William Heers, the Chief Librarian, noted that the library had more than 200,000 books and reports, about 60,000 pamphlets, and also about 60,000 maps, most of these obtained by gift and exchange. Fully half of those researchers who used the library were outside of the US Geological Survey. In service to those outside the government, between 8,000‚Äì10,000 books were loaned out each year through interlibrary loans, both within the continental US and overseas.Heers, William H. 1937. \\"The U.S. Geological Survey Library.\\" The Mineralogist. Volume V (6), pages 3‚Äì4. In a review of the USGS Library during its centennial, it was noted that in 1978 the library had acquired nearly 116,000 new items. About 75% of these were journals, of which 10,000 serial, magazine, and other periodical titles were received. In 1978, the library also circulated 105,000 items, made 17,700 interlibrary loans and answered some 27,000 requests for information.\\"Books, Maps...\\" Geotimes. March 1979. Page 35. In March 2012, the USGS Library joined the Biodiversity Heritage LibraryPress Release: Biodiversity Heritage Library Adds Two Partners. Smithsonian Libraries. March 5, 2012 with the goal of contributing important historical works related to taxonomy as well as relevant USGS publications. The U.S. Geological Survey Library system has become the largest earth science library in the world. Materials within the library system include books and maps dating back to the 16th and 17th centuries. Other materials include a nearly complete set of the various State Geological Survey publications and a virtually complete set of USGS topographic maps. The original collection was based on exchange partnerships with domestic and international scientific organizations. List of USGS Library Chief Librarians *1882‚Äì1902 Charles C.

While in Webtop mode, the phone, operating with a similar UI to one which might be found on a typical GNU/Linux desktop, can run several applications on external display such as Firefox web browser, SNS clients and 'mobile view' application enabling total access of Droid 4 and its screen. In September 2011, Motorola released the source code of Webtop application at SourceForge. With the release of Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich for the Droid 4, the Webtop application has been replaced. Instead of the Ubuntu-based interface and applications, the Droid 4 switches to ICS's tablet mode. This allows seamless access to all of the phone's applications without moving back and forth between two user interfaces.  Updates  The Droid 4 originally came with Android 2.3 \\"Gingerbread\\" out of the box, however, Motorola gradually updated the handset to Android 4.0 \\"Ice Cream Sandwich\\" and then finally to Android 4.1 \\"Jelly Bean\\". Motorola has also released regular maintenance updates from time to time.  Unofficial  LineageOS support exists and is currently being maintained by the community, with LineageOS 14.1 (Android 7.1.2 \\"Nougat\\") being the latest official port for the device.https://download.lineageos.org/maserati Currently there is an ongoing effort to port mainline Linux to the phone, with most of the devices already supported except for voice calls and the cameras. http://elektranox.org/droid4/ Work is being done to make the Droid 4 supported by Maemo Leste.

Black Day for the Ram) is a 1971 Italian giallo film directed by Luigi Bazzoni. The film's Italian title reprises Dario Argento's practice of using animals in the titles of his thriller films. The film is based on a novel with the same name by D.M. Devine.  Plot  \\"Mr. Bild\\" is a reporter with a drinking problem who is assigned to investigate an assault in a tunnel. In the meantime, a number of murders begin to pile up in which the killer is leaving a black glove with digits cut off to symbolize the number of people he has killed. The speculation is that the first victim was not killed due to the intervention of a couple making out near the tunnel, but now the killer has returned to finish killing his victims. The police have no clues, but as Mr. Bild gets closer and closer to the truth, the police begin to suspect him, his newspaper tries to take him off the story, and the killer makes threatening phone calls. More people are killed however, until the killer tries to kill his son and Mr. Bild intervenes, catching the real murderer red-handed.

McGillivray commented that the film had too many \\"red herrings\\" to make up for the films \\"meagre characterisation, the scrambled course of its plot, or its shamefully deceptive ending.\\" McGillivray stated later that Bazzoni's \\"briskly paced direction (combined with the efforts of the British censor) contrives to sweep it all under the carpet as quickly as possible.\\" AllMovie called it an \\"outstanding giallo thriller\\". Marina Antunes for the Alliance of Women Film Journalists while conceding that \\"Sometimes it‚Äôs just a bit too much and even the most astute viewer is likely to get lost among some of the weeds,\\" praised the cinematography and Nero's acting, finally concluding that \\"While it sometimes loses its way, in the end The Fifth Cord comes together in an entertaining, occasionally awe-inspiring package that stands the test of time as a fine example of the giallo genre.\\"  References  External links * Category:1971 films Category:Italian films Category:Giallo films Category:Italian crime thriller films Category:1970s crime thriller films Category:Films about journalists Category:Films directed by Luigi Bazzoni Category:Films scored by Ennio Morricone Category:Films set in Rome ","title":"The Fifth Cord"},{"id":"34330286","title":"1950 Liechtenstein weapons law referendum"},{"id":"34330290","text":"Benjamin Hough (1773 - September 4, 1819) was the second State Auditor of the U.S. State of Ohio from 1808 to 1815.

For Atran, the mission of Ashkenazi Zionism in Palestine is a form of ‚Äúsurrogate colonialism‚Äù because it was forged based on a strategic consensus with the ruling British Empire. This surrogate colonialism, Atran further notes, is one of the major contributing factors to the Balfour Declaration, which made possible and legitimate Zionist settlement in Palestine. Sociologist Ran Greenstein claims both Zionist settlement in Palestine and white settlement in South Africa are example for surrogate colonization, for in both the majority of settlers did not come from the ranks of the principal colonizing power of the time: the British Empire in the case of Israel/Palestine, or the Dutch Empire and later the British empire, in the case of South Africa. In other academic and non-academic settings, the term has been adopted more loosely, and used figuratively to describe different forms of indirect domination, especially in post-colonial context. For one, it has been used to refer to the compliance of native rulers with the dominance of foreign power. Thus for example, Kiangi uses it to describe African wars fought by African leaders but instigated from former colonial masters. In his analysis of Arab regimes in the Middle East, Dr. Mohammad Manzoor Alam claims that even so-called ‚Äúrejectionist‚Äù rulers which openly declared hostility to Western dominance, were in fact exemplifying ‚Äúsurrogate‚Äù or ‚Äúinternal‚Äù colonialism, for they have been silently compliant with Western rule. Similarly, Editor of the Indian Defence Review, Bharat Verma, blamed the Chinese government for treating Pakistan ‚Äúas an extension of its war machine and a surrogate colony‚Äù. ‚ÄúSurrogate Colonism‚Äù has also been used to describe Neocolonialism. In a speech at the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development conference in Belgrade, 1983, Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi said: :\\"I am a soul in agony. As one who feels passionately about freedom, I cannot but be alarmed at the continuing pushing domination, the new methods and forms of colonialism. This is all the more pernicious because less obvious and recognizable. Except for a few places, the visible presence of foreign rule has gone. We are free to run our affairs and yet, are we not bound by a new type, a surrogate colonialism? How else shall we describe the power of and the pressure exerted through the monopoly control of capital; the withholding of superior technology; the political use of grain; the manipulation of information, so subtle and subliminal in influencing minds and attitudes? Is it not time for us to pause from our daily concerns to ponder over the new dependency? Instead of reacting, should we the developing not think of acting on our own?\\" References Category:Colonialism ","title":"Surrogate Colonialism"},{"id":"34330310","title":"1952 Liechtenstein insurance referendum"},{"id":"34330319","text":"Journey of the Three Kings (1825) Leopold Kupelwieser (17 October 1796, Markt Piesting ‚Äì 17 November 1862, Vienna) was an Austrian painter, often associated with the Nazarene movement. Life He was the son of Johann Baptist Georg Kilian Kupelwieser (1760‚Äì1813), co-owner of a factory that produced tableware.Eva Wald: Die Anf√§nge der Industrie des Wiener Beckens und ihre geographischen Grundlagen. Vienna University dissertation, 1954, Permalink √ñsterreichischer Bibliothekenverbund, pg. 221. His talents were recognized at an early age by the sculptor Franz Anton von Zauner and by the time he was twelve, he was already attending the Academy of Fine Arts, Vienna. During a stay in Rome in 1824, he came under the influence of Friedrich Overbeck and the Nazarene movement. After the death of , a Russian nobleman who had been his patron there, he returned to Vienna and earned his living primarily as an illustrator and portrait painter, although he is also known to have painted shop signs. His brother was the theatrical director Joseph Kupelwieser, who wrote the libretto for Schubert's opera Fierrabras. With his brother, Joseph, he was a member of the \\"Schubertianern\\" (friends of Franz Schubert), a group that often got together for summers at the Schloss Atzenbrugg, west of Vienna. In 1826, Leopold married Maria Johanna Evangelista Augustina Stephania Theodora Lutz, an occasion which was marked by Schubert's composition, the \\"Kupelwieser Waltz\\" (never written down, but passed along by the family and later transcribed by Richard Strauss). In 1837, he became Professor of history painting at the Academy and, in 1850, was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Order of Franz Joseph. Virtually all of his later work involved religious altarpieces and frescoes. At the age of sixty he fell ill, apparently due to the rigors of painting on wet lime, and never recovered his health. Legacy In 1894, a street was named in his honor and a commemorative stamp was issued in 1996. He is a character in Das Dreim√§derlhaus (House of the Three Girls, 1916), a pastiche operetta, derived from the music of Schubert by Heinrich Bert√©, based on the novel Schwammerl (Mushroom, one of Schubert's nicknames) by Rudolf Hans Bartsch. Kupelwieser is honoured in street names in his birthplace (Kupelwieserstra√üe in Markt Piesting), Kupelwiesergasse in Hietzing, Vienna and in the Austrian towns of Wiener Neustadt, St. P√∂lten and Atzenbrugg.

It was first broadcast on March 26, 1973, and airs on CBS. The following is a list of characters that first appeared in 2010, by order of appearance. All characters were introduced to the series by its head writer that year, Maria Arena Bell. Doppelg√§nger Sarah Smythe first appeared in April. June saw the arrival of Meggie McClaine, Spencer Walsh and twin characters, Charles and Matilda Ashby, born on-screen. Vance Abrams and Sofia Dupre debuted in July, followed by Blake Joseph's stint beginning in October. Colin Atkinson made his debut in December. Sarah Smythe Sarah Smythe first appeared on April 19, 2010, portrayed by Tracey E. Bregman, who also portrays Lauren Baldwin, of whom Sarah is a doppelg√§nger. Sarah is the sister of Sheila Carter, Lauren's longtime nemesis. The character's creation was first announced in early April 2010. In an interview with TV Guide Magazine actress Tracey E. Bregman stated \\"I think it‚Äôd be too easy to kill Lauren. Sarah really wants Lauren to suffer because Sarah has suffered so much. In Sarah‚Äôs mind, Sheila was murdered in cold blood by Lauren. Also, Sarah had to raise Sheila‚Äôs children because Sheila was always so obsessed with Lauren that she wasn‚Äôt around to raise her kids properly.\\" Bregman also noted that Sarah was \\"setting up this revenge\\" and was as powerful as Sheila. Sarah mysteriously arrived in town with her niece, Daisy, and her nephew, Ryder, to torture Lauren Fenmore months before revealing her face, to avenge her sister's death. Daisy, Ryder and Sarah kidnapped Lauren and locked her in a cage. When Sarah revealed herself to Lauren, she was revealed to have had plastic surgery to look exactly like Lauren, who thought Sarah was really Sheila. Sarah wanted revenge on Lauren for killing Sheila. Sarah planned to take over Lauren's life with her husband Michael Baldwin (Christian LeBlanc) and her young son Fenmore, but it wasn't so easy because Michael and Fenmore were suspicious. While Sarah was in Genoa City posing as Lauren, Michael sent her to therapist Dr. Emily Peterson (who was really Patty Williams). During their first session, Sarah saw right away that \\"Emily\\" was really Patty and became reacquainted with her by reminding her they previously met as they were friends in a South American plastic surgery office when Patty had cosmetic surgery to look like Emily. The two then conspired to help each other in continuing their deceitful impersonations of Emily and Lauren. When Ryder turned on Sarah and let Lauren free, Sarah chased Lauren into a house of mirrors and Sarah, who was about to shoot Phyllis Newman who was also there, was shot and killed by Lauren, leading Daisy and Ryder to escape and evade custody. In June 2017, Sheila Carter reappears in Los Angeles, revealing herself to Quinn Fuller. Meggie McClaine Meggie McClaine first appeared on June 8, 2010, portrayed by actress, Sean Young. Her casting was announced by multiple sources in April 2010. On her casting and getting the role, Young said: \\"Getting the chance to work with my dear friend Eric Braeden, one of the true gentlemen in entertainment, was certainly a deciding factor for me as well as wanting to get back to work after taking a few years off to raise my kids.\\" Young had previously worked with Braeden (Victor Newman) in a film The Man Who Came Back. When introduced, Meggie is described as \\"a feisty barmaid who is involved in a mystery with Victor Newman.\\" Young also described her character as being \\"Spunky!\\". In the same interview, Young stated that her character was \\"Kindhearted\\" however the character proved ultimately opposite. In an interview with TV Guide Magazine, Young said \\"Meggie‚Äôs not very sophisticated. She wears an apron and a plaid shirt. She breaks up a bar brawl. She reminds me of Joan Blondell in that old TV series Here Come the Brides. I just sort of walk onto a set that way. ‚ÄúSultry‚Äù was their description. [Laughs] I just call it me.\\" Initially a guest role only appearing for a 5-episode stint, Young returned to The Young and the Restless in July 2010, and Entertainment Weekly reported that she would stay until August, however her storyline ended in October 2010. She returned in February 2011, with brief appearances until March 2011, with the character still being jailed at the time. Sean Young (pictured) played the scheming con-artist, Meggie. Meggie McClaine was a Canadian barmaid whom Victor Newman met while searching for his invidious son, Adam Newman, who faked his own death. Meggie helped Victor by handling a few customers at the bar that Victor needed information from. He promised Meggie that if she ever needed something that she could come to him as a repayment for her services to him. She tried to flirt with Victor, but he made it clear that he already had a special lady in his life, Nikki Newman, and he left Ottawa. Meggie picked up on Victor's offer only a few weeks later when she appeared on his doorstep and told him that she had to flee. As a well-known business tycoon, Victor did a background check on Meggie, but he did not find anything that would lead him to believe that she was using him. Meggie began to work for Victor's fianc√©e, Nikki, as an assistant to her charity work, and she also became the right hand for planning the couple's wedding. When Meggie found out that Nikki was an alcoholic and has been sober for over a decade, she used this information to her advantage. She began to spike Nikki's drinks with vodka. When Meggie got an assignment to bring a check from Victor to Katherine Chancellor, she met an old acquaintance in Katherine's husband, Patrick Murphy. Murphy planned to warn Nikki and Victor about her, but he suffered a heart attack in front of Meggie because she prevented him from taking his pills on time. Meggie watched with glee as Murphy gave into his heart attack. Murphy found himself in the hospital in recovery, not able to say anything about what happened to him. Meggie was revealed to be Murphy's ex-daughter-in-law, and she presumably killed Murphy's son. To continue her plan, Meggie found help in bartender, Deacon Sharpe, who was an alcoholic himself. He became Nikki's drinking buddy for a short while. With Victor and Nikki's wedding coming up, Meggie arranged for Nikki to be found drunk in Deacon's bed, and she was consequently shipped off to rehab. Meggie used her time wisely in order to get closer to Victor so that she could become the next Mrs. Victor Newman. Like her previous husbands, Meggie most likely intended to kill Victor for his money after marrying him. Unfortunately, no one noticed how alarmed Murphy got whenever Meggie came near him, and no one noticed how dangerous she truly was. In November 2010, Meggie drugged Victor, and she finally tricked Victor into marrying her. When they arrived back at the Newman Ranch, Meggie gave Victor heart medication, trying to kill him. Victor woke up, demanding to know why she was rushing their relationship. Meggie was then exposed as a black widow, with Victor knowing about her devilish plan. With the arrival of Murphy and the police, Meggie was arrested for her crimes, just as Victor found out that Meggie was responsible for Nikki's relapse into alcoholism. Meggie currently resides in jail. Sofia Dupre Sofia Dupre first appeared on July 20, 2010, portrayed by actress Julia Pace Mitchell. Sofia was Mitchell's first major role. When the character arrived, she was described as \\"the feisty former right-hand woman to billionaire Tucker McCall and fianc√©e of Malcolm Winters. She is also introduced as a \\"Savvy business woman\\" and a generally \\"no-nonsense person\\" During an interview, Mitchell said she was a big fan of the show. Of her character, Mitchell that \\"she's actually been changing just in the seven months that she's been on the air. I hate to use the word \\"bossy,\\" but I definitely think that she's bossy. She's a big boss.\\" Mitchell said that Sofia runs things in her \\"relationship and in her business life\\". In September 2012, it was announced that Mitchell had been taken off her contract and bumped to a recurring status; however, she was not seen again after October 9, 2012. Sofia arrives in Genoa City working on business for Tucker McCall. Sofia meets with Katherine Chancellor and Neil Winters in Tucker's place. The meeting leads to a confrontation between Sofia and Neil. Later, Sofia is revealed to be the fianc√©e of Neil's brother, Malcolm Winters. Neil is unhappy about this, which causes friction between him, Sofia, and Malcolm. Despite tensions there, Sofia has positive relations with the rest of the Winters family. She became aware of, and involved with, the problem Cane Ashby had been having with the men from Australia. While furious with him at first, she later decides to help him. Tucker finds out about her and Cane's cover up of some bad reports supposedly done by a new contractor named Blake that Cane claimed had a good reputation in business. In reality, Blake is one of the Australian men after Cane, and has been blackmailing him the whole time. This turns ugly and Tucker fires both Cane and Sofia. Malcolm is furious that Sofia did not tell him any of this, since Cane is married to his legal niece, and biological daughter, Lily. He breaks their engagement, within a few weeks of their scheduled Valentine's Day wedding. Shortly thereafter, Cane is murdered. The entire Barber/Winters family comes together to support Lily and her twin babies with Cane, Charlie and Matilda. Impressed with how Sofia has taken great pains to support Lily, and with Sofia estranged from Malcolm, Neil allows his deep-seated attraction to Sofia to surface. The two have sex, just before Malcolm decides to repair his fractured relationship with Sofia. As Malcolm and Sofia repair their relationship, Neil seems worried over the relationship and confronts Sofia about it. She claims that she loves Malcolm and wants to be with him. Sofia and Malcolm married. During the honeymoon, Sofia learns that she is pregnant. While Malcolm is thrilled, Sofia wonders to herself if Neil is the baby's father. The baby ‚Äì named Moses after her father, is born, and DNA testing reveals that Neil is the father. Malcolm leaves Genoa City and promptly divorces Sofia, who moves in with Neil when she and Moses are discharged from the hospital. A month later, Sofia and Neil agree to get married, for the baby's sake. However, Sofia struggles to connect with Neil and fears he doesn't truly love her, especially when he continuously flirts with Harmony Hamilton. When Neil and Harmony kiss, Neil admits to Sofia that he has feelings for her. Heartbroken, Sofia attempts to work on her marriage but nothing comes of it, and they announce they are divorcing. Afterward, Sofia tells Moses that they should start packing as nothing will be keeping them in Genoa City after the divorce. Sofia was offered a job in New York. After telling to Neil about the prospect of moving there with Moses, he warned her that she would not be taking Moses with her and threatened to file for sole custody. Charlie Ashby Charlie Ashby is the son of Cane Ashby and Lily Winters. He was first portrayed as an infant by Parker Rose Curry, from 2010 to 2012, followed by Aidan Clark from 2013 to 2016, Brandin Stennis from 2016 to 2017 and Noah Alexander Gerry in 2017. Gerry was downgraded to recurring status in 2019. He was born along with his twin sister, Matilda Ashby. Lily was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. Her uterus was taken out during a surgery to remove the cancer, but the doctor was able to harvest two of her eggs. Lily and Cane decided to start a family and pursued surrogacy options.

Spencer Walsh Spencer Walsh appeared from June 2010 to May 9, 2012, portrayed by Evan Parke. He is the former District Attorney in Genoa City. He had handled cases including Sharon Newman, Victor Newman and been involved in the Diane Jenkins Murder Case, which he had been involved with most recently. He has also handled legal issues with Chance Chancellor. In May 2012, it was revealed that Walsh had resigned from his post as District Attorney, with Michael Baldwin (Christian LeBlanc) taking over. Vance Abrams Vance Abrams first appeared on July 12, 2010, initially played by John Sloman, days later the role was recast with Eric Roberts, brother of renowned actress Julia Roberts and father of teen star Emma Roberts. Roberts remained in the role from July 23, 2010, until April 11, 2011, and hasn't been seen since. Casting was announced on June 17, 2010, by TV Guide among other sources. Before appearing, his storyline was revealed to involve the scandalous and scheming Adam Wilson (Michael Muhney), who escaped from prison and then faked his own death ‚Äì‚Äì and Vance would represent him in court. His character's appearance was initially to span just over August. In 2010, Adam Newman and his new wife, Skye hired Vance due to charges (from his own family) that Adam was facing. Vance committed himself viciously to the case. Vance suggested that they expose Sharon Newman (Adam's true love at the time), however Adam refused to. Adam ended up winning in court. Since the Adam Newman case, Vance turned his attention to the young Abby Newman, who was being pressured by her uncle, Jack Abbott, to file a lawsuit against her father, Victor, for mishandling her trust fund. Vance offered his services to a reluctant Abby, but she ultimately agreed. Later on, Abby's sister, Victoria Newman Abbott joined the lawsuit and seemingly hijacked the case away from Abby. Regardless, Vance sparred off with Victor's longtime attorney, Michael Baldwin, regarding the operations of Newman Enterprises and the trust funds of Victoria and Abby. Adam Newman ended up testifying for Victor in his trial to suggest while he was CEO of Newman Enterprises, he forged trust documents. Thus, Victor had no idea of what was real or not. However, Neil Winters disproved Adam's testimony, and each of the three Newman children won $500 million each. Nicholas Newman joined his sisters in their lawsuit against their father upon finding out that Victor was lying about his involvement with Skye Newman. Around the same time, Skye disappeared and Adam, who was back in a romance with Sharon Newman, was accused of her murder. With little money left, Sharon offered to pay for his legal fees and brought in Vance and his new legal partner, Leslie Michaelson. When Adam testified for Victor against his siblings wishes, Leslie was shocked to see Adam, but he learned that as a part of this deal, Victor pledged to come forward to the DA regarding his involvement in Sharon's case and would win a trust of his own. After some detective work by Sharon, Adam's charges were dropped, but as a result of her work, she was now accused of murder. In Hawaii, Sharon found Skye, but after an argument, Skye fell to her death in a volcano. It was soon discovered by Adam, Jack, and Phyllis Summers that Victor set Skye up in Hawaii and he was in Hawaii when Sharon was there to make sure no one learned the truth. In Sharon's trial, despite the testimony of Victor, and Vance's sharp legal tactics, Sharon was found guilty. Adam feared that this would happen, so he secretly arranged for her to escape afterward. Upon escaping, she was car- jacked and presumed to be dead after the carjackers got into a serious accident. Vance was not involved in any legal cases after Sharon's murder trial. When Sharon was found alive in New Mexico and brought back to Genoa City for sentencing, Victor hired a new lawyer, Avery Bailey Clark, to help get Sharon out of prison. Blake Joseph Blake Joseph first appeared October 6, 2010, harassing Cane Ashby and his family. He was portrayed by Australian actor Paul Leyden, who as well known for a role on As the World Turns he also had guest roles in Home and Away and BeastMasters. Casting for the role was announced on September 6, 2010. It was also speculated (which came true) that his storyline would be about Cane (Daniel Goddard)'s \\"Australian Adventure\\". Blake came to town from Australia and was watching Cane's family. He disguised himself as a police officer when Cane took his wife Lily to the cottage to hide out. Blake told Cane the organization back in Australia wanted five million dollars from him in payback. When Cane devised a plan to extort the money from McCall Unlimited, Blake began posing as a consultant named James Collier to enable the scam. He has tried to insinuate himself into Lily's good graces. Blake was revealed to be Colin (Cane's father)'s henchmen. Blake ended up shooting Caleb who he believed was Cane at the time. Colin Atkinson Colin Atkinson first appeared on December 8, 2010, as the estranged biological father of Cane Ashby, portrayed by Tristan Rogers who previously was well known for his role as Robert Scorpio on General Hospital. TV Guide announced Rogers' casting on October 25, 2010. Prior to his appearance, he was described as \\"a mysterious and charming stranger named Colin who comes to Genoa City with a dark secret and a threatening agenda\\". He began taping with The Young and the Restless on October 27. His storyline was equally to \\"charm his way into Jill Abbott's heart.\\" By September 2011, it was announced that Rogers would be leaving The Young and the Restless. Of his exit, Rogers said he had nothing but positive things to say and that it was a great experience. He also said that the exit came as a shock to him. In March 2012, it was announced that Rogers was to make a recurring return, however only made one appearance on May 8, 2012. In November 2013, it was announced that Rogers would be making another return to the role. He returned on February 5, 2014. On January 5, 2015, Rogers revealed he re-signed to the series for another year. However, in August 2015, Rogers was demoted back to recurring status. Colin arrived in Genoa City after being released from prison in Australia. He consulted with Blake Joseph, who has been keeping an eye on Cane. Colin became acquainted with Cane's adoptive mother Jill Abbott and she gave him information about Cane, without knowing who he truly was. Cane and Colin met after years, and both refused to tell anybody else (including Cane's wife, Lily Winters) about their connection. Colin wanted Cane to get involved with the family crime organization in Australia gain, or he would reveal Cane's \\"troubling\\" past. It is revealed Cane had a sister, Samantha, who died years ago. Jill and Colin have sex and later fall deeply in love (despite Colin using her) and as they wed Cane is shot by Blake (while rushing to the church to stop the wedding) and \\"died\\". Colin actually was deeply saddened, as he didn't want Cane to be killed but just manipulated and he comforted Jill too. Cane's divorce appears to Lily, however it was later revealed that the \\"ghost\\" was Cane's twin brother Caleb. Once again, this storyline was reversed, and it was revealed the ghost was in fact Cane, alive and the person that was shot was Caleb. During this storyline, Colin's estranged wife, Genevieve returned to Genoa City, wanting revenge on Colin. He later falls off the balcony at Genevieve's mansion, and was sent to hospital, and later arrested for his crimes. He was released and determined to get Jill back and divorced Genevieve after it was revealed they were still legally married. However, Jill constantly rejected him. Colin had sex with Genevieve for comfort, and Genevieve told Jill about this, putting an end to any sort of reunion between Jill and Colin. Genevieve however moved on with no problem, with businessman Jack Abbott. Colin was also locked in Genevieve's wine cellar, and this led Jill to believe that he was overseas with Genevieve. The combination to get out of the cellar was the date that they (Genevieve and Colin) had first consummated their relationship with lovemaking. For a long time, Cane had been working with Ronan Malloy to expose Colin, as Cane thought Colin was setting up a scheme to kill Genevieve and even Gloria Abbott Bardwell. He set up a fake phone call to get Gloria to Genevieve's house, however, due to a family crisis, Gloria had to cancel. Cane's ex-wife Lily soon calls Genevieve and asks her if she can come over to her house to talk. However, when Lily arrives, an explosion, caused and set up by Colin, occurs. Cane rushes Lily out of the burning house, thus saving her life. Genevieve, who wasn't home at the time, gets a call from firefighters moments later. During this entire time, Colin was with Jill in his suite at the Genoa City Athletic Club, while Jill had handcuffed him to the bed, trying to get the truth out of him. Jill, eventually realizes that he can't be trusted and calls Ronan, who arrests him. Meanwhile, Genevieve rushes to the hospital to check on her housekeeper Myrna (who had never been seen, only mentioned), who was in the house at the time of the explosion. Colin is sentenced to time in prison, deported and jailed in Australia. In May 2012, Genevieve received a phone call from Colin in which he stated he had been released from jail and was somewhere comfy and cozy in the world. In February 2014, Jill is abruptly kidnapped from the Chancellor Mansion grounds. It is revealed that Colin kidnapped her as he is facing deportation and he needs her to marry him again for him to stay in the country. She refuses, but he alludes that he knows the truth behind the mystery of a music box Katherine left to Jill before she died. As a result, Jill marries Colin again and they return to Genoa City, where Jill lies to her loved ones by saying she fell in love with Colin all over again and remarried him. He shortly returned in September 2016, and found out that Jill knew about Phyllis and Billy's affair. He offered Jack Abbott to reveal something a secret about his wife for $1 million. Jack firstly refuses the offer but eventually comes back to Colin with a bag of cash to discover the truth. Jill and Colin briefly separated in 2017 after he emptied her personal bank account.

The third act is an early version of Jarry's next play, Ubu Roi; the main character of which, P√®re Ubu, appears here as the Antichrist. This play begins with a startling sequence of images of garbled Christianity from which Ubu emerges as the new Messiah. Scholar Kimblery Jannarone argues the play was 'not intended for the stage' and is Jarry's own form of 'the theatre of the book'. While not a closet drama, Jannarone argues this might be its closest lineage, and can be considered within a tradition of works ranging from the 'Platonic dialogues and Senecan tragedies through Milton‚Äôs Samson Agonistes, Byron‚Äôs Manfred, and Villiers de l‚ÄôIsle-Adam‚Äôs Axewhich'. Production history The play was not produced in Jarry's lifetime, and as scholar Kimberly Jannarone notes, 'almost no one attempts to stage it.' The Australian Live Performance Database lists a performance at Rusden State College in Melbourne, from 10-12 November, 1978, which was performed by students in the first-year undergraduate course Drama-110. The world premiere of James Beirman's original translation (revised by the translator) took place at the University of California Santa Cruz in March 2005. The Santa Cruz Sentinel noted, \\"Caesar Antichrist is both a strange and unusual play and a riotous and ribald production. It's not a show that is likely to be produced again (ever, anywhere), so if you want to experience patapyhsical apocalyptic theatre, this is probably your only chance'.

The Novosels were highly represented in the battles against the Turks, as evidenced by the coat of arms of the family, which represents a wolf holding a severed Ottoman head.Bojniƒçiƒá pl. Kninski, Ivan; Der Adel Von Kroatien Und Slavonien, (Armorial of the nobility of Croatia and Slavonia), N√ºrnberg (1899), taf-95  History  The Novosels were given nobility status on 12 September 1744 under Empress Maria Theresa. The muniment of nobility and the coat of arms confirmed Luka Novosel as a noble of the Kingdom of Croatia and Slavonia, which was part of Transleithania, as Vice Captain of the fortress at Hrvatska Kostajnica for the military merits of his fighting against the Ottoman Turks. Luka Novosel was elected deputy prefect of Po≈æega County on 12 November 1750; on 8 April 1755 Empress Maria Theresa appointed him a member of the Commission and a member of the Royal Court (judicium delegatum) in suppressing revolts in Virovitica County. The session of the Commission and the Court started on 21 May 1755. Empress Maria Theresa appointed Count Joseph Kegleviƒá the president of the Commission and Royal Court, and as members of the Commission and Court she appointed General Count Serbellonia, the advisors of Ignat Kemfa, and the deputy prefect of Po≈æega County, Luka Novosel. The Chairman of the Commission soon came to the conclusion that the sources of rebellion in the entire County of Virovitica were the serfs from Bukovica and \\"five villages of the upper Alexandar Pejaƒçeviƒá\\" on the Virovitica estate. On 14 June 1755 the Commission was ordered to capture the ringleaders of the revolt in these six villages. Antun Novosel, son of Luka Novosel, was appointed the function of Head of the Bishopric Palace (Comes Curialis) by Bishop Maximilian Vrhovac de RakitovecDe≈æeliƒá, Velimir, Biskupska a zatim Novoselska tiskara u Zagrebu 1794.-1825.

Emperor Joseph II ordered Bishop Maximilian to give his printing office and bookstore to someone else, so the bishop give them to the Antun Novosel. In 1796 the Novosel printing office printed the book Robinson Crusoe translated into Croatian.

He is Packey J. Dee Professor Emeritus in Political Science with a joint appointment in Philosophy at the University of Notre Dame (USA). He holds a Doctor of Law from the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, and a PhD in political science from Duke University. He is the author of some 40 books and the editor of 20 other books. He has served as president of the Society for Asian and Comparative Philosophy (SACP); an advisory member of the Scientific Committee of RESET - Dialogue on Civilizations (Rome); the Executive Co-Chair of World Public Forum - Dialogue of Civilizations (Vienna), and a member of the Supervisory Board of the Dialogue of Civilizations Research Institute (Berlin).  Life Dallmayr was born on October 18, 1928, in Ulm, Germany, and raised in Augsburg, Germany. World War II had a profound impact on his intellectual and political development. ‚ÄúI feel that, in large measure, I can trace my persistent opposition to war and violence‚Äîespecially aggressive warfare‚Äîto this youthful experience.‚ÄùFred Dallmayr, On the Boundary: A Life Remembered, Lanham, MD: Hamilton Books, 2017, 10. . In 1955, he received the degree of Doctor of Law from the University of Munich. In 1954‚Äì1957, he attended the Institute of European Studies (Istituto Universitario di Studi Europei) in Turin, Italy, under the mentorship of Norberto Bobbio. In 1955‚Äì1956, he studied at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale, Illinois, USA. In 1957, he was admitted to Duke University, North Carolina, USA, taking the PhD in Political Science in 1960. He taught at Purdue University as an Assistant Professor and Associate Professor (1963‚Äì1971), and then as Professor and Head of Department of Political Science (1973‚Äì1978). Since 1978, he has taught at Notre Dame, and is currently Packey J. Dee Professor of Government emeritus. He has been a visiting Professor at the University of Hamburg, Germany (1971‚Äì72, 1976, and 1986). He has also been Werner Marx Visiting Professor in Philosophy at the New School for Social Research in New York (1988), a Fellow at Nuffield College, Oxford, and a Fulbright research scholar, at the Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda (MSU), Vadodara, Gujarat, India (1991‚Äì1992). During trips to India, China, Japan, Malaysia, Turkey, Egypt, and other countries, he established close collaborative relationships with many prominent philosophers and has been able to learn in-depth their cultural and philosophical traditions. He has maintained dialogues with philosophers such as J√ºrgen Habermas, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Jacques Derrida, and Paul-Michel Foucault, as well as Karl-Otto Apel, William McBride, Seyla Benhabib, Iris Marion Young, David M. Rasmussen, Judith Butler, Bhikhu Parekh, Ashis Nandy, and Tu Weiming, among others.  Major philosophical themes Dallmayr's research interests include contemporary philosophy and political theory; especially phenomenology; hermeneutics; critical theory; deconstruction; democratic theory; intercultural philosophy; and non-Western philosophical and political thought. He has written on G. W. F. Hegel, Martin Heidegger, Gadamer, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Theodor W. Adorno; J√ºrgen Habermas, Karl-Otto Apel, Louis Althusser, Foucault, Derrida, Paul Tillich, Raimon Panikkar, and Enrique Dussel. Dallmayr's philosophy is characterized by the transformative impulse, fostering both the change that takes place in the development of philosophy and the role of philosophy in understanding and transforming human beings in their cultural manifestations and in social interactions. Dallmayr's philosophy and political theory favors self-other relations over ego, dialogue over monologue, relationality over static identity, ethical conduct over the abstract knowledge of normative rules, equal democratic lateral relationships over hierarchies of domination, and intercultural and cosmopolitan perspectives over chauvinistic hegemonism. He has been a critic of liberal democracy, and has elucidated alternative conceptions of ‚Äúapophatic‚Äù democracy or ‚Äúdemocracy to come.‚ÄùFred Dallmayr, ‚ÄúApophatic Democracy?‚Äù in Democracy to Come: Democracy as Relational Praxis. Oxford University Press, 2017. e-book. . As an alternative to the dichotomies of Western philosophy, Dallmayr's overall perspective aims to steer a course between universalism and particularism, between globalism and localism, between Western modernity and tradition, and between Western and non-Western traditions of philosophical and religious thought. He firmly upholds the transcendent or trans-mundane status of the ideas of truth, goodness and justice, while simultaneously insisting on the need to interpret these ideas and to translate them into a commitment to justice and peace among people in this world. In developing his philosophy, Dallmayr acknowledges his debt to phenomenology, hermeneutics, critical theory, and deconstructionism. From his earliest works, Dallmayr has consistently confronted Cartesian cogito and its oppositions (subject and object, human being and world). He criticizes the egocentrism of modern Western thought, including its ‚Äúanthropocentric and subjectivist thrust‚Äù and ‚Äúpossessive individualism.‚ÄùFred Dallmayr, ‚ÄúBeyond Possessive Individualism‚Äù in Twilight of Subjectivity: Contributions to a Post-Individualist Theory. Amherst, MA: University of Massachusetts Press,1981, 8ff. . Yet this critique does not mean anti-humanism and the ‚Äúend of man,‚Äù as advocated by some postmodern thinkers. He does not disregard the individual subject, but rather revises it as an emergent and relational being capable of transformation. To the metaphysical paradigm rooted in individual subjectivity he opposes the emerging outlook emphasizing human connectedness, anchored in (Heideggerian) ‚Äúcare‚Äù (Sorge) and ‚Äúsolicitude‚Äù (F√ºrsorge). Dallmayr outlines a post-individualist theory of politics, which does not simply reject individualism but seeks to divest it of its anthropocentric, ‚Äúegological,‚Äù and ‚Äúpossessive‚Äù connotations. Dieter Misgeld noted that Dallmayr has ‚Äúa post-individualist theory of politics and post-liberal moral and political thinking as his themes, as well as a theory of embodied intersubjectivity meant to be foundational for a theory of politics.‚ÄùDieter Misgeld, ‚ÄúPhilosophy and politics: On Fred Dallmayr's ‚ÄòCritical Encounters,‚Äô‚Äù Human Studies, March 1991, Volume 14, Issue 1: 16. Dallmayr on Heidegger Dallmayr's brings an original interpretation of Heidegger's works. He was among the first in the English-speaking world to realize that Heidegger's philosophical work ‚Äúwas much broader than the particular Nazi episode.‚ÄùDallmayr, On the Boundary, 43. He has elucidated Heidegger's work in several of his own major works.Dallmayr, Twilight of Subjectivity, 56ff.; Fred Dallmayr, The Other Heidegger. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1993. . He uncovered fruitful contributions of Heidegger's work, which are relevant to contemporary social and political thought. He also delineated the contours of an alternative political perspective in Heidegger's thought. Dallmayr highlights the importance of Heidegger's critique of Western metaphysics, especially Cartesian rationalism with its focus on the cogito, which was the root of the split between mind and matter, subject and object, self and other, humans and the world. In contrast to these divisions, Heidegger's definition of human existence as being-in-the-world conceptualizes ‚Äúworld‚Äù in its many dimensions as a constitutive feature of existence as such. In opposition to traditional formulations, being could not be grasped as a substance or fixed concept but needs to be seen as a temporal process or happening, an ongoing disclosure (and sheltering) of meaning in which all beings participate.Dallmayr, On the Boundary, 43‚Äì4. With Heidegger, Dallmayr goes beyond the self-centered type of existentialism. He interprets Dasein (human existence) in Being and TimeMartin Heidegger, Being and Time: A Translation of Sein und Zeit, translated by Joan Stambaugh. Albany: State University of New York Press, 1953. . as not a self-constituted or a fixed substance, but open- ended and potentially transformative, ‚Äúa being moved by ‚Äòcare‚Äô (Sorge) in an ongoing search for meaning and truth.‚ÄùFred Dallmayr, Against Apocalypse: Recovering Humanity‚Äôs Wholeness. Lexington Books, 2017, 83. . He also explicates Heidegger‚Äôs other key concepts, such as letting-be (Seinlassen), event (Ereignis),Martin Heidegger, Das Ereignis (Event), edited by Friedrich- Wilhelm von Hermann. Frankfurt am Main: Vittorio Klostermann, 2009. . and dwelling (wohnen), to move his political philosophy beyond the traditional paradigm, rooted in individual subjectivity, toward a view of human beings and society that emphasizes human connectedness and relationality. Above all, he shows that for Heidegger every substance is marked by division, every unity or community by ‚Äúdifference‚Äù (Unterschied). The central issue is how togetherness and separation, unity and difference ‚Äúbelong together.‚ÄùMartin Heidegger, Identit√§t und Differenz. Neske, Pfullingen 1957, 1978. . Dallmayr relates what he learns from Heidegger to political philosophy, asking questions, such as: ‚ÄúWhat is the status of individualism and of traditional Western humanism?‚Äù and ‚ÄúHow should one construe the relations between self and other human beings bypassing the options of contractual agreement and simple rational convergence?‚ÄùDallmayr, On the Boundary, 45. He focuses on the status of the individual as political agent; the character of the political community; the issue of cultural and political development or modernization; and the problem of an emerging cosmopolis, or world order, beyond the confines of Western culture.Dallmayr, The Other Heidegger; Fred Dallmayr, Between Freiburg and Frankfurt: Toward a Critical Ontology. Amherst, University of Massachusetts Press, 1991. e-book. . He articulates from a philosophical perspective the relevance of Heidegger's diagnosis of the condition of contemporary society characterized by mass culture, the depersonalized ‚Äúthey‚Äù (das Man), the instrumental reason, oppressive power (Macht) and manipulative domination or machination (Machenschaft). Dallmayr shows the relevance of Heidegger as a thinker who was able to realize the dramatic situation of Western civilization and to see the root causes of its problems, which continued to escalate ever since. The qualitatively new perspective, highlighted by Dallmayr, is that contradictions and perilous tendencies in Western society are now escalating to the level of being global problems, which put us at the precipice of self- destruction‚Äînuclear or ecological. Dialogue and intercultural philosophy Dallmayr sees the problems of Western modernity in the monologic mindset, which was rooted in Cartesian ego cogito and became an instrumental rationality coupled with egocentric will to power and domination. He advocates for dialogue in theory and practice, as a means to overcome monologic unilateralism and for establishing the relationships of mutual understanding and collaboration, aiming for peaceful coexistence and justice. He has elucidated the dialogical motifs in the works of Mikhail Mikhailovich Bakhtin, Gadamer, Karl Jaspers, Emmanuel Levinas, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and Panikkar, among others. Starting with the etymology of the word ‚Äúdialogue,‚Äù which comes from the Greek and is composed of two parts: ‚Äúdia‚Äù and ‚Äúlogos,‚Äù Dallmayr explains that ‚Äúdia-logue‚Äù means that reason or meaning is not the monopoly of one party but emerges in the intercourse or communication between parties or agents. In the twentieth century, the turn towards dialogue can be seen as part and parcel of the so-called linguistic turn. He writes, ‚ÄúAssociated prominently with the names of Wittgenstein, Heidegger, Gadamer, and Bakhtin, this turn has placed into the foreground the necessarily ‚Äòrelational‚Äô or dialogical character of human thought and conduct.‚ÄùFred Dallmayr, Mindfulness and Letting Be: On Engaged Thinking and Acting. London: Lexington Books, 2014, 104. . In his words, dialogue means to approach alien meanings of life-forms in a questioning mode conducive to a possible learning experience. In the political arena, this turn has led to the re-invigoration of the public sphere and the expansion of the public domain in a global and cross-cultural direction. Dallmayr believes in the fundamental character of dialogue and its indispensability for a proper human interaction. He emphasizes Gadamer‚Äôs idea that every inter-personal encounter and every interpretation of texts involves dialogue in search for the meaning, and that the ethical precondition to genuine dialogue is to have good will and the recognition of the other as equal. As Dallmayr pointed out in an interview with Ghencheh Tazmini, ‚ÄúGenuine dialogue requires not only talking but a great deal of listening‚Äù.\\"Fred Dallmayr in conversation with Ghencheh Tazmini,\\" in 22 Ideas to Fix the World: Conversations with the World's Foremost Thinkers. Edited by Piotr Dutkiewicz and Richard Sakwa, 286-301. New York: New York University Press, 2013, 286. . He stresses the importance of an authentic dialogue and elaborates on Panikkar's conception of ‚Äúdialogical dialogue‚Äù and interreligious dialogue.Fred Dallmayr, Spiritual Guides: Pathfinders in the Desert. Notre Dame, IN: University of Notre Dame Press, 2017. e-book. . His appreciation of the dialogical trends in Western thought served as ‚Äúpossible springboards to broader, cross-cultural or trans-cultural explorations.‚ÄùDallmayr, On the Boundary, 65. Dallmayr broadened his intercultural horizon through engagement in dialogue with the philosophical traditions of India, China, and the Islamic world. His encounters with Eastern philosophical cultures resulted in a transformative turn in Dallmayr's philosophical path. This strengthened his critical views of Eurocentric self-enclosure, anthropocentrism, and cognitive self-sufficiency. At the same time, it deepened his appreciation of the best in Europe's philosophical traditions. This helped to the development of his intercultural philosophy. Cross-cultural political theory Dallmayr is engaged in rethinking some of the central concepts of Western political philosophy.See Stephen K. White, ed. Life-World and Politics: Between Modernity and Postmodernity: Essays in Honor of Fred R. Dallmayr. Notre Dame, Indiana: University of Notre Dame Press, 1989. . He challenges the predominance of a ‚Äúsubjectivity‚Äù and anthropocentric individualism, articulating alternative post-individualist or post-egocentric conceptions of selfhood and of politics as relational praxis. He elaborates on the post- anthropocentric and relational conception of the political community, viewing it as a differentiated wholeness combining both freedom and solidarity. He contributes to the development of ‚Äúcritical phenomenology.‚Äù In Kenneth Colburn Jr's words, ‚ÄúFred Dallmayr is without doubt one of the leading theoretical phenomenologists of our time in the social sciences.‚ÄùKenneth Colburn Jr. ‚ÄúA critical encounter with Fred Dallmayr: Introduction,‚Äù Human Studies, March 1991, Volume 14, Issue 1: 1. Phenomenology tries to relate the subject and the world of phenomena through an act of focused intention, and when combined with the resources of critical theory, it produces a critical phenomenology of politics. In it, phenomenology orients toward concrete human experience, while critical theory focuses on critiquing the effects of domination and exploitation in that experience.Fred Dallmayr, Beyond Dogma and Despair: Toward a Critical Phenomenology of Politics. Notre Dame, IN: University of Notre Dame Press, 1981. . According to Farah Godrej, ‚ÄúDallmayr is widely acknowledged to be one of the primary forces behind the inauguration of this field of cross-cultural theory, also called ‚Äòcomparative political theory.‚Äô‚ÄùFarah Godrej, ‚ÄúIntroduction,‚Äù in Fred Dallmayr: Critical Phenomenology, Cross-Cultural Theory, Cosmopolitanism. Edited by Farah Godrej, 1-9. New York: Routledge, 2017, 3-4. . Applying his intercultural perspective, he has written extensively on political thought in India, in the Far East, and in Muslim countries.Fred Dallmayr and Peter R. Moody, ‚ÄúNon-Western Political Thought,‚Äù special issue of The Review of Politics 59 no. 3 (1997): 421‚Äì647; Fred Dallmayr, Comparative Political Theory: An Introduction.

Sage Publications India, 1999; with Zhao Tingyang, Contemporary Chinese Political Thought. University of Kentucky Press, 2012. . His approach retains a connection with critical theory, involving thinkers such as Gandhi, Edward Said, Enrique Dussel, and Tzvetan Todorov. Spirituality Dallmayr analyses the philosophical-theological works of some twentieth-century philosophers and theologians, including Tillich, Thomas Merton, and Panikkar, highlighting the commonalities in their thought.Dallmayr, Spiritual Guides. All three insisted on the need for radical ‚Äúmetanoia,‚Äù meaning a ‚Äúturn around or Kehre‚Äù or spiritual ‚Äúconversion of heart.‚ÄùDallmayr, Spiritual Guides, 6, 80 They aimed for a holistic recovery from modern fragmentation, and sought to connect‚Äîin fruitful tension‚Äîthe sacred with the secular, theology with philosophy, Christian teachings with the humanities, and the theoretical understanding with social praxis. Tillich, Merton, and Panikkar are exemplars of openness to intercultural and interreligious dialogue. Dallmayr examines their intensive interest in Zen Buddhism as distinct cases of the Christian- Buddhist encounter during the past half century: the intersection of Tillich's dialectical theology with Japanese Buddhist thought; the dialogue of Thomas Merton's trans-individualism with Zen Buddhism; and the encounter of Raimon Panikkar's Vedantic thoughts with the Buddhist ‚Äúsilence of God.‚Äù Dallmayr pays special attention to the intercultural-interreligious and spiritual dimensions of Panikkar's works. His nondualistic views are congenial to those of Panikkar, who expresses nondualism in using the Indian notion of Advaita and who sees our age ‚Äúas capable to moving beyond the ‚ÄòWestern dilemma‚Äô of monism/dualism or immanence/transcendence.‚ÄùDallmayr, Spiritual Guides, 40‚Äì41. Dallmayr, being critical of both an agnostic immanentism lacking spirituality and a radical transcendentalism indifferent to social-ethical problems, sees in Panikkar‚Äôs holism a third possibility, pointing to the potential overcoming of the ‚Äútranscendence-immanence‚Äù conundrum. Dallmayr points out the connection between personal freedom and the caring for others. For human beings who are free from selfish egocentrism, it is natural to nurture the perfect virtue of compassion (karuna) and to be engaged in caring praxis. He writes, ‚ÄúThe Buddha‚Äôs own praxis, anchored in his freedom, by no means seeks to advance his own status or influence; his karuna resides in ‚Äòthe superabundance of his state of ‚Äògrace.‚Äô‚ÄùIbid.,136. What saves us is ‚Äúthe refusal to entertain any doctrine or ideology that pretends to deliver authoritative ‚Äòknowledge‚Äô of God.‚Äô‚ÄùIbid.,137. The Buddha‚Äôs teaching is directed to a ‚Äúprofound freedom‚Äù or total liberation from both external coercion and interior will to power, which, in turn, ‚Äúpaves the way toward a released humanity no longer entrapped in aggressive individual or collective identities.‚ÄùIbid.,137. In reflecting on the meaning of spirituality, as it has been expressed in various religious traditions, Dallmayr mentions as the core feature of religion and spiritual experience ‚Äúthe transgression from self to other, from ‚Äòimmanence‚Äô to (some kind of) ‚Äòtranscendence.‚Äô‚Äù Spirituality should ‚Äúparticipate in this transgressive or transformative movement,‚Äù to be a vessel for ‚Äúnavigating the straits between immanence and transcendence, between the human and the divine.‚Äù Spirituality is commonly associated with a certain kind of responsiveness ‚Äúinside‚Äù human beings, a kind of human ‚Äúinwardness.‚Äù Religion cannot simply be an external form but has to find some kind of personal ‚Äúresonance‚Äù among people today: ‚Äúthe heart (the heart-and-mind) might be described as the great ‚Äòresonance chamber‚Äô constantly open or attuned to new religious of mystical experiences.‚ÄùIbid.,98‚Äì100.  Democracy to come Dallmayr is critical of the form of democracy currently found in the Western countries, which is characterized as liberal, laissez-faire, or minimalist, because the primary emphasis is on the liberty of individuals or groups to pursue their particular self-interests, while the role of ‚Äúthe people‚Äù as a government is minimalized and solely characterized by competitive elections with ‚Äúslim procedural formalities serving as fig leaves to cover prevailing modes of domination.‚ÄùFred Dallmayr, The Promise of Democracy: Political Agency and Transformation. Albany: State University of New York Press, 2010, 1. . He applies the ideas of dialogue to the conception of democratic politics as relational praxis, guided by ethical principles and ‚Äúlove of equality.‚Äù He challenges democracy that emphasizes the pursuit of individual or collective self-interest, insisting that more ethical conceptions are possible, that different societies should nurture democracy with their own cultural resources, and that a world has to promote ‚Äúa fair relationality or qualitative equality between citizen, but also between West and non- West.‚ÄùDallmayr, Democracy to Come, 13. He adopts Derrida's conceptualization of ‚Äúdemocracy to come‚Äù and further develops his own version of it, which is characterized as relational, enabling potentiality, ethical, and apophatic. He views democracy as a ‚Äúpromise,‚Äù meaning that it is not presently an actuality, but it latently exists as a possibility or potentiality, the realization of which requires a process of striving, ethical cultivation, and self- transformation. Democracy is not a finished condition but an open-ended potentiality and creativity. Dallmayr explores democratic traditions not only in the West, but also in India, China, and the Middle East. He discusses efforts to build democracy in regions. He examines the relation between democracy and Islam. He discusses Gandhian and Confucian perspectives on democracy as possible correctives to liberal and minimalist democracy. Gandhi's notions of self-governance (swaraj), nonviolence, and the struggle for justice allow for the practice of relational care and respect.Ibid., 121‚Äì22. Accordingly, Dallmayr presents a vision of democracy as popular self- rule in which civic education, ethical cultivation, and self-transformation make possible a nondomineering political agency. Cosmopolis Stephen Schneck, characterizing Dallmayr's views of the ‚Äúcivilizing process,‚Äù writes: ‚ÄúNot enmity, conflict, and the ‚Äòclash‚Äô cited by so many as the way to a new world arrangement; Dallmayr instead proposes ‚Äòspace‚Äô for mutual world- disclosure through dialogue and discursive openness.‚ÄùStephen F.

He expresses dissatisfaction with some of the interpretations of cosmopolitanism: empirical, focused on economic and technological globalization, while hiding ethical deficits; and normative, which refer to international law and a legal world order, but which ignore local and regional contexts. He favors instead an approach that gives primacy to practice, ‚Äúpointing to the need for concrete engagements across national, cultural, and religious boundaries‚Äù for ‚Äúthe building of a pluralistic and dialogical cosmopolis.‚ÄùDallmayr, On the Boundary, 83. He views cosmopolitanism not just in legal and institutional terms but in a broader cultural and philosophical sense. It presents an alternative to the status quo. He again finds useful insights in Heidegger's conception of temporality, meaning that human being- in-the-world is constantly ‚Äútemporalized‚Äù in the direction of future possibilities. He also refers to John Dewey‚Äôs pragmatism, Alfred North Whitehead‚Äôs process philosophy, hermeneutics, and some other sources. Based on these, he develops his conception of ‚Äúa ‚Äòbecoming cosmopolis‚Äô beckoning from the future as a possibility and a promise.‚ÄùIbid., 82. Dallmayr contributes to the development of a ‚Äúnew cosmopolitanism,‚Äù as reflexive, critical, democratic, rooted, dialogical, intercultural, and transformative. He develops his conception of cosmopolis in dialogue with the ideas of such theorists of cosmopolitanism as Karl-Otto Apel, Daniele Archibugi, Seyla Benhabib, Richard A. Falk, Ra√∫l Fornet-Betancourt, Habermas, David Held, James Ingram, Martha Nussbaum, and Walter Mignolo, among others. At the same time, his conception of cosmopolis has some distinctive characteristics that are related to his interpretation of being-in-the-world, care, relationality, democratic politics as relational praxis, world maintenance, and spirituality.

Originally a single-seat, high- wing monoplane, it was developed into a two-seat biplane for production in kit form as the SMAN P√©trel. Design and development The first Hydroplum was designed, built and test flown by Claude Tisserand during 1983. It has a wooden, fabric covered structure. The rectangular plan wing has a single spar and 2.8¬∞ of dihedral. It has no ailerons, roll instead being controlled by 40% span spoilers. The wing is mounted above the hull on a flat sided pylon and braced by a single strut on each side to the lower hull longeron. The Hydroplum's Hirth engine is mounted in pusher configuration on the pylon with its propeller shaft in the plane of the wing. Its single-seat, unenclosed cockpit is immediately ahead of the pylon. The hull is short, with a shallow V-shaped planing bottom and a single step. At the rear of the hull a boom projects aft and slightly upwards, bearing the swept fin and rudder and low set, rectangular tailplane and one piece elevator. On water, a pair of underwing floats, each located at about midspan and suspended on a pair of struts, one to the spar and one forward to the leading edge, provide lateral stability. Early photographs show them with flat bottoms, though a drawing indicates a more conventional V-shape. A water rudder can be lowered from the back of the hull for steering on the surface. On land the Hydroplum has a conventional undercarriage with a pair of mainwheels which retract into the sides of the hull and a tailwheel, also retractable, in the rear of the plaining bottom. The Hydroplum first flew at the end of September 1983. Testing resulted in some trimming and centre of gravity adjustments. The first take-off from land was made on 26 May 1984. The Hydroplum flew the following month at the Paris Aero Show in 1985, equipped with the flat-bottomed floats. It was put into store after 35 hours of flight whilst Tisserand concentrated on commercialization of the design. At least one other Hydroplum was built from plans provided by him. Soon after the Paris show Tisserand began modifying the design to make it suitable for homebuilding from commercially produced kits, deciding that it should become a two seater with glass fibre fuselage and wings, though the empennage remained wood. He prepared the fuselage moulds and the half shell castings, sub-contracting the wing to what would become ARPLAS. The greatest change was that the Hydroplum II was a single bay biplane rather than a monoplane, a revision made to simplify transport by shortening the span. The Hydroplum II is an unequal span, single bay biplane with V-from interplane struts. The fabric covered wings are again of constant chord and square tipped, though the lower wing has wing tip, retractable floats. The upper wing spoilers were moved from the main spar to the trailing edge, mounted on false spars. The fuselage was widened to accommodate two side-by-side in an open cockpit and refined aft, under a revised pylon which now rose from a rounded, raised upper fairing. The tailplane was raised to above the boom and the tailwheel undercarriage of the Hydroplum replaced with tricycle gear. The Hydroplum II is powered by a 48 kW (65 hp) Rotax 532 flat-twin. The Hydroplum II first flew on 1 November 1986; it was sold the following September. The production, kit built, Hydroplum II was introduced in September 1987 under that name but was soon marketed as the Soci√©t√© Morbihannaise d'A√©ro Navigation SMAN P√©trel. These differed from the prototype only in offering an enclosed cabin and, later, the 60 kW (80 hp) Rotax 912 flat-four engine. After SMAN collapsed in 1994, Biilie Marine briefly continued kit production in France. When they ceased production in the late 1990s, some 60 kits had been sold. Development then passed to the Americas; in Brazil it was developed into the EDRA Aeronautica Paturi and Super P√©trel and Canada as the AAC SeaStar. In late September or early October 1992 a final variant, the Hydroplum bis or Hydroplum Ia, was flown. This, the Hydroplum prototype reworked, has wings cropped by 1 m (39 in), wing tip floats, an integrated water rudder and tailwheel and spoilers moved from the rear to the front of the wing spar to improve their efficiency. The smaller span raised the maximum speed from 110 km/h (68 mph) to 130 km/h (81 mph), but also increased stalling speed and landing run. Tisserand flew it until November 1992, then sold it. Operational history Two Hydroplums remain on the French civil register in 2010, both in Corsica where they were built. 32 SMAN P√©trels are on the civil European (Russia excluded) aircraft registers in 2010.

The character debuted on-screen during the episode broadcast on 18 January 2012. The character was introduced as the mother of Ash (Holly Weston), Callum (Laurie Duncan) and Lacey Kane (Georgia Bourke). Martha is portrayed as a feisty female and a liberal parent. Martha is an alcoholic and has been used to portray the effects the issue has on involved family members. Her addiction causes trouble and affects her youngest daughter, Lacey, following a violent altercation. Despite attempting to overcome her addiction, Martha failed to stop drinking. The character has also featured in comedy scenes and struck up friendships with fellow older characters. She has also feuds with Ash's boyfriends. Martha dislikes Ally Gorman (Dan O'Connor) and eventually exposes him as a fraud. She later sets out to prove Will Savage (James Atherton) is a murderer and succeeds. After two years at Hollyoaks Norris filmed her final scenes which aired on 8 November 2013. Laura Morgan from All About Soap branded Martha as soap opera's worst mother. While reporters from Digital Spy and What's on TV believed that the character left in \\"high regard\\". Character development Introduction and characterisation In January 2012, the serial's producer Emma Smithwick said that she wanted to explore Ash (Holly Weston) and Callum Kane's (Laurie Duncan) backstories. She revealed that she planned to introduce \\"satellite\\" family members in the process. Martha appeared on a semi-regular basis. On the serial's official website, Martha is described as being \\"loveable but feisty, straight-talking and fun\\". Martha is more of a \\"liberal parent than a strict one\\". Martha is a single mother, she dislikes the father of her children who wealthy and lives in Dubai. Martha is immature for her age but tries to do the right thing for her children. Norris believes that Martha is \\"very immauture\\" because she became pregnant with Ash at a young age, subsequently losing her own childhood. Martha's behavior can alienate people and Norris felt challenged with her scripts to make Martha more likeable. She did so by feeling sympathetic and attempting to understand Martha's behaviour. The character has also been used to portray comedic scenes which drew praise from viewers. Some were shared with Diane O'Connor (Alex Fletcher) and Myra McQueen (Nicole Barber-Lane) and Norris claimed that fans pestered her wanting more scenes featuring the trio. Alcoholism In one storyline Ash is diagnosed with meningitis, which leaves Martha unable to cope and she turns to alcohol. Weston told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that the storyline shows that Martha is \\"not quite the good mum that she pretends to be\\". This was the first time that viewers were made aware of Martha's alcohol problem. Weston opined that viewers did not understand the reasons they complained about Martha. The scenes gave \\"a good picture\\" as to why Ash and Callum had made her out to be a \\"nightmare mum\\". Callum is left to deal with Martha's behaviour alone, which proves to be \\"quite difficult for him\\". Norris told Alison Slade from TVTimes that Martha \\"would die for her children\\" but she still behaves like a child herself. She cannot deal with \\"anything that requires her to step up and be a mother\\". Norris said that Martha keeps deserting her family and leaving them to cope with alone. Martha \\"manipulates Callum and wraps him around her little finger, like she always does.\\" Martha cannot cope with the situation and even misses a meeting with a doctor. The actress added that she Martha would \\"rather it was Callum sorting it out\\". Martha later begins a relationship with her boss. When he cancels their date, Martha begins drinking. However, her daughter Lacey Kane (Georgia Bourke) intervenes by pouring her wine down the sink. Bourke told TVTimes Slade that \\"Martha's a bit drunk by that point and lashes out\\". The following morning Martha is \\"breezy\\" and acts as though nothing has happened. Lacey forgives Martha because she attempts to apologise by making her breakfast and taking her shopping. Bourke added that Martha's actions bring Lacey to the realisation of what her mother is \\"capable of and that her drink problem is worse than she thought\\". Martha's drinking becomes more frequent in the weeks that followed. Norris told a writer from Inside Soap that her character is in \\"terrible denial [because] she doesn't think that she drinks too much\\". Martha is aware of the upset is causes her children, but she \\"just laughs it off and makes a joke out of the situation\\". Norris said that it was \\"awful\\" of Martha, as her drinking begins to affect Callum and Lacey in different ways. As Lacey is only fifteen, not being able to wake her mother up leaves her \\"particularly scared\\". But Callum is \\"really angry\\" and when Martha regains consciousness he tells her that he \\"has had enough\\" and will not take any more of her behaviour. In July 2012, Norris appeared on The Wright Stuff, explaining that she researched the storyline during filming with help from Hollyoaks bosses. \\"I did as much [research] as I could. Fortunately for me, I haven't had that kind of lifestyle - I'm not a big boozer myself, and it wasn't a big thing in my family. \\"But I was really lucky, while we were filming, to come into contact with somebody who was a teenager with a mother who had a serious alcohol problem. He shared some stories with me, and nobody should have to go through that, particularly at that age. And unfortunately she did pass away and left the family in devastation.\\" Martha decides to stop drinking alcohol and begins to rebuild her life. Norris told Kilkelly that it would be positive message if Martha never drank again. She noted Martha will always be an alcoholic and would dislike Martha having occasional drinks. Norris preferred portraying the storyline to addressed correctly and preferably when it conveys the effects on families. Martha takes a dislike to Ash's boyfriend Ally Gorman (Dan O'Connor). Susan Hill from the Daily Star reported that everyone had been fooled by Ally and Martha helps to expose it after preventing Ally sleeping with Lacey. A spokesperson for the show stated: \\"Martha does what any mum would do when she catches them together and all hell breaks loose. Ally has no choice but to admit everything. Lacey is distraught and struggles to come to terms with it all.\\" Departure Martha's remaining on-screen children, Ash and Callum, were killed off during October 2013. The storyline saw Martha arriving at their memorial service drunk and accuses Ash's boyfriend Will Savage (James Atherton) of killing her. Digital Spy released an article announcing that Martha vows to expose Will's lies. When Leah Barnes (Ela-May Demircan) hands Martha a necklace belonging to the deceased Anna Savage (Saskia Wickham) she questions how she came to be in its possession. She explains that Will was hiding it in Martha's flat and is not disabled as he claims to be. Martha realises the extent of Will's lies. Atherton told Digital Spy's Kilkelly that Martha begins to uncover the truth that he murdered Texas Longford (Bianca Hendrickse-Spendlove) and Anna. Martha tells Dennis Savage (Joe Tracini) and Dodger Savage (Danny Mac) of her suspicions and they decide to expose him. But Will overhears there conversation, Atherton said \\"the wheels are really starting to come off the wagon for him, so he acts in the only way he knows how.\\" Martha's discoveries culmulate with Will taking Martha and his family hostage. The show aired the Martha's final scenes on 8 November 2013, when she leaves to stay with her sister and Lacey. Norris had to keep her departure a secret until transmission. Norris told Kilkelly that \\"I was originally only meant to be in Hollyoaks for a few episodes, so to be asked to stay for two years was a blessing.\\" While Kilkelly noted that Martha was determined to move forward with her remaining family. Storylines Martha first appears when she asks Callum where he has been overnight. She assumes that he spent the night with Maddie Morrison (Scarlett Bowman) when he was actually helping homeless George Smith (Steven Roberts) out. Martha agrees to let George stay with her for aslong as he needs to. When Martha finds a new home, she goes missing leaving Callum and Ash to sort out the moving. She then welcomes home her youngest daughter, Lacey. Martha embarraces Ash by going on a drunken night out with her friends. Ash is taken to hospital and diagnosed with meningitis, unable to cope Martha goes home to get drunk. Martha starts calling in sick and is fired from her job. She interferes with Callum's revision to get him to help with interview preparations. She gets a new job and immediately sleep with her boss after a night of drinking. When her boyfriend cancels their date Martha get drunk and ignores Lacey, who decides to pour her wine down the drain. Martha insults Lacey and slaps her, the following day she tries to bribe Lacey with breakfast and a shopping trip. She later discovers that Lacey has stolen money from the Savage family. Martha takes the money for herself to pay the bills and Lacey uses this against her to have more freedom. When Martha gets drunk again her children force her to leave the house. Ash invites her boyfriend Ally to move in. Martha returns and tells her children that she is back for good. Martha becomes suspicious of Ally as does Callum. When Martha gets drunk Ally insults her which makes her more determined to rid of him. Martha pretends to be drunk and Ally uses the opportunity to be nasty to her, thinking she will not remember. But as Martha needs to expose him after it is discovered he has lied about his identity. Phoebe Jackson (Mandip Gill) informs Martha that Lacey plans on sleeping with Ally. She manages to get home in time to prevent it and he is arrested for identity fraud. Martha is known to hate the character Callum Ash because he betrayed her for Michael. The deaths of her children Callum and Ash devastate Martha and she turns up at a memorial for Ash drunk, she begins to suspect Will was responsible for the deaths of Anna and Texas. Will, worrying that his crimes will be exposed holds his family hostage with a shotgun at Anna's house, including Sienna Blake (Anna Passey) who was holding Tom Cunningham (Ellis Hollins) hostage, Martha is also taken hostage by Will and when he tells her she can go he shoots her, however, Martha was only wounded and alerts the police which brings about Will's downfall as he and his brother Dodger Savage (Danny Mac) fight on the roof of the house and both fall from the roof, Dodger is unharmed but Will is paralysed from the fall and is arrested. Martha decides there is nothing to stay in Hollyoaks for and after saying goodbye to the Savages she leaves the village to go and live with her sister and Lacey. Reception Laura Morgan from All About Soap said that Martha \\"if there were ever an award for soap's worst mum then Hollyoaks Martha Kane would be a sure-fire contender. Immature, irresponsible, alcoholic‚Ä¶ The list just goes on and on.\\" Morgan stated that Martha should confront her problems and pay her bills. Martha's \\"reckless behaviour\\" has a \\"massive effect\\" on Callum and it was not his responsibility to sort Martha's problems. The writer concluded that Martha would not solve her problems because \\"it'll be left to Callum to pick up the pieces while she drowns her sorrows in another bottle of cheap plonk!\\" In a poll run by Hollyoaks official website to discover the best mum out of Martha, Myra McQueen (Nicole Barber-Lane) and Diane O'Connor (Alex Fletcher), Martha received the fewest votes, with over 240 votes and only 3% of the total votes. A writer from TV Magazine said that drinking champagne around Martha was not the greatest idea because she \\"is struggling to stay away from the demon drink\\". The writer was unsurprised that \\"troubled Martha\\" cannot resist a drink and falls \\"off the wagon big time\\". They concluded that \\"one thing's for sure - it's going to be a while before the Kane's are playing happy families again.\\" A writer from the Metro said that Martha had a \\"gentle exit\\" which was a \\"more low-key fashion\\" than the more dramatic departures Hollyoaks had been airing in 2013. They added that many viewers were disappointed that Norris had left. Kilkelly opined that the character left in \\"high regard\\". A reporter from What's on TV said it was a shock exit and also agreed that the character left on a \\"high\\".

Dong Qichang. 1621-24. The Wangchuan ji () is a collection of Tang poetry written by the two poets Wang Wei (ÁéãÁ∂≠) and Pei Di (Ë£¥Ëø™), also known in other ways, such as Wheel River Collection. The verses are based on a series of twenty scenes, inspired by the sights available at Wang Wei's retirement estate: each one forms the topic for a pair of one five-character quatrains, one by each of the poetic pair, first Wang Wei, then Pei Di. Besides the long- term interest in these verses, in China, this anthology has created much interest around the world, including numerous translations, especially Wang's version of \\"Deer Park\\". Several complete translations of the whole work have been done, in English . A series of \\"Twenty Scenes\\" of Wangchuan were done as a painting series. The Wangchuan poems (and related artworks) form an important part of traditional Chinese Shan shui landscape painting and Shanshui poetry development. There are clear indications of the influence of the Six Dynasties poet early exemplar of landscape genre poetry Xie Lingyun's poems on topics, partly inspired by his family estate, in what is today Zhejiang. The considerable influence of Pei Di and Wang Wei's Wangchuan ji shows in much subsequent painting, music, and poetry. Setting Some of Wang Wei's most famous poetry was done as a series of quatrains written by him to which his friend Pei Di wrote replying double couplets. Together, these form a group titled the Wang River Collection. Note that \\"Wang\\" as in the river is a different character that the \\"Wang\\" of Wang Wei's name. Wang literally refers to the outside part of a wheel, chuan means \\"river\\" and ji means a collection. Sometimes, also, these are sometimes referred to as the \\"Lantian poems\\", after the real name of Wang's estate's location, in Lantian County. Wang Wei's career as a government official had its ups and downs. One of his early positions was serving in Liangzhou, which then was a term used to refer to the larger area of Wuwei. After completing his service there and returning to the capital city of Chang'an, Wang Wei took the opportunity of his temporary lack of official posting to explore the countryside to the south of the capital, in the Lantian area of the Zhongnan Mountains. As well, Wang Wei then made friends with Pei Di.Chang, 60 In 740-741 Wang resumed his successful governmental career, including an inspection tour of Xiangyang, Hubei, and then he held various positions in Chang'an. Besides the official salary connected with this government work, he had received financial rewards as an artist; thus he was able to acquire a sizable estate in Lantian, formerly owned by the poet Song Zhiwen (approximately 660‚Äì712), an estate known as Wang Chuan.Chang, 61 Upon his Lantian estate Wang Wei established a shrine for sake of his Buddhist mother, and after his mother died, in 747-748, he spent the traditional three-year morning period for the death of a parent in this location, during which time he was reportedly so afflicted by grief as to having been reduced almost to a skeleton.Chang, 61 Inspired, in part, by Wang's Lantian home and features found in its neighborhood and their correspondences with other places and features, the collection includes such pieces as the poem often translated \\"Deer Park\\" (literally, \\"Deer Fence\\"). However, the poems tend to have a deceptive simplicity to them, while they actually have great depth and complexity upon closer examination. Part of the complexity derives from the ironic juxtaposition of imagination and exaggeration with the realities of a retired official's situation at the time. In these poems, there is a theme of metaphorical comparison between features of Wang's estate and places well known to the poets to the poets and their audience to have famously existed elsewhere in the world as known to them. Wang Wei may have had a fence to keep deer out of his vegetable garden, but an actual deer park (as in Europe at the time) would have been a royal prerogative; however, in the poets' imagination the two become one. The real life location of Wang Wei's retirement home was in the foothills of the Qinling Mountains, south of the Tang capital city of Chang'an, in what is now Lantian County, of Xi'an Sub-provincial city, of Shaanxi. The poems tend to literally describe the posh and palatial features of a fantastic and enormous estate; however these specific details should be viewed within the context of poetic flights of fancy (and a dry humour): as art critic and Chinese scholar John Ferguson put it, in regards to the Wheel River property as describe by the two poets: Jerome Ch'en and Michael Bullock describe Wang Wei's studio: Modern influence The Wheel River poems record the poets' journey, ostensibly that of Wang Wei and his close friend Pei Di. They are far more universal than a few simple day trips to admire the scenery and have inspired generations of poets since, including recent adaptations such as Pain Not Bread's Introduction to the Introduction to Wang Wei (), Barry Gifford's Replies to Wang Wei () and Gary Blankenship's A River Transformed (). and Eliot Weinberger and Octavio Paz's 19 Ways of Looking at Wang Wei () is an essay concerning more than 19 translations of Wang Wei's \\"Deer Park\\". Furthermore, the imaginary series of views inspired subsequent series of \\"Twenty Views of Wang Chuan\\" paintings or panoramas including the twenty views (actually the painting tradition for some reason contains a variant set of the twenty scenes of the poems).

It consists of one or more rows of male pins typically spaced apart, but common sizes also include , , , , and . The distance between pins (measured from center to center) is known as pitch. In the past, a pin header was known as a Berg connector, but the term fell out of favor because pin headers are manufactured by many companies. Overview Pin headers are often associated with ribbon cable connectors, pin headers often also function as recipients for jumpers. The most common jumper spacing is , though is sometimes used in smaller products. Pin header connectors are thus \\"male\\" connectors (\\"female\\" counterparts do exist, but these are normally just called female header (FH) or header connector, without \\"pin\\") and are mostly used inside equipment, rather than being used as a connector on the outside of the device.Glossary entry about headers; InterfaceBus.com Normally pin headers are through-hole (THT) devices, but surface-mount technology (SMT) versions of one and two row pin headers also exist. In the latter case the solder sides of the pins are simply bent on a 90 degree angle so as to be soldered to a solder plane. On single row pin headers the pins are bent alternating to one side or the other, on dual row pin headers the pins are simply bent outwards. If pin headers are optional, the THT variant is often chosen for ease of manual assembly. Pin headers can be either straight or angled. The latter form is often used to connect two boards together. Pin headers are cost-effective due to their simplicity. Headers are often sold as long strips (typically 40 or 50 pins for the dual row versions) which can easily be broken off to the right number of pins. Shrouded or Box header Pin headers with a plastic guide box around them are known as box headers (BH) or shrouded headers and are normally only used in combination with insulation-displacement connectors (IDC) for ribbon cables. A notch (key) in the guide box normally prevents placing the connector (polarised by a \\"bump\\" on one side) the wrong way around.Glossary entry about shrouded headers; InterfaceBus.com Polarizer key Some systems polarize or key the pin header connection with something that fills and blocks one of the holes in the sockets.\\"USB 3.0 Header to USB 2.0 Header pinout\\"\\"Voided Header Pins and Blanked Socket Cavities\\"Lee Penrod.\\"How to Install Front USB by Connecting Front USB Ports to a Motherboard\\". Quote: \\"One pin is blocked so that it is impossible to install improperly.\\" One pin of the wrong pin header (or the correct pin header rotated in the wrong orientation) hits that obstruction and prevents an incorrect connection. The correct pin header has one or more pins in the header removed or clipped to indicate a key for correct orientation. Pin numbering In absence of a pin 1 designation on the header, if a designation is missing from the header, the PCB may have a marking indicating orientation (often the solder pad around the hole of pin 1 of a THT header is square rather than round). For multi-row pin headers, the pin number is more complex, because knowing the location of pin 1 doesn't automatically ensure how the remaining pins are numbered. Typically for headers attached to ribbon cables, the pins are numbered so they go linearly across the cable. Because of the way the connector attaches to the cable, this means in a two-row header, pins in one row have odd numbers and pins in the other row have even numbers.10 pin IDC male connector diagram and applications pinouts See also * Electrical connector * DC connector * Insulation- displacement connector (IDC) * JST connector * Jump wire * Jumper (computing) References External links ;Examples: * Square Post Header, Male, 0.1-inch center, samtec.com * Socket Strip, Female, 0.1-inch center, samtec.com * Shrouded Square Headers, Male, 0.1-inch center, samtec.com Category:Electrical connectors Category:Electrical signal connectors ","title":"Pin header"},{"id":"34331114","text":"Darreh Zhan () may refer to: *Darreh Zhan-e Bala *Darreh Zhan-e Pain ","title":"Darreh Zhan"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:P}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},R={class:"card-container"};function I(s,e,o,c,u,i){const m=y("PoemCard");return t(),n(h,null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("section",null,[a("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâ your ETHü•≥")])])],-1)),a("section",null,[a("div",R,[(t(!0),n(h,null,p(i.visiblePoems,(r,g)=>(t(),b(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const D=d(B,[["render",I]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/23.md","filePath":"library/23.md"}'),H={name:"library/23.md"},F=Object.assign(H,{setup(s){return(e,o)=>(t(),n("div",null,[v(D)]))}});export{L as __pageData,F as default};
