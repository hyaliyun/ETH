The building was erected in an elevated position looking out over the township of Newmarket. In 1861, the land was purchased by Alfred's first wife Eliza for ¬£1,000. The family with seven children, moved into the house in 1862. Eliza Buckland had two more children during her short time alive in her new house, she died of pneumonia in July 1866. The original eight room house was extended in 1874, 1883 and 1884 as the Buckland family grew bigger and their wealth increased. Alfred Buckland married Matilda Jane Frodsham in May 1867. Matilda was twenty years younger than Alfred and went on to have eleven children of her own, nine of them surviving to adulthood. Matilda outlived Alfred, spending her declining years at Highiwc. The building included a ballroom, seven bedrooms, a boy's dormitory, a laundry, kitchen, scullery, outside stables, grooms accommodation, a billiard house, and a service yard. By the early 20th century two inside bathrooms were added with baths, hand basins, flushing toilets and hot and cold water on tap! Family descendants who lived in the house until 1978 made alterations of their own. The property was then jointly purchased by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust (now Heritage New Zealand) and Auckland City Council to save the site from subdivision. Highwic was opened as a historic house museum in 1981. = Functions and celebrations = A reception for the Duke of Kent and Katharine, Duchess of Kent was held at Highwic in 1980.

Diplomatic relations were established on January 22, 1964. There is a community of thousands of Iranians in the Philippines including many international students drawn by the country's low-cost English education.  Diplomatic relations  thumb Iran and the Philippines have embassies in one another's capitals, though the two do not share extensive bilateral relations. In August 2003, Manila and Tehran held their first bilateral conference entitled \\"Dialogue Among Civilizations\\". In April 2008, Philippine Secretary of Foreign Affairs Alberto Romulo called for the expansion of bilateral ties with Iran and claimed that the two countries have enjoyed good relations in the past, giving promise to a positive future relationship. During an April 2009 meeting with the Filipino Ambassador to Iran, Generoso Senga, Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki noted the positive nature of bilateral ties and expressed hope that relations, especially in the fields of energy, technology, science, and culture, would continue to expand. In the same meeting, Mottaki blamed the reactions of ‚Äúextra-regional powers‚Äù for expanding extremism in Asia. In February 2010, the Emilio Aguinaldo College in Manila opened Iranian Cultural Week, which hosted a series of programs and exhibits on Iranian culture. The series was attended by Iran's cultural ambassador and several Iranian cultural and political figures. On June 28, 2010, Mottaki demanded that the Philippine government conduct ‚Äúan effective investigation‚Äù into a bus crash that left several Iranian medical students dead. Ambassador Senaga responded to Mottaki's concerns saying he has ‚Äúbeen pursuing the incident. Iranian Ambassador to the Philippines Ali Asghar Mohammadi said that's \\"Iran is committed to improving its overall relationship with the Philippines\\". On January 31, 2016, the Philippines expressed its plans to establish an honorary consulate in Kish considering the presence of Filipinos in the Iranian coastal city.  Economic relations  Hydrocarbons remain the main avenue of economic interaction for Iran and the Philippines. In 2006, the Philippines purchased between 70,000 and 110,000 barrels of oil a day from Iran, making the country one of the Philippines‚Äô most significant trade partners in the region. In 2008, Iran agreed to invest $125 million petrochemical market in the Philippines. Iran and the Philippines have agreed to ensure better labour conditions for Filipino maritime workers. The sides penned a memorandum of agreement following a June 2010 meeting of the 2010 Diplomatic Conference of Parties to the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification, and Watchkeeping. According to the agreement, Iran will henceforth recognize Philippine maritime certificates of competencies. Then-Filipino Labor Secretary Marianito Roque expressed his ‚Äúappreciation to the Iranian government for its willingness to enter into an agreement with the Philippines and claimed that ‚Äúthe recognition is essential to the continued employment of Filipino seafarers in the international maritime industry. As of February 2016, Iran is one of the six nations which the Philippines has a Joint Economic Commission at a ministerial level. =US-led sanction on Iran= As part of sanctions against Iran's nuclear program by the United States, the Philippines was pressured to import less oil from Iran to avoid facing sanctions itself. On 2011, the Philippines imported 5.9 million barrels of crude oil from Iran. However by the end of March 2012, the Philippines did not import any oil from Iran.http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/04/22/209551.html Earlier on January 2012, President Benigno Aquino III appealed to a number of U.S. lawmakers to consider Philippine interests, as it would want to maintain \\"non- harmful\\" trade with Iran. Philippine fruit exports to Iran was greatly affected. 30 percent of Philippine banana exports goes to Iran. In June 2013, Iran has expressed concerns that the Philippines is \\"missing opportunities\\" by giving in to the United States and other Western countries demand to cooperate in their efforts to sanction Iran. Ali A. Mohammadi, Iranian ambassador to the Philippines, noted that annual trade between Iran and the Philippines dropped to a \\"minimal level\\", from 2011's balance of $900 million. Obstacles against the trade relations between the two countries were reduced with the easing of sanctions against Iran with the securing of the Iran nuclear deal.  Nuclear program  Philippine Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Rafael Seguis voiced his government's support in June 2008 for Iran's right to use peaceful nuclear energy. The undersecretary said that given rising hydrocarbon prices, all countries should be able to access civilian nuclear energy. In April 2008, Romulo also said that his country supports Iran's right to access peaceful nuclear technology under the safeguards of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Security relations In 2016, Iran offered to share intelligence to the Philippines in an effort to combat terrorism in Southeast Asia, particularly to deter the militant organization, ISIS from establishing itself in the region.

She served as a military pilot during World War II and began a photography career in her forties. Early years Noggle was born in Evanston, Illinois, in 1922, and died in Albuquerque, New Mexico on August 16, 2005. She set a goal of becoming a pilot after seeing Amelia Earhart at an air show in Chicago. When she was 17, her mother, a bookstore manager, agreed to let her take flying lessons. WASP of World War II At 21, Noggle traveled to Sweetwater, Texas, to train to become one of the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP). She graduated in the class of 44-W-1. She flew missions in 1943 and 1944. The WASP were disbanded in late 1944. After the war, she became a crop- duster in the Southwest and flew stunts in an aerial circus. When the Air Force offered commissions to former WASPs after the war, she applied and was a pilot during the Korean War. She retired as a captain in 1959 when she developed emphysema.\\"Anne Noggle, 83; Photographed Older Women\\", Los Angeles Times, retrieved Sep 4, 2005.Anne Noggle Museum of Contemporary Photography. She later described her aviation career this way: \\"I flew airplanes for a living for eleven years and 6,000 hours . . . When I was twenty-five I became a stunt pilot with an air show; when I was twenty-six I became a crop-duster pilot.\\"Silver Lining, page 29. While in the Air Force, Noggle had been stationed in Paris. She visited the Louvre, which ignited an artistic impulse. Education Noggle went back to school, at the University of New Mexico; she earned a bachelor's degree in fine art in 1966 and in 1969 graduated with a master's degree in art. She developed her skills as a photographer and developed an interest in documenting the aging process of women ‚Äì including her own \\"witty and challenging\\" self-portraits.Anne Noggle biography Wings Across America The University of New Mexico gave her an honorary doctorate, acknowledging her \\"extensive contribution to the field of art and art history.\\" Photography career Influenced by female photographers such as Julia Margaret Cameron and Diane Arbus, Noggle's work mainly focused on the aging process of women, a subject which she referred to as \\"the saga of the fallen flesh\\". Using humor and pathos to depict the women she photographed, Noggle photographed her subjects in a way that displayed both femininity and sexual energy.

That interests me, not the idea of aging itself.\\" * \\"I find young faces a tabula rasa, nothing is written there. They are empty until they reach their 40s. Then they become photographable.\\" References 1922 births 2005 deaths American aviators Women Airforce Service Pilots United States Army Air Forces pilots of World War II Photographers from Illinois Women photographers Photography curators People from Evanston, Illinois Artists from Evanston, Illinois University of New Mexico alumni University of New Mexico faculty 20th-century American women artists American female aviators Photographers from New Mexico 20th-century women photographers ","title":"Anne Noggle"},{"id":"38561534","text":"The 2013 Charleston Battery season will be the club's 21st season of existence.

It was shortlisted for the first Orange Prize for Fiction in 1996. Plot The novel describes an American road trip by two unmarried thirty-something sisters, Frannie and Doris. Doris was popular and pretty in high school, and still keen to keep moving and meet men, while the narrator Frannie is less keen on the journey and shyer around men. Following their father's death they set out on a journey through America. The action takes place in the late 1960s, and reflects the changes American society was undergoing at the time. Critical response Publishers Weekly found it \\"thoroughly delightful\\"; they praised the character of Frannie refuted criticisms of the way she achieves selfhood through loving a man. Entertainment Weekly considered that it lacked the subtlety of Kennedy's debut short story collection Stripping, and said its attempts to link the characters with wider social trends were strained. Kirkus Reviews called it \\"deeply flawed, if admirable\\", due to the attempts to fit in social relevance, and Frannie's voice inconsistent, drifting between \\"faux-naif\\" and worldly. The Austin Chronicle thought that it was too short to do justice to its themes, despite its \\"great setting, great characters, and great writing\\".

Vani's core strength and love has always been bhakti and singing compositions filled with bhakti rasa. Vani was in the US after her marriage and started performing extensively outside of India. Since mid-90s, Vani has performed in various reputed Sabhas in US and India. Vani Sateesh is a regular performer for both All India Radio, Doordarshan and various TV Channels. Vani has also had her initial music training from her brother Sri Ballari M Raghavendra. Music training Raghavendra\`s initial training was under the tutelage of his uncle Ballari M. Sheshagiri Achar who went on to create 400 kritis. He was also greatly influenced by his father Ballari M. Venkatesh Achar. Raghavendra considers himself lucky that he had two gurus who constantly took him on the right path. In contrast, the opportunities for Ballari Brothers were limited when they were trying to establish themselves. Musical Performance Raghavendra started giving stage performances at a very young age. He gave his first stage performance at the age of 9 years. Raghavendra has produced many music-based programmes such as Aaswaada (on music appreciation), Swarasangama (on teaching music) and many other musical features, which are highly popular among the music-lovers and general public. Raghavendra is a dedicated music teacher who has a rare ability to identify and groom music students based on their individual strengths. Popular singer Vijay Prakash of \\"Jai Ho\\" (song) fame is known to have learnt Carnatic music under Raghavendra while he was in Mysore. In addition to being a vocalist, he is well versed in Konnakol and Morsing. When Raghavendra moved from Mysore to Dharwad he also learnt Hindustani vocal music from Pandit Chandrashekar Puranikmath a renowned hindustani musician from Gwalior Gharana who retired from AIR Radio Dharwad.Raghavendra often uses expressions of Hindustani music in his concerts especially while delivering devotional compositions of Haridasas. He also has performed jugalbandis with eminent Hindustani vocalists in musical concerts. Raghavendra with TAS R Mani and H.K.NarasimhaMurthy after they were honoured by Ragalaya Sangeeta Balaga at Nadabrahma Sangeetha Sabha Raghavendra has presented numerous illustrative talks and demonstrations on music. He has toured Europe and Canada along with TAS R Mani Ensemble. He has been very successful in establishing and promoting classical music in remote areas of Karnataka where the classical form of music was non-existent. Vishesha Fine Arts a not-for-profit charitable trust is run under the guidance of Artists like Vani Sateesh, Mysore M. Nagaraj, Mysore M. Manjunath, painters B.K.S. Varma, G.N. Seetharamiah and Sri Bellary M Raghavendra. It is started with an intention to provide Fine arts education in schools; bringing rare concerts to the public; and recognizing the efforts of individuals striving to propagate music in society. Vishesha Utsava 2020 An annual event called Vishesha Utsava is also conducted under the banner of Vishesha Fine Arts where various artists render their performance. The organization was inaugurated on 29 January 2011 and Sri Mysore Sateesh is the trustee of this organization. Music style Traditions in rendering and concert packaging were passed on quite well to Raghavendra. Ballari school of Music has the rare distinction of nurturing pathantara of time-honoured clarity, a technique that gathered fine distinctions and gradations with the influence of approaches from the Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and interior Andhra music schools. Another style of the Ballari school of Music is, the raga taken up for the warm-up varna would be there for raga tana pallavi. Taking off a piece from anupallavi is yet another style of the Ballari school of Music.

Acting philosophy In an address to the Rochester Community Players on September 25, 1941, at the Sagamore Hotel, Hackett expounded on his theory of acting. He stated that Mrs. Fiske (first cousin to Robert Stevens, the managing director of the Community Players) was the pioneer of the 'ultra modern' school of acting, which considered taboo anything that \\"savors of exaggeration in voice or action. This striving toward naturalism has created a tendency in the profession to underplay. Motion pictures, a repressed art, have contributed to this tendency, for in them there must be no jerky movements, no grand gestures.\\" He went on to say \\"I agree that the natural school of acting is the better school, but not at the loss of getting your lines across. That's the important thing, and all the 'drawing room manner' you can command on the stage is ineffective if the audience cannot hear those cultured voices or understand those gentle gestures.\\"As quoted in a newspaper article of the Rochester Times-Union, dated September 26, 1941, located in the 1941‚Äì1944 Scrapbook of the Rochester Community Players, on deposit with the Local History Department of the Rochester, NY Public Library Later years Following his acting career, Hackett served as National Secretary of the Theta Delta Chi Fraternity.

Early life Thomas Streatfeild Clarkson was born in 1837 to Thomas Streatfeild Clarkson II (1799‚Äì1873) and Elizabeth Clarkson (1810‚Äì1883), who were first cousins. He had one brother, Levinus Clarkson (1835‚Äì1876), and three sisters, Elizabeth (1833‚Äì1918), Frederica (1846‚Äì1909), and Lavinia Clarkson (1842‚Äì1926). His paternal grandparents were Thomas Streatfeild Clarkson (1763-1844) and Elizabeth Van Horne (1771-1852). His uncle, David Augustus Clarkson, was married to the former Margaret Livingston (the daughter of Edward Philip Livingston, the Lt. Governor of New York from 1831 to 1832). His cousins included Elizabeth (n√©e Clarkson) Barnwell and Thomas Streatfeild Clarkson. He attended the St. Lawrence Academy and then received private tutoring. Career While the Clarkson family was wealthy from stock investments and real estate holdings, but required all of the sons to learn a trade, so Clarkson and his brother Levinus operated the family's farm until Levinus' death. At this time, Clarkson engaged in other business endeavors in Potsdam, New York including developing local electrical power plants and the first sewer system in the area and operating large sandstone quarries on the Raquette River in 1877. Clarkson and a cousin founded the Potsdam Public Library and Reading Room and a tuition-free night school teaching mechanical drawing. Clarkson made a large donation to Trinity Episcopal Church in Potsdam in honor of his father. =Death= Clarkson was accidentally killed while working in his sandstone quarry not far from Potsdam. When a worker was in danger of being crushed by a loose pump, Clarkson pushed him out of the way risking his own life. Clarkson was crushed against a wall by the swinging pump, sunstaining severe internal injuries. He died five days later. The Clarkson family realized great wealth in the development of such quarries, and Potsdam sandstone was highly sought after by developers of townhouses in New York City and elsewhere. The family were important benefactors in the Potsdam area. After his death, Clarkson's three sisters decided to fund a school, which would be named after their brother. The school was founded in 1896 and was called the Thomas S. Clarkson Memorial School of Technology before it later became Clarkson University. Upon his niece, Annie Clarkson's, death in 1929, she made the College her chief beneficiary.

It is in the community of Rosemark, Tennessee, near the border of Shelby and Tipton County, Tennessee.  History  Tipton-Rosemark Academy‚Äôs inception came after local residents became concerned about their children‚Äôs education following the removal of required government-sponsored Bible reading from public schools. An elementary school was established in a house in Munford, Tennessee and was christened Tipton Academy, after the county in which the school then resided. In 1967, a new facility was built in the nearby town of Brighton, Tennessee. In 1970, a kindergarten was added to the Brighton location, doubling the size of the establishment. In the same year, Tipton Academy purchased Rosemark School from Shelby County in hopes of expanding the academy into grades 9-12. The newly acquired school was named Rosemark Academy. Some historians have cited Rosemark Academy as an example of a segregation academy. In 1980, Rosemark Academy was forced to cancel a football game at Pioneer Christian Academy because Pioneer Christian administrators felt that the Rosemark Academy cheerleader‚Äôs uniforms were too revealing. Seventh and eighth grades were moved to the Rosemark Academy in 1986 as the first step to consolidate all grades to the Rosemark campus. As part of the consolidation process, a new elementary school building was constructed in 1988. The decision was then made to combine the names of the two schools, thus creating the modern name of Tipton-Rosemark Academy. In 1998, a capital campaign was begun for the construction of a separate middle school building. $550,000 was raised, and groundbreaking for the new building occurred in the fall of 1999. Also in 1999, a $1,000,000 donation was made to the school by the estate of Paul Barret, Jr. The money was used to buy land adjacent to school property, and to begin dirt work on a sporting complex, later named the Paul Barret, Jr. Sportsplex. The project was finished in 2006, with the first home varsity football game being September 1 of that year. Lights over the baseball and softball fields, as well as a concession stand, were added in 2008. A new capital campaign began in 2006. Entitling it the Continuing the Tradition Campaign, TRA used the campaign to raise funds for the building of a new high school, as well as an addition to the existing elementary school. With the new football fields constructed, the new building was built on the obsolete Rebel Football Field, where TRA had hosted football games since 1970. When the high school was completed, it was adjoined to the existing middle school, allowing students to transit between the buildings without leaving the indoors. In 2008, it was announced that the old Rosemark School building was to be torn down to make room for new performing arts building. In addition to the proposed performing arts center, the antiquated building had been deemed legally unfit to use by updated fire codes. A fundraiser was hastily put together by local residents and alumni who wished to see the building preserved. The measure fell short of its goal, and the school was demolished only a month following the school‚Äôs announcement. The corner stones of the historic building were saved and used as the basis of the new performing arts building.  Athletics  TRA is a member of the TSSAA, classified as Division II, Class A West. The school's mascot is the Rebel, and all sports teams are known as the TRA Rebels. Football, basketball, volleyball, soccer, softball, baseball, tennis, golf, cross country, and cheerleading are offered as varsity athletics.

It is endowed with fertile alluvial soil ground water resources. This makes the agriculture of Bihar rich and diverse. Rice, wheat, and maize are the major cereal crops. Arhar, urad, moong, gram, pea, lentils, and khesaria are some of the pulses cultivated in Bihar. Bihar is the largest producer of vegetables, which is dominated by potato, onion, eggplant, and cauliflower. In fruit cultivation, it is the largest producer of lychee and the third largest producer of pineapple, as well as a major producer of mango, banana, and guava. Sugar cane and jute are two other major cash crops of Bihar. Cropping pattern The net sown area in Bihar is 60% of its geographical area. This percentage is much higher than the all-India average of 42%. Such a high percentage of cultivated land is possible for two reasons. First, most of Bihar is plain area suitable for agriculture. Second, most of the forest had been converted into farmland during the last 2000 years. Currently, land under forest constitutes only 6% of the area. North Bihar is a productive agricultural center, while South Bihar is hindered by its flood and drought prone geography. In the south, the Ahar-Pyne system of agriculture has long been used to cultivate crops.Koul, D. N., Singh, S., Neelam, G., & Shukla, G. (2012). Traditional water management systems-An overview of Ahar-pyne system in South Bihar plains of India and need for its revival. Food grains Rice is cultivated in all districts of Bihar. Autumn rice, aghani rice, and summer rice are three different varieties of rice grown at three different times of the year. The average production of rice is around 5 million tonnes each year. Some five decades back, wheat cultivation was very restricted to western districts of Bihar. After green revolution success, wheat was planted by Bihari farmers on a larger scale, and wheat now occupies the status of major crop of the rabi (spring) season. The average annual wheat production is approximately 4-4.5 million tonnes. Maize is also cultivated, with an average annual production level of approximately 1.5 million tonnes and a steady positive trend in production. The leading producer districts are Khagaria and Saharsa. Pulses such as moong, arhar, peas, and khesari are grown, more in southern than in northern Bihar. The leading districts are Patna, Bhojpur, Aurangabad, and Nalanda. Vegetables The total area under vegetable cultivation is currently about 11% of the state's gross sown area, and is increasing. The important vegetable crops include potato, onion, tomato, cauliflower, and brinjal. Hajipur in Vaishali is famous for an early variety of cauliflower that reaches market in the last week of September. Production of vegetables is well dispersed over the districts, with a concentration of production in some particular districts. Apart from Patna and Nalanda (Jehanabad), where vegetable production is quite extensive, the other districts with high shares in total vegetable production are Vaishali, Muzaffarpur, West Champaran, East Champaran, Katihar, and Begusarai.http://finance.bih.nic.in/Budget/Economic-Survey-2012-En.pdf References .

Life Louis- Marie Baudouin was born on 2 August 1765 as the last of eight children. He commenced his studies for the priesthood and was educated at the Seminary of Lu√ßon in the Vend√©e. He was ordained as a Catholic priest at Saint-Malo on 19 September 1789. In 1790 Baudouin refused to swear to the Civil Constitution of the Clergy of the new French government during the French Revolution. As a result of this opposition he went into exile to Spain on 9 September 1792 along with 234 other priests. He spent four years in Toledo. On 17 August 1797, Baudouin returned to France with his brother Pierre, and lived illegally for two years at Les Sables-d'Olonne. In 1799 Napoleon Bonaparte allowed free exercise of worship following the end of the wars of the Vend√©e. He was appointed to the parish of la Jonch√®re on 31 July 1801 at Chavagnes-en- Paillers. In 1803 a seminary was established in Chavagnes - now a part of Chavagnes International College. Baudouin would visit the sick in the night dressed in disguise. He was a driving force for Marian devotion and constant reception of the sacraments. In 1805 he undertook the beginning of a small society of the children of Mary. This became the twin congregations of the Sons of Mary Immaculate and the Ursulines of Jesus. In 1812 the seminary of Chavagnes was transferred, on the orders of Napoleon, to La Rochelle. Baudouin moved to La Rochelle where he was appointed as the superior of the seminary and as the vicar general of the diocese. In 1821 the diocese of Lu√ßon was restored and Chavagnes once again became the major seminary; Baudouin was re- appointed as its rector as well as being vicar general of the diocese. Baudouin - in 1829 - retired to Chavagnes-en-Paillers. He died there at the age of 69. Beatification cause The cause of beatification commenced in France and spanned from 1864-5 which also bestowed upon him the title of Servant of God. Despite the fact that the cause commenced at this stage the formal introduction of the cause was on 7 September 1871 under Pope Pius IX. It continued on a local level and the two processes were ratified on 26 August 1911. The Positio - the documentation on his life of heroic virtue - was sent to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in 1996 for further evaluation. Pope Benedict XVI recognized his heroic virtue on 20 December 2012 and declared him to be Venerable. A miracle alleged to have been of his intercession was also investigated and the process that investigated the miracle was validated on 2 April 2009. The medical board that works for the Congregation for the Causes of Saints approved the miracle on 21 March 2013.

Their next officially recognised series was against New Zealand, more than eleven years later. In 1977, they were excluded from competing in international sporting events, when the Commonwealth of Nations signed the Gleneagles Agreement as part of the international campaign against apartheid. Although the men's national team returned to international cricket in 1991, the women's team did not compete again until 1997, when they toured Ireland and England. Since then, the team has played regularly in One Day Internationals (ODI). The introduction of Twenty20 cricket in the early part of the 21st century has all but eliminated Test cricket from the woman's game. South Africa have played five Test matches since their return, and 71 Twenty20 Internationals (T20I) since their first such contest in 2007. South Africa have played four different sides in women's Test cricket, with England their most frequent opponent, having faced them in six Tests. The only side that South Africa have beaten in Test cricket are the Netherlands, who South Africa have played once, in 2007. South Africa have similarly faced England more times than any other team in women's One Day International cricket, playing 33 matches. As such, England have recorded the most victories against South Africa, beating them 25 times. South Africa have beaten Pakistan more times than any other country, triumphing on twelve occasions against them. In women's T20Is, South Africa have as well played England the most, and lost to them on thirteen occasions.

It was co-written by Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz, while being directed by Dean White. In this episode, Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison), Henry (Jared S. Gilmore), and Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle) arrive in Manhattan to find his son Baelfire (Michael Raymond-James), only to have Emma regret the trip after past memories come back to haunt her. Meanwhile, in the Enchanted Forest, a young Rumplestiltskin is to fight in the Ogre Wars, but is then hesitant after a seer (Shannon Lucio) reveals his fate. The episode was received positively by critics, with most praising Robert Carlyle's role as Rumplestiltskin during the flashback. The episode also saw an increase in ratings from the previous episode, with 7.50 million viewers watching, garnering an 18-49 rating of 2.4. Plot=Opening Sequence= The skyline of New York City appears in the forest. =In the Characters' Past= Rumplestiltskin (Robert Carlyle) is drafted into the Ogres War. Milah (Rachel Shelley) is alarmed, but Rumplestiltskin is eager to free himself of his father's legacy of cowardice. Milah exhorts him to fight honorably, and hopes they'll start a family when he returns. At the front, he is assigned to guard a prisoner, which proves to be a young girl who has deformed eye sockets but functioning eyes on her hands; she is a Seer, able to see the past and future. She demonstrates her knowledge of Rumplestiltskin's earlier life, then informs him that Milah is pregnant with a son, but that Rumplestiltskin's actions the next day will leave the child fatherless. He doesn't believe her, but she says he will once the army rides cows into battle. That night, another soldier describes their wounded comrades as lucky, because they'll be sent home. The men are then ordered to ride into battle, on leather saddles termed \\"cows.\\" Rumplestiltskin panics and, believing he is destined to die in battle the next day, crushes his own leg with a hammer. Rumplestiltskin returns home to find Milah cradling their son, Baelfire. She is aghast to see confirmation of the rumor that he took the cowardly action of wounding himself to escape the battle, and she denounces him. He didn't want to leave his son fatherless as his own father did by abandoning him, but Milah says that to be Rumplestiltskin's son is a worse fate, and it would have been better if he had died. Milah angrily leaves, and Rumplestiltskin promises to never leave Baelfire. Years later, after Baelfire has left the Enchanted Forest, Rumplestiltskin tracks down the now-adult Seer (Shannon Lucio) and criticizes her for omitting the details of his destiny. He then attacks her and demands to know how to find his son. She says that he will find him after many years and that it will require a powerful curse that will be both cast and broken by others. When he demands to know more, she asks him to take on the \\"burden\\" of her prophetic powers. He agrees, but is overcome by a multitude of visions, while the Seer is left dying. She tells him that, with time, he will learn to understand. As she dies, she informs him that he'll be led to his son by a boy who will also be his undoing. Rumplestiltskin states his intention to kill that boy. =In New York City= In New York City, Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison), Henry (Jared S. Gilmore), and Mr. Gold (Carlyle) arrive at an apartment building that Gold's magic identified as Baelfire's location. Emma rings the only buzzer that lacks an occupant's name, claiming to be delivering a package; someone immediately flees the building via the fire escape. Gold demands that Emma fulfill her favor by bringing Baelfire to talk to him, so she gives chase and, upon tackling him, is shocked to recognize Baelfire as her former lover, Neal Cassidy (Michael Raymond-James). They argue over her bringing Rumplestiltskin to New York and Neal abandoning Emma years earlier, and Neal ultimately agrees to continue the conversation only if Emma will join him at a bar. There, Neal explains that he didn't originally know her identity but was informed of it by August Booth; it is revealed that what August showed him was a typewritten statement identifying him as Baelfire. Emma finds their coincidental meeting to be inexplicable, but Neal suggests that it was fate and that something good may have come from their relationship; Emma denies it. When he notices that she still wears the keychain he gave her, she returns it to him and says it's only a reminder not to trust anyone. She tells him she intends to uphold her deal with Gold, but he asks that she lie that she was unable to catch him, as this will end all contact between them. Emma calls Mary Margaret (Ginnifer Goodwin) to explain the situation; Baelfire/Neal is Henry's father. Mary Margaret says that Henry deserves to know the truth, but Emma wants to protect Henry; Mary Margaret suggests that she is trying to protect herself. Mary Margaret then tells David (Josh Dallas) about Emma's discovery, and they discuss how everyone in their family might be affected by it. Meanwhile, Henry and Gold wait at the apartment building. Gold thanks Henry for bringing Emma to Storybrooke. Henry hopes that, since he forgave Emma, Baelfire will forgive Gold. Gold says that things don't always happen as expected. Henry asks why he doesn't look into the future, and Gold explains that doing so is complicated and the future is like a puzzle. Emma arrives and claims that Baelfire escaped. Unsatisfied, Gold breaks into Neal's apartment over Emma's objections. When Emma discovers that Neal has kept their dreamcatcher, Gold become suspicious of her interest in it and violently demands to know what she is hiding from him. Neal returns and interrupts the fight, explaining that he did not return for Gold's sake, but because he doesn't want Emma to be punished for breaking her deal. He demands that Gold leave, but it soon becomes clear to Gold that his son and Emma know each other. Henry demands to know what is going on, at which Gold figures out the truth; Neal notes Henry's age and Emma must acknowledge that he is their son, and thus that what she previously told Henry about his father was a lie. Henry runs out onto the fire escape, pursued by Emma. Emma admits that Neal represented a part of her life she wanted to forget, and that her reasons for lying were for her own benefit, not Henry's. Henry compares Emma to Regina, because of their lies, and demands to meet his father. In the apartment, Neal agrees to discharge Emma's debt to Gold by letting him talk. Gold invites Neal to Storybrooke, where he can magically change him into a teenager again and raise him properly; Neal rejects the idea as \\"insane.\\" Neal notes that Gold still thinks magic is the solution to every problem. He tells Gold that he can never make up for the trauma he caused; Neal has been haunted by nightmares of his father letting him go, and now he needs to let him go in return. Neal and Emma agree to try to avoid hurting Henry as they did each other. Neal goes to speak to Henry, and they introduce themselves to each other. Gold looks on, unsettled by the knowledge that his own grandson will be his undoing. =In Storybrooke= Regina (Lana Parrilla) is upset that Henry has left town with Emma and Gold, but Cora (Barbara Hershey) reassures her that Henry is safe and will return. Captain Hook/Killian Jones (Colin O'Donoghue) wants to pursue and kill Gold, who is vulnerable without his magic, but Cora instead asks his help in locating the Dark One's dagger, which will enable them to kill Gold in Storybrooke. Regina visits Belle (Emilie de Ravin) in the hospital; upon determining that Belle doesn't remember anything useful, Regina magically renders her unconscious and levitates the contents of her purse, locating a note with a Dewey decimal number. This leads Regina, Cora, and Hook to a map hidden on a bookshelf in the library. Hook deciphers the map, but Cora then attacks him magically and knocks him unconscious, her use for him at an end. She reveals to Regina that her plan is for them to use the dagger to command Gold to kill Mary Margaret, David, and Emma, leaving Regina blameless in Henry's eyes. Greg Mendell (Ethan Embry) tells \\"Her\\" over the phone that he has been released from the hospital but will remain in Storybrooke; he explains by sending her a video of Regina using magic. Production \\"Manhattan\\" was co-written by series co-creators/executive producers Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis and directed by The Shield veteran Dean White. This episode marks a promotion for previously recurring guest star Colin O'Donoghue (Captain Hook) to series regular. Reception=Ratings= This episode posted a 2.4/6 among 18-49s with 7.50 million viewers tuning in, reversing a decline from the last two outings. The episode placed second in its timeslot behind the twenty-second season of The Amazing Race, and placed third for the night, behind The Amazing Race and Family Guy.\\"TV Ratings Sunday: 'Once Upon A Time', 'Revenge' & 'Bob's Burgers' Up, 'The Amazing Race' Premieres Down\\" from TV By The Numbers/Zap2it (February 18, 2013) =Reviews= The episode was received positively by most critics. Entertainment Weekly critic Hilary Busis gave it a good review: \\"'Manhattan' may not have been Once's most gripping episode, but it was one of its deeper installments -- as is generally the case when Rump takes center stage.\\"\\"'Once Upon a Time' recap: Father and Child Reunion\\" from Entertainment Weekly (February 17, 2013) The Huffington Post's Laura Prudom liked the episode: \\"Despite many of us predicting the outcome of the hour, 'Manhattan' proved to be a surprisingly gripping episode of Once Upon a Time, mostly because of the intriguing family dynamics at play. Emma was understandably paranoid that her relationship with Neal was all part of some larger scheme set in motion by Rumpel, while Neal was in no great rush to reunite with his father after Rumpel abandoned him to a land without magic, to grow up lost and alone in our world just as Emma did.\\" She also praised the Seer's part in the episode, saying, \\"[She] was an interesting addition to the mythology, and a welcome reminder to Rumpel that all magic comes with a price, for him just as much as for anyone else. It was a creepy and effective character design, and it will be interesting to see how her prophecy about Henry plays out in the coming weeks.\\"\\"'Once Upon A Time' Recap: A Family Reunion In 'Manhattan'\\" by Laura Prudom, The Huffington Post (February 17, 2013) Amy Ratcliffe of IGN also gave the Seer's appearance a positive review, saying, \\"It was neat to see more pieces of the puzzle come together through the Seer...[but] the worst part of it all is Rumpel could go after Henry now because of the Seer's words. Before this episode I didn't think he'd be willing to go back to such a dark place, but since he's been rejected by Baelfire? It's time to worry about Henry.\\" Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club gave it a C : \\"This show has gotten very good at repeating itself, so anyone who wants to jump right in this week should have no problem because everyone makes it excessively clear how they feel, why they feel that way, and the events that transpired to make them feel that way. That‚Äôs great for catching people up, but when it happens week after week it becomes laborious, especially when the motivations don‚Äôt make very much sense when spoken aloud.\\" He also believe that the scenes featuring Regina were becoming less than impressive: \\"Regina was showing so much promise at the start of this season, but as is usually the case, magic shows up to throw her off course.\\" ReferencesExternal links  2013 American television episodes Once Upon a Time (season 2) episodes ","title":"Manhattan (Once Upon a Time)"},{"id":"38562079","text":"Bickler is a surname.

Where Barnaba walked, snow would melt and flowers would appear. A stone preserved in the church of Santa Maria al Paradiso, in the surroundings of Porta Vigentina, is associated to the legend. Both the stone of the Tredesin de Mars and the flower fair are supposed to be connected to a pre-Christian Celtic spring rite of the Insubres people living in the area.Porta Romana It has been suggested that the stone was originally a Celtic tombstone; the central hole was possibly intended to let the spirit of the dead fly away.

LSM trees, like other search trees, maintain key-value pairs. LSM trees maintain data in two or more separate structures, each of which is optimized for its respective underlying storage medium; data is synchronized between the two structures efficiently, in batches. One simple version of the LSM tree is a two-level LSM tree.O'Neil 1996, p. 4 As described by Patrick O'Neil, a two-level LSM tree comprises two tree-like structures, called C0 and C1. C0 is smaller and entirely resident in memory, whereas C1 is resident on disk. New records are inserted into the memory-resident C0 component. If the insertion causes the C0 component to exceed a certain size threshold, a contiguous segment of entries is removed from C0 and merged into C1 on disk. The performance characteristics of LSM trees stem from the fact that each component is tuned to the characteristics of its underlying storage medium, and that data is efficiently migrated across media in rolling batches, using an algorithm reminiscent of merge sort. Diagram illustrating compaction of data in a log-structured merge tree Most LSM trees used in practice employ multiple levels. Level 0 is kept in main memory, and might be represented using a tree. The on-disk data is organized into sorted runs of data. Each run contains data sorted by the index key. A run can be represented on disk as a single file, or alternatively as a collection of files with non-overlapping key ranges. To perform a query on a particular key to get its associated value, one must search in the Level 0 tree and each run. A particular key may appear in several runs, and what that means for a query depends on the application. Some applications simply want the newest key-value pair with a given key. Some applications must combine the values in some way to get the proper aggregate value to return. For example, in Apache Cassandra, each value represents a row in a database, and different versions of the row may have different sets of columns. In order to keep down the cost of queries, the system must avoid a situation where there are too many runs. Extensions to the 'leveled' method to incorporate B+ tree structures have been suggested, for example bLSMhttp://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~margo/cs165/papers/gp-lsm.pdf and Diff-Index.http://researcher.ibm.com/researcher/files/us-wtan/DiffIndex- EDBT14-CR.pdf LSM trees are used in data stores such as Bigtable, HBase, LevelDB, SQLite4, Tarantool , RocksDB, WiredTiger, Apache Cassandra, InfluxDB and ScyllaDB.

Early career  Born to a humble family (his father, born in 1875, was a Galician fisherman; and his mother, died in 1953, was Sebastiana Navarrete Funes) she started singing from an early age and busked around in Sevilla streets. At the age of 11 she attended Realito Music School to learn singing techniques and did Realito's house chores as a way to pay for her lessons. At the age of 12 she performed for the first time for King Alfonso XIII and Queen Victoria Eugenia at Sevilla Royal Alc√°zares. Ignacio S√°nchez Mej√≠as, a famous Spanish bullfighter, realized Estrellita's vocal and dancing qualities at a charity festival and gave her a gold coin. Estrellita Castro made her debut at Tron√≠o Theatre in Sierpes Street in Seville but she was bound to perform in the main theatres in Spain, Europe, Latin-America and even the USA.  Film career  Her success in Spain attracted the attention of many businessmen and managers who contracted Estrellita. This enabled her to launch her career on an international level as she was successful in the main European cities and some Latin-American countries, where she became a popular idol. Her success as a singer paved her way to the film industry, and she became one of the most popular and highly-paid Spanish actresses of the time. Although she starred in a clip in 1933, she really made her debut in 1935 in Rosario la Cortijera. She starred in 40 movies the most important of which were filmed in Germany- Suspiros de Espa√±a, The Barber of Seville and Mariquilla Terremoto. The charm of her movements in the cinema together with her powerful acute voice and beauty conquered the public. One of the iconic features of her personal looks was a hair-curl on her forehead.  Legacy  Estrellita Castro had her heyday in the 1930s and 1940s and she is considered to be the creator of what is known as Andalusian song or copla, a typical Spanish musical genre. Since she grew up in Seville Flamenco Caf√©s she was quite knowledgeable about flamenco different styles. She added flamenco resources to French couplets and created a new folk fusion-style known as copla. Mi jaca, Suspiros de Espa√±a, La Morena de mi copla, Los Tientos del Reloj, Mar√≠a de la O, Mari Cruz o Mar√≠a Magdalena are some Estrellita's greatest hits. Although she mainly cultivated music of a folk nature, she is hailed as the most prolific and versatile artist of her time. She cultivated many musical styles such as zambras, Cuban boleros and mazurkas. She was also introduced to tangos by the famous Argentinian singer Carlos Gardel. It is also remarkable her value as a flamenco singer, as the styles she cultivates range from serranas, soleares and saetas to guajiras, sevillanas and tanguillos.  Tributes  In the 1960s and 1970s she received many tributes and honors because she was a living myth for the Spanish music and cinema. In 1962 she was awarded with the \\"Medalla al M√©rito en el Trabajo\\" (The Gold Medal for Merit at Work)- symbol of a lifetime devoted to music and work. In 1978 the City Council of Seville agreed to name a street after Estrellita Castro since she contributed to the popularity of her city all over the world. She also got a street named after her in Cordoba and Madrid. She died in 1983, before she arrived to an agreement with Tico Medina to publish her biography. Her dead body remained exhibited at Teatro Lara, where she had been so successful in her heyday. She was buried in Madrid in the Almudena Graveyard, with a hair curl on her forehead and a Spanish mantilla.

Trimmer, a Master Mariner and Seattle harbor pilot. The first edition was self-published from Trimmer's home in Seattle, and carried the subtitle Or: I Never Met a Ship I Liked. It is a maritime operations guidance book, but also attracted some attention due to its title, which some found to be unusual, incongruous, and humorous. Intended for a specialized audience (the captains or operators of small private boats, such as yachts and trawlers), the book gives advice on appropriate avoidance actions when confronted by the near presence of a large ship such as a freighter, along with anecdotes and background information such as the capabilities and operating procedures of the large ships. Bookseller/Diagram Prize and subsequent attention The book won the 1992 Bookseller/Diagram Prize for Oddest Title of the Year and was used to title the first compilation of prize winners, How to Avoid Huge Ships and Other Implausibly Titled Books (2008). The book finished third in The Bookseller's 2008 competition for the oddest book title of all time (behind Greek Rural Postmen and Their Cancellation Numbers and People Who Don't Know They're Dead: How They Attach Themselves to Unsuspecting Bystanders and What to Do About It). Beginning in 2000, the book attracted humorous reader reviews on its Amazon.com entry. The book, its prize-winning status, and sometimes its accompanying constellation of odd reviews, was commented on by publications ranging from Cracked to the New York Times. The New York Daily News called it \\"the best book ever\\" while Publishers Weekly conversely called it \\"the worst book ever\\". Jimmy Fallon covered the book on his \\"Do Not Read List\\" segment of Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, and Alex Horne's first appearance (at the 2000 Edinburgh festival) was with a show titled \\"How To Avoid Huge Ships\\".

The descent of the meteor, visible as a brilliant superbolide in the morning sky, caused a series of shock waves that shattered windows, damaged approximately 7,200 buildings and left 1,500 people injured. The resulting fragments were scattered over a wide area. The largest fragment raised from the bottom of Lake Chebarkul on 16 October 2013 had a mass of and the total mass of other 7 meteorite fragments found nearby was 84.4 kg.  Naming  The meteor and meteorite are named after Chelyabinsk Oblast, over which the meteor exploded. An initial proposal was to name the meteorite after Lake Chebarkul, where one of its major fragments impacted and made a 6-metre-wide hole in the frozen lake surface.  Composition and classification  The meteorite has been classified as an LL5 ordinary chondrite. First estimates of its composition indicate about 10% of meteoric iron, as well as olivine and sulfides.  Asteroid  The impacting asteroid started to brighten up in the general direction of the Pegasus constellation, close to the East horizon where the Sun was starting to rise. The impactor belonged to the Apollo group of near-Earth asteroids. The asteroid had an approximate size of and a mass of about before it entered the denser parts of Earth's atmosphere and started to ablate. NASA's web page in turn acknowledges credit for its data and visual diagrams to: :Peter Brown (University of Western Ontario); William Cooke (Marshall Space Flight Center); Paul Chodas, Steve Chesley and Ron Baalke (JPL); Richard Binzel (MIT); and Dan Adamo. At an altitude of about 23.3 km (14.5 miles) the body exploded in an air burst. Meteorite fragments of the body landed on the ground. Analysis of three fragments using optical microscopy, electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and isotopic composition techniques used to date Solar System objects, showed the isotopic clocks in the asteroids (rubidium and strontium ratios, argon isotope ratios) appear to have partially or totally reset in past collisions. The isotopic clock resets may result from thermal effects changing isotopic ratios, and changes to cosmic radiation exposure. The asteroid appears to have had eight major collisions, around 4.53, 4.45, 3.73, 2.81, and 1.46 billion years ago, then at 852, 312, and 27 million years ago.  Meteorite  Scientists collected 53 samples nearby a 6-metre-wide hole in the ice of Lake Chebarkul, thought to be the result of a single meteorite fragment impact. The specimens are of various sizes, with the largest being , and initial laboratory analysis confirmed their meteoric origin. In June 2013, Russian scientists reported that further investigation by magnetic imaging below the location of the ice hole in Lake Chebarkul has identified a meteorite buried in the mud at the bottom of the lake. An operation to recover it from the lake began on 10 September 2013, and concluded on 16 October 2013, with the raising of the rock with the mass of . It was examined by scientists and handed over to the local authorities, who put it on display at the Chelyabinsk State Museum of Local Lore, causing protests from the followers of the recently established \\"Church of Chelyabinsk Meteorite\\". In the aftermath of the superbolide air burst, a large number of small meteorite fragments fell on areas west of Chelyabinsk, including Deputatskoye, generally at terminal velocity, about the speed of a piece of gravel dropped from a skyscraper. Local residents and schoolchildren located and picked up some of the meteorites, many located in snowdrifts, by following a visible hole that had been left in the outer surface of the snow. Speculators became active in the informal market for meteorite fragments that rapidly emerged.  Popular culture  * , some reports surfaced of people trying to sell fake meteorites on the Internet. * On 15 February (anniversary of the event), during the 2014 Winter Olympics, winners received medals with embedded fragments of the meteorite. * The \\"Church of the Chelyabinsk Meteorite\\" has been set up in the Russian city of Chelyabinsk. The founder of the church, Andrey Breyvichko, claims that the large meteorite fragment retrieved from the lake contains a coded \\"set of moral and legal norms that will help people live at a new stage of spiritual knowledge development\\". Breyvichko opposes the operation to expose the meteorite fragment in a museum, claiming that only \\"psychic priests\\" of his church are qualified to decode and handle the celestial body, which they want to be placed in a temple to be built in Chelyabinsk for the purpose.

He focused primarily on exhibition design, photography and photojournalism. Life He was born on 12 November 1965 in Bensberg in West Germany. He died on 3 October 2020 of esophageal cancer in Berlin. Work biography Initially, he was interested in travel photography; but an assignment by Associated Press to cover the Yugoslavian War drove him to war genre. He saw it as an opportunity to travel and to check his possible reactions in extreme situations, so he seized it: his career on conflict zones had started. Thielker¬¥s most famous work is a photograph of Rwandan refugees carrying water back to a camp in Tanzania that won him a Pulitzer Prize in 1995. At that time, he reported the Hutus and Tutsis overwhelming civil war together with Jaqueline Artz, Javier Bauluz and Jean- Marc Bouju. His works have been exhibited in various European countries, in Mexico and in Nigeria and he has also conducted workshops for the Goethe Institute in Laos, Nigeria, and Guadalajara, M√©xico. Thielker worked for the from 1981 to 1990, and for the Associated Press from 1990 to 1996 and as a freelance photographer from Berlin since 1997. He is known to be one of those photo journalists who have worked surrounded by confrontations with death, ethical issues and the consequences they witness when they report from conflict zones. Thielker also performed consultancy for the daily newspaper Tageszeitung and for Internet Image Database (www.piaxa.com). Awards *1995: Pulitzer Prize. *2002: Platz R√ºckblende.

Synonymous to PPE technique for thermal characterization of materials, PTE can be used to thermally characterize both thermoelectrics (acts as sensor and sample) and other sample materials (while acting as a sensor). An advantage of such sensors stems from their wide temperature range of applicability since pyromaterials are limited to its curie temperature. On the other hand, in order to obtain a useful signal from TE material, depends on its Seebeck coefficient, comparatively large amount of heat (light excitation) has to be deposited on the material.

It was released in September 1981 through iconic Manchester record label Factory with the catalogue number FACT 45. The album was produced by Martin Hannett, best known for producing both of Joy Division's studio albums. Joy Division front man Ian Curtis has been credited as co-producing the record, in parts produced before his death in May 1980. Recording took place in February 1981 at Britannia Row Studios in Islington, London, owned by Pink Floyd. A version of Dirty Disco with French lyrics was released as a single on Factory Benelux. The short, improvised instrumental C.P. was a musical collaboration (‚Äòcollective project‚Äô) between the band and Hannett. Two tracks recorded and finished at Britannia Row (Human Puppets and One True Path), were not included on the original vinyl album. English dance rock band Friendly Fires later took their name from the opening track. While recording the album Section 25 supported New Order at London nightclub Heaven on 9 February 1981. Hannett mixed the live sound for both bands, using quadraphonic equipment rented from Britannia Row. The album was reissued on CD in 1991 through LTM Recordings with several bonus tracks. An expanded double CD edition on Factory Benelux in 2015 re- mastered from the original analogue tapes, and added a bonus disc featuring their 1981 John Peel radio session as well as a complete live concert from 1980. The packaging replicated the original wraparound cover designed by Saville. Recording \\"We recorded and mixed in ten days,\\" recalled singer and bassist Larry Cassidy. \\"We went in with about six or seven finished numbers, while others were more improvised. C.P. was made up on the spot. I was playing a cheap bass in an expensive studio.\\" The group were then a trio composed of Larry, younger sibling Vin Cassidy on drums, and guitarist Paul Wiggin. Musically the album combined austere post-punk rhythms with abstract and/or abrasive guitar textures, together with elements of Can, krautrock and psychedelia. Packaging The album was packaged in a lavish sleeve devised by Factory design director Peter Saville (credited as Grafica Industria). \\"I did get a fascinating brief from Larry,\\" Saville told author James Nice in Factory history Shadowplayers. \\"I seem to remember he wanted something quite European, but psychedelic ‚Äì and with some Oriental influences. After that, I was on my own.\\" The exterior sleeve featured black Berthold type on a yellow background, printed on heavy card die-cut to form a pochette envelope, and sealed with a small red I Ching sticker. The psychedelic element was concealed within, the lining and separate inner sleeve featuring a rich marbled pattern in dark blue, yellow and red supplied by specialist French paper company Keller-Dorian. Some copies of FACT 45 also included a home-made poster, printed cheaply by the group and featuring lyrics and photos. Reception The first edition of Always Now went on to sell 5,000 copies and entered the indie Top Ten, although the cost and complexity of the packaging made it problematic to license abroad. On release in September 1981 the album was reviewed in scathing terms by NME, who drew comparisons with Factory labelmates Joy Division. Dutch magazine Vinyl also expressed reservations, observing that early Section 25 \\"always had something paper-thin about it - a sound, or rather an absence of sound, giving the impression that the slightest breeze would blow it away.\\" However, in 2006 Q described Always Now as \\"one of the best albums Britain's second city has unleashed\\", while avant garde magazine The Wire also praised \\"the wind-dried skeins of their blasted guitar harmonics and skimped electronics.\\" In February 2016 album track \\"Hit\\" was sampled by Kanye West on a new song, \\"FML\\", featured on his seventh studio album, The Life of Pablo.

The Distillery  Destiler√≠a Car√∫pano's historic tradition dates back to 1762 when the Hacienda Altamira-Car√∫pano in Macarapana is established by the Spanish captain Felix del Fierro, and that is where, for the first time in Venezuela, what is now called Ron A√±ejo was produced. In 1954 the Morrison family bought the bicentenary Hacienda Altamira, abandoned since 1901, after the death of Thomas Massiani, one of the owners who strived to give the property the highest prestige and growth it had seen since 1840. The original intent of the new owners, taking into account the water wealth of the estate and its successful tradition of producing quality rums, was to re-establish its sugarcane milling capacity and the distillation and aging of rums; for this purpose, they join forces with Alejandro Hernandez, owner of Industrias Pampero, and sharing equal ownership, create Destiler√≠a Car√∫pano, CA, a relationship that lasted until 1962. Destiler√≠a Car√∫pano remains a family business and has, thus far, been administered by four generations of that same family. Its equity is fully distributed among Venezuelan corporations. In 2010, the Destiler√≠a Car√∫pano Family Manifesto was prepared, as a basic agreement of compelling nature signed by the company shareholders, which seeks to reflect the guidelines in family relationships with the company and vice versa, to stabilize, harmonize and strengthen family relationships through understanding, maintaining and defining the core values, policies and commitments within the family itself and, at the same time, achieving the common good of the family, ensuring the continued and healthy development of Destiler√≠a Car√∫pano. This family Manifesto consolidates the commitment to absolute transparency in the operations of the company and the willingness to gradually delegate its daily management to non-family professionals. Why are the rums from Destiler√≠a Carupano the best? 1\\\\. Because there is a direct relationship between the quality of alcohol and sugar containing molasses in the cane; a higher content of sugar means higher quality of alcohol. Sugar levels of Venezuelan honeys are among the highest in the world, ranging from 50% to 56% in concentration. This is mainly due to the Venezuelan climate with high daytime temperatures of 28 to 32 degrees Celsius with falls of up to 10 degrees overnight. 2\\\\. Because we carry a perfect balance and combination between light and heavy alcohols. The light ones are generally those that come from distillation columns and are low in congeners (impurities some of which are favored for giving the desired sensory profiles). The heavy are generally those that come from the distillation in an alembic or pot and have a high content of congeners. This balance allows for an optimum aging time, because light alcohol does not require much maturing time and prolonging it would not improve its quality; heavy alcohol will need to stay longer in the barrel, since, if not given enough time, its quality will suffer, it will fail to develop properly and will not manage to completely transform its raw notes into more subtle, soft, rounded and pleasant textures. 3\\\\. Because Destiler√≠a Car√∫pano is located at the Hacienda Altamira in the Macarapana-Car√∫pano valley toward the equator and, since this is an area of low altitude at sea level where a distinct micro-climate develops combining high relative humidity from Caribbean sea breezes and high temperatures, hence, the time required for aging is much shorter. 4\\\\. Because at Destiler√≠a Carupano the aging process is accelerated and optimized when the chemical reactions that occur in the body of the alcohol diluted with water and aging inside the barrel are catalyzed by temperature. For every 10 degrees Celsius temperature rise in the liquid inside the barrel, the reaction rates are doubled and thus, the lower the latitude and height, as is the case of Hacienda Altamira where Destiler√≠a Car√∫pano is located, the more intense the aging process. 5\\\\. Because in practical terms and if we compare, for example, the whiskey produced in Scotland, a country with a high latitude and cold weather with the rum produced in Destiler√≠a Car√∫pano at a latitude close to zero, at sea level with high temperatures and much humidity, the intensity in the aging process ratio is four times higher in Car√∫pano than in Scotland, and therefore we can conclude that a good 12 year scotch equates to a good 3 to 4 year rum from Car√∫pano. 6\\\\. Because the water used by Destiler√≠a Car√∫pano to make the rum comes either from a spring or a deep well, which implies greater purity free from undesirable odors or flavors. 7\\\\. Because at Destiler√≠a Car√∫pano the barrels used for the aging process are of white oak and this wood, in addition to its hardiness that makes it suitable for this task, consists mainly of cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin, which means it is a wood with a low sap content, so it does not hinder the sensory notes desired for the final product. But in addition, our American white oak barrels have had a previous use with Bourbon, which gives the rums of Car√∫pano woody notes and hints of vanilla. 8\\\\. Because in Destiler√≠a Car√∫pano we have purposely maintained traditions since 1762 producing the best and most famous Old Rum from Venezuela; their manufacture requires, at the same time, a delicate and careful treatment from the genuine art and craft of a qualified distiller, together with the best technique of a good distillation. We are committed to balance the 50 years experience of our artisan rum blender with the knowledge of the most recent sensorial analysis techniques from Destiler√≠a's Car√∫pano rum master blender. They are a fundamental link in the success of the whole process. We are also very focused on insuring an equilibrium when blending aged rums, matured at length in barrels of American white oak without replacement of angel's share, with our Limited Reserves of up to 25 years of aging. Thus, we uphold the undeniable truth in saying: \\"cane alcohol, water, wood, our masters blenders and time makes Car√∫pano‚Äôs Rum.\\" 9\\\\. Because some Car√∫pano old rums have been double aged. After mixing old rums with fresher ones, both with lengthy aging, sealed in white American oak barrels, without replacement of losses and Reserve Mothers aged for a long time, they are resealed, to start a new process of aging that will improve the flavor and make our rums even smoother and creamier with a more constant and prolonged finish. 10\\\\. Because Destiler√≠a Car√∫pano's aged rums have earned the Denomination of Controlled Origin for Venezuela Rum DOC due to its outstanding quality.  Aged Rums  The distillery is well known for its selection of aged rums or otherwise known as Ron A√±ejo Car√∫pano Legendario, some may reach up to 80 years of aging and retail for up to $1000 US dollars.

She is also known as \\"Mother Lupita\\". At one time, she was engaged to be married but she decided her religious call was too strong for that and she broke off her engagement in order to pursue this call. She dedicated herself to the care of ill people and was noted for her compassion and faith. Her beatification cause began in mid-1984 and her formal beatification was celebrated on 25 April 2004. Pope Francis later canonized her as a saint on 12 May 2013 in Saint Peter's Square. Life Anastasia Guadalupe Garc√≠a Zavala was born in 1878 in Zapopan to Fortino Garc√≠a and Refugio Zavala de Garc√≠a; her father was a religious store merchant and his shop was located in front of the basilica to which she made frequent visits to. Her baptism was celebrated in the parish of Saint Peter the Apostle. Those who knew her best as a child saw her as nice and likeable as well as an altruistic person who was willing to lend a hand to those who needed help the most. Her First Communion was on 8 September 1887 at the Zapopan basilica. Zavala had planned to wed Gustavo Arreola (marriage was a strong desire for her) but she broke off their engagement in 1901 because she felt a call to the religious life and believed that she was called to give assistance to the poor and the sick. Zavala and her spiritual director (and future Servant of God) Cipriano I√±iguez Mart√≠n del Campo both co-founded a new religious order on 13 October 1901 titled as the Handmaids of Santa Margherita Maria and the Poor. Zavala described her call to the religious life as a \\"sudden change of heart\\" that she knew she had to follow. Zavala worked as a nurse and regardless of the poorness and the lack of material goods of the patients she was compassionate and caring towards the needs of the ill. Zavala was named as the Superior General for the new order. In times of dire need she asked her spiritual director for permission to go begging in the streets in order to collect funds needed for the hospital. Zavala did this with her fellow religious and she would seek offerings until the needs of the hospital and patients were met and would ask for no more than was needed. The Mexican Revolution started in 1911 and its effects lasted up until 1936 during which the political-religious situation in Mexico became tense in which the faith underwent severe persecution. Zavala put her own life at risk and hid the priests and the Archbishop of Guadalajara in her hospital; it was the archdiocese who granted diocesan approval to the order on 24 May 1935. Zavala began to suffer from a severe illness since 1961 and she died from this on 24 June 1963 in Guadalajara. Her order now operates in nations such as Iceland and Peru. In 2005 there were 147 religious in 24 houses though this declined in 2015 with 112 women in 22 houses. Sainthood The beatification process began in a diocesan process that opened in the Guadalajara archdiocese from 29 June 1984 until its closure on 11 June 1986; the Congregation for the Causes of Saints validated the cause on 15 March 1991 in Rome while receiving the Positio from postulation officials in 1992. The theological experts first approved the cause on 7 January 2000 while the C.C.S. did so as well on 21 March 2000 while the confirmation of her heroic virtue led Pope John Paul II to name her as Venerable on 1 July 2000. The miracle for her beatification - a healing science could not explain - was investigated on a diocesan level and received C.C.S. validation on 11 January 2002 while a panel of medical experts on 13 March 2003; theologians likewise approved this on 17 June 2003 as did the C.C.S. on 11 November 2003. John Paul II approved this miracle on 20 December 2003 and beatified her in Saint Peter's Square on 25 April 2004. The second miracle was investigated and it received C.C.S. validation on 14 May 2010 prior to the approval of a medical board on 15 December 2011; theologians voiced their assent to this on 26 May 2012 as did the C.C.S. on 2 October 2012.

It is best known for its monthly distribution of thousands of family food packages, baby formula and baby food packages. It also provides a range of financial and rehabilitative support services, including the mentoring of boys from single-parent families and free or low- cost weddings at its wedding complex in Givat Shaul, Jerusalem. Founded as a small, neighborhood chesed organization, it is now one of the largest poverty- relief organizations in Israel, with over 12,000 volunteers. Led by Orthodox Jewish management, it provides services for both religious and secular families in Israel. (subscription) History Yad Eliezer was founded in 1980 by Rabbi Yaakov and Hadassah Weisel, both elementary schoolteachers, and named in memory of her father, Rabbi Eliezer Lipa Benzman.Weisman, Shalvi. \\"Cultivated with Emunah: A conversation with the founder of Yad Eliezer\\". Binah, January 14, 2013, pp. 30-34, 45. The seeds of the organization were planted when Hadassah, a resident of Jerusalem's Kiryat Sanz neighborhood, found out that her neighbor's family was suffering from malnutrition, and sent her daughters door to door to collect food for them every week. As word got around, other families requested the same assistance, and she was soon sending all her daughters' classmates out to collect food, then filling colorful plastic shopping baskets for the weekly delivery. Other classes and other schools got involved, and Weisel's two-and-a-half room apartment became the collection point and packing area for monthly food boxes for 360 needy families - a figure that mushroomed to 1,800 needy families by 1995. After operating Yad Eliezer out of her apartment for 20 years, Weisel began soliciting overseas donations through the newly formed American Friends of Yad Eliezer to further expand the operation. Yad Eliezer is now headquartered in the Shmuel HaNavi neighborhood of Jerusalem under the directorship of the Weisels' son, Dov. Food collection and distribution Yad Eliezer provides monthly food packages, comprising basic necessities such as \\"eggs, oil, flour, sugar, and canned goods\\" and fresh produce to 6,000 families throughout Israel. It also distributes hundreds of Shabbat food packages consisting of \\"challah, fish, salads, chicken, and cake\\" to needy families and poor elderly, (subscription) and holiday food packages in advance of Passover and Rosh Hashana. In response to government welfare budget cuts, Yad Eliezer distributed 9,000 Passover food packages in 2004, up 5,000 from the previous year. (subscription) Approximately 50 percent of the food distributed by Yad Eliezer is purchased wholesale with donations from overseas donors. Thirty- five percent of the food is gathered from Israeli farmers' surplus, amounting to $3 million worth of fruits and vegetables annually. Yad Eliezer also receives produce through the maaser ani (, lit. \\"poor tithe\\"), the 10-percent tithe of Israeli farm produce separated by Orthodox farmers in the third and sixth year of the sabbatical year agricultural cycle for the benefit of poor people. The remaining 15 percent of food is obtained through door-to-door collections of non-perishable food by girls in primarily religious neighborhoods. These girls volunteer under the supervision of local coordinators, who send the donated food items to Yad Eliezer's warehouse. Regular and drop-in volunteers - including students, soldiers, and visitors from abroad - help in the warehouse, sorting food by category and boxing the monthly distribution. Baby food Yad Eliezer provides baby food packages to 2,000 infants monthly. This includes monthly supplies of Materna baby formula for 1,400 infants. Weddings Haredi wedding at the Armonot Wolf wedding halls. Shortly after Weisel began collecting food for poor families, she heard about a bride who could not afford to make her own wedding. Weisel and her daughters offered to do the cooking and set up the wedding in a local synagogue. This operation expanded into catering three or four weddings per week and the hiring of impoverished waiters and waitresses who were invited to take home the leftover food. In 2000, Yad Eliezer acquired an industrial kitchen and began promoting the idea of \\"dancing at two weddings\\" to Americans who were marrying off their own children: for a donation of $1,000 they could sponsor a needy couple's wedding the same night in Israel. In 2005 Yad Eliezer purchased the Armonot Wolf wedding complex on Beit Hadfus Street in Givat Shaul, Jerusalem for $4 million. The complex's two wedding halls host both weddings for needy couples and discounted weddings for religious families from the general Orthodox community in Jerusalem. Yad Eliezer volunteers also cater discounted meals for four other Jerusalem wedding halls. The organization pays all or part of the expenses for 400 weddings for needy couples annually. Mentoring program Yad Eliezer's mentoring program for boys from single- parent homes began in 2000 with 400 boys. As of 2013, 4,000 boys are enrolled in the program. Pairing up mentors with orphans, children of divorced parents, and children who have a seriously ill parent or sibling, the program operates in 35 cities. Other services Yad Eliezer also operates an orphans fund, an emergency grants fund, distribution centers for second-hand furniture and appliances, a visitation program for families coping with illness, a shoe distribution program, and a job-training program.

Levine House is an eclectic building with some neoclassical influences, which is unique in central Tel Aviv. The building was designed in 1924 by architect Yehuda Magidovitch for a wealthy customer, Zvi Yaacov Levine and his family, and is inspired by the late 19th century Italian vacation homes, a distinctive pointy-roofed tower. One of the more striking elements of the building is its pointy-roofed tower. During the building's rehabilitation, the crew discovered that the three parts of the tower could be opened by using a special mechanism, and create an opening over the staircase. The mechanism enabled furniture to be moved into the building. It may also have been used by the religiously observant Levine family to create a succah during the Feast of the Tabernacles. History The house was originally built for the Levine family. It later had several owners throughout the years and after the establishment of the State of Israel, housed the USSR Embassy, being known during those years as the Russian Embassy House. On the evening of February 9, 1953, the house was damaged by a bomb placed by three former Lehi activists. The event was used by the Soviet Union as an excuse for stopping diplomatic relations with Israel, claiming that the operation was backed by the Israeli government. Diplomatic relations were only renewed after Stalin's death in July 1953 (only to be discontinued again in 1967 after the Six-Day War and resumed by December 1991, as a result of Mikhail Gorbachev's Perestroika reform.) Since the 1990s After years of neglect, the building went through rehabilitation by architects Amnon Bar Or and Moti Bodek, along with engineer Shmaya Ben Avraham. The conservation was done alongside the construction on the adjacent Alrov Tower (built 1995-99), designed by architects Avraham Yaski and Yosi Sivan. This special construction project, which combines a historic reconstruction with an adjacent skyscraper, has encouraged similar projects nearby. Throughout the 1990s and until 2006, the building housed the offices and showrooms of Sotheby‚Äôs Auction House, and was renamed Sotheby's House. In 2006, the house was sold for over 35 million shekels to Gerry Schwartz and Heather Reisman and it is now called Heseg House after the Heseg foundation established by the couple. The house was donated to the philanthropic fund, and after another restoration is used for philanthropic activities, primarily by Heseg ‚Äì a scholarship fund for former soldiers.

It is located in Thurston County and the nearest city is Olympia, the state capital. Henderson Inlet was named in 1841 by Charles Wilkes, commander of the United States Exploring Expedition, after James Henderson, who served as quartermaster. A variant name is \\"South Bay\\". History The shores of Henderson Inlet were once inhabited by the Nisqually people, of whom one branch, the Noosehchatle, had a settlement named Tuts'e'tcaxt in the Woodard Bay area, on the western shore of the inlet. Tuts'e'tcaxt comprised two cedar plank houses measuring 30 by 100 feet, inhabited by about a dozen natives who lived there during the inclement winter months, according to an 1854 report by George Gibbs, an agent of the territorial governor. Archaeologists suspect the presence of many tribal burials along both shores of the inlet, where evidence of native use exists in the form of numerous shell middens. The first British garrison in the area, the fur trading post of Fort Nisqually (now part of DuPont), was established by the Hudson's Bay Company in 1833, some 10 miles east of Henderson Inlet. American settlers arrived shortly thereafter, and in 1846, under the terms of the Oregon Treaty, the area became part of the United States of America. In 1854 a millwright named Harvey Rice Woodard made a claim to the land around the bay that still bears his name, Woodard Bay, which soon became the location of a thriving logging industry that survived, though much diminished in its final years, until 1984. In 1940 the 15th Infantry Regiment, United States Army, which had been based at Fort Lewis, near Tacoma, since 1938, set up an Amphibious Training Camp on Henderson Inlet, north of Woodard Bay, with a pier, administrative buildings, barracks, and mess hall. The regiment operated this facility until 1942.15th Regiment, United States Army - HistoryLink.org Since 1987 a large section of the western shore of Henderson Inlet has been managed by the Woodard Bay Natural Resources Conservation Area, including the former property of the Weyerhaeuser Timber Company and, to its north, part of the historic Esterly Farm and its associated woodland, which according to local folklore, possibly deriving from native legends, is populated by elves. The conservation area, now covering 600 acres, has expanded in stages by purchasing surrounding properties as they became available, and has developed into an important sanctuary for birds, bats, seals and otters.

The secularism principle was removed from the constitution in 1977 by Ziaur Rahman, replaced with a statement of \\"absolute trust and faith in Almighty Allah\\", and Islam was declared the state religion in 1988. In 2010, the Bangladesh Supreme Court restored secularism but stated Islam remained the state religion. Over 88.23% of Bangladeshis are Muslims, the rest being Hindus 10.7%, Buddhists 0.6%, Christians 0.37%, and others 0.11%. People in Bangladesh observe various secular festivals at different times throughout the year. The ethos of secularism in South Asia is in many ways different from that of Western versions that assert complete separation of church and state. Rather, it is the freedom of individuals to practice the faith he or she desires without being subject to any form of state or communal discrimination. Secularism in the Constitution Secularism was one of the four fundamental principles that had been induced into the original Constitution of Bangladesh in 1972. The secularism principle was removed from the constitution in 1977 by the 5th amendment of the constitution by Ziaur Rahman and also declared Islam as the state religion in 1988 by Muhammad Ershad. In 2010, Bangladesh Supreme Court declared the 5th amendment illegal and restored secularism as one of the basic tenets of the Constitution though Islam remained the state religion in the constitution. At present The Constitution of Bangladesh declares Secularism as one of the four fundamental principle of the state policy in Article-8 of Part-IIPart II, Article: 8, The Constitution of Bangladesh and also declares Islam as the state religion in Article-2A of Part-I.Part II, Article: 2A, The Constitution of Bangladesh In Article 12 of Part -II of the constitution which was restored by the 15th amendment states ‚Äì The principle of secularism shall be realised by the elimination of - # Communalism in all forms; # the granting by the state of political status in favour of any religion; # the abuse of religion for political purposes; # any discrimination against, or persecution of, persons practising a particular religion.\\"Part II, Article: 12, The Constitution of Bangladesh Impact of constitutional changes The removal of secularism from the constitution has been described by the country's largely secular establishment as a betrayal of Bengali nationalism and also opposed to mainstream Bengali culture and society, both of which are seen as remarkably pluralist and progressive. However, the Bangladesh Army with its close ideological association of centre-right and conservative political parties led by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, have stated that the term Bangladeshi nationalism refers to the country as an Islamic nation given that 89% of the population is Muslim. In 2008, the newly elected Awami League government announced that it would re-introduce the original Four State Principles into the Preamble of the Constitution of Bangladesh. Although recognised by the United Nations as a \\"moderate Muslim democracy\\", Bangladesh's foreign minister Dipu Moni stated that the country is, in her words, \\"a secular, not moderate Muslim, country\\".  History  Pohela Baishakh, a secular festival being celebrated in Dhaka Despite the country ceasing to be a secular state constitutionally once, secularism came back in 2010 and has been practised in the region of Bengal since ancient times. Ancient and medieval rulers, especially the Pala Empire and Nawabs of Bengal practised secularism in making decisions of the court. Hindus and Muslims would have prominent leaders from each community assisting the rulers. When the British East India Company came in the 18th century, it instituted separate laws for Hindus, Muslims and Christians. In doing so they laid the foundation for a civil code which remains largely unchanged to date. Bangladeshi artists performing a traditional dance. Bengali culture is seen as fiercely secular. However, the British had perpetuated division amongst Bengali communities on the basis of divide and rule. Bengali Hindus were seen as affluent, educated and were accepted in civil services. On the other hand, Bengali Muslims, especially those in East Bengal were highly discriminated. Most East Bengali Muslims were peasants and were persecuted by Hindu zamindars supported by the British Raj. This had led to several religious movements across East Bengal such as the Faraizi movement aimed at resisting the British and the Hindu zamindars class. In 1905, Nawab Sir Khwaja Salimullah, the Nawab of Dhaka, proposed the partition of Bengal on communal lines to establish a separate province for the suppressed majority of the region who live in East Bengal and were mostly Muslim. The British accepted the partition and a new province by the name of Eastern Bengal and Assam was created. However the partition was annulled in 1911 due to resistance from the Swadeshi movement in West Bengal that demanded the unification of Bengal. In 1947, Bengal would again be partitioned on communal lines with East Bengal (present day Bangladesh) joining Pakistan and West Bengal being part of India though Hindu majority district of Khulna was awarded to Pakistan and Muslim majority districts of Malda and Murshidabad were awarded to West Bengal. Ethnic cleansing of Hindus forced many Hindus to migrate to India notably on the backdrop of 1950 East Pakistan riots and 1964 East Pakistan riots. After the establishment of Pakistan, Bengalis faced immense discrimination and economic suffering. The Bengali nationalist movement quickly geared momentum with the increasing cultural and linguistic nationalism that were inherently secular. The Bangladesh Liberation War would see Bengalis, irrespective of religion join the fight for their freedom. Baitul Mukarram (Dhaka) the National Mosque Bangladesh. The structure resembles the Kaaba in Mecca After achieving victory, Bangladesh's constitution, drafted in 1972, stated Four State Principles as the character of the new state. They would be Nationalism, Democracy, Secularism and Socialism. In 1975, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the country's founding father was assassinated by junior officers in the military and martial law was declared. Mostaq Ahmed would eventually be removed by counter coups in the volatile situation and army chief and liberation war hero Lt. Gen Ziaur Rahman (known as Zia) would take over as president. After Zia assumed the presidency, he allied himself with his one-time enemies during the liberation war, including anti-liberation leaders such as Shah Azizur Rahman, Abdus Sabur Khan and Kazi Abdul Kader. The decision to ally with anti-liberation leaders was seen as necessary political strategy to counter the Awami League of the assassinated Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Although Zia was popular for bringing stability after the volatility after 1975, he began using religion as a major factor in politics. He formed the Bangladesh Nationalist Party that professed the more Islamic \\"Bangladeshi nationalism\\" to replace the secular Bengali nationalism. The Bangladesh parliament in 1977 amended the constitution by changing the Four State Principles. The amendment caused the term \\"secularism\\" in the Permeable to be replaced with \\"Absolutue trust and faith in the Almighty Allah shall be the basis of all actions\\", and removed references to freedom of religion. Finally in 1988, the country's second military ruler Hussain Muhammad Ershad declared Islam as the state religion in Bangladesh. This would be the final blow to constitutional secularism in the country. Supporters of the BNP and the military would engage in various anti minority activities particularly against the Hindu and tribal communities of the country, most notably the anti-Hindu pogroms of 1988, 1990, 1992 and 2013 which caused widespread damage and devastation across the country. However, after the return to democracy in 1991, there have been growing calls by the country's \\"pro liberation forces\\", the largely secular civil society and freedom fighters, as well as from the young generation to re introduce secularism back into the constitution. In 2009, the Awami League government announced that it would amend the constitution and reintroduce the original Four State Principles. =Restoration by Supreme Court= The Fifth Amendment of the constitution was declared illegal by the High Court of Bangladesh in 2005, the government restored a constitution \\"in the spirit of the constitution of 1972\\" which also included secularism as one of the state principles. Nevertheless, the opening words 'bismillah-ar-rahman-ar rahim' (In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful), that were added in 1997, remained in the constitution. In 2010, the Supreme Court of Bangladesh upheld the 2005 High Court ruling that the Fifth Amendment to the constitution was illegal. The prime minister Sheik Hasina stated that she favours allowing religion-based political parties. = Petition in High court = After the Eighth Amendment of the constitution on 7 June 1988, 15 personalities had filed a public interest litigation challenging the provision of state religion. On 1 August 2015, a Supreme Court lawyer named Samendra Nath Goswami filed another petition with the High Court challenging the legality of the constitutional provision of Islam as the state religion despite revival of \\"secularism\\" as a fundamental state policy under a 2011 amendment to the Constitution. On 28 March 2016, the high court rejected the petition and retained Islam as the state religion.

A cuberdon is a cone-shaped Belgian candy. In Dutch it is also known as a neus (nose), Gentse neus (Ghent nose), or neuzeke (little nose) for its likeness to a human nose. In French, cuberdons are also called chapeau-de-cur√© and chapeau-de-pr√™tre (priest's hat). Cuberdons are made with gum arabic candy crust with a soft, traditionally raspberry-flavored inside filling. Their color is purple, though more recently differently colored and flavoured variants have been available as well. They are traditionally about 2.5 cm wide and weigh approximately 10 to 18 grams, although smaller versions are also commercialized. The outside is relatively hard, whereas the inside is gelatinous. Cuberdons can only be preserved for about three weeks, after which period the inside begins to crystallize. This limited preservability is the reason why cuberdons are infrequently exported outside Belgium. There are two hypotheses about its origins: * Either a clergy member living in the city of Bruges created it - which would explain the term of \\"cleric's cap\\", another name for it. * Or in 1873, pharmacist De Vynck in the city of Ghent discovered the recipe of the cuberdon by chance. In order to increase the shelf life of drugs at the time, many were packaged in the form of syrup. When the pharmacist examined a failed preparation after a few days, he found that it had formed a crust, while the core was still liquid. From this discovery came the idea to use such a technique to manufacture candy. The (VLAM), an agency of the Flemish Government, has recognized the cuberdon as an official regional product. In recent years, various derivative food products have been made, including cuberdon-flavored jenever, ice cream, dessert sauce, and cookies. Cuberdons are a popular local delicacy in Ghent.

On 17 March 1977 Diana Bracco, Fulvio‚Äôs daughter, was appointed Bracco General Manager. In 1981 the company launched Iopamidol in Italy and Germany, a product with outstanding tolerability, whose stability allowed it to be stored in phials for unlimited periods of time. In the second half of the 1980s, Bracco Spa became the leading international producer of non-ionic contrast agents. It also won a positive response and important results for other formulations, including the anti-tuberculosis drug pyrazinamide, of which Bracco is the leading world producer, which is included in the WHO list of essential pharmaceuticals.

Dating back to Roman times, in the late 19th the district had become a place of ill repute, brothels and open-air outhouses.Paolo Valera, Milano sconosciuta rinnovata, pages 113-117. It was demolished between the 1930s and 1960s and replaced with the current business district of Via Larga and Piazza Diaz. History The district developed around a postern in the Roman Walls of Milan. While the origin of the name is uncertain, scholars suggest that it may be from the word \\"bottino\\", which, in hydraulics, refers to a drainage pit; in fact, a complex of sewerage and drainage structures were built in the area in the 1st Century.Bottonuto Over the centuries, the district evolved from a mostly military area (in late Roman times) to a popular neighborhood, which in the 18th Century featured a wine market. The area experienced decay and decline towards the 19th Century, and as of the early 20th Century it was described as dirty, devious place of prostitution and crime. This contrasted with the wealthy surroundings, and caused the growing indignation of the population of such surroundings. The district was partly demolished in the 1930s, purportedly for sanitary and decency reason; in practice, the demolition was also probably motivated by real estate business purposes, as the whole area consequently experienced a dramatic increase in value.Bottonuto Bombings in World War II also affected what remained of the original Bottonuto.

He was also the first Igbo to be ordained a priest in 1930 and the first bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Enugu which was created in 1963, the year of his installation. Through his efforts Enugu became a very important Catholic mission centre overseeing several thousand Christians in and around the town. His parish has the largest concentration of Catholics in Nigeria, second only to Owerri parish. Biography He was born on 11 March 1898 in Onitsha, near an early missions settlement on the bank of the River Niger some 96 kilometres from Enugu. His parents, Jacob and Ama Fatima Anyogu, were prominent worshippers at the Onitsha mission where their contribution to its growth, both as a base for European missionaries arriving in Nigeria as well as a training ground for prospective priests, was well known. Their offspring John was not slow in noticing this dedication for by 1912, when he was only 14 he too had resolved to serve God. \\"As my new year's resolution,\\" he wrote to his father on 1 January 1912, \\"I want to serve God all my life. I want to be a priest.\\" His father took the matter up with the European priests at the mission asking whether an African could become a priest. The positive response led to John and his brother Luke being sent to England in March 1913 for training. John had attended the Holy Trinity School, Onitsha for his elementary education. In 1912 he passed what was then Standard VI as well as the Junior Civil Entrance Examinations, which showed his exemplary brilliance. In Britain he studied at the Junior Seminary of St. Mary's in Grange-over-Sands in the industrial Lancashire belt. Five years later, he went to Ireland to read philosophy in Dublin and graduated with distinction. He returned to Nigeria in 1919 to continue his studies for the priesthood at Onitsha; he was among the first crop of priests to graduate from the Igbariam Seminary. In addition to his studies there John Anyogu taught Latin to junior seminarians, using his own quarters as a makeshift classroom. Also during this period, in 1922, he was sent to Ogoja, some 320 kilometres from Onitsha‚Äîa distance he did on foot to spread the gospel. Then on 8 December 1930 he was ordained at Onitsha by Bishop Shanahan, at the age of 32, becoming the first priest from Eastern Nigeria. Father Anyogu was first assigned to the Adazi parish as a curate. He served there for five years before being relocated to take charge of Nnewi parish. In 1940 he went to Idah, a town in the southern part of northern Nigeria, from whence he was posted to Oguta in 1948. The following year Anyogu was transferred to Nteje where, in addition to other mission duties, he taught the Igbo language to Irish priests. In 1956 he was honoured by the British queen, Elizabeth II, with the Order of the British Empire (OBE). A year later, on 9 June 1957, Father Anyogu was consecrated bishop. Subsequently, he was installed bishop of Enugu on 15 January 1963, the first bishop of the new diocese. Before his death on 5 July 1967, the diocese of Enugu had become an important Catholic centre, not only for the eastern region for which it was the administrative headquarters, but also for Nigeria as a whole.

On 15 September 2015 the 29-year-old moved abroad for the first time in his career, joining Indian Super League team Mumbai City FC. On returning from Asia, Aitor signed in May 2016 for Real Avil√©s CF of his home region ahead of their participation in the Tercera Divisi√≥n play-offs. Following their elimination, he moved on to FC Zirka Kropyvnytskyi of the Ukrainian First League. At the end of the January 2017 transfer window, Aitor returned to Spain and joined Extremadura UD, struggling in the third tier. He played regularly in his first full season, as the club won promotion to the second division for the first time in its history. On 28 August 2019, Aitor signed for Cultural y Deportiva Leonesa in the third division after terminating his contract.

Hirst George Keble Hirst, M.D. (March 2, 1909 ‚Äì January 22, 1994)Death Record: George K. Hirst (accessed February 21, 2013) was an American virologist and science administrator who was among the first to study the molecular biology and genetics of animal viruses, especially influenza virus. He directed the Public Health Research Institute in New York City (1956‚Äì1981), and was also the founding editor-in-chief of Virology, the first English-language journal to focus on viruses. He is particularly known for inventing the hemagglutination assay, a simple method for quantifying viruses, and adapting it into the hemagglutination inhibition assay, which measures virus-specific antibodies in serum. He was the first to discover that viruses can contain enzymes, and the first to propose that virus genomes can consist of discontinuous segments. The New York Times described him as \\"a pioneer in molecular virology.\\" Education and career Hirst was born in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, USA, but his family soon moved to Lewistown, Montana. He studied at Hobart College in Geneva, New York, and later at Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, from which he gained his first degree and medical degree (1933). He worked at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research in New York City in 1936‚Äì1940, under the supervision of Homer Swift and Rebecca Lancefield, and then moved to the Rockefeller Foundation's International Health Division laboratories in 1940. There he combined research in collaboration with Frank Horsfall, Edwin D. Kilbourne and others with his army service, as a member of the Armed Forces Epidemiological Board's Commission on Influenza.US Army Medical Department: Office of Medical History: Commission on Influenza (accessed February 21, 2013) After the Second World War, Hirst joined the Public Health Research Institute in New York City, which had been established in 1942, where he remained until his retirement in 1983. He became head of the Infectious Diseases and Virology Divisions, and in 1956 succeeded L. Whittington Gorham as director of the institute, a position he held for nearly 25 years until 1981. During his tenure, he superintended its expansion and move to a new location on 26th Street and First Avenue.George Keble Hirst, 84, is dead; a pioneer in molecular virology.

Human influenza virus had first been isolated just a few years earlier.American Society for Virology: Viruses: From Structure to Biology: An idiosyncratic and incomplete list citing some highlights in the history of structural virology set in the context of the history of virology and other historical moments (accessed February 20, 2013) Later, Hirst also studied other vertebrate RNA viruses, including poliovirus, mumps and Newcastle disease virus.Hirst GK. (1962) Genetic recombination with Newcastle disease virus, polioviruses, and influenza. Cold Spring Harbor Symposia on Quantitative Biology 27: 303‚Äì309 (pdf)Hirst GK. (1950) Receptor destruction by viruses of the mumps‚ÄìNDV‚Äìinfluenza group. Journal of Experimental Medicine 91: 161‚Äì175 (pdf) Although viruses had been shown to infect animals in 1898, research on animal viruses was much less advanced in the 1940s and 1950s than that on plant viruses and bacteriophages, which were easier to handle experimentally. =Hemagglutination= In 1941, Hirst discovered that adding influenza virus particles to red blood cells caused them to agglutinate or stick together forming a lattice, a phenomenon called hemagglutination. Hemagglutination provided a convenient method of diagnosing influenza in the laboratory, which had previously been performed by cultivating the virus in ferrets. Hirst developed this reaction into the hemagglutination assay, which allows the amount of virus in the sample to be measured. This technique is rapid, accurate and convenient, and later proved to be applicable to many other viruses.Joklik WK. (1999) When two is better than one: Thoughts on three decades of interaction between Virology and the Journal of Virology. J Virol 73: 3520‚Äì3523 (text) Wolfgang Joklik cites the discovery of hemagglutination as one of the \\"early epoch-making discoveries in virology,\\" stating that it made influenza virus \\"the first mammalian virus whose replication could be studied biochemically.\\" Although Hirst did not know this at the time, hemagglutination is caused by the influenza virus hemagglutinin (a glycoprotein on the viral envelope) binding to sialic acid on the surface of the red blood cell; the same mechanism is central to the influenza virus entering its host cell.Racaniello V. Influenza hemagglutination inhibition assay (27 May 2009) (accessed February 19, 2013) =Hemagglutination inhibition and vaccination= Diagram of influenza virus, showing the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) He soon realised that the hemagglutination assay could easily be adapted to measure the levels of antibody specific to the virus strain in human serum: any antibodies present bind to the influenza virus particles, prevent them from crosslinking red blood cells and so inhibit hemagglutination. This hemagglutination inhibition assay (HIA) can be applied to many other viruses carrying a hemagglutinin molecule, including rubella, measles, mumps, parainfluenza, adenoviruses, polyomaviruses and arboviruses, and is still widely used in influenza surveillance and vaccine testing.Specter et al, p. 259WHO Collaborating Center for Surveillance, Epidemiology and Control of Influenza: The 2011‚Äì2012 WHO influenza reagent kit for identification of influenza isolates (accessed February 21, 2013) Hannah Hoag, writing in Nature Medicine in 2013, describes the assay as \\"the gold-standard serologic test to type influenza antibodies in humans and animals.\\"Hoag H. (2013) A universal problem. Nature Medicine 19: 12‚Äì14 (text) HIA is \\"a powerful epidemiological tool,\\" according to virologist Vincent Racaniello, and Hirst explored its application to epidemiological studies. He was one of several researchers who developed and trialed inactivated influenza vaccines in the mid-1940s, and he applied HIA to the study of antibody responses to vaccination.Oldstone, p. 26Francis T, Jr. (1953) Vaccination against influenza. Bulletin of the World Health Organization 8: 725‚Äì741 (pdf) =Neuraminidase and the virus receptor= Influenza neuraminidase bound to an inhibitor Hirst noticed that hemagglutination tended to wear off over time, and in 1942, he discovered that influenza virus has an intrinsic enzymatic activity that can release the virus from its attachment to red blood cells. This was a ground-breaking discovery, as previously a key distinction between viruses and bacteria had been that viruses were believed to lack enzymes.Gottschalk A, Bharghava AS. \\"Neuraminidases\\" in The Enzymes, Vol. 5 (PD Boyer, ed.), pp. 322‚Äì333 (Academic Press; 1971) () Hirst demonstrated that red blood cells once de-agglutinated could not be re-agglutinated, and correctly deduced that the enzyme destroys a receptor for the virus on the red blood cells. This enzyme, then referred to as the \\"receptor-destroying enzyme\\" was later shown to be the influenza neuraminidase, another viral envelope glycoprotein, which acts as a sialidase.Colman PM. (1994) Influenza virus neuraminidase: Structure, antibodies, and inhibitors. Protein Science 3: 1687‚Äì1696 (pdf)Laver G. \\"Influenza virus surface glycoproteins, haemagglutinin and neuraminidase: a personal account\\" in Influenza (CW Potter, ed.), p. 31 (Perspectives in Medical Virology series) (Elsevier; 2002) () Like hemagglutinin, neuraminidase is essential for the influenza life cycle, being required for the progeny virus to leave the host cell. Neuraminidase is the target of the neuraminidase inhibitor class of antiviral drugs, which include oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza).Jefferson T, Jones M, Doshi P, Del Mar C. (2009) Neuraminidase inhibitors for preventing and treating influenza in healthy adults: systematic review and meta-analysis. BMJ 339: b5106 (pdf) Hirst subsequently found that influenza virus interacts with a similar receptor on its target cell during infection, providing a model for the initiation of viral infection that turned out to apply to all viruses. He continued to investigate the nature of this cellular receptor during the 1940s and 1950s, correctly proposing in 1948 that the receptor might be one or more mucoproteins.Nicholls JM, Lai J, Garcia JM. \\"Investigating the interaction between influenza and sialic acid: Making and breaking the link\\" in Influenza Virus Sialidase ‚Äì A Drug Discovery Target (M von Itzstein, ed.) (Milestones in Drug Therapy series), p. 32 (Springer; 2012) () =Segmented influenza genome= Starting in the late 1940s, Hirst carried out pioneering research into the genetics of animal viruses. His team built on Frank Macfarlane Burnet's work on recombination in influenza virus, carrying out a series of experiments that led Hirst to conclude in 1962 that influenza's genome must consist of several separate fragments, \\"a truly revolutionary idea at the time,\\" according to R. Walter Schlesinger and Allan Granoff. Influenza viruses are now known to have eight such segments, and the segmentation of its genome facilitates the exchange of segments between different influenza viruses, causing antigenic shift which can result in pandemics.DeFranco et al., p. 258 Segmented genomes are also found in many other viruses. Virology journal Hirst founded the journal Virology in 1955, together with bacteriophage specialist Salvador Luria and plant virologist Lindsay Black. It was the first journal in the English language to specialise in publishing research into viruses, and it united basic science research across viruses infecting all types of host, a lifelong objective of Hirst's. The founding editor-in-chief, he headed up the journal for 21 years, until 1975. On his retirement, he was praised by his co-editors: Awards and honors Hirst gave the 1948 Harvey Lecture of the New York Academy of Medicine on the topic of \\"The nature of hemagglutination by viruses\\" and, in 1961, the inaugural Pfizer Lecture in Virology at the Institute of Virology in Glasgow, UK, on \\"Development of virology as an independent science\\".Hirst GK. (1962) Development of virology as an independent science. British Medical Journal 26 May: 1431‚Äì1437 (pdf) In 1966, he was elected to membership of the National Academy of Sciences and in 1975, to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was awarded the Academy Medal of the New York Academy of Medicine \\"for distinguished contributions in biomedical science\\" in 1975.New York Academy of Medicine: Anniversary Discourse & Awards (accessed February 21, 2013) Character and personal life His colleague Edwin Kilbourne described Hirst as \\"a scientist's scientist‚Äîa virologist's virologist\\" with an \\"incredible\\" variety of expertise and an \\"insatiable curiosity,\\" who pursued the underlying explanation for his experimental findings with tenacity.Kilbourne ED. (1975) Presentation of the Academy Medal to George K. Hirst, M.D. Bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine 51: 1133‚Äì1136 (pdf) According to Kilbourne, he was very private person who did not seek publicity. His non-scientific pursuits included music ‚Äì he was both a musician and a musicologist ‚Äì gardening, and the appreciation of nature. Hirst married Charlotte Hart in 1937, and the couple had four sons and a daughter. In retirement he moved to Palo Alto, California. His wife predeceased him in 1990.

In political sociology and anthropology, it is also a concept often credited to Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels for originating, who wrote that hunter- gatherer societies were traditionally based on egalitarian social relations and common ownership. A primary inspiration for both Marx and Engels were Lewis Henry Morgan's descriptions of \\"communism in living\\" as practised by the Iroquois Nation of North America.Morgan, L. H. 1881. Houses and House-Life of the American Aborigines. Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press. In Marx's model of socioeconomic structures, societies with primitive communism had no hierarchical social class structures or capital accumulation. Engels offered the first detailed elaboration upon that of primitive communism in 1884, with the publication of The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State. Marx and Engels used the term more broadly than Marxists did later, and applied it not only to hunter-gatherers but also to some subsistence agriculture communities. There is also no agreement among later scholars, including Marxists, on the historical extent, or longevity, of primitive communism. Marx and Engels also noted how capitalist accumulation latched itself onto social organizations of primitive communism. For instance, in private correspondence the same year that The Origin of the Family was published, Engels attacked European colonialism, describing the Dutch regime in Java directly organizing agricultural production and profiting from it, \\"on the basis of the old communistic village communities\\". He added that cases like the Dutch East Indies, British India and the Russian Empire showed \\"how today primitive communism furnishes ... the finest and broadest basis of exploitation\\".Engels, cited by T. B. Bottomore, A Dictionary of Marxist Thought, Oxford, Wiley-Blackwell, 1991, p174.  Nature of primitive communist societies  In a primitive communist society, all able bodied persons would have engaged in obtaining food, and everyone would share in what was produced by hunting and gathering. There would be no private property, which is distinguished from personal property such as articles of clothing and similar personal items, because primitive society produced no surplus; what was produced was quickly consumed and this was because there existed no division of labour, hence people were forced to work together. The few things that existed for any length of time (tools, housing) were held communally,The Neolithic Revolution and the Birth of Civilization , World Civilizations: The Global Experience, Peter N. Stearns, Michael B. Adas, Stuart B. Schwartz, Marc Jason Gilbert, , , Pearson, 2004. in Engels' view in association with matrilocal residence and matrilineal descent.Knight, C. 2008. Early Human Kinship Was Matrilineal. In N. J. Allen, H. Callan, R. Dunbar and W. James (eds.), Early Human Kinship. Oxford: Blackwell, pp. 61-82. There would have been no state. Domestication of animals and plants following the Neolithic Revolution through herding and agriculture was seen as the turning point from primitive communism to class society as it was followed by private ownership and slavery, with the inequality that they entailed. In addition, parts of the population specialized in different activities, such as manufacturing, culture, philosophy, and science which is said to lead to the development of social classes.

Richard Borshay Lee criticizes the mainstream and dominant culture's long-time bias against the possible existence of primitive communism, deriding \\"Bourgeois ideology [that] would have us believe that primitive communism doesn't exist.

According to the paper, while levels of inequality were low, they were still present, with the average hunter-gatherer group having a Gini coefficient of 0.25 (for comparison, this was attained by the nation of Denmark in 2007).Smith, Eric Alden, Kim Hill, Frank W.

A. Cohen, the culmination of his attempts to reformulate Karl Marx's doctrines of alienation, exploitation, and historical materialism. Cohen, who interprets Marxism as a scientific theory of history, applies the techniques of analytic philosophy to the elucidation and defence of Marx's materialist conception of history. The work for which Cohen is best known, Karl Marx's Theory of History helped to establish analytical Marxism and was awarded the Isaac Deutscher memorial prize.http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/2009/farmelant080809.html Cohen's interpretation of Marx runs counter to most forms of twentieth-century Marxism, and has been criticised as a form of technological determinism. Summary Cohen maintains that the technological determinism of Marx's summary of his science of history in the preface to A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy defines his real views on the subject, a view with which other scholars have disagreed. This interpretation of Marx closely resembles that of Karl Kautsky and Georgi Plekhanov, and runs counter to most forms of twentieth century Marxism, which emphasized the importance of the relations of production. Cohen employs analytic philosophy to make his case. He defends technological determinism by arguing for two theses, which he calls the \\"development thesis\\" and the \\"primacy thesis.\\" The development thesis rests upon three presuppositions: that human beings are \\"somewhat rational\\", that their historical situation is one of scarcity, and that they \\"possess intelligence of a kind and degree which enables them to improve their situation.\\" The existence of scarcity ensures a struggle for survival, the existence of intelligence ensures that scarcity-reducing innovations will occur, and the existence of rationality ensures that there will be a tendency to adopt them. Cohen seeks to establish the primacy thesis by arguing that different relations of production have differential capabilities for generating growth in the productive forces at different stages of development. Cohen proposes that explanation in Marx‚Äôs theory is functional, by which he means roughly that the character of what is explained is determined by its effect on what explains it, so that \\"production relations profoundly affect productive forces, and superstructures strongly condition foundations.\\"G. A. Cohen, Karl Marx's Theory of History: A Defence (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1978), p. 278. Functional explanation provides a way of recognizing the vital influence of the legal-political superstructure on the economic structure, while still assigning explanatory primacy to the latter. Thus the superstructure stabilizes its economic base, but in the other direction the economic relations determine the character of the superstructure, so that in this sense the economic base is primary and the superstructure secondary. It is precisely because the superstructure strongly affects the base that the base selects that superstructure. The relation between forces and relations of production is also explained functionally: the level of development of society‚Äôs productive forces (i.e., society‚Äôs technological powers, including tools, machinery, raw materials, and labour power) determines society‚Äôs economic structure, in the sense that it selects a structure of economic relations that tends best to facilitate further technological growth. As Charles Taylor puts it, \\"These two directions of influence are so far from being rivals that they are actually complementary. The functional explanation requires that the secondary factor tend to have a causal effect on the primary, for this dispositional fact is the key feature of the explanation.\\"Charles Taylor, ‚ÄúCritical Notice‚Äù, Canadian Journal of Philosophy 10 (1980), p. 330. Influence and scholarly evaluation Karl Marx's Theory of History: A Defence helped establish analytical Marxism as a school of thought,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/10/ga-cohen- obituary and came to be seen as a classic. The book was praised by the historian G. E. M. de Ste. Croix, and was also commended by the political scientist David McLellan. According to the philosopher Peter Singer, Cohen, in contrast to some more Hegelian interpretations of Marx's thought, \\"argues brilliantly for a more old-fashioned interpretation of Marxism as a scientific theory of history, an interpretation often known ‚Äì disparagingly ‚Äì as 'technological determinism'.\\" The political theorist Norman Geras described Karl Marx's Theory of History as the leading philosophical discussion of the way in which the character of human beings in any setting depends upon the nature of the prevailing social relations. The philosopher Roger Scruton, though finding Cohen's attempt to present historical materialism as a scientific hypothesis impressive, observes that it shows how difficult it is to develop the necessary concepts. M. C. Howard and J. E. King note that Cohen's ideas have played no role in the debate on underdevelopment. They find this surprising, given their relevance to it. They believe that Cohen's analysis is of higher quality than that of the main protagonists in the debate, reinforcing their critical view of the work of Paul Baran, Andre Gunder Frank, and Immanuel Wallerstein. The critic Terry Eagleton, who understands Cohen to be espousing a determinist theory in which productive forces automatically produce certain social relations, finds Karl Marx's Theory of History: A Defence to be a skillful defense of a \\"wrongheaded\\" idea. Nicolas Vrousalis summarizes the criticisms against Cohen's determinism, and concludes that technological materialism requires a sharp distinction between material and social properties, which Cohen's theory does not provide. The productive forces therefore cannot be distinguished from the relations of production in the way that technological determinism requires.

Front cover of Even Higher  Content  While High Above looked back at the history of broadcasting and the role of satellites in the expansion of television, Even Higher explores the future of broadcasting. It looks forward at the next 25 years and how the television industry is changing to accommodate second screens and social media, as well as how broadcasters and industry insiders expect that future to look. The contributors to Even Higher are the thinkers, the planners and the creatives who are now determining the shape of broadcasting‚Äôs future, and in the book explain their expectations as to the future shape of broadcasting. They examine in detail the future for Linear TV, given the brief to look forward as much as 25 years at broadcasting‚Äôs future and highlight some of the developments and plans now taking place across the industry and to examine how they will affect our lives.Even Higher Broadgate Publications (September, 2010). pp10 In addition, Even Higher includes whimsical chapters looking back on 25 years of broadcasting developments from the year 2037, written by broadcasting technology journalists, Geoff Bains, Julian Clover, and J√∂rn Krieger. The book acknowledges that in the broadcasting industry, looking forward 25 months is a challenge, let alone 25 years, not only because of the developing technologies involved but also because of influences outside the direct broadcasting industry, such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube which have a huge effect on broadcasting today but were almost unknown just ten years ago.

To me the most significant changes that have happened to our industry over the past 25 years and which will doubtless continue over the next 25 concern the nature of broadcasting itself - Adrian Scott, Bakewell House Consultancy *Not too long ago, forecasters announced that traditional television broadcasting is dead. The most prominent voice among the doomsayers was one of our modern icons, Bill Gates, the great technology pioneer of the 20th century. He predicted that everything ‚Äì television, internet, videos, applications and e-commerce ‚Äì will soon converge into a single device: The personal computer. On the one hand, he was right. This convergence is indeed happening. But it is not happening on the personal computer. In fact, the PC is having an ever harder time prevailing against the upcoming dominance of tablets, laptops and smart phones - Ferdinand Kayser, SES, Luxembourg *The path to a new multi- platform, multi-screen future will not be easy. Dramatic shifts need to take place and that brings new challenges - Simon Frost, Ericsson *We now find ourselves in the middle of a smartphone and tablet revolution, where consumers increasingly ‚Äì and rightly ‚Äì expect the content they engage with at home to be available to them on-the-go - Robin Crossley, BSkyB *The future of TV, is TV! To paraphrase Mark Twain, the reports of TV‚Äôs death have been greatly exaggerated. If everything preached by internet visionaries or predicted by consulting firms were true, TV would already be dead - Gerhard Zeiler, TBS *Broadcasting is going through its greatest evolution since John Logie Baird first demonstrated the potential of TV in the 1920s - Mark Hollinger, Discovery International *Mankind is witnessing another revolution in media. Media consumption today has become a lot smarter, not only by name but also in its overall value proposition - Stephan Heimbecher, Sky Deutschland *Predicting the future of broadcasting is hard because we must know how our society might evolve, which is itself a very difficult task. As a broadcaster, our target is to provide UHDTV broadcast service to homes from 2020 through satellite broadcasting in the 21GHz band. The speed of technological innovation is much faster nowadays.

His was a family without money, without land, without education, without any financial and intellectual resources that could give Lal Singh a start for upward social or economic mobility. The family was fitted to perform only manual and menial agricultural labour, and Lal Singh's father, almost throughout his life, worked as an agricultural labourer on someone's land.

While as a small boy of five or six, out of innocence, he dares to bathe at a jat farmer's well. He is immediately dragged away, whip-lashed thrice and, driven out by the farmer's son. As a 'chamar' he is not permitted to bathe at the well of an upper caste. He is pushed into this 'fire' again and again, at school, at college where he dares to fall in love with an upper caste girl, and even within the egalitarian Naxalite movement.'Lal Singh Dil was born in a 'chamar' family. Reference to this occurs at many places in his poetry. In his autobiography he has written freely about the prevalence of the arrogance of caste superiority in his locality, at his school, and in the Naxalite organizations and among the police,' says Amarjit Chandan.

He also lived in a timber godown.' Dutt 2012, see Foreword by Prem Parkash](1998).p.xiii . (translated from Punjabi by Nirupama Dutt) Sometime in 1972 he had converted to Islam because he believed there was no caste discrimination in Islam; and also in the hope of marrying, a hope that did not materialize.

In Uttar Pradesh, after his conversion to Islam, he hoped his caste would not come in the way and he would be able to find a woman who would be willing to marry him. But this never happened. This is what Prem Parkash writes: 'Lal has not written about any love affair with a woman in his memoirs, he has only given indications of his fantasies. He even talks in abstractions. Comrades accuse him of several things but I am sure he has never seen a woman unclothed.'Dutt 2012, see Foreword by Prem Parkash p.xvi (1998) (Translated from Punjabi by Nirupama Dutt) Even while in Uttar Pradesh he did not give up writing poetry.

Some of his poems were published in well-known Punjabi magazines, Lakeer, Preetlari and Nagmani, even before his first collection of poetry was published. He published three collections of poetry: Setluj Di Hawa (Breeze from the Sutlej) 1971; Bahut Sarey Suraj (So Many Suns) 1982; and Satthar (A Sheaf) 1997. A collected volume of all his poems titled Naglok (The World of the NƒÅgas) was published in 1998 and 2007. He also wrote a long poem titled Aj Billa Phir Aaya (Billa Came Again Today), which was published in 2009, posthumously. He published his autobiography, Dastaan, in 1998, containing a Foreword by Amarjit Chandan and an Afterword by Prem Parkash. Although he had converted to Islam, he continued to publish his works under his pre-conversion name.  Translations of his works  I English translations of five of his poems were published in the ''Modern Poetry in Translation(MPT), Third Series Number Eighteen, Transitions, in 2012. II An English translation by Nirupama Dutt of his autobiography, Dastaan, along with his 20 poems, has been published as: Poet of the Revolution: The Memoirs and Poems of Lal Singh Dil (Viking Penguin, 2012).] III An English translation of his one hundred poems titled 'Exclusion Deprivation and Nothingness Lal Singh Dil Selected Poems' translated by T C Ghai has been published by LG Publishers Distributors, Delhi in 2017.  About his poetry  His contemporary revolutionary poets, Pash foremost among them, sang of a revolution round the corner, using blood and thunder imagery to denounce, frighten and challenge the 'class enemies', predicting the imminent fall of the 'comprador bourgeois state'. Lal Singh Dil shared their optimism, but in most of his poetry he remained a poet of the understatement. His poetry is revolutionary in another very important sense. It focuses, for the first time in Punjabi poetry, on the lives of men and women and children who are absolutely at the lowest rungs of the Indian society, the social and economic out-castes - the Dalits, the landless labourers and farm workers, the daily wagers, and many nomadic and wandering 'non-Aryan' tribes (who he believes were the original inhabitants of India, and whom he calls the Naglok through the title of the collected work of his poems) conquered by the invading Aryans; the people to be exploited and humiliated, to be used and abused and kept at the margins of everything decent and worthwhile. His poetry is a narrative of the wretched of the earth told by one of them.Ghai 2012, pp.50-51 Dil was not a great reader of books. He just did not have the means to buy or access many books or other written materials. His understanding of life, of history, religion and society, has been mostly picked up from his environment and experience, which makes his poetry distinctive and different, for it has a quality of the raw, the unformed and the folk. His poetry gives voice to the voiceless, the ignored and in their language, through their unsophisticated mixture of truth, prejudice, anger, bitterness and humour, desire for revenge, and for transcendence as in fairy tales.

Technological Forecasting & Social Change, Vol. 77, pp. 265-278, 2010 or simply to interpret the abbreviation ICT. The term Information and Communication(s) Technology (ICT) has been defined as an extended synonym for information technology (IT) to emphasize the integration with (tele)communications. Content published in mass communication media such as printed, audio-visual and online contents and related services are not considered as ICT products, but are referred to as the Media & Content products.OECD: Guide to Measuring the Information Society 2011 (), p. 206, August 2011 The abbreviation TIM, as the Telecom IT Media sector is used to express the full integration of the Telecommunications, IT and Media & Content sectors.World Economic Forum: Digital Ecosystem - Convergence between IT, Telecoms, Media and Entertainment: Scenarios to 2015.

The relationship and position of the terms can be demonstrated by a digital convergence prism (Figure 1), which shows the three components (T, I, M) and their pairs and the triple combination (convergent TIM triplet) according to the rule of additive colour mixing. Assuming that telecommunications (Telecom) is blue, informatics (IT) is green and Media & Content is red, then teleinformatics/telematics is cyan, telemedia/networked media is magenta, media informatics is yellow, and the convergent TIM is white. In such a way, the integrated TIM sector corresponds to the prism as a whole, the ICT sector to the whole minus the red area (Media & Content), and the Infocommunications relates to Telecom and neighbouring three areas (blue, cyan, magenta and white).

Britain had been at war with Germany for only five days, and Canada was not officially at war with Germany until the following day. Thompson was taken to Berlin for propaganda photos and for a meeting with Luftwaffe chief Hermann Goering. Thompson was sent to several POW camps before ending up at Stalag Luft III near Sagan.

He was held longer as a POW than any other Canadian ever. While in captivity, in November 1944, he was transferred from the RAF to the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF). After the war, Thompson returned to Canada and became a lawyer. He also married, and with his wife raised eight children.

Raised by a literate family, Dostoyevsky discovered literature at an early age, beginning when his mother introduced the Bible to him. Nannies near the hospitalsin the grounds of which he was raisedintroduced Dostoyevsky to fairy tales, legends and sagas. His mother's subscription to the Library of Reading gave him access to the leading contemporary Russian and non-Russian literature. After his mother's death, Dostoyevsky moved from a boarding school to a military academy and despite the resulting lack of money, he was captivated by literature until his death. Dostoyevsky started his writing career after finishing university. He started translating literature from Frenchwhich he learnt at the boarding schoolinto Russian, and then wrote short stories. With the success of his first novel, Poor Folk, he became known throughout Saint Petersburg and Russia. Vissarion Belinsky, Alexander Herzen and others praised Poor Folks depiction of poverty, and Belinsky called it Russia's \\"first social novel\\". This success did not continue with his second novel, The Double, and other short stories published mainly in left-wing magazines. These magazines included Notes of the Fatherland and The Contemporary. Dostoyevsky's renewed financial troubles led him to join several political circles. Because of his participation in the Petrashevsky Circle, in which he distributed and read several Belinsky articles deemed as anti-religious and anti-government, he and other members were sentenced to capital punishment. He was pardoned at the last minute, but they were imprisoned in SiberiaDostoyevsky for four years. During his detention he wrote several works, including the autobiographical The House of the Dead. A New Testament booklet, which had been given shortly before his imprisonment, and other literature obtained outside of the barracks, were the only books he read at that time. Following his release, Dostoyevsky read a myriad of literature and gradually became interested in nationalistic and conservative philosophies and increasingly sceptical towards contemporary movementsespecially the Nihilists. Dostoyevsky wrote his most important works after his time in Siberia, including Crime and Punishment, The Idiot, The Gambler and The Brothers Karamazov. With the help of his brother Mikhail, Dostoyevsky opened two magazinesVremya and Epochin which some of his stories appeared. Following their closures, most of his works were issued in the conservative The Russian Messenger until the introduction of A Writer's Diary, which comprised most of his worksincluding essays and articles. Several drafts and plans, especially those begun during his honeymoon, were unfinished at his death.

The initial 1873 works were published in The Citizen, the editor of which was Dostoyevsky, and from 1876 ‚Äì 1877 the Diary was self-published. The English titles of the following list of works are extracted from Kenneth Lantz's two-volume translations. A Writer's Diary is a collection mainly of essays and articles, which also include, for example, answers to readers, introductions, etc., making the Diaries a journal-like book written and mostly edited by Dostoyevsky. List of initial Diary articles, issued in 1873: *\\"Introduction\\" *\\"Old People\\" *\\"Environment\\" *\\"Something Personal\\" *\\"Vlas\\" *\\"A Troubled Countenance\\" *\\"A Half-Letter From 'A Certain Person'\\" *\\"Apropos of the Exhibition\\" *\\"An Impersonator\\" *\\"Dreams and Musings\\" *\\"Apropos of a New Play\\" *\\"Little Picture\\" *\\"To a Teacher\\" *\\"Something about Lying\\" *\\"One of Today's Falsehoods\\" Other articles and essays Dostoyevsky wrote articles and essays outside the Diaries collection. These include the 1863 travelogue Winter Notes on Summer Impressions, in which he satirised and criticised European life. Other articles were written in response or as a criticism to a literary work, a person's view, requests to the military during the imprisonment period, announcements, notes and explanations. Some of them were written for different journals or almanacs.

He died in the Battle of Por√©daka, when his forces were destroyed by French artillery. Background The Imamate of Futa Jallon was one of the last independent states in Senegambia, in the highlands where the Gambia River and Senegal River both rise. It was established as a theocratic state in a jihad launched in 1725 by Karamokho Alfa, and consolidated by his successor Ibrahim Sori. The state was a loose federation of nine provinces, each headed by chief. Two political factions emerged, the Alfaya and Soriya, supporters of the descendants of the first two rulers. A power sharing arrangement evolved under which the position of almami, the head of state, was alternately filled by an Alfaya or Soriya candidate. By the late nineteenth century the French were the dominant colonial power in the region, and were increasingly impatient with the Futa Jallon's hostility. They were angry with the support Futa Jallon was giving to Samori Ture's Wassoulou Empire, which was also resisting French control. In 1889 the British made a treaty with the French that recognized that Futa Jallon was within the French sphere. However, the British in Freetown, Sierra Leone, continued to give subsidies to Futa Jallon until 1895. Almami of Futa Jallon Bokar Biro belonged to the Soriya faction. His base was Timbo, the capital of the Futa Jallon federation. In 1890, the long reign of the Almami Ibrahima Sori Dongolfella ended with his death, triggering a power struggle. The Council of Elders selected Bokar Biro's elder brother as ruler. Bokar Biro took power in a coup after assassinating his brother, and began placing men loyal to him in positions of authority. Bokar Biro had to cope with struggles between the Alfaya and Soriya political factions, and attempts by the rulers of the Lab√©, Timbi and Fugumba provinces to obtain more autonomy. Also, both slaves and ordinary free people were leaving the country for the less oppressive French-controlled zones. In July 1892 Bokar Biro was forced to cede power to Amadu of the Alfaya faction. He assumed power once again in June 1894. Some of the chiefs asked for French help to overthrow him. The Alfa Yaya of Lab√© began maneuvering for full independence of his province. On 13 December 1895 the disgruntled chiefs led by Modi Abdoullaye Dhokhir√© attacked and defeated Bokar Biro at Bantignel, and he only narrowly managed to escape. Several weeks later, when most people thought that Bokar Biro was dead, he emerged at Keebu, on the western border of the Timbi province, whose chief gave him assistance in returning to Timbo. He managed to assemble a new army of 1,500 soldiers with which he defeated his enemies on 2 February 1896. The main chiefs went into hiding. French intervention At the end of 1894 the French sent Raoul de Beeckman as their representative to meet with Bokar Biro and arrange a treaty. By March 1895 de Beeckman had spent almost three months on the border of Futa Jallon and was giving up hope of arranging a meeting. Without authorization, the French administrator crossed the border and attacked the village of Nanso, near Demukulima, which he accused of having looted a caravan belonging to a French ally. One of the village elders was killed. This incident fueled the hostility of Bokar Biro, who accused the French of a series of hostile actions, including suppression of the trade in slaves with the Sudan, and refusal to return runaway slaves. He was also suspicious of visits to Futa Jallon by French agents on the pretext of trading or making topographical studies, which he thought were in preparation for military intervention. De Beeckman returned to Futa Jallon the next year. On 18 March 1896 de Beeckman arrived at Timbo, the Futa Jallon capital, with a detachment of troops. The French demanded the right to build roads through Futa Jallon, to instal a representative in Timbo, to vet all appointments of provincial chiefs and a trade monopoly. Bokar Biro resisted, but eventually pretended to sign a treaty in order to get the French out of the way while he dealt with his opponents. When the treaty document was examined in Saint Louis, it turned out that in place of his signature Bokar Biro had written \\"Bismillah\\", meaning \\"in the name of God\\". Once it was clear that Bokar Biro did not intend to yield to French demands, they decided to resort to armed force if necessary once the rainy season had passed. The French troops temporarily withdrew to Sangoya. Bokar Biro treated the French withdrawal as a victory. He initiated an aggressively anti-French policy. When his term as Almami came to an end in April 1896 he refused to hand over office. The power struggle escalated, with violent incidents, coming close to outright civil war, with calls for assistance reaching the French in September and October. The French decided the time had come to make their move, breaking up Futa Jallon into smaller client states, with their ally Umar Bademba as Almami of what remained of the Timbo-based state. Death Troops were dispatched from Senegal, Guinea and the Sudan, converging on Futa Jallon. A French column captured Timbo on 3 November 1896. Bokar Biro was unable to enlist the support of the chiefs in resisting the French. On 13 November 1896 Bokar Biro fought a pitched battle on the plain of Por√©daka. The French artillery destroyed his army. A poet who described the battle said that Bokar Biro kept his word. He did not flee from the French, but was killed by the blast of the cannon. In fact, Bokar Biro managed to escape but was soon captured by some soldiers of his enemy, Sori Illili, and was decapitated. Bokar Biro's son died with him. With Bokar Biro's death, the French assumed a protectorate. In June 1897 Ernest Noirot, a former set designer for the Folies Berg√®re, became administrator and started a program to eliminate slavery. In 1904 the French removed the power of the chiefs. In 1905 they arrested Bokar Biro's arch rival Alfa Yaya and sent him into exile.

It was established in 2006 and is supported by the Federal Republic of Germany through KfW. It works in Bwabwata, Khaudum, Mudumu and Nkasa Rupara (formerly Mamili) national parks in north eastern Namibia. The parks are part of a larger conservation area, the Kavango and Zambezi Trans-frontier Conservation Area (KAZA TFCA). They contain biodiversity and habitat that are not found elsewhere in Namibia. They are also important for tourism. Partners believe that investment in the north eastern parks contributes to the ecological and economic development of the KAZA TFCA. The north eastern national parks are relatively new compared with other Namibian protected areas. Khaudum, Mudumu and Mamili (now Nkasa Rupara ) national parks were created shortly before Namibia gained Independence from South Africa in 1990. Bwabwata National Park was created in 2007. It consists of the former Caprivi Game Park and Mahango Game Reserve. Bwabwata National Park has more than 5,500 park residents, mainly Khoe San or Bushmen. Large communities of mainly subsistence farmers surround the all of these parks. The Namibian government has developed programmes to ensure that communities can manage and benefit from natural resources. Integrated park management builds on Namibia‚Äôs Community-based Natural Resource Management (CBNRM) Programme. The NamParks Programme builds on the CBNRM Programme to include the management of national parks in land units. NamParks encourages biodiversity conservation and the wise use of natural resources. Large game migrates across the Caprivi Strip in Namibia between Botswana, Angola, Namibia and Zambia. Areas known as animal migration corridors are zoned so that animals do not destroy farmland. The German Government has committed EUR12 million to three programme phases. It has also committed EUR10 million over 6 years for developing the KAZA initiative. * NamParks has concentrated on improved park planning, good park management and development, staff training and biodiversity protection. * It has helped develop management, business and tourism plans that guide short and long-term park management. * Funding has improved park infrastructure, such as park management stations. * New vehicles and boats were bought to help staff conduct for patrols and extension work. * NamParks has encouraged strong partnerships with existing programmes and NGOs in support of common objectives.

The majority of the genre features trans women, but trans men are sometimes featured. Trans women are most often featured with male partners, but they are also featured with other women, both transgender and cisgender.  Terminology  It is common in transgender pornography to use terms that are generally regarded as pejorative slurs in the trans community, such as \\"chicks with dicks\\", \\"trannies\\", or \\"shemales\\". Transgender pornographic actress Wendy Williams said she disagreed with activists who thought these sorts of terms are slurs. In 2017, a major trans porn site changed their name from ShemaleYum to GroobyGirls and announced they would no longer use terms that are seen as stigmatizing. Trans women in pornography are sometimes called \\"tgirls\\", the t standing for transgender or transsexual.  Awards  AVN Award Transsexual Performer of the Year is one of the major industry awards for actors in the genre. Transgender Erotica Awards (formerly Tranny Awards) is the other major award. Trans women Pornographic film actress Wendy Williams Viewers of pornography featuring trans women typically identify as heterosexual. Transgender porn has become one of the largest, most popular genres of porn among heterosexual males. Data from RedTube, a pornographic video hosting site, indicated that as of 2016 and based on the frequency of online searches trans porn was most popular in Brazil, Italy, Argentina, Russia and Spain; the United States ranked at 12th place and within the US trans porn searches were most common in Wyoming.Carrie Weisman (June 6, 2016) Why Trans Porn Is Hugely Popular Among Hetero Men, AlterNet.org, accessed July 5, 2018 A spokesman for Evil Angel, a US porn production company, was quoted in 2015 as saying trans porn was the company's most profitable category, commanding premiums of about 20% more than other genres or scenes.\\"Let's say an Evil Angel wholesale DVD is in the $15 range. A trans release, same packaging is $19. Why? Because we can get it.\\" Trans pornographic actresses may be either sexually passive or active with their male co-stars. Some actresses, such as Danni Daniels, usually perform as a \\"top\\" or specialize in dominant roles. Trans men Pornographic film actor Viktor Belmont In 2005, Titan Media released a film titled Cirque Noir starring Buck Angel, marking the first time a trans man had been featured in an all-male film produced by a company specializing in gay male porn. Cyd St. Vincent founded \\"Bonus Hole Boys\\" in 2014, the first FTM gay porn company, in order to \\"show big-name gay porn stars having sex with trans men and loving it.\\" The formula has found a following among both women and gay men, with the majority of the company's fan-base being gay men. The gay male audience for FTM porn has become a growing niche as more gay men become exposed to the genre. In January 2018, the major gay porn studio Raw Fuck Club (RFC), released a scene starring Cyd St. Vincent titled \\"Some Men Have Pussies\\", becoming one of the few major gay porn companies to feature transgender men. The scene was largely popular, but provoked some controversy. Buck Angel's \\"Cirque Noir\\" and Cyd St. Vincent's \\"Some Men Have Pussies\\" have been praised as \\"landmark roles\\" in the representation of trans men in gay porn \\"whose magnitude cannot be understated.\\" As of 2019, gay trans man porn is still a relatively niche genre of pornography with few performers, but the market is growing each year as an audience develops for the genre.  Perception  Psychologist David J. Ley wrote that the popularity of transgender porn may have various causes, including sexual fluidity, the novelty factor, and because some trans women may act more like men sexually. Author J. Phillips wrote that the \\"phallic woman...challenges the fixity of our own sexual identity.\\" Neuroscientist Ogi Ogas said that some straight men are interested in porn with trans women because the brain likes \\"different sexual cues in novel combinations\\" and that men seem to have a strong interest in penises regardless of sexual orientation. Some in the LGBT community feel transgender pornography objectifies transgender people. Others argue it can have positive effects.

Listed as Bien de Interes Cultural by the Spanish Ministry of Culture in 1992, like the itself, it is an important city landmark. History The church is consecrated to (Mary the Virgin of Palm Sunday) since Palm Sunday 1344 when Alfonso XI of Castile conquered the city after the Siege of Algeciras (1342-1344). That year, Pope Clement VI created the Diocese of Algeciras which was linked to that of Cadiz after he had converted the grand mosque of Algeciras, in accordance with Christian rites, into a church. That city was, however, retaken by the Moors in 1368 and destroyed on the orders of Muhammed V of Granada. The Diocese of Algeciras disappeared with it. The church is the canonical seat of the ' (Brotherhood of Jesus of Nazareth, Holy Christ of the Faith, Holy Cross of Jerusalem and Mary of Sorrows). At the occasion of the bicentenary of the church, was made co- patron saint of Algeciras, with Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, in 1923 by Pope Pius XI. Work began on the current building in 1723 when, as a result of population growth, the nearby Chapel of Our Lady of Europe no longer provided sufficient space for the congregation. It was started by Alonso Barranco and completed by Isidro Casaus. According to Pascual Madoz in his Gazetteer of 1843, \\"the church was completed in 1738 with alms from the faithful and other resources, allowing Bishop Lorenzo Armengual de la Mota on June 6 of that year, to give it the status of parish church which until then had been enjoyed by the primitive chapel of the Cortijo de G√°lvez.\\" In 1736, the Iglesia de La Palma, which was still under construction, assumed the paroquial responsibilities. The Plaza Alta, constructed in 1807, includes the Iglesia de Nuestra Se√±ora de la Palma, as well as the Chapel of Our Lady of Europe, palm trees, and a fountain. Architecture and fittings It originally consisted of a nave and two aisles but two smaller aisles were added under the gable roof in 1795. The tower, high, was built between 1793 and 1804. Stones from the old town walls were used as the building material. The blocks, which can be seen in the tower, still bear the marks of stonemasons that can be seen elsewhere in the city. The church nave The nave has a barrel vault, separated from the sides by thick Doric columns, while vaulting of the aisles is supported by pilasters. The main features of the facade are buttresses on either side of the door and a niche for the Virgin Mary. The rear of the building was cleared at the beginning of 21st century but there a modern building remains on the left, obliterating the view over the Calle Ventura Mor√≥n. Inside there is an 18th-century Italian alabaster sculpture which, according to legend, was taken from a boat that was prevented from leaving the port by bad weather. It was badly damaged during the anti-religious incidents of May 1931 but was later restored. Other features of the church were not so fortunate: the high altar and the monstrance were lost. Due to restoration work, the interior has been completely cleaned up but there are hardly any decorations or pictures.

He was a son of Lutheran priest Christopher Lossius (1560- 1626). He studied character art and mathematics at the University of Leipzig. Lossius first worked for the Kongsberg Silver Mines where he started as an accountant (schichtmester) at the silver mine in 1631. In 1635, he relocated to the Kvikne Copper Works. In 1644, he started test production at Rauhammaren in the R√∏ros district, but initially the ore was poor. This led to the later discovery of the large deposit of copper ore at what became the Storwartz mines. Rights were issued in 1645 with Lossius as part-owner of the new company.

Jared Ingersoll (1722 in Milford, Connecticut ‚Äì August 1781 in New Haven, Connecticut) gained notoriety in Connecticut as agent for the Stamp Act of 1765. Biography Jared Ingersoll Sr. was descended from John Ingersoll Sr. (1615‚Äì1684), who was born in Edworth, Bedfordshire, England and settled in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. He graduated from Yale in 1742. After his graduation, he remained at Yale for a year as a Berkeley scholar, and then settled in New Haven and opened a legal practice, reaching a prominent position in the bar of New Haven County within a dozen years. By 1757 he held the office of King's Attorney, and in May 1758 the colonial legislature appointed him agent for Connecticut Colony at the English court, mainly to negotiate reimbursement for recent expenditures in the French and Indian War. He was resident in London working on this task from January 1759 until May 1760, when he resigned and returned to Connecticut. In October 1764, he returned to England to deliver a load of masts from the Connecticut River, and to advise his successor as agent. In 1765, he arrived in Boston from England charged with the commission of stamp agent for Connecticut, a position Benjamin Franklin had advised him to accept. After the demonstrations against the obnoxious act in various parts of the colonies, Ingersoll, assured of the governor's protection, tried to reason the people of New Haven into forbearance. Surrounding his house, they demanded him to resign. \\"I know not if I have the power to resign,\\" he replied. He promised, however, that he would return any stamps that he received or leave the matter to their decision. He was finally compelled to offer his resignation. His actions not satisfying the people of other sections of Connecticut, he resolved to place himself under the protection of the legislature in Hartford, in order to save his house from an attack. On his way to Hartford, he met a body of 500 men on horseback several miles below Wethersfield. They were preceded by three trumpeters and two militia officers. They received him and rode with him to Wethersfield, where they compelled him to resign his office. Entering a house for safety, he sent word of his situation to the governor and the assembly. After waiting for three hours the people entered the house. Ingersoll said, \\"The cause is not worth dying for,\\" and made a written declaration that his resignation was his own free act, without any equivocation. \\"Swear to it,\\" said the crowd, but this he refused to do. They then commanded him to shout \\"Liberty and property\\" three times, and, throwing his hat into the air, he obeyed. He was then escorted by a large crowd to Hartford, where he read to the assembly the paper that he had just signed. In April 1771, he and his family moved to Philadelphia where he took up his duties as Judge of the Court of Vice-Admiralty for the middle colonies. He received this commission in compensation for his ill treatment as stamp agent. With the onset of the Revolution, he incurred the displeasure of the Provincial Council of Pennsylvania, and in November 1777 was obliged to return to New Haven, where he died in 1781. He lies buried in the Center Church Crypt, under a memorial tablet lavishly praising his \\"uncommon Genius\\" and \\"graceful and majestic Dignity,\\" among other virtues. He was the subject of an influential political biography by a major American historian of the Imperial School, Lawrence Henry Gipson: Jared Ingersoll: A Study of American Loyalism in Relation to British Colonial Government, first published in 1920. Family In 1743, he married Hannah Whiting at Branford, Connecticut. She died in 1779. They had four children, of whom one survived infancy. In 1780, he married Hannah Miles, who survived him. His surviving child, also named Jared Ingersoll, took the side of the revolutionaries in the American Revolution. His brother Jonathan also graduated from Yale (Class of 1736).

Nanoracks signed their first contract with NASA in September 2009 and had their first laboratory on the Space Station in April 2010. MirCorp CEO Jeff Manber oversaw the first and only commercially funded mission of the Russian space station, which lasted over 70 days. Manber was, and still is, the only American to ever work officially for the Russian space program. As of January 2020, over 800 payloads have been deployed by Nanoracks to the International Space Station.http://www.nanoracks.com As of June 2015, Nanoracks has deployed 64 satellites into low Earth orbit, and had 16 satellites on the ISS awaiting deployment, with an order backlog of 99. In 2012, a quarter of Nanoracks' revenue of over $3 million came from NASA.\\" In August 2012, Nanoracks partnered with Space Florida to host the Space Florida International Space Station (ISS) Research Competition.http://www.spaceflorida.gov/iss-research- competition As part of this program, Nanoracks and DreamUp provide research NanoLab box units to fly payloads to the ISS, with scientific research to be conducted on board the U.S. National Lab.http://www.dreamup.org/all-star- programs/#Space Florida ISS Research Competition In October 2013, Nanoracks became the first company to coordinate the deployment of small satellites from the ISS via the airlock in the Japanese KIBO module. This deployment was done by Nanoracks using the Japanese Experiment Module (JEM) Small Satellite Orbital Deployer (J-SSOD). The Nanoracks CubeSat Deployer was launched on January 9, 2014, on the Orbital Sciences Cygnus Orb-1 Mission. It became the first commercial platform to deploy satellites from the ISS. In December 2014, DreamUp.org, the website for the educational arm of Nanoracks, was launched. DreamUp offers access to commercial research platforms in suborbital and low- Earth orbit. The DreamUp Advisory Board, made up of industry experts Ken Shields and Jeffrey Manber assigns ‚ÄòDreamUp Approved‚Äô status to projects declared realistic, doable, and in accordance with standard safety criteria. Through partnerships with organizations such as SSEP and Valley Christian High School, Nanoracks and DreamUp have helped launch dozens of student experiments to space and immerse hundreds of students in the space research experience. In August 2015, Nanoracks announced a historic agreement to fly a Chinese DNA experiment from the Beijing Institute of Technology on the International Space Station. The agreement includes Nanoracks delivering the experiment to the American side of the ISS in a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft and berthing the experiment to Nanoracks‚Äô orbiting laboratory facilities. Nanoracks will then send data back to the Chinese researchers. In August 2015, the Nanoracks External Payload Platform (NREP) was successfully launched to the ISS on the fifth flight of the Japanese H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV). The external platform will be able to accommodate up to 9 4U CubeSat-size payloads outside of the space station with a standard mission duration of 15 weeks. The platform is operational as of August 2016. In August 2015, Space Angels Network joined with Nanoracks and DreamUp to support and invest in STEM education and early stage-space companies by using the DreamUp Approved system. In December 2015, Nanoracks announced the formal creation of DreamUp, PBC. The goal behind DreamUp, PBC. was to make space research available to university students and researchers in the U.S. as well as a dozen other countries. In May 2016, Nanoracks and NASA signed a Space Act Agreement to develop a private airlock to be added to the International Space Station. In June 2017, Nanoracks and NASA sign a contract via the NextSTEP-2 award that focuses on repurposing spent launch vehicle upper stages. In October 2017, Nanoracks successfully deployed the Kestrel Eye IIM (KE2M) microsatellite via the Company‚Äôs Kaber Microsatellite Deployer from the International Space Station. In December 2018, Nanoracks announces the company has signed its first customer contract for a small satellite rideshare on the India Space Research Organization‚Äôs (ISRO) Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV). In September 2019, Nanoracks announces the opening of its first office in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in Abu Dhabi‚Äôs Hub71.  Facilities and labs = Bishop Airlock Module = The Nanoracks Bishop Airlock Module is a commercially-funded airlock module intended to be launched to the International Space Station on SpaceX CRS-21 in November 2020. The module is being built by NanoRacks, Thales Alenia Space, and Boeing. It will be used to deploy CubeSats, small satellites, and other external payloads for NASA, CASIS, and other commercial and governmental customers. = Nanoracks Space Outpost Program = Nanoracks is currently developing tools to convert space junk into commercial space stations (Outposts), to meet growing in-space customer demand. Outposts based on the Earthly concepts of re-use and recycle. The Outpost fleet will be made from spent upper stages in-orbit and other structures after they have completed their primary mission in space. Nanoracks will convert them into orbiting hubs for use by users all over the world. Nanoracks‚Äô Outposts are intended to be research labs, factories, fuel depots, hotels, and support systems to service missions throughout the Solar System. = Internal ISS Services = Nanoracks facilities on the International Space Station (ISS) include: * Nanoracks Frame-3 accommodates a total of 3 4U payloads (with the dimensions 10 cm x 20 cm x 20 cm) and has advanced features such as an internal computer with its own crew interface facility for easier payload software development. The Frame-3 can also provide up to 50W of power to a payload through a USB or other forms of data connections. *Nanoracks MixStix ‚Äì Nanoracks‚Äô Mixture Enclosure Tubes (Mixstix) hold up to twenty-four mixing sticks. This enclosure allows for microgravity reactions and materials to be captured for analysis on the ISS, or returned to Earth via either the Soyuz or SpaceX's Dragon. The MixStix are activated, and analysis begins, after the mixing stick is cracked open by an ISS crewmember, similar to activating a glow stick. *Nanoracks Microscope-3 ‚Äì The third generation Nanoracks microscope system is a hand-held USB digital microscope with 20-240X magnification that creates 5MP pictures or video. Seven white LEDs provide lighting and the scope has a polarizing filter to reduce glare. Microscope-3 can also be mounted to its XY translation stage for extra stability.

This platform was designed to increase the payload turnover of autonomous payloads while simultaneously providing advanced scientific capabilities to customers, including the use of robotics, new automated MixStix, and NanoLab-style research. The platform itself is the size of a locker and can accommodate payloads up to 18U. Black Box was first utilized on the OA-5 resupply mission. = External ISS Services = Nanoracks deploys small CubeSats into orbit from the ISS through the Nanoracks CubeSat Deployer via the airlock in the Japanese Kibo module, after the satellites are transported to the ISS on a cargo spacecraft. When released, the small satellites are provided a push of about that begins a slow process of satellite separation from the ISS. The Nanoracks CubeSat Deployer(NRCSD) is a self-contained deployment system that mechanically and electrically isolates CubeSats from the ISS, the ISS crew, and cargo resupply vehicles. The design of the NRCSD is compliant with the ISS flight safety requirements and is space qualified. The deployer is composed of anodized aluminum plates, access panels, deployer doors, and a base plate assembly. The inside of the NRCSD is designed to minimize and/or preclude the jamming of CubeSat appendages during deployment. = External Platform (NREP) = JAXA astronaut Takuya Onishi (background) and NASA astronaut Kate Rubins (foreground) prepare the Nanoracks External Platform (NREP) for installation.The Nanoracks External Platform (NREP) was successfully installed in August 2016. The self-funded NREP is the first-ever commercial gateway-and-return to the extreme environment of space. Following the CubeSat form factor, payloads can now experience the microgravity, radiation and other harsh elements native to the space environment, observe earth, test sensors, materials, and electronics, all while having the opportunity to return the payload back to Earth. The Nanoracks Kaber Microsat Deployer is a reusable system that allows the International Space Station to control and command satellite deployments. The Kaber was developed based on Nanoracks‚Äôs experience deploying CubeSats from the ISS. This service enables Nanoracks to deploy microsatellites up to 82 kg into space. Microsatellites that are compatible with the Kaber Deployer have additional power, volume, and communication resources, which allows for deployments of higher scope and sophistication. = External Cygnus Deployer (E-NRCSD) = The satellite deployment service enabled satellites to be deployed at an altitude higher than the ISS via a Commercial Resupply Vehicle. These satellites are deployed after the completion of the primary cargo delivery mission and, soaring 500 kilometers above the Earth and ca. 100 kilometers above the ISS, this service opens the door for the development of new technology, in addition to extending the life of CubeSats already deployed in low-Earth orbit. The Cygnus Deployer holds a total volume of 36U and adds approximately two years to the lifespan of these satellites. E-NRCSD Missions: *The OA-6 mission was launched 23 March 2016 at 3:05:52 UTC. Inside the Cygnus was the Saffire scientific payload. Mounted outside of the Cygnus was a CubeSat deployer by Nanoracks. Both of these systems remained inactive during the Cygnus‚Äô docking at the ISS. After the OA-6 resupply mission was completed, and the Cygnus was unberthed from the station, these two services got the chance to perform unprecedented, weeklong scientific experiments. The Saffire's purpose was to study combustion in microgravity, which was done once Cygnus left the ISS. Likewise, in between the OA-6's initiation and its reentry into Earth's atmosphere, numerous Cubesats were deployed into orbit for the commercial entities that built and operate them. *The OA-5 mission was launched 17 October 2016 at 23:45 UTC. On November 25, 2016, during the OA-5 resupply mission, Nanoracks successfully deployed four Spire LEMUR-2 CubeSats from the Cygnus Cargo Vehicle from a 500-kilometer orbit. ‚ÄúThe External Cygnus Deployment program was developed with the customer in-mind,‚Äù says Nanoracks CTO Mike Lewis. Reusing and repurposing in-space vehicles is a quintessential part of Nanoracks‚Äôs vision. *The OA-7 mission was launched 18 April 2017 at 15:11:26 UTC. On Cygnus‚Äô eighth resupply mission, Nanoracks successfully deployed four Spire LEMUR-2 CubeSats at a nearly 500-kilometer orbit. Since then, Nanoracks has continued to grow its External Deployment program, which is focused on extending the mission of cargo vehicles after Cygnus's deployment from the ISS. This program is a stepping-stone in Nanoracks‚Äô larger goal: the repurposing of in-space vehicles. The OA-7 launch accompanied the Company's largest CubeSat mission to date. During this mission, a total of 38 satellites were released into orbit. *The OA-8 mission was targeting a launch in September, with the OA-9E mission slated for 2018. = PSLV Services = Recently, Nanoracks announced that the company is adding polar orbit launches to their resume. The company plans to work with Berlin-based Astrofein to create and supply the deployers. In addition, Nanoracks is seeking help from the commercial arm of the Indian Space Research Organization, Antrix, for Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) services. Due to recent customer demands for polar orbits, Nanoracks plans on seeing it through. These polar orbit opportunities come in addition to Nanoracks‚Äô numerous deployments of satellites via the Nanoracks CubeSat Deployer (NRCSD) and Kaber Deployer on the ISS as well as the External Nanoracks CubeSat Deployer (E-NRCSD) mounted outside of the Cygnus spacecraft. Nanoracks chose to partner with Astrofein due to their 20 years of experience in aviation and spaceflight and 100 percent success rate. = Mars Demo-1 = Mars Demo-1 (OMD-1) is Nanoracks‚Äô first technology demonstration mission for the Outpost program, flying mid-2021 on a SpaceX Rideshare mission. OMD-1 is a self-contained hosted payload platform that will demonstrate the robotic cutting of second stage representative tank material on-orbit. Nanoracks must prove being able to cut metal without producing any orbital debris. = Commercial Space Stations = Nanoracks, after finalizing its contract with NASA, and after winning NextSTEPs Phase II award, is now developing its concept Independence-1 (previously known as Ixion), which would turn spent rocket tanks into a habitable living area to be tested in space. In Spring 2018, Nanoracks announced that Ixion is now known as the Independence-1, the first 'outpost' in Nanoracks' Space Outpost Program.

He even wrote the epigraph on Puyi's casket. Jia also interviewed over 300 people who had associations with Puyi since the late Qing dynasty, thus making the book's authenticity irreplaceable. The book narrates Puyi's life from his entry into the Forbidden City at the age of three in 1908 to his death in 1967. It tries to avoid repeating the stories already mentioned in Puyi's autobiography From Emperor to Citizen, and instead focuses on disclosing untold stories of Puyi in a multi-layered fashion. The book also contains historic documents of more than 300,000 Chinese characters related to Puyi's life. In addition to old photographs, Jia also publicised many cultural relics about Puyi for the first time in his book. The relics include: Puyi's abdication decree written in the Mongolian language and Chinese issued by the Colonial Affairs Department in 1911; the preferential conditions for the Qing imperial family; the Hongxian porcelain tray customised for Yuan Shikai; letters written by Puyi to farmers and the envelopes; multiple drafts of Puyi's autobiography From Emperor to Citizen; Puyi's original medical records; glasses and glass boxes used by Puyi; mirrors used by Puyi during the Cultural Revolution; notes taken by Jia during interviews.

Impacts on the parent body of a meteoroid can produce very large pressures. These pressures heat, melt and deform the rocks. This is called shock metamorphism. Meteorites are often given a rating from 1 to 6 showing the level of shock metamorphism. However, the degree of shock can vary within a meteorite on the scale of centimeters.Systematics and Evaluation of Meteorite Classification. Authors: Michael K. Weisberg, Timothy J. McCoy, Alexander N. Krot. PDF (page 32) Smaller bodies colliding with one another would not have sufficiently great impact velocity to produce the pressures and temperatures required to produce shock effects, due to their lesser gravitational attraction for one another. High instantaneous pressures, in excess of 5 GPa (1 GPa = 10,000 atmospheres), are necessary to produce shock metamorphism. Shock grade Shocked quartz with two sets of \\"decorated\\" planar deformation features in impact melt rock from the Suvasvesi impact crater. Planar deformation features are only produced by extreme shock compressions on the scale of meteor impacts. They are not found in volcanic environments. Impact-fractured granite (orangish areas - K-feldspar & quartz) with grayish- to blackish-colored impact pseudotachylite (impact melt) vein fillings The fracturing of crystals and other features must be observed under a microscope with shock effects observed under polarized light. Larger structures, such as shock veins, are visible to the eye. Many of the shocked veins formed at the boundaries of polished surfaces of brecciated specimens exhibit intricate spider-web-like structures. Following is a summary of the shock grades:Stoffler, D., Keil, K., and Scott, E. R. D., (1991); Shock metamorphism of ordinary chondrites; Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta, 55, pp. 3845-3867. *S1: completely unshocked (up to 5 GPa) *S2: very weakly shocked (5-10 GPa); uneven darkening of olivine as seen under polarized light; planar and irregular fractures (breaks in other than a natural cleavage plane.) *S3: weakly shocked (15-20 GPa); weak fractures in olivine seen under polarized light; dark shock veins and some melt pockets *S4: moderately shocked; (30-35 GPa); weak planar fracturing of olivine under polarized light; some pockets of melted material, dark interconnected shock veins *S5: strongly shocked (45-55 GPa); very strong planar fracturing and deformation features in olivine; alteration of plagioclase into maskelynite; formation of dark melt veins *S6: very strongly shocked (75-90 GPa); olivine recrystallizes, with local alteration to a mineral called ringwoodite and shock melting of plagioclase to a glass Greater shock pressures will melt the rock, producing what is referred to as an \\"impact melt\\".

He received a commission to serve as a draftsman during the construction of a fortification on Munkholmen, an islet located north of Trondheim. Construction of the fortress began in 1658 and was completed in 1661. From 1668‚Äì1669, he worked for Johan Frederik von Marschalck, commander of Bergenhus Fortress located in the entrance to the harbor in Bergen. After a visit to the Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim approximately 1660, he wrote a poetry book entitled Norwegia religiosa. It contained illustrations of the cathedral, one set from the north, the second of the western front. These later formed the basis for discussions regarding subsequent restoration of the cathedral which was initiated in 1869. In 1676, he was appointed priest in the parish of J√∏lster in Sogn og Fjordane county. He became engaged in May 1678 with Maren Finde, who was his predecessors widow. They were married in June 1678.

BIT works in partnership with governments, local authorities, non-profits, and businesses to tackle major policy problems. Originally set up within the UK Cabinet Office to apply nudge theory within British government, BIT became a social purpose limited company in 2014. Its work now spans across seven offices, having run more than 750 projects in and conducted over 500 randomised controlled trial (RCTs). The Behavioural Insights Team is headed by psychologist David Halpern.  History  BIT was set up in 2010 by the coalition government in a probationary fashion. In April 2013 it was announced that it would be partially privatised as a mutual joint venture. = Privatization = On 5 February 2014 its ownership was split equally between the government, the charity Nesta, and the team's employees, with Nesta providing ¬£1.9 million in financing and services. reported that it was \\"the first time the government has privatised civil servants responsible for policy decisions\\". The Financial Times expected it \\"to be the first of many policy teams to be spun off as part of plans to shrink central government and create a private enterprise culture in Whitehall\\". BIT's objects are stated in its Articles as \\"(i) promote the public good, and (ii) generate the maximum achievable profits available for distribution.\\"Articles, https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/08567792/filing-history UK government departments that had previously received policy advice for free now pay for the service, as the cost of maintaining the team is no longer borne by government.  Methods  Although specific ideas devised by BIT have been imitated in several other countries (see below), David Halpern said in an interview with Apolitical that the unit's underlying methodology has still not been widely understood. He said BIT's 'greatest legacy' would be not any individual behavioural insight, but its commitment to creating a set of variants on any given intervention and testing them against each other. He called the cycle of making variants, testing them, learning what works best and starting again from there \\"radical incrementalism\\".  Projects = Drawing the attention of those who fail to pay Vehicle Excise Duty = BIT implemented a trial that included adding a picture of the offending vehicle in the letters sent to non-payers of Vehicle Excise Duty that led to an increase in payment rates from 40% to 49%.http://www.behaviouralinsights.co.uk/wp- content/uploads/2015/07/BIT-Publication-EAST_FA_WEB.pdf = Using social norms to increase tax payments = BIT tested whether adding a notice that most people pay their taxes on time to the letters sent from HM Revenue and Customs would have effect on the payments made by those receiving the message. Trials increased payment rates significantly. = Increasing fine payment rates through text messages = BIT prompted those owing the UK Courts Service fines with a text message ten days before the bailiffs were to be sent to a person, which doubled payments made without the need for further intervention. This innovation has reportedly saved the Courts Service ¬£30 million a year by \\"sending people owing fines personalised text messages to persuade them to pay promptly\\". = Increasing tax collection rates by changing the default web- link = BIT ran a series of trials with HMRC that sought to improve tax collection rates by making it easier for individuals to pay. One of the simplest interventions involved testing the impact of directing letter recipients straight to the specific form they were required to complete, as opposed to the web page that included the form. This increased response rates by 19 to 23%. = Reducing medical prescription errors = A study by Imperial College London funded by BIT sought to reduce prescription errors by redesigning the prescription forms. To make it easier to distinguish between micrograms and milligrams, distinct options that had to be circled were included. In simulation testing, the new charts were found to significantly improve correct dose entries. = Giving a day's salary to charity = BIT ran a trial with Deutsche Bank to examine how to encourage people to donate part of their salaries to charity. The control group received generic emails and leaflets encouraging people to participate. This approach was tested against a range of new interventions, including offering people sweets branded with a charitable giving message; and making the email more personalized. They were found to be highly effective and cheap ways of increasing uptake and showed an even greater impact when they were combined. = Increasing response rates of doctors by attracting the attention of a specific group = BIT ran a trial with HMRC to test the effectiveness of different letters aimed at encouraging doctors to pay any outstanding tax liabilities. In November 2011, around 3,000 doctors were sent one of four different types of letters. One group received a generic HMRC letter. The second group received letters in the style that HMRC might usually send to a specific group, emphasizing that it was a campaign focused on doctors. The third was a short and simple letter suggesting in direct tone that failure to come forward was previously treated as an oversight, but would now be treated as an active choice by the recipient. The fourth was identical but contained an additional moral message (which pointed out that a recent poll showed that most people trust their doctor to tell the truth). Emphasizing that the letters were targeting a particular group through a specific campaign had a considerable impact, raising response rates by more than five times. Simplifying the message also had a strong effect above and beyond the focus on the specific group. = Using a clear call to action stamp to improve payment rates of fines = BIT ran experimental trials with Australia's New South Wales' Department of Premier and Cabinet and Office of State Revenue to improve payment rates for fines, debts, and taxes. A number of fines trials involved testing the use of a \\"stamp\\" to provide a clear call to action for recipients. One of these trials involved \\"Enforcement Orders\\", which are issued to those people who have failed to respond to a Penalty Notice and Penalty Reminder Notice for fines ranging from traffic and parking infringements to civil disorder offenses. A red \\"Pay Now\\" stamp was printed in a prominent position on letters in the trial group, alongside a number of other changes that made the messaging more salient. In a sample size of 48,445 letters, there was a 3.1 percentage point increase in payment rates in the trial letters compared to the standard notice. When rolled out to scale, this translates to AUD$1.02 million in additional payments for the NSW government, as well as 8,800 fewer vehicle suspensions, which has wider socioeconomic benefits for the community. = Using a lottery to increase electoral participation rates = BIT ran a randomised controlled trial with a local authority to test the efficacy of using lotteries to increase electoral registration rates. There was a 3.3% increase in registration rates when the prize was ¬£1,000, and a 4.2% increase when the prize was ¬£5,000. = Encouraging charitable giving in wills = BIT partnered with Co-operative Legal Services to test whether social norm messages in telephone scripts could be used to encourage people to donate more to charity in their wills. When customers booked a will-writing appointment, they were randomly assigned to a will-writer, who would write their will with them over the phone. The control group of customers was asked if they would like to donate money to charity in their wills, asked the simple question \\"Would you like to leave any money to charity in your will?\\" (we call this the \\"Just Ask\\" condition), or told, \\"Many of our customers like to leave money to charity in their will\\". They were then asked \\"are there any causes you're passionate about?\\" (called the \\"Social Passion Ask\\" condition). In the \\"Just Ask\\" group, 10% of customers chose to leave a gift to charity in their wills. But in the \\"Social Passion Ask\\" group, donation rates rose threefold to 15%, and, unlike the \\"Just Ask\\" group, the average donation doubled. Furthermore, the average size of the donation among people in the \\"Social Passion Ask\\" group was twice as large (¬£6,661) than those in the control (¬£3,300) or \\"Just Ask\\" group (¬£3,110). = Encouraging people to join the organ donor register using reciprocity = In 2013 BIT collaborated with the Department of Health, the National Health Service, the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency, and the Government Digital Service to increase organ donation. When people renew their car tax online, they receive a message asking if they want to join the organ donor register. For one month, eight different messages were introduced to encourage sign up, and visitors were randomly allocated to each. Since over 1 million people visited the site during the month, this represented one of the largest randomised controlled trials in the public sector. The most successful variant asked \\"If you needed an organ transplant, would you have one? If so, please help others'\\", which has been estimated to add around 100,000 extra organ donors per year relative to the control. = Personal commitment devices in Jobcentres = BIT is working with Jobcenters in a trial involving cutting down the process, personalizing job advice and includes the introduction of commitment devices, which require the jobseeker to make commitments to the job advisor about what they are going to do in the next week. They write their commitments down in front of the job advisor, who then follows up whether they were successful. The job seekers are encouraged to make the commitments unambiguous by specifying when and where they are going to perform the action. The early results from the trial has showed a significant increase in those off benefits at 13 weeks. The trial will be published in 2014. = Increasing loft insulation installation = Although loft insulation is essentially a zero- risk proposition, there were very few people installing it. The team discovered that people's lofts were full of junk, and provided low-cost labor to clear them; this caused a fivefold increase in the proportion of installed insulation. In June 2012, they published a policy paper on the use of randomised controlled trials in collaboration with Ben Goldacre. = Benefit Sanctions for Disabled People = Tasked by the Department of Work and Pensions to investigate the effectiveness of \\"sanctioning\\" recipients of disability benefits (punishing them with fines of up to three years ineligibility to benefits for supposed bad attitudes or non-compliance), the nudge unit noted that these methods were ineffective, but rather than recommending they be withdrawn, proposed changes which might make sanctions and benefit conditionality more effective.  International adoption = United States = BIT has expanded to the United States setting up an office in New York. The North American operation is working with cities and their agencies, as well as other partners, across the United States and Canada, running over 25 randomized controlled trials in the first year of operation. The model has been followed in the United States. The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy has a \\"Social and Behavioral Sciences Initiative\\", whose goal is \\"to translate academic research findings into improvements in federal program performance and efficiency using rigorous evaluation methods\\". On 15 September 2015 President Obama issued an Executive Order which formally established the Social and Behavioral Sciences Team and directed government agencies to use insights from the social and behavioral sciences to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their work. = Oceania and Southeast Asia = BIT Australia worked with the New South Wales government, whose Department of Premier and Cabinet boasts a Behavioral Insights unit. In Singapore, BIT works with Singaporean government agencies, including the Ministry of Manpower, Public Services Division of the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office, and Ministry of Home Affairs.

The Tower of Flies was a formidable guard tower/fort at the medieval city-port of Acre, Israel, which overlooked the harbour from a small island and protected the city‚Äôs rich maritime trade. It also served as a lighthouse. Its precise origins are unknown, but it is an ancient structure, most likely built in Phoenician times. It was the Crusaders of Europe that redeveloped the tower to the height of its prowess during a re- fortification of the ancient port after the city‚Äôs capture in the First Crusade. The tower was also attached to a giant harbour chain that was strung across the harbour to prevent the entry of ships. The ruins of the tower are still visible today. Origin of name The tower gets its peculiar name from the Crusaders who first arrived at Acre; believing that they had arrived at the ancient Bible city of Ekron where one of the major deities was Ba'al- zebub, literally meaning the Lord of the Flies. Since the tower already existed and apparently garbage was frequently left at the site, it was named the Tower of Flies. History The ancient watchtower has been a key feature in the city‚Äôs armour against foreign attacks, particularly at sea. Conrad of Montferrat tried to take the city of Acre during the Third Crusade by attacking the Tower of Flies but adverse winds and rocks below the surface prevented his ship getting close enough. The tower was also a key piece in the War of St. Sabas, with the warring maritime Genoese and Venetian factions fighting for its control and by extension, control of the harbour. In 1267, Genoa managed to capture the tower and blockade the harbour for twelve days before the Venetians evicted them. The war was settled three years later. During the times of Jezzar Pesha, the Ottoman ruler of Acre in the late 18th century, a huge chain was used to secure entrance in and out of the harbour. During this era, the tower also had a sinister reputation as a dungeon.

Chakrabarti is a theoretical physicist with interests in soft matter and statistical physics. He has worked on diverse soft matter systems, including liquid mixtures, polymers, liquid crystals, aerosols, colloids, nanoparticles, and most recently, self-assembly of proteins.Amit Chakrabarti's Media Bio: http://www.k-state.edu/media/mediaguide/bios/chakrabartibio.html Biography Chakrabarti was born in Calcutta, India. He earned his Bachelor of Science in physics in 1979 and Master of Science in physics in 1982 from the University of Calcutta, and earned his doctorate in physics from the University of Minnesota in 1987. He was a research associate at Temple University from 1987 to 1988 and at Lehigh University from 1988 to 1989. Chakrabarti joined the physics department at Kansas State University in 1990 and was named a full professor in 2000. He served as interim head of the department of physics from 2006 to 2007. In July 2011, Chakrabarti was named the William and Joan Porter Chair in Physics. Academics and research Chakrabarti's research focuses on how particles in a dispersed phase come together and form aggregates. His individual and collaborative research projects have received extramural funding from agencies such as NASA and the National Science Foundation. He has published more than 150 peer-reviewed papers and mentored nine doctoral students and several postdoctoral fellows. Chakrabarti and co-workers' numerical work in the late 1980s settled a long-standing controversy on the value of domain growth exponent in quenched far from equilibrium systems. He carried out large-scale simulations of conformations of grafted chains that prompted several detailed experiments on this subject. He is a co-author of the first simulation work on how selective surface interactions influence spinodal decomposition in a mixture. This paper led to a flurry of experimental activities and confirmation of his groups' theoretical findings. His work on phase separation in fluids with long-chain molecules explained why different experiments carried out to different time regimes seem to produce contradictory results. His group's large-scale simulation on aggregation kinetics in dense particulate systems explained Christopher Sorensen's research group's experimental observation of speed up in the kinetics of aggregation in a dense system and developed the concept of cluster crowding in aggregating systems. Chakrabarti and Christopher Sorensen, Cortelyou-Rust University Distinguished Professor of physics at Kansas State University, have published a recent invited review that provides a comprehensive description of their research of how a system of particles evolves from a dilute sol to a gel. This paper identifies new regimes of aggregation. His research group has developed a phenomenological model for interactions among ligated gold nanoparticles based on a model of grafted polymer chains. This work successfully explained Christopher Sorensen's research group's experimentally observed values for the superlattice constants for gold nanoparticles decorated with various ligands and the trend in solubility of nanoparticles seen in experiments. Chakrabarti's research group is currently carrying out simulation study of nanoparticle supercluster nucleation. Analysis of a pre- nucleation induction period yielded a supercluster interfacial tensions that compare reasonably well with other theory and Christopher Sorensen's research group's experiments. This work also suggests that the nucleation process for ligated nanoparticles is a two-step process as seen in some protein nucleation studies. In collaboration with James Gunton, professor of physics at Lehigh University,James D. Gunton: http://www.lehigh.edu/~jdg4/ one of Chakrabarti's recent projects focuses on understanding how insulin crystals form from aqueous solutions. . His other recent work is on self-assembly of amelogenin bio-macromolecules. Amelogenin is involved in the mineral deposition and has been postulated to fulfill major structural roles during highly organized ribbonlike carbonated apatite crystal formation in enamel development, which is an unusual case in biomineralization. He also is working on fiber formation in sickle cell hemoglobin, the mutant form of hemoglobin responsible for sickle cell anemia .

Habitat Its natural habitats include fast-flowing streams and rivers in montane and upland settings. Rivers and streams with densely vegetated banks (both grassy and bushy) are preferred. Description A large dragonfly (length 61‚Äì64 mm; wingspan 87‚Äì91 mm). The eyes are green and the face deep yellow to greenish yellow; the upper frons has a central black spot within a yellow ring. The thorax is brown with green stripes, and the abdomen green with brown markings. The wings are slightly smoky with brown and yellow veins and reddish-brown to yellow-brown pterostigmata. Similar species Pinheyschna subpupillata is similar to Zosteraeschna minuscula and Zosteraeschna usambarica, but the latter species have browner abdomens, and long green dorsal stripes on the thorax. The black marking on the upper frons of Zosteraeschna minuscula is shaped like an anchor, and that of Zosteraeschna usambarica like a pentagon, rather than the rounded spot of the stream hawker. Pinheyschna subpupillata males also differ in having secondary gentilia that project conspicuously from the second segment of the abdomen (S2), and lack the blue saddle (also S2) of Zosteraeschna males.

Key Missions and Actions ENAC is the first European Graduate School in the fields of aeronautics and aviation. As of April 2020, it has over 25,000 alumni ENAC Alumni which makes the association the largest in France for aviation programs.  History  The √âcole Nationale de l'Aviation Civile was founded in 1949 in Orly, France. Its initial purpose was to educate the future public workers of the Directorate General for Civil Aviation. At the beginning of the 1970s, the university started the recruitment of students for the aerospace industry, outside of its original pool of future DGAC employees. The number of so-called \\"civilian\\" students steadily grew in the 1980s. Robert Aladenyse (1931-2003, 1964 graduate) decided in 1987 to create a nonprofit organization for the aviation engineers (Dipl√¥me d'ing√©nieur) alumni. This association was then called IngENAC.

History Athertonville had its beginnings in whiskey. Wattie Boone, a relative of Daniel Boone built the first distillery at Knob Creek. Historians agree that Boone was one of the first to be documented producing bourbon in Kentucky in 1776. According to local folklore the father of Abraham Lincoln accepted a job at the Boone Distillery in 1814. J. M. Atherton Company built a distillery in 1867. Its founder was John McDougal Atherton Within less than 10 years, the number of employees at the Athertonville distillery surpassed 200, making it the largest employer in LaRue County. Other business enterprises followed after a rail spur was constructed. A general store and The Atherton Hotel, made Athertonville a boom town. To support the needs of its inhabitants, churches, a courthouse, a post office and a school were built. Soon after, the town was named in his honor. Whiskey production in Athertonville (1867‚Äì1972) John McDougal Atherton‚Äôs (1841‚Äì1932), two distilleries in Athertonville were Mayfield and Atherton, and were located on opposite sides of Knob Creek, a short distance from Knob Creek Farm, the birthplace of Abraham Lincoln. His son Peter Lee Atherton (1862‚Äì1939) entered the family business. In 1882 he relocated J. M. Atherton Company headquarters to Whiskey Row, Louisville on 125 W Main St. but the distillery in Athertonville continued to be owned by them until 1899. Production stopped during prohibiting however resumed in 1933. It was sold to Seagram in 1946. The Athertonville distillery made whiskey to support the Seagram‚Äôs portfolio of blended whiskeys. The core of the facility was destroyed by a fire on February 19, 1972 and put over 50 employees out of work. This story was covered in depth in the Kentucky Standard on February 24, 1972. A fire had broken out in the still house about 03:40 a.m. Fire crew fought the blaze for four hours, containing the fire within the brick walls. The power house, fermenting room and evaporator escaped damage and did not spread to the three warehouses where the whiskey was stored. All distillery operations ceased in Athertonville after this date. Athertonville today The community is part of LaRue which voted to be a dry county in 1937.

Allied forces from Duala occupied the town following the First Battle of Edea in October 1914. The Germans, eager to retake the position attacked on 5 January 1915 but were repulsed by the French force. Background The village of Edea was positioned on the Sanaga River, to the southeast of the major port city of Duala. A large portion of the German Duala garrison had withdrawn to this position following the Allied naval bombardment of the city. Following the Allied assaults on the Yapoma Bridge and Edea at the First Battle of Edea, the German force withdrew to the city of Jaunde further to the east along the southern railway line. This allowed Allied forces to occupy Edea unopposed on 26 October 1914.Burg 1998, p. 31. After the fall of Edea, the only remaining German force that could threaten General Dobell's hold on Duala was at the fort in Dschang to the north. On 2 January 1915 a British force under Colonel Edmund Georges captured the fort after a short bombardment.Strachan 2004, p. 36. Battle=Attack on Kopongo= The loss of Dschang prompted a German counter-attack in an attempt to retake Duala. On 3 January, telegraph cables between Duala and Edea were cut by German forces to impede communications between Allied units. The French Senegalese force of Colonel Mayer that had taken the Japoma bridge had constructed a ring of defenses around their forward position at Kopongo, approximately 20 miles further inland from Edea. On 5 January, a German column of 150 attacked the French positions at Kopongo but were pushed back suffering significant casualties. =Attack on Edea= The German assault on Edea was conducted simultaneously to that on Kopongo. The French troops defending Edea had constructed a number of entrenchments and fortifications surrounding the town in preparation for the German attack. A force of around 1, 000 German troops assaulted Colonel Mayer's positions on 5 January.Burg 1998, p. 43. A number of infantry assaults against the French positions were carried out but each failed. After suffering up to 111 killed and a similar number wounded the German force withdrew back to Jaunde. Mayer's force reportedly suffered 4 killed and 11 wounded. Aftermath The result of the Second Battle of Edea was the successful Allied defense of the region surrounding Duala. It consolidated Allied control in the region and allowed for further pushes to the east towards the German base at Jaunde. However, Dobell requested more reinforcements before he could make an assault on Jaunde because he felt that his force was spread too thin.O'Neill 1918. p. 53. Following their defeat, German forces launched an attack on British positions at Nkongsamba which failed. The German attempt to contain Dobell's forces was defeated forcing Zimmerman, the German commandant in Kamerun, to once again go on the defensive. NotesReferences *Burg, David F., and L. Edward.

The only known portrait, presumably after the war.From The frontispiece to the second Spanish edition of his book, vol I, Talleres Gr√°ficos de L.J. Rosso y C√≠a, Buenos Aires, 1910. Teniente-Coronel George Thompson (1839-1876) was an English engineer, and was in charge of the Paraguayan military engineering in the Paraguayan War. He was the author of an important source on its history. Because of his efforts and the valour of the ordinary Paraguayans, the Allies (the Brazilian Empire, Argentina and Uruguay) found it much harder to defeat Paraguay than they had imagined. Early life Thompson was born at Greenwich on 26 March 1839. In 1849 he was sent to a school near Stuttgart, which he left in 1852, continuing his studies near London until 1854. From 1855 to 1857 he served an apprenticeship at the government works at Malta, and was put on the engineering staff of the gasworks in that island. He returned to England in 1857, and soon afterwards was engaged for one year as a draughtsman at a locomotive works. That was the total sum of his engineering experience when he left for South America in 1858, aged 19. Paraguay In the middle of the nineteenth century the government of Carlos Antonio L√≥pez determined to open up Paraguay to modern technology, hiring for that purpose a considerable number of technicians, mainly British. In September 1858 Thompson joined the staff of the Asunci√≥n and Villa Rica railway in Paraguay, working under the British engineers George Paddison, Burrell and Valpy. Although a young man, he was soon considered to be one of the best Guaran√≠ scholars amongst the English, besides speaking fluently five or six other languages. The Paraguayan War Profile of the trench at Curupayty, designed by Thompson. (Sketch by George Thompson.) The war between Paraguay and the allied forces of Brazil and the Argentine and Uruguayan Republics having broken out, Thompson, in 1865, offered his services as a military engineer to the Paraguayan President, Francisco Solano L√≥pez, and this offer being accepted, he joined the army in June of that year, and took a prominent part in the war until the end of 1868. At the war's outbreak Thompson was a railway engineer and he had no military experience at all. Furthermore, throughout the war, Paraguay's nominal chief military engineer, Hungarian colonel Wisner de Morgenstern (who had designed the Fortress of Humait√°) was seriously ill, and so the work fell on Thompson's shoulders. Thus it was that an untried 26-year-old man became the de facto chief military engineer of the Paraguayan army: The simple and effective chain boom at Fort√≠n designed by Thompson. Made of timb√≥ logs joined end-to-end by iron shackles, it floated underwater so it could not be sunk by naval gunfire. (Thompson, 353 and Plate V.)Improvising, he used the material and human resources of the country and made earthworks, fortifications and artillery emplacements. His most notable works were the fortifications of Angostura and the trenches ‚Äì constructed, surreptitiously, overnight, in daring proximity to the Allies' positions ‚Äì of the Boquer√≥n del Sauce and Curupaity; Angostura held at bay the Allies‚Äô fleet for several weeks, and the Curupaity trenches led to the Allies‚Äô worst defeat of the war. Thompson was promoted to the rank of lieutenant- colonel in the Paraguayan army, and received from President Lopez the decoration of ‚Äò‚ÄôCaballero del √≥rden del m√©rito‚Äô‚Äô (Knight of the Order of Merit). Although obliged to capitulate at Angostura, the allies allowed him the honours of war, as he refused to surrender at discretion. Angostura battery: The two officers, one calculating the elevation and the other watching, are the commander Lucas Carrillo and George Thompson. By the Argentine general and watercolourist Jos√© Ignacio Garmend√≠a (1841-1925). After the war A few months were passed in England in 1869, during which he wrote The War in Paraguay: With a Historical Sketch of the Country and Its People and Notes Upon the Military Engineering of the War. Since Thompson had been the foreigner with best access to President L√≥pez ‚Äì from whom he took his orders in Guaran√≠Thompson, 327. ‚Äì and privy to many military matters, the book is an important source on the history of the war. Thompson then returned to South America and married a Paraguayan woman by whom he had three children. After some topographical work in C√≥rdoba, Argentina In 1870 he returned to Paraguay and became the Engineer and Manager of the Asunci√≥n ‚Äì Villa Rica railway. He died in Asunci√≥n in March 1876, aged 37. NotesReferences  * (Note: Not all bound copies of this important source book have a complete set of maps.

Created in under a month, Juniper's Knot revolves around a lost boy and an imprisoned demoness, as they help overcome each other's obstacles through wit and memory, respectively. Story The main characters of Juniper's Knot In the world of Juniper's Knot, fiends (demons) unconsciously drain the life of those around them to keep themselves alive; this results in a barren, run-down town that surrounds the manor in which the fiend is trapped. The manner of dress, and details about the daily life of the boy would hint that the story is set around the Industrial Revolution. The boy was born and raised in the area of Moor, a fictional industrial town. The fiend finds that he smells of black oil, horses, and herbs; he explains that this is because he worked with his parents as a farmer, and as an oil delivery boy inside the city. The fiend was born many centuries ago in a moor. She has committed many different deeds and atrocities for mankind, including: destroying a whole village, saving a baby, causing a divorce, etc.; however, she states that none of these are the reasons as to why she has been trapped in the magic circle, as it no longer matters. Despite her considerable age, the fiend appears as a young adult. She harbors feelings of resentment towards humanity at whole, as her best friend, \\"a 'miss'\\", was beaten and raped by men; the fiend buried her friend before returning to massacre the entire town. =Plot= The novel begins with a centuries-old fiend as she thinks about her current situation, stuck in a weathered, run-down ballroom with nothing but fire and rubble at her side. Soon after, a lost boy enters the room, and sees the fiend. The fiend starts talking to the boy as well as teasing him for her amusement, much to the wary boy's chagrin. Insisting on making him tell her a story, the fiend gets the boy to tell her a story about the trickery of demons; after which the boy decides to leave, but before the boy leaves, the fiend sticks out her hand, begging him not to. As she does, her hand passes the magical boundary, causing it to burst into flame. Healing from the injury, the fiend's actions make the boy curious enough to stay and listen to the fiend. When the fiend offers to cook some nuts for the boy, he accepts, accidentally making a pact with her. As the nuts cook over the fire, the boy and fiend share stories about their past. Afterwards, the boy eats the cooked nuts; is offered to be cooked the rest of the nuts, and makes another pact with the fiend, this time to stay until sunset; as Boy and Fiend continue talking, the boy falls asleep while hearing part of the fiend's story due to his tiredness, causing the fiend to go into a fit of rage. Furious that she has not been able to sleep, nor rest for the centuries that she has been stuck in the manor, the fiend starts to cry, curse, and throw the recently cooked nuts at the boy, hitting him a few times as he sleeps. Some time after the boy fell asleep, he wakes up to find a few of his nuts tangled in his hair. The fiend tries to make him leave, but the boy decides to free the fiend from her constrains by planting an olive tree in her place, as the rule of the magical circle is that one life-form enters the circle and another one leaves. In the epilogue, both Fiend and Boy walk away from the ruins to find a way to Moor. The fiend comments on how she feels \\"tired\\"; but also that she now has reason to \\"stay awake for a little longer.\\" Development=Symbolism= The title of Juniper's Knot was chosen for its symbolic nature; for example, \\"Juniper\\" is an allusion to both the saint known for his patience, and the given name that symbolises chastity. \\"Knot\\" represents the fiend's magical barrier, a circle which imprisons her from the rest of the world. The resulting title ‚Äî \\"Juniper's Knot\\" ‚Äî foreshadows the story without being direct. The writer of the story, Terrence Smith, compares \\"Juniper's Knot\\" as a forced chastity that will take a long time to end; although, he says that the meaning is also open to interpretation. =Soundtrack=Reception Juniper's Knot received generally positive reviews for its story and visuals. IndieGames.com weblogger Cassandra Khaw did the same, praising Juniper's Knot for \\"being an oddly lovely experience\\", with an original story and \\"an abundance of ‚Ä¶ anime- inspired artwork\\". International ‚Äì especially German ‚Äì reception was also generally positive, although critical of the lack of choices presented in the game.

IPO and stock price  Independent Board Member James Hare (James Otis Hare II) oversaw the public launch on April 4, 2014. eDreams offered its stock at 10.25 Euros per share. That stock price fell to 1.02 Euros by October 24 of 2014, wiping out over one billion Euros of market capitalization. Some commentators called the launch ‚ÄúEurope‚Äôs worst performing IPO of 2014‚Äù. eDreams moved quickly, asking their shareholders for authorization to ‚ÄúDischarge to Mr. James Otis Hare for the exercise of his mandate as director of the Company until his resignation as of 25 March, 2015.‚Äù http://www.edreamsodigeo.com/wp- content/uploads/sites/19/2014/08/eDreams_ODIGEO-Voting_formAGM_2015.pdf eDreams issued the following announcement: ‚ÄúEffective March 25, 2015, eDreams ODIGEO (‚Äúthe Company‚Äù) accepts the resignation of Mr. James Hare as an Independent member from the Board of Directors‚Äù. http://www.edreamsodigeo.com/wp- content/uploads/sites/19/2014/08/Annual_Corporate_Governance_Report_31March2015.pdf In June 2015, CEO Dana Dunne introduced a new strategy focusing on mobile, revenue diversification and customer experience improvements, which led to a strong turnaround in business performance. Dunne's new strategy caused that stock price to rise above 3 euros by January 2017. Mr. Hare says the above version is incorrect and says the below is correct. EDreams offered its stock at 10.25 Euros per share on April 2014. eDreams remains to date the only Spanish Internet Startup to have succeeded at launching an IPO. That stock price had fallen to 3.00 euros in the Summer of 2014 , reaching briefly 1.02 Euros by October 24 of 2014, and stabilitzing around 3.00 euros since. The President of the Spanish Market Regulator CNMV saw the IPO of eDreams, the first one in the Spanish market for 4 years, as a sign of confidence in the economy after a very long crisis.

In June 2015, CEO Dana Dunne introduced a new strategy focusing on mobile, revenue diversification and customer experience improvements, which led to a continued improvement in business performance. The stock price rose above 3 euros by January 2017. The above version of events has been disputed by Mr. Hare himself. He states that the following is a correct interpretation of the events: The Board of the Company, composed of Lise Fauconnier and Philippe Poletti, representing Ardian with Carlos Mallo, and Benoit Vauchy representing Permira, and Javier Perez-Tenessa and Mauricio Prieto, Founders, oversaw the public launch on April 4, 2014. On the executive team, CEO Javier P√©rez-Tenessa and CFO David Elizaga led the IPO process, while COO Dana Dunne took care of day to day business (all seen in this picture on the day of the IPO). In preparation for the company's stock market listing of April 2014, eDreams expanded its board of non-Executive Directors to include James Hare (eDreams co-founder retired since 2010), Philip Wolf (retired Chairman of PhoCusWright) and Robert Gray (Executive Director and CFO of UBM).eDreams ODIGEO Board of Directors eDreams shares initially listed at ‚Ç¨10.25 valuing the company at over $1.5 billion, making it the first company in 3 years to IPO in Spain as the country emerged from financial recession.Spain's eDreams Odigeo valued at $1.5 bln in IPO However, after 5 months the stock price had fallen by 60%, reflecting the shared challenges of a difficult European IPO market: \\"Dozens of other European IPOs have stumbled this year, as European markets continue to struggle to recover from the 2008 financial crisis.\\" A year after the IPO, Mr. Perez-Tenessa, Mr Hare and Mr. Prieto resigned from the Board and from executive duties. Mr. Dunne was promoted to CEO. eDreams asked its shareholders for authorization to ‚ÄúDischarge to Mr. James Otis Hare for the exercise of his mandate as director of the Company until his resignation as of 25 March, 2015.‚Äù, as is customarily done with any director leaving office. eDreams issued the following announcement: ‚ÄúEffective March 25, 2015, eDreams ODIGEO (‚Äúthe Company‚Äù) accepts the resignation of Mr. James Hare as an Independent member from the Board of Directors‚Äù. In June 2015, CEO Dana Dunne introduced a new strategy focusing even more on mobile, revenue diversification and customer experience improvements, which led to continued improvement in business performance. After implementation of Dunne's strategy, and the announcement in November 2017 that the company was seeking potential buyers, the stock rose to 5 euros by March 2018. After 4 months of review, no adequate offers were received which led the stock to go back to 4 euros levels and is again at 3 euro levels.

It is his third novel. Background On August 15, 2011, The New York Observer reported that Lin had sold his third novel, then titled Taipei, Taiwan, to Vintage. Lin's agent, Bill Clegg, brokered the deal with editor Tim O'Connell based on \\"a 5000-word excerpt and a ~3-page outline\\", for \\"$50,000 with a $10,000 bonus if it earns out its advance.\\" Lin reportedly chose Vintage after meeting with four other editors, including those at Little, Brown and Harper Perennial. Earlier that morning the Wall Street Journal broke the news and briefly interviewed Lin on his decision. Lin said, \\"Vintage/Knopf publishes most of my favorite writers: Lorrie Moore, Ann Beattie, Bret Easton Ellis.\\" Cover On February 1, 2013, Entertainment Weekly debuted the cover. The article also included an interview with Lin, who said, of the autobiographical nature of the book: > Writing autobiographically is more difficult because I'm editing a massive > first draft of maybe 25,000 pages‚Äîmy memory‚Äîinto a 250-page novel.

Early Response On February 25 Publishers Weekly, in a starred review, predicted Taipei would be Lin's \\"breakout\\" book, calling it \\"a novel about disaffection that's oddly affecting\\" and noting that \\"for all its emotional reality, Taipei is a book without an ounce of self-pity, melodrama, or posturing.\\" Bret Easton Ellis tweeted praise for the novel soon after its release. Frederick Barthelme also voiced praise for the novel: > Tao Lin has made a distinctive career out of sticking to his guns, his guns > being the ultra-high-res self-consciousness that characterizes our lives but > which we routinely ignore in our lives and in our art. In Taipei he is a > constant microscope, examining a world of miniature gestures, tiny facial > movements, hands in motion, shrugs, nods, twists, ticks, flicks and snaps, a > world in which the barrage of information we take in moment by moment is > simultaneously cataloged, interpreted, cross-referenced, recorded, and > filed. On March 14 the New York Observer included Taipei in its \\"Spring Arts Preview: Top Ten Books\\", calling Lin \\"an excellent writer of avant-garde fiction\\" and Taipei \\"his most mature work [...] Mr. Lin has refined his deadpan prose style here into an icy, cynical, but ultimately thrilling and unique literary voice.\\" Release Taipei was published on June 4. Early reviews were positive, including those from New York Observer, Elle, The Globe And Mail, and Slate. Mixed reviews included those from New York Times and National Public Radio, both of whose reviewers seemed to both \\"love and hate\\", as Dwight Garner said in his New York Times review, Lin's book. In The Daily Beast critic Emily Witt reviewed the book very positively: > Taipei is exactly the kind of book I hoped Tao Lin would one day write. He > is one of the few fiction writers around who engages with contemporary life, > rather than treating his writing online as existing in opposition to or > apart from the hallowed analog space of the novel. He's consistently good > for a few laughs and writes in a singular style already much imitated by his > many sycophants on the Internet. Some people like Tao Lin for solely these > reasons, or treat him as a sort of novelty or joke. But Lin can also produce > the feelings of existential wonder that all good novelists provoke. His > writing reveals the hyperbole in conversational language that we use, it > seems, to make up for living lives where equanimity and well-adjustment are > the most valued attributes, where human emotions are pathologized into > illness: we do not fall in love, we become \\"obsessed\\"; we do not dislike, we > \\"hate\\". We manipulate ourselves chemically to avoid acting \\"crazy.\\" Clancy Martin, reviewing for New York Times Book Review, said: > Here we have a serious, first-rate novelist putting all his skills to work. > Taipei is a love story, and although it's Lin's third novel it's also, in a > sense, a classic first novel: it's semi-autobiographical (Lin has described > it as the distillation of 25,000 pages of memory) and it's a bildungsroman, > a coming-of-age story about a young man who learns, through love, that life > is larger than he thought it was.

After the failure of the First Battle of Jaunde during the summer of 1915, the bulk of Allied forces had retreated to the Kele river. Following the Second Duala Conference where Allied commanders discussed the situation, it was decided that another assault should be attempted. Although the columns surrounding Jaunde were not in effective communication with one another, on 1 January 1916, British forces under Colonel Georges occupied the capital. By this time it had been abandoned by the German troops who had fled to the neutral Spanish colony of R√≠o Muni. This Allied victory signaled the end of German resistance in Kamerun apart from the Siege of Mora which would continue for another few months. NotesReferences * Burg, David F., and L. Edward.

Rudolf Moroder- Len√®rt in 1905 Life Rudolph was the son of Franz Moroder-Len√®rt, a leading politician of the region, and of Marianna Moroder-Lusenberg, the sister of the noted sculptor Josef Moroder-Lusenberg. During a period of military service in the Austro-Hungarian Army in Vienna, he recognized that his true interest was in being an artist. He began his training in the craft under Anton Runggaldier (known as \\"Tone da Passua\\") and then became an assistant in the studio of Franz Tavella. In 1902 Moroder opened his own studio in Len√®rt House, home of the firm, Moroder Brothers, where his brother-in-law, Ludwig Moroder, also worked. His own works ranged across a number of religious themes, and were mostly created for the various churches and cathedrals of the Grand Duchy of Baden and the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg. He created a famous set of the Stations of the Cross for the Church of St. Ann in Silesia. Moroder re-entered military service when World War I broke out. Stationed at a base in Radlow in Austrian Galicia, he was there when the position was overrun by enemy forces. He, along with many of his comrades, was bayonetted to death, dying at the age of 37. His body was buried there. Works Moroder decided to submit a work to an art exhibit at the World's Fair of 1900, to be held in Paris. He chose his wooden sculpture of St. Elizabeth of Hungary with a Beggar, which he had sculpted in 1898 at the age of 21, based on a design by Christian Delago. He won the Gold Medal in the exhibition for this piece. The work is now in the Rosary Chapel of the parish church of Urtij√´i, known for the large number of significant works of art from that period created by the large, local artistic community of the region. Another of Moroder's pieces, a large, wooden sculpture of Saint Peter, stands in the sanctuary of the church, next to the main altar.

The site includes human remains, stone tools, and early cultural artifacts made during the Upper Paleolithic, between approximately 47,000 and 17,000 years ago. Site overview The stratigraphic sequence at the site includes remains from the Upper Paleolithic, particularly from the Aurignacian (47,000 to 27,000 BP), the Gravettian (32,000 to 22,000 BP), and lastly from the Solutrean (22,000 to 17,000 BP). Remains include human bones, tools, and cave paintings. American archaeologist Hallam L. Movius, who directed early excavations at l'Abri Pataud. The French government classified the site as an historical monument by decree on 25 June 1930, and additional shelters located nearby under the cliff further protected as of May 9, 1958. The site became the property of the museum of natural history in 1957 at the initiative of Hallam L. Movius, who had directed excavations since 1953. Movius continued to direct investigations between 1958 and 1964, aided by a team from the museum. The results of the excavations were compiled by Harvey M. Bricker, on the basis of American hypotheses regarding the site's origins. A finer reading of the stratigraphy of the site may not have been published; continuing work will help elucidate the evolution of stone tool use at the shelters themselves, and their relationship to other sites in the region. The Venus of l'Abri Pataud Venus of Abri Pataud, carved 21,000 years ago. In 1958, a small carved female figure was found on a stone about tall, likely dating to approximately 21,000 years BP. According to Hallum Movius, the figure represents a comparatively young woman, \\"more slender and gracile than is normally the case,\\" roughly carved, and with contours suggesting pregnancy. Movius wrote that the despite \\"disharmonic features, the overall proportions of the figure are both pleasing and, at first glance, symmetrical.\\" Movius continued, \\"from a stylistic point of view, this figure has been rendered in the finest tradition of Upper Paleolithic art as represented by the well-known series of carvings and statuettes, collectively known as Venuses‚Ä¶\\" The figure was found following a violent storm, making its origin within the shelter difficult to know exactly. Public access Since 1990 the site has allowed visitors from the public. Under the direction of Henry de Lumley, assisted by Brigitte Delluc, a museum was established allowing partial views of excavations. See also * Upper Paleolithic * Hallam L.

History  Libon was launched in beta for testing in November 2009 before the LeWeb conference. The first version of the app was called \\"ON Address Book\\", and was only available on Android. The current name is an abbreviation of the original name \\"Life is Better ON\\". All versions of the app have included \\"ON\\" or \\"Libon\\" in their names. In March 2011, Orange launched \\"ON Voicefeed\\" at the DEMO conference, a visual voicemail iOS app enabling its users to personalize their voicemail greetings by recording them or typing them. On 21 November 2012, Orange added a VoIP feature, updated the app's user interface and officially rebranded the app to \\"Libon\\". The app could be used by any iPhone user for free, although features like voicemail transcripts and email copies were charged for in a freemium model. The Android version was released in the first quarter of 2013. The new service was announced by St√©phane Richard at Orange's \\"Show Hello!\\" conference. In March 2015, the \\"Reach Me\\" feature was added to the app, allowing calls to be received over Wi-Fi, a competitor to the Wi-Fi calling feature utilised by other carriers. On 30 June 2016, Orange removed features that did not focus on the VoIP Out functionality.  Reception  CNET gave the application a positive review, praising its unlimited free calls to other users of the app and call quality, although they derided its subscription service.

It is derived from both a Galician and Portuguese word meaning oak,https://translate.google.com/#en/pt/Oak referring to the family's settlement's surroundings of forest on mountainous terrain in A Coru√±a, Galicia, the north western part of Spain. Over the years, the surname has become more frequent in other countries and the name has had variations in its spelling. It became widely renowned in the early 1600s in the Spanish colonization of the Americas or New Spain and greatly expanded during the 1800s. It spread from South America, Central America, Mexico and North America, also including the Philippine islands, Cuba and Puerto Rico, territories of Spanish Colonialism or colonial expansion under the Crown of Castile during Spanish holdings in the Age of Discovery. Origin of name Carballo has many variations in its spelling including Carvallo, Carbello, Caballero, Carvalho, Carbalho, Caraballo, Carbajo, Carvajal, Caballer, Cabral, Caballe, Carballino, Caballer√≠a, de Caballos, Caballo, Cavall√≥n, Cavallero, Cabrillo and Carbralo, and partly due to illiteracy in early times. Surnames like Carballo transform in their pronunciation and spelling as they travel across villages, family branches and countries. In times when literacy was uncommon, names such as Carballo were written down based on their pronunciation when people's names were written in government records. This could have led to misspellings of Carballo. Researching the misspellings and alternate spellings of the Carballo last name are vital to understanding the possible origins of the name. Some of the first spelling variations for the origins of old name Carballo were found in the County of Castile in medieval Spain. While the patronymic and metronymic surnames, which are derived from the name of the father and mother respectively, are the most common form of a hereditary surname in Spain, occupational surnames are also emerged during the late Middle Ages.

One of the sons of Fernao, Gil Fernandes de Carvalho, was made a nobleman in Spain as part of the Order of the Caballeros de Santiago. The coat of arms of the Carvalho family is described as follows: \\"Three ostrich feathers on top of the navy blue shield. On the navy blue shield, there is one bright golden eight point star surrounded by eight white crescent moons.\\" Another important ancestor is Sebasti√£o Jos√© de Carvalho e Mello, Marqu√™s de Pombal (1699-1782), a Portuguese statesman, who was the virtual ruler of the country during the reign (1750‚Äì77) of Joseph Emanuel. Sebasti√£o was born in Lisbon on May 13, 1699, and educated at the University of Coimbra. In 1738, he was appointed Ambassador to London and seven years later was sent to Vienna in a similar capacity. In 1750, Joseph I of Portugal appointed him minister of state and he soon proved his administrative talents. When the devastating 1755 Lisbon earthquake struck, he organized the relief efforts and planned its rebuilding. He was made Chief Minister in 1756, and from then on his powers were practically absolute. Sebasti√£o abolished slavery in Portugal, reorganized the educational system and published a new code of laws. He effected the reorganization of the army, the introduction of new colonists into the Portuguese settlements, and the establishment of an East India Company and other companies for trade with Brazil. Agriculture, commerce and finances were all improved. The king made him a marquis in 1770. Sebasti√£o's power ended with the death of the king and he retired to Pombal, Para√≠ba, where he died on May 8, 1782. Carvallo The Carvallo name is the Lusitan form of the Galician name Carballo.Its origin is derived from the name of the place where one lived or the property owner was from and the founder of the lineage. Carvallo was taken directly from \\"Carballo\\", which was a place in the province of Lugo in Galicia. Hence, someone from that province was someone from Carballo. Carballo comes from the Portuguese word carvalho, which means oak. Therefore, this name means the place where the oaks come from. In Portugal, Carvalho is also the name of a province in the district of Pe acova, within the Carvalho Mountains. In Spain, during the Reconquista, the name Carballo was extended from Galicia to the Iberian Peninsula and to the Canary Islands. The spelling of the name Carvallo, with a \\"v\\", dates its origins back to Viscaya or the Biscay. During most recent findings, several members of this lineage sailed for the New World in the latter 19th century, arriving in countries like Chile, Argentina, Mexico, United States and Venezuela. The lineage that established itself in Venezuela built roots in Caracas and Valencia. Most of the members of this lineage became businessmen, lawyers, politicians and economists. On the branch that settled itself in Valencia, six members have been governors of the city and its state over the last 100 years  Sports players  * Diego de Souza Carballo, Uruguayan soccer player. * Manuel Carballo, (1982) Spanish artistic gymnast * Marcelo Carballo, Bolivian football defender * Miguel √Ångel Carballo, Argentine professional golfer * Ramiro Carballo, Salvadoran professional footballplayer * Carlos Velasco Carballo, (1971) Spanish professional football referee * Jesus Carballo, Spanish gymnast, 1996 and 2004 Summer Olympics * N√©stor Carballo, Uruguayan football defender in the 1954 FIFA World Cup * Ramiro Carballo, (1978) Salvadoran professional soccer player. * Marcelo Carballo,(1974) Bolivian football defender * H√©ctor Federico Carballo, (1980) Argentine soccer player. * Ezequiel Carballo, (1989) Argentine soccer player. * Hugo Carballo, (1944) Chilean soccer player. * Ignacio Pedro Moreno Carballo, (1951) football player for Spain‚Äôs La Liga * Leandro Carballo, baseball pitcher, 1987 California Angels.https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=carbal001lea * Andy Carballo, baseball pitcher, 2007 Metropolitanos de La Habanahttps://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=carbal000and * Michael Victor Carballo, baseball outfielder - 2013 Great Falls Voyagershttps://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/team.cgi?id=a80e1cb5 \\\\- https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=carbal000mic * Gary Carballo, baseball player, third basemen - Baseball City Royals, 1992http://www.tradingcarddb.com/ViewCard.cfm/sid/8459/cid/89126?PageIndex=1http://www.tradingcarddb.com/Person.cfm/pid/20172/Gary- Carballo * Jose Carballo, (1994) first base/catcher- Bethune-Cookman Wildcats * Enrique Carballo,(1980) baseball pitcher, 1998 AZL M√©xico Starshttps://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=carbal001enr * Julio Carballo, (1968) baseball shortstop, 1990 Northwest Leaguehttps://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=carbal001jul * Pablo Juan Carballo, (1958) baseball 1st/3rd baseman/outfielder,1978 New York- Pennsylvania Leaguehttps://www.baseball- reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=carbal001pab * Valeria Carballo, open race car driver, Venezuelan, EuroFormula 2011http://www.euroformulaopen.net/drivers.php?cat=5&cont;=24 * Carvalho Leite (1912-2004), Brazilian soccer player. * Ricardo Carvalho (1978), Portuguese soccer player.

After graduating from the Tambov State Pedagogical Institute he began his studies at Voronezh State University under the supervision of S.G Krein. He completed his postgraduate studies in 1962, and in 1968 he received his Doctor of Science Degree, the highest scientific degree awarded in the Soviet Union. In 1970 he joined the faculty of the computational mathematics department at Kyiv State University. Yuri Petunin is highly regarded for his results in functional analysis. He developed the theory of Scales in Banach spaces,S G Krein and Yu I Petunin, Scales of Banach spaces, 1966 Russ. Math. Surv. 21, 85‚Äì129 the theory of characteristics of linear manifolds in conjugate Banach spaces,Yu. I. Petunin and A. N. Plichko, The Theory of the Characteristics of Subspaces and Its Applications [in Russian], Vishcha Shkola, Kyiv (1980) and with S.G. Krein and E.M.

Semenov, Interpolation of linear operators, Providence, R.I. : American Mathematical Society, 1982. vii, 375 p., He solved Banach's problem of norming subspaces in conjugate Banach spaces as well as a problem posted by Calder√≥n and Lions concerning interpolation in factor spaces. In addition to his work in functional analysis, Professor Petunin made significant contributions to pattern recognition and mathematical statistics. He also worked on developing differential diagnostics for oncological disease.R.I. Andrushkiw, N.V. Boroday, D.A. Klyushin, Yu.I. Petunin. Computer- aided cytogenetic method of cancer diagnosis. ‚Äî New York: Nova Publishers, 2007. The Vysochanskij‚ÄìPetunin inequality that bears his name formally justifies the so-called 3-sigma rule for unimodal distributions, a rule that has been broadly used in statistics since the time of Gauss. In the area of pattern recognition he developed a theory of linear discriminant rules where he investigated the problems of linear separability of any number of sets in n-dimensional space.Yu. I. Petunin and G.A Shuldeshov, The theory of linear discriminant functions I,II, Cybernetics (Russian) no1,2, pp. 34‚Äì44, 31‚Äì35, 1981.

In this capacity she was used in offshore rescue duties. She was one of 70 such vessels transferred to the coastguard to cope with the problem of large numbers of aviation accidents as troops and personnel were returned to the United States after the war, in Operation Magic Carpet. The shortage of experienced pilots as enlisted men were discharged caused the number of accidents to rise. Manpower shortages also affected the Coastguard, which at times struggled to crew the rescue vessels.

The passive damping tools can be divided into constrained layer damping tools and tuned mass dampers. The tuned mass dampers transmit the vibration energy to an extra unit on the structure and maintain the unit under focus to be stable. One typical example is the SilentTools provided by Sandvik Coromant AB in Sweden. The technology is developed by researchers in Norway.

Next to Anna Cora Mowatt Ritchie, she was the most successful female dramatist of early American theatre. Early life Barnes was born in Massachusetts,\\"Charlotte Mary Sanford Barnes.\\" Dictionary of American Biography. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1936. Biography In Context. Web. 18 Feb. 2013. the daughter of actors John Barnes (1761‚Äì1841), a popular comedian, and Mary Greenhill Barnes (1780?-1864), a distinguished tragic actress. She made her stage debut at the age of three on March 22, 1822 alongside her mother when they both appeared as mother and daughter characters in The Castle Spectre by Matthew Lewis. Career At age sixteen, in the role of Angela in that same play, she made both her official debut, at the Tremont Theatre, Boston, and later her New York stage debut, on March 29, 1834. Her career as an actress received some acclaim but mixed reviews and she suffered unfavorable comparisons with her distinguished mother. =Playwright= She was much more successful as a playwright. Her first attempt was a stage adaptation of the novel The Last Days of Pompeii by Edward Bulwer-Lytton. It was well received at the prestigious Camp Theatre in New Orleans, Louisiana, where she had been performing with her parents. She also adapted the Joseph Holt Ingraham novel Lafitte, The Pirate of the Gulf, about the French Gulf of Mexico pirate Jean Lafitte who helped win the Battle of New Orleans. It premiered at the Camp in the spring of 1837 and proved to be quite popular, especially in the south, and was being performed as late as 1850. Barnes' first original play was the blank verse drama Octavia Bragaldi, or, The Confession, which took the Beauchamp‚ÄìSharp Tragedy (the 1825 murder of Kentucky legislator Solomon P. Sharp by Jereboam O. Beauchamp) and set it in 15th century Milan, a popular trope of the day. It premiered at the National Theatre in New York City on November 9, 1837 with Barnes in the title role. It was a success in both the United States and England and Barnes and (after her marriage) her husband performed in it many times, as late as 1854. =Later career= In 1841, Barnes and her mother, who was now retired from the stage, went to England, where Barnes successfully acted in a number of productions, including Octavia Bragaldi. In 1846, she married the actor Edmond S. Connor and together they would appear on stage at and later manage the Arch Street Theatre in Philadelphia. Barnes' next original drama was The Forest Princess; or, Two Centuries Ago, about Pocahontas, which premiered at the Arch on February 16, 1848. Other Barnes works include an adaptation of the French monodrama A Night of Expectations, Charlotte Corday, based on the play by M.M. Dumanoir and Alphonse de Lamartine's work Histoire des Girondins, and an adaptation of the short play A Captive by Matthew Lewis. Death and legacy She continued writing and performing until 1863, when at age 45 she died after a sudden unnamed illness. Barnes' original works are collected in Plays, Prose and Poetry (1848), but her adaptations and translations do not survive. In an 1881 interview, her widower remarked of her, \\"She was a good woman and an excellent actress--kind, accomplished, good.\\" External links *\\"Miranda in the New World: The Tempest and Charlotte Barnes's The Forest Prince\\", essay by Mary Loeffelholz.

He established a fashionable studio in Bond Street in London, specializing in small scale portraits in pastel, crayons or gouache, often borrowing Reynolds' poses. By some critics Gardner is regarded as a notable artist who, however, was not an accurate draughtsman if it came to figure work especially to facial construction in some of his pastels. For others, on the other hand, it is this special looseness or facile elegance which represents the uniqueness of Gardner's style, and in which they see an anticipation of impressionism.  Education and career  Daniel Gardner was a pupil of George Romney. However, Gardner used to say that he learned very little from him. At around 1767 Gardner moved to London where in 1770 he became a student at the Royal Academy of Arts. There he was taught by Johann Zoffany, Nathaniel Dance-Holland, Benjamin West, Giovanni Battista Cipriani and Francesco Bartolozzi. In 1771 Gardner won a silver medal at the Royal Academy of Arts for the portrait of an old man. The portrait was styled as a drawing in the Royal Academy Catalogue and therefore it very possibly was a work in pastel. It is said in a letter by Daniel Gardner's grandson, George Harrison Gardner, dated in 1856, that the subject of this portrait was The Chained Captive.George Charles Williamson: Daniel Gardner, painter in pastel and gouache: A brief account of his life and works. John Lane, the bodley head, Vigo St., W, London 1921, p. 22. Apart from this picture no further works by Gardner were shown at the major London exhibitions. At that time Gardner was residing at 11, Cockspur Street, Pall Mall, London. Later in his life he had resided at two different addresses in New Bond Street, London, no. 120 and no. 142, removing to the latter in 1781, but in 1793 he transferred his residence to lodgings at 3, Beak Street, Golden Square, London. Jane Gordon, Duchess of Gordon, n√©e Lady Jane Maxwell. Daniel Gardner portrayed the Duchess in a green riding habit around 1780 (oil on canvas). The influence of Joshua Reynolds‚Äô late style is clearly visible. At around 1773 Daniel Gardner worked with Joshua Reynolds. It is said that in several of Joshua Reynolds' pictures, the trees or foliage were the work of Gardner. Reynolds' late style clearly influenced Gardner's work in terms of composition, handling, and conception of figures. However, if it comes to figure work Gardner was never such an accurate draughtsman like Reynolds was. It is quite easy to believe that Gardner was responsible in many instances for the landscape backgrounds, for the trees, for the tree trunks and for the wreaths of flowers in Reynolds‚Äô paintings. But it is not at all likely that Daniel Gardner was responsible for any of the figure work in the paintings of Joshua Reynolds.Neil Jeffares: Dictionary of pastellists before 1800 ‚Äì Gardner, Daniel. 2012.Samuel Redgrave: A Dictionary of Artists of the English School: Painters, Sculptors, Architects, Engravers and Ornamentists: With notices of their lives and work.

John Lane, the bodley head, Vigo St., W, London 1921, p. 41. Daniel Gardner became very popular as a portraitist. He portrayed some of the most famous personalities of his days like Jane Gordon, Duchess of Gordon, Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire, Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis, Elizabeth Lamb, Viscountess Melbourne, Frances Villiers, Countess of Jersey, Angelica Kauffman and Lord George Gordon. Therefore, it does not come as a surprise, that Gardner appears to have made money very rapidly. His pictures were very popular, he was able to paint quickly, and he got good prices for them. He spent a considerable part of his time away from home, having adopted the practice of staying in the house with his patron, when he could paint various members of the family, and sometimes of the neighbouring gentry as well. During all this time, Gardner was carefully saving up his money, and as soon as ever he was able to do so, he purchased on 10 December 1787 the old home of his parents in New Street, Kendal, and the property adjacent to it. Gardner continued this practice of buying houses and land for many years, until he had accumulated a substantial fortune and finally could afford to retire.George Charles Williamson: Daniel Gardner, painter in pastel and gouache: A brief account of his life and works. John Lane, the bodley head, Vigo St., W, London 1921, p. 34/35.The New York Times: The World of Art: Daniel Gardner, 31 July 1921. In particular Gardner was well known as a pastellist. However, towards the end of the 18th century he started to paint in a technique that included oil paint, crayons, gouache and pastel. This technique was later copied by several other painters like John Downman, John James Masquerier and Peter Romney (1743‚Äì1777), the brother of George Romney. However, large paintings Gardner painted in oil only. These are rare and do not often appear on the art market. According to an original letter from Daniel Gardner, dated: London, 12 November 1779, and now preserved in the J. H. Anderdon Collection in the British Museum, Gardner painted his very first oil painting in 1779. Gardner speaks in this letter of an oil picture that he had just completed, as \\"absolutely the first oil picture that I ever finished.\\" The gentleman shown on this very first oil picture was Philip Egerton of Oulton (1738‚Äì1786), bareheaded, and holding a hoe in his hand.George Charles Williamson: Daniel Gardner, painter in pastel and gouache: A brief account of his life and works. John Lane, the bodley head, Vigo St., W, London 1921, p. 31. It is said that Daniel Gardner made many of his own colours from strange herbs, which he collected in the woods, and especially from powders which he made from bark and from fungi. However, the majority of the dry colours used by Gardner he appears to have obtained from Messrs. Robertson & Miller, 51. Long Acre, London, as there are many allusions to their prices in his notebooks.George Charles Williamson: Daniel Gardner, painter in pastel and gouache: A brief account of his life and works.

Elizabeth Lamb, Viscountess Melbourne with Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire and Anne Seymour Damer in Witches Round the Cauldron, portrayed by Daniel Gardner in gouache (1775). Gardner hardly ever signed his works. As a result, his works were later, mainly in the 19th century, often attributed to his colleagues Joshua Reynolds or Thomas Gainsborough since they were better known within the general public. However, this does not come as a surprise if one takes into account that Gardner worked with both, Joshua Reynolds as well as Thomas Gainsborough.George Charles Williamson: Daniel Gardner, painter in pastel and gouache: A brief account of his life and works. John Lane, the bodley head, Vigo St., W, London 1921, p. 7. Marion Spielmann, in his work on British Portrait Painting, speaks of the connection between Thomas Gainsborough and Daniel Gardner. Spielmann refers to the \\"facile elegance of Gardner's work, which brings him closer to Gainsborough,\\" but goes on to say that \\"his handling was more deliberate and smoother than Gainsborough's, and wholly lacking, of course, in the feathery touches which the greater man came to adopt.\\" \\"Perhaps,\\" he adds, \\"the occasional looseness of Gainsborough's drawing was too easily identified with that of Gardner.\\" Spielman, however, is bound to notice \\"the extraordinary carelessness and defiance of facial construction\\" that is characteristic of some of Gardner's pastels, and points out that Gainsborough could never have painted in that method, and could never have made such mistakes as Gardner made in his haste.Marion Henry Spielmann: British Portrait Painting to the Opening of the Nineteenth Century. London, Berlin Photographic Co., 1910, Vol. II, p. 35. Samuel Redgrave wrote about Daniel Gardner: \\"He had a nice perception of beauty and character, and composed with elegance.\\" And William Hayley wrote in his Essay on Painting, Epistle II:George Charles Williamson: Daniel Gardner, painter in pastel and gouache: A brief account of his life and works. John Lane, the bodley head, Vigo St., W, London 1921, p. 18.

The president of the Royal Cambrian Academy of Art in Conwy, Sir Cuthbert C. Grundy (1846‚Äì1946), together with his brother John R. G. Grundy (‚Ä† 1915) founder of the Grundy Art Gallery in Blackpool, considered Daniel Gardner the most successful English pastellist of the 18th century, surpassing Joshua Reynolds in freedom and spontaneity, and John Downman in attaining finer and richer colour. Many of Gardners portraits were later engraved by engravers like Francis Haward (born 1759), his brother-in-law, Thomas Watson (1750‚Äì1781) Timothy Clayton, Anita McConnell, ‚ÄòWatson, Thomas (1750‚Äì1781)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 or William Ridley (1764‚Äì1838) or they were reproduced as mezzotints. From a financial point of view this was probably more lucrative for Gardner than the execution of the originals. Since Daniel Gardner could afford to retire at the height of his fame he also got out of the public eye and was nearly forgotten as an artist when he died in 1805. It was not until 1911 when his name and fame again came back into public awareness when his great-granddaughter, Miss H. B. Gardner, sold his portrait of Elizabeth Haward, Gardner's sister-in-law, through Christie's for the then record price of 2.200 guineas to Mr. Adolph Hirsch. Gardner portrayed his sister-in-law in oil. This portrait is said to be one of Gardner's finest works.George Charles Williamson: Daniel Gardner, painter in pastel and gouache: A brief account of his life and works.

Underneath his left knee the Earl wears the garter that goes with it. The Halifax Regional Municipality was named after the 2nd Earl of Halifax in 1749. Also the Halifax River is named after him. Daniel Gardner portrayed the Earl and his secretaries in gouache around 1767. Daniel Gardner was a Westmorland man, born in Redman's Yard, Stricklandgate, Kirkby-Kendal in 1750. His father is said to have been a master baker, his mother was a Miss Redman, sister of Mr. Alderman Redman of Kendal, an upholsterer, with whom George Romney's father John Romney, a cabinet maker, was connected in business.George Charles Williamson: Daniel Gardner, painter in pastel and gouache: A brief account of his life and works. John Lane, the bodley head, Vigo St., W, London 1921, p. 12. The members of the families of the two future portraitists, the Gardner's and the Romney's, knew each other well and it is said that one of the first portraits George Romney painted when he was still under twelve years old was the one of Daniel Gardner's mother.Rev. J. Romney, brother of George Romney: Memoirs of George Romney. [B. M. 787, I. 29], p. 12. Mrs. Gardner, interested in art and impressed by the work of the young boy, used all her influence to encourage George Romney to persevere, eventually interceding with his father to let painting be Romney's sole pursuit and profession.Cornelius Nicholson: Annals of Kendal.

It was in the house of the Gardner's that George Romney first met Daniel Gardner who later became his pupil.George Charles Williamson: Daniel Gardner, painter in pastel and gouache: A brief account of his life and works. John Lane, the bodley head, Vigo St., W, London 1921, p. 13. Daniel Gardner married his wife, whose first name was either Ann or Nancy, Haward on 8 October 1776. She was the sister of the engraver Francis Haward (born 1759). Gardner and his wife had two sons. However, only the elder son George (born 1778) survived. Gardner's wife died shortly after the birth of the second son in 1781. He never fully recovered from this tragic incident.George Charles Williamson: Daniel Gardner, painter in pastel and gouache: A brief account of his life and works. John Lane, the bodley head, Vigo St., W, London 1921, p. 19. After the early death of his wife, Daniel Gardner sent his son George to Kendal, where he was brought up by the Pennington family with whom Daniel Gardner had formed a close relationship. William Pennington of Dowker & Richardson, Attorneys, also looked after Gardner's business affairs in Kendal. Evidence of this friendship is a double portrait that Daniel Gardner painted around 1780 showing William Pennington and himself. George Gardner became a barrister and a burgess of Kendal. He later married Harriet Anne Cumming. They had a son called George Harrison Gardner who was born in July 1814 and baptised in April of the following year by the Rev. Robert Blair, the Rector of Barton St. Andrews, Norwich, whose portrait Daniel Gardner painted.George Charles Williamson: Daniel Gardner, painter in pastel and gouache: A brief account of his life and works.

Also The European Magazine and London Review reported about the death of Daniel Gardner. In the column of the Monthly Obituary there was the following short note to read: \\"Mr. Daniel Gardner, of Warwick-street, Golden-square, formerly an artist.\\" Gardner was buried on 13 July 1805 in the churchyard of St. James's, Piccadilly, London. The value of his estate, which Gardner left to his only surviving son George, was declared at ¬£10,000. However, it seems to be probable, from what his contemporaries thought about Gardner, that he had a far larger fortune to leave behind than would be represented by a sum of ¬£10,000. It is possible that the whole of the Kendal property may have been already placed in the name of his son, and therefore did not appear in the declaration that was made on the decease of the father, or there may have been some way of avoiding a declaration as to the value of his landed estate.Philological Society of London: The European Magazine and London Review.

William Heathcote (1772‚Äì1802), on horseback (son of the 3rd Baronet); Sir William Heathcote of Hursley, 3rd Baronet (1746‚Äì1819), holding his horse and whip; and Major Vincent Hawkins Gilbert, M.F.H., holding a Fox's mask. The Heathcote's family seat was Hursley House. Daniel Gardner was an eccentric. He sometimes would ask his sitters to show up in his studio at five o'clock in the morning. There he would only allow the sitters to be present. In his studio Gardner had a specially constructed easel with locking shutters since he refused to allow his sitters to see the work in progress. Gardner never travelled without this special easel. If he stayed in the house of his patron to do some portraits of him and his family he would even make it a condicio sine qua non to have his proper lockable workroom.George Charles Williamson: Daniel Gardner, painter in pastel and gouache: A brief account of his life and works. John Lane, the bodley head, Vigo St., W, London 1921, p. 43.

The Pays de la M√©e () (Breton: Bro-Vaez; Gallo: Paeyi de la M√©e) is a historical region of France which was part of the Duchy of Brittany before the French Revolution. It was then split between Loire-Atlantique and Ille-et- Vilaine department. Its capital is Ch√¢teaubriant, and the dialect traditionally spoken there is the Gallo language. Geography Areal view of the Pays de la M√©e, with fields, forests and pounds The area lies on the eastern border of Brittany, facing Anjou (nowadays Maine-et-Loire departement). Most of the territory is part of Loire-Atlantique, but several villages in Ille-et-Vilaine are usually included in the Pays de la M√©e. Moreover, its limits are not very clear; for example, Cand√©, a small town in Anjou, was named Cand√©-en-la-M√©e during the Middle Ages. The landscape of the Pays de la M√©e is hilly because it is on the eastern extremity of the Armorican massif. The ground is mostly made of schist and contains small amounts of iron ore, particularly exploited during the 19th century. The area is also crossed by several small rivers, such as the Don, and watermills used to be numerous. The area is mainly devoted to agriculture, especially cattle breeding. History Pays de la M√©e means \\"pays du milieu\\" (\\"middle-country\\") in French. The area is located between Angers, Nantes and Rennes, and it was around the 10th century a buffer zone, where the counts of each city were fighting. It also has an old mercantile tradition, the fair at Ch√¢teaubriant, was for instance founded in 1049. The Pays de la M√©e is first mentioned in 1055. It disappeared as an administrative unit around 1270, when the counties of Nantes and Rennes merged into one single state. The appellation \\"Pays de la M√©e\\" saw a revival during the 1970s, and several institutions bear this name, such as a theatre. Its limits also corresponds to the Pays de Ch√¢teaubriant, a group of 33 communes. File:Abbaye Notre-Dame de Melleray (3) - La Meilleraye- de-Bretagne.jpg|The Abbaye de Melleray.

A count off, count in, or lead-in is a verbal, instrumental or visual cue used in musical performances and recordings to ensure a uniform entrance to the performance by the musicians and to establish the piece's initial tempo, time signature and style. Although a count off usually lasts just one or two bars, it is able to convey the music's style, tempo, and dynamics from the leader (such as the conductor, bandleader or principal) to the other performers. A count off is generally in the same style of the piece of music‚Äîfor instance, a joyful swing tune should have an energized count off. A misleading lead-in, one which indicates a different meter than that of the piece, is a false trail.Shepherd, John (ed.) (2003). \\"Lead-in\\", Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World: Part 1 Performance and Production, p.610. .Van Der Merwe (1989), p.157. Cited in Shepherd (2003). Counting off is evident in musical genres other than Western classical and popular music; Ghanaian ethnomusicologist J. H. Kwabena Nketia has observed the benefits of such techniques in West African music. hi-hat A silent count off, such as those given by an orchestral conductor using a baton, may be given as a value \\"in front\\" (e.g. \\"eight in front\\" refers to a count off of eight beats). In recorded music, the final two beats of the count off (one, two, one‚Äîtwo‚Äîthree‚Äîfour) are often silent to avoid spill onto the recording, especially if the piece has a pickup. The count off is typically edited out after the recording has finished. There are, however, instances where the count off is deliberately kept on a recording‚Äîsometimes even edited onto a recording. In the case of \\"I Saw Her Standing There\\" by The Beatles, the count off was edited onto a different take of the song. A recorded count off can be made by musicians through an open microphone or through the studio's talkback system, the latter being done by non-performing personnel such as the producer or engineer. The inclusion of a count off in a studio recording may give the impression of a live performance, as on the Beatles' \\"Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band Reprise\\" (1967). Pre-count and count-off are functions of digital audio workstations which give an amount of click track‚Äîtypically two bars‚Äîbefore the recording begins.  Examples  * \\"Let's Dance\\" by Chris Montez (1962) **The song's verses accent upbeats on beats 1 and 3 and vice versa for the rest of the song, so drummer Jesse Sailes counts it off as \\"one‚Äîtwo‚Äîone, two, three\\". * \\"I Saw Her Standing There\\" by the Beatles (1963) ** Paul McCartney's count off of \\"one‚Äîtwo‚Äîthree‚Äîfour!\\" was recorded on the ninth take of the song, and then edited on to a different take comprising the rest of the song; George Martin liked the \\"spirited\\" raw live feel of the count off and decided to have it spliced onto a better performance. * \\"Wooly Bully\\" by Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs (1965) ** The song features a bilingual count off of \\"uno, dos, one, two, tres, cuatro\\". * \\"Taxman\\" by the Beatles (1966) ** George Harrison performs two count offs on the track‚Äîone is to set the tempo (and is most audible on the fourth beat), and another is for effect (it is off-tempo, \\"secretive-sounding\\", and layered with coughing) which was added later. * \\"A Day in the Life\\" by the Beatles (1966) ** John Lennon used a droll count off of \\"sugarplum fairy, sugarplum fairy\\"; the count off was not part of the take included on the album version (on Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band) but was first released on Anthology 2 in 1996. * \\"Give Peace a Chance\\" by John Lennon and the Plastic Ono Band (1969) ** The version recorded for the Live Peace in Toronto 1969 album features Lennon beginning with a count off in German: \\"eins, zwei, ein‚Äîzwei‚Äîdrei‚Äîvier\\". * \\"Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine\\" by James Brown (1970) ** The song begins with a few seconds of spoken dialogue, which Brown ends by saying \\"can I count it off? One‚Äîtwo‚Äîthree‚Äîfour!\\" * \\"I Don't Wanna Face It\\" by John Lennon (1984) ** The third track from Lennon's posthumous Milk and Honey album features a \\"characteristically free-form\\" count off of \\"un, deux, eins‚Äîzwei‚Äîhickle‚Äîpickle\\". * \\"Patience\\" by Guns N' Roses (1988) ** The song begins as bass guitarist Duff McKagen gives out the count off. \\"One, two, one, two, three, four\\". * \\"You Get What You Give\\" by the New Radicals (1998) ** Gregg Alexander counts the song off with \\"one, two, one‚Äìtwo‚Äìthree‚ÄìOW!\\" * \\"You'll Never Meet God (If You Break My Heart)\\" by Carly Hennessy (2001) ** Co-written by the New Radicals' Gregg Alexander, the song echoes his introduction to 1998's \\"You Get What You Give\\" with a count off of \\"one, two, one‚Äìtwo‚Äìthree‚ÄìOW!\\" * \\"Vertigo\\" by U2 (2004) ** During the final two bars of a four-bar drum introduction Bono counts off the song with \\"unos, dos, tres, catorce\\"‚Äîthe Spanish for \\"ones , two, three, fourteen\\".

Hailing from Greenhill Lane near Alfreton, Derbyshire, he was the son of Fanny and Samuel Langton. He followed his father, working as a coalminer. After some time playing for Mexborough, he moved to play for Doncaster Rovers in 1887 at around the age of 19 where, being an amateur, he worked as a slotting machinist at the GWR railworks. Langton started off in the left back position, moving to centre forward in the 1890‚àí91 season, then latterly returning to left back. He scored at least 55 goals in his career at Doncaster - in his early days many goals weren't accredited to a player in the records. The first recorded goals were a brace on 9 February 1889 in a 2‚àí2 draw against Newark. In his next season Langton scored at least 14 out of the 34 matches that the team played, including 5 against Newark in an 8‚àí0 victory on 1 February 1890. In 1890‚àí91 it was 11 goals out of the 19 games Rovers played. On 5 November 1898, he scored against Huddersfield in the Yorkshire League in the still standing joint record 14‚àí0 Doncaster win. Langton was the only recorded scorer of penalties for Rovers up till 1898. The first one recorded was in a 3‚àí3 draw against Sheffield Strollers in front of a crowd of 6,000 in the Sheffield and Hallamshire Challenge Cup on 18 February 1893 at the Olive Grove, Sheffield. In all he is listed as having scored 8 goals from the spot. After the 1904‚àí05 season with Doncaster, Langton retired from playing the game.

The Irish expedition to Scotland refers to a group of 2,000 troops that set sail from Ireland for Scotland in June 1644. Once in Scotland, they joined forces with the Royalist forces fighting the First English Civil War. The expedition was the result of an effort by King Charles I of England to enlist help from Irish Catholics in fighting Parliamentarian forces. Troop request In September 1643, a truce was made between James Butler, Marquis of Ormonde, who was leader of the Royalist regime based in Dublin, Ireland and the Confederate Catholics of Ireland. The truce permitted Butler to send some of his forces from Ireland to fight for King Charles I, while allowing the Confederate Catholics to concentrate their forces against the Scots and Parliamentarian forces in Ireland. King Charles hoped for troops from the Confederate Catholics of Ireland that he could use in the British theatres of the war. However, he could not be seen to be directly in league with the Irish Catholics since associating with them would alienate many of his British supporters. He decided to negotiate through Randal MacDonnell, Earl of Antrim, who was loyal to him but also held the rank of Lieutenant General of the Confederate Catholic armies. The plan was for MacDonnell to lobby the Confederate Supreme Council based in Kilkenny, Ireland, to allow him to send 2,000 Irish troops to Scotland and 10,000 troops to England. Troops are assembled In February 1644, MacDonnell was in Kilkenny where the Confederate Council agreed to arm and equip 2,000 men and transport them to Scotland, but the council refused to send men to England. The Scottish expedition was beneficial to the Confederate Council, in that it would draw the Scots army away from Ulster, which was, at that time, the biggest threat to southern Ireland. At the very least it would keep the Scots army close to the ports, which would prevent the campaign from spreading to southern and western Ireland. Another factor that the Confederates likely took into account was that many of the Ulster Irish disapproved of the Confederate- Ormond truce as their lands were still under occupation by the Scots. These men wished to continue fighting the Scots and the expedition gave them a chance to do this. Ships of the expedition The expedition sailed in late June, 1644, from the Port of Passage in County Waterford in three ships--The Christopher, The Angell Gabriel, and The Jacob of Ross--arranged by Kilkenny merchant Patrick Archer. These ships were protected by The Harp, a frigate which sailed out of Wexford. List of officers in the expedition A list of the officers and the numbers of soldiers exists in the Ormonde manuscripts in the National Library of Ireland. The names are mostly those of Ulster Gaels who would have come from what is now North Londonderry and Antrim, which were areas under Scottish occupation at the time. There are also some Leinster names, such as Ledwitch, Deasy and Newgent, and also some names of likely Scottish exiles from the Highlands. There are three regiments documented, which were commanded by Colonel James MacDermott (500 men), Colonel Manus O'Cahan (500 men), and Lieftenant-Generall Mac Donnell (1,030 men) who was most likely MacDonnell's brother, Alexander. However, it seems likely that he did not actually travel there, as there is a statement in the Commentarius Rinnucianianus that a \\"Thomas O'Lachnanus\\" commanded a regiment in the name of Alexander MacDonnell. This is likely the \\"Sarjeant Major Thomas Laghtnan\\" listed by MacDonnell. Overall command was given to Major General Alasdair MacColla MacDonald who is not on the manuscripts. Arrival in Scotland On the July 6, the expedition captured two English ships off Duart in the Isle of Mull, which \\"were laden with wheat, rye and sack\\", and on July 7 Colonel O'Cahan landed with 400 men in Morvern, followed on July 8 by MacDonald, who landed the rest of the army on Ardnamurchan. According to Leith's Memoirs of Scottish Catholics: \\"gradually the rumour everywhere spread that a cruel, savage and foreign enemy had invaded the country\\". After marching inland and linking with the Scottish Royalist leader, the Marquis of Montrose, this small army participated in a year of unbroken Royalist victories in Scotland, and fought in six major battles: Tippermuir, Aberdeen, Inverlochy, Auldhern, Alford and Kilsyth.

The battle ended in a French victory when Quebec was destroyed by an explosion.  Background  France along with Spain joined on the side of the Americans and war was declared between France and Britain. Britain did not attempt a close blockade of French ports, rather a screen of frigates kept a vigil while the ships of the line stayed at anchor at places like Torbay and Spithead. One of those frigates, operating off Guernsey, was the thirty-two gun, twelve-pounder frigate HMS Quebec under Captain George Farmer. Quebec had run aground on a submerged rock and had to throw excess weight overboard to refloat her, sacrificing his 12-pound cannon. When repaired in Portsmouth there were no replacements at the time, so ship and crew went back out on station armed with only nine pounders. On 6 October, Quebec working with the cutter HMS Rambler of ten guns spotted a frigate and a cutter. By 8:00 am they were found to be the French , 32-gun , under captain Cou√´dic de Kergoaler and the cutter Exp√©dition.Hennequin p. 101  Engagement  Quebec cleared for action and by 8:30 in the light wind the French frigate had opened fire. Within an hour Quebec opened fire after she became parallel with Surveillante. Initially Quebec had the upper hand but Surveillante matched Quebecs every move, and from 10 am until 1 pm both sides battered each other furiously. Soon casualties and damages to the respective ships began to take their toll. Farmer was wounded as was the first lieutenant who had to have his arm amputated after part of it was shot away and remarkably soon went back to duty. Cou√´dic was wounded twice within two hours but not seriously when all of Surveillantes masts and rigging progressively crashed down. Quebec seeing an opportunity was about to finish the French ship but her severely damaged and weakened masts all came down within a space of a half an hour. Quebecs main and foremasts went over the disengaged side, but the mizzen mast came down on the engagement side blocking many of the gunports with the sails and rigging.Carruthers p. 128 The ships drifted together with Surveillantes bowsprit becoming entangled in the wreckage of Quebecs mizzen mast. Quebecs gun captains kept up her rate of fire by shooting through the wreckage. Cou√´dic saw his opportunity to board and take Quebec but they were repulsed with heavy losses including Cou√´dic who had now an additional third wound. By now a stalemate had ensued; both sides' priority was now taken to sorting the damage and casualties were heavy. However, a turn of events began: a fire had begun on Quebecs mangled and tangled sails covering the gun ports, as a result of cannon fire. The fire soon spread out of control and soon took a hold of Surveillante. Cou√´dic though managed to break free of Quebec by chopping off the wreckage that entangled both ships, and the fire on the French ship was brought under control. However, on Quebec the situation was serious; the fire had spread within the ship itself and had become totally uncontrollable. Farmer ordered the magazine to be flooded but this was now futile, and by 6 pm the fire reached the magazine. British sailors jumped into the water as some knew the inevitable would happen. Farmer ordered the ship to be abandoned and panic ensued. Within moments Quebec exploded taking whatever was left of her complement including Farmer himself. Surveillante managed to be out of harm's way but was so badly shot up the vessel did not have a boat that was seaworthy and could only throw ropes to those sailors (those that could swim) that managed to get close to her. The cutters had fought their own separate battle and they too had battered themselves into submission. When Quebec exploded the task of rescuing survivors became a priority; the French cutter Exp√©dition broke off the engagement and helped as best she could. The British cutter Rambler had her sails and rigging so badly damaged she was unable to pursue or even intervene; she sent out a boat instead to help.Clark p. 131  Aftermath  One of the difficulties in rescuing the crew was the heavy swell as well as the light wind. Ramblers boat saved a master's mate, two midshipmen and fourteen sailors, while Surveillante saved the First Lieutenant, Second Lieutenant of marines, the surgeon and 36 of the crew. 13 more were saved by a passing Russian ship. The damage to Surveillante was severe, her hull was leaking and had 30 killed and 85 wounded. British and French sailors then had to work together to keep her afloat, and in that they were successful. She returned to Brest the next day under a jury rig. Cou√´dic and the rest of the French crew treated the surviving British as castaways found at sea, not as prisoners of war, seeing them repatriated without parole or exchange. Cou√´dic died of his wounds in January 1780, and was admired for his courage and compassion by both the French and the British. Surveillante took nearly a year for repairs to be complete and went on to fight in American waters and even brought news of the peace in Paris in company with the British frigate Medea in the summer of 1783. =Art= Numerous paintings and drawings of the battle were made, notably by Auguste-Louis Rossel de Cercy (a key exhibit of the Mus√©e national de la Marine in Paris), by George Carter (of which a print is dedicated to George III, the King of England) and by Robert Dodd.

Hansen, (Minneapolis: Standard Press, 1956). Career Hansen was born the son of Sivert Christian Hansen (1839-1872) and Marit Megrund (1842-1927) in Trondheim, Norway. He immigrated to the United States with his mother and siblings in 1881. His mother, widowed since 1872, took the family to Walnut Grove, Minnesota, where her parents and siblings had previously settled. In 1882 she and her children moved to Minneapolis. Except for a short stint in Chicago, her son Carl would live in the city for the next seventy-eight years. In his adopted hometown Hansen wrote for and edited the Dano-Norwegian newspaper Minneapolis Daglig Tidende (Minneapolis Daily Times) from 1897 until 1935. In Chicago he was similarly employed at Skandinaven newspaper between 1935 and 1937. He then edited Sons of Norway magazine in Minneapolis and served as the organization's educational director from 1939 until his retirement in 1954.History of Sons of Norway, an American fraternal organization of men and women of Norwegian birth or extraction by Carl G. O. Hansen, (Minneapolis: Sons of Norway Supreme Lodge, 1944). A lifelong musician, Hansen sang with and directed male choruses or church choirs from the age of sixteen until impaired hearing forced him to give up the activity. The Sons of Norway published a songbook in 1926 that provided a comprehensive collection of Norwegian songs for community singing by its membership.Sangbog for S√∏nner af Norge edited by Carsten Woll, (Minneapolis: S√∏nner af Norges forlag, 1926). A valuable resource, the book enjoyed large sales before finally, in the 1940s, going out of print. The need had arisen for lyrics in both Norwegian and English. A new edition of the book, meeting this requirement, was published in 1948. The two editors, Carl G. O. Hansen and Frederick Wick, produced several of the translations themselves. Since its initial publication, the bilingual Sons of Norway songbook has gone through numerous printings and been reissued in paperback and digital formats.Sons of Norway Songbook edited by Carl G. O. Hansen and Frederick Wick, (Minneapolis: The Sons of Norway, 1948). In 1956 Hansen published a memoir, My Minneapolis, whose subtitle was \\"A chronicle of what has been learned and observed about the Norwegians in Minneapolis through one hundred years\\". Although the book was autobiographical, it covered topics outside of the author's personal experience. He wrote, for instance, of Ole Bull's 1856 visit to Minneapolis and of Bj√∏rnstjerne Bj√∏rnson's 1880-1881 Midwestern lecture tour. Upon his arrival in Minneapolis, Hansen encountered the Norwegian authors Kristofer Janson and Knut Hamsun, who lived for a time in the city, and the Norwegian-American artists Jacob Fjelde and Herbj√∏rn Gausta. These men and many others figured in his historical narrative. Hansen was decorated as a Knight, First Class of the Order of St. Olav in 1923 and received the St. Olav's Medal in 1939.

Operation  The right of escort was, in the Middle Ages and Early Modern Period, before the emergence of modern statehood with its monopoly on violence, a means of ensuring legal certainty for travellers. An escort was guaranteed by the holder of the right in return for the payment of an escort fee (Geleitgeld). It was thus a popular source of income for the territorial lords. They were able to use their original military prowess and \\"sell\\" it for highly prized, hard cash, in an economy that, in the Late Middle Ages and Early Modern period, was overwhelmingly based on barter and natural produce. The boundaries between the regions of the individual escort lords (Geleitherr) were marked by escort crosses (Geleitkreuze) or stones (Geleitsteine). To begin with, traders were accompanied by mounted escorts (Geleitreiter or Geleitknechte) or teams; later, the escort lord made out letters of authority (Geleitbriefe) that travellers could purchase. In such letters the road owner committed himself to damages if the tradesman suffered losses as a result of robbery; i.e. provided a sort of security insurance. Tradesmen were obliged to use certain paths or routes (a duty known as Stra√üenzwang). This duty did not apply, however, for all goods nor to other travellers.  Forms  The following types of escort right may be distinguished: *The Schutzgeleit (\\"protection escort\\") was the escorting of travellers, especially merchants, in order to prevent robbery. This was also called a Zollgeleit or \\"toll escort\\". *Ehrengeleit (\\"honour escort\\") was an escort that to honour or provide support to very important people and was rather more ceremonial in nature. * Freies Geleit (\\"free escort\\") was the safe conduct of people against whom legal or military action would normally be taken, but who were being protected for particular reasons (peace envoy, witness). *Prozessgeleit (\\"trial escort\\") protected all participants on their way to or from a trial. *Heeresgeleit (\\"army escort\\") was intended to protect foreign troops as they marched through a region. *Marktgeleit (\\"market escort\\") is a special form, because there was a general protection for all those travelling to and from markets, without which in practice they would always need to be guarded by the presence of troops or payment of a toll. *Numerous individual and special forms that people, who were threatened with arrest or fines, employed to try to keep their freedom to trade. Whilst escorts were generally provided for people, they could also be used to protect certain goods, e.g. for the transport of the German Imperial Regalia from their repository in Nuremberg to the coronation site of Aachen (until 1531), later: Frankfurt am Main, and back.

She won sixteen of her twenty-four races, including two Oatlands Stakes, the Jockey-Club Plate and she beat Oaks and Derby winner Eleanor. She was bred and owned by Augustus FitzRoy, 3rd Duke of Grafton. After retiring from racing she became an influential broodmare, foaling Derby winners Whalebone and Whisker and 1000 Guineas winner Whizgig. Background Penelope was a bay filly bred by Augustus FitzRoy, 3rd Duke of Grafton, and foaled in 1798. She was sired by Claret Stakes winner Trumpator, who after retiring from racing became British Champion sire in 1803. Amongst his other progeny were Champion sire Sorcerer and Epsom Derby winner Didelot. Penelope's dam, Prunella, was a top broodmare and a daughter of the undefeated Highflyer. Prunella won three races, including a Sweepstakes of 200 guineas each at Newmarket. She also foaled Derby winner Pope and Oaks winner Pelisse. All of Prunella's daughters who lived to produce a foal became top broodmares in their own right. Her daughters Parasol, Pledge, Pawn, Pope Joan and Prudence all foaled Classic winners. Penelope was Prunella's second foal.

It was situated in the suburb of Lodge Moor. The hospital opened in 1902 and closed in 1956. History The hospital was opened in November 1902 by the Hospitals Committee of Sheffield Corporation as a facility for the treatment of smallpox, it consisted of two 21-bed wards, an eight bedded isolation block, administration building and a building for disinfecting and laundering garments. Prior to the First World War almost all admissions were smallpox cases. However, a successful vaccination programme saw the number of patients drop significantly as the disease was almost eradicated. This led to Crimicar Lane admitting increasing numbers of tuberculosis and silicosis cases, many of which were connected with Sheffield's cutlery industry, which used grindstones and buffing wheels for polishing, creating a large amount of gritty dust which caused respiratory diseases. During the First World War the hospital was partly used to accommodate injured soldiers and a temporary wooden ward was erected to provide the extra space needed. In 1948, with the establishment of the NHS, the hospital was transferred to Sheffield No 3 Hospital Management Committee of Sheffield Regional Hospital Board (SRHB). In 1955 the Board recommended that Crimicar Lane should no longer be used as a hospital and the tuberculosis Huts were demolished at that time. All patients were transferred to Lodge Moor Hospital on 31 May 1956. The hospital stood empty for some time before the remaining buildings were demolished to make way for the housing which now stands on Westminster Crescent. All that remains of the old hospital are the perimeter wall and the main gates which have a memorial plaque attached to them.

Beginning in 1993, TSF brought together several local radio stations in France: Forum 91,3 in Bordeaux, Agora FM in Grasse, Loire FM in Saint-√âtienne and four other local stations known as \\"TSF\\" in Cognac, Lyon, N√©rac, and Nice in addition to TSF Paris. TSF then changed its Parisian frequency from 93.0 FM to 89.9. TSF Jazz in Paris is still broadcasting on this frequency.TSF Jazz l'histoire, Puisaleine FM - Skyrock In 1995, four new stations began to retransmit some of its programs (news and programs) on Radio Calaisis from Calais, Actuel from Le Havre, Chalette from Montargis and Radio Quinquin from Saint-Omer. In 1996, TSF was at its peak with three new stations: TSF Jordanne (Cantal department), TSF Is√®re (Grenoble) TSF Aravis (Ugine). The TSF radio network then broadcast on 19 frequencies in France. The station stopped broadcasting in the local radio stations of Bordeaux, Lyon, N√©rac, Nice, le Havre, Saint-Omer and Grenoble. The other stations Agora, Loire FM, Calaisis, Radio Chalette and Radio Jordanne then become completely independent again, while keeping the spirit of TSF. In 1998, TSF Cognac and TSF Aravis stopped broadcasting as well.

USFWS (in Spanish, mariposa arlequ√≠n de Puerto Rico or quebradillana). This brush-footed butterfly is endemic to Puerto Rico. It is a candidate for United States federal protection as an endangered species. In 2011 a report found federal protection to be warranted, but it was precluded by other actions and it remains a candidate.Endangered and threatened wildlife and plants; 12-Month finding on a petition to list Puerto Rican Harlequin Butterfly as endangered. USFWS This butterfly has a wingspan of about 6 centimeters. The wings have a scattered harlequin pattern of orange, black, red, and white. This species was described in 1877 from specimens collected in Quebradillas. Its historical range includes this municipality as well as Arecibo, Maricao, Sabana Grande, and Pe√±uelas. Only two populations remain today, those around Quebradillas and Maricao. It can be found in the Maricao Commonwealth Forest. The total population has been estimated to be fewer than 70 imagoes (adults) at any given time. This butterfly lives in subtropical moist and wet forest habitat. The substrate is limestone and serpentine. The flora of the region includes Oplonia spinosa (prickly bush), Coccoloba uvifera (sea grape), Bourreria succulenta (palo de vaca), Lantana camara (cariaquillo), Lantana involucrata (buttonsage), Randia aculeata (tintillo), Vernonia albicaulis (Santa Maria), Poitea paucifolia (retama), Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena), Chromolaena odorata (Siam weed), Erithalis fructicosa (blacktorch), Distictis lactifolia (liana fragante), Bidens pilosa (Spanish needle), Croton rigidus (adormidera), Stachytarpheta jamaicensis (blue porterweed), Stigmaphyllon emarginatum (bull reed), and Tabebuia heterophylla (roble). The butterfly is considered a specialist species. The prickly bush, Oplonia spinosa, is the butterfly's only host for oviposition, and it only lays eggs on the new green stems of the plant. Then the larvae feed upon this plant species. Adult butterflies feed mostly on other plant species. This rare butterfly is threatened by a number of factors, the most important of which is habitat destruction and modification caused by urban development in the species' region. The species' host plant is being removed. The area has high value for tourism-related construction. Also, the butterfly has what is considered \\"low reproductive capacity\\". Other threats include fire, herbicides, pesticides, and climate change.

In 1787 they organized a wave of uprisings and rioting known as the Small Revolution and the resulting crackdown by the Austrian forces forced Van der Noot and his Statists into exile in the Dutch Republic. Statists supported Belgian independence but their main area of concern was protecting the local privileges and the Catholic Church. After the proclamation of the United States of Belgium, the Statist managed to exclude the Vonckists from government and forced them into exile. The new Belgian state was short-lived as Habsburg rule was restored at the end of 1790, forcing the Statists from power.

This activity is a Grand Challenge focused on revolutionizing our understanding of the human brain, and was developed by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) as part of a broader White House Neuroscience Initiative. Inspired by the Human Genome Project, BRAIN aims to help researchers uncover the mysteries of brain disorders, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, depression, and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Participants in BRAIN and affiliates of the project include DARPA and IARPA as well as numerous private companies, universities, and other organizations in the United States, Australia, Canada, and Denmark. Background The BRAIN Initiative reflects a number of influences, stemming back over a decade. Some of these include: planning meetings at the National Institutes of Health that led to the NIH's Blueprint for Neuroscience Research; workshops at the National Science Foundation (NSF) on cognition, neuroscience, and convergent science, including a 2006 report on \\"Grand Challenges of Mind and Brain\\"; reports from the National Research Council and the Institute of Medicine's Forum on Neuroscience and Nervous System Disorders, including \\"From Molecules to Mind: Challenges for the 21st Century,\\" a report of a June 25, 2008 Workshop on Grand Challenges in Neuroscience.; years of research and reports from scientists and professional societies; and congressional interest. One important activity was the Brain Activity Map Project. In September 2011, molecular biologist Miyoung Chun of The Kavli Foundation organized a conference in London, at which scientists first put forth the idea of such a project. At subsequent meetings, scientists from US government laboratories, including members of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and the Allen Institute for Brain Science, along with representatives from Google, Microsoft, and Qualcomm, discussed possibilities for a future government-led project. Other influences included the interdisciplinary \\"Decade of the Mind\\" project led by James L. Olds, who is currently the Assistant Director for Biological Sciences at NSF, and the \\"Revolutionizing Prosthetics\\" project at DARPA, led by Dr. Geoffrey Ling and shown on 60 Minutes in April 2009. Development of the plan for the BRAIN Initiative within the Executive Office of the President (EOP) was led by OSTP and included the following EOP staff: Philip Rubin, then Principal Assistant Director for Science and leader of the White House Neuroscience Initiative; Thomas Kalil, Deputy Director for Technology and Innovation; Cristin Dorgelo, then Assistant Director for Grand Challenges, and later Chief of Staff at OSTP; and Carlos Pe√±a, Assistant Director for Emerging Technologies and currently the Division Director for the Division of Neurological and Physical Medicine Devices, in the Office of Device Evaluation, Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Announcement NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins and President Barack Obama announcing the BRAIN Initiative On April 2, 2013, at a White House event, President Barack Obama announced The BRAIN Initiative, with proposed initial expenditures for fiscal year 2014 of approximately $110 million from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the National Science Foundation (NSF). The President also directed the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues to explore the ethical, legal, and societal implications raised by the initiative and by neuroscience in general. Additional commitments were also made by the Allen Institute for Brain Science, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and The Kavli Foundation. The NIH also announced the creation of a working group of the Advisory Committee to the Director, led by neuroscientists Cornelia Bargmann and William Newsome and with ex officio participation from DARPA and NSF, to help shape NIH's role in the BRAIN Initiative. NSF planned to receive advice from its directorate advisory committees, from the National Science Board, and from a series of meetings bringing together scientists in neuroscience and related areas. Experimental approaches News reports said the research would map the dynamics of neuron activity in mice and other animals and eventually the tens of billions of neurons in the human brain.Human brains average 86 billion neurons by a recent estimate. Source: How many neurons make a human brain? Billions fewer than we thought. Notes & Theories. The Guardian. Feb 28, 2012. In a 2012 scientific commentary outlining experimental plans for a more limited project, Alivisatos et al. outlined a variety of specific experimental techniques that might be used to achieve what they termed a \\"functional connectome\\", as well as new technologies that will have to be developed in the course of the project. They indicated that initial studies might be done in Caenorhabditis elegans, followed by Drosophila, because of their comparatively simple neural circuits. Mid-term studies could be done in zebrafish, mice, and the Etruscan shrew, with studies ultimately to be done in primates and humans. They proposed the development of nanoparticles that could be used as voltage sensors that would detect individual action potentials, as well as nanoprobes that could serve as electrophysiological multielectrode arrays. In particular, they called for the use of wireless, noninvasive methods of neuronal activity detection, either utilizing microelectronic very-large-scale integration, or based on synthetic biology rather than microelectronics. In one such proposed method, enzymatically produced DNA would serve as a \\"ticker tape record\\" of neuronal activity, based on calcium ion-induced errors in coding by DNA polymerase. Data would be analyzed and modeled by large scale computation. A related technique proposed the use of high-throughput DNA sequencing for rapidly mapping neural connectivity. =Timeline= The timeline proposed by the Working Group in 2014 is: *2016‚Äì2020: technology development and validation *2020‚Äì2025: application of those technologies in an integrated fashion to make fundamental new discoveries about the brain Working group The advisory committee is: * Cornelia Bargmann, PhD (co‚Äêchair), The Rockefeller University * William Newsome, PhD (co‚Äêchair), Stanford University * David J.

Neuroscientist John Donoghue said that the project would fill a gap in neuroscience research between, on the one hand, activity measurements at the level of brain regions using methods such as fMRI, and, on the other hand, measurements at the level of single cells. Psychologist Ed Vul expressed concern, however, that the initiative would divert funding from individual investigator studies. Neuroscientist Donald Stein expressed concern that it would be a mistake to begin by spending money on technological methods, before knowing exactly what would be measured. Physicist Michael Roukes argued instead that methods in nanotechnology are becoming sufficiently mature to make the time right for a brain activity map. Neuroscientist Rodolfo Llin√°s declared at the first Rockefeller meeting \\"What has happened here is magnificent, never before in neuroscience have I seen so much unity in such a glorious purpose.\\" The projects face great logistical challenges. Neuroscientists estimated that the project would generate 300 exabytes of data every year, presenting a significant technical barrier. Most of the available high-resolution brain activity monitors are of limited use, as they must be invasively implanted surgically by opening the skull. Parallels have been drawn to past large-scale government-led research efforts including the map of the human genome, the voyage to the moon, and the development of the atomic bomb.

He was the son of Zhou Fang, a famous Eastern Wu general. Zhou Chu had a reputation for uprightness and integrity and once indicted the Prince of Liang, Sima Rong (). When the Di tribe invaded from the northwest, Zhou Chu was ordered by Sima Rong to fight the 20,000-strong enemy head-on with 5,000 soldiers and no supply. He died in the battles. Eradicating the Three Scourges A folk story about Zhou Chu appeared in the 430 book A New Account of the Tales of the World and proved to be very popular. The story claims that Zhou Chu was such a cruel and violent ruffian in his younger days that he was called one of the \\"Three Scourges\\" by the villagers in his native (present- day city of Yixing, Jiangsu), along with a tiger and a dragon. Prompted by a villager, Zhou Chu took on the challenge to seek out and kill the tiger and the scaly dragon that lived in a stream (the jiao). His battle with this dragon endured for 3 days in Lake Tai, and the villagers were celebrating the demise of the two scourges when Zhou Chu returned triumphant with the dragon's head. That was when he realized that he was the last scourge that the villagers feared. Determined to mend his old ways, he sought out Eastern Wu generals Lu Ji and Lu Yun, and received encouragement. Eventually he became an accomplished general beloved by his people. Death Zhou Chu became Palace Aide to the Censor-in-Chief () and had no fear in indicting and exposing the wrongdoings of other ministers. He thus offended many, including Sima Rong, son of Sima Yi and an uncle of Emperor Wu of Jin. In 296, when Sima Rong was named the Grand General of the Western expedition to quell the Di rebellion, Zhou Chu was named the vanguard general. His fellow general Sun Xiu () warned him and suggested him to bid his aging mother a final farewell. Zhou Chu replied, \\"One cannot fulfill both filial piety and loyalty at the same time. Since I have already chosen to serve my country... I will die for it.\\" Zhou Chu was ordered to take 5,000 soldiers to attack the 20,000-strong enemy. After the attacks began, Sima Rong also ordered his supply to be cut off completely. Zhou's troops ran out of arrows and the generals assigned to reinforce him did not help. When asked to flee, Zhou Chu replied, \\"I am a minister of a nation. Isn't it proper to die for one's country?\\" He fought to his death.Wu Fusheng (2008). Panegyric Poetry in Early Medieval China.

Her best known work was in the field of Homeric archaeology and ancient Greece, but she also visited and published on Turkey, Albania and the area that later became Yugoslavia. She took the position of vice-principal of Somerville College during the Second World War. Family The grave of Hilda Lockhart Lorimer, Warriston Cemetery Lorimer was born on 30 May 1873 in Edinburgh, Scotland. She was the second of eight children born to Reverend Robert Lorimer and his wife. Her brother David Lockhart Robertson Lorimer was a lieutenant-colonel in the British Indian Army, a linguist and a political official in the British Indian government.Lorimer, Lieutenant-Colonel David Lockhart Robertson, School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) Archive Catalogue Her brothers Gordon and Bert worked in the civil administration in the Indian Political Service. Another, William, became Professor of Classics at St Andrews. Her sister Emilia became a notable poet, and her other sister Florence served as personal secretary to Aurel Stein at the British Museum. It was said that she could speak ancient Greek and Latin by the age of five. She never used her first name; her family called her Hiddo; and at Oxford she came to be known as Highland Hilda because of her Scottish background. Education Lorimer attended the High School of Dundee in Scotland from 1889 ‚Äì 1893. She was granted a scholarship to Girton College at Cambridge University, where she earned a first. Career In 1896, she became a fellow and tutor of Classics at Somerville College, Oxford, which is where she spent the rest of her career. At Somerville, she had little contact with colleagues. She was noted for her Saturday ornithology expeditions, which continued throughout her career in Oxford, and gained somewhat of a reputation for eccenticity and invincibility. She was a skilled Latin linguist, but at Oxford her interests turned toward archaeology. She took a sabbatical to attend the British School at Athens in 1901 and 1902. There she began focusing on Homeric archaeology, the study of ancient civilisations known through the poems of Homer.Helen Waterhouse, Breaking Ground: Women in Old World Archaeology, Brown University. In 1911, she participated in excavations at Phylakopi on Melos. Dorothy Lamb, Lillian Tenant and Lorimer were the first women to participate in an excavation conducted by the British School at Athens. The excavation, led by Richard MacGillivray Dawkins, the director of the British School, was conducted from March to May 1911. The project was a supplementary excavation of a site that had been explored from 1896 to 1899. In 1917 she went to Salonica as a nursing orderly in the Scottish Women's Hospital (the Girton and Newnham Unit). Lorimer took an Oxford MA at the first opportunity, in 1920,\\"Degrees conferred at Oxford\\". Yorkshire Post, 15 October 1920. p5. and a Cambridge MA in 1948. She returned to Athens in 1922 and became a university lecturer at Oxford from 1929 to 1937. She retired in 1939, but remained an honorary fellow. She took the position of vice-principal of Somerville College during the second world war. She died on 1 March 1954 and is buried with her siblings in Warriston Cemetery in north Edinburgh. The grave lies to the south-west of the now-sealed eastern entrance. Publications Lorimer published extensively on Homeric studies throughout her career, but her seminal work came late in life with the publication of Homer and the Monuments. Its publication was delayed until 1950 by the Second World War, so that she was seventy-seven by the time it was published.

Early life Mayreder was born the son of Leopold (1823‚Äì1892), a restaurateur and hotelier, and Henriette Rettmeyer (1834‚Äì1923). His siblings were Karl Mayreder (1856‚Äì1935), also a prominent Austrian architect; and Rudolf (1865‚Äì1937), a lawyer, civil engineer, and contractor. He married Marie Einsle (1873‚Äì1958) in 1904 and had a son, Frederick (1905‚Äì1954), also an architect. Education From 1878‚Äì1880, Mayreder studied at the Technical University in Vienna, but left after two years to pursue greater artistic freedom. From 1880‚Äì1882, he was a student at a Kunstgewerbeschule (school of arts and crafts). Between 1883‚Äì1886, he studied at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna (Akademie der bildenden K√ºnste) under Friedrich von Schmidt. In 1887, he traveled in Greece, Constantinople, Italy, Germany, and France on a Prix de Rome scholarship, awarded to promising arts students. Career Mayreder began work in the offices of the architects Viktor Luntz in Trieste and Adolf Lang in Budapest in 1888. In 1890, he worked in the architectural studio of Franz von Neumann. Beginning in 1891, he worked as an independent architect. He collaborated frequently with his brothers Karl and Rudolf. In 1893, they won a competition to manage construction in Stubenviertel, close to Vienna's historic city center. They also won second prize for a project to manage construction in all of Vienna. Mayreder designed many buildings, both residential and industrial. As an architect, Mayreder favored a Baroque style. He was also a founding member of the Vienna Secession in 1897.

Otto B. de Kat, Selfportrait, 1985; 70 √ó 50 cm. Coll. Frans Halsmuseum, Haarlem  Biography  He was born in Dordrecht, but received his training in Haarlem as a pupil of Henri Fr√©d√©ric Boot and Samuel Jessurun de Mesquita.Otto B. De Kat in the RKD He married the poet Maria Jannetta (‚ÄòHans‚Äô) van Zijl in 1930. They traveled to Italy, where De Kat's work was exhibited alongside work by Maurits Cornelis Escher, and France, where De Kat was inspired by fauvism and the members of the √âcole de Paris. De Kat was a driving force behind the Kennemer Kunstenaarskring. After the war, he and Kees Verwey founded the Hollandse Aquarellistenkring and De Kat remained its chairman until after 1965. He moved to Bloemendaal and became a good friend of Godfried Bomans, helping him found the Teisterbant club. De Kat became a member of Arti et Amicitiae where he won the Arti Medal in 1969. Ten years later, in 1979, he received the Jeanne Oosting Prize. He was an art critic for the newspaper Haarlems Dagblad in the years 1951‚Äì1955 and wrote for Het Vrije Volk. After 1955 he became a teacher at the Amsterdam Rijksakademie, where he would be a tutor for many artists until 1972. His relationship with Hans van Zijl came to an end, just before she died in 1963. De Kat moved to Amsterdam and remarried in 1964 with Danish artist Dora Dahl-Madsen. The couple spent a lot of time in their second house in France, an inspiring environment for De Kat. Due to health issues they left Amsterdam in 1992 and moved to Laren. He died there, at the age of 88.  Work  As an artist, De Kat was influenced by the √âcole de Paris and painters like Pierre Bonnard, √âdouard Vuillard, Albert Marquet en Nicolas de Sta√´l. His paintings are mostly landscapes and still lifes with an intimate, calm atmosphere. His surroundings were his most important source of inspiration. Although he used abstraction in his paintings, he never abandoned reality completely. As a teacher, he focused on craftmanship, the weight of tradition and the interplay between rationality and emotions.

Designation of historic places and areas Depending on their nature and significance, historic places in New Brunswick may be eligible for recognition and/or protection under the Heritage Conservation Act under one of the following types of designations: # Provincial Heritage Place (places which are provincially significant, as designated by the government of New Brunswick through the Minister of the Department of Tourism, Heritage and Culture); # Municipal Heritage Conservation Area (districts within a municipality having unique heritage value as a conservation area, as designated by the municipality); and # Local Historic Place (places that exhibit local historic significance, as designated by the municipality with the consent of the property owner). Once designated, the character-defining elements of a Provincial Heritage Place cannot be altered without a provincial heritage permit, nor can work or development occur in a Municipal Heritage Conservation Area without a permit issued by the municipality's heritage board. The designation of a site as a Local Historic Place does not impose any restrictions or obligations on the owner of the property. The Heritage Conservation Act received Royal Assent on February 26, 2010. It replaced and repealed the Historic Sites Protection Act of 1973 and the Municipal Heritage Preservation Act of 1978. A site that had been designated as an historic or anthropological site under the former Historic Sites Protection Act is deemed to be a Provincial Heritage Place under the new statute, while a by-law establishing a Municipal Heritage Conservation Area under the former Municipal Heritage Preservation Act is deemed to continue to be in force under the new legislation. Archaeological protection Section 5 of the Heritage Conservation Act establishes that the provincial Crown has ownership of all \\"archaeological, palaeontological and burial site heritage objects in New Brunswick\\". If the object is of Aboriginal origin it is to be 'held in trust' on behalf of the Aboriginal communities. The Act provides guidelines and standards on how professional research is to be conducted, and how the management of objects is to be done. There are also guidelines regarding how amateur researchers can participate and gain approval for specific type of heritage exploration. Included in the Act is a clause that enforces the mandatory reporting of all possible discoveries of heritage objects to the provincial authority. It outlines regulations of heritage impact assessment, and \\"prohibits the alteration of any heritage place in the Province without specific government approval\\". Burial grounds In New Brunswick, burial grounds are mainly covered under the Cemetery Companies Act. However, the Heritage Conservation Act protects places that have been used in the past for the placement of human remains or related objects, including old family plots, ancient burial grounds and abandoned cemeteries. A \\"burial ground\\" is defined in the heritage legislation as any place containing human remains and/or their associated objects. The discovery of such a site must be reported to the Heritage Branch of the Department of Tourism, Heritage and Culture as soon as possible specifying the location, and date and time it is discovered. Upon this reporting it will be reviewed by the Minister who will then make a decision as to whether or not to implement procedures to the protect the site. It is illegal for anyone to alter or disturb a burial ground or object.

As a young boy, Fried fell in love with the art and science of sound reproduction when he first heard Stokowski and the Philadelphia Orchestra emerging from the large theater horns of his father's movie theaters. Later, when Fried attended Harvard University, he fell under the sway of Professors Hunt and Pierce who, under a Western Electric research grant, were conducting monumental research into high fidelity phono reproduction. He received his undergraduate degree from Harvard University, and thereafter served as an officer in the United States Navy during World War II. Among his assignments, he was posted as liaison to the Free French Air Force. After the war he attended and graduated from Harvard Law School. Based on the advice of Victor Brociner, co-founder of the Philharmonic Radio Co., Bud became the official importer of the Lowther corner horns, the creations of P.G.A.H. Voight. A year later, he expanded his offerings and began importing the revolutionary Quad electrostatic. At the suggestion of Saul Marantz, the IMF (Irving M Fried) trademark was registered in 1961, a trademark that was eventually applied to many advanced developments in music reproduction: cartridges (IMF ‚Äì London, IMF ‚Äì Goldring), tone arms (SME, Gould, Audio and Design), amplifiers (Quad, Custom Series), loudspeakers (Lowther, Quad, Celestion, Bowers and Wilkins, Barker, etc.) In 1968 a British branch of IMF was opened. This combined Anglo-American company produced the now legendary IMF Monitor. In 1975 the English and American divisions of IMF were split, and the trademark FRIED was thenceforth used on all of Bud's designs. The new designs were based upon the same principles that had created the IMF Monitor in addition to new technology as it became available. FRIED benchmarks include the Model H System, the Model M (1977), the SUPER Monitor, and the B satellite series (1976 to 1979). Among the many design principles that he utilized, he is best known for his development of loudspeakers for realistic audio reproduction that were based on transmission line loading and resistive series crossover networks.

The book is divided into three sections, containing eight separate papers produced by various scholars working in the field of Satanism studies; Contemporary Religious Satanism examines different forms of Satanism as practiced in Europe and North America. It was a part of Ashgate's series of books on \\"Controversial New Religions\\" alongside tomes devoted to the academic study of new religious movements, such as Wicca and the Order of the Solar Temple. Academic reviews were mixed, being printed in peer-reviewed academic journals such as Nova Religio, Aries, and Magic, Ritual, and Witchcraft. It was recognised as a pioneering publication in the field of Satanism studies. Reception The volume was reviewed by the British anthropologist Jean La Fontaine for the Nova Religio journal, and by the Swedish historian of religion Per Faxneld of Stockholm University for the Aries journal. Erik Davis of Rice University reviewed the anthology for the Magic, Ritual, and Witchcraft journal, noting that the book was primarily sociological in basis but that it opened up \\"an underresearched and underreported topic\\". Describing Petersen's \\"thorough introduction\\", he then discusses the various papers within the anthology. He opines that Lowney had \\"beautifully\\" described her encounters, but that it was \\"unfortunate\\" that she spent so much of the text reflecting on her logistical challenges, subsequently describing S√∏derlind and Dyrendal's contribution as \\"one of the most lively and entertaining\\" parts of the volume. He remarks positively of Granholm's criticism of the term \\"Satanism\\", describing his chapter as a \\"crucial contribution\\", and believing that he has made a \\"good case\\" for the term \\"Left-Hand Path\\". The volume also dedicates an essay to the old-school Norwegian Black Metal scene, which according to Davis \\"shows how [...] aesthetics, ethos, and metaphysical worldview\\" are \\"fused into a paradigmatic (and sometimes violent) moment of satanic sincerity‚Äîone whose grim ascesis features, paradoxically, an almost total inversion of LaVey's call for hedonic enjoyment\\". Moving on to review the inclusion of primary documents at the end of the volume, he believes that the works presented appear \\"minor in context\\", and that it is unfortunate that texts from LaVey and Aquino were not included. As such, he believes that Contemporary Religious Satanism is not \\"the perfect reader.\\" Wishing that philosophical and symbolic analyses of Satanism had been included alongside the sociological studies, he also felt that \\"much more can be made\\" regarding the differences between LaVeyan-influenced secular Satanists and the mystical Left-Hand Path followers. He believed that the volume would be of great interest to scholars of magic, contemporary Paganism and new religious movements.

Rotational viscosity is a property of a fluid which determines the rate at which local angular momentum differences are equilibrated. It is only appreciable if there are rotational degrees of freedom for the fluid particles. In the classical case, by the equipartition theorem, at equilibrium, if particle collisions can transfer angular momentum as well as linear momentum, then these degrees of freedom will have the same average energy. If there is a lack of equilibrium between these degrees of freedom, then the rate of equilibration will be determined by the rotational viscosity coefficient. Derivation and Use The angular momentum density of a fluid element is written either as an antisymmetric tensor (J_{ij}) or, equivalently, as a pseudovector. As a tensor, the equation for the conservation of angular momentum for a simple fluid with no external forces is written: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial J_{ij}}{\\\\partial t}+\\\\frac{\\\\partial (v_kJ_{ij})}{\\\\partial x_k}=\\\\left( x_j\\\\frac{\\\\partial P_{ki}}{\\\\partial x_k}-x_i\\\\frac{\\\\partial P_{kj}}{\\\\partial x_k }\\\\right) +(P_{ji}-P_{ij}) where v_i is the fluid velocity and P_{ij} is the total pressure tensor (or, equivalently, the negative of the total stress tensor). Note that the Einstein summation convention is used, where summation is assumed over pairs of matched indices. The angular momentum of a fluid element can be separated into extrinsic angular momentum density due to the flow (L_{ij}) and intrinsic angular momentum density due to the rotation of the fluid particles about their center of mass (S_{ij}): :J_{ij}=L_{ij}+S_{ij} where the extrinsic angular momentum density is: :L_{ij}=\\\\rho (x_i v_j-x_j v_i) and \\\\rho is the mass density of the fluid element. The conservation of linear momentum equation is written: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial (\\\\rho v_i)}{\\\\partial t}+\\\\frac{\\\\partial (\\\\rho v_i v_k)}{\\\\partial x_k}=-\\\\frac{\\\\partial P_{ki}}{\\\\partial x_k} and it can be shown that this implies that: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial L_{ij}}{\\\\partial t}+\\\\frac{\\\\partial (v_kL_{ij})}{\\\\partial x_k}=\\\\left( x_j\\\\frac{\\\\partial P_{ki}}{\\\\partial x_k}-x_i\\\\frac{\\\\partial P_{kj}}{\\\\partial x_k }\\\\right) Subtracting this from the equation for the conservation of angular momentum yields: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial S_{ij}}{\\\\partial t}+\\\\frac{\\\\partial (v_kS_{ij})}{\\\\partial x_k}=P_{ji}-P_{ij} Any situation in which this last term is zero will result in the total pressure tensor being symmetric, and the conservation of angular momentum equation will be redundant with the conservation of linear momentum. If, however, the internal rotational degrees of freedom of the particles are coupled to the flow (via the velocity term in the above equation), then the total pressure tensor will not be symmetric, with its antisymmetric component describing the rate of angular momentum exchange between the flow and the particle rotation. In the linear approximation for this transport of angular momentum, the rate of flow is written: :P_{ij}-P_{ji}=-\\\\eta_r\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial v_i}{\\\\partial x_j}-\\\\frac{\\\\partial v_j}{\\\\partial x_i}-2\\\\omega_{ij}\\\\right) where \\\\omega_{ij} is the average angular velocity of the rotating particles (as an antisymmetric tensor rather than a pseudovector) and \\\\eta_r is the rotational viscosity coefficient.

History On 1 January 1994, Chante France was created and later sponsored by four people of the French radio and chanson : Pierre Bellanger (Skyrock), St√©phane Collaro, Eddie Barclay and mainly Hachette Filipacchi M√©dias. Originally, it should be the first radio station to compete with the popular French radio station Ch√©rie FM (NRJ Group). But given the scarcity of frequencies in France, the preference was given for the development of Skyrock. The challenge was also to meet state requirements concerning the dissemination of French songs. (amendment Pelchat, 1994). In November 2010, Groupe Orbus (also owning Skyrock) sold the Chante France station to the HPI Groupe (also owning √âvasion FM), which kept the French music only format but added presenters and a complete new logo, and plans to evolve the Parisian station nationally in the future.

The Newton Corner station, known simply as Newton for much of its lifetime, served commuters on the Worcester Line (run by the New York Central Railroad and its predecessors) from 1834 to 1959. The trolley stop, located on the surface streets, served a number of routes beginning in 1898, including the Green Line A branch until 1969. Newton Corner is now a stop and transfer point for a number of bus routes including high- frequency express routes to downtown Boston as well as local routes. History=Railroad station= Early photograph of the pre-1880s depot The Boston and Worcester Railroad opened the segment from downtown Boston to West Newton on April 7, 1834, with a station called Newton Corner opening then or soon after in the Angier's Corner neighborhood. The station was located on the south side of the tracks west of Centre Street. A second track was added in 1839, and in 1843 the railroad began offering season fares for around $60, making it one of the first commuter rail systems. Newton Corner was among the most popular stations, with ridership of 26,000 in 1866. A village petition around 1870 resulted in the station being renamed as simply Newton. Third and fourth tracks through the station were built in 1884. Around this time, a new station building was built in the Richardsonian Romanesque style. The Boston & Worcester became part of the Boston and Albany Railroad in 1867, which itself was leased by the New York Central Railroad in 1900. =Trolley station= A branch streetcars just south of the rotary in 1965 The first trolleys in Allston-Brighton had been a branch off the Cambridge Horse Railroad to Oak Square, and ran to Cambridge rather than downtown Boston. On June 13, 1896, trackage on Commonwealth Avenue (part of the future B branch) and Brighton Avenue opened as a direct electrified route to downtown; at the same time, the line was extended to just short of Newton Corner. The line begun running to Park Street in the new Tremont Street Subway on November 8, 1897. On May 21, 1898, the line was extended to Nonantum Square at Newton Corner, where it met lines running from Cambridge via Watertown. On December 9, 1912, the transfer point was changed from Nonantum Square to Watertown Yard. This completed the Watertown Line from Park Street to Watertown Yard - its route for the next half-century. =Closure= Location of former trolley platforms photographed in 2013 Both stations changed greatly when the Massachusetts Turnpike was extended from Route 128 in Weston to I-93 in downtown Boston. The highway occupied a significant portion of the right-of-way, dropping the Worcester Line from 4 to 2 tracks from Back Bay to Riverside. All local stops east of the Boston-Newton border were discontinued in April 1959; of the stations in Newton itself, Newton Corner was closed, Newtonville, West Newton, and Auburndale lost their depot buildings to construction but retained limited service, and Riverside, the furthest west, was unaffected. This marked the end of service on the Worcester Line to Newton Corner; it has not been a commuter rail stop during the MBTA era. In 1964, the exit 17 rotary was constructed at Newton Corner. Expecting little traffic at the intersection, the trolley tracks were placed in a counterflow lane, while the platforms were moved to the north side of the rotary in a dedicated median. However, the rotary proved to be busy and congested, resulting in frequent delays and automobile-trolley collisions. In 1967, the #69 trolley was renamed as the Green Line A branch. After a series of temporary bustitutions during the 1960s, the A branch was again \\"temporarily\\" substituted on June 21, 1969. However, the replacement route 57 bus became permanent and the trolleys never returned. The trackage was intact for non-revenue moves to Watertown Carhouse until 1994, but, except for rare fan trips, Newton Corner has not seen rail passengers since 1969. Bus connections The bus stop on the south side of the Newton Corner rotary in March 2013 The bus stop on the north side of the Newton Corner rotary in March 2013 Although no longer served by rail transport, Newton Corner is a major interchange for MBTA bus routes including the rail-replacement 57 and eight express buses. During morning rush hour, the eight express routes and two local routes combine such that over 60 buses traverse the rotary hourly, making Newton Corner one of the busiest MBTA bus stops. There are two bus stops on the rotary itself, with a large brick bench and shelter (more prominent than standard MBTA bus stops) on the southern (eastbound) side of the rotary and two standard shelters on the northern (westbound) part. Eleven routes stop at these locations: * : Dedham Mall‚Äì * : Watertown Yard‚Äì * : Watertown Yard‚Äì * : Brighton Center‚ÄìFederal Street & Franklin Street * : Watertown Yard‚ÄìCopley station * : Brighton Center‚ÄìCopley Square * : Watertown Yard‚ÄìFederal Street & Franklin Street * : Roberts‚ÄìFederal Street & Franklin Street * : Waverley Square‚ÄìFederal Street & Franklin Street * : Waltham Highlands‚ÄìFederal Street & Franklin Street * : Riverside station‚ÄìFederal Street & Franklin Street Routes 553, 554, 556, and 558 each loop one-and-one- half times around the rotary in order to stop at both the south and north bus stops on each run in order to serve passengers who do not wish to cross the fast-moving rotary traffic on foot. Similarly, outbound 502 and 504 buses loop completely around the rotary (except during the afternoon peak) before proceeding to Watertown. Routes 52, 57, and 193 only use the rotary stops in the southbound direction; northbound buses stop near the rotary on surface streets. Because these routes make local stops on both sides of the rotary, they do not make the extra loops. Routes 501 and 503 only stop at the rotary stops during afternoon peak outbound trips; inbound trips only use the route 57 stop on Park Street to the south. When proposals to reactivate the A branch were considered in the 1970s and 1980s, a likely possibility was that the trolleys would only return as far as Oak Square, with trolleybuses filling the gap between Watertown and Oak Square. The City of Newton did not approve of overhead lines, however, and the proposals never came to fruition. However, a limited version of the proposal was considered wherein the route 71 trolleybus would be extended from Watertown to Newton Corner. In the 2004 Program for Mass Transportation, the $1.5 million project was estimated to add 600 new daily transit riders but was given low priority compared to other bus expansion projects.

He also wrote a column for the Atlanta Journal and Constitution, \\"As I Was Saying\\", discussing news, events and gossip from the local Country clubs such as Piedmont Driving Club and Capitol City Club. And he gave lectures and readings of his poems throughout the South and Eastern USA at various colleges, clubs, and poetry societies. One of his most popular poems was \\"A Letter From the Front\\", the popularity was partially due to Margaret Mitchell (author of \\"Gone With The Wind\\") sending it to fans when they asked if Georgia is really like what it is in the novel. It was also published in the Saturday Evening Post, July 17, 1943. During his prime he traveled the world extensively providing with material. Though many of his poems were written about the home state of Georgia, particularly Sea Island, Georgia. He was president of the Atlanta Writers Club for two years, and for many years was considered for Poet Laureate of Georgia. In 1931, he won the American Poetry Society's prize for his poem, \\"Machines\\". And in 1941, he was short-listed for the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry. Later in life, he worked as an editor at the Department of Agriculture in Washington D.C. Encouraged by friends and fans he published a final farewell book, \\"The Poems of Daniel Whitehead Hicky\\" (1975), the year before he died.

Founded by the Religious Society of Friends in 1703, it fell into disuse until the 1840s when it was revived by the Hicksite Quaker community of Philadelphia, which played an important role in the abolition and early women's rights movements. The cemetery is currently operated by the Fair Hill Burial Corporation, which is owned by Quakers and neighborhood community members. History Sign at entrance William Penn gave 1250 acres in Pennsylvania to George Fox in 1681. Fox dedicated six acres in 1686 for a meeting house and burial ground near the current site of the burial ground. Burials began about 1707, but the site didn't develop into an active burial ground. The Green Street Monthly Meeting took control of the site in 1818. Following the Orthodox-Hicksite split, the three Hicksite meetings in Philadelphia in 1840 - Philadelphia Meeting, Spruce Street Meeting, Green Street Meeting - agreed to use the land for a burial ground. Starting in 1843, a Joint Committee on Interments oversaw the burial ground. The Fair Hill Meeting House was built nearby, on Cambria Street in the 1880s. Both the meetinghouse and the burial ground were sold to Ephesians Baptist Church in 1985, but in 1993 the burial ground was purchased by the Philadelphia Quarterly Meeting, which continues to own and maintain it.

After graduation, Naegele had her own drawing studio on Stuttgart‚Äôs Reinsburgstrasse. She became a much sought after graphic designer, stylist and book illustrator for well-known textile firms like Gr√∂ber-Neufra and the publisher Deutsche Verlagsgesellschaft Stuttgart. In 1934, Lilo Naegele won a contract to design the display window of star hairdresser Hugo Benner‚Äôs salon in the Stuttgart Wilhelmsbau.

From 1950, Lilo Rasch-Naegele was based in a modern villa to the west of Stuttgart in Wispelwald, Oberaichen. The villa was designed by Bodo Rasch for his family. Here, Lilo Rasch-Naegele devoted her initial creative energy to free, non- commercial painting, producing a remarkable number of oil paintings and a great mixture of experimental graphic work up until her sudden death in 1978. As of 2012, her work is undergoing an academic reappraisal as part of the administration of her estate. Collections Much of Rasch-Naegele's work can be found in businesses including Bally, Hoechst and Schiesser, in public collections such as the Kunstmuseum Stuttgart and in the town of Leinfelden. Pieces can also be found in a variety of regional and international private collections. Exhibitions From 1949 onwards, a number of individual and group exhibitions dedicated to Lilo Rasch-Naegele were featured in both the Stuttgart area and outside.

DynamoRIO targets user space applications under the Android, Linux, and Windows operating systems running on the AArch32, IA-32, and x86-64 instruction set architectures. DynamoRIO was originally created as a dynamic binary optimization system but has since been used for security, debugging, and analysis tools. DynamoRIO originated in a collaboration between Hewlett-Packard's Dynamo optimization system and the Runtime Introspection and Optimization (RIO) research groupThe RIO Project: Runtime Introspection and Optimization at MIT; hence the combined name \\"DynamoRIO\\". It was first released publicly as a proprietary binary toolkit in June 2002 and was later open-sourced with a BSD license in January 2009. Overview DynamoRIO is a process virtual machine that redirects a program's execution from its original binary code to a copy of that code. Instrumentation that carries out the actions of the desired tool are then added to this copy. No changes are made to the original program, which does not need to be specially prepared in any way. DynamoRIO operates completely at run time and handles legacy code, dynamically loaded libraries, dynamically generated code, and self-modifying code. DynamoRIO monitors all control flow to capture the entire execution of the target program. This monitoring adds overhead even when no tool is present. DynamoRIO's average overhead is 11 percent.Transparent Dynamic Instrumentation, Figure 4 Features DynamoRIO's API abstracts away the details of the virtualization process and focuses on monitoring or modifying the dynamic code stream of the program. A tool can insert trampolines into the program that invoke tool actions at specific program points. A tool can also insert instrumentation at the assembly language level, which provides fine-grained control over tool actions and tool performance. DynamoRIO supports adaptive optimization and adaptive instrumentation by allowing a tool to remove or modify its instrumentation at any point throughout the execution of the target program. DynamoRIO invokes tool-registered callbacks at a number of common program event points, such as thread creation, library loading, system calls, signals, or exceptions. Its API also allows inspecting the program's libraries and address space in addition to its code. DynamoRIO's API and event callbacks are designed to be cross-platform, enabling the same tool code to operate on both Windows and Linux and on both IA-32 and x86-64. DynamoRIO ensures tool transparency by isolating the tool's resources, such as its stack, memory, and file accesses, from the program upon which the tool is operating. DynamoRIO contains libraries that extend its API to provide symbol table access, function wrapping and replacing, and memory address tracing utilities. Tools The first tools built for DynamoRIO focused on dynamic optimization.An Infrastructure for Adaptive Dynamic Optimization A number of research tools have been built for a variety of purposes, including taint checkingTaintTrace: Efficient Flow Tracing with Dynamic Binary Rewriting and profiling.PiPA: Pipelined Profiling and Analysis on Multi-Core Systems =Program Shepherding= Applying DynamoRIO to the security field resulted in a technique called program shepherding.Secure Execution Via Program Shepherding The program shepherding instrumentation monitors the origin of each program instruction and the control flow between instructions in order to prevent a security exploit from taking control of the program. In 2003, program shepherding was commercialized as the brand-named Memory Firewall host intrusion prevention software in a startup company called Determina.

Background  Originally hailing from the San Francisco Bay Area, Cain directed his first feature, Naked Beneath the Water which he used to graduate the cinema program at San Francisco State in 1995. This film was a very low budget psychological horror film, was shunned by his colleagues at college, but sold well on VHS through underground horror magazines such as Film Threat and Alternative Cinema. In early 2002 that Cain saw many of the low budget horror titles originally released on VHS were finding new life on DVD. Re-shooting about 60% of Naked Beneath the Water he finally achieved proper distribution on DVD in 2008. Cain now resides in Los Angeles where he created Velvet Hammer Films with his longtime business partner, Jim Wright. Since 2008 he has gone on to direct six more films, Silent Night, Zombie Night, (with The Walking Dead alumnus Lew Temple) Breath of Hate, (which stars Jason Mewes, best known from the Kevin Smith films as \\"Jay\\") and SyFy fare such as Jurassic City, (with Ray Wise) Terror Birds, Eruption LA.

With scenery and costumes designed by Hugo Stevenson, it was first presented by Ballet Rambert at the Mercury Theatre, London, on 26 January 1936. It is considered to be the first of the genre of psychological ballets.David Vaughan, \\"Jardin aux Lilas,\\" in International Encyclopedia of Dance, edited by Selma Jeanne Cohen and others (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998), vol. 3, p. 597. History The inspiration for Chausson's Po√®me came from a novella by the Russian writer Ivan Turgenev, known to him in French as Le Chant de l'amour triomphant and in English as The Song of Triumphant Love, which concerns a set of intertwined relationships. Tudor tried setting his ballet to other compositions before realizing that Po√®me was a perfect fit for the situation he wished to portray.Donna Perlmutter, Shadowplay: The Life of Antony Tudor (New York: Viking, 1991), His ballet about unrequited love is as much about the necessity of people of the British upper classes to suppress their emotions and yield to the constraints of social convention. As a psychological study, it is a mirror of the interior monologue of its heroine, Caroline.Judith Chazin-Bennahum, The Ballets of Antony Tudor: Studies in Psyche and Satire (New York: Oxford University Press, 1994). Jardin aux lilas is an early example of Tudor's mastery of conveying profound psychological meaning and nuance through ballet vocabulary. Among his earlier works, it is also one of his most beloved. Mounted by numerous companies around the world, including American Ballet Theatre and the Paris Opera Ballet, it continues to be performed today. Synopsis The ballet is set at an evening garden party during the Edwardian era (1901‚Äì1910) in England. A young woman, Caroline, who is engaged to marry a man she does not love, has come to say goodbye to her friends and, particularly, Her Lover. She steals brief moments with him during the gathering, while The Man She Must Marry himself privately encounters An Episode in His Past, also present at the party. Attempts at intimacy are constantly interrupted by other guests. Caroline ultimately bids Her Lover a halted farewell as The Man She Must Marry takes her on his arm and leads her away in their betrothal of convenience. Her Lover, having secretly given Caroline a gift of lilacs at the last possible moment, is left alone as the curtain closes.Elizabeth Sawyer, \\"The Enigmatic Garden: Antony Tudor's Jardin aux Lilas,\\" Dance Chronicle (New York), 26.1 (Spring 2001), pp. 31-84. Original cast Jardin aux lilas is ideally suited to performance in a small theater, where the audience has a clear view of the subtle, emotionally wrought exchanges among the four principal characters. The original cast included Maude Lloyd as Caroline, Hugh Laing as Her Lover, Tudor himself as The Man She Must Marry, and Peggy van Praagh as An Episode in His Past. In January 1940, the American premiere was given by Ballet Theatre during its inaugural season in New York, with Tudor and Laing in their original roles, Viola Essen as Caroline, and Karen Conrad as An Episode in His Past.Vaughan, \\"Jardin aux Lilas,\\" in International Encyclopedia of Dance (1998), vol. 3, p. 597.

In association with Sampuun of Tambunan, he was one of the key figures involved in getting the British North Borneo Company to actively govern the interior region of the then North Borneo (later Sabah). Biography Kina was born in 1840 in Bandukan, Keningau. He was the eldest son in his family and was also known as Botut among relatives. He grew up doing farming and small businesses. His life changed when he obtained a shiny stone known as the Kumala. The event occurred when he followed his father to Kimanis and Bongawan to sell their farm goods, which were mainly cotton. In order to travel to the main trading center at that time, people would have to walk on foot across the Crocker range for days through hills and mountains. After a day's journey, they rested on an area close to the river. They eventually camped for the night. During the night, Agiu, one of the group members and Kina went to fish at the river. That night, he had a dream about obtaining the Kumala at the same spot where he had caught a fish. He went to the river and found the mystic stone. When Kina reached adulthood, he became more involved in the cotton business and ended up selling at the same place where he used to trade with his father and friends. His business soon expanded and involved more goods such as rubber and clothes until he eventually was able to open a shop in Papar. Having limited knowledge in business, he first attempt failed but it didn't stop him from trying again. He opened two more shops in Keningau and Sapulut, but he went bankrupt again. He finally decided to return to his former business and spend most of his time with his family in Bandukan, Keningau. In 1915, Kina was given the title OKK (Orang Kaya-Kaya) for his leadership in doing his job with the BCC (British Chartered Company). He was appointed to lead a negotiation in Rundum to promote peace among the locals and the company. Tribe clashes in Rundum were common in those days and many people were killed in the war. The war started when the BBC began imposing high and unnecessary taxes to the people especially the poor ones. Kina and his nephew Musad tried to reach an agreement with the locals, but only half of the people were willing to pay the taxes. During the visit, one of the villagers befriended Musad and offered to bring him and his group to a good hunting ground in the area. Musad accepted the offer. However, they were ambushed in the jungle by a group called Alison and Musad was badly injured while the others have either fled or died. Musad was able to escape with his life, but died before reaching Kina. The story finally reached the BCC and they decided to take stern action against the people. Kina and his troops were given guns and ammunition and this led to the Rundum war. Many were killed in action, but a few survived by hiding in caves. This did not stop the troops from hunting them down. Knowing that the villagers used the river as a food and water source, they poisoned the river, killing even more people Those that did survive, were also killed and decapitated as proof of their victory to the British. The skulls were said to be kept by one of Kina's children and were also said to be used in certain ceremony. Kina played a role in the war against Mat Salleh in Tambunan in 1874 to 1900, but the whole story was never documented.

Early life  Rolle was the eldest son of John Rolle, son and heir apparent of Sir John Rolle of Stevenstone, and his wife Lady Christiana Bruce, daughter of Robert Bruce, 1st Earl of Ailesbury and 2nd Earl of Elgin. Rolle's father died on 22 April 1689 during the lifetime of his father, and his mother married secondly Sir Robert Gayer, KB, of Buckinghamshire. Thus he was heir to his grandfather Sir John Rolle on his death in 1706. The Rolle family was one of the richest and most powerful in Devon and owned several dozen manors, their most ancient holding being Stevenstone near Great Torrington in the north of the county, whilst Bicton in the east was the centre of another large block of territory. Career Rolle was returned as Member of Parliament for Callington, a pocket borough of the Rolle family, at the two general elections of 1701. At the 1702 English general election he was returned as Tory MP for Devon. He was returned at the 1705 English general election and voted against the Court candidate as Speaker on 25 October 1705. Cruickshanks, Eveline, biography of Robert Rolle published in History of Parliament, House of Commons 1690-1715 Rolle married on 19 March 1705 Elizabeth Duke (died 1716), daughter of Richard Duke (1652‚Äì1733),Vivian, p.312, Duke of Otterton; given incorrectly as Edward Duke on p.656, Rolle MP, of Otterton, Devon, which manor adjoined the Rolle seat of Bicton.Like the Rolles, the Duke family came to prominence during the reign of King Henry VIII and had also acquired manors in Devon at the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Richard Duke's children all predeceased him without issue and his estates were inherited by a distant cousin whose own male line was also rapidly extinguished. On his marriage Robert received an annual settlement of ¬£1,500 from his grandfather Sir John Rolle. On his grandfather's death in 1706 Rolle inherited the Rolle estates, including the two principal seats of Stevenstone and Bicton. It was soon discovered that the estate was encumbered by liabilities of about ¬£15,000, comprising debts, legacies and portions. It thus became essential to realise some of the assets, which were however tied- up in trusts and entails. With his two brothers, he petitioned parliament on 11 February 1708 to obtain a private Act of Parliament enabling them to break the trusts in order to make these sales. At the 1708 British general election Rolle was returned again as MP for Devon. After the \\"Rolle's Estate Bill\\" Parliamentary Archives, \\"Rolle's Estate Bill\\", HL/PO/JO/10/6/144/2446 was passed in 1710, Rolle was enabled to sell some out-lying parts of the estate and re-invest any surplus proceeds in purchases by the same trust in lands situated more conveniently. As a Tory, he voted against the impeachment of Henry Sacheverell in 1710. Death and legacy Rolle died on 18 August 1710 after having become ill at the Exeter Assizes allegedly from a \\"surfeit of drinking\\" and died \\"of convulsion fits\\". He was buried at Bicton and his heir was his younger brother John Rolle (1679‚Äì1730), MP. His nephew Dennis Rolle (died 1797) of Stevenstone, later purchased in 1786 the manors of Otterton and East Budleigh from the heirs of the last male of the Duke family. Monument in Barnstaple Statue of Queen Anne given by Robert Rolle in 1708 to the Corporation of Barnstaple. Queen Anne's Walk, Barnstaple In 1708 Robert Rolle donated to the Corporation of Barnstaple, Devon, a large stone statue of Queen Anne, the victorious monarch of the recent Battle of Blenheim in 1704, which was placed atop the newly constructed Mercantile Exchange, which thenceforth bore the name Queen Anne's Walk. Underneath the statue, possibly intended to be free-standing and not on top of this building, is its original base, now seated somewhat incongruously above the Royal Arms. On the base is an escutcheon showing a cartouche with the arms of Rolle, now much worn, above which is the Rolle crest: A cubit arm erect vested or charged with a fess indented cotised azure in the hand a roll of parchment. On either side of the Rolle arms is a seated naked, disheveled and shackled French prisoner of war, behind whom is a centrally placed antique trophy of arms consisting of captured French weapons (two canon, muskets, a club, a halberd and a helmet etc.) and two lowered French standards on either side. The imagery is reminiscent of the sculptures of two French captives atop the central pediment of Blenheim Palace, built for the Duke of Marlborough, the victorious English commander at that battle. The original source for both is imagery from the classical world, as visible for example on Roman coins. On each side of the base of the statue of Queen Anne is an escutcheon showing the arms of Rolle impaling Duke, the arms of his wife. Immediately below the feet of the Queen is a tablet on which is inscribed the following Latin text: \\"Anna, Intemeratae fidei testimonium Roberti Rolle de Stephenstone in agro Devoniensi Armigeri MDCCVIII\\" (\\"Anne, a testament of the undefiled faith of Robert Rolle, Esquire, of Stevenstone in the land of Devonshire, 1708\\"). The gift of this statue appears to have prompted the Corporation to build the mercantile exchange, financed by a dozen or so of the leading merchants whose arms are sculpted within the frieze, on the quay now known as Queen Anne's Walk, on top of which sits the statue. The inscription was transcribed by the Devon topographer Rev. John Swete in his \\"Journals\\".Travels in Georgian Devon: the Journals of John Swete, Vol. 1, p.33 ReferencesSources *Vivian, Lt.Col.

Early years Ish Ledesma was born in Cuba and migrated to Miami as a child. He was influenced by the ubiquitous Latin sounds, popular within his community. He also enjoyed the rock and roll revolution that was playing out both nationally and internationally. In the early 1970s, Ledesma was hired by Henry Stone as a session artist. His credits include guitar on Gwen McCrae's disco hit \\"Rockin' Chair\\". =Foxy= In 1976, Ledesma convinced Stone to record a band he was forming, resulting in the band Foxy's release of their self-titled debut album. The album, produced by Ray Mart√≠nez, had two 12\\" singles released, \\"People Fall In Love While Dancing\\" and \\"Let's Love.\\" Both songs were regional hits, but with only minor appeal nationally. However, the band's follow-up album, Get Off was a major breakthrough, featuring the title track, which went to number one on the R&B; chart and also cracked the top ten on the pop chart. Although the group would score another hit the following year with the tune \\"Hot Number,\\" follow-up releases were less successful. Foxy disbanded early in the 1980s, as disco began to wane.

She was appointed to Witwatersrand in 2000, following a 25-year career as a researcher, teacher and senior administrator in higher education.  Education  Birley was educated at Limavady Grammar School, in Northern Ireland, and obtained a BSc and a MSc in mathematics at Sussex University, graduating in 1974. She was awarded a D. Phil by the University of Ulster in 1983 and was made an honorary Doctor of Science Sussex University in 2002.  Early appointments and research In 1974, Birley was appointed to the DHSS Health Services Research Unit at the University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne. In 1977 she was appointed lecturer in statistics at the London School of Economics. She became interested in pedagogy as a result of being asked to teach a Master's class of sociologists, in finding new graphical ways to communicate her subject to a reluctant audience. In 1978 she returned to Ireland, to lead an interdisciplinary study of nurse education in the clinical setting at the University of Ulster. In 1984, she became founding Director of that university's Research Centre for Applied Health Studies, and in 1986 she was promoted to a senior lectureship in mathematics. While there, she published the first evidence of the huge exodus of well-qualified school leavers from Ulster in those years.Cormack, R, Osborne, R, Reid, N G and Williamson, A.

Early life Elise Justine Bayard was born in Fishkill, New York, Bayard was the daughter of Robert Bayard (1797‚Äì1878) and Elizabeth McEvers, both members of old New York families. Her father, along with her uncle, Robert Fulton, were partners in the ferry from Brooklyn to New York. Another uncle was Stephen Van Rensselaer IV, the last patroon of the Manor of Rensselaerswyck. Her paternal grandfather, William Bayard Jr. (1761‚Äì1826), was a prominent New York City banker who was a close friend to Alexander Hamilton, who died at his Greenwich Village home after his famous duel with Aaron Burr. Career She penned what scholars have called \\"unremarkable\\" verse about common subjects. She published frequently in The Knickerbocker and the Literary World and was identified as a promising young author in a column written by Sarah Josepha Hale. It is difficult to definitively assign many poems to her as they were often unsigned or only initialed with her maiden initials, E.J.B., or her married ones, E.B.C.. An example of her sonnet is: > Sprung from the arid rock devoid of soil, > In vig'rous life I saw one blade of wheat, > Bearing its precious grain, full-lobed and sweet, > Remote from eye of him whose lusty toil > In other harvest recompense hath found; > And it seemed good to me that labour should > Beyond its aim or asking thus abound, > While reaping to itself its purchased food: > So, too, from him, who the prolific thought > Sows in the cultured field of intellect, > A wandering breath its course may intersect, > And bear an embryo with rich promise fraught > Within some barren soul to germinate, > And fill with fruitful life what else were desolate. Personal life On February 13, 1849, she married Fulton Cutting (1816‚Äì1875), the son of William Cutting (1773‚Äì1820) and Gertrude Livingston (1778‚Äì1864). Her husband, Fulton, a lawyer and vestryman at Trinity Church, was the younger brother of Francis Brockholst Cutting (1804‚Äì1870), a U.S. Representative from New York, the nephew of Henry Walter Livingston (1768‚Äì1810), and the grandson of Walter Livingston (1740‚Äì1797), and their sons were: * William Bayard Cutting (1850‚Äì1912), a financier * Robert Fulton Cutting (1852‚Äì1934), a financier She died in New York.

Karly‚Äôs Law is named for a three-year-old girl, Karly Sheehan, who died as a result of child abuse and neglect in 2005. Background Karly's Law was first introduced as House Bill 3328 in 2007. It was created as a result of the death of Karly Sheehan in 2005. Karly was a three-year-old girl who died as a result of neglect and abuse from her mother's boyfriend, Shawn Wesley Field. Her situation was brought to the attention of the Department of Health and Human Services as well as Law Enforcement, who interviewed Karly's mother, father and mother's significant other, and Karly twice and concluded that her injuries were not a result of child abuse.Zacharias, Karen. A Silence of Mockingbirds. MacAdam/Cage Procedural history The bill was proposed and sponsored by Rep Sara Gelser in 2007. It passed the Oregon House of Representatives unanimously on 30 April 2007, where it went on to the Oregon state Senate Human Services Committee. The Oregon Senate also passed the bill unanimously, and it was sent back to the House with minor clarifying amendments. The House passed these amendments, and Gov. Ted Kulongoski signed it into law. Law requirements The law mandates children with suspicious injuries during the course of an abuse investigation receive medical treatment within 48 hours. The Oregon Department of Human Services and trained medical providers are to assess the injuries. The law sets protocol and procedures if abuse is suspected. Legacy After Karly's law was passed, the quantity of children who have been assessed for abuse in the state of Oregon rose by 140%. This does not imply a rise in the child abuse rates in the State of Oregon, simply that the number of children being inspected for possible child abuse-related injuries has gone up. In 2009, Oregon had 67,885 total referrals for child abuse and neglect. Of those, 28,584 reports were referred for investigation. Prior to the passage of HR 3328 in 2007, these numbers were: 46,524 total referrals for child abuse and neglect, 23,529 were referred for investigation in 2004. Further reading * Zacharias, Karen.

Background On 28 October 2011, at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting held in Perth, Western Australia, the heads of government of the 16 Commonwealth realms, which share Elizabeth II as head of state, announced that they would introduce legislation in all 16 countries to end the primacy of males over females and the disqualification of persons married to Catholic spouses in the succession to the Crown. In a letter to the other realms' heads of government, prior to the Perth Agreement, British Prime Minister David Cameron additionally proposed to limit the requirement to obtain the monarch's permission to marry to the first six people in line to the throne. Debate Monarchy New Zealand welcomed the Bill, stating \\"The much-needed changes to the royal succession will remove gender discrimination by allowing women equal right to the throne.\\" The Republican Movement of Aotearoa New Zealand described the changes as \\"too little, too late\\" and was critical of the continuation of the rule preventing Catholics being monarch. Clauses The bill's provisions are to implement in New Zealand law changes to the succession agreed to at the 2011 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. Specifically it: * provides for the succession of the Crown to be determined without regard to the sex of those born after 29 October 2011 * abolishes the exclusion from the throne of those who marry Roman Catholics * repeals the Royal Marriages Act and substitutes a requirement that the first six individuals in line to the throne obtain the consent of the Sovereign to marry * validates certain marriages that occurred in violation of the Royal Marriages Act. To implement those provisions, the bill provides for amending the Bill of Rights 1689, the Act of Settlement 1701 and the Imperial Laws Application Act 1988 in so far as they apply in New Zealand.  Bill stages  The Bill was introduced into Parliament on 18 February 2013, by Minister of Justice Judith Collins, and it passed its first reading on 2 July 2013, with 104 votes in favour and 15 abstentions. It was then referred to the Justice and Electoral Committee, which reported on 31 October 2013. Its second and third readings were on 10 December 2013.

It was a one-room school made of lumber and located on the north side of Clanton Street between Fifth and Sixth streets. Just one year after it was built (1890), W. J. Melton organized a Baptist church group which met there on Sundays and for socials. The school outgrew the building and had to move, but the church remained there until 1931. In 1903, Buckeye built a four-room, two-story, red brick building with an outdoor stairway with a woodshed under the stairway. It was just east of the original school and across from the present elementary school (211. S. Seventh Street, Buckeye, AZ 85326.) There were two large rooms on the ground floor and two upstairs.

He was born poor but discovered photography in his teens and early 20s, deciding to study it seriously after his attempt to photograph the death of a coworker failed. He was sent to the Academia Mexicana de Artes y Ciencias Cinematogr√°ficas by magazine director Edmundo Vald√©s who recognized Garc√≠a's talent. Most of Garc√≠a's career was related to photojournalism, working with publications both inside and outside of Mexico. However, a substantial amount of his work had more artistic and critical qualities. Many of these were exhibited in galleries and museums, with sixty five individual exhibitions during his lifetime. This not only included portraits of artists and intellectuals (including a famous portrait of David Alfaro Siqueiros at Lecumberri Prison) but also portraits of common and poor people. He was also the first photojournalist to explicitly criticize Mexico's elite, either making fun of them or contrasting them to the very poor. Life Hector Garcia as a young man H√©ctor Garc√≠a Cobos was born on August 23, 1923 in Mexico City to Amparo Cobo Soberanes from the State of Mexico and Ramiro Garc√≠a do Porto from Portugal. He grew up in the poor and dangerous Candelaria de los Patos neighborhood in a house that has since been replaced by apartment buildings. His family was extremely poor. He received little formal education as a youth, with his mother teaching him how to read. As a child, he much preferred to wander the streets of his neighborhood, and even beyond to meet and talk to people. This led to his mother calling him ‚Äúpata de perro‚Äù (lit. dog's foot), which later became the title of his autobiography. His propensity to escape from the house even drove his mother to tie him to the bed, but he said that he always found a way to escape. As a young child he went as far as the air field that was in the Balbuena section of the city, selling gum to the aviators. He was adopted as a ‚Äúmascot‚Äù and even given a ride in one of the planes when he was only six. At age seven, he hitchhiked his way to Veracruz . In 1937, when he was fourteen, he was sent to a juvenile correctional facility in Tlalpan, where he remained until he was eighteen. Here, he received his first camera, a gift from one of the facility's directors. In 1942 he headed to the United States in search of work. On the way, he had to sell his shoes in order to eat, crossing the border barefoot. He then stowed away on a train to head to Washington, D.C. In the United States he worked in Maryland, New York, Philadelphia and Washington on rail lines, taking pictures as a hobby. One of his coworkers was run over by a train, and Garcia took pictures of the body, attracted to the sight of it on the snow. However, the pictures did not come out and because of this disappointment, he decided to study photography seriously. He remained in the United States until he was deported in 1945. When he returned to Mexico, he began to work at Celuloide magazine as a laborer. The magazine was directed by storyteller and journalist Edmundo Vald√©s, who recognized Garc√≠a's talent and sent him to study at the Academia de Artes y Ciencias Cinematogr√°ficas. There Garc√≠a studied along with fellow photographer Nacho L√≥pez under Manuel √Ålvarez Bravo and Gabriel Figueroa, both still photography and movie making. Garcia is quoted as saying that Alvarez Bravo left him with ‚Äúmore than just the basics of the discipline but rather a concept of life, a path with limitless possibilities. I had wings but he taught me to fly.‚Äù . During his career, he made friends with artists and intellectuals such as Salvador Novo, Diego Rivera, Fernando Ben√≠tez, Frida Kahlo, Octavio Paz, Alberto Gironella, Carlos Monsiv√°is and Jos√© Luis Cuevas along with entertainment stars such as Pedro Infante, Mar√≠a F√©lix, Tin Tan and Tongolele . However, he said that he never considered himself as an artist or intellectual. He never had or wanted his own studio with fixed lights and screens. In 1954, he married Mar√≠a S√°nchez who was also a photographer. The couple had three children, Yuri, Amparo and H√©ctor Garc√≠a S√°nchez who is also a photographer.http://www.fotoperiodismo.org/GALERIA%20HECTOR%20GARCIA/OBRA%20FOTOGRAFICA/obra.htm His wife said that he once mentioned that he wanted to be buried in a cemetery he saw in Xochimilco, with a window on the casket so he can continue watching Mexico City. He died of cardiac arrest at his home on June 2. 2012. Career Garc√≠a's primary career was that of a photojournalist. He began working as such in 1945, while still in school. For over sixty years, his work appeared in publications in both Mexico and abroad such as Cine Mundial, Exc√©lsior, Unom√°suno, ¬°Siempre!, Time and Paris Match and collaborated with international news agencies such as Reuters, France Press, United Press International and Associated Press . During his career, he covered a number of major events. In 1958, he covered a railroad strike led by Demetrio Vallejo. One photo from this event, a sequence showing the beating of a man during a protest won him his first of three National Journalism Prizes. The next major event was the student uprising in 1968. Pressure from the military and police limited him to taking only three rolls of film during the uprising, but his work won him the second of the three prizes. He also covered the presidential campaigns of Luis Echeverr√≠a and Jos√© L√≥pez Portillo . In 1969, he accompanied writer Fernando Ben√≠tez to the Sierra Mayor in Nayarit as part of the latter's research into indigenous communities there. However, not all of Garc√≠a's work was suitable or intended for newspapers and magazines. While still study under Manuel Alvarez Bravo, director Enrique Borrego gave him the chance to work with a newspaper that covered social events. His first notable photo came from this called ‚ÄúNuestra se√±ora sociedad‚Äù which shows a woman in a strapless dress, which is stepped on by a man. These photos, which had aspects of artistic and/or social criticism, eventually became the focus of a number of exhibits. Famous photos of this type include ‚ÄúEl ni√±o en el vientre de concretos‚Äù ‚ÄúLos mecapaleros de La Merced,‚Äù Cartucho quemado (a photo of the face of a Zapatista), one of a child with a machete in Atencingo, Puebla in 1960, a child using a large leaf as a rain cape in Veracruz in 1965, various photos related to the student uprising in 1968, and photos of Huichols and Coros celebrating Holy Week for a series of books by Fernando Ben√≠tez. He began exhibiting photos in 1955 in galleries and over the course of his career had sixty five individual exhibitions and participated in a larger number of collective shows in both Mexico and abroad. Early important shows include \\"Rostros de Mexico\\" (1960), \\"Imagenes de Mexico\\" (Paris, 1963), \\"Vision del mundo maya\\" (Madrid, 1964), \\"Una vision de Mexico\\" and \\"La nueva grandeza mexicana\\" (Mexico City, 1966 and 1967, respectively) . His later exhibits included ‚ÄúIconos‚Äù at the Museo de Arte Moderno (1998), Hector Garcia y su tiempo at the Centro de la Imagen (2003), and C√°mara Obrera at the Museo de la Ciudad de M√©xico (2009). Garc√≠a's work can be found in major public and private collections including those of the Museo Nacional de Antropolog√≠a, Museo de la Fotograf√≠a in Mexico, Biblioth√®que Nationale in Paris, the Library of Congress in Washington, the Vatican Museums and the Wittliff collections . However, the largest collection is with the foundation Garc√≠a created with his wife in Mexico City, which has over a million images. He did a number of photographic portraits in famous people in Mexico which included Diego Rivera, Carlos Monsiv√°is, David Alfaro Siqueiros (the most notable being the one while in Lecumberri Prison) and Elena Poniatowska . His work has been used to illustrate various books including Mexique, Editions du Seuil by Salvador Novo (1964), Nueva Grandeza Mexicana by Fernando Ben√≠tez (1967) and Los Indios de M√©xico (1970) . He taught at the Centro Universitario de Estudios Cinematogr√°ficos (CUEC) of UNAM . He worked on still shots for Luis Bu√±uel for several of his movies. Later in his career he did work in filmmaking winning several awards for his cinematography. Garc√≠a received Mexico's National Journalism Award three times. In 1959 he received his first for a photo of the 1958 protests of teachers, students and workers in solidarity with a railroad strike. This photo was not published in news accounts at the time but rather later in a magazine called Ojo: una revista que ve. His second came for his photographs of the student uprising in 1968, many of which were published in Carlos Monsiv√°is‚Äô book D√≠as de guardar and Elena Poniatowska's La noche de Tlatelolco. He won the prize for best ethnographic film at the Popoli Festival in Florence, Italy, in 1972. In 2003, he received the National Arts and Sciences Award from CONACULTA for his life's work. Shortly after his death, Canal 22 produced a show in tribute to the photographer, which included interviews, reports and testimonies, and the Museo de Arte Moderno also held a retrospective of his work called Hector Garcia: visualidades inesperadas. Artistry Garc√≠a is considered to be one of the most important photojournalists of Mexico. He called photojournalism the most dangerous and most attractive professions in the world, also describing it as that of ‚Äúthe dog with two sandwiches.‚Äù Trapped between the demands of information and aesthetics, photojournalists can miss the news while looking for the angle or light they desire (and vice versa).‚Äù . Carlos Monsiv√°is nicknamed him the ‚Äúfot√≥grafo de la ciudad‚Äù (photographer of the city (Mexico City)) . For many years Garc√≠a spent days photographing the streets of Mexico City, often in the early morning when the streets were mostly deserted. He spent so much time running around the city to take photographs that an acquaintance in 1959 suggested that he get roller skates. He wanted to document everything he saw and mostly did. However, he did not take pictures indiscriminately, instead he looked for images with political, ethical aesthetic, journalistic, historic and even erotic value. His work not only included images of famous people and Mexico's elite, but much of his work is dedicated to cabaret dancers, laborers, peasants and street children. His concern for the lower classes and everyday Mexican life was something he inherited from Manuel Alvarez Bravo. He followed a philosophy called anti-pintoresquismo, avoiding the picturesque, which he shared with a number of other photographers such as Nacho L√≥pez and the Hermanos Mayo. His work often contains political and social critique with a leitmotiv of destitute children and poor people as one of the first photojournalists to explicitly criticize the country's social elite. Much of his work expresses the contradictions of Mexican life under the one-party rule of the PRI. With Nuestra Se√±ora Sociedad, he pokes fun at the wealthy, as a man in a tuxedo steps on the train of the dress worn by a woman. He also took photographs that showed the sharp class distinctions of Mexico. For example, in ‚ÄúCada quien si grito‚Äù (Each with their own cry), Garc√≠a contrasts a poor rural couple with loads of goods to sell, followed by a couple in elegant evening clothes. Also important were his portraits of a number of artists and intellectuals of the 20th century. One of his most celebrated was that of painter David Alfaro Siqueiros behind the bars of the Lecumberri prison in 1960. He took pictures of Frida Kahlo in her bed as well as in her coffin at her funeral. He did many portraits of Dolores del R√≠o and photographed Tin Tan nude in the shower after a show in Havana in 1953. His work has become valued not only for its information but also as works of art. Although Diego Rivera called him an excellent artist, Garcia did not like the title, considering himself a photojournalist. What I've done practically all my life is to be a witness and to make graphic testimonies of the movements and struggles of the social classes in Mexico. This continues to be the most important motive I have to do photography. He said that all one needs to be a good photographer is ‚Äúeyes‚Äù with the intention of seeing, the ability to see and to reflection on what is seen. ‚ÄúThe whole world thinks that to take super photographs, one needs super knowledge, super equipment, super locations and with the humble ‚Äúdisposable‚Äù camera that is at home, never make anything interesting...‚Äù He stated that the technology of photography has made the basics accessible to children and knowing all of it is not necessary to know when you have a good picture or not. He himself often took pictures with nothing more than a Nikon snapshot camera, saying he needed nothing more. He quoted Pancho Villa who said to his troops when asked what to do ‚ÄúYou shoot, then check what has happened.‚Äù Mar√≠a y H√©ctor Garc√≠a Foundation In 2008, he created the Mar√≠a y H√©ctor Garc√≠a Foundation along with his wife, located in Mexico City. The foundation administers and promotes investigation into the archives of Garcia's work, as well as permanent and temporary exhibitions of the photographer's and others‚Äô work. The facility has five halls for permanent and temporary exhibits. The foundation holds the largest collection of Garc√≠a's work with over a million images on 30,000 rolls of film taken from 1943 to 2008, with most dating from the 1950s to the 1970s. As of his death in 2012, only 4,000 images were digitized including 1,731 from the Iconos exhibition. After, Garc√≠a's death, the Mexican government announced a project to preserve, categorize and digitalize the entire collection.

It subsequently undertook requirements for the other services as appropriate. It existed until 1971 when it was absorbed within the Admiralty Surface Weapons Establishment. History In 1795, the post of Hydrographer of the Navy was created. He became responsible to the First Naval Lord for producing charts, 'Sailing Directions', 'Notices to Mariners', tide tables and light lists and for supplying chronometers, compasses and other scientific instruments to HM ships. He was also responsible for naval meteorology and for the Admiralty's links with the Meteorological Office. In 1820, the Hydrographer was responsible for the Observatory, being advised by a Board of Visitors. In 1842, a Compass Branch as part of the Hydrographic Department was established. In 1911, The Compass Branch was affiliated to the Controller of the Navy's Department. Its work in connection with terrestrial magnetism was transferred to the Royal Observatory Greenwich when it was renamed the Compass Observatory. In 1917, it moved to Ditton Park and used the house and its immediate grounds when the compass branch was elevated to a department. The Radio Research Station of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research was co-located at Ditton Park, and provided basic information in this field. By 1968 it formed part of the Controllers Department and was renamed the Compass Directorate. In 1971, it was merged as part of the Admiralty Surface Weapons Establishment (ASWE) within the navigation division. The site was later renamed as Admiralty Research Establishment (ARE) Slough, and in its final years its became part of the Defence Research Agency (DRA) from 1991, and the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) from 1995.

It is a uniquely French psychiatric diagnostic term with a long history in FranceCrocq, Marc-Antoine (2015) French perspectives on psychiatric classification Dialogues Clin Neurosci.;17:51-57. and various French speaking nations: Caribbean, e.g. Haiti, Guadeloupe, Antilles and Francophone Africa.Eynaud, Michel (2015) Histoire des repr√©sentations de la sant√© mentale aux Antilles. La migration des th√©rapeutes Dans L'information psychiatrique 2015/1 (Volume 91). The term BD was originally coined and described by Valentin Magnan (1835-1916), fell into relative disuse and was later revived by Henri Ey (1900-1977).Schioldann, Johan (2011) Classic Text No. 87 ‚ÄòPsychogenic Psychoses‚Äô by August Wimmer (1936): Part 1, History of Psychiatry 22(3) 344‚Äì 367.  Terminology  The French word bouff√©e is often translated as a puff or waft (as of air), but can also mean a flash, rush or surge. Chabrol translates the word d√©lirante as 'delusional'.Chabrol, op.cit. Other common dictionary definitions include less useful meanings such as 'crazy or incoherent'. A reasonable English translation of the term bouff√©e d√©lirante is a 'delusional flash'.  Description  Bouff√©e d√©lirante is \\"an acute, brief nonorganic psychosis that typically presents with a sudden onset of fully formed, thematically variable delusions and hallucinations against a background of some degree of clouding of consciousness, unstable and fluctuating affect, and spontaneous recovery with some probability of relapse.\\" Jablensky, Assen (2001) Classification of Nonschizophrenic Psychotic Disorders: A Historical Perspective Current Psychiatry Reports 2001, 3:326‚Äì331. The following criteria have been suggested for a diagnosis of BD: a) abrupt onset, b) polymorphic delusions, emotional changes, mood swings, depersonalization, derealization and/or hallucinations, c) complete remission within weeks or a few months, d) exclusion of organic causation, alcohol or drug use, e) no psychiatric antecedents with the exception of a previous episode of bouff√©e d√©lirante.Castagnini, Augusto & Gian Maria Galeazzi (2016) Acute and transient psychoses: clinical and nosological issues BJPsych Advances, vol. 22, 292‚Äì300. American academic investigators proposed the following definition in 2011: \\"The French concept of bouff√©e d√©lirante refers to conditions with a sudden onset marked by prominent delusions with hallucinations, confusion, anxiety and affective symptoms. Symptoms vary rapidly, perhaps even by the hour, and there is a rapid return to the premorbid state of health.\\" Nugent, Katie et al, (2011) Non-affective acute psychoses: Uncertainties on the way to DSM-V and ICD-11 Curr Psychiatry Rep.June ; 13(3): 203‚Äì210. A frequently quoted authority on BD, P. Pichot (H√¥pital Sainte Anne, Paris) provides this description of BD: # sudden onset: 'a bolt from the blue' # manifold delusions without recognizable structure and cohesiveness with/without hallucinations # clouding of consciousness associated with emotional instability # absence of physical signs. # rapid return to pre-morbid level of functioning.Pichot, P (1986) The Concept of 'Bouff√©e d√©lirnate' with Special Reference to the Scandinavian Concept of Reactive Psychosis. Psychopathology 19, 35-43. Pichot's criteria can be refined further with these typical clinical characteristics: * age: usually between 20-40 years of age * onset: acute without prior mental illness (with the exception of previous episodes of bouff√©e d√©lirante) * past history: no chronic mental disturbance after resolution of the BD episode. * typical symptoms: delusions and/or hallucinations of any type. Depersonalization/derealization and/or confusion * depression and/or elation * symptoms quite variable from day to day and even hour to hour. * not due to alcohol, drug use, or organic mental disorder.Pillmann, Frank et al, (2003) Bouff√©e d√©lirante and ICD-10 acute and transient psychoses: a comparative study, Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry, 37:327‚Äì333.  Formal classification  In 1968 the French national organization INSERM (Institut National de la Sant√© et de la Recherche M√©dicale) classification of mental illness referenced two types of BD in their category 'acute delusional psychoses and confusional states' viz. reactive bouff√©e d√©lirante and bouff√©e d√©lirante (Magnan's type).Garrab√©, Jean (2013) ¬´ La Classification fran√ßaise des troubles mentaux et la Classification internationale des maladies : historique comparatif ¬ª, L'information psychiatrique, 2013/4 (Volume 89), p. 319-326. DOI : 10.3917/inpsy.8904.0319. URL : https://www.cairn.info/revue-l- information-psychiatrique-2013-4-page-319.htm This classification scheme has been largely replaced by the two nosological systems discussed below. The World Health Organization edition of the International Classification of Disease 10th edition:version 2019 (ICD-10, CIM-10 en fran√ßais), lists BD as the subentry \\"Bouff√©e d√©lirante without symptoms of schizophrenia or unspecified\\" under diagnosis code F23: Acute and Transient Psychotic Disorders subsection, F23.0: Acute polymorphic psychotic disorder without symptoms of schizophrenia. International Edition ICD-10 (2019) URL : https://icd.who.int/browse10/2019/en#/F23.1 It is likely that the use of the term BD in French clinical psychiatry will decline further with the proposed 2022 implementation of ICD-11 (which was released in May 2019.) In contrast to the ICD-10, the term BD does not appear anywhere in ICD-11. The closest clinical match for BD in the ICD-11 is code 6A23, 'Acute and transient psychotic disorder' which is defined as \\"...acute onset of psychotic symptoms that emerge without a prodrome and reach their maximal severity within two weeks. Symptoms may include delusions, hallucinations, disorganization of thought processes, perplexity or confusion, and disturbances of affect and mood. Catatonia-like psychomotor disturbances may be present. Symptoms typically change rapidly, both in nature and intensity, from day to day, or even within a single day. The duration of the episode does not exceed 3 months, and most commonly lasts from a few days to 1 month. The symptoms are not a manifestation of another health condition (e.g., a brain tumor) and are not due to the effect of a substance or medication on the central nervous system (e.g., corticosteroids), including withdrawal (e.g., alcohol withdrawal).\\"https://icd.who.int/browse11/l-m/en#/http%3a%2f%2fid.who.int%2ficd%2fentity%2f284410555 The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th edition (DSM-5) diagnostic category brief psychotic disorder is probably the closest analog of BD.Castagnini, op.cit. The French term BD is nowhere mentioned in DSM-5.American Psychiatric Association. (2013). Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. (5th Edition). Washington, DC.  Incidence  The frequency of BD diagnoses in French hospitals has been declining due to the widespread acceptance of international classification systems such as the ICD-10 and DSM-5. However, the BD diagnosis has been used as recently as 2019 in Le Groupe Hospitalier Universitaire Paris psychiatrie & neurosciences (GHU Paris), Maison Blanche Bichat XVIII.Chafa√Ø MD, Sofiane, Attending Psychiatrist (2019), Lettre de liaison (personal correspondence 07/17/2019), GHU Paris, Site Bichat, Maison Blanche. Older estimates of the incidence of BD in psychiatric hospitalizations ranges from 1-5%.Marneros, Andreas and Pillmann, Frank (2004) Acute and Transient Psychoses, Cambridge: Cambridge University PressPillmann (2003)op.cit. Psychiatric admission reviews show that 2-7% of first episode psychotic episodes are due to brief psychotic disorder; here serving as a surrogate diagnosis for BD. Castagnini, Augusto & Gian Maria Galeazzi (2016) Acute and transient psychoses: clinical and nosological issues BJPsych Advances, vol. 22, 292‚Äì300 Some authors state that the diagnostic category of BD can be eliminated because it can be fully integrated into the 'Polymorphic subgroup of Acute and Transient Psychotic Disorders' of the ICD-10.Marneros, op.cit.  Treatment  There are no current published guidelines in the English language psychiatric literature that discuss treatment for BD. A 2019 case of BD from GHU Paris treated the patient with largactil (chlorpromazine).Chafa√Ø, op.cit. Assuming that BPD is an equivalent diagnosis, treatment depends on the severity of the episode. Mildly affected patients may receive supportive management and observation with additional outpatient therapy. More severe illness may require inpatient hospitalization and pharmacologic treatment with benzodiazepines and/or antipsychotic medication, for example: risperidone, though no clinical trials have examined the efficacy of therapy for BPD.Mojtabai, Ramin (2018) Brief psychotic disorder, UpToDate, www.uptodate.com (accessed 03/24/20)  Prognosis  It is difficult to firmly establish the prognosis of first episode BD patients with respect to progression to other psychiatric illness or relapse to another psychotic episode. This is due to the fact that high quality follow-up studies of large cohorts of BD patients are unavailable in part because of the uncommon nature of the illness and non-standardization of diagnostic methods. Investigators attempting to define the prognosis in BD have used data from similar conditions, i.e. acute transient psychotic disorder (ATPD) and brief psychotic disorder (BPD). A meta-analysis involving 11,000 patients estimated the rate of recurrent psychotic episodes in ATPD and BPD patients was 51% at 30 months compared to first episode schizophrenia patients who had an 84% recurrence rate at 36 months. As suggested by the various definitions of BD discussed above, rapid recovery and return to pre-morbid level of function is expected, though quantitative data is lacking. Fusar-Poli, P.,et al (2016) Prognosis of Brief Psychotic Episodes: A Meta-analysis. JAMA Psychiatry, 73(3), 211-220  Society  Psychiatric illnesses comparable to the unique French BD can be seen in the cycloid psychosis of German speaking countries and the psychogenic psychosis in Scandinavia.Nugent,op.cit. It has been argued that acute and transient psychoses are more common in African and Afro- Caribbean populations and may be attributable to socio-cultural factors. This has led to the term \\"culture-bound syndrome.\\" It must be stressed that the term BD long predates any such socio-cultural, ethnic, or regional uses. The African and Caribbean nuances of the diagnosis and presentation of BD has been extensively reviewed by Henry MB Murphy.Murphy, Henry BM, (1982) Comparative Psychiatry, The International and Intercultural Distribution of Mental Illness. Berlin:Springer Verlag Note that DSM-5 does not use the term culture- bound and the term BD is not listed in the \\"Glossary of Cultural Concepts of Distress\\" in DSM-5.  Summary  BD is a psychotic disorder of short duration generally considered to have a relatively good prognosis. The diagnosis has undergone numerous changes and re-evaluations since its description by Magnan in 1886. Though becoming replaced by more internationally recognized terminology, BD as a diagnostic category is still in use in France and other French speaking nations.

Allied forces from Duala launched their advance on 20 October. Following stiff resistance along the southern railway line between Duala and Edea, German forces withdrew from the town to Jaunde, allowing Allied troops to finally occupy Edea on 26 October 1914. Background After British and French forces had landed in and occupied the major port city of Duala in September 1914, the German garrison that had once protected it retreated inland. One group withdrew along the northern rail line to Dschang, while another traveled up the Wuri River to Jabassi. The largest group which included Kamerun's governor, Karl Ebermaier and commandant, Major Zimmermann, had moved southeast along the southern railway line to the village of Edea.Strachan 2004, p. 36. During their retreat, German forces damaged or destroyed much of the railway. General Dobell, the British commander at Duala feared that the German forces that had retreated could pose a threat to his new acquisitions, prompting attacks on Jabassi and Edea in October 1914. After the German defeat at the Battle of Jabassi in early October, river vessels and manpower became available for an assault on Edea which lay on the Sanaga River to the southeast of Jaunde. =French assault on the Yapoma Bridge= During the retreat to Edea, German forces damaged the railway bridge at Yapoma, just outside Duala. A small German detachment remained entrenched on the far side of the Dibamba River at the damaged bridge while the majority of the force had retreated to Edea. The German control of the bridge was seen as a great danger to the Allied occupation of Duala due to Japoma's close proximity to the town. On 6 October, a French force of 400 tirailleurs under Colonel Mayer assisted by British naval bombardment made an assault on this position.O'Neill 1918, p. 49. The French troops crossed the bridge under severe fire from the entrenched German force who withdrew. Securing the partially damaged railway bridge made a push to Edea, further to the southeast, possible.Burg 1998, p. 29. Assault on Edea With Yapoma and Jabassi (Yabassi) secured, Dobell initiated the assault on Edea. On 20 October he launched an expedition up the Njong River to the village of Dehane which lay to the south of Edea. A track through the jungle connected the two settlements. The British force that had sailed up the Njong arrived in Dehane on 21 October and began to march north to Edea.Burg 1998, p. 31. A second British column under Commander L. W. Braithwaite would move up the Sanaga River. Colonel Mayer's French force would advance eastward along the railway line from Yapoma.Dane 1919, p. 174. One French and two British officers were killed among others when their boat capsized on the Njong river early in the operations. The Sanaga River flotilla had great difficulty navigating because of the many natural obstacles such as sand bars that lay below the surface.Dobell 1916, p. 4. The columns moving north from Dehane and up the Sanaga did not experience significant resistance from German forces but did face disease. Zimmerman chose to focus the defense of Edea on the southern railway line. The French column under Mayer that had moved east along the railway line from Yapoma encountered heavy resistance throughout their advance and suffered severe casualties as a result. Realizing that the Japoma column continued to advance despite their resistance and that other columns were closing in from Dehana and the Sanaga, German forces including the governor and commandant withdrew to Jaunde, approximately 100 miles to the east.O'Neill 1918, p. 50. On 26 October British and French forces entered and occupied Edea, finding the Germans fled. Aftermath After the capture of Edea, Allied troops moved 20 miles further inland to Kopongo. A German attempt to recapture Edea would fail at the Second Battle of Edea in early January 1915.Burg 1998, p. 43. Following the success at Jabassi and now Edea, the only remaining German unit that had withdrawn from Duala in September was the one which moved north towards the fort at Dschang. In December 1914 a British force under Colonel Edmund H. Georges would begin its march toward Dschang. On 2 January 1915 George's force reached Dschang and began a bombardment of the German fort there, which forced the garrison's surrender. The British force destroyed the fort before withdrawing to more secure lines of communication at the railhead at Bare.O'Neill 1918, p. 51.Burg 1998, p. 41. NotesReferences *Burg, David F., and L.

Early life Bard was born in Hyde Park, New York on June 2, 1819. He was the eleventh of fourteen children born to Catherine (n√©e Cruger) Bard (1781‚Äì1868) and William Bard, an attorney who was a pioneer in life insurance in the United States. Bard was descended from a family of physicians and professors. His paternal grandfather was Samuel Bard, a prominent doctor who was a founder of Columbia University's medical school and physician to George Washington. Samuel Bard's father had invested in Hyde Park, then a 3, 600 acre plantation. His paternal aunt, Eliza Bard married the Rev. John McVickar, a professor at Columbia University. The family had strong connections with the Episcopal Church and Columbia. His maternal grandparents were Ann (n√©e De Nully) Cruger and Nicholas Cruger (brother of Henry Cruger), a St. Croix slave-trader. Career Bard's father founded and was the first president of the \\"New York Life Insurance and Trust Company,\\" the first life insurance company in New York, from 1830 to 1847. Bard himself served as president of the company. =St. Stephen's College= Bard was a devout Christian and wanted to help improve the quality of life of the poor and to encourage more ministers to be trained. In 1853, Bard and his wife, who held similar beliefs, purchased a part of the Blithewood estate from Robert Donaldson Jr. and renamed it Annandale. The Bards were committed to many educational projects in their community and other nearby neighborhoods. In 1854, John and Margaret established a parish school on their estate in order to educate the area's children with a small building Bard Hall, serving as a school on weekdays and a chapel on weekends. In 1857, the Bards expanded the parish by building the Chapel of the Holy Innocents next to Bard Hall. During this time, John Bard remained in close contact with the New York leaders of the Episcopal Church, the Rt. Rev. Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright, Bishop of New York, and the Rev. John McVickar, superintendent of the Society for Promoting Religion and Learning. They suggested that he found a theological college. The Bards also collaborated with James Starr Clark from Tivoli to found the Trinity Church and School, and also Trinity Academy, a school for young boys. With the promise of outside financial support, John Bard donated the unfinished Chapel, and the surrounding 18 acres, to the diocese in November 1858. In March 1860, St. Stephen's College was founded. In 1861, construction began on the first St. Stephen's College building, a stone collegiate gothic dormitory called Aspinwall. St. Stephen's College officially changed its name to Bard College in 1934 in honor of its founder. Personal life In 1849, he married Margaret Taylor Johnston (1825‚Äì1875). Margaret was the daughter of John Johnston, a founder of New York University, and the sister of John Taylor Johnston, who served as president of the Central Railroad of New Jersey and was a founder of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Together, John and Margaret were the parents of: * Emily Bard (b. 1851), who married Charles Buyamen Lutyens in 1886. * Caroline Bard (1855‚Äì1879), who died unmarried. * William Bard (1856‚Äì1868), who died, aged 12. * Rosalie DeNormandie Bard (1867‚Äì1918), who married lawyer Charles Adams Moran (1859‚Äì1934). After the Bards' only son Willie died in 1868, the Bards and their three daughters moved to Europe. His wife died in Rome on April 10, 1875. In her will, she left all her personal property in trust for the benefit of her husband, with the income in an amount of $12,000 a year to be paid to him as administered by her trustees, brothers John Taylor Johnston and James Boorman Johnston and Stephen Van Rensselaer Cruger. After his wife's death, he remarried to Annie Belcher in 1886, and moved to 2034 O Street in Washington, D.C. Bard died there on February 12, 1899, but remained involved with the institutions he helped found until his death. He is buried in the Bard cemetery.

As early as 1996, the action was taken to upgrade what was the Lakeview Seminary to a Junior College. It was envisaged to offer four year degree programmes of an already existing University. At that time the University of Eastern Africa, Baraton was the best candidate. In 1999 the Malawi Union Mission agreed to run the four year degree programmes. In January 2000 the institution was opened as Malawi Adventist College. In the middle of 2006, the Malawi Union Officers, opened new negotiations with the University of Eastern Africa, Baraton for affiliation purposes. By May 2007 the negotiations had reached a remarkable stage leading to the signing of the Affiliation agreement between that University and the Malawi Adventist College on 27 May 2007. Later the Institution developed from a Junior College to an affiliated University. These developments included Malamulo College of Health Sciences as a constituent college of the new University. For a long time, Malamulo College of Health Science had been offering certificate and Diploma programmes in Nursing and Midwifery, Lab Technology and Clinical Medicine.

The Life story led to his expulsion from Cambridge six weeks before his finals. On his expulsion, Bulmer attempted to get a job with the Daily Express; after three days of repeated attempts, the newspaper gave him one. He stayed for two years. After this he worked on assignments for a number of magazines: first in black and white, for Queen, Town, and Time and Tide.Godfrey Smith, foreword to The North (Liverpool: Bluecoat Press, 2012), p. 3. His ambition then was photography as journalism: > I wasn't interested in art photography, I was interested in photography as > journalism, the last thing I wanted to do was put my photographs on the > walls of galleries; I wanted them in magazines. Thanks in part to a wave of creative people from the north of England, the north was at the time enjoying a vogue in the south. Bulmer's first assignment there was in 1960, for Town, to spend three days photographing the fast- declining Lancashire town of Nelson and compare it with the fast-growing Watford. He found the experience eye-opening and enjoyable.John Bulmer, The North (Liverpool: Bluecoat Press, 2012), p. 5.

Bulmer as quoted in Hamilton, \\"Northern exposures\\". In addition to Cartier-Bresson, Bulmer admired the work in black and white of Bill Brandt, Larry Burrows, William Klein, Mark Kauffman, and particularly Eugene Smith; but he was asked to work in colour for the Sunday Times Colour Section from its launch in 1962.Andy Manning, \\"Changing view from up north\\", Yorkshire Post, 28 January 2013. Accessed 10 February 2013. At the time, most photojournalists looked down on colour photography as commercial; and colour film was difficult to work with as it was slower than black and white and had less exposure latitude. In 1965, Bulmer first photographed the north of England in colour, for the Sunday Times magazine.Tearsheets for this story, \\"The North\\", can be seen here within Bulmer's website. Accessed 10 February 2013. Colour photography was \\"a medium in which Bulmer was the British pioneer\\", far ahead of such photographers as William Eggleston and Martin Parr. Using colour for the north of England was Bulmer's idea, as was the choice of winter or wet weather, when colour film was yet harder to use.Moreover, the only film whose use was practicable was Ektachrome-X, whose colour balance shifted with time and was unsuitable when the film was either old or very new. Hamilton, \\"Northern exposures\\". Grant Scott has described the results: > Saturated but muted colours combined with [Bulmer's] compositional talent to > create images which are time capsules as contemporary today as they were > then. The priorities of the Sunday Times Magazine changed in the 1970s; its then-new editor Hunter Davies explained them to Bulmer as \\"crime, middle-class living and fashion\\". These were of little interest to Bulmer, who left in 1973 after a final story about North Korea.Terry Grimley, \\"John Bulmer photographic exhibition opens in Hereford\\", Birmingham Post, 9 June 2009. Accessed 19 February 2013. However, he continued photography for other publications, making his last story of the north of England in 1976, for the British edition of Geo. Bulmer later photographed celebrities. The editor of Town, David Hughes, introduced Bulmer to his wife, Mai Zetterling, with whom he then occasionally worked as cinematographer. For some time, Bulmer combined photography with work in film, which was refreshingly different and also promised an escape from the increasingly limited interests of the news magazines. His start in television documentary film came suddenly. When he managed to obtain a visa for Burma, the Sunday Times was uninterested in any story there, and so he > went to the BBC and said, \\"I've never shot a film in my life before, but > I've got this visa, will you give me some money?\\" And they said yes and > that's how I came to make my first film.Carey Gough, \\"John Bulmer interview > part 2\\", Hereford Photography Festival blog, 19 May 2009. Accessed 18 > February 2013. As well as the BBC, Bulmer also filmed for the Discovery Channel. For the latter, \\"Bulmer focused on little-known tribal groups, but treated them as human interest stories rather than exercises in the exotic\\": a perspective that can also be seen in his early photography. As Bulmer moved away from photography to film, his earlier photographic work was overlooked. Martin Harrison credits a 1983 exhibition at the Photographers' Gallery, British Photography 1955-65: The Master Craftsmen in Print (curated by Sue Davies), with saving the work of Bulmer (as well as Graham Finlayson and others) from obscurity.Martin Harrison, preface to Young Meteors: British Photojournalism, 1957-1965 (London: Cape, 1998; ). Most of a 17-page \\"Colour Section\\" within Harrison's own 1998 book Young Meteors: British Photojournalism, 1957-1965 is devoted to Bulmer and his colour work of the north of England. Bulmer's career in film continued to the mid-2000s, when he retired and turned to digitising and cataloguing his earlier photographs. Bulmer is married to the sculptor Angela Conner. The couple live at Monnington on Wye in a house, Monnington Court, that Bulmer bought in the 1960s and where they breed and train Morgan horses.

Local authorities said Todd had committed suicide, though his family insists that he was murdered, possibly in connection with the work he had been doing at the Institute for Micro Electronics (\\"IME\\"), part of the Singaporean government-run Agency for Science, Technology and Research (\\"A*STAR\\") involving a gallium nitride-based semiconductor amplifying device purportedly for the Chinese telecom company Huawei.https://www.reuters.com/article/us-huawei-singapore/huawei-denies-work- in-field-linked-to-u-s-death-in-singapore-idUSBRE91H0G920130218 Todd's death was the subject of a major investigative report in February 2013 by the Financial Times newspaper. The article carried the Todd family's claim that Singapore police had not properly investigated Dr. Todd's death, and also contained their allegations that the IME was collaborating on a project with potential military implication with Huawei, a major Chinese electronics and telecommunications company. Both Huawei and A*STAR's IME institute subsequently denied that their work had progressed beyond the discussion stage.Feng Zengkun (19 February 2013). Is it suicide or is it murder? . The Straits Times. Retrieved 19 February 2013. Ex-colleagues of Dr. Todd also testified that there had been no such collaborations. The police also defended their role in the investigation.Spolar, Christine. (17 February 2013). Police defend probe into Singapore death. The Financial Times. Retrieved 19 February 2013.Reuters (February 18, 2013). \\"Huawei denies work in field linked to U.S. death in Singapore\\". The Todd family's suspicions of foul play stemmed from various pieces of circumstantial evidence. For instance, they alleged that police had failed to properly investigate the scene of the crime, that the police neglected to dust for fingerprints, that the suicide notes ostensibly left by Dr. Todd were out of character, that the crime scene did not match the description given by authorities, and that a pathologist in the United States found that his body showed evidence of a struggle, rather than a suicide. According to the Todd family, Shane Todd had told his family that he was increasingly anxious at work in the months leading up to his death. He worried the project he was working on with an unnamed Chinese company may have been endangering U.S. national security. He had also told his family that he felt he was under threat because of his work with the Chinese. A Coroner's Inquiry was conducted over two weeks from 13‚Äì27 May 2013. Evidence was presented to show that multiple visits had been made to suicide websites from Dr. Todd's laptop and that he had been prescribed antidepressants by a psychiatrist. The finding by the Singapore government's forensic pathologist that no injuries to Dr. Todd's body indicated he was garotted or had put up a struggle was corroborated by two independent Chief Medical Examiners from the United States. No hacking attempts on Todd's laptop to upload suicide notes were found. On July 8, the coroner released the verdict which ruled the death as \\"asphyxia due to hanging\\". Background Todd had earned his bachelor's and master's degree in electrical engineering at the University of Florida in 2003 and 2005, respectively. He then pursued doctoral studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where he researched silicon-based transmission lines. Upon completion of his PhD in 2010, he took a job offer to work for IME. During this assignment, he worked on a project involving a proposed cooperation between A*STAR's IME institute and Huawei Technology. A project proposal outline recovered from Todd's external hard drive found in his apartment showed that there was a proposal for IME and Huawei to co-develop an amplifying device powered by gallium nitride (GaN). Such devices have both commercial as well as military applications. Todd's research in GaN also involved traveling to New Jersey to procure the TurboDisc¬Æ K465i‚Ñ¢ GaN MOCVDmetalorganic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD) System, equipment necessaryhttp://s2.q4cdn.com/391606028/files/EPIK700-Introduction_v001_g9u26f.pdfhttps://veeco.s3.amazonaws.com/1aaafedf15e42b02cde1c4ce2ab50ac8.pdfhttps://ecs.confex.com/ecs/224/webprogram/Abstract/Paper21912/E3-1936.pdf to further the GaN research from Veeco, a U.S. publicly listed technology company. As Todd worked on GaN research, he became increasingly anxious about his role. In conversations with his family, he said that he was collaborating with a Chinese company, and was \\"being asked to do things\\" that made him uncomfortable. Namely, his mother said that \\"he felt he was being asked to compromise American security.\\" On one occasion, DTodd told his mother that if she didn't hear from him every week, she should contact the American embassy. He turned to religion, and was prescribed antidepressants to help cope with the stress. In late February 2012, Todd decided to leave IME and return to the United States. He put in 60 days' notice, then decided to stay an additional 30 days. As his time at IME ran down, he was offered a job with Nuvotronics, an American research firm. Friends and co-workers recalled that he was upbeat on his final day of work at IME on Friday, June 22. Todd's girlfriend, Shirley Sarmiento, expected to hear from him on Friday or Saturday, but he did not respond to her messages. On Sunday, June 24, she went to his apartment. Finding the door unlocked, she entered, and discovered Todd's body hanging from a bathroom door. A chair was about five feet away. Sarmiento then contacted Todd's family in the United States to alert them to his death.  Alleged inconsistencies  The police were quoted as saying that Todd \\"drilled holes into his bathroom wall, bolted in a pulley, then slipped a black strap through the pulley and wrapped it around the toilet several times. He then tethered the strap to his neck and jumped from a chair.\\" However, when Todd's family arrived at his apartment in Singapore after receiving news of his death, they noted that the scene was not as described: there were no holes in the marble walls of the bathroom, and neither were there bolts or screws. The location of the toilet was also not where the police report indicated it was. Furthermore, there were no signs of an investigation at the scene; police had not put up crime scene tape or dusted for fingerprints. The Financial Times reported that Todd's home \\"looked like a snapshot of a man in the middle of a move\\". Before his death, Todd was in the middle of doing the laundry. He had packed boxes in preparation for his move back to the United States, and had clean clothes folded on the couch. He was also apparently in the middle of trying to sell his furniture, and had been writing out price tags. His airline ticket back to the United States was on the table, but his laptop and phone had been taken away by the police. Police found several suicide notes allegedly left by Todd, but his family and girlfriend told the Financial Times that they did not seem to be Todd's writing. In one note, he apologized for being a burden to his family, but his mother said he had never been a burden; he had excelled at everything, she said. Another note praised the management of IME. His girlfriend was incredulous, noting that Todd \\"hated his job.\\" After his mother read the notes, she told the police detectives, \\"My son might have killed himself, but he did not write this.\\" David Camp, a criminologist from Illinois, analyzed the suicide note side by side with a collection of Todd's other writings and told reporters that he held the opinion that the suicide note found by the police was not written by Todd. Camp concluded that it wasn't written by an American and wasn't typical of a suicide, that he felt the note was detached and unemotional, and did not match up with Todd's personality. He added that \\"everything about [the suicide note] was different: different format, different cultural backgrounds, different wording, different sentence length, everything about it was completely different, which leads to one conclusion; someone else wrote it.\\" Employees at IME were reportedly told not to speak to reporters about Todd's death. However, one of Todd's colleagues did reach out to his parents, telling them, \\"After collecting all information available, I cannot believe it is a suicide case. Actually, no one believes it...I truly hope that [the] FBI can be involved and perform further investigation.\\" The official autopsy report provided by the Singapore police said that Todd's cause of death was \\"asphyxia due to hanging.\\" But on his body, Todd's family found bruises on his hands and a bump on his forehead, neither of which was mentioned in the autopsy report. Suspecting foul play, they asked the mortuary to photograph Shane's body before burial, and send the photos to Edward Adelstein, a county-level deputy medical examiner in Missouri. Adelstein's initial theory was that Todd's wounds did not support the suicide hypothesis. Instead, it appeared Todd was involved in a fight with an attacker and died by \\"garrotting\\". The original pathologist in Singapore dismissed Adelstein's conclusions, stating that Adelstein had not seen the body and had mistaken the post-mortem pooling of blood in the hands for bruises.  FBI involvement  The FBI offered assistance to authorities in Singapore to investigate Todd's death, but their help was initially refused. On the 28th of February 2013, the Singapore Police Force requested help from the FBI on two specific areas regarding the case,FBI asked to help unravel Todd mystery, Financial Times (1 March 2013) namely (a) an external hard drive that contains some files related to a possible cooperation between Huawei and IME, and (b) Todd's medical records when he consulted a psychiatrist in 2002. This occurred after the Todd family did not respond to earlier requests by the Singapore Police Force to share potential evidence. The Todds had found a hard disk in Shane's room and hired a private forensic investigator to investigate its contents. The investigator noted that the disk was accessed 3 days after Shane's death, opened a copy of a file related to his work, then deleted the copy. The Todds refused to hand it over to the Singapore Police directly and initially the FBI as well, stating: \\"It doesn't make sense for us to give information to the FBI until they're given full access to the investigation.\\"https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2013/0430/Was-Shane-Todd- murdered-over-high-tech-secretshttps://www.theverge.com/2013/4/11/4209650/why- would-anyone-want-to-kill-shane-todd In particular, the Todds claim that the Singapore Police prematurely concluded that Shane Todd's death was suicide.\\"U.S. man fought to the end, despite Singapore‚Äôs ‚Äòsuicide‚Äô claims, his family says\\" Washington Times (6 March 2013) The Singapore Foreign Minister pledged that Singapore Police will share evidence with the FBI, but stopped short of agreeing to the Todds' request for the FBI to lead the investigation. After the Todds turned the hard disk over to the FBI, the FBI issued a report on May 9 supporting the Singapore police's claims that the hard disk was accessed by the police who were checking for evidence, and not some unknown third party. The report explained that the file in question was a temporary file that had been automatically created and deleted by the Microsoft software when the police investigator was accessing the hard disk. It also emerged that the hard drive was in fact handed over to the Todds by the Singapore police in the presence of U.S. embassy staff, even though the Todds claimed to have found it themselves.  Publicity and response  A grassroots petition was started in 2013 on the White House website (whitehouse.gov) asking then President Obama to direct the Department of Justice to thoroughly investigate, under the federal witness murder statute, whether Todd was killed to keep him from talking to U.S. authorities about his work with the Chinese.Boca Grad Shane Todd: Suicide Or Murder Abroad?, BOCA news Now (1 March 2013) Shane Todd's parents raised their concerns and questions to the U.S. Embassy in Singapore, to the Singapore Police, to the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (\\"A*STAR\\") run IME institute, and also asked whether the FBI could join the investigation, which would require an agreement between the Singaporean and U.S. governments. Shane Todd's parents have also been pushing for a congressional investigation into their son's death.Family of engineer who died in Singapore after warning of Chinese spying wants answers, FOX News (1 March 2013) Parents of Engineer Shane Todd Plead for Investigation Into His Mysterious Death in Singapore: Was His Work With a Chinese Company a Factor?, FOX Insider (1 March 2013) Starting from the original Financial Times investigative report, they received publicity on their son's case from several major news outlets.Intrigue surrounds American's death in Singapore, USA Today (28 February 2013).

Baucus has brought the case to the attention of the White House. The Senate Finance Committee, which Max Baucus chaired, subsequently raised the issue surrounding Shane's death in face-to-face meetings with Singapore's U.S. Embassy staffers and Singaporean officials. Following the conclusion of the coroner's inquiry into Todd's death, the U.S. embassy in Singapore issued a statement saying that the inquiry was \\"comprehensive, fair and transparent.\\"  Singapore Coroner Inquiry  An inquiry into the cause of Todd's death was launched on 13 May 2013 by Singaporean authorities. The Todd family was permitted to pose relevant questions, through a counsel or by themselves, to the witness about the investigation findings and the forensic medical reports. The Todd family appointed 5 lawyers from three Singapore law firms: Gloria James and Amarjit Singh of M/s Gloria James-Civetta & Co, Steven Lam of JTJB Lawyers, Peter Ong and Foo Cheow Ming of M/s Peter Ong & Raymond Tan. It is only after this process that the State Coroner reviewed the evidence adduced and determined the cause and circumstances connected with the death of Shane Todd.\\"Senators seek bigger FBI role in Todd death probe\\" Financial Times (7 March 2013)The Case of Shane Todd = Timeline = 13 May, during the first day of the inquiry, the government's lawyer, Tai Wei Shyong, presented evidence that Todd's laptop revealed he had accessed suicide-related websites 19 times between 10 March 2012 and 23 May 2012. Todd had earlier consulted a psychiatrist and had been prescribed anti-depressants. The state counsel presented a report by the FBI verifying that the hard drive allegedly found by the Todds was the same one which the Singapore police had taken from the apartment and subsequently given to the Todds after they did not find suspicious material in it.https://qz.com/84365/shane-todds-mysterious-death- in-singapore-day-one-of-the-inquest/ 14 May, Montana's senators want U.S. research funds withheld from Shane Todd's Singaporean employer until the FBI has full access to evidence.https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/03/14/shane-todd- block-singapore-funds/1988215/ 16 May, the 3rd day of the inquest, Senior consultant forensic pathologist Wee Keng Poh of the Health Sciences Authority, who had supervised the post-mortem examination, refuted the October claim by Adelstein that Todd had been garrotted and reiterated that evidence on the case showed that Shane Todd's death was caused by hanging. This conclusion was supported by two U.S.-based medial examiners who had reviewed the autopsy reports: David Fowler, chief medical examiner for the State of Maryland; and Valerie Josephine Rao, chief medical examiner of District 4 and part of District 3, Jacksonville, Florida. 20 May, IME's Deputy executive director of research Patrick Lo was asked whether he had tried to influence the testimonies given by his employees, based on a recording made during a briefing he gave them. Lo said his objective was to inform them of their obligation to tell the truth to the police, as well as the company's obligation of confidentiality to its clients, including Huawei. On the Todds' claims that Todd had been ordered to handcopy gallium nitride (GaN) recipes when Todd was sent to a U.S.-based vendor for training, Lo said that \\"such a formula would be \\"useless\\", because even one for a simple LED light would have some 6,000 entries, and it would not have been possible to handcopy without inaccuracies.\\" Lo also testified that IME does not conduct any classified military research. Employees of IME also testified that although there were meetings between their company and Huawei, including one where Todd and senior employees of Huawei were involved, nothing had been finalized. 21 May, the 6th day of the inquest, Adelstein, who had told the inquiry that he wasn't a qualified forensic pathologist, after reviewing new medical evidence, retracted his previous claim that Todd was garroted, and speculated instead that Todd could have been disabled with a taser, then killed with an armlock. His conclusions were based on reviewing photos of Todd's body and other circumstantial evidence. He also asserted that Todd was \\"a very dangerous person\\" to IME and Huawei Technologies, that \\"they had him killed\\" and well- trained \\"assassins\\" may have been involved, without offering evidence to support his claim. Todd's parents walked out of the inquest after complaining about what they called the introduction of a surprise witness‚ÄîLuis Alejandro Andro Montes, who was an ex-colleague of Todd. Although the witness was named on 13 May, day 1 of the inquiry, Montes hadn't arrived in Singapore until 18 May, his written testimony was taken on 20 May and subsequently made known to the courts and the Todds on the morning of 21 May. Mary Todd told reporters that they did not believe the testimony, and wanted time to investigate. Todd's father said \\"The prosecution brings forth witnesses at the last minute and we have no chance to question it. Basically we actually have lost faith in the process\\". The Todds also claimed that neither they nor Todd's girlfriend Shirley Sarmiento recognized Luis. 22 May, chief medical examiners David Fowler (Maryland) and Valerie Josephine Rao (Florida) testified as independent experts and rejected Adelstein's murder theory from the day before. Fowler said that the marks on Todd's hands identified by Adelstein as bruises from a fight were actually \\"the most classical example of post-mortem lividities\\" in hanging cases and declared that \\"the cause of death was asphyxia due to hanging\\". Rao agreed that there were no injuries indicative of a struggle and cited suicide as the cause of death. The Todds discharged their lawyers, saying that they \\"no longer have confidence in the transparency and fairness of the system,\\" and will no longer participate in the inquiry, and \\"will return to the U.S. as soon as possible and turn to the court of public opinion for judgment\\" on their belief that Todd was murdered. 23 May, Montes testified that he had last seen Shane on 23 June 2012, contradicting the Todds' claims that Shane had been killed before that date. He also contradicted the Todds' assertion that they did not know him, testifying that he had met them in their hotel room days after Shane's death, in the presence of other close friends of Shane's. 28 May Inquiry Ended.http://docplayer.net/39402978-In-the-coroner-s- court-of-the-republic-of-singapore.html =Verdict= The verdict on the inquiry was released on 8 July 2013, with the coroner ruling that Todd died of \\"asphyxia due to hanging\\" and said he was satisfied \\"there was no foul play\\".

Hatoum is one of Brazil's most eminent contemporary writers. Among other honors, Hatoum was awarded Brazil's most prestigious literary award, the Jabuti Prize, three times for best novel. In 2017, he received the title of Officier de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres from the French government. Born in Manaus of Lebanese descent, he studied comparative literature in Paris, and has served as professor of literature in universities such as the Federal University of Amazonas (UFAM) and at the University of California, Berkeley. His first novel, Relato de um Certo Oriente (\\"Tale of a Certain Orient\\"), won the Jabuti Prize in 1989. His second novel, Dois Irm√£os (\\"Two Brothers\\"), won another Jabuti in 2000 and was translated into twelve languages and adapted for television, theater and comics. His third novel Cinzas do Norte (\\"Ashes of the Amazon\\") won the Jabuti in 2005, as well as the Portugal Telecom Prize for Literature, Bravo! and APCA awards. In 2008, his novel √ìrf√£os do Eldorado, was adapted for the cinema Over 200,000 copies of his books have been sold in Brazil, and they have been translated in several languages including Italian, English, French, Spanish, Danish, Czech, and Arabic. Hatoum writes about destructured families in his works, with a political tendency. In two of his books, Dois Irm√£os and Cinzas do Norte, Milton Hatoum made a subtle criticism of the Brazilian military regime of 1964‚Äì1985. Early years Hatoum's father was an immigrant from Lebanon who met a Brazilian of Lebanese origin. During his childhood, Milton lived with the culture, religion and language of Arabs and African Jews. At age 15 he moved to Bras√≠lia and finished secondary school in the Brazilian capital. After that, Hatoum moved to S√£o Paulo. Three years later, he studied Architecture and Urbanism at the University of S√£o Paulo (USP). In 1980 he traveled to Spain on a scholarship from Instituto Iberoamericano de Cooperaci√≥n. He lived in Madrid and Barcelona. After that, he took postgraduate courses at the University of Paris III. =Career= After concluding his studies, Hatoun returned to Manaus, where he taught French language and literature at the Universidade Federal do Amazonas. Relato de um Certo Oriente was published when he was 37. He became a Doctor in Literary Theory at USP in 1998. Feeling unsatisfied with the politics in Manaus, he decided to live in S√£o Paulo. Eleven years after publishing his first novel, Milton wrote Dois Irm√£os. Between the publishing of the first and second books, he published several short stories in newspapers and magazines in Brazil and abroad.

Ferdinando Arn√≤ studied jazz improvisation at Berklee College of Music in Boston. His teachers were, among others, Gary Burton, John La Porta, Tom McKinley, Charlie Banacos and Phil Wilson. Arn√≤ was involved in jam sessions in Boston with internationally renowned musicians such as Victor Bailey (Weather Report), Tommy Campbell, Bob Gullotti, Ed Schuller, Terri Lyne Carrington, Branford Marsalis and Jeff Watts. When he completed his studies, Arn√≤ received his diploma from Quincy Jones at the graduation ceremony. On his return to Italy he worked as an arranger and composer for television, doing films, documentaries, program theme songs, variety shows and cartoons. In that same period he arranged and composed songs for Emi, Bmg, Warner (he wrote Il Tempo sung by Ornella Vanoni), and the theater, collaborating with Jerome Savary, Dario Fo and Fiorenzo Carpi. In the nineties Arn√≤ began composing jingles for TV commercials, an activity that was consolidated in 2000 with the birth of his company quiet, please! Since then, he has worked on thousands of TV ad campaigns, doing new arrangements or composing tailor-made songs, from the ironic rap Ga el Suv (Skoda Yeti) to the Gran Soleil smash for Ferrero and the remake of Here Comes the Sun by George Harrison for Allianz. Ferdinando Arn√≤ has received many honors and recognition for his original music and catalog tracks selected for commercials, starting with ten Key Awards (Editorial Media Key group) that he won between 2004 and 2018. Among these the Excellence Key Award that his label quiet, please! received in 2015 as the best production company. In 2004, the music for the Telecom commercial \\"Gandhi\\" (winner of the Bronze Lion at Cannes) was voted Best Ever Forever Song by the Key Award jury (the song used was Sacrifice by Lisa Gerrard and Pieter Bourke). Four years earlier, in 2000, Arn√≤'s music for BMW won the Mezzo Minuto d'Oro award. Among the countless campaigns that Arn√≤ has done, there are the international TV ads for Barilla (Roger Federer and Chef Davide Oldani), Tim (All Together Now) Fernet Branca, Crodino Twist, Giorgio Armani \\"Frames of Life\\", Averna, Aperol, Vodafone, Fastweb, Poste Italiane, several commercials for the promotion of Expo 2015, Nike, Esselunga, Nespresso, Peugeot, Alfa Romeo, Ariston, Parmigiano Reggiano, Gran Cereale, Coca-Cola, Tic Tac, Sky Christmas \\"Toy\\" (with Robin Williams) Sky Mondiali, Sky Sport, Sky Restart and Sky Great TV. Through his work creating music for TV ads, Arn√≤ has collaborated with some of the greatest contemporary movie directors involved to direct the commercials, from Gabriele Salvatores and Michel Gondry to Tarsem Singh, Spike Lee, Matteo Garrone and Emanuele Crialese. Arn√≤ also selected the music (The Magnificent Seven by The Clash) for the Campari short film directed by Oscar winner Paolo Sorrentino and for the Tim commercial, known worldwide for the moves of German dancer Sven Otten. Through his work in advertising, in 2006 Arn√≤ heard the voice of Malika Ayane who in the following year interpreted Soul Waver for the Saab 9-3 ad campaign (the song was also used in the American TV series One Tree Hill). Becoming the producer of the artist, Arn√≤ worked with Malika Ayane on her single Feeling Better and her debut album Malika Ayane (Ferdinando was not only her producer, but also the composer and author of most of the songs on the album). In 2009 Arn√≤ accompanied Malika Ayane on piano at the 59th Sanremo Song Festival with the song Come Foglie written by Giuliano Sangiorgi and produced and arranged by Ferdinando. In 2010 Arn√≤ produced Malika Ayane's second album called Grovigli , which also featured great artists such as Paolo Conte, Alexander BƒÉlƒÉnescu, Vince Mendoza (Bjork, Joni Mitchell, Gregory Porter) and Cesare Cremonini. The single from the Grovigli album, Ricomincio da qui, was a hit at the Sanremo Festival 2010 and on the radio. Always in the 2010 Arn√≤ collaborated on several recording projects with Andrea Bocelli and Ennio Morricone. In 2011 he conducted the Sanremo Festival orchestra for two songs for which he was also the producer: Tre Colori by Tricarico and Follia d'Amore performed by Raphael Gualazzi, winners of the New Proposals section and the Mia Martini Critics' Award. Some of Arn√≤‚Äôs compositions are part of the soundtracks of A Time for Dancing by Peter Gilbert, Generazione Mille Euro by Massimo Venier and Letters To Juliet by Gary Winick. For the soundtrack of La prima cosa bella by Paolo Virz√¨, Arn√≤ rearranged the homonymous song sung by Malika Ayane. The year 2013 marked the debut EP of Common Mama, the band formed by Arn√≤ featuring the magnetic voice of Jon Kenzie, a busker from Manchester discovered in the London Underground. The single Meant from the start followed and took third place at the International Songwriting Competition in 2014. Live@quiet, please! - Creativity in real time is the title of the format that was broadcast on Sky Art in 2015 and 2016 and recorded in Arn√≤'s studios. The aim of the program was to capture the creative moment of recording. Guests included Jack Savoretti, Devendra Banhart, Melanie De Biasio, le CocoRosie, Selah Sue and Benjamin Clementine. In 2016 Arn√≤ composed Music For Radura, the soundtrack for an installation by Stefano Boeri designed as a decompression space within the city and housed in the Cortile della Farmacia of the Universit√† Statale of Milan. Belgian vocalist Melanie De Biasio, Giorgio Cocilovo (Moog guitar) and Marco Decimo (cello) performed the five pieces. In 2017, during Milan Design Week, Arn√≤ presented his composition Entrainment (produced by the Triennale), a pagan mantra born from the idea of using music to synchronize with people nearby and with everything around us. The performance took place at the Triennale Theater. In November 2018 Entrainment was performed at the Museum of Science and Technology in Milan. Dream On Me is the title of the single that Arn√≤ co-wrote with American singer-songwriter Joan As Police Woman and was released in 2018. The soul pop track (accompanied by a video clip directed by Jacopo Benassi) was a hit on streaming platforms. On November 2018 Electa published Ferdinando Arn√≤ Entrainment, the book written by music critic Gianni Poglio that reveals the many facets of the artist's art and musical sensitivity. The story is also told through artistic photos taken in the quiet, please! studios inspired in their design by the setting of Stanley Kubrick's cult film 2001: A Space Odyssey. In early 2019 O Filho Do Recluso was released: the traditional Portuguese song was arranged by Arn√≤ and performed by Maro, a talented young singer with a intense, poignant voice. The song was featured in a dream-like, visionary art-video by the Japanese director and fashion photographer Karina Taira. In March 2019 the new Common Mama single You're My Life was released. In its review, Panorama.it called it \\"The art of pop in three minutes.\\" The summer of 2019 is made by the funk vibrations of Go For Gold (with Dede and Javier Starks). My Yiddishe Momme/The Click Song, published on May 18, 2020, produced and arranged by Arn√≤, is a reinterpretation of an a cappella version sung by Mama Africa in 2008, linked in medley with another piece of African tradition, The Click Song. \\"We created an instant song thanks to an intuition of Caterina Caselli, linked to Miriam by a solid friendship\\" says the producer and composer. On June 19th What Love was released: a single written and produced by Arn√≤ and recorded between Zimbabwe (with the contribution of Isaac and Daniel Gonora and the Zimbabwe Kids Choir), Chicago, Los Angeles and Milan. Among the musicians involved were the jazz legend Pharoah Sanders, Angel Bat Dawid, B'Rael Ali Thunder and a team of session men including Paolo Costa, Giorgio Cocilovo, Daniele Comoglio, and Luana Heredia. There Was An Angel, present on all streaming platforms since June 26th, is the song that captures the encounter between the soul vibes of Samora Pinderhughes and the urban flow of Precious Ebony, leading exponent of the avant-garde Queer Ballroom Scene in New York.

It aired on Fox in the United States on February 17, 2013. Plot Bob and Linda try to think of ways to cut expenses. Linda decides to go shopping at Fresh Feed, a Trader Joe's-style grocery store, where after talking to the manager about the store gets a part- time job. Bob is not keen to the idea, but Linda is found to be excited at her job. She leaves Bob to run the place (poorly) on his own. Meanwhile, the kids visit their mother at Fresh Feed, where Gene eats all the free samples of mini egg rolls, Louise ties frozen shrimp to balloons, and Tina decides to take a tour behind the dairy fridge, where she meets a boy whose finger got bitten by his turtle. Due to a call from his mother, the boy hastily leaves, and Tina is only able to grab the boy's bandage. Tina is determined to find him. Curious about Linda's job, but at the same time not wanting to ask her, Bob keeps asking the kids about their mother, but sees that Linda deeply enjoys her work. Linda comes home one night, saying that she got high scores in her evaluation. Bob, in an effort to get her back to the restaurant, \\"evaluates\\" her as well but the couple ends up fighting. Linda announces that she might work at Fresh Feed full-time, while Bob bans the kids from going to the store in order to help him at the restaurant. Due to her giving and almost doormat- like nature, Linda ends up unwittingly letting all of her co-workers take the day off, leaving her alone at the grocery store. She enlists the help of the kids, but ends up being terribly undermanned. Tina finally meets the boy with the turtle bite, Josh, and they end up kissing. Tina gives him her number before she and the rest of the family abandon the chaotic grocery store, much to the dismay of the manager who left Linda in charge in the first place. Reception Pilot Viruet of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+, saying \\"What I really liked about the episode is that it didn‚Äôt try to change Linda by having her put her foot down and try to prove she‚Äôs not just an overly nice pushover. Rather, Linda stayed true to her roots while also showing Bob why these traits are important to have and why it makes them work together so well, both as a couple and as co-workers in the restaurant.\\" Dyanamaria Leifsson of TV Equals said this and last week's episode \\"featured a great sampling of strange Belcher songs. Bob‚Äôs Burgers can write a heck of a story, packed with brilliant one-liners, but they can also write a borderline annoying tune that makes you laugh and gets stuck in your head for weeks. I can‚Äôt help but love every bizarre song the Belchers sing, and after recently reading about 'Bob‚Äôs Buskers' I can only hope they keep those odd catchy tunes coming.\\" The episode received a 1.8 rating and was watched by a total of 3.93 million people. This made it the fourth most watched show on Animation Domination that night, beating The Cleveland Show but losing to Family Guy.

The effects can manifest much later‚Äîmid-life Alcohol Use Disorder has been found to correlate with increased risk of severe cognitive and memory deficits in later life. Alcohol related brain damage is not only due to the direct toxic effects of alcohol; alcohol withdrawal, nutritional deficiency, electrolyte disturbances, and liver damage are also believed to contribute to alcohol-related brain damage. Adolescent brain development Consuming large amounts of alcohol over a period of time can impair normal brain development in humans. Deficits in retrieval of verbal and nonverbal information and in visuospatial functioning were evident in youths with histories of heavy drinking during early and middle adolescence. During adolescence critical stages of neurodevelopment occur, including remodeling and functional changes in synaptic plasticity and neuronal connectivity in different brain regions. These changes may make adolescents especially susceptible to the harmful effects of alcohol. Compared to adults, adolescents exposed to alcohol are more likely to exhibit cognitive deficits (including learning and memory dysfunction). Some of these cognitive effects, such as learning impairments, may persist into adulthood. Mechanisms of action=Neuroinflammation= Ethanol can trigger the activation of astroglial cells which can produce a proinflammatory response in the brain. Ethanol interacts with the TLR4 and IL-1RI receptors on these cells to activate intracellular signal transduction pathways. Specifically, ethanol induces the phosphorylation of IL-1R-associated kinase (IRAK), ERK1/2, stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)/JNK, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK). Activation of the IRAK/MAPK pathway leads to the stimulation of the transcription factors NF-kappaB and AP-1. These transcription factors cause the upregulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression. The upregulation of these inflammatory mediators by ethanol is also associated with an increase in caspase 3 activity and a corresponding increase in cell apoptosis. The exact mechanism by which various concentrations of ethanol either activates or inhibits TLR4/IL-1RI signaling is not currently known, though it may involve alterations in lipid raft clustering or cell adhesion complexes and actin cytoskeleton organization. =Changes in dopaminergic and glutamatergic signaling pathways= Intermittent ethanol treatment causes a decrease in expression of the dopamine receptor type 2 (D2R) and a decrease in phosphorylation of 2B subunit of the NMDA receptor (NMDAR2B) in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, and for only D2R the striatum. It also causes changes in the acetylation of histones H3 and H4 in the prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, and striatum, suggesting chromatin remodeling changes which may mediate long- term alterations. Additionally, adolescent rats pre-exposed to ethanol have higher basal levels of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens, along with a prolonged dopamine response in this area in response to a challenge dose of ethanol. Together, these results suggest that alcohol exposure during adolescence can sensitize the mesolimbic and mesocortical dopamine pathways to cause changes in dopaminergic and glutamatergic signaling, which may affect the remodeling and functions of the adolescent brain. These changes are significant as alcohol‚Äôs effect on NMDARs could contribute to learning and memory dysfunction (see Effects of alcohol on memory). =Inhibition of hippocampal neurogenesis= Excessive alcohol intake (binge drinking) causes a decrease in hippocampal neurogenesis, via decreases in neural stem cell proliferation and newborn cell survival. Alcohol decreases the number of cells in S-phase of the cell cycle, and may arrest cells in the G1 phase, thus inhibiting their proliferation. Ethanol has different effects on different types of actively dividing hippocampal progenitors during their initial phases of neuronal development. Chronic alcohol exposure decreases the number of proliferating cells that are radial glia-like, preneuronal, and intermediate types, while not affecting early neuronal type cells; suggesting ethanol treatment alters the precursor cell pool. Furthermore, there is a greater decrease in differentiation and immature neurons than there is in proliferating progenitors, suggesting that the abnormal decrease in the percentage of actively dividing preneuronal progenitors results in a greater reduction in the maturation and survival of postmitotic cells. Additionally, alcohol exposure increased several markers of cell death. In these studies neural degeneration seems to be mediated by non-apoptotic pathways. One of the proposed mechanisms for alcohol‚Äôs neurotoxicity is the production of nitric oxide (NO), yet other studies have found alcohol-induced NO production to lead to apoptosis (see Neuroinflammation section). Transient versus stable alterations Many negative physiologic consequences of alcoholism are reversible during abstinence. As an example, long-term chronic alcoholics suffer a variety of cognitive deficiencies. However, multiyear abstinence resolves most neurocognitive deficits, except for some lingering deficits in spatial processing. Nevertheless there are some frequent long-term consequences that are not reversible during abstinence. Alcohol craving (compulsive need to consume alcohol) is frequently present long-term among alcoholics. Among 461 individuals who sought help for alcohol problems, followup was provided for up to 16 years. By 16 years, 54% of those who tried to remain abstinent without professional help had relapsed, and 39% of those who tried to remain abstinent with help had relapsed. Long-term, stable consequences of chronic alcohol abuse are thought to be due to stable alterations of gene expression resulting from epigenetic changes within particular regions of the brain. For example, in rats exposed to alcohol for up to 5 days, there was an increase in histone 3 lysine 9 acetylation in the pronociceptin promoter in the brain amygdala complex. This acetylation is an activating mark for pronociceptin. The nociceptin/nociceptin opioid receptor system is involved in the reinforcing or conditioning effects of alcohol.

Sausage sizzles are often served at community events in Australia and New Zealand, and have become common features in the cultures of both nations. The term \\"sausage sizzle\\" came into common use in the 1980s and is used to describe either the food item itself, the barbecuing technique or the nature of the event it may be served at. Sausage sizzles are generally held either as free community events or as fundraisers for charities, schools, sports clubs and other organisations. As such, ingredients and equipment are cheaply purchased or donated by suppliers. Fundraising sausage sizzles have become particularly associated with elections in Australia and the hardware chain Bunnings Warehouse.  Format  206x206pxMost commonly, the main sale item at a sausage sizzle is a pork or beef sausage (often referred colloquially in Australian slang as a \\"snag\\"), cooked on a grill or barbecue and served on a single slice of white bread or a hotdog roll. Tomato sauce is the most common accompaniment, and is usually available for no extra cost, though other condiments such as barbecue sauce and American mustard are regularly available. Grilled onions are often available, for free or at extra cost. Some sausage sizzles also offer the option of a white bread roll as an alternative to sliced bread. Vegetarian or gluten free options are infrequently available, but often sold at events with more extensive menus including hamburgers or complete meals. Soft drink cans or bottled water may also be available for purchase, so as to maximise fundraising.

History = Formation and First Album = Not much is recorded of the Southern Backtones‚Äô early history until their first album, Los Tormentos De Amor, in 1998. David Taylor and Mykel Foster are cited as essential earlier contributors. Los Tormentos de Amor was recorded at SugarHill Recording Studios on 2‚Äù tape. Recording this album began a working relationship that would carry on throughout the band's career; Hank Schyma working with Producer Dan Workman formed the central core that would determine the band's direction. Workman is credited not only as producer on the album, but with some vocals as well; he would later appear in some form or fashion on every consecutive album release to date. It was mastered by Rodney Meyers, who would also master the following record. The liner notes reference an inside joke: ‚ÄúAll bridges burned by Mykel Foster,‚Äù a reference to the band‚Äôs early rockstar attitude and penchant for disruption. Their unruly behavior across a number of Texas and Louisiana venues allegedly led to instances where they regained entry to bars on the promise of ‚Äúthat guy‚Äôs not in the band anymore.‚Äù The offending member was apparently almost always in attendance at the time. The phase would continue until a conversation with Workman would later convince them that ‚Äúthat stuff only works when you‚Äôre famous.‚Äù The band would live to shake off their formerly rambunctious ways, but not before circulating word of a particularly precipitous incident Nova Lomax, John. \\"Wigged Gigs\\".

Levi‚Äôs approached the band about using the song Fallen Angel, using it as a central point for their Levi's/Stage Stores promotional campaign. It resulted in the Southern Backtones touring through 80 towns across Texas in the first ever stretch Hummer, playing on top of it in retailer parking lots. Footage from these shows ended up as the basis for a Levi‚Äôs commercial, effectively releasing 100,000 copies of the album into distribution along the way. = Second Album = The second album, The Formula, was completed and pressed in 2002 (Dan Workman again produced and appeared on it). It is now considered by the band to be an unsatisfying experience and never released, despite some positive reviews.Kelly, Jennifer. \\"11/25/2002\\". Splendid. November, 2002 Only three tracks from the session would be later be made available as \\"Unreleased Studio Tracks.\\" = The Blue EP = When the band returned to SugarHill Recording Studios, they were joined for the first time by Grammy winning Engineer Steve Christensen (who in addition to Workman would be involved with each successive release). Robbie Parrish served as Drum Tech for the EP as well as the resulting full-length album. He worked with Todd Sommer, a new drummer that would remain throughout the band‚Äôs life. This would also mark their introduction to Dan Workman‚Äôs Casio SK-1, a small sampling keyboard originally intended as a toy, but would later end up on every release to date. Stringed arrangements were also added to expand the new sound; Kevin Ryan (co-author of Recording the Beatles) composed the arrangements that would surface on these recordings, played by accomplished violinist Nikola Augsburger. The process was facilitated by the contributions of John Griffin, a guitarist for the band who funded much of the record, urging them to ‚Äúspare no expense.‚Äù This led to the album being mastered by Jeff Lipton at the noted Peerless Mastering in Boston, MA. Several tracks showed up on the 2004 surf documentary There Ain‚Äôt No Surf In Texas. They would also have several tracks used in soundtrack of the 2005 film ‚ÄúDrop Dead Sexy,‚Äù starring Crispin Glover and Jason Lee. During this period longtime bassist Mykel Foster left the band to focus on growing family responsibilities, though the band had a track included on a Journey‚Äôs compilation called ‚ÄúGet Out of the Garage.‚Äù = Southern Backtones = During the time leading up to the 2006 release of their self-titled full-length album, W Ross Wells began working with them as a sometimes creative developer, but primarily as director of the music video for ‚ÄúForever‚Äù (released in 2007) and ‚ÄúSlumber Party‚Äù (released in 2009), and key strategist behind their online promotions. The results found ‚ÄúForever‚Äù included in regular rotation on MTV2, the Canadian network Much Music, and was later tapped for use by the CNBC program ‚ÄúAmerican Made.‚Äù It would go on to win a Gold ADDY for Zenfilm in 2007.

In that period, Southern Backtones had singles reaching #1 on some stations around Boston and Iowa (oddly enough), and #2 singles on some stations around the east and west coasts. This momentum, begun by inclusion on the aforementioned Journey‚Äôs compilation, led to them again being tapped by Levi‚Äôs for their Fader Fort SXSW showcase in 2010. A period of varied activity began; the band began spending ample time playing with people like Johnny Falstaff, John Evans, and Craig Kinsey and The Sideshow Tramps.

He is known for creating the clip art zine Crap Hound. He was voted one of \\"The 25 Funniest People on Twitter\\" by Rolling Stone in 2012 and he later became known for his Tumblr blog LiarTownUSA.  Career = Early years = Two years out of high school and living in Eugene, Oregon, Tejaratchi designed his first posters in 1990 for a fictional rock band and posted them around Eugene. He was inspired by the many DIY posters for punk bands he saw posted around the cities of Eugene and Portland. His design got him hired to produce posters for the W.O.W. Hall, a performing arts venue in Eugene. It was through his work for W.O.W. Hall that he was introduced to Mike King, a screen printer and poster designer who, at the time, also produced Snipehunt, a zine devoted to the music and comic art scenes of the Northwestern United States. Tejaratchi assisted with elements of the page layout, such as paste up and typesetting, but did not contribute any content to the zine. = Crap Hound = Tejaratchi moved to Portland between the end of 1990 and the beginning of 1991. In 1994, Tejaratchi published his first edition of the graphic art zine Crap Hound. The 8¬Ω √ó 11 inch zine featured pages of monochrome, high contrast line art and clip art images grouped into themes such as circuses, skeletons, hearts, hands and eyes. Tejaratchi mostly uses images taken from sources printed from the 1920s to the 1960s, such as vintage catalogs, rare books, medical textbooks, pornography and advertisements. The inspiration for the zine came when Tejaratchi was working on a poster for a Portland-area rock band ‚Äì he had a particular image of a devil in mind, but was unable to find the exact image. Tejaratchi created the zine as a way of organizing clip art of various topics to make them more easily accessible and he published these collections for the use of other graphic artists. The zine also includes satirical essays and observations on politics and culture written by Tejaratchi. The humor in his work has been described as sardonic and as having a \\"cheeky wit\\". From 1994 to 1998 Tejaratchi published five editions of Crap Hound; he stopped printing due to a lack of funds. Tejaratchi left Portland in 2000 for St. Louis, Missouri, then New York City where he worked as art director for the New York Press, until he left for Los Angeles in 2001. Tejaratchi did not produce another edition of Crap Hound until 2005 when he was approached by Chloe Eudaly, the owner and operator of Reading Frenzy, an alternative bookstore and publishing house in Portland. Eudaly has raised money for each issue using the crowd funding website Kickstarter. Tejaratchi's essay \\"Death, Phones, Scissors\\" ‚Äì which was published in 1999 in the sixth issue of Crap Hound bearing the same title ‚Äì was widely distributed via Twitter and Tumblr as part of a four paragraph essay attributed to the artist Banksy. The viral quote came from Banksy's 2004 book Cut It Out and while the book did credit Crap Hound, the attribution was left off when the text was retyped and disseminated online. However Tejaratchi later wrote in a blog post published on Reading Frenzy's website on March 18, 2012, that he discovered Banksy had mailed a letter and a copy of Cut It Out to the address in Crap Hound in 2002. Tejaratchi stated he had been moving a lot around the same time and never received the items. He added that the attributions in the back of the book, as opposed to cited references for the excerpts, were responsible for the confusion. Tejaratchi also wrote that he did not oppose having his words published in the book and that his main concern was that his words were being wrongly attributed to Banksy via an internet jpeg. The problem was complicated by the fact that the Crap Hound issue containing the essay was about to be reprinted, raising the possibility that Tejaratchi would be accused of plagiarism. = Other work = Tejaratchi's zine work was displayed as part of The Copyist Conspiracy: An Exhibition of Zine Art, an exhibition of zine art and zine artists held in San Francisco on November 19, 2005. BoingBoing editor Cory Doctorow said that the title of his first published work, the short story Craphound, was inspired in part by Tejaratchi's zine. Doctorow also registered the domain craphound.com for his personal website. Tejaratchi worked as a graphic designer for the performance artist and filmmaker Miranda July on her films Me and You and Everyone We Know (2005) and \\"The Future\\" (2011). Retrieved August 1, 2012. He is also a writer for the American variety radio show program Live From Here. He also designs book covers for the Seattle-based book publisher Feral House. Tejaratchi is active on Twitter under the handle @ShittingtonUK and was voted one of \\"The 25 Funniest People on Twitter\\" by Rolling Stone in 2012. He also started a Tumblr blog LiarTownUSA in 2013 that features satirical renditions of magazine covers, wall calendars, billboards and print ads for fictional products.

She is noted for discovering, with her then-husband Kenneth C. Brugger, the location of the overwintering sites of the monarch butterfly, Danaus plexippus. Their find completed the story of the monarchs' migration, which has been described as \\"the entomological discovery of the 20th century.\\" She was born in 1949 on a ranch in the mountains near El Salto, in the Mexican state of Michoac√°n. As a child she loved to observe nature and read books about science. When she was 11 she moved with her family to the state capital, Morelia, and by age 17 she was living and working in Mexico City. She loved adventure, exploring Mexico, Canada, the United States and Central America alone or with friends. When she was 21 a Canadian friend introduced her to Brugger, a 53-year-old textile engineer and amateur naturalist. In 1972 Brugger showed her a notice in a local newspaper written by Fred and Norah Urquhart, Canadian entomologists who had been studying the migration patterns of monarch butterflies since 1937. They suspected the monarchs spent the winter in Mexico and were looking for volunteers to hunt for the butterflies there. Brugger searched for several years, first as a volunteer, then as a paid assistant to the Urquharts. Brugger convinced Trail to join him in the search, and for several years they roamed the country on weekends in his Winnebago, searching for the monarchs. They married in 1974. Following clues that pointed toward Michoac√°n, they hiked the mountains by day and spent the nights in the Winnebago. Finally on January 2, 1975, they found a summit called Cerro Pel√≥n where the trees and even the ground were covered with millions of resting butterflies. Trail was 25 at the time. On January 9 they called the Urquharts to report their find. In early 1976 the Urquharts themselves came to visit the site they had sought for decades. The discovery was reported in National Geographic magazine in August 1976. The magazine cover featured a picture of Trail covered in butterflies. Eventually a dozen such sites were located and were protected by the Mexican government as ecological reserves. The area is now a World Heritage Site known as the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve. The sites are popular with ecotourists who admire the beauty of the massed butterflies. Trail and Brugger's search for the butterflies is dramatized in the IMAX film Flight of the Butterflies. Trail returned to the roosting site in February 2012 as the guest of the filmmakers. Trail and Brugger later moved to Austin, Texas. They separated in 1991 and eventually divorced, after 18 years of marriage and one son. She attended Austin Community College and later the University of Texas at Austin, earning a degree in social work in 1996. In 1995 she married fellow social worker George Trail. She worked as a case manager for an Austin nonprofit organization until her retirement.

Biography  Sergei Mihailovich Dukhovskoi was born in 1838 into a non-noble family. His grandfather Peter Sergeiivich Ierei (1772-1819) was a Russian Orthodox priest in a village outside Nizhny Novgorod. Peter Sergeiivich served the Holy Spirit Church, which was the origin of the new family name ‚ÄúDukhovskoi‚Äù adopted by the priest's son Mikhail Petrovich (1796-1888). Dukhovskoi's father matriculated at the Nizhny Novgorod Theological Seminary, where he later served from 1814-1818 as a teacher. His father then worked as an instructor and inspector at the local theological school and taught Latin at the Nizhny Novgorod Gymnasium for ten years. He was employed by the Department of Treasury before becoming Director of the Clerical Office and senior accountant of the Artillery Department as a collegiate councilor. Dukhovskoi's mother, Elena Matveevna Alymova (1812-1840), died while her son was still young. After graduating from the Cadet Corps, Dukhovskoi entered the Leib Guard Mounted-Grenadiers Regiment as an ensign in 1855. Later that year, he was enrolled in a program with a scientific emphasis at the Nikolaevskii Engineering Academy. Dukhovskoi completed his studies and was posted to an unspecified front regiment. He was awarded the rank of Lieutenant in 1859 and, after a brief reprieve from military service, enrolled at the Nikolaevskii Academy of the General Staff in 1860 to pursue the ‚Äúhigher military sciences‚Äù. At the time of Dukhovskoi's enrollment, courses at the academy included Tactics, Military History and Strategy, Military Administration, Military Statistics, Geodesics, Mapping, Russian Language, Fortification, Artillery, Political History, Jurisprudence, Political Economics, and Military Law. A year after his arrival at the academy, he was promoted to the rank of Staff Captain. In 1862, Dukhovskoi graduated from the Nikolaevskii Academy of the General Staff and was appointed to the General Staff of Russian forces in the Caucasus region headquartered out of Tbilisi. His first assignment was to compile a series of articles on the neighboring Dagestan Oblast. Upon his return in the fall of 1863, he joined the Dahovskii detachment in a number of military campaigns in the Kuban Oblast. This involved exploring unmapped terrains, driving out mountain peoples, and establishing Cossack stanitsas. In 1864, he was elevated to the rank of Captain of the General Staff, and in this capacity he continued to serve the regiment in operations throughout the Northern Caucasus. In recognition of his efforts on the battlefield, he was awarded the rank of Lieutenant Colonel in 1865, and two years later was made a Colonel. He remained in the region, serving the Russian army in a variety of capacities at the Clerical Office of the Kuban Oblast and then the Caucasus Military District in Tbilisi. His rise through the military ranks continued in 1873 when he became a General Major. During the Ottoman-Russian War of 1877-78, he led a maneuver against Ottoman forces in Ardagan, for which he later received the St. George Cross. He also fought in battles in Eastern Turkey at Kars, the Aladzhin Heights and Erzerum. In the aftermath of the hostilities, Dukhovskoi was appointed the head of the demarcation commission tasked to draw up new boundaries between the Ottoman and Russian empires. He was also Governor of Erzerum for a brief period of time before the Ottomans reoccupied the city. When the campaign ended in 1879, he was stationed as Chief of Staff of the Moscow Military District. In this capacity, Dukhovskoi was involved in the coronation ceremonies for Alexander III in 1883 and oversaw the training of the tsar's forces in Russia and abroad. After being conferred the title of General-Lieutenant in 1886, Dukhovskoi oversaw maneuvers for a variety of War Districts in the empire. He was appointed to the Pri-Amur Governor-Generalship in 1893. Dukhovskoi was commander of the Russian navy in the Far East and is remembered as having done much to further both the cultural life of the region and the position of the armed forces stationed there. In May 1896, he was a participant at the coronation festivities for Tsar Nicholas II. At the end of the month, he was assigned to head the Vladivostok Military District for a three-year period. However, the assignment was ended prematurely with Dukhovskoi's appointment to the Governor-Generalship of Turkestan on March 28, 1898 in the aftermath of the Andizhan Uprising. The attack led by Dukchi Ishan on the Russian garrison in the Ferghana Valley was the defining event of the Governor-General's short tenure. Much of his time was spent in St. Petersburg on business matters related to the revolt. On one occasion, he remained in the capital for five months (12/16/1898-05/27/1899), followed soon after by another three-month stint. On January 1, 1901 Dukhovskoi was granted retirement. Simultaneously, he became a member of the State Council, where he served as an advisor to the tsar until he departed from Russia to recover from illness. Dukhovskoi had contracted malaria while serving in Turkestan and died on April 7, 1901. Tsar Nicholas II attended the panikhida in St. Petersburg and personally spoke with Dukhovskoi's grieving widow. The high-ranking officer was buried in the cemetery of Alexander Nevskii Lavra. He left behind no children, and his wife Princess Barbara Golitsyn would live another thirty years, ending her days in abject poverty in the Soviet Union.

The casino was evacuated and fire crews attempted to contain the fire for several hours. The fire burned above the sprinkler systems reach in what are known as void spaces, inside walls and above hung ceilings. Inside the void spaces the fire was able to spread quickly and decimate the entire entertainment complex. It took a significant portion of the cities fire department several hours to bring the blaze under control. The fire resulted in no fatalities however two guest were transported to a nearby hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. While the gaming complex itself was untouched by the fire the entire entertainment area was a total loss. The roof collapsed on the kitchen and ballroom area taking with it one of the large pyramid structures that sat atop the roof. The fire and the casinos subsequent closing was potentially catastrophic for the local economy. The Empress employed over 800 people and was Joliet's second largest tax payer. The month before the fire the casino paid a reported $837,000 in taxes to the city along with $1.8 million to the state of Illinois. In a press conference after the fire the Empress Casino said it was losing $500,000 in revenue every day it remained closed. Nearby business also reported a dip in revenue. During the same press conference the general manager said \\"We will be paying our employees for up to 90 days with full pay and full benefits and for the tip folks, we're going to be paying them 50 percent of any of their reported tip income.\\" After being closed for 97 days the casino was able to reopen the gaming area which was renovated after the fire. The Empress Casino reopened on June 25, 2009, as the Hollywood Casino Joliet. The new casino, still owned by Penn National Gaming, abandoned the Egyptian theme for an art-deco Hollywood styling. In honor of the new casino \\"Empress Drive\\" was renamed \\"Hollywood Blvd.\\" and the address changed to: 777 Hollywood Blvd. Joliet, IL 60436. The hotel and RV park still remain open but with diminished amenities. The hotel closed its pool and business/conference center. Unlike the casino the hotel did not undergo any significant renovations and still retains the Egyptian exterior styling. The roof of the shower area at the entrance to the RV park still retains its pyramid top. Lawsuits In 2008 the Empress Casino was one of four plaintiffs in the Supreme Court of Illinois case Empress Casino v. Giannoulias. The suit challenged an imposed tax on the grounds that it was unconstitutional. On October 23, 2012, lawyers representing the former Empress Casino filed a lawsuit against the six companies involved in the renovations at the time of the fire. The lawsuit claimed $83.5 million in damages resulting from 11 counts of negligence and willful and wanton conduct. The suit claims that the company did not provide a fire extinguisher near the welder as he worked and that the cleaning company employed failed to remove all the grease residue properly. The suit cites the architect, engineer, and supplier for failure to include sprinkler systems in the attic and truss spaces.

USFWS. It occurs over away from the nearest T. andersonii.Trifolium friscanum. NatureServe. This is a low-growing dwarf plant with a taproot and woody stem. It is no more than tall. Each leaf is made up of three leaflets coated in silvery hairs. The inflorescence contains 4‚Äì9 reddish purple flowers. This plant grows in pinyon-juniper and sagebrush ecosystems. Other plants in the habitat include Ephedra viridis (Mormon tea), Gutierrezia sarothrae (snakeweed), Cercocarpus intricatus (dwarf mountain- mahogany), and Petradoria pumila (rock goldenrod). The local region is home to other rare plants, including Eriogonum soredium (Frisco buckwheat) and Lepidium ostleri (Ostler's peppergrass). Frisco clover is known as a \\"narrow endemic\\" because it grows on a particular substrate: gravelly and bouldery volcanic soils, Ordovician limestone, and dolomite. There are only five populations of this plant. The total population of the plant is not certain because it is difficult to count individuals of this mound-forming species. Also, some occur on private property where access is restricted.Tilley, D. 2012. Plant Guide for Frisco clover (Trifolium friscanum). USDA-Natural Resources Conservation Service, Aberdeen, ID Plant Materials Center. The main two threats to the species' survival are mining and nonnative species. Mining has occurred in the region for a long time, as the substrates are rich in silver, zinc, lead, gold, and copper. Gravel quarrying has also occurred. There are many old mine shafts in the area. Most mining has ceased now, but some local areas are vulnerable to continuing mining activity. Three of the five remaining populations of the plant are located at mining sites. Introduced plant species are also a threat to this species. The most notorious is Bromus tectorum, cheatgrass. It grows in the area, and the aforementioned mining activity actually encourages its spread. Cheatgrass encourages fire in this area, which is not fire-adapted.

Description  The sculpture explores contrasting ideas in South Asian culture while providing a contemporary take on traditional South Asian art. The wood from which the statue is crafted, along with the indigo blue colour that it is painted, are symbolic nods to the handicraft industries of South Asia. The buxom female form is also seen readily in historical South Asian arts.

Altaf describes this real-life woman, Kunti, as a normal, confident woman, who was dehumanized for possessing knowledge. Altaf started off by drawing the figure, then used clay to model it. The final sculpture, based on the clay model, is carved out of teakwood. Since it was not possible to carve the entire sculpture from one piece of wood, Altaf carved the torso and head as one piece, while the arms and legs have been carved separately.

This variety of Moa originated in Jaynagar city of South 24 Parganas district in the Indian State of West Bengal. It is now a popular sweet, being produced in Kolkata and elsewhere, sometimes with cheaper ingredients and chemical flavours. Jaynagarer Moa was given a Geographical Indication tag in 2015 which will enable the product to be protected from unauthorized uses and piracy. History Jaynagarer Moa is made with Nolen Gur (jaggery made from date palm tree extract with exquisite taste and aroma), Kanakchur khoi (a form of popped rice made from a special variety of aromatic rice), Gawa ghee (a type of clarified butter made from cow's milk), ' (cardamom), and posto (poppy seed). Both Nolen Gur and Kanakchur rice are winter products (available around November to January) and hence Jaynagarer Moa is available during this period only. The ordinary or common Moa is a small crispy ball made of puffed rice (\\"Muri\\" rather than \\"Khoi\\") and jaggery. It is produced in homes all over Bengal and is also generally available in grocery shops in small plastic packets, throughout the year. There are over 250 sweetmeat shops around Jaynagar city, which produce Jaynagarer Moa with the original ingredients. The Jaynagarer Moa manufacturers in Jaynagar city had been attempting to get Geographical Indication status for Jaynagarer Moa. Challenges The popularity of the dish has led in recent years to sweetmeat makers all over West Bengal, particularly Kolkata, producing large quantities of Jaynagarer Moa using cheaper ingredients flavoured with chemical aromatics and marketing them as Jaynagarer Moa. Date palm jaggery is becoming harder to come by due to the decrease in the number of date palms in West Bengal and the shift of members of the Shiuli community, traditional producers of \\"Nolen Gur\\" from date palm juice, to other professions. Similarly, Kanakchur rice is a local variant which grows only in winter and through traditional fertiliser-free techniques only.

History Llama effigy (earthenware, slip paint) Not much is known about the Chancay civilization, which developed in the later part of the Inca Empire. This culture emerged after the fall of the Wari civilization. Parts of the southern Chancay area were conquered by the Chim√∫ in the early 1400s, and by about 1450 CE the Incas were occupying both areas. The Chancay likely had a centralized political structure and formed a small regional state. Thus the Chancay culture declined in the later 15th century, as the Inca Empire expanded into their lands. Occupying the central coast coastal region of Peru, the Chancay were centered mostly in the Chancay and Chill√≥n valleys, although they also occupied other areas such as the Rimac and Lurin valley areas. The center of the Chancay culture was located 80 kilometers north of Lima. It is a desert region but has fertile valleys bathed by rivers and is rich in resources that allowed for, among other things, extensive agricultural development. The Chancay developed intense trade relations with other regions, allowing them to interact with other cultures and settlements in a wide area. Economy Model funeral cortege (silvered copper, cotton, reeds, feathers) The Chancay culture based its economy on agriculture, fishing and trade. Water reservoirs and irrigation canals were built by engineers in order to develop agriculture. As the culture was geographically located on the oceanfront, they were involved in traditional fishing both from the shore as well as further out to sea from their caballitos de totora, an ancient type of watercraft unique to Peru. The Chancay also traded with other regions either by land towards the Peruvian highlands and jungle or by sea to the north and south of their borders. The settlements in Lauri, Lumbra, Tambo Blanco, Handrail, Pisquillo Chico and Tronconal focused mainly on artisans producing large-scale ceramics and textiles. The Chancay culture is the first of the Peruvian cultures that had mass production of ceramics, textiles and metals such as gold and silver which were ritualistic and domestic goods. They were also noted for their wood carved items. The curacas, political leaders, regulated the production of artisans, farmers and ranchers in addition to overseeing festive activities. Textiles Mantle border fragment of funerary cloth with anthropomorphic feline figures The most well-known Chancay artefacts are the textiles which ranged from embroidered pieces, different types of fabrics decorated with paint. A variety of techniques, colours and themes were used in the making of textiles. They used an array of colours including yellows, browns, scarlet, white, blues and greens. In type of fabric used include llama wool, cotton, chiffon, and feathers. Their technique involved were decorated open weave, brocade, embroidery, and painting. Brushes were used to paint anthropomorphic, zoomorphic, geometric and other creative designs directly on the canvases. The Chancay are known for the quality of their painted tapestries. The typically geometric designs also included drawings of plants, animals such as fish, cats, birds, monkeys and dogs (most notably the hairless Peruvian dog) as well as human figures. Some of the human fiber sculptures are elaborate and include such scenes as a mother teaching her daughter to weave on a backstrap loom. Birds and deities wearing crescent-like headdresses were one of the more common decorative features. They produced a variety of goods such as clothing, bags, and funeral masks. Textile fragment with design of stylized birds and humans Many Chancay textiles survive to date. It is believed that their production was quite extensive, due to the quantities that have been preserved. The quality of the textile material appears to be good as they were carefully made. Canvases or gauzes were used primarily for religious and magical purposes. They were made for covering the head of the dead in the form of a headdresses. According to the beliefs of the time, the threads on these fabrics had to be spun in the form of an \\"S\\" in an anticlockwise direction. This thread, which had a magical character, was called lloque and, according to legend, the garments were infused with supernatural powers and served as protection in the afterlife. Feathers were inserted into a main thread which was then sewn onto the fabric. The Chancay also manufactured dolls and other objects covered with pieces of woven fabric and various threads. Ceramics Anthropomorphic urn Ceramics are also a very common feature of the Chancay culture. This pottery has been found mainly in the cemeteries of the Ancon and Chancay valleys, for example at Ancon (archaeological site). The Chancay civilization produced ceramics on a large scale using moulds. However, open vessels with more than 400 different types of drawings that have yet to be decrypted, uniquely created by artisans, have been found. The technique used in creating ceramics was with a rough matt surface that was later painted with a dark colour, usually black or brown, on top of a lighter cream or white background. this dark on light characteristic is known as black on white. Ceramic vessel (earthenware, slip paint) Vessels are often large and quaintly shaped. Egg-shaped jars are some of the more common. Ceramic dolls or female figurines were also created. These were usually large, female-looking dolls made from clay. The faces and sometimes the upper sections of the body are covered with ornaments of different geometric shapes. Imprints of textiles on some ceramic human effigies demonstrate that human figures, often painted nude with body art, were dressed in real clothing, granting them reality and vital energy. The eyes were accentuated with a line on each side and the arms were usually short. These geometric ornamentations are very common on Chancay ceramics. Other common ceramic vessels were oblong jars with narrow necks and wide mouths, with designs in the form of human faces and geometric shapes painted in the black on cream technique. Other common animal shapes are birds or llamas. Another common class of items were cuchimilcos, small standing human-shaped idols with prominent jaws, wide black painted eyes, and prominent modeled genitalia. These figures are particularly notable for their unusual bodily position, which is characterized by upwardly extended arms with palms that face the viewer. The palms are often blackened. These figures have been found in the tombs of Chancay nobility. Woodwork Wooden idol. The wood carvings done by the Chancay are characterized by their simplicity, sobriety and use of shapes from nature, quite opposed to the sophistication of their textile art. From wood they produced implements of daily use, statues and items for decoration, some of which they painted. Using the wood from their coastal desert the Chancay carved large and small objects, finely engraved with motifs reflecting the marine environment, such as seabirds and boats. Mummy mask with wig They also manufactured tools for use in the textile work, in farming and fishing operations, as well as a variety of objects for worship and to distinguish the social status of the populace. Human heads carved in wood were common. They were used to crown the mummies of important dignitaries, as a mark of their status as deity or mythical ancestor, which they acquired after death. The human images in wood could also be indicators of political power, especially when they were carved into sticks or batons of command. Architecture and social organization Model tray for making chicha (silvered copper) With respect to architecture, this civilization is noted for creating large urban centres with pyramid-shaped mounds and complex buildings. It was organized by different types of settlements or ayllus and controlled by leaders or curacas. The urban centres had typical constructions for civic- religious purposes which also included residential palaces. These urban centers were quite large, perhaps due to the mass production of goods. Solid clay idol called cuchimilco from the Chancay culture. Their culture was marked by social stratification, which was also present in the small towns. The constructions were mostly made of adobe bricks, were organized in clusters and were also similarly designed according to a specific pattern. Sometimes the most prominent constructions were mixed or combined with stones. Its inhabitants were settled based on their trade so that they could massify the production of goods. Access to the pyramids was through ramps, i.e. from top to bottom. Their hydraulic engineering works such as reservoirs and irrigation canals were also of great notoriety.

He also served as the frontman for Laughing Hyenas and Easy Action.  History =Early Years= John Brannon was born on August 15, 1961, in Pontiac, Michigan. His father was a minister and would take preaching jobs, moving between New York, New Jersey and Michigan, and finally settling in Detroit. Brannon's parents divorced when he was 9 years old and he embraced rock and roll. Brannon was discovered by guitarist Mike Levitt who was delivering newspapers to Brannon's house when he heard him singing an Alice Cooper song from inside the house in 1975. Knowing each other from middle school, Brannon was drafted to sing in Fallout, a group with Levitt on guitar, John Wise on bass and vocals, and Tom Wisely on drums and vocals. The band enjoyed great popularity on the east side of Detroit, and with a sound that was influenced by glam rock but came out louder and more like punk rock, played to packed houses at various venues such as Notre Dame and Regina high schools, and the Grosse Pointe War Memorial. Response was so great to Fallout that the band became known for riots and violence after incidents at a series of shows in the summer of 1976. The band also put on nightly shows attended by hundreds of people in the basement of Brannon's mothers house, which had been painted black and converted to a rehearsal and performance venue by the band. After winning the Grosse Pointe battle of the bands twice, Fallout broke up due to creative tensions between Wise and Wisely who wanted to pursue progressive and folk rock, and Brannon and Levitt who wanted to play louder and less commercial material. Within a few weeks, Brannon formed the band Static, and Levitt left to join another group. Static was heavily influenced by the glam acts of the time, such as Alice Cooper and the New York Dolls, and would dress up and stage theatrical performances. Eventually Brannon grew disinterested in the scene and became drawn to the more aggressive nature of punk rock and hardcore. =Negative Approach and Laughing Hyenas= In August 1981, he formed Negative Approach with Pete Zelewski. Zelewski soon departed and Brannon was joined by Chris \\"Opie\\" Moore and Graham and Rob McCulloch. The line-up recorded a 10 song 7\\" EP and Tied Down, their sole full-length album, and released it through Touch and Go Records in 1983. Artistic differences and tension within the group caused the members to disband and pursue separate projects. Brannon then formed the Laughing Hyenas with Larissa Strickland from L-Seven in 1985. The band released three studio albums and two EPs before disintegrating in 1995.

At age seventeen, he enrolled at the University of Tennessee for one year and afterwards attended Hiram College in Hiram, Ohio where he received an A.M. Johnson received an LL.D. from Christian University (now, Culver-Stockton College) in Canton, Missouri. In October 1877 after studying the New Testament, Johnson preached his first sermon and decided to dedicate his life to ministry. Johnson married Emma Elizabeth Strawn in Dunnville in Ontario, Canada on December 31, 1884, and they moved to South Carolina to be evangelists, starting churches and encouraging the growth of existent churches. In South Carolina, Johnson founded a popular correspondence Bible school. With the goal of training preachers, especially those who could not afford to pay for it, Johnson founded The School of the Evangelist in 1893 on farm land which had formerly been owned by his great grandfather along the French Broad River. He began the school with $100, ten acres of land, two mules, three cows, and one student: Albert T. Fitts of South Carolina. In 1891, Emma gave birth to a stillborn child and almost died herself during childbirth, and she was unable to have further children. Ashley Johnson went on to write numerous books and articles. Johnson died during an operation in Baltimore, Maryland on January 14, 1925 and was buried on the Heights on the college campus.

It hosts various exhibitions and art collections of famous artists, sculptors and different civilizations. It is situated in the Cowasji Jehangir Hall, near Regal Cinema in Colaba. History The idea of a National art gallery was first mooted in 1949, and further developed by Prime Minister Jawahar Lal Nehru and Maulana Azad, bureaucrats such as Humayun Kabir and the local art community. Vice-president Dr. S.Radhakrishnan formally inaugurated the NGMA in the presence of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and artists and art lovers of the city on 29 March 1954. The choice of Jaipur House, one of the premier edifices of Lutyens‚Äô Delhi, signified the envisaged high profile of the institution. Designed by Sir Arthur Blomfield, as a residence for the Maharaja of Jaipur, the butterfly-shaped building with a central dome was built in 1936. It was styled after a concept of the Central Hexagon visualised by Sir Edwin Lutyens. It was Lutyens, along with Herbert Baker, who visualized and gave shape to the new capital in Delhi. Along with buildings designed for other princely potentates like Bikaner and Hyderabad, Jaipur House girded the India Gate circle. NGMA's inauguration was marked by an exhibition of sculptures. Prominent sculptors of the time including Debi Prasad Roy Chowdhury, Ramkinkar Baij, Sankho Chaudhuri, Dhanraj Bhagat, Sarbari Roy Chowdhury and others had participated. The show was prepared by NGMA's first curator Herman Goetz. A noted German art historian, Goetz had earlier been responsible for setting up the Baroda Museum. The Gallery is run and administered as a subordinate office to the Department of Culture, Government of India, and showcases the changing art forms through the passage of the last hundred and fifty years starting from about 1857 in the field of Visual art and Plastic arts.

The gallery organizes and hosts talks on art and culture by eminent speakers, seminars, film screenings as well as workshops and guided walks throughout the year. History The National Gallery of Modern Art The gallery was being refurbished in 2006 to open as the third site of NGMA. This follows a prolonged period of development and controversy. The sprawling, 100 year old Manikyavelu Mansion once belonged to Vilum Manickavelu Mudaliar the, a Yuvaraja of Mysore. Mudalier was not born into aristocracy, but rather married into it. He became a successful business owner after leasing several manganese and chrome mines on lease. According to the documents in the NGMA archives, the building was bought by Mudalier early on in his career. The archivists at the NGMA are certain that Mudalier and his family lived in the mansion for quite some years. However, due to financial problems, the house was put on auction and was acquired by the City Improvement Trust, currently the BDA, and then transferred to the Housing Board in the 1960s. In 2000, the Ministry of Kannada and culture sub-leased the mansion to the Ministry of Culture. It became the chosen location for the southern centre the NGMA. Restoration began in 2003, and opened on 18th February, 2009 under the curatorial ship of Sobha Nambisan.

The simple yet modern-looking style of the factory's plates began in 1888 when Royal Copenhagen (then Den Kongelige Porcelainsfabrik) designed a series of plates with its well-known logo of three waves and a royal crown, all in blue. Crown Princess Louise liked them so much that she immediately bought one. The news spread like quickly, causing people to rush out to buy them.\\"Royal Copenhagen Juleplatter fylder 100 √•r\\" , Binvest.dk. Retrieved 19 February 2013. Designs The design of Royal Copenhagen's first Christmas plate in 1908 was the result of a competition which produced quite a variety of scenes. Thereafter, different artists were invited to provide subjects for the plates, often on the basis of current events. In 1935, for example, the recently completed Little Belt Bridge was shown. One of the best known subjects is a kneeling angel which, in 1945, symbolized a thankful prayer from those who had survived the war. Other well-known symbols of Denmark which have appeared include The Little Mermaid and Tivoli's Pantomime Theatre. Hans Christian Andersen's childhood home appeared in 2005 on the occasion of the author's 200th anniversary. Christmas plates are produced using a special technique known as Danish underglaze. On the basis of the artist's drawing, the design is copied to a plaster mold from which the plates are produced. Each plate is individually painted with a blue underglaze after which it is glazed and fired.

Description During Senior Week, recently graduated high school and college seniors go to the beach to spend time with their friends. This observance typically occurs during the last half of May and most of June. During Senior Week, the graduates rent condos, beach houses or hotel rooms and enjoy each other's company. Graduates often party and participate in various beachside activities during Senior Week. Some popular Senior Week destinations include Dewey Beach, Delaware; Myrtle Beach, South Carolina; Outer Banks, North Carolina; Ocean City, Maryland; Panama City Beach, Florida; Virginia Beach, Virginia; and Wildwood, New Jersey. Ocean City, Maryland has several events catered to Senior Week which include Play it Safe, the Ocean City Car Show, & Dew Tour. Graduates are able to ride the bus free during senior week if they are to participate in any of the Ocean City-run Play it Safe events which include volleyball, miniature golf, paintballing, and karaoke. Myrtle Beach, South Carolina has become one of the most popular locations for recent graduates to visit in May and June. Many students participate in the Myrtlemaniac Card club and entertainment program which includes a series of themed events, a concert, and discounts on transportation, food and other activities. Controversy During Senior Week, some of the recently graduated high school students participate in illegal activities such as underage drinking, breaking local curfews, and causing excessive noise. Many beach towns have taken various steps to combat the illegal aspects of Senior Week, such as increasing the number of police officers on patrol to write tickets and arrest people for illegal activities. In Wildwood, New Jersey, a \\"Rowdy House\\" ordinance was implemented in 2010 where homeowners would receive a warning if the police are repeatedly called to the house for underage drinking or excessive noise. Following the warning, property owners can receive a fine of up to $1,000 and could lose their mercantile licenses. In Ocean City, Maryland, the Play it Safe program run by the town helps discourage the graduates from participating in illegal activities. In Dewey Beach, Delaware, officers from the police department travel to schools in the spring to remind students that underage drinking will not be tolerated in the town; this action has led to the decline of Dewey Beach as a Senior Week destination. In popular culture The film The Graduates is about a group of high school graduates from Maryland who go to Ocean City, Maryland for Senior Week.

It was built in the 1910s and closed in 1991. It is listed on the State Register of Historic Places, has been classified by the National Trust of Australia, and was listed on the former Register of the National Estate. History The site was originally occupied by a two storey hotel, the Shamrock Hotel, constructed in the 1840s. In 1845 the proprietor of the Shamrock Hotel Perth was Michael Henry Condron. In 1855 Condron invited Lomas Toovey to join him in ownership of the Shamrock Hotel and the following year the hotel was leased to Joseph Aloysius Lucas, who operated the hotel until his death in 1880. In 1883 Daniel Connor, a successful merchant and pastoralist (one of Perth's leading financiers and landholders), purchased the hotel from Lucas' widow, Jane Mary. Connor then leased it to Timothy Quinlan, who subsequently married Connor's daughter, Teresa. Connor died in 1898 and the hotel was transferred into the joint ownership of Quinlan, Michael O'Connor (Connor's eldest son and Quinlan's brother-in-law), Bernard Connor (Connor's third son) and Bernard's wife, Catherine. In 1891 Monica Haynes (Connor's third daughter) replaced Catherine as a joint tenant. In November 1912 tenders were called for the development of a new Shamrock Hotel to the design of Perth architect, John Talbot Hobbs (of Hobbs, Smith and Forbes). The contract was let to prominent builder C. W. Arnott for ¬£48,787. The building was later described as the future Gresham Hotel. Hobbs' design was for a five- storey hotel, which is said to have been the largest in Australia for some time. The building was demolished in 1913. In 1914 the name of the hotel was officially changed to the Savoy Hotel. In 1916 the hotel was advertised as \\"The Ritz of Australia\\". The Savoy also had a theatre at the back, which seated 1,500 patrons. The Savoy Hotel continued operations between World Wars I and II, and in the 1930s part of the bottom of the hotel was given to retail. In April 1930 a fire broke out at the Savoy Hotel, severely damaging the roof, ceiling and fittings of the kitchen. In October 1931 the Betts & Betts shoe store moved into the ground floor shops fronting Hay Street, previously occupied by Fisher Beard & Co. In February 1933 Thomas Davy, the MLA for West Perth (Attorney-General and Minister for Education), died unexpectedly of a heart attack while playing cards with his wife and friends at the hotel. In 1936 William G. Bennett, was responsible for the remodelling of the interior of the Savoy Hotel. During World War II, the Savoy Hotel was taken over by the Army and used as an army club, for the accommodation of commissioned officers. Nearly 100 officers were billeted at the club at any one time. In September 1959 Cecil Brothers purchased the building and adjacent properties from the Connor Estate and in 1961 Betts & Betts took over the whole of the ground floor and created an area that was said to be the largest shoe shop in the world. The hotel was leased and managed by Jack Sheedy, former Australian rules footballer and later player/coach of . Sheedy renamed the hotel, the \\"Savoy Plaza Hotel\\" on the basis that it would give the hotel a more Commonwealth flavour, in reference to the 1962 Empire Games, and tying it in with other nearby buildings, specifically the adjoining Plaza Theatre and Arcade. The hotel closed in June 1991 with all the furniture and fitting sold by the lessee at auction. In 1997 the building was declared dangerous following a dilapidation survey by Wood and Grieve Engineers. In 1989 the Savoy Hotel, including the property to the rear extending to Murray Street, was offered for sale. The site was expected to fetch between $40 and $47 million. It was again offered for sale in 1996 with an expected sale price of $23 million. In 2002 the exterior of the Savoy Hotel building was refurbished, in conjunction with the development of the adjoining David Jones site. In 2009 the hotel site, together with the David Jones site was purchased by Starhill Global REIT for A$114.5 million from Centro Properties. =Savoy Cinema= In March 1954 Lionel Hart established Independent Film Distributors, which opened Perth's first newsreel theatrette, \\"The Liberty\\" in Barrack Street, with 450 seats on a single upper level; the theatrette initially specialised in Continental and other art films. Independent Film Distributors subsequently established a second theatrette on 23 December 1955, which was named \\"The Savoy\\" and located in the basement of the Savoy Hotel in Hay Street in what was previously a billiard saloon. The 300 seat Savoy ran continuous \\"hour shows\\", that is programmes of not less than an hour (though frequently slightly more), starting at 10am and continuing without a break until approximately 11pm, allowing patrons to enter and leave as they pleased, and to stay as long as they wished. Its appeal was particularly to shoppers and others with a short time to spare in the city, so it advertised nursery, powder rooms, free cloak and parcel depository.West Australian, 23 December 1955 The introduction of television brought this to an end, by providing similar programmes free in viewers' own lounge rooms. So, at the Savoy, continuous programming of re-runs of successful feature films replaced the newsreel format; for example in January 1964 seven sessions per day of a Three Stooges' film, in January 1965 eight sessions per day of East of Eden. Even this was difficult to sustain, and the cinema drifted more and more into sensational programming, after the success of films such as London in the Raw, presented in June 1965, to which children under 16 were not admitted. By the time of the \\"R\\" certificate legislation in 1972, the Savoy had a reputation for rather risqu√© programmes, and in 1975 was one of the first cinemas to convert to a policy of screening only R-rated movies, a policy with which it was very successful until the early 1980s. It closed briefly in 1983, then reverted to more conventional programming when taken over by John Marsden later that year, re-opening on 17 November 1983. When Marsden had difficulties with film supply, he sold it to Ken Hill who installed video projection and in February 1987 began to run it as an adult cinema, with topless usherettes. The cinema closed in August 1991 and its equipment moved to Club X Cinema in the basement of the Club Emporium in Barrack Street. In 1997, the building that housed the old Savoy was still there, but the cinema staircase and entrance had been demolished, and shops extended across these gaps; access was still possible from the laneway behind to the derelict interior, as it was with the rest of the Savoy Hotel.http://www.ammpt.asn.au/CinemaWEB/SITE/view.php?rec_id=0000000068http://inherit.stateheritage.wa.gov.au/Public/Content/PdfLoader.aspx?id=60212f3d-735e-445c-91d4-14079b3ae32a&type;=assessment Heritage value The Savoy Hotel was classified by the National Trust of Australia (WA) on 21 August 1978 and entered into the Register of the National Estate by the Australian Heritage Commission in September 1982.

Wexford, Ireland. An educator turned bookseller, who also contributed various articles and reviews as a writer, he eventually became most known as a collector and publisher of Irish folktales and folklore, particularly from his native County Wexford. Life Kennedy was born in the early part of 1801 in Kilmyshal beyond the outskirts of Bunclody, County Wexford, Ireland, in a financially well-off family of peasant stock. The lived in the village of Kilmyshal until reached age six, and Mount Leinster, which loomed tall over his boyhood hometown served as a backdrop of his first book. The family moved (in 1807) to some district in Castleboro, Killegney civil parish, Co. Wexford; it is known they resided particularly at Coolbawn townland from 1810‚Äì1814. Then in 1814 they moved again three miles east to Courtnacuddy, Rossdroit civil parish., ' (1891). Castleboro Demesne, Killegney Parish; Courtnacuddy, Rossdroit Parish pp. 971‚Äì972. During this period, Patrick went away briefly in 1813 to attend school at Shanowle near Taghmon, staying with his mother's relatives, but this lasted only one or two terms. Subsequently he was schooled closer to home at Cloughbawn, in Clonroche townland. The school was run by the famous \\"Mr. O'Neill\\", and at first Patrick's classes were held at the Cloughbawn Parish Church, until a schoolhouse was erected by the landlord, Robert Carew. Patrick lodged at the home was Morgan Dunne, his room and board paid for by tutoring. The Cloughbawn school had high standards and Patrick would later commend it in writing. His studies there lasted until 1818 or late 1819. In 1819 when he filled a temporary teacher's post at Tombrick School vacated by a friend (O'Brien) who was going to attend the Teachers Training School at Kildare Place. In 1820 or 21, Kennedy himself went to Dublin to enroll in the teacher-training program at Kildare Place (officially called the \\"Society for Promoting the Education of the Poor of Ireland\\"), and was so highly evaluated that after completing the program c. 1821, he was not posted to the school of his landlord as might have been expected, but gained employ at the Society itself as an instructor, or as Junior Assistant to the Superintendent, c. 1822. The Society, which the British Government as the apparatus overseeing the education of the whole of Ireland, was abolished in 1831, due to pressure from the men of the Catholic Emancipation movement. After his place of employment vanished, Patrick Kennedy set him self up as a \\"Drawing Master\\", and as of 1836 his name is found registered with the Dublin Directory as Professor of Drawing. He married Maria Kelly on 24 October 1832. The Commission of Education which replaced the Society emphasized agricultural learning, and when the Glasnevin facility with a farm for practical training and a residence for the trainee teachers were completed in 1838, Kennedy was appointed Superintendent. But he was dismissed shortly after, having quarreled with the farm's manager. He abandoned the teaching profession at some time uncertain, and established a lending-library and bookseller shop on 8 Anglesea Street, Dublin, which he later moved to the Anglesea Street on the corner of Cope Street. Edward Dowden remembered the proprietor \\"with round, bald head, grizzled beard, and a smile and twinkle over all his face\\". Kennedy ran the shop for some thirty years. Kennedy died 29 March 1873. Alfred Webb's A Compendium of Irish Biography (1878) writes that his home often played host to the \\"Hibernian Temperance Association\\", though possibly this is a result of confusion with Dr. Patrick Kennedy, Bishop of Killaloe, associated with Father Mathew's temperance movement. Literary career Kennedy's career in writing began by being published in such periodicals as the Wexford Independent and Duffy's Fireside Magazine. At first contributed articles and reviews, and later began to set down tales from his native Wexford County into writing. = Legends of Mount Leinster = In 1851, writing under the pen name \\"Harry Whitney\\" for the Wexford Independent, Kennedy asked his readership to send him rough accounts of local traditions, so he may print such stories and legends in his \\"Whitney Papers\\" column for the edification of the younger generation. Such stories formed the core of his first book, Legends of Mount Leinster (1855). In the book a cast of characters convene a fireside gathering, telling stories, probably modeled after actual gatherings Kennedy observed. = Legendary Fictions of the Irish Celts = Some of his stories which he sent to Sheridan Le Fanu in 1862 appeared as \\"Leinster Folk Lore\\" in the Dublin University Magazine from 1861 till 1869.. Legendary fictions of the Irish Celts. p. viii. Later, at Le Fanu's encouragement, a full collection was published as Legendary Fictions of the Irish Celts (1866). The first included tale is \\"Jack and His Comrades,\\" later reprinted by Joseph Jacobs. The collected stories were interleaved with a considerable amount of his own narrative: his \\"stories link by running commentary and characterized by often ponderous moralizing\\". \\"The Palace in the Rath\\" is recognized as a folktale of the AT 503 (\\"The Gifts of the Little People\\") type, but Bo Almqvist prefers to regard it as a migratory legend, or, a \\"fabulate\\". From the perspective of later providing material and influencing the Yeats or the Celtic Revival movement, the Legendary Fictions of the Irish Celts was the most important of Kennedy's works, alongside Fireside Stories of Ireland (1870), and Bardic Stories of Ireland (1871). Kennedy's \\"The Belated Priest\\" in Legendary Fictions was the source of Yeats's 1889 poem \\"The Priest and the Fairy\\". = Banks of the Boro = The Banks of the Boro: a Chronicle of the County of Wexford (1867) and Evenings in the Duffrey (1869) are described as the most ambitious of his works, insofar as they each is designed with (an albeit nominal) plot, and the two most important of Kennedy's contribution in the estimation of IFC collector James G. Delaney. These plots were stitched together from actual events he either witnessed himself, \\"or heard secondhand from his friends in the years 1812 to 1822\\". In The Banks of the Boro, Kennedy's alias Harry Whitney (or \\"H. W.\\") still makes appearance. The namesake Whitney family of Moneytucker lived down the road from the Kennedy home at Courtnacuddy. Mr. Whitney of Moneytucker is a hero in the tale of \\"The Fate of the Priest Catcher\\" from the time of the Penal Laws, having sequestered a fleeing priest and assisting his escape. The storyteller states that the Whitney's good deed was remembered, so that some years later, the life of a kinsman (Whitney of Rathnure) was spared in the Irish Rebellion of 1798. But Robert Whitney of Moneytucker testified to suffering a harrowing experience at the hands of the rebels, for his house was plundered and burned, himself taken captive, lashed, and threatened to be killed a number of times. The 1798 rebellion was before Patrick Kennedy's birth, but there were three or four elder siblings who experienced it, and three yeomen came riding in search of rebels at their home, with one searcher about to torch the place down before a comrade intervened. The book contained not just tales and legend, but also ballads performed and the games played (e.g. \\"Old Dowd and his Daughters\\") at wakes. Delaney confirms that even in later times in the region, such pastimes at wakes were often engaged in, in unrestrained and prolonged fashion, particularly if the deceased was a transient, with no close acquaintances to mourn him. = Bardic Stories of Ireland = Bardic Stories of Ireland (1871) was another important work for the Celtic Revival. The tale \\"Baille and Ailinn\\" in this coll ection was adapted by Yeats into the poem \\"Baile and Aillinn\\". Critical evaluation  Patrick Kennedy was one of the pioneers in uncovering Irish folkloric material, with a lasting impact on William Butler Yeats and the Celtic Revival movement. The tales were told in rusticated English of the Irish peasantry who had established roots in The Pale, the part of Ireland. He is \\"widely credited with preserving Irish idioms in the turn of phrase, sentence structure, Irish words\\". Kennedy's folklore- collecting has been assessed as \\"unfailingly accurate\\" by James G. Delaney, a folklore collector for the Irish Folklore Commission who has conducted field work largely in the Midlands, but began his career in 1954 collecting folklore in areas of Wexford where Kennedy grew up., Kennedy was also assiduous about recording folklore for the sake of it being tradition deserving to be preserved, even in the cases of a particular ballad he did not have high opinion of, or the custom of irreverently playing games and singing ballad, for which he privately held reservations. Bo Almqvist also compares Kennedy favorably to Thomas Crofton Croker as folktale collector, and although Kennedy did to add literary flair and contrived humour, or somewhat dwelled on stereotypes of the Irishman such as his love for alcohol, but did not take license and tamper with the tales in a major way compared with Croker. Kennedy's tales from Co. Wexford, mostly recalled from memory as told in English during his youth, are valuable since they preserve the folklore of a region that became somewhat neglected from folklore-collection subsequently in the 19th century.

Maspeth High School opened in September 2011 with 273 students at the Metropolitan Avenue Campus in Forest Hills, Queens and serves primarily students from NYC District 24 in Northern Queens. Maspeth High School is a traditional, open enrollment, district public school. Currently Maspeth High School serves grades 9-12 and has 1209 students. Maspeth High School has over 40 clubs and 27 varsity sports teams. Maspeth's teams are known as the Argonauts.  History  After one year at the Metropolitan Campus on Metropolitan Avenue, Maspeth High School moved to its own building located at 54-40 74th Street in Maspeth, Queens, adjacent to the Long Island Expressway and between 57th Avenue and Grand Avenue. The founding principal of Maspeth High School is Khurshid Abdul-Mutakabbir who proposed a classical high school model to the New York City Department of Education in December 2010. His proposal was accepted on January 4, 2011 and matched to the newly constructed Maspeth High School campus building for opening the following September.  Scandals  Maspeth High School has found itself in a couple scandals since it had gained attention with its various achievements, such as earning the prestigious Blue Ribbon award.https://www.qchron.com/editions/central/maspeth-hs-earns-national-blue- ribbon-school-honor/article_4e750ac8-c8d4-11e8-8c45-9bd1f6609408.html One of the major scandals was in 2016, when the school was accused of not accepting applicants from private schools despite its lottery system, though the school claimed it was an \\"error.\\"https://www.ny1.com/nyc/queens/news/2017/03/29/parents-demand- transparency-and-overhaul-of-maspeth-high-school-enrollment-process-after-mix- up This led to several protests from angry parents and teenagers alike, who hoped to get into a school with such a high reputation. This offense later did not catch as much attention anymore, as there weren't any reports about this \\"mix up\\" the following school year. A more serious accusation broke out on September 14, 2019, when the New York Post journalist Susan Edelman wrote in depth about the accusations past teachers, as well as some students that graduated, made against the school. The anonymous speakers claimed the school falsified grades for students and forced teachers to pass failing students and had a \\"gangster culture,\\" according to city councilman Robert Holden.https://nypost.com/2019/09/14/maspeth-high-schools-secret-to-high-pass- rates-is-cheating-teachers/ There were also claims by the journalist that the students at the school called the phenomenon the \\"Maspeth Minimum,\\" many students claimed on various social media when the article came out that no one called it this, so it's likely this phrase was from a blog of a former student from Maspeth that was highly critical of the school in 2018.http://chaz11.blogspot.com/2018/07/maspeth-high-school-just-say-no-to- any.html Edelman then wrote another article two days later on the 16th, explaining DA John M. Ryan was planning to hold Maspeth High School legally accountable after reading about the accusations. Also a noteworthy section of the article, one of the people working for the Post claimed to have interviewed a freshman named Charlie, who said the situation was, \\"BS.\\" Some people at Maspeth argue whether or not the teen was using an alias. The most recent article written by the post was on the 21st of the same month, where an alum named Thomas \\"Mac\\" Creighton goes in detail about his drug and alcohol abuse, and how he believes the school did nothing to help and only focused on getting rid of him by letting him graduate six months early with minimal work after transferring to the school his senior year. He also claimed the school was aware of his problem and made no effort to care, from guidance counselors acting indifferent towards his ill behavior to claiming a teacher \\"gave him a pot pipe\\" after he graduated.https://nypost.com/2019/09/21/i-was-always- stoned-drunk-and-skipping-class-so-they-let-me-graduate-early-maspeth-alum/ One much older and far less famed article surfaced from 2015 on a blog spot for teachers where several called out how the teachers were young and often not tenured so they were easy to control by superiors.http://nyceducator.com/2015/08/the-maspeth-mystery.html  References  *http://MHS.NYC *http://schools.nyc.gov/SchoolPortals/24/Q585/default.htm *http://www.maspethhighschool.org/ *http://insideschools.org/high/browse/school/1729 *http://www.queensledger.com/view/full_story/21829286/article-Maspeth-High- School-is-officially-open-for-class- *http://gothamschools.org/tag/maspeth- high-school/ *http://www.qchron.com/editions/central/new-maspeth-high-school- cuts-ribbon/article_e5b7d139-d923-5ce4-907e-13fde13b2b75.html *http://queenscourier.com/2013/maspeth-community-welcomes-new-high-school- site/ *http://www.timesledger.com/stories/2011/9/fh_school_hearing_folo_20110224.html *https://www.qchron.com/editions/central/maspeth-hs-earns-national-blue- ribbon-school-honor/article_4e750ac8-c8d4-11e8-8c45-9bd1f6609408.html *https://www.ny1.com/nyc/queens/news/2017/03/29/parents-demand-transparency- and-overhaul-of-maspeth-high-school-enrollment-process-after-mix-up *https://nypost.com/2019/09/14/maspeth-high-schools-secret-to-high-pass-rates- is-cheating-teachers *https://nypost.com/2019/09/14/maspeth-high-schools- secret-to-high-pass-rates-is-cheating-teachers/ *https://nypost.com/2019/09/21/i-was-always-stoned-drunk-and-skipping-class- so-they-let-me-graduate-early-maspeth-alum *http://chaz11.blogspot.com/2018/07/maspeth-high-school-just-say-no-to- any.html *http://nyceducator.com/2015/08/the-maspeth-mystery.html * Educational institutions established in 2011 Maspeth, Queens Public high schools in Queens, New York ","title":"Maspeth High School"},{"id":"38569972","text":"The Municipality of ≈†o≈°tanj (; ) is a municipality in northern Slovenia.
