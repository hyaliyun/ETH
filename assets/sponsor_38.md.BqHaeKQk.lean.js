He has previously played for AZ Alkmaar, Telstar, Kilmarnock, St Mirren and De Graafschap. Career AZ Alkmaar Tesselaar started his professional career in his native Netherlands with HVV Hollandia at age thirteen before joining AZ Alkmaar. In the 2008–09 season, Tesselaar signed his first professional contract, which will keep him until 2010. He did not make a league appearance for the club, but played on loan for Telstar for three seasons with AZ players Furdjel Narsingh and Kevin Brands. At the end of the 2010–11 season, Tesselaar was among eleven players to be released. St Mirren After leaving AZ, Tesselaar went on trial with Scottish Premier League club St Mirren. The first time he arrived there, he said about the club, \\"[I] didn’t know what the group wanted but, after the first week, we saw a little movie of Barcelona and how they press the ball.\\" On 14 July 2011, Tesselaar would later signed for St Mirren on a one-year deal after making impressive display on trial. Upon joining St Mirren, Tesselaar cited joining the club as \\"efforts to play total football.\\" He made his debut against Dunfermline at East End Park on 25 July. On 20 August, he assisted both St Mirren goals for Steven Thomson, who scored both goals in a 2–1 victory at Easter Road against Hibernian. Tesselaar never thought what to expect, but finds the quality good. Tesselaar quickly settled in Scotland and played regularly during the 2011–12 Scottish Premier League season, but their good performances led manager Danny Lennon to offer both Tesselaar and Nigel Hasselbaink improved contracts, only the offer of a new contract at St Mirren to be rejected despite captain Jim Goodwin pleading the duo to sign a new contract. Though making thirty-three appearances, Tesselaar was absent due to an injury that kept him out for six weeks. Kilmarnock Tesselaar signed for Kilmarnock in June 2012 on a two-year contract despite interests from Aberdeen. On his move, Manager Kenny Shiels told STV, \\"We're really happy to get him on board because we've lost Ben Gordon so now we've got competition between Rory McKeown and Jeroen.\\" Tesselaar made his debut for the club, in the opening game of the season, as Kilmarnock drew 0–0 with Dundee, where he started as a left-back in defense. After making four appearance, Tesselaar sustained an injury during a match against Stenhousemuir, in the first round of the Scottish League Cup, which Kilmarnock lose 2–1. Tesselaar was out for six weeks due to a hamstring injury. After two months out, Tesselaar made his return, where he came on for James Dayton in the last minutes, as they beat Celtic, to give their first win at Celtic Park for the first time since 1955. He made his first start since being injured, as Kilmarnock beat Ross County 3–0 on 9 November 2012. He finished his first season at the club, making twenty-six appearance. In his second season, Tesselaar continues to remain in the left-back position until he came off in the sixth minutes in the first half, in a 1–1 draw against Partick Thistle on 21 September 2013. During the season, Tesselaar broke his nose in four occasion that he might wear a protective mask for the rest of his career. In a match against Hearts on 8 March 2014, Tesselaar made national headlines in the Netherlands when he made fabulous way through the legs of Jordan McGhee and then he gave the ball which was scored by Michael Gardyne, in a 4–2 victory. At the end of the 2013–14 season, Tesselaar was offered a new contract by the club. While negotiating a new contract, Tesselaar faced uncertainty over his future: \\"I'm open to everything. A new club is a nice adventure.\\" However, Tesselaar left Kilmarnock in late June. St Mirren Tesselaar re-joined St Mirren on a one-year deal, after leaving Kilmarnock at the end of season 2013–14. The Dutchman previously played for the Saints during season 2011–12 in the Scottish Premier League, making 33 league appearances. Tesselaar's second spell at St Mirren came in the opening game of the season, playing as a left- back, in a 1-0 loss against Motherwell. Tesselaar made his 50th appearance, in a 2-1 loss against Celtic before coming off by half time, due to an injury. Tesselaar then suffered a knee injury that kept him out before scoring and assisting on his return, in a 2-2 draw against Ross County on 25 October 2014. However, Tesselaar came under pressure from St Mirren supporters after an interview with Voetbal International, claiming about negativity of the town of Paisley. Tesselaar later denied those statement he made in the Voetbal International. Nevertheless, Tesselaar continued to be in the first team regular throughout the season. On 29 May 2015, Tesselaar left Saints for a second time in his career, making a total of 36 appearances and scoring once. De Graafschap Tesselaar signed a one-year deal with Eredivisie side, De Graafschap on 14 August 2015 after a successful trial period. Israel He has played for Hapoel Ramat Gan and Hapoel Katamon in Israel.De Nederlander die bij de meest tolerante club van Israël speelde vice.com Personal life Tesselaar is an avid photographer and considered taking photos his second hobby after buying his first camera when he was sixteen. He often bikes or walks to take pictures and took pictures in black and white when he attended photography school.

The 1839 commonwealth survey map shows that the 3 crossing points between the route, the highway, and the creek (white pixels at top, with misaligned hachures to the northeast) were at 3 different points:, , At the easternmost of the 3 points, the railroad company built a single-arch stone bridge for the highway over the creek. (The highway bridge is often misidentified as being for the railway and, with the misnomer \\"viaduct\\" inaccurately indicating multiple arches.) In addition to the never- built Tapeworm Railroad trestle to cross the gap west of the roadway bridge, a Tapeworm Railroad tunnel was planned nearby (top, outlined) through a spur of Jacks Mountain. In 1888–1889, the \\"Western Extension\\" was built by the Baltimore and Harrisburg Railway (bottom) east of the gap, crossing Toms Creek at a lower elevation than the original Tapeworm Railroad route. The Tapeworm Railroad (Gettysburg Rail Road) was a railway line planned by Congressman Thaddeus Stevens and nicknamed by opponents ridiculing a lengthy serpentine section around the Green Ridge of South Mountain after an orator compared the path to a tapeworm depiction on a product's packaging. Switchbacks were planned on the west slope at Hughs Forge along the E Br Antietam Creek (\\"Cold Spring Cr\\" in 1839) and on the east slope at Stevens' 1822 Maria Furnace along Toms Creek (Monocacy River), with 3 east slope tunnels through spurs of Jacks Mountain.

A liquid dosage form is called liquid color. Masterbatch is a concentrated mixture of pigments and/or additives encapsulated during a heat process into a carrier resin which is then cooled and cut into a granular shape. Masterbatch allows the processor to colour raw polymer economically during the plastics manufacturing process. The alternatives to using masterbatches are buying a fully compounded material (which may be more expensive and less open to e.g. color variability of the product), or compounding from raw materials on site (which is prone to issues with achieving full dispersion of the colorants and additives, and prone to preparing more material than what is used for the production run). In comparison with pure pigments, masterbatches require more storage space and their lead times are longer. Another disadvantage is additional exposure of heat (\\"heat history\\") to both the carrier and the additive; this may be important e.g. for marginally thermally stable pigments. As masterbatches are already premixed compositions, their use alleviates the issues with the additive or colorant clumping or insufficient dispersion. The concentration of the additive in the masterbatch is much higher than in the end-use polymer, but the additive is already properly dispersed in the host resin. In a way their use is similar to uses of ferroalloys for adding alloying elements to steels. The use of masterbatches allows the factory to keep stock of fewer grades of the polymer, and to buy cheaper natural polymer in bulk. The masterbatches can be fairly highly concentrated (in comparison with the target composition), with high \\"let-down ratios\\"; e.g. one 25 kg bag can be used for a tonne of natural polymer. The relatively dilute nature of masterbatches (in comparison with the raw additives) allows higher accuracy in dosing small amounts of expensive components. The compact nature of the grains of solid masterbatches eliminates problems with dust, otherwise inherent for fine- grained solid additives. Solid masterbatches are also solvent-free, therefore they tend to have longer shelf life as the solvent won't evaporate over time. The masterbatch usually contains 40-65% of the additive, but the range can be as wide as 15-80% in extreme cases. The carrier material of the masterbatch can be based on a wax (universal carrier) or on a specific polymer, identical or compatible with the natural polymer used (polymer-specific). E.g. EVA or LDPE can be used as carriers for polyolefins and nylon, polystyrene can be used for ABS, SAN, and sometimes polycarbonates. When a carrier different than the base plastic is used, the carrier material may modify the resulting plastic's properties; where this could be important, the carrier resin has to be specified. The usual ratio of masterbatch to the base resin is 1 to 5 percent. Several masterbatches (color and various additives) can be used together. The carrier can also double as a plasticizer (common for liquid masterbatches) or a processing aid. The machines are usually fed with premixed granules of the host polymer and the masterbatch. The final mixing then gets done in the screw and extrusion part of the machine. This is sometimes prone to adverse effects, e.g. separation of the masterbatch and the base material in the machine's hopper. The masterbatch can be also added directly to the machine's screw, as a free-flowing solid or in case of a liquid masterbatch by e.g. a peristaltic pump. Such use of liquid masterbatches allows highly accurate dosing and quick change of color between machine runs. Masterbatches can be used in most processes, except rotational molding and Plastisol and other liquid resin systems.  How is masterbatch produced?  # Weighing # Mixing # Twin screw extruding # Cutting and cooling # Sieving # Bagging  Advantages of using Masterbatch in plastic manufacturing  Masterbatch brings many advantages for the final plastic products: PRODUCTIVITY: Masterbatch can increase volumetric output (as a result of thermal conductivity & volumetric expansion to temperature). In addition, it has ability to downgauge due to higher film physical properties. TOTAL COST SAVE: With the large percentage of CaCO3 powder in component, masterbatch helps manufacturers reduce material cost by using less energy to run the machine due to higher CaCO3 specific heat. PHYSICAL PROPERTY: Masterbatch helps plastic improve a lot of physical property such as: * Higher toughness * Flexural stiffness * Adhesion * Printability Applications of masterbatches Additive masterbatches modify various properties of the base plastic: * ultraviolet light resistance * flame retardant * anti-fouling * anti-static * lubrication * anti-slip * corrosion inhibitors for metals packaged in plastic * anti-microbials * anti-oxidants / polymer stabilizers * extrusion aids * phosphorescence * anti-counterfeit * product security Masterbatch is used in the following areas: * Blown film & lamination * PP raffia/Yarn * PP non-woven fabric * Blow molding * Injection molding * Thermoformed sheet * HDPE/PP pipe extrusion * Polyester and Nylon yarn Notes Category:Plastics Category:Dyes ","title":"Masterbatch"},{"id":"32533528","text":"Neue Berliner Musikzeitung was a musical periodical that appeared in the years 1847-1896 and was published by Bote & Bock.

He broke his maiden at Aqueduct Racetrack in his second attempt and followed that up with a second in allowance company. In his fourth lifetime start, his connections decided to take a big step up in class and entered him in a graded stakes race: the one- turn, one-mile Withers Stakes, which he won in 1:36.40 under jockey Jean-Luc Samyn at Aqueduct Racetrack. Three weeks later, his trainer took a shot at the second jewel of the Triple Crown. The Preakness Stakes is run at a mile and three sixteenths on dirt at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland. In that race, Play On was listed as the fourth favorite in a field of ten colts at 8:1 odds. The prohibitive odds-on favorite was Swale, the Kentucky Derby winner. Play On broke from the outside in the tenth post position and settled in mid-pack. Around the clubhouse turn and down the backstretch, Fight Over, Taylor's Special, and Swale led while Play On was reserved behind the leaders in fifth. Going into the final turn, Play On moved inside and took over third, one length behind Gate Dancer and Fight On. Down the stretch, Gate Dancer pulled away to win by 1 1/2 lengths over Play On, who finished strongly under jockey Jean-Luc Samyn to place second by four lengths over a tiring Fight On. Heavy favorite Swale weakened going into the final turn and faded to finish a non-threatening seventh, eight lengths back.

It was the first Greek military unit founded after the German invasion and conquest of Greece in April–May 1941. Background After the failed Italian attack against Greece (October 28 – November 13, 1940), the Greek forces counterattacked and penetrated deep into Italian held Albanian territory. However, with the German intervention in April 1941, Greece capitulated. By April 15, 1941, the Royal Hellenic Air Force was virtually eliminated by the numerically and technically superior German Luftwaffe. Part of the Greek air force personnel managed to escape to Egypt together with five Avro Anson aircraft. These aircraft formed the 13th Light Bomber Squadron during the summer of 1941, which was thus the first Greek military unit formed in the Middle East.The Desert Squadrons, (2008) p. 26 During the following months two additional Greek squadrons were founded, the 335th and 336th Pursuit Squadrons.The Desert Squadrons, (2008) p. 25 Activity Middle East Its first commander was Squadron Leader Spyros Dakopoulos and its initial personnel was mainly provided from the former 13th Naval Cooperation and 32nd Bomber Squadrons to be finally manned by volunteers recruited from the then large Greek resident communities in Egypt.Military History Magazine, vol.144/2008, pp. 62–68 Its first mission was assigned on July 14, 1941.The Desert Squadrons, (2008) p. 27 At December 1941 the Squadron was equipped with Bristol Blenheims Mk IV and based at Dekheila Airfield. The following months it was reequipped with Blenheims Mk V, which were used primarily for maritime patrol missions. Convoy escort and anti-submarine patrols were the main missions of the Squadron during 1942. In various occasions enemy submarines were spotted in the Eastern Mediterranean and bombed. Crew of the Squadron on the day of repatriation to Greece, welcomed by the Greek Prime Minister Georgios Papandreou. From early 1943 the Squadron operated with Martin Baltimores. Apart from anti-submarine patrols and convoy escorts, the Squadron also executed reconnaissance and bombing missions in the occupied Greek islands. At November 12, the fortified German positions at the port of Souda, in Crete, were bombed. In general, the 13th Sqr based in the Middle East counted a total of 1,600 missions with over 4,550 flying hours.The Desert Squadrons, (2008) p. 28 Italy and Greece On May 14, 1944, the Squadron was transferred to southern Italy, where operations included bombing of enemy positions in Yugoslavia and Albania, as part of the Allied Balkan Air Force. During this period it executed a total of 1,400 operations that included bombing train stations, bridges, ammunition and fuel depots.The Desert Squadrons, (2008) p. 29 On November 14, while the Axis troops were retreating from Greece, the aircraft of the Squadron landed in Hassani Airfield (later the Hellenikon Air Base and Ellinikon International Airport), near Athens. Although mainland Greece was liberated, Crete and other islands were still under German occupation. Alongside the Spitfire fighters of the two other Greek Squadrons, 335th and 336th, which had also arrived in Greece, the 13th was engaged in bombing missions against the remaining German garrisons in the Aegean islands and Crete (April–May 1945).The Desert Squadrons, (2008) p. 106 The Squadron was disbanded on April 19, 1946.

It was formed on 1 December 2009 from the amalgamation of the 4th Air and Air Defence Forces Army and 5th Air and Air Defence Forces Army. The command's headquarters was in Rostov-on-Don, and it was responsible for the air defence of the North Caucasus Military District and the Volga-Urals Military District. The command became the 4th Air and Air Defence Forces Army again on 1 August 2015.  Structure  It comprised the 7th Brigade of Missile-Space Defence, in the North Caucasus Military District, and the 8th Military Space Defence Brigade in the Volga-Urals Military District. The 7th Brigade of Missile-Space Defence was formed from the 51st Air Defence Corps. Combat Aircraft contradicted themselves between their text and a table regarding the 4th A&AD; Command in their June 2010 issue. The text followed the above data drawn from warfare.ru, with the table saying that forces in the Volga-Ural Military District would come under the 3rd Air and Air Defence Force Command in the Siberian Military District. The 7th Brigade of Missile- Space Defence was the former 51st Air Defence Corps. In 2000 it had 7,500 personnel of which 2,500 were air crew. It also had 164 aircraft (59 Su-27, 105 MiG-29).

He was a noted literary figure who translated the works of Rudyard Kipling into French.Henriette de Ganay, La Route des Châteaux d'Auvergne, p 42  Description  Built by Astorg d'Aurillac in around 1130, the site occupies a rocky outcrop overlooking the Cère river. Later converted into a comfortable Renaissance dwelling, the château remains a family home. The gardens were redesigned in the 19th century.Sonia Reyne, Valérie Kuhn, Marina Valentin, Petit Futé Auvergne 2010-2011, p 182 The castle was recorded in 1230 as a super novo edificio, later as a repario, and in 1269 as a castrum.Bruno Phalip, Seigneurs et bâtisseurs.: Le château et l'habitat seigneurial en Haute-Auvergne et Brivadois entre le XIème et le XVème siècle, p 111. Presses Universitaires Blaise-Pascal, 2000 The present building has several distinct parts: the north tower (the oldest), the south tower, a rectangular two-floored residence, a pavilion wing with lantern covering forming a dovecote. The whole is surmounted by another floor supported on corbels. The château incorporates sections from various periods. There are elements from the 13th century in the cellars and ground floor and from the 15th century on the first floor. The bulk dates from the 16th century, with heavy remodelling in the 17th century to the upper floors, notably the Imperial dome. * On the first floor is a 15th-century chimney from the Château de Branzac which is entirely painted. This chimney owes its decoration to artists brought from Italy by Camille Carracioli, a Neapolitan princess, wife of the lord of Branzac (1570). * The staircase has landings opening onto the steps through two round arches jointly supported on columns with Doric or Ionic capitals. Each landing is covered by a rib vault. The stone-covered roof has a surface area of 1200 m2. There are 70 windows, some of which retain their 18th-century woodwork. The Château de Conros is open to visitors. It was added to the list of monuments historiques by the French Ministry of Culture on 30 September 1991.

Davies in 1992.Philatelic Collections: Country collections. British Library, 2011. Retrieved 25 July 2011. John N. Davies John Neville Davies (Born 1935) states that he began to collect stamps on 2 September 1940 when his mother paid a bill for £2 and received a receipt bearing a stamp from the British Postal Centenary set of that year which showed both Queen Victoria and King George VI. The stamp was to pay the tax on receipts then current and was therefore used as a revenue stamp. Davies became interested in Libyan stamps while carrying out his national service in Libya\\"NEWS ... from near and far.\\" in The London Philatelist Vol. 101, No. 1198, October 1992, p. 273. between 1954 and 1956, though he bought little material at that time. From 1956 he was able to develop his collection by buying Libyan postal history and postage stamps which no one else seemed interested in. In some cases he was able to buy almost the complete Libyan stock of dealers such as Urch Harris and Proud Bailey who had no other buyers for the material. He left the Army in 1963 and worked subsequently at the British Post Office (1967 -1986) in the Controller's Office and the National Postal Museum. In 1986 he became a curator at the British Library where he was assistant to David Beech. He retired in 1993. Davies is a former Fellow of the Royal Philatelic Society London.\\"Libyan revenues collection given to British Library.\\" in The London Philatelist, Vol. 101, No. 1194, June 1992, p. 193. The Collection In 1991, the printers Bradbury Wilkinson sold part of their archive including revenue stamps produced for the government of Libya from 1955 to 1969. The whole of that part of the archive was purchased personally by John Davies who was at time employed as a curator in the Philatelic Department at the British Library. The archive was in poor condition and required extensive conservation work. The material purchased by Davies was composed solely of file copies of the final issued revenue stamps produced by Bradbury Wilkinson for the Kingdom period. Most of the stamps were for consular fees and all were gummed and unused. All were in full sheets of 10 x 10 although some had become part separated through poor storage. No proofs, essays, specimens or similar material was included, nor was any material from after the 1969 Libyan Revolution. In 1992, Davies donated horizontal strips of five of each stamp to the British Library. The balance of the archive was retained by Davies and none has been sold as of July 2011. No mint examples of the stamps in the archive have been reported and none should be available on the philatelic market. The only mint examples known are in the British Library collection and those retained personally by Davies. The stamps include requisition (order) numbers in the selvedge but the numbers of each stamp printed are not known as the Bradbury Wilkinson requisition books showing that information are missing.

The regiment was raised in January 1862 under Colonel James M. Gee. It served in Kentucky and was surrendered at Fort Donelson in February 1862. Reorganized following its parole and exchange under Colonel Benjamin W. Johnson, the regiment served in Louisiana and was again surrendered at Port Hudson in July 1863. Reorganized again following its second parole and exchange, the regiment was finally merged in September 1864 with several other Arkansas regiments into the 3rd Arkansas Consolidated Infantry Regiment.  Conflicting Designations  There were two other Confederate infantry regiments which received the designation \\"15th Arkansas\\". The first, which was originally commanded by Colonel (later Major General) Patrick Cleburne, was known as the 15th (Josey's) Arkansas Infantry Regiment and the other, originally commanded by Colonel (later Brigadier General) Dandridge McRea, was known as the 15th (Northwest) Arkansas Infantry Regiment.Sikakis, Stewart, Compendium of the Confederate Armies, Florida and Arkansas, Facts on File, Inc., 1992, , page 96,99.

Before its completion as a regiment, the six original companies were sent to defend Fort Henry on the Tennessee River. They were then transferred to the garrison at Fort Donelson on the Cumberland River, some distant.Sikakis, Stewart, Compendium of the Confederate Armies, Florida and Arkansas, Facts on File, Inc., 1992, , page 98.  Battles  In mid-December, 1861, the regiment was ordered to Memphis. Some of the companies began marching eastward from Camden in early January, and at Gaines' Landing on the Mississippi River, took a steamer to Memphis. One company was ordered to Little Rock, then went on to Memphis. The regiment camped for a few days at Memphis, and was then ordered to Fort Heiman, a new fort being constructed on the Tennessee River, arriving around January 28. On February 5, the regiment moved across the river to Fort Henry.\\"The Fifteenth Arkansas Infantry Regiment (Gee-Johnson)\\", Hardys in the Civil War, Accessed 27 November 2011, http://pth.thehardyparty.com/ft_desperate/15th_regiment.htm  Forts Henry and Donelson  The regiment participated in the defense of Fort Henry, and when it was obvious that the fort would be captured, it was hurriedly ordered to march to Fort Donelson to defend that position against the coming Federal attack, leaving behind much of their extra clothing and other gear. This would make their coming winter months much more difficult. At Fort Donelson, the regiment manned the heavy artillery until they burst or were dismounted, and then led a sortie in the snow and sleet against the Federal trenches which were in the process of being constructed in their front. They took the first line of works, suffering great loss, at least one-fourth of the command. Captain Frank Jordan was among the killed, and Adjutant Ben W. Johnson among the wounded. Fort Donelson fell on February 16, 1862. Men and officers were made prisoners by the \\"unconditional surrender\\". The men were sent to Camp Butler, the officers to Fort Warren. Lieut.-Col. John C. Wright made his escape, returned to Arkansas, was elected Colonel of cavalry in the service under General Thomas C. Hindman, who was organizing the Trans-Mississippi Department, and commanded Crawford's Brigade at the Battle of Marks' Mills. Gee's regiment had 7 killed and 17 wounded out of a total of 270 men during the siege of Fort Donelson. In late September, 1862, the survivors were released and sent to Vicksburg to be exchanged. The death rate in the regiment during its imprisonment was considerable. The reports of the company commanders show: *Company A: 62 surrendered, 58 carried off, 5 escaped, 27 died, 27 returned. *Company B: 67 surrendered, 29 died in prison, 9 in hospitals, 34 returned. *Company E: surrendered at Donelson. Majority died in prison. *Company F: 50 surrendered, 22 died in prison, 26 returned.  Reorganization  The soldiers of the regiment were declared exchanged in September 1862, and the regiment was reorganized at Jackson, Mississippi, on October 16, 1862 and assigned to Beall's Brigade, Department of Mississippi and East Louisiana. At the reorganization in 1862, four Arkansas companies which had originally been assigned to the 40th Tennessee Infantry Regiment were added to the unit to give the legally required ten companies for a regiment. The companies were reorganized as follows: Colonel Benjamin W. Johnson *Company A – originally organized as Company I, 40th Tennessee Infantry Regiment, commanded by John H. D. Stevenson. *Company B – originally organized as Company D, 40th Tennessee Infantry Regiment, commanded by Joseph A. Daniel. *Company C – originally organized as Company A, 15th (Gee's) Arkansas Infantry Regiment, commanded by James H.

Port Hudson  The reorganized regiment was sent south to Louisiana to resist Major General Banks, and fought in many minor engagements, including Cross Landing, Greenfield, Plum's Store, and with the First Alabama and Thirteenth Mississippi, engaged at Keller's Lane a largely superior force, which they routed, taking many prisoners and valuable stores. The regiment was called into the fortifications of Port Hudson, when attacked by the army and navy of the United States. The unit fought at Plains Store, the first engagement of the siege. Captain Reed, of Company G, was killed on May 29, 1863; Captain Hubbard, of Company D, was also killed. Within a day or two, Captain Stevenson died from wounds received. Capt. E. Wilson died from concussion of the brain, caused by being struck with a shell.

Fort Desperate  Fort Desperate was the name given to the Confederate position sitting at the top of an exposed ridge on the northeastern corner of the Port Hudson defensive line. It was primarily defended by the men of Johnson's 15th Arkansas Infantry Regiment. On May 21, just before the garrison was placed under siege and a Union attack appeared imminent, the Confederate forces were reorganized and Colonel Johnson's unit was assigned to Colonel I. G. W. Steedman, who was given command of the entire left wing of the defenses.\\"Fort Desperate\\" Hardys in the Civil War, Accessed 27 November 2011, http://pth.thehardyparty.com/ft_desperate/fort_desperate.htm Colonel Johnson was ordered to move his men from their position at the center of the lines to a new position farther to the left, just six days before a massive Union attack took place. When he was given this order, no defensive fortifications existed at the location, and a frantic effort began to construct earthworks in anticipation of a coming assault. The men built a formidable parapet surrounding their camp on three sides, with an exterior trench running alongside it, to create a fortification known as a lunette. The ground dropped off steeply all around the wall, giving the fort a natural advantage. The timber was cut outside the wall, and the tangle of tree branches and brush covering the ground made the uphill approach very slow, difficult, and dangerous. Throughout the siege, work continued on the fortifications, mostly at night. Improvements were made, and damage caused by the continuous Union artillery bombardment was repaired. In the defense of Fort Desperate, the 15th Arkansas was joined by two gun detachments of Company B, First Mississippi Artillery Regiment, with their two twelve-pounder guns and about twenty-five men. These two guns were Johnson's only artillery. At the beginning of the battle, Johnson had a total of 262 enlisted men and 31 officers. At certain times small detachments of several other units were also under Johnson's command, and were used as a reserve, seeing little action. The men of the 15th Arkansas were at the front without relief throughout the siege. This vital section of the Confederate line was never breached by Union forces, despite constant bombardment and repeated attacks by vastly larger forces.\\"Colonel Benjamin W.

In 1904, the Central South African Railways placed eight Class F tank steam locomotives with a Baltic type wheel arrangement in service. In 1912, when these locomotives were assimilated into the South African Railways, they were renumbered but retained their Class F classification.Espitalier, T.J.; Day, W.A.J. (1945). The Locomotive in South Africa - A Brief History of Railway Development. Chapter VI - Imperial Military Railways and C.S.A.R. (Continued).

Engines with Renumbering Lists, issued by the Chief Mechanical Engineer's Office, Pretoria, January 1912, pp. 7, 11, 13, 19-20 (Reprinted in April 1987 by SATS Museum, R.3125-6/9/11-1000) Manufacturer The first two locomotive types to be designed for the Central South African Railways (CSAR) by P.A. Hyde, who had been appointed as Chief Locomotive Superintendent of the CSAR upon its inception on 1 July 1902, were placed in service in 1904. These were the Class 9 Pacific type passenger locomotive and the Class F Baltic type tank steam locomotive. Orders for these two classes were placed simultaneously with Vulcan Foundry of Newton-le-Willows in England. The eight Class F locomotives were delivered in 1904, numbered in the range from 260 to 267. Characteristics Since the Class F and the Class 9 were designed and built simultaneously, there were many similarities between them. Apart from the tank locomotive's slightly smaller coupled wheels of diameter compared to on the Class 9, many parts were made interchangeable, including their boilers, cylinders and valve motion. They had bar frames, Stephenson valve gear and used saturated steam. The locomotive had electric headlights, powered by a steam turbine and generator which were fitted between the chimney and the headlight on top of the smokebox. In common with the CSAR's Classes 8 and 9, the Class F suffered from fractures in the bar frames, particularly between the cylinders and the leading coupled wheels. The problem was overcome by fitting thick flitch plates on each side of the frame at this point. Renumbering When the Union of South Africa was established on 31 May 1910, the three Colonial government railways (Cape Government Railways, Natal Government Railways and CSAR) were united under a single administration to control and administer the railways, ports and harbours of the Union. Although the South African Railways and Harbours came into existence in 1910, the actual classification and renumbering of all the rolling stock of the three constituent railways were only implemented with effect from 1 January 1912.The South African Railways - Historical Survey. Editor George Hart, Publisher Bill Hart, Sponsored by Dorbyl Ltd., Published c. 1978, p. 25. In 1912, these locomotives retained their Class F designation, but were renumbered in the range from 78 to 85. Service At the time when the Class F locomotives were ordered, the suburban services on the Reef were being worked by Class B tank locomotives which had been inherited from the Nederlandsche-Zuid-Afrikaansche Spoorweg-Maatschappij (NZASM) via the Imperial Military Railways (IMR). Since the loads were fast becoming too heavy for them, the Class F was designed and ordered as a replacement, intended for the suburban passenger services between Springs and Randfontein. Hyde considered the Class F and the Class 9 as two of his most successful designs for the CSAR. The tank locomotives were very attractive in appearance, with double red lining on their black livery. The IMR tradition of polished copper-capped chimneys, brass domes and boiler bands was continued on the CSAR. The locomotives were always maintained in immaculate condition while in service and became affectionately known as the Chocolate Boxes. The last of the Class F was withdrawn from service by 1931.

The species is solely known from the Early Eocene sediments exposed in Katmai National Park and Preserve, Kodiak Island Borough, Alaska. It is the type species for the extinct section Douglasa. Type locality The species was described from a group of leaf specimens found in the West Foreland Formation which is part of the Kenai Group. Sediments of the formation span are typically volcanoclastic sedimentary rocks dating from the Late Paleocene to early Eocene with A. douglasense only found in the Eocene age section. History and classification Acer douglasense was described from several specimens, the holotype, number \\"USNM 396006\\", and a group of paratypes. The holotype and paratypes are preserved in the paleobotanical collections housed at the National Museum of Natural History, part of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.. The specimens were studied by paleobotanists Jack A. Wolfe of the United States Geological Survey, Denver office and Toshimasa Tanai of Hokkaido University. Wolfe and Tanai published their 1987 type description for A. douglasense in the Journal of the Faculty of Science, Hokkaido University. The etymology of the chosen specific name douglasense in recognition of the type locality on Cape Douglas. A. douglasense is the second oldest occurrence of the maple genus, with the oldest being A. alaskense from the Latest Paleocene Chickaloon Formation. In their type description Wolfe and Tanai designated A. douglasense as the type and only species for the extinct Acer section Douglasa. Description Leaves of Acer douglasense are simple in structure and a generally oval shape. The deeply five lobed structure and tertiary vein structure is very similar to the modern species A. spicatum. However the secondary veins are a combination of alternating craspedodromous veins and forking veins. The related living Sapindaceae genera Cardiospermum and Serjania plus the extinct genus Bohlenia also have a similar alternating pattern of secondary veins.

It is a logarithmic graph starting not directly from ingestion, but from 4 hours post ingestion after absorption is considered likely to be complete. In hands of skilled clinicians this nomogram allows for timely management of acetaminophen overdose. Generally, a serum plasma concentration (APAP) of 140–150 microgram/mL (or milligrams/L) at 4 hours post ingestion, indicates the need for NAC treatment. This nomogram is not used alone if the patient has altered mental status or if the history is not reliable. Rather, a second level should be drawn and plotted to see if the slope of the line remains at or above the nomogram. A formal half life may also be determined. Measure at time upon admission of the patient to the emergency department, and a blood value at time (t=4 hrs) should be obtained and half-life calculated. If half-life is more than 4 hours, then treatment is necessary to prevent hepatotoxicity and liver failure. The original line starting at 200 microgram/mL at 4 hours was published in 1975 by Rumack BH. and Matthew H. When the NAC study was begun in 1976, the FDA required a line that was 25% below the original line now called the treatment line. The study line which is now referred to as the treatment line was created starting at 150 at 4 hours and is the usual line used in the United States to determine treatment of acetaminophen overdose. This was published in 1981. With early NAC and supportive therapy 66% of patients will recover, but the remainder will progress to fulminant hepatic failure, and require liver transplantation. Of those patients who undergo emergency liver transplantation, 70% survive at least one year.

About the board The Virginia state constitution gives the state legislature, the Virginia General Assembly, the primary governing role over public education in the state.Russo and Mawdsley, p. 1-2. Thus, the state board of education is merely an administrative agency which carries out the laws, policies, and programs established by the legislature. The board is composed of nine members, who are appointed by the Governor of Virginia and must be confirmed by the General Assembly.\\"Duties.\\" Virginia Board of Education. Virginia Department of Education. 2011. Accessed 2011-07-25. Members serve for four years, and may serve only two consecutive terms. The board's duties include: * Establishing a statewide curriculum; * Establishing high school graduation requirements; * Establishing educational and certification requirements for teachers, principals, and other education personnel; * Establishing state educational assessment programs, including those for the federally required No Child Left Behind Act; * Accrediting local schools and school districts; * Accrediting teacher and school administration education programs; * Implementing federal education assistance programs, and ensuring that schools make reporting requirements under these programs; and * Acting as a rulemaking body to implement state educational programs. Founding The Virginia State Board of Education was founded in 1810 when the state of Virginia established a \\"literary fund\\" (designed to fund public education throughout the state) and the board of education (at the time, called the Board of Trustees of the Literary Fund) placed in charged of it.Monroe, p. 728-729. The state constitution of 1869 significantly revamped not only the state's system of elementary and secondary education, but also established a state Superintendent of Education and a new State Board of Education to replace the old \\"trustees.\\"Monroe, p. 729. In 1901, yet another new Virginia constitution expanded the board's members from three to eight, and greatly expanded its powers.Monroe, p. 730. In 1910, local agricultural schools were placed under the board's control. References Bibliography *Monroe, Paul. A Cyclopedia of Education.

Its symptoms are often indistinguishable from those caused by Pectobacterium but is more virulent, causing disease from lower levels of inoculum and spreading through the plant more effectively. It was first discovered in the Netherlands in 2005, before spreading rapidly, causing €25–30 million of damage annually by 2010. Three cases appeared in Scotland in 2009 and one in 2010. Host and symptoms The host for Dickeya solani is the potato plant (Solanum tuberosum). Dickeya spp. can be the causal agents of soft rots and black leg. The symptoms that this bacteria causes can at times not be easily distinguished from the symptoms caused by Pectobacterium spp, since both pathogens induce a rotting of the plant tissue and black leg symptoms on the host. Black leg symptoms consist of wet, black rot on the stem that spread up from the original seed tuber. Symptoms of a Dickeya solani infection can include wilts and soft rots. The wilts occur when the bacterial pathogen invades the vascular system of the plant. The wilt symptoms can progress rather rapidly. Soft rots can be identified as soft, watery plant tissue with small, wet stem lesions. Pathogenesis Dickeya solani can cause disease more effectively in temperate climates in comparison to other Dickeya spp. Furthermore, Dickeya solani is more aggressive in causing black leg than other species. Dickeya solani can induce disease at lower inoculum levels. One reason for this is that Dickeya solani produces more cell wall degrading enzymes when compared to other Dickeya spp. Dickeya spp. have virulence factors such as extracellular enzymes, type III secretion systems, and phospholipases (Zhou, et al., 2015). Dickeya spp. have cell wall degrading enzymes such as cellulases and proteases that digest the plant cell wall and allow the pathogen to infect the plant. The usage of cell wall degrading enzymes is sometimes categorized as a “brute force” method. However, there are less blunt ways that Dickeya spp. can attack the host, the type III secretion system can code for hypersensitive response and pathogenicity (hrp) genes. In some Dickeya species the hrp genes are involved early on in pathogenesis. Dickeya solani can code for zeamine, which is a phytotoxin. The genes for coding zeamine are not well-conserved among the Dickeya spp. However these synthesis genes are similar in Dickeya zeae and Dickeya solani. During the evolution of Dickeya pathogens these genes were most likely acquired through horizontal gene transfer late in the evolutionary process. Disease cycle In the spring, primary inoculum can be found in the seed tubers. There are three major steps in the infection process. The pathogen must first be able to adhere to the plant's surface and penetrate it either via a wound or a natural opening such as the stomata. Following penetration, the bacteria invades and then degrades the cell wall. In late spring to the summer the bacteria can spread from the original seed tuber to the developing roots and stems. Dickeya solani can invade quickly and the bacterial cells relay on a cell to cell communication method called Quorum sensing. In Quorum sensing the cells communicate with each other via small signaling molecules. The bacterial cells can reproduce in the intercellular spaces and can generate enzymes that degrade or destroy the plant cell wall. Once the cell wall is degraded a liquification of the stem and the original seed tuber occurs. New tubers growing alongside the diseased tuber may become contaminated in the late summer into the early fall. During harvest, mechanical injuries can occur on the tuber which can provide more entry spots for Dickeya solani. The disease can then spread more when the potato tubers are put into storage. Rotten tubers that were discarded can allow for disease dispersal. Furthermore, Dickeya solani can overwinter in soil on plant residues.

The musical version of The Sunset Gang received an off-Broadway production with music scored by composer L. Russell Brown. In 1981, Adler wrote a sequel to The War of the Roses, The Children of the Roses. It focuses on the effect the Roses' divorce had on their children. Adler was early involved in electronic publishing. In the early 2000s, he predicted the decline of printed books and he envisioned digital publishing becoming the norm. He acquired his complete back-list, published now under his own company, Stonehouse Press. He wrote an article for The Author’s Guild stating that authors had best prepare for a major change in the way traditional publishing businesses operated. He argued that they no longer had a monopoly on marketing, distribution, publicity, and content, and stated prolific authors like himself should take charge of their own destiny.\\"Your money.\\" New York Times August 21, 2005.

While in graduate school, Kadane worked for the Center for Naval Analyses (CNA). Upon finishing, he accepted a joint appointment at the Yale statistics department and the Cowles Foundation. In 1968, he left Yale and served as an analyst at CNA for three years. In 1971, he moved to Pittsburgh to join Morris H. DeGroot at Carnegie Mellon University. He became the second tenured professor in the Department of Statistics. Kadane served as department head from 1972-1981 and steered the department to a balance between theoretical and applied work, advocating that statisticians should engage in joint research in substantive areas rather than acting as consultants.Chan, Ngai Hang (2001). Econometric Theory, vol. 17, pp. 633-668. Kadane's contributions span a wide range of fields: econometrics, law, medicine, political science, sociology, computer science (see maximum subarray problem), archaeology, and environmental science, among others.Department of Statistics - Carnegie Mellon University He has been elected as a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, a fellow of the American Statistical Association, and a fellow of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics. Kadane authored over 250 peer-reviewed publications and has served the statistical community in many capacities, including as editor of the Journal of the American Statistical Association from 1983-85.

Design and development In March 1927, the Rikugun Koku HombuRikugun Koku Hombu was the Technical Branch of the Imperial Army Air Headquarters ordered Kawasaki, Nakajima and Mitsubishi to investigate design of a single-seat fighter on a competitive basis to replace the aging Ko-4 (Nieuport-Delage NiD 29).

Three prototype aircraft from each firm were to be delivered to the Tokorozawa Army test center for testing. Vogt was hired by Kawasaki to assist that firm in designing new aircraft. He and his assistant engineer and primary student, Kawasaki's Takeo Doi, used the high-wing German Dornier Do H as the starting point for the KDA-3 design. The KDA-3 was to have higher performance than the Dornier. The first prototype KDA-3 was to be delivered April 1, 1928, but the landing gear collapsed before delivery could be made.

The Rikugun Koku Hombu suspended evaluation of the contending types, canceled the program and began testing the other prototypes to destruction. Unfortunately for Mitsubishi and Kawasaki, Nakajima persevered with the design and built six more prototypes, the last being tested extensively by the Japanese army and was finally accepted for production as the Nakajima Army Type 91 Fighter. The Imperial Japanese Army began turning to nationalism the same year, and before long, a decision was made at the highest level to no longer purchase aircraft that were not designed and built in Japan, and to no longer hire foreign engineers or designers. The experience in designing and building the KDA-3 was not lost, but in fact was of great benefit to the designers, as they used the knowledge gained developing the KDA-3 in the design and construction of the Kawasaki KDA-5, an equal span biplane, which was accepted by the Japanese Army as the Kawasaki Army Type 92 Model 1 Fighter.

An understanding of the theory and engineering of this formation is an important part of the development of such machines and their cutting tools. The formal study of chip formation was encouraged around World War II and shortly afterwards, with increases in the use of faster and more powerful cutting machines, particularly for metal cutting with the new high speed steel cutters. Pioneering work in this field was carried out by Kivima (1952) and Franz (1958). Chip formation is usually described according to a three-way model developed by Franz. This model is best known within the field of machine tool design, although it is also used when an application area, such as woodworking, requires a vocabulary to describe chip formation in more detail than is usually attempted.  Chip classification  The first three chip types are the original characterisation, by Dr. Norman Franz. The type of chip that forms depends on many factors, of both tool and material. In general, main factors are the angle formed by the edge faces of the tool and also the angle at which this is presented to the surface. Sharpness of the cutting tool does not usually define the type of chip, but rather the quality of the chip, and the clear distinctions between types. A blunt tool produces a degenerate chip that is large, torn and varies from one means of formation to another, often leaving behind a poor quality surface where this means changes.   Type I chip Type I chips form when a material splits ahead of the cutting edge, owing to some upwards wedge action of the tool exceeding the tensile strength of the material, perpendicular to the surface. They are thus particularly important in fibrous materials, such as wood, where individual fibres are strong but they may be levered apart relatively easily. Type I chips generally form in cutting by tools with shallow cutting angles. Type I chips may form long, continuous swarf, limited in size only by the length of cut. This is the idealised chip formation for wood shavings, particularly those produced by a well-tuned plane with a finely adjusted mouth.   Type II chip Type II chips form when a shearing force is produced by the wedge of the tool angle. The material fails along a short angled plane, from the apex of the tool edge, diagonally upwards and forwards to the surface. The material deforms along this line, forming an upward curling chip. These chips generally form from intermediate cutting angles. Type II chips may form in ductile materials, such as metals. Type II chips may also form long, continuous swarf.   climb milling Type III chips form a compression failure of the material, ahead of a relatively obtuse cutting angle, approaching 90°. In some weak or non-ductile materials this may form an acceptable chip, usually as a fine dust, but often it gives rise instead to a random \\"snowplough\\" effect where the waste material is bunched up ahead of the tool but not cleared decisively away as a well-formed chip. This type of chip is formed by routers. It is also formed by woodworking scrapers, although when properly sharpened and used, these form such a thin Type III chip that it instead appears as a well-formed Type II chip. Their waste chip is thin enough that the compression failure volume is small enough to act as for the well- defined shear plane of the Type II.   This type was characterised later, by William McKenzie (1960).

It is based on the autobiographical novel We of the Never Never by Jeannie Gunn. It was nominated for five AFI awards and earned one award for best cinematography. Plot The film focuses on the life of Jeannie, a woman from the upper classes of society, and her story of adapting to life in the outback of Australia. Following her marriage to Aeneas Gunn who has just bought a 1 million acre cattle station near Mataranka, called Elsey Station, Jeannie follows him from Melbourne in 1902. Some of the drovers were unhappy at first because they believed that the bush is no place for a white woman. As such, they were both wary of her and made fun of her when both she and her husband arrived. However, Jeannie was determined to prove them wrong. While her husband was away with the other men herding the cattle, Jeannie begins making friends with the Aboriginal people. Her husband and the other white men treated the local people (and Chinese workers) as inferior to them, often regarding them as lazy, indifferent, as well as unreliable. However, Jeannie is sympathetic, often giving them food, or trying to stop domestic disputes. Later, Aeneas goes on a cattle muster and asks Jeannie to come along, which she does gladly. However the trip is difficult for her, riding side-saddle, she is also nearly attacked by a rogue bull. However, as time passes, things improve at the station - the house is expanded, a new Chinese cook arrives, a garden is planted, as well as her belongings finally arrive from Melbourne. But boredom sets in as she assumes her place - that of the station master's wife. She is asked not to help a feverish yet dying man, or to interfere with the balance of things, or to give the Aboriginal people goods meant for the working men. As a result, she spends more time with the locals, since she longs to learn and understand more about their ways. Jeannie even takes a semi-orphaned mixed-heritage child called Bett-Bett under her wing, much to the dismay of her husband. Over time Jeannie gains the respect of the Aboriginal people and they slowly open up to her. At one point, Goggle Eye, an elder Aboriginal male, allows her to watch an Aboriginal dance. The stockmen, however, interrupt the \\"heathen\\" dance, shooting and shouting \\"God save King Edward\\". Later, Bett-Bett goes on walkabout and Google Eye becomes ill and feverish. Believing that he has been affected by a singing curse Eye passes away. The stockmen feel some mixed remorse, acknowledging their role in his death. Soon it is Christmas and the Aboriginal people are treated a little better after what happened. In the spirit of Christmas, many of the provisions are given away and a large traditional Christmas meal is prepared for the westerners. It is here that Aeneas announces his intention, after their first year, to stay on at the station. Just when Jeannie thinks she is accustomed to life in the harsh outback, Aeneas also becomes feverish and dies, leaving her alone at the station. However, Bett-Bett returns from walkabout and asks to stay with her in the house.

Murray, who was then head of production for the Adams-Packer company. The film was shot on location in the Northern Territory at Elsey Station and Mataranka - the same setting as the novel. It was produced with the assistance of the Northern Territory Government, the Film Corporation of Western Australia, and the Victorian Film Corporation. Filming took 13 weeks from April to June in 1981. Four weeks into the shoot the production was behind schedule.Interview with Scott Murray, 6 November 1998 accessed 14 October 2012 John B Murray was replaced as producer by Greg Tepper, who had been the production manager for Fred Schepisi. The original budget was $2.5 million but the film ended up going $700,000 over due to high transportation costs. Igor Auzins later argued that pre-production on the film was not as tightly organised as it should have been.David Stratton, The Avocado Plantation: Boom and Bust in the Australian Film Industry, Pan MacMillan, 1990 p178-179 Angela Punch McGregor later complained that only half of the script was shot: > A lot of good action scenes were cut because of the restrictions on time and > budget, much to my disappointment and anger then. We ended up with a very > slow-moving narrative and a more intellectual film than I had anticipated... > What we have still to learn in this country is that you cannot fix up a film > in the editing room.Jim Schembri, \\"Angela Punch McGregor\\", Cinema Papers, > December 1984 p 420 Release A year after filming finished, the movie was screened at Cannes. The film soundtrack by Peter Best was initially released on LP. Years later it was released again on compact disc along with \\"Devil in the Flesh\\". It features a simple but beautiful melody: part of a haunting score which is one of the best in Australia film history. The soundtrack recording was produced by Peter Best and released by Festival Records and 1M1 Records. We of the Never Never grossed $3,112,000 at the box office in Australia,Film Victoria - Australian Films at the Australian Box Office which is equivalent to $9,055,920 in 2009 dollars. The movie was also popular in England. Critical reception The New York Times commented: :If We of the Never Never sounds simple, old-fashioned and as suffocatingly noble as its heroine, it is. It's a film of far more anthropological than dramatic interest since much of the action involves aboriginal characters, and since it was filmed in the thinly settled region Mrs. Gunn actually visited. There is an adventure here... that children will enjoy, and the scenery is unusual. But otherwise, little of interest goes on. And the film, in depicting Jeannie's relations with the aborigines, celebrates her open-mindedness with a pride that's dated and unseemly.From Australia, 'We of the Never Never', The New York Times, 11 February 1983 Time Out London comments:We of the Never Never, directed by Igor Auzins, Time Out London :Down under, We of the Never Never is a well-loved turn-of-the-century classic by a Mrs.Aeneas Gunn, who as a genteel Melbourne bride was expected to add a woman's touch to her husband's isolated cattle station. Phlegmatic British audiences, not much in touch with the pioneer spirit, will find in this adaptation an unashamedly old-fashioned celebration of corseted pluck as Jeannie Gunn rolls up her lacey sleeves and wins the grudging respect of the hitherto misogynistic stockmen. It's a pleasurably predictable formula, kept afloat by plangent orchestration, glorious cinematography, and a continuous supply of death-beds and simple outback funerals. The film's real difficulty lies in Jeannie's treatment of the Aborigines. She's nice to them but patronising... Is Auzins inviting us to make up our own minds about her naive colonialism, or just dodging what could have been the film's central issue?

He signed with the Philadelphia Phillies after graduating from Princeton University and appeared in four Major League Baseball (MLB) games — one as a pinch runner in and three as a pinch hitter in — all for the Phillies. Easton went hitless in three at bats and failed to score a run as a baserunner. He threw and batted right-handed, standing tall and weighing , during his playing days. Easton graduated from Trenton Central High School and was a member of Princeton's Class of 1955. He also played varsity basketball for the Tigers and captained their baseball team. Easton made his MLB debut only days after signing his first pro contract, pinch running for veteran catcher Andy Seminick in the second inning of the first game of a doubleheader, against the Chicago Cubs, at Wrigley Field. Easton was not able to advance from second base when the Phils' rally was snuffed out by an inning-ending double play. However, Marv Blaylock, who had replaced Easton in the lineup, would score the only run of the game, thirteen innings later, as the Phillies won, 1–0. Easton did not play in 1956 and much of 1957, serving in the United States Navy, but had an all-star year in for the Class A Williamsport Grays of the Eastern League, winning the batting title (.321), with 152 hits, including 35 doubles, ten triples, and 13 home runs. That earned him a second stint with the Phillies, to start the 1959 campaign, but in three pinch hitting appearances, Easton struck out all three times. He was sent back to the minor leagues, and retired after the 1959 season. Easton graduated with a degree in electrical engineering from Princeton and became a manager for Public Service Electric & Gas Company (P S E & G) (a public utility), retiring in 1995. A resident of Hopewell Township, Mercer County, New Jersey, he died at age 68 after battling melanoma on July 28, 2001.

Biography Neel was born in Wilmington, Delaware. He cut his first single, entitled \\"Talking About People\\", at the age of twelve, as Johnny Neel and The Shapes Of Soul, which was a hit on local radio in the Wilmington/Philadelphia area. As an adult, the Johnny Neel Band had a strong following up and down the east coast and released two well-received independent albums. Neel moved to Nashville in 1984. Performing with various bands in area clubs drew the attention of former Nashville resident Dickey Betts, who asked Neel to join his road band, and he soon began working on Bett’s solo LP for Epic Records. That relationship led to seven cuts on the Pattern Disruptive album released in 1988, including the AOR hit, \\"Rock Bottom\\". Neel's talented keyboard and harmonica playing on the Pattern Disruptive album convinced Gregg Allman to ask Neel to tour with his road band which led to the inclusion of the cut \\"Island\\" on The Gregg Allman Band album (also released in 1988), co-written with Allman, Dan Toler, and Tony Colton. In 1989 Neel was invited to join the reunited Allman Brothers Band. He immersed himself in touring, writing, and recording, which led to four cuts on the Allman's Seven Turns album (released in 1990), and the hit single \\"Good Clean Fun\\", co-written by Neel with Allman and Betts. In 2002 country stars Montgomery Gentry included \\"Good Clean Fun\\" as part of their My Town album. album. In 1994, the studio album Johnny Neel & The Last Word was released.

This album featured appearances by Jack Pearson (Allman Brothers) on guitar and Delbert McClinton on harmonica. In 1995, Neel's album Commin' Atcha... Live was released and included live versions of \\"Read Me My Rights\\" and \\"Maydell\\". The album captured a live appearance by Neel and his band The Last Word including Jack Pearson and most of the musicians on The Last Word album. In 2000, Neel released Late Night Breakfast which was recorded at his Straight Up Sound Studio with the members of his band The Last Word, along with special guests guitarists Shane Theriot (The Neville Brothers), and Rick Vito, as well as Wayne Jackson on trumpet. Late Night Breakfast was released on Neel's Breakin' Records label. During the period of time the Late Night Breakfast recordings were made, Neel also became a member of Blue Floyd, an all-star jam band performing variations on the material of Pink Floyd. In addition to Neel, the band was composed of guitarist Marc Ford, drummer Matt Abts, bassist Berry Oakley Jr. (OKB Band) and until his death, Allen Woody on second guitar. Neel and Abts then went into the Straight Up Sound Studio and recorded the X2 funk/jam duo project. X2 - Johnny Neel / Matt Abts was released in 2002. In 2004, Neel released the album Gun Metal Blue on his Breaking Records label which was also recorded at Straight Up Sound. These sessions included guitarists Chris Anderson, George Marinelli, and Pat Bergeson, drummer Vince Santoro, and vocalists Joanna Cotten, and Neel's wife, Christine Thompson Neel.

In 1977, she became one of the first women to be ordained a priest by the American Episcopal Church and was the first woman to hold the office of canon. Life and career Born in Evansville, Indiana, Simpson grew up in Texas City, Texas. She was raised a Methodist but in her senior year of college she became an Episcopalian. She subsequently entered the New York School for Deaconesses and Other Church Workers in New York City from which she graduated in 1949. After graduation she spent six years as a missionary to Liberia. Upon her return to the United States, she became a religious sister and took her life vows with the Order of Saint Helena in Vails Gate, New York in 1956. She was soon after appointed the head of a girls' school operated by the order, Margaret Hall in Versailles, Kentucky, where she remained for about a decade. She then returned to the convent in Vails Gate to become director of novices. \\\\-- Updated link in NY Times archive. In 1973 Simpson became actively involved in the women's movement in the Episcopal Church for the first time after a proposal to allow women priests in the church had been defeated. She had previously not been a vocal advocate for the role of women in the church, although she had privately supported the ordination of women. In 1974 she was appointed a deacon at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City and spent the next three years on the staff of that church working as a pastoral counselor. In 1977, Simpson became one of the first women to be ordained a priest in the American Episcopal Church, the first religious sister to be ordained, and the first female canon.Sue Heinemann, Timelines of American Women's History (Penguin, 1996), p. 216 She was the first ordained woman to preach at Westminster Abbey when she visited London in April 1978.Heinemann, Timelines of American Women's History, p. 216; Kirstin Olsen, Chronology of Women's History (Greenwood Press, 1994), p. 349. At that time, the Church of England had not approved the ordination of women. Simpson's visit brought together Anglican groups in favor of women's ordination and led to the founding of the Movement for the Ordination of Women.Jenny Daggers, \\"The Emergence of Feminist Theology in Britain\\", in Time, Utopia, Eschatology. Yearbook of the European Society of Women in Theological Research (Peeters, 1999), p. 139. Simpson died in Augusta, Georgia in 2011 at the age of 85.

Located on the east coast of Trinidad, the larger island, the beach sits directly on the Manzanilla Bay adjoined to the larger north Atlantic Ocean.https://www.google.de/maps/place/Manzanilla+Bay,+Trinidad+and+Tobago/@10.5006496,-61.0268641,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x8c4a194653db33df:0x3668b97b48d117d9 Etymology The word manzanilla is the diminutive form of the Spanish word for apple, manzana. The beach was so named by early Spanish settlers, who encountered what they thought were apple trees with small fruit. They were in fact the manchineel tree, bearing toxic fruit that closely resembles apples.http://www.amazing-trinidad-vacations.com/vacation-safety-tips.html The name of the area was still maintained even after the arrival of the British in 1797. History Largely uninhabited until 1822, Manzanilla beach saw new settlers when Governor Ralph Woodford brought soldiers of the West India Regiment in the area. The reason for this settlement was twofold: firstly, because the regiment was composed mainly of Black soldiers and wished to avoid the incidence of runaway slaves hiding among the Black soldiers and secondly, the Governor wished to promote the development of a roadway from Arima to the east coast. These soldiers were each given sixteen acres of land which they developed with their families by growing rice and ground provisions. These agricultural productions were so large that wastage was a common feature of their lands and also because of the infrequency that the round-island steamer collected their produce. These soldiers were underpaid and slighted by their employer, the government at the time. In fact, in an attempt to ameliorate conditions, the government used the soldier's own retirement pension to provide better facilities for the village. By 1839, the village consisted only of one medical officer, one police officer, a superintendent and a Mico Charity School for the village children. In 1841, three years after the abolition of slavery in 1838, the Governor at the time, Sir Henry MacLeod had sent Reverend J.H. Hamilton on a mission to report about the situation in Manzanilla. The Reverend, although more concerned about his proselytizing ambitions, did report that there were about five Mandingo priests and a horrible track between Arima and Manzanilla. The residents of the area later developed cocoa and coffee and by 1898, the problem of transport of goods was solved with the introduction of the railway to neighboring Sangre Grande. As a result of an agreement between Sir Winston Churchill and President Franklin Roosevelt, Manzanilla village served as a base of operations in the Caribbean for American soldiers in World War II in 1942. The area was established as a training camp for the army, where American soldiers trained in jungle warfare before being deployed in the region.http://www.trinidadexpress.com/news/Many_faces_of_Manzanilla-124954194.htmlhttp://nordeancanvas.blogspot.de/2013/07/manzanilla.htmlhttp://travelingted.com/2013/02/03/trinidad- is-the-best-kept-secret-of-the-caribbean/ Tourism As one of the most sparsely populated areas on the island, Manzanilla has become a choice tourism destination for visitors seeking a quieter and less commercial beach experience. There are a few resorts, such as the Coconut Cove, that cater to tourists visiting the region for leisure. Despite its appeal as an attraction, Manzanilla is infamous for its consistently rough waters and dangerous undercurrents during high tide.http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g147387-d312184-Reviews- Manzanilla_Beach-Trinidad_and_Tobago.html The beach is also known as a hatching site of the local leatherback sea turtle. Due to the abundance of these nests, Manzanilla beach has caught the attention of eco-tourists as a destination for turtle-watching.http://www.dcoconutcove.com/turtlewatching.php References Category:Beaches of Trinidad and Tobago ","title":"Manzanilla Beach, Trinidad and Tobago"},{"id":"32535131","text":"Phillip Ingram (born July 11, 1958) is an American musician.

It was anti-Serbian propaganda and part of a concerted propaganda push against Serbs, attempting to split them from the Croats. Synopsis Vera witnesses the persecution of ethnic Germans in Yugoslavia, which awakens her ethnic consciousness. Her cosmopolitan friend Alexander is arrested. Vera flirts with the Serbian commander to allow Volksdeutsche to escape to the border. When arrested, she proudly affirms that she helped her countrymen and, in an escape attempt, is shot, to die happy and heroic.

Its Zagreb premiere was held on 21 March 1942. Unusually, contemporary Viennese film magazine ' classified the film as \\"forbidden for the youth\\" (für Jugendliche nicht zugelassen). Motifs The film reprises many of the same motifs as Heimkehr, in an anti-Serbian rather than anti-Polish context. A sympathetic Croat aids the Germans, stating that all Croats should be friendly, and is murdered by Serbs for it, reflecting a widespread cliche of the friendly Croat.

He is the incumbent Undersecretary for Government Digital Broadcast Television and the Digitization of the Entertainment Industry Sector Department of Information and Communications Technology. He is also the founder and chairman of Philippine rock-and-roll radio station DZRJ and the Rajah Broadcasting Network. Education Jacinto attended the Ateneo de Manila University and graduated with honors in Economics. To further his studies, he took up law at the University of Sto. Tomas while working for his father's steel company, Iligan Integrated Steel Mills, Inc. Career Jacinto became an entrepreneur at the age of 15, founding the first multi-track recording company in Asia. At the age of 17, Jacinto and his friends established his radio station in his parent's backyard. The establishment of the radio station with the call letters dzRJ, would eventually become the legendary and at the same time, influential rock and roll station in the country. By the age of 19, Jacinto began working at his family's Iligan Integrated Steel Mills, Inc. (IISMI), the Philippines' largest steel mill, as VP Purchasing and later as SVP Operations. During the Martial law period under Ferdinand Marcos, the Jacinto family's assets were forcibly seized and placed under military control and executives of the company were jailed with no charges filed. The sequestered assets included Jacinto's two radio stations. At that time, Jacinto was in the United States and opted to stay there in exile for 14 years to save himself from being jailed. During his exile, Jacinto recorded songs together with other Filipinos and secretly sent them to the Philippines for airplay. The songs \\"Muli\\" and \\"Don't Let Go\\" became hits but the composers and singers were not named in order to avoid military sanctions. On March 5, 1986, Juan Ponce Enrile, who was then the Defense Minister, returned the radio stations and some of the Jacinto family's steel mills back to the Jacintos. DZRJ was finally transferred from military administration in June 1986 and Jacinto began to make DZRJ, the leader in retro wave by playing music from the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. Upon returning from exile from Martial Law, Jacinto established a string of businesses: *UHF Television *Home TV Shopping *Non- collateral Consumer Finance *American Style Bargain Stores like Price Club (now occupied by S&R; Shopping), Save-A-Lot & Cotsco He also owned Ventures Rural Bank, which he later sold and is now known as AMA Bank. Through his show RJ Sunday Jam, he is claimed to be the first to establish \\"teleradyo\\" - a simulcast of radio on TV which was the model for ABS-CBN's DZMM TeleRadyo, the #1 AM radio station in the country. Bistro RJ, RJ Bar and RJ Bistro On July 25, 1986, Jacinto set up Bistro RJ, a rock and roll music lounge and restaurant located at Arnaiz Avenue, Makati, Metro Manila which became popular for those who were into singing and dancing. At the time, live bands traveled abroad to make a living and the night circuit in Manila depended on piano bars and discos. Jacinto decided to hire live bands to provide financial opportunities as well as to revive the night life in the Philippines through live music. Bistro RJ was renamed RJ Bar in 1991. It relocated to the Mandarin Oriental Manila Hotel in 1997 and later to Gil Puyat Avenue and subsequently Jupiter Street, all in Makati, Metro Manila. In 2008, RJ Bar was renamed RJ Bistro and relocated to the Dusit Thani Hotel Manila in Makati, Metro Manila. RJ Guitars Jacinto developed an interest in music and he was particularly inclined to the guitar. RJ Guitars Store was launched in 1988 in Glorietta Mall (formerly Quad Mall), Makati City. While performing in his bistro, Jacinto felt exasperated about switching between a Fender Jazzmaster and a Gibson Les Paul. He decided to approach the legendary Filipino luthier Rudy Discipulo to make a guitar versatile enough to produce all the sounds he needed. Impressed by Discipulo's workmanship, Jacinto embarked on putting up a guitar manufacturing business. At present, there are 20 RJ Guitar Centers in the Philippines, providing RJ Guitar models, and other musical instruments as well as distributing Taylor Guitars and other brands from abroad. In 2017, he established RJ Bacchus Japanese Guitar Factory, in partnership with Japanese guitar manufacturer Deviser. The 1,150 square meter factory located in Dasmariñas, Cavite.

Five years after the facility opened, Pudwill was featured in the Skatelab \\"all-time accident report\\" and owner Todd Huber explained in 2009: \\"Torey had 117 accidents—more than anyone else on there and he was only thirteen.\\" It was during his teenage years that Pudwill originated the Grizzly Griptape brand. Professional skateboarding Pudwill was around 14 years of age when his part appeared in the 2005 Shorty's video How To Go Pro. Shorty's was Pudwill's first board sponsor and following the demise of the brand, he was a flow rider for Alien Workshop for \\"at least a year\\". Pudwill was then invited to join the Almost team by company co-owner Daewon Song—who had first made contact after the cessation of Shorty's—during the pair's time as DVS team riders (as of December 2014, Pudwill and Song remain DVS teammates). Pudwill explained in 2010: > After Alien [Workshop], I floated around, getting boards from Chocolate > [Skateboards] for a couple months and then Daewon [Song] hit me up. He hit > me up before that, around the time I left Shorty’s, but I had something > lined up with Alien, so I wanted to stay loyal—not hop around. It didn’t > work out the way I saw it in my head though. Pudwill accepted Song's offer and achieved professional status in August 2008 during his tenure at Almost. Following the announcement that Pudwill had decided to join the Plan B team, Schulte was announced as a new Almost rider and a short video part accompanied the announcement. An official announcement was released in March 2010, stating that Pudwill had joined the Plan B Skateboards team, alongside skateboarders such as Danny Way, Colin McKay, Ryan Sheckler, PJ Ladd and Paul Rodriguez.

The press release revealed that the two signature shoes that Pudwill has released with the company have been among the brand's most popular. As of the press release date, Pudwill's third shoe model was in the process of being designed. Pudwill explained in a May 2013 interview: > I’ve been with DVS for a long time and it’s definitely part of my roots in > skateboarding. DVS is a big part of me and we have a solid team and family > there. We’re all really close and as a team we’re all really hyped on each > other. I recently re-signed with them and we’re rebuilding with a solid crew > especially with guys like Daewon and Chico. We’re all working tough towards > new goals for the brand.

In 1523, he helped Martin Luther to create the First Lutheran hymnal, published in 1524 and called Achtliederbuch.  Early life  Ellwangen 1549 Paul Speratus was born in Rötlen (a village now part of present-day Ellwangen) in Swabia, on or about 13 December 1484, probably to a wealthy family. His original surname, Latinized to \\"Speratus,\\" may have been \\"Spreter,\\" \\"Hoffer,\\" or \\"Offer.\\" In later years would write his name as \\"von Rötlen\\" (of Rötlen) or \\"von Ellwangen, Priester der Diöcese Augsburg\\" (of Ellwangen, Priest of the Diocese of Augsburg). Early studies took him to Paris and Italy, as well as (probably) Freiburg and Vienna. In 1506, he was ordained a Roman Catholic priest. In 1517, he was the author of a poem praising the Johann Eck, a conservative Catholic soon to be an important Catholic critic of Luther's new doctrines. At about the same time, the Pope named Speratus a Papal count palatine. In 1520, after having spent some years as cathedral preacher in Salzburg, he became the cathedral preacher in Würzburg.  Disciple of Martin Luther  On 31 October 1517, Martin Luther wrote to his bishop, Albert of Mainz, protesting the sale of indulgences and enclosing a copy of his 95 Theses, which his friends had translated from Latin to German by January 1518. In the early part of his ministry, Luther saw himself as a reformer operating inside the Catholic Church, as did many early followers such as Speratus. By November, 1521, however, Speratus had married and was forced to flee his position, going first to Salzburg, and then to Moravia. He was excommunicated in 1522, after preaching in Vienna a sermon denouncing his monastic vows. In 1523, he was imprisoned and condemned to death by burning, being released only after the intervention of friends and on the condition that he leave Moravia. It was while imprisoned that Speratus wrote his most famous hymn, Es ist das Heil uns kommen her.  Achtliederbuch  Title page of the Achtliederbuch \\"Es ist das heyl vns kommen her,\\" 1524 After Speratus was released from prison, he and his wife went to join Luther in Wittenberg in 1523, where Speratus helped Luther to create the first Lutheran hymnal, the Achtliederbuch, published in 1524. This hymnal contained only eight songs: four by Luther, three by Speratus, and one by Justus Jonas. All its songs were published the same year in the Erfurt Enchiridion, a collection of 26 hymns.  Es ist das Heil uns kommen her  The words of this hymn were written during the time Speratus was imprisoned; the melody is taken from a 15th-century chorale. nur durch die Fürbitte angesehener Magnaten vor dem Feuertode, zu dem er verurtheilt war, gerettet... er in dieser Haft das evangelische Glaubenslied „Es ist das Heil uns kommen her“ gedichtet hat. According to Catherine Winkworth, \\"Luther himself is said to have given his last coin to a Prussian beggar from whom he heard it for the first time.\\" The 14 stanzas of Speratus's text expound Luther's teaching concerning salvation by faith rather than by doing good works. According to Scott Hendrix, \\"It not only emphasizes justification by faith alone but it also underlines the vitality of that faith manifested in service to others\\".  In Gott gelaub ich, daß er hat  Miles Coverdale published his English translation of this song as \\"In God I trust for so I must.\\"  Hilf Gott, wie ist der Menschen Not  This hymn is recommended in the Missal of Matthäus Ludecus (1589) for several different feasts of the liturgical year including Septuagesima.  Later career  On Luther's recommendation, Speratus became court chaplain of Albert, Duke of Prussia, a post he held from 1524–29. In 1530, he became the Protestant bishop of Pomesania, a post he held until his death in 1551. He was active there in defending the tenets of faith advanced by Luther, and in attacking such rival sects as the followers of Caspar Schwenckfeldt and Andreas Osiander. He died in Marienwerder on 12 August 1551.

The regiment did not yet have the required 10 companies when it was ordered east of the Mississippi River with the rest of General Earl Van Dorn's Army of the West. Due to its understrength size the unit was also known as the 17th Arkansas Infantry Battalion. The unit was eventually consolidated with remnants of McCraver's 14th Arkansas Infantry Battalion and the consolidated unit was re-designated as the 21st Arkansas Infantry Regiment. The 21st Arkansas fought in all of the engagements of the Vicksburg campaign, and ended up surrounded and besieged at Vicksburg and surrendered with the rest of Pemberton's command. After being paroled and exchanged back to Arkansas, the regiment was consolidated with the remnants of several other Arkansas regiments to become 1st Arkansas Consolidated Infantry Regiment (Trans-Mississippi). Another Arkansas Infantry Regiment, first commanded by Colonel Frank A. Rector and later commanded by Colonel John Griffith was also designated as the 17th Arkansas Infantry Regiment (Griffith's).

The other two oldest buildings in Pittsburgh are not homes. The Old Stone Inn was built in 1756 (not confirmed) and The Fort Pitt Block House was built in 1764. The Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation placed a Historic Landmark Plaque on the building in 1970. In 1977, it was named a City of Pittsburgh Designated Historic Structure. It is part of Schenley Park U.S. Historic District History The building was constructed around 1765 by the Neill (Neal) family, who owned 262 acres in what is now Schenley Park. John Neal came from Ireland around 1736 and set up a homestead in what is now Harrisburg Pa. He then went back to Ireland and brought his son William and his wife Margaret to the homestead in Harrisburg Pa. They then had seven more children - John, Robert, James, Margaret, Jean, Eleanor, and Agnes (Nancy). John and William purchased farm land in what is now Indiana County Pa. Robert bought the land in Pittsburgh and built the cabin and developed a Conestoga trade route from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia using his father's homestead in Harrisburg as one of the stopping points. The house passed through several hands before being sold to Col. James O'Hara, who left the property to his granddaughter Mary Schenley, who donated the land to the city in 1889. It currently sits preserved in Schenley Park with a fence around it (though it is open to the public periodically). The log house is also featured on the cover of A Guidebook To Historic Western Pennsylvania by Helene Smith and George Swetnam. May 8, 1915 Pittsburgh Bulletin- \\"A log house, once the fortified home of a rugged, full-bearded frontiersman, stands near Indian Springs in Schenley Park, and is now used as a rest house for Pittsburgh business men and stylishly dressed women who seek recreation during the summer months playing golf on the city links. This cabin was built in 1765 by Robert Neal, of thick hewn logs, the interstices being chinked with flat stones and clay as a protection against the attacks of Indians. It is one of the few pioneer cabins still standing in Western Pennsylvania in which the stone chimney is entirely within the walls and in which the loophole windows, originally about two feet long and less than a foot high, were not enlarged after danger from Indian attack had passed. This home stood close to Nemacolin’s trail, later known as the “old Road”, which lead from Philadelphia to Fort Pitt. Packhorse trains and heavy Conestoga wagons bearing supplies from the East passed it on their way to the log village of Pittsburgh. Several times it was besieged by Indians and bloody encounters have occurred about its log walls. Neal himself owned a Conestoga outfit and with Jack Andrews, a neighbor, made frequent trips to Philadelphia during which he was exposed to constant danger of attack by bands of Indians, for the capture of a heavily laden freight wagon yielded much booty. One midsummer evening a few years before the beginning of the Revolutionary War, Neal and Andrews had almost reached the cabin on a return trip from Philadelphia without adventure when suddenly just as they were starting down the hill at what is now Murray Avenue and Forbes street an Indian darted out of the bushes and hurled something at the team. The six horses plunged violently down the hill, frantic with fear and pain. The Indian had thrown a wasps’ nest which struck the back of one of the horses and broke, liberating the insects which stung the horses and the driver viciously. Neal with two “tenderfoot” passengers from Philadelphia who were on the back of the big covered wagon were not stung but they narrowly escaped being thrown to the ground by the unexpected plunge of the horses, the passengers losing their rifles. A half dozen Indians followed the runaway horses down the hill, firing as they ran, apparently for the purpose of adding to the fright of the panic- stricken animals. The Indians were disappointed in the evident expectations that the wagon would overturn or be wrecked among the trees and be easy to capture. Although smarting from numerous stings, Andrews kept the plunging horses on the road. By the time they had crossed the bottom of the narrow ravine and started up the steep ascent leading into what is now Schenley Park where the Neal home stands, most of the wasps had been left behind, and the mad speed of the horses slackened during the steep climb. Furious at the failure of their scheme to cause a wreck, the Indians fired directly at the men on the wagon and wounded both the passengers. Neal returned the fire of the Indians and one of them dropped as if dead. The Indians became more cautious but continued firing from behind trees until they killed one of the horses and brought the wagon to a standstill close to the Neal home. Neal assisted the two passengers, who were wounded but slightly, into the cabin while Andrews cut the traces of one of the horses and galloped towards Fort Pitt for aid. The wounded men were of no assistance in defending the cabin but the walls were thick and Neal with the aid of his two sons, both under 16 years of age, kept the Indians away from the wagon by firing carefully through the loophole windows. Elizabeth Neal, the wife and mother, reloaded the rifles and kept watch to see that none of the Indians approached from the opposite side of the cabin. After an hour’s siege the Indians withdrew, evidently fearing the arrival of soldiers from the fort. When Andrews returned with aid, no trace of the Indians could be found. Neal continued to live in the cabin until 1787 when he sold it to John Reed, another waggoner, for 360 pounds sterling, making a profit of 203 pounds for the property. After changing owners many times the log house came into possession of the Schenley estate and was included in the tract donated to the city for a park. The city restored the cabin to its original appearance except for the roof and gables, and now it is used as a rest house for golf players on the city links.\\" References Category:Houses completed in 1787 Category:Log buildings and structures in Pennsylvania Category:History of Pittsburgh Category:Houses in Pittsburgh Category:Schenley Park Category:1765 establishments in Pennsylvania ","title":"Neill Log House"},{"id":"32535373","text":"Kamarulzaman Hassan (born 17 January 1979) is a former Malaysian footballer.

Brady (August 23, 1942 – September 16, 2015) was a U.S. Virgin Islander judge, politician and attorney. Brady served as the Lieutenant Governor of the United States Virgin Islands from 1983 to 1987 during the second term of former Governor Juan Francisco Luis. Prior to his death, Brady served as a U.S. Virgin Islands Superior Court judge since 2006. Biography Early life Brady received bachelor's degrees in philosophy and English from Pontifical Catholic University of Puerto Rico in 1964. He worked at the V.I. Employment Security Agency as an interviewer before enrolling in law school. He then earned a law degree from New York Law School of New York City in 1969. Career Brady began his legal career at the Legal Aid Society of New York, where he worked from 1969 to 1971 as a public defender. He then served as an assistant U.S. attorney from 1971 to 1973. Brady was promoted to U.S. Attorney for the Virgin Islands District, a position he held from 1973 until January 30, 1978, when he resigned to pursue a political campaign for U.S.V.I. delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives. Brady's ultimately sought the Democratic nomination for Delegate of the U.S. Virgin Islands to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1978. He was narrowly defeated in the September 12, 1978 Democratic primary election by Janet B. Watlington, an aide to former Delegate Ron de Lugo. Republican Melvin Evans defeated Watlington in the November general election to become delegate. He was also reportedly considered for appointment as Lieutenant Governor by Governor Juan Luis in January 1978 following the death of Governor Cyril King. However, Governor Luis ultimately chose Henry Millin as his Lieutenant Governor and running mate in the 1978 gubernatorial election. Brady practiced law for a private law firm, Isherwood, Colianni, Alkon and Barnard, on Saint Croix after leaving the U.S. Attorney's office. He ran the firm's Saint Thomas office for a time. Governor Juan Francisco Luis appointed Brady the first federal programs coordinator in Washington, D.C. from 1979 to 1982. He simultaneously served as the chairman of the Democratic Party of the Virgin Islands from 1980 to 1982. Brady was also involved with the Fourth Constitutional Convention held in 1980. He heavily criticized a proposed provision in the U.S. Virgin Islands Constitution that would have required that all future Governors and Lt. Governors of the territory be born in the U.S. Virgin Islands or have at least one parent who was born in the U.S. Virgin Islands in order to hold office. As a guest speaker, Brady told the constitutional delegates, \\"For you people who were elected by a microcosm of the entire Virgin Islands to decide that for all time we cannot have in these Virgin Islands as governor somebody who was not born here, or whatever definition you use, is - to say the least - the height of arrogance.\\" In 1982, Lt. Governor Henry Millin opted to challenge incumbent Governor Juan Francisco Luis in the gubernatorial election. Luis chose Brady as his running mate for lieutenant governor in the 1982 gubernatorial election. Luis and Brady won the election on November 2, 1982, with 11,354 votes, defeating Millin and three other candidates for governor. He served as Lt. Governor until leaving office on January 5, 1987, when he was succeeded by Derek Hodge. In 1986, Brady ran for Governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands, this time as a Republican. However, he was defeated in the election by Democrat Alexander A. Farrelly. Brady was elected as a delegate to the 1988 Republican National Convention in New Orleans. Brady opposed a move to include a constitutional amendment to ban abortions in the Republican Party's 1988 party platform explaining, \\"It's a personal and moral issue, and I don't believe government has any business mucking around with it.\\" In the late 1980s, the Legislature of the Virgin Islands expelled then-Senator Kenneth Mapp from the legislature after he failed to re-register as a U.S. Virgin Islands resident after voting in a primary election in the state of Georgia. Brady represented Mapp in the court case challenging his expulsion. Brady went on to serve as a judge on the U.S. Virgin Islands Territorial Court from 1992 to 1994. The Territorial Court is now called the Virgin Islands Superior Court. By 2006, Brady, a former Democrat, had become Chairman of the Republican Party of the Virgin Islands. He was also working as a lawyer for Innovative Communications Corporation. In December 2005, Virgin Islands Superior Court Judge Edgar D. Ross retired from the bench. Governor Charles Wesley Turnbull nominated Brady to the Virgin Islands Superior Court on January 18, 2006. Brady's nomination was confirmed by the U.S. Virgin Islands Senate in an 8-3 vote in April 2006 after a series of heated and controversial confirmation hearings. He died in St. Croix after a long illness on September 16, 2015.http://stthomassource.com/content/news/local-news/2015/09/17/judge- julio-brady-dies-73 References External links *Virgin Islands Dept. of Education: Profiles of Outstanding Virgin Islanders - Julio A.

This is also the site of the Leprosy Museum (). Although it is no longer regularly used, it is one of the churches in the Bergen domprosti parish which is part of the Bergen domprosti (arch-deanery) in the Diocese of Bjørgvin. The green, wooden church was built in a cruciform style in 1706 using designs by an unknown architect. The church seats about 125 people.  Overview The complex is located on Kong Oscars gate, close to the central railway station, in the central part of the city of Bergen. The entire site, including the church, is now open to the public as a Leprosy museum which has been open to the public since 1970. The church remains consecrated and is kept in good order and condition. The church is no longer used as a regular parish church, but it is still used twice a month for English language worship services as well as occasional Swedish language services. History The church was originally the hospital chapel () in Bergen. A leprosy hospital in Bergen was documented in 1411, and was run at that time by the nuns of Nonneseter Abbey in Bergen. It seems likely that this facility was the immediate forerunner of the hospital and church. The church initially just served the patients at the hospital, but eventually it became its own parish serving the surrounding parts of Årstad. The parish was also the base for chaplains at the nearby city prison, poor house, and home for widows. The church burned down with the rest of the hospital in 1640. The church was rebuilt again after the Bergen citywide fire in 1702 when most of the city was burned to ashes. The church building was largely designed in late Baroque style. The present appearance of the church results from a major reconstruction of 1789–90.

The World War II film depicts the confusion of both sides in wartime Italy. The film portrays partisans and regular soldiers ineffectively coursing through the difficult mountainous terrain. The suggestive dialogue is seen with a minute portrayal of dark humor during combat where both sides are hesitant to win over the other side due to the chaotic nature of discord, disorganization and the conflicts of war in general. Plot A group of uniformed but undisciplined American soldiers are tasked with taking ammo to the front line. On the way their jeep breaks down and they commandeer a wheelbarrow from some passing refugees to put the ammo in, and set off cross- country on foot. The refugees get the vehicle started and make use of it themselves. The Americans take shelter in a farm overnight. A majority of them are of Italian descent, including one socially accepted soldier who accompanies them. An alleged Scottish resident sheltering with them is actually a German spy and radios their position to the German army officer who is constantly having trouble with cut communication cables. Meanwhile, the Italian troops, who are treated as inferiors by their German counterparts, are given rations. They are allotted only half rations, which causes a riot. The Germans also wish the Italians to take on the lesser task of confronting the partisans, rather than take on the Americans directly for their own gain. When the two Italian parties meet they are reluctant to fight, the partisans coerce some men to swap sides. When the Italian troops run into the pseudo-partisans, some of them become Communist sympathizers to avoid death. Their leader is shot and his two henchmen are recruited into the army. The Italian troops bravely resist in a confrontation with the Americans, but are later faced with a tank, killing a lead member of their group. When the Americans reach the front line they are pressed to help with the battle by engaging the Germans directly. The Germans have the disadvantage of not directly engaging with the partisans because communication lines are constantly cut. The Germans are ordered to retreat except for the commanding officer, one sergeant and a soldier who had earlier lost his leg in the course of combat. The volunteers stay behind knowing that they will certainly die. The main opposing officer and unnamed soldier take position in a machine gun nest for their last stand. They make a heroic effort, all dying in the process, while taking as many Americans with them as possible. Cast * Daniel Asher ... Lt. Watts * C. J. Barkus ... Private Pulver * Mathew Black ... Sgt.

He made contributions in the fields of abstract algebra, algebraic geometry, and computer vision, and participated in the Nicolas Bourbaki collective. He has also been president of the French Mathematical Society and directed two French science museums. Biography In the 1960s, Demazure was a student of Alexandre Grothendieck, and, together with Grothendieck, he ran and edited the Séminaire de Géométrie Algébrique du Bois Marie on group schemes at the Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques near Paris from 1962 to 1964. Demazure obtained his doctorate from the Université de Paris in 1965 under Grothendieck's supervision, with a dissertation entitled Schémas en groupes reductifs.. He was maître de conférence at Strasbourg University (1964–1966),. and then university professor at Paris-Sud in Orsay (1966–1976)Author biography from Bifurcations and Catastrophes. and the École Polytechnique in Palaiseau (1976–1999). From approximately 1965 to 1985, he was also one of the core members of the Bourbaki group, a group of French mathematicians writing under the collective pseudonym Nicolas Bourbaki.. On page 12 he is listed as one of four \\"key members\\", on page 105 it states that his active work with Bourbaki ceased around 1985, and on page 122 he is quoted as having \\"twenty years at Bourbaki\\". In 1988 Demazure was the president of the Société Mathématique de France.Anciens Présidents , Société Mathématique de France, retrieved 2011-07-26. From 1991 to 1998, he was the director of the Palais de la Découverte in Paris and, from 1998 to 2002, the chairman of the Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie in La Villette, two major science museums in France; in taking these positions, he changed places with Jean Audouze, who was at La Villette from 1993 to 1996, and became director of the Palais de la Découverte on Demazure's departure.. Demazure also chairs the regional advisory committee of research for Languedoc- Roussillon.Séance plénière du Conseil Régional , 29 November 2010, retrieved 2011-07-27. \\"Le Conseil Régional du 3 mai 2005 a approuvé la création du Comité Consultatif Régional de Recherche et de Développement Technologique, dénommé Comité ARAGO, auprès du Conseil Régional Languedoc-Roussillon. Le Comité ARAGO, présidé par Michel Demazure, ...\\" Research contributions In SGA3, Demazure introduced the definition of a root datum, a generalization of root systems for reductive groups that is central to the notion of Langlands duality.. On p. 468, Springer writes \\"The notion of root datum is due to Demazure.\\" A 1970 paper of Demazure on subgroups of the Cremona group. has been later recognized as the beginning of the study of toric varieties.. The Demazure character formula and Demazure modules and Demazure conjecture are named after Demazure, who wrote about them in 1974.. Demazure modules are submodules of a finite-dimensional representation of a semisimple Lie algebra, and the Demazure character formula is an extension of the Weyl character formula to these modules. Demazure's work in this area was marred by a dependence on a false lemma in an earlier paper (also by Demazure); the flaw was pointed out by Victor Kac, and subsequent research clarified the conditions under which the formula remains valid.. Later in his career, Demazure's research emphasis shifted from pure mathematics to more computational problems, involving the application of algebraic geometry to image reconstruction problems in computer vision.. The Kruppa–Demazure theorem, stemming from this work, shows that if a scene consisting of five points is viewed from two cameras with unknown positions but known focal lengths then, in general, there will be exactly ten different scenes that could have generated the same two images. Austrian mathematician Erwin Kruppa had many years earlier narrowed the number of possible scenes to eleven, and Demazure provided the first complete solution to the problem..

For over a century, the city of San Francisco, California allowed unrestricted public nudity. In 2012, the city changed the law to require a permit for such displays of public nudity. Legality The California Supreme Court, in In Re Smith (1972), held that sunbathing on an isolated beach was not lewd. There is a rarely enforced anti-nudity civil ordinance in the parks of San Francisco, including Golden Gate Park. This ordinance was put in place in 1970 in response to hippies dancing nude in a circle every Sunday in Speedway Meadow in Golden Gate Park.See issues of the Berkeley Barb from 1969 (complete set of issues of the Berkeley Barb is available at the Berkeley Public Library) to see pictures of hippies dancing in the nude in a circle in Speedway Meadow in Golden Gate Park. In 1969, Carol Doda began go-go dancing bottomless at the Condor Club on Broadway and Columbus in North Beach (she had been dancing topless at the Condor since 1964). Soon nude dancers began dancing at various clubs in North Beach. Three gay bars featured nude go-go dancing between 1969 and 1972. However, because of complaints, in the summer of 1972, California banned nudity in places that serve alcohol. In September 2011, nudists gathered to protest a proposed ordinance that would put some restrictions on public nudity in San Francisco. On November 20, 2012, by a 6-5 vote, the Board of Supervisors passed Ordinance 234-12 banning public nudity without a permit in San Francisco. The passage of the ordinance received some national press coverage. A suit to block the ordinance was rejected by a federal judge, and the nudity ban went into effect on February 1, 2013. As of 2013, public nudity without a parade permit is illegal in San Francisco according to SF Police Code § 154 (under Article 2: Disorderly Conduct). Subsection (e) of the ordinance, which criminalized public nudity and made it a possible misdemeanor, reads: :e. Upon the third or subsequent conviction under this Section 154 with in twelve months of the first violation, such person shall be guilty of an infraction or a misdemeanor. The complaint charging such violation shall specify whether, in the discretion of the District Attorney, the violation is an infraction or a misdemeanor. If charged as an infraction, upon conviction, the violator shall be punished by a fine not to exceed $500. If charged as a misdemeanor, upon conviction, the violator shall be punished by a fine not to exceed $500 or by imprisonment in the County Jail for a period not to exceed one year or by both such fine and imprisonment. Female toplessness was not affected by the ordinance and is allowed throughout the city. Beaches San Gregorio Beach, 20 miles south of San Francisco, was the first official nude beach in America in 1967. The San Francisco Bay Guardian published a clothing optional beach guide to California annually. Within San Francisco, there are three clothing-optional beaches: *The north end of Baker Beach is San Francisco's busiest, largest, and most accessible. *Golden Gate Bridge Beach, sometimes called Marshall's Beach or Nasty Boy Beach is accessible by a trail north of Baker Beach. *Lands End Beach is secluded at the end of a steep trail near the Cliff House and Sutro Baths ruins. Events There are many established clothing-optional events in San Francisco, including: *Halloween Nude or nude-themed costumes are ok anywhere in San Francisco. *The Pride Parade, San Francisco's biggest annual parade, is clothing optional. *Up Your Alley Fair, most commonly referred to by locals as Dore Alley Fair or simply Dore Alley, is a leather and fetish event held on the last Sunday of July on Folsom Street. Dore Alley is clothing-optional, having a clothes check area. *Folsom Street Fair is the largest annual BDSM and leather subculture street fair in the world. Capping off San Francisco's \\"Leather Pride Week\\", FSF is held on the last Sunday in September and has two coat and clothes check areas. Activists Some of the activists for social nudity in San Francisco were Lloyd Fishback, Rusty Mills, Rocky Angel, George Davis, \\"Nude Woody\\", Tortuga, Gypsy Taub, \\"Naked Marvin\\", Rich & Julie Pasco, Erik, SaraKay, \\"Bare\\", Mickey, Mikal, WNBR San Francisco organizers, Gerry West, C.J., Ross, and many others. In newspaper reports, these people are generally referred to as the \\"Castro nudists\\". Nudewoody walks Castro Street Nudists were active in some neighborhoods in San Francisco besides the Castro, including the Haight- Ashbury, Union Square, Fisherman's Wharf as well as the Mission. Some nudists who live in San Francisco go about their daily activities nude no matter where these activities take them. These nudists maintain that the push for body acceptance and body freedom is in no way sexual or prurient. Nudists believe that shame, fear, and the view that the human body is always sexual or obscene are ideas which are socially constructed and learned, just like any other prejudice or bigotry.Barcan, Rurh. Nudity: A Cultural Anatomy. Oxford, London: Berg. 2004., 179. Nudists assert that simple, healthy, social nudity harms no one. A 2009 Zogby poll showed the 60% of Californians stated that they were not personally offended by the non-sexual nudity of others. Nudity ban protests On Saturday, November 17, 2012, some of the Castro nudists gathered in front of San Francisco City Hall to protest the proposed ban on nudity. A protest held on February 1, 2013, on the steps of the San Francisco City Hall ended with four nude protesters being detained, taken to Northern Police Station, cited for public nudity, then released. The police did not take the four protesters (Gypsy Taub, Trey Allen, George Davis, Dany Devero) into the station building but instead kept them in the police van parked inside the police open air garage. The four protesters were released from the vehicle, cited, and then given blue blankets to cover their bodies as they were taken from the scene of City Hall without their belongings. Depiction in culture On September 21, 2012, a short play entitled The Buck Naked Church of Truth, produced by the Left Coast Theatre Company, premiered in San Francisco. The comedy, by James A. Martin, addresses the public nudity debate in the city by depicting a father who discovers his son naked in the Castro.

During that same year, Rickert co-created and launched Inside Pro Football, a radio show on WOFX (AM), Fox Sports 980. In September 2012, Rickert took Inside Pro Football to ESPN Radio's 104.5 The Team and the show moved to Saturday mornings at 9 AM.

Controversy Rickert became the center of controversy after an attorney-turned author published Saving Babe Ruth in June 2014.Amazon.com Saving Babe Ruth by Tom Swyers https://www.amazon.com/Saving- Babe-Ruth-Tom-Swyers/dp/1941440002 While a work of fiction, the novel is loosely based on a true story. The novel includes a character named Jerry Conway who is a high school principal and a professional sports agent.Tom Swyers Website, Saving Babe Ruth http://www.tomswyers.com/saving-babe-ruth/ While the character based on Rickert is minor component of the book, the author clearly attempted to use Rickert's name to create interest in the book. He also took several liberties in the creation of the character based on Rickert, including descriptions of interactions and meetings that were fabricated and sensationalized. Rickert has come under scrutiny for running a multimillion-dollar sports agency while working full-time as the principal of Niskayuna High School, a job where he earns a salary of $141,444 per year.Principal's truth is no stranger than fiction, Times Union, Chris Churchill, November 8, 2014, http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/Churchill-Principal-s-truth-is-no- stranger-than-5880704.php In the end, under Rickert's leadership, Niskayuna High School is rated as the best high school in the area and among the best in the country (Newsweek 2014). There is no state law or district regulation that precludes him from pursuing both careers. On May 26, 2015, the Niskayuna Central School District announced that there was no conflict of interest for Rickert to serve as a sports agent.

Priore was hired prior to the 2006 season and he led the transition of Stony Brook into a full-scholarship FCS program from the 2006 season in which the team awarded an equivalent 27 scholarships. In 2007, the team played as an independent while adding scholarships and a tougher schedule. In 2008, Stony Brook joined the Big South Conference as a full–scholarship program. Priore led the Seawolves to three consecutive Big South championships (in 2009, 2010, 2011) and so far has compiled a 37–31 record. Under the leadership of Priore the Seawolves played their first ever FBS opponent, South Florida, in the 2010 season. In 2011, Stony Brook won their first outright Big South Championship and participated for the first time in the FCS playoffs, advancing to the Second Round. Record Seasons 2006 Season 2007 Season 2008 Season Stony Brook entered their new season with a 42–26 over Colgate on August 30. 2009 Season The Seawolves opened their season against their Long Island rivals, Hofstra, at Hempstead which ended in 17–10 loss to the Prade. The Seawolves then visited Colgate, losing the game in a 23–13 decision. Opening their home season at Stony Brook the Seawolves played Brown University Bears. The Bears went ahead in the game early on but the Seawolves were able to come back and claim the game with a touchdown with 47 seconds left in the game resulting in a 21–20 win in the home–opener. The Seawolves then visited UMass resulting in a 44–17 loss at Amherst. Seawolves entered their Conference play winning three games straight, losing at Charleston Southern and then winning their season finale against Liberty in a very close game at LaValle Stadium, 36–33. 2010 Season In the off–season Hofstra University, Stony Brook's Long Island rivals, announced that it would cut its football team for future season after 2009 leaving the Seawolves as the sole college football team in the long island area. As NCAA rules state, when a college team is cut, football athletes that transfer to another school don't need to meet residency requirements to start play. This led to five incoming transfer from Hofstra to begin play at Stony Brook including Miguel Mayonet, and Brock Jackolski for the 2010 season. The 2010 season started with the first ever face off of the Seawolves against a FBS team. Seawolves lead against South Florida 14–0 early in the game but lost control and gave up a loss at South Florida, 59–14. Stony Brook quickly recovered to beat American International 31–14. The Seawolves later on posted wins at every single conference game against the Big South and by November 14 had an overall 6–4 record and were 5–0 in the Big South. In one of the biggest upsets of Seawolves football history, their automatic bid faded away as they fell to the Liberty Flames on November 20 in a 54–28 game creating a three–way tie for the FCS playoff and sending Coastal Carolina to the FCS Playoffs (Seawolves allowed 122 point against BSC, Liberty 110, and CC allowed 109 in the tie–breaker) thus making the Seawolves Co–Champions of the Big South but eliminated from playoff contention on the last day of the season.

In 1881, he was appointed to the Massachusetts Superior Court. His career there was successful enough to earn him a spot on the Massachusetts Supreme Court in 1887. Following the appointment of Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. to the United States Supreme Court in 1902, Knowlton took over as Chief Justice, and he held that position until he retired in 1911 due to failing eyesight.

Lee and other Union and Confederate officers, White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, 1869 James Conner (September 1, 1829 - June 26, 1883), was a Confederate States Army brigadier-general during the American Civil War. He was a lawyer in South Carolina both before and after the war and was elected Attorney General of South Carolina in 1876. Early life James Conner was born on September 1, 1829, in Charleston, South Carolina. After graduating from that state's College in 1849, he studied law and practiced it in Charleston. In 1856, he was appointed United States district attorney and served in this office until 1860. Conner authored The History of a Suit at Law (1857). He prosecuted the famous case against the slave ship Echo.The captured the Echo, a ship based in New Orleans, Louisiana, off the coast of Cuba with 318 slaves aboard. The captain was sent to Boston, Massachusetts, for trial but the crew was sent to Charleston, South Carolina. The surviving Africans were repatriated. In April 1859, a jury in Charleston found the crew members not guilty of violating United States laws against the slave trade. Andrew, Rod. Wade Hampton: Confederate warrior to southern redeemer. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2008. . Retrieved July 26, 2011. pp.54-55 He also prosecuted a member of William Walker's filibustering effort. Conner was a secessionist and supported the calling of a secessionist convention. Although he was a member of the convention, he did not vote on the ordinance of secession. American Civil War James Conner participated in the bombardment of Fort Sumter as a captain of the Montgomery Guards, a South Carolina militia unit. At the beginning of the Civil War, he declined an appointment as a district attorney for the Confederacy. Instead, he became a captain in the Hampton Legion and fought at the Battle of First Bull Run (First Manassas), taking temporary command of the legion after Colonel Wade Hampton was wounded. On July 21, 1861, Conner was appointed major of Hampton's Legion. After the Battle of Seven Pines during the Peninsula Campaign, he took command of the 22nd North Carolina Volunteer Infantry Regiment. During the Seven Days Battles, his leg was broken by a rifle ball during the Battle of Gaines Mill. After a two-month recovery period, he returned to lead his regiment at the Battle of Chancellorsville and the Battle of Gettysburg. He resigned his command on August 13, 1863, and became a member of the military court of the 2nd Corps, Army of Northern Virginia. Returning to field command in 1864, Conner was promoted to brigadier-general on June 1, 1864. He temporarily commanded the brigades of Brigadier Generals Samuel McGowan and James H. Lane consecutively during the opening months of the Siege of Petersburg. He then led Major-General John B, Kershaw's former brigade during the Shenandoah Valley Campaigns of 1864. Six days before the main battle, Conner was severely wounded during a skirmish at Cedar Creek (Fisher's Hill) and he lost a leg to amputation. This effectively ended his Confederate States Army field service, although his service record shows an assignment to General Joseph E. Johnston's command on February 25, 1865. There is no record of his parole. Aftermath After the Civil War, James Conner returned to his law practice in Charleston. A member and Past Master of Landmark Lodge No. 76, A.F.M., he served as Grand Master of Masons in South Carolina from 1868 to 1870. In 1876, he was elected attorney general of South Carolina. In that office, he was able to obtain judicial confirmation of the election of former Confederate Major-General Wade Hampton as governor of the state.

The echinoderms are marine invertebrates and include the sea urchins, starfish and sea cucumbers. They are radially symmetric and have a water vascular system that operates by hydrostatic pressure, enabling them to move around by use of many suckers known as tube feet. Sea cucumbers are usually leathery, gherkin- shaped animals with a cluster of short tentacles at one end. They live on the sea bottom. Description S. lamperti has an elongated, opaque body with several dark-coloured, longitudinal stripes.Gad-Zooks Cukes! Sea Cucumbers: Not A Pretty Picture. Wet Web Media.com. Retrieved July 27, 2011. There are no tube feet on the body but a few have been modified into a tuft of pinnate feeding tentacles which are constantly in motion. The skeletal system consists of small calcareous plates which are embedded in the cuticle. These ossicles consist of little hooks that protrude through the skin and make the animal seem sticky. It moves around rapidly and efficiently using the hooks at one end of its body for adhesion while muscular contractions and hydrostatic pressure changes alter the position of the other end.Aquarium Invertebrates: The Medusa Worms. advancedaquarist.com. Retrieved July 27, 2011. Distribution Synaptula lamperti S. lamperti is found in the Western Pacific including the coasts of Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Micronesia and the Philippines. Biology S. lamperti is very common on coral reefs, both on the exposed and the inner slopes. It is a detrivore that specifically feeds on or around living sponges of the Ianthella basta species. It appears to require the nutrients provided by this particular sponge to thrive, as it ingests microscopic organic particles such as diatoms and also substances exuded from the surface of its host sponge.Hammond, L. S., and C. R. Wilkinson. 1989. Exploitation of sponge exudates by coral reef holothuroids. Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology 94:1–10. It feeds only at night, and food is processed rapidly, with a passage time though the digestive tract of under an hour.Synaptula lamperti. World Database of Marine Species. Retrieved July 27, 2011. Most individuals of S. lamperti are either male or female, but hermaphrodites occasionally occur and self-fertilisation may take place. The closely related species Synaptula hydriformis has been studied in detail and its fertilised eggs are retained in the coelom where the juveniles develop in a safe protected environment.Frick, J. E. 1998. Evidence of matrotrophy in the viviparous holothuroid echinoderm Synaptula hydriformis. Invertebrate Biology 117:169–179.

It provides bioinformatics support for all researchers and students in a wide range of projects and services of local and national significance. Researchers can engage with Melbourne Bioinformatics through training and consulting with experts which can lead to project collaborations with academic staff within the University of Melbourne. History The VLSCI was established as part of the Victorian government's plans to support biotechnology, and was listed as a key infrastructure project in the Victorian Biotechnology Action Plan 2011. It was a $100m initiative of the Victorian Government in partnership with The University of Melbourne and the IBM Life Sciences Research Collaboratory, Melbourne. Other major stakeholders included key Victorian health and medical research institutions, major universities and public research organisations. In 2015 the VLSCI transitioned to a new governance model after receiving a further $6.65m from the Victorian State Government. The first IBM Research Collaboratory for Life Sciences was co-located at VLSCI for 5 years. Since moving to the nearby offices of IBM Research Australia, Collaboratory staff have continued to work on a range of projects as part of a broader University of Melbourne/IBM partnership under the new name of Melbourne Bioinformatics. alt=A Melbourne Bioinformatics's petascale high performance computation facility was accessible to researchers in Victoria by operating across various universities and research institutes in Melbourne. The clusters were in the top 500 worldwide in 2017. Technical experts were on staff to maximise the user experience, meet the skills gaps in research teams, build the necessary cross-disciplinary research collaborations, and provide skills to scale up projects to efficiently use the processing power being delivered. Ongoing skills development and training was provided in computational biology, molecular modelling and bioinformatics. The Computers At its peak, the VLSCI's Peak Computing Facility operated at 855 teraflops. The systems included 'Barcoo', an IBM iDataplex x86, 'Merri', an IBM iDataplex x86 and 'Avoca', comprising 4 racks of IBM Blue Gene/Q. Peak Computing Facility The VLSCI Peak Computing Facility (PCF) provided high-performance compute infrastructure and computational expertise to Life Sciences researchers across Victoria. The PCF had tightly-coupled clusters with very fast disk subsystems, currently operating at a peak capacity of 855 teraflops. To help researchers maximize their use of compute time and get the most out of their allocated resources, the PCF had a team of system administrators, programmers and application specialists accessible through its help request system. Life Sciences Computation Centre The VLSCI Life Science Computation Centre (LSCC) was physically housed at the University of Melbourne and La Trobe University, and with many staff working at various research institutes including the Peter Doherty Institute for some portion of their week. The LSCC was a distributed pool of expertise and infrastructure for computational life science research, servicing life science research institutions across Victoria. It aimed to foster research collaboration and support to a relatively small number of specific external projects; act as a source of common resources, software platforms and expertise to support life science researchers; offer research training, education, and career development for bioinformaticians and computational biologists, to support the advancement of the Victorian computational life sciences research community; and support the advancement of life science computation as a whole in Victoria.

The nomination and subsequent election process, as well as that of her fellow magistrate Jorge Pretelt Chlajub which occurred at the same time, were criticised by Elección Visible, an election watchdog organization, for lack of transparency and the clear existence of back-door deals that permitted their election to have been secured from the beginning, and thus ignoring the ternary nomination process in which three compelling candidates are nominated and the Senate elects the best option; in their respective cases, each ternary list was composed of the favourite candidate and two lesser choices. This lack of seriousness in the process was coupled in the media with the perception that President Uribe broke tradition by nominating candidates who were neither constitutional scholars, respected professors in academia, nor held a PhDin marked contrast to their predecessors in the Court. Magistrateship Calle's views were unknown at the time of her nomination and was generally regarded as a conservative, as her husband, Gustavo Eduardo Gómez Aranguren, a Magistrate of the Council of State had defined conservative views, and because of her nomination and strong backing by the conservative leaning Administration of President Uribe.

It is the second of the thirteen Pooch the Pup cartoons. Plot Pooch operates a meat store in the city. One day, he receives an order by phone from his sweetheart, the girl coonhound, who calls for a stout chicken. Pooch then selects the right meat for the order and sets off in his horse-drawn carriage. Pooch arrives at the house of his recipient. As he comes to the door carrying a basket with the order, a mischievous pet cat takes a peek. The cat, for some reason, takes the chicken from the container and runs off, prompting Pooch and the girl coonhound to go after. At the front yard of the house, Pooch grabs hold of the chicken but the cat refuses to let go. To help her boyfriend, the girl coonhound also pulls from behind. This tug-of-war lead to the dogs taking the skeleton, and the cat taking the skin, therefore ruining the order. It also results in Pooch trampling on the girl coonhound, knocking her unconscious. Trying to revive her, the worried Pooch pours two buckets of water on his sweetheart but to no avail. Meanwhile, the cat plans to create more mischief by attaching one end of a long rope to an automatic wringer and goes inside the house carrying the other end. Pooch is still in the front yard, not knowing what to do as the girl coonhound is still in coma. Just then, the cat comes to them, pretending to regret what happened as well as encouraging Pooch to kick it in the rear. Obliged, Pooch delivers a kick, but the sneaky feline quickly puts the other end of the rope around his leg. The cat then activates the automatic wringer, and Pooch is pulled away. As he is dragged by the long string, the helpless Pooch goes around beds, stair handrails, and rooftops. While he is able to remove the rope from his leg at some point, it comes back somehow. Along the way, he catches a hefty chicken. When Pooch is getting closer to the wringer, the cat, standing next to the machine, begins celebrating. This enjoyment would be cut short as the feline is nabbed by Pooch's new chicken, resulting all three of them to be wringed. The girl coonhound, who already regained consciousness, comes by and notices the wringer being turned on. Exiting the machine first is the cat which walks away in a flat dimension. Finally, a daze Pooch pops his head out. He also shows the chicken he caught which is now featherless. Amazed by the sight, the girl coonhound embraces and kisses him.

It is situated on National Highway No.7 only 16 km from Rewa towards Allahabad in Madhya Pradesh (India). Sri Aurobindo's sacred relics were installed here on 31.11.1975 on the auspicious day of Deepawali. Since then, Sri Aurobindo Bal Vidya Mandir (the school), Mira Aditi Shishu Chhatrawas (the hostel), Sri Aurobindo Library, Aradhana (the community kitchen) and Sadhana (the guest house) have evolved as component parts of Ma Mandir. Sri Aurobindo Ashram (Ma Mandir)  Characteristic Features  (a) Ma Mandir is a meeting place of two revolutions-the Green-\\"Harit Kranti\\" & the Gold-\\"Divya Kranti\\". (b) It is also the fusing point of the outer fire and the inner fire. (c) It is again the meeting point of two rebirths – \\"Jayantigram\\" and \\"SriAurobindogram\\". (a) The two revolutions:- There is an interesting story behind the two revolutions that were taking place almost simultaneously. People of this village, formerly known as Mahasua, had been living in poverty since generations. Many of them worked as labours in the feudal form of society. After the independence, a great urge was seen in them to liberate themselves from this slavery. By providential help and favorable circumstances, they were freed and their small agricultural holdings were regained from the possessions of the money lenders and land lords. In 1965-66 villagers faced unprecedented draught when almost half of Madhya Pradesh state was stricken by worst type of famine. These marginal farmers in possession for tiny pieces of lands as the only means of livelihood could not sow a single grain for want of rain and suffered from starvation. A disciple of the Mother and Sri Aurobindo in this village wrote to the Mother about the calamitous situation and begged for the relief. The Mother soon responded to his prayer and sent her blessing packet. The petals in the blessing packet were mixed with a small quantity of wheat and sown in one acre area of land. The land was irrigated with water drawn in buckets from deep wells. With Mothers grace and to everyone's surprise the miracle happened. A bumper crop, such as never seen before, came up in the parched land. The yield was incredible, which was more than the usual yield of 10 Acres of land at that time. And the famine stricken village became the origin of Green Revolution in Rewa Division. Now, with passage of time many who worked as labourer are in possession of tractors, zeeps, cars and their own harvesting machine, implements, tube wells. Pukka buildings have replaced the thatched roof huts. Kamal Kalash (Relics of Sri Aurobindo) (b) The fusing of the outer fire and the inner fire:- On 6 February 1960, the village school suddenly caught fire at about 5 O’clock in the evening. The village people ran up with ladders and buckets of water to douse the fire. By the time they could extinguish it another house belonging to one of the devotee of the Mother caught fire causing panic in the village. That too was controlled but within a span of few hours yet another house caught fire. This mysterious phenomenon continued for eight days in different places of the village in full presence of police and hundreds of people. Villagers then decided to place Mothers calendar in each house and sent 4 to 5 urgent telegrams daily to the Mother praying her to intervene. After a week, the Mother's power intervened and the attack of hostile power ceased and normalcy was restored. But the other part of the story is equally thrilling and marvelous. It is the story of outpouring of Mothers grace and aspiration of villagers for the Divine Mother to take charge of their lives. The outer fire ignited the inner fire in the villagers. The Mother power stole through the innocent hearts with unquenching thirst for the inner flame. One night a devotee saw in his vision that Sri Aurobindo has come to his village with several of his disciples from different parts of the earth. They were all assembled in the place where the Ma Mandir is situated now and Sri Aurobindo was seated in a temple which had a resemblance with Ma Mandir. Sri Aurobindo's disciples were rendering Savitri extempore like a munificent flow of divine power, peace and bliss from a higher domain of consciousness around Ma Mandir. (c) The two rebirths:- – (Jayantigram and SriAurbindogram) The Harit Kranti (Green Revolution) had put the spot light on the village and as a result of it many of the government developmental schemes were implemented. The government was satisfied with the spirit with which the village people laboured to implementation these schemes and brought about an overall socio-economic development of the region. As a result, the government of M.P in the Silver Jubilee year of the Indian independence in 1972 renamed this village as the ‘Jayatigram’. In the same year i.e. 1972 which was also the Sri Aurobindo's birth centenary year the Mother blessed this village with a new name ‘Sri Aurobindogram’ for reasons still unknown. Sri Aurobindogram is Hindi translation of Auroville. The mystery is yet to be resolved if there is any inner link between the two. Ma Mandir is the Psychic heart of Sri Aurobindogram.  Matri Mandir of Auroville and Ma Mandir of Sri Aurobindogram There is a striking similarity between the inception of Matri Mandir and Ma Mandir in so for as both have descended from subtle world without any human pre-plans and designs. Both were seen almost in the same periods i.e. in seventies of twentieth century. The Mother saw Auroville in vision first in her very young age as the most beautiful place in the world from the point of physical material nature- ‘park with water and trees … palms and ferns, all varieties of palms,’ (Mother's agenda Vol. VI page 140). She saw it frequently later in seventies in much detail and discussed about the plan of Auroville and Matri Mandir with the architects and suggested changes from time to time to reconcile with her vision. The Mother told in her talk of 21 September 1966 (see Mother's agenda Vol. VII) that the birth of Auroville was not preceded by any thought, it was a force acting .It came as an answer to the present day human folly of creating formidable means of catastrophe...... I had a revelation in the sense that it was more on the order of a vision.’ Ma Mandir too was seen almost at the same time in so distinct and powerful vision. It radiated tremendous power of Light illuminating the world. Meditation Hall (Ma Mandir)  The inception of Ma Mandir and its growth  The story of inception of Ma Mandir is not only very interesting but all full of inner significance. It was in 1958 when one night as mentioned above Sri Aurobindo appeared in a vision to have come in this village, then called Mahasua. He was seated on an abode which looked like a temple and existed exactly at the place where Ma Mandir is now situated. Again in 1969 in a very distinct vision, Ma Mandir was seen located exactly at the place where it was built later in 1975. Mother’s diamond light was seen emerging suddenly from its central abode – The ‘Garva Mandir’ pervading and illuminating the universe as if thousands of suns were in the sky. This was interpreted that some unprecedented power has descended at the temple. The vision was so distinct and captivating that an outline of the structure was drawn and sent to the Mother to know what it exactly meant. And the Mother identifying it wrote back- 'Ma Mandir' Blessings \\\\- The Mother This proved to be the choicest Grace for the village people. Ma Mandir which was seen in the subtle world had to be materialized. So the work was started to build it in 1972 without any aid, plane or expertise simply by laymen, women and village children. Ardent aspiration was the only plane and expertise with them. After completion Ma Mandir was inaugurated on 3 November 1975 the day of light (Deepawali) with the installation of sacred relics of Sri Aurobindo. Later several of its component parts, such as Chhatravas, Sri Aurobindo pustakalaya, Aradhana Bhavan, Sadhana Bhavan and a small dairy were developed. Ma Mandir has beautiful premises with greenery and plantation all around.  Aims of Ma Mandir  Ma Mandir aims at fulfilling the objectives of Sri Aurobindo yoga. (a) Divinization of life individually and collectively. (b) Growing a nursery of higher consciousness for the new creation. (c) Creating an egoless society. Divinization of life:- Sri Aurobindo yoga is not a spiritual discipline of renunciation of life and hard Tapashya. Its aim is not even to seek salvation in self or the extinction in the ‘Nirvana’ by negating life and its meaning. Instead of killing the senses, it tries to strengthen and divinize them by transformation of lower nature. In all the conventional spiritual disciplines, a barrier was erected between the inner and the outer life resulting in division of human personality into different compartments. This separation of inner from the outer is the central cause of the whole problem which prevents man from realizing the godhead that he really is. For this divinization, Sadhana proceeds in 4 stages that go on simultaneously and consecutively at the same time. Lotus Pool (Ma Mandir) (i) The Ascent of consciousness (ii) Awakening of psychic being (iii) The descent of consciousness (iv) Manifestation of consciousness and transformation of entire nature. (i) The ascent of consciousness is practiced by constant prayer and meditation and by the yoga of Karma, Bhakti and Gyana. The yoga of Surrender helps the process of awakening and raising the occult and spiritual forces latent in the mental, vital and material planes of our being. By constant practice, the consciousness ascends from ‘Muladhar’ (The material plexus) to ‘Shahasra’ (The spiritual Plexus) till it attains the supreme consciousness i.e. the Supramental consciousness. (ii) The awakening of psychic being is most important in Sri Aurobindo yoga. The psychic being is the grain of divinity hidden and latent behind our mind, life and body. It supports their outward play. By intense aspiration and constant surrender the psychic can be awakened and brought in the front to lead the outer life to the process of purification and transformation. (iii) The descent of conciseness from spiritual planes to the mental, vital and material planes of life takes place as an answer to the call or aspiration for a higher life. Once the psychic is in the front, the descent becomes possible because the psychic being deepens the aspiration more and more and the divine consciousness percolates stage by stage from the superconscient to the subconscient and the inconscient. It makes a bridge between the spirit and the matter through subtle centers of energy called ‘Chakras’. The frequent phenomenon of ascent and descent makes the transformation of human nature possible. This also effectively reconciles the contradiction of spiritual and the material life, which is the cause of most of the problems in human life. (vi) Manifestation and transformation is the ultimate result of joining the two ends of human consciousness – spirit and matter. The divinity manifests with the descent and establishment of Supramental consciousness on earth consciousness both individually and collectively. Nursery of higher consciousness for the new creation:- After the descent and manifestation of Supramental consciousness on earth in 1956 the whole Creation has started reacting, receiving or repelling it. Ma Mandir has a providential grace to have instruments and medium to receive the downpour of this supreme light and power. It is this grace that has led us to start Mira Aditi Shishu Chhatravas-the hostel of small children, who constantly bathe in the sunshine of this gracious light. The children are brought up in the beautiful campus of Ma. Mandir and exposed to the vibrant atmosphere of Sri Aurobindo's sacred relics and the Mother's presence. Miraculous things are taking place in shaping these children of tomorrow. They may prove the seedlings of the new creation. The hostel is small laboratory of divine consciousness where experiments are going on individually and collectively on the effects, actions and reactions of the descent of divine power. The results, so for, are satisfactory. Ma Mandir-Garden Creating an egoless and supporting society:- Ma Mandir aims not at individual ‘Siddhi’ or salvation. It strives to prepare ground for creating an egoless society on the principle of unity in diversity. To create such an ideal society, individual and collective ‘Sadhana’ is indispensable without distinction of caste, creed, sex, nationality or status. Such a society has to evolve purely on the principles of equality of opportunity and liberty, on the choice of work done for the benefit of humanity. Mutual understanding nourished by divine love will be the basis for community life. There will be no temptation for private property and profit.

The research and prototype were developed by researchers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, CA, and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, CA. The project name stands for \\"Sounding Oceanographic Lagrangrian Observer Thermal RECharging\\" vehicle.Vu, Q. \\"Jet Propulsion Laboratory\\", July 25, 2011, Nasa Site Retrieved July 2011 History Research and technology development for SOLO-TREC began in 2004 with funding provided by JPL Research & Technology Development program (2005–2007) and the Office of Naval Research (2008–2010). On November 30, 2009, the first SOLO-TREC prototype was deployed 161 kilometers southwest of Honolulu by a group of scientists and engineers from JPL and Scripps. Design The original prototype weighed 84 kilograms, dived autonomously to depths of 500 meters, and generated 1.7 watt-hours of energy per dive. SOLO- TREC draws upon the ocean's thermal energy as it alternately encounters warm surface water and colder conditions at depth.Hambling, D. \\"Popular Mechanics\\", April 10, 2010 Article Retrieved July 2011 Key to its operation are the carefully selected waxy substances known as phase-change materials that are contained in 10 external tubes, which house enough material to allow net power generation.Guevin, J. \\"CNET\\", April 5, 2010, News Retrieved July 2011 As the float surfaces and encounters warm temperatures, the material melts and expands; when it dives and enters cooler waters, the material solidifies and contracts. The expansion of the wax pressurizes oil stored inside the float. This oil periodically drives a hydraulic motor that generates electricity and recharges the vehicle's batteries. Energy from the rechargeable batteries powers the float's hydraulic system, which changes the float's volume (and hence buoyancy), allowing it to move vertically. Recent Developments SOLO- TREC has completed more than 450 dives from the ocean surface to a depth of 500 meters (1,640 feet) and is reporting temperature and salinity profiles three times per day. Designers control the depth to which the instrument dives through its hydraulic system. Its thermal recharging engine produces about 1.7 watt-hours, or 6,100 joules, of energy per dive, enough electricity to operate the vehicle’s science instruments, GPS receiver, communications device and buoyancy-control pump. SOLO-TREC has the potential to replace current ocean monitoring currently done by 3,200 battery-powered Argo floats deployed previously to measure temperature, salinity, and velocity. The US Navy is also exploring the use of thermal recharging technology for the next generation of autonomous submersible vehicles. Scalable for use on most robotic oceanographic vehicles, this technology breakthrough could usher in a new generation of autonomous underwater vehicles capable of virtually indefinite ocean monitoring for climate and marine animal studies, exploration and surveillance.

Archaeologists believe that the shrine, unearthed in 2005, consists of two layers: a brick temple constructed during the Sangam period (the 3rd century BC to the 3rd century AD) and a granite Pallava temple dating from the 8th century AD and constructed on top of the brick shrine making it the oldest temple in india. The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) team which conducted the excavation believe that brick temple could be the oldest of its kind to be discovered in Tamil Nadu. The temple was discovered by a team of archaeologists from the ASI based on clues found in a rock inscription left exposed by the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. Initially, excavations revealed an 8th-century Pallava-era shrine. Further excavations revealed that the 8th-century shrine had been built on the brick foundation of an earlier shrine. The brick shrine has been dated to the Sangam period. The temple faces north, unlike most Hindu temples. Artefacts from two phases, the Sangam phase as well as the Pallava phase, have been found. The temple is Tamil Nadu's oldest shrine to Murugan. It is also believed to be one of only two pre-Pallava temples to be discovered in the state, the other being the Veetrirundha Perumal Temple at Veppathur. On the night of 3 May 2018 somebody vandalized the site by uprooting the Stone Vel and breaking it into two pieces.  Discovery  After the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami had subsided, archaeologists discovered rock inscriptions which had been exposed by the tsunami waves close to the hamlet of Saluvankuppam, near the UNESCO-designated World Heritage Site of Mahabalipuram. The inscriptions by the Rashtrakuta king Krishna III and the Chola kings Parantaka I and Kulothunga Chola I spoke of a Subrahmanya Temple at Thiruvizhchil (the present day Saluvanakuppam). S. Rajavelu, epigraphist with the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), identified a nearby mound as the site of the temple. In 2005, archaeologists unearthed an 8th-century Pallava temple under the mound. G. Thirumoorthy, ASI Assistant Archaeologist, believed that the shrine could be the oldest Murugan temple to be excavated in Tamil Nadu. There were speculations on whether the temple could be one of the \\"Seven Pagodas\\". Stone left However, further excavations revealed that the 8th-century temple was constructed over the remains of an older brick temple. According to Thirumoorthy, the garbhagriha or sanctum sanctorum of the brick temple was filled with sand and covered with granite slabs upon which the newer temple was constructed. Sathyamurthy, Superintendent, ASI Chennai Circle, said that the brick temple could be dated to the Sangam period as the shrine faced north unlike modern temples which face either east or west. This proved conclusively that the temple was constructed before the 6th or 7th century AD when the shilpa shastras, the canonical texts of temple architecture, were written. Estimates of the age of the brick shrine range from 1700 to 2200 years. Archaeologists believe that the brick shrine was destroyed either by a cyclone or a tsunami which took place 2,200 years ago. The Pallavas built a granite temple on the brick foundation in the 8th century AD, which also was likely to have been destroyed by a tsunami. Archaeologists believe that the second tsunami must have occurred in the 13th century AD as the latest inscriptions which speak of the shrine have been dated to 1215.  Historical background  Although the city of Mahabalipuram was constructed by the Pallava king Narasimhavarman I in the 7th century AD, there is evidence that a small port might have functioned at the site even earlier. Megalithic burial urns dating to the very dawn of the Christian era have been discovered near Mahabalipuram. The Sangam age poem Perumpāṇāṟṟuppaṭai describes a port called Nirppeyyaru which some scholars identify with the present-day Mahabalipuram. Sadras near Mahabalipuram has been identified as the site of the port of Sopatma mentioned in the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea.  Inscriptions  There are many rock inscriptions near the temple. The discovery of three granite pillars with inscriptions of grants made to the shrine led to the discovery of the temple itself. While one pillar contains an inscription recording the donation of ten kazhanchus (small balls) of gold by one Kirarpiriyan of Mahabalipuram in 858, another records the donation of 16 kazhanchus of gold in 813 for the maintenance of a lamp by a Brahmin woman named Vasanthanar. The third pillar has an inscription by Raja Raja Chola I. Apart from these, there are five other pillars with inscriptions by the Pallava kings Dantivarman I, Nandivarman III and Kambavarman, the Rashtrakuta king Krishna III and the Chola king Rajendra Chola III.  Architecture  A portion of the brick prakara or compound wall of the Murugan Temple The Garbhagriha or sanctum sanctorum of the Murugan Temple, Saluvankuppam. While the thin, tabular bricks at the top were laid by the Pallavas, the larger bricks underneath date from the Sangam period The temple is dedicated to the Tamil deity Murugan and faces north. The garbhagriha or sanctum sanctorum is 2 metres long and 2.2 metres wide and is made of 27 courses of bricks. The bricks used are similar to the ones used in other Sangam age sites such as Puhar, Urayur, Mangudi and Arikamedu. A stone vel is positioned at the entrance of the shrine. During the excavations, a terracotta plaque depicting a Kuravai Koothu, a dance which is mentioned in the 1st century AD Tamil epic Silappadhikaram, was discovered. Sathyamoorthy feels that there may not have been any idol in the square garbhagriha as it is too small to house one. The temple is surrounded by a prakara or a compound wall dating from the Sangam period. According to Thirumoorthy, the shrine is \\"the biggest brick temple complex dating to the pre-Pallava period\\". The temple is built on a cushion of alluvium on which a layer of man-made bricks were laid. On top of this were another four layers of man-made bricks separated by four layers of laterite. There were two types of bricks used: large-sized laterite bricks of the Sangam period and thin, tabular bricks of a later age. The bricks were plastered together with lime.  Artefacts unearthed  Potsherds and granite slabs unearthed at the excavation site. Some of the potsherds have been dated to the Sangam period A terracotta Nandi (the bull of the god Shiva ), head of a woman, terracotta lamps, potsherds and a shivalinga (an iconic symbol of Shiva) made of green stone are some of the important artifacts found at the site. The Nandi is the first one made of terracotta to be found. While most of the items unearthed belong to the Sangam period, artefacts of a later period including a Chola copper coin have also been found.

Early life Rhodes-Moorhouse was born on 4 March 1914 at a house in Brompton Square, London. He was the son of William Barnard Rhodes-Moorhouse and Linda Beatrice (née Morrit). His father served as a pilot with the Royal Flying Corps in the First World War, but was killed in April 1915 when the younger Rhodes-Moorhouse was little more than a year old. He had been wounded in action during a bombing raid near Kortrijk, Belgium, and died of his injuries the next day. The elder Rhodes-Moorhouse was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions in that last raid, becoming the first airman to receive the medal. The Rhodes-Moorhouse family enjoyed considerable wealth and circulated in the top echelons of upper-class society of the time. William was educated at Eton College, where he was able to obtain his pilot's licence aged 17.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-11951642 In October 1933, William inherited his father's estate of over £250,000 (a huge sum for the time). After travelling extensively, on 15 September 1936 at Marylebone Rhodes-Moorhouse married Amalia Demetriadi, who had been approached to be screen-tested for the role of Scarlett O'Hara in the film Gone with the Wind, but declined. A keen sportsman, Rhodes-Moorhouse was selected for the British Winter Olympics team for the 1936 Winter Olympics, but an accident on the ski jump prevented him from competing. Royal Air Force In 1937 he joined the Royal Air Force (RAF), flying Bristol Blenheims with No. 601 Squadron RAF. At the start of the Second World War, No. 601 Squadron moved to Biggin Hill. On 28 November 1939 Rhodes-Moorhouse participated in a raid by the squadron's Blenheims on the German seaplane base at Borkum. The squadron re-equipped with the Hawker Hurricane in March 1940. With the German attack on France in May 1940 'A' flight of No. 601 Squadron were sent to Merville airfield. Rhodes-Moorhouse claimed a Heinkel He-111 bomber shot down near Brussels on 18 May. On 19 May he force-landed Hurricane L2088 after the auxiliary fuel tank was holed by return fire from a Bf 110 near Douai. He then claimed a Bf 109 shot down on 22 May. No. 601 Squadron's forces were withdrawn to Tangmere on 17 June, and in July flew against the initial Luftwaffe attacks over the Channel and the south coast. Rhodes-Moorhouse shared in the destruction of a Do17 on 7 July and 11 July. He also claimed a Ju88 and shared another on 16 July. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross in late July 1940. On 11 August Rhodes-Moorhouse claimed two Bf 109s destroyed. On that same day, his wife Amalia's 21 year old brother, Dick Demetriadi, who served in the same squadron, was shot down and killed.http://sussexhistoryforum.co.uk/index.php?topic=9905.0 He claimed another Bf 109 on 18 August, a shared He111 on 30 August, and two Bf 109s probably destroyed on 31 August, with a Do17 destroyed on 4 September.

Its goal was to create an internationally recognized logo to support the global human rights movement. The winning logo was created by Predrag Stakić from Serbia. The winning logo The Human Rights Logo combines the silhouette of a hand with that of a bird, and a white thumb grabbing the bird. It is intended as a peaceful contribution towards strengthening human rights and as such is meant to be used across cultural and language borders. The logo is now available to everyone at no cost as an open source product. It is free from rights and can be used worldwide by everyone without paying fees or obtaining licenses. The competition The goal of the Logo for Human Rights initiative was to create an internationally recognized symbol for human rights. To this end, an international online design competition starting on 3 May 2011 (World Press Freedom Day) launched a global appeal for submissions of logo designs and put them to a vote. The competition is known as one of the largest, most complex creative crowdsourcing projects ever conducted. From the more than 15,300 suggestions from over 190 countries a collective decision by all participants selected the top hundred logos, after which an international jury decided on the top ten logos. From these 10 logos, the internet community selected a winner within a three-week voting period. The competition officially ended on 23 September with the presentation of the universal logo for human rights during UN General Assembly week in New York City by Cinema for Peace. Presentation of the winning logo The presentation of the winning logo took place on 23 September 2011 in New York, in an event organised by Cinema for Peace with former editor-in-chief of Time Magazine Michael Elliott hosting the event. In speeches, television journalist Ann Curry and German Federal Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle, as well as human rights activists Carolyn Gomes from Jamaica and Angelina Atyam from Uganda, emphasized the importance of a universal symbol in the worldwide struggle for human rights. The musical highlight of the evening was a performance by soprano Jessye Norman. The jury The initiative is supported by a jury of renowned and high-ranking personalities, who have worked to further the cause of human rights. These include: *Ai Weiwei (artist and human rights activist) *Angelina Acheng Atyam (human rights activist, winner of the United Nations Human Rights Award) *Jimmy Carter (Nobel Peace Prize laureate) *Aung San Suu Kyi (Nobel Peace Prize laureate) *Waris Dirie (model and human rights activist) *Shirin Ebadi (Nobel Peace Prize laureate) *Roland Emmerich (film director and producer) *Guillermo Fariñas (human rights activist) *Carolyn Gomes (human rights activist) *Mikhail Gorbachev (Nobel Peace Prize laureate) *Mukhtar Mai (human rights activist) *Somaly Mam (human rights activist) *Juanes (singer and peace activist) *Navanethem Pillay (UN High Commissioner for Human Rights) *Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu (winner of the 2010 Citizens Peace Award of the National Peace Council of Sri Lanka) *Jimmy Wales (co- founder of Wikipedia) *George Yeo (former Singaporean Minister for Foreign Affairs and visiting scholar at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy) *Muhammad Yunus (Nobel Peace Prize laureate) In addition to the jury members, the foreign ministers of the founding countries (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Canada, Chile, the Czech Republic, Germany, Mauritius, Senegal, Singapore and Uruguay) are partners to the initiative.

Like many aircraft engines in Japan, there were multiple designations for this engine. The company model designation was A6(7) while it was an experimental engine project. Once accepted, it was known as the \\"Shinten\\" or MK1 by the IJNAS, and Ha6 by the IJAAS.Francillon, René J. Japanese Aircraft of the Pacific War. p. 515 Design and development The Mitsubishi Shinten was a development of the Mitsubishi Kinsei engine. The stroke of the Kinsei was increased from to on the Shinten model 11 and to on the Shinten model 21 and 21Kai designs. Lengthening the stroke increased the displacement from the Kinsei's to for the Shinten model 11. The increased displacement raised the horsepower from to at take-off power. Initially the Ha6 was to be installed on the IJAAS Mitsubishi Ki-21 bomber aircraft, but it was decided to use a competing engine, the Nakajima Ha5 instead. Furthermore, Mitsubishi was ordered to produce Nakajima's engine at its factory under license. So only 113 Shinten/Ha6 engines were made and they were installed on only few types of aircraft. In order to beat the rival and also to develop a more powerful engine for the new Navy Attack Bomber that became the infamous Mitsubishi G6M Betty, the Shinten was developed into the Mitsubishi Kasei by increasing the bore from to which in turn brought the displacement to and increased power to . IJNAS engine naming method It was the Imperial Japanese Navy's common practice to refer to its engines by name. The Japanese method of identifying model numbers of aircraft engines is unique in that the model number always has two digits and may be followed by one or more letters. The first digit represents the major version of the engine and the second number represents the minor version of that model engine. The first model number assigned to an engine is always 11, meaning the first major design and first minor version of that design. A major change to the design increments the first number and resets the second number to one. A minor change to the engine model increments the second number by one. If a very minor change is made, suffix letters are added after the model number. When a special modification is made, the model number is followed by the suffix 'kai', as in the Shinten Model 21kai, which decodes as the second model of the Shinten engine, 1st revision, specially modified. IJAAS engine naming method The Imperial Japanese Army Air Service referred to its engines by their engine (Japanese:Hatsudoki abbreviated Ha) model number. Ha numbers were assigned in sequence as the engine design was accepted. This engine (Ha6) would be the 6th engine accepted by the IJAAS.

Traditionally, silk mills were concentrated in Japan, England, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Switzerland. The silk throwing process Silk is a naturally produced fibre obtained from many species of the silk moth. In 1700 the favoured silk was produced by a moth (Bombyx mori), that spun a cocoon to protect the larvae. The larvae fed on mulberry leaves grown in Italy. Silk fibres from the Bombyx mori silkworm have a triangular cross section with rounded corners, 5–10 μm wide. The silk is a protein, fibroin, that was cemented in place by the use of gum, another protein, sericin. The cocoons were harvested and placed in troughs of hot water to dissolve the gum and allowed the single thread to be wound into a skein. The skeins were placed into bales and taken to the mill for processing. Three sorts of yarn could be produced: no-twist which was suitable for weft, tram that had received a slight twist making it easier to handle, and organizine which had a greater twist and was suitable for use as warp. Reeling is the industrial process where silk that has been wound into skeins, is cleaned, receives a twist and is wound onto bobbins. Silk throwing is the process where the thread from the bobbins is twisted again to form tram and or organzine. The yarn is twisted together into threads, in a process known as doubling. Colloquially silk throwing can be used to refer to the whole process: reeling, throwing and doubling. History The Itailans were the first to build mills that contained anything more than a set of spinning wheels. Thomas Cotchett's mill, was built in Derby in 1704, and was a failure. John Lombe had visited the successful silk throwing mill in Piedmont in 1716, an early example of industrial espionage. He returned to Derby with the necessary knowledge, with details of the Italian silk throwing machines – the filatoio and the torcitoio – and some Italian craftsmen. He designed the mill, and with his half-brother Thomas Lombe (born 1685) instructed George Sorocold to build it and fit it with the new machines. Lombe's Mill was the first successful silk throwing mill in England and probably the first fully mechanised factory in the world. Between 1717 and 1721 George built the mill, beside the River Derwent to the south of Cotchett's failed Mill to house machines for \\"doubling\\" or twisting silk into thread. The machines required large buildings and a power source. An undershot water wheel turned by the mill fleam served the purpose. John Lombe was given a 14-year patent to protect the design of the throwing machines. The King of Sardinia reacted badly to the commercial challenge, placing an embargo on the export of raw silk. John's elder brother, Sir Thomas Lombe, took over the business. When the patents lapsed in 1732, other mills were built in Stockport and Macclesfield. : \\"The original Italian works of five storeys high housed 26 Italian winding engines that spun the raw silk on each of the upper three floors whilst the lower two storeys contained eight spinning mills producing basic thread and four twist mills.\\"Bygones: From Industrial Revolution to prized museum The throwing machines were two storeys high and pierced the first floor. The winding machines were situated on the top three floors. All the machines were powered by Sorocold's 7 metres diameter, 2-metre wide external undershot waterwheel. That drove a line shaft that ran the length of the mill. The torcitoios and filatoios took their power from the shaft. The mill was heated to process the silk, and this was explained in the 1718 patent: It was reported that Lombe used a fire engine (steam engine) to pump hot air round the mill . The circular spinning machines (also known as 'throwing machines'), were the most significant innovation of the factory. Together with the single source of power (water), and the large size and organisation of the workforce for the period (200-400, according to contemporary sources), the total process of production from raw silk to fine quality thread has led the Lombes' silk mill to be described as the first successful use of the factory system in Britain.Lombe's Mill: An Exercise in Reconstruction, Industrial Archaeology Review, Anthony Calladine (1993) United States The history of industrial silk in the United States is largely tied to several smaller urban centres in the Northeast region. Beginning in the 1830s, Manchester, Connecticut emerged as the early centre of the silk industry, when the Cheney Brothers became the first to raise silkworms on an industrial scale. With the mulberry tree craze of that decade, other smaller producers began raising silkworms: this economy gained traction around Northampton, Massachusetts and Williamsburg, where a number of small firms and cooperatives emerged. William Skinner, relocated from there to the then-new city of Holyoke after the 1874 flood. Over the next 50 years he and his sons would maintain relations between the American silk industry and its counterparts in Japan,For discussion on W. Skinner II's relations with Japanese ministers and merchant-traders, see and by 1911, the Skinner Mill complex contained the world's largest silk mill under one roof: Skinner Fabrics had become the largest manufacturer of silk satins internationally. Other efforts later in the 19th century would also bring the new silk industry to Paterson, New Jersey, with several firms hiring European- born textile workers and granting it the nickname \\"Silk City\\". World War II interrupted the Asian silk trade, and silk prices increased dramatically. U.S. industry began to look for substitutes, which led to the use of synthetics such as nylon. Synthetic silks have also been made from lyocell, a type of cellulose fibre, and are often difficult to distinguish from real silk (see spider silk for more on synthetic silks). Industrial unrest In New Jersey, disputes between silk mill workers and owners lead to the 1913 Paterson silk strike and the 1926 Passaic Textile StrikeGitlow, \\"The Passaic Textile Workers Strike,\\" pg. 347. .

His earlier works reveal influences of Saygun, Usmanbaş and Ligeti (in rhythmic and contrapuntal design), at times progressing through aleatoric sections (in orchestral works). Later works combine newer timbral concerns with maqamic pitch content, microtones and elements of folk music (ornamentations, vocal and instrumental practices, etc.).  Biography  Born in Mersin, a Mediterranean city in Southern Turkey. His family moved to Istanbul in 1971. He was introduced to music by his mother, who was a ballet dancer before her marriage. He started private piano lessons with Hülya Saydam in 1980, his first compositions appeared in 1981. He entered at the Mimar Sinan University State Conservatory's composition department in 1984. Became a student of Erçivan Saydam (harmony and counterpoint), Adnan Saygun (composition, modal music and fugue) and Afşar Timuçin (history of thinking, literature and aesthetics). After his graduation in 1991, he was appointed as an instructor in the same institution. Between 1991-96 he was a student in the composition class of İlhan Usmanbaş; earned his master's degree in 1994, pursued qualification in arts studies until 1996. From 1996 to 1999 he studied at Boston University with Lukas Foss and Marjorie Merryman.

MARIA one of the languages that has been submitted for standardization at W3C.  Abstract User Interface  The MARIA Abstract User Interface (AUI) level describes a UI only through the semantics of the interaction, without referring to a particular device capability, interaction modality or implementation technology. An AUI is composed by various Presentations that groups model elements presented to the user at once. The model elements are of two types: Interactor or InteractorComposition. The former represents every type of user interaction object, the latter groups together elements that have a logical relationship. According to its semantics an interactor belongs to one of the following subtypes: * Selection. Allows the user to select one or more values among the elements of a predefined list. According to the number of values that can be selected, the interactor can be a Single Choice or a Multiple Choice. * Edit. Allows the user to manually edit the object represented by the interactor, which can be text (TextEdit), a number (NumericalEdit), a position (PositionEdit) or a generic object (ObjectEdit). * Control. Allows the user to switch between presentations (Navigator) or to activate UI functionalities (Activator). * OnlyOutput. Represents information that is submitted to the user, not affected by user actions. It can be a text a Description that represents different types of media, an Alarm, a Feedback or a generic Object. The different types of interactor-compositions are: * Grouping: a generic group of interactor elements. * Relation: a group where two or more elements are related to each other. * CompositeDescription: represents a group aimed to present contents through a mixture of Description and Navigator elements. * Repeater which is used to repeat the content according to data retrieved from a generic data source MARIA allows describing not only the presentation aspects but also the interactive behaviour. For this purpose it has various features: * Data Model: the description of the data types bound with elements of the interface. At runtime, modifying the state of an interactor will change also the value of the bound data element and vice versa, in order to describe dynamic UI changes (correlation between UI elements, conditional layout, conditional connections between presentations, input values format etc.). The data model is defined using the standard XML Schema Definition constructs. * Generic Back End. The interface definition contains a set of ExternalFunctions declarations, which represents functionalities exploited by the UI but implemented by a generic application back-end support (e.g. web services, code libraries, databases etc.). * Event Model. Each interactor definition has a number of associated events that allow the specification of UI reaction triggered by the user interaction. * Dialog Model. The dialog model contains constructs for specifying the dynamic behaviour of a presentation, specifying what events can be triggered at a given time. The dialog expressions are connected using CTT operators in order to define their temporal relationships. * Continuous update of fields. It is possible to specify that a given field should be periodically updated invoking an external function. * Dynamic Set of User Interface Elements. The language contains constructs for specifying partial presentation updates (dynamically changing the content of entire groupings) and the possibility to specify a conditional navigation between presentations. This set of new features allows having already at the abstract level a model of the user interface that is not tied to layout details, but it is complete enough for reasoning on how UI supports both the user interaction and the application back end.  Concrete User Interface  A Concrete User Interface (CUI) in MARIA provides platform- dependent but implementation language-independent details of a UI. A platform is a set of software and hardware interaction resources that characterize a given set of devices. MARIA currently supports the following platforms: * Desktop CUIs model graphical interfaces for desktop computers. * Mobile CUIs model graphical interfaces for mobile devices. * Multimodal Desktop CUIs model interfaces that combine the graphical and vocal modalities for desktop computers. * Multimodal Mobile CUIs model interfaces that combine the graphical and vocal modalities for mobile devices. * Vocal CUIs interfaces with vocal message rendering and speech recognition. Each platform meta-model is a refinement of the AUI, which specifies how a given abstract interactor can be represented in the current platform. For instance, if we consider the abstract Single Choice interactor, it can be implemented (on a graphical desktop platform) with a radio button, a drop down list or a list box, while on the vocal platform it can be rendered with a list of vocal messages for each option associated to a given keyword. The same applies for the interactor compositions: in a desktop platform a grouping can be implemented using background colours, borders etc., while in a vocal platform it is possible to use sounds before the first group element. The model definition can be exploited for creating (or deriving with a code generator) final implementations in different target languages.  Tool Support  The creation and editing of MARIA models, together with the generation of the final UI code is supported by the MARIAE tool.

Beginning on January 23, 1865, a powerful flotilla of Confederate warships bombarded Fort Brady along the James River and engaged four Union Navy ships with the intention of breaking through the blockade to attack City Point, the base of General Ulysses S. Grant who was besieging Petersburg, Virginia. After two days of fighting the rebels withdrew back up the river without completing their objectives. Background A map of the boom at Trent's reach showing the locations of sunken ships, torpedo mines, and a net. Confederate forces were under the direction of Commodore John K. Mitchell who commanded the James River Squadron in his flagship, the ironclad CSS Fredericksburg. Weighing an estimated 2,500 tons, the Fredericksburg was a formidable opponent armed with one 11-inch smoothbore cannon and three smaller rifled guns. The ironclad rams CSS Richmond and CSS Virginia II also participated in the attack. Richmond weighed an estimated 800 tons and carried six guns. The 650 ton Virginia II was armed with four guns and had a crew of about 150 officers and men, the same complement as the other two ironclads. Confederate forces deployed eight other vessels, three of which were lashed to the sides of the ironclads and the torpedo boat CSS Scorpion was towed down river by the gunboat Drewry. The other vessels were the gunboats Nansemond, Hampton, Beaufort and Torpedo, each armed with one or two guns and displacing 100 to 200 tons. The torpedo boats CSS Wasp and CSS Hornet were the last two ships in the fleet. All three of the torpedo boats carried only one spar torpedo and they were not used in the engagement at Trent's Reach. Commodore Mitchell's orders were to take his squadron down the James River to attack a supply base at City Point which belonged to General Grant's Union Army that had recently taken over the area as part of the Petersburg Campaign. However, to get to the base, the rebels had to fight their way past multiple obstacles in and along the river, including warships, a naval mine field and net, Fort Brady, and four shore batteries. Naval mines, then known as torpedoes, were widely used in the war due to their effectiveness, so to keep the rebels from sailing down the James River, the federals established a line of them from bank to bank, behind it was a net in case any of the explosives came free. The Union fortifications were under the command of Colonel Henry H. Pierce of the 1st Connecticut Heavy Artillery Regiment, mounting over thirty guns altogether. The naval forces were under Captain William A. Parker of the James River Flotilla, who led his force from the 2,592 ton ironclad monitor which carried two 15-inch smoothbore Dahlgren guns and two 150-pounder Parrott rifles. At the time Onondaga was the only Union monitor on the river though she was accompanied by the side-wheel gunboats and . USS Massasoit was a large ship, weighing 974 tons, so she was fitted out for ten guns of different sizes, including two 100-pounders. Hunchback weighed 512 tons and had an armament of four guns, one a 100-pounder. The small torpedo boat was involved in the battle as well, though because she was an experimental craft, equipped with a spar, the vessel did not participate in any actual fighting.

The Confederate Navy's attack began on the night of January 23 of 1865. Commodore Mitchell lifted anchor at Chaffin's Bluff just after sunset, his first task would be to sneak by the Union battery on Signal Hill and Fort Brady in the darkness. Colonel Pierce reported that at 8:00 pm one of his lookouts on the fort's parapet spotted the three rebel ironclads and a few of the other vessels moving down the river so immediately Pierce ordered his gunners to begin firing. The first shot of the battle was from a \\"heavy gun\\" mounted in the fort, it was followed by additional rounds from the battery. Due to the \\"mal-construction\\" of Fort Brady, as Pierce said, the artillery could not be fired down river so not long after the rebels were spotted they were out of range of the Union guns and thus slipped by apparently without damage or casualties. Some twenty-five rounds were discharged by the federal gunners in this first action. After getting past the fort, Commodore Mitchell continued on for the naval mine field at Trent's Reach. Meanwhile, two Confederate batteries, consisting of at least sixteen cannon, opened up on Pierce's position and continued to bombard it throughout the night. The Union garrison returned fire and in the exchange one 100-pounder in the fort was destroyed though Colonel Pierce reported having dislodged two rebel pieces before receiving orders to cease the engagement. The Confederates arrived at Trent's Reach at 10:30 pm, CSS Richmond and Virginia II were anchored a half a mile from the obstruction to provide covering fire while the Fredericksburg and a few of the smaller vessels cleared the way. Among the mine field were the hulks of several sunken vessels, in between them there was placed a spar torpedo, preventing any ship from passing through. The crew of the Fredericksburg went to work on removing the spar while the three torpedo boats under Lieutenant Charles \\"Savvy\\" Read, made a reconnaissance of the channel. All of this was done under \\"a perfect rain of missiles\\" from three Union shore batteries and sharpshooters who were in control of the area. Clearing the obstruction lasted into the next morning. By this time the few federal warships in the area had been dispatched to defend Trent's Reach, USS Ononadaga was the first to make it to the battle area but Captain Parker decided to withdraw back down river to a pontoon bridge at Aiken's Landing where he would have more maneuverability in a fight. Parker was later criticized for not engaging the rebels as soon as possible and he defended himself by stating that he thought his \\"chances of capturing the whole fleet would be increased by allowing them [the rebels] to come down river to the bridge.\\" An image from 1865 believed to show the wreck of CSS Drewry in the James River. The action at Trent's Reach then ceased until the next day when General Grant was informed of the situation. The general, who was not happy about Captain Parker's decision to withdraw, ordered the Onondaga to form up with the gunboats Massasoit and Hunchback for an attack on the rebel fleet. The Spuyten Duyvil had arrived in the area on the night before, under orders from Rear Admiral David Dixon Porter to sink any of the ironclads that attempt to sail on to City Point in the darkness. Parker refused to attack though and after Grant complained to Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles, the captain was relieved of duty. President Abraham Lincoln suggested that Admiral David G. Farragut take command of the operations. Admiral Farragut, who led federal forces in the New Orleans Campaign, was elsewhere at the time so while he made it to the James, Commodore William Radford was placed in charge temporarily. However, Radford was on board the USS New Ironsides at Norfolk so the defense of the James fell onto the second officer of Onondaga, Commander Edward T. Nichols, who Grant had expressed confidence in. But when it came time for battle, Captain Parker re-assumed authority and led the federal attack on January 24. Fortunately for the Union, four of the rebel ships grounded when the tide lowered that morning. At 1:45 am, Commodore Mitchell and his men finished clearing the obstructions so he steamed the Fredericksburg back over to where the remaining ships were anchored. It was then that Mitchell discovered the Virginia II, the Richmond, the Drewry, and the Scorpion were all resting on the river bottom and could not be freed until high tide which would come at about 11:00 am. The situation was complicated further at day break when the Union batteries started to become more accurate. The Richmond was hit repeatedly by artillery rounds but her armor protected her from serious damage. It was different for the unarmored gunboats, because these ships were mainly wooden vessels, they were \\"torn to pieces\\" by enemy fire. Drewry was so heavily damaged that her crew abandoned ship just in time because fifteen minutes later, at 6:55 am, a round from one of the batteries ignited the vessel's powder magazine. Instantly the gunboat exploded violently and sank. The large shock wave also heavily damaged the nearby Scorpion which had to be abandoned as well. Two men were killed on the torpedo boat and it sank along with the Drewry. To make matters worse for Commodore Mitchell, at 10:30 am lookouts spotted the Onondaga, the two gunboats, and the Spuyten Duyvil heading for them. CSS Virginia II's smokestack at Fort Brady which was blown off by cannon fire from the Union batteries. At 10:45 am, the Onondaga opened up on the grounded ironclads at a distance of around a half of a mile but the rebels could not return the fire because of the positions in which their ships were stuck, Mitchell wrote; \\"During the whole time while aground, neither the Richmond nor the Virginia [II] could get a gun to bear upon the enemy.\\" By 11:00 am the tide had been lifting for hours and just when it seemed that the Confederates were helpless to resist, their ironclads began to float again and their guns were brought to bear. Onondaga fired around seven rounds at Virginia II and when she was refloated a single shot was returned that, according to Mitchell, was \\"observed to take effect\\" upon the monitor. The naval duel did not last long compared to the other actions and it ended as the Confederates withdrew up river a short distance. The Union ships did the same and they pulled off heading down stream but the batteries kept firing all day and night. At 9:00 pm Commodore Mitchell ordered his men to make the final cruise to City Point but it was found that the Virginia II was unmanageable. She had been struck by cannon fire seventy times already and it caused steam to leak from the ironclad's deck which impaired the pilots visibility. The Drewry and the Scorpion were lost and one other torpedo boat was disabled by the federals. Union troops had also erected \\"Drummonds lights\\" that illuminated the area around the mine field, allowing the batteries to fire nearly as accurately at night as they had in the daytime. It finally became apparent to Mitchell that the mission was lost so on the next morning, at 2:45 am, the rebel fleet was turned around and went back up the James. The battle at Trent's Reach was over but in order for the rebels to get back to friendly waters they had to pass Fort Brady and the Signal Hill battery. When the time came another exchange of artillery ensued but this time the rebels stayed a while to try to silence the Union gunners. Colonel Pierce expected the ironclads to return so while they were engaging at Trent's Reach, the garrison of Fort Brady and the surrounding batteries focused on improving the defenses of their positions. Pierce placed pickets down the river and at 3:00 am one of them returned and told the colonel that the rebels were coming back. When the fighting began again it was described as being very intense but at no time were the Confederates able to silence the Union guns and they eventually broke off the action. Between 1,000 and 1,500 rounds were fired by Mitchell's ships in this final battle. In cooperation with the naval effort, Confederate troops made \\"two heavy attacks\\" on the Union Army's picket line at Bermuda Hundred on January 23 and 24. \\"Both of these attacks were handsomely repulsed,\\" a member of the 10th New York Heavy Artillery reported, \\"though pressed with great vigor.\\" The 10th New York suffered one man killed.H.A.P. [Hilon A. Parker], \\"From the 10th N. Y. Artillery,\\" Watertown \\"Northern New York Journal,\\" n.d. (February 1865). Aftermath \\"The Blowing up of the James River Fleet, on the night of the Evacuation of Richmond.\\" By Allen C. Redwood. Three Union troops were known to have been killed in the battle and more than forty were slightly wounded by splinters. The Onondaga was only slightly damaged in the action and none of her crew are known to have been harmed. According to official records the rebels lost four killed on the Drewry and the Scorpion plus fifteen wounded. However, some sources cite the rebels as having lost at least six men on the Virginia II alone. Ultimately the Confederate force failed in its main objective of attacking City Point and they had to return to Chaffin's Bluff with nothing to show for the advance other than a mess for ships, most of which sustained some type of battle damage. Commodore Mitchell was relieved of command and replaced by Admiral Raphael Semmes, who commanded CSS Alabama in her battle with USS Kearsarge off Cherbourg, France. Exactly two months after the battle, the Petersburg Campaign ended with General Robert E. Lee's final decision to evacuate the city. When the Southern capital of Richmond fell on April 3, the James River Squadron was scuttled to prevent their falling into enemy hands.

Characteristics There are two characteristic types: * binary variables, which describe the presence or not of a specific feature, * n-values variables, which describe a selection between n possible value for a specific product feature. Example of a characteristic registry: the MET, TR and ST characteristics are binary and their values determine whether the product is metallic, transparent or deformable; while the COL and SH characteristics tell the specific value of color and shape.  Constraints  The range of characteristic-value combinations is reduced by a variety of constraints that define which combinations can, cannot, and must occur alongside each other. These constraints can be reflective of technological or commercial constraints in the real world. The constraints can represent: * incompatibility: they indicate the mutual exclusivity between some product feature-values; * implication: they indicate the presence of a specific feature-value is constrained to the presence of another feature-value. Examples of constraints: on top, an incompatibility between the MET and TR features (the product can only be MET or TR but not MET and TR) and below, an implication between the ST and COL features (if the product is deformable then it must be red or green).  Characteristic filters The use of characteristics permits the user to abstract the finished product by describing filter conditions, which describe subsets of product variations using boolean functions on the characteristics: * The AND, NOR, OR logical operators use and simplify the boolean function definitions, because they permit the user to regroup together the characteristic-values which may be present (AND), absent (NOR), or not all absent (OR); * Thanks to the decoupling introduced by the use of characteristics, it is not necessary to redefine the boolean functions when new commercial codes are introduced which can be mapped to some product- variation already covered by some characteristics combination. frame|center|Example of a form that can be shown to a user of a characteristic based product configurator, and the related logical function obtained by the compilation of itself. In each mask the characteristic set are grouped together with logical AND to create subfunctions. These are then joined together with logical OR obtaining the ending result. Closed or open configuration Using a characteristic- based configurator, it is possible to define a product variation in two ways: # Open configuration: the user will simply valuate all the characteristics complying with the technological and commercial constraints, without having a set of base values to work from; # Closed configuration: it starts from a pre- selected base-preparation (representing a sub-class of product variations) which fixates a subset of characteristics, to which the user will optionally add other information valuating the (still not fixed) characteristic-values, complying with the technological and commercial constraints. It can be useful to specify that a requested characteristic-value can replace another characteristic-value that is incompatible with the requested one present in the base-preparation  Applications  Some examples of applications where using a characteristics-based product configurator may be advantageous are: *Bill of materials applications: to every part-number is associated a characteristics-filter, which selects the subset of product-variations in which the part-number will be used *Manufacturing process management systems: a characteristics-filter is associated to each operation that will select the subset of product variants where that operation is done * Commercial applications: the ordinality and mandatory requirements of a market are related to characteristic-filters that identify the product variations subset to which they apply  Examples pCon.planner from EasternGraphics is an OFML-based complex product configurator used for interior design.

Scope Persons and family relations mainly deals with the issues of family matters such as marriage, annulment and voiding of marriages, adoption, property settlements between spouses, parental authority, support for spouses and children, emancipation, legitimes (inheritance) of children from their parents and between relatives. Some of the most important coverage of this subjects is the Family Code of the Philippines, or Executive Order 209, which was enacted by former president Corazon Aquino on July 6, 1987 (taking effectivity one year later after the completion of its official publication). The main reason for enacting this code was to replace the first book of the Civil Code of the Philippines which covers relations between persons, and family. Marriage Based on the Family Code, a valid marriage requires certain essential and formal requisites. Essential requisites to marriage include legal capacity to marry and consent. Formal requisites include a valid marriage license, authority of solemnizing officer and a marriage ceremony where the contracting parties personally appear before the solemnizing officer and declare that they take each other as husband and wife in the presence of two witnesses of legal age. Absence of any of the essential and formal requisites renders a marriage void ab initio (from the beginning), except in cases such as contracting parties in good faith believed that the solemnizing officer (who had no authority to solemnize the marriage) had the authority to solemnize marriage. Thus a marriage between minors or to a minor is void. Similarly, a marriage without a valid marriage license (except in certain circumstances) is void. A defect in the essential requisites renders the marriage voidable and thus can be subject to annulment. Irregularities in the formal requisites does not affect the validity of the marriage but renders the parties responsible for such irregularities to be civilly, criminally or administratively liable. However, there are cases where some of the formal requisites are not required, which usually happens in exceptional circumstances. An example is when the parties contracting marriage are living in a remote area inaccessible to any viable means of transport, such that it renders impossible the acquisition of a marriage license. In such cases, a valid marriage license may not be required. The same is also true for ethnic marriages which can forgo the need for a valid marriage license, provided they conform to the customs for such ethnic marriages. Annulment A marriage can be annulled if there is a defect in the essential requisites. Consent obtained through fraud, deceit or violence, for example, can annul the marriage. Similarly, an individual below 21 years old who contracts to marry but does not obtain parental consent can also have their marriage annulled within the prescribed period.

Life Born in Dublin, he was educated there in a private school. While a schoolboy he achieved some reputation as a writer of farces and musical extravaganzas, and his dramatic essays were performed at the Dublin theatres in Smock Alley, Crow Street, Capel Street, and Fishamble Street. Most of these pieces were published. About 1786, Oulton left Dublin, still a youth, to try his fortunes in London. John Palmer, the lessee of the Royalty Theatre in Wellclose Square, accepted the offer of his services, and in 1787 he produced Oulton's ‘Hobson's Choice, or Thespis in Distress,’ a satire on contemporary theatrical enterprise. Its boldness annoyed the managers of the patent-houses, who were engaged in a fierce struggle with Palmer. Oulton then induced an acquaintance to offer in her name his next piece, ‘As it should be,’ to George Colman the younger of the Haymarket, where it was produced on 3 June 1789. The piece was published anonymously; but Colman discovered its author, and gave Oulton much encouragement. On 7 July 1792 he produced a short piece by Oulton, ‘All in Good Humour’ (London, 1792); there followed at the same house ‘Irish Tar,’ a musical piece, 24 August 1797; ‘The Sixty-third Letter,’ a musical farce, 28 July 1802; ‘The Sleep-walker, or which is the Lady?’ 15 June 1812; and ‘My Landlady's Gown,’ 10 August 1816. Meanwhile, at Covent Garden, Oulton secured the production of two similar pieces, ‘Perseverance,’ 2 June 1789, and ‘Botheration,’ on 2 May 1798. David Erskine Baker credited him with the choruses in Richard Brinsley Sheridan's ‘Pizarro,’ which was produced in 1799. In 1798 he provided two pantomimes, ‘Pyramus and Thisbe’ and the ‘Two Apprentices,’ for the Birmingham theatre. His last connection with the stage was on 27 February 1817, when his farce ‘Frighten'd to Death’ was produced at Drury Lane. Works In 1784, there appeared the ‘Haunted Castle,’ the ‘Happy Disguise,’ and the ‘New Wonder;’ in 1785 the ‘Madhouse,’ ‘New Way to keep a Wife at Home,’ ‘Poor Maria,’ the ‘Recruiting Manager,’ and ‘Curiosity.’ The ‘Haunted Castle’ and the ‘Madhouse’ are said to have held the stage for some years. Oulton was acquainted with the work of August von Kotzebue on which Sheridan's play Pizarro was based, and produced in 1800 a volume called ‘The Beauties of Kotzebue.’ Between 2 January and 26 February 1787, he produced a tri-weekly sheet, called The Busybody, on the model of The Spectator; at the twenty-fifth number it ceased. The whole work was issued in two volumes in 1789.‘The Busybody: a Collection of Periodical Essays, Moral, Whimsical, Comic, and Sentimental, by Mr. Oulton, Author of several Fugitive Pieces,’ London. In 1795 he published, under the pseudonym of ‘George Horne, D.D.,’ two tracts attacking the pretensions of Richard Brothers the prophet and of his disciple Nathaniel Brassey Halhed. The first was entitled ‘Sound Argument, dictated by Common-sense’ (Oxford, 1795); the second, ‘Occasional Remarks addressed to N. B. Halhed, Esq.’ (London, 1795). Oulton argued for the authenticity of Vortigern, one of the Ireland Shakespeare forgeries. He issued an anonymous pamphlet, ‘Vortigern under Consideration’ (1796), on Samuel Ireland's behalf. On recent theatrical history, he wrote ‘The History of the Theatres of London from 1771 to 1795,’ which appeared in 1796 in two volumes, a continuation of Benjamin Victor's ‘History.’ For James Barker,https://archive.org/stream/cu31924029564659#page/n29/mode/2up the theatrical publisher, he prepared in 1802, mainly ‘from the manuscripts of Mr. Henderson,’ ‘Barker's Continuation of Egerton's Theatrical Remembrancer … from 1787 to 1801.’ Finally he produced ‘A History of the Theatres of London from 1795 to 1817,’ London, 3 vols. 1818. Other publications were: * ‘Shakespeare's Poems,’ with a memoir, 1804. * ‘The Traveller's Guide; or, an English Itinerary...a complete Topography of England and Wales...Illustrated with sixty-six correct picturesque views, and a Whole-Sheet Coloured Map of England and Wales,’ London, 1805, 2 vols., published by James Cundee, Ivy-Lane. * ‘S. Gessner's Death of Abel,’ a translation, London, 1811. * ‘The Beauties of Anne Seward,’ 1813. * ‘Authentic and Impartial Memoirs of her late Majesty Charlotte, Queen of Great Britain and Ireland … assisted by eminent literary Characters,’ 1819. * ‘Picture of Margate and its Vicinity, with a Map and Twenty Views,’ 1820.

History According to Binoy Ghosh, the ancient or even the medieval history of Moyna or Moynagarh is mired in controversy and uncertainties. Some enthusiasts of local history believe that Moyna was the birth-place and capital of Lau Sen. The question that comes up in this regard is that Lau Sen's existence is yet to be established historically. He remains a mythical king. Similarly, there are various complications about the origin of the name. Setting aside these controversies, we can take up certain points from comparatively more recent history. Let us focus on the 15th century during Muslim rule. Gobardhanananda Samanta was the founder of the Moyna raj family. He was a sixth generation descendant of Kalindiram Samanta, who was a general of the Utkal kings. During his rule there was a dacoit named Sri Dhar, who had a Robin Hood imge. The Utkal king could not collect any rent from Sri Dhar, and Gobardhanananda Samanta also failed to pay his rent on time. He was imprisoned by the Utkal king but Gobardhanananda Samanta's passion for music charmed him and he was released with due honours. He ultimately succeeded in eliminating Sri Dhar.Ghosh, Binoy, Paschim Banger Sanskriti, , part II, 1976 edition, page 186, Prakash Bhaban, Kolkata. Geography Physical geography The Keleghai flows on the south of Moyna. On the north flows the Kasai, Baksui and Panchtui.

On the other side of city a person comes and threatens Hanumant’s wife of killing Hanumant and his whole family if he doesn’t stop doing his mischievous activities. Hanumant takes Mohit to a hotel and asks him how he joined Crime Branch directly and about his hobbies and personal life. He later drops him to a party and goes home. Where on arrival police informs him that gunshots were fired on his house. He tells his wife to leave India as soon as she gets her passport. Bunty bhaiya has been transferred to Delhi jail where he is treated as a high-profile personality by jailer. In jail Bunty befriends with two terrorists of Lashkar-e-Haq.

Meanwhile, Mohit tips Hanumant about their colleague Shamsher Rana trying to kill him on instructions of Rajmani. Alert, Hanumant in turn kills Shamsher faking it as a suicide case. Then Hanumant demands 15 crore from Rajmani for his release else he will post the video of Bunty's confessions to media. Hanumant is shot down, where Mohit shows his presence of mind and admits him to the hospital. In the hospital Hanumant realizes that Mohit was all along working for Rajamani. Even though Mohit is planning to eliminate Hanumant, he agrees to share his ransom money for Mohit saved his life during the drug deal encounter which genuine attempt, unlike the other attempts made to gain his confidence. Then both of them chalk out a plan to make money from Rajmani. After increasing the deal from 15 to 25 crore by sending a video recording of Bunty with Mohit in the video (which he wasn't aware of), Rajmani agreed on the deal and gives Mohit the money. Mohit shows up at the place as directed by Hanumant and drives off to meet him. In the end when Hanumant and Mohit divide their share of money, and part ways, not knowing there is a transponder in the case. Hanumant had some children call Rajmani Bunty's location and they rush off to the location. Upon entering Rajmani's car, Bunty was shot dead by Rajmani and they continue to the parliament. Not realising the reporters are watching, Rajmani is captured by the police in a road block when they saw Bunty's dead body in the car. Mohit is killed by Rajmani's people after a car chase in which he kills them all too.. Later when Hanumant goes to send money to his family through Kamlesh (Veerendra Saxena), who helps him send money when he needs to, he is shot twice by Kamlesh . Kamlesh tells him that he also has a family to feed, and that he has never seen such a big amount in his whole life and that has made him disloyal. Kamlesh then shoots him a third time before walking out with the money. He then dials a number - it is shown that Mohit's cell keeps on ringing on road where he lies dead, assuming Mohit arranged the plot, and walks off.

The 6.3 magnitude quake was rated as IX–X (Violent–Extreme) on the Mercalli intensity scale. Intensities greater than VII (Very strong) were confined to the provinces of Belluno, Treviso and Pordenone. Earthquake Main square of Belluno after the earthquake The earthquake struck at 4:29 a.m. on June 29, 1873, a day which was to be a local holiday celebrating Saint Peter and Saint Paul. The shock was strongly felt in the whole Veneto region, damaging mostly the towns located in the Alpago basin, in Val Lapisina and above the Cansiglio plateau. It was felt as far away as Genova, Marche and Umbria, Slovenia, Austria, Switzerland and Bavaria. The epicenter was at the northern edge of Santa Croce Lake, east of Belluno. Casualties and damage Dismantling the Bishops' Palace in Belluno after the earthquake Thirty people died in the Alpago area, and ten more in the rest of the Province of Belluno. The towns of Rugolo, Cappella Maggiore, and Sarmede reported 16 casualties, but in San Pietro di Feletto, 38 people perished when the old church's roof collapsed while the morning mass in honor of Saint Peter, the city's saint, was being celebrated. In the most stricken zones, a third of the buildings were damaged. In Belluno itself, the duomo's apse collapsed. Eight buildings were completely destroyed, another 110 later had to be demolished, 139 needed restoration, and 251 were in need of some work. One church was destroyed, and other seven were damaged. In the city's outskirts, two blocks had to be demolished, 21 houses needed restoration and 219 more received slight damage. No building in the city was left undamaged. In the surrounding towns, 15 houses collapsed, 66 had to be demolished later, 243 needed restoration and 669 had to be repaired. About 260 houses went unscathed. Four churches were destroyed, and 21 more were severely damaged. The city of Venice sustained minor damage, assessed as 6th degree on the Mercalli scale. Discovery of the effect of soil on damage severity In Ceneda, the seminary, the cathedral steeple and San Martino Castle were damaged or destroyed. The nearby town of Serravalle experienced little damage (only the partial collapse of the Turris Nigra, a tower), later explained by the different composition of the underlying soil by seismologists Torquato Taramelli and Giulio Andrea Pirona; the scientists discovered that Serravalle sat above a compact slab of limestone, while Ceneda, just a few kilometers away, rested on soil composed of alluvial conglomerates. This discovery was instrumental in developing the seismic macro-zoning process, a technique used to better assess the risk of damage from earthquakes. Relief efforts A public funding subscription was held in Vittorio Veneto, raising 2232,45 lire, while a provincial committee succeeded in raising 26.771,90 lire for the reconstruction. Vittorio Emanuele II, King of Italy, personally committed 1000 lire to the effort. Authorities reacted quickly to the disaster, asking for help from the Army and the Carabinieri in order to remove the rubble, set up tents and communications, and maintain order among the refugees. A wood shortage led to delays in the repairs of damaged buildings. In the following weeks, a military brigade was given the task of felling enough trees to meet the needs of reconstruction.

He is the co-founder and former leader of the English Defence League, and later served as a political advisor to former UKIP leader Gerard Batten. Robinson has been active in far-right politics for many years. He was a member of the neo- fascist and white nationalist British National Party (BNP) from 2004 to 2005. For a short time in 2012, he was joint vice-chairman of the British Freedom Party (BFP). Robinson led the EDL from 2009 until 8 October 2013. He continued as an activist, and in 2015 became involved with the development of Pegida UK, a now defunct British chapter of the German-based far-right organisation Pegida. From 2017 to 2018, Robinson wrote for and appeared in online videos for Rebel News, a Canadian far-right political website. Robinson's criminal record includes convictions for violence, financial and immigration frauds, drug possession and public order offences. He has been committed to prison for contempt of court. He has served at least four separate terms of imprisonment: in 2005 for assault, in 2012 for using false travel documents to enter the United States, in 2014 for mortgage fraud, and, in May 2018, Robinson was committed to prison for 13 months for contempt of court after publishing a Facebook Live video of defendants entering a law court, contravening a court order that disallows reporting on such trials while proceedings are ongoing. He served part of his sentence at HM Prison Hull in Kingston upon Hull before being transferred to HM Prison Onley in Warwickshire. On 1 August 2018, due to procedural errors, he was released on bail pending a new hearing of the case. On 5 July 2019, Robinson was again found guilty of contempt of court at the retrial and was committed at the Old Bailey to nine months in prison on 11 July․ Before his sentencing, Robinson appeared on InfoWars and appealed for political asylum in the United States. He was released from prison on 13 September 2019 after serving 9 weeks.Busby, Matta (September 13, 2019) \\"Tommy Robinson released from jail after nine weeks\\" The Guardian  Name  Robinson's birth name is Stephen Christopher Yaxley. The name Tommy Robinson is a pseudonym taken from a prominent member of the \\"Men In Gear\\" (MIG) football hooligan crew, which follows Luton Town Football Club. The nom de guerre successfully hid Robinson's identity as Stephen Yaxley-Lennon and his criminal history, until the connection was uncovered in July 2010 by Searchlight magazine.Lowles, Nick and Cressy, Simon (July 2010) \\"The BNP Past of the EDL Leader\\", Searchlight n.21, pp.4-5 Robinson has also used the names Andrew McMaster, Paul Harris, Wayne King, and Stephen Lennon.  Early life  Robinson was born Stephen Christopher Yaxley in Luton, England. In an interview with Victoria Derbyshire on BBC Radio Five live in 2010, he said that his parents \\"were Irish immigrants to this country\\". His mother, who worked at a local bakery, remarried when Robinson was still young; his stepfather, Thomas Lennon, worked at the Vauxhall car plant in Luton. According to Robinson, after leaving school he applied to study aircraft engineering at Luton Airport: \\"I got an apprenticeship 600 people applied for, and they took four people on.\\" He qualified in 2003 after five years of study, but then lost his job when he was convicted of assaulting an off-duty police officer in a drunken argument. He served a 12-month prison sentence. Robinson joined the British National Party, then led by Nick Griffin, in 2004. When questioned about this by journalist Andrew Neil in June 2013, he said that he had left after one year, saying, \\"I didn't know Nick Griffin was in the National Front, I didn't know non-whites couldn't join the organisation. I joined, I saw what it was about, it was not for me\\". Robinson was involved with the group United Peoples of Luton, formed in response to a March 2009 protest against Royal Anglian Regiment troops returning from the Afghan War being attacked by the Islamist groups Al-Muhajiroun and Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamaah.  English Defence League  EDL demonstrators in Amsterdam in 2010 Robinson founded the English Defence League (EDL) in 2009 with Kevin Carroll, Robinson's cousin, and became its leader with Carroll as deputy leader. Robinson stated that he had been prompted to found the EDL after he had read a newspaper article about local Islamists attempting to recruit men outside a bakery in Luton to fight for the Taliban in Afghanistan. Robinson has appeared masked at protests. Although Robinson repeatedly insisted from the early days of the organisation that the EDL was \\"against the rise of radical Islam\\" and that its members \\"aren't against Islam\\", its rank and file were noted for including football hooligans and members who described themselves as anti- Muslim. Robinson founded the European Defence League, a co-ordination of groups similar to the EDL operating in different European countries. Robinson's identity as Stephen Yaxley-Lennon was unmasked by Searchlight magazine in July 2010. Yaxley-Lennon's prior criminal history was thereby connected with Robinson. Robinson said he was assaulted on 22 December 2011 after stopping his car due to another car flashing its lights at him. He said that a group of three men attacked and beat him, until they were stopped by the arrival of a \\"good Samaritan\\". Robinson said that the attackers were of Asian appearance. Robinson was convicted in 2011 of using \\"threatening, abusive or insulting behaviour\\" during a fight between supporters of Luton Town and Newport County in Luton the previous year. Robinson reportedly led the group of Luton fans, and played an integral part in starting a 100-man brawl, during which he chanted \\"EDL till I die\\". He was sentenced to a 12-month community rehabilitation order with 150 hours' unpaid work and a three-year ban from attending football matches. Robinson was arrested again after an EDL demonstration in Tower Hamlets in September 2011 for breach of bail conditions, as he had been banned from attending that demonstration. Robinson later began a hunger strike while on remand in HM Prison Bedford, saying that he was a \\"political prisoner of the state\\", and refused to eat what he believed was halal meat. A handful of EDL supporters protested outside the prison in support of Robinson during his incarceration; the support peaked at a turnout of 100 protesters on 10 September. Robinson was released on bail on 12 September. On 29 September 2011, Robinson was convicted of common assault after headbutting a fellow EDL member at a rally in Blackburn in April that year. He was sentenced to 12 weeks' imprisonment, suspended for 12 months. On 8 November 2011, Robinson held a protest on the rooftop of the FIFA headquarters in Zürich against FIFA's ruling that the England national football team could not wear a Remembrance poppy symbol on their shirts. For this he was fined £3,000 and jailed for three days. In 2012 Robinson announced that he had joined the British Freedom Party (BFP). He was appointed its joint vice-chairman along with Carroll after the EDL and the BFP agreed an electoral pact in 2011. However, on 11 October 2012, Robinson resigned from the BFP to concentrate on EDL activities.  Leaving the EDL  In April 2012, Robinson took part in a programme in the BBC's television series The Big Questions in which far-right extremism was debated. Mo Ansar, a British Muslim political and social commentator, took part in the same programme, and invited Robinson to join him and his family for dinner. This resulted in several meetings over the next 18 months between Robinson and Ansar to discuss Islam, Islamism and the Muslim community, accompanied by a BBC team which created the documentary When Tommy Met Mo. On 8 October 2013, Quilliam held a press conference with Robinson and the EDL's deputy leader Kevin Carroll to announce that Robinson and Carroll had left the EDL. Robinson said that he had been considering leaving for a long time because of concerns over the \\"dangers of far-right extremism\\". Robinson said: \\"I acknowledge the dangers of far-right extremism and the ongoing need to counter Islamist ideology not with violence but with better, democratic ideas\\".Thomas Daigle, Free speech firebrand Tommy Robinson's contentious views on Islam spreading beyond U.K. CBC News, 28/30 September 2018 Ten other senior figures left the EDL with Robinson and Carroll, and Tim Ablitt became the EDL's new leader. When Robinson was questioned by The Guardian about having blamed \\"'every single Muslim' for 'getting away' with the 7 July bombings, and for calling Islam a fascist and violent religion, he held up his hands and said, 'I'm sorry, I'm sorry.'\\" Robinson also said that he would now give evidence to the police to help in their investigation of racists within the EDL. Robinson added that \\"his future work would involve taking on radicalism on all fronts\\". Robinson said in his autobiography that he was paid £2,000 per month for Quilliam to take credit for his leaving the EDL, which a Quilliam spokesperson denied.  Later activities  Robinson spoke at the Oxford Union on 26 November 2014. Unite Against Fascism (UAF) protested against his appearance, criticising the Union for allowing him the platform when, according to UAF, he had not renounced the views of the EDL. Robinson told the audience he was not allowed to talk about certain issues because he was out on prison licence. He said, \\"I regain my freedom of speech on the 22 July 2015.\\" He criticised \\"politicians, the media and police for failing to tackle certain criminal activities because of the fear of being labelled Islamophobic.\\" He said that Woodhill prison had become \\"an ISIS training camp\\", and that radicals were \\"running the wings\\". After release from licence at the end of his sentence, Robinson returned to anti- Islam demonstrations with Pegida UK, a British offshoot of Pegida, a German anti-immigration organisation founded in Dresden amid the European migrant crisis. Addressing a Pegida anti-Islam rally in October 2015, Robinson spoke out against what he perceived to be the threat of Islamist terrorists posing as refugees. He announced the creation of a \\"British chapter\\" of Pegida in December 2015. He said that alcohol and fighting would not be permitted because \\"It's too serious now for that stuff\\", and told The Daily Telegraph that a mass demonstration would take place across Europe on 6 February 2016. On 14 February 2016, Robinson was attacked and treated at a hospital after leaving a nightclub in Essex. Robinson wrote an autobiography, Enemy of the State, which was self-published in 2015. 18 March 2018, Robinson at Speakers' Corner Robinson travelled to watch UEFA Euro 2016 in France and demonstrated with a T-shirt and English flag ridiculing the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). Bedfordshire Police imposed a football banning order on him on his return; his solicitor Alison Gurden accused the police of equating the proscribed terrorist group with all Muslims in their action. In September, a judge at Luton Magistrates' Court dismissed the case, calling the prosecution's evidence \\"vague\\" and \\"cagey\\". On 27 August 2016, 18 Luton Town football supporters, including Robinson and his family, were ejected by police from a Cambridge pub on the day of the Cambridge United versus Luton football match. Robinson claimed he had been victimised, and complaints were submitted to Cambridge Police. In March 2019, at Peterborough County Court, Robinson accused Cambridgeshire Constabulary of harassment, direct discrimination, humiliation, stress, anxiety, and breach of human rights namely, the right to family life, right to freedom of conscience or religion and freedom of expression. The claims related to police behaviour around Robinson's possibly being issued a section 35 dispersal order at the pub after the match in 2016. The court rejected Robinson's claims and ordered him to pay £20,000 towards costs. Robinson said he would appeal against the ruling. Robinson was a correspondent for Rebel News, a Canadian far-right website. In May 2017, he was arrested for contempt of court after he attempted to take video of the defendants in an ongoing rape trial outside Canterbury Crown Court. Robinson's second self-published book, Mohammed's Koran: Why Muslims Kill For Islam was co-authored with Peter McLoughlin and released in 2017. Amazon has refused to sell it. Robinson was involved in a fist fight at Royal Ascot later in June 2017, for which Piers Morgan criticised him on Twitter. In March 2018, Robinson attended court in support of Mark Meechan, who had been charged for a hate crime after posting footage online of a dog performing Nazi salutes in response to the phrases \\"gas the Jews\\" and \\"Sieg Heil\\". Meechan was found guilty because the video was \\"antisemitic and racist in nature\\" and was aggravated by religious prejudice. Meechan said that the video was taken out of context and was a joke to annoy his girlfriend.  Actions relating to Finsbury Park terrorist attack  It was revealed in court that the perpetrator of London's 2017 Finsbury Park mosque terrorist attack received emails from Robinson and read Robinson's tweets in the lead-up to the attack. Robinson's tweet mocking people for responding to terrorism with the phrase \\"don't look back in anger\\" was found in the note at the scene of the attack. An email from Robinson's account to the attacker Darren Osborne shortly before read, \\"Dear Darren, you know about the terrible crimes committed against [name redacted] of Sunderland. Police let the suspects go… why? It is because the suspects are refugees from Syria and Iraq. It's a national outrage…\\" Another email read, \\"There is a nation within a nation forming just beneath the surface of the UK. It is a nation built on hatred, on violence and on Islam.\\" Robinson responded on Twitter to the Finsbury Park attack, writing, \\"The mosque where the attack happened tonight has a long history of creating terrorists & radical jihadists & promoting hate & segregation,\\" and, \\"I'm not justifying it, I've said many times if government or police don't sort these centres of hate they will create monsters as seen tonight.\\" Robinson's statements were widely criticised in the media as inciting hatred. Appearing the next morning on Good Morning Britain, Robinson held up the Quran and described it as a \\"violent and cursed book\\". The host, Piers Morgan, accused him of \\"stirring up hatred like a bigoted lunatic\\", and Robinson's appearance drew a number of complaints to Ofcom. Commander Dean Haydon of Scotland Yard's counter-terrorism command said that online material from Robinson had played a \\"significant role\\" in how Osborne was radicalised and \\"brainwashed\\". Mark Rowley, the outgoing Assistant Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police and the UK's most senior counter-terror officer said that there is \\"no doubt\\" that material posted online by people including Robinson drove the Finsbury Park terror attacker to targeting Muslims. In response, Robinson said \\"I'm gonna find Mark Rowley.\\"  Almondbury Community School assault and legal action against Robinson  After a Syrian refugee boy was assaulted in a school bullying incident in October 2018, Robinson falsely accused the victim of having previously attacked two schoolgirls. The 15-year-old refugee was dragged to the floor by his neck and told by his attacker, \\"I'll drown you\\", while water was forced into his mouth. The boy's arm was in a cast after it had been broken in a separate assault. His sister had also been assaulted. A 16-year-old boy believed to be the attacker, who was interviewed by police and given a court summons, had shared numerous social media posts by Robinson. On Facebook, Robinson subsequently posted a screenshot of a message from a mother saying her daughter had been bullied and he accused the refugee of being the bully. However, the mother responded on Robinson's Facebook page informing him this was false. Robinson also made a false allegation using a photo stolen from a news article on a teenage cancer patient. These events forced the refugee's family to relocate because \\"the level of abuse the children have received has become too much\\". The family decided to move elsewhere in West Yorkshire. Robinson may have breached court orders preventing the naming of the alleged perpetrator in several videos on Facebook and Instagram, including one that has been viewed more than 150,000 times. A lawyer said in doing so Robinson had \\"compounded\\" the refugee's suffering, adding \\"many people on social media having viewed Mr Yaxley-Lennon’s [Robinson's] lies believed them and expressed their outrage toward Jamal [the refugee].\\" In January 2019, the refugee said returning to Almondbury Community School was still too dangerous. He described living in fear after Robinson's postings because \\"there are people who hang around outside my house and video me on their phones. They call me 'little rat' if I go outside. One of my neighbours threatened me outside my house just yesterday.\\" His lawyers said Robinson's postings had made him \\"the focus of countless messages of hate and threats from the extreme right wing\\" and led to a police safety warning. After receiving a letter from lawyers representing the refugee boy's family, pointing out that the videos Robinson had posted \\"contain a number of false and defamatory allegations\\", Robinson admitted to his followers that it was fake news and claimed that he had been duped: \\"I have been completely had, how embarrassing man.\\" Robinson deleted the videos and admitted to posting a fake photograph purporting to show violence by a Muslim gang. He was warned about legal action for defamation. In response to allegations from Robinson's supporters that this warning \\"blocked\\" free speech, Jamil's lawyer said, \\"Tommy Robinson thinks it is a good idea to defame this 15-year-old boy and accuse him of being the author of his own bullying. It is actually sickening.\\" On 15 May 2019, Jamil's lawyer said that Jamil was suing Robinson for \\"defamatory comments\\" Robinson had made. It was reported that Facebook protects prominent figures such as Robinson from the normal rules of moderation that would usually see a page removed after posting content that violates its rules. Solicitors representing the victim are pursuing legal action against the social media firm on the basis Facebook was responsible for Robinson's posts as it had given him \\"special treatment [that] seems to be financially driven\\". However, on 26 February 2019, Facebook announced that it had banned Robinson from the service for violating Facebook community standards and \\"posting material that uses dehumanizing language and calls for violence targeted at Muslims\\". It also cited violations of policies concerning \\"organized hate\\".Hamilton, Isobel Asher (26 February 2019) \\"Facebook has banned far-right activist Tommy Robinson for spreading Islamophobia\\" Business Insider  Other social media activity  In March 2018, Robinson was permanently banned from the microblogging site Twitter for violating its rules on \\"hateful conduct\\". In January 2019, YouTube announced that it had removed adverts from Robinson's account, saying that he had breached the site's guidelines. In January 2019, Robinson livestreamed himself causing a lockdown, by leading a group that surrounded a library where the Glasgow South MP, Stewart McDonald, was holding a surgery. The group included the convicted armed kidnapper Daniel Thomas. The library was reportedly bombarded with phone calls. McDonald was eventually escorted away by police and he said the group blocked emergency exits. In February 2019, using his Facebook account, Robinson wrote \\"I guess it's ok to rape white women then?\\" next to a Rape Crisis flyer about specialist services for ethnic minority victims, resulting in hundreds of racist and abusive phone calls to the centre from Robinson's supporters. The centre, which was providing support for rape victims of all ethnic backgrounds, condemned Robinson's post for \\"disrupting much-needed service provision for victims and survivors of sexual violence and abuse of all ethnicities and backgrounds\\". The centre included specialised services for ethnic minorities because \\"some groups of women who have survived sexual violence and abuse can face additional barriers to accessing services, including related to language and to the fear and/or past or current experience of racism and racial discrimination\\". In February 2019, Facebook and Instagram banned him from their platforms citing violations of their hate speech rules including \\"calls for violence targeted at Muslims\\". On 4 March 2019, at 11pm, Robinson arrived uninvited outside the home of a journalist who covers far-right issues and attempted to intimidate him. Robinson revealed the journalist's address on a livestream and threatened to reveal the addresses of other journalists. He left after police arrived, but returned at 5am. Robinson said this was an act of retaliation for having been served a legal letter at his parents-in-law's home, an act which he said was videoed and which he described as harassment. Robinson gave no indication that the journalist he attempted to intimidate had been involved in that alleged act. The journalist said the letter had been given to a police officer 50 metres from the house in question. In April 2019, YouTube restricted Robinson's account due to its \\"borderline content\\", placing its content \\"behind an interstitial [warning page], removed from recommendations, and stripped of key features including livestreaming, comments, suggested videos, and likes\\". On 5 April 2019, Snapchat terminated Robinson's account for violating their community guidelines, which prohibit hate speech and harassment. In January 2020, Robinson was given the International Free Press award, also known as the Sappho Prize, described as an award given to journalists who combine excellence in their work with courage and a refusal to compromise. \\\\- \\\\- The International Free Press Society is closely connected to the counterjihad movement and Liz Fekete, the Executive Director of the Institute of Race Relations in Britain, has suggested that it is an instrument for pushing the boundaries of hate speech.  Political activities  From 2004 to 2005, Robinson was a member of the far-right British National Party (BNP). In September 2018, Robinson expressed a desire to join the UK Independence Party (UKIP). On 23 November 2018, UKIP leader Gerard Batten appointed Robinson as his own advisor. In response, the former UKIP leader Nigel Farage described Robinson as a \\"thug\\" and said he was heartbroken with the direction UKIP was going. Farage and a Welsh Assembly member called for Batten to be removed as leader. At a UKIP meeting on 30 November, Robinson sat with Daniel Thomas, a convicted kidnapper. Many prominent UKIP members, including eight of its MEPs, resigned from the party in response to Robinson's appointment. Of the eight MEPs who left, two were former party leaders. One was the UKIP's leader in Scotland; and another was Nigel Farage, who said Robinson and his associates brought \\"scuffles\\" and \\"violence\\" into the party and \\"many have criminal records, some pretty serious\\". UKIP's rules deny membership to those who have been part of extreme right-wing groups in the past: these preclude Robinson from joining, as he founded the English Defence League (EDL), had been a member of the British National Party, and has had ties with the British Freedom Party. UKIP's National Executive Committee considered waiving that clause for Robinson as a special case. If approved, his possible membership would be put to a vote at the party's conference. UKIP leader Batten supported Robinson joining the party, while UKIP Welsh Assembly members Michelle Brown and David Rowlands said they opposed it. On 25 April 2019, Robinson announced that he would be an independent candidate in the May 2019 European Parliament election in North West England. It was reported Anne Marie Waters, leader of the far-right For Britain party, promised Robinson the support of her party. Two people were hospitalised when Robinson campaigned as an MEP candidate in Warrington, Cheshire on 2 May. His security team and supporters physically attacked anti-racism activists, with one anti-racism activist saying she suffered a broken nose. Police launched an investigation into the violence. Robinson finished eighth in the election with 38,908 votes (2.2%), widely described as \\"humiliating\\" in the media, and losing his deposit.Halliday, Josh, Humiliated Tommy Robinson sneaks out of election count early, The Guardian, 27 May 2019. \\\\- Rothwell, James, Mixed fortunes for high-profile candidates as Tommy Robinson and Rachel Johnson lose out in EU elections, The Telegraph, 27 May 2019. He said he had faced a \\"near impossible task\\" in attempting to win a seat, as he was \\"unable to get across his message on social media platforms\\" after being banned by almost all such platforms. He subsequently demanded a second vote in an uploaded video.\\"Tommy Robinson demands a second EU Parliament vote in bizarre topless rant\\", The National, 27 May 2019 Prior to the 2019 United Kingdom general election, Robinson endorsed Conservative Party leader Boris Johnson as Prime Minister. Following the election, he announced he had joined the party. However, this was denied by a Conservative MP and by the Conservative Party nationally. Scram:, a website that campaigns against Robinson and other figures it sees as promoting far-right politics, has also debunked the claim.  Financial support  Robinson has received in excess of £2m in donations and sponsorship, much of it from foreign sources. In 2017, American billionaire Robert Shillman funded a paid fellowship at the rightwing Canadian website Rebel Media, with Robinson receiving over $6,000 (£5,000) per month. In 2018, Robinson received £2m in donations that were sought by opponents of his imprisonment. In July 2018, Middle East Forum, a US think tank that was described as \\"fomenting anti-Muslim sentiment\\", said it had been funding rallies in Robinson's support and paying legal costs in his appeal against his prison sentence. He also received funding from the rightwing group Yellow Vest Australia. For several months in late 2018, Robinson used Facebook's donations feature that was intended for charities to instead collect money for a new conspiracy theory website and to fund legal action against the British government in relation to his own prison treatment. Within hours of learning of the charity feature's misuse, Facebook removed the button from Robinson's page. In November 2018, PayPal told Robinson that it would no longer process payments on his behalf, saying that \\"Striking the necessary balance between upholding free expression and open dialogue and protecting principles of tolerance, diversity and respect for all people is a challenge that many companies are grappling with today.\\" Robinson described the decision as \\"fascism\\". The service said it cannot \\"be used to promote hate, violence, or other forms of intolerance that is discriminatory\\".  Contempt proceedings  On 10 May 2017, Robinson was charged with contempt of court. He had filmed inside Canterbury Crown Court and posted prejudicial statements calling the defendants \\"Muslim child rapists\\" while the jury was deliberating. Judge Heather Norton said Robinson used \\"pejorative language in his broadcast which prejudged the outcome of the case and could have had the effect of substantially derailing the trial\\". She added, \\"this is not about free speech, not about the freedom of the press, nor about legitimate journalism, and not about political correctness. It is about justice and ensuring that a trial can be carried out justly and fairly, it's about being innocent until proven guilty. It is about preserving the integrity of the jury to continue without people being intimidated or being affected by irresponsible and inaccurate 'reporting', if that's what it was\\". The court then wrongly stated that Robinson had been sentenced to three months' imprisonment, suspended for 18 months and entered that incorrect result in the court records. In law, he had been committed to prison for a period of three months but suspended that committal for eighteen months. That technical error, the distinction between committed to prison and sentenced to imprisonment was identified and corrected by the Court of Appeal. The incorrect result was reported in press accounts. The ramifications of this technical error came into effect in 2018 when the suspended prison sentence was activated. Robinson was again found to be in contempt of court at Leeds, again wrongly given a sentence of imprisonment and the Canterbury suspended sentence activated. Both sentences were for the offence of contempt of court, which can include speeches or publications that create a \\"substantial risk that the course of justice in the proceedings in question will be seriously impeded or prejudiced\\". He was later released following a successful challenge to the court's sentencing procedure. A rehearing was ordered.  2018 imprisonment  Robinson was jailed and later released in mid-2018 for almost collapsing the Huddersfield grooming gang trial. On 25 May 2018, Robinson was arrested for a breach of the peace while live streaming outside Leeds Crown Court during the trial of the Huddersfield grooming gang on which reporting restrictions had been ordered by the judge. Following Robinson's arrest, Judge Geoffrey Marson QC issued a further reporting restriction on Robinson's case, prohibiting any reporting of Robinson's case or the grooming trial until the latter case was complete. The reporting restriction with regard to Robinson was lifted on 29 May 2018, following a challenge by journalists. The media reported that Robinson had admitted contempt of court by publishing information that could prejudice an ongoing trial, and had been jailed for 13 months. Judge Marson sentenced Robinson to ten months for contempt of court and his previous three months' suspended sentence was activated because of the breach. Robinson's lawyer said that Robinson felt \\"deep regret\\" after comprehending the potential consequences of his behaviour. Having breached a temporary section 4 (2) order under the Contempt of Court Act 1981, Robinson was told that if a retrial had to be held as a result of his actions the cost could be \\"hundreds and hundreds of thousands of pounds\\". Dominic Casciani, the BBC's home affairs correspondent, said, \\"This is not some new form of censorship directed at Robinson. These are rules that apply to us all, equally. If he is unsure about that, he's now got time on his hands to read a copy of Essential Law for Journalists.\\"  Response of supporters  9 June 2018, Trafalgar Square: Protests for the release of Robinson The jailing of Robinson drew condemnation from right-wing circles. The UK Independence Party leader Gerard Batten MEP expressed concern about the proceedings and the ban on reporting. Robinson attracted sympathy from several right-wing politicians in Europe, including the Dutch Party for Freedom leader Geert Wilders and the member of the German Bundestag for the far-right Alternative for Germany Petr Bystron. On the weekends following Robinson's arrest, his supporters held rallies in his support. Demonstrators prevented a Muslim woman from driving a bus, performed Nazi salutes, threw scaffolding, glass bottles and street furniture at police and damaged vehicles and buildings. An online petition for his release had more than 500,000 signatures. Anti-fascist advocacy group Hope not Hate said its analysis showed that 68.1% of the signatures were from the UK, with 9.7% from Australia, and 9.3% from the US. Canada, Germany, France, New Zealand, Netherlands, Sweden and Ireland accounted for the remainder. In mid–June Robinson was transferred from HMP Hull to HMP Onley, the prison with the highest Muslim population (30.4%) in the Midlands. Caolan Robertson, then Robinson's cameraman, spread false information substantially exaggerating the Muslim population of a prison to which Robinson was moved. Robertson told the InfoWars conspiracy theorist Alex Jones that Robinson's new prison was \\"about 71 per cent Muslim\\" and therefore \\"really, really, really disastrous\\". The former Breitbart editor Raheem Kassam tweeted it to his followers while falsely accusing the Home Secretary, Sajid Javid, of moving Robinson there. A Robinson supporter was subsequently jailed for posing threatening and abusive messages aimed at Javid, relating to Robinson. In July 2018, Reuters reported that the United States Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom, Sam Brownback, lobbied the UK government on the treatment of Robinson. The Middle East Forum has also lobbied the United States government and provided financial aid for rallies and legal aid.  Appeal hearing  Robinson lodged an appeal initially against the proceedings at Leeds but much later against convictions both at Canterbury and Leeds. The Court of Appeal agreed to hear Robinson's appeal out of time because Robinson had been held in \\"effective solitary confinement\\", which had made it difficult for Robinson to have meetings with his lawyers. The matter came before the Lord Chief Justice and two others at the Court of Appeal on 18 July 2018. Robinson claimed that he had not admitted the charges at Leeds nor had he been given a chance to apologise. His lawyer claimed that his initial contempt hearing was flawed; the details of the charge were not clear. He argued that his sentence was unfair. The court issued its ruling on 1 August 2018. In essence, the appeal against the proceedings at Canterbury failed and the appeal in respect of the Leeds' proceedings succeeded. The court analysed the differences that arise from a prison sentence for a criminal offence and those from committal to prison for contempt. Of the mistakes made at Canterbury, the Court of Appeal learnt that those representing Robinson had been aware of the procedural errors. \\"It lies ill in the mouth of an appellant to complain of the failure of the court below to follow the appropriate procedural steps when that failure was fully appreciated at the time and remained deliberately uncorrected for tactical reasons and collateral advantage.\\" In respect of the Leeds contempt the court stated, \\"We are satisfied that the decision at Leeds Crown Court to proceed to committal to prison so promptly and without due regard for Part 48 of the Rules gave rise to unfairness. There was no clarity about what parts of the video were relied upon as amounting to contempt, what parts the appellant accepted through his counsel amounted to contempt and for what conduct he was sentenced.\\" It was ordered that the records of the Crown Court at Canterbury and at Leeds be amended to show that Robinson had been committed to prison for contempt of court, not sentenced to imprisonment. It was ordered the matter be reheard at the Old Bailey before the Recorder of London \\"as soon as reasonably possible.\\" Robinson was released on bail.  Aftermath of imprisonment  On 2 August 2018, Robinson was interviewed on Tucker Carlson Tonight. During the interview, Robinson mainly discussed his two months in prison. He said that he was initially put in HM Prison Hull, where he was treated well. He was then transferred to HM Prison Onley, where, he claimed, he was severely mistreated, including with solitary confinement. The prison service rejected his claims saying, \\"Mr Yaxley-Lennon [i.e. Robinson] was treated with the same fairness we aim to show all prisoners – he had access to visits, television and showers – and it is totally false to say he was held in 'solitary confinement, adding that he had been kept in a care and separation unit for 48 hours whilst an assessment was made of his safety. In October 2018, further controversy arose after Robinson posted a joint photo with two dozen young British Army \\"recruits\\" as he described them. He also posted on his Facebook page a video of the occasion in which the soldiers allegedly cheered him shouting his name. The British Army launched an investigation into the matter, saying, \\"Far-right ideology is completely at odds with the values and ethos of the armed forces. The armed forces have robust measures in place to ensure those exhibiting extremist views are neither tolerated nor permitted to serve.\\" The Government's lead counter- extremism commissioner praised the army's response, saying, \\"This is typical of the far right. They manipulate and exploit their way into the mainstream, often targeting the military and co-opting its symbols. Tommy Robinson's attention-seeking is cover for divisive anti-Muslim hatred that is causing real harm to individuals, communities and society in general.\\" Reporting restrictions were lifted on the three Huddersfield grooming gang trials after the jury reached a verdict in the final trial. The Yorkshire Evening Post explained that it abided by the temporary restrictions because \\"If we had reported on the first trial then jurors may have been swayed in the second trial – a defence lawyer would argue that their clients could not get a fair hearing ... the whole trial could have collapsed ... a judge may have had to rule that they could not get a fair trial and those girls would NEVER have seen the men brought to justice\\". Also in October 2018, U.S. Republican Party congressman Paul Gosar and six other members of congress invited Robinson to speak at a private meeting at the U.S. Congress on 14 November 2018. The trip was to be sponsored by the Middle East Forum, which said it had provided Robinson with legal funds since his imprisonment. Robinson was not granted a visa for the trip. On 23 February 2019 Robinson held a rally in MediaCityUK outside BBC's Salford, Greater Manchester offices to protest against BBC's investigative current affairs programme Panorama and its presenter John Sweeney. During the rally, Robinson launched his film Panodrama that was broadcast on a large screen to the protesters estimated to be 4000 people, showing undercover footage of Sweeney, filmed by Robinson's former aide Lucy Brown. UKIP leader Gerard Batten spoke in support during the rally. Robinson said the aim of the protest was to make a stand \\"against the corrupt media\\" and called for the BBC licence fee to be scrapped. Concurrently, about 500 people attended a counter-protest by anti-fascists. In response, the BBC made an announcement that it strongly rejects any suggestion that its journalism is biased. Confirming that an upcoming Panorama episode was being prepared to investigate Robinson and his activities, it added that all programmes the BBC broadcasts follow BBC's \\"strict editorial guidelines\\". Regarding some of Sweeney's remarks during Robinson's Panodrama film exposé, the BBC announcement added: \\"Some of the footage which has been released was recorded without our knowledge during this investigation and John Sweeney made some offensive and inappropriate remarks, for which he apologises.\\" Robinson announced his plans to stand as an MEP in the 2019 European Union parliamentary elections on 23 May, for the north-west of England European Parliament constituency. Running as an independent, Robinson submitted all necessary documentation and paid the £5,000 deposit to be a candidate in the elections. Soon after announcing his run, Twitter suspended his newly- established electoral campaign account, after it was reported as a new account creation by a banned user. Robinson received only 2.2% of the vote and lost his deposit as a result.  New trial  Following court hearings on 27 September and 23 October, the case was referred to the Attorney General, Geoffrey Cox QC MP. Judge Nicholas Hilliard said the matter was so complex it needed further consideration, adding \\"all the evidence must be rigorously tested\\". The referral would allow witnesses to be cross-examined. In March 2019, the attorney general decided that it was in the public interest to bring further proceedings against Robinson. A contempt conviction had been quashed by the court of appeal in August 2018 \\"over procedural failings\\" and Robinson had been freed on bail pending new proceedings at the Old Bailey. But Nicholas Hilliard, the Recorder of London had referred the case to the attorney general in October 2018 for further investigation. Cox acted on the referral and after further studies for five months, he decided to raise further proceedings against Robinson. He said about his action, \\"After carefully considering the details of this case, I have concluded there are strong grounds to bring fresh contempt of court proceedings against Stephen Yaxley-Lennon.\\" He added, \\"As proceedings are now underway, it would not be appropriate to comment further and I remind everyone that it is an offence to comment on live court cases.\\" The first hearing in this renewed case was due to take place at the High Court in London on 22 March 2019. Robinson reacted by alleging that this new procedure by the attorney general is part of \\"an ongoing state persecution of a journalist [Robinson], who exposes the [UK] government and establishment and all of their wrongs.\\" Robinson could be sent to jail if he is found in contempt in this new trial. The preliminary hearing was later postponed \\"until sometime after 3 May\\". On 5 July 2019, Robinson was again found guilty of contempt of court at the retrial on three different grounds, including breaching the reporting restriction. Defence lawyers at the trial he was livestreaming from had applied for the jury to be discharged on the basis of having been prejudiced, within days of his video, which could have collapsed the trial, arguing: > It is inconceivable when you have 3.5 million hits on the internet that this > information has not come to the attention of this jury. It is inconceivable > that the jury have not been spoken to by others, whether they themselves > were looking for the information matters or not. Three days before his scheduled sentencing on 11 July, Robinson appeared on The Alex Jones Show on the right-wing conspiracy channel Info Wars to appeal for political asylum in the United States, saying: > I feel like I’m two days away from being sentenced to death in the U.K. for > journalism. Today, I am calling on the help of Donald Trump, his > administration and the Republican Party to grant me and my family political > asylum in the United States of America. ... I beg Donald Trump, I beg the > American government, to look at my case. I need evacuation from this country > because dark forces are at work. ... This is a direct appeal on behalf of my > family – we love the United States, I have no future here [in Britain]. The > country has fallen. Robinson claimed that British jails are controlled by jihadi gangs and he would be killed while in prison. Although Robinson has in the past been refused entry to the US, and was jailed in 2012 for using a friend's passport to enter the country, in October 2018 he was invited by Congressional Republicans to speak in Washington, but could not obtain a visa in time. President Trump's ambassador for international religious freedom, the former Senator Sam Brownback raised the issue of Robinson's imprisonment with the British government in 2018, and the president's son, Donald Trump Jr. has in the past tweeted in Robinson's support.Dearden, Lizzie (8 July 2019) \\"Tommy Robinson: EDL founder begs Trump to grant him political asylum in US\\" The IndependentWise, Justin (9 July 2019) \\"Far-right anti-Muslim UK activist Tommy Robinson begs Trump to grant him asylum after conviction\\" The Hill On 11 July Robinson was jailed for nine months at the Old Bailey. He described the sentence as an \\"absolute joke\\" and called for protests. Outside the court, some of his supporters booed and a crowd marched towards the building chanting \\"we want Tommy out\\"; some began pelting police with bottles and cans.\\"Tommy Robinson jailed for contempt of court\\", BBC News, 11 July 2019 Because Robinson had already served 69 days in prison, he would be required to serve about another ten weeks.Carpani, Jessica and Bird, Steve, \\"Tommy Robinson jailed for nine months for contempt of court over social media video\\" The Daily Telegraph, 11 July 2019. On 13 September 2019, Robinson was released from prison after serving nine weeks. Several days later, he said that he had spoken to Julian Assange in prison, and announced that he supported him.Dearden, Lizzie (16 September 2019) \\"Tommy Robinson announces support for Julian Assange after ‘talking to WikiLeaks founder in prison’\\" The Independent  Personal life  Robinson married in 2011 and is the father of three children. He managed a tanning salon in Luton.  Previous criminal convictions  Robinson's criminal record also includes convictions for violence, financial and immigration frauds, drug possession, and public order offences. He had previously served at least three separate custodial sentences: in 2005 for assault, in 2012 for using false travel documents, and in 2014 for mortgage fraud.  Assault  In April 2005 at Luton Crown Court, Robinson was convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and assault with intent to resist arrest against an off-duty police officer in July 2004. The officer had intervened in an argument in the street between Robinson and his then girlfriend, Jenna Vowles. In the struggle that followed, Robinson kicked the officer in the head as he laid on the ground. Robinson received sentences of 12 months and 3 months, which were served concurrently. In September 2011, at Preston Magistrates' Court, Robinson was convicted of assault for headbutting a man in Blackburn on 2 April 2011. In November 2011, he was given a 12-week jail term, suspended for 12 months.  Public order offence  In July 2011, at Luton and South Bedfordshire Magistrates' Court, Robinson was convicted of using threatening, abusive or insulting behaviour, for leading a group of Luton Town F.C. supporters into a brawl involving 100 people in Luton on 24 August 2010. He was sentenced to a 12-month community rehabilitation order, 150 hours of unpaid work and given a three-year football banning order.  False passport  In October 2012, Robinson was arrested and held on the charge of having entered the United States illegally. Robinson pleaded guilty at Southwark Crown Court to using someone else's passport to travel to the United States in September 2012, and was sentenced in January 2013 to 10 months' imprisonment. Robinson had used a passport in the name of Andrew McMaster to board a Virgin Atlantic flight from Heathrow to New York. He had been banned from entering the US due to his criminal record. When he arrived at New York's JFK Airport, customs officials who took his fingerprints realised he was not McMaster. He was asked to attend a second interview but left the airport, entering the US illegally. He stayed one night and returned to the UK the following day using his own legitimate passport – which bears the name Paul Harris. Judge Alistair McCreath told him: \\"What you did went absolutely to the heart of the immigration controls that the United States are entitled to have. It's not in any sense trivial.\\" He was released on electronic tag on 22 February 2013.  Fraud  In November 2012, Robinson was charged with three counts of conspiracy to commit fraud by misrepresentation in relation to a mortgage application, along with five other defendants. He pleaded guilty to two charges and in January 2014 was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment. Robinson's fraud amounted to £160,000 over a period of six months. Judge Andrew Bright QC described him as the \\"instigator, if not the architect\\" of a series of frauds totalling £640,000. \\"This was an operation which was fraudulent from the outset and involved a significant amount of forward planning.\\" He described Robinson as a \\"fixer\\" who had introduced others to fraudulent mortgage broker Deborah Rothschild. Rothschild had assisted some defendants by providing fake pay slips and income details. Robinson was attacked by several fellow prisoners in HM Prison Woodhill. Following news of the attack, Maajid Nawaz wrote to the Secretary of State for Justice, Chris Grayling, asking for Robinson's situation to be urgently addressed. Shortly after this incident, Robinson was moved to HM Prison Winchester. Robinson told Jamie Bartlett, a director of the think tank Demos: \\"In Woodhill, I experienced Islam the gang. [...] In Winchester, I have experienced Islam the religion.\\" Robinson made friends with several Muslim prisoners, referring to them as \\"great lads [...] I cannot speak highly enough of the Muslim inmates I'm now living with\\". In June 2014, Robinson was released on licence. The terms of his early release included having no contact with the EDL until the end of his original sentence in June 2015. He was due to talk to the Oxford Union in October 2014, but was recalled to prison before the event for breaching the terms of his licence. He was ultimately released on 14 November 2014.

Baroque Architecture of Cajamarca Andean Baroque (Spanish: Barroco andino or arquitectura mestiza) is an artistic movement that appeared in colonial Peru between 1680 and 1780. It is located geographically between Arequipa and Lake Titicaca in what is now Peru and Bolivia, where rules over the highlands and spreads over the entire altiplano. From the Portuguese word barrueco meaning impure, mottled, flamboyant, daring, the most striking example of Andean Baroque art is in religious architecture, where criollo and indigenous craftsmen together gave it a unique character, as happened in the New Spanish Baroque. Origin The first of the Baroque architecture in the Viceroyalty of Peru in 1630 and developed on the Spanish model until the late 17th century. From 1690 differences appear in some regions. Decorative elements The originality of this style lies in the varied decoration, and whose motives respond to four basic types: * tropical flora and fauna * Manneristic motifs as sirens, masks, etc. * American motifs: sun, moon, mountain lions, etc. * Pre-Renaissance Christian elements The mermaid appears in the churches bordering the Lake Titicaca and although it is an item from the classical antiquity, remember the Indigenous tradition of two fishes women who seduced the god Tunupa. Regional variants Arequipa San Juan Bautista Church in Yanahuara District. In Arequipa, the key building of mestizo architecture is the church of la Compañía by the architect Gaspar Báez built in 1578. Quito Baroque The extension of the Quito Baroque cover the territories of the former Royal Audiencia of Quito in Spanish colonial times. Especially the Altiplano of Quito and the Andes from Pasto in Colombia to Cajamarca in Peru. Represented in the arts called \\"Quito School\\" which was characterized by a high proportion of indigenous Kichwas representations. Interior of the Church of la Compañía de Jesús, Quito Features that characterize the indigenous roots in Andean Quito art are: *There is a \\"quiteanization\\" of the characters, many have mixed features and local attire *Indigenous ancestral customs often appear; *The scenes are located in the ambiance of the Andean landscape, its cities, its architecture; *There is a presence of local wildlife (llamas instead of horses and camels, guinea pig in place of the Paschal Lamb, monkeys, opossums, tapirs, cats, along with classic sheep of the shepherds, etc..), And native flora is found in garlands, embroidery, inlays, silver, carvings, etc..) as well as the adoption of vernacular plant replacing the traditional iconography of European; in sculpture and painting are present characters and customs characteristic of the environment; the executor of the work art is the local craftsman of ancient artistic tradition itself, there is an adoption of \\"naturalization\\" of European saints, for example, Poland's San Jacinto is called San Jacinto of Yaguachi. Baroque architecture in Quito stands the Church of San Francisco, the compañía de Jesús, the Cathedral of Quito, among others. Churches of the Colca Valley In the province of Cailloma is the valley of Collaguas evangelized by the Franciscans, highlights several Catholic churches located in the towns of Yanque (Church of the Immaculate Conception of Yanque) Coporaque, Cabanaconde, Chivay, Madrigal and Silvayo. Lake Titicaca and El Collao The indigenous groups that inhabit the region are the Kollas and Lupacas in present Peruvian territory and Omasuyos and pacajes on Bolivian. All were subject to the Mita de Potosí and periodically migrated to the valleys and coastal lowlands. The Baroque of Arequipa and Potosí is a conjunction in this region with a strong Pre- Columbian flavor. The Puno Cathedral picks iconographic elements as mermaids, pumas, papayas and a monkey and even the charango. Lake Titicaca was named in honor of the puma, Titi, in Aymara, because of its shape. In the region of lupacas rise the three groups of baroque churches: Juli, Pomata and Zepita. Juli has been the great Jesuit missionary center of the altiplano, had four churches: San Juan de Letrán, Santa Cruz de Jerusalén, Nuestra Señora de la Asunción and San Pedro Mártir. The Dominicans possessed the Pomata Sanctuary where they venerate Our Lady of the Rosary, the most famous of this region after the Basilica of Our Lady of Copacabana who was in charge of the Augustinians. The church of St. James of Pomata marks the culmination of the mestizo style. Gallery File:Church of la Compañía, Cuzco.jpg|Iglesia de la Compañía de Jesús, Cusco. File:Juli. San Juan de Latrán.

He was the youngest out of five children, three boys and two girls, Charles Edgar Corea, James Alfred Ernest Corea, Agnes Corea and Evangeline Corea. This family was acknowledged to be one of the wealthiest families in the whole of Ceylon. Victor's family was severely affected when Charles Edward Bandaranaike Corea died in 1872, leaving five children, of whom the youngest, Victor Corea, was only one year old. The five young children depended on their young, widowed 21-year-old mother to look after them. He attended the prestigious S. Thomas' College, Mount Lavinia, where he excelled in his studies. Politics Victor Corea, together with his brother C.E.Corea, were members of the Legislative Council of Ceylon. Victor Corea contested a seat in 1924 against E.W.Jayawardene and won. The Legislative Council held their meetings here, it is now called the Republic Building in Colombo. After leaving school, Victor Corea entered politics, like most of the men in the Corea family. His father also was in the legal profession, being a proctor as well as his brother Charles Edgar Corea who was a very successful proctor and a member of the legislative council. He became an advocate of the Supreme Court and in September 1922 he was elected founder president of the Ceylon Labour Union which was led by A. E. Goonesinha. During the 1920s he was active in the Ceylon Labour Party. He successfully abolished Poll Tax and after this he became one of the most popular men in Chilaw. He then contested a seat in 1924 for the legislative council, he ran against E. W. Jayawardene and won comfortably. The Coreas and the Jayawardene family are related through marriage. Victor was elected a founder member of the Ceylon National Congress. According to the Asia Times, 'During the period 1915 to 1928, members of the Ceylon National Congress, in combination with various political groups, devoted their attention to reforming the political administrative structure of the island. Their principal demands were related to the manner in which the electoral constituencies should take shape, the composition of the Legislative Council and extension of its powers and the composition and the role of the Executive Council and proposals regarding the franchise. Improvements of the local government administration and the \\"Ceylonization\\" of the public services were also presented, but received lesser emphasis. In December 1919 the Ceylon National Congress adopted the following resolutions: \\"The congress declares that, for the better government of the island and the happiness and contentment of the people, and as a step towards the realisation of responsible government in Ceylon as an integral part of the British Empire, the constitution and administration of Ceylon should be immediately reformed in the following particulars, to wit: 'That the Legislative Council should consist of about 50 members, of whom at least four-fifths should be elected on the basis of a territorial electorate, upon a wide male franchise and a restricted female franchise, and the remaining one-fifth should consist of official members and of unofficial members to represent important minorities, and the council should elect its own speaker.'\\". Victor Corea's brother, Charles Edgar Corea was elected president of the Ceylon National Congress in 1924. Sri Lankan author Kumari Jayawardena, writing about the Coreas observed: 'Unconnected to the liquor trade but making their money on plantation ventures was the Corea Family of Chilaw, an influential goyigama group with a history going back to Portuguese rule when they were warriors to Sinhala kings. During Dutch and British rule, members of the family were officials serving the state in various ways and rewarded with titles. Some members of the family took to the legal and medical professions, most notably the sons of Charles Edward Corea (a solicitor), who were active in local politics and in the Chilaw Association which campaigned against British land policies – especially the Waste Lands Ordinance, and for political reforms. The most active of Corea's sons was C.E.(Charles Edgar) who spoke up for peasant rights and was militant in his stand against the government. He was President of the Ceylon National Congress in 1924. C.E. Corea's brother, Alfred Ernest, was a doctor and the youngest Victor Corea was a lawyer who achieved fame for leading a campaign (and going to jail) in 1922 to protest the Poll Tax on all males; he was the first President of the Ceylon Labour Union led by A.E.Goonesinha and was active in the Ceylon Labour Party. While being professionals and political activists, the Coreas were also important landowners. Freedom fighter C.E.Corea and Victor Corea were fearless freedom fighters from the west coast town of Chilaw, in Sri Lanka. They campaigned long and hard through the Chilaw Association for the independence of Sri Lanka from British rule. In 2008 the people of Chilaw erected a statue in the town, in honour of Victor Corea. As well as being a successful Advocate and politician, Victor Corea also spent much of his time fighting for Sri Lanka's independence against the British or against anyone or anything where there wasn't justice. He fought fearlessly with the help of his older brother Charles Edgar Corea and became two of the most famous Political figures their country had ever seen, and were particularly well known in their hometown Chilaw. They were respected people and in Jaffna they were acclaimed as outstanding leaders. in 1921 Victor Corea refused to pay Poll Tax. Every male who was over the age of 21 in Ceylon had to pay this and it would go to the British Government. Victor wrote to the governor and said that according to their law he should be arrested. Victor Corea was then arrested and put in prison. He suffered much pain by doing work in a very hot climate such as crushing metal, beating coconut husks and twisting rope. All this work was done where the public could see him. He continued to do this work even though he had to go through a lot of pain. The British realised that Victor had become a national hero. Many people came from all over the country to see a man of high standing fight for his people and for the independence of Ceylon. The British released him from prison and also abolished Poll Tax, they had realised by keeping him in prison he had gained a lot of fame and popularity. Victor Corea then addressed his supporters at the Tower Hall, this was shortly after his release. The Times of Ceylon wrote this article: \\"The Tower Hall in Maradana was the scene of an electrifying drama. But Annie Boteju and Marshall Perera were not the star attractions. The occasion was a political meeting. It was the climax of a day of national mourning in remembrance of the declaration of Martial Law on 4 June 1915. As this story unfolds, the Speaker on the platform is C.E. Victor S.Corea. \\"June 4, 1922 was a Sunday and the thousands who packed the Tower Hall and its environs exploded in an orgasm of applause. The Times of Ceylon, always a faithful barometer of the political climate, recorded the next day that the Tower Hall was packed to utmost capacity. On the verandahs outside, a tightly wedged mass of humanity surged to and fro, a large number remaining on the street outside.\\" \\"Such was the magnetic attraction of C.E. Victor S. Corea that the police party present was led by the Acting Inspector General of Police himself.\\" Mohandas Gandhi's visit in 1927 Mohandas K. Gandhi, the 'Father of India', visited Chilaw in Sri Lanka in 1927 on the invitation of C.E. Corea and Victor Corea, founders of the Chilaw Association and the Ceylon National Congress. Gandhi was close to the Corea Family, he stayed in a Corea home called 'Sigiriya,' during his first and only visit to the island.. Victor Corea and his brother Charles Edgar Corea had been in touch with Mohandas K. Gandhi. In 1927 Gandhi visited Ceylon because of his contact with the Corea family. He travelled the whole country visiting people of different backgrounds and religion. Mahatma Gandhi travelled to Chilaw and stayed for a few days with the Corea Family in a home situated in the town, called 'Sigiriya', it was the home of Victor's sister Agnes Corea. Gandhi presented a poster to Victor Corea, as a recognition of his bravery against the British. According to the Sunday Observer newspaper of Sri Lanka: 'When Mahatma Gandhi came to Ceylon he visited Chilaw to attend a banquet that was hosted by the Coreas at \\"Sigiriya\\" the house that belonged to Victor Corea's sister and husband. Here, Mahatma Gandhi presented a colour poster under the headline Fighters for Swaraj that featured all the national heroes of India each in oval shaped bust size photographs to Victor Corea as his photograph too was included in the poster amongst the political giants of India. This alone was a glowing tribute to the campaign for freedom, initiated by Victor Corea that was somewhat similar to the campaign conducted in India. ' Beating of the hewisi at the Dalada Maligawa The British Government Agent in Kandy had ordered the Diyawadana Nilame to stop the beating of the hewisi drums in the morning at the 'Dalada Maligawa', the sacred Temple of the Tooth, as it was disturbing his sleep. Victor Corea defied the order and suggested the Government Agent change his residence. The GA revoked the order. When the beating of hewisi at the Dalada Maligawa was stopped on the orders of the Government Agent who was a Britisher, it was Victor Corea who single handedly defied the order and threatened to beat the hewisi himself if the Diyawadana Nilame did not order the temple to resume the beating of the hewisi. Victor Corea told the GA in no uncertain terms that he should change his residence if the noise is disturbing his household instead of changing religious traditions that have been coming down from the time of the Sinhalese Kings. Since Victor Corea was known to be a man who lived up to his word, the GA fearing a revolt, revoked the order. Family life Victor Corea had six sons: Carlton Corea, (a Civil Servant), Norman Corea, (a well known Sri Lankan musician), Siddhartha Corea, (a Homeopathic Doctor and pioneer of Homeopathy on the island), Eric, Charles (Charlie) Corea (who worked for the Insurance Corporation of Sri Lanka), Sri Sangabo Corea, (a pioneer in the field of advertising in Sri Lanka) and a daughter, Sara. His grand children went on the play pivotal roles on the national and international stages among them: Dr. Gamani Corea, Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and Assistant Secretary-General of the United Nations, Sri Sangabo Corea, a pioneer in the field of advertising in Sri Lanka and the media personality Dr. Vijaya Corea who was appointed Director-General of the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation and Patron of the Edirimanne Corea Family Union in Colombo. Death Victor Corea died on 6 June 1962 at 91 years old. He will be remembered for his bravery and his battle with the British for independence. He will also be remembered for getting the Poll Tax abolished and being a brilliant Advocate. Statue  The statue of Victor Corea in Chilaw. A plaque detailing the heroic exploits of Sri Lankan national hero, Victor Corea. On 2 December 2008, the people of Chilaw paid tribute to Victor by having a statue built in his hometown. The statue was sculptured by Kalasoori Ariyawansa Weerakkody. Ancestry Victor Corea was a direct descendant of King Dominicus Corea also known as Edirille Rala, who was given the Kingdoms of Kotte and Sitawaka by King Vimala Dharma Suriya, the King of Kandy, in 1596. King Dominicus Corea, like his descendant Victor Corea, fought for and against the Portuguese, who had colonised Ceylon.

About three were built. Design and development The Cramcraft was a single-seat primary glider trainer, aimed at newcomers to the sport and designed with simplicity, robustness and low cost in mind rather than aerodynamic performance. It was a wooden aircraft with wings of rectangular planform built around two box spars which, like the ribs, were made from spruce and plywood. Ailerons reached to the wing tips but no airbrakes were fitted. The tail surfaces were carried on a narrow, flat boom formed by two parallel beams from the wing leading edge, braced together and fabric covered. Both the boom-mounted tailplane and elevators it carried were rectangular in plan, though the latter had a cutout for rudder movement and extended beyond the tailplane. The rudder was mounted on a very narrow fin and initially extended further below the boom than above but was later modified so that little projected below and the upper profile became more rounded. Initially the pilot's seat was mounted well below the wing leading edge on the narrow edge of a board or plank. The under edge of this board was shaped to curve up forwards and served as a skid. The board was fixed to the wing spars by two pairs of parallel V-form lift struts, the angle between them being unusually small. This arrangement left the pilot completely exposed and a later version placed him in a short nacelle. Both wings and tail were further wire braced, with lift wires from the fuselage and above from a pair of inverted V-struts mounted on the two boom beams. Operational history The first serious testing was on 5 October 1930. Several pilots flew the Cramcraft, though no flights of more than 30 seconds were achieved that day. It is probable that three Cramcrafts were built, at least one of them flying with the Newcastle gliding club and another with the Sunderland club, both near to Cramlington.

Being non- autonomous, MITEs cannot code for their own transposase. They exist within the genomes of animals, plants, fungi and bacteria. MITEs are generally short (50 to 500 bp) elements with terminal inverted repeats (TIRs; 10–15 bp) and two flanking target site duplications (TSDs). Like other transposons, MITEs are inserted predominantly in gene-rich regions and this can be a reason that they affect gene expression and play important roles in accelerating eukaryotic evolution. Their high copy number in spite of small sizes has been a topic of interest.  Origin of MITEs  A detailed study of MITEs reveals that MITE subfamilies have arisen from related autonomous elements from a single genome and these subfamilies constitute the MITE families. One type of autonomous element can give rise to one or more MITE families.  Classification  Based on their relations in sequences of TIRs with known TE superfamilies, MITEs have been classified into certain families. For example, wTourist, Acrobat, Hearthealer are MITE families in some plant species are under the TE superfamily PIF/Harbinger. Stowaway is a MITE family in Pisum sativum L. with TSD TA in relation with Tc1/mariner TE superfamily. A group of MITEs known as CMITES related to Piggybac superfamily were found in certain coral species. While most of the MITEs are grouped, some of them are yet to be allotted their TE superfamilies. Such families include AtATE in Arabidopsis thaliana and ATon family found in Aedes aegypti. Besides this, many more MITE families are likely to be discovered.  MITEs in Plant Genomes  MITEs were first discovered in plants. Elements belonging to the CACTA, hAT, Mutator, PIF, and Tc1/Mariner superfamilies have been described. Depending upon the similarity of their terminal inverted repeats and target site duplications, most of the MITEs in plant genomes are divided into two major groups: Tourist-like MITEs (derived from PIF) and Stowaway-like MITEs (derived from Tc1/mariner).Stowaway and Tourist elements differ remarkably in their sequences but they have been found to have significant structural similarities. Stowaway elements possess target site specificity, have small size and conserved terminal inverted repeat. So is the case determined in Tourist like MITEs. They can form stable DNA secondary structures which can be very useful in identifying them. A few Stowaway elements also contain cis-acting regulatory domains. Other MITE superfamilies have also been described in plants, such as hAT-type MITEs in banana and the nightshades.  MITEs as Genetic Markers  Based on the presence or absence of MITE family Heartbreaker (Hbr) in maize genome, a molecular marker was developed. These Hbr markers have been proved to be stable, uniformly distributed in maize genome. A study by Casa et al. showed that HBr markers could be used along with other molecular markers to study genotype of related maize inbred lines  Computational Assistance  Software like FINDMITE use sequence entries of some average sized bp to identify MITE families. A MATLAB-based program called detectMITE can detect MITEs on genome wide scale and was tested on rice genome. Others like MUST and MITE-Hunter are also used for similar purposes. To characterize MITE families a toolkit has been developed called MITE Analysis Kit MAK by Yang and Hall.

Education and early career  In 1991, following service in the KGB Border Troops from 1985–87, Borodin graduated in International Economics and Finance from the International Economics Department at the Moscow Finance Institute. From 1989 to 1990 he was a visiting student at the University of Passau, Germany. He worked for Dresdner Bank in Germany - which has deep ties to former members of the KGB and Stasi services \\\\- on an 18-month training course in Dortmund. He then moved to Frankfurt to work at the bank’s head office in the Financial Institutions Department. He left Dresdner Bank in late 1993 and in March 1994 started working for the Government of Moscow as an economics and finance adviser to the Mayor of Moscow, Yury Luzhkov. His relationships with Luzhkov, currently persona non grata in Russia since his dismissal by Dmitry Medvedev in 2010, have been important for both his rise and current problems.  Bank of Moscow What became one of the biggest players in Russian banking began as a six-person operation founded in 1995 by the Moscow City Government, which originally held a 51% stake. Under the political patronage of Luzhkov and the leadership of Borodin it weathered the crisis of 1998 and subsequently grew rapidly from a local bank largely serving the City Government to a national bank with a greatly enlarged client base and offering a broad range of services. The bank became increasingly independent of the City Government, which in 2008 reduced its stake to 46.6%, with a corresponding reduction in the number of bank-appointed directors. As the bank expanded, Borodin and his ally Lev Alaluev purchased significant stakes of their own – more than 20.32%. There was no evidence on how Borodin and Alaluev got the necessary funding for such a big purchase.Borodin sells up Bank of Moscow stake - The Moscow News The hand of Moscow - \\"Itogi\\" Bank of Moscow enjoyed the confidence of the international markets, with both Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse acquiring small stakes in 2010 (3.88% and 2.77% respectively). Takeover When Luzhkov was dismissed in September 2010, the new mayor Sergei Sobyanin announced the intention to sell the stake of the Moscow government in Bank of Moscow. VTB, a state-controlled bank, stepped up as a buyer. Other banks, such as Alfa Bank and Bank Austria, a subsidiary of UniCredit, also expressed interest. In December 2010, before the sale of the City Government's stake took place, the Audit Chamber of the Russian Federation announced that it had launched an audit of Bank of Moscow at Sobyanin's request. The investigation revealed a loan provided by the bank to Premier Estate Company. At the end of February 2011 VTB purchased the City Government's stake from Central Fuel Company. The VTB deal was opposed by Borodin. He resisted to attempts by VTB to acquire control of the bank, already being one of the main shareholders.Bank of Moscow allots most of 2010 profit to reserves - Reuters Borodin has contested the legality of this on a number of grounds, including that competitive tender ought to have been used to maximise the share price. None of the protests were found correct or justified by court. Borodin and his allies were dismissed and VTB's Chairman Andrey Kostin and first deputy Mikhail Kuzovlev became the Bank’s Chairman of the Board of Directors and President respectively. In early April 2011 Borodin and Lev Alaluyev sold their 20.32% stake in Bank of Moscow. Andrey Borodin sold his shares to Vitaly Yusufov, son of the former Russian Energy Minister Igor Yusufov. Vitaly Yusufov had borrowed US$1.1 billion from Bank of Moscow for this acquisition. Borodin was still in charge of the bank, when this decision was made.Bank of Moscow bailout sequence may change – official - Reuters News Borodin stated that he was forced to accept a price below fair market value because of strong pressure exerted on him and claimed that Yusufov was acting on behalf of President Medvedev, who ordered a \\"politically\\" motivated takeover of the Bank of Moscow.

VTB Group 6M\`2012 IFRS Results Presentation Yusufov claimed, that he acted on his own judgment. That was the reason, why the price negotiations with VTB took so long. Bank of Moscow taken over on Medvedev's instructions-former president - RIA NovostiYusufov sells 19.9 pct stake in Bank of Moscow to VTB - RIA Novosti Borodin claims that peculiarities during the takeover point to the centrality of political as opposed to commercial concerns. For example, he made an offer on 22 March 2011, which lapsed 8 April 2011, to buy the stake from VTB as the same price they had, despite VTB's claims of the mess they had discovered. This was refused, because there was no official offer sent. Bail-out and criminal charges After the takeover, VTB and finance minister Alexei Kudrin (who was the head of Supervisory Council of VTB during the takeover) announced that the bank's former management, led by Andrei Borodin, created a \\"large, special portfolio loan book\\" totaling 366 billion roubles to lend to itself and related parties. Among these loans, some 250 billion roubles has been identified as falling in a \\"zone of risk\\", and 150 out of 250 billion were 'very bad' and lacked collateral.Russia Gives Bank $14 Billion Bailout - Wall Street Journal In July 2011 it was announced that Bank of Moscow would receive a US$14 billion bail-out from the Russian state. In February 2012 Russia's Interior Ministry has opened a new criminal case against Borodin and Dmitry Akulinin, over the theft of 6.7 billion roubles at the Bank. According to the investigator, Borodin and Akulinin, in 2008 through 2011, using their office position, arranged the transfer of at least 7.8 billion roubles from a correspondent account of the Bank of Moscow to the accounts of commercial companies registered in Cyprus. None of the firms involved in the criminal scheme engaged in any financial or economic activity. The settlement accounts of the fly-by-night firms were serviced by a Cyprus bank.Former Bank of Moscow Heads Face New $220 Mln Theft Charge - RIA Novosti In March 2012 Investigative Committee spokesman Vladimir Markin told the new the case over a 1.7 billion- rouble damage caused to the Bank of Moscow is investigated. The Bank of Moscow and the Moscow government held a controlling stake in “City Insurance Group”. Fearing the loss of control over the company's activities and transfer of 50 percent plus one share to the VTB bank, former president and vice-president of Bank of Moscow Andrei Borodin and Dmitry Akulinin worked out a criminal scheme in which they involved subordinates from the administrations of affiliates. As a result of transactions with the securities from October 2010 through March 2011, the control over City Insurance Group passed to an offshore company, which caused a 1,708,635,380-rouble damage to the Bank of Moscow and its affiliates.Charges brought against Bank of Moscow subsidiaries management - RAPSI In October 2012 Russian investigators froze Borodin's assets, over $400 million, held in bank accounts in Switzerland, Belgium, Luxembourg.

The auditors discovered that all loan agreements signed during that period had no conclusions from the bank’s credit risk department, which means the department never analysed the potential borrowers’ financial status. In addition, in some cases the collaterals used to secure the loans were not evaluated at their market value.

London: Routledge, 2012. . is a British psychoanalyst and writer. He is a leading figure in contemporary psychoanalytic theory.Elliott, Anthony (2004). Subject to Ourselves: Social Theory, Psychoanalysis and Postmodernity. 2nd edition. London: Routledge. . p. 103. Early life and education Bollas was born in the United States in Washington, DC. He grew up in Laguna Beach, California, and later graduated in history from UC Berkeley in 1967. As an undergraduate Bollas studied intellectual history with Carl Schorske, and psychoanalytical anthropology with Alan Dundes. From 1967–69 he trained in child counselling at the East Bay Activity Center in Oakland, California and from 1969–73 he was the first graduate of the Program in Adult Psychotherapy at the University of Buffalo. At the University of Buffalo he earned a PhD in English Literature and studied with Norman Holland, Leslie Fiedler, Murray Schwartz, Michel Foucault, René Girard and with the Heideggerian psychoanalyst Heinz Lichtenstein. While at Smith College, to earn an MSW, he visited the Austen Riggs Center (where he was to become Director of Education a decade later) and met Erik Erikson who became a mentor early on in his career and was to be of singular influence for the next twenty years. He qualified in psychoanalysis at the Institute of Psychoanalysis in London in 1977 and in Adult Psychotherapy from the Tavistock Clinic in 1978. Those teachers and figures whom he knew and who helped diversify his thinking were Arnold Modell, John Bowlby, André Green, Herbert Rosenfeld, Joseph J. Sandler, J.-B. Pontalis, Janine Chasseguet-Smirgel, Marion Milner, Nina Coltart, and Paula Heimann. Career Bollas was a Professor of English at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in the middle 1980s. Concordant with his career in literary and cultural studies, Bollas has worked as a psychotherapist since 1967, launching his clinical career with autistic and schizophrenic children. He was the first Honorary Non Medical Consultant at the London Clinic of Psychoanalysis, Visiting Professor in Psychoanalysis at the Istituto di Neuropsichiatria Infantile of the University of Rome from 1978 to 1998, Director of Education at the Austen Riggs Center from 1985–1988 and one of the literary editors of the works of D.W. Winnicott. He became a British citizen in 2010. Contributions Bollas is most widely known for his psychoanalytical writings and some of his ideas have had a wide dissemination; indeed, he is one of the most widely read authors in the field of psychoanalysis.Lear, Jonathan (11 March 2010). \\"Sharing Secrets\\" (preview only; subscription required). Review of Christopher Bollas, The Evocative Object World; and The Infinite Question. London Review of Books. Vol. 32, no. 5, pp. 34-35; here: p. 34. His theory of \\"the unthought known\\"Mogenson, Gregory (2003). The Dove in the Consulting Room: Hysteria and Anima in Bollas and Jung. Brunner-Routledge. . p.19.Campbell, J.; Harbord, J. (1998). Psycho- politics and cultural desires. Taylor & Francis. . p. 208.—that as infants we are informed by many ideas conveyed through action rather than thinking that become part of our unconscious—has been of particular significance, although other concepts \\"the transformational object\\", \\"violent innocence\\", \\"extractive introjection\\", \\"psychic genera and the receptive unconscious\\" and \\"human idiom\\" have been widely influential in the clinical field. Free association In the middle 1990s in Being A Character (1992) and Cracking Up (1995) Bollas turned back to Freud's early writing—especially The Interpretation of Dreams—and argued that Freud's writing implicitly assumed a theory of unconscious perception, organisation, and creativity that Bollas integrated and used in his own radical return to Freud, arguing that psychoanalysis is primarily efficacious due to entirely unconscious processes of change. In the 21st century, in Free Association, The Evocative Object World and The Infinite Question, Bollas revived Freud's marginalised theory of free association providing evidence of how and in what ways all people think associatively, revealing—as Freud argued—through the \\"chain of ideas\\", or simply how the way people move from one topic to another reveals unconscious processes of thought. In 2010 the journalist Or Ezrati, writing in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, remarked: \\"Some people see Christopher Bollas as one of the two most important living theoreticians in the world of psychoanalysis\\".Ezrati, Or (5 April 2010). \\"The Dream Underlying All Dreams\\". Haaaretz. haaretz.com. Retrieved 9 July 2017. The other theoretician he highlights is Thomas Ogden. Idiom needs In Being a Character, Bollas also argued that everybody had their own idiom for life—a blend between the psychic organisation which from birth forms the self's core, and the implied logic of the familial way of relating into which we are then raised.Elliott, p. 104. As adults, Bollas considered we spend our time looking for objects of interest—human or material—which can serve to enhance our particular idioms or styles of life—perpetually \\"meeting idiom needs by securing evocatively nourishing objects\\".Bollas, quoted in Adam Phillips, On Flirtation (London 1996) p. 156\\\\. . Being willing to risk exposure to such transformational objects was for Bollas an essential part of a healthy life: the readiness to be metamorphosed by one's interaction with the object world.Elliott, p. 149. The contrast was a refusal of development and self-invention, of open- endedness: the state of psychic stagnation. Bollas saw in what he called the anti-narcissist a willed refusal to use objects for the development of his/her own idiom, and a consequent foreclosure of the true self.Symington, Neville (1993). Narcissism: A New Theory. London: Karnac Books. p. 113\\\\. The result can lead to what Adam Phillips called \\"the core catastrophe in many of Bollas's powerful clinical vignettes... being trapped in someone else's (usually the parents') dream or view of the world\\".Phillips, p. 158. Bollas was however well aware of the converse danger of expecting too much from the role of the transformational object, especially as found within the transference.Patrick Casement, Further Learning from the Patient (1997), p. 110. . In popular culture Aside from his clinical writings, Bollas is also a cultural critic and his writings have earned the interests of people outside the world of psychoanalysis.Hunt, Ian, The Unthought Known, Frieze Magazine, Issue 68. He has also written three comic novels: Dark at the End of the Tunnel, I Have Heard the Mermaids Singing and Mayhem - and five plays. An American television sitcom, Cracking Up, derived its title from Bollas' book of that title and included a main character, \\"Dr Bollas\\", played by Henry Gibson. Bollas is also the only psychoanalyst mentioned in the first series of HBO's In Treatment.

The player controls the Cosmic Wartoad as he attempts to rescue the queen.

Jan Sergěj Ingr (2 September 1894 – 17 June 1956) was a Czechoslovak Army four star general and the Minister of National Defense in the Czechoslovak government-in-exile during the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. Early life Ingr was born in Vlkoš in the Margraviate of Moravia (present-day Czech Republic) in 1894 to his father Jan, mayor of the municipality. He had four brothers and three sisters. He was studying on the gymnasium in Kyjov and in 1913 he became a member of the cadet school in Královo Pole. First World War After the outbreak of the First World War he went as a Sergeant to Eastern Front. In fall of 1915 he was captured by Russians in Caricyn.

Life He began life as a barber near Drury Lane. In 1722 he was at Norwich, perhaps to establish a textile business. Later he dealt in Irish linen, and established a business at a large house on Pall Mall. Between 1734 and 1746 he made visits to Ireland in order to extend his connections; but the business did not prove profitable. In January 1746 he decided to give it up, and on 11 October 1746 he settled with his family in Dublin as treasurer and deputy- manager to Thomas Sheridan at the Smock Alley Theatre. The theatre for some years was fairly successful; but about 1753 Sheridan was at variance with a portion of the theatre-going public, and for two years Victor and John Sowdon, a principal actor in the company, took over its management. On 15 July 1755 Sheridan returned to Dublin, and Victor resumed his old position. Eventually the theatre was closed on 20 April 1759, and Victor returned to England. Shortly after his return to England Victor obtained the post of treasurer of Drury Lane Theatre, which he retained until his death. Victor died at his lodgings in Charles Street, Covent Garden, London, on 3 December 1778. He was married before 1738; his first wife died late in 1757, and by 1759 he had married again. Benjamin Victor's second marriage was to Penelope Wolseley, the illegitimate daughter of Sir William Wolseley and the actress, Christiana Horton. Works In 1722, after he had been introduced to Richard Steele by Aaron Hill, he wrote ‘An Epistle to Sir Richard Steele’ (two editions, 1722), in which he defended Steele's play The Conscious Lovers against attacks of John Dennis. In 1728 he was introduced to Barton Booth, and his ‘Memoirs of the Life of Barton Booth, published by an intimate acquaintance,’ 1733, is a source for the actor's career. After the arrival of Frederick Louis, Prince of Wales, in England in December 1728, Victor presented to him, through Lord Malpas, a congratulatory poem, and had hopes of obtaining a place in the prince's household; but was disappointed. Next year he composed a satire called ‘The Levée Haunter,’ which met with the approbation of Sir Robert Walpole. From 1746 Victor wrote the birthday odes for the court of Dublin, and Lionel Sackville, 1st Duke of Dorset, when resigning the position of lord lieutenant in 1755, obtained permission to put Victor's name, as poet laureate of Ireland, on the viceregal establishment. Several of these odes are in his collections of 1776, and two were printed separately. In 1755 Victor, who seems to have known Sir William Wolseley, 5th Baronet, the fifth baronet, of Staffordshire, published an anonymous narrative entitled ‘The Widow of the Wood;’ it was republished at Glasgow in 1769. It was so offensive to members of the Wolseley family that they are said to have destroyed every copy of the book that they could. In 1761 he published, in two volumes, a ‘History of the Theatres of London and Dublin from 1730, with an Annual Register of all Plays performed at the Theatres Royal in London from 1712,’ and in 1771 he published a third volume, bringing the narrative down to that date. The second volume contains information on the lives of the chief actors from about 1710 to 1745. Walley Chamberlain Oulton compiled in 1796 a continuation in two volumes, bringing the record down to 1795; and in 1818, in three more volumes, he carried it on to 1817. Victor published in 1776, with a dedication to David Garrick, three volumes of ‘Original Letters, Dramatic Pieces, and Poems.’ The first volume preserved some anecdotes, especially on Sir Richard Steele, and the second volume contained Victor's plays—‘Altamira,’ a tragedy; ‘Fatal Error,’ a tragedy; ‘The Fortunate Peasant,’ a comedy; and ‘The Sacrifice, or Cupid's Vagaries,’ a masque—all of which were unacted. Victor also produced an adaptation of The Two Gentlemen of Verona, which was given five times at Drury Lane in 1763.

About 26 were built, serving with the Yugoslav Royal Air Force until the fall of Yugoslavia in 1941. After that, 11 R-100s were used by the newly formed Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia, sometimes as ground attack aircraft, and one R-100 was used by the Italian Regia Aeronautica. Design and development The Prva Srpska Fabrika Aeroplana Živojin Rogožarski A.D. was the first Serbian aircraft manufacturer in Yugoslavia, founded in 1924. In about 1938 they designed the Rogožarski R-100, a training aircraft with a single open cockpit in an oval wooden monocoque fuselage, a successor to their Rogožarski PVT. It came from the design team of Prof. Sima Milutinović. Its wooden, fabric-covered wings were slightly swept and parasol- mounted above the fuselage, attached with lift struts to the lower fuselage and with a central inverted-V Cabane strut. Its ailerons were full-span, narrow-chord, fabric-covered metal-structure units, with prominent spades above the wing's upper surface. The R-100 was powered by a 420 hp (313 kW) 7-cylinder radial IAM K-7 license-built version of the Gnome-Rhône 7K radial engine, driving a two-bladed propeller. The engine mounting incorporated an NACA cowling. The forward fuselage was metal-covered from the engine to the 158-liter fuselage-mounted fuel tank, after which the fuselage was fabric- covered. The fixed, divided type undercarriage had a main shock absorber leg, its upper end attached to a steel attachment near the mid-fuselage, allowing the wheel to remain nearly vertical during deflections, whilst providing a wide track. The wheels were connected to the lower fuselage with a swinging V-strut. A steerable tailwheel was used. The fixed members of the empennage were fabric-covered wooden structures; the moveable portions were fabric- covered metal structures. Operational history The R-100 prototype probably first flew in 1938, piloted by Miloš Gagić. An initial production batch of 15 aircraft was delivered to the YRAF during 1939. The first R-100 units were immediately sent to Niš for the fighter-pilot training use. Another 10 were delivered during 1939-40, with fixed 7.7 mm (0.303 in) Darne machine guns and photo gun (camera). These planes were designed for fighter-pilot training in Bela Crkva. Aircraft R-100 were used extensively before the war for pilot training.Петровић, Огњан М. (March 2004). \\"Војни аероплани Краљевине СХС/Југославије (Део II: 1931–1941)\\".

At the time of the Italo-German invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, the Italians seized one R-100, the Germans took another eleven; the remaining aircraft were destroyed. The Germans gave their captured R-100s to their Croatian allies, who used them for training during the rest of the war. In the initial period the R-100s were used for pilot training, and later were fitted with mountings for a 90–100 kg bomb, and were used for bombing. Several R-100s were used to patrol the outskirts of Zagreb, to repel the attacks of partisan aircraft. The last combat flight of an R-100 was on 26 April 1945. Two R-100s were given to the partisan faction at the end of the war, and two were seized at the Lucko airport near Zagreb during the liberation. All four planes that survived the war are included in the Yugoslav Army Air Force (JRV). One each was used by the 111th and 112 Fighting regiment, the third was used in the VTC (Aeronautic Technical Center) and the fourth was used by the commander of 4th bomber division. The JRV planes remained in use until the 1950s, after which they were retired. A partial R-100 is in the Museum of Aviation at Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport.

The young Jerry O'Connell, Devoreaux White and Sarah Jessica Parker all have small supporting roles. The film aired as a Hallmark Hall of Fame presentation on CBS on January 31, 1987 and was later distributed on DVD. Plot Leah Lazenby (Stockard Channing) is a single woman who lives in a house she recently inherited from her parents. In order to save money, maintaining her inheritance, she lets rooms to a variety of tenants while she sleeps in her parents' parlour. Leah works in a school for children who are characterized by a learning disability or even antisocial personality disorder. A cellist named Travis Coles (Sam Waterston) visits to inquire about the upstairs room to let. He can easily pay in advance and is immediately accepted. Travis fits in very well. He flatters Leah when she's plumbing, helps the other tenants, takes photographs of Leah and her pupils, drives her around in his car, and guards her when she is assaulted by her tenant Kevin (Clancy Brown). Consequently, Leah turns to Travis when she needs to bring Kevin's wife Ellie (Joan Allen) to a hospital. Ellie had just tried to commit suicide because the Kevin had betrayed and eventually left her. Leah's head teacher (Linda Hunt) assigns her to look after an unruly illiterate teenage girl named Susan (Renée Estevez), who refuses to attend school. Susan lives with her boyfriend. Leah visits her regularly and tries to teach her to read by using fashion magazines. She even includes Susan's boyfriend, but when she thinks Susan opens up to her, the girl plays a cruel trick on Leah, causing Leah to lose her patience and start a physical fight with Susan in public. As the police arrive, Susan falsely accuses her of having assaulted her with a broken bottle and Leah leaves. Returning home Leah sees Travis repairing the sink and tells him off. Travis answers back by explaining to her she mustn't believe she was the only person who is hurt and she should be more interested in Ellie's problems. Leah then talks to Ellie and they become friends. Head teacher Mrs. Sanders convinces Leah not to quit her job as a teacher and offers her a different task. While Travis is on a concert tour in Canada, Leah's tenant Mandy (Sarah Jessica Parker) gives birth to a baby. There is a big celebration in Leah's house and Travis can manage to visit during a break of the tour. Travis and Leah have a moment together. Leah tells him about her new case, a deafblind child. Having his shoulder to lean on she falls asleep. While she rests Travis inducts Leah into the tragedy of his life. He once had a child who died unexpectedly while he was on tour, his wife blaming him for having neglected his family. The next morning they awake together, obviously feeling very comfortable. Leah's brother Frank (James Handy) is angry with her because the house is returning a puny profit although she's now also her tenant Mandy's babysitter. Even so, she refuses her brother's offer to buy her out. Travis takes Leah to one of his concerts. When they return home she invites him to her room where she has prepared a meal for them. Finally they kiss.

Chatta Deva who reigned from 980-1031 CE founded the dynasty. He helped Western Chalukyas in the coup against the Rashtrakutas; re-established the Kadamba Dynasty mostly as a feudatory of Western Chalukyas, but his successors enjoyed considerable independence and were almost sovereign rulers of Goa and Konkan till 14th century CE. The successors of Chatta Deva occupied both Banavasi and Hangal and are known as Kadambas of Hangal. Uniting Banavasi and Hangal, distinguished himself against the Cholas and carved out a kingdom (which stretched, on this side, including Ratnagiri district, up to Kolhapur). He is referred to as having conquered Konkan. When the Chalukyas under their king, Jayasimha II made an advance on Dhar (capital of the Malavas) and defeated Bhoja, who was then the Paramara king, the part played by Chaltadev (Chatta Deva), the feudatory of the Chalukyas, was significant. During 1075-1116 Kirtivarma subdued the 7 Konkans. Due to the struggle between the Hoysalas and the Yadavas, for supremacy, the Kadambas of Hangal under Kamdeva marched against the Konkan and compelled Vijayadatta (to transfer his allegiance to him). But during 1187 and 1188, immediately on his accession, Jayakesi III declared himself independent. Later Kadambas kept paying nominal allegiance to Yadavas and Hoysalas of Dorasamudra and thus maintained their independence. Different families of Kadambas ruled southern India, notable were Kadambas of Hangal, Kadambas of Goa, Kadambas of Halasi and Kadambas of Banavasi.

Minor Kadamba Kingdoms The Kadambas of Banavasi declined by sixth century, by the tenth century Kadamba were local chiefs, the Kadamba of Hangal emerged as a vassal of the Western Chalukyas, and the Kadambas of Goa at Goa and Konkan until the fourteenth century. Similarly some more minor Kadamba branches established, they remained vassals. Kadambas of Bankapur They served as regional governors for Kadambas of Banavasi and then Kadambas of Hangal. Kadambas of Bayalnad After the fall of the Western Gangas, the Kadambas of Bayalnad established as independent kingdom. It was founded by Kaviyammarasa, who ruled towards end of 10th century CE. Kadambas of Nagarkhanda Kadambas of Nagarkhanda descendants of Mayuravarma of Hangal, served as regional governors, Nagarkhanda is the district to the north-east of Banavasi. They titled as boon lords of Banavasipura, their capital was at Bandhavapura. Initially the Kadambas of Hangal refused to acknowledge suzerainty of Kalachuris of Kalyani, that led to war between them, then Kalachuris helped Somadeva as per the 1159 inscription Somadeva subordinate of Kalachuris, they conquered Banavasi and handed it over to Somadeva (in 1165). Kadambas of Uchchangi The Kadambas of Uchchangi were in name only kings of Banavasi actually the power remain with Kadambas of Hangal. Coinage of Hangal Kadambas Kadambas coins were one the heaviest and perhaps purest of all medieval Indian gold coinage. Kadambas issued 2 types of gold coins, namely Punch-marked gold coins and Die struck gold coins. During 1075-1094 CE, Shanti Varma, issued gold punch marked coin and in 1065 CE, Toyimadeva, issued die struck gold coins (Pagoda).

The UK Albums Chart is a music chart that calculates the best-selling artist albums of the week in the United Kingdom. For the purposes of inclusion in the chart an album is defined by the Official Charts Company (OCC) as being a type of music release that features more than four tracks and lasts longer than 25 minutes. At the beginning of the 1990s, sales of singles and albums in the United Kingdom were compiled on behalf of the British music industry by Gallup. This continued until 1994, when the contract to compile the UK charts was won by Millward Brown, who took over on 1 February 1994. On 1 July 1998 Chart Information Network (CIN) took over the management of the chart: CIN changed their name to the Official UK Charts Company in October 2001, later shortened to the Official Charts Company in 2008. Unlike other decades, no decade-end charts for the 1990s for either singles or albums were broadcast on BBC Radio 1 at the end of 1999, and no detailed lists were published in the UK music trade magazine Music Week. Gallup's sales figures were not made available to its successors, and Millward Brown's sales data from 1994 to 1996 were later substantially revised. This made it difficult to obtain accurate sales figures for the decade. Two weeks before the end of the decade Music Week published lists of the top twenty best-selling singles and albums of the 1990s in the UK: this is the only known list of the best-selling albums of the 1990s officially produced by CIN/OCC. The top twenty lists included sales figures, but the subsequent revisions of the data have made the original 1999 figures unreliable, and consequently they have been omitted from the table below. The biggest-selling album of the 1990s was (What's the Story) Morning Glory? by the British band Oasis. Released in October 1995, the album was the second biggest-selling album of both 1995 and 1996. In second place was Stars by Simply Red, which had achieved the distinction of being the best-selling album in consecutive calendar years (1991 and 1992), the first album to achieve this feat since Bridge over Troubled Water by Simon & Garfunkel, in 1970 and 1971. In third place was Spice by the Spice Girls, which spent 15 weeks at number-one, more than any album during the 90s. The best-selling compilation was The Immaculate Collection, the first greatest hits album by the American singer/songwriter Madonna: the top twenty included six other greatest hits compilations.

He was security correspondent for CBC News and a former bureau chief of CBC Radio's Moscow bureau. As a foreign correspondent, Gillespie reported extensively from Afghanistan, Iraq, Chechnya and the Russian Caucuses, relaying information on the fall of the Taliban, the dismantling of Saddam Hussein's statue in Baghdad's central square, and the deadly siege of Beslan School Number One. Early life Born in Melfort, Saskatchewan, Gillespie attained a master's degree in labour history from Memorial University of Newfoundland. While at Memorial, he was the editor of the student newspaper The Muse. Accessed 2013-05-28. Career CBC Gillespie spent the first 12 years of his CBC career in St. John's, Newfoundland, reporting for both radio and television. In 1989, he joined CBC's Parliamentary Bureau as a reporter, producer and occasional host of the national CBC Radio News weekly political affairs show, The House. Gillespie then spent the next five years in Toronto as a national radio reporter for CBC Radio, where he covered the rise of the Harris government, environmental issues and the Krever Inquiry into tainted blood. During this period, Gillespie won several awards for his coverage of the environment and homelessness. Between 2005 and his retirement from the CBC in 2011, Gillespie was the CBC's Security Correspondent. He reported extensively on Canada's intelligence agencies, the Air India Inquiry, the Toronto 18 and Canadian Omar Khadr, and Guantanamo Bay. During this time, Gillespie also contributed various stories to the NPR radio syndicator and the C-SPAN television network. In 2011, he was accused of defaming Canadian Jewish group the Jewish Defence League of Canada (JDL) after describing them as terrorists on-air. Later, he and CBC editor Esther Enkin apologised and clarified that Gillespie was quoting the Canadian government. Recently, Gillespie spoke on behalf of the Canadian Media Guild in Ottawa, in an effort to highlight the importance of journalistic freedom from government interference, opposing plans to allow government involvement in negotiating contracts between the CBC and its employees. Foreign correspondent Gillespie's career as a foreign correspondent was launched with a posting to Moscow in 2001. Since September 11, 2001, he reported extensively from Afghanistan. He was in Afghanistan when the first American bombs began to fall, and he followed the Northern Alliance army as it removed the Taliban from power. Gillespie also conducted the first interviews with Canadian soldiers returning from combat. In Moscow, Gillespie reported on Russia's struggle to shed its Soviet past and become a European-style democracy. Central to these stories was Vladimir Putin and the Putin-inspired transformation of Russian - U.S. relations. Other stories chronicled Putin's less successful attempts to change the Russian bureaucracy's Soviet mind-set. Labour Activist and Film Maker Since leaving the CBC Gillespie has begun a new career as a labour activist. He is currently coordinating a campaign by a coalition of labour and public interest groups known as the Trade Justice Network, aimed at generating more media coverage of the possible negative consequences of Trans Pacific Partnership free trade pact now under negotiation. In 2013, Gillespie wrote, produced and narrated the influential short documentary \\"Made in the USA\\", which investigated the potential impact of Ontario PC leader Tim Hudak's policy proposal to introduce American style, anti-union right-to-work laws to Canada. Labour leaders in Ontario have credited the film for playing a significant role in convincing Mr. Hudak to suddenly reverse himself and drop the policy. As a result of the film Mr. Gillespie was awarded the 2013 Min Sook Lee Award for Labour Activists by the Mayworks Festival. In May 2014, \\"Made in the USA\\" was screened at the Workers Unite! film festival in New York. Gillespie followed \\"Made in the USA\\" with a sequel released in May 2014, called \\"Hudak's Plan B\\", an exploration of how Wisconsin governor Scott Walker neutered the state's public sector unions without a right-to-work law. In June, 2014 Gillespie followed with Epic Fail: A Short History of Privatization in Ontario documenting 20 years of failed government privatizations from the deadly Walkerton Water catastrophe to the contracting out of snow clearing and hospital construction to private companies. Gillespie was also a consulting producer and writer on the documentary Change Your Name Ousama!, which explored how 9/11 impacted Canadian Muslims. Author Gillespie is the author of a book entitled, A Class Act: An Illustrated History of the Labour Movement in Newfoundland and Labrador. Gillespie is currently working on new edition of \\"A Class Act\\". The new release will coincide with the Newfoundland and Labrador Federation of Labour's 80th anniversary in 2016. Awards Gillespie has won several awards over the course of his career. Among them, the New York Festivals Award, an Amnesty International Award and a National Science Award. In 2011, Gillespie and colleagues were nominated for the Canadian Association of Journalists 2010 award, for the story \\"Pakistan International Airline Threat\\", which aired on CBC News' The National.  Family  Gillespie's son Alex Gillespie was killed by a Toronto Transit Commission bus in 2010. Gillespie and Kathryn Wright and Alex's siblings took out a $2m lawsuit against TTC and Toronto Police Services.

It can cause complications such as vision impairment due to intracranial pressure (VIIP), permanent neurological problems, reversible neurological problems, seizures, stroke, and death. However, aside from a few Level I trauma centers, ICP monitoring is rarely a part of the clinical management of patients with these conditions. The infrequency of ICP can be attributed to the invasive nature of the standard monitoring methods (which require insertion of an ICP sensor into the brain ventricle or parenchymal tissue). Additional risks presented to patients can include high costs associated with an ICP sensor's implantation procedure, and the limited access to trained personnel, e.g. a neurosurgeon. Alternative, non-invasive measurement of intracranial pressure, non-invasive methods for estimating ICP have, as a result, been sought.  Correlation-based approaches  Many approaches to non-invasive ICP estimation are based on the idea that something in the human head's anatomical structure or in the intracranial and extracranial physiology correlates with ICP. \\"Correlation-based\\" approaches can reflect factors associated with ICP only with limited accuracy (expressed by systematic error) and precision (expressed by the standard deviation of random error). Measuring absolute ICP value is limited by the need for individual patient-specific calibration. Absolute ICP values in mmHg or other units are needed to determine the correct patient treatment. The only accurate, precise, and patient-specific, calibration-free, non-invasive, absolute ICP value measurement method relies not on the correlation, but on direct ICP and extracranial pressure comparison principle.  Two depth transorbital doppler (TDTD)  An innovative method using a two-depth transorbital doppler (TDTD) of intracranial pressure quantitative absolute (ICP) value measurement relies on the same fundamental principle that is used to measure blood pressure with a sphygmomanometer. A sphygmomanometer works using a pressure balance principle - an air-filled pressure cuff wrapped around the arm compresses the brachial artery to a point where blood can no longer flow. Externally applied pressure is equal to systolic blood pressure in this case. The examiner slowly releases the air from the cuff and uses a stethoscope to listen for the return of blood flow. At the pressure balance point, where the pressure in the cuff equals systolic artery pressure, a ‘whooshing’ noise can be heard as blood flows through the artery again. Pressure balance based a non-invasive blood pressure meter does not need a patient-specific calibration. The TDTD method uses Doppler ultrasound to translate the pressure balance principle of blood pressure measurement with a sphygmomanometer to the measurement of ICP. The ophthalmic artery (OA), a unique vessel with intracranial and extracranial segments, is used as a pressure sensor and as a natural pair of scales for absolute ICP value in mmHg or mmH2O measurement. Blood flow in the intracranial OA segment is affected by intracranial pressure, while flow in the extracranial (intraorbital) OA segment is influenced by the externally applied pressure (Pe) to the eyeball and orbital tissues. As with a sphygmomanometer, a special pressure cuff is used - in this case, to compress the tissues surrounding the eyeball and also intraorbital tissues surrounding the extracranial segment of OA. External pressure changes the characteristics of blood flowing from inside the skull cavity into the eye socket. In place of the stethoscope, a Doppler ultrasound beam measures the blood flow pulsations in intracranial and extracranial segments of the ophthalmic artery. The non- invasive ICP meter based on this method gradually increases the pressure over the eyeball and intraorbital tissues so that the blood flow pulsation parameters in two sections of the OA are equal. At this pressure balance point, the applied external pressure (Pe) equals the intracranial pressure (ICP). This measurement method eliminates the main limiting problem of all other non-successful approaches to non-invasive ICP measurement, primarily the individual patient calibration problem. Direct comparison of arterial blood pressure (ABP) and externally applied pressure is the basic arterial blood pressure measurement principle, which eliminates the need for individual calibration. The same calibration-free fundamental principle is used in the TDTD non-invasive ICP absolute value measurement method. The mean value of OA blood flow, its systolic and diastolic values, pulsatility and other indexes are almost the same in both OA segments in the point of balance when ICP equals Pe. As a result of that, all individual influential factors (ABP, cerebrovascular auto-regulation impairment, individual pathophysiological state of patience, individual diameter, and anatomy of OA, hydrodynamic resistance of eyeball vessels, etc.) do not influence the balance of ICP equaling Pe and, as a consequence, such natural “scales” do not need calibration. Ragauskas A. et al. have already published the statistically significant results of a prospective clinical study on assessment of the accuracy and precision of proposed non-invasive absolute ICP value measurement method. The study shows that proposed method is the only quantitative noninvasive ICP absolute value (mmHg) measurement method which does not need an individual patient-specific calibration. High accuracy, precision, sensitivity and specificity of the proposed method are fully acceptable for clinical practice and for very wide applications in neurology, transplantology, intensive care, sports medicine, aerospace medicine, and combat casualty care. This method was further developed by the Company Vittamed Ltd along with consortium partners in EU FP7 projects BrainSafe Brainsafe, Brainsafe II, and TBIcare.  Ultrasound time of the flight techniques  The majority of patented methods for noninvasive monitoring of ICP are based on an assumption that changes in ICP affect the physical dimensions and/or acoustic properties of the cranial vault or intracranial structures (dura, brain tissue, brain ventricles, and/or intracranial vessels). The common drawback of all these methods is that they measure only relative changes of ICP as referenced to a baseline measurement during which absolute ICP is known, i.e. the ultrasound readouts need to be calibrated on each subject against an invasive measurement. Ultrasound ‘time of the flight’ methods for non-invasive ICP monitoring have not been extensively validated and currently, the majority of them do not seem to be accurate enough for a routine clinical use. Their original formulations usually do not specify locations for the transducer's placement and do not address how the intentional or accidental use of different locations and/or angles of the transducers will affect the reliability of ICP estimates. It has also remained unexplored how the measurements are affected by the presence of intracranial pathological masses on the path of the ultrasound wave, or by brain masses shifts.  Cranium diameter  Dimensions of the cranium or its structures are determined with the ultrasound “time-of-the-flight” technique that measures the transit time of an ultrasound wave and its (potentially multiple) echoes on their path through the cranium and calculates the corresponding distance(s) using known ultrasound propagation velocities in different tissues (e.g. bone, brain, or fluid). Unfortunately, a reproducible quantitative relationship between the diameter of the cranium and ICP could not be established because ICP-induced changes in the cranium diameter are very small compared to the inter-individual variability of skull sizes, shapes and thicknesses.  Thickness of the dura  The methodKageyama, N., Kuchiwaki, H., Ito, J., Sakuma, N., Ogura, Y., Minimiyama, F.: US4971061 (1990). claims that ICP can be inferred from the thickness of the dura mater that is estimated from interference echoes of an ultrasonic wave. The utility of the method was successfully confirmed on four healthy subjects and four patients with intracranial hypertension, but larger validation studies have never been conducted as the method failed to attract enough interest among clinicians. This method also needs a calibration to the individual patients.  Cerebral ventricle  MichaeliMichaeli, D.: WO00068647 (2000). proposed that ICP should be inferred from the magnitude and shape of pulsations of the third ventricle synchronous with the cardiac cycle or respiration, where the pulsations are measured along the propagation axis of an ultrasound wave. The method so far has not been independently validated, and the author provides no exact data from which one could estimate the accuracy of the method. However, the discussion in the body of the patent document suggests that the method is able to distinguish among three ranges of ICP (<20, 20–40 and >40mmHg) but cannot provide an exact value of ICP within the range because of the impossibility of the calibration to the individual patient. Method and device for non-invasive (NI) ICP measurement according to inventions of David Michaeli MD, PhD, based to the TRA (tissue resonance analysis) have 2 options: (1) The qualitative method makes an evaluation of mild (10-20mm.Hg), moderate (20-40) and severe (above 40mmHg) ICP elevation. These method is using NI, long-term recording of ICP waves patterns, Like Lundsbergs ICP waves. (2) Quantitative measurement OF ICP WAVES with special ICP formulation in mm.Hg., Developed new device and method for calibration of ICP for each patient; see patent description.  Brain parenchyma  More recently, multivariate methods have been proposed that derive ICP by combining the transit times with measured acoustic impedance, resonant frequency and ultrasound velocity,6\\\\. Bridger et al. US5919144 (1999). or with a dispersion of the ultrasound wave on its way through the brain parenchyma.7\\\\. Ragauskas A, A., Daubaris, G.: US5388583 (1995). Ultrasound ICP monitors based on the latter approach, which were developed at Vittamed Technologijos (Kaunas, Lithuania), have shown an impressive agreement with invasively measured ICP, with an average difference of only 2–3 mmHg in a small clinical population. However Vittamed Technologijos time-of-flight technologies were developed further for other applications of neuro-monitoring technologies (including cerebral Autoregulation and Cerebral Compliance).  Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography  The TCD measures the velocity of blood flow through the major intracranial vessels by emitting a high frequency (>2MHz) wave from an ultrasound probe and detecting a frequency shift between the incident and reflected wave which directly correlates with the speed of the blood (the so- called Doppler effect). The measurement is taken over the regions of the skull with thinner walls (temporal region, back of the head, or through the eye), as the bones strongly attenuate the transmission of the ultrasound at these frequencies. TCD is primarily a technique for diagnosing various intracranial vascular disorders such as emboli, stenosis, or vasospasm, and can be used to identify patients who are at risk of developing cerebral ischemia in early phases of traumatic brain injury or stroke. ICP can be estimated from the TCD measurements because it impedes the blood flow and consequently decreases the velocity of blood flow. Besides the mean velocity, pulsatility index (which is the difference between peak systolic and end diastolic velocity, divided by mean flow velocity), a fraction of the cycle in systole and slopes of the TCD waveforms have been correlated with ICP. The estimates are however insufficiently accurate with the margin of error of ±10 - 15 mmHg. Physiosonics, Inc. used transcranial Doppler ultrasound to measure ICP indirectly by assessing the elasticity of the biological material in a defined part of the brain. However, the elasticity in the brain is highly dependent on many other variable individual factors apart from ICP, including arterial blood pressure, state of cerebral blood flow auto-regulation, and the level of edema. Therefore, this approach would require calibration and expert positioning.  Skull bones  Methods from this group attempt to derive ICP from mechanical properties of the skull bones rather than of the intracranial content. The underlying assumption is similar to that of the ultrasound time of the flight techniques: that the skull is not completely rigid so that changes in ICP result in a small but measurable skull expansion which creates additional stress within the skull bones and modifies their mechanical properties.10\\\\. Mick, E.: US5074310 (1991). The transfer function is derived by applying a wide-band, low frequency (<100 Hz) mechanical excitation at one location on the skull (via a piezo-transducer or an impact hammer) and comparing its spectrum to that of a signal received at another location on the upper half of skull. It is proposed that the measurement to be self-calibrated by obtaining the frequency response spectrum from a point on the base of the skull of the same subject, which is assumed not to be affected by ICP, or alternatively, pre-calibrated on subjects with normal ICP. Other methods from this group vary this basic approach of Mick in different ways. In Sinha's11\\\\. Sinha, D.N.: US20006117089 (2000). method resonant frequency of the skull bones is determined first, then a sinusoidal excitation at the resonant frequency is delivered through a piezo-transducer, and ICP is calculated directly from the phase difference between the excitatory signal and response detected with a second transducer. Yost and Cantrell12\\\\. Yost, W.T., Cantrell, J.H.: US20046746410 (2004). divided the process into two steps. In the first step, changes in the circumference of the cranium are calculated from the phase difference between a sinusoidal excitatory signal, delivered with a piezo-transducer, and the response that is received at a distance with another piezotransducer. In the second step, changes in ICP are calculated as a product of the changes in the cranium circumference and the elasticity constant of the skull that has been determined earlier by causing known changes in ICP while measuring the cranium circumference. None of the aforementioned methods has been properly validated in relevant clinical populations, and their accuracy is unknown. One may assume however that it would be comparable to the ultrasound time-of-the-flight methods, and thus insufficient for a routine clinical use. Luna Innovations Incorporated (NASDAQ: LUNA) developed EN-TACT system, an ultrasound device for monitoring compartment syndrome. The technology was claimed to have applications for raised intracranial pressure. Based on research from the NASA Ames research center, the company used ultrasound to measure skull diameter changes caused by ICP changes. However, skull changes are tiny and only indirectly related to ICP, raising questions about the accuracy and calibration.  Tympanic membrane displacement  Tympanic membrane displacement (TMD) technique, proposed nearly twenty years ago by Marchbanks13\\\\. Marchbanks, R.J.: US4841986 (1989). exploits the effect of intracranial pressure on the acoustic reflex, i.e. a reflex contraction of the stapedius and tensor tympani muscles in response to a sound. Normally, vibrations of the tympanic membrane (eardrum) elicited by acoustic stimuli are transmitted through the chain of ossicles (malleus, incus, and stapes) in the middle ear to the oval window of the cochlea. Vibrations of the footplate of stapes transmit through the oval window to the perilymph, which in turn causes the endolymph, the basilar membrane, and the organ of Corti to vibrate, activating ultimately the acoustic sensor cells, the inner hair cells of the organ of Corti. The transfer function of this complex mechanical system under physiological conditions is modulated by the action of two small muscles of the middle ear, the tensor tympani, and stapedius. The tensor tympani arises from the cartilaginous portion of the auditory tube and the osseous canal of the sphenoid and, having sharply bent over the extremity of the septum, attaches to the manubrium of the malleus (hammer); its contraction pulls the malleus medially, away from the tympanic membrane, which tenses the membrane. The stapedius, which emerges from the posterior wall of the tympanic cavity of the middle ear and inserts into the neck of the stapes (stirrup), prevents excess movements of the stapes by pulling it away from the oval window. The action of either muscle, therefore, dampens vibrations of the ossicles and reduces the amplitude of transmitted sounds for up to 20 dB. The muscles normally contract in response to vocalization, jawing and loud external sounds, which is accompanied by a small but measurable displacement of the eardrum from its initial position. Because cerebrospinal fluid and perilymph communicate through the cochlear aqueduct, an increase in intracranial pressure is directly transmitted to the footplate of the stapes, changing its initial position and affecting thereby the direction and magnitude of the displacement of the eardrum in response to a sound. The displacement can be measured with common tympanometers used for impedance audiometry that are portable and relatively inexpensive and easy to use (particularly the modern, computerized tympanometers with fully automated measurement procedure). Inward displacement (negative peak pressure on an audiogram) is suggestive of high, and outward of normal or low ICP. The direction and magnitude of TMD, however, depend not only on the initial position of stapes but also on numerous other factors that affect the acoustic impedance (integrity of the eardrum, condition of the ossicles, patency of the Eustachian tube, pressure and eventual presence of fluid or other masses in the middle ear) or the strength of the acoustic reflex (physiological variability of the reflex threshold, functional integrity of the cochlear and facial nerves, degree of eventual sensory hearing loss). In addition, the assumption that the pressure of perilymph is equal to ICP does not hold if the patency of the cochlear aqueduct is compromised, which is often the case in elderly subjects. Accuracy of TMD estimates of ICP was found to be at the order of ±15mmHg, which is not sufficient for a reliable quantitative assessment of ICP in clinical practice. An interesting method that involves direct manipulations on the tympanic membrane rather than relying on the acoustic reflex was proposed as one of the embodiments of a US patent by Ragauskas.15\\\\. Ragauskas, A.: US20067147605 (2006). First, a measurement of the position of the tympanic membrane needs to be obtained while ICP is zero (denoted as the baseline position). Equalization of ICP to the atmospheric pressure according to the inventor can be achieved non-invasively by tilting the head up, or the measurement can be taken during a neurosurgical operation. Later on, ICP can be measured by exerting an external pressure to the tympanic membrane and applying simultaneously the same pressure onto the oval window and inner ear (e.g. through the Eustachian tube) until the eardrum is moved back to the baseline position, which will happen when the exerted external pressure equals ICP. No data is provided in the patent nor is available from other sources that could support the utility of the concept in clinical practice.  Otoacoustic emission  TMD fails to provide accurate estimates of ICP mostly because the acoustic impedance and its changes due to the acoustic reflex are dominantly determined by the structures and functional properties of the middle ear, and only marginally influenced by changes in ICP. A measurable acoustic phenomenon that originates in the inner ear would, at least in theory, allow for more precise assessment of the pressure of the peri- and endo-lymph, and consequently, of ICP. Otoacoustic emission (OAE), which is a sound generated by subtle oscillations of the endo- and perilymph caused by contractions of the outer hair cells of the inner ear in response to a loud sound, seems to offer such a possibility. The sound is transmitted to the stapes, and further through the ossicles, to the tympanic membrane from which it can be detected with a sensitive microphone inserted into the ear canal. OAE is used in clinical practice to test for hearing deficits in babies and children who are too young to cooperate. The equipment can be made portable and is relatively easy to use. Two approaches have commonly utilized that increase the unfavorable signal-to- noise ratio and facilitate extraction of the OAE waveform: transient evoked otoacoustic emission (TEOAE) and distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE). In a recent US patent issued to Meyerson and colleagues16\\\\. Meyerson, S.C., Avan, P.A., Buki, B.: US20036589189 (2003). proposed the use of both the TEOAE and DPOAE for measurement of ICP. TEOAE is used first to determine the optimum OAE response frequency, after which the pair of pure tones is deployed in a DPOAE paradigm such that the cubic distortion product frequency equals the optimum response frequency while the ratio of frequencies f2/f1 is set to 5:4, and of intensities I2/I1 to 6:5. The inventors also proposed formulae that relate ICP to the intensity or phase of the measured OAE signal, and described how the other physiological signals or behaviors that are known to affect ICP such as small oscillations of ICP with each heartbeat, respiration, or posture changes, can be used to confirm the validity of the obtained measurements (e.g. the absence of modulation of the measured OAE phase with respiration may indicate occlusion of the cochlear aqueduct, in which case OAE cannot provide any information about ICP). There is little data up to date about the clinical utility or accuracy of otoacoustic emission as a measure of ICP. A pilot study of Frank and colleagues that evaluated different modalities of OAE in 12 healthy volunteers and 5 patients with implanted ventricular catheters for direct ICP monitoring revealed that increased ICP or conditions known to increase ICP (e.g. posture changes, abdomen compression, coughing) were associated with notable decreases (between -2.1 and -7.9SPL) in intensity of the evoked OAE. All results were however reported only as group averages, and no attempt was made to derive a quantitative one-to-one relation between the OAE intensity and ICP. This method as all other correlation-based approaches cannot be used for absolute ICP value measurement because of the impossibility of individual calibration.  Ocular measurements  Eye provides another possible window into the pressure changes in the intracranial compartment thanks to the fact that the space between the optic nerve and its sheath is a continuation of the subarachnoid space, and is consequently filled with cerebrospinal fluid whose pressure is equal to intracranial pressure. Intracranial hypertension will thus manifest in an increased diameter of the optic nerve sheath and will impede the blood flow through the central retinal vein that courses within the sheath, along and in part inside of the optical nerve. The impediment of venous return causes visible changes in the eye fundus (venous engorgement, and papilledema, i.e. swelling and elevation of the optic nerve disc) that can be observed with an ophthalmoscope and have therefore been used by clinicians for more than a century as signs of increased ICP. Quantitative assessment of ICP can be made noninvasively in two different ways: by measuring changes in diameter of the optic nerve sheath with an appropriate technique (ultrasound or MRI), or by using ophthalmodynamometry to determine the pressure in the central retinal vein, which is normally slightly higher (1- 2mmHg) than ICP. Intracranial hypertension also induces changes at the cellular or axonal level such as the swelling of the fibers of the optic nerve that form the innermost layer of the retina (so-called nerve fiber layer – NFL). The information provided by the classic ophthalmoscopy is however only qualitative and may be inconclusive during early phases of intracranial hypertension since it usually takes between two and four hours from the onset of ICP elevation for a papilledema to develop. A patented method that utilizes optical coherence tomography to measure the thickness of the nerve fiber layer and infers ICP from it laid claims of being able to detect the IH-induced thickening of the retina shortly after the onset of IH, but there has been no data that would support the claims or clarify the relationship between the NFL thickness and levels of ICP.  Optic nerve sheath diameter  The use of optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) for the assessment of ICP dates back to 1987 when Cennamo and colleagues demonstrated a linear relationship between ICP and the sheath diameter measured with a trans-orbital ultrasound probe in an A-scan mode (principally equivalent to the time-of-the-flight measurements of the cranium diameter). The original measurement method was technically difficult and unreliable because of the nearly coaxial alignment of the optic nerve and propagation axis of the ultrasound wave, but the precision was significantly improved with the use of B-scan (or planar) ultrasound which provided longitudinal cross-section images of the optic nerve and its sheath. Since then, the method has been successfully validated in several relatively large studies that included patients with severe head trauma, hydrocephalus, intracranial hemorrhage or stroke, liver failure, and climbers with acute mountain sickness. While the ONSD can at any given point along the optic nerve be measured with a precision of <1mm, the reliability of derived ICP levels is plagued by inter-individual variability and the dependence of ONSD magnitude on the point along the nerve at which the measurement was taken. Almost all validation studies so far have recommended that ONSD to be used for identification of patients with intracranial hypertension that requires treatment (ICP>20mmHg, i.e. ONSD>5mmHg) rather than for a measurement of ICP. ONSD measurement by ultrasound is not as precise as invasive ICP measurement but may be useful if invasive measurement is not available.  Ophthalmodynamometry or the measurement of the retinal venous outflow pressure (VOP)  Performed by applying external pressure on the sclera, for example with a spring plunger, while observing the retinal vessels through an ophthalmoscope. The pressure is gradually increased until the central retinal vein begins to pulsate, which happens at the point when the applied external pressure nears the VOP and is approximately equal to ICP. The original method was described in 1925 by Baurmann18\\\\. M. Über die Entstehung und Klinische Bedeutung des Netzhautvenenpulses. Ber Zusammenkunft Dtsch Ophthalmol Ges 1925; 45: 53-59. and belongs to the public domain, but several modifications have been recently patented that combine the classic ophthalmodynamometry with reflectance oximetry of the retina19\\\\. Denninghoff, K.R.: US20026390989 (2002). or ultrasound measurement of blood flow in the central retinal artery,20\\\\. Querfurth, H.W.: US20067122007 (2006). or automate the method by adding a camera and an image processing software capable of recognizing venous pulsations from a sequence of images of the eye fundus.21\\\\. Braxton, E.E.: US20060206037 (2006). Evaluation in patients confirmed a strong linear relationship and clinically negligible differences (2-3mmHg) between VOP and the invasively measured ICP. Ophthalmodynamometry requires dilated pupils, a skilled physician or medic, and collaboration of the patient, which all hampers its applicability in the field. It cannot be applied in cases of ocular trauma or conditions that selectively affect the optic nerve and gives erroneously high readings in the presence of a papilledema, which may persist long after ICP has returned to normal. Neurolife Non-invasive Solutions Inc. developed technology based on Braxton's patent. They won Purdue University's business plan competition in 2006 and were using the funds to develop iScan, its initial prototype. The approach worked on measuring ICP non-invasively by assessing changes in the retinal blood flow. However this is dependent on other factors apart from ICP, so it will be difficult to generate accuracy sufficient for clinical practice. Third Eye Diagnostics, Inc. is developing the Cerepress™, a non-invasive, hand-held intracranial pressure monitor that gathers information from the patient's un-dilated eye. The Cerepress™ measures blood pressure in the eye's central retinal vein (CRV) and blood velocity in the ophthalmic artery, which taken together highly correlate to intracranial pressure. To obtain CRV pressure, 3ED has developed a novel apparatus that simultaneously record images of the CRV and measures intraocular pressure (IOP) while the pressure in the eye is increased. A medical technician aligns the system by easily centering the field of view to patient's pupil eye. The system then contacts the patient's cornea and simultaneously collects images of the cornea and the retinal fundus. The contact force increases the IOP and momentarily compresses the CRV. At the instant of complete CRV compression, the Cerepress™ records the eye pressure, which is equivalent to CRV pressure. CRV pressure is a known to be a good correlate to ICP. This method requires an individual patient-specific calibration as every other \\"correlation-based\\" method.

Handel may have composed it in Germany before departing for Italy in 1706. The composition was lost for many years and was attributed to Handel again only in 2001.  History  Gloria (HWV deest, the Latin word meaning \\"missing\\"), is a work which was missing from the Handel thematic catalog, but was discovered at the Royal Academy of Music's library in 2001. Handel may have composed Gloria, a demanding piece for a coloratura voice, two violins and basso continuo, during his early years in Germany prior to his departure for Italy in 1706 or in Italy in 1707. He divided the liturgical text in eight movements. Later he used parts of it for his compositions Laudate pueri dominum and Utrecht Jubilate. The manuscript is not in Handel's hand but bound in a collection of arias by Handel. The singer William Savage (1720-1789) owned the volume. Probably his pupil Robert Stevens left it to the Academy upon his death in 1837. The work was identified by Hans Joachim Marx, professor at the University of Hamburg. A note in the Sunday Telegraph on 11 March 2001 announced \\"Lost work by Handel could rival Messiah / An unknown choral work by Handel that some music scholars believe will come to be regarded as significant as Messiah has been discovered in the library of the Royal Academy of Music\\", but that was a sensational heading, whereas the article described the work correctly. \\"Perhaps not too many sopranos will be able to perform this piece.\\", was a comment of Marx, who had found the manuscript. Curtis Price, the principal of the Academy, testified: \\"The music is fresh, exuberant and a little wild in places, but unmistakably Handel.\\" It was then believed that the piece was written in Italy in 1707. Emma Kirkby, who performed the first recording, released in May 2001, said that \\"the piece has individuality and charm, good bravura moments, and, more important, some moments of depth, beauty, and poignancy\\". The first public performance was on 18 May 2001, sung by soprano Patrizia Kwella with Fiori Musicali and Penelope Rapson as artistic director, at the Hinchingbrooke Performing Arts Centre in Huntingdon. A second performance was given at the International Händel Göttingen Festival on 3 June 2001 by Dominique Labelle with the Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra and Nicholas McGegan. Katia Plaschka performed it in 2003 in the Unionskirche, Idstein, along with Handel's Utrecht Te Deum and Jubilate.

A surreal combination of gangster film and haunted house film, which draws on Homer's Odyssey as well, Keyhole tells the story of a Ulysses Pick (Patric), who returns to his home and embarks on an odyssey through the house, one room at a time. Filming began in Winnipeg on July 6, 2010. Maddin shot Keyhole digitally rather than his usual method of shooting on 16mm or Super-8mm. Plot The gang of Ulysses Pick (Jason Patric) shoots its way into his former home, which the police have surrounded, with a hostage and a stuffed wolverine (named \\"Crispy\\") in tow. Big Ed, the gang's second-in-command, then evicts the dead gangsters (who seem otherwise alive), after asking them to identify themselves: \\"Those of you who have been killed, stand facing the wall.\\" They leave reluctantly, and the gang waits for Ulysses. The film's narrator, the ghost of Ulysses's father-in-law Calypso/Camille (Louis Negin), reveals that the house is haunted (and not only by him) because although a house's happiness is able to vacate the premises after its inhabitants have left, its sorrow is doomed to remain inside forever. This house had once belonged to Ulysses and his four children with his wife Hyacinth (Isabella Rossellini). Ulysses himself arrives, carrying a drowned young woman named Denny. After entering the house, Denny is able to stand under her own strength, and seems alive although injured and blind. She reveals that she can hear the thoughts of Ulysses as he wanders through the house, examining the objects that he had previously left behind. Calypso reveals that Hyacinth remains in Ulysses's former bedroom at the top of the house, where she has chained him (her father's ghost). Ulysses and Denny join the gang, who are confused about their plan (and don't understand why the police haven't shot their way into the house). Ulysses deflects questions about the plan and claims that the police won't enter the house while the storm is still in force. Big Ed, annoyed at being kept in the dark, criticizes Ulysses for adopting Heatly after he killed one of Ulysses's sons, and is thrashed. Calypso reveals that although he is chained to Hyacinth's bed, his chains stretch to unknown lengths, and torments Ed further through supernatural flogging. Ulysses collects the gang's guns and throws them into the ducts to be destroyed in the house's furnace. The gangster Ogilbe (Kevin McDonald) thinks he hears a noise and goes to investigate, exiting with a Scream-esque \\"I'll be right back.\\" He is immediately killed when he tries to have sex with one of the ghosts even though Ulysses just warned him not to bother the ghosts (upon contact with a washerwoman ghost, he's electrocuted—his ghost shortly completes the sex act). The bullets from the guns that had been thrown into the furnace begin to fire throughout the house (the laughing face of Calypso suggests that this is somehow the ghost's doing) and a stray bullet kills Heatly. As he dies, Ulysses reveals that he had at first adopted Heatly to torture him and himself as revenge for the death of his son but grew to love Heatly more than any of his sons. (Ulysses is unaware, as he says this, that the hostage who watches/hears is his only living son, Manners, having forgotten and failed to recognize him.) Ulysses disposes of the corpses of Heatly and Ogilbe in the bog located in the house's centre (Hyacinth's secluded outdoor garden located in a quadrangle within the labyrinthine house). Ulysses gathers his scout knife, the stuffed wolverine Crispy, Denny and his hostage son and sets forth into the house to find Hyacinth, ordering his gang to stay put but leaving the untrustworthy Big Ed in charge. Ulysses orders Denny to stay focused on reading his memories and forget about drowning, since he has forgotten too much to find Hyacinth without her help. She recounts his memory of coming home early to find Hyacinth at home alone, running naked with the family's dogs. Ulysses remembers being distressed at how the episode revealed the extent to which Hyacinth was a stranger to him, even though at the same time this moment was when he loved her the most. Ulysses contemplates the first of the house's many locked doors (which \\"all have to be opened\\"). In her bedroom at the top of the house, Hyacinth is startled by Calypso screaming awake from a nightmare of a young girl drowning. Calypso begs Hyacinth for release from his chains, revealing that Hyacinth is now sleeping with Chang, and Hyacinth fondly remembers her son Manners. Calypso tells Hyacinth that Ulysses is in the house coming to either save or kill Hyacinth (or both). Ulysses himself then speaks to Hyacinth through the keyhole of the first locked door, offering her his scout knife and convincing her to pretend he isn't there, allowing him to open the door. Ulysses investigates the room (the blind, drowned Denny helps him \\"see\\" the room as it once was) and begins remembering past events. He discovers the ghost of his son Brucie masturbating/playing Yahtzee in a cubbyhole (but doesn't recognize him or his milk-drinking ghost son Ned). Calypso's narration reveals that the hostage is Ulysses's only surviving son, Manners (also unrecognized). Meanwhile, the gangsters have begun to construct an electric chair. Ulysses makes another offering to Hyacinth (of Ned's bowl) to have her allow him through a second locked door. A doctor (Udo Kier) has been summoned to examine Denny. The doctor relates the tragic story of his only son's death, which occurred earlier that day from a fall that broke his neck and was followed by a wasp attack. In the next room (a bathroom), Denny bathes Manners while Ulysses remembers trying to console Hyacinth in her grief. The girl climbs into the bath with Manners, and Ulysses remembers accidentally breaking Ned's bowl after his death, upsetting Hyacinth. Denny discovers a secret passage that passes the \\"cyclops\\" (a penis sticking out the wall: \\"That penis is getting dusty,\\" remarks Ulysses). Calypso begs Hyacinth to release him so that he can stop Ulysses, who he has discovered is \\"bent on forgiveness,\\" a much worse scenario than the revenge he had feared. As ghosts and gangsters mill about, attempting to restore the house to its former glory, the doctor examines Denny and declares the drowned young woman to be drowned, and therefore dead. Manners frees himself from his gag and reveals his identity to his father, and that he was in love with Denny but she broke up with him and then drowned afterward. Manners tries to revive Denny but fails, and Ulysses leaves the doomed lovers to return to his gang, who strap him into the homemade electric chair (which is powered by pedalling). However, electrocuting Ulysses fails since he is revealed to be already dead (having been, ironically, executed in an electric chair). Having now fully recovered his memory, Ulysses has Big Ed electrocuted for insubordination and thrown with the chair into the bog. Ulysses takes Manners and the somewhat recovered Denny into the house's next room, where Manners relives a fond memory of Hyacinth. Calypso begs for release from Hyacinth before Chang returns, and she begins to file through his chains, while Manners leads Denny away to show her the desktop family organizer he invented to send messages between family members via pneumatic tubes. Ulysses interrupts Heatly about to have sex with his daughter Lota (a memory, he soon realizes). Lota, dying of cancer, throws herself into the bog to be reunited with Heatly in death. Ulysses tries to bond with Manners by playing catch with him, but Manners ignores his father. Calypso has been freed by Hyacinth, and Manners answers a ringing phone as Ulysses enters the master bedroom to find Hyacinth. Ulysses kills Chang and Manners hangs up the phone to remember Denny heading out for a midnight swim. Manners heads upstairs to his bedroom (which the gangsters have restored) and remembers Ulysses praising one of his inventions while Hyacinth notes that she has rearranged the house while Ulysses was away. As Hyacinth smiles and looks on, Manners and Ulysses restore the room to the way it used to be. The gangsters and the rest of the ghosts fade away (even the bullet holes fade) and Manners is left alone with his memories, holding a gun, in the empty house, hand turning a doorknob but not fully, unable or unwilling to leave.

The Film Society of Lincoln Center selected Keyhole as a part of their Film Comment Selects program, which will screen the film at a Special Premier event on March 20, 2012 with director Guy Maddin in attendance. Keyhole began its theatrical release in New York at the IFC Center on April 6, 2012. The film then opened at Laemmle Theatres NoHo7 and Playhouse 7 on April 13, 2012. Festivals Keyhole was selected to screen at the following film festivals: *2011 Toronto International Film Festival *2011 Whistler Film Festival *2012 South by Southwest *2012 Independent Film Festival of Boston *2012 Wisconsin Film Festival *2012 Fantasporto *2012 Berlin International Film Festival Home Video Keyhole was released to home video on DVD and Blu-ray by Monterey Media in 2012. The home video release also includes Maddin's short films Send Me to the 'Lectric Chair (2009, co-directed by and starring Isabella Rossellini) and Glorious.Keyhole. Dir. Guy Maddin. DVD. Monterey Media, 2012. Soundtrack The soundtrack for Keyhole was composed by Jason Staczek and released by Milan Records. In a note from the soundtrack's digital booklet, Maddin states the importance of the film's music: \\"I needed my movie to have the timeless logic of music, but it didn’t on the page and it didn’t on the set. [It didn't] until [Staczek] wrote the score for it.\\" Critical reception The film received generally positive reviews, with review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reporting a 70% approval rating based on 37 reviews. Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from film critics, posts a rating score of 63 based on 16 reviews. While some critics reacted negatively to the film, including Anna Coatman, who stated that \\"Keyhole is perhaps a little too inward-looking, a little too claustrophobic,\\" others, such as Roger Ebert, were more positive. Ebert gave the film 3/4 stars, writing that \\"Keyhole plays like a fever dream using the elements of film noir but restlessly rearranging them in an attempt to force sense out of them. You have the elements lined up against the wall, and in some mercurial way, they slip free and attack you from behind.\\" Steve Dollar of The Wall Street Journal stated that \\"Keyhole proves that [Maddin] is as spellbinding in pixels as in celluloid.\\" A. O. Scott of The New York Times also gave the film a positive review saying \\"'Keyhole' may also be a perfect gateway into the bizarre and fertile world of a unique film artist.\\" Alonso Duralde (in The Wrap) called Keyhole \\"a deliciously disturbing dreamscape for audiences who want to follow one of today’s most fascinating film artists on another wild ride.\\" The Village Voice writer Karina Longworth praised the film saying it is \\"stunning to look at... handmade, logic-defying, and magical.\\" Jason Buchanan noted that \\"Few contemporary directors possess such a bold, singularly unique vision as Maddin, and since the mid-'80s he's built an impressive body of work distinguished by the juxtaposition of dazzling imagery with darkly comic themes and dialogue.\\" See also *List of black-and-white films produced since 1970 References External links    Category:Canadian films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Guy Maddin Category:Films shot in Winnipeg Category:Films based on the Odyssey Category:Modern adaptations of the Odyssey ","title":"Keyhole (film)"},{"id":"32539173","text":"ESys.net is a hardware system design library for the .net/Mono frameworks that is basically a port of the SystemC framework for C++.

These mounting systems generally enable retrofitting of solar panels on roofs or as part of the structure of the building (called BIPV).  Roof mounting  PV panels mounted on roof Workers install residential rooftop solar panels The solar array of a PV system can be mounted on rooftops, generally with a few inches gap and parallel to the surface of the roof. If the rooftop is horizontal, the array is mounted with each panel aligned at an angle. If the panels are planned to be mounted before the construction of the roof, the roof can be designed accordingly by installing support brackets for the panels before the materials for the roof are installed. The installation of the solar panels can be undertaken by the crew responsible for installing the roof. If the roof is already constructed, it is relatively easy to retrofit panels directly on top of existing roofing structures. For a small minority of roofs (often not built to code) that are designed so that it is capable of bearing only the weight of the roof, installing solar panels demands that the roof structure must be strengthened beforehand. In all cases of retrofits particular consideration to weather sealing is necessary There are many low- weight designs for PV systems that can be used on either sloped or flat roofs (e.g. plastic wedges or the PV-pod), most however, rely on a type of extruded aluminum rails (e.g. Unirac). Recently, tension-based PV racking solutions have been tested successfully that reduce weight and cost.B.T. Wittbrodt & J.M. Pearce. Total U.S. cost evaluation of low-weight tension-based photovoltaic flat-roof-mounted racking.Solar Energy 117 (2015), 89–98.open access In some cases, converting to composition shingles, the weight of the removed roof materials can compensate the additional weight of the panels structure. The general practice for installation of roof-mounted solar panels include having a support bracket per hundred watts of panels.  Ground- mounted  Ground-mounted PV systems are usually large, utility-scale photovoltaic power stations. The PV array consist of solar modules held in place by racks or frames that are attached to ground-based mounting supports.SolarProfessional.com Ground-Mount PV Racking Systems March 2013Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources Ground-Mounted Solar Photovoltaic Systems, December 2012 Ground-based mounting supports include: * Pole mounts, which are driven directly into the ground or embedded in concrete. * Foundation mounts, such as concrete slabs or poured footings * Ballasted footing mounts, such as concrete or steel bases that use weight to secure the solar module system in position and do not require ground penetration. This type of mounting system is well suited for sites where excavation is not possible such as capped landfills and simplifies decommissioning or relocation of solar module systems.  Mounting as a shade structure  PV panels as external shading device in zero-energy building, Singapore Solar panels can also be mounted as shade structures where the solar panels can provide shade instead of patio covers. The cost of such shading systems are generally different from standard patio covers, especially in cases where the entire shade required is provided by the panels. The support structure for the shading systems can be normal systems as the weight of a standard PV array is between 3 and 5 pounds/ft2. If the panels are mounted at an angle steeper than normal patio covers, the support structures may require additional strengthening. Other issues that are considered include: * Simplified array access for maintenance. * Module wiring may be concealed to maintain the aesthetics of the shading structure. * Growing vines around the structure must be avoided as they may come in contact with the wiring.  Building-integrated photovoltaics  The CIS Tower in Manchester, England was clad in PV panels at a cost of £5.5 million. It started feeding electricity to the National Grid in November 2005 Building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) are photovoltaic materials that are used to replace conventional building materials in parts of the building envelope such as the roof (tiles), skylights, or facades. They are increasingly being incorporated into the construction of new buildings as a principal or ancillary source of electrical power, although existing buildings may be retrofitted with BIPV modules as well. The advantage of integrated photovoltaics over more common non- integrated systems is that the initial cost can be offset by reducing the amount spent on building materials and labor that would normally be used to construct the part of the building that the BIPV modules replace. Building- adapted photovoltaics (BAPV) uses solar modules to create solar PV windows and this way, also to retrofit existing building.  Orientation and inclination  A solar cell performs the best when its surface is perpendicular to the sun's rays, which change continuously over the course of the day and season. It is a common practice to tilt a fixed PV module (without solar tracker) at the same angle as the latitude of array's location to maximize the annual energy yield of module. For example, rooftop PV module at the tropics provides highest annual energy yield when inclination of panel surface is close to horizontal direction. A study in the tropics showed that the orientation of low-slope rooftop PV has negligible impact on annual energy yield, but in the case of PV external sunshade applications, east façade and panel slope of 30–40° are the most suitable location and inclination.

The libretto was adapted by Arensky from Alexander Ostrovsky's melodrama Voyevoda. The opera premiered on January 2, 1891 at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow with Arensky conducting.Casaglia (2005). The Old Style date of the premiere was December 21, 1890. Background Dream on the Volga was Arensky's first opera. He began working on it while still a student in Rimsky-Korsakov's composition class at the St. Petersburg Conservatory and finished it in 1890.Taruskin (1996) p. 11 Tchaikovsky, whose music also had a significant influence on Arensky, had twenty years earlier adapted the Ostrovsky play as an opera, The Voyevoda. However, Tchaikovsky was so dissatisfied with his own version that he later destroyed the manuscript score.Brown (2007) p. 37 Arensky's version was a much closer adaptation of the play than Tchaikovsky's which had condensed Ostrovsky's original five acts down to three. Tchaikovsky wrote to his brother Modest that he had not been very impressed when Arensky had played him fragments of the opera in St. Petersburg, but after going through the completed score in the summer of 1890 and then after seeing the premiere, he was convinced that it was one of the best Russian operas. He considered the music \\"very elegant\\" but went on to say that if it had one defect it was \\"a certain monotony of method\\" which reminded him of Rimsky- Korsakov.Tchaikovsky (1904/2004) p. 622 Igor Stravinsky, a later student of Rimsky-Korsakov, recalled attending a performance of Dream on the Volga in St. Petersburg with him. Stravinsky claimed to have found the music dull, and that during a bass clarinet solo intended to evoke a sinister atmosphere, Rimsky- Korsakov loudly commented, \\"the noble bass clarinet should not be put to such ignominious use.\\"Stravinsky and Craft (1981) pp. 61-62 However, the musicologist Richard Taruskin has cast doubt on the veracity of Stravinsky's anecdote, noting that the sole performance of the opera in St. Petersburg was in 1903, a time when it was unlikely that they were close enough to have been attending performances together. Taruskin also points out that Vasily Yastrebtsev wrote in his Reminiscences of Rimsky-Korsakov that one day in 1903 he had found the composer \\"leafing through Dream on the Volga and sincerely admiring many pages [...] 'Nowadays,' he said no one writes like this anymore; it smacks of something irretrievable.'\\"quoted in Taruskin (1996) p. 11 Synopsis The story revolves around an elderly Voyevoda (Provincial Governor) who falls in love with two young women and ruthlessly imprisons them. The first woman is married and the second is engaged to another man. After initial failed attempts by their partners to rescue them, the women are eventually freed when a new Voyevoda is appointed.Brown (2007) p. 36 Recordings There are no complete recordings of Dream on the Volga.

Central to the Cucumber BDD approach is its ordinary language parser called Gherkin. It allows expected software behaviors to be specified in a logical language that customers can understand. As such, Cucumber allows the execution of feature documentation written in business-facing text. It is often used for testing other software. It runs automated acceptance tests written in a behavior-driven development (BDD) style. Cucumber was originally written in the Ruby programming language. and was originally used exclusively for Ruby testing as a complement to the RSpec BDD framework. Cucumber now supports a variety of different programming languages through various implementations, including Java and JavaScript. The open source port of Cucumber in .Net is called SpecFlow. For example, Cuke4php and Cuke4Lua are software bridges that enable testing of PHP and Lua projects, respectively. Other implementations may simply leverage the Gherkin parser while implementing the rest of the testing framework in the target language. Gherkin language Gherkin is the language that Cucumber uses to define test cases. It is designed to be non- technical and human readable, and collectively describes use cases relating to a software system. The purpose behind Gherkin's syntax is to promote behavior- driven development practices across an entire development team, including business analysts and managers. It seeks to enforce firm, unambiguous requirements starting in the initial phases of requirements definition by business management and in other stages of the development lifecycle. In addition to providing a script for automated testing, Gherkin's natural language syntax is designed to provide simple documentation of the code under test. Gherkin currently supports keywords in dozens of languages. Language Operations # List available languages cucumber --i18n help # List a language's keywords cucumber --i18n $LANG Syntax Syntax is centered around a line- oriented design, similar to that of Python. The structure of a file is defined using whitespace and other control characters. \`#\` is used as the line-comment character, and can be placed anywhere in a file. Instructions are any non- empty and non-comment line. They consist of a recognized Gherkin keyword followed by a string. All Gherkin files have the \`.feature\` file extension. They contain a single Feature definition for the system under test and are an executable test script. Features, scenarios, and steps Cucumber tests are divided into individual Features. These Features are subdivided into Scenarios, which are sequences of Steps. Features A feature is a Use Case that describes a specific function of the software being tested. There are three parts to a Feature * The \`Feature:\` keyword * The Feature name (on the same line as the keyword) * An optional description on the following lines Example Feature definition Feature: Withdraw Money from ATM A user with an account at a bank would like to withdraw money from an ATM. Provided he has a valid account and debit or credit card, he should be allowed to make the transaction. The ATM will tend the requested amount of money, return his card, and subtract amount of the withdrawal from the user's account. Scenario: Scenario 1 Given preconditions When actions Then results Scenario: Scenario 2 ... Scenarios Each Feature is made of a collection of scenarios. A single scenario is a flow of events through the Feature being described and maps 1:1 with an executable test case for the system. Keeping with the example ATM withdrawal feature, a scenario might describe how a user requests money and what happens to their account. Scenario: Eric wants to withdraw money from his bank account at an ATM Given Eric has a valid Credit or Debit card And his account balance is $100 When he inserts his card And withdraws $45 Then the ATM should return $45 And his account balance is $55 In some cases, one might want to test multiple scenarios at once to perform Equivalence partitioning and Boundary-value analysis. A \`Scenario Outline\` provides a technique to specify multiple examples to test against a template scenario by using placeholders. For example, Scenario Outline: A user withdraws money from an ATM Given has a valid Credit or Debit card And their account balance is When they insert their card And withdraw Then the ATM should return And their account balance is Examples: Name OriginalBalance WithdrawalAmount NewBalance  Eric 100 45 55  Gaurav 100 40 60  Ed 1000 200 800 At runtime the scenario is run against each row in the table. Column values are substituted for each of the named placeholders in the scenario. Steps The crux of a Scenario is defined by a sequence of Steps outlining the preconditions and flow of events that will take place. The first word of a step is a keyword, typically one of * \`Given\` \\\\- Describes the preconditions and initial state before the start of a test and allows for any pre-test setup that may occur * \`When\` \\\\- Describes actions taken by a user during a test * \`Then\` \\\\- Describes the outcome resulting from actions taken in the When clause Occasionally, the combination of Given-When-Then uses other keywords to define conjunctions * \`And\` \\\\- Logical and * \`But\` \\\\- Logically the same as \`And\`, but used in the negative form Scenario: A user attempts to withdraw more money than they have in their account Given John has a valid Credit or Debit card And his account balance is $20 When he inserts his card And withdraws $40 Then the ATM displays an error And returns his card But his balance remains $20 Tags Gherkin's Feature structure forces organisation. However, in cases where this default organisation is inconvenient or insufficient, Gherkin provides Tags. Tags are \`@-prefixed\` strings and can be placed before * \`Feature\` * \`Scenario\` * \`Scenario Outline\` * \`Examples\` An element can have multiple tags and inherits from parent elements. Cucumber Step definitions Steps in Gherkin's \`.feature\` files can be considered a method invocation. Before Cucumber can execute a step it must be told, via a step definition, how that step should be performed. Definitions are written in Ruby and conventionally filed under \`features/step_definitions/*_steps.rb\`. Definitions start with the same keywords as their invocation (including Gherkin's full language support). Each definition takes two arguments * Either a regular expression or string with $variables * A block containing ruby code to execute Example using regular expressions Given /(.*) has a valid Credit or Debit card/ do |name# Ruby code end Example using strings and $variables. Note that at runtime the string is converted into a regular expression, and any $variable is converted to match \`(.*)\`. Given \\"$name has a valid Credit or Debit card\\" do |name# Ruby code end Hooks Hooks are Cucumber's way of allowing for setup to be performed prior to tests being run and teardown to be run afterwards. They are defined as executable Ruby blocks, similar to JUnit methods marked with \`@Before, @After\` annotations. Conventionally they are placed under \`support/\`, and are applied globally. Three basic types of hooks exist * \`Before\` \\\\- Runs before a scenario * \`After\` \\\\- Runs after a scenario * \`Around\` \\\\- Assumes control and runs around a scenario Additional hooks include * \`BeforeStep\` * \`AfterStep\` * \`AfterConfiguration\` \\\\- Runs after Cucumber configuration and is passed an instance of the configuration \`Before, After, and Around\` hooks optionally take a list of tags filtering scenarios that they apply to. A list of tags in the same string is treated as \`OR\`, while individual arguments are treated as \`AND\`; tags can be optionally negated by being preceded with \`~\`. Example of a tagged before hook Before('@ATM') do |scenario# Ruby code end Hooks are often used to maintain database state, typically by cleaning up prior to running a scenario. It is also possible to start and roll back a transaction using \`Before\` and \`After\` hooks, and many Cucumber extensions provide an \`@txn\` tag for such a purpose. Integrations and implementations Non Ruby implementations of Cucumber exist for popular languages including Java, JavaScript, and Python. Support also exists for integration testing frameworks. A complete list of implementations can be found on Cucumber. Cucumber has integrated testing tools working well with many Continuous Integration configurations. There are cucumber plugins for popular CI tools like Jenkins and TeamCity and also for IDEs like Eclipse and RubyMine. Below is an example of a step definition written for Java with Cucumber-JVM. @Given(\\"(.*) has a valid Credit or Debit card\\") public void has_card(String name) { // Java code } Formatter plugins Cucumber uses Formatter Plugins to provide output. Several common formats are provided by default, including * JSON * HTML * JUnit Available formats are not standardized across different Cucumber implementations, so offerings may differ. Cucumber also supports rich output formats like images and videos. Browser automation Cucumber does not provide built in browser automation. However, it does work well with existing programs such as Selenium and WATiR-WebDriver. It does support running tests with transactions through leveraging other programs such as ActiveRecord. Cucumber command- line Cucumber comes with a built-in command line interface that covers a comprehensive list of instructions. Like most command line tools, cucumber provides the \`--help\` option that provides a summary of arguments the command accepts. $ cucumber --help -r, --require LIBRARY|DIR Require files before executing the features. \\\\--i18n LANG List keywords for in a particular language. Run with \\"--i18n help\\" to see all languages. -f, --format FORMAT How to format features (Default: pretty). -o, --out [FILE|DIR] Write output to a file/directory instead of ... Cucumber command line can be used to quickly run defined tests. It also supports running a subset of scenarios by filtering tags. $ cucumber --tags @tag-name The above command helps in executing only those scenarios that have the specified \`@tag-name\`. Arguments can be provided as a logical \`OR\` or \`AND\` operation of tags. Apart from tags, scenarios can be filtered on scenario names. $ cucumber --name logout The above command will run only those scenarios that contain the word 'logout'. It is also useful to be able to know what went wrong when a test fails. Cucumber makes it easy to catch bugs in the code with the \`--backtrace\` option. Cucumber can also be configured to ignore certain scenarios that have not been completed by marking them with the Work In Progress tag \`@wip\`. When Cucumber is passed the \`--wip\` argument, Cucumber ignores scenarios with the \`@wip\` tag.

It received a further three nominations, including one for Winningham's performance. The Movie Scene gives the film a favorable review. In a contemporary review, The New York Times argues that the film is rather long- winded and criticizes the mother's actions but compliments it on being quite tough and a \\"handsome production\\". Plot The film begins in the 1930s and takes place over the following twenty years. Ten-year old Margaret Ryder is a hearing child born to deaf parents. After her younger brother is killed in an accident, she has to negotiate a price for his coffin, as her parents are unable to communicate with the speaking world. Margaret assists her parents at all times, but sometimes feels left out of the hearing world, as her parents don't encourage her to mix with others. Her only true friend is Mr. Petrakis, an immigrant from Greece who used the radio to learn English. As Margaret gets older, she excels in high school math and on graduating high school, Margaret gets a job. At work, she meets William Anglin, who asks her out. She turns him down multiple times as she is still living with and helping her parents in their new house. She finally accepts as he is enlisted in the war. They develop a romance and write to each other while he is gone. William comes home for a few days and they quickly marry as he is due to go back the next day. Margaret's parents are furious, but they eventually agree to meet his family. William comes home from the war early after an injury and stays with Margaret and her parents for a few weeks until he is accepted into a university. They move out of her family home and into a small university apartment. Margaret parents come to visit and are not happy with the accommodation they are living in and leave. Margaret and her parents don't speak for a while until Margaret shows up at their house, pregnant. Her parents begin to argue with her about how well William is providing for her and how responsible she is. Finally she tells them that she has been responsible her whole life as she has had to interpret the world for her parents since she was little. Tearfully, she sits alone in a church and reminisces over her times with Mr. Petrakis, who has recently died. Margaret gives birth to a son, Marshal. At the Christening, her parents arrive and they are reunited. Five years later, Margaret's mother is retiring and the factory she worked at is throwing her a party. She stands in front of everyone and signs a speech about how the hearing and deaf are alike and should not be divided.

The line was inaugurated on May 31, 2019, and started operating on June 1 as the first high-speed railway in Denmark. It supports speeds of up to 250 km/h for passenger trains as well as a maximum of 24 trains per hour along its length.\\"Copenhagen-Ringsted High- Speed Line.\\" railway-technology.com, Retrieved: 30 June 2018. The construction of the Copenhagen–Ringsted Line was largely as a consequence of the conventional Copenhagen–Fredericia/Taulov Line between the Danish cities of Copenhagen and Ringsted having become highly congested. During 1999, the first proposals for the route, prepared by the national Rail Planning Committee, were rejected by the Danish Parliament, leading to further studying and refinement. In 2009, the government formally discounted the idea of simply building an extra line alongside the traditional line and, during the following year, opted to authorise the building of a higher-speed line along a new alignment. National railway infrastructure agency Banedanmark intentionally divided the project's work into individual packages, worth between €30 million and €200 million, which were competitively bid for by multiple consortiums and individual companies. On 12 September 2012, the construction phase of the programme officially begun. In addition to the line itself, other engineering works are also being performed, including the building of two new stations, one at Ny Ellebjerg and the other at Køge North which has now been completed, while additional infrastructure is also being installed at existing stations. By late 2017, reports emerged of severe difficulties having been encountered with the new line's signalling system; according to project officials, initial operations are to be limited to only one train per hour for the first year while remedial work is performed. Development Background and options During the late 1990s, the conventional railway between the Danish cities of Copenhagen to Ringsted became highly congested, forming a bottleneck along that section of the Copenhagen–Fredericia/Taulov Line. Recognising the necessity of addressing this situation, Danish officials began to consider various methods intended to resolve this. In 1993, the first proposals for improving railway transportation between Copenhagen and Ringsted were formalised; one of the early options to be explored was the construction of new main line-standard tracks between Hvidovre and Taastrup. During 1994-1997, the Rail Planning Committee decided to expand the railway lines in order to meet passenger capacity between Copenhagen and Ringsted and suggested various specific methods, such as expansion with two new tracks. During 1997, the Planning Act was passed, which incorporated a plan for the construction of a new line between Copenhagen and Ringsted. Furthermore, the act provided three different solutions for the project; these involved either the expansion of the existing tracks via the construction of a pair of new tracks alongside the existing lines or construction of two tracks along a new alignment between Copenhagen and Ringsted via Køge, which included an option for building a new station at Køge. A combination of both expansion and new construction were also considered. During March 1999, these proposed solutions were rejected, thus efforts were made to refine these proposals ahead of another review. International consultancy firm NIRAS was involved in the production of preliminary design and project propositions. According to official documentation published during 2005, the projected time for the line's completion was eight years from its authorisation, of which construction will take five years. Reportedly, the Copenhagen–Ringsted Line was estimated to incur a one-time cost of $1.83 billion to complete. Selection and approval During March 2007, following a review of the studied options, the Danish parliament decided to restrict further research activity to two of the potential solutions, the so-called 'greenfield solution' and the 'fifth-track solution'. In late 2009, the fifth-track solution was officially rejected, although it was projected that this option would have been cheaper. During May 2010, the greenfield solution for the line received approval from the Danish Parliament in the form of the Construction Act. The greenfield solution's aim is the diversion of all trains which do not service local destinations between Copenhagen and Roskilde or between Roskilde and Ringsted, onto a newly built line, which later became known as the Copenhagen–Ringsted Line. By building the Copenhagen–Ringsted Line, it was anticipated that local traffic could then be expanded on the existing railway, while those trains which traveled on the new line would benefit from reduced travel times between Copenhagen and Køge, where a new station will be constructed at Køge North, to be reduced by 15 minutes. In total, a 60km section of new dual-track electrified railway, capable of handling speeds of up to 250km/h for passenger trains, is to be built; reportedly, this undertaking shall be the largest rail programme to ever be performed by national railway infrastructure agency Banedanmark. The decision to construct a new high speed railway line that it led to the forming of an initiative, known as the one hour target, which is a stated aim of reducing travel times across Denmark's major cities, such as Copenhagen, Odense, Aarhus and Aalborg, to just one hour. The Copenhagen–Ringsted Line shall help reduce some of these intercity journey times to one hour or less, although it is also acknowledged that further higher-speed lines shall need to be constructed in order achieve all of the desired reductions. Route As intended, trains are to follow the existing line from Copenhagen Central station through Ny Ellebjerg station. The new line will begin south of the Vigerslev Allé station, and follow the Kulbanevej street and the Motorway 21. From there, it will turn north of Ishøj and after that follow the motorway E20 all the way to Fjællebro (Kværkeby) in Ringsted Municipality, from where it will go north of and parallel to the old Vestbanen line until Ringsted. The line will also be linked to an existing 180km railway that passes between Copenhagen and the Danish land border with Germany. The new platforms on the left The Copenhagen–Ringsted Line will feature a new station at Ny Ellebjerg; this facility is intended to be connected to the S-train line F and a future metro line.\\"Copenhagen Ringsted.\\" uk.banedanmark.dk, Retrieved: 30 June 2018. Another new station, Køge North Station, is now completed just south of the road Egedesvej. This facility is equipped with train platforms both east of (S-train) (in Ølsemagle Lyng or Ølsemagle Strand) and west of the motorway (close to the village Ølsemagle, further to the west), located near motorway exit 32 north of Køge. A pedestrian bridge formed as a tube over the motorway forms a connection between the platforms. Furthermore, an additional track is to be installed at Køge Station while Ringsted Station is to be renovated as well. The programme shall require the construction of various civil engineering works, including a total of five tunnels, which possess a cumulative length of 2km, and four bridges, which had a combined length of 1,8km. In addition, various roads, bridges, and miscellaneous passages are to be installed along the length of the route. Reportedly, the construction phase shall require 128,000m3 of concrete, 105,000t of steel, 358,000m3 of gravel and 327,000m3 of chippings. Construction During January 2011, it was announced that a consortium of Vössing, EKJ Consulting and Sweco, led by engineering company Atkins, had signed a contract with Banedanmark to design the first stretch of the railway line.\\"Consultants appointed for København capacity increase .\\" Railway Gazette, 30 June 2009. Banedanmark decided that the best approach would be to divided the contracts for the civil works into packages worth between €30 million and €200 million. In July 2012, civil engineering firm MT Højgaard was awarded a contract for the construction of four road bridges and railway bridges near Vallensbaek and Brøndby, while Aarsleff Rail was contracted by Rail Net Denmark to construct 12 bridges between Ishøj and Greve in January 2013. During June 2013, a consortium of Barslund and CG Jensen received a contract for the construction of a bridge on Brondby Østervej, as well as a railway tunnel near Holbækmotorvejen, and a pass through Vestvolden.\\"København - Ringsted civils contract awarded.\\" Railway Gazette, 23 October 2013.\\"Bidding begins on København - Ringsted new line.\\" Railway Gazette, 6 March 2012. On 12September 2012, a ceremony officiated by the then-Minister for Transport Henrik Dam Kristensen was held to mark the commencement of construction activity on the new line; at the occasion, much fanfare was made of the improvements to international travel that it promised to enable once completed. In September 2016 was started the construction of the new station Køge Nord. Minister Hans Christian Schmidt also started tracklaying beginning in Ringsted this time. It was finished in time in May 2017. In parallel in January 2017 was started redesign of Ringsted station infrastructure. Some 16km tracks were reconstructed and 24 turnouts implemented. In May 2017 started final construction with provision of catenary and signalling equipment. Because of difficulties in provision of ETCS onboard equipment to the trains some replanning has happened. So there was a need for additional installation of deprecated ATC equipment, which caused a further delay of opening. So it is able to pass initially only 1 train per hour the new line.\\"Multi-billion new Danish rail line to run at half capacity.\\" thelocal.dk, 27 October 2017. The speed is permitted in ATC to , while trainsets with ETCS Level2 may take usage of construction speed. ATC will be obsoleted with ETCS installation in trains, in worst case lasting until 2023. As designed, the total capacity of the new line was planned to be 24 trains per hour per direction, but this number is far larger than the current capacity of Copenhagen Central Station, which is ca. 17 trains arriving from west per hour. In August 2018 construction phase was finished, electricity switched on in mid of August and testing with rolling stock was started at the end of August. Opening The line was inaugurated on May 31st, 2019 and Crown Prince Frederik was guest of honour as the new high-speed rail track was opened by national rail infrastructure company Banedanmark. The track has been built to enable high-speed trains which can travel at up to 250 kilometres per hour, although such trains will not be used on the line initially, with operator DSB instead using existing trains at increased speeds. High-speed rail (HSR) will be possible on the new line in future, however.https://www.thelocal.dk/20190531/denmark-opens-first-high-speed-rail- line-but-commuters-must-wait-for-faster-journeys Sources Category:Zealand Category:High-speed railway lines in Denmark Category:Railway lines opened in 2019 ","title":"Copenhagen–Ringsted Line"},{"id":"32539358","text":"The Jie are an ethnic group of Uganda. They belong to the Karamojong Cluster, which also includes the Karamojong and Dodoth people. Their country in northeast Uganda lies between the Dodoth to the north and the Karamojong to the south. The Jie people were estimated to number about 50,000 as of 1986. Their language is a dialect of the Karamojong language. Jie families that believe they are distantly related in the male line often keep their homesteads close to each other. Jie clans are groups of related people that may have over one hundred members. They are exogamous, meaning that people must marry outside the clan, and men should generally not marry into their mother's clan. There are some common cultural symbols among the Jie, such as jewelry, but they do not have strong shared taboos related to animals or food. The Jie are semi-nomadic pastoral people. They share the habit of constant low-level warfare, mainly to capture cattle, with their neighbors. According to P.H. Gulliver, writing in 1952, \\"Turkana made war on all their neighbours with the exception of the Jie, with whom they occasionally allied themselves against the Karamajong and the Dodoth. Karamajong similarly made war on all their neighbors with the exception of the Dudoth, with whom they occasionally allied themselves against the Jie. Jie claim friendship with the Toposa, but since they have no common boundaries this would have been of little importance. Toposa and Donyiro did not fight each other, and are known to have formed an alliance against the Turkana. Toposa and Jie were enemies\\". The Jie have experienced difficulty with a government that is not sympathetic to their lifestyle, wanting them to stay in one place for easier administration, and to sell their cattle for cash to pay taxes. The people retain their warlike traditions. In June 2009, eight people were shot dead by Jie warriors in Kaabong district. The warriors had been prevented by police from raiding protected kraals. They killed six residents of Luwakuj village in Kapedo sub- county and two residents in Lukwakaramoi village in Kalapata sub-county.

FAO stated that Land suitability is the fitness of a given type of land for a defined use. The land may be considered in its present condition or after improvements. The process of land suitability classification is the appraisal and grouping of specific areas of land in terms of their suitability for defined uses. FAO. Chapter 3. http://www.fao.org/docrep/X5310E/x5310e04.htm Structure Each category retains its basic meaning within the context of the different classifications and as applied to different kinds of land use. Pour categories of decreasing generalization are recognized: *I. Land Suitability Orders: reflecting kinds of suitability. *II. Land Suitability Classes: reflecting degrees of suitability within Orders. *III. Land Suitability Subclasses: reflecting kinds of limitation, or main kinds of improvement measures required, within Classes. *IV. Land Suitability Units: reflecting minor differences in required management within Subclasses Land Suitability Orders Land suitability Orders indicate whether land is assessed as suitable or not suitable for the use under consideration. There are two orders represented in maps, tables, etc. by the symbols S and N respectively. * Order S: Suitable. Land on which sustained use of the kind under consideration is expected to yield benefits which justify the inputs, without unacceptable risk of damage to land resources. * Order N: Not Suitable. Land which has qualities that appear to preclude sustained use of the kind under consideration. Land may be classed as Not Suitable for a given use for a number of reasons. It may be that the proposed use is technically impracticable, such as the irrigation of rocky steep land, or that it would cause severe environmental degradation, such as the cultivation of steep slopes. Frequently, however, the reason is economic: that the value of the expected benefits does not justify the expected costs of the inputs that would be required. Land Suitability Classes Land suitability Classes reflect degrees of suitability. The classes are numbered consecutively, by Arabic numbers, in sequence of decreasing degrees of suitability within the Order. Within the Order Suitable the number of classes is not specified. There might, for example, be only two, S1 and S2. The number of classes recognized should be kept to the minimum necessary to meet interpretative aims; five should probably be the most ever used. If three Classes are recognized within the Order Suitable, as can often be recommended, the following names and definitions may be appropriate in a qualitative classification: *Class S1 Highly Suitable: Land having no significant limitations to sustained application of a given use, or only minor limitations that will not significantly reduce productivity or benefits and will not raise inputs above an acceptable level. *Class S2 Moderately Suitable: Land having limitations which in aggregate are moderately severe for sustained application of a given use; the limitations will reduce productivity or benefits and increase required inputs to the extent that the overall advantage to be gained from the use, although still attractive, will be appreciably inferior to that expected on Class S1 land. *Class S3 Marginally Suitable: Land having limitations which in aggregate are severe for sustained application of a given use and will so reduce productivity or benefits, or increase required inputs, that this expenditure will be only marginally justified. Within the Order Not Suitable, there are normally two Classes: *Class N1 Currently Not Suitable: Land having limitations which may be surmountable in time but which cannot be corrected with existing knowledge at currently acceptable cost; the limitations are so severe as to preclude successful sustained use of the land in the given manner. *Class N2 Permanently Not Suitable: Land having limitations which appear so severe as to preclude any possibilities Of successful sustained use of the land in the given manner.

Alexander Riedel of the State Museum of Natural History Karlsruhe and Thomas van de Kamp of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology discovered it in specimens of Trigonopterus oblongus, a weevil found in Papua. Discovery Anatomical examination was made for specimens of the weevil species Trigonopterus oblongus, provided by the Karlsruhe State Museum of Natural History, using a microtomograph at the Institute of Synchrotron Radiation (ANKA) of Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. The analysis revealed that the weevils had a nut-and-screw system for the hip-leg joint. Mechanism Diagram of the biological screw in the weevil Trigonopterus oblongus The lateral aspect on thorax of the weevil Trigonopterus oblongus. In this genus, the metanepisternite is absent and the elytron touches the metaventrite (indicated). The mechanism has been described as \\"rotational movement combined with a single-axis translation\\". The arthropod hip–leg joint consists of two parts – the coxa (or the hip) and the trochanter (or the head of the arthropod leg femur). The coxa, in the case of weevils, resembles a nut, and it has a thread running along its inner surface with an angular span of 345°. The trochanter resembles the screw. It is rod-shaped with a large external spiral flange, having an angular span of 410°, in excess of a full circle, which functions as a thread. When the leg muscles of a beetle are stretched, the screw turns. Though the screw-thread provide for very large angular rotation, the front legs of weevils are capable of rotating by 90°, while their hind legs can rotate by 130°. The weevils are just long and can fold their legs below their body. The joint is just in size. Prior to this discovery all known hip-leg joints have been based on either the ball and socket joint system for hip-leg connections, as in humans, as hinges or as saddle joints. The discovery is the first ever instance of a musculoskeletal nut-and-screw system in the animal kingdom. Evolution The screw-and-nut system has been found to be present in all 15 weevils examined by the scientists and appears to be a hitherto unknown anatomical feature of weevils. It has been estimated that weevils evolved this system about 100 million years ago. It is surmised that the development of this feature provided additional flexibility which permitted weevils to improve their climbing abilities, helped them keep steady when at rest, and to give a stronger leverage for piercing by the snout.

They were active around the town of Mazzarino, Italy, in the 1950s. Their trial was a much-debated issue in the early '60s in Italy, in the context of the historical struggle between clerical and anti-clerical political forces prominent at that time. The whole story was pieced together in 1989 by journalist Giorgio Frasca Polara in his book La Terribile Istoria dei Frati di Mazzarino (The Terrible History of the Mazzarino Friars), published by . Criminal history The friars Vittorio (l.) and Carmelo (r.) on March 13, 1962 In April 1956 the provincial Father of the order came to Mazzarino for a visit, after hearing rumors about an extortion business managed by four friars. These four Capuchin friars were Venanzio, Carmelo, Agrippino and Vittorio. (Agrippino had earlier apparently been coerced into joining the gang, after shotgun fire nearly hit him. He was told that they \\"would aim better next time\\", by monastery gardener Carmelo Lo Bartolo.) After arriving to the friary, the superior spoke with two suspects, who told him that his life was in great danger and that he could save himself only by dropping the inquiry and paying 600.000 lire to someone they knew. The scared superior paid the large sum, but was later blackmailed again by the Friars, acting like humble and frightened emissaries of a powerful crime covenant.Oreste del Buono, Giorgio Boatti, Tutto Libri, December 29, 2001 Extortion and murders After their success with the provincial prior, Father Enrico, the gang turned its attention to more wealthy villagers. The Friars demanded money from the local pharmacist, Ernesto Colajanni. He refused firmly, and a few days later the oak door of his house was set on fire. Colajanni spoke to the friary prior, Father Venanzio, noting that he had a very profound knowledge of his earnings and wealth. Venanzio agreed to intercede with the blackmailers, and came back to Colajanni two days later with bad news: the criminals were now asking for at least 2 million lire (as a comparison, the sale price of a brand new Fiat 1400 sedan in 1950 was 1.275.000 lire). Colajanni, unable to afford such a sum, asked Father Venanzio to haggle, and ultimately agreed to pay half a million. One year later, the Friars tried again to get money from a local landowner, Angelo Cannata. After his refusal to pay, they met him one evening while he was returning from work. They stopped his car, which had him, his wife, son and chauffeur inside it, threatened him with a gun, shot his legs and fled. The man died minutes later from blood loss. After a few days, Father Carmelo met with Cannata's wife and relatives, asking for more money in order to have the mysterious crime group spare their lives. The relatives, not understanding the role of the Friars in the murder, politely declined and told Father Carmelo that they had faith in Divine Providence. Angered, the friar left the house allegedly crying \\"che Provvidenza e Provvidenza! Ci avimu a pinzari nuantri, no Diu! (\\"What Providence and Providence, thinking of God is up to us!\\"). The Cannata family paid the required ransom. Arrest On May 5, 1959, a further extortion went awry when the victim refused to pay and was gunned down by the Friars. The victim, city guard Giovanni Stuppia, got severe wounds to his legs and passed out, but managed to wake up and go to the Mazzarino Carabinieri station. He told them about the extortion, the names of the four friars intended to receive the money and identified the four killers: Carmelo Lo Bartolo, Girolamo Azzolina, Giuseppe Salemi and Filippo Nicoletti. Two friars and three laypeople were arrested the same evening, while Lo Bartolo succeeded in escaping capture. Father Agrippino and Father Venanzio turned themselves in one month later. Lo Bartolo was later found in Ventimiglia, trying to buy a house with 20 million lire, allegedly acquired from the extortion. The Caltanissetta public prosecutor began an extensive investigation that ultimately led to the indictment of the four friars, along with four laypeople, on February 16, 1960. Among them was Carmelo Lo Bartolo, the market gardener of the friary, who was deemed to be the head of the killer commando. Controversy The trial was a very divisive issue in Italian society in the late '50s and early '60s. Despite the public prosecutor quickly managed to gather many unquestionable evidence and accounts about the role of the friars, clerical supporters (mostly linked to the Democrazia Cristiana Church and other Catholic institutions), led by the Palermo Archbishop Ernesto Ruffini, promptly stated that the friars were innocent victims of a trap by anti-Catholic forces. The Catholic newspaper Avvenire was the main mean of propaganda for those stating the innocence of the friars. Lo Bartolo was deemed by the Catholic press to be a communist, and was accused of being violent and the leader of the group. He was found dead in jail on the day before he was supposed to testify, with his death declared a suicide by hanging. The suicide looked suspicious, as his body was hanged with a bed sheet to a nail in the wall placed only about one meter from the ground, but no formal inquiry was conducted. Allegations were brought forth by Catholic supporters claiming that he was the mastermind of a plan by the communists to discredit the friars, who were not only called \\"victims\\", but even \\"saints\\". Inquiry and trial Defense Francesco Carnelutti, a very prominent Italian attorney and jurist of the 20th century, was called to defend the Capuchins. Despite being very close to the Church, and risking a breach with the other Catholic forces in the country by this action, Carnelutti advised the friars to acknowledge their role, but stated that they could not act in any other way since they were under menace from the Sicilian Mafia themselves. As part of the defense, Carnelutti stated that one of the friars, Father Agrippino, risked being killed when he decided not to collaborate, and showed some holes in a wall of his cell, allegedly marks of bullets from a lupara shotgun. When asked about their cooperation with the alleged Mafia crime ring, Carnelutti publicly told the friars \\"If you will ever find yourself in that kind of troubles another time, do the same error again\\". Please consider that this article is strongly biased, being written by a friend of the friars, and many facts are related in a non-neutral, unreliable way in favor of their innocence. Involvement of Cosimo Cristina Cosimo Cristina, a Sicilian journalist, wrote an article for the Prospettive Siciliane, affirming he had proofs that a notable attorney and journalist from Mazzarino was behind the criminal covenant, along with the friars. The name of this attorney was not explicitly stated, but only three people matched the profile. Attorney Alfonso Russo Cigna, a correspondent for Giornale di Sicilia, sued Cristina for defamation and won in an unusually short trial promptly instructed and lasting only 20 days. Cristina was sentenced to one year and four months of suspended sentence, along with a 2 million lire fine. Two months later, while waiting for the appeal where he would have presented his evidence, he was killed in a fake suicide in Termini Imerese, his body apparently trampled by a train. The suicide was shown to be a murder by other journalists six years later. First sentence Ultimately, on June 22, 1962, the four laypeople were found guilty of extortion and manslaughter, with Azzolina and Salemmi receiving sentences of up to 30 years and Nicoletti receiving 14 years. Lo Bartolo was dead at the time, but his role was acknowledged. The friars were discharged because of Carnelutti's defense. The sentence was well received by the high-ups of the Catholic hierarchy, but many jurists and citizens were outraged. Giovanni Leone, a preeminent jurist and then Speaker of the lower house of the Italian Parliament, decided to speak out against the sentence, while also wanting to avoid hurting his relations with his peers at the Democrazia Cristiana. In a letter to the magazine Epoca, he attacked the \\"state of necessity\\" exception brought by the court, and wrote that any gentlemen, whatever his dress, knows how not to get involved with the Mafia. Sentence revisions On July 6, 1963, the Appeal Court of Perugia revised the sentence, finding three of the four friars guilty of extortion, manslaughter, violence and simulation of a crime, sentencing each to 13 years. Father Vittorio was discharged again. The typewriter used in the ransom letters was proven to be Vittorio's, but he proved that he usually left it unattended outside his room. On February 10, 1965, the Corte di Cassazione found procedural faults in the proceedings, and restarted the trial. The new trial ended with sentences of 8 years for Father Venanzio and Agrippino, 14 years for Nicoletti, 17 for Salemi and 24 for Azzolina. Father Carmelo, over 80 years old, had died a few months earlier, on December 12, 1964. The sentence was confirmed on September 30, 1967. The friars were set free because of remissions and good behavior on July 5, 1969. Being compromised, Agrippino left for Peru, while Venanzio came back to Mazzarino in bad health, dying on February 11, 1970.

The company targeted oil sands opportunities outside of the Athabasca mining area and was focusing on in situ plays in the Grosmont and Grand Rapids formations. Its headquarters were located in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. History It was founded in 2005 by President and CEO Glen C. Schmidt. The company takes its name from the Latin root for the tamarack, a hardy species of tall and skinny trees that thrive on the northern fringe of tree growth in North America. Mr. Schmidt said the tamarack is known for being the first tree to arrive in an area. Since its inception, the company has raised approximately $1.2 billion (Canadian) in equity financing and has accumulated 61,703 net hectares. A key investor is the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), which invested $250 million in exchange for 17.1 per cent ownership and the right to nominate someone for election to Laricina's board of directors, as long as CPPIB maintains a 10-per-cent holding. The company has established four main development areas in Germain, Saleski, Poplar and Conn Creek within the Athabasca oilsands region, with more than of estimated exploitable net bitumen. According to GLJ Petroleum Consultants in Calgary, Laricina is one of the four emerging oil sands producers with more than five billion barrels of recoverable oil resources. Laricina Energy was acquired by CNRL in September 2018 in a deal worth $46.3 million. Saleski Pilot In the winter of 2009 Laricina conducted a series of non-thermal test with solvents on a well in its Grosmont formation at Saleski. The test confirmed the overall capacity and quality of the bitumen reservoirs within the carbonates. In the fall of 2010 the company completed construction of its Saleski Pilot near Wabasca, Alberta. Saleski is the world’s first Grosmont carbonate oil sands project that uses steam- assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) technology, and the first SAGD project to produce bitumen from Alberta’s Grosmont Formation, Alberta’s second-largest In situ oil sands resource. The Saleski Pilot is licensed for of production. Steam injection started in December 2010 and first oil production was achieved in April 2011. On July 14, 2011 Laricina Energy was selected as one of six innovative energy projects by the Alberta Government to receive funding under the Innovative Energy Technologies Program in support of its Saleski Grosmont Formation steam-assisted gravity drainage pilot. The Saleski Pilot is unique in that it is designed to enhance industry’s proven SAGD extraction method – by combining steam with solvents, a process called solvent-cyclic SAGD or SC- SAGD. The primary objective of the Saleski Pilot is to understand the technical parameters of the reservoir in order to optimize the application of the SC-SAGD process for commercial development. As of July 2011, Laricina is seeking regulatory approval for Phase 1 expansion at Saleski. This is the first of six potential phases of the Saleski Project’s expansion. Phase 1 is a expansion that will bring the total field production to . Laricina is taking a staged approach to expand bitumen production capacity to over a 30-year period. In March 2013, Laricina became the first company to assign probable reserves in the Grosmont formation. The company assigned 128 million barrels of probable reserves to the first phase of its Saleski development.

They belong to the Karamojong Cluster, which also includes the Karamojong and Jie people. Their language is a dialect of the Karamojong language. Location The former Kotido District in Uganda. Kaabong is in the north. The Dodoth live in Kaabong District in the northeast of Uganda, a region of semi-arid savannah, bush and mountains. Their tradition says that they arrived in their current area from the north. In the mid-eighteenth century they separated from the Karamojong and moved northward into more mountainous territory. The heartland of their country is a bowl surrounded by mountains and hills on all sides. The tallest peak, Mount Morungole, is over high, near the point where Kenya, Sudan and Uganda converge. The land was once rich in wildlife including lions, elephants, buffalo, giraffes and rhino. Today, a small remnant of this wildlife is preserved in Kidepo National Park. The climate is harsh. Some rain may fall in April and there is usually a longer rainy season from June to early September, but these rains are not dependable and in some years fail altogether. In good years, the Dodoth mainly live on sorghum and millet. To survive in tough years they depend on livestock - cattle, goats and sheep. As well as providing nutrition, the animals represent wealth, and are central to many aspects of their culture. Homesteads The Dodoth homesteads are usually in valleys, and have dry season pastures on nearby hillsides. Unlike other people of the region, they therefore do not have to migrate with the seasons. Dodoth homesteads are isolated from one another, surrounded by a strong wall made of upright poles with interwoven branches cemented with mud and cow dung. Cattle are kept within the walls at night. A homestead may include up to forty people. Each wife has her own hut and fireplace. Her adolescent daughters will often build their own huts next to their mother's hut. Adolescent boys live in a larger \\"men's house\\" until they marry. A woman will often have a small garden near her hut. Conflict The scarcity of resources and high value of cattle have led to a culture where men are noted for their bravery in raiding and warfare and their resultant wealth. Bride prices are paid in cattle. The Dodoth share the habit of constant low-level warfare, mainly to capture cattle, with their neighbors. According to P.H. Gulliver, writing in 1952, \\"Turkana made war on all their neighbours with the exception of the Jie, with whom they occasionally allied themselves against the Karamajong and the Dodoth. Karamajong similarly made war on all their neighbors with the exception of the Dudoth, with whom they occasionally allied themselves against the Jie. Jie claim friendship with the Toposa, but since they have no common boundaries this would have been of little importance. Toposa and Donyiro did not fight each other, and are known to have formed an alliance against the Turkana. Toposa and Jiye were enemies\\". Plans for cattle raids, and other important decisions, are decided by the menfolk, with the views of the elders carrying great weight. The Dodoth are less well armed than their neighbors, and in 1979–81 lost practically all of their cattle to better-armed raiders. In 2004 there were violent clashes between the Dodoth and the Turkana people of Kenya, to the east. Several Turkana were kidnapped and had begun to be integrated into Dodoth families by the time a peace conference was held in 2005. At this conference it was agreed to forget the past and return the captured people.

He was also the publisher of the '.  Biography  Self- caricature from the endpaper of a book. His father, Friedrich Wilhelm Timm (1779-1848), was the mayor of Riga.Brief biography @ Russian Paintings. His sister, Emilie, married the painter Karl Bryullov in 1839. His first art studies were in Riga, then he went to Saint Petersburg, where he enrolled as a \\"foreign student\\" at the Imperial Academy of Arts. His primary instructor there was the battle painter, Alexander Sauerweid.Brief biography @ RusArtNet. He was awarded two silver medals and graduated in 1839 with the title of \\"Artist\\". Five years later, thanks to an Imperial scholarship, he went to Paris where he worked under the direction of Horace Vernet, also a battle painter, and made a visit to Algiers. Upon his return to Paris, he began exhibiting at the Salon where he attracted critical praise. The onset of the French Revolution of 1848 forced him to return to Saint Petersburg, where he was initially employed as an illustrator; notably for the works of Faddey Bulgarin and Nikolay Gretsch. He worked primarily in the media of lithography and woodcuts and was sometimes referred to as the \\"Russian Gavarni\\". He travelled extensively throughout Russia, serving as a battle painter during the second phase of the Caucasian War. In 1852, he accompanied Tsar Nicholas I on a visit to Finland . Later, he made sketches at the Siege of Sevastopol. As a result, in 1855, he was named an \\"Academician\\" by the Imperial Academy. From 1851 to 1862, by leave of the Royal Family, he published the Russian Art Gazette, which featured works by many prominent Russian artists, made into lithographs by Timm. He had to stop publishing the gazette when he began to suffer from an eye disease. In 1867, he moved to Berlin to seek treatment and took up a position as the Director of a privately operated ceramics institute. He never returned to Russia. In 1876, he was appointed a Professor at the Prussian Academy of Arts and began working at the Royal Porcelain Factory. After his death, his widow donated his estate to the Riga City Art Museum.

It was discovered by CKD Pharmaceuticals and its clinical development was led by Zafgen. Drug development was halted in 2016 after deaths during clinical trials. Mechanism of action Beloranib, an analog of the natural chemical compound fumagillin, is an inhibitor of the enzyme METAP2. It was originally designed as angiogenesis inhibitor for the treatment of cancer. However, once the potential anti-obesity effects of METAP2 inhibition became apparent, the clinical development began to focus on these effects and beloranib has shown positive results in preliminary clinical trials for this indication. Clinical trials A Phase I trial was published in 2013, finding a dose that led to weight loss in obese women in comparison to placebo. Results from a Phase II clinical trial for obesity were promising with clinically meaningful weight loss and improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors in the treated group. Zafgen continued with a Phase III trial for Prader–Willi syndrome. In December 2015, Zafgen halted the Phase III clinical trial of beloranib for Prader–Willi syndrome after a second patient death in order to determine whether the deaths were treatment-related. After discussions with the Food and Drug Administration indicated that the obstacles to gaining approval were insurmountable, product development for beloranib was ended.

His love for geology and the Earth was first realised whilst studying at London's Northwood School. Studying geology, he graduated from Cardiff University in 1992. He obtained his doctorate in 1996 at the University of Liverpool based on his research into ways that textures in volcanic and igneous rocks were formed and could be studied. He began his professional career in 1996 with a two-year postdoctoral position at the University of Würzburg, Germany. In 1998 he returned to the UK and spent 13 years as research fellow, lecturer and senior lecturer at the University of Durham.

Biographical Information  He was born on February 26, 1918 in San Francisco, California, and died on June 17, 2010 in Atherton, California.  Career  He became president and chairman of the board of Transamerica Corporation in 1960 when it was a little-known holding company. He was CEO of Transamerica Corp. for 23 years, until 1983, he transformed it from an anonymous holding company into a major, diversified, operating company that became a household name. He embarked the company on an aggressive advertising campaign that propelled the Transamerica brand name into a household name to the general public. He increased Transamerica's earnings by 20-fold during his tenure as president and chairman. It grew to be one of the 100 largest companies in the United States. He was instrumental in the purchases of motion picture distributor United Artists, Transamerica Airlines, Budget Rent-a-Car Co., De Laval Turbine and Occidental Life Insurance. He commissioned the building of the Transamerica Pyramid, a landmark building in the San Francisco Financial District. Construction of the Transamerica Pyramid began in 1969. The 853-foot pyramid-shaped skyscraper designed by architect William Pereira was intended to become the San Francisco's tallest building. The building of this pyramid created instant controversy, which helped create public awareness of Transamerica. The Transamerica Pyramid is located in the heart of the San Francisco Financial District at 600 Montgomery Street in San Francisco, California. It is a part of Transamerica Center (a complex that includes Two Transamerica Center and Transamerica Redwood Park) and encompasses nearly one city block. He was named \\"Best Chief Executive Officer\\" of all U.S. financial organizations for the years 1977 and 1978 by Financial World.  Family  He was married first to Dian Calkin Beckett (who died before him) and then to Marjorie Beckett, his wife of 41 years.

In addition to Kerala, the Indian states of West Bengal and Tripura have had democratically elected multiple Marxist governments, and change takes place in the government by regular multiparty electoral process. Communism of Kerala has provided Indian communist stalwarts such as M. N. Govindan Nair, C. Achutha Menon, T. V. Thomas, P. K. Vasudevan Nair, E. M. S. Namboodiripad, C. K. Chandrappan and A. K. Gopalan. Today the two largest communist parties in Kerala politics are the Communist Party of India and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (which split from the Communist Party of India in 1964). The Left Democratic Front is a coalition of left-wing political parties in the state of Kerala and is one of the two major political coalitions in Kerala, each of which have been in power alternatively for the last two decades. The coalition consists of the Communist Party of India, the Communist Party of India (Marxist), the Revolutionary Socialist Party (India), the Janata Dal (Secular), the Nationalist Congress Party, the Indian National League, the Kerala Congress (Anti-merger Group), and the Indian National Congress (Socialist). History Formation of a socialist wing tableau in a communist rally in Kerala, India, of a young farmer and worker. An important feature of the anti- Colonial struggles in Malabar district, Cochin Kingdom and Travancore Kingdom (these three regions will later form Kerala state, along with some regions from South Kanara) in the 1920s and 1930s was the increasing involvement of peasants and workers. The peasant and labour movements of the 1930s were to a great extent the cause as well as the consequence of the emergence of a powerful left wing in politics. In 1934, the left anti-Colonials joined together and organized the Congress Socialist Party with C. K. Govindan Nair as Secretary within the Congress Party. A powerful factor that helped the growth of the left movement was the support it received from the radical section of the anti-Colonial native Muslims in Malabar. Left groups started functioning in several parts of Malabar and soon the Kerala Provincial Congress Committee (KPCC) was dominated by them. It was only by 1938-39 Malabar district, Cochin Kingdom and Travancore Kingdom were fully drawn into the anti-British struggle for self-rule as well as the struggle for responsible Government in the Princely States. The leftists preferred to remain organizationally within the Congress and call themselves Socialists. Thus both the left and right groups joined together in order to ensure the success of the Congress candidates in the election of 1936 in Malabar district. Birth of the Communist Party E.M.S. Namboodiripad But the rift between the Indian National Congress and the Socialist wing came into the open with the outbreak of the World War II, the resignation of the Congress ministries in the provinces and the starting of individual satyagraha. They were expelled from the Congress Socialist Party in March 1940, after allegations that the communists had disrupted party activities and were intent on coopting party organizations. Indeed, by the time the communists were expelled, they had gained control over the entire Congress Socialist Party units in what were to become the southern states of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh. The left-dominated Kerala Provincial Congress Committee, contrary to directive of the Congress, observed. The left wing met in secret enclave at Parapram, Pinarayi, near Thalassery and in December 1939, the Communist Party was born. In 1957 the CPI was elected to rule the state government of Kerala only to have the government dismissed and President's Rule declared in 1959. In 1964, in conjunction with the widening rift between China and the Soviet Union, a large leftist faction of the CPI leadership, based predominantly in Kerala and West Bengal, split from the party to form the Communist Party of India (Marxist), or CPI (M). In Kerala, the CPI (M) in coalition with other parties wrested control from the Congress and its allies (frequently including the CPI) in 1967, in 1980, and in 1987. Support for the CPI (M) in Kerala in general elections has ranged from 19 percent to 26 percent, but the party has never won more than nine of Kerala's twenty seats in Parliament. But as a coalition including CPI (M), CPI and other parties as Left Democratic Front they won 19 seats out of 20. Communism in practice A communist flag in Kanjirappally, Kerala. The Communist Party in Kerala is unique because it has functioned under the conditions of a liberal democracy, relying on success in multi-party elections to remain in power. CPI's 1957 constitution stated it would allow the existence of opposing parties after it had parliamentary majority. Party leaders, like Namboodiripad, did not like the idea of using military force to remain in power because it would reflect poorly on the CPI as a whole on a global stage. This reliance on the people's opinions created a benevolent communist government, but it also made it more difficult to enact radical reforms. Therefore, the reforms of the CPI in Kerala were mainly moderately socialist. Agrarian reform One of the major changes advocated by the CPI was the Agrarian Relations Bill, passed in 1961. The bill was intentionally moderate because those drafting it knew it would have to pass through many constitutional channels before it would be made into a law. Over 1,000 amendments were debated due to party divisions. Though the bill was moderate, it still changed the farming system. It abolished feudalism and aimed to create a capitalist agricultural system. The CPI did not push more radical Communist land reforms. Namboodiripad stated they would not attempt state ownership or collective farms because even though such ideas might appeal to intellectuals on a scientific basis, they would not actually help the peasantry in practice. The bill aimed to improve wages and working conditions as well as secure employment. Landlords were only allowed to work on their land if they paid compensation, which helped protect the tenants’ rights. Administrative reform The CPI also wanted to reorganize its administrative structure. The administration was already undergoing changes after India gained independence and the local government in particular had new responsibilities. Rather than just tax collection, it had to focus more on development and welfare. In local government, the CPI promised less corruption, nepotism, political patronage, and inefficiency, which it planned to achieve through decentralization. Its main priority was building a socialist government. This required Congress's cooperation and the people's approval. In 1957 the party secretary, Govindan Nair, was concerned that the new government had still not improved the efficiency of the old administration. He used the newly created Administrative Reforms Committee to rectify this. The Committee was responsible for reviewing the existing administration and recommending new methods for coordinating governing bodies. It distributed a questionnaire concerning administrative machinery to over a thousand people, both within the government and outside of it. The CPI was seeking consensual reform rather than a drastic upheaval or consolidation of its own power. It wanted the cooperation of each governing body, down to the village level, to create a more efficient and democratic government. At the local level, the government relied the panchayat, or village council, to report on development and welfare. The Block Advisory Committee was a step above the panchayat, which had advising responsibilities along with other independent powers. Overall, the changes the CPI made once it was in government can be characterized as \\"Congress-socialist style reforms\\". Though it was a communist party, like any democratically elected power, the CPI had to balance its loyalty to the people with its desire to expand and increase power. Industrial reform As the CPI in Kerala was ultimately controlled by the federal government, its state plan depended on the funds it could raise independently. It struggled to industrialize and develop new manufacturing plants in Kerala throughout the 1960s while balancing out the disparities of industrialization. The CPI had Industries ministers who were responsible for industrial development. It also had an Industrial Development Cooperation that gave financial assistance to companies to help them startup new manufacturing projects. In the early 1970s, the CPI created two new corporations to help with industrial development: the Kerala Industrial and Technical Consultancy Organization and the Kerala State Electronics Development Corporation. These measures improved industry on a state level, but were less successful at the local level. To revitalize local industry, the CPI launched an ambitious Four- Year Plan, perhaps modeling itself after Stalin's Five-Year Plans which Namboodiripad considered an inspiration. The Four-Year Plan involved district- level conventions to excite potential entrepreneurs since the government wanted more private investors to spur industry. These entrepreneurs were trained to set up their own industries. The plan was hugely successful within the first 6 weeks and managed to set up eleven new industrial estates, but then lagged as the program continued.

A member of the Molson family, he was Mayor of Dorval, Quebec. He perished in the sinking of RMS Titanic on April 15, 1912. Molson was born August 9, 1856, son of William Markland Molson (1833–1913) and Helen Augusta Converse (1834–1919), in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Although Harry Molson was not a prominent member of the influential branch of the Molson family, he serendipitously inherited his fortune from his childless uncle, John Henry Robinson Molson (1826–1897), who was former owner of Molson Brewery and President of Molson Bank (1889–1897). Harry Molson went to England for business in February 1912, and had booked passage to return to Canada at the end of March on the Allan Line ocean liner, SS Tunisian. Molson was persuaded by fellow businessman, Major Arthur Peuchen, to extend his stay in England and sail home with him on Titanic's maiden voyage. He occupied First Class stateroom C-30. He was Governor of Montreal General Hospital, and on the board of directors for the Molson Bank. Molson was last seen aboard Titanic, removing his shoes and planning to swim to a ship's light he claimed he saw off the port bow. His body was never recovered.

Playing career O'Connor played rugby for the ACT in the 1990s and was awarded a single cap for the Wallabies against Ireland in 1994. He signed for rugby league club the Hunter Mariners in 1996, but the club's existence was threatened by the Super League war, so he played in only several trial matches that year.Hunter Mariners 1908.com He played for Paris Saint-Germain in 1997.Matt O'Connor rugbyleagueproject.org O'Connor spent three years in Japan playing for and then coaching Kubota Rugby Team. He lived in Japan with his wife and three children. Coaching Returning to Australia, O'Connor joined the Brumbies as a backline coach in Canberra. He was appointed head coach of Australia A for the Pacific Nations Cup competition. O'Connor joined the Leicester Tigers as the backline coach under Heyneke Meyer, replacing another Australian former centre, Pat Howard. Leicester won the English Premiership in 2009. O'Connor remained as attack coach when Richard Cockerill took over as head coach for the following season with the club going on to win the Premiership again in 2010. Cockerill was promoted to the position of director of rugby and O'Connor was appointed head coach of Leicester in July 2010, and he was extremely influential in the Tigers Premiership win of 2013. He was signed as the head coach of Irish province Leinster in 2013, and won the 2013–14 Pro12 title in his first season. The following season, when the team missed out on a play-off spot in the Pro12 and lost at the semi-final stage of the Champions Cup, O'Connor was sacked by Leinster after completing two years of a three-year contract. O'Connor joined the Queensland Reds as attack coach for 2016. After Richard Graham was sacked two games into the season, O'Connor was appointed as co-interim head coach of the team alongside Nick Stiles. In March 2017, following the sacking of Richard Cockerill as director of rugby in January, Leicester Tigers announced that O'Connor would return to the club as head coach, with current head coach Aaron Mauger leaving with immediate effect.

Heck is the founding editor of art and fashion publication Nomenus Quarterly. In 2013, Heck was awarded the Infinity Award for Applied/Fashion/Advertising by the International Center of Photography. He is also the youngest person to photograph Neiman Marcus' prestigious \\"Art of Fashion\\" campaign, which he shot in 2012. In its April 2011 issue, Photo District News magazine named Heck one of the 30 “new and emerging photographers to watch.” Heck was also awarded with the renowned \\"30 Under 30\\" award by Forbes Magazine. Early life and education Heck was born in Excelsior, Minnesota. Heck was exposed to art and museums in Minneapolis from an early age by his parents. He began photographing at the age of 14, after receiving his first camera as a gift from his mother. In 2002, as a senior in high school, Heck received the Alliance for Young Artists & Writers Scholastic Art Awards Gold Medal for his work in photography. Heck graduated from Salve Regina University with a degree in political science and earned his MFA in photography from Parsons the New School for Design.  Work  Erik Madigan Heck moved to New York City where he founded the semi-yearly publication Nomenus Quarterly in 2007. The project was conceived as a collaborative platform working with artists of all mediums within the worlds of fine art and fashion. Nomenus Quarterly was published both online and in print, and featured the work of artists such as Anselm Kiefer, Gerhard Richter, Rodarte, Ann Demeulemeester, and Heck himself. Journalist Dan Thawley describes Heck’s work as “[having] a dreamlike quality marked by surrealist undertones, an appreciation for fine art conventions, and an exploration of various photographic mediums (both modern and obsolete)”. Heck works with both analog and digital photography as well as with Super 8 for film shorts. Heck identifies himself as a “painter who uses photography,” and cites the 19th century painter Edouard Vuillard as one of his major influences as well as the work of modern photographer Harry Callahan. Due to Heck's interest in mediums and technologies of the past, his reoccurring use of nature as a theme, as well as his focus on beauty as the ultimate ideal, Heck’s work has often been described as a contemporary extension of Romanticism. Referencing his own work, Heck explains that “...to access beauty is what we ultimately desire, and the tangibility of this access is what in my opinion ultimately differentiates fashion from art as end points on a continuum, and simultaneously elevates fashion photography to such an important place in contemporary society.”A Magazine Curated by Giambattista Valli, Issue #10. 2010. p 150-151 Heck has also created advertorial portfolios for brands such as Mary Katrantzou, Kenzo, and Etro. Exhibitions Heck has shown work internationally. In June 2014, Heck’s solo show, “The Absorbed Tradition,” was shown at Bosi Contemporary in New York and presented alongside a special new Heck-curated issue of Creem Magazine. His photographs have also been included in exhibitions such as “Outer Dark: Continuing After Fashion” at the Museum für angewandte Kunst Frankfurt and “Don’t Stop Now: Fashion Photography Next” at FOAM Museum Amsterdam. * 2020: The Garden, Christophe Guye Galerie, Zurich, Switzerland * 2018: Old Future, Christophe Guye Galerie, Zurich, Switzerland * 2018: Old Future, Nicholas Metivier, Toronto, Canada * 2018: Erik Madigan Heck, Jackson Fine Art, Atlanta, USA * 2017: Old Future, The Weinstein Hammons Gallery, Minneapolis, USA  References   External links  * Erik Madigan Heck website Category:1983 births Category:Living people Category:People from Excelsior, Minnesota Category:American photographers Category:Fashion photographers Category:Artists from Minnesota Category:Parsons School of Design alumni ","title":"Erik Madigan Heck"},{"id":"32540047","text":"Nosson Dovid Rabinowich is an American scholar of classical and medieval Jewish history former Dean of Ahavath Torah Institute in Brooklyn, New York.

Gorski lived in the New Haven, Connecticut, area, and was married to the textile artist Bernie Gorski. Active from 1948 through 2003, Gorski's method and style developed throughout his long career. Gorski is widely known for his sports lithographs and self-portraits. His canvases deal actively with religion, politics, and human suffering.Megan James, Art Meets Scientific Theory in a Provocative Burlington Exhibit, Seven Days (Burlington, Vermont), July 20, 2011 Gorski's early work deals largely with his experiences in World War II while serving as a cartographer in the U.S. Navy. Later works deal with discomfort with the Vietnam war (\\"Ship of Fools\\"), sexuality (\\"The Rape of the Rose\\", and his own family life \\"The Child of Darkness\\". Gorski termed much of his work from the 1960s as his \\"Pain-Things Series\\". These paintings were exhibited nationally and internationally and hung alongside works by Robert Rauschenberg, Andy Warhol, and Elaine de Kooning. Later in his career, Gorski became very interested in the role of the athlete in society and created many art themed paintings, including \\"Blocked\\" and \\"Black Hawk Goalie\\". Gorski's last works dealt primarily with issues of disability, depicting autistic and developmentally disabled youths. Many of Gorski's works have been collected by Albert J. Levis and are now part of the permanent collection of the Museum of the Creative Process. Levis, a psychiatrist, worked closely with Gorski, using Gorski's canvases to articulate a theory of unconscious dynamics present within the creative process. In 2009, a Gorski retrospective was held at the Chaffee Art Center in Rutland, Vermont, titled \\"Stealing the Fire of the Gods\\". In 2011, the Art's Alive Gallery at Main Street Landing's Union Station in Burlington, Vermont, hosted the Gorski retrospective in an exhibit titled \\"Art as Evidence of Science\\".

Early life and education Alemayehu Weldemariam graduated summa cum laude with a master of arts in peace and conflict studies from the European University Center for Peace Studies, at Stadtschlaining, Austria, in April 2009, where he was also a fellow of the Salzburg Global Seminar. Besides, he was a fellow of the Academy for International Business Officials, in Beijing, China. Moreover, he received an LL.B degree from Addis Ababa University School of Law in July 2005. He was a guest scholar at the University of Chicago in November 2011 and lectured at Villanova University, outside of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and the University of California at Santa Barbara. He has been a scholar-in-residence at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs, University of Texas at Austin and Austin Community College. He is currently appointed as a visiting professor of government in the College of Arts and Sciences at Suffolk University. Career Weldmariam has taught various courses at Jimma University Law School, including constitutional law, criminal law, jurisprudence, and law of traders and business organizations. He has also served as the founding editor of the Jimma University Journal of Law and was head of the Research and Publications Office. Besides, he has served as project officer with the Organization for Social Justice in Ethiopia, legal advisor to the Ethiopian Chamber of Commerce, and regional director of the Ethiopian Global Initiative, contributor to the Horn of Africa Bulletin, a monthly publication of the Life and Peace Institute, based in Uppsala, Sweden, editor-in-chief of Addis Fortune, and a consultant on regional and national peace and security. Weldemariam has researched and published extensively on Ethiopian law, politics, national security and foreign policy, as well as regional peace and security. Moreover, he sits on the international board of the US-based Ethiopian Global Initiative and the Kigali-based Great Lakes Peace Network Foundation and is also a member of the Paris-based Global Editors Network, as well as A New Science of Virtues, which is a project of the University of Chicago, and also is an associate of the Jethro Institute for Good Governance, a London-based consulting organization He currently serves as a peer reviewer for such prestigious journals as the Melbourne Journal of International Law and The Journal of Borderlands Studies. Scholarship In his book, Legal Pluralism in Contemporary Ethiopia (2010), Weldemariam, following the tack taken by professor Andreas Eshete (PhD, Yale), defends multination federalism in line with the nonideal theory of John Rawls under unfavorable conditions. He contends that legal pluralism is an important federalist policy in a pluralist society such as Ethiopia. He does so by telling the story of the suppression of the diverse customary and religious laws in the country's recent past as part of the larger history of ethnic homogenization and state centralization. Since 1957, customary and religious laws had been alienated from the state legal system by virtue of the great influx of Western transplants providing the setting for competition between legal universalism and legal pluralism. In 1995, legal pluralism triumphs over legal universalism, as the 1995 FDRE Constitution recognizes the validity of customary and religious laws in personal and family matters. He analyzes the salient elements of legal pluralism in Ethiopia, argues for redrawing the frontiers of formal legal pluralism in such a manner as to include criminal matters, and points out the challenges. Professor Andreas Eshete described the work as one that \\"examined Ethiopia’s new experiment in federalism with care and fresh insight\\" Professor Donald N. Levine of the University of Chicago gives his testimonial in the following words: \\"Alemayehu’s work has prodded me to think afresh and offers facts, sources, and analyses from which I have learned a good deal. Indeed, regarding Ethiopia’s regime of ethnic federalism, he has prodded me to change my mind somewhat. That is not a bad litmus test of any scholar.\\" Professor Levine refers to him as \\"more of a social scientist- philosopher at heart than a lawyer, albeit an astute legal analyst.\\" In an interview with the Reporter (2008), the Amharic private bi-weekly, Weldemariam made an incisive analysis of Ethiopian politics and the role of political parties in the country as well as ethnic animosity in Ethiopian institutions of higher learning. Weldemariam's incisive analysis bears on the future of democratization in general and free and fair elections in particular in Ethiopia. Invoking Weldemariam's observation, Wondwosen Teshome (2009, 822)of the University of Vienna writes, “In fact, frustrated by the fragmentation of opposition parties and the refusal of many African incumbents to hand over power peacefully some political observers felt that unless the army stages a coup it is not possible to remove electoral autocrats democratically.” His work as human rights activist figures in prominently in his advocacy for freedom of the press, worship, conscience, and association. He also advocated for release of Judge Birtukan Mideksa, leader of Unity for Democracy and Justice, the major opposition party in Ethiopia, against the rise of authoritarianism, and his critique of the Ethiopian national security and foreign policy in many of his writings. He was nominated for the Lorenzo Natali Prize for Excellence in Reporting on Human Rights for the year 2009 for his Ethiopia: On forgiveness, reconciliation, and pardon, an article published in Sudan Tribune. Following the re-release of Judge Birtukan Mideksa from prison on 6 October 2010, he wrote a critical piece exposing the motive behind the decision and particular procedure selected for her release. He criticized the regime for harbouring an ill will to crush the morale of the judge not only by incarceration, but also by selecting procedures ill fitted for securing her freedom from prison like forcing her to confess and request for pardon as well as for being hell-bent on destroying her political career. In his The Unbearable Lightness of Pardon: Reflections on Birtukan’s Second Sailing, he contends that both of her sailings out of prison proved to all the unbearable lightness of pardons in Ethiopia. In spite of the inhumane treatment Birtukan received in the hands of her jailors, one thing that is certain is that she will remain to be a source of inspiration for all who work the betterment of the human condition in Ethiopia. In a series of articles, Weldemariam engaged in a constructive criticism of Ethiopia's national security and foreign policy in which he unmasked the incumbent's obsession with territorial security to the detriment of human security. More particularly, he criticizes Ethiopia for its military misadventures in Somalia in December 2006. He also prognosticated a possible cooling in the Ethiopian American relations as result of foreseeable diplomatic wrangles over the grim domestic human rights situation. His criticism never went without provoking an official response from the foreign policy establishment. A case in point is the publication of 'A Bogus Call for a Paradigm Shift-Ethiopia's Foreign Affairs and National Security Policy and Strategy', in A Week in the Horn, the e-weekly of The Ethiopian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In the official response, the Foreign Ministry wrote \\"Alemayehu Fentaw does not just miss these central elements of the Policy and Strategy instrument. He concocts facts and makes unsubstantiated allegations. One is the suggestion that US- Ethiopia relations would cool under the new US administration. In fact, as is obvious, the relationship between the two countries is thriving.\\" Publications Books *Legal Pluralism in Ethiopia: A Critical Introduction, Lambert Academic Publishing, Saarbrücken, Germany, 2010 Articles * \\"Is the specter of the Arab Spring haunting Ethiopia?\\", Open Democracy, June 4, 2012, * \\"Contributed to Donald N.

In 1819 another society was founded by Ludwig Berger, Bernhard Klein, Gustav Reichardt and Ludwig Rellstab and In 1884, Adolf Zander founded the still active men's singing club Berliner Liedertafel e.V. History The (original) Berlin Liedertafel of 1809 The first Berlin choral society also known as \\"Zelter Liedertafel\\", named after its founder Carl Friedrich Zelter, was the first male choral society of its kind and a model for similar groups. Composed of 25 men who wrote and performed works for each other, used Das Englische Haus (The English House) on Mohrenstraße as their meeting place. The (younger) Berliner Liedertafel of 1819 The 1819 \\"Younger Berlin Liedertafel\\" (or even younger Liedertafel of Berlin) founded by Ludwig Berger, Bernhard Klein, Gustav Reichardt and Ludwig Rellstab, continued tradition of popular choral music in the city. It differed radically from the elitist, romantic Zelter's Round Table, once it was also based on a democratic statute. Here the generation of young veterans of the World War I gathered, bringing their liberal and patriotic ideas. The (new) Berliner Liedertafel of 1884 In 1884 the new Berlin choral society, established by Adolf Zander, came to existence through a merger of several smaller choirs. The choir counted already with 117 singers by the end of the founding year. In the Wilhelmian Liedertafel era, the Berlin Liedertafel counted with more than 250 singers, being the largest male-voice choir in Germany. The choir took long trips abroad (Austria, Romania, Sweden, France, Baltic states, Italy, Russia, Egypt, the United States, Japan), and along with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra it gave great concerts. This society gave rise to another, the Lehrergesangverein of 1886.

Unified designation code was [Ha-31].Francillon p 376 Design and development The MK2A Zuisei engine was a 14-cylinder, supercharged, air- cooled two-row radial engine with a 140 mm (5.5 in) bore and 130 mm (5.12 in) stroke for a displacement of 28L (1,710ci) and a nominal power rating of 805 kW (1080 hp) for takeoff and 787 kW (1055 hp) at 2800 meters (9185 feet).Francillon p 376 Mitsubishi used the standard designation system to identify this engine while it was under development. The MK2 designation starts with the Manufacturer's assigned identification letter, in this case, \\"M\\" for Mitsubishi, followed by a letter that identifies the engine arrangement, in this case \\"K\\" for air-cooled, and then the sequentially assigned design number, in this case \\"2\\" for the second design. Revisions to the engine are identified by the letter following the preceding designation, with letter \\"A\\" being the original, or first, version.Francillon p 515 Mitsubishi also had a custom to name its engines with a short two syllable name that references objects found in the sky. The naming sequence started with this engine, the MK2 Zuisei \\"Holy star\\", and was followed in order by the MK4 Kinsei \\"Venus\\" and the MK8 Kasei \\"Mars\\".Francillon p 516 Variants ; MK2A Zuisei 11 : , 2540 rpm at takeoff, , 2450 rpm at ; MK2B Zuisei 12 : , 2540 rpm at take-off, 2540 rpm at ; MK2C Zuisei 13 : , 2700 rpm at take-off, 2600 rpm at ; MK2C Zuisei 14 Ha-26-I : , 2650 rpm at take-off, 2650 rpm at ; MK2C Zuisei 15 Ha-26-II : , 2650 rpm at take-off, 2650 rpm at ; MK2D Zuisei 21 Ha-102 : , 2700 rpm at take-off, 2700 rpm at , 2700 rpm at Applications * Mitsubishi A6M (prototype) Francillon p 376 * Kawanishi E7KFrancillon p 300 * Mitsubishi F1MFrancillon p 362 * Mitsubishi G5M1Francillon p 425 * Kawasaki Ki-45Francillon p 100 * Mitsubishi Ki-46 * Mitsubishi Ki-57Francillon p 184 * Kokusai Ki-105Francillon p 485 Specifications (MK2A Zuisei 11)  References Notes Bibliography * Matsuoka Hisamitsu, Nakanishi Masayoshi.

Kajaran ( ), is a town and the centre of the urban community of Kajaran, in Syunik Province at the south of Armenia. It is located 356 km south of the capital Yerevan, 25 km west of the provincial centre Kapan, and 50 km north of the Armenia-Iran border. As of the 2011 census, the population of the town was 7,163. As per the 2016 official estimate, Kajaran has a population of 7,100. Etymology The name Kajaran is derived from the Armenian word Kaj () meaning brave, and the suffix aran () referring to place. Thus, the word Kajaran is translated from Armenian as the place of braves. The name is derived from the nearby old village of Kajarants. It is believed that the old spelling of the name was Kachachut (), mentioned by Stephen Orbelian in his 13th-century work History of Syunik Province. In the late Middle Ages, the spelling was changed to Kchanants () which is still in use in the local accent of Syunik. By the end of the 18th and the beginning of the 19th centuries, the name Kajarants was also used until the mid 20th century, when the name Kajaran was officially adopted.History of Kajaran village History The area of Kajaran has been settled since the 3rd-2nd millenniums BC. The pagan temple found in the area testifies that. Metal was processed here since the Bronze Age. The old village of Kajarants -currently located 2 kilometers west of present-day town of Kajaran-, was part of the Dzork canton of the historic Syunik province of the ancient Kingdom of Armenia. Between the 10th and 12th centuries, the region was included within the Kingdom of Syunik. However, like most of the historic territories of Armenia, Syunik suffered from the Seljuk, Mongol, Aq Qoyunlu and Kara Koyunlu invasions, respectively, between the 12th and 15th centuries. At the beginning of the 16th century, the region became part of Safavid Persia. At the beginning of the 18th century, the Armenian population of Kajarants and the surrounding area was largely involved in the Armenian liberation campaign led by David Bek, against Safavid Persia and the invading Ottoman Turks. The Persians ruled until the beginning of the 19th century, many territories of Armenia -including Syunik-, became part of the Russian Empire as a result of the Treaty of Gulistan signed on 24 October 1813, between Russia and Qajar Persia. Under the Russian rule, the first copper mines of the area of Kajarants were exploited between 1850 and 1910. A copper processing plant was founded near the old village of Kajarants in 1850 by Greek engineers and workers. In 1868, the region became part of the Zangezursky Uyezd of Elisabethpol Governorate. Holy Mother of God Church in Kajaran, consecrated in 1912 Between 1918 and 1920, Kajarants was part of the independent Republic of Armenia. Later in 1921, it became part of the breakaway Republic of Mountainous Armenia under the commandment of Garegin Nzhdeh. In July 1921, the Soviet Red Army entered Syunik and the region became part of Soviet Armenia. After the discovery of huge copper deposits in 1930, the Soviet government proposed to build a large copper-molybdenum plant. By the end of the 1930s, a plan was proposed to build a settlement near the copper deposits area. The construction of the plant was launched in 1940, but soon after it was interrupted due to the World War II. In 1944, the construction process was resumed and the first product started in 1945. In 1951, the Zangezur state-owned mining company was formed to organize the production process, becoming one of the largest enterprises of the Soviet Union at that time.History of the Zangezur Copper and Molybdenum Combine In order to facilitate the copper and molybdenum production of the plant, the urban-type settlement of Kajaran was founded by the Soviet Armenian government in 1947, within the Kapan raion. As a result of the merger of Kajaran with the nearby settlement of Voghji in 1958, Kajaran was granted with the status of a town, with a population of around 11,000. The majority of the population of Kajaran were Armenian workers resettled from the town of Kapan and the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast.Kajaran community of Syunik Province In 1965, the major urban plan of Kajaran composed by architects A. Harutyunyan and H. Davtyan was approved. In 1970, the technical industrial development plan of Kapan and Kajaran was launched by the local Soviet government. With the independence of Armenia in 1991, a new administrative reform was applied in 1995, abolishing the raions of the Soviet period. Thus, Kajaran was included within the newly formed Syunik Province. The Zangezur Copper and Molybdenum Combine continued its operations after the independence until 1994, when it was ceased due to the post-independence economic crisis. In 2004, production was relaunched after the privatization of the plant. Nowadays, the Zangezur plant is one of the largest industrial firms of Armenia. In September 2013, President Serzh Sargsyan visited Kajaran to attend the opening ceremony of the Kajaran medical centre. President Serzh Sargsyan’s working visit to Syunik marz Geography Historically, Kajaran is located in the Dzork canton of the historic province of Syunik. The town is located on the border of two natural landscapes, alpine and highland forests at an average height of 1950 meters above sea level, on the banks of Voghji river, between the Zangezur Mountains and Meghri range. Mount Kaputjugh which is the highest peak of Zangezour Mountains at 3905 meters, is located few kilometers west of Kajaran. The relief is composed of placate rock strata of Araa river basin and is characterized by active erosion. Climate Kajaran is located in an alpine climate zone. The average annual temperature is +6,9C, with the absolute maximum of +33,5C and the absolute minimum of -18.5C. Annual precipitation level is 600-705mm, mostly occurring in May–June, when it reaches 99-104mm, with maximum daily level of 66mm. The average humidity is 69% with May being the most humid month of the year (74%). Mineral resources Kapan-Kajaran road Syunik is rich in mineral resources, including stone and ore resources. Armenia's biggest copper and molybdenum mine is located in Syunik. The mine was prospected in 1931, the exploitation started in 1952. The ore mainly contains molybdenite, chalcopyrite, magnetite and pyrite. It also contains valuable accompanying elements like gold, silver, rhenium, selenium and bismuth. Thick (up to 5m) quartz veins, containing significant amounts of molybdenum and copper are also quite common. The mine of Kajaran contains 87% of copper and 8% of molybdenum deposits of the region. The city is home to the Zangezur Copper and Molybdenum Combine. Water resources Kajaran belongs to the South Water Basin Management area. River Voghji (the length is 82 km, the catchment area is 1175sq.km) flows through the city; it starts from the confluence of Kajarants and Kaputjugh rivers, 6 km away from the Kajaran. Voghji is a typical mountain river with rugged stream bed and developed hydrographic network. It feeds both from thawing snow runoffs and groundwaters, with prevalence of one of its tributaries, Tzaghkari. It then flows into Arax river, at an altitude of 350m above sea level. Land resources The community is located at an altitude of up to 1950 meters above sea level. The soil is mostly gray and brown. Southern slopes are covered by typical alpine scrub grasslands with weak alpine turf soil. The total land area of the community is 1412ha, of which1342.59ha are owned by the community with the rest is public land. Biodiversity Kajaran is a part of Holarctis floristic province, Zangezur region, Voghji-Geghi area, characterised by prevalence of mesophytic, eurivalent and xerophytic plants. The area around the town is mostly covered by deciduous forests. The prevailing tree species are oak and hornbeam. Subalpine and alpine flora is represented by Gramieae, Poaceae Papilionacenae and Cyperaceae (feather-grass, brome-grass, cereals, sedge). The vegetation period is short. high humidity contributes to humus formation. Currently there are about 877 described plant species from 4 classes (Equisetophyta, Polipodiophyta, Pinophyta, Magnoliophyta), 57 families and 33 genera. The analysis of the local plant species confirmed that these include 4 Caucasian endemic and 2 Armenian endemic species. The habitats of the fauna in the area around the city include forests, sub-alpine and alpine zones with their characteristic flora. According to Dahl (1954) this area is a home to 2 described amphibia, 8 reptile, 52 bird and 16 mammal species. Deciduous forests are predominantly inhabited by small rodents; there are also bears, roes, wildcats, bats and other animals. Demographics According to 2001 census, the population of Kajaran was 8439. Men comprise 48%, women 52% of the population. According to the municipality data, the unemployment rate is 8.3%, of which 85% are women and 15% are men. There are 700 job seekers, which comprise 14% of the total labour force. The high level of female unemployment is due to the closure of weaving, relay and condenser manufacturing facilities, which used to employ the majority of women in the city. Insufficient supply of housing in residential blocks forces the population to purchase apartments outside Kajaran, in the nearby communities. The influx of job seekers also creates pressure on the housing market. There are 120 people registered as job seekers in the need of housing. The people in Kajaran belong to the Armenian Apostolic Church. The town's only church is the Holy Mother of God built in 1912. It is under the jurisdiction of the Diocese of Syunik based in Goris. The healthcare is served by the Kajaran medical center opened in 2013. Culture The Bronze Age fort of Napat dating back to the 2nd millennium BC is found 4 km west of Kajaran. A medieval cemetery is found at the eastern edge of the town. Kajaran has a small church built in 1912 on the foundations of a medieval church. The municipality of Kajaran runs a cultural centre, a public library, as well as an art school for children. Economy The Kajaran Mine operated by the Zangezur Copper and Molybdenum Combine The key economic sector of the town is mining. Kajaran is home to the Zangezur Copper and Molybdenum Combine, operating since 1951. The plant initially used subsurface mining method; in 1959 it shifted to open-pit mining and used it in the central section of Kajaran molybdenum mine to extract ore and produce copper and molybdenum concentrates. The plant currently produces 10 million tons of concentrate annually. The copper concentrate is transported to Alaverdi metallurgical plant and Armenian Molybdenum Production company in Yerevan for further processing. Final treatment of molybdenum takes place at Yerevan Clear Iron Plant. The Copper-Molybdenum Plant employs 3800 people. The labour market is rather lopsided. The industry sector employs 41% of the labor force. During the 1950s, people from Kapan, Goris and Nagorno Karabagh arrived in Kajaran in search of employment. There are 1120 retired citizens in Kajaran. The average pension size is AMD 12000. 94 households are beneficiaries of the family benefit system. There are 216 registered people with disabilities, including 19 with service-incurred disabilities and 64 with congenital disabilities. Education As of 2017, Kajaran is home to 2 public education schools and 2 pre-school kindergartens. The town is also home to the Kajaran technical intermediate college. Frequent awareness programs of ecology and environmental issues are presented by the municipality of Kajaran with the support of Zangezur Copper and Molybdenum plant. Sport Kajaran has a sports school served by a football training field located at the centre of the town. The Zangezur Copper and Molybdenum plant who are the owners of FC Gandzasar representing the town of Kapan, are the sponsors of the sporting life in Kajaran.

He is a co-founder and president of the charity The Urology Foundation (TUF), vice-president of the charity Prostate Cancer UK, trustee of the King Edward VII's Hospital and past chair of the Academic Board of the Royal Society of Medicine (RSM), of which, as of 28 July 2020, he is its president. Following his medical education and training at the St John's College, Cambridge and Middlesex Hospital, London, and with a distinction in surgery, he took various surgical posts in Cheltenham, Brighton, Wolverhampton, and Gloucester. He became a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of England in 1979 and after a travelling scholarship to the Duke University Medical Center, North Carolina, USA, he gained an MD and was elected the Hunterian professorship with a lecture titled \\"The Investigation and Management of the Neurogenic Bladder\\". In 1986, he was appointed consultant urologist at St Bartholomew’s Hospital, London, where he later took over from John Wickham and he subsequently became one of the first urologists in the UK to perform open radical prostatectomy for localised prostate cancers. In 1995, he became a professor of urology and Director of Postgraduate Education at St George's Hospital, London, and in 2005 he established The Prostate Centre in Wimpole Street, London, with the purpose of offering minimally invasive laparoscopic prostatectomy with a more holistic approach, advising on a wide range of men's health, including diet and exercise. An advocate of monitoring one's own personal PSA level and having spent his surgical career researching and treating prostate cancer, he was diagnosed and treated for prostate cancer himself in 2012, and featured in the 2013 \\"Tale of Four Prostates\\", where he was one of four surgeons who freely discussed the diagnosis, treatment and its implications, with the aim of dispelling its surrounding taboos. Early life and education Roger Kirby was born in Buckinghamshire, to Janet and Kenneth Kirby, a professor of biochemistry and fellow of the Royal Society, who worked as head of cell chemistry at what was then called the Chester Beatty Research Institute. He died in 1967 at the age of 49, when Kirby was 16. He attended Berkhamstead School for Boys, with his older and younger brother, where the three also played on the school’s rugby team. Surgical career Kirby graduated in medical sciences from St John's College, Cambridge, in 1972 and completed his clinical training at the Middlesex Hospital, London, where he was inspired by lead urologist Richard Turner-Warwick. He gained his MB BChir from Cambridge in 1975, with a distinction in surgery, the decisive turning point that led him towards surgery rather than cardiology. His first house job was at the Cheltenham General Hospital, where he worked with surgeon Peter Boreham, who encouraged him to pursue the field of urology and particularly prostate disease. Subsequently, he took up posts at Brighton, Wolverhampton, and Gloucester. His other teachers have included Ken Shuttleworth and Wyndam Lloyd Davies. He passed in the final Fellowship of the Royal Colleges of Surgeons in 1979. Kirby later described how a number of people in the 1970s had not heard of the prostate gland. During this time, he had attended to a number of people with large prostates that blocked urine flow and a number of people with inflammation of the prostate, which caused pain. When he did see someone with prostate cancer, only two basic surgical options were available on offer: removing the testicles or an operation that removed the middle of the prostate. In 1985, Kirby spent five weeks at the Duke University Medical Center, North Carolina, USA, on a Royal College of Surgeons Travelling Scholarship. He then gained his MD in 1986 from Cambridge. In the same year, he was elected the Hunterian professorship with a lecture titled \\"The Investigation and Management of the Neurogenic Bladder\\". It was published in the Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, where Kirby showed how the use of EMG could distinguish between people with pelvic nerve injury, distal autonomic neuropathy, progressive autonomic failure – multiple system atrophy, and idiopathic Parkinson’s disease, thus influencing the selection of people for surgery via the urethra. In 1986, as the PSA test was coming into use, Kirby was appointed consultant urologist at St Bartholomew’s Hospital, London, and later took over from John Wickham. He subsequently became one of the first urologists in the UK to perform open radical prostatectomy for localised prostate cancers. After watching American urologist Patrick C. Walsh at the Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, perform open radical prostatectomies for prostate cancer, while simultaneously preserving pelvic nerves, he became a staunch advocate of the procedure. In 1995, he became a professor of urology and director of Postgraduate Education at St George's Hospital, London. By 2005, using a suprapubic transverse incision, Kirby was performing around 130 of these operations a year. Most of these procedures were performed with colleague and anaesthetist Peter Amoroso, with whom they commonly introduced themselves as Batman and Robin. The Prostate Centre In 2005, Kirby established The Prostate Centre in Wimpole Street, London. He had previously been watching the development of robotic prostatectomies, which provided better vision of the pelvic nerves, and in 2005, for the purpose of performing laparoscopic prostatectomies, a da Vinci surgical robot was purchased by the Centre. This provided better vision of the pelvic nerves and at the age of 55, he became one of the first surgeons in England to use one. From 2005, the Centre therefore offered minimally invasive laparoscopic prostatectomy with a more holistic approach, advising on a wide range of men's health, including diet and exercise. Over the course of his surgical career, he has undertaken over 2000 radical prostatectomy operations, of which more than 750 were performed using the da Vinci robot. His high profile patients have included Corin Redgrave, Tony Elliott and Stephen Fry.

His fundraising activities have included climbing Mount Kilimanjaro, trekking in Nepal and cycling across the Andes. By 2005, he had completed three London Marathons. In 2010, he stepped down as chairman of Prostate UK to become trustee of the newly merged charity Prostate Action. The Prostate Cancer Charity founded by Jonathan Waxman subsequently merged with Prostate Action in 2012 to form one organisation under the title of Prostate Cancer UK, of which Kirby became Vice-president. He is also affiliated with the King Edward VII's Hospital, a charity-registered private hospital in Marylebone, west London. Some of his fundraising activities have been accomplished with his late colleague, John M. Fitzpatrick and in 2018, he hiked with Sir Marcus Setchell. Kirby's efforts to raise awareness of prostate issues have also involved raising significant funds for prostate charities. Awards and honours Royal Society of Medicine 1 Wimpole Street In 2005, Kirby was awarded the St Peter's Medal by the British Association of Urological Surgeons. In 2010, he was named one of the UK's Top 100 Doctors by The Sunday Times. Until 2015, he was council member, secretary and trustee of the British Association of Urological Surgeons. Subsequently, he was elected president of the urology section of the Royal Society of Medicine RSM for 2016/17. In 2016 he received the Royal College of Surgeons' Clement Price Thomas Award. In the same year, he stepped down from the board of trustees of the Urology Foundation and was subsequently made its life president, and took up the role of chair of the academic board of the RSM, In 2019, he was elected to become president of the RSM for 2020, succeeding Sir Simon Wessely. His inauguration as president of the RSM took place on 28 July 2020. Personal and family Kirby married Jane, who edited Country Living magazine before working as the business manager at her husband's clinic. They have three children including Joe Kirby who is a teacher and Vanessa Kirby, who is an actress. Health Kirby checked his PSA annually, constructing his own personal PSA slope which remained low. However, in 2012, at the age of 61, he noticed a rise and following a 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging, transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy and bone scan, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer and underwent surgical treatment for the condition he had treated throughout his surgical career. A Gleason 3+4=7 1.3cc adenocarcinoma was completely resected and he made a full recovery. Following treatment, he was one of four surgeons who freely discussed the diagnosis, treatment and its implications, and featured in a \\"Tale of Four Prostates\\" with an accompanying video in 2013. He stated that he “hope(d) that the openness about our own diagnoses and management will help to dispel the taboo that still haunts this most common of cancers of men”. Selected publications Kirby has published more than 350 peer-reviewed scientific publications, authored 68 books and founded two scientific journals: Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases and Trends in Urology and Men’s Health. He has also been an associate editor of the British Journal of Urology International. In The Prostate: Small Gland Big Problem, one section was written by Clive Turner, who had undergone a radical prostatectomy himself and subsequently counselled other men considering the same option. In his textbook Men's Health, dedicated to premature death in men, particularly his father, he, his brother Michael Kirby and colleague Carson Cully III, attempt to address the gender gap in mortality.

Founded by Roger Stern and Bob Layton, the CPL Gang eventually included Roger Slifer, Duffy Vohland, Tony Isabella, Don Maitz, Michael Uslan, Steven Grant, and John Byrne, all of whom later became comics professionals.  History   CPL  Layton and Stern began publishing the CPL fanzine out of Layton's Indianapolis apartment. Stern recalls that, \\"CPL started out as Bob's sale catalog. Bob was drawing the covers and including little reviews written by some of his customers.\\" By issue #5, CPL \\"... turned into a small 'zine with a catalog insert, and [Stern] started writing short articles for it. [He] eventually became an editor of sorts.\\" CPL featured a mix of articles, interviews, columns, art, and comics strips. In addition to CPL Gang members, contributors included established industry professionals like Gil Kane, Alex Toth, Paul Gulacy, Mike Vosburg, Dan Adkins, P. Craig Russell, and Joe Sinnott. Rog-2000, the John Byrne-created CPL \\"mascot,\\" went on to become a character in the Charlton Comics universe. CPL rapidly became a popular fan publication, and led to Layton and Stern forming an alliance with Charlton Comics to produce and publish a one-shot called Charlton Portfolio (actually CPL #9/10) in 1974, which included the unpublished sixth issue of Blue Beetle vol. 5 (1967 series). Twelve issues of CPL were published. An issue #13 was promised, but was never published.  Charlton Bullseye  The success of Charlton Portfolio convinced Charlton of the merits of a \\"fan\\" publication. During the mid-1970s, both Marvel and DC were publishing in-house fan publications (F.O.O.M. and The Amazing World of DC Comics respectively), and Charlton wished to make inroads into the superhero market, as well as \\"establish a fan presence.\\" Charlton gave Layton and Stern \\"access to unpublished material from their vaults by the likes of Steve Ditko, Jeff Jones and a host of others\\" for use in Charlton Bullseye, which published five issues from 1975–1976.  Professional springboard  Layton's association with Charlton (and the company's production manager Bill Pearson) in turn led to him becoming acquainted with the legendary Wally Wood, with whom he apprenticed.\\"All-Star Comments,\\" All-Star Comics #66 (May/June 1977).

Springfield, IL: Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, 2000. Biography Barrows was born in Oak Park, Illinois on March 28, 1928. He attended a community college in San Mateo, California and went on to complete a BA in Zoology at the University of California, Berkeley in 1949. He attended medical school at University of Southern California (USC) College of Medicine and completed his M.D. in 1953. He interned at Lennox Hill Hospital in New York city and subsequently served two years at Parks Air Force Base in California as a medical officer. Barrows returned to New York city in 1957 to complete his residency in neurology at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center. Barrows joined the USC faculty in 1960, advancing to the rank of Professor of Neurology. In 1971, he joined the recently founded Faculty of Medicine at McMaster University in Hamilton Ontario. It was at McMaster where he developed the PBL curriculum. A decade later, he was recruited to serve as the Associate Dean for Educational Affairs at Southern Illinois University (SIU) School of Medicine in Springfield, Illinois. At SIU he was instrumental in establishing a PBL track modeled after the Problem-Based Curriculum at McMaster. Under his direction, SIU became a center for the development of PBL teaching materials and faculty training. He played an instrumental role in creating the journal Teaching and Learning in Medicine and served as an associate editor for many years. He also established the Problem-Based Learning Institute in conjunction with the local public school district to promote the use of PBL in secondary education. After his retirement in 1999, Barrows and his wife Phyllis returned to Hamilton, Ontario. Over his long and productive career, Barrows was to receive a number of awards. He was the first recipient of the John P. Hubbard Award from the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) in 1984 and was later to receive the Abraham Flexner award from the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC). Innovations in medical education Early in his career, Barrows conducted basic research on clinical reasoning processes.Barrows HS, Bennett K. An investigation of diagnostic problem solving. Mathematical Biosciences (1972); 15:163-181.Barrows HS, Norman GR, Neufeld VR, Feightner JW. The clinical reasoning of randomly selected physicians in general medical practice. Clinical and Investigative Medicine (1982); 5:49-55. When he joined the Faculty of Medicine at McMaster, the undergraduate curriculum was just in the process of being designed. Barrows argued that the teaching of medicine should be organized in a way that emulates the reasoning of a skilled practitioner.Barrows HS, Tamblyn R, 1980.Barrows HS, 1985. Rather than presenting information to students in a decontextualized, discipline-based way, Barrows proposed that students should be allowed to engage new information in the context of solving authentic clinical problems. In the course of exploring a problem, students in a PBL curriculum identify deficiencies in their understanding and identify their own resources for redressing these deficiencies. This is thought to foster skills for lifelong learning. Traditionally, the assessment of student learning in medical education has relied almost entirely on written exams. But there would seem to be more to being a competent practitioner than could ever be assessed using a paper and pencil test. Barrows' pioneering work on training actors to serve as simulated patients opened the door to a new way of evaluating clinical skills. Simulated patients could be used to test the students' interactional and problem-solving skills.Barrows HS, Williams RG, Moy, RH. A comprehensive performance-based assessment of fourth-year students' clinical skills. Journal of Medical Education (1987) 62: 805-809. This kind of \\"performance-based\\" assessment has now been incorporated into national licensure exams for all U.S. medical students.van Zanten M, Boulet JR, McKinley DW, DeChamplain A, Jobe A.

John Molson Junior (October 14, 1787 – July 12, 1860) was a Canadian politician and entrepreneur. He served as director of Molson Bank, president of the Champlain and St. Lawrence Railroad (Canada's first railway), and president of Montreal General Hospital. He was the son of the founder of the Molson family dynasty in Canadian business. Life Born October 14, 1787, son of John Molson (1763-1836) & Sarah Vaughn (1751-1829), at Montreal, Quebec. Though he was apprenticed to the brewing trade and became a partner in the family brewery in 1816, Molson was primarily a financier. The family monopoly of river transport enabled him, as owner of the Swiftsure, to engage in profitable banking operations during the War of 1812, buying bills of exchange at heavy discount in Montreal and disposing of them at a profit in Quebec. He became a director of the Bank of Montreal shortly after its foundation and was vice-president of Molson's Bank from its incorporation in 1855. He was a promoter of the Champlain and St. Lawrence Railroad, Canada's first railway, and became its president in 1837. His other interests included the first Montreal water works and gas company, fire insurance and various industrial enterprises. He succeeded his father as a life governor, vice- president and president of the Montreal General Hospital. As chairman of the Constitutional Association he fought on the government side in the Rebellions of 1837 and was wounded; he was given the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel of the militia. In 1838-41 he was a member of the Special Council of Lower Canada. Marriage and children In 1816 he was wed to his first cousin, Mary Anne Molson (1791-1862), daughter of Thomas Molson (1768-1803) of Lincolnshire, England and Anne Atkinson (1765-1813).

A native of the town of Summerside, Ramsay entered the national scene in 2010 after forming a rink with longtime junior teammate Erin Carmody and veteran curlers Kathy O'Rourke and Tricia Affleck that captured the 2010 provincial championships at the senior level. At the 2010 Scotties Tournament of Hearts, the squad made it all the way to the final, but lost in the last match to three-time tournament champion Jennifer Jones. Career 2007–2009 In 2007 when her rink, consisting of Erin Carmody as skip, herself as third, Lisa Moerike as second and Jessica van Ouwerkerk as lead stone, captured the 2007 provincial junior curling championships with a perfect 7–0 record. They then advanced to the 2007 Canadian Junior Curling Championships, where they finished eighth out of thirteen teams. The squad took the provincial junior championships for a second time in 2008 and repeated their feat of a perfect record, before placing ninth out of thirteen at the 2008 Canadian Junior Curling Championships. Later that year the rink took the 2008 Codiac Curling Maritime Junior Bonspiel in the Under-21 category. In 2009 Moerike was replaced with Darcee Birch, and the team won the provincial junior championship for the third consecutive time. The squad had their best national finish at the 2009 Canadian Junior Curling Championships when they placed fourth, narrowly missing a spot in the semifinals. 2009–2011 In 2009 Carmody and Ramsay received a call from veteran curlers Kathy O'Rourke and Tricia Affleck, who decided to join forces with the younger players under a team skipped by O'Rourke, but with Carmody throwing the skip rocks and O'Rourke throwing second. Ramsay would throw third and Affleck would take the lead position. The squad found quick success by winning the 2010 Prince Edward Island Scotties Tournament of Hearts, which earned them the right to represent Prince Edward Island at the 2010 Scotties Tournament of Hearts. There they finished 8–3 in the round robin and eventually advanced to the final, where they lost against Jennifer Jones, who represented Team Canada as the competition's previous winner. 2011–current For the 2011-2012 curling season Ramsay, along with Erin Carmody, will play with Calgary skip Crystal Webster. Webster was looking for new teammates, as her third Lori Olson-Johns switched rinks to curl with Cheryl Bernard, and during the 2011 Scotties Tournament of Hearts, while sitting as an alternate for Shannon Kleibrink, asked Ramsay and Carmody to join her squad.

Singles are a type of music release that typically have fewer tracks than an extended play or album; during the 1950s, sales of singles in the United Kingdom were compiled by the magazine New Musical Express (NME), and published weekly as a record chart. The singles chart was founded in 1952 by Percy Dickins of NME, who wanted to imitate the hit parade that featured in the American magazine Billboard; before this, the popularity of a song had been measured by its sales of sheet music. Dickins sampled twenty shops, asking which their ten biggest-selling singles were. His aggregated list of sales was then published in NME on 14 November 1952 as a Top 12 chart. NME's chart is considered by the Official Charts Company (OCC) to be the canonical UK Singles Chart during the 1950s; it was expanded to a Top 20 on 1 October 1954. Sales of records significantly increased in the mid-fifties, following the birth of rock and roll. As a result, the top ten biggest-selling singles of the 1950s were all released in the latter half of the decade.

He is perhaps best known for creating the largest and most complete collection of Slovak folktales, Prostonárodnie slovenské povesti (Simple National Slovak Tales), self-published in a series of eight books from 1880 to 1883. Works The focus of most of his work was on folklore. He first published a collection of Slovak tales in Slovenské povesti (Slovak Tales) from 1858 to 1861 in 6 volumes, with a total of 64 stories. He followed this up with Prostonárodnie obyčaje, povery a hry slovenské (Simple National Slovak Customs, Superstitions, and Plays) in 1880, just five years before his death. In that same year, he also started publishing a series of volumes at his own expense of a more complete and larger collection of Slovak folktales, Prostonárodnie slovenské povesti (Simple National Slovak Tales). He would continue publishing more volumes of this work until 1883, bringing the total up to 90 stories in 8 volumes. As most of the folk and fairy tales were originally intended for an adult audience, Dobšinský had to edit out much brutality, eroticism and juicy humor, thus making them suitable for children and simultaneously helping them to be more popular.

Initially featured as a child dancer, Kamala appeared in almost 100 Tamil, Hindi, Telugu and Kannada films throughout her career. In the 1970s, she became a teacher of the Vazhuvoor style of dance in which she specialises.  Early life and career  She was born into a Brahmin family in Mayuram, India. Her sisters Rhadha and Vasanti are also dancers. At an early age Kamala began taking lessons in the Kathak dance style from Lachhu Maharaj in Bombay. She also took lessons in Hindustani classical music from Shankar Rao Vyas. She was discovered at age four by Tamil film director A.N. Kalyanasundaram Iyer when he attended a dance recital. He cast her in small roles in his films Valibar Sangham (1938) and Ramanama Mahimai (1939) where she was billed as Kamala. Her dancing was noticed by other filmmakers and she moved to Hindi films with Jailor in 1938 and Kismet and Ram Rajya in 1943. Kamala's mother moved to Madras so her daughter could train under the Bharatanatyam teachers Kattumannarkoil Muthukumara Pillai and Vazhuvoor B. Ramaiyah Pillai. Kamala's first role in a successful Tamil film came in 1944 with Jagathalaprathapan where she performed the Paampu attam. Kamala played a double role in her next film Sri Valli (1945) and also played Krishna in the film Meera. However, it was her film Nam Iruvar that would make an impact on Tamil cinema. Nam Iruvar was full of patriotism and Gandhian songs, and its dances helped to revitalize and legitimize Bharatanatyam. The film is credited with sparking a \\"cultural revolution\\" throughout the Tamil speaking areas of India. In 1953, Kamala was invited to perform for Queen Elizabeth II during her coronation festivities. In the late 1950s she toured internationally, performing in China and Japan. In 1970, the government of India awarded her the Padma Bhushan, India's third highest civilian award. She also taught dance for two terms at Colgate University after being awarded its Branta Professorship in 1975. In 1980, Kamala moved to New York City permanently and began teaching classical dance. She established a dance school in Long Island, Shri Bharatha Kamalalaya. In 2010 she received a National Heritage Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts for her contributions to the arts.  Personal life  She was married to cartoonist R. K. Laxman, but the marriage ended in a divorce in 1960. Her second husband, T. V. Lakshminarayanan, died in 1983. She has one son from her second marriage, Jainand Narayan, an officer in the United States Army.

Musical performance and stage productions were things he really liked early in life (and still does!). He attributes his grandmother's piano playing side by side as what started him down the music path as a youngster. Grandma Brown, who always wanted to be a Ziegfeld Girl, picked out melodies on the piano for four-year-old Johnny to sing. K-K-K-Katy, beautiful Katy/You're the only g-g- g-girl that I adore (Geoffrey O'Hara) rang through the Rodgers house in what one can only imagine were tenuous high pitched tones. Beginning in 7th grade, then high school, Johnny took ballet, tap (his parents set up a piece of plywood on the grass so he could practice) and jazz dance, voice, and finally found his way back to piano. His teacher, Mrs. Warren, assigned Bach. Johnny would show up with The Root Beer Rag by Billy Joel or an Elton John number. Every year he'd perform in musicals. Paula Wayne, who'd starred in Golden Boy (Lee Adams/Charles Strouse) with Sammy Davis Jr., was a valued mentor. At Carnegie Mellon Pre-College Summer Program, Johnny wrote his first song, We May Be Young, But We're Not Blind.

(1517 – in or after 1575) was an English clergyman and academic administrator at the University of Oxford. Marshall was elected Dean (head) of Christ Church, Oxford in 1553, a post he held until 1559. He was Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University during 1552–4. Life He is thought to have been the son of William Marshall, was said to be from Kent, and was a scholar of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, from 1532 till 1538. He graduated B.A. 5 December 1537, and his subsequent degrees were M.A. 5 October 1540, B.D. October 1544, and D.D. 18 July 1552. He became fellow of his college in 1538, but migrated to Christ Church about 1540, becoming a student there. At Corpus Marshall was Greek lecturer, and noted as a strong Roman Catholic traditionalist. He was one of the witnesses against John Dunne in October 1538. In Edward VI's reign he is said to have turned Protestant, and was vice- chancellor in 1552, but he changed his views under Mary I. He also dug up the body of Peter Martyr's wife in Christ Church, and had it cast on his dunghill. Marshall became dean of Christ Church in 1553, and is probably the Marshall or Martial who held prebends at St. Paul's and Winchester during Mary's reign. In 1554 he took part in the Oxford disputation on transubstantiation, was one of the witnesses against Thomas Cranmer, aided in the degradation of Nicholas Ridley. He almost caught John Jewel when he fled from Oxford after his recantation in the autumn of 1555. At Elizabeth I's accession Marshall lost his preferments. He retained powerful friends, as he had been domestic chaplain to Lord Arundell. He found refuge with Henry Clifford, 2nd Earl of Cumberland and Christopher Metcalf in the north. He was captured and brought to London, and signed a fresh recantation. Marshall then worked again as a Catholic priest, among the northern recusants. Finally he went into exile, in Leuven and Douai.

For every model year since the program's inception in 1999, Harley-Davidson has chosen a small selection of its mass-produced motorcycle models and created limited- edition customizations of those platforms with larger-displacement engines, costlier paint designs, and additional accessories not found on the mainstream models. Special features for the CVO lineup have included performance upgrades from Harley's \\"Screamin' Eagle\\" branded parts, hand-painted pinstripes, ostrich leather on seats and trunks, gold leaf incorporated in the paint, and electronic accessories like GPS navigation systems and iPod music players. Design and manufacture CVO models are produced in Harley-Davidson's York, Pennsylvania plant, where touring and Softail models are also manufactured. In each model year, CVO models feature larger-displacement engines than the mainstream models, and these larger-displacement engines make their way into the normal \\"big twin\\" line within a few years when CVO models are again upgraded. Accessories created for these customized units are sometimes offered in the Harley-Davidson accessory catalog for all models in later years, but badging and paint are kept exclusively for CVO model owners, and cannot be replaced without providing proof of ownership to the ordering dealer.

Born September 1, 1791, son of John Molson (1763–1836) and Sarah Insley Vaughan, at Montreal, Quebec. Thomas Molson was educated in private schools and apprenticed to the brewery trade. On becoming a partner in John Molson & Sons in 1816, he took over the management of the family's brewery operations. After an unprofitable venture into distilling in 1822, he withdrew from the partnership and settled in Kingston, Upper Canada, where he engaged in extensive brewing and distilling operations from 1824 to 1835. In 1836 he returned to Montreal to resume management of the family business. Under the firm-name of Thomas & William Molson it became one of the leading distilleries in North America. When William Molson retired in 1852 to establish Molson Bank, Thomas acquired sole ownership of the distilling interests and his son, John Henry Robinson Molson, became owner of the brewery. Thomas Molson was a benefactor of McGill University and the Montreal General Hospital. He also built a private church, St. Thomas, and a theological college. In 1816 he wed Martha Molson (1795–1848), daughter of Thomas Molson (1768–1803) and Anne Atkinson (1765–1813). Thomas and Martha had at least eleven children before her death in 1848.

Phillips, director of the Apollo crewed Moon landing program, to investigate schedule slippage and cost overruns incurred by North American Aviation, manufacturer of the Command/Service Module spacecraft and the second stage of the Saturn V launch vehicle. Phillips sent a summary of his findings with a strongly worded letter to NAA president Lee Atwood demanding corrective action be taken. North American revised its management of its Apollo contract items, and NASA management considered the matter a normal part of confidential agency- contractor relations. But after a fire killed the entire crew of the first crewed Apollo mission Apollo 1 on January 27, 1967, a United States Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences hearing overseeing NASA's investigation of the accident, led to the public disclosure of the Phillips Report by then junior Senator Walter Mondale, who was told of its existence by ABC news reporter Jules Bergman, who had seen a copy at NASA's Washington, DC Office of Manned Space Flight headquarters. Review and NASA's response From November 22 to December 6, 1965, Phillips headed a tiger team investigating the causes of inadequate quality, schedule delays, and cost overruns in both the Apollo CSM and the Saturn V second stage, for which North American was prime contractor. He gave an oral presentation (with transparencies) of his team's findings to his boss, NASA Office of Manned Space Flight Administrator George E. Mueller, and Mueller's boss, NASA Deputy Director Robert Seamans, and also presented them in a letter to North American president Lee Atwood, to which Mueller appended his own strongly worded letter to Atwood. Public disclosure and criticism Deputy Administrator Seamans, Administrator Webb, Manned Space Flight Administrator Mueller, and Apollo Program Director Phillips testify before a Senate hearing on the Apollo accident. Immediately after the fire in 1967, NASA followed its established procedure of investigating and identifying corrections for the cause, with Presidential and Congressional oversight. No one in NASA's upper management expected that the Phillips findings would be printed as a document, but this had been done and on February 13, Bergman was shown a copy at the Office of Manned Space Flight headquarters. He then told a junior Senator on the Aeronautical and Space Sciences Committee, Walter Mondale, about the document, and later reported its existence on ABC. Mondale proceeded to grill the top managers, including Webb who was completely blind-sided (the formal review had not gone above Seamans), about the report's existence. Other Senators, such as Margaret Chase, then questioned Webb about NASA's choice of North American as the Apollo contractor. Mondale said he had been told of the existence what he called \\"the Phillips report\\", and Seamans was afraid that Mondale might be in possession of a hard copy of the presentation, so he said tentatively that contractors have occasionally been given negative reviews, but that he knew of no such extraordinary report. Mondale raised controversy over the report, despite Phillips' refusal to characterize it as such before Congress, and was angered by what he perceived as Webb's deception and concealment of important program problems from Congress, and questioned NASA's selection of North American as prime contractor.On May 11, Webb issued a statement defending the selection. On June 9, Seamans filed a seven-page memorandum documenting the process that led to North American's selection in November 1961. Webb eventually provided a controlled copy of Phillips' memo to Congress. Seamans later wrote that Webb roundly chastised him in the cab ride leaving the hearing, for volunteering information which led to the disclosure of Phillips' memo. Senate conclusions The committee concluded in its final report that \\"the findings of the [Phillips] task force had no effect on the accident, did not lead to the accident, and were not related to the accident,\\" but in its recommendations, stated \\"the committee believes it should have been informed of the situation.\\" Freshman Senators Edward Brooke and Charles H. Percy jointly wrote an \\"Additional Views\\" section appended to the committee report, expressing a bit more strongly that the Phillips review should have been disclosed to Congress. Mondale wrote his own Additional View, voicing his complaints in the most strongly worded terms. In its final report, the committee agreed with NASA that the Phillips review had absolutely no bearing on the fire, though the chairman expressed his disappointment that Webb had not kept them informed of Apollo program problems at the time. But Mondale issued a minority opinion accusing NASA of \\"evasiveness, ... lack of candor, ... patronizing attitude exhibited toward Congress, ... refusal to respond fully and forthrightly to legitimate congressional inquiries, and ... solicitous concern for corporate sensitivities at a time of national tragedy\\".

He was the founder and President of Molson Bank, which was in 1925 absorbed by the Bank of Montreal. He was the son of the founder of the Molson family dynasty in Canadian business. Early life Born Nov. 5th, 1793, he was the son of John Molson (1763-1836) & Sarah Insley Vaughan, and was born in Montreal, Lower Canada. After 1828, William and his partner John Badgley were in the dry goods trade, and advertisements of iron pots, bake ovens, coal ovens, potash kettles, sheet iron and rosin were their staple, as well as foreign alcohols like Granada rum, Cognac and Bordeaux brandy. In partnership with his father, he operated the St Mary's Foundry, and did supply tools for the construction of the Rideau Canal. In 1831 the foundry was leased to Bennet & Henderson and it was the site of the furnishing of the Royal William, after her hull had been built in Quebec. William would later prove himself as more a salesman than a plant operator. On their own Au Pied du Courant\\" où on pendit les \\"Patriotes\\" de 1837. On 10 January 1836, the paterfamilias died. John Molson Jr. was disinterested in the brewery business, and hence left the field to his two brothers. Thomas Molson had earlier returned in 1834 from the self-imposed exile in Kingston, Ontario, to resume and expand the distillery business. In 1836, the aftershock of the shenanigans in the financial industry south of the border caused the Canadian government to suspend specie payments (with one intermission) from 16 May 1837 to 1 June 1839, during the economic crisis of 1837 and the Upper Canada Rebellion of 1837 and again the Lower Canada Rebellion of 1838. The younger brothers Molson filled the need with banknotes printed at their expense and printed on Wall Street. The cash-starved economy return sluggishly to life and the fledgling Molson Bank was enjoined by special decree from continuing to issue paper. The Molson Bank twice was denied government approbation. In 1843, William joined the board of directors of the Bank of Montreal. William sat on the board of directors of numerous railway companies between 1845 and 1850: the Champlain and St Lawrence Railroad Company, the Champlain and New York Railroad Company, the Montreal and New York Railroad Company, the Montreal and Champlain Railroad Company, the Lake St Louis and Province Line Railway Company, the St Lawrence and Ottawa Grand Junction Railroad Company, the St Lawrence and Atlantic Railroad Company, and the Grand Trunk Railway Company. The distilling works themselves burnt in January 1838, and an interruption of 10 months ensued whilst it was reconstructed. While the old brewery had housed seven 3,500-gallon kettles, the eleven 25,000-gallon containers were placed in the newbuild, which grossed over the next dozen years more than £400,000. In 1844, the brothers purchased from the receivers the Handyside distillery, which was located in the vicinity of their own. The property included cow barns and a piggery, and thus it was that the Molsons engaged in cattle finishing trade, for the which they used their spent grain. At this juncture, the firm employed roughly 75 men, and needed to purchase its grain supplies in Kingston, Picton, Port Hope and other ports in Canada West. Rye whiskey had become a staple. Packaging in bottles was begun. The partnership between William and Thomas, according to which they managed the brewery, had been fixed to a ten-year term in early 1838, soon after the fire. The brothers Molson agreed to a second contract on 1 July 1848. A break clause was inserted into the new contract, whereby advance written notice was to be given if William decided to exit the brewery. He exercised that clause in 1852, and did exit on 1 July 1853. He was bound to do so if he wished to pursue a career as a banker by the legislation allowing private banks because the 1850 law forbade bankers from pursuing all other trades. Molson Bank The official historian of the Molson firm writes that as a result of a disagreement with his brother Thomas as to the conduct of their joint distilling enterprise, William withdrew from this Molson family enterprise to establish Molson Bank in association with his brother, John Molson Jr.. Founded in 1853 and chartered by the provincial legislature in 1855, it was absorbed by the Bank of Montreal in 1925. William remained its first president until his death and was succeeded by Thomas Molson's son, John Thomas Molson (1837-1910). Other varied activities William was vice- president of the Montreal and Champlain Railway and a governor of the Montreal General Hospital (1868), being the third Molson to hold that position. Like his brother, he was a generous benefactor of McGill University, where the \\"William Molson Hall\\" was named in his honour.Molson: The Birth of a Business Empire, Douglas Hunter Family and legacy On 7 September 1819, in the Anglican Christ Church, Montreal, Molson married Elizabeth Badgley (1799–1887), daughter of Judge William Badgley. They had at least two children born at Quebec. When he died, he had 12 grandchildren. One of his two daughters married John Molson III, who was the son of his brother, and who became the next president of his banking concern.

Original to the point of uniqueness; Glasgow Herald,31 October 1991, and 'A Scottish nihilistic Catcher in the Rye' Kirkus Reviews.Book Review, Kirkus Review, 15 June 1998 Paul Golding, writing in The Sunday Times compared her favourably to Françoise Sagan, writing 'Morin exploits the same obsessively introspective, whimsically punctuated stream-of-consciousness technique, but she is a much finer plotter and a hell of a better swearer'.Golding, Paul, In the worst possible taste; The Sunday Times, 9 December 1991 Jackie McGlone of The Scotsman describes her 'wickedly entertaining pitch black novels' as being 'an ingenious blend of fact and fiction (full of epigrams and authorial apercus).’ Carole Morin On Fidel Castro And Evil Twins, Scotsman, 3 March 2013 She writes the Shallow Not Stupid Shallow Not Stupid column column in New York Arts and Fashion magazine Hint as Vivien Lash, the name of the main character in her fourth novel Spying On Strange Men. Biography Carole Morin was born in Glasgow. At 16 she became a 'Junior Diplomat' to the United States on an AFS Scholarship. She was Literary Fellow at the University of East Anglia when Lorna Sage (author of Bad Blood) was DeanMorin, C.; A Chapter of Disasters, The Herald, 29 July 1995 She was writer-in-residence at Wormwood Scrubs prison when it was Category A. She is one of the few writers to have had weekly columns in both the right of centre Spectator and left of centre New Statesman, according to the Scotsman she is the only writer to achieve this.McGlone, J; The queen of bad taste; Scotsman, 6 January 2002 She has also contributed to a number of other newspapers and magazines including the Financial Times, the Daily Telegraph and the Scotsman. She has lived in Kampala and Beijing and now lives in London. Early career Carole Morin's first impact as a writer was as a prize winner of the Bridport short story competition in 1984. John Fowles described her entry Thin White Girls as 'an intriguing blend of sophistication and innocence'. Fowles, J.; \\"Winning entries in the creative writing competition\\". Bridport, 1984. She followed this by winning the Stand short story competition in 1987, for which the judge was Angela Carter. Thin White Girls was subsequently published by Faber & Faber in their prestigious First Fictions collection along with her Stand-prize-winning short story \\"Hotel Summer\\"Morin, C.; First Fictions (Faber & Faber, 1989) later republished in The Herald newspaper.Morin, C., Hotel Summer; The Herald, 1 March 1997 Thin White Girls, like much of Morin's subsequent fiction, is narrated by a young female with a ruthless and unusual sense of humour. 'I think about toilets a lot,' she tells us, 'and how awful it must be to be a toilet.' This leads to the narrator writing a story at school from the point of view of a toilet. 'It was one of those stories where it's about the person telling it, so everything's \\"I\\", except the \\"I\\" hasn't to be yourself, if you see what I mean.' Her teacher is angry, 'But really I know my idea was much better' she continues, 'and when I'm out of her school I'll write about toilets as much as I like.' Patrick Gale writing in the Daily Telegraph called it a \\"witty recreation of the fierce ambitions and divided loyalties of childhood\\".Gale, P.; \\"Hungry Rats\\", Daily Telegraph, 5 Feb 1989 Morin's husband the writer Don Watson claimed in an article in The HeraldWatson, D; The Trials of Dangerous Don, The Herald, 27 Sept 1996 to have fallen in love with Morin before meeting her, when reading her story Serious Kissing in Serpent's Tail in the collection Sex & The City. Morin, C.; Sex & The City (Serpent's Tale, 1989) 'It had a strange, circuitous style to it,' Watson writes, 'which seemed as if it was always starting off to tell you something, but then veering off on some fascinating detour, so that you forgot where you were going in the first place. Then the ending pulled you up. sharp as a razor.' First novel: Lampshades Carole Morin's first novel Lampshades was published by Secker and Warburg in 1991. Largely set in a London and Glasgow that is almost, but not quite, recognisable as the landscape of the late Eighties, it tells the tale of a brave, verbally venomous but ultimately vulnerable sociopath called Sophira Van Ness. Sophira is, in the words of Alexander Linklater, writing in the HeraldLinklater, Alexander. Ibid'psychologically unhinged and fixated on Hitler'. Linklater also called the novel 'strange to the point of uniqueness' with a 'powerful and at times compulsive appeal'. According to the cover description, Sophira is 'fair and democratic: she hates everyone. The old, the fat, the poor, the black, the royal and the gay - all fall victim to her even- handed intolerance'. The book does seem to have a streak of racism and homophobia: \\"Looking at Nylon in real life makes me ill. Do I want to see him having his bum buggered by a big blackie jungle bunny through a crack in a toilet door\\" (Morin, C 1991p.17); but Sebastian Beaumont writing in the Gay Times (Feb 1992) says 'the invective is so rich and relentless that it is not offensive, but amusing instead. Morin has, by describing completely over-the- top prejudice, shown how absurd prejudice really is. ' He continues, 'This is a fascinating and macabrely funny book about misguided obsessions, and misplaced, erroneous concepts of purity. It is also extremely readable.'Beaumont, S.; Failing Family Life; Gay Times, Feb 1992 Grace Ingoldby, writing in The Independent, said, 'It is hard to resist quoting Lampshades at length, for Morin's first novel is so salty, has such stinging style. The worse she makes her Hitler-loving heroine..the more we like her.' Ingoldby, G.; \\"How to love a Fascist\\", The Independent on Sunday, 10 November 1991 Michael Porter reviewing the American edition in the New York Times, however, found the novel disquieting. '[Morin] seems intent on subverting any expectation that Sophira will abandon her ways or be punished for them'.Porter, Michael, Book Review; The New York Times Book Review, 18 October 1998 Second novel: Dead Glamorous Carole Morin's second book, Dead Glamorous was published in 1996. Opinion differs as to whether this book is an autobiography, a novel or somewhere in between. Maureen Cleave writing in the Daily TelegraphCleave, M.; \\"True Lies\\". Telegraph Magazine, 8 June 1996. implies that it inclines more towards fiction, 'She quotes Rudolph Valentino.' writes Cleave, '\\"There's no substitute for what you really want.\\" Except he never said that - she made it up.' 'Carole Morin has enough autobiography to last her a lifetime,' wrote Allan Brown in the Sunday Times, '90 per cent of it comprises Dead Glamorous - or at least the 90 per cent she claims to be true. The rest is obfuscation and exaggeration, designed to give her already improbable tale the sheen of some glorious myth.' Morin, in the same interview claims that critics' attempts to identify which part was invention were usually wayward. 'The clues are definitely in the book,' she said, 'but none of the reviewers got it right. They say, how can she expect us to believe this bit is true, when I know that it is.'Brown, A.; 'Carole Morin's second book is an unlikely family saga'. Sunday Times, 29 September 1996 Dead Glamorous tells the story of Maria Money and her relationship with her acquisitive mother and suicidal brother and with the alternative reality of the cinematic imagination. As Maureen Cleave puts it John's suicide 'haunts the book' as it builds towards a life-affirming conclusion. Alex Clark, writing in the TLS, said 'Her narrative voice is flippant, wise-cracking, streetsmart and hard as nails. Its brittleness sometimes stretches the reader to an almost unbearable degree before a compensatory piece of warmth, in the form of an abrupt confession, a piece of apparently unmediated emotion, is forthcoming.'Clark, A.; Times Literary Supplement, 14 February 1997 Third novel: Penniless in Park Lane Carole Morin's third book Penniless In Park Lane was published by John Calder in 2001. In a satirical depiction of London as the love affair with New Labour starts to cool, it tells the story of Astrid Ash. 'Astrid Ash is a bitch of the highest order,' says Paul Dale, writing in The List.Dale, P. Book Review of Penniless In Park Lane, The List, 29 Nov - 13 Dec 2001 'Part- time model, full-time swinging micro celeb, she lives with her millionaire boyfriend and corrupt New Labour MP Ginger. When he dumps her, she returns to her native Glasgow with her moaning mum and mealy-mouthed friend. Going stir crazy..she works out a ruse to smooth a return to Ginger's penthouse and wreak horrid revenge.' Ash is a different lead character for Morin, older and more vulnerable than her previous heroines, bringing a new dimension for Morin, but Penniless In Park Lane also has many of the same ingredients that readers responded to in Morin's earlier books, some vivid memories of childhood and a constant stream of one liners. Mark Stanton, writing in the Glasgow HeraldStanton, Mark. Book Review; Glasgow Herald, 24 November 2001 describes Ash as 'a vulnerable yet tough woman who rails against the mediocrity and hypocrisy which surround her.' Stanton quotes Ash, in a scene in which she visits an orphanage as striving for a ‘reason to organise a happy ending’, going on to say 'It is well worth hanging on to find out if Astrid's own ending is to be a happy one.' 'What a talented, funny and downright addictive writer Carole Morin is, says Paul Dale,Dale,P. Ibid describing Penniless In Park Lane as 'perfectly structured' and seeing in it 'shades of Wilde and Plath'. Friend and editor of Sylvia Plath, Al Alvarez described the book as 'funny, troublesome, rude, vindictive, sharp as a knife and elegantly written'.Alvarez, A. Postcard to author 20 Nov 2001; Author's collection Amanda Blinkhorn, writing in the Hampstead and Highgate Express described Penniless in Park Lane as a 'sharply observed modern satire on New Labour.’Blinkhorn, A. Profile of Carole Morin, Hampstead and Highgate Express; 9 August 2002 ‘Carole Morin gave up guilt for Lent,' Blinkhorn continues, 'and has no intention of succumbing to the temptation of wallowing in it again. In a world where women particularly are almost required to be overworked, overtired and overwrought, she is a refreshing, not to say alarming, beacon of decadence…with a teenager’s bafflement about the modern obsession with trying and failing to have it all….' Kim Millar, writing in the Evening TimesMillar, K. Book review; Evening Times, 24 November 2001 described Penniless In Park Lane as ‘Hard, cynical and so funny it actually made me cry,' going on to describe it as, 'a brilliant but strangely bleak book’. Fourth novel: Spying On Strange Men Carole Morin's fourth novel, Spying On Strange Men, was published by Dragon Ink in 2013. It tells the story of Vivien Lash, a glamorous artist with a mysterious diplomat husband who adores her. She spends her time gleefully tracking her ‘installation’, which is what she calls her 'creepy neighbour'. Spying on Strange Men begins as a comedy, 'illuminated by Vivien Lash's imaginative way of seeing the world'.http://www.carolemorin.co.uk 'She doesn't so much have a habit of seeking out the grotesquely funny, she just seems to act as a magnet for it. Then all of a sudden, like a summer night in a strange city, the reader realises it's getting dark, and the surroundings that seemed amusing a few pages back, are suddenly threatening.' Jackie McGlone in the Scotsman describes it as \\"Double Indemnity without the insurance policy, a love story gone very, very wrong\\".http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/books/features/carole-morin-on-fidel- castro-and-evil-twins-1-2818030 'It's a twisted love triangle about a woman who loves her husband but wants to kill him,' Morin expands http://carolemorin.co.uk/interview/ 'She's insuring her heart against him. And her boyfriend is really rich so they don't need the money to escape.' Richard Godwin Godwin, Richard; Interview with Carole Morin describes the book as 'a compelling, unsettling Noir novel written in sharp, elegant prose with scenes that move between surreal humour and a sudden darkness.' He goes on to praise 'Morin's ability to write characters whose identities are partly self-fiction or who are on the verge of psychosis'. Spying On Strange Men was also produced as an audio bookMorin, Carole Spying On Strange Men Audio Book with Morin reading the part of Vivien Lash and her husband Don Watson reading the part of James Lash. Performances Morin has performed her work publicly on many occasions. She made her performance debut at the South Bank Centre and has appeared there several times, most recently in September 2014. Performances of Spying On Strange Men, the first of which was at the Beijing Bookworm in June 2012, were always marked by an announcement that she would be reading in character as her \\"evil twin Vivien Lash\\".

It is used in Germany, Austria, and Luxembourg. Germany In Germany, the Abgeltungsteuer was introduced through the BGBl. I S.1912 that passed the German Parliament on 14 August 2007. The Abgeltungsteuer became effective on 1 January 2009.BMF, IV C 1 – S-2252/08/10004 Earlier tax law In 2009 the Abgeltungsteuer replaced the that had been effective since 2001. The had a procedure whereby taxable income was halved for purposes of dividend taxation. Fifty percent of income, as defined in article 3 number 40 of the Tax Act as amended in 2008, was exempt from income tax. Dividends and taxable capital gains from the sale of investments were taxed (if a certain exemption limit was exceeded) at only half the rate of income tax and . Profits from the sale of equity investments were not taxable if they were held for over a year. The half revenue procedure was moot as of 1 January 2009 with the passage of the new Abgeltungsteuer (Article 32 of the German Income Tax Act). Who is liable The taxation at the level of a shareholder (shareholders or partners) depends on whether the shareholder is an individual or a corporation: :*If the shareholder is an individual, the distribution as dividend falls under the Abgeltungsteuer with a flat rate of 25 % plus a 5.5 % solidarity surcharge. :*If the shareholder is a partnership, dividends and taxable capital gains from equity investments are 40 % exempt from taxation. (Art. 3 No. 40 German Income Tax Act as amended of 2009). This is called the and replaced the half revenue procedure for shareholders of partnerships. Accordingly, income from dividends and capital from the sale of company shares that are held as business assets are no longer subject to 50 % taxation (half income method) but now taxed with 60 % of the individual income tax rate. The revenue-related expenses can also be considered tax deductible of 60 %. :*If the shareholder is a corporation, dividends and taxable capital gains from equity investments are exempt from taxation (Art. 8 b Para. 1 German Corporation Tax Act).German Corporate Tax Act (Körperschaftsteuergesetz) In its tax assessment, merely 5 % of the dividends are added to profits as non-deductible operating expenses (Art. 8 b Para. 5 German Corporation Tax Act). Amount of withholding tax The Abgeltungsteuer is levied as a withholding tax. Private investor’s tax liability is settled. The already taxed capital gains are no longer recorded in the annual income tax return. Instead of taxing with the personal tax rate of taxpayers, their income regardless of their height is taxed with the flat tax rate of 25%. The legal basis for this was amended in the Unternehmensteuerreformgesetz of 2008 in Art. 32 d of the German Income Tax Act. The withholding tax rate according to Art. 43 a Para. 1 German Income Tax Act is 25% plus solidarity surcharge of 5.5% on the final withholding tax and possible church tax (8 or 9% of the flat tax). This makes a total of Abgeltungsteuer of 26.375% church tax excluded. The surplus income from capital assets cannot be shortened by the overall deductions through lump sum or actual expenses. In their place, the saver's allowance in the amount of 801 € will be used as deduction (Art. 20 Para. 9 German Income Tax Act). However actually there are several decisions in court to rule on that restricted deduction possibility.FG Niedersachsen (Az. 14 K 335/10), FG Niedersachsen (Az. 15 K 417/10), FG Münster (Az. 6 K 607/11F) What is taxable Taxable current income Among the investment income are (Art. 20 Para. 1 German Income Tax Act): :*dividends :*interests :*income from investment funds and certificates :*nearly all earnings from capital assets :*private capital gains :*covered options and other payments from securities and derivatives This means, profits which have been recorded and taxed only in the context of speculation are now already taxable for a holding period of more than one year. Taxable private capital gains Taxable private capital gains are (Art. 20 Para. 2 German Income Tax Act): :*the sale of shares of a corporation (stock or share of business) :*the sale of coupons (dividends or interest) :*the profit of forward transactions :*the sale of a stake on a company or a quiet participating loan :*the transfer of rights on mortgages, mortgages and pensions :*the sale of a capital life insurance and :*the sale of other capital assets or a position of right Exemptions from the tax deduction The rules for the Abgeltungsteuer do not apply for the following: :*interest payments by corporations to shareholders with a participation of 10% or more, for back to back financing and loans between related parties. In those cases the earnings will be taxed with the individual tax rate. :*gains from sale of shares in corporations, if the seller has been involved within the last five years at least with 1% of the capital. The income from business operations are subject to corporation tax and are taxed with the partial income method. :*capital gains incurred in the course of a business activity. :*at request for capital gains from investments in a corporation. The participation must be at least 25%, in professional work for the corporation 1% is enough. The request applies for the following four tax years unless it is revoked. After withdrawal of the application a new application for the same stake in the corporation is no longer possible. Upon successful application the partial income method applies. Alternatives Investment income upon which flat rate tax was withhold, do not have to be declared in the annual income tax return. Only if church tax has not been withhold or the personal income tax rate is below 25%. A tax refund on the difference between the tax rates is possible (Art. 32 Para. 6 German Income Tax Act). This makes sense when the personal tax rate of the income is below 25%. The intention was that the income on investment income will not be taxed higher than their other income. A withdrawal of actual costs associated with private capital gains is however no longer permitted, the saver's allowance in the amount of 801 € will be used as deduction. Losses Losses are considered as follows: :At first, positive and negative income will be charged. (e.g. dividends, interests income from investment funds and certificates). Losses from sale of shares can only be charged against gains from selling shares. Any remaining loss is carried forward by the bank on either next year or, at request of the customer be certified and may be used by other banks where the individual has positive investment income. Losses that occurred before 2009 can be charged up to 2013 with capital income. Foreign investment income Investment income that was generated abroad also falls under the Abgeltungsteuer. The Federal Republic of Germany concluded with many countries double taxation agreements so that the regulations differ from each country to country. The aim is to avoid that one taxpayer is charged with similar taxes more than once on the same income for the same period. Though the Abgeltungsteuer is not applicable in foreign countries, the taxpayer has the responsibility to declare the income for taxation at the local tax office. Foreign taxes on capital gains are only chargeable up to a height of 25% according to German Income Tax Act (Art. 43 a Para. 3). Nevertheless, there can be possibility that losses from other securities transactions are added to the original loss. That leads to a paid tax on capital gains of more than 25% seen over the entire calendar year. Such a negative surplus will not been refunded by the tax authorities and is also not transferable to the following years. Advantages and disadvantages *Taxpayers with middle and higher income who mainly receive income from capital gains have usually an advantage from this new method of taxation. The reason is the low flat rate of 25% instead of being taxed with the personal income tax rate. In Germany the highest personal income tax rate is 45%. Taxpayers with a small income have no disadvantage because of the alternative of being taxed with their personal income tax rate (see above). The lowest income tax rate starts at 14%. *Another advantage or disadvantage depending on the view is the taxation of the sale of capital gains. Equity and investments funds are getting more unattractive through this kind of taxation. That only counts for new investments that were bought from 1 January 2009 on. All shares that were bought before that date do not fall under the new Abgeltungsteuer and are tax free when they were held more that 12 month. *The flat rate tax rate of 25% is significantly lower than the highest income tax rate. Advantages on apply for investors whose marginal tax rate on the remaining income is equal or higher than the flat tax rate. There might be a breach of the principle of taxation based upon the competitiveness of the taxpayers. Before 2009 gains from capital income were taxed with 45% and from 2009 on are taxed with 25% plus 5.5% solidarity surcharge and church tax. That is the same for taxpayers with a personal income tax rate of 27%. *The Abgeltungsteuer on capital gains leads to different taxation in comparison to the other income taxes that are based upon the personal tax rate (so called dualistic income taxation). Austria In Austria, a withholding tax on capital income took effect on January 1, 1993. The legal basis for the tax is the Austrian final taxation law (Endbesteuerungsgesetz). Luxembourg Since 2006, taxpayers who have tax liability in Luxembourg have been subject to a 15% flat rate withholding tax on interest income. For nonresident EU citizens who receive interest income from Luxembourg, a 20% tax rate applied through 30 June 2011, rising to 35% as of 1 July 2011 under the European Directive on the taxation of savings interest income.

The area is characterized by houses built during the interwar period, with many trees and green spaces.  History  The local council had originally planned to build a park on the site, however it was later agreed the area was more suitable as a residential area to accommodate the growing number of people working in the city center. Construction began in 1924, with the first buildings designed by several architects including Antoni Jawornicki, Aleksander Sygietyński, Wacław Weker and Teofil Wiśniowski, in the neoclassical style. By the 1930s, however, a more modernist style was incorporated into the estates design. During the Warsaw Uprising, between August 4 and 25, 1944, residents of the estate were embroiled in the so-called Ochota massacre, a series of mass murders, robberies and other crimes perpetrated primarily by the S.S. Sturmbrigade R.O.N.A., an anti-partisan group from Russia. An estimated 10,000 Ochota residents were murdered during this period.

In Years 12 and 13, the school offers the accredited IB Diploma Programme. The British School is the only school in Quito to offer, in English, all of the “Higher Level” IB programmes of Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry and Biology. The school curriculum is taught in English. The curriculum is the British National curriculum from Key Stage 1 to Key Stage 4, this includes the internationally recognised Cambridge iGCSE examinations. The school teaches Spanish, has a Spanish as a Second Language department, English as an Additional Language department, and geography. History The British School of Quito was conceived by Ambassador Richard Lavers in 1994 when he arrived to find that Ecuador was one of two countries in South America without a British school. The school was created under a bilateral agreement signed on 9 June 1995 by the Government of the Republic of Ecuador and Her Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom. This agreement established The British School Quito with the Foreign Ministry of Ecuador, within the framework of a broader cultural agreement between the two countries. In September 1995, BSQ started with 26 pupils. Sylvia Harcourt, current President of the Board of Trustees, was a member of the school community from its very beginning. From 1995 to 1997, numbers increased dramatically to the point that the school had to move to larger premises in Tumbaco. During 1999, the school built the classroom block below the swimming pool, purchased several prefabricated classroom buildings and modified the main building. Student Council Each year students from high school vote for The British School Student Council. The BSSC is a group of representatives for high school that run activities and organize events in the school and outside it. Candidates from the Student Council come from Year 11 to Year 13. Student Council organised events have included Fiestas de Quito with the ‘Cuarenta’, Valentine’s Day and Jeans Day. The money raised in these events helped non-governmental organisations and charities like The Book Bus, Hospital ‘Baca Ortiz’ and ‘Mother Teresa’Retirement House. The Student Council has membership of the ‘Red de Consejos Estudiantiles’ (Student Councils Network). The ‘Inter-Schools Rose Mail’ was the first event coordinated with other student councils for Valentine’s Day. Future projects include the design of 'hoodies' to supplement the school uniform and the improvement of the Secondary Library by equipping it with better technology. Artistic support Each year the school in conjunction with the Secondary students drama company - Tiny Piano Productions - organise the annual dramatic production. Students have performed plays such as: Romeo and Juliet, Casablanca, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, The Crucible and Rope.

Early life and education Caroline Maria Seymour was born on January 12, 1820, in Canandaigua, New York, the daughter of a banker, Orson Seymour, and his wife Caroline M. Clarke. Caroline's father died in 1824, and the family relocated to Auburn, New York. A strict Presbyterian uncle had an outsized influence over Caroline. Caroline attended the Upham Female Seminary in Canandaigua and Miss Almira Bennett's Boarding School in Owasco Lake, New York. She graduated as valedictorian from Miss Record's Female Seminary in 1835 at age fifteen and served on the faculty of Auburn Female Seminary. For a short time she taught at Mrs. Luther Halsey's boarding school for girls on the Ohio River below Pittsburgh.  Marriage to T.C.  In 1840, Caroline married Theodoric C. Severance, (nicknamed T. C.), an abolitionist banker from Cleveland, Ohio. T.C. and Caroline had five children between 1841 and 1849, one of whom died in infancy. The pair initially settled in Cleveland, and their home became a meeting place for those interested in liberal causes. The couple left the Presbyterian Church soon after marrying and formed the Independent Christian Church, whose members were anti-slavery. The couple left Cleveland and resettled in Boston, Massachusetts in 1855 and, inspired by the sermons of Theodore Parker, joined the Unitarian Church.  Women's rights and women's clubs  After hearing lectures by Ralph Waldo Emerson and Bronson Alcott, Severance became increasingly committed to social justice and peace. In 1853, after several years of attending and speaking at conventions on behalf of woman's rights, she made her first appearance as a speaker to the general public with a speech to Cleveland's Mercantile Library Association, the first lecture delivered there by a woman. Her subject was \\"Humanity: A Definition and a Plea\\", by which she meant that women should be included as part of \\"humanity.\\" It was a radical idea, but the speech was well received by the audience, and by the Cleveland press. That same year, she presided over the first annual meeting of the Ohio Women's Rights Association. In 1854, Severance was elected, alongside her husband, to offices for the Fourth National Women's Rights Convention in Cleveland, and testified to the Ohio Legislature in favor of women holding their own inherited property and earnings. Severance had many other firsts. She was the first woman member of the Parker Fraternity Course, as well as the first woman to give a lecture in Boston before the Lyceum Association. Shortly after the Civil War, Severance joined the faculty of the Dio Lewis School in Massachusetts, teaching practical ethics. Severance's ethics were tested when a Black girl asked to be admitted to the school and was denied, the school citing parent objections. Severance helped establish the New England Women's Hospital. She also campaigned with Susan B. Anthony against the inclusion of the word \\"male\\" in the Fourteenth Amendment. In the winter of 1867-1868, Severance established the first woman's club in the United States: the New England Women's Club. Ralph Waldo Emerson, James Freeman Clarke, Octavius Frothingham, and Julia Ward Howe were all invited to speak at the Club's first public meeting. In its first years, the Club awarded scholarships, provided educational opportunities for women, backed the kindergarten movement, and campaigned for the appointment of police matrons. As a result of the rift between suffragists, Severance, along with Lucy Stone and other New England suffragists, founded the American Woman Suffrage Association at a Cleveland convention in 1869. Los Angeles and First Unitarian Church of Los Angeles In 1875, for various reasons which included her husband's health and the fact that her two older sons had moved to the West Coast, she relocated with her husband to Los Angeles, buying a tiny home on West Adams Street which they called \\"Red Roof.\\" Both Caroline and T. C. Severance had a major impact on the development of Los Angeles. Together they founded the First Unitarian Church of Los Angeles in 1877. T. C. was a founder of the Orphan's Home Society, and the Horticultural Society. Caroline began organizing the women of the rapidly growing community. She brought the kindergarten movement to Los Angeles, serving as president of the city's Free Kindergarten Association, and helped establish the Los Angeles Public Library. In 1878 she founded the first Los Angeles Women's Club. Her interests were far ranging, from woman suffrage to historic preservation [working with Charles Lummis] to world peace. As she grew older, she began to be considered the elder stateswoman of women's rights movements in the city. She also became more radical in her thinking, and was active in the city's Christian socialist movement at the turn of the 20th century. She began to be referred to in the press as \\"Madame Severance\\", an indication of her prestige and position in the city. With two of their children still in the east, Caroline and T. C. Severance had never lost their love of Boston, although they became passionate advocates for their newly adopted home. At first they returned regularly to the east, and without Caroline's immediate leadership, the Los Angeles Women's Club twice failed. Finally, in 1881, she established a lasting institution, the Friday Morning Club, devoted to cultural and social betterment and civic reform. As reported by Leonard Pitt and Dale Pitt in their book Los Angeles: From A-Z, \\"[The Friday Morning Club] ran a lending library, maintained an employment bureau, and conducted classes.\\" It became one of the most powerful and prestigious organizations in the city. Caroline Severance (1898) After her husband's death in 1892, Caroline Severance changed the name of her home to \\"El Nido\\", which is Spanish for \\"the nest\\". Situated in a tree-shaded garden, El Nido was a gathering place for men and women devoted to social change. In 1906, Ella Giles Ruddy wrote in The Mother of Clubs: “For more than thirty years this hospitable home has been a rendezvous for literary people visiting Los Angeles, for leaders in progressive thought . . . in whatever direction it may tend, and for men and women interested also in local or municipal reforms and improvements. The title \\"Mother of Clubs\\" has been supplemented by that of the \\"Ethical Magnet of Southern California ...\\" Women's right to vote in California Caroline M. Severance (1903) In 1911, when Californian women achieved the right to vote, Caroline Severance was lauded as the spiritual leader of the suffrage movement in Southern California, although her advanced age had limited her participation in the campaign. She was featured in every Los Angeles newspaper the day after the election. Although it has often been written that she was the first woman to register to vote in the state, this is not true. In fact, she registered a week after the election, when a registrar came to her home. She did, however, go to the polls the following year to vote in the presidential election, and in 1912, at the age of ninety-two she cast her vote for president, having worked for woman suffrage for more than sixty years. Although she told the press that she had voted for Theodore Roosevelt, it is just as likely that she voted for the Socialist candidate. As Joan Jensen wrote in Women in the Life of Southern California, \\"By the time she died in 1914 she was firmly committed to a new radicalism. Had she lived on through World War 1, perhaps she would have been classed as a 'parlor Bolshevik,' dangerous pacifist, and pro-laborite, and her home watched carefully by members of the many Loyalty Leagues of Los Angeles.\\"  Death  Severance died on November 10, 1914 at the age of 95.

The cartoon follows Goofy on an ill-fated vacation trip traveling cross country. It was directed by Jack Kinney and features the voices of Pinto Colvig as Goofy and Alan Reed as the narrator and a hitchhiker. Plot Goofy is seen in a crowded office dreaming about his coming paid vacation. He plans \\"fishing at Fond du Lac, sunrise in the Rockies, basking on the beach, dude ranching, golfing, boating, and hunting in the North Woods.\\" As soon as the clock strikes 12 noon, Goofy races outside the office building to his red car and heads out on the highway. From this point, the film follows a series of vignettes showing Goofy's many travel problems, all accompanied by sarcastic comments from the narrator. The first problem Goofy faces is getting stuck behind a white slow-moving travel trailer pulled by a yellow car that he can't seem to pass. The same trailer continues to follow Goofy, yet always remains one step ahead of him and causes most of his problems. The first time Goofy tried to pass it, a milk bottle falls off the trailer's platform and damages his car's tire and motor and is forced to go to a workshop to get it fixed. The owner digs through the car's engine, throwing out random parts until he takes out the motor and claims that he needs a new one before throwing it into a trunk. After the motor is fixed, Goofy pays the owner, but the workshop then closes for two weeks before Goofy can ask him to fix the tire and is forced to do it himself. The trailer comes by while he's working. After getting his car fixed, Goofy races through the desert and comes across a traveler and offers him a lift but he refuses after noticing the car's poor qualities (such as lacking a radio, a heater, a better paint job, and thicker tires). Goofy passes a traffic light which is on \\"stop\\". He managed to stop a few distances behind it and quickly goes back in front of it. While waiting, a rain cloud shows up and pours water over Goofy's car. At the same time, the traffic light switches to \\"go\\" and the trailer passes him. In response, Goofy tries to pass it a second time, but dust is swept out the trailer's door, clouding Goofy's sight. This also causes him to drive off the road and into a tree, allowing the trailer to pass him again. It was then nighttime and Goofy tries to find a place to sleep. He comes across a sign and after striking a match in an unsuccessful attempt to read the sign, he lifts his car with a carjack to shine it's headlights on the sign so he can read it. The signs points out that there are hotels further down the road and further back the way he came. He then chooses to turn around and notices that all hotels have no vacancy except one. However, his car runs out of gas before he can reach it and worst of all, the trailer has taken the extra spot in the hotel. Goofy pushes his car to a gas station, but it suddenly rolls down a hill, leading him to a hotel that has a beautiful designed house which reveals to be a fake display in front of a plain cabin. He stays there for the night, but was forced to leave when a train wakes him up. A really tired Goofy travels through the night, being stunned by passing cars along the way. He once again encounters the trailer and can see people partying inside of it and is nearly hit by a truck when he tries to pass it again. He is finally able to pass the trailer by driving on a cliff wall, but when he yells at the driver, he is alarmed to see no one driving the car. He speeds away to avoid the car and trailer which is running out of control. Goofy is then knocked out of his car and into the trailer's car. After he notices that he's driving the trailer, he sees his own car slowing down while he passes it and is caught by a policeman. He is then arrested for speeding and is finally seen in jail, but happy for having found the \\"perfect haven for rest and relaxation.\\" Releases *1952 - Original theatrical release *1957 - Disneyland, episode #4.11: \\"How to Relax\\" (TV) *c. 1983 - Good Morning, Mickey!, episode #35 (TV) *1984 - \\"Cartoon Classics: Sport Goofy's Vacation\\" (VHS) *1992 - \\"Cartoon Classics - Special Edition: Happy Summer Days\\" (VHS) *1998 - The Ink and Paint Club, episode #1.43: \\"On Vacation\\" (TV) *2002 - \\"Walt Disney Treasures: The Complete Goofy\\" (DVD) *2005 - \\"Classic Cartoon Favorites: Extreme Adventure Fun (DVD) References External links Two Weeks Vacation at The Encyclopedia of Animated Disney Shorts *Roadside Disney: Trailer Tales from 2719 Hyperion, essay on the topic of travel trailers in Disney films; May 6, 2008 Category:Goofy (Disney) short films Category:Disney animated short films, 1950s Category:American films Category:American road movies Category:1952 animated films Category:1952 films Category:Films directed by Jack Kinney Category:Films produced by Walt Disney Category:Films scored by Oliver Wallace ","title":"Two Weeks Vacation"},{"id":"32541732","text":"Martin Jim Aitken FRS (11 March 1922 – 13 June 2017) was a British archaeometrist.

The film is their feature film directorial debut and is distributed by IFC. The film features music by a variety of local Vancouver acts such as Craig James, Fake Shark - Real Zombie! and CJ Wallis. Plot Badass (Sylvia Soska), Geek (Jen Soska), and Badass's friend, Junkie (Rikki Gagne), pick up Goody Two-Shoes (CJ Wallis) from his church youth group. Afterwards, they plan to purchase drugs for Badass and Junkie. They discover the dead body of a sex worker in the trunk of the car. Badass and Junkie had been partying the previous night, and do not recall if they killed her. They decide to dispose of the body. They stay the night at a motel for free, after convincing the motel owner that the sex worker is alive and will exchange sex for the room. Geek calls the police to report her sister for multiple crimes, including having a dead body and drugs in her trunk, as well as an illegal firearm. The police arrive at the motel to question Badass, but offer to let her go in exchange for sexual favors. She knocks them out, handcuffs them together naked, and leaves. She and Geek argue about Geek calling the cops; Badass knocks her out with a punch to the face. They purchase drugs and use them to pass the time until it is dark enough to transport the body. A street gang assaults the dealer's house, targeting Junkie and the dealer. Badass hears the fighting from outside the house. She rescues Junkie and shoots everyone else inside. Geek tries to call the cops, but an unidentified figure knocks out her right eye with a baseball bat. The four friends escape in their car. They stop to look at a map. Junkie's arm, which was seriously injured in the fight, is torn off by a passing semi-truck. Goody Two-Shoes is able to sew it back on, and Geek's empty eye socket is covered with an ‘X’ of electrical tape. They try to bury the sex worker, but she sits up, alive. Badass instinctively hits her in the head with a shovel, killing her. Frightened and unnerved, they flee the scene. The next day, they are attacked by the sex worker's pimp. Badass kills him. Geek and Badass have another argument, and the four friends separate. Badass drops off Junkie at a hospital. Geek and Goody Two-Shoes take separate cabs, but both end up at the sex worker's house. They rescue the sex worker's dog, and learn about a serial killer who has been murdering sex workers. Retrieving Junkie from the hospital, they meet Badass at the sex worker's house. They see someone who matches the killer's description and they capture him. Geek and Badass torture him to death with power tools. The man they kill is not the serial killer, however. The real serial killer is revealed to be Goody Two-Shoes’ priest. He was maimed by a botched circumcision, leaving him with a forked penis. A frequent customer of sex workers, he was enraged by their reactions to his deformity, and killed them. He kidnaps and tortures Badass. Geek, Junkie, and Goody Two-Shoes try to rescue her. The priest tries to escape, and they chase him. Geek is knocked to the ground. The priest threatens to rape her empty eye socket, but Badass rescues her twin. They set the priest on fire. The four friends dispose of the sex worker's body by dumping it into the ocean. Geek and Goody Two-Shoes kiss, and Badass suggests they all deserve a vacation.

Ligand efficiency is used in drug discovery research programs to assist in narrowing focus to lead compounds with optimal combinations of physicochemical properties and pharmacological properties. Mathematically, ligand efficiency (LE) can be defined as the ratio of Gibbs free energy (ΔG) to the number of non-hydrogen atoms of the compound: :LE = (ΔG)/N where ΔG = -RTlnKi and N is the number of non-hydrogen atoms. It can be transformed to the equation: :LE = 1.4(-logIC50)/N  Other metrics  Some suggest that better metrics for ligand efficiency are percentage/potency efficiency index (PEI), binding efficiency index (BEI) and surface-binding efficiency index (SEI) because they are easier to calculate and take into account the differences between elements in different rows of the periodic table. It is important to note that PEI is a relative measure for comparing compounds tested in the same conditions (e.g. a single-point assay) and are not comparable at different inhibitor concentrations. Also for BEI and SEI, similar measurements must be used (e.g. always using pKi). :PEI = (% inhibition at a given compound concentration as fraction: 0 – 1.0) / (molecular weight, kDa) :BEI = (pKi, pKd, or pIC50) / (molecular weight, kDa) :SEI = (pKi, pKd, or pIC50) / (PSA/100 Å) where pKi, pKd and pIC50 is defined as -log(Ki), -log(Kd), or -log(IC 50), respectively. Ki and IC50 in mol/L. The authors suggest plotting compounds SEI and BEI on a plane and optimizing compounds towards the diagonal and so optimizing both SEI and BEI which incorporate potency, molecular weight and PSA. There are other metrics which can be useful during hit to lead optimization: group efficiency (GE), lipophilic efficiency/lipophilic ligand efficiency (LipE/LLE), ligand lipophilicity index (LLEAT) ligand efficiency dependent lipophilicity (LELP), fit quality scaled ligand efficiency (LE_scale), size independent ligand efficiency (SILE).

He was the highest-ranking African American in the American Expeditionary Forces at the end of World War I, serving as a lieutenant colonel in the 370th Infantry Regiment. Biography Illinois was different from other states during the Jim Crow era in that it organized, and paid for the training of, an all-African-American regiment within the Illinois National Guard. This unit, organized in the 1870s, was the 8th Illinois Infantry. Otis B. Duncan was born on November 18, 1873 to Clark and Julia (née Chaverous or Chavous) Duncan. He was a member of a long-established African- American family of Springfield, Illinois; his father was a grocer and his maternal great-grandfather, barber William Florville, had been a friend of Abraham Lincoln. In 1897, Duncan became a worker for the state of Illinois, serving in the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction (the predecessor of the current Illinois State Board of Education). In addition, Duncan entered the Illinois National Guard in 1902; assigned to the 8th Illinois, he was commissioned as an officer. When the 8th Illinois was called into national service during the Pancho Villa Expedition into Mexico in 1916, Duncan served as a major on the regimental staff. Springfield race riot Despite (or perhaps because of) his service as an officer in the Illinois National Guard, Duncan was a prominent victim of the Springfield Race Riot of 1908. Contemporary news accounts indicate that a white mob broke into and ransacked Duncan's house; they shattered furniture, smashed the family piano and used Duncan's National Guard saber to gouge out the eyes of a portrait of Duncan's mother that was hanging in the house. The mob was reported to have stolen clothes, jewelry and everything of value they could find, including the saber. The weapon is reported to have been recovered and returned to Duncan. The sword thief was arrested, convicted, and sentenced to serve 30 days in the county jail. World War I After the American entry into World War I, in April 1917, the 8th Illinois, still in national service, was renamed the 370th Infantry Regiment. It was the only African-American regiment to go into the American Expeditionary Forces (A.E.F.) while retaining most of its African- American command structure. As the infantry took ship for the Western Front, Duncan became the field commander of the regiment's 3rd Battalion. Still in this capacity, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel on April 3, 1918. After the regimental commander, Colonel Franklin A. Denison, was replaced by a white officer, Lieutenant Colonel Duncan became the highest ranking African-American officer in the A.E.F. This was a significant achievement due to the segregationist attitudes of President Woodrow Wilson and his secretary of war, Newton D. Baker. While serving on the Western Front against the German Army, Duncan was awarded the Purple Heart and the French Croix de Guerre for gallantry in action. The 370th fought on the Western Front during the final months of World War I. Possibly for political reasons, the African-American regiment was detached from the larger units of the A.E.F. and integrated into the French Tenth Army. Soldiers of the 370th fought with French equipment and rations. The men of the regiment are said to been nicknamed the \\"Black Devils\\" by the German troops who fought against them. Postwar After the war, the 370th Infantry reverted to its prewar status as the 8th Illinois Infantry, and Duncan was promoted on March 18, 1919, to the rank of colonel and commander of the regiment. The regiment was stationed at Springfield's Camp Lincoln. In February 2017, authorities announced the discovery of a post-World War I 8th Illinois collar disc, a service unit insignia artifact connected to the date of Col. Duncan's command. Retirement, death and honors Colonel Duncan retired from the state education bureau in 1929 and died on May 17, 1937. He is buried in Camp Butler National Cemetery near Riverton, Illinois, in section 3, grave #835. Duncan is the namesake for American Legion Post 809 in Springfield, Illinois.

This natural monument was the first nature reserve to have been established in Belize under the National Park Systems Act in 1981 and first marine protected area in Central America. This is also Belize's oldest site of wildlife protection since it was first designated as a bird sanctuary in 1924 to protect the habitat of the red- footed booby birds.  Geography  The caye is located about south-east of Belize City at the southeast corner of the Lighthouse Reef Atoll, which is the outermost coral atoll of Belize's three atolls.  World Heritage Site  Half Moon Caye Natural Monument is part of the Belize Barrier Reef Reserve System World Heritage Site which was established on December 4, 1996, by the United Nations World Heritage Committee after they formally adopted seven marine protected areas along the Belize Barrier Reef and its adjacent atolls under the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) at their meeting in Mérida, Mexico. The nature reserve is managed by the Belize Fisheries Department and co-managed by the Belize Audubon Society.  Significant features  * The Half Moon Caye Wall is a well known dive spot called the “6,000 feet of vertical abyss”. Within this structure, divers will be able to see a diversity of marine life including corals, garden eels, sponge formations, eagle rays, sea turtles and groupers. * The littoral forest, composed primarily of the orange-flowered siricote tree, provides an endangered and fragile habitat that supports one of the only viable breeding grounds for the red-footed booby colony in the western Caribbean. The booby colony supports the forest’s stability by providing guano as fertilizer. It is also a habitat tor the endemic Belize leaf-toed gecko (also known as the Belize atoll gecko) and Allison's anole lizard. * The south eastern part of the island serves annually as a sea turtle nesting ground from May to November for the loggerhead, hawksbill, and green turtles, all endangered species.

He is best remembered for his runner-up performance to Head Play in the 1933 Preakness Stakes.  Two-year-old season  In 1932, Ladysman won the Arlington Futurity at Arlington Park in Chicago, Illinois in July and then shipped to Saratoga Race Course in August and September. He started off the meet with a win in Grand Union Hotel Stakes at six furlongs and then won the United States Hotel Stakes at six furlongs. In his next race, he placed second in the Saratoga Special Stakes at six and half furlongs. In his next start, he won the seven furlong Hopeful Stakes, beating Sun Archer by two lengths to establish himself as the season's leading juvenile colt. In September, he placed second in the Futurity Stakes at Belmont Park. Ladysman was voted 1932 United States Champion 2 yr- old Colt.  Three-year-old season  In 1933, owner William R. Coe rested Ladysman during the winter and into the spring. His first race of the year was the Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs on the first Saturday of May. In the Derby, he started favorite but finished fourth behind Brokers Tip and Head Play. His trainer, Bud Stotler, convinced the owner that Ladysman needed that race and decided to run him in the second jewel of the Triple Crown, the Preakness Stakes at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland. Ladysman was made the second choice in a field of ten stakes winners at odds of 3:1 in the \\"Run for the Black-Eyed Susans\\". He broke from gate three and settled into a stalking position of third behind favorite Head Play, who led gate to wire in solid fractions of :23-3/5 and :48 flat for the first quarter and half mile. Around the final turn, Ladysman held off several challenges and passed De Valera for second. He finished four lengths short of first and withstood the rush of Utopian to place by a head. The Derby winner lacked speed and faded to last out of ten.  Later career  In 1934, Ladysman scored his biggest victory in the Suburban Handicap at Belmont Park. He also showed with third- place finishes in both the Stars and Stripes Handicap at Arlington Park and the Metropolitan Handicap at Belmont. As a five-year-old, he ran second in The Big Cap at Santa Anita Park and third in the San Juan Capistrano Handicap in 1935.

It designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1976 and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. The courthouse was the setting of the 1959 film Anatomy of a Murder, directed by Otto Preminger. History In 1857, the first Marquette County courthouse, a wooden Greek Revival structure, was built on this site. By the turn of the century, that structure had become inadequate. In 1902, voters approved the issuance of $120,000 worth of bonds to construct a new courthouse. The earlier structure was moved off the site, and the county hired Marquette architect D. Fred Charlton (Charlton, Gilbert & Demar/Charlton & Kuenzli) to design the building. Northern Construction Company of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, was hired to construct the building. The county eventually spent $240,000 to complete the structure; it was completed in 1904. The courthouse was the site of a famous 1913 libel case, where President Theodore Roosevelt won a judgment against Ishpeming newspaper publisher George Newett. Roosevelt was awarded six cents, \\"the price of a good newspaper.\\" Another later case tried here inspired John D. Voelker's novel, Anatomy of a Murder. The 1959 movie version of the novel, directed by Otto Preminger, was filmed in the courthouse. In 1982–84, the courthouse was renovated at a cost of $2.4 million. A new courthouse and jail was built nearby, connected by a tunnel, but the 1904 building remains in use. Architecture and design The Marquette County Courthouse is a Beaux-Arts and Neoclassical structure, with a central three-story mass flanked by two-story wings. It is built almost entirely of local sandstone over a steel frame. A colossal portico covers the entrance, lined with granite Doric columns from Maine. A Doric entablature with copper cornice rings the roofline. A copper dome surmounts the building, and sits above the second-floor courtroom. Inside, the courtroom is finished with mahogany and marble. Mosaic tiles, wool carpeting, and stained glass fill the building.

Taxonomy A number of species that were placed in the family Phyllophoridae by Thander in 1989 and 1990 are now included in Cucumariidae. Biology Members of the family Cucumariidae are small to medium-sized sea cucumbers, characterised by ten branching tentacles of which the lowest two are often smaller than the others. They are filter feeders, using their tentacles to catch micro-organisms and pass them to their mouth. They are seldom found on coral reefs but mostly live in deep water on sand and gravel substrates.Marine Species Identification Portal Certain genera including the sea apples in the genera Paracucumaria and Pseudocolochirus, contain toxic holothurin and holotoxin and release it into the water when damaged or killed. Spawning may also be accompanied by release of these toxins.

The site was occupied by British troops during the American Revolutionary War.  History  Simon Dixon, a Quaker who migrated from Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, came to the Cane Creek area and what is now known as Snow Camp, North Carolina during the late 1740s. By 1751, as many as thirty other Quaker families had migrated to Snow Camp. During 1751, Quaker Minister Abigail Pike and Rachel Wright traveled to Perquimans County, North Carolina to attend the Quarterly Meeting at Little River, in hopes of gaining permission to establish a new monthly meeting in Cane Creek. Permission was granted and the first Monthly Meeting was held on October 7, 1751. Quaker Minister Abigail Pike at the Cane Creek Meeting Place, NC in 1751 Certificates were issued to fifteen founding members on that date. By the following year, the Meeting had issued sixty-eight certificates. There have been five physical structures which have housed the Monthly Meeting; four of those, including the present day Cane Creek Meeting House, have stood on land donated by William Marshall and his wife Rebecca Dixon in 1764. The Cane Creek Monthly Meeting is often referred to as the \\"Mother of Meetings\\" because it gave rise to a number of other Monthly Meetings in the region. The Meeting House operated a school named the Sylvan Grove Academy between 1866 and 1903. The current Sylvan Elementary school in Snow Camp reflects its heritage.  Revolutionary War  During the Revolutionary War the community of Snow Camp, North Carolina was briefly occupied following the Battle of Guilford Courthouse by General Charles Cornwallis and his troops, among others. During that time, the home and mill of Simon Dixon were seized for use as Cornwallis' headquarters. They slaughtered the livestock of the local farmers and used the Meeting House benches as their butcher blocks. A historical drama of these events is portrayed in a theater performance called, Sword of Peace by the Snow Camp Outdoor Theater.  Notable members  Herman Husband, a leader during the War of the Regulation, was a member of the Cane Creek Meeting from 1762 to 1764. He was disowned from the community following his expression of dissatisfaction over the dismissal of another member. Thomas Jefferson Hadley, a captain during the Revolutionary War, his father Joshua Hadley, and grandfather Simon Hadley where Quakers from Ireland, and had joined the Cane Creek group upon arriving. Thomas was disowned due to participation in the war.

Southern Pacific Transportation Company and predecessor railroads had been operating ferries between San Francisco and Oakland, California since 1862. Some ferries were equipped to carry team-drawn wagons, but the increasing number of automobiles requiring transport encouraged building of a ferry with an unobstructed lower deck for automobiles and 400 seats on an upper deck for passengers. Melrose was launched without engines on 11 April 1906. Installation of engines being built at San Francisco's Union Iron Works was delayed by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake a week after launching. The ferry was not completed until 1909. The side wheels were powered by two inclined tandem engines to avoid main deck obstruction by a traditional walking beam engine.Ford, Robert S. Red Trains in the East Bay (1977) Interurbans Publications p.90 The successful design of Melrose encouraged completion of sister ship Thoroughfare in 1912. Thoroughfare cost $170,000 with capacity for 97 automobiles and 45 team-drawn wagons. These two ferries offered departures at 30-minute intervals through the daylight and evening hours. Automobiles were carried on the \\"creek route\\" until new loading facilities were completed on the Oakland pier in 1921. Thoroughfare steamed into the ferry slip at full speed when her engine-order telegraph malfunctioned on 14 August 1913. The ferry was less damaged than the slipway and resumed service shortly after the engine-order telegraph was repaired.Ford, Robert S. Red Trains in the East Bay (1977) Interurbans Publications pp.132 133&162-163 Melrose collided with the Southern Pacific ferry Bay City in a patch of dense fog on 26 January 1913. Both ferries continued in service after repairs. Two Melrose deckhands were killed while attempting to rescue a man overboard on 9 July 1917 when the lifeboat they had launched to recover the passenger was drawn into the maneuvering ferry's paddle wheel. Melrose narrowly avoided collision with the freighter K.J.Luckenback in fog on 4 February 1922. Melrose ran aground while maneuvering to avoid collision, and required the assistance of tugs to be refloated. In July 1926, Melrose suffered a mid-bay mechanical breakdown requiring assistance of tugs. The rescue tug accidentally rammed Melrose while passing a tow line. Melrose started flooding and was grounded on a mud bar to prevent sinking until repairs could be made.Ford, Robert S.

The company's headquarters are located in Lübeck (Schleswig-Holstein, Germany). The German company focuses on the production of self-acting control valves (pressure and level control) and, in addition to standard products, specialises in customised solutions. Axel Weidner, great- grandson of the company founder, and Dr. Stefan Nehlsen are jointly responsible for the management.  History  The founder Gustav Mankenberg was born on August 12, 1857, in the town of Wittstock on the river Dosse/Germany as eighth child to the self-employed master blacksmith Johann Friedrich Mankenberg. He learnt the trade of a metal craftsman in Berlin, i.e. a craftsman processing metal objects of any kind by shaping, casting, turning and other processing methods.Christian Risch: Ventile aus Lübeck für alle Welt in Lübecker Nachrichten of 13. June 2010 On May 1, 1885, Gustav Mankenberg took over the workshop of the brass founder master Wallen in the town of Heide in Schleswig-Holstein and founded the company Gustav Mankenberg. Mr. Mankenberg quickly realised the development of the local market and changed the product line to reducing valves for air and carbonic acid tanks, air pumps etc. and additionally opened a samples stock and a sales warehouse at the Roedingsmarkt avenue in Hamburg.75 Jahre Gustav Mankenberg Armaturenfabrik GmbH, Lübeck, Chronik, page 4. - 25 Owing to non-payments caused by an economical slump in the building industry, Gustav Mankenberg was forced to bring a partner from Hamburg to the company in Heide in 1891. However, the co- operation failed. While the company's building hardware division remained in Heide, in May 1895 - ten years after the company had been founded - Gustav Mankenberg started valve production in the Hanseatic city of Szczecin. The city is conveniently placed at the mouth of the river Oder as regards transport facilities with good connection to Berlin via the Finow Canal and later the Oder-Havel Canal. That location proved successful as well as the demand from factories and shipyards such as the renowned shipyard Vulcan Werft. In 1904 Mankenberg had the Niagara patented: a steam trap with a closed ball float made of steel that was welded by means of the autogeneous welding procedure. Today the steam trap is still in the product range of Mankenberg GmbH. The name \\"Niagara\\" was intended to indicate the unusually large quantities of water that the new device could discharge. Due to the increased requirement for space, Mankenberg relocated to the newly erected factory on the Wiekenberg road no. 12 in Szczecin in October 1910. Later, the adjoining properties Wiekenberg no. 14-17 and Kochstrasse 19 with a total area of 12,000 square metres were acquired. On 1 January 1912 Gustav Mankenberg accepted his eldest son and employee for several years, Ewald Mankenberg, as a partner in the company. In his capacity as steam expert, he strengthened the company's consulting competence.„Ein Niagara für alle Fälle“ GWF Extra 2008 – Jubiläumsheft zum 150-jährigen Bestehen des Oldenburg Verlages of 1. July 2008 On 1 January 1917 the second son, Hellmuth Mankenberg, who had worked as a technical merchant until the First World War after thorough practical and theoretical training in Germany and abroad, joined the company as a partner. He had retired from front-line service due to a serious injury. On 1 April 1919 Mankenberg transferred the company to his two sons Ewald and Hellmuth. He lived on the factory property until the complete bombing and destruction of his villa in August 1944 and died on 2 February 1945 in the German town of Greifswald at the age of 87. In 1929 the economic crisis began: Inflation and deflation posed new challenges to the company.Cf. Die Weltwirtschaftskrise 1929-1932 , retrieved 21. July 2010 During World War II the factory in Szczecin continued to fabricate steam valves until the eviction notice was received on March 23, 1945. The company had to be closed immediately. The company management was only allowed to take the finished products with them, all machine tools were not allowed to be loaded. The way led the company management and numerous employees to the Hanseatic city of Lübeck, where rooms were rented from the stamping and enamelling works. In the summer of 1945 the company was given permission to resume production in Lübeck. After initial provisional arrangements with company premises at five different locations, the company acquired the site at Brolingstrasse 51 in 1955 and built its own administration building on the factory premises. Dieter Mankenberg, one grandson of Gustav Mankenberg who was to take over the business later, was killed during WW II in Hungary in January 1945. Therefore, Dr.-Ing. Günther Weidner, son-in-law of Hellmuth Mankenberg, joined the company in 1954. In 1957 the limited company Gustav Mankenberg Armaturenfabrik GmbH was founded in addition to the existing general partnership (German OHG). Dr.-Ing. Günther Weidner received power of attorney. All employees were taken over by the GmbH. In 1967 the Lubeck-based graduate engineer Hermann Thomsen became head of the technical office. At the beginning of the 1970s, he also became a partner and sole responsible managing director of the company.100 Jahre Gustav Mankenberg Armaturenfabrik GmbH, Lübeck, Chronik, Page 10 In 1992 the company moved to Spenglerstrasse no. 99 in the Lubeck-based industrial estate Roggenhorst. In the year 2002 Mr Axel Weidner, Gustav Mankenberg's great-grandson, became the sole managing director of Mankenberg GmbH. Mankenberg GmbH founded the subsidiary OOO Mankenberg in Moscow in 2014. In 2017 Dr.-Ing. Stefan Nehlsen joined the company as second managing director.  Awards  In 2010, Mankenberg was the best medium-sized company to win the Oskar Patzelt Foundation's Grand Prix for Medium-Sized Businesses. The jury praised Mankenberg's overall development during the previous year, the creation and safeguarding of jobs and training places, modernisation and innovation as well as its commitment to the region.Großer Preis des Mittelstandes: Preisträger 2010 aus Schleswig-Holstein/Hamburg. retrieved on 8. June 2011 In 2011, Mankenberg became one of 365 places in the Land of Ideas.

Arrivals and departures In March 1993 Moli Tokoro and Borongoli camps were evacuated for Natinga after the National Islamic Front had made advances in the south. The route led through Palotaka, where about 800 of the unaccompanied minors decided to settle. In some cases the SPLA appears to have recruited boys as fighters. There were 2,800 unaccompanied boys at the school in Natinga in August 1994. By March 1995 only 600 boys were left. By June the number of unaccompanied boys had risen again to 1,700.

It originally runs on Windows Phone 7.5 \\"Mango\\"—it was Nokia's first device to run the Windows Phone operating system and marked the company's shift from Symbian for their smartphones. It was Nokia's flagship upon the original release in Europe in November 2011, and was thus also a highly important product for Nokia's mobile phone business. Lumia 800 shares its design with the previously released MeeGo-based Nokia N9 and it was originally Meego CDMA-variant for Verizon with codename RM-716 Searay. The outward differences are one added physical button dedicated to the camera on the right side of the phone, and a dual LED flash moved directly above the Carl Zeiss camera lens. Despite a similar exterior, the Lumia 800 has a different interior than N9. Lumia 800's chipset comes from Qualcomm, whereas the N9 is based on a Texas Instruments OMAP chipset and CPU. Like the N9, it has a convex-curved Gorilla Glass AMOLED PenTile screen with a ClearBlack antiglare filter. The screen diagonal is 3.7 inches (800 x 480 pixels), compared with 3.9 inches (854 x 480 pixels) for N9, to conform with the Windows Phone specifications list, which includes three capacitive softkeys placed under the glass. A through-colored unibody shell is made from polycarbonate plastic. It was replaced as the flagship by Nokia Lumia 900, which was originally released for the American market through AT&T; before its worldwide release. On 5 September 2012, the Nokia Lumia 820, the successor of the Nokia Lumia 800, was presented. The improvements are Windows Phone 8, dual core processor, front camera, wireless charging option, exchangeable covers, and bigger screen. History A \\"Sea Ray\\" prototype smartphone was presented by Nokia CEO Stephen Elop at a private gathering in Espoo on 23 June 2011, two days after the introduction of the Nokia N9 in Singapore. The device's design was pretty much the same as the N9, except that it functionally ran on Windows Phone 7.5 (\\"Mango\\" update).https://www.gsmarena.com/nokias_first_wp7_device_codenamed_sea_ray_breaks_loose- news-2816.php Elop called on the audience to turn off their cameras because the device was \\"super confidential\\", but photos and a full video clip leaked on the internet, leading to reporters calling it naive or cynical. As a result, some in the media believed the presentation to be a \\"publicity stunt\\".https://theappshoppe.wordpress.com/2011/11/24/exclusive-nokia-and- windows-7-sea-ray-smart-phone-video-and- report/https://www.cnet.com/news/nokia-sea-ray-is-first-glimpse-of-nokia- windows-phone/ Software The Lumia 800 device comes with four Nokia- exclusive applications not included by the default Windows Phone OS: Nokia Drive, a free turn-by-turn navigation system; Nokia Maps; Nokia Music, a free streaming music service and music store; and App Highlights, a service suggesting software based on location and operator. In addition to these applications and services, Microsoft added Office 365, in which the user can edit documents, create spreadsheets, open PowerPoint presentations, and even make OneNote files. The files created can be stored on Microsoft's SkyDrive cloud service, on the phone itself, and other areas. Nokia Collection In addition to pre-installed Nokia-exclusive Windows Phone applications, the Windows Phone Marketplace contains a Nokia Collection section. As of April 2012, it contains the following additional applications: Nokia Transport, a location-aware public transport schedule and navigation application; Creative Studio, a photo editing application; TuneIn Radio, a local and global radio streaming application; CNN, a news reader and video viewer for the Cable News Network; and WRC Live, an application to follow live timing and media from the FIA WRC series. Diagnostic Tool Just like the Lumia 900, the 800 comes with a diagnostic tool. It can be accessed by pressing ##634# on the dial keypad, which should initiate the download after the last # is pressed. The diagnostic tool should appear on the app list under Diagnostics. On this diagnostic tool, a user can run tests on the following: Accelerometer, ALS, audio loopback, camera, battery status, DTMF, gyroscope, hardware buttons, headset detection, LCD white, lights, life timer, magnetometer, power source, proximity, speaker, touch and vibration. It's also possible to perform all the tests in one run. Note: This app does not harm the phone, it is an application used by device engineers to test functions of the phone to find whether a certain component is working properly. The app can be uninstalled if a user chooses to do so.  Limitation to WP7  According to Microsoft, due to platform architecture change, WP7 phones, based on the CE kernel, will not be upgradeable to Windows Phone 8, based on the NT kernel, which was released in the fall of 2012.No Windows Phone 8 upgrade for current devices Mobile – CNET News Instead, Microsoft has released Windows Phone 7.8 in January 2013, which includes some WP8 features for existing WP7 phones. Release Back of the device in black colour The Lumia 800 device was presented along with Lumia 710 by Nokia's CEO Stephen Elop at the Nokia World conference in London October 2011. In the presentation referred to their devices as 'the first real Windows Phones'. The London launch was promoted with a massive sound and light show. Nokia and Canadian-based DJ deadmau5 illuminated the banks of the River Thames and the Millbank Tower with a state-of-the-art music and laser show. According to The Daily Telegraph, \\"The 118 metre building was turned into a canvas for a state-of-the-art light show during which the London skyscraper seemed to buckle and twist\\". As the first flagship result of its alliance with Microsoft announced eight months earlier, it was a highly important product for Nokia.https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tech-news/Nokia-eyes-50-market- share-in-India/articleshow/10517943.cms Only a week before the launch, Nokia posted a second consecutive quarterly loss, making it even more vital for their fortunes to succeed.https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/nokia- registers-151-million-loss-in-q3handset-sales-slide/articleshow/10429449.cms Nokia outsourced the production of its Qualcomm-based Lumia 800 to Compal Electronics. According to Nokia, this was due to time constraints and Compal's experience with the chipset. Future models, starting from Lumia 710, would be built in a Nokia factory, according to the same source. Devices for the European and Northern American markets are configured, tested and packed by Nokia's factory in Salo, Finland. The Lumia 800 was released in Canada but not the United States.

European carriers have stated that Nokia Lumia phones are not good enough to compete with Apple iPhone or Samsung Galaxy phones, that \\"they are overpriced for what is not an innovative product\\" and that \\"No one comes into the store and asks for a Windows phone\\".Mobile operators unconvinced by Nokia's revival bid Reuters Nokia Lumia 800 won the \\"Editor's Choice\\" award of 2011 from What Mobile magazine. Their review rated it 5/5, commending that \\"[t]he Lumia 800 is a massive step forward for Nokia and sits apart in an increasingly crowded market. Alongside Windows Phone Mango, there’s enough inside the Lumia 800 to worry rivals and make iPhone fans jealous.\\" Brian Klug of AnandTech in his review wrote: \\"The Lumia 800 is indubitably the best Windows Phone hardware out there right now,\\" with notable features such as \\"[a] camera without compromises, hardware build quality that’s unique and solid, Nokia’s attention to detail...\\" With regard to the device's shortcomings, Klug mentioned \\"lack of USB or external storage, a still fledgling application ecosystem, and a few others.\\" Regarding the camera, Brian Klug added: \\"Lumia 800’s camera comes out looking very good against the rest of the 8MP competition, and for me this is the first F/2.2 8 MP shooter I’ve come across. With less compression and better ISP, it could be even better than most.\\" In an Engadget review, Sharif Sakr wrote: \\"Nokia's Lumia 800 is a sophisticated and capable smartphone that melds its hardware beautifully with the Windows Phone OS.\\" Sakr writes that while the phone lacked features like USB mass storage and expandable storage, the phone is welcome for those who want to be \\"part of a carefully crafted, simple and generally happy emerging ecosystem.\\" PC World reported that Nokia Lumia 800 has solid guts and shiny looks, and was an \\"interesting proposal\\", though they also said it had \\"nothing extraordinary to offer\\" when compared to the highest-end models of Samsung Galaxy Nexus, Motorola Droid RAZR, or the more expensive iPhone 4S in hardware and software. Cnet UK noted that \\"overall, the Lumia 800 is a very good handset. The Windows Phone software is slick and fun to use, especially if you like to keep up-to- date with what friends are up to on social networking sites. It also looks attractive and the excellent build quality gives you the confidence that it's built to last.\\" CNET UK made a camera comparison with current (as of early 2012) high-end phones iPhone 4S and Samsung Galaxy S II, and wrote that Lumia 800 \\"didn't offer the quality of camera we were hoping for.\\" Regarding the camera, GSM Arena wrote, that \\"We were quite impressed by the job done by the 8 megapixel sensor and the bright F/2.2 lens. Images might not be the sharpest around and the noise levels are only average, but their colors and contrast are great, despite the sub-optimal lighting. Cameraphone lovers should definitely check this one out.\\" Ketaki Bhojnagarwala in The Hindu review wrote, \\"The Lumia 800 isn't perfect, but its one of the best products that Nokia has released in the market in recent months. I have no complaints about the hardware – Nokia gets it right every time.

Soaring Society of America, November 1983. USPS 499-920 Design and development The series started with the Hoffmann H36 Dimona, a touring motorglider introduced in the early 1980s. The aircraft were initially produced by Hoffmann Flugzeugbau, which became HOAC Flugzeugwerk and later Diamond Aircraft Industries. Built entirely from fibreglass, the H36 family all use a Wortmann FX 63-137 airfoil. The wings feature top-surface Schempp- Hirth-style airbrakes. Optionally, the wings can be folded by two people in a few minutes to allow storage. The original H36 has wings, while the later members of the family added slightly greater span. The H36 offers a 27:1 glide ratio, while later variants improved that by one point, to 28:1 by adding winglets increasing the span to . Cockpit accommodation seats two in side-by- side configuration, under a hinged bubble canopy that is pushed up and backwards. The series are type certified in Europe and North America. The H36 received its US Federal Aviation Administration certification on 9 July 1986. Due to its fibreglass construction, the US certification includes the restriction \\"All external portions of the glider exposed to sunlight must be painted white except of (sic) wing tips, nose of fuselage and rudder.\\" In March 1987 an improved variant was developed by Dieter Köhler and the subsequent HK36R first flew with a Limbach L2400 engine in October 1989. When equipped with the larger available engines, particularly the Rotax 914 turbocharged powerplant, the aircraft can be used for glider towing. A commercial success, more than 900 H36s and HK36s have been completed. The HK36 provided the basis from which the Diamond DV20 Katana from which the improved DA20 and four-seat DA40 series were later developed. Operational history In 1991, an HK36, flown by Peter Urach in Austria, set an absolute altitude record in its class for a piston engined aircraft of . The record held until surpassed in 2002 by the Bohannon B-1.Flying Magazine, July 2002, pg 36 In February 2008, The Boeing Fuel Cell Demonstrator used a Diamond HK36 Super Dimona motor glider airframe and achieved straight-level flight on a manned mission powered by a hydrogen fuel cell. The FCD (Fuel Cell Demonstrator) was a project led by Boeing that used a Diamond HK36 Super Dimona motor glider as a testbed for a fuel cell-powered light airplane research project. The project achieved level flight using fuel cells only in February and March 2008. In December 2016 there were nine H36s and thirty HK36s registered with the US FAA, two HK36Rs and two HK36TTSs registered with Transport Canada, along with seven H36s and eight HK36s registered with the UK Civil Aviation Authority.

The Serbian nobility (srpska vlastela, srpsko vlastelinstvo or srpsko plemstvo) were roughly grouped into magnates (velikaši or velmože), the upper stratum, and the lesser nobility (vlasteličići). Serbia followed the government model established by the Byzantine Empire. The nobility possessed hereditary allodial estates, which were worked by dependent sebri, the equivalent of Byzantine paroikoi; peasants owing labour services, formally bound by decree. The nobility was obliged to serve the monarch in war. Hierarchy The nobility (vlastela, vlastelinstvo or plemstvo) of Serbia in the Middle Ages is roughly divided into magnates (velikaši or velmože), nobility and petty noblemen (vlasteličići). Sometimes, the division is made between vlastela (including \\"great\\" and \\"small\\" ones) and vlasteličići, the petty nobility. The lower-half social class, commoners, were the sebri (себри). *The velikaši (великаши) were the highest nobility class of Serbia. *The vlasteličići (властеличићи) were the lower nobility class of Serbia. It was a relatively numerous class of the small, warrior nobility, originating from the vojnici (warriors) from sources from the end of the 12th and the beginning of the 13th century. They held villages, with full rights, and in socioeconomic and legal terms stood below the vlastela. They had military obligations, such as the vlasteličić joining the army individually or with a group of his men (soldiers), dependent on his wealth. Titles History Early and High Middle Ages The Serbs at that time were organized into župe (sing. župa), a confederation of village communities (roughly the equivalent of a county), headed by a local župan (a magistrate or governor); the governorship was hereditary, and the župan reported to the Serbian prince, whom they were obliged to aid in war. According to Fine Jr.: Bosnia, Zahumlje and Rascia were never incorporated into an integrated state with Duklja (1043–1101); each principality had its own nobility and institutions, simply requiring a member of the royal family to rule as Prince or Duke. After Constantine Bodin died, the principalities seceded from Duklja, and Vukan became the most powerful Serb ruler, as Grand Prince. Subordinate to the ruler were local counts who seem to have been more or less autonomous in the internal affairs of their counties, but who swore loyalty and were obliged to support in war. It seems that the counts were hereditary holders of their counties, holding their land before Duklja annexed Rascia. Kingdom of Serbia Mourning nobility at the burial of Queen Anna Dandolo. The hierarchy of the Serbian court titles was the following: stavilac, čelnik, kaznac, tepčija and vojvoda, the supreme title. In the Dečani chrysobulls, King Stefan Dečanski (r. 1321–1331) mentioned that the court dignitaries present at the Dečani assembly were the kaznac, tepčija, vojvoda, sluga and stavilac. Serbian Empire On April 16, 1346 (Easter), Stephen Uroš IV Dušan of Serbia convoked a huge assembly at Skopje, attended by the Serbian Archbishop Joanikije II, the Archbishop of Ochrid Nikolaj I, the Bulgarian Patriarch Simeon and various religious leaders of Mount Athos.Temperley Harold William Vazeille (2009), History of Serbia, p. 72. The assembly and clerics agreed on, and then ceremonially performed the raising of the autocephalous Serbian Archbishopric to the status of Serbian Patriarchate.The Late Medieval Balkans, p. 309 The Archbishop from now on is titled Serbian Patriarch, although some documents called him Patriarch of Serbs and Greeks, with the seat at the Patriarchal Monastery of Peć. The first Serbian Patriarch Joanikije II now solemnly crowned Dušan as \\"Emperor and autocrat of Serbs and Romans\\" (Greek ). Dušan had his son crowned King of Serbs and Greeks, giving him nominal rule over the Serbian lands, and although Dušan was governing the whole state, he had special responsibility for the \\"Roman\\", i.e. Greek lands. A further increase in the Byzantinization of the Serbian court followed, particularly in court ceremonial and titles. As Emperor, Dušan could grant titles only possible as an Emperor.The Late Medieval Balkans, p. 310 In the years that followed, Dušan's half-brother Symeon Uroš and brother-in-law Jovan Asen became despotes. Jovan Oliver already had the despot title, granted to him by Andronikos III. His brother- in-law Dejan Dragaš and Branko is granted the title of sebastocrator. The military commanders (voivodes) Preljub and Vojihna receive the title of caesar. The raising of the Serbian Patriarch resulted in the same spirit, bishoprics became metropolitans, as for example the Metropolitanate of Skopje.  Fall of the Serbian Empire  Emperor Uroš V died childless in December 2/4 1371, after much of the Serbian nobility had been destroyed in Maritsa earlier that year. This marked an end to the once powerful Empire. Vukašin's son Marko, who had earlier been crowned Young King was to inherit his father's royal title, and thus became one in the line of successors to the Serbian throne. Meanwhile, the nobles pursued their own interests, sometimes quarreling with each other. Serbia, without an Emperor \\"became a conglomerate of aristocratic territories\\",Ross-Allen 1978, p. 505 and the Empire was thus divided between the provincial lords: Marko, the Dejanović brothers, Đurađ I Balšić, Vuk Branković, Nikola Altomanović, Lazar Hrebeljanović and other lesser ones.Ćorović 2001, ch. 3, XIII.

Career Abel became one of Canada's youngest ever divers when she had her debut Olympics at the age of 16 in the 2008 Summer Olympics. Though failing to medal at the Olympic games that year, Abel did achieve success together with partner Emilie Heymans on the Grand Prix circuit, winning several medals. Their work together would continue after that and Abel would gain from Heymans' experience which would build through to more Grand Prix medals through to 2010. She became the 2010 Commonwealth Games champion in both the 1 m springboard and the 3 m synchro springboard with Émilie Heymans as well as holding a 2010 Commonwealth silver in the 3 m springboard. After her positive results she said that \\"This was my first Commonwealth Games and I didn't expect to win so many medals. It shows I'm on the right track for the Olympics.\\" In 2011, Abel also has achieved a bronze medal and a silver medal from the world championships in the 3 m springboard and the 3 m synchro again with Heymans.

The novel has been referred to as historical fiction, since it features certain real life characters, such as naturalist Charles Jamrach. The novel was short-listed for the 2011 Man Booker Prize.\\"Booker prize longlist finds surprises\\", Justine Jordan, The Guardian, 26 July 2011\\"Two first time novelists make shortlist of six\\", Book Prize website, 6 September 2011 Plot At the age of eight, Jaffy Brown encounters a tiger escaped from the menagerie of Charles Jamrach, wandering about London's East End. Taken up in the tiger's jaws, he is rescued by Jamrach himself, who then offers Jaffy a job. Jaffy loves working at the menagerie and becomes friends with another employee, Tim Linver. He falls in love with Tim's sister and the three of them grow up together on the streets of London. Several years later, when Jaffy is sixteen, he and Tim are dispatched by Jamrach to the Dutch East Indies, aboard a whaling ship. Under the charge of Jamrach's seasoned field agent, Dan Rymer, they have been sent to capture a \\"dragon\\" for the menagerie. The crew successfully capture the dragon, but on the return voyage it is set loose by Skip, one of the ship's mad crewmen, and after it bites a crew member they are forced to drive it overboard. Later the vessel is struck by a waterspout and sunk, leaving only a dozen men alive, stranded in the Pacific Ocean in two whaleboats. The two boats make for the coast of Chile, and as the crew gradually begin to die of starvation, thirst and exposure, they resort to cannibalism. Eventually only Jaffy, Tim, Skip and Dan are left alive, and they draw straws to see who will be killed and eaten. Tim draws the short straw, and Jaffy kills him, an act which will haunt him for the rest of his life. Eventually Skip also dies, and by the time Dan and Jaffy arrive in Chile they are half-dead with exhaustion and half-mad from grief and anguish. In the book's coda, Jaffy returns home, faces Tim's family, and goes through a long period of depression and ennui. He eventually returns to life as a sailor, and in his retirement constructs a bird menagerie of his own. Historical references Charles Jamrach was a real historical figure who operated a menagerie in east London in the 19th century, and at one point a Bengal tiger escaped and took an eight-year-old boy in its mouth. This event is depicted by a statue in Tobacco Dock in Wapping. Jamrach personally rescued the boy from the tiger. The ordeal of the crew in the lifeboats is largely based on the notorious shipwreck of the whaler Essex, which a sperm whale rammed and sank in 1820. A sixteen-year-old sailor named Charles Ramsdell shot his childhood friend Owen Coffin after the drawing of straws. Coffin, like Tim, insisted on the deal being honoured. Ramsdell survived the incident and returned to life as a sailor.

NAACP, 360 U.S. 167 (1959), is a 6-to-3 ruling by the Supreme Court of the United States which held that the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia should have abstained from deciding the constitutionality of three barratry, champerty, and maintenance laws in the state of Virginia until state courts had had a reasonable chance to construe them..  Background  On September 10, 1956, as part of the Massive Resistance movement, 16 bills were introduced in a special session of the Virginia General Assembly aimed a curbing the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in Virginia.\\"Bills Aimed at NAACP Stir Va. Assembly Fight.\\" Washington Post. September 11, 1956. Five of the bills expanded the state's definitions of barratry, champerty, and maintenance. Barratry is the \\"stirring up\\" of litigation by inducing individuals or organizations to sue when they otherwise would not.Dickson, p. 314. Champerty occurs when a third party (not the plaintiff nor their legal counsel) assumes the risks and financial costs of a lawsuit in return for a portion of the monetary award. Maintenance occurs when a third party supports or promotes a litigant's suit in such a way as to prolong litigation when the parties would otherwise have brought an end to litigation or settled the suit. The eleven other bills collectively required the following groups to file a financial report and membership list annually with state: any group which promotes or opposes state legislation aimed at any race; any organization attempting to influence public opinion on behalf of any race; or any group raising funds to employ legal counsel in connection with racial litigation. By the end of the special session, these had been collapsed into six \\"legal business\\" bills.\\"School, NAACP Bills Signed by Gov. Stanley.\\" Washington Post. September 30, 1956.Baker, Robert E. \\"School Bills Go to Stanley.\\" Washington Post. September 23, 1956. They were significantly amended in committee to meet the constitutional concerns of a number of legislators. The bills were merged so that only five were reported from the committee and passed by the Assembly. Governor Thomas B. Stanley signed these legal business bills into law on September 29, 1956. They went into effect immediately. The Virginia NAACP filed suit in federal court in 1956 against the Attorney General of Virginia to have the five barratry, champerty, and maintenance laws thrown out as an unconstitutional infringement of the 1st Amendment rights of freedom of speech and freedom of assembly.Dickson, p. 315. In 1957, Virginians elected Albertis S. Harrison, Jr. Attorney General, so he was the named defendant when the three judge panel of the U.S. District Court of the Eastern District of Virginia issued its decision in NAACP v. Harrison, the panel agreed that three of the laws were unconstitutional, but reserved judgment on the other two laws pending interpretation by state courts (which had not yet ruled on the laws' legality). The state appealed, and the U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari. Thurgood Marshall argued for the NAACP; David J. Mays and J. Segar Gravatt argued for the state (attorney general Harrison having delegated the responsibility of defending the statute to private attorney Mays).  Opinion of the Court   Majority  Associate Justice John Marshall Harlan II wrote the majority opinion, joined by Associate Justices Hugo Black, Felix Frankfurter, Tom C. Clark, Charles Evans Whittaker, and Potter Stewart. The Supreme Court had, 18 years earlier, confronted the issue of how to avoid constitutional rulings where a resolution in state court might make such decisions unnecessary. This rule had been laid down in Railroad Comm'n of Tex. v. Pullman Co., 312 U. S. 496 (1941). Under this rule, Harlan concluded that the issue was not yet ripe for federal action. Federal courts, he wrote, should not address the constitutionality of state laws, especially those laws which were new or open to reasonable interpretation, until state courts had a reasonable period of time to interpret them.Harrison, 360 U.S. at 176–177. To meet this test, the Supreme Court had to determine whether the laws in question could be reasonably interpreted in more than one way. Harlan said that there was reasonable room for alternative legal construction by state courts.Harrison, 360 U.S. at 177–178. State courts, he said, needed to generate a complete record (which included the possibility of limiting interpretation) so that federal courts could more accurately rule on the issues raised.Harrison, 360 U.S. at 178. The judgment was vacated and the case remanded back of the district court, with instructions that the federal court should retain jurisdiction over the cases until such time as Virginia courts had construed them.Harrison, 360 U.S. at 179.  Dissent  Associate Justice William O. Douglas dissented, joined by Chief Justice Earl Warren and Associate Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. Douglas did not dispute that Railroad Comm'n was an appropriate precedent. However, he argued that in certain cases, the precedent could be used as a tactic to delay justice.Harrison, 360 U.S. at 179–180 (Douglas, J., dissenting). The case at hand presented unique, pressing issues regarding fundamental civil rights, he said,Harrison, 360 U.S. at 180. \\"It seems plain to me that it was the District Court's duty to provide this remedy,\\" he concluded.Harrison, 360 U.S. at 181. \\"Where state laws made such an assault as these do on our decisions and a State has spoken defiantly against the constitutional rights of the citizens, reasons for showing deference to local institutions vanish.\\"Harrison, 360 U.S. at 182. Douglas would have upheld the lower court's ruling against the three laws, and also thought that the majority erred by remanding the other two laws back to state courts for interpretation (rather than holding them unconstitutional).Harrison, 360 U.S. at 184.

The next year at the 2010 European Short Course Swimming Championships in Hungary, Stravius won his first medal at an international meet, winning a silver in the 100 m backstroke. At this meet, he also was part of the winning 4 × 100 m medley relay and the bronze medal winning team of the 4 × 200 m freestyle relay. Stravius won his first international gold winning the gold medal in the 100 m backstroke at the 2011 FINA World Championships in Shanghai. He shared it with countryman Camille Lacourt. He also received a silver in the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay and the 4 × 200 m freestyle relay at this meet.

On 28 July 2013, at the FINA World Championships in Barcelona, Stravius was part of the winning 4 × 100 m medley relay where he swam the butterfly leg. Stravius was in the anchor position for France in the 4 × 100 m men's freestyle final. The French were the defending Olympic champions but were seeded outside the middle lanes in the final, causing Stravius to remark \\"On n'était pas favoris, c'est un hold up\\".http://www.lemonde.fr/sport/article/2013/07/28/natation-le-relais- francais-champion-du-monde-du-4-x-100-m-nage-libre_3454693_3242.html In the final, after 200 m where France was far off from the leading three teams, Fabien Gilot exploded through with a 46.90s third leg to bring the French back into contention. Then, Stravius took over the Australians at the start of his leg and trailing the Russians and American swimmers at the midpoint of his anchor leg, Stravius snapped a precise flipturn and, after several powerful dolphin kicks underwater, emerged ahead by a hand, eventually securing the gold medal for France by 0.26s. He also won silver medals in the 50 m backstroke and the 100 m backstroke. At this meet he also swam the 200 m individual medley and the 4 × 200 m freestyle relay. At the 2014 European Aquatics Championships in Berlin, Stravius earned two silver medals, one of them in the 50 m backstroke and the other in the 100 m backstroke.

He also painted animals and a few genre scenes. After starting his career in Antwerp he is believed to have worked later in France. Life Carstian Luyckx was born in Antwerp in 1623 as the son of David Luycx en Margriet Cloot. He was baptized on 17 August 1623.Carstian Luyckx at the Netherlands Institute for Art History } He studied painting under Philips de Marlier, a still life specialist, in 1642 and under Frans Francken III, a history painter, in 1645. Kitchen still life with vase of flowers, dead birds, fish and a cat In 1645 he became a master of the Antwerp Guild of St. Luke. He is documented in Antwerp up to August 1653. It is believed that he left Antwerp and worked in France as many of his later works carry French inscriptions.Carstian Luyckx, A hunting still life of partridges with four Springer spaniels, a hawk, a game-bag and belt and other hunting gear in a landscape at Christie's During his residence in France, Luyckx influenced other vanitas painters, including Simon Renard de St. André. It is not clear when and where Luyckx died but his death date is assumed to fall between the years 1657 and 1677. Work General Luyckx was a successful artist who worked in many still life genres and also painted animals and a few genre scenes. He fell into oblivion after his death. Only two dated works are known to exist, making it difficult to establish a chronology for his oeuvre. Luyckx is known to have collaborated with other Antwerp painters. The Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister in Dresden holds a painting referred to as Kitchen still life with vase of flowers, dead birds, fish and a cat. It is a collaboration of Luyckx with David Teniers the Younger who painted the architectural elements and Nicolaes van Verendael who painted the flowers in a vase. Luyckx painted the game still life, bird cage, dead fish and the cat.Kitchen still life with vase of flowers, dead birds, fish and a cat at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Pronkstillevens Memento mori A large portion of his output consists of pronkstillevens, the sumptuous still lifes that were popular in Flanders and the Dutch Republic from the 1640s. Luyckx’ work in this genre was influenced by the artist Jan Davidsz. de Heem who was active in both Antwerp and the Dutch Republic. A representative example in this genre is the Opulent still life at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts. This work dates from about 1650 and is painted on copper.La donation Hornstein à Montréal Vanitas Luyckx was especially known for his vanitas still lifes, a genre of still lifes which are intended as a reflection on the meaninglessness of earthly life and the transient nature of all earthly goods and pursuits. He had followers in France such as Simon Renard de St. André and vanitas works by Luyckx have in the past been attributed to these artists. This is for instance the case with the composition Vanitas still life with a skull, a violin, a musical score, a pipe and tobacco, an hourglass and a candle on a draped table (Sold at Sotheby's on 6 December 2012 in London, lot 201) previously given to St. André. This composition shows a musical score, which contains a single vocal part of a religious Latin choral composition, the text of which specifically relates to death. The inscription on the musical score probably refers to the 16th- century composer Orlande de Lassus.Carstian Luyckx, Vanitas still life with a skull, a violin, a musical score, a pipe and tobacco, an hourglass and a candle on a draped table at Sotheby's Hunting pieces and animals His hunting pieces (game still lifes) were influenced by the Flemish specialists in this genre Frans Snyders and especially Jan Fyt. An example of his hunting pieces is A hunting still life of partridges with four Springer spaniels, a hawk, a game-bag and belt and other hunting gear in a landscape (Sold at Christie's on 20–21 November 2013 in Amsterdam, lot 168). This work is believed to date to the transitional phase between Luyckx’ Antwerp and French periods in the 1650s. Fowl attacked by a fox Some fish still lifes by Luyckx are known, some of which were previously attributed to specialists of this genre such as Abraham van Beijeren or followers of Alexander Adriaenssen.Carstian Luyckx, Fish still life with lobster at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Luyckx painted compositions with life animals. A good example of this is the Fowl Attacked by a Fox (The Kremer Collection). This composition gives a lively rendering of a fox catching a chicken amidst a group of fowl. The artist has aptly observed the startled reaction of the rooster nearest to the fox. The other fowl appear unaware of the danger that they are in. The chicken that is being grabbed stares at the viewer more in surprise than in fear.Carstian Luyckx at The Kremer Collection, accessed on 12 November 2019 Flower and garland paintings Carstian Luyckx painted flower paintings as well as garland paintings, a special type of still life developed in Antwerp at the beginning of the 17th century by Jan Brueghel the Elder in collaboration with the Italian cardinal Federico Borromeo.David Freedberg, \\"The Origins and Rise of the Flemish Madonnas in Flower Garlands, Decoration and Devotion\\", Münchener Jahrbuch der bildenden Kunst, xxxii, 1981, pp. 115–150. Garland around a Virgin and child Other artists involved in the early development of the genre included Hendrick van Balen, Andries Daniels, Peter Paul Rubens and Daniel Seghers. The genre was initially connected to the visual imagery of the Counter-Reformation movement. It was further inspired by the cult of veneration and devotion to Mary prevalent at the Habsburg court (then the rulers over the Southern Netherlands) and in Antwerp generally).Susan Merriam, Seventeenth-Century Flemish Garland Paintings. Still Life, Vision and the Devotional Image, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2012 Garland paintings typically show a flower garland around a devotional image, portrait or other religious symbol (such as the host). Garland paintings were typically collaborations between a still life specialist and a figure painter. Still life of roses hanging from a blue ribbon with a red admiral and a cabbage butterfly Luyckx painted a number of garland paintings. In a few of these the cartouche was painted later by an unknown hand. An example is the Cartouche with Flowers (Princeton University Art Museum), which shows a flower garland around a portrait of Peter Paul Rubens painted at a later date by an unknown artist. This may be an indication that the painting had remained unsold during his lifetime. Luyckx rendered the flowers with such specificity that they can be identified easily. They are a combination of familiar Western European garden plants such as carnations and columbines as well as exotic varieties from the Orient, including the pink damask rose and the tulip. Luyckx included the rare parrot tulip, an extremely expensive variety at that time.Carstian Luyckx, Cartouche with Flowers at the Princeton University Art Museum References External links * Category:Flemish Baroque painters Category:Flemish still life painters Category:Members of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke Category:People from Antwerp Category:1623 births Category:1670s deaths ","title":"Carstian Luyckx"},{"id":"32542776","text":"Zlatni Dečaci (Serbian Cyrillic: Златни Дечаци, trans. The Golden Boys) were a former Yugoslav rock band from Belgrade, notable as one of the pioneers of the former Yugoslav rock scene.  History  The band was formed in 1962 by high school friends: Slobodan \\"Boba\\" Stefanović (vocals), Velibor \\"Borko\\" Kacl (guitar), Predrag Lukić (keyboards), Dušan Banović (drums), and Vidoje \\"Vili\\" Brajović (bass). Initially, the band was named The Tigers, but changed the name after a suggestion of journalist and chess master Nikola Karaklajić. The band regularly performed at the dances held in club Euridika in Belgrade. During these evenings Stefanović performed both with Zlatni Dečaci and with Saša Radojčić's jazz trio. Moma Davidović and Tomi Sovilj performed with the band occasionally, but after some time, Stefanović remained the only vocalist. Zlatni Dečaci wanted to break through to Yugoslav radio stations, which were at the time closed for beat music, so they started recording beat covers of classical music pieces. Karaklajić took those recordings to the Netherlands, where he participated in a chess tournament, managing to broadcast them on radio, so the editors of the label Fontana Records became interested in the band. The band, under the name Golden Boys, released the single \\"Swan Lake\\" (a theme from Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's opera Swan Lake) and \\"Humoresque\\" (a version of a humoresque by Antonín Dvořák) through the label, becoming the first Yugoslav rock band to release a record for the foreign market. A year later, those two recordings, alongside versions of the theme from Charles Gounod's opera Faust and the Ion Ivanovici's waltz \\"Waves of the Danube\\", were released on the EP Humoreska, released by Jugoton.Humoreska at Discogs With these compositions the band gained nationwide popularity and performed across Yugoslavia. Their next EP, released during the same year, featured the songs \\"Čudna devojka\\" (\\"Strange Girl\\", a cover of Marty Robbins' song \\"Devil Woman\\"), \\"Sadko\\" (a theme from Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov's opera Sadko), \\"Napušteni dom\\" (\\"Deserted Home\\", a cover of The Four Pennies song \\"A Place Where No One Goes\\"), and \\"Foxtrot Oriental\\".Čudna devojka at Discogs The single was sold in more than 100,000 copies. In April 1966, thanks to Karaklajić, they left to England. Karaklajić was invited to a chess tournament, and to acquire visas more easily, he represented the band members as young chess players. The band performed in Bognor Regis in front of some 1,500 people. They performed covers of rock hits, but their cover of Macedonian folk song \\"Jovano Jovanke\\" saw greatest success with the audience. Before returning home, the band also performed in the club Shoreline. During the same year, Brajović left the band, and was replaced by Gradimir Janković. In 1967, the band released their third and the final EP with the songs \\"Sam\\" (\\"Alone\\", a cover of Bobby Vinton song \\"Mr. Lonely\\"), \\"Samo ti\\" (\\"Only You\\", a cover of The Who song \\"It's Not True\\"), \\"Pamtim taj dan\\" (\\"I Remember the Day\\", a cover of the song \\"Skokiaan\\" written by August Msarurgwa), and \\"Ne želim kraj\\" (\\"I Don't Want the End to Come\\", a cover of The Zombies song \\"Kind of Girl\\").Sam at Discogs During the same year, after the performance on the Belgrade Spring Festival, Stefanović left the band. The rest of the band continued with the vocalist Moma Davidović, but soon ended their activity.

Since then the club has gone on to develop many league and championship winning teams at all level and has contributed to the county with many noteworthy players including Bernie Hartigan who won an All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship with Limerick in 1973. Ger Hegarty also won a Munster title and a National Hurling League medal in the mid-1990s. Location The club is centred on Our Lady Queen of Peace parish which is a working class parish on the southside of Limerick City but players also come from Our Lady of Lourdes and Holy Family parishes. The main areas that provide players include Rathbane, Janesboro, Kennedy Park, Prospect, Ballinacurra Weston, Roxboro and Southill. History Prior to the foundation of the club sportsmen of the area played with South Liberties GAA or other city clubs such as the Commercials, Young Irelanders or Claughaun GAA. The club was originally set up in 1962 both to provide a GAA club for past pupils of Sexton Street CBS hence the name 'Old Christians' and also to promote hurling and football on the southside of the city in an area where rugby and in particular soccer would have had the upper hand. Even though they won the 1962 Limerick Senior Football Championship in their first year with victory over Claughaun, their main concern was hurling in those early years and their under-14 team won the All-Ireland Féile na nGael title in 1972 beating Nenagh Éire Óg GAA, the club's greatest ever hurling achievement. They continued to hurl at a senior level up to the mid 1970s when the club went into decline, as not as many hurlers were coming out of Sexton Street CBS to play with 'Christians'. Old Christians went on to win both Minor County Championships in hurling and football in 1966. However the 1980s saw a revival and the club won several underage city and county titles. The minor hurlers reached the county final in 1984 under the Southill/Old Christians name. The popularity of football also grew and footballers played with the neighbouring Ballinacurra Gaels club and later in hurling as well in the 1990s. Old Christians won the 1992 County Intermediate Hurling Championship but they struggled to compete at senior level and were constantly fighting relegation. They were eventually relegated back to the intermediate grade in 1999 and they were back to playing junior A by 2007. They have progressed though at underage and have won numerous county titles over the last ten years, including the County Under-14 A Football title in 2013. They are now the largest underage club on the city's southside overtaking Claughaun and St. Patrick's. At adult level they field a Junior A hurling team in the City Championship but no football team, who are catered for by sister club Ballinacurra Gaels at Junior B level. Grounds Old Christians have been playing at various locations around the Rathbane area since their foundation in 1962. They bought a side in Rathbane off of the City Council in the early 2000s and now have two full sized pitches along with a clubhouse containing a sports hall and gym and dressing rooms.

Princess Anne is the only daughter and second child of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, while Mark Phillips is a retired British Army cavalry officer and a skilled horseman and equestrian. Engagement Anne first met her future husband Mark Phillips at a party for horse lovers in 1968. Princess Anne had been a keen fan of horses for most of her life and they bonded over that. She was BBC Sports Personality of the Year in 1971. Phillips later went on to win an equestrian gold medal at the Munich Olympics in 1972. Their engagement was announced on 29 May 1973. Phillips presented Anne with a Garrard engagement ring made from sapphire and diamond. The wedding Combined coat of arms of Princess Anne and Mark Phillips The wedding day, which was on the twenty-fifth birthday of her older brother, Charles, Prince of Wales was declared special bank holiday and a global estimated audience of 500 million watched the Westminster Abbey ceremony, with large crowds lining the streets on the wedding day. Although Phillips was technically a lieutenant in the Army at the time of the marriage, he was also an acting Captain and was styled as such. Princess Anne was accompanied to the ceremony in the Glass State Coach by her father, the Duke of Edinburgh. The Queen, The Queen Mother, Prince Charles, and Prince Andrew arrived in the Scottish State Coach. The ceremony featured many ceremonial aspects, including use of the state carriages and roles for the Household Cavalry, Irish Guards, and Coldstream Guards. A tall icy wedding cake with silver tiers was prepared for the ceremony. Tiers of the cake were formed in the shape of a hexagon, and \\"a statue of a female jockey leaping a fence\\" was placed on top of it as a tribute to Anne's career as an equestrian. The service was a traditional royal wedding conducted by Michael Ramsey, the Archbishop of Canterbury. In keeping with tradition, Anne's wedding ring was crafted from Welsh gold. The tradition of using Welsh gold within the wedding rings of the Royal Family dates back to 1923. Following the service, the couple then returned to Buckingham Palace for the traditional balcony appearance and a wedding lunch. At night, they stayed at White House Lodge in Richmond Park before going on their honeymoon on board the Royal Yacht Britannia, travelling the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The wedding ceremony was positively received by the public who gathered in the streets to celebrate the occasion. The BBC gained the rights to broadcast the event. Clothing Anne wore an \\"embroidered Tudor-style wedding dress, with a high collar and mediaeval-influenced sleeves\\". The dress was high-necked and high-waisted. It was designed by Maureen Baker, the chief designer for Susan Small. Anne's hair was \\"slightly parted up-do, with beehive volume,\\" and the Queen Mary Fringe Tiara secured her veil. Phillips wore the full dress uniform of his regiment, the Queen's Dragoon Guards. Best man, bridesmaid and page boy Capt. Eric Grounds served as the groom's best man. Princess Anne's bridesmaid was her nine-year-old cousin, Lady Sarah Armstrong-Jones, the daughter of Princess Margaret, while her page boy was her nine-year-old brother, Prince Edward.

Volume II, Birmingham, Printed by Pearson and Rollanson, 1784. \\"Chapter 24 John Cleypole, Esq\\". pp. 249–362 In 1637 Claypole was summoned as a gentleman before the Star Chamber, and the attorney-general was ordered to begin a prosecution against him for refusing to pay ship money. He declared for the Parliament at the start of the Civil War in 1643, and in 1644, he was appointed one of their assessors for the county of Northampton. In 1654, Claypole was elected Member of Parliament for Northamptonshire in the First Protectorate Parliament. . He may have been High Sheriff of Northamptonshire in 1655, as major-general William Boteler recommends him to John Thurloe, in a letter to him, dated 16 November. Claypole was created a baronet by the Protector on 16 July 1657. Also in 1657, he was made a commissioner with his son, for levying the taxes upon the county of Northampton; to distinguish them, he is called \\"John Claypole, esq. senior\\", and his son \\"Lord Claypole\\". Family Claypole married Mary Angell, the daughter of a wealthy London merchant. They had fourteen children, one of whom was John (1625–1688) who married a daughter of Oliver Cromwell. James (1634–1687) another son, became a merchant, emigrated to Pennsylvania becoming a prominent member of the colony.

Each episode covers a different branch of mathematics. As well as being a documentary, The Code is also included a series of online challenges forming a treasure hunt, with clues to finding the treasure being included in the episodes, online games and other challenges. Episodes Treasure hunt The treasure hunt is a series of online mathematical challenges. The BBC planned to offer the challenges to 1000 participants selected from among people who applied to participate via Twitter or email. There are three stages to the treasure hunt: The Codebreakers, the Ultimate Challenge, and the Finale. Stage 1: The Codebreakers The first puzzles are \\"The Codebreakers\\". These consist of three wheels, one relating to each episode. Each Codebreaker has six different questions and challenges relating to it, the answers to which surround the wheel. Answers to these questions can be found by watching the episode for clues, completing a flash game, solving a puzzle on the programme's blog or reaching a milestone in a mass community challenge, which involves trying to find examples of all the prime numbers between 2 and 2011 in the real world. Once a clue is found, the challenger can enter it into the Codebreaker by moving the correct \\"hand\\" around the Codebreaker. Each time a hand is moved, the password given changes. Each possible outcome of the Codebreaker produces a different password to the ultimate challenge. Entering the correct solutions into each of the three Codebreakers will result in the challenger getting the three correct passwords. Once these are entered, the Ultimate Challenge is accessible. Stage 2: The Ultimate Challenge The Ultimate Challenge will be made accessible after all three episodes have been broadcast, and can only be accessed if the challenger enters all three passwords correctly. Once it is accessed, the first three eligible people to solve the Ultimate Challenge go through to the Finale. Stage 3: The Finale The Finale took place at Bletchley Park during the weekend of 10 September 2011. The prize, a specially commissioned mathematical sculpture of the platonic solids , was won by Pete Ryland.

The magazine, which has been based at Amherst College since 2011, publishes issues of stories, poems, essays, and images biannually. The magazine focuses its efforts on the motif of \\"a modern sense of place,\\" and works to give the underrepresented artistic voices a literary space.  History  The magazine's prototype issue, 00, was published in October, 2010. In early 2011, Jennifer Acker obtained an investment from Amherst College as a literary magazine focused on the motif of place in fiction, poetry, nonfiction, and visual arts. The magazine is published by The Common Foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. At the magazine's inception, Amherst College provided an on- campus office, a website, funding for start-up costs, and the budget for a staff of student interns. One former student employee, Diana Babineau, had transitioned into a full-time employee of the magazine as the managing editor under Acker. Since 2016, Emily Everett has worked as the managing editor of The Common. The College hosts the magazine's offices in its Robert Frost Library. The Common′s partnership with Amherst College extends beyond the administration. The English Department, Creative Writing Center, and student- run prose and poetry magazine Circus have all collaborated with The Common in the past for events, public readings, book fairs, and writing workshops. Additionally, some professors at the College, including William Pritchard and Pulitzer Prize winner Richard Wilbur, have served on the editorial board. Since the magazine's founding, Jennifer Acker has periodically worked as a professor at the College, teaching some The Common′s pieces, among others. With this support, The Common launched its first issue, 01, in April 2011. The magazine has published seventeen issues to date, with an eighteenth expected in October, 2019.  Content and Editors  The Common has published new fiction by Lauren Groff, Fiona Maazel, Sabina Murray, and Teresa Svoboda, essays by Sarah Smarsh, W. Ralph Eubanks, and Susan Straight, and poems by Rafael Campo, Don Share, Honor Moore, Bob Hicok, Fatimah Asghar, David Lehman, J. D. McClatchy, John Freeman, and Mary Jo Salter. The magazine has featured part by Rico Gatson and Martha Rosler. Its prototype issue included a piece by Jim Shepard. The magazine has also published the work of debut writers, poets, and photographers. Beyond the biannual issues, the magazine publishes literary features online, all freely available to the public. The website includes interviews, a fledgling podcast series, called Contributors in Conversation, a monthly recommendation of books from the authors and staff of The Common, called Friday Reads, Dispatches, short missives written by contributors evoking a particular sense of place, and other features not published in the print editions.  Critical Responses and Awards  In 2014, the magazine's first year of eligibility, the National Endowment for the Arts awarded The Common an Art Works Grant. Other authors and writers, whose works have not been included in The Common, have praised the magazine and some of the stories it has published. The Best American Series, whose editors have included Dave Eggers, Denise Duhamel, Cheryl Strayed, Elizabeth Strout, and Mark Doty, has named particular The Common issues and stories as belonging to their top lists of prose, poetry, and essays between the years 2012-2014. The 26th Annual New York Book Show recognized The Common Issues 01 and 02, earning the magazine a second place literary magazine design award. Other contributors to The Common have had their work featured by Longform, Literary Hub, and Utne Reader. Others have won prizes from PEN America, New England Poetry Club, Craft Literary, O. Henry Award 2017, and the Pushcart Prize. The journal's editorial vision and design has also been praised in The New Yorker, The Boston Globe, Slate, The Millions, Orion Magazine, and The Chronicle of Higher Education. The magazine has won the CLMP Firecracker Award 2016. In 2019, The Common received the Literary Magazine Prize from the Mrs. Giles Whiting Foundation.

Caracciolo entered the Order of the Knights Hospitaller at a young age. In 1378 he was appointed as prior of Capua. In 1382, pope Urban VI deposed the order's Grand Master, Juan Fernández de Heredia, who had sided for Antipope Clement VII and, in the April 1383, replaced him with Caracciolo. The latter was supported by the priories of Rome, Messina, Barletta, Pisa and Capua, as well as the prior of Bohemia. They were followed by the knights of England and Ireland in 1384, and later also Hungary and part of Germany. However, the main base of the order, in Rhodes, remained faithful to Heredia. Caracciolo spent his period as master mostly at the papal court, also after Urban died, being replaced by Boniface IX. In 1391 he was chosen as mediator between the warring Republic of Venice and Gian Galeazzo Visconti, Duke of Milan; he later performed the same tasks with other Italian rival communes and lords. He died in Rome in 1395, and was buried in Santa Maria del Priorato.

Upon the conclusion of his studies, Brown joined Essex, making his first-class debut for the county against Yorkshire in the 1988 County Championship. In competition with David East for most of his time at Essex, he found his opportunities limited, making just 4 further first-class appearances, the last of which came against Nottinghamshire. In his 5 first-class appearances for Essex, he scored 13 runs at an average of 6.50, with a high score of 6 not out, while behind the stumps he took 13 catches and made 3 stumpings. While at Essex he also played List A cricket, making his debut in that format for the county against Yorkshire in the 1988 Refuge Assurance League. He made 2 further List A appearances for Essex in 1988, against Wiltshire in the NatWest Trophy and Hampshire in the Refuge Assurance League. While at Essex, with opportunities limited he appeared once more for Suffolk in Minor counties cricket from 1989 onwards, making a total of 92 Minor Counties Championship and 19 MCCA Knockout Trophy appearances for Suffolk up to his retirement at the end of the 1999 season. Indeed, while still at Essex he continued to play List A cricket for his native county, appearing in 3 List A matches while still playing for Essex. He would make a further 4 List A appearances for Suffolk, the last of which came against the Hampshire Cricket Board in the 1999 NatWest Trophy. In total, Brown played 8 List A matches for Suffolk, scoring 67 runs at an average of 9.57, with a high score of 51. This score came against Northamptonshire in the 1989 NatWest Trophy.

These clocks were made exclusively in the Black Forest region of Germany. They are highly collectible, and many collectors consider the trumpeter clock to be one of the most desirable of all the clocks produced in the region during the second half of the 19th century. The first trumpeter clocks Jakob Bäuerle of Furtwangen Germany has been given credit as the first to combine a mechanism that produces a trumpeters call with a clock. This was most likely first done in the year 1857.* Miller, Justin (2012), Rare and Unusual Black Forest Clocks, Schiffer, p. 145. The first trumpeter clocks were very simple in design, producing a simple bugle call that is reproduced once for each hour. In the later years the musical abilities of the clocks greatly improved, and many examples were made to produce complex musical tunes. Although many different makers made the trumpeter clocks, Emilian Wehrle was without question the undisputed leader of trumpeter clock production and design.* Miller, Justin (2012), Rare and Unusual Black Forest Clocks, Schiffer, p. 161-165. Variations A trumpeter clock can be found in several different variations. The most common examples are known to collectors as a \\"blowers\\" or \\"German buglers\\".* Miller, Justin (2012), Rare and Unusual Black Forest Clocks, Schiffer, p. 146. These examples use a modified cuckoo type movement that produces a simple trumpet like call. Instead of using a wooden cuckoo pipe, these examples have small reed/horn assemblies. This varies from the large trumpeter clocks that use a large bellows system that feeds air into a wind chest. A pinned music wheel controls a series of valves to reproduce a complex musical tune. Value The values of trumpeter clocks vary widely with some examples selling for tens of thousands of dollars. While all trumpeter clocks are desirable, the examples that play complex musical tunes are generally more valuable then the simpler \\"blower\\" variety. The large heavily carved shelf cases which are adorned with full relief animals have consistently brought the highest prices at auction. * Miller, Justin (2012), Rare and Unusual Black Forest Clocks, Schiffer, p. 156.

It was released on 1 May 2011 by Tate Publishing. Apart from the title @earth (which is also in different languages on its back cover) the pocket book contains no words and its story is told in sequences of constructed images. @earth combines images created digitally over the preceding two years by Kennard with Salhany especially for the project, with Kennard's earlier darkroom based photomontages (spanning over 40 years of work) some of which are part of the Tate Permanent Collection. They have been recontextualised for the book. The authors met when Kennard taught Salhany at the Byam Shaw School of Art in London. Naomi Klein, the author of No Logo and The Shock Doctrine, said of @earth: \\"This book perfectly captures the brutal asymmetries of our age: heavy weaponry trained on broken people, all-seeing technologies and disappearing identities, perpetually exhaling industry and an asphyxiating planet.

She is a two times Paralympic gold medalist and three times World Championship gold medalist in the 1500m race. Pautova also broke the world record in the T13 5000m event in 2003. Career history Pautova, who is visually impaired, first took to athletics while she attended a specialised boarding school in Armavir, Russia. She began competing competitively whilst still a teenager, and she competed in both middle and long distance events. At the age of 17 she entered an international meet in Quebec, Canada and ran in a T13 5000m contest. There she posted an officially recognized time of 17:50.45, a new world record. Due to the rarity of official T13 5000m races at major competitions, Pautova's record, as of 2013, still stands. Pautova then switched to middle-distance events, and at the age of 18 she was selected for her first Paralympics, chosen to represent Russia at the 2004 Summer Paralympics in Athens. It was an extremely successful competition for Pautova, winning the gold medal in the T12 1500m and a bronze medal in the T12 800m. In 2006, she travelled to Assen where she took part in the Athletics World Championships. There she entered her favoured two events the 800, and 1,500m, and finished with an identical result to Athens; a gold in the 1,500m and bronze in the 800m. She returned to the Paralympics in 2008 in Beijing, China, winning two more bronze medals in the T13 1500m and the joint classified T12/13 800m. In 2011, she retained her World title in the 1,500m, successfully defending it at the 2011 IPC Athletics World Championships in Christchurch, New Zealand. Then in the run-up to the 2012 London Paralympics, she took the gold, again in the 1,500m, at the 2012 European Championships in Stadskanaal. In London she posted a season's best of 4:37.65 to beat her nearest rival, Spain's Elena Congost, by almost seven seconds to take her second Paralympic gold medal. After her triumph in London, Pautova was awarded the Order of Honour, and received her medal form President Vladimir Putin at a ceremony held in the Kremlin. In 2013 Pautova secured a third World gold title in the 1,500m with a win at the 2013 IPC Athletics World Championships in Lyon, making her the undefeated World champion at that distance for eight years.

Retrieved January 12, 2012.) is an American painter known for his expressionist urban paintings and murals, mostly of New York City. Christopher began as a commercial artist, and has become a painter with worldwide galleries and exhibitions. Life and art Christopher sketching on the streets of New York Early life and work Christopher was born in Hollywood, California. He initially studied at the Pasadena Museum of California Art in 1974. He then went Art Center College of Design in Pasadena to receive his Bachelor in Fine Arts in 1979 where he studied with the noted California artists Lorser Feitelson and Ward Kimball. He supported himself during school by doing drawings at Disney in Anaheim. Christopher grew up \\"in the LA hot rod / skateboard culture\\" which influenced his art. Christopher started his art career with commercial art in California. His first work was for CBS Records. He received a gold record for his work on promotional posters. He also worked for Motor Trend magazine. In 1981 he moved to New York City, and worked for the New York Times, People, Fortune and Wall Street Journal, as well as a courtroom artist for CBS news, covering trials as diverse as John Lennon's shooter and \\"The Diet Doc Killer\\" Jean Harris. Transition to fine art Christopher began creating fine art in the mid 80's with \\"...painting household objects and tools on a Brobdingnagian scale\\" in addition to making cast-iron sculptures, which were featured \\"...in galleries in the East Village\\". These works were most notably featured in Socrates Sculpture Park, Oil and Steel Gallery (L.I.C. NY 1992) and the \\"Tools as Art: The Hechinger Collection\\" at National Building Museum Washington D.C. (1990s). Transition to current style The early 1990s also marked the start of Tom Christopher's signature NYC paintings. The first gallery to feature this was the Saint Marks Gallery in 1990. After receiving more success and reception with this style, he slowly switched to primarily this style in the 90's, and \\"Now his subject matter is largely focused on the streets of New York.\\" Recent  Virtual reality fine art installations  Partnering with the Fashion Institute of Technology's Department of Fine Art Media Laboratory, Tom Christopher and students from FIT will create three Bronx- specific VR experiences for the Montefiore Medical Center. Patients will experience the environment seeking to diminish anxiety, pain and opioid addiction through stimulus-rich, curated artistic environments. The FIT Exhibition: The Future Is Immersive has featured some of Tom Christopher's work. The first of three projects is a virtual city block, made up of elements from different streets to create a \\"virtual\\" city block typical of the South Bronx. Christopher and students sketched on site and took photographs which were used to make preliminary drawings before translating via Tilt Brush into a virtual 3D canvas. \\"The process allows you to blow it up to the size of a billboard, or shrink it to the size of an ant. Walk through or around or hover from above.  Paseo Caribe Mural Project  In 2016 Tom Christopher collaborated with art students from Escuela de Artes Plásticas y Diseño to create a public space mural. Christopher recently did a black and white series of paintings in a \\"New York is Noir Again\\" collection. He currently works out of his studio, Lift Trucks Project in North Salem, New York. Most paintings seem to go overseas to international art fairs and Galerie Barbara von Stechow in Frankfurt, and Galerie Tamenaga in Paris, Osaka and Tokyo. Christopher has also recently been experimenting with collage-style paintings and silkscreens that utilize multiple images and layers with Master Printer Gary Lichtenstein.http://www.garylichtensteineditions.com/Collaborations/Gary_Lichtenstein_Artists.php?artist=Christopher They had a show together at Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum, Ridgefield, Connecticut entitled \\"35 Years of Screenprinting\\". Lift Trucks Project In 2010 Christopher founded Lift Trucks Project in Croton Falls, New York. It is an alternative art space with exhibitions featuring works from FA-Q, Christo, Ottmar Hoerl, Ed Roth (\\"Big Daddy\\"), A. R. Penck, Sailor Jerry, and others. Brill Building In the summer of 2014, Tom Christopher and Oscar Andy Hammerstein took a studio residence in the Brill Building windows during its renovations. The art project was conducted as an installation and an inside look into the artistic process. The subject matter was Times Square and the streets of New York City. Classifications Christopher is known for his New York City urban paintings. Most of the work is painted using small-batch, handmade acrylic paint. Pencil lines from the initial exploratory sketch stage often remain on the white canvass. His typical images include cabbies, delivery men, skylines, and chaotic New York City scenes. His work is usually done with acrylic paint in an expressionist style. Critical reception Christopher is most notable in the New York City art scene, with mostly positive reviews from sources such as The New York Times. One article features a quote by former NYC Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who stated \\"Tom has an uncanny talent for capturing the essence of New York City from the perspective of those who have enjoyed the sights of the city on foot.\\" He has also received acclaim through his museum exhibitions: he was included in the 1999 \\"New, New York Views\\" exhibition at Museum of the City of New York, and recently had a \\"Metropolis\\" exhibition at Butler Institute of American Art. The Butler Institute of American Art Director and Chief Curator Dr. Louis A. Zona stated that Christopher \\"...has bridged the gap between pure narrative painting and expressionist abstraction. He has become to American painting what Count Basie or Duke Ellington became to American popular music, not completely jazz but certainly owing much to Charlie Parker and Charlie Mingus.\\" Applied projects A clothing line by Illusions was introduced in 2020. In 2019 Christopher's studio and flash art collection was featured on American Pickers. Christopher has done work on a line of clothing with Urban Outfitters and Nordstroms entitled \\"Threads4Thought\\". He also was commissioned by Michel Roux for the \\"Absolut Collection\\" for Absolut Vodka and was included in the \\"Absolut Book\\" by Richard Lewis. Christopher has also designed a \\"Cruzer\\" line of snowboards for Burton Snowboards. In addition, he was commissioned to paint an oversized baseball for the New York Yankees for their 2000 game against the Atlanta Braves. thumb|Tom Christopher, I Like New York Because Everything Interesting Can Be Found There, 2012, The NYU Langone Medical Center Art Collection Exhibitions Selected solo exhibitions *St. Marks Gallery New York 1990 *Eastmann Wahmendorf Gallery, Helio Gallery, New York 1990 *Tamenaga Gallery, New York: 1993, 1994 *Michael Owen Gallery, New York: 1996 *David Findlay Galleries, New York: 1997, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2005 *Galerie Tamenaga, Tokyo, Osaka: 1997, 1999, 2002, 2004, 2007,2010 *Galerie Tamenaga, Paris: 1999, 2001, 2004, 2006, 2009,2011,2013,2014,2015, 2016 *Galerie Barbara von Stechow, Frankfurt: 1999, 2002, 2004,2007,2009,2012,2013,2014,2015, 2016 *Galerie Vomel, Düsseldorf: 2004, 2006, 2010 *Van Brunt Gallery, Beacon, NY: 2007 *Conde Nast Building, NYC Per Cent for Art Commission, 2007 *The Butler Institute of American Art, Youngstown Ohio: May 2008 *HSBC, Trinkaus and Burkhardt, Frankfurt: 2007, Hamburg: 2008 *J.N.

In 1854, he married Charlotte Stuart and would have three children with her including Henry S. Elliott.The Land We Love: A Monthly Magazine Devoted to Literature, Military History and Agriculture.

American Civil War  Elliott served in the Confederate States Army within South Carolina from the beginning of the Civil War in 1861 until the spring of 1864, advancing from captain to colonel. In order to participate in the bombardment of Fort Sumter, he attached himself to a different unit than his Beaufort Volunteer Artillery company. The Beaufort Artillery company became an infantry company, so Elliott started his official Confederate Army service as a captain in the 11th South Carolina Volunteer Infantry Regiment. He participated in the defense of Port Royal, South Carolina. He was wounded in the leg at an engagement at Fort Beauregard, South Carolina on November 7, 1861. In August 1862, he was appointed Chief of Artillery for the 3rd military district of South Carolina. He also made some raids against Union targets after the Union Army captured the South Carolina coastal islands, including making attacks with torpedoes. On April 9, 1863, his raiders sank the steamer George Washington. In 1863, he became major and then lieutenant colonel of artillery. For a time in late 1863, he commanded the Confederate force at Fort Sumter, where he received a head wound during the bombardment of Charleston by Union forces on December 11, 1863. In the spring of 1864, Elliott was in command of Holcombe's Legion. At that time, he was ordered to Petersburg, Virginia with his regiment. He took command of Brigadier General Nathan G. Evans' old brigade in the Army of Northern Virginia. He commanded his brigade at the Battle of the Wilderness. On May 24, 1864, Elliott was promoted to brigadier general. On June 16, 1864, Elliott's brigade counterattacked after a Union Army assault took some advanced Confederate trenches in the Petersburg defenses, establishing a salient in the Confederate line.Slotkin, 2009, pp. 60–61 On July 30, 1864, Elliott's brigade was defending the Confederate line at Elliott's Salient near the spot the Union Army's mine blew, which precipitated the Battle of the Crater. Elliott's brigade had nearly 700 soldiers killed or wounded in the explosion and ensuing battle.Slotkin, 2009, p. 328 Elliott was asleep in a \\"bombproof\\" near the line and awakened to find the destruction and chaos surrounding him.Slotkin, 2009, p. 187 Finding no troops nearby since he was close to the site of the explosion, he went to find his remaining men and organize a counterattack in line with a previous plan to deal with such a mine attack.Slotkin, 2009, p. 195 After finding two of his regiments mainly intact, Elliott led them forward, positioning them to defend against an assault and to counterattack. He then impatiently jumped on the parapet to lead his men in the attack. At this moment, Elliott was seriously wounded in the chest and left arm. After several months recovering from his wounds, which in fact had not healed properly,Bradley, Mark L. Last Stand in the Carolinas: The Battle of Bentonville. Campbell, CA: Savas Publishing Co., 1995. p. 33. Elliott joined General Joseph E. Johnston's Army of Tennessee in North Carolina, where he led a brigade of former Charleston defenders and largely untested soldiers.Bradley, 1995. p. 33 From January 2, 1865 through March 1865, the brigade was in Taliaferro's division of Hardee's corps. For the few remaining weeks of the war, the brigade was in Anderson's division of Stewart's corps. At the Battle of Bentonville on March 19, 1865, Elliott ordered his brigade to charge the Union left flank when he found that his line overlapped the Union line. The Union skirmish line was surprised and put to flight. The brigade's success did not last as they were broken and sent into retreat when they charged the strong Union main line, which was supported by artillery.Bradley, 1995, pp. 279–283 At the point where the Confederate retreat halted, in the middle of an artillery barrage, Elliott tried to reform his brigade for another assault, despite receiving a piece of shrapnel in his leg.Bradley, 1995, p. 286 In the event, Confederate commanders saw that the brigade was too shaken to make another attack and they were ordered simply to kneel or lie down and hold their ground.Bradley, 1995, p. 290 Elliott had again received another serious wound. His brigade surrendered with Johnston's army at Bennett Place near Durham Station, North Carolina.Bradley, Mark L. This Astounding Close: The Road to Bennett Place. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2000. pp. 214–217, 294. Elliott had been sent home to convalesce from his latest wound before Johnston's surrender.Trescot, 1866, p. 27 Although the Eichers found no record of his parole or pardon, in his 1866 eulogy, Trescot noted that he had received a special Executive pardon at the request of Union General Quincy Gillmore, commanding at Hilton Head Island near Elliott's hut.Trescot, 1866, p. 28  Aftermath  After the Civil War, Elliott found that his plantation property had been seized for nonpayment of taxes and distributed to his former slaves.Slotkin, 2009, p. 345 They treated him well upon his return but it made it clear that the land no longer belonged to him. Thereafter, he returned to a home in Charleston and a former fishing hut at the seashore, began to make a living as a fisherman and was again elected to the South Carolina legislature. However, he was completely debilitated by his wounds and exposure and died before taking office on February 21, 1866,Freeman, Douglas S. Lee's Lieutenants: A Study in Command. Volume 3, p. 777.

Ceremonial preparation vs. natural desiccation Aztec mummies were often placed in a seated position Distinctions must be made between intentionally prepared Aztec mummies and mummies resulting from natural desiccation. Prepared Aztec mummy “bundles” consist of the remains of the deceased placed in a woven bag or wrap which was often adorned with a ceremonial mask. Most of the more widely known examples of Aztec mummies, which formed the basis of popular traveling exhibitions and museum exhibits in the 19th Century, were likely the product of natural desiccation rather than an intentional mummification process. Unlike Egyptian mummies, which were typically placed in an extended supine position within a sarcophagus, Aztec mummies were typically placed in seated positions. To maintain the pose of the body, the remains were often secured within a cloth wrapping, sometimes with rope. Symbolism in Aztec hieroglyphs A hieroglyph depicting the mummy of the deceased Aztec ruler, Ahuitzotl, followed by his living successor. A mummy is the Aztec hieroglyph for death. In Aztec written documentation of historical events, such as the death of a ruler or warrior, a mummy glyph will be connected to a glyph denoting the person's name and another glyph denoting the year of the event. The pictured example of Aztec hieroglyphs shows the mummy of a human figure bound with ropes, with a crown on its head, indicating the death of a ruler. The small water-animal attached to the crown by a cord shows that the dead ruler's name was Ahuitzotl, that being the Aztec word for \\"water-animal\\". The right half of the glyph shows a man seated upon a dais, with a crown on his head and a speech-scroll issuing from his mouth. The Aztec word for ruler was \\"tlahtouani\\", \\"he who speaks\\", shown graphically by the speech-scroll. Finally both figures are attached by cords to the circle above, which represents the year \\"10-Rabbit\\" (1502 A.D.), indicating the date of this event. Cultural references In the late 19th Century, resurrected Aztec mummies replaced their Egyptian counterparts in popular American stories such as The Squaw Hollow Sensation, which appeared in 1879 and told the story of \\"the discovery and revival of a 1000-year-old Aztec mummy\\". Aztec mummy-themed stories continued in American novels, films, comic books, and television throughout the 20th century and into the 21st century. Notable examples include fictional confrontations between Aztec mummies and the Lone Ranger (comic book), Kolchak (television), and Mil Mascaras vs. the Aztec Mummy (film). Aztec mummy-themed horror films produced in Mexico include La Momia Azteca, which was the first of a trilogy of films produced in 1957 featuring a resurrected Aztec warrior named Popoca, followed by The Curse of the Aztec Mummy and The Robot vs. The Aztec Mummy. The later film Wrestling Women vs. the Aztec Mummy (1964) featured a resurrected Aztec warrior named Tezomoc,Hardy, Phil (1995). \\"The Overlook Film Encyclopedia Horror. Overlook Press. . Page 164 and Mexican mummies were again featured in The Mummies of Guanajuato.https://www.filmaffinity.com/en/film806061.html Unlike the Aztec mummies appearing in most American film and television productions, which are typically mummified as part of a ceremonial process similar to Egyptian mummies, Mexican horror films typically involve the resurrection of naturally desiccated Aztec warriors. The 2007 American film Mil Mascaras vs. the Aztec Mummy, starring the aforementioned Mexican superstar wrestler Mil Máscaras, features the ceremonial resurrection of a mummy in a sarcophagus that is more reminiscent of Egyptian mummies than Aztec ones.

The mission of the DGS is to provide objective earth science information, advice, and service to citizens, policy makers, industries, and educational institutions of Delaware. The DGS became formally affiliated with the university's College of Earth, Ocean, and Environment (CEOE) in July 2008. Most DGS scientists have secondary faculty appointments in the College's Department of Geological Sciences. The DGS is one of the 50 state geological surveys in the United States. By statute, the DGS is the state agency responsible for entering into agreements with its counterpart federal agencies, including the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the USGS Office of Minerals Information (formerly the U.S. Bureau of Mines), and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (formerly the U.S. Minerals Management Service), and for administering all cooperative programs of the state with these agencies.  Establishment  A geologic survey of Delaware was originally authorized in 1837 for a period of four years under the direction of James C. Booth, State Geologist. A permanent state geological survey was established by the Delaware General Assembly in 1951 and is funded by direct state appropriation. The 1951 statute founding the Survey contains its fundamental charges: study the geology of Delaware, investigate mineral and water resources, advise state government, and provide the results of its studies to the citizens and agencies of Delaware through publication and consultation. Additional responsibilities have been assigned over the years as the varied applications of the Survey’s basic mission were recognized: notable among these are spatial data coordination, direct support for emergency planning, response, and recovery, and involvement in water- supply planning.  Past Directors  The Director of the DGS also serves as the official State Geologist and is a member of the Association of American State Geologists. The Director also has a secondary appointment with the UD Dept of Geological Sciences. Past Directors include: * James C. Booth, 1837–1841 * Johan J. Groot, 1951–1969 * Robert R.

Founding drummer, Jack Irons returned the band the previous year to finish out the band's tour and record the next album, The Uplift Mofo Party Plan, which ended up being the only album and full tour to feature the four founding band members: Anthony Kiedis, Flea, Hillel Slovak and Irons. It was the band's biggest tour at the time and featured their first trip to Europe. Kiedis, who started to develop a major drug problem on the previous tour, started to fall deeper into his addiction and Slovak's addiction to heroin only grew stronger as well. Slovak died of a heroin overdose a few weeks after the end of the tour on June 25, 1988. The surviving three members regrouped for a small boat trip with then manager, Lindy Goetz. It was there that Irons decided he could no longer deal with being in the band and Slovak's death was too hard for him to handle so he decided to quit the band again, this time for good. A 30-minute film titled Red Hot Skate Rock was released in 1988. The footage was shot on September 20, 1987, in Los Angeles, California, by Vision Street Wear and featured an 8-song set by the band while many of the top skaterboarders from that era performed demos. The film was released on DVD in 2002 under the name, Vision: Vision DVD Volume 2. Tour The Chili Peppers noted that during the tour, their fan base had rapidly increased both in size and enthusiasm. Kiedis recalled \\"During the Uplift tour I remember actually feeling a change taking place not just in the amount of people showing up at the gigs but the intensity of the fan base.\\"Mullen, 2010. p. 165 Flea added that \\"We were in love with those songs and how much fun we were having playing them.\\" Despite the band's new enthusiasm, Kiedis and Slovak continued to struggle with their worsening drug addictions. Kiedis was even briefly fired by the band prior to the tour. Both Kiedis and Slovak stopped using heroin prior to the tour and decided to help each other \\"steer clear\\" of the drug.(2002) \\"Behind the Music: Red Hot Chili Peppers episode\\". VH1.Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 208 During the tour both experienced intense heroin withdrawal, with Slovak much more unstable than Kiedis. His withdrawal symptoms took a toll on his ability to play his instrument; at one point Slovak had a mental breakdown and was unable to play a show, leaving the rest of the band to play an entire set with no guitar.Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 216 He recovered a few days later, but his bandmates felt he was not healthy enough to perform and replaced Slovak with DeWayne McKnight for a few shows.Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 219 After a few days with McKnight, the band decided to give Slovak another chance, and he rejoined for the European leg of the tour. Kiedis attempted to take Slovak to drug addiction counseling, but Slovak had difficulty admitting that his addiction was serious enough to require medical help.Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 221 The tour is also notable for Faith No More being an opening act for the final two months. Faith No More is said to have been heavily influenced by the Chili Peppers sound which is very evident with their first major label album. A long feud between Kiedis and future Faith No More frontman Mike Patton started in 1989 where Kiedis accused Patton of ripping off his sound and style.http://anthonykiedis.net/about-the-man/mike-pattonmr-bungle- feud/http://www.faithnomorefollowers.com/2016/08/faith-no-more-vs-red-hot- chili-peppers.htmlhttp://anthonykiedis.net/magazine- scansarticles/1990-1994/1990-3/kerrang-june-1990-292/ Patton has stated that at the time of the tour, Faith No More were \\"really big in Europe and enjoying a lot more notoriety than the Chili Peppers were\\" which annoyed Kiedis and sparked the grudge.http://www.avclub.com/article/mike-patton-of-mr- bungle-13625 The feud would continue for years with Patton's other band, Mr. Bungle, impersonating the Chili Peppers onstage during a Halloween show in 1999 including making fun of Slovak's death and pretending to shoot up heroin on stage. Around that time, Patton had given an interview accusing Red Hot Chili Peppers of sabotaging potential bookings for Mr. Bungle.http://www.avclub.com/article/mike-patton-of-mr-bungle-13625 Slovak's death Upon returning home, Slovak isolated himself from the rest of his bandmates, and struggled to resist the drug without the mutual support provided by his friends, Kiedis in particular. A few weeks after the band returned from the tour, the members attempted to get in contact with Slovak, but were unable to find him for several days. Slovak was found dead by police in his Hollywood apartment on June 27, 1988. During his autopsy, authorities determined that he had died on June 25, 1988 due to a heroin overdose. Irons subsequently left the group, saying that he did not want to be part of a group where his friends were dying. Kiedis and Flea debated whether they should continue making music, but ultimately decided to move ahead, hoping to continue what Slovak \\"helped build\\".Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 224 DeWayne McKnight replaced Slovak but was quickly fired from the band after three shows while Irons' replacement, D.H. Peligro would last long enough to play some shows with eighteen-year-old guitarist John Frusciante, who was a fan of the group and idolized Slovak. Peligro was replaced in November 1988 after the group held a lengthy open auditions and eventually chose drummer Chad Smith. Songs performed Tour overview Out of the album's eleven songs, \\"Walkin' on Down the Road\\" is the only one to never be performed live. Flea mentioned that \\"Behind the Sun\\" was played live only one time in 1987, but the band was not very happy with the result, so they never played it live again. During the tour the band played a Jimi Hendrix tribute show on September 2, 1987. Kiedis provided vocals on a cover of \\"Foxy Lady\\" while Bob Forrest and members of Fishbone provided vocals on the other songs with the Chili Peppers as the backup band. The band also played a special show minus Kiedis on April 2, 1988 with Bob Forrest fronting the band. The tour also marked the first appearance of an instrumental jam that later became \\"Magic Johnson\\" on their next album, Mother's Milk. This tour marked the last time \\"Battleship\\", \\"Behind the Sun\\", \\"Buckle Down\\" and \\"No Chump Love Sucker\\" were performed live.

The organization is founded on the idea that America's next generation of leaders will require global citizenship to effectively address the problems of the 21st century.  History  Global Citizen Year was founded after Abigail Falik won first place in the 2008 Harvard Business School Pitch for Change with her blueprint for the idea. After graduating from high school, Falik had looked for an opportunity for global service before college but found that the Peace Corps would not accept 18-year-olds, and that few similar programs existed for that age group. Abigail has since dedicated her professional life to creating new opportunities for young Americans to learn about the world. Falik received a B.A. and M.Ed. from Stanford University, and an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School. The inaugural class of Global Citizen Year Fellows was chosen in 2009. Initially, Fellows traveled to Guatemala and Senegal; in 2010 the program expanded placements to Brazil and Ecuador.  Program  Global Citizen Year currently operates programs in Brazil, Senegal, Ecuador, and India and is expanding to other countries in the coming years. The program begins during the summer after Fellows graduate from high school with a summer organizing and fundraising campaign where Fellows raise funds to support scholarships and learn to use social media to engage their community.\\"Program\\", The Experience: Train, www.globalcitizenyear.org, 2011-08-02. Global Citizen Year Fellows travel to San Francisco in the fall for extensive pre-departure training in language, global issues, international development, and social entrepreneurship. After the training in California, the Fellows travel to their respective countries and stay in the capital city for a in-country training block. They are then supported by team leaders and fellow Fellows during an eight-month homestay and apprenticeship with a community-based organization in their host country. Fellows complete apprenticeships in a variety of fields and projects including public health, agriculture, social enterprise, and girls’ and women's empowerment. The time spent in the country is divided into blocks which are separated by training seminars. These seminars last around four days and are a time for Fellows to share stories, talk about common social issues and reflect on their experience.\\"Program\\", The Experience: Immerse, www.globalcitizenyear.org, 2011-08-02. During the program, Fellows are required to blog about their experience whether through posts or videos. Upon return, Fellows complete a re-entry training before transitioning back home and sharing their experiences through a final capstone project.  Recognition  For her work in launching Global Citizen Year in 2009, Abigail Falik was awarded a Draper Richards Fellowship for entrepreneurs who are using innovative solutions to create scalable social change. She is a recipient of the Mind Trust Fellowship for education entrepreneurs who are developing system-changing strategies to tackle education's greatest challenges, as well as a Harvard Business School Social Entrepreneurship Fellow.\\"Abigail Falik chosen as Harvard Business School Social Entrepreneurship Fellow\\", HBS Newsroom, 2009-07-21.  Bridge years in the United States  In the United States, the practice of taking a “bridge year” remains a relatively uncommon practice, but in recent years the idea has begun to gain traction. Students often report academic burnout, the desire to learn about the world before college, or a desire to better understand themselves as motivations for participating.Sue Shellenbarger, \\"Delaying College to Fill in the Gaps\\" The Wall Street Journal, 2010-12-29. Some universities such as Princeton University, Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, and Reed College have instituted formal policies allowing students to defer admission for the purpose of taking a gap year. Thirty \\"bridge fairs\\" promoting a variety of programs are hosted around the country – up from just a handful when the fairs began in the late 2000s. The practice has historically been more common among students with some level of personal or family funding, but an increasing number of organizations now offer scholarship funds to make bridge years more accessible to students of all economic backgrounds.
