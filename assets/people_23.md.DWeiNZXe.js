It was directed by Heitor Dhalia, and stars Selton Mello. The film was produced by Gera√ß√£o Conte√∫do, Primo Filmes & RT Features.  Plot  Louren√ßo is a lonely pawn shop owner whose work made him insensitive to the suffering of those who desperately seek to sell him their personal possessions. Louren√ßo's insensitivity causes him to deal with the world as a collection of objects to be bought. He begins to play power games with his customers and derives pleasure from it. Louren√ßo narrates the movie, and throughout the plot, he reveals his growing lust for power. The literal name of the movie (\\"The Smell from the Drain\\") refers to the persistent bad odor that comes from the restroom in Louren√ßo's office. Louren√ßo's lust for power is symbolized by this very scent. He slowly comes to realize that the stench from the drain actually comes from him. Louren√ßo's life changes when he becomes infatuated with a local waitress, whose physical attributes become yet another object to him, and as with any other object, he desires to possess her.

Just posterior to the primary somatosensory cortex lies the somatosensory association cortex, which integrates sensory information from the primary somatosensory cortex (temperature, pressure, etc.) to construct an understanding of the object being felt. Inferior to the frontal lobes are found the olfactory bulbs, which receive sensory input from the olfactory nerves and route those signals throughout the brain. Not all olfactory information is routed to the olfactory cortex: some neural fibers are routed to the supraorbital region of the frontal lobe, while others are routed directly to limbic structures. The direct limbic connection makes the olfactory sense unique. The brain cortical regions are related to the auditory, visual, olfactory, and somatosensory (touch, proprioception) sensations, which are located lateral to the lateral fissure and posterior to the central sulcus, that is, more toward the back of the brain. The cortical region related to gustatory sensation is located anterior to the central sulcus. Note that the central sulcus (sometimes referred to as the central fissure) divides the primary motor cortex (on the precentral gyrus of the posterior frontal lobe) from the primary somatosensory cortex (on the postcentral gyrus of the anterior parietal lobe).

These songs, visor, are traditionally very narrative and the performance is \\"acted\\" to some degree. The singer is in context a viss√•ngare, a troubadour character. √Ökerstr√∂m was also known for his actor's interpretations of Bellman's 18th century material, and his unusual ability to reach deep bass notes (especially on his interpretation of Bellman's song Glimmande nymf). Life √Ökerstr√∂m was born in Stockholm to a family of meager circumstances, which would later influence the social, economic, and political criticisms found in many of his works and public appearances. He may have aspired at an early age to become a viss√•ngare, being a devoted listener to Ruben Nilson. After performances at the famous vispr√•men \\"Storken,\\" he released his first record in 1963, Fred √Ökerstr√∂m sjunger Ruben Nilson. He was a contemporary of Cornelis Vreeswijk, and the two were at times very close, touring together and releasing a joint record, early in their careers. He became an alcoholic in later life. His daughter CajsaStina √Ökerstr√∂m is also a singer. Bellman interpreter √Ökerstr√∂m believed that Bellman had been misinterpreted by an earlier generation of artists: far from being a jolly and romantic person, Bellman was, √Ökerstr√∂m thought, an accurate social reporter of poverty, sickness, death and suffering. Like Vreeswijk, √Ökerstr√∂m was a major interpreter of Carl Michael Bellman's songs, giving them \\"a new and more powerful expression\\" than they had had before, starting with his live performance of one of Fredman's Epistles, \\"N√• skruva fiolen\\" in 1964. He published ten albums containing Bellman songs, of which three were dedicated to that subject: Fred sjunger Bellman in 1969; Glimmande nymf in 1974; and Vila vid denna k√§lla in 1977. His performances increased in intensity until it seemed to audience and critics that √Ökerstr√∂m was identifying himself with Bellman. In his book Ingenstans fri som en f√•gel, Peter Mosskin wrote of √Ökerstr√∂m that no-one in two hundred years had succeeded better at bringing Bellman to life, making the story of his music an important element in Swedish cultural history. His later Bellman recordings combined his guitar with cello and flute.

It is a budget version of the S&W; Model 27. Development The Model 28, also known as the Highway Patrolman, traces its heritage back to the Smith & Wesson Registered Magnum. The Registered Magnum morphed into the 357 Magnum (first production model completed April 8, 1935). The 357 Magnum was temporarily discontinued in 1941 when S&W; turned their focus to wartime production, but was reintroduced in December 1948 with the new series beginning at serial number S72000. The new 357 Magnum had been modernized to incorporate the rebound slide operated hammer block and the new short throw hammer. It was redesignated the Model 27 in 1957. Law enforcement agencies favored the Model 27, but its high-polish finish and labor-intensive topstrap checkering added expense with no added utility for a police carry gun. The Model 28 is unusual in that Smith & Wesson removed, rather than added, features to the Model 27 to create it, in order to reduce production costs with no reduction in utility.A classic N frame revolver, the Highway Patrolman is blued, but it is not polished, saving labor costs. The top strap and frame rounds are bead blasted to achieve a matte appearance. In the late 1940s and the first part of the 1950s Smith & Wesson was the only American gun company manufacturing a .357 magnum revolver. Since this relatively deluxe model was the only revolver available for this cartridge at the time, police departments, as well as individual officers and private shooters, requested from Smith & Wesson a more strictly utilitarian \\"budget\\" .357 magnum revolver. S&W; responded with the Highway Patrolman (later renamed the Model 28 in 1957). The manufacturing changes made for a more affordable revolver, though mechanically the Highway Patrolman is the same as the more ornate Model 27. The Model 28 was in production from 1954 through 1986. For most of its production run it was a steady seller with both police officers and civilian shooters.

The station is now a privately owned property at the top of Alexandria Road, Sidmouth. The line was part of the Southern Railway, a branch off the Salisbury to Exeter route (West of England Main Line) at Sidmouth Junction. History The station opened on 6 July 1874, built and operated by the Sidmouth Railway Company to satisfy the needs of visitors to the resort. The railway station was located a mile and a half away from the seafront and town centre. Initially there were seven trains per day, but this increased to 24 in the 1930s. Passenger numbers remained viable well into the 1950s, but rail service rationalisation in the 1960s significantly reduced the frequency of train services. The consequent reduction in passenger numbers led inevitably to closure of the branch line; passenger services ceased on 6 March 1967 and freight services continued up to the line closure on 8 May 1967. The railway track was lifted shortly after this. There were two platforms: one could hold five coaches, and the other seven. Occasionally a longer train would arrive, and would need to be split between the platforms. The goods yard was located directly next to the passenger station; goods traffic was always light and consisted mainly of agricultural goods and coal for the nearby gasworks. The station today The building's railway heritage is still clear, as can be seen from the photograph of the front of the building which was the original entrance to the ticket office and waiting rooms. Inside the building there remains part of the platform and the ornate metal roof supports. The site has been completely redeveloped with a builders merchant built on the goods yard and an industrial estate on the passenger lines; a housing development (Bulverton Park, Bulverton) has been built on the trackbed to the north of the station. Since the closure of this station, Sidmouth's nearest rail hub is Honiton railway station, 9 miles away.

It is a work of dark eroticism, centred on the relationship between two twentieth century brothers in a small French village, one of whom is a Catholic parish priest, while the other is a libertine. It explores issues of split subjectivity and existentialist bad faith. Plot summary The novella centres on the antagonisms that exist between two brothers. It recounts the story of Robert, a priest whose conduct appears so exemplary that he is called \\"L'Abb√©\\" (\\"the abbot\\"), and is also involved in the clandestine activities of the French Resistance. Against his perspective of ecclesiastical morality, one encounters his twin brother Charles, who is a \\"libertine.\\" It is the Second World War, which serves as a backdrop for the paradox of interpersonal betrayal, anti- clericalism and its disconnection from public virtue that characterises this work. Charles has a sexual relationship with Eponine, a female libertine. However, Eponine is also attracted to Robert. Worse, Robert is secretly attracted to Eponine, which precipitates an atmosphere of psychological and sexual tension within this triangle. The story turns out badly for all involved, as the resolution of this unstable triangle is not a healthy outcome. The story is told mostly from Charles's point of view. Robert undergoes a nervous breakdown, as he faints at a church service that he officiates at, with Eponine in the congregation. Robert becomes an alcoholic, and starts to harass Eponine at home late at night, leaving behind traces that suggest growing psychological instability. He loses his moral compass, and eventually becomes insane, leaving his village for a hotel on its outskirts, and spends a fortnight with two prostitutes, Rosie and Raymonde, before the Gestapo apprehend Robert for his activities with the French Resistance. While he has abandoned his clerical vows, however, Robert will not betray his resistance colleagues, and dies an heroic death after severe torture at the hands of his Nazi captors. Charles mourns his death, unable to forget what happened to his brother, until he and his wife Germaine encounter the unnamed narrator of the bracketing sections of this work, read as if an autobiography. Two years after Robert's heroic death, Charles commits suicide, but the narrator fulfils his responsibilities and takes the work to a publisher. Structure Part One: Editor's Preface The unnamed narrator sets the scene of two brothers, and tells the story of the last time he saw Charles, his demand of him to publish the memoirs, and the narrator's entry into psychotherapy. Part Two:The Narrative Written by Charles C... Made up of eighteen chapters, this tells the story of the events leading up to Robert's breakdown from Charles' point of view. Part Three: Epilogue to The Narrative Written by Charles C... The aftermath of the breakdown, including his last visit to Charles fortnight with the prostitutes. Part Four: Robert's Notes: Foreword by Charles C..., The Diary of Chianine, Conscience Robert's diary of the affair with the prostitutes, starting with Charles' thoughts on them. Part Five: The Editor's Postscript Recounts a conversation after the war between Charles and the narrator about a conversation Charles had had with a Calvinist monk who had been in the same prison cell as Robert.

Early life Albrecht was the daughter of a successful maritime lawyer, and spent her childhood living in a wealthy suburb of Hamburg. She did not fit in well in public school, and was later sent to a private school in Holzminden. In 1971 she attended the University of Hamburg where she studied sociology, and it was around this time that she became interested in Marxism. She joined several political groups and even a squatters group before moving into an apartment with Karl-Heinz Dellwo. She also began to mingle with some Red Army Faction (RAF) members, such as Ilse Stachowiak, to whom she sometimes gave her ID papers. In 1974, along with Dellwo and a few other people who all later became involved with the RAF, she joined the Committee Against the Torture of Political Prisoners in West Germany, which protested against the conditions that several imprisoned RAF terrorists were living in. In Hamburg, she rented an apartment with six other people which had no shower or bath. She was known to have said about her former home-life; \\"I was sick of pigging out on caviar and smoked salmon.\\" She, along with Sigrid Sternebeck and Silke Maier-Witt (who were collectively known as the Hamburg Aunties), became very important to the left-wing scene and Albrecht began to further strengthen her connection to the RAF.

The attempt failed, however, and Haig was not injured as the bomb exploded too late. *In 1980, Albrecht fled to the German Democratic Republic where she was protected by the StasiSusanne Albrecht and given a new identity. Arrest and imprisonment In East Germany, Albrecht worked as an English translator under the name Ingrid J√§ger, and married a scientist, with whom she had a son. Neither knew of her past.

Discovery and success Born Waymond Anderson, he was discovered at a New Edition concert in California in the mid-1980s when one of the members asked him to come up on stage and sing with them. After his initial nervousness on stage, he decided this was the career route he wanted to take. A few years later, in 1988, Suave released his first single, \\"My Girl,\\" as well as an album, I'm Your Playmate. The single rose to #20 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #22 on the Radio & Records Pop Chart. Later in the year, he released a single called \\"Shake Your Body,\\" which climbed to #22 on Billboard's Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks. Today, Suave's songs are not commonly heard on U.S. radio. Waymond Anderson was sentenced to life in prison in 1993 for arson murder in the torching of a crack house near the USC campus which proved fatal to a drug addict. During his years in the music business he admitted to being a drug dealer as well as an adulterer. He also perjured himself in court by recanting an implication of police officer involvement in the death of Christopher Wallace. Today Suave is still in prison although new information has been presented that he was in Jackson, Mississippi, visiting his sister the day of the alleged murder. Even a minister in Jackson states he saw Anderson at his church the day of the murder. All witnesses who once testified against him have come forward with their own stories why they implicated Anderson as a killer; however both have changed their stories, alleging the police placed them under duress. Anderson is hoping to one day be found innocent of these charges he claims are false. His son, 6 at the time of the crime, recently graduated high school. He also has a wife.

Boraas, 416 U.S. 1 (1974), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court upheld the constitutionality of a residential zoning ordinance that limited the number of unrelated individuals who may inhabit a dwelling. Background A zoning ordinance in the Village of Belle Terre restricted one-family dwellings to single family, which was defined as \\"[o]ne or more persons related by blood, adoption, or marriage, living and cooking together as a single housekeeping unit\\" or two people unrelated by blood or marriage. The appellees leased a house zoned for single- family residential to a group of students at nearby State University at Stony Brook. The Village of Belle Terre then brought an order of eviction, claiming that the students did not constitute a family and so were excluded from that zoned area. Prior history The appellees sought declaratory judgment and an injunction declaring the ordinance unconstitutional. The district court held the ordinance constitutional, and the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed. Arguments/theories The students and homeowner argued that (1) the ordinance interferes with a person's right to travel; (2) it interferes with the right to migrate to and settle within a state; (3) it bars people who are uncongenial to the present residents; (4) it expressed social preferences of the residents for groups that will be congenial to them; (5) social homogeneity is not a legitimate interest of government; (6) the restriction of those whom the neighbors do not like trenches on the newcomers' right to privacy; (7) it is not rightful concern to the villages whether the residents are married or unmarried; (8) the ordinance is antithetical to the egalitarian, open, and integrated ideology of the nation. Decision The Supreme Court held that the Belle Terre ordinance was a constitutional restriction on the use of land. It further held that the police power is a valid basis for establishing residential zones limiting the number of unrelated individuals that may inhabit a dwelling. In particular, the majority opinion cited the Palo Alto Tenants Union v. Morgan, a 1973 federal decision upholding density limits in zoning. The Supreme Court held * Because there was no protected class discrimination, and no fundamental right infringed by the ordinance, the proper standard of review was the rational basis test. * The legislature should define a family, rather than the judiciary. As long as there exists a rational basis for the legislature's determination, it would be upheld by the courts. * The ordinance did not restrict the freedom of association, as homeowners may entertain whomever it wants and that the ordinance was only a restriction on who could permanently live in that residence. * The city had a rational basis for its prohibition on housing large numbers of unrelated individuals because creating a quiet neighborhood is a permissible state goal and this ordinance is closely related enough to this goal to be sustained under the rational basis test. Dissenting opinions ; Justice Marshall dissented, arguing that * The ordinance infringes the fundamental rights of association and privacy and thus the proper standard of review is strict scrutiny. * Zoning officials may restrict the use of land, but may not properly restrict who the persons living on land may be, \\"what they believe, or how they choose to live.\\" *The right to establish a home is an essential part of liberty protected by the due process clause. The choice of companions is essential to this right. *The city's attempt to maintain a residential character cannot justify this particular ordinance, because it allows any number of residents, as long as they are related. Thus, this ordinance was under inclusive. * The ordinance is not narrowly tailored to the ends sought and was thus over inclusive. For example, ‚ÄúIt would...prevent three unrelated people from occupying a dwelling even if...they had...one income and no vehicles.‚Äù416 U.S. 1, 19 Justice Marshall went on to say * \\"It is inconceivable to me that we would allow the exercise of the zoning power [established in a 1926 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, Euclid v. Ambler Realty] to burden First Amendment freedoms, as by ordinances that restrict occupancy to individuals adhering to particular religious, political, or scientific beliefs. Zoning officials properly concern themselves with the uses of land‚Äîwith, for example, the number and kind of dwellings. But zoning authorities cannot validly consider who those persons are, what they believe, or how they choose to live, whether they are Negro or white, Catholic or Jew, Republican or Democrat, married or unmarried.\\" See also Moore v.

It is historically part of the East Riding of Yorkshire. According to the 2011 census the parish had a total population of 2,332. Governance Riccall is a major part of the electoral ward called Riccall with Escrick. The total population of this ward at the 2011 census was 4,312. Geology and geography The settlement of Riccall lies on the Humberhead Levels. At the end of the last ice age about 10,000 years ago Riccall lay underneath the very large Glacial Lake Humber. This gives the area its characteristic light sandy soil. Riccall is the starting point of the ten kilometre Cycle the Solar System route which follows the Selby‚àíYork cycle track finishing in Dringhouses, York. The cycle track used to form the old route of the East Coast Main Line via Selby, and Riccall station served the village until 1964. History St Mary‚Äôs Church Homo sapiens first arrived in Great Britain around 12,000 years ago as the earth was warming before the beginning of the Holocene era. It is not known when Man first arrived in the area, however there is evidence that the Humberhead Levels have been settled for several thousand years, and that the drier northern area where Riccall is situated was settled before the Roman era. Saxons and Danes The village was the site of an Anglo-Saxon settlement and there is evidence of a Saxon church on the site of the current St Mary‚Äôs. The early settlers most likely chose the site because of two geographical factors: the area forms a slightly raised plateau above a flood plain, and it is near the Ouse. Riccall was the site of the base camp of Harald Hardrada in 1066. He landed on the banks of the Ouse after sailing up the Humber Estuary and set up camp at Riccall before his victory in the Battle of Fulford. However this was to be his last taste of victory, as his army was defeated shortly afterwards by the forces of King Harold Godwinson of England with the false parlay and preceding battle at Stamford Bridge, with many of his troops back at the base camp the battle was short and Hardrada himself died. This battle had a knock-on effect as it distracted Harold from the defence of the south coast and left the land open to Norman invasion. The event is commemorated in one of Riccall's streets, now a footpath, named after Olaf who looked after the camp in Harald's absence, and in Danes Hills, so named for its tumuli. There is now a small information panel about the event at the bottom of Landing Lane, approximately where the Danes moored. Normans Riccall Cycle Path distance marker About forty years after the Norman conquest the current St Mary‚Äôs was built using stone quarried from the Magnesian Limestone ridge which lies approximately to the west. The old south door of the church has a carved Romanesque arch and its 12th-century three-stage tower has Norman double window openings.  Riccall Mine Between 1983 and 2004 the village was home to UK Coal's Riccall Mine which was part of the Selby Coalfield. The colliery, located south-east of Riccall, closed in 2004. The site of the colliery was re-developed as a business park. Community The Regen Centre The village has a primary school, post office, NISA store, hairdresser/beauty salon, butcher, two pubs, an Italian restaurant and the Regen Centre, an award-winning conference, events, and community facility. The Regen Centre houses a bar, four outdoor tennis courts, and a small sports hall where football and badminton can be played. The Hare & Hounds Villagers are kept up to date with local news via bimonthly editions of Riccall News.

The economy of the area is still dependent on mining, ranching and agriculture. The area is still rich in minerals including silver with working mines. Since the 1940s new deposits of mercury have been explored. History Rock formations at the Sierra de Organos National Park. The earliest known culture of this region was that of the Chalchihuites, which existed from the late Pre-classic to about 900 AD, and was mostly sedentary and agricultural. It is not known why the settlements of this area were abandoned, but theories center on climate change, attacks from nomadic peoples and the fall of the large cities of the central valleys of Mesoamerica. From then until the arrival of the Spanish, the nomadic Chichimecas dominated the area. In 1555, nine years after discovering silver in what is now the city of Zacatecas, Juan de Tolosa and a small group of Spaniards and allied indigenous arrived to find more. They settled near a small spring, calling the area Real y Minas de Sobrerete. The name came from Frair Jer√≥nimo de Mendoza, who notices that one of the mountains (Cerro de Sombreretillo) that surround the valley looked like the common three-corner hat of the time, when viewed from the side. Soon after, the main became important producers of gold, silver, lead, tin and mercury and by 1570, the settlement had grown enough to be officially declared a town by the Audiencia de Guadalajara with the name of Villa de Llerena. In 1567 the San Mateo monastery was established to be the main evangelical center of the region. During the colonial period the town and region continued to grow economically, with the addition of agriculture and ranching as important economic activities. However, mining still remained primary, with the two largest and most productive mines being Pabell√≥n and Vetanegre, which made the Fagoaga family rich, giving it the title of the Marquesado del Apartado. The importance of the town of Sombrerete grew in the 17th century, with the establishment of a Royal House to collect taxes from as far as Chihuahua and Sinaloa. At the beginning of the 19th century, the town has a population of about 30,000 and a coin mint (casa de moneda) was established to create a coin called ‚ÄúVargas.‚Äù Outside the mines, the various agricultural and ranching haciendas dominated the area until the beginning of the 20th century. The Santo Domingo parish. During the Mexican War of Independence a number of the miners sent financial support to the insurgents, especially to Guadalupe Victoria. In 1824, the town was declared a city by the state of Zacatecas and made a regional capital. The area remained politically important during the 19th century, but suffered an attack by Apaches from the United States in 1845. During the French Intervention and Reform War, it was the provisional capital of Zacatecas, with Benito Ju√°rez passing through in 1866. The first newspaper, La Campana, was published in 1867. A major mining accident occurred in the San Amaro and San Francisico mines in 1897, with 116 dead. When the Mexican Revolution broke out, the area‚Äôs agriculture was known for its production of cotton and grain. The war brought attacks on both haciendas and mines, which deteriorated the economy even though the town was made a provisional capital of Zacatecas from 1913 and 1914, with a visit from Venustiano Carranza. Los Portales. The end of the Revolution brought an end to the hacienda system and efforts by the new government to suppress the Catholic Church brought on the Cristero War, which mostly affected the rural communities of the area. Since then the area remains an important mining and agricultural center for the state and a commercial center for the north of Zacatecas. Notable events since the early 20th century include the establishment of the Colegio de Sagrado Coraz√≥n de Jes√∫s in 1947, a forty-hour snowfall in 1987, the declaration of sister city status with Llerena, Spain in 1992 and the founding of the Instituto Tecnol√≥gico de Zacatecas-Occidente in 2000.

To date, he has produced two albums, The Trempealeau Hotel (1985) and Faith in Gravity (1990), both released by Weary Wolf Records, a division of Folked Up Musics (BMI). His musical style is firmly rooted in the folk tradition of the midwestern United States, and many of his songs describe the trials and tribulations of the lives of people in the working class. Both of his albums are out of print, and he has stated that he has no intention of producing a third. His first album, The Trempealeau Hotel, was heavily river-themed, focusing on the culture of people who worked on the Mississippi River. The title track refers to a hotel in Trempealeau, Wisconsin, a small village on the border of Wisconsin and Minnesota. It was originally released on LP, although a remastered CD was produced in limited quantities. His second album, Faith In Gravity, dropped the river theme and contained a number of songs with a fairly poppy feel, most notably the title track. It includes one live track, Longevity Blues, a humorous song about the vices one needs to give up to ensure a long life. As a point of trivia, the in-leaf contains a track listing in Korean hangul, for which Eddie Allen thanks \\"Marissa's mother\\", presumably the mother of the Marissa of Marissa's Lullaby, the fourth track on the album.

It had a highly unorthodox design and boasted several firsts for a consumer camera, including a built-in electronic flash, built-in motor drive, and drop-in film loading (beating Kodak's popular Instamatic to the market). Other unusual features included push-button exposure and focus controls and an integrated rechargeable battery. The camera used standard 828 rollfilm packaged in a proprietary snap-in cartridge which had to be returned to the company for processing. It was aimed mainly at women, marketed as a \\"goof-proof\\" alternative to traditional cameras. Although innovative, the Fotron was also extremely expensive, unwieldy, and reportedly suffered from poor optical quality. Introduced at a list price of $139.95, by 1971 the camera was selling for $520 (), plus $3.98 per 10-exposure roll for film and processing (). Despite this, Traid claimed the cameras were sold at a loss and only the film processing operation was able to turn a profit. Due to the high price, vendor lock-in of film and processing, and aggressive direct selling techniques used to market the camera, it is often regarded as something of a scam.McKeown, James M (1994). Price Guide to Antique and Classic Cameras, 9th ed. . Traid faced multiple class-action lawsuits brought by Fotron customers and stopped selling the camera in 1971. Design The Fotron was a large and heavy camera, similar in size to a folded Polaroid Land Camera of the same era. Much of the bulk came from the built-in flash unit and rechargeable battery. Exposure was set by pushing one of two buttons, marked \\"indoors\\" and \\"outdoors\\" respectively. This also served to turn on the flash circuitry in preparation for taking a picture. The exposure would then be made by choosing from a second set of buttons, labeled with various camera-to- subject distances. This would set the focus accordingly and then trip the shutter and the flash, which fired with every exposure. The film would then be automatically advanced to the next frame. Models Traid produced three Fotron models, all of which were essentially the same. The original model was simply marked \\"Fotron\\" and had a gray plastic housing. The second model, introduced around 1965, had a black housing and a different style of frame counter. The final model was the Fotron III, which was introduced around 1966. It was also black and had a slightly simplified design with two focus buttons instead of three and a different exterior treatment for the flash unit. Fraud allegations The Fotron was the subject of a class-action suit filed against the Traid Corporation in 1972. The plaintiffs alleged that the Fotron cameras they had purchased were sold for over ten times their actual value and that Traid had misrepresented the product both implicitly and in writing.Metowski v.

Biography  His father was a member of the minor gentry, and was the author of a book titled The Statistical Economic Review of the Southern Part of Tula Guberniya. He began his education at the Gymnasium in Oryol, but didn't complete his studies before enrolling at the Imperial Academy of Arts, where his instructors were Timofey Neff and Alexey Tarasovich Markov. In 1862, he received a gold medal for his painting \\"The Flight of Grigory Otrepyev from the Inn\\" (a scene from Boris Godunov by Pushkin).Biography and paintings @ Bibliotekar Self-portrait (date unknown) Having received a stipend for travelling from the Academy, he visited Paris, Florence, Rome and Spain on study trips. Upon returning to Russia in 1870, he was named an Academician. Shortly thereafter, he became one of the founders of the \\"Association of Travelling Art Exhibitions\\" (Peredvizhniki), remaining a fervent participant and supporter for the rest of his life. In 1876, he went to live on a farm near Kharkiv and began to create sympathetic portrayals of peasant life. From 1861 to 1881, he was married to the pianist Ekaterina Krivtsova, but separated from her when she was pregnant with his son , on the suspicion that Ivan was not his child.RusArtNet: Brief biography He remarried shortly after (to the artist Kseniya Ivanova), but his suspicions lingered and he wouldn't allow Kseniya to treat Ivan as a son. For several years, Ivan was placed in the care of Myasoyedov's friend and colleague, Alexander Kiselyov. In 1883 Myasoyedov was the model for Ivan the Terrible in Ilya Repin's painting Ivan the Terrible and His Son Ivan. In 1889, he acquired a large manor house in Poltava, complete with a park, ponds and gardens, where Ivan rejoined the family. While there, he painted a curtain and designed scenery for the local theater. He also organized an art school in 1894 and wrote a book about gardening. He resigned from the Academy in 1902, in protest over their teaching methods. Although he worked on a variety of subjects, he always had a fondness for religious painting and was planning a triptych of \\"Holy Russia\\" when he died.

It describes the king of Balhae, the vassals of Balhae, geography and geology, government system, foods and clothing, etc. It is an early book that argued that Balhae should be included as part of Korean history. Balhaego is notable for referring to Balhae and Silla as the northern and southern kingdoms, within a unified account of Korean history. The first modern edition was published by the Ch≈çsen Kosho Kank≈çkai in 1910.  Purpose  The author criticizes that they did not systematically describe the history of the invention during the Goryeo Dynasty. The front of the book argues that Balhae's history should be accepted into the Korean history system. He made it clear that Balhae was the heir of Goguryeo, and brought it into the category of Korean folk history, and argued that the period of war with Silla should be regarded as the era of the Republic of South Korea. He also claimed that because Goryeo did not publish the history of the project, he could not claim the territorial rights of Jurchen and Khitan, which occupied Goguryeo and Balhae. In this regard, Balhaego's historical location is very important.  Contents  The Balhaego consists of nine parts, including a preface. The monarch part is a kind of a forecastle, documenting the king. The vassal part is written about Balhae's military, scholars, and diplomats. The clothing part deals with the clothing according to the business world, and the market part with the local products. The Korean part contains titles in Balhae, and the national document part consists of the letters from Balhae to Japan. The dependency part states that Balhae was a subordinate state.

It is an adaptation of William P. Wingate's novel Shotgun, written by Christopher Frank and Rudy Wurlitzer, and directed by Harley Cokeliss (credited under his birth name Harley Cokliss). Plot Richard Malone is a covert CIA operative specializing in assassinations, but has grown disillusioned with his line of work and suddenly resigns, much to the chagrin of his superiors. Malone begins driving aimlessly before his Ford Mustang breaks down in a rural Oregon valley. Malone pushes it to a gas station and garage owned by Paul Barlow, who runs the station with his 17-year-old daughter Jo. Barlow suggests the fastest way to repair the car is to tow it 60 miles to a larger service station. Malone opts to wait for the necessary parts to arrive. Paul invites Malone to stay in the spare room. Malone and Paul become friends as they discuss their respective military service in the Vietnam War. Jo snoops through Malone's possessions, finding a handgun. Malone helps Paul with his repair work and sizes up the town, which is under the thumb of Charles Delaney, who buys up all the property he can and forces people to sell if they first refuse. Outwardly a respectable and affluent businessman, Delaney is in fact a white nationalist leading a group of terrorist cells throughout the country, turning the property he buys into havens for his cause. A group of Delaney's thugs harass Malone and Jo on a bridge and refuse to let them pass. Malone defends himself when he is attacked. He severely beats the ringleader, Dan Bollard, sending him to the hospital. Dan's brother, Calvin, is goaded into killing Malone by Delaney's right-hand man Madrid. Calvin tries to shoot Malone at the local barber shop but Malone shoots and kills Calvin instead. While Sheriff Hawkins is holding Malone at the jail, Delaney breezes in to introduce himself. Delaney tells the sheriff to let him go, then orders Madrid to arrange a hit on Malone. The next day, two hitmen come to the service station. Malone kills both with a shotgun that he had concealed in his room, but is badly wounded in the shootout. Hawkins instructs a deputy to drive Malone to the hospital. The deputy drives offroad, with Malone bouncing in the back seat. Realizing that the deputy is trying to kill him, Malone grabs the wheel and crashes the car. In the hospital, Malone's CIA handler Jamie arrives to ferry him to safety. They hole up together in a safe house and rekindle their romance. When Malone goes to pick up his car from the Barlows, Madrid leads an attack on the safe house. Jamie shoots one of the attackers but is captured by Madrid and his thugs. Madrid tortures Jamie to find out where Malone is located. She refuses to break and Madrid kills Jamie by suffocating her with a plastic bag. Malone returns to find Jamie's body with the bag still around her head. An angry Malone soon infiltrates Delaney's sprawling compound, killing the henchmen including Madrid to avenge Jamie's death. Delaney retreats to his secret command center, where he tells Malone that he is part of a vast conspiracy of like-minded \\"patriots\\" who are buying up land and electing Congressmen to retake the country from \\"mongrels.\\" Malone proceeds to kill Delaney and blow up his compound, then walks away, burning his Commonwealth of Virginia driver's license.

It opened in 2005. History The main Pier Village Shopping area The land that Pier Village now sits on was originally that of the Long Branch Pier and the Kid's World amusement park. On June 8, 1987, at around 3 PM, a fire broke out underneath the boardwalk in an electrical and gas box at the end of the pier. The fire quickly spread throughout the pier despite efforts by the Long Branch Fire Department to save it. After the fire only the water attractions across the street from the pier remained. In the following weeks business had slowed so the remaining portion of Kid's World closed down permanently at the end of the summer. The owner, Pat Cicalese, planned on rebuilding the pier. However, his insurance did not cover the cost to rebuild what was destroyed and the town would not fund the project so the plans were abandoned. What was left of Kid's World remained abandoned for 17 years after the fire. Remains of the pier were demolished in the late 1990s. The rest of Kid's World across the street met the wrecking ball in 2002. Applied Development Company, a Hoboken, NJ-based developer led by brothers David Barry and Michael Barry (the sons of Joseph Barry), was designated the developer of the site by the City of Long Branch and soon began construction of Pier Village, starting with the rebuilding of the boardwalk. Features Pier Village at Long Branch, NJ Pier Village consists of 536 rental residences sitting atop more than of retail space. A public grassy area called Festival Plaza is the site of regular events, including concerts, arts & crafts fairs, outdoor movies and holiday events. The first story of Pier Village is filled with shops, restaurants, lounges, a salon, and a gym, while the upper floors are filled with ocean-view Apartments. There is two-hour metered surface parking and two enclosed parking garages. The tenants are mostly local businesses, most from Monmouth County, but there are national brands, such as Stewart's Root Beer, Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory, Winz Market and Gold's Gym. There are three restaurants situated on the boardwalk facing the ocean: Avenue, Sirena and McLoones. Of these, only McLoone's Pier House is free- standing. McLoone's was the only building built from the ground up by the restaurateur and was open a year in advance of the rest of the commercial properties within the Village. Also located in Pier Village is The Wine Loft a high end Wine Bar. The developers David Barry and Michael Barry, along with partners, opened up a members-only beach club called Le Club. Designed by London-based architect David Collins, who also designed London‚Äôs Nobu Berkeley Street restaurant and the famed Blue Bar, Le Club is a resort featuring a modern tri-level building with a rooftop pool and sun deck offering views of the ocean and a private beach area with palm trees and cabanas. Travel & Leisure Magazine named it one of ‚Äú20 Great American Beaches\\" in its July, 2007 issue , and New York Magazine profiled it in its annual Summer issue . Criticism The primary criticism of Pier Village was that Eminent Domain was abused to secure the land for development. Many argued that the homes seized were not \\"blighted\\" as the developer claimed. Residents were removed from their homes so that new homes could be constructed, which falls outside of the legal bounds of Eminent Domain, which states land can only be seized for public use. The New York Times reported: \\"Either way, the fight has become a public-relations disaster for the city as it tries to reclaim its glory days, when seven United States presidents vacationed here and New York's business barons traveled by stagecoach to fill the gambling halls. The 30 or so holdout homeowners have planted signs saying NOT For Sale in their sandy yards, and they have filled the windows of their pastel bungalows with posters declaring Eminent Domain Abuse, signed petitions, shouted at public meetings and written vitriolic letters to the local newspaper questioning the mayor's and the City Council's motives.\\" In 2010, the state ruled that the downtown area was not blighted, and thus could not be seized by Eminent Domain to be redeveloped.

Within its range, extensive habitat destruction is taking place, but it remains fairly common locally. Taxonomy and systematics The Choco toucan was originally considered as a subspecies of the yellow-throated toucan. Description In northwestern Ecuador showing white upper tail coverts The Choco toucan is a large (although among the smallest Ramphastos toucans), predominantly black bird with a striking yellow and black beak, a yellow bib, white uppertail coverts, red undertail coverts and green ocular skin. It is very similar to the larger chestnut-mandibled toucan, but lacks brown on the beak. In the wild, the two are generally best separated by their voice; croaking in the Choco, yelping in the chestnut- mandibled. Distribution As suggested by its common name, the Choco toucan is restricted to the humid Choc√≥ forests in western Ecuador and western Colombia. Its estimated global range is over 110,000 km¬≤. Reproduction Choco toucans lay 3-4 pure white eggs that are incubated for 16 days. The young fledge in about 45‚Äì50 days. In captivity In aviculture, their requirements of spacious cages and a high-fruit diet, and their sensitivity to hemochromatosis (iron-storage disease), make them difficult to maintain for novice keepers. The Choco toucan is very rare in captivity in the United States. References *BirdLife International (2006) Species factsheet: Ramphastos brevis.

Not having the definite article, Latin does not distinguish between these two meanings. The phrase is part of the longer phrase \\"qui pro vobis et pro multis effundetur in remissionem peccatorum\\" used, with reference to the blood of Christ, in the consecration of the wine in the Roman Rite Mass. In the definitively approved English translation this longer phrase appears as \\"which will be poured out for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins\\".Eucharistic Prayer I or The Roman CanonThe Order of Mass, p. 20 The phrase \\"poured out for you\\" comes from only. \\"Poured out for many\\" is from and . \\"For the forgiveness of sins\\" is from only. , the earliest account of Jesus' words over the cup at his Last Supper, mentions none of these phrases in relation to the consecration of the wine. The variety of these accounts indicates that the writers did not intend to give the exact words that Jesus used, probably in Aramaic. The only words that are considered essential for the consecration of the wine at Mass are \\"This is my blood\\", though the form of the sacrament, which varies according to the liturgical rite (Roman Rite, Byzantine Rite, etc.) contains other words as well.The same holds for other sacraments: for instance, \\"I baptize you ‚Ä¶\\" (Roman Rite), but \\"The servant of God (identified by name) is baptized ‚Ä¶\\" (Byzantine Rite). Biblicist Albert Vanhoye said that Hebrew ◊®◊ë◊ô◊ù (rabbim), translated in Greek as œÄŒøŒªŒª·ø∂ŒΩ (pollon) \\"means 'a great number' without any specification as to whether this refers to a totality\\". Translation as \\"for all\\" Several initial vernacular translations of the Roman Missal employed \\"for all\\" instead of \\"for many\\" to represent the phrase pro multis in the Eucharistic Prayer. Thus, Italian had \\"per tutti\\", Spanish \\"por todos los hombres\\", Portuguese \\"por todos os homens\\", German \\"f√ºr alle\\". However, languages such as Polish translated literally, while Dutch had \\"voor de velen\\" (for the many), and French \\"pour la multitude\\" (for the multitude). The word \\"many\\" (Latin multi, Greek œÄŒøŒªŒªŒøŒØ) is opposed to \\"few\\" (Latin pauci, Greek ·ΩÄŒªŒØŒ≥ŒøŒπ), not to \\"all\\" (Latin omnes, Greek œÄŒ¨ŒΩœÑŒµœÇ). In a large group, all the members are many; in a small group, all are few. People can be many whether they form the totality of a group or only part of a group. An article by Father Max Zerwick, S.J. gives examples of texts in which the totality of a group are referred to as \\"many\\".Pro Vobis et pro Multis Effundetur In 2006, the Holy See gave instructions that in vernacular translations of the revised edition of the Roman Missal published in 2002, pro multis was to be translated literally, as \\"for many\\". In a circular of 17 October of that year, the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments pointed out that \\"for all\\" is not a literal translation of \\"pro multis\\", nor of the words \\"œÄŒµœÅ·Ω∂ œÄŒøŒªŒª·ø∂ŒΩ\\" in or \\"·ΩëœÄ·Ω≤œÅ œÄŒøŒªŒª·ø∂ŒΩ\\" in . \\"For all\\", it said, is not so much a translation as \\"an explanation of the sort that belongs properly to catechesis\\". Accordingly, it directed the episcopal conferences to make an effort, in line with the Instruction Liturgiam authenticam, to translate the words pro multis \\"more faithfully\\".Letter from Cardinal Arinze on the translation of pro multis The official English translation of the 2002 edition of the Roman Missal has been issued, but work continues for several other languages. The new Spanish version has already been approved, with \\"por muchos\\" (for many) replacing the previous \\"por todos los hombres\\" (for all men),Heliodoro Lucatero, \\"Una Tradici√≥n siempre nueva, siempre viva - Los cambios recientes de la Misa\\", p. 30 and as early as Pentecost 2009 the change was effected in Hungary from \\"mindenki√©rt\\" (for all) to \\"sokak√©rt\\" (for many);Kathnews: \\"Ungarische Bischofskonferenz revidiert √úbersetzung der Wandlungsworte\\" but reluctance in some quarters to abandon the use of \\"for all\\" to represent pro multis has caused delay in relation to German and Italian. In view of the resistance of some German-speaking episcopal conferences, Pope Benedict XVI wrote a personal letter on 14 April 2012 to the German conference, which had accepted the change. In it he stressed the importance of using the literal translation. The Italian bishops conference also voted against translating pro multis literally as \\"per molti\\" (for many), and in favour of keeping \\"per tutti\\" (for all).There were 117 votes for \\"per tutti\\", 11 for \\"per molti\\", 4 for \\"per la moltitudine\\", corresponding to the French \\"pour la multitude\\" (\\"Not All Bishops Are of Good Will\\"). In 2012, Biblicist Francesco Pieri proposed using the phrase \\"per una moltitudine\\" (for a multitude) as a way of being faithful to the Latin original.Francesco Pieri, \\"Per una moltitudine. Sulla traduzione delle parole eucaristiche\\" in Il Regno (October 2012), p. 301  1973 English translation  In its initial translation of the Order of Mass, the International Commission on English in the Liturgy rendered the phrase \\"qui pro vobis et pro multis effundetur in remissionem peccatorum\\" as \\"which will be shed for you and for all men, so that sins may be forgiven\\". (The word \\"men\\" was later omitted because of complaints that it could be understood as referring only to males.) This version was approved by the Episcopal Conferences of English- speaking countries in 1973 and confirmed by the Holy See. It has now been replaced by a more accurate translation. The 1973 translation was confessedly a non-literal translation, and objections were raised against it not only for this reason but also on the grounds that it could be taken to mean that all are in fact saved, regardless of their relationship to Christ and his Church. Some even claimed that use of the \\"for all\\" translation made the consecration invalid.Follow-up: Why \\"For All\\" at Consecration? As mentioned in the introduction, Biblicist Albert Vanhoye stated that \\"pollon\\" does not exclude the meaning \\"all\\" and consequently the English word \\"many\\" is not an accurate translation as it excludes \\"all\\". In defence of the 1973 translation, it was said that the literal translation, \\"for many\\", could nowadays be taken to mean \\"not for all\\", contradicting the declaration in that Christ died for all, though not all choose to avail of the redemption won for them by the shedding of Christ's blood.\\"The phrase 'for many' (it is said) in our minds today is understood without reflection to exclude the universality of Christ‚Äôs redemptive work. The Semitic mind of the Bible could see that universality connoted in the phrase 'for many'. In fact that connotation was certainly there, because of the theological context. However eloquent it was for ancient peoples, today that allusion to the Suffering Servant of Isaiah is clear only to experts\\" Fr Max Zerwick, SJ, Pro Vobis et Pro Multis Effundetur. Cf. Peter M. J. Stravinskas, The Catholic answer book, Volume 1, p. 47.  Translation as \\"for the many\\"  The Dutch bishops chose to translate pro multis as \\"voor de velen\\" (for the many).Jezus' Hart in het Johannesevangelie The German Bishops Conference also initially decided to translate pro multis as \\"f√ºr die Vielen\\" (for the many), which was to be explained in catechesis as meaning \\"for all\\"; however, under the influence of a movement that began in Italy and spread to other countries, they then decided in 1968 to adopt instead \\"f√ºr alle\\" (for all). The French conference used \\"pour la multitude\\" (for the multitude), but the Italian Bishops Conference has rejected this expression for use in the Mass in Italian. \\"For many\\", rather than \\"for all\\" or \\"for the many\\", is now the official translation in English. The Holy See is insisting on the same for the German translation, with Pope Benedict XVI pointing out that \\"neither Matthew nor Mark uses the definite article, so it is not 'for the many', but 'for many'\\".Letter to the President of the Episcopal Conference of Germany In fact, the Latin liturgical phrase pro multis is drawn from , which in the original Greek reads œÄŒµœÅ·Ω∂ œÄŒøŒªŒª·ø∂ŒΩ (peri pollon), the form used in the Byzantine Greek liturgy, and from , which in the original Greek reads ·ΩëœÄ·Ω≤œÅ œÄŒøŒªŒª·ø∂ŒΩ (hyper pollon). Unlike Latin, Greek has the definite article, which appears in neither passage. \\"For many\\", not \\"for the many\\", is also how all English translations of the Bible translate these phrases. In the view of Manfred Hauke, use in the liturgy of \\"for the many\\" would be \\"a shabby compromise\\".Hauke, p. 228 Hebrew ◊®◊ë◊ô◊ù (rabbim), translated in Greek as œÄŒøŒªŒª·ø∂ŒΩ (pollon), \\"means 'a great number' without any specification as to whether this refers to a totality\\". This also is without the article: ◊®◊ë◊ô◊ù (rabbim), not ◊î◊®◊ë◊ô◊ù (harabbim). For whom was Christ's blood shed? In the Apostolic Constitution Cum occasione of 31 May 1653 Pope Innocent X declared that it is orthodox Catholic teaching to say that Christ shed his blood for all human beings without exception.Texts of Roman Documents Condemning Jansenism Indeed, the traditional blessing of a Paten found in the Pontificale Romanum includes the phrase, \\"Jesus Christ Thy Son, Who for our salvation, and of everyone, (pro nostra omniumque salute) chose to immolate Himself to Thee, God the Father, on the gallows of the Cross.\\" Pontificale Romanum It is also orthodox Catholic teaching that not all will necessarily avail of the redemption obtained by the shedding of Christ's blood. While Christ's redemptive suffering makes salvation available to all, it does not follow that all men are actually saved. This seems never to have been authoritatively defined, since it has remained uncontroversial. The Roman Catechism, also known as the Catechism of the Council of Trent, stated: \\"If we look to its value, we must confess that the Redeemer shed his blood for the salvation of all; but if we look to the fruit which mankind have received from it, we shall easily find that it pertains not unto all, but to many of the human race.\\"The Catechism of Trent It would be heretical to interpret \\"for many\\" in the words of consecration of the wine as indicating that there were some for whom the shedding of Christ's blood was in itself incapable of redeeming (its value). So the Roman Catechism interpreted \\"for many\\" in the context of the consecration form as referring to the effect actually accepted by individuals (its fruits). It declared: \\"When therefore (our Lord) said: 'For you', he meant either those who were present, or those chosen from among the Jewish people, such as were, with the exception of Judas, the disciples with whom he was speaking. When he added, 'And for many', he wished to be understood to mean the remainder of the elect from among the Jews or Gentiles.\\" In this, the Roman Catechism differed somewhat from the Summa Theologica of Saint Thomas Aquinas. This interpreted \\"for you\\" as a reference either to the elect among the Jews, who witnessed the blood shed in the Old Testament sacrifices, or to the priest and the faithful partaking of Mass; and it took \\"for many\\" to refer either to the elect among the Gentiles, or to those for whom Mass is offered.\\"The blood of Christ's Passion has its efficacy not merely in the elect among the Jews, to whom the blood of the Old Testament was exhibited, but also in the Gentiles; nor only in priests who consecrate this sacrament, and in those others who partake of it; but likewise in those for whom it is offered. And therefore he says expressly, \\"for you,\\" the Jews, \\"and for many,\\" namely the Gentiles; or, \\"for you\\" who eat of it, and \\"for many,\\" for whom it is offered\\" (Summa Theologica, Part III, question 78, article 3, reply to objection 8). The Catechism went on to say with regard to the words used in the Roman Canon: \\"With reason, therefore, were the words 'for all' not used, as in this place the fruits of the Passion are alone spoken of, and to the elect only did His Passion bring the fruit of salvation. And this is the purport of the Apostle when he says: 'Christ was offered once to exhaust the sins of many'; and also of the words of our Lord in John: 'I pray for them; I pray not for the world, but for them whom thou hast given me, because they are thine'.\\" It would also be heretical to interpret \\"for all\\" in the words of consecration of the wine as indicating that, without any exception, everybody must in concrete fact receive the benefit won by the shedding of Christ's blood. So the Holy See has interpreted \\"for all\\" in the 1973 English translation of the consecration form as referring to the value of the shedding of Christ's blood and to his intention. On 25 January 1974, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith declared that there was no doubt whatsoever regarding the validity of Masses celebrated using \\"for all\\" as a translation of \\"pro multis\\", since \\"for all\\" corresponds to a correct interpretation of Christ's intention expressed in the words of the consecration, and since it is a dogma of the Catholic faith that Christ died on the Cross for all (cf. , , , ).

New to the game is the \\"Extreme\\" button, essentially a super version of the series' trademark \\"Turbo\\" button. The cover features Shawn Kemp of the Seattle SuperSonics, and Hakeem Olajuwon of the Houston Rockets. The game was used as the basis for a PlayStation demo game titled \\"NBA 2Ball\\", which was based on the NBA's 2Ball competition for the 1998 NBA All-Star Weekend. The demo featured rosters from the 1997-98 NBA Season, with each team having three players. Acclaim also released a series of follow-ups to Extreme, most of which were more traditional basketball simulations. Roster NBA Jam Extreme features many of the top players from the 1996‚Äì97 NBA season, with some notable omissions. Chief among them were Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley and Shaquille O'Neal. Jordan and O'Neal had contracts with Electronic Arts that resulted in the Jordan game Chaos in the Windy City and O'Neal appearing in Shaq-Fu and the NBA Live games. Barkley had signed a deal with Accolade to appear in its Barkley Shut Up and Jam! games. Development The player animations were built from motion capture footage of Juwan Howard of the Washington Bullets. Digitized images of NBA players were scanned and then mapped onto the characters' heads. As part of a joint promotion with Nestl√©, contest labels were printed on the inside of the wrappers for Nestl√© brand candy bars, with the grand prize being a personalized copy of NBA Jam Extreme including the contest winner in digitized form as a playable character.  Reception  Reviewing the arcade version, a Next Generation reviewer commented, \\"It may be debated whether an expanded roster (including six players per team/160-plus NBA players), updated graphics (123,000 texture- mapped polygons per second in a full 3D environment), or additional features (an extreme button and the 'alley-oop' play) improve the actual gameplay from the previous Jam incarnations. ... But what won't be argued is that the successful combination of humor and solid offensive play is still there.\\" His one major criticism was that the new 3D camera often confuses the player about their positioning. The home versions of NBA Jam Extreme received mixed reviews. In GameSpot, Matt Rubenstein wrote that the graphics compared favorably to those in Midway's NBA Hangtime and also praised the large number of hidden features. However, he criticized the slow pace of the game and loading time. GamePros The Rookie was also pleased with the PlayStation version's graphics, as well as the retention of the features from the original NBA Jam. He criticized the controls and held that the game is not as fun as NBA Hangtime, but considered it good in absolute terms. Despite scoring it high enough for the \\"EGM Silver\\" award, the two sports reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly also expressed misgivings about the game, specifically a lack of intelligent challenge, its running at a lower speed than the sprite-based games in the series, and disorienting camera work. However, they called it \\"a dead-on port\\" of the arcade version. Next Generation, contrarily, said: \\"the PlayStation version doesn't look or play as good as the arcade version, which is surprising since the arcade version ran on the PlayStation-compatible System 11 board.\\" The reviewer said the game has overall poor playability, making NBA Hangtime the better game despite Extreme's superior graphics. Josh Smith heavily criticized the Saturn version's visuals as \\"blurry and unclear, choppy and awkwardly animated\\" and said that they hampered gameplay. While he did offer praise for the game's special features and sound effects, he gave it a rating of \\"Poor\\". Writing about the PC version, Tasos Kaiafas criticized the game for being largely the same as the previous Jam games and pointed out performance problems as well as lackluster visuals compared to other PC basketball games. In a review for the Sega Saturn version, Game Revolution also faulted the game for not making much progress beyond the original NBA Jam, as well the loading time. In contrast, Paul Glancey wrote in Sega Saturn Magazine that \\"existing Jam devotees should find Jam Extreme just as entertaining as its forebears, and with enough in the way of new features to make it worth adding to their collections.\\" However, he criticized that single-player games tend to devolve into a back-and-forth where a score by one team is quickly followed by a score by the other team, as the jerky graphics make it hard to follow the course of the ball and thus difficult to intercept the team in possession of the ball.

Otago and Taupo were developed under Project Protector. Project Protector was a Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN) procurement project that was undertaken during the 2000s. At the start of the decade, the New Zealand government tasked the New Zealand Defence Force to develop an equal combat, peacekeeping, and disaster relief capability, in which the RNZN was to focus on conducting sealift operations and patrols of the Economic Exclusion Zone. A series of reviews found that the RNZN was lacking in these capabilities, and Project Protector was established to acquire three new ship types: a single multi-role sealift ship, two offshore patrol vessels, and four inshore patrol vessels. After a two-year information-gathering and tender process, an Australian company, Tenix Defence, was selected as the primary contractor. The sealift ship, , was built by Dutch company Merwede Shipyard in Rotterdam, and based on a commercial roll-on/roll-off ferry built for the Isle of Man. In mid-2007, the ship became the first Project Protector vessel to enter service, but problems during her early career required a remedial program to be put in place. The two Protector class offshore patrol vessels (OPVs) were built by Tenix at its Melbourne, Australia, shipyard to a design used by the Irish Naval Service, but several design mistakes resulted in the ships being 100 tons heavier than planned, and the OPVs were not commissioned until 2010. Four Protector class inshore patrol vessels (IPVs) were built at Tenix's North Island shipyard, and entered service during 2009. Because of the delay in bringing the ships to active duty (all seven were due into service by the end of 2007), BAE Systems Australia (which had acquired Tenix in 2008) was required to pay a compensatory settlement to the RNZN in early 2010. Background In the June 2000 Defence Policy Framework (DPF), the New Zealand government identified that the New Zealand Defence Force had to be equally capable of both combat and peacekeeping operations.McKinnon, New Zealand's navy follows a new heading From the navy's perspective, prioritisation was given to sealift and transport of New Zealand Army units and equipment, and to maritime surveillance of both New Zealand's Economic Exclusion Zone (EEZ), and the EEZs of allied South Pacific nations. The RNZN was also required to develop a non-military operational capability that would allow it to undertake tasks such as disaster relief, throughout the region. To identify if the RNZN could meet the capabilities identified in the DPF, the government initiated the Maritime Patrol Review (MPR), which was released in February 2001, followed by the more ship-specific Maritime Forces Review (MFR), which commenced in May 2001 and was released in January 2002.McKinnon, Capital Gains These reviews were not Ministry of Defence-only affairs: input was sought from other government ministries and bodies, including the Ministry of Fisheries, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the New Zealand Customs Service, the New Zealand Police, and Maritime New Zealand. These reviews identified that the RNZN did not meet the capability requirements identified in the DPF. The main areas identified as lacking were patrol capabilities, both in the EEZ and inshore, and a sealift capability to transport personnel, equipment, and supplies throughout the region for both military and relief operations. The MFR also found that the navy's two Anzac class frigates were both overcapable and too few in number to effectively patrol New Zealand's waters, and that tying them up on these duties prevented their use on more suitable deployments. Around the same time as the reviews, the RNZN was looking to replace the training frigate , which was due to be retired in 2005.McKinnon & Scott, Industry lines up proposals for Project Protector The decision not to order the additional two frigates suggested under the Anzac acquisition project and the increased operational tempo during the early 2000s was straining the navy's capabilities and needed to be addressed. Requisitions The capability gaps identified by the MFR prompted the instigation of Project Protector. The \\"fleet renewal project\\" consisted of three different procurement projects to meet the identified capability requirements: a class of offshore patrol vessels to undertake EEZ operations and relieve the pressure on the Anzacs, improved inshore patrol capabilities (either through a new ship class or upgrades to the existing Moa class patrol boats), and a multi-role sealift ship. The aim was to bring all three projects under a unified umbrella, administered by a single prime contractor. In July 2002, the New Zealand government sent details of Project Protector to 60 shipbuilders and ship design companies, and invited submissions from interested parties.Scott, New Zealand releases Project Protector RFP Six companies were selected from the 21 responses received by the 13 September 2002 deadline: BAE Systems (partnering with Austal and Appledore Shipbuilders), Blohm + Voss, DSA (a collaboration between Damen Shipyards, Schelde Shipbuilding, and Australian Defence Industries), Singapore Technologies Marine, Tenix Defence, and Vosper Thornycroft Shipbuilding. On 26 May 2003, these six were invited to submit more detailed proposals, and were given until 31 October 2003 to respond. Evaluation was predicted to be completed by early 2004, with a contract awarded by mid-2004. Tenix Defence was identified as the best supplier in April 2004, and the contract between the Ministry of Defence and Tenix was signed on 29 July 2004. The project was predicted in 2003 to cost NZ$500 million. Project Protector was the most complex project ever undertaken by New Zealand, with three ship classes (plus embarked small craft) under construction across three nations. All three ships were to be built to commercial standards, and maintained like commercial vessels. In order to operate the new ships, the RNZN had to recruit and train an additional 245 personnel. All seven ships were planned to enter service across 2007. However, by August 2008, only the sealift ship had entered service, and that had occurred six months behind schedule. The entry into service date for the six patrol boats was pushed back to the end of 2008. Further delays meant that the last Project Protector vessel did not enter service until mid-2010. In early 2010, the RNZN received a NZ$86.4 million settlement from BAE Systems Australia (which had acquired Tenix in 2008) as compensation for the delayed entry-into-service dates of the seven ships, along with defects in the sealift ship design, problems including a 100-ton displacement increase in the offshore patrol vessels, and other issues across the project. Sealift ship Canterbury operating off Samoa during Pacific Partnership 2011 Project Protector called for a multi-role vessel with a tactical sealift capability, which would be used throughout the South Pacific region for disaster and humanitarian relief, peace support, military support, and development assistance support. The vessel would also serve as the RNZN's primary at-sea training ship after the frigate Canterbury was decommissioned. A limited patrol and response capability was also desired. The RNZN had previously tried to establish a sealift capability with the acquisition of in the mid-1990s, but attempts to convert the former roll-on/roll-off freighter were unsuccessful, and the ship was decommissioned in 2001. The ship had to be available for 160 days at sea per year, plus another 130 days berthed but available for deployment. She had to be capable of transporting a New Zealand Army heavy company and its equipment (identified in the initial proposal as 250 personnel, 315 lane metres of vehicles, and 33 TEU of equipment and stores), and be able to transfer the personnel and equipment between the ship and shore. The vessel had to embark and operate one SH-2G Super Seasprite, and be fitted with aviation facilities capable of operating two Cougar-size helicopters or one Chinook-size helicopter. Although the review called for the ship to be armed with a gun, the 2003 request for proposals stipulated a gun; this would help keep the project within the NZ$500 million budget, and provide ammunition commonality with the M242 Bushmaster fitted to the Army's LAV III infantry fighting vehicle. The multi-role vessel was the first ship completed under Project Protector.Scott, Project Protector Based on , a commercial roll- on/roll-off ferry, Canterbury has a displacement of , a top speed of , and a range of . The vessel is capable of transporting 250 troops, up to 40 vehicles in 403 lane metres of space, 33 ISO 20-foot containers (including eight dedicated ammunition containers) and 20 NATO pallets of supplies. Loading is performed wharfside through stern and side access ramps, or via two cranes. Two landing craft medium (LCM) are carried by Canterbury for situations where wharf unloading is unavailable; these can be launched and recovered via the cranes, while \\"marriage blocks\\" and \\"flippers\\" help the LCMs dock with the stern ramp. One Super Seasprite and up to four NHIndustries NH90 helicopters can be hangared aboard. The ship is fitted with a single 25 mm Bushmaster gun in a Typhoon mounting and two 12.7 mm machine guns for self-defence. Canterburys hull is strengthened to Finnish-Swedish ice class 1C, allowing her to operate in the Ross Dependency. The ship was built by the Merwede Shipyard in Rotterdam, with steel cutting starting on 15 April 2005. It was launched in February 2006, and commenced sea trials in July. Handover to Tenix was expected to occur in August; the vessel would then sail to the Tenix shipyard at Williamstown, Victoria, Australia for fitting of military equipment. It was originally planned to have Canterbury commissioned into the RNZN during January 2007, but delays meant that the ship did not enter service until June 2007. Problems were encountered early in the ship's career, relating primarily to the RHIB alcove docks, which were in a position to be easily swamped, with resulting damage to the boats themselves.Rosamond & Scott, Canterbury Tales Seakeeping ability was also an issue. Most of the problems stemmed from the ship's parent design-a short, fat civilian ferry designed to operate in the calm Irish Sea, not on military deployments in deep ocean-and the failure of Tenix and the RNZN to address this during design and construction. A remedial program was initiated in 2008. OPV The offshore patrol vessel Wellington in Wellington Harbour during September 2010 Up until the reviews, offshore patrol of the nation's EEZ had been undertaken by the Anzac class frigates, which were both too few in number and overqualified for the duties; deploying them in this manner meant they were unavailable for higher intensity operations for which they were more suited. A new class of offshore patrol vessels (OPVs) was planned; these had to be capable of providing 420 ship-days per year of EEZ operations, and able to operate a Super Seasprite helicopter. Two offshore patrol vessels, Wellington and Otago, were built by Tenix at Williamstown from hull modules fabricated at Williamstown and superstructure modules assembled at Whangarei, North Island, then shipped to Australia. The displacement, long vessels were based on an Aker Marine design operated by the Irish Naval Service. The ships were fitted with an MSI-Defence Systems gun as main armament, and could embark and operate a helicopter. The patrol vessels' hulls were strengthened to Finnish-Swedish ice class 1C for operations in the Ross Dependency. Work started on 22 February 2005. The OPVs were due to complete in April and October 2007. However, the ships were not launched until November 2006 and October 2007 respectively, and by December 2008 were yet to commission.Grevatt, Safety and weight worries delay Project Protector deliveries The main problems were safety issues with the RHIBs and an extra 100 tons of weight over the design specifications. Wellington did not commission until May 2010; the last Project Protector ship to enter service.Fish, Last of RNZN's Protector fleet enters service IPV The inshore patrol vessel Hawea entering Otago Harbour in August 2009 Several inshore patrol vessels (IPVs) were required for surveillance and patrol work in New Zealand's inshore zone (defined as up to from the shoreline). A minimum of 950 ship-days was required for these duties. It was initially thought that the IPV requirement could be met by modernising four of the Moa class patrol boats. They could not be updated to the standard required by the Maritime Forces Review, so new ships were instead ordered to replace them on a one-for- one basis. The IPVs were based on a search-and-rescue vessel class built by Tenix for the Philippine Coast Guard. The vessels had a 340-ton displacement, and were long.Fish, New Zealand launches fourth Project Protector inshore patrol vessel They were only fitted with 12.7 mm machine guns instead of the 25 mm guns fitted to the other Project Protector ships. Four vessels were built at Tenix shipyard in Whangarei, North Island. The first IPV, , was launched in July 2007, and during sea trials exceeded several design expectations: her maximum speed of was a knot higher than expected, she was capable of double her designed range, and she had better seakeeping ability in heavy conditions than first thought. The last ship, , was launched in August 2008. After the final patrol boat was completed, Tenix ceased operations at the Whangarei facility. Although there were some problems with the vessels, all four entered service during 2009.Grevatt, New Zealand receives $58.7m in Project Protector defects settlement Citations References ;Journal articles      External links * New Zealand Defence Force webpage for Project Protector Category:Royal New Zealand Navy Category:Military acquisition ","title":"Project Protector"},{"id":"8060624","text":"EBR may refer to: * East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana, United States * East Bengal Regiment, Bangladesh * Eastern Bengal Railway of British India * Ebri√© language * Edenbridge railway station, in England * Electronic Book Review, a scholarly journal * Emphasized Bible, a translation of the Bible * Environmental Bill of Rights, in Ontario, Canada * Erik Buell Racing, an American motorcycle company * Extended boot record * Experimental Breeder Reactor I, a decommissioned nuclear research reactor * Electro-biochemical reactor * European Business Register * Evidence-based research * Mk 14 Enhanced Battle Rifle * Panhard EBR, a light armoured car ","title":"EBR"},{"id":"8060625","text":"The Cours Florent is a private French drama school in Paris created in 1967 by Fran√ßois Florent.

Husqvarna Group sponsors the Swedish ice hockey club HV71 and several local community engagement projects around the world.Husqvarna Group Annual Report 2013  History  1689 ‚Äì Firearms The drillingwork at the waterfalls in Husqvarna, southern Sweden, was the first large plant. The state-owned rifle factory had some 1,000 employees at the beginning of the 18th century. The company was spun off from Husqvarna Vapenfabriks Aktiebolag in 1959. Shotguns were produced for 300 years, the last in 1989. 1872 ‚Äì Sewing machines When demand declined, it turned out that the machinery for production of rifles was well-suited for producing sewing machines. The operation was divested in 1997 and Husqvarna-branded sewing machines are now produced by the VSM Group. 1874 ‚Äì Kitchen equipment in cast iron Husqvarna started a foundry to produce details for sewing machines, a large part being the base frames. Soon the assortment was broadened to include such products as kitchen equipment in cast iron and later on stoves and ovens. 1896 ‚Äì Bicycles Bicycle production began in the Huskvarna factory. Several patents were registered. The last bicycle was produced in 1962. 1903 ‚Äì Motorcycles The first motorcycle, which could reach the impressive speed of 4‚Äì5 km/hour, was produced in 1903. Starting in the 1930s, Husqvarna's lightweight engines helped make some successful track racing and motocross bikes. Husqvarna's first titles in Motocross World Championship came in 1959 and 1960. The operation was divested in 1987 and is since 2013 part of the KTM family. 1919 ‚Äì Lawn mowers When Husqvarna acquired Norrahammars Bruk in 1918, the product range expanded to heating boilers and lawn mowers. The first test with a lawn mower powered by an engine was done in 1947. 1959 ‚Äì Chainsaws As demand for bicycles, mopeds and motorcycles declined, forestry became increasingly important. The expertise in engines was utilized in new areas and the first chainsaw was produced in 1959. 1968 ‚Äì Power cutters A saw rebuilt to a power cutter in 1968 was the starting point of what today is the business area Husqvarna Construction. 1978 ‚Äì Electrolux acquired Husqvarna. 1986 ‚Äì The motorcycle division was sold to Cagiva. 1995 ‚Äì Robotic lawn mowers The world's first solar powered robotic lawn mower was launched. Sales of robotic mowers did not flourish until 15 years later. 1999 ‚Äì Husqvarna acquired Yazoo/Kees Husqvarna acquired Nebraska-based lawn mower manufacturer Yazoo/Kees. 2006 ‚Äì On its own feet The company was spun off by Electrolux. 2007 ‚Äì Acquisitions of strong brands The acquisition of Gardena in 2007 made the Husqvarna Group the European leader in consumer watering products. Acquiring Zenoah brought a strong brand and geographical expansion in Japan. 2008 ‚Äì Expanded presence in China The acquisition of Jenn Feng and the construction of a new plant for chainsaws and other handheld products gave expanded presence in Asia. 2009 ‚Äì Demolition robot Husqvarna launched its first remote-controlled demolition robot. 2013 ‚Äì Chainsaw chains The decision was made to invest in a new production facility for chainsaw chains in Huskvarna.

The ecoregion extends along the thin coastal strip from the southeastern corner of Bulgaria in the west, across the northern coast of Turkey, to Georgia in the east, where it wraps around the eastern end of the Black Sea. Sub-regions The ecoregion is divided into two sub-regions, chiefly based on the amount of precipitation. The understory of evergreen mesomorphic broadleaf shrubs is characteristic for both sub-regions. Notable species in the understory include various rhododendrons such as Pontic rhododendron (Rhododendron ponticum); Black Sea holly (Ilex colchica), cherry laurel (Laurocerasus officinalis), Caucasus (Buxus colchica) and common box (Buxus sempervirens), Caucasian whortleberry (Vaccinium arctostaphylos), etc. From a European perspective, the majority of these count as relict species from the Tertiary period. An understory of evergreen shrubs like the Pontic rhododendron is characteristic for the Euxine-Colchic deciduous forests ecoregion Colchian forests The Colchic or Colchian forests are found around the southeast corner of the Black Sea in Turkey and Georgia in and around the Machakhela National Park. The Colchian forests are mixed, with deciduous black alder (Alnus glutinosa), hornbeam (Carpinus betulus and C. orientalis), Oriental beech (Fagus orientalis), and sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa), together with evergreen Nordmann fir (Abies nordmanniana, the tallest tree in Europe at 78m), Caucasian spruce (Picea orientalis) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris). The Colchic region has high rainfall, averaging 1,500-2,500 mm annually, with a maximum in excess of 4,000 mm, and is home to some of Europe's temperate rain forests. Euxinic forests The drier Euxine or Euxinic forests lie west of the Melet River, which meets the Black Sea in the city of Ordu, and extend across the Bosporus along the Black Sea coast of European Turkey to Bulgaria. The Euxine forests receive an average of 1,000 to 1,500 mm precipitation annually. The Bulgarian part of the ecoregion lies within Strandzha Nature Park, where it borders on and transitions into the Balkan mixed forests ecoregion. Rare habitat types include coastal sand dunes and peatlands. Pine processionary moth is one of the threats. Fauna Large mammals native to the ecoregion include brown bear (Ursus arctos), Caucasian red deer (Cervus elaphus), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), lynx (Lynx lynx), golden jackal (Canis aureus). The ecoregion is habitat for many migrating, wintering, and breeding birds. It is on a bird migratory pathway known the East Black Sea Migration Route, which connects Scandinavia and Western Russia to the Mediterranean Sea and Africa. Water birds found in the ecoregion include the eastern imperial eagle (Aquila heliaca), Dalmatian pelican (Pelecanus crispus), great white pelican (Pelecanus onocrotalus), pygmy cormorant (Microcarbo pygmaeus), white-headed duck (Oxyura leucocephala), ferruginous duck (Aythya nyroca), red-crested pochard (Netta rufina), black stork (Ciconia nigra), white stork (C. ciconia), common crane (Grus grus), demoiselle crane (grus virgo), greater flamingo (Phoenicopterus roseus), and Bewick's swan (Cygnus bewickii). Protected areas A 2017 assessment found that 784 km¬≤, or 1%, of the ecoregion is in protected areas. Protected areas include Machakhela National Park, Mtirala National Park, and the Kintrishi Protected Landscape.

The peak is just south of the Thornton Gap Entrance of the park, and north of the taller Pinnacle. Mary's Rock is the eighth highest peak in Shenandoah National Park. Hiking Mary's Rock Two trails lead to the summit of Mary's Rock. One which starts from the Panorama Visitor Center and the other which starts from the Meadow Spring Parking Area. The trail from Panorama is somewhat longer and steeper, and is generally considered more difficult. It follows the white-blazed Appalachian Trail. The other trail is shorter and somewhat less difficult. The summit of the rock offers views of the northern section of Shenandoah National Park and Page Valley. Legends of Mary's Rock Mary's Rock Tunnel Mary's Rock has its fair share of legends of how the rock was named. One story claims that Francis Thornton wed Mary Savage and brought her up the mountain to show her the lands they would own together. In 2017 the song Mary's Rock, written by Will Hopkins, was recorded by Terry Baucom's Dukes of Drive. The popular bluegrass group had chart success with a version of this story, suggesting Francis Thornton pushed Mary, or Mary slipped and fell off the rock to her untimely death, allowing Thornton to inherit the land. Another legend claims that Thornton had a daughter named Mary, who climbed up the mountain when she was young and came back with a bear cub under her arm. Yet another states that it was named after the wife of William Randolph Barbee. Marys Rock Tunnel Marys Rock Tunnel is a long tunnel blasted through the mountain that Skyline Drive passes through. Constructed in 1932, it is considered one of the engineering feats of Skyline Drive.

Sensodyne is owned by GlaxoSmithKline and is marketed under the name Shumitect in Japan. Effectiveness Sensodyne toothpastes work in different ways depending on the product's active ingredient - potassium nitrate, strontium acetate/chloride. Potassium nitrate: The potassium ion hyperpolarizes the nerve and stops it from firing. The nerve impulses are thus desensitized and there is no pain. Strontium acetate and strontium chloride: These compounds share a similar chemical structure to calcium. Strontium based toothpastes (acetate and chloride) are therefore able to replace some of the lost calcium and block the exposed tubules in the dentinal tissue. This helps prevent the movement of the fluid within the tubules in response to a sensitivity stimulus that could otherwise cause tooth pain. Some Sensodyne products contain calcium sodium phosphosilicate CSPS (Novamin), which appears to help with tooth sensitivity. A randomized clinical trial published in 2015 demonstrated that dentifrices containing 5% CSPS may have the potential to mineralize and occlude the dentine in the oral environment. Sensodyne has removed the calcium sodium phosphosilicate from their US products. History Sensodyne is a brand of toothpaste that was first sold by Block Drug, a Brooklyn, New York-based company established in 1907 by pharmacist Alexander Block. By 1925, manufacturing dental care products had become the company's focus. Leonard N. Block followed his father into the family business which relocated to Jersey City, New Jersey, in 1938. In 2000, Block Drug was purchased by Smith Kline Beecham P.L.C., which became GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK). The toothpaste was first marketed in 1961 as a desensitising toothpaste based on a strontium chloride formulation. In 1980, Sensodyne launched a new toothpaste containing potassium nitrate, a mild local sedative.  Product Counterfeits & Recall  In 2007, GlaxoSmithKline tracked down counterfeit producers of Sensodyne after a consumer in Panama noted diethylene glycol, a poisonous ingredient commonly found in antifreeze, on the label of his toothpaste.Colgate and Sensodyne, got caught up in the sweep when counterfeiters were found to be selling toothpaste with antifreeze under their names. On July 15, 2015, GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare announced a recall of certain lots of Sensodyne Repair & Protect toothpaste as well as Sensodyne Complete toothpaste due to the possible presence of wood fragments in the products. The recall also applied to the company's Biotene brand of toothpaste. The recall was a precautionary measure based on a small number of complaints, and no injuries have been reported. The recall applies to products manufactured between 2013 and September 2014, and shipped from June 2013 to April 2015.

She was named for Altair, the brightest star in the constellation Aquila. Service history United States Shipping Board, 1919-1921 The Altair was laid down as the steel-hulled, single-screw freighter ID-4156 Edisto under a United States Shipping Board (USSB) contract on 18 December 1918 at Seattle, Washington, by the Skinner and Eddy Corporation. Launched on 10 May 1919, the Edisto came under naval scrutiny in the 13th Naval District, being given the identification number (Id. No.) 4156 and initially earmarked for potential service as a collier. After a brief period of operation by the USSB, the Edisto was transferred to the Navy by executive order on 29 October 1921 and renamed the Altair on 2 November 1921. Classified as a destroyer tender, AD-11, the ship was delivered to the Navy on 5 December 1921 and commissioned at the New York Navy Yard the following day, 6 December 1921, Commander James H. Comfort in command. Destroyer tender, 1921-1939 Converted to a destroyer tender at the New York Navy Yard, and equipped with surplus and salvaged machine tools and shop equipment selected from dismantled Navy and Army war plants in the demobilization after World War I, the Altair underwent her metamorphosis in nine months and then fitted out at her conversion yard into late November, 1922. She then proceeded to the west coast of the United States via Newport, Rhode Island; Hampton Roads and the Panama Canal Zone, reaching San Diego, California, on 17 December 1922. She was assigned to Destroyer Squadron 12, Destroyer Squadrons, Battle Fleet ‚Äî a unit of 19 destroyers (one \\"leader\\" and three six-ship divisions) operating at that time with 84% complements as part of the \\"rotating reserve.\\" From 1922 to 1939, the Altair followed her charges and provided support services wherever required (jobs work that varied from simple repairs to reblading turbines). During this time, to have her own capabilities maintained, she underwent yearly upkeep at the Mare Island Navy Yard. As an example of her following the fleet to ply her vital trade, in 1925, the Altair supported her assigned destroyers in Hawaiian waters during joint Army-Navy maneuvers designed to test the defenses of that Pacific base, and that summer and autumn, when the United States Fleet carried out its Australian cruise, the Altair visited Tutuila, Samoa; Port Phillip, Australia and Lyttelton, New Zealand, during the course of her voyage. In 1926, the events in Nicaragua prompted the dispatch of a sailors and Marines from ships of the Special Service Squadron, and later from other ships in the fleet. However, \\"as the danger points moved inland\\", the Secretary of the Navy's report for 1928 states, \\"it became advisable to use marines for this duty.\\" Accordingly, a Marine expeditionary force, some 3,000-men strong, was dispatched to Nicaragua early in 1927. The Altair participated in this troop lift, when she and the destroyer tender transported Marine Observation Squadron 1 and a rifle company from San Diego to Corinto, a port on the west coast of Nicaragua, reaching their destination 16 February 1927. The destroyer tender then resumed her operations providing services to the destroyers of Squadron 12, accompanying them to Narragansett Bay for tactical exercises before ultimately returning once more to San Diego. World War II 1939-1941 When World War II began in Europe in the autumn of 1939, the Altair was tending Destroyer Squadrons 4 and 6, of Destroyer Flotilla 2, Battle Force, still based on San Diego. In March 1940, however, to service the destroyers of the Hawaiian Detachment sent to Pearl Harbor in December of the previous year, the Altair was shifted to Pearl. En route to her new duty station, she served as plane guard for Navy Consolidated PBY Catalina flying boats being ferried to Oahu, arriving at Pearl Harbor on 16 April 1940. She tended destroyers there through the end of the year 1940 and into 1941 as the fleet based permanently on Pearl Harbor following the conclusion of Fleet Problem XXI. 1941-1943 Overhauled at Mare Island Navy Yard from 6 April to 6 June 1941, the Altair returned to Pearl Harbor on 26 June. For the next three months the destroyer tender discharged her duty there until she departed Hawaiian waters on 30 September for the west coast. Pausing briefly at San Diego from 12-18 October, the ship pushed south, transited the Panama Canal on 2-3 November 1941, and arrived at her new duty station, Hamilton, Bermuda, on 11 November 1941, to provide support for destroyers operating on patrols in the North Atlantic. After the Japanese attack upon the Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor brought the United States into World War II, the Altair maintained a routine of carrying out upkeep and repairs on Atlantic Fleet destroyers at Bermuda that continued into the summer of 1942. Underway for San Juan, Puerto Rico, on 3 July 1942, escorted by the destroyers and , the Altair arrived at her destination on the 6th, detaching the two destroyers and picking up another, the , which escorted the tender to Trinidad, where she arrived on 11 July. Except for brief periods at Aruba and Cura√ßao, in the Dutch West Indies, in early September, the Altair tended destroyers at Trinidad through mid-July 1943. The USS Altair (AD-11) in what appears to be Measure 12 (modified) camouflage, moored at Port of Spain, Trinidad, on 1 October 1942 tending the , the , and the , along with the Dutch minelayer/patrol vessel HNLMS Jan van Brakel (M-80). 1943-1946 Following an availability at the Norfolk Navy Yard, the Altair reported to Commander, Operational Training Command, Atlantic Fleet, on 21 August 1943 and soon resumed active tender operations at Bermuda, this time in support of the destroyer and destroyer escort shakedown group (Task Group 23.1) until shifted to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where she arrived on 11 March 1945. Providing tender services at Guantanamo Bay until 3 May 1945, the Altair then returned to the Norfolk Navy Yard to be prepared for service in the Pacific theater. While the ship was on her way, Nazi Germany surrendered unconditionally and the European war ended. Prepared for \\"distant service\\", the Altair emerged from the Norfolk Navy Yard on 26 July and set course for the Pacific. Arriving in the Panama Canal Zone on 4 August, the ship remained there for the eleven days while World War II in the Pacific hastened to a conclusion with the explosion of two atomic bombs over Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The Altair sailed for Pearl Harbor on 15 August 1945. The Altair reached Pearl Harbor on 6 September 1945 and provided tender services to small ships and craft into the early spring of 1946. She departed Hawaiian waters for the last time on 27 April 1946 and reached San Francisco, California on 8 May, slated for disposal within the 12th Naval District. Decommissioning and disposal Decommissioned at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard (formerly the Mare Island Navy Yard) on 21 June 1946, the Altair was transferred to the Maritime Commission on 8 July 1946 and her name struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 21 July 1946. Laid up in the National Defense Reserve Fleet's Suisun Bay, California, berthing area, the ship remained there until sold on 9 March 1948 to the Basalt Rock Company, which subsequently removed her from government custody and scrapped her.

The actual location of the attraction is just off Warner Road. Often thought to be a railway tunnel, it was actually constructed only as a drainage tunnel so that water can be removed from the farmlands. This water would go underneath the Grand Trunk Railway and down to the valley below. Farmers used this tunnel to transport goods and animals safely underneath the busy railroad above. The tunnel, constructed in the early 1800s, is in height and long. A local legend recounts that the tunnel is haunted by the ghost of a young girl, who after escaping a nearby burning farm building with her clothing ablaze, died within its walls. John Robert Colombo, Mysterious Canada (Doubleday Canada Limited,1988, ), pp. 183‚Äì184. Several variants of the legend exist locally, one version has the girl set on fire by her enraged father after he loses custody of his children after a nasty divorce. Another tells of a young girl being raped inside the tunnel and her body burned to prevent any evidence from being found. All versions of these legends ends with the girl screams filling up the tunnel as she was burning to death.

The project has employed the techniques of archaeological surface survey, along with natural environmental investigations (geological, geomorphological, geophysical, and paleobotanical). In the summers of 1991-95, approximately 40 square kilometers in western Messenia were examined intensively. These included areas to the north, east, south, and west of the modern town of Hora, and the entirety of the Englianos Ridge (Upper and Lower) - the location of the Palace of Nestor. Fieldwork doubled the number of sites previously known in the area intensively surveyed. In addition, nearly all previously known sites in an additional 30 square kilometers have been reinvestigated; the spatial extent and chronological components of these have been defined with greater precision. Members of PRAP are committed to making the results of the project quickly available to the general public and scholars through the Internet. The table of contents contains links to existing publications and reports, some of which are available on-line. In addition we are making available a complete site gazetteer, with descriptions of all sites investigated by PRAP and preliminary catalogues of artifacts found at them. We encourage use of this gazetteer for scholarly purposes. The complete pottery catalog, small finds database, and photography database are also searchable on-line.

It is notable as an early (but far from being the first) popular example of trance music. Released as a single in 1990 on the Belgian label Diki Records, it was produced by Bruno Sanchioni and Giuseppe Cherchia from Italy, with vocals by Karen Mulder. In 1992, the React label released Jam and Spoon's \\"Watch Out for Stella\\" remix, which gained more popularity than the original track and opened up opportunities for remixes by artists such as Paul Van Dyk, and Garry Creen in 1997. 'Watch Out for Stella' was a reference to Jam and Spoon's own track \\"Stella\\" which was released around the same time on their 'Tales from a Danceographic Ocean EP' on the legendary Belgian label R&S; Records. Stella is the name of Jam aka Jam El Mar's daughter. In 1997, \\"The Age of Love (The Remixes)\\" release reached No. 1 on the UK Dance Singles Chart.https://www.officialcharts.com/charts/dance-singles-chart/19970629/104/ To this day, the track continues to be remixed and featured on compilations. As of February 2007, the online resource Discogs has cataloged a total of 73 known releases, and 346 appearances on compilations. The track was featured in the hit film based on the UK club scene, Human Traffic. Sanchioni and Cherchia never released another single under the moniker \\"Age of Love\\"; Sanchioni would continue to produce as part of the trance music act B.B.E.

It was directed by Anne Bohlen, Kevin Rafferty and James Ridgeway. It features many interviews with various white supremacist leaders, and archival footage of others. Production details Blood in the Face was inspired by a nonfiction book of the same name by author James Ridgeway, who is also credited as one of the film's directors. This documentary was largely shot in Cohoctah Township, Michigan. It focuses on a gathering of neo-Nazis, racists, and conspiracy theorists who expect people of color to ignite a Racial Holy War in the U.S. Filmmakers Anne Bohlen and Kevin Rafferty take an intentionally leisurely, conversational tack with supremacists who have assembled for lectures and workshops on everything from getting their message out via home videos to moving all like-minded \\"white Christians\\" to the Northwest, especially the Idaho Panhandle. According to the audio commentary on the Roger & Me DVD, Academy Award-winning American filmmaker Michael Moore appears as an off-screen interviewer because he was originally contacted to arrange a meeting between the filmmakers and the supremacists since he had previously interviewed them for a magazine. At the last minute, the filmmakers backed out of the interview and Moore stepped in to conduct it. Moore is thanked in the end credits. Michael Moore does appear on camera during one interview, and can be heard during another interview.

The film is an adaptation of Su Tong's novel Women's Life (Â¶áÂ•≥ÁîüÊ¥ª) and depicts the emotionally troubled lives of 4 generations of Shanghainese women from the 1930s to the 1980s. Jasmine Women stars Zhang Ziyi and Joan Chen, who both portrayed multiple characters, as well as Jiang Wen, Lu Yi, and Liu Ye. The film was well received by critics and was praised for its use of color and the performances of Zhang Ziyi and Joan Chen. The Chinese name of the movie, Mo li hua kai, is based on a popular Chinese song Mo Li Hua, which means \\"jasmine flower blossom.\\" The names of the characters in the movie are also based on this song. Plot The film is divided into three chapters: \\"grandmother, mother, and daughter\\"; respectively the story of Mo, Li and Hua. Mo's Story (1930s)  Eighteen-year-old Mo (Zhang Ziyi) lives with her mother (Joan Chen) who owns a small photo shop in Shanghai. She longs to become a movie star, a dream her mother does not understand. One day, Mo meets Mr. Meng (Jiang Wen), the boss of a movie studio. She leaves her mother to fulfill her film career dream. She enters a relationship with him who is married and later becomes pregnant. She refuses to have an abortion and when the Second Sino-Japanese War begins, Meng leaves Shanghai and abandons Mo. The movie studio is shut down and Mo returns home. She gives birth to Li and blames her child for everything she has lost. Her mother's boyfriend (never explicitly stated, only implied) also tries to seduce her, using the guise of a free hair appointment. Her mother finds out, and commits suicide not long after. Li's Story (1950s) Li (also played by Zhang Ziyi) had grown up with her mother Mo (now played by Joan Chen) in misery. Mo still remembers her dream of being a movie star. Li marries Zou Jie (Lu Yi) who was a member of her high school's chapter of the Communist Youth League of China. After marriage, they move into Jie's home but unused to their lifestyle and unable to bear a child of her own, they move back to stay with Mo. Li eventually adopts a baby girl named Hua. Li later becomes mentally unstable. Li's situation gets steadily worse and she even accuses Zou for violating Hua, her adopted daughter. Li‚Äôs family collapses and her husband Zou commits suicide by throwing himself at an oncoming train. Li leaves home; her fate is unknown, and Hua is left to live with Mo. Hua's Story (1980s) Li disappeared when Hua (Zhang Ziyi) was still very young and she grew up with her grandmother Mo (Joan Chen). Mo finds comfort in taking care of her granddaughter. When Hua grew up she married a college graduate, Du (Liu Ye). After marriage, Du went for further studies overseas in Japan and after that, decided to leave Hua. Unfortunately, Hua was already carrying Du‚Äôs child. Mo strongly encouraged her to abort the baby because of her experiences with having a child and being unprepared for it, but Hua decided against it. Hua decided to check into a family planning clinic/hospital to have an abortion in any case, but before she could arrive home, Mo died. Years later, Du returns to Hua to 'finalise things', but it seems Hua had moved on with her life. Closing scenes show her moving into a new home with her daughter. Reception Reviewing the film at the Tokyo International Film Festival, Russell Edwards of Variety described Jasmine Women as a \\"tearjerker of the first order\\" and a \\"visual feast\\" and writes the film is \\"an impressive showcase\\" for actress Zhang Ziyi and Joan Chen \\"in multiple roles as daughters and mothers across three generations.\\" The review further states the film is \\"a picture postcard, with the scenes set in pre-WWII Shanghai particularly impressive for their art direction.\\" Awards *7th Shanghai International Film Festival, 2004 **Grand Jury Prize **Golden Goblet (nominated) *13th Golden Rooster Awards of China, 2004 **Best Actress - Zhang Ziyi **Best Music - Su Cong, Yin Qing (nominated) **Best Sound - Wu Ling (nominated)  References  External links  * Jasmine Women at Monkeypeaches.com * Jasmine Women at HelloZiyi.us * Article on Jasmine Women * Jasmine Women review, originally published by Think.com.my Category:2004 films Category:2004 drama films Category:Chinese films Category:Chinese drama films Category:Films about families Category:Films based on Chinese novels Category:Films directed by Hou Yong Category:Films set in the 1930s Category:Films set in the 1950s Category:Films set in the 1970s Category:Films set in the 1980s Category:Films set in Shanghai Category:Mandarin-language films Category:Films shot in Shanghai ","title":"Jasmine Women"},{"id":"8060942","text":"Jan Bach (born December 11, 1937 in Forrest, Illinois) is an American composer. He taught at the University of Tampa (Florida) from 1965 to 1966 and at Northern Illinois University in DeKalb, Illinois (music theory and composition) from 1966 to 2002. His primary performing instrument is the horn, and he is especially renowned among hornists for his horn pieces. He also plays the piano. Education Jan Bach earned a Bachelor of Music degree in 1959 from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and a Doctor of Musical Arts degree in composition there in 1971. He also studied with Aaron Copland and Roberto Gerhard at Tanglewood in 1961 and with Thea Musgrave in Aldeburgh and London in 1974. Awards In 1957 he won the BMI Student Composers first prize. He later won the Koussevitsky competition at Tanglewood, the Harvey Gaul Composition Contest, the Mannes College opera competition, the Sigma Alpha Iota choral composition award, first prize at the First International Brass Congress in Montreux, Switzerland, grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Illinois Arts Council, the Brown University choral composition award, first prize in the Nebraska Sinfonia chamber orchestra competition, and first prize in the New York City Opera competition. He has been nominated six times for the Pulitzer Prize in music. In 1982, he was awarded a Presidential Research Professorship grant. He was Northern Illinois University's nominee for the National CASE Professor of the Year award six times. Compositional style According to James P. Cassaro writing in the New Grove Dictionary of Music, \\"a predominant aspect of [Bach's] work is his charming and inexhaustible sense of humour.\\" Cassaro goes on to remark that \\"in all genres, Bach's works display both structural clarity and a subtle use of instrumental timbre.\\" Rick Anderson in the Quarterly Journal of the Music Library Association (June 2007), p. 925-926, calls Bach \\"one of America's somewhat hidden treasures\\" noting the \\"two sides, equally important, of Bach's musical personality...his seriousness...and his humor\\". Barry Kilpatrick in the American Record Guide (January‚ÄìFebruary 2007), p. 55-56 remarks that \\"[Bach] writes difficult music, to be sure. I think it's a prime motivation, judging by his own comments about how both the Horn Concerto and the French Suite might be the most difficult works ever written for horn. Perhaps this motivation comes from the fact that he is a horn player. Whatever the reason, the result is that only the highest level of player can seem in command of the pieces. Everyone else can only try hard.\\" Compositions His second opera, The Student from Salamanca, was produced by Beverly Sills for the New York City Opera Company in 1980. His first opera, The System, premiered in New York at the Mannes College of Music on March 5, 1974.

The name was first used as a trim level in the mid-1950s, denoting the high-line coupe of the Chrysler Windsor series. More recently, two different concepts by the manufacturer bear the Nassau nameplate. 2000 Nassau The first Chrysler Nassau concept was a styling exercise penned in 2000 by Chrysler designer Robert Hubbach. The resulting vehicle became a working model used by engineers and stylists to eventually create the 300 sedan, introduced in 2005. As with many recent models from Chrysler, very few exterior details were lost in the translation from concept car to production vehicle. One notable exterior difference between the Nassau and 300 are taillamps that wrap over the rear fenders, similar to the treatment on Cadillac CTS sport sedan. The 2000 Nassau styling mule is currently housed in the Walter P. Chrysler Museum. 2007 Nassau In late 2006, DaimlerChrysler announced that it would show another concept car carrying the Nassau name, this time at the 2007 North American International Auto Show. Described by Chrysler as a 'four-door coupe' (however, it is a shooting-brake), it was speculated to be a design exploration for the next-generation Chrysler 300 and Dodge Magnum. The concept was equipped with a 425 hp (315 kW) 6.1 L V8. It was designed in Chrysler's Pacifica Advanced Design Studio in southern California by Alan Barrington (exterior) and Ben Chang (interior).

Gholson (1798-1848). Their uncle Thomas Gholson, Jr. (1780-1816) had served in the Virginia General Assembly and as U.S. Congressman, before dying in Brunswick County, Virginia of the lingering effects of a wound received during the defense of Washington D.C. during the War of 1812. He graduated from the University of Virginia in 1827.Virginia Biographical Encyclopedia, available online On May 14, 1829 Thomas Gholson married his cousin, the congressman's daughter Cary Ann Gholson (1808-1896), and they would have two daughters and a son. Rev. John Yates Gholson (1830-1886) would marry in New Orleans and later move to Alabama, and Georgiana F. Gholson Walker (1833-1904) would marry and move to New York City.ancestry.com does not include the marriage record, nor baptismal or death records for the children, but all are listed on findagrave and a family genealogy and supported by the 1850 U.S. census available online; no record exists of what happened to their daughter Cary (b. 1848) beyond her mention as 17 years old in the 1860 census. Career After reading law and being admitted to the Virginia bar, around 1836, Thomas Gholson also invested in the Brunswick Land Company, as did his elder and politically active brother and several other prominent local men (including Rev. Richard Kidder Meade). Each bought $1000 shares of the company, which bought, traded and speculated in lands in Texas.Gay Neale, Brunswick County, Virginia: 1720-1975 (revised to 2000) (Lawrenceville, Brunswick County Bicentennial Committee 1999) p. 141 In 1847, the Virginia House of Delegates received a complaint against his brother Judge James H. Gholson, alleging favoritism towards Thomas Gholson, among others. When the complainant, R. H. Collier, who had also publicly assaulted one of the Gholsons, refused to testify under oath before the appointed committee, the legislative investigation was dropped, but his brother died the following year. Thomas Gholson was a legal and possibly legislative mentor to Hugh White Sheffey who served in the legislature and also became Speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates during the American Civil War, and later a judge. Around 1850, after his brother's death, Thomas moved his family to Blandford, which is closer to (and now part of) Petersburg. Although owning only $7500 in property in 1850 (shortly after his brother's death), by 1860 Thomas Saunders Gholson owned $100,000 in real estate and $120,000 in personal property.1860 U.S. Federal Census Slave schedule Dinwiddie, Petersburg West Ward. The federal slave schedule shows him as owning 15 enslaved persons, including 5 children, which seems low for the property valuation, but may include only slaves in Petersburg. The corresponding Virginia schedules for 1850 and 1860 are not available online. The 1840 U.S. Federal Census for Brunswick not stated shows T.S. Gholson owning 13 enslaved persons. He only owned $7500 in real estate according to the 1850 U.S. Federal Census for Petersburg (independent city), and may have been supporting his brother's widow Charlotte and daughter Mary as well; that federal slave schedule is missing or misindexed. Petersburg became a railroad hub in this era; Judge Gholson was president of several railroads, and also worked to support a public library in Petersburg.The source, Biographies of Notable Americans (1904), vol. IV, p. 272, available online at ancestry.com, does not indicate whether that railroad involvemewnt occurred before or after the war, or both. Virginia's legislators confirmed Thomas Gholson as a state court judge, and he served from 1859 to 1863, when he resigned to serve in the House of Representatives of the Second Confederate Congress. He represented Prince George County, Virginia(which adjoins Petersburg) as well as Nottaway, Amelia, Powhatan and Cumberland Counties from 1864 until the war's end in 1865. On February 1, 1865, Gholson delivered a speech concerning the possibility of using Negro troops, which was published.Virginia at War, 1865 p. 123 n7 available at googlebooks, but need better cite--pamphlet not in Library of Virginia catalog tho should be archived, may be at VHS. Neale history of Brunswick County, at pp. 134-135 and 207 variously indicates this Thomas or his brother delivered one of the main spokesmen against allowing black troops to fight on the Southern side. The book inaccurately lists both Gholson brothers as moving to Petersburg in 1850. It also indicates a lawyer kinsman, William Yates Gholson, moved to Mississippi, freed his slaves and moved to Ohio because it was a free state, but not that W.Y. Gholson became a Republican, law partner of Salmon P. Chase and won election to the Ohio Supreme Court in 1858. Thomas Gholson received a pardon from President Andrew Johnson on September 6, 1865.U.S. Pardons under Amnesty Proclamations, Vol. 16 August thru October 1865; unlike other instances, the underlying documents are not available at ancestry.com. Petersburg became the political stronghold of former Confederate General turned Republican, William Mahone, so it is unclear whether Gholson was part of Mahone's postwar railroad reorganization efforts. Death and legacy Gholson died in 1868 in Savannah, Georgia, and his remains were returned to Virginia for burial at Blandford Cemetery. His son, who became an Episcopal priest, would name his son born in Marengo County, Alabama in 1870 after his grandfather.

Description Specimen Similar to other anguillids, the giant mottled eel is cylindrical with small, well-developed pectoral fins and a protruding lower jaw. The eel has thick, fleshy lips. The eel has dorsal and anal fins that are continuous around the tail, with the origin of the dorsal-fin origin between the pectoral fins and anus. It has small, oval-shaped scales that are embedded in the skin. Unlike some other anguillid species, this species has a mottled color. The adult eels are yellow with a greenish-brown to black marbling on their back and a white belly. The young elvers have less visible marbling and are grayish to yellow. The dorsal fin of the marbled eel is closer to the gill opening than to the anus, more anterior than other species of Anguilla. Like all anguillid eels, it does not have pelvic fins. The head is rounded and the snout is depressed. Its teeth are small and in bands. It has a total of 100 to 110 vertebrae. It can grow up to 2 meters (6.6 ft) for females and 1.5 meters (4.9 ft) for males and can weigh up to 20.5 kilograms (45 lb), making it the largest species of anguillid eels. The marbled eel can live up to about 40 years. Distribution and habitat This anguillid species can be found from East Africa to French Polynesia and as far north as southern Japan. In Africa, it may be found within Mozambique and the lower Zambezi River. The giant mottled eel has the widest distribution of all the Anguilla eels. It is usually found in tropical climates between 24¬∞N to 33¬∞S. It has also been found in other more distant regions such as the Galapagos possibly due to abnormal larval transport associated with El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation events. It is not on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, but in Taiwan, it is endangered. In 2002, a single eel was captured from a pond close to Kaupo, Maui, Hawaii, though it is not indigenous to the area. Ecology and behaviour Life cycle of eels The adults of this species are demersal, living on the bottom of fresh to brackish waters, in rivers, lakes, and tributaries. This species and all anguillid eels are catadromous, migrating sometimes long distances out into the open ocean to spawning over deep water. A spawning area of this species is known to be west of the Mariana Islands in an area of the North Equatorial Current in the western North Pacific, but other spawning areas are thought to exist in the western South Pacific and Indian Ocean. Marbled eels spend their adult lives in freshwater or estuarine habitats, and migrate to the ocean to reproduce. When the eggs hatch, the leptocephali drift in ocean currents for months until they reach estuaries as glass eels where they migrate upstream into freshwater as elvers. Then, after about 8 to 20 years in brackish or freshwater, the yellow eels grow up into silver eels (mature eels), and they return to the ocean for reproduction. Feeding The marbled eel is carnivorous, but harmless, with a wide-ranging diet, eating shrimp, crabs, bony fish, and frogs. It is nocturnal, so it is active at night. Significance to humans right Like other anguillid eels, this species is used as a source of food in some regions. Some restaurants buy live eels. In 1992, for example, a typical 12 kilogram (26.5 lb) marbled eel retailed for one thousand US dollars in China. An eel habitat, Cheonjiyeon Waterfalls' pond, is a natural monument in South Korea. Large individuals of this species are also highly regarded and are not harmed by native people in some island groups of the western Pacific.

She has been able to advance the science of the electroencephalogram by applications of a laser. She compares the current technology in that area to listening to all of the people on two and a half Earths, as not much can be discovered from this listening. Her laser electroencephalogram (LEG) can scan each individual brain cell so rapidly that there is no temperature change, and yet more information is given.

History NPACE was formed in 1980 by a small group of New England Nurse Practitioners. At the time, there was a lack of conferences that addressed the specific educational requirements of Nurse Practitioners (NP). Up to this point, nurse practitioners attended educational conferences designed for physicians. Noticing this void, the NPACE founders‚Äô vision was to develop continuing education programs ‚ÄúFor Nurse Practitioners, by Nurse Practitioners.‚Äù It was the first formal organization to focus on the continuing education needs of nurse practitioners. The first NPACE conferences were held in the Greater Boston area. Over a twelve-year time span, NPACE continually expanded its reach. NPACE held its first national conference in Boston in 1992, with one thousand Nurse Practitioners from all over the country in attendance. NPACE began to expand its offerings to other geographic locations. Orlando, Florida became a regular venue for an annual National Primary Care Conference, followed by the Midwest, typically Chicago. In response to the ever-evolving role of nurse practitioners, NPACE soon added specialty conferences to its calendar; including women‚Äôs health, older adult health, alternative/complementary health and pharmacology. From 1997 - 2005 the NPACE peer-reviewed professional journal, Clinical Excellence for Nurse Practitioners, was published first by Churchill Livingstone and then by Springer Publishing Company. NPACE celebrated the beginning of its 25th year at the Boston primary care conference in November 2007. All founding members returned and were honored at this event.

The district surrounding Rua 25 de Mar√ßo has long been synonymous in Brazil with large crowds and discount shopping. History Much of the area that is Rua 25 de Mar√ßo today was originally part of the Tamanduate√≠ River. A series of river engineering projects in the late nineteenth and earlier twentieth centuries realigned the Tamanduate√≠ and Anhangaba√∫ rivers, moving the river and the port further to the east. The old port, Porto Geral, lends its name to one of the major cross streets of 25 de Mar√ßo, Ladeira Porto Geral. The original street name, \\"Rua de Baixo\\", refers to the low (baixo) position of the land in comparison with the streets uphill to the west. In 1865 the name change was changed to commemorate the date of Brazil's first constitution, signed on 25 March 1824. Painting Rua 25 de Mar√ßo, circa 1894 by Antonio Ferrigno Waves of Middle Eastern immigrants arrived at the port and settled in the area during the latter half of the nineteenth century. In 1887 Lebanese immigrant Benjamin Jafet opened the first store on Rua 25 de Mar√ßo. Other merchants began opening their own shops and the area grew. During the 1960s the area suffered with frequent flooding, which damaged the merchandise. The resulting necessity to sell large quantities of inventory quickly and at deep discounts established Rua 25 de Mar√ßo's reputation as a center for wholesale pricing. By the 1980s other immigrant communities from Korea, China, Greece, and Portugal began to open up shops on 25 de Mar√ßo and neighboring streets. The commercial activity in the area had expanded to include more than wholesale shops by the end of the twentieth century. Present day The area between the S√£o Bento Monastery and the Municipal Market along Ladeira Porto Geral, as well as the street itself and other smaller side streets is commonly referred to by locals as Rua 25 de Mar√ßo. There are three main shopping malls in the area: The Shopping 25 de Mar√ßo (25th of March Mall), Shopping Oriental (Oriental Mall) and the most famous Galeria Pag√© (Pag√© Gallery) and at the streets you can find a lot of stores with a miscellaneous kind of products, including tennis shoes, toys, packaging, jewelry, bags, and stationery. Most of these stores sells only in bulk and low prices, so many stores owners from far districts or other cities come to this place to buy goods for resale. Also end user consumer can buy goods, but at higher prices. Crime Brazil taxes on electronics are high, but these items can be found on 25 de Mar√ßo for relatively low prices. However, the area has been subject to raids by the police for tax irregularities and counterfeit goods. Every year, Federal Police and Brazilian Customs make arrests in the 25 de Mar√ßo area, especially the Galeria Page and Shopping 25 de Mar√ßo. They confiscate smuggled or unauthorized products and close the stores who are selling these products.

The congregation, which is part of two denominations in the Reformed tradition‚Äîthe United Church of Christ and the Reformed Church in America‚Äîis now located at 272 Fifth Avenue at the corner of West 29th Street in the NoMad neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City. It was built in 1851‚Äì54 and was designed by Samuel A. Warner in Romanesque Revival style with Gothic trim. The facade is covered in Tuckahoe marble,, p.80 for which the church, originally called the Fifth Avenue Church, was renamed in 1906., p.140 The building was designated a New York City landmark in 1967, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. History A photochrom postcard, The church congregation was founded in 1628 as the Collegiate Reformed Protestant Dutch Church and was affiliated with the Dutch Reformed Church, a Calvinist church in the Netherlands. During its first 150 years, Marble shared its ministers with the other Collegiate congregations as they developed in the city. This pooling of pastoral ministry was abandoned in 1871. The name \\"Collegiate\\" remains as part of the heritage of the four such churches in New York City today, and they participate in an administrative unit that oversees physical properties and investments held in common. The other congregations are Middle Collegiate, West End Collegiate, and Fort Washington Collegiate. Norman Vincent Peale, the noted author of The Power of Positive Thinking, served as senior minister from 1932 to 1984. Under Peale's ministry Marble's influence reached national levels and it became known as \\"America's Hometown Church\\". On November 19, 1961, Lucille Ball married her second husband Gary Morton in the church. Following Peale's fifty- two year ministry, Arthur Caliandro served 25 years as the fifth senior minister of Marble Church. In all, he served 42 years on the pastoral staff. During Caliandro's tenure, MarbleVision, the media ministry of Marble Church, was founded, its first woman minister was ordained, and the first women elders received. In addition, the church added its first new stained-glass window in almost 100 years. In 2009, Michael B. Brown, former pastor of Centenary United Methodist Church in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, succeeded Caliandro as senior minister. Peale was the reason why the Trump family came to attend Marble Collegiate Church; Peale also officiated the first marriage of Donald to Ivana Trump in 1977.MJ Lee: God and the Don. In: CNN.com, June 2, 2017. In 1993, Marble's Minister Arthur Caliandro performed Trump's marriage to Marla Maples in the Grand Ballroom of the Plaza Hotel owned at the time by Trump. During his 2015‚Äì16 run for the Republican Party's presidential nomination, Donald Trump claimed to attend Marble Collegiate Church. Marble stated that though he has a history with the church, Trump is not currently an active member of Marble's congregation. The church takes an LGBT-welcoming, open and affirming approach to same-gender relationships and non-cisgender identities. This includes the performing of same-sex marriage ceremonies, a designated queer fellowship (GIFTS), annual participation in the NYC Pride parade and sermons and material on the church website encouraging a historical-critical view of Scripture in opposition to the conservative belief in Biblical Inerrancy.

During his career he has worked with a wide range of subjects including civil rights pioneer Charles Evers, Nobel Prize winning physicist Eugene Wigner, former co-chairman of Goldman Sachs John Whitehead, former United States Senator Edward Brooke, founding director of Xerox PARC George Pake, eminent surgeon Dr. Charles Epps, head of the Missouri Botanical Garden Peter Raven, and former Boston mayor Raymond Flynn. In 2015, Szanton began working with former New Jersey senator Bill Bradley, conducting interviews for Senator Bradley's oral history. A successful ghostwriter and memoir coach commonly performs a range of tasks: mastering whatever published material is directly relevant to telling the life story; helping the memoir subject to gather and evaluate family letters, manuscripts and photos; interviewing family, friends, and colleagues; and perhaps most important of all, seeing the essential patterns of the life, and helping the subject eloquently trace those patterns through their life, understanding the ways that certain experiences of childhood and youth can shape the choices of the mature person. Andrew Szanton honed his approach to memoir writing for a number of years as an instructor at the Extension School of Harvard University. A 1985 graduate of Princeton University, Andrew Szanton worked for several years as an oral historian for the Smithsonian Institution before becoming an author. It was through the Smithsonian that Szanton first encountered the Hungarian-American Eugene Wigner, a famously modest man who had always resisted entreaties to write his memoirs. Reminded of his own mortality by the raft of old friends and colleagues dying, Dr. Wigner agreed to write his memoir, with Szanton assisting. The result was \\"The Recollections of Eugene P. Wigner\\". \\"Have No Fear\\" with Charles Evers followed in 1997 and \\"Bridging the Divide\\" with Edward Brooke was published in 2007. Memoir collaboration was once commonly the work of journalists or academics, working as a sideline. For example, a critic of popular music for a major newsmagazine might be hired to bring material to, and check the accuracy of, the rich but scattered spoken recollections of a pop star. The journalist critic was hired primarily for what he or she knew about the subject area, and for an ability to meet deadlines‚Äînot for any particular dedication to, or demonstrated skill at, the memoir form. The books that resulted were advertised as \\"By (the headliner) \\"as told to\\" the collaborator, as though the collaborator were merely a scribe. Andrew Szanton is a writer who places memoir collaboration at the center of his art, and has few institutional connections. In 2015, he began working with Princeton. Memoir collaborators often bring to their work detailed knowledge from certain fields‚ÄîSzanton is something of an expert in the early history of atomic weaponry and of the U.S. civil rights movement from 1963-1971. But Szanton stakes his claim to co-authorship less on any fund of relevant knowledge than on his mastery of the memoir form. Szanton lives in Newton, Massachusetts with his wife Barbara. They have two children.

Called the \\"Right to Vote on Taxes Act,\\"Prop. 218, ¬ß 1. it was sponsored by the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association as a constitutional follow-up to the landmark property tax reduction initiative constitutional amendment, Proposition 13, approved in 1978.

This includes numerous additional requirements for special benefit assessments on real propertyCal. Const., art. XIII D, ¬ß 4. as well as numerous requirements for property-related fees and charges, such as utility fees imposed by local governments which are no longer allowed to exceed the cost of providing the utility service.Cal. Const., art. XIII D, ¬ß 6. The California Senate Office of Research listed Proposition 218 as one of the most significant laws of the 20th century in California. Proposition 218 was the first successful initiative constitutional amendment in California history to add more than one article to the California Constitution and to alter the scope of the constitutional initiative power.California Statewide Initiatives 1912‚Äì2000 (2003), Initiative & Referendum Institute. The measure was drafted by constitutional attorneys Jonathan Coupal and Jack Cohen.  General Information  The official legal title of the measure was: \\"Voter Approval for Local Government Taxes. Limitations on Fees, Assessments, and Charges. Initiative Constitutional Amendment.\\"Ballot Pamphlet, California General Election (November 5, 1996), Official Title and Summary of Proposition 218 Prepared by the Attorney General, p. 72. The Findings and Declarations provision contained in Proposition 218 stated that: \\"The people of the State of California hereby find and declare that Proposition 13 was intended to provide effective tax relief and to require voter approval of tax increases. However, local governments have subjected taxpayers to excessive tax, assessment, fee and charge increases that not only frustrate the purposes of voter approval for tax increases, but also threaten the economic security of all Californians and the California economy itself. This measure protects taxpayers by limiting the methods by which local governments exact revenue from taxpayers without their consent.\\"Prop. 218, ¬ß 2. Proposition 218 has been part of the California Constitution for .  Conditions Leading to Proposition 218  The special assessment and property-related fee reforms contained in Proposition 218 were a response to fiscal conservatives' views of local taxation practices in the 1980s and 1990s following the passage of Proposition 13. After Proposition 13 passed in 1978, local governments looked for ways to raise additional revenues and avoid the two-thirds voter approval requirement for special taxes under Proposition 13. Proposition 218 proponents claimed that local governments discovered a particularly pernicious way to raise additional revenues and avoid the Proposition 13 two-thirds local voter approval requirement for taxes by using assessment districts. Special assessments on real property became a vehicle of choice for local politicians looking to avoid making hard decisions regarding general fund expenditures.  The 1992 California Supreme Court Knox Case  The property assessment loophole floodgates opened wide following a controversial 1992 California Supreme Court decision (known as the Knox case) holding that Proposition 13 restrictions, particularly the two-thirds voter approval requirement for local special taxes, did not apply to special benefit assessments on real property.Knox v. City of Orland, 4 Cal. 4th 132 (December 1992). As a result of the Knox decision, local governments could legally impose special assessments on real property for a wide range of purposes without voter approval. Special assessments effectively became unrestricted property tax increases appearing on the property tax bills of millions of California property owners. There were no legal limits on how high special assessments could go, or how many special assessments could be imposed on a parcel of private property. Once the special assessment loophole following the Knox decision was created, one lawyer working with local government politicians wrote that property assessments in California \\"are now limited only by the limits of human imagination.\\"Ballot Pamphlet, California General Election (November 5, 1996), argument in favor of Proposition 218, p. 76. Some of the more imaginative special assessments imposed by local governments included: (1) A \\"view tax\\" in southern California ‚Äì the better the view of the ocean the property owner had the more the owner paid; (2) In northern California, property owners 27 miles away from a park were assessed because their property allegedly benefited from that park.  Property-Related Fee and Charge Abuses By Local Governments  While not receiving the same level of media attention as special assessments on real property, controversial property-related fees and charges became a significant problem following the passage of Proposition 13, as many local governments labeled taxes as \\"fees\\" or \\"charges\\" and imposed them without voter approval. For example, the California Supreme Court ruled that a local municipal utility, such as a city providing domestic water service, is entitled to a reasonable \\"return on investment\\" (otherwise referred to as \\"profit\\").Hansen v. City of San Buenaventura, 42 Cal. 3d 1172 (December 1986). As a result, a local municipal utility could legally overcharge its customers in excess of the cost of providing the utility service, and then transfer the excess cost revenues to the general fund of the local agency to be spent at the discretion of local politicians. All this could generally be done without voter approval.  Proposition 218 Election Campaign  Proposition 218 was considered a sleeper measure by the media as local governments were prohibited from using public funds and resources to campaign against it, and because greater media attention had been given to the Proposition 209 ban on affirmative action and the Proposition 215 medical marijuana initiative measures which appeared on the same election ballot. Proposition 218 was initially estimated to cost local governments in California at least $100 million per year with long-term cost estimates being much greater in the billions of dollars per year, and Moody's Investors Service warned the initiative measure would cause \\"significantly declining credit quality.\\" The credit ratings issue became so heated during the Proposition 218 election campaign that the California State Treasurer, in an effort to calm the municipal bond market, took the extraordinary step of warning measure opponents against exaggerating the possible negative impacts on local government credit ratings and bond issuances when discussing Proposition 218.  Campaign Opposition and Support  Like Proposition 13 in 1978, Proposition 218 was opposed by the vast majority of prominent newspapers and the political establishment. Opposition to Proposition 218 included public employee unions, local governments, local government interest organizations, environmental interest groups, public education interest groups, and private business firms that underwrite municipal bonds. Of the total campaign contributions received against Proposition 218, 74% came from public employee unions, and those interests contributing $10,000 or more represented 91% of the total contributions received by the Proposition 218 opposition campaign.Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder, Citizens for Voters' Rights (No on 218), Form 419 Ballot Measure Committee Campaign Disclosure Statements. Also similar to Proposition 13, there were dire predictions from the measure opponents, especially local government officials, regarding what would happen if Proposition 218 were to be approved by the voters. Some examples included: Expensive landscaping would die and become fodder for devastating fires. Silicon Valley would be shut down forever. Parks, senior centers, and other public buildings would shut down. Neighborhoods would no longer be safe. The initiative would immediately have a devastating effect on local government finance. The initiative would force local governments to go back decades and destroy their method of service delivery. The initiative would be a mortal threat to fire safety. The supporters of Proposition 218 focused on the primary benefit that voters would have the constitutional right to vote on local government taxes.Ballot Pamphlet, California General Election (November 5, 1996), Rebuttal to Argument Against Proposition 218, p. 77. Proposition 218 supporters also urged voters to review their property tax bill which would confirm the growing list of property-related fees, charges and special assessments imposed by local governments without voter approval.Ballot Pamphlet, California General Election (November 5, 1996), Argument in Favor of Proposition 218, p. 76.  Election Results and Summary Statistics  Proposition 218 passed with 56.55% support statewide, representing a margin of victory of 13.1 percentage points.See Statement of the Vote , page xiii. Proposition 218 passed in 54 (93%) of the 58 counties in California.California Secretary of State, Statement of Vote November 5, 1996, pp. 43‚Äì45. Proposition 218 passed in 405 (86%) of the 469 cities in California in 1996.California Secretary of State, Supplement to the Statement of Vote November 5, 1996, pp. 177‚Äì200. Proposition 218 passed in 67 (84%) of the 80 current State Assembly Districts and 34 (85%) of the 40 current State Senate Districts in California (based on 2011 Redistricting currently in effect). This means that Proposition 218 passed in the overwhelming majority of current state legislative districts in California without regard to the political party representation (Democrat or Republican) in those districts. For the 2019‚Äì20 Legislative Session, Proposition 218 passed in 79% of the legislative districts held by Democrats and in 100% of the legislative districts held by Republicans. Proposition 218 received 62% support in the 26 California counties with a Republican voter registration advantage and 54% support in the 32 California counties with a Democratic voter registration advantage during the November 1996 statewide election.California Secretary of State, Statement of Vote November 5, 1996, pp. vi‚Äìviii, 43‚Äì45. What made the Proposition 218 victory so unusual was that it was behind in nearly all the polls, especially final polls just before the election. Polling from the Proposition 218 opposition campaign revealed the measure was expected to lose by about 15 percentage points. Proposition 218 was also significantly behind in the final Field Poll with only 36% support from likely voters. Proposition 218 ended up winning by 13 percentage points. The large variation between the final polling numbers and the election results was a politically rare event for statewide initiative measures in California.  Profound Impact on California Governance  Following the November 1996 election, a high level official from the California State Association of Counties wrote that Proposition 218 \\"profoundly changes the way California is governed\\" and \\"may prove to be the most revolutionary act in the history of California.\\" The author of an article in a League of California Cities publication wrote the following about the passage of Proposition 218: \\"Voters now hold the power to direct or withdraw monetary resources for government functions. Motivated by distrust, the voters' objective was to replace reliance on elected representatives with direct voter control over local government finances.\\" Joel Fox, president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association when Proposition 218 passed, stated that Proposition 218 is \\"not in the Proposition 13 class, but it's the next level.\\"  Article XIII C ‚Äì Local Government Taxes  Section 3 of Proposition 218 added Article XIII C to the California Constitution. Article XIII C relates primarily to local government taxes, including applicable voter approval requirements.  Constitutional Definitions  Section 1 of Article XIII C contains definitions applicable to the article.  \\"Local Government\\"  Section 1 definitions include the term \\"local government\\" setting forth the public entities subject to the article. The term \\"local government\\" for purposes of Proposition 218 is very broadly defined to counter a previous narrow interpretation given by the California Supreme Court under Proposition 13Los Angeles County Transportation Commission v. Richmond, 31 Cal. 3d 197 (April 1982). which created loopholes allowing some local agencies to circumvent constitutional voter approval requirements for taxes. Government entities subject to Proposition 218 are local and regional governments, including counties, cities, a city and county, school districts, community college districts, public authorities, joint powers agencies, and special districts such as water or fire districts.Cal. Const., art. XIII C, ¬ß 1, subd. (b). The \\"local government\\" definition also expressly states that it includes charter cities having a local charter (similar to a local constitution) as their primary source of power.  Local Tax Types  Section 1 also defines the types of taxes local governments may levy. A \\"general tax\\" is any tax imposed for general governmental purposes.Cal. Const., art. XIII C, ¬ß 1, subd. (a). A \\"special tax\\" is any tax imposed for specific purposes, including a tax imposed for specific purposes which is placed into a general fund.Cal. Const., art. XIII C, ¬ß 1, subd. (d). The general versus special tax distinction existed in California prior to Proposition 218, but Proposition 218 contains a broader definition of \\"special tax\\" as also including taxes imposed for specific purposes that are placed into a general fund. = Special Tax = If a local government tax is legally dedicated for one or more specific purposes it is a special tax.Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association v. City of Roseville, 106 Cal. App. 4th 1178 (February 2003). Proposition 218 also requires certain taxes relating to real property (e.g., parcel taxes) be levied as special taxes.Cal. Const., art. XIII D, ¬ß 3, subd. (a), par. (2). Proposition 218 further specifies that many local governments, including school districts, do not have the power to levy general taxes which means that such local governments (known as special purpose districts or agencies) can only legally levy special taxes.Cal. Const., art. XIII C, ¬ß 2, subd. (a). = General Tax = To the extent a local government has the power to levy a general tax and that a particular tax is not required to be levied as a special tax, a tax is general only when its revenues are placed into the general fund of the local government and are available for expenditure for any and all governmental purposes.  \\"Tax\\" Definition and Proposition 26 (2010)  During the November 2010 General Election, California voters passed Proposition 26 which, in part, added a broad constitutional definition of \\"tax\\" for purposes of Proposition 218.Cal. Const., art. XIII C, ¬ß 1, subd. (e). Proposition 218 did not include a specific constitutional definition of \\"tax,\\" but California appellate courts, prior to the passage of Proposition 26 in 2010, generally broadly construed what constitutes a \\"tax\\" such as concluding that a 911 \\"fee\\" was really a special tax subject to two-thirds voter approval.Bay Area Cellular Telephone Company v. City of Union City, 162 Cal. App. 4th 686 (April 2008). If a local government levy, charge or exaction is a \\"tax\\" under the Proposition 26 constitutional definition, then voter approval is required under Proposition 218 if that tax is a new tax, an increased tax, or a tax extension.Cal. Const., art. XIII C, ¬ß 2. A local government levy that is not a tax under Proposition 26 may nonetheless be subject to Proposition 218 constitutional protections under Article XIII D if the levy is either a special assessment on real property or a property-related fee or charge. = Local Initiative Power to Reduce or Repeal Nontax Fees and Charges = Local government fees and charges that are neither taxes under Proposition 26 nor subject to Article XIII D are generally subject to reduction or repeal using the local initiative power under Proposition 218, including the significantly reduced signature requirement thereunder. This gives local voters a legislative remedy to hold an election concerning a nontax levy approved by a local government where an election is not automatically required by Proposition 218. One example is a fee on the extraction of groundwater. In 2017, the California Supreme Court held that a fee imposed upon persons on the extraction of groundwater is no longer a property-related fee subject to the requirements of Proposition 218, although such fees remain subject to Proposition 26 provisions defining when a local levy is a tax.City of San Buenaventura v. United Water Conservation District, 3 Cal. 5th 1191 (December 2017).  Voter Approval Requirements and Related Provisions for Local Taxes  Section 2 of Article XIII C contains the voter approval requirements for local government taxes. Under Proposition 218, every local government tax is either a general tax or a special tax. Proposition 218 does not allow a local tax to be a hybrid tax. The type of tax a local government imposes (general or special) is legally significant because it determines the applicable voter approval requirement. Special purpose districts or agencies, including school districts, have no power to levy general taxes and can only impose special taxes. This restriction is based on prior judicial interpretations of Proposition 13Rider v. County of San Diego, 1 Cal. 4th 1 (December 1991); Hoogasian Flowers, Inc. v. State Board of Equalization, 23 Cal. App. 4th 1264 (March 1994). which Proposition 218 constitutionalized. As a practical matter, only a city or a county has the power to levy a majority vote general tax under Proposition 218. The voter approval requirement under Proposition 218 was generally upheld by a California appellate court in 1998 as not constituting an unconstitutional referendum.Consolidated Fire Protection District v. Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, 63 Cal. App. 4th 211 (April 1998).  When Voter Approval Required  The voter approval requirement for taxes under Proposition 218 is triggered when a local government \\"imposes,\\" \\"extends,\\" or \\"increases\\" a tax. What constitutes a tax \\"increase\\" under Proposition 218 was broadly construed by a California appellate court in 2007.AB Cellular LA, LLC v. City of Los Angeles, 150 Cal. App. 4th 747 (May 2007). The applicable electorate for conducting a local tax election is generally the registered voters of the local government.City of San Diego v. Shapiro, 228 Cal. App. 4th 756 (August 2014).Neilson v. City of California City, 133 Cal. App. 4th 1296 (November 2005). = New Taxes = New local government taxes require voter approval under Proposition 218.Owens v. County of Los Angeles, 220 Cal. App. 4th 107 (October 2013). The term \\"imposed\\" for purposes of triggering the voter approval requirement under Proposition 218 typically refers to the first enactment of a tax.Citizens Association of Sunset Beach v. Orange County Local Agency Formation Commission, 209 Cal. App. 4th 1182 (October 2012). = Tax \\"Increase\\" = When local governments \\"increase\\" a local tax, voter approval is required under Proposition 218. The California Legislature adopted a statute interpreting the term \\"increase\\" for purposes of Proposition 218Cal. Gov. Code, ¬ß 53750, subd. (h). although the courts have final say in interpreting the applicable constitutional language. A tax is \\"increased\\" for purposes of Proposition 218 when a local government makes a decision that does any of the following: (1) increases any applicable rate used to calculate the tax; or (2) revises the methodology by which the tax is calculated, if that revision results in an increased amount being levied on any person or parcel of property.Cal. Gov. Code, ¬ß 53750, subd. (h), par. (1). The term \\"methodology\\" refers to a mathematical equation for calculating taxes that is officially sanctioned by a local government. In practical terms, a tax is \\"increased\\" under Proposition 218 if the math behind it is altered so that either a larger tax rate or a larger tax base is part of the calculation. An example application of the foregoing to an unresolved legal issue is when utility rates are increased in local governments having a related utility users tax. A utility rate increase can also result in increased utility user tax payments and revenues for the benefit of the local government. A properly levied utility rate increase can be applied for purposes of generating increased utility revenues, but if those increased utility rates are also applied for purposes of generating increased utility user tax revenues, that might be a tax \\"increase\\" for purposes of triggering the voter approval requirement under Proposition 218. A tax is not \\"increased\\" under Proposition 218 when a local government does either or both of the following: (1) adjusts the amount of a tax in accordance with a schedule of adjustments, including a clearly defined formula for inflation adjustment that was adopted by the local government prior to the effective date of Proposition 218 (November 6, 1996); or (2) implements or collects a previously approved tax so long as the tax rate is not increased beyond the level previously approved by the local government, and the methodology previously approved by the local government is not revised so as to result in an increase in the amount being levied on any person or parcel of property.Cal. Gov. Code, ¬ß 53750, subd. (h), par. (2). A tax is also not \\"increased\\" under Proposition 218 in the case in which the actual payments from a person or property are higher than would have resulted when the local government approved the tax, if those higher payments are attributable to events other than an increased tax rate or revised methodology, such as a change in the density, intensity, or nature of the use of land.Cal. Gov. Code, ¬ß 53750, subd. (h), par. (3). = Tax \\"Extension\\" = When a local government \\"extends\\" a local tax, voter approval is required under Proposition 218. The California Legislature adopted a statute narrowly interpreting the term \\"extended\\" for purposes of the tax provisions of Proposition 218.Cal. Gov. Code, ¬ß 53750, subd. (e). However, the courts have final say in interpreting the applicable constitutional language. A tax is \\"extended\\" for purposes of Proposition 218 when, as applied to an existing tax, a local government extends the stated effective period for the tax, including, but not limited to, amendment or removal of a sunset provision or expiration date. The term \\"extend\\" as applied to a tax has been interpreted not to apply to geographic areas in certain annexation proceedings. While expanding the geographic area subject to a tax may not constitute an \\"extension,\\" it may constitute a tax \\"increase\\" and thereby trigger the voter approval requirement under Proposition 218 on that basis. = Tax \\"Modernization\\" = Some local governments have combined in the same ballot measure a minor tax reduction (which does not require voter approval) with a tax base expansion that does require voter approval under Proposition 218 because it is considered a tax increase.Cal. Const., art. XIII C, ¬ß 2; AB Cellular LA, LLC v. City of Los Angeles, 150 Cal. App. 4th 747 (May 2007). This is often done with utility user tax \\"modernization\\" measures with the nominal tax rate reduction component serving to make the tax more politically attractive to voters. When such a ballot measure is presented to voters, the full text of the measure should be reviewed so that voters will be more fully informed about the specifics of the tax proposal, particularly as it relates to any expansion of the tax base which is the legal reason why the tax appears on the ballot for voter approval. Controversy also exists whether utility user tax \\"modernization\\" measures permit local governments to impose taxes on online video streaming services. With regard to previously approved \\"modernization\\" measures, voters may have unknowingly authorized the imposition of taxes on online video streaming services. This places greater emphasis on the need for voters to carefully review the text of any tax \\"modernization\\" measure to determine whether taxes on online video streaming services would be authorized. To the extent that previously approved tax \\"modernization\\" measures are interpreted to include taxes on online video streaming services, voters/taxpayers have an available legislative remedy using the local initiative power under Proposition 218 to reduce or repeal any tax on online video streaming services.  General Tax Vote Requirement  Under Article XIII C, a local government may not impose, extend, or increase any general tax unless the tax is first submitted to the electorate and approved by a majority vote. Proposition 218 requires that general tax elections be consolidated with a regularly scheduled general election for members of the governing body of the local government, except in cases of an emergency declared by a unanimous vote of the governing body.Cal. Const., art. XIII C, ¬ß 2, subd. (b). The California Supreme Court construed the election consolidation requirement to not apply when a general tax is proposed by the voters exercising the local initiative power.California Cannabis Coalition v. City of Upland, 3 Cal. 5th 924 (August 2017). Some local governments, in an effort to accelerate the election date for a general tax measure, have invoked the emergency exception applicable to the election consolidation requirement under questionable circumstances. When this occurs, often the only practical remedy available to voters is to make the emergency exception controversy a political issue during the election campaign, especially since significant additional special election costs are usually incurred as a result of invoking the emergency exception. Since general taxes are not legally dedicated for specific purposes, they can generally be spent at the complete discretion of local politicians, including on public employee salaries and benefits. = General Tax Abuses By Local Governments = Some local governments in an effort to evade the two-thirds voter approval requirement for special taxes under Proposition 218 may express legally nonbinding intent to spend general tax proceeds for one or more specific purposes. This may be done in several forms such as the adoption of intent language before the tax election date, the formation of an advisory committee relating to the expenditure of the tax proceeds, or by placing a companion advisory measure on the same election ballot. Use of a companion advisory measure associated with an unrestricted local tax measure was found by a California appellate court to be a general tax notwithstanding the expanded special tax definition under Proposition 218.Johnson v. County of Mendocino, 25 Cal. App. 5th 1017 (August 2018). Controversial general tax measures intended for one or more specific purposes also have the effect of circumventing California accountability laws designed to protect taxpayers by ensuring that local government taxes imposed for specific purposes are actually spent as set forth in the ballot measure.Cal. Gov. Code, ¬ß¬ß 50075.1, 50075.3. Local governments also sometimes refer to a general tax as a \\"vital services\\" tax in order to make the tax more politically attractive to voters. A true general tax under Proposition 218 can generally be spent on public services or programs that are not deemed \\"vital\\" by a local government. This can include controversial purposes such as financing high public employee salaries and benefits or paying for excessive public employee pension obligations. General tax proceeds placed into the general fund of a local government may generally not be subsequently pledged to repay bonded indebtedness.City of Redondo Beach v. Taxpayers, 54 Cal. 2d 126 (May 1960).City of Palm Springs v. Ringwald, 52 Cal. 2d 620 (August 1959). A general tax must be available for expenditure for any and all governmental purposes in order to remain a valid general tax.Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association v. City of Roseville, 106 Cal. App. 4th 1178, 1185 (February 2003). When a controversial general tax measure is presented by a local government, often the only practical remedy available to voters is to make the controversial tax measure a political issue during the election campaign. The Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association has published various \\"taxpayer tools\\" to assist taxpayers in situations such as when a controversial general tax measure is placed on the ballot by a local government.  Special Tax Vote Requirement  A local government may not impose, extend, or increase any special tax unless the tax is first submitted to the electorate and approved by a two-thirds vote.Cal. Const., art. XIII C, ¬ß 2, subd. (d). Proposition 218 contains an additional requirement that any tax subject to voter approval assessed upon a parcel of real property or upon a person as an incident of real property ownership must be a special tax subject to two-thirds voter approval. As a practical matter, this means all parcel taxes (taxes on real property not based on the assessed value of the property) must be levied as special taxes subject to two-thirds voter approval.  Application of Proposition 218 Tax Restrictions to Local Initiatives  In California Cannabis Coalition v. City of Upland, 3 Cal. 5th 924 (August 2017), the California Supreme Court in a controversial 5‚Äì2 split decision held that the election consolidation requirement applicable to general taxes under Proposition 218Cal. Const., art. XIII C, ¬ß 2, subd. (b). Majority vote general taxes \\"shall be consolidated with a regularly scheduled general election for members of the governing body of the local government, except in cases of emergency declared by a unanimous vote of the governing body.\\" does not apply to a local tax initiative placed on the ballot by the electorate exercising the local initiative power. The California Cannabis Coalition decision has raised issues concerning whether the voter approval requirements for local taxes under Proposition 218Cal. Const., art. XIII C, ¬ß 2, subd. (b) [general taxes requiring majority voter approval].Cal. Const., art. XIII C, ¬ß 2, subd. (d) [special taxes requiring two-thirds voter approval]. also apply to a local tax initiative placed on the ballot by the electorate exercising the local initiative power. However, the California Cannabis Coalition case did not involve the voter approval requirements under Proposition 218, but rather involved a narrow election timing issue (the election consolidation requirement) applicable only to general taxesCal. Const., art. XIII C, ¬ß 2, subd. (b) [general tax election consolidation requirement]. which under Proposition 218 may only be levied by cities or counties in California.Cal. Const., art. XIII C, ¬ß 2, subd. (a) [Special purpose districts or agencies, including school districts, have no power to levy general taxes.]. A Proposition 218 specialist law firm representing local governments in California concluded that the California Cannabis Coalition case was a narrow decision that \\"leaves the two-thirds-voter-approval requirement for local taxes in place and makes only a very modest change to earlier understandings of Proposition 218 and the law of initiatives.\\" In support of the foregoing conclusion, the analysis stated: \\"The Court goes on, however, to make clear the two-thirds-voter-approval requirement for special taxes ‚Äì taxes which may be spent only for a stated purpose ‚Äì does apply to initiatives: 'In article XIII C, section 2, subdivision (d), for example, the enactors adopted a requirement providing that, before a local government can impose, extend, or increase any special tax, voters must approve the tax by a two-thirds vote. That constitutes a higher vote requirement than would otherwise apply. ... That the voters explicitly imposed a procedural two-thirds vote requirement on themselves in article XIII C, section 2, subdivision (d) is evidence that they did not implicitly impose a procedural timing requirement in subdivision (b).'\\" Although the California Cannabis Coalition decision was narrow, it has been heavily criticized because in an effort to grant deference to the local initiative power, \\"the court erred in the opposite direction by adopting an overly narrow reading of Proposition 218.\\" Another article noted: \\"The court's decision represents a ridiculously narrow vision of what was intended by Proposition 218.\\" Proposition 218 constitutionally requires that its provisions be \\"liberally construed to effectuate its purposes of limiting local government revenue and enhancing taxpayer consent.\\"Prop. 218, ¬ß 5. The California Supreme Court also previously stated that the constitutional provisions of Proposition 218 are of dignity at least equal to other provisions of the California Constitution.Silicon Valley Taxpayers' Association, Inc. v. Santa Clara County Open Space Authority, 44 Cal. 4th 431, 448 (July 2008). In addition, Proposition 218 also makes it expressly clear with prefacing language that its constitutional requirements applicable to taxes shall apply \\"[n]otwithstanding any other provision of this Constitution.\\"Cal. Const., art. XIII C, ¬ß 2. \\"This Constitution\\" refers to the California Constitution. The local initiative power is provided for in an \\"other provision of this Constitution.\\"Cal. Const., art. II, ¬ß 8, subd. (a) [initiative power in general]; Cal. Const., art. II, ¬ß 11, subd. (a) [counties and general law cities]; Cal. Const., art. XI, ¬ß 5 [city charters]; and Cal. Const., art. XI, ¬ß 3 [charter amendments in charter cities]. None of the foregoing were referenced in the majority opinion in the California Cannabis Coalition case. On October 13, 2017, California Governor Brown signed Assembly Bill No. 765 into law which repealed the initiative special election statutory provision (Section 9214 of the California Elections Code) that was at issue in the California Cannabis Coalition case.Stats. 2017, ch. 748, ¬ß 6. = Voter Approval Requirements for Taxes Previously Applied to Local Initiatives = While the California Cannabis Coalition decision applied only to the election timing requirement for general taxes under Proposition 218, in Altadena Library District v. Bloodgood, 192 Cal. App. 3d 585 (June 1987) the two-thirds voter approval requirement for special taxes under Proposition 13,Cal. Const., art. XIII A, ¬ß 4. a different and older constitutional taxpayer protection provision, has previously been applied to a local initiative tax increase proposed by the electorate exercising the local initiative power.Altadena Library District v. Bloodgood, 192 Cal. App. 3d 585 (June 1987) [initiative parcel tax]. That constitutional two-thirds voter approval requirement under Proposition 13 is independent of Proposition 218 tax restrictions. The California Cannabis Coalition decision did not disapprove or otherwise disturb the 1987 Altadena Library District appellate court decision. In addition, in Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association v. City of San Diego, 120 Cal. App. 4th 374, 390‚Äì394 (July 2004) Proposition 218 voter approval tax restrictions were previously applied to invalidate an initiative measure approved by the electorate exercising the local initiative power that would have required two- thirds voter approval for any general tax proposed by the San Diego City Council, instead of the majority vote approval required under Proposition 218.Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association v. City of San Diego, 120 Cal. App. 4th 374, 390‚Äì394 (July 2004).The court in the City of San Diego case was clear that the ballot measure \\"had been placed on the ballot pursuant to certified petitions presented to the city council.\\" (Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association v. City of San Diego, 120 Cal. App. 4th 374, 379 (July 2004).). The California Cannabis Coalition decision did not disapprove or otherwise disturb the 2004 City of San Diego appellate court decision.  Legal Authority to Impose Local Taxes  Proposition 218 does not legally authorize any local government to impose any tax.Cal. Const., art. XIII D, ¬ß 1, subd. (a). The legal authority to levy a local government tax (known as enabling authority) must come from an independent legal source such as a statute enacted by the California Legislature, and may be subject to additional statutory restrictions. The California Supreme Court has held that a local government must comply with any applicable statutory requirements as well as the constitutional requirements under Proposition 218.Ventura Group Ventures, Inc. v. Ventura Port District, 24 Cal. 4th 1089 (February 2001). An example of an additional statutory restriction is a supermajority vote requirement of the governing body of the local government to place a local tax measure on the ballot. Another example of an additional statutory restriction is that many parcel taxes must be applied uniformly to all taxpayers or real property.  Temporary vs. Permanent Taxes  Under Proposition 218, taxes proposed by a local government may either be temporary or permanent. If a tax is temporary, voter approval is required to extend a tax beyond its expiration date. Permanent local government taxes continue for an indefinite period of time. However, such taxes can be reduced or repealed by either subsequent action of the local governing body itself or by the voters exercising the local initiative power under Proposition 218. Some ballot questions may not specify the duration of a tax, including if a proposed tax would be permanent. In such situations, either the impartial ballot measure summary and/or the full text of the tax measure will specify the duration of a proposed tax. Generally, if no tax duration is specified in the ballot question, the proposed tax is usually permanent. The Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association states that some local governments, in an effort to increase the chances of passing a tax, will propose a temporary tax instead of a permanent tax. The general strategy is once a temporary tax passes, it will be easier for the local government to either extend or increase an already existing tax in the future. Based on historical election statistics, once local government voters pass a \\"temporary\\" tax, it is generally easier to obtain subsequent voter approval for a tax extension or a tax increase. The Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association also states that local governments rarely allow temporary taxes to expire on their own without at least an effort to extend and/or increase the tax, and that voters should assume that any proposed temporary tax will not end at the specified expiration date, but will instead either be extended for an additional period of years or be made permanent.  Local Government Issues Related to Proposition 218 Elections  Local government issues related to Proposition 218 elections can impact the integrity and fairness of the election process.  Opinion Polling Before Placing a Tax Measure on the Ballot  Local governments frequently conduct opinion polling of their voters before deciding whether to place a local tax measure on the ballot. Opinion polls may also be conducted in connection with other revenue sources requiring an election under Proposition 218 such as for a property-related fee or charge or an assessment on real property. The expenditure of public funds to conduct opinion polls is generally permissible under California law. The use of public funds to conduct opinion polling concerning a local tax proposal becomes more controversial when the poll also includes questions of a political nature ordinarily utilized in a subsequent election campaign (e.g., testing support and/or opposition arguments for use in a subsequent tax election campaign) as opposed to merely providing sufficient information to local government officials for purposes of determining whether to place a tax measure on the ballot. An opinion poll prepared by a local government is generally a \\"public record\\"Cal. Gov. Code, ¬ß 6252, subd. (e). whereby a member of the public may make a written request and receive a copy of the opinion poll under the California Public Records Act.Cal. Gov. Code, ¬ß 6253, subd. (b). Payment of a fee covering the direct costs of duplicating any requested pages from an opinion poll may also be required by the local government. California courts have generally been lenient in allowing local governments to spend public funds in connection with activities (such as conducting opinion polling) before a tax proposal is placed on the ballot.Santa Barbara County Coalition Against Automobile Subsidies v. Santa Barbara County Association of Governments, 167 Cal. App. 4th 1229 (October 2008). Some voters may question the appropriateness of local governments spending public funds on opinion polling in connection with a local tax measure, especially if the polling results are subsequently used for political purposes during the election campaign to increase the chances of a local tax being approved by the voters. If this occurs, often the only practical remedy available to voters is to make the matter a political issue during the tax measure election campaign which can adversely impact the chances of the local tax measure being approved by the voters.  Local Government \\"Informational\\" Campaigns in Local Tax Elections  Local governments are legally prohibited from spending public funds and resources to campaign in support of tax measures required to be submitted to the voters under Proposition 218, but local governments are allowed to expend public funds to engage in \\"informational\\" campaigns that educate voters about such tax measures.Vargas v. City of Salinas, 46 Cal. 4th 1 (April 2009). California courts have generally been lenient in allowing local governments to engage in informational campaigns in connection with local tax measures. Some voters may question the appropriateness of local governments spending taxpayer funds on informational campaigns in connection with local tax measures, particularly when the intent and practical effect of such informational campaigns is to increase the chances of a local tax measure being approved by the voters. When questionable or controversial informational campaigns occur, often the only practical remedy available is to make such informational campaigns a political issue during the tax measure political campaign which can adversely impact the chances of the local tax measure being approved by voters. The Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association has released a document to assist taxpayers in matters relating to campaign spending by a local government.  Ballot Questions in Local Tax Elections  Local governments in California are generally allowed to write the ballot question for tax elections required under Proposition 218. The ballot question is the actual text that appears on the election ballot when voters cast their vote on a tax measure. How the ballot question is written can affect the outcome of a tax election. Issues often arise concerning the impartiality of ballot questions prepared by local governments that support tax measures they submit to the voters. California courts have generally allowed local governments significant leeway in preparing tax election ballot questions. Ballot questions can sometimes be misleading to many voters or may include incomplete information regarding the specifics of a tax measure. Local governments also sometimes \\"poll test\\" their ballot questions in an effort to further increase the chances of passing a tax measure. This process involves conducting polling before officially calling an election to determine the specific ballot measure language that yields the highest level of voter support. When controversial ballot questions are prepared by local governments, often the only practical remedy available to voters is to make the controversial ballot question a political issue during the tax measure political campaign, including informing voters about the specifics of the ballot controversy. Effective January 1, 2018, if a proposed local government measure imposes a tax or raises the rate of a tax, the ballot must include in the statement of the measure to be voted on the amount of money to be raised annually, the rate of the tax, and the duration of the tax to be levied.Cal. Elec. Code, ¬ß 13119, subd. (b). The statement of the tax measure must be a true and impartial synopsis of the purpose of the proposed tax measure, and must be in language that is neither argumentative nor likely to create prejudice for or against the tax measure.Cal. Elec. Code, ¬ß 13119, subd. (c). The statement requirement applies regardless of whether the tax measure is proposed by the local governing body or is submitted to the local voters as an initiative or referendum measure.Cal. Elec. Code, ¬ß 13119, subd. (a).  Local Politicians \\"Letting the Voters Decide\\"  The voter approval requirements for local taxes under Proposition 218 are mandatory.Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association v. City of San Diego, 120 Cal. App. 4th 374 (July 2004). Thus, local politicians place tax measures on the ballot for voter approval not by a voluntary choice in support of protecting local taxpayers, but rather in response to the constitutional mandates of Proposition 218. In addition, when local politicians vote to place a local tax measure on the ballot, they are also approving that tax on the merits. This is typically done in the form of a local ordinance or resolution approving the tax. However, the tax approval does not become effective unless and until approved by the voters.Santa Clara County Local Transportation Authority v. Guardino, 11 Cal. 4th 220 (September 1995). Local politicians sometimes claim they are merely \\"letting the voters decide\\" when they vote on a tax proposal that would levy a new tax, a tax increase, or a tax extension. However, this is generally done by local politicians in an effort to avoid political accountability for supporting a tax on the merits.  Voter/Taxpayer Issues Related to Proposition 218 Elections  Voter/taxpayer issues related to Proposition 218 elections can impact the individual voter decision-making process as well as election outcomes.  Voter Considerations in Local Proposition 218 Elections  If a tax is proposed by a local government, it is important to consider the budgetary conditions that led to placing the tax measure on the ballot.  Tax Increases and Public Employee Costs  As public employee salary and benefit obligations increase over time, particularly with regard to pensions and public employee retiree healthcare, the impacts on the local government budget become more significant and can even lead to bankruptcy. Local politicians end up having to reduce public services and/or raise taxes or other revenues such as fees and charges. To the extent that taxes are raised, the tax proceeds will generally either directly or indirectly pay for public employee salary and benefit obligations. Research has shown that many local tax increases are concentrated in California communities that have the largest public employee pension problems.  Tax Increases and Public Safety  Some local governments may also claim a lack of sufficient funding for priority programs and services such as public safety. This is intended to make a tax proposal more politically attractive. The California Constitution mandates that the \\"protection of the public safety is the first responsibility of local government and local officials have an obligation to give priority to the provision of adequate public safety services.\\"Cal. Const., art. XIII, ¬ß 35, subd. (a), par. (2). This constitutional obligation exists regardless of whether a local tax measure is approved by voters.  Cumulative Tax Burdens and Precedent  Some local government tax proposals may be relatively modest in amount, but when added to other taxes currently paid would result in a cumulative tax burden that may be unacceptably high. This is especially the case concerning regressive parcel taxes that disproportionately burden homeowners. Before voting on any local government property tax measure (including any local general obligation bond measure that increases local property taxes to repay the bonds), it is considered a good practice by voters to review their current property tax bill to get a better picture of the cumulative impact of any property tax measure. It is also not unusual for multiple tax proposals to appear on the same election ballot. This not only includes tax proposals from other local governments but sometimes even multiple tax proposals from the same local government. Multiple tax measures on the same ballot can sometimes lead to overwhelming tax burdens to the point where voters end up voting against all tax measures. To avoid significantly higher levels of taxation than expected, voters also need to consider local tax proposals that are likely to appear on the ballot in the near future. Local governments frequently coordinate the scheduling of their tax elections to increase the chances of multiple tax measures passing over a short time window. For example, local tax measures may be placed on the ballot during a statewide primary election in coordination with other local governments placing their tax measures on a statewide general election occurring several months later. More patient local governments are also willing to wait another election cycle for a more favorable election date to increase the chances of passing a local tax. This is especially the case for presidential general elections where voters tend to be more inclined to support taxes. Passage of a local government tax measure also establishes political precedent that often leads to additional and sometimes more expensive tax measures in the future by the same or other local governments in the area.  Availability of Taxpayer Tools  The Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association has published various \\"taxpayer tools\\" to assist taxpayers in situations where a tax measure has been placed on the ballot by a local government.  Availability of Local Government Data for Use by Voters in Tax Elections  In Proposition 218 tax elections, it is often helpful to voters to have financial data regarding the local government proposing the tax so that voters can make a more informed voting decision concerning the merits and need for the tax. This includes the availability of comparative financial data with other local governments, including other local governments similar in population as well as geographical proximity. Much of the financial data about a local government, including detailed budgetary data, can be obtained directly from the local government itself. In some instances, it may be necessary to make written requests under the California Public Records Act. It may also be advisable to obtain data in electronic format to facilitate further study and analysis. Additional information that is generally of value to voters includes public employee salary data, public employee benefits data (including pensions), annual audited financial reports, historical (prior years) budgetary data within the local government, and budgetary projections in future years. Budgetary spending decisions, which typically reflect the spending policies and priorities of a local government, can be particularly helpful in general tax elections where local politicians decide how the tax proceeds will be spent. The California Supreme Court has held that when a public official or employee uses a personal account and/or device to communicate about the conduct of public business, such as e-mails or text messages, the applicable writings may be subject to public disclosure under the California Public Records Act.City of San Jose v. Superior Court, 2 Cal. 5th 608 (March 2017). Such communications may yield information relevant for voter consideration in Proposition 218 tax elections. Large amounts of financial data concerning local governments in California are also available in digital format from state agencies, including the California State Controller, the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration, the California Secretary of State, and the California Department of Education. Local government finance and budgetary data can also be of significant value to voters in connection with the exercise of the local initiative power under Proposition 218 to reduce or repeal local government levies. This includes for purposes of properly designing a tie-in initiative and for targeting alternative revenue sources for reduction or repeal utilizing a compensatory initiative. Such data can also be utilized to bolster findings and declarations in a local initiative under Proposition 218, especially in connection with local government utility fee reductions or repeals that may be subject to statutory utility rate restrictions under California law.  Extensive Data Sources Available  The California State Controller makes extensive and detailed local government financial data available on its Government Financial Reports Data website. The website has years of detailed financial data in an open data format from all California counties, most California cities, thousands of special districts, and pension-related information for state and local government pension plans. Detailed financial data provided about local governments include revenues, expenditures, liabilities, assets, and fund balances. The data are compiled from reports submitted by local governments to the California State Controller as required by law. The financial data are generally unaudited. The California State Controller also makes extensive and detailed salary and other compensation (e.g., retirement and health costs) data for local government public employees in California on its Government Compensation in California website. Extensive tools are provided for data analysis and comparison purposes. Extensive and detailed California local government public employee salary (including benefits) and pension data are also available on the Transparent California website. The data are obtained from local governments pursuant to public record requests under the California Public Records Act. The California Department of Tax and Fee Administration provides sales tax rates for local governments on its website. Current and historical tax rate data are provided. Tax rate data are also available for downloading to facilitate further study and analysis. The sales tax rate data are particularly useful to taxpayers and voters in local sales tax elections. Sales tax rate increases are being used more and more by local governments in California, especially cities, to fund government services, programs, infrastructure, and often high public employee salaries and benefits (including pension obligations). As a result, there exists significant variation in sales tax rates in local jurisdictions throughout California. The California Department of Education provides detailed California K-12 public education data on the Ed-Data website. Student and staff data are available at the state, county, school district, and school levels. Local revenue election data are available at the state, county, and school district levels. Financial data are available at the state and school district levels. Comparison tools at the school district and school levels are also available. The K-12 public education data can be helpful to taxpayers and voters in school parcel tax and school general obligation bond election campaigns. Local government data relating to matters other than budgetary or financial may also be helpful to voters in Proposition 218 tax elections. This includes local government performance data which can give taxpayers/voters a better sense if they are getting good value for the government services or programs to be financed from a Proposition 218 tax measure or their existing tax dollars. Examples include crime data in connection with public safety taxes, student performance data in connection with education taxes (or bonds), traffic data in connection with transportation taxes, public safety response times in connection with a public safety tax, and park usage and maintenance in connection with a parks and recreation tax. Most of the performance data about a local government can be obtained directly from the local government itself. In some instances, it may be necessary to make a written request for performance data under the California Public Records Act. It is generally preferable to obtain the performance data in electronic format to facilitate further study and analysis. The California Secretary of State also provides a tool (known as Power Search) for searching campaign contribution data reported to the Secretary of State under the California Political Reform Act. Only electronically reported, state-level campaign data are generally provided. However, some contributions in local government elections, including tax elections under Proposition 218, are also included. Persons or entities that make campaign contributions at the local level, including in Proposition 218 tax elections, may also make campaign contributions at the state level that are politically relevant in a local tax election campaign. If such state level campaign contributions were made, the search tool will facilitate the identification of those campaign contributions. The California Secretary of State also provides detailed lobbying activity data on the Cal-Access website. This includes detailed data by lobbyist employers such as local governments. Information that is available includes the amount spent on lobbying activities, the names of the lobbyists, and the specific legislation/agencies lobbied. Comparative lobbying data with other lobbyist employers, including other local governments, can also be obtained. California law allows local governments to use public funds to lobby for or against legislation at the state and federal government levels.Cal. Gov. Code, ¬ß 50023. Such lobbying using public funds can also be done indirectly through associations such as the League of California Cities, the California State Association of Counties, and the Association of the California Water Agencies.Cal. Gov. Code, ¬ß 50024. Funding in support of these associations generally comes from annual dues payments (using public funds) made by the member local governments. It is common for local governments to spend significant amounts of public funds to lobby for or against proposed legislation that is contrary to the best interests of taxpayers, including supporting legislation that would erode taxpayer protections such as Propositions 13 and 218. Local governments seeking voter approval for a tax frequently claim a lack of public funding as a basis for proposing the tax. To the extent a local government spends significant public funds on lobbying activities in support of legislation that would erode or otherwise weaken taxpayer protections, this can become a significant campaign issue in a Proposition 218 local tax election.  Election Campaigns Involving Local Government Taxes  Local tax measures typically have well organized and funded support, especially from local public employee unions and frequently from the area business community. Business groups such as the Bay Area Council, the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, and the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce frequently support local tax measures that disproportionately burden ordinary taxpayers, especially local sales taxes and local parcel taxes. Business interests that stand to financially benefit from the passage of a local tax measure also frequently make significant campaign contributions in support of such measures. The ballot arguments contained in the official ballot pamphlet sent to voters are usually the only opportunity for the opponents of a local government tax levy to reach all voters. There is a specified word limit for arguments which is generally set by statute. Arguments must also be accurate and not misleading to avoid a successful legal challenge. Any procedures applicable to the filing of arguments must also be followed. Ballot arguments must generally be filed early in the election process. As a result, it is important for interested voters to find out about the applicable deadlines for filing ballot arguments shortly following the decision by a local government to place a tax measure on the ballot. Ballot argument filing deadlines and requirements can generally be obtained from the local elections official conducting the tax election.  Initiative Power to Reduce or Repeal Local Government Levies  One of the most significant provisions of Proposition 218 constitutionally reserves to local voters the exercise of the initiative power to reduce or repeal any local tax, assessment, fee or charge. The local initiative power under Proposition 218 is a powerful tool available to voters, particularly when local government officials are not responsive to their constituents in matters relating to local taxes, assessments, fees and charges. The specific constitutional language applicable to the local initiative power under Proposition 218 provides:  Reduced Signature Requirement Local Initiative Power  The local initiative power under Proposition 218 is also subject to a significantly reduced signature requirement which cannot exceed the requirement applicable to statewide statutory initiatives. The specific maximum signature requirement under Proposition 218 is five percent (5%) of the votes for all candidates for Governor at the last gubernatorial election within the territory of the local government.  Example Uses of Local Initiative Power Under Proposition 218  The local initiative power under Proposition 218 can be used to reduce or repeal local taxes like utility user taxes, sales taxes, business taxes, parcel taxes, and also to reduce or repeal local government fees and charges such as stormwater fees, groundwater fees, public ambulance/paramedic fees, public park/sports fees, public parking fees, or utility fees and charges for water (including drought fees and surcharges), sewer, or refuse collection services.  Validity of Local Initiative Power Under Proposition 218  Exercise of the local initiative power under Proposition 218 was unanimously confirmed and upheld by the California Supreme Court in Bighorn-Desert View Water Agency v. Verjil, 39 Cal. 4th 205 (July 2006).Bighorn-Desert View Water Agency v. Verjil, 39 Cal. 4th 205 (July 2006). The California Legislative Analyst's Office stated that, based on the actual constitutional language of the initiative power provision, the only limits appear to be those under federal law. However, the scope of the local initiative power under Proposition 218 has yet to be fully determined by the California Supreme Court.  Article XIII D ‚Äì Assessment and Property-Related Fee Reforms  Section 4 of Proposition 218 added Article XIII D to the California Constitution. Article XIII D relates primarily to special assessments on real property and property-related fees and charges. Section 1 of Article XIII D specifies that its provisions apply to all special assessments and property-related fees and charges irrespective of whether such levies are imposed pursuant to state statute or local charter authority.Cal. Const., art. XIII D, ¬ß 1. This makes it clear that Article XIII D applies to charter cities in California. Section 1 further specifies that nothing in Proposition 218 provides any new authority to any local government to impose any tax, special assessment, or property-related fee or charge. This means that the legal authority to impose a local tax, special assessment, or property-related fee or charge must come from an independent legal source such as a state statute or a local city charter provision. Section 1 also specifies two types of laws that are not affected by Proposition 218. First, existing laws relating to the imposition of fees or charges as a condition of property development (e.g., developer fees).Cal. Const., art. XIII D, ¬ß 1, subd. (b).616 Croft Ave., LLC v. City of West Hollywood, 3 Cal. App. 5th 621 (September 2016). Second, existing laws relating to the imposition of timber yield taxes.Cal. Const., art. XIII D, ¬ß 1, subd. (c). Under the express language of Proposition 218, the foregoing exceptions are limited to laws existing at the time Proposition 218 became law.  Constitutional Definitions  Section 2 of Article XIII D contains various definitions applicable to the article. A summary of the more significant definitions follows.  \\"Agency\\"  The term \\"agency\\" sets forth the public entities subject to the article. The term \\"agency\\" in Article XIII D incorporates the same broad definition of \\"local government\\" used in Article XIII C.Cal. Const., art. XIII D, ¬ß 2, subd. (a). As a result, if a public entity is a \\"local government\\" under Article XIII C it is also an \\"agency\\" under Article XIII D.  \\"Assessment\\"  The term \\"assessment\\" is defined as \\"any levy or charge upon real property by an agency for a special benefit conferred upon the real property.\\"Cal. Const., art. XIII D, ¬ß 2, subd. (b). If a levy or charge is an \\"assessment,\\" it is subject to the procedures and requirements applicable to assessments in Article XIII D.Cal. Const., art. XIII D, ¬ß 3, subd. (a), par. (3). The detailed procedures and requirements for \\"assessments\\" are contained in Section 4 of Article XIII D. Proposition 218 maintains the traditional requirement that a special assessment must specially benefit the assessed property. However, a key reform under Proposition 218 is that it significantly tightens what constitutes a \\"special benefit\\" for purposes of levying a lawful special assessment. = \\"Special Benefit\\" = A \\"special benefit\\" means \\"a particular and distinct benefit over and above general benefits conferred on real property locate in the district or to the public at large. General enhancement of property value does not constitute 'special benefit.'\\"Cal. Const., art. XIII D, ¬ß 2, subd. (i). The California Supreme Court unanimously confirmed and upheld the tighter \\"special benefit\\" definition in interpreting it to mean that a special benefit must affect an assessed property in a way that is particular and distinct from its effect on other parcels, and that real property in general and the public at large do not share.Silicon Valley Taxpayers' Association, Inc. v. Santa Clara County Open Space Authority, 44 Cal. 4th at page 452 (July 2008).  Property- Related Fee or Charge  Proposition 218 created a new type of fee or charge known as a property-related fee or charge. Whether a fee or charge is \\"property-related\\" is legally significant because if a fee or charge is \\"property-related,\\" it is subject to the procedures and requirements applicable to such levies in Article XIII D.Cal. Const., art. XIII D, ¬ß 3, subd. (a), par. (4). The detailed procedures and requirements for property- related fees or charges are contained in Section 6 of Article XIII D. A \\"property-related\\" fee or charge is \\"any levy other than an ad valorem tax, a special tax, or an assessment, imposed by an agency upon a parcel or upon a person as an incident of property ownership, including a user fee or charge for a property-related service.\\"Cal. Const., art. XIII D, ¬ß 2, subd. (e). A \\"property-related service\\" is defined as \\"a public service having a direct relationship to property ownership.\\"Cal. Const., art. XIII D, ¬ß 2, subd. (h). Initially, the California Supreme Court in 2001 narrowly interpreted what constitutes a \\"property-related\\" fee or charge in concluding that a residential rental inspection fee was not \\"property-related.\\"Apartment Association of Los Angeles County, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles, 24 Cal. 4th 830 (January 2001). In 2002, a California appellate court held that an in-lieu franchise fee for water, sewer, and refuse collection services was a \\"property-related\\" fee subject to Article XIII D.Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association v. City of Roseville, 97 Cal. App. 4th 637 (April 2002). Also in 2002, another California appellate court held that a stormwater drainage fee imposed on developed parcels was a \\"property-related\\" fee subject Article XIII D.Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association v. City of Salinas, 98 Cal. App. 4th 1351 (June 2002). In 2004, the California Supreme Court held that a fire suppression fee imposed as a condition for making a new connection to a water system was not a \\"property-related\\" fee because the fee was not imposed by virtue of property ownership, but instead was imposed as an incident of the voluntary act of the property owner in applying for a water service connection.Richmond v. Shasta Community Services District, 32 Cal.4th 409 (February 2004). In 2005, a California appellate court held that a fee in lieu of property taxes assessed upon municipal utility departments providing water, sewer, and solid waste collection services was a \\"property-related\\" fee.Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association v. City of Fresno, 127 Cal. App. 4th 914 (March 2005). In 2006, the California Supreme Court definitively held that a utility charge imposed by an agency for ongoing water delivery, including a consumption based utility charge, was a \\"property-related\\" fee. In reaching the preceding conclusion about consumption based utility charges, the court relied on the \\"user fee or charge for a property-related service\\" component of the constitutional definition. Based on the court's reasoning, fees and charges for ongoing sewer and refuse collection services are also \\"property- related.\\"Bighorn-Desert View Water Agency v. Verjil, 39 Cal. 4th at page 215 (July 2006). = Groundwater Fees = In 2017, the California Supreme Court held that a fee imposed upon persons on the extraction of groundwater was generally not a property-related fee. The 2017 California Supreme Court decision disapproved two previous Court of Appeal published decisionsPajaro Valley Water Management Agency v. Amrhein, 150 Cal. App. 4th 1364 (May 2007).Griffith v. Pajaro Valley Water Management Agency, 220 Cal. App. 4th 586 (October 2013). holding that a fee on the extraction of groundwater was a property-related fee under Proposition 218. This was the first time the California Supreme Court disapproved a published Court of Appeal decision with the resulting effect of taking away Proposition 218 constitutional rights and protections previously recognized by a California appellate court. Although fees imposed upon persons on the extraction of groundwater are generally no longer a property-related fee under Proposition 218, such levies may still be subject to local voter approval as a tax under Proposition 26 which California voters approved in 2010. However, groundwater fees imposed upon parcels of property may still be subject to the requirements of Proposition 218.Cal. Const., art. XIII D, ¬ß 2, subd. (e) [property-related fee imposed upon a parcel]; Cal. Const., art. XIII D, ¬ß 2, subd. (b) [assessment imposed upon a parcel for a special benefit conferred]. In addition, fees on the extraction of groundwater are generally subject to reduction or repeal using the local initiative power under Proposition 218, including the significantly reduced signature requirement thereunder. This gives local voters an available political remedy to compel an election regarding a groundwater fee approved by a local government. The local initiative power under Proposition 218 has been used before to repeal a local groundwater fee.North San Joaquin Water Conservation District v. Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, 2010 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 7197 (September 2010).  Proposition 218 Levy Limitations  Section 3 of Article XIII D specifies that no tax, assessment, or property- related fee or charge shall be assessed by any agency upon any parcel of property or upon any person as an incident of property ownership except: (1) constitutionally permitted property taxes based on the assessed value of the property; (2) special taxes receiving a two-thirds vote under Proposition 13; (3) assessments on real property as provided by Article XIII D; and (4) property-related fees or charges for property-related services as provided by Article XIII D.Cal. Const., art. XIII D, ¬ß 3, subd. (a). The preceding requirement generally means that all parcel taxes must be levied as special taxes subject to two-thirds voter approval. The preceding requirement also means that property-related fees or charges may only be imposed for property- related services. A tax imposed on the owners of wholesale liquid fuel storage facilities based solely on the storage capacity of the facilities' tanks, regardless of whether the tanks are used or any fuel is stored in them, was found by a California appellate court to be subject to the constitutional restrictions under Section 3 of Article XIII D.Tesoro Logistic Operations, LLC v. City of Rialto, 40 Cal. App. 5th 798 (October 2019). The courts have yet to fully determine what taxes (e.g., certain utility user taxes) are deemed imposed upon a \\"person as an incident of property ownership,\\" thereby requiring the tax to be a special tax subject to two-thirds voter approval.  Electrical or Gas Service Exemption Under Article XIII D  Section 3 of Article XIII D also contains an exemption that for purposes of Article XIII D, fees and charges for electrical or gas service are not property-related fees or charges imposed as an incident of property ownership.Cal. Const., art. XIII D, ¬ß 3, subd. (b). This means that electrical or gas service fees and charges imposed by local agencies are not subject to the proceduresCal. Const., art. XIII D, ¬ß 6, subd. (a). and requirementsCal. Const., art. XIII D, ¬ß 6, subd. (b). applicable to property-related fees or charges, including the proportional cost of service requirement.Cal. Const., art. XIII D, ¬ß 6, subd. (b), par. (3). The scope of the exemption for electrical or gas service fees and charges only applies to Article XIII D. Depending upon the specific circumstances, electrical or gas service fees and charges imposed by a local agency could constitute a \\"tax\\" subject to voter approval under Article XIII C, as amended by Proposition 26 in 2010. = Local Initiative Power to Reduce or Repeal Exempt Electrical or Gas Service Levies = Electrical or gas service fees and charges that are exempt under Article XIII D and imposed by a local public agency (but not a private entity) are generally subject to reduction or repeal using the local initiative power under Proposition 218, including the significantly reduced signature requirement thereunder. This provides local voters with a legislative remedy to address electrical or gas service utility fees and charges imposed by a local public agency that are considered excessive or unreasonable. As an example, the local initiative power under Proposition 218 could be used to reduce electrical service fees and charges in situations where a local public agency such as a city transfers substantial utility fee or charge revenues to the general fund of the local public agency, whether done as legally allowable \\"profit\\" or as reimbursement for questionable services rendered to the utility by the local public agency. Once transferred to the general fund of a local public agency, the utility revenue proceeds can generally be spent at the complete discretion of local politicians.  Assessments ‚Äì Procedures and Requirements  Section 4 of Article XIII D contains detailed procedures and requirements applicable to special benefit assessments on real property. The assessment procedures and requirements are designed to ensure that any special assessment levied by an agency is a legitimate special assessment. Proposition 218 also requires an agency to have a vote of the affected property owners (referred to as an assessment ballot proceeding) before any proposed new or increased assessment can be levied by an agency. Prior to Proposition 218, an agency was not required to obtain ballot approval from affected property owners before levying assessments on real property. The assessment process is formally initiated by the local agency. For some assessments, other laws (e.g., a state statute or a local law such as an ordinance or a local charter provision) may also legally require a property owner petition to initiate the assessment process, but a property owner petition is not required under Proposition 218.  Identification of Parcels Subject to Assessment  An agency that proposes to levy an assessment under Proposition 218 must first identify all parcels which will have a special benefit conferred upon them and upon which an assessment is proposed for imposition.Cal. Const., art. XIII D, ¬ß 4, subd. (a). The geographic area determined by an agency to contain all parcels of property which will have a special benefit conferred upon them is referred to as an assessment district.Cal. Const., art. XIII D, ¬ß 2, subd. (d). The proportionate special benefit derived by each identified parcel must be determined by the agency in relationship to the entirety of the capital costs of the public improvement(s) being financed, the maintenance and operation expenses of the public improvement(s), or the cost of the property-related service(s) being provided. Proposition 218 does not preclude assessments for public services, but under the applicable constitutional requirements only \\"property-related services\\" are generally assessable.  Engineer's Report  All assessments must be supported by a detailed engineer's report prepared by a registered professional engineer certified by the State of California.Cal. Const., art. XIII D, ¬ß 4, subd. (b). The required engineering report is ordinarily prepared by a registered civil engineer. The engineer's report is a critical document in the assessment process because it contains the detailed supporting basis for levying the assessment. This includes a detailed supporting basis for compliance with the substantive requirements for assessments such as presence of special benefits, proper apportionment of special benefits between parcels, separability of general benefits from special benefits, proper assessment of parcels owned by public agencies, detailed cost information, and the manner of calculating assessments upon specific parcels. In a legal challenge concerning the validity of an assessment, the courts typically refer to the engineer's report to determine whether the assessment complies with Proposition 218. Proposition 218 does not require the engineer's report be mailed to property owners as part of the assessment notification process. However, the engineer's report is a public record whereby a member of the public, including property owners subject to a proposed assessment, may make a written request and receive a copy of an engineer's report under the California Public Records Act. The engineer's report is also sometimes available in electronic format where it can be downloaded by the public. However, Proposition 218 does not require an engineer's report be made available in an electronic format. The California Public Records Act generally requires that public records in an electronic format be made available when requested by a member of the public.Cal. Gov. Code, ¬ß 6253.9.  Electronic Data Files  Electronic data files containing information relating to the calculation and/or amount of a proposed assessment for each parcel within an assessment district may also be available. Some assessment districts may contain many thousands of parcels, and sometimes the assessment calculations for each parcel are only available as an electronic data file. These data files are generally public records subject to disclosure under the California Public Records Act. The data files must also generally be made available in the electronic format requested by the public if the requested format is one that has been used by the agency to create copies for its own use or for provision to other public agencies.Cal. Gov. Code, ¬ß 6253.9, subd. (a). The foregoing requirement is important to facilitate independent analysis of electronic data files by the public for purposes of verifying Proposition 218 compliance. Related electronic data files may also be used to help verify Proposition 218 compliance. In particular, use of geographic information system (GIS) data files. GIS data files containing location-based information relating to a proposed assessment for each parcel within an assessment district may also be available. In addition, separate GIS data files may have also been used as part of the assessment calculation process such as GIS data files containing the location and attributes of streetlights and parcels within an assessment district. GIS data files may also be used in connection with the calculation of property- related fees and charges under Proposition 218 such as utility or stormwater fees. The California Supreme Court has ruled that GIS database files are generally deemed public records subject to disclosure under the California Public Records Act.Sierra Club v. Superior Court, 57 Cal. 4th 157 (July 2013).  Special Benefit and Proportionality Requirements  Under Proposition 218, only special benefits are assessable. Proposition 218 contains its own constitutional definition of \\"special benefit\\" that significantly tightens the kind of special assessments an agency can levy on real property.Silicon Valley Taxpayers' Association, Inc. v. Santa Clara County Open Space Authority, 44 Cal. 4th at page 438 (July 2008). Some special assessments that may have been permissible prior to Proposition 218 are no longer legally permissible because of a lack of \\"special benefit\\" under the tightened definition.  Separating General Benefits From Special Benefits  Proposition 218 also requires an agency to separate the general benefits from the special benefits conferred on a parcel. Pre-Proposition 218 case law did not invalidate assessments because they also provided general benefits in addition to special benefits, and the courts did not demand a strict separation of general benefits from special benefits.Silicon Valley Taxpayers' Association, Inc. v. Santa Clara County Open Space Authority, 44 Cal. 4th at page 451 (July 2008). The benefit separation requirement under Proposition 218 helps ensure compliance with the requirement that only special benefits are assessable. Since general benefits are not assessable, they must be excluded and financed using revenue sources other than assessments (e.g., from taxes). The \\"assessment\\" definition refers to a levy on real property for a \\"special benefit\\" conferred upon the real property. Since permissible assessments are limited to special benefits conferred upon real property, in addition to separating the general benefits conferred on a parcel, benefits to persons or to personal property must also be excluded from assessment. As a practical matter, this makes it much more difficult to legally justify the imposition of special assessments for public improvements or services that primarily benefit people instead of real property.  Proportionality Requirement  Under Proposition 218, no assessment may be imposed on any parcel which exceeds the reasonable cost of the proportional special benefit conferred on that parcel. The proportionality requirement ensures that the aggregate assessment imposed on all parcels is distributed among all assessed parcels in proportion to the special benefits conferred on each parcel.Beutz v. County of Riverside, 184 Cal. App. 4th at page 1522 (May 2010). An agency may provide a discounted assessment less than the reasonable cost of the proportional special benefit conferred so long as any discounts do not cause the assessments imposed on the remaining parcels in the assessment district to exceed the reasonable cost of the proportional special benefit conferred on those parcels.Dahms v. Downtown Pomona Property & Business Improvement District, 174 Cal. App. 4th at page 716 (May 2009), Decision on Remand from California Supreme Court.  Public Parcels Also Subject to Assessment  Proposition 218 provides that parcels within an assessment district that are owned or used by any local agency, the State of California, or the United States are not exempt from assessment unless the agency can demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the publicly owned parcels receive no special benefit. This requirement has been confirmed and upheld by a California appellate court.Manteca Unified School District v. Reclamation District No. 17, 10 Cal. App. 5th 730 (April 2017). Historically, publicly owned parcels were exempt from paying assessments on real property. The courts construed an implied exemption for special assessments under the provision of the California ConstitutionCal. Const., art. XIII, ¬ß 3, subd. (b). exempting local governments from property taxation.San Marcos Water District v. San Marcos Unified School District, 42 Cal. 3d 154 (July 1986). The practical effect of the historical exemption was to require private property owners, in addition to paying an assessment share attributable to their own parcel, to also pay the share of assessments that would otherwise be attributable to publicly owned parcels. While elimination of the assessment exemption applies to all levels of government, there may be instances where federally owned property, due to restrictions under federal law which Proposition 218 cannot legally override, will continue to be exempt from assessments. To the extent any exemption for federal property exists under federal law, Proposition 218 prohibits an agency from shifting the assessment burden from federally exempt parcels to other parcels within an assessment district.  Written Notice Requirement  Once an agency has identified the parcels subject to assessment, the agency must then calculate the amount of the proposed assessment for each identified parcel and must give the record owner of each identified parcel written notice by mail of the proposed assessment. The required written notice must state the total assessment amount chargeable to the entire assessment district, the amount chargeable to the record owner's particular parcel, the duration of the assessment payments, the reason(s) for the assessment and the basis upon which the amount of the proposed assessment was calculated, together with the date, time, and location of a public hearing on the proposed assessment.Cal. Const., art. XIII D, ¬ß 4, subd. (c). The required notice must also include, in a conspicuous place on the notice, a summary of the procedures applicable to the completion, return, and tabulation of the assessment ballots required under Proposition 218, including a disclosure statement that the assessment will not be imposed if the ballots submitted in opposition to the assessment exceed the ballots submitted in favor of the assessment, with the ballots weighted according to the proportional financial obligation of the each affected property.Cal. Gov. Code, ¬ß 53753, subd. (b). Some property owners may not realize the importance of the written notice and assessment ballot and end up throwing away the mailing thinking it is junk mail. To help address this matter, the California Legislature enacted additional requirements relating to the envelope containing the assessment notice and ballot. On the face of each envelope mailed to the record owner in which the required notice and assessment ballot are enclosed, there must appear in substantially the following form the phrase \\"OFFICIAL BALLOT ENCLOSED\\" in no smaller than 16-point bold type. A local agency may additionally place the phrase \\"OFFICIAL BALLOT ENCLOSED\\" on the face of the envelope in a language or languages other than English.  Inclusion of Assessment Ballot  Every notice mailed to owners of identified parcels within an assessment district must also contain an assessment ballot which includes the agency's address for receipt of the assessment ballot once completed by any record owner receiving the notice whereby the record owner may indicate his or her name, reasonable identification of the parcel owned, and his or her support or opposition to the proposed assessment.Cal. Const., art. XIII D, ¬ß 4, subd. (d). The California Legislature has enacted additional requirements relating to the completion and delivery of assessment ballots. While not required by Proposition 218, these additional statutory requirements must be followed for an assessment ballot to be counted. An assessment ballot must be signed and either mailed or otherwise delivered to the address indicated on the assessment ballot. Regardless of the method of delivery, all assessment ballots must be received at the address indicated, or the location of the public testimony, in order to be included in the tabulation of a majority protest.Cal. Gov. Code, ¬ß 53753, subd. (c). An assessment ballot may be submitted, changed, or withdrawn by the person who submitted the ballot prior to the conclusion of the public testimony on the proposed assessment at the required public hearing.  Public Hearing Requirement  The agency must conduct at least one public hearing upon the proposed assessment not less than 45 days after mailing the notice of the proposed assessment to the record owners of each identified parcel subject to the proposed assessment.Cal. Const., art. XIII D, ¬ß 4, subd. (e). At the public hearing, any person is permitted to present written or oral testimony to the agency. The public hearing may also be continued from time to time.Cal. Gov. Code, ¬ß 53753, subd. (d).  Assessment Ballot Tabulation; Weighted Ballots  At the public hearing, the agency must consider all protests against the proposed assessment. At the conclusion of the public hearing, an impartial person designated by the agency who does not have a vested interest in the outcome of the proposed assessment must tabulate the assessment ballots.Cal. Gov. Code, ¬ß 53753, subd. (e), par. (1). The governing body of the agency may, if necessary, continue the assessment ballot tabulation at a different time or location accessible to the public, provided the governing body announces the time and location at the public hearing. The impartial person may use technological methods of tabulating the assessment ballots, including, but not limited to, punchcard or optically readable (bar-coded) assessment ballots.Cal. Gov. Code, ¬ß 53753, subd. (e), par. (2). In tabulating the assessment ballots, the ballots must be weighted according to the proportional financial obligation of the affected parcel. If more than one of the record owners of an identified parcel submits an assessment ballot, the amount of the proposed assessment to be imposed upon the identified parcel must be allocated to each ballot submitted in proportion to the respective record ownership interests or, if the ownership interests are not shown on the record, as established to the satisfaction of the agency by documentation provided by those record owners.Cal. Gov. Code, ¬ß 53753, subd. (e), par. (3). The assessment ballot process under Proposition 218 is frequently referred to as an \\"assessment ballot proceeding\\" and is not technically regarded as an election.Cal. Elec. Code, ¬ß 4000, subd. (c), par. (8). The weighted assessment ballot requirement under Proposition 218 is not new. Neither is the requirement that the assessment ballot process be limited to property owners. Prior to Proposition 218, the majority protest process was limited to property owners subject to a proposed assessment. For a small number of assessments, a property owner election with weighted voting was required. The constitutionality of these property owner elections has previously been upheld by the California Supreme Court.Southern California Rapid Transit District v. Bolen, 1 Cal. 4th 654 (January 1992). = Secrecy of Assessment Ballots = Proposition 218 does not directly address issues associated with the secrecy of assessment ballots. However, these issues have been addressed by statutes adopted by the California Legislature. An assessment ballot must be in a form that conceals its contents once it is sealed by the person submitting the assessment ballot, and must remain sealed until the tabulation of assessment ballots starts. Assessment ballots must be unsealed and tabulated in public view at the conclusion of the required public hearing so as to permit all interested persons to meaningfully monitor the accuracy of the ballot tabulation process. During and after the ballot tabulation, assessment ballots and the information used to determine the weight of each assessment ballot are disclosable public records under the California Public Records Act, and must be made equally available for inspection by the proponents and the opponents of the proposed assessment. Assessment ballots must be preserved for a minimum of two years, after which they may be destroyed as provided by law. The California Supreme Court has ruled that voting secrecy protections under the California ConstitutionCal. Const., art. II, ¬ß 7. do not apply to assessment ballot proceedings under Proposition 218.Greene v. Marin County Flood Control & Water Conservation District, 49 Cal. 4th 277 (June 2010). To the extent any secrecy protections exist for assessment ballots, they are generally derived from state statutes or local laws. Prior to Proposition 218, assessment protests by property owners were generally treated as public records subject to disclosure under the California Public Records Act. Proposition 218 did not alter the public record status of assessment protests by property owners.  Majority Protest for Assessments  An agency may not impose a proposed assessment if there is a majority protest. A majority protest exists if, upon the conclusion of the required public hearing, assessment ballots submitted in opposition to the proposed assessment exceed the assessment ballots submitted in favor of the proposed assessment. The assessment ballots are weighted by the amount of the proposed assessment to be imposed upon the identified parcel for which each assessment ballot was submitted.Cal. Gov. Code, ¬ß 53753, subd. (e), par. (4). Proposition 218 continues the concept of a majority protest for assessments. However, prior to Proposition 218, a majority protest typically required an absolute majority of property owners (often using a weighted formula) to protest against a proposed assessment. No assessment ballot was involved. If a property owner did not affirmatively protest an assessment (i.e., if a property owner did nothing), that effectively counted as a vote in support of the proposed assessment. This contributed to the inequity of the assessment process prior to the passage of Proposition 218. Also prior to Proposition 218, even if an absolute majority of property owners protested an assessment and a majority protest existed, state laws often allowed local agencies to overrule a majority protest by a specified supermajority vote requirement (typically by a four-fifths vote) of the governing body of the local agency. What this meant in practical terms for a typical five-member governing body was that it would take at least three votes to approve an assessment in the absence of a majority protest and at least four votes would be required to overrule a majority protest. Prior to Proposition 218, sustained majority protests for assessments were rare events. One of the most significant assessment reforms under Proposition 218 is how a majority protest is determined. Rather than being based on an absolute majority, as was the case prior to Proposition 218, a majority protest is now determined based on the assessment ballots actually received by the local agency. If a property owner does not properly return an assessment ballot, that fact will not count for or against the proposed assessment. Proposition 218 also does not allow an agency to overrule a majority protest. If a majority protest exists under Proposition 218, the agency is constitutionally prohibited from imposing the proposed assessment.  Validity of Assessment Ballot Process Under Proposition 218  The validity of the assessment ballot process under Proposition 218 was upheld by a California appellate court in 2002.Not About Water Committee v. Solano County Board of Supervisors, 95 Cal. App. 4th 982 (January 2002). Property owner elections with weighted voting do not violate the federal constitutional requirement of \\"one man, one vote\\" under the limited circumstances of a special-purpose unit of government assigned the performance of functions affecting definable groups of constituents more than others. Such is the case with assessment districts under Proposition 218. Furthermore, since only special benefits are assessable under Proposition 218, voters residing within the boundaries of an assessment district who do not own property within the assessment district are also not deemed under the California Constitution to have been deprived of the right to vote for any assessment.Cal. Const., art. XIII D, ¬ß 4, subd. (g). = Federal Law Invalidity Provision = Proposition 218 contains a special additional requirement in the event a court determines the assessment ballot process violates federal law. If any such violation were to occur, an assessment may not be levied under Proposition 218 unless approved by a two-thirds vote of the electorate in the assessment district. The practical effect of the federal law invalidity provision is that if the assessment ballot process were invalidated under federal law, the approval requirements for assessments under Proposition 218 would become even more restrictive than if either no legal challenge under federal law had occurred or if any such legal challenge were unsuccessful. This provides a strong disincentive to legally challenge the assessment ballot process under Proposition 218. However, the assessment ballot process under Proposition 218 has been found by a California appellate court to not violate applicable federal law.  Local Agency Burden to Demonstrate Compliance  Prior to Proposition 218, a person challenging an assessment had the burden to prove that the assessment was not legal.Ballot Pamphlet, California General Election (November 5, 1996), analysis of Proposition 218 by Legislative Analyst, p. 74. An important reform under Proposition 218 is that it shifted the burden of demonstrating compliance to the local agency in a lawsuit challenging an assessment. In any legal action contesting the validity of an assessment, the burden is on the local agency to demonstrate that the properties in question receive a special benefit over and above the benefits conferred on the public at large and that the amount of any contested assessment is proportional to, and no greater than, the benefits conferred on the properties in question.Cal. Const., art. XIII D, ¬ß 4, subd. (f). This change makes it significantly easier for taxpayers to win a legal challenge.  The Landmark 2008 Silicon Valley Taxpayers Supreme Court Case  The detailed and substantive assessment reforms contained in Proposition 218 were unanimously confirmed and upheld by the California Supreme Court in Silicon Valley Taxpayers' Association, Inc. v. Santa Clara County Open Space Authority, 44 Cal. 4th 431 (July 2008).Silicon Valley Taxpayers' Association, Inc. v. Santa Clara County Open Space Authority, 44 Cal. 4th 431 (July 2008). The Silicon Valley Taxpayers case is also one of the most important and significant taxpayer protection cases in a generation (and is listed as one of the most important and influential decisions in the history of the California Supreme Court) in large part because of the California Supreme Court holding on the standard of review issue. The standard of review issue addresses the level of deference a court will ordinarily give a local agency in reviewing its legislative actions such as the approval of an assessment. The extent of deference given by the courts has a major bearing on the outcome of a lawsuit. Before Proposition 218 became law, in a legal challenge involving an assessment the courts reviewed the actions of the local agency under a highly deferential standard of review. Under this highly deferential standard of review, the courts presumed that an assessment was valid and the person challenging the assessment had to show that the record before the local agency clearly did not support the underlying determinations of special benefit and proportionality.Silicon Valley Taxpayers' Association, Inc. v. Santa Clara County Open Space Authority, 44 Cal. 4th at page 444 (July 2008). The underlying legal basis for the historical deferential standard of review was that the establishment of an assessment district takes place as a result of a peculiarly legislative process.Knox v. City of Orland, 4 Cal. 4th at page 146 (December 1992). As a result, the constitutional separation of powers doctrine demanded a more deferential standard of review by the courts.Silicon Valley Taxpayers' Association, Inc. v. Santa Clara County Open Space Authority, 44 Cal. 4th at page 448 (July 2008). Property owners rarely won assessment lawsuits on the merits prior to Proposition 218. Because it was so difficult to win a legal challenge, lawyers were candidly urged not to bother even trying to challenge an assessment in court. The constitutional status of the substantive assessment requirements under Proposition 218 altered the standard of review analysis. The substantive requirements for assessments are contained in constitutional provisions of dignity at least equal to the constitutional separation of powers provision. Prior to Proposition 218, special assessment laws were generally statutory, and the constitutional separation of powers doctrine served as a foundation for a more deferential standard of review by the courts. However, after Proposition 218 became law, an assessment's validity is now a constitutional question. Relying on various provisions of Proposition 218, including the burden of demonstration provision applicable to assessments, as well as language in the Proposition 218 ballot pamphlet, the California Supreme Court concluded that because Proposition 218's underlying purpose was to limit government's power to exact revenue and to curtail the deference that had been traditionally accorded legislative enactments on fees, assessments, and charges, a more rigorous standard of review was warranted. The separation of powers doctrine no longer justified allowing a local agency to usurp the judicial function of interpreting and applying the constitutional provisions that govern assessments under Proposition 218.Silicon Valley Taxpayers' Association, Inc. v. Santa Clara County Open Space Authority, 44 Cal. 4th at page 449 (July 2008). Under the new standard adopted by the California Supreme Court in the Silicon Valley Taxpayers case, California courts must exercise their independent judgment in reviewing whether an assessment imposed by a local agency violates the constitutional provisions of Proposition 218.Silicon Valley Taxpayers' Association, Inc. v. Santa Clara County Open Space Authority, 44 Cal. 4th at page 450 (July 2008). This new standard makes it significantly easier for taxpayers to win lawsuits challenging the validity of assessments under Proposition 218.Silicon Valley Taxpayers' Association, Inc. v. Santa Clara County Open Space Authority, 44 Cal. 4th at page 445 (July 2008). The California Supreme Court in the Silicon Valley Taxpayers case also stated that with respect to Proposition 218 all legislation must be subordinate to the constitutional provision, and in furtherance of its purpose, and must not in any particular attempt to narrow or embarrass the measure. As a result, when government, whether state or local, acts in a legislative capacity it has no authority to exercise its discretion in a way that violates Proposition 218 or undermines its effect. Thus, even the California Legislature cannot enact statutes that narrow or undermine the constitutional protections under Proposition 218. Appellate counsel who represented the interests of taxpayers and Proposition 218 before the California Supreme Court in the landmark Silicon Valley Taxpayers case included Tony Tanke, Jack Cohen, and James Burling.Silicon Valley Taxpayers' Association, Inc. v. Santa Clara County Open Space Authority, 44 Cal. 4th at pages 435‚Äì436 (July 2008). The successful equal dignity argument applicable to the standard of review issue in the Silicon Valley Taxpayers case was developed by constitutional attorney Jack Cohen.Silicon Valley Taxpayers' Association, Inc. v. Santa Clara County Open Space Authority, 2006 CA S. Ct. Briefs LEXIS 1468 (July 31, 2006).  Changed Legal Environment Following Silicon Valley Taxpayers Case  The Silicon Valley Taxpayers case profoundly changed the legal environment in California as it relates to constitutional taxpayer protections. As a California Law Review article noted following the Silicon Valley Taxpayers decision: \\"[T]he California Supreme Court's opinion in Silicon Valley elevates fiscal limitations to the same level as core California constitutional issues.\\" This represented a watershed change in judicial interpretation compared to the historical interpretation of constitutional taxpayer protections in California, especially under Proposition 13, that generally resulted in a narrow construction of constitutional taxpayer protections to limit their scope, application, and impact.City and County of San Francisco v. Farrell, 32 Cal. 3d 47 (August 1982).  Local Initiative Power to Reduce or Repeal Approved Assessments  After approval of an assessment, the local initiative power under Proposition 218 can generally be used to reduce or repeal that assessment. This includes the significantly reduced signature requirement thereunder. An example where such an initiative may be appropriate involves inequities that occasionally occur from the weighted ballot requirement for assessments, particularly in assessment districts containing a large number of publicly owned parcels. An assessment district consisting of residential parcels paying lower assessments and a significant number of larger parcels paying higher assessments, such as large publicly owned or commercial parcels, can sometimes result in an assessment being approved under weighted voting even though a majority of the residential property owners opposed the assessment. A local initiative to reduce or repeal the assessment is an available remedy to address such an inequity. Should an assessment reduction or repeal initiative qualify for the ballot, the election would be by the registered voters and the ballots would not be weighted.  Article Effective Date; Assessment Exemptions  Section 5 of Article XIII D sets forth the effective date of the article. Section 5 also includes four exemptions from the assessment procedures and approval process contained in Section 4 of Article XIII D. Section 5 states that Article XIII D was effective the day after the election (November 6, 1996 effective date) unless otherwise provided.Cal. Const., art. XIII D, ¬ß 5. Section 5 further states that beginning July 1, 1997, all existing, new, or increased assessments must comply with Article XIII D. However, Section 5 specifies that four classes of assessments existing on the effective date of Article XIII D (November 6, 1996) are exempt from the procedures and approval process contained in that article.  Assessment Exemptions  The first exemption is for any assessment imposed exclusively to finance the capital costs or maintenance and operation expenses for sidewalks, streets, sewers, water, flood control, drainage systems, or vector control.Cal. Const., art. XIII D, ¬ß 5, subd. (a). This specific exemption is often referred to as the \\"traditional purpose\\" exemption, and was intended to allow traditionally appropriate, nonabusive assessments.Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association v. City of Riverside, 73 Cal. App. 4th 679 (July 1999). Technically, if an existing assessment is not imposed exclusively for an enumerated traditional purpose, it does not qualify for the exemption. Any subsequent increases in a traditional purpose assessment must comply with the procedures and approval process contained in Section 4 of Article XIII D. The traditional purpose exemption applicable to special assessments is broader in scope than the narrower election exemptions applicable to property-related fees and charges which only apply to fees and charges for water, sewer, or refuse collection services.Cal. Const., art. XIII D, ¬ß 6, subd. (c). The second exemption is for any assessment imposed pursuant to a petition signed by the person(s) owning all of the parcels subject to the assessment at the time the assessment was initially imposed.Cal. Const., art. XIII D, ¬ß 5, subd. (b). This exemption typically involves circumstances where a developer approved one or more assessments as a condition for developing property. Any subsequent increases in a petition exempt assessment must comply with the procedures and approval process contained in Section 4 of Article XIII D. The third exemption is for any assessment the proceeds of which are used to repay bonded indebtedness of which the failure to pay would violate the United States Constitution.Cal. Const., art. XIII D, ¬ß 5, subd. (c). The exemption only applies to the extent that the Contract Impairment Clause of the United States ConstitutionU.S. Const., art. I, ¬ß 10, cl. 1. is violated. The fourth exemption is for any assessment which previously received majority voter approval from the voters voting in an election on the issue of the assessment.Cal. Const., art. XIII D, ¬ß 5, subd. (d). Prior to Proposition 218, voter approval of an assessment was generally not required, but a local agency could voluntarily decide to hold an election on the approval of an assessment. Technically, to qualify for the exemption the election had to be legally binding and not advisory in nature. Any subsequent increases in a prior voter approval exempt assessment must comply with the procedures and approval process contained in Section 4 of Article XIII D. = When Assessments Deemed \\"Increased\\" = When an agency \\"increases\\" an assessment, compliance with the assessment process under Proposition 218 is required and the exemptions generally do not apply to the increased assessment. The California Legislature adopted a statute interpreting the term \\"increase\\" as applied to assessments. However, the courts have final say in interpreting when an assessment is \\"increased\\" under Proposition 218. Under the applicable statutory provisions, an assessment is deemed \\"increased\\" for purposes of Proposition 218 when a local agency makes a decision that does any of the following: (1) increases any applicable rate used to calculate the assessment; or (2) revises the methodology by which the assessment is calculated, if that revision results in an increased amount being levied on any parcel. An assessment is not \\"increased\\" in the case in which the actual payments from a parcel are higher than would have resulted when the agency approved the assessment, if those higher payments are attributable to events other than an increased assessment rate or revised methodology, such as a change in the density, intensity, or nature of the use of land.  Local Initiative Power to Reduce or Repeal Exempt Assessments  Although assessments exempt under Section 5 are not subject to the assessment approval process contained in Article XIII D, the local initiative power under Proposition 218, including the significantly reduced signature requirement thereunder, can generally be used to reduce or repeal an exempt assessment since that power expressly applies to assessments. The only exception would likely be for the bonded indebtedness exemption where a violation of the Contract Impairment Clause of the United States Constitution would occur if the local initiative power under Proposition 218 were exercised to reduce or repeal an assessment subject to that particular exemption.  Property-Related Fees and Charges ‚Äì Procedures and Requirements  Section 6 of Article XIII D contains the detailed procedures and requirements applicable to property-related fees and charges. These procedures and requirements are designed to ensure that any property-related fee or charge levied by a local agency is a legitimate fee or charge and not an unlawful tax imposed without voter approval. The property-related fee and charge provisions only apply if a fee or charge is \\"property-related\\" under the definition contained in Proposition 218. Some property-related fees or charges are levied upon parcels and appear on the annual property tax bill sent to property owners while other property-related fees or charges are levied upon persons and may be paid by a tenant instead of the property owner.Detailed information about the Proposition 218 definition of a \\"property-related\\" fee or charge can be found in the Article XIII D \\"Constitutional Definitions\\" section of this article. If a fee or charge is not \\"property-related\\" under Proposition 218, it may be subject to voter approval as a \\"tax\\" under Proposition 26 which California voters approved in 2010. Proposition 26 amended Proposition 218 by adding a broad constitutional definition of a \\"tax\\" for purposes of determining the scope of levies subject to the voter approval requirement for local taxes under Proposition 218. Property-related fees or charges may only be levied for \\"property-related services.\\" A \\"property-related service\\" is a public service having a direct relationship to property ownership. Some of the more common property-related fees or charges levied by local agencies include utility fees for ongoing domestic water, sanitary sewer, refuse collection services, stormwater fees, and flood control fees. Groundwater augmentation fees imposed upon persons are generally no longer deemed property-related fees or charges but rather are subject to protections under Proposition 26.  Triggering Events for Property-Related Fee or Charge Provisions  The type of property- related service involved as well as whether the property-related fee or charge is new, increased, or already existing determines to what extent a levy is subject to the various procedures and requirements contained in Section 6 of Article XIII D, including whether an election is required. Starting July 1, 1997, all property-related fees or charges must comply with Section 6 of Article XIII D.Cal. Const., art. XIII D, ¬ß 6, subd. (d).  When Property- Related Fees or Charges Deemed \\"Increased\\"  When an agency \\"increases\\" a property-related fee or charge, compliance with the property-related fee or charge process under Proposition 218 is required. The California Legislature adopted a statute interpreting the term \\"increase\\" as applied to property- related fees or charges. However, the courts have final say in interpreting when a property-related fee or charge is \\"increased\\" under Proposition 218. A property-related fee or charge is \\"increased\\" for purposes of Proposition 218 when an agency makes a decision that does any of the following: (1) increases any applicable rate used to calculate the property-related fee or charge; or (2) revises the methodology by which the property-related fee or charge is calculated, if that revision results in an increased amount being levied on any person or parcel of property. A property-related fee or charge is not \\"increased\\" for purposes of Proposition 218 when an agency does either or both of the following: (1) adjusts the amount of a property-related fee or charge in accordance with a schedule of adjustments, including a clearly defined formula for inflation adjustment that was adopted by the agency prior to November 6, 1996; or (2) implements or collects a previously approved property-related fee or charge so long as the fee or charge rate is not increased beyond the level previously approved by the agency, and the methodology previously approved by the agency is not revised so as to result in an increase in the amount being levied on any person or parcel of property. A property-related fee or charge is not \\"increased\\" for purposes of Proposition 218 in the case in which the actual payments from a person or a parcel of property are higher than would have resulted when the agency approved the property-related fee or charge, if those higher payments are attributable to events other than an increased fee or charge rate or revised methodology, such as a change in the density, intensity, or nature of the use of land.  When Property-Related Fees or Charges Deemed \\"Extended\\"  When an agency \\"extends\\" a property-related fee or charge, compliance with the property-related fee or charge process under Proposition 218 is required. The California Legislature adopted a statute interpreting the term \\"extended\\" for purposes of the property-related fee or charge provisions of Proposition 218. However, the courts have final say in interpreting when a property-related fee or charge is \\"extended\\" under Proposition 218. A property-related fee or charge is \\"extended\\" for purposes of Proposition 218 when, as applied to an existing property-related fee or charge, an agency extends the stated effective period for the property-related fee or charge, including, but not limited to, amendment or removal of a sunset provision or expiration date. While expanding the geographic area subject to a property-related fee or charge may not constitute an \\"extension\\" under the statutory definition, it may constitute a property-related fee or charge \\"increase\\" and thereby subject the levy to the property-related fee or charge process under Proposition 218 on that basis.  Procedures for New or Increased Property-Related Fees or Charges  Subdivision (a) of Section 6 of Article XIII D sets forth the procedures an agency must follow for any new or increased property-related fee or charge. The procedures for a new or increased property-related fee or charge help ensure that a property owner receives appropriate written notice and is given an opportunity to provide input prior to the local agency deciding whether to approve a proposed property-related fee or charge.  Written Notice Requirement  The parcels upon which a new or increased property-related fee or charge is proposed for imposition must be identified by the agency. The amount or rate of the property-related fee or charge proposed for imposition upon each identified parcel must also be calculated by the agency. The agency must provide written notice by mail of the proposed property-related fee or charge to the record owner of each identified parcel upon which the property-related fee or charge is proposed for imposition. The written notice must include the amount or rate of the property-related fee or charge proposed upon each parcel, the basis upon which the amount or rate of the proposed property-related fee or charge was calculated, the reason(s) for the property-related fee or charge, together with the date, time and location of at least one public hearing on the proposed property-related fee or charge.Cal. Const., art. XIII D, ¬ß 6, subd. (a), par. (1). The required notice may be given by including it in the agency's regular billing statement for the property-related fee or charge, or by any other mailing by the agency to the address to which the agency customarily mails the billing statement for the property-related fee or charge.Cal. Gov. Code, ¬ß 53755, subd. (a), par. (1). However, if the agency desires to preserve any authority it may have to record or enforce a lien on the parcel to which a property-related service is provided, the agency must also mail notice to the record owner's address shown on the last equalized assessment roll if that address is different than the billing or service address.Cal. Gov. Code, ¬ß 53755, subd. (a), par. (3).  Public Hearing Requirement  The agency must conduct at least one public hearing upon the proposed property-related fee or charge not less than 45 days after mailing the notice of the proposed property-related fee or charge to the record owner(s) of each identified parcel upon which the property-related fee or charge is proposed for imposition.Cal. Const., art. XIII D, ¬ß 6, subd. (a), par. (2).  Majority Protest for Property-Related Fees and Charges  Proposition 218 allows record owners of each identified parcel upon which the property-related fee or charge is proposed to formally protest the proposed levy. At the required public hearing, the agency must consider all protests against the proposed property-related fee or charge. Only one written protest per parcel, filed by an owner or tenant of the parcel, may be counted in calculating a majority protest to a proposed new or increased property-related fee or charge.Cal. Gov. Code, ¬ß 53755, subd. (b). If written protests against the proposed property-related fee or charge are presented by a majority of owners of the identified parcels, the agency is prohibited from imposing the property-related fee or charge. Failure to comply with any legal requirement, including any applicable statutory requirements, can result in the invalidation of the protest document for purposes of determining whether a majority protest exists. The majority protest provision for property-related fees and charges requires an absolute majority of the owners of the identified parcels to protest against a proposed property-related fee or charge to legally preclude imposition of the levy. If a majority protest for a proposed property-related fee or charge is attained, the agency cannot legally override the majority protest. As a result of the absolute majority requirement, majority protests for proposed property-related fees and charges occasionally occur but not that often. They are most likely to occur in situations where the proposed levy is controversial and the number of affected parcels is small. Where the number of affected parcels is large, a majority protest is very difficult to attain even for controversial levies. Proposition 218 does not require that a protest document for a proposed property-related fee or charge be included with the required written notice. However, some agencies may include a protest document with the required notice as a courtesy. Written protests are often submitted by property owners in letter form. Protest documents are generally treated as public records subject to public disclosure under the California Public Records Act.Cal. Gov. Code, ¬ß 6253. Effective January 1, 2017, written protests must be preserved by the agency for a minimum of two years following the date of the public hearing to consider written protests.Cal. Gov. Code, ¬ß 53755, subd. (d).  Local Initiative Power to Reduce or Repeal Agency Approved Property-Related Levies  Sometimes a proposed property-related fee or charge may be controversial and/or have significant opposition but not enough opposition to attain a majority protest. The lack of a majority protest does not legally obligate an agency to levy the property-related fee or charge. Occasionally, the governing body of an agency may be responsive to the objections and protests by the public concerning a proposed property-related fee or charge. Responses may take the form of not levying the property-related fee or charge or modifying the property-related fee or charge to make it more acceptable to the public. However, in situations where the governing body of an agency is not responsive to the objections and protests by the public and approves a controversial property-related fee or charge, the local initiative power under Proposition 218 can generally be used to reduce or repeal the property-related fee or charge. This includes the significantly reduced signature requirement thereunder. An example application is an initiative to reduce or repeal water fee or charge increases resulting from customers conserving water under drought conditions.  Political Accountability For Approving Controversial Property-Related Levies  The approval of any property-related fee or charge under Proposition 218 is a political decision generally made by locally elected officials. As a result, any approval, especially if there is significant public controversy concerning the approval, is a political matter for which those locally elected officials approving the property-related fee or charge can be held politically accountable during the next election for members of the governing body of the local agency. = Use of Recall Power = In extraordinary circumstances, especially when there is great hostility by local politicians in any matter relating to the approval of a property- related fee or charge (or any other levy subject to the requirements of Proposition 218), exercise of the local recall power is also generally an available option to local voters. The California Secretary of State has released a publication on the procedures for recalling elected officials in California.  Applicability to Tenancies of Real Property  For purposes of the property-related fee and charge provisions of Proposition 218, \\"property ownership\\" includes tenancies of real property where tenants are directly liable to pay the property-related fee or charge in question.Cal. Const., art. XIII D, ¬ß 2, subd. (g). This means that if a tenant is directly liable to pay a property-related fee or charge, that tenant is also regarded as a \\"property owner\\" for purposes of the procedures and requirements applicable to property-related fees and charges, including entitlement to notice and the right to protest.  Requirements for Existing, New, or Increased Property-Related Fees and Charges  Proposition 218 includes five requirements that every property-related fee or charge must satisfy. An agency may not extend, impose or increase any property-related fee or charge unless it meets all five requirements. The five requirements help ensure that any property-related fee or charge is a legitimate fee or charge and not a tax masquerading as a fee or charge. All property-related fees and charges are subject to and must comply with the five requirements. Property-related fees or charges existing when Proposition 218 became effective must be in compliance by July 1, 1997. If a property-related fee or charge is prohibited under any of the five requirements, Proposition 218 does not prohibit that levy from being structured and imposed as a tax so long as all other applicable legal requirements are satisfied, including voter approval.Capistrano Taxpayers Association, Inc. v. City of San Juan Capistrano, 235 Cal. App. 4th at pages 1515‚Äì1516 (April 2015). For purposes of determining whether a property-related fee or charge complies with the five requirements, a member of the public may generally make a written request and receive a copy of any local agency supporting documentation pursuant to the California Public Records Act. The payment of a fee covering the direct costs of duplicating requested pages from any supporting documentation may also be required by the agency.  Total Cost Requirement  The first requirement is that the revenues derived from the property-related fee or charge must not exceed the funds required to provide the property related service.Cal. Const., art. XIII D, ¬ß 6, subd. (b), par. (1). This is an aggregate cost requirement applicable to the combined cost from all parcels while the cost of service requirement contains a similar requirement at the parcel specific level.Capistrano Taxpayers Association, Inc. v. City of San Juan Capistrano, 235 Cal. App. 4th at page 1506 (April 2015). Use of the term \\"required\\" in the constitutional language is intended to preclude local agencies from levying property-related fees or charges for costs that are excessive, unreasonable or unnecessary. If voters believe a property-related fee or charge is excessive, unreasonable or unnecessary, exercise of the local initiative power under Proposition 218 to reduce or repeal the levy is also an available option. = Transferring excess utility revenue to a General Fund = Proposition 218 has been construed by the courts to prevent local governments from transferring revenues from a water utility to a general fund, unless the transferred funds are reimbursing the general fund for legitimate expenses related to the water utility. For example, if a city's general fund is used to pay for some water utility overhead costs, a transfer of revenue to the general fund is legally permitted.Moore v. City of Lemon Grove, 237 Cal. App. 4th 363 (June 2015) https://www.publicceo.com/2015/06/legal-alert-citys- transfer-from-its-wastewater-utility-to-its-general-fund-is-justified/L.A. Superior Court Judge Rules Water and Sewer Rate Transfers Unconstitutional 2 January 2020, Long Beach Business Journal https://www.lbbusinessjournal.com/l-a-superior-court-judge-rules-water-and- sewer-rate-transfers-unconstitutional/ If utility revenues exceed the cost of providing the service, the excess fees are considered a tax, and are not prohibited outright, but must instead be approved by the voters as a separate tax.Judge rules some of Long Beach‚Äôs Measure M transfers, approved by voters, are unconstitutional Press-Telegram, January 6, 2020 , https://www.presstelegram.com/2020/01/06/judge-rules-long-beachs-measure-m- transfers-approved-by-voters-are-unconstitutional  Use Requirement  The second requirement is that revenues derived from the property-related fee or charge must not be used for any purpose other than that for which the property-related fee or charge was imposed.Cal. Const., art. XIII D, ¬ß 6, subd. (b), par. (2).  Proportional Cost of Service Requirement  The third requirement is that the amount of a property-related fee or charge must not exceed the proportional cost of the property-related service attributable to the parcel. This requirement is frequently referred to as the \\"cost of service\\" requirement. Proposition 218 does not expressly require an agency to prepare a detailed report in support of a property-related fee or charge. However, as a practical matter, in order to comply with the requirements applicable to property-related fees and charges, a local agency must generally prepare a detailed supporting report. This is especially the case since under Proposition 218 in any legal action contesting the validity of a property- related fee or charge, the burden is on the local agency to demonstrate compliance with the law. A property-related fee or charge report prepared by a local agency is generally a public record whereby a member of the public may make a written request and receive a copy of the report under the California Public Records Act. Payment of a fee covering the direct costs of duplicating any requested pages from a property-related fee or charge report may also be required.  Actual Use or Immediate Availability Requirement  The fourth requirement is that no property-related fee or charge may be imposed for a property-related service unless that service is actually used by, or immediately available to, the owner of the property in question. In addition, property-related fees or charges based on potential or future use of a property-related service are not permitted.Cal. Const., art. XIII D, ¬ß 6, subd. (b), par. (4). The fourth requirement is intended to add a temporal component to the property-related fee or charge restrictions. Property owners using an existing property-related service are not supposed to be paying costs associated with future use of that service, including future service to their own property. This is especially the case with respect to paying for the costs of expensive public improvements for which property owners may not receive direct benefits from until years later (if ever at all). However, so far California appellate courts have generally allowed local agencies greater latitude in charging property owners for potential or future use of a property-related service.Capistrano Taxpayers Association, Inc. v. City of San Juan Capistrano, 235 Cal. App. 4th 1493 (April 2015).Paland v. Brooktrails Township Community Services District Board of Directors, 179 Cal. App. 4th 1358 (December 2009). = Classification of Standby Charges = A standby charge has historically been considered an assessment levied upon real property according to the availability of water.Trumbo v. Crestline Lake Arrowhead Water Agency, 250 Cal. App. 2d 320 (April 1967). Under Proposition 218, a standby charge, regardless of whether characterized as a property- related charge or an assessment, is classified as an assessment and may not be levied by a local agency without compliance with the more restrictive procedures and requirements applicable to assessments.  General Governmental Services Prohibition  The fifth requirement is that no property-related fee or charge may be levied for general governmental services including, but not limited to, police, fire, ambulance or library services, where the general governmental service is available to the public at large in substantially the same manner as it is to property owners.Cal. Const., art. XIII D, ¬ß 6, subd. (b), par. (5). The fifth requirement makes it difficult for local agencies to lawfully impose property-related fees or charges for general governmental services.  Tiered (Conservation) Water Rates and the 2015 Capistrano Decision  In 2015, a California appellate court in Capistrano Taxpayers Association, Inc. v. City of San Juan Capistrano, 235 Cal. App. 4th 1493 (April 2015) unanimously construed Proposition 218 as prohibiting local governments from charging higher water rates on heavier water users (tiered or conservation water rates) without complying with the cost of service requirement under the measure.Capistrano Taxpayers Association, Inc. v. City of San Juan Capistrano No. G048969 Important cases relied on by the court in the Capistrano decision included: * City of Palmdale v. Palmdale Water Dist. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 926, 934 * Bighorn-Desert View Water Agency v. Verjil (2006) 39 Cal.4th 205, 217 The Capistrano decision received widespread international coverage in the media because the decision came down during a severe drought in California. The Capistrano decision was also criticized by California Governor Jerry Brown when the decision came down. Tiered water rate structures generally do not place a cap on the amount of water a parcel may use. Rather, tiered rates make the cost of using water more expensive as a price signal to encourage water conservation. This means that a parcel may generally use as much water as desired as long as the water customer pays the higher price. Thus, tiered rates also function as a revenue raising device (a tax) to the extent the rates exceed the cost of providing the service to the parcel. Property-related charges that exceed the cost of service were precisely the type of abuse by local governments that Proposition 218 was intended to no longer permit. However, the Capistrano decision did not hold that Proposition 218 invalidated all tiered water rates in California. The appellate court merely stated that \\"tiers must still correspond to the actual cost of providing service at a given level of usage. The water agency here did not try to calculate the cost of actually providing water at its various tier levels. It merely allocated all its costs among the price tier levels, based not on costs, but on predetermined usage budgets.\\"Capistrano Taxpayers Association, Inc. v. City of San Juan Capistrano, 235 Cal. App. 4th at page 1498 (April 2015). The Capistrano decision further stated that \\"[t]he way Proposition 218 operates, water rates that exceed the cost of service operate as a tax, similar to the way a 'carbon tax' might be imposed on use of energy. But, we should emphasize: Just because such above-cost rates are a tax does not mean they cannot be imposed‚Äîthey just have to be submitted to the relevant electorate and approved by the people in a vote . . . However, if a local government body chooses to impose tiered rates unilaterally without a vote, those tiers must be based on cost of service for the incremental level of usage, not predetermined budgets.\\" The Capistrano decision also rejected the argument that higher water tier prices that exceed the cost of service may be justified as \\"penalties\\" not within the purview of Proposition 218 restrictions. In holding that this argument is inconsistent with Proposition 218, the court stated that \\"[i]t would open up a loophole in article XIII D, section 6, subdivision (b)(3) [part of Proposition 218] so large it would virtually repeal it. All an agency supplying any service would need to do to circumvent article XIII D, section 6, subdivision (b)(3), would be to establish a low legal base use for that service, pass an ordinance to the effect that any usage above the base amount is illegal, and then decree that the penalty for such illegal usage equals the incrementally increased rate for that service. Such a methodology could easily yield rates that have no relation at all to the actual cost of providing the service at the penalty levels. And it would make a mockery of the Constitution.\\"Capistrano Taxpayers Association, Inc. v. City of San Juan Capistrano, 235 Cal. App. 4th at page 1515 (April 2015), italics in original. The California Supreme Court subsequently denied requests by then California Attorney General Kamala Harris (representing the California State Water Resources Control Board) and local government interest organizations (Association of California Water Agencies, League of California Cities, and California State Association of Counties) to depublish the Capistrano decision. Despite the best efforts by the state's top lawyers and water experts to depublish the groundbreaking ruling, the California Supreme Court decision to keep it published means the Capistrano decision can continue to be cited as precedent throughout California in other lawsuits involving the legality under Proposition 218 of tiered water rates charged by other local governments. The Capistrano decision is also considered a milestone in the debate over to what extent appellate court decisions in California should be published as precedent. Proposition 218 does not prohibit other tools available to local governments that accomplish water conservation. Examples of such tools include: restricting specific wasteful uses of water (e.g., hosing down a driveway to clear debris), water usage caps or rationing, or public disclosure of excessive water users. After the 2015 Capistrano decision, lawsuits were filed against other cities in California, alleging that their tiered water rate structures were unconstitutional.Examples: * Otay Coziahr v. Otay Water et al. https://unicourt.com/case/ca-sd-mark-coziahr-vs- otay-water-district-321018 * Glendale http://glendalecacoalition.org/glendale- settles-two-lawsuits-over-tiered-water-rates/ * San Diego https://www.cptgroup.com/cityofsandiego/ https://trellis.law/rulings/party/San-Diego-Public-Utitilies-Department  Lifeline Utility Rates for Low Income Customers  Local agencies often provide financial assistance to low income customers in the form of lifeline utility rates. Some local agencies use existing taxpayer funds to finance lifeline utility rate programs. Other local agencies may use proceeds from voluntary donations or from a voter approved tax increase to finance lifeline utility rate programs. Proposition 218 issues arise when a local agency seeks to finance lifeline utility rate programs by increasing utility fees and charges on other ratepayers without voter approval. Local agencies generally prefer to legally overcharge ratepayers to pay for lifeline utility rate programs because no voter approval would be required and because it would free up existing local agency funds that could be spent on other purposes. However, since property-related fees and charges are limited to the cost of providing the service to each parcel of property, Proposition 218 prohibits local agencies from overcharging utility customers for property-related services such as water, sewer, and refuse collection to pay for lifeline utility rate programs. The legal reasoning is similar to the reasoning applied to tiered water rates and the cost of service limitations under Proposition 218. As with tiered water rates, Proposition 218 does not prohibit all lifeline utility rate programs by local agencies. Proposition 218 does not prohibit local agencies from using existing taxpayer funds to pay for lifeline utility rate programs much in the same manner that taxpayer funds are used to finance social and other government programs for those in need. Proposition 218 also does not prohibit local agencies from using voluntary donations or securing a voter approved tax increase to pay for lifeline utility rate programs. However, when local agencies overcharge other utility customers without voter approval to pay for lifeline utility rate programs, Proposition 218 does not allow this. While lifeline utility rate programs are intended to protect low income individuals, many other utility customers who don't qualify for lifeline programs are adversely impacted by significant utility fee and charge increases by local water agencies. If a local water agency is not responsive to the needs of its customers and raises water utility fees and charges too much, the local initiative power under Proposition 218 provides a remedy that can generally be used to reduce or repeal those utility fee and charge increases.  Voter Approval for New or Increased Property-Related Fees and Charges  Voter approval is also required for certain new or increased property-related fees or charges. Except for fees or charges for sewer, water, or refuse collection services, no property related fee or charge may be imposed or increased unless and until that property-related fee or charge is submitted and approved by a majority vote of the property owners of the property subject to the property-related fee or charge or, at the option of the agency, by a two-thirds vote of the electorate residing in the affected area. A property-related fee or charge election must be conducted not less than 45 days after the required public hearing. An agency is allowed to adopt procedures similar to those for increases in assessments in the conduct of property-related fee or charge elections. However, a property-related fee or charge election cannot be used to validate or override a property-related fee or charge otherwise prohibited under Proposition 218.  Election Exemptions  Property-related fees or charges for sewer, water, or refuse collection services are exempt from the voter approval requirement. Since the exemptions represent exceptions to a voter approval requirement, the election exemptions are strictly construed.Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association v. City of Salinas, 98 Cal. App. 4th at page 1358 (June 2002). Nevertheless, most property-related fees or charges fall within an election exemption as typical utility fees for water, sewer, or refuse collection services. Examples of new or increased property-related fees or charges that ordinarily require an election include stormwater fees or flood control fees.  Property-Related Fee or Charge Election Procedures  If a property-related fee or charge election is required, the local agency decides whether the election will be a property owner election requiring a majority vote or a two-thirds vote registered voter election. The California Supreme Court has ruled that property owner elections for property-related fees and charges are not subject to the voting secrecy provision in the California Constitution. The California Legislature has enacted additional legal procedures relating to property-related fee or charge elections under Proposition 218. These procedures are mandatory and are in addition to any other procedures that may be adopted by the local agency.Cal. Gov. Code, ¬ß 53755.5. The new procedural requirements became legally operative on July 1, 2014.Cal. Gov. Code, ¬ß 53755.5, subd. (d). If the agency submits the proposed property-related fee or charge for approval by a two-thirds vote of the registered voters residing in the affected area, the election must be conducted by the agency's elections official or his or her designee.Cal. Gov. Code, ¬ß 53755.5, subd. (a). = Property Owner Election Procedures = If the agency submits the proposed property-related fee or charge for approval by a majority vote of the property owners who will be subject to the fee or charge, then additional procedures apply and must be followed. On the face of each envelope in which the notice of election and ballot are mailed, there must appear in substantially the following form the phrase \\"OFFICIAL BALLOT ENCLOSED\\" in no smaller than 16-point bold type. A local agency may additionally place the phrase \\"OFFICIAL BALLOT ENCLOSED\\" on the face of the envelope in a language or languages other than English.Cal. Gov. Code, ¬ß 53755.5, subd. (b), par. (1). The ballot must include the agency's address for return of the ballot, the date and location where the ballots will be tabulated, and a place where the person returning it may indicate his or her name, a reasonable identification of the parcel, and his or her support or opposition to the proposed property-related fee or charge. The ballots must be tabulated in a location accessible to the public. The ballot must be in a form that conceals its content once it is sealed by the person submitting it. The ballot must remain sealed until the ballot tabulation starts.Cal. Gov. Code, ¬ß 53755.5, subd. (b), par. (2). An impartial person designated by the agency who does not have a vested interest in the outcome of the proposed property- related fee or charge must tabulate the ballots.Cal. Gov. Code, ¬ß 53755.5, subd. (b), par. (3). An impartial person includes, but is not limited to, the clerk of the agency. If the agency uses agency personnel for the ballot tabulation, or if the agency contracts with a vendor for the ballot tabulation and the vendor or its affiliates participated in the research, design, engineering, public education, or promotion of the property-related fee or charge, the ballots must be unsealed and tabulated in public view to permit all interested persons to meaningfully monitor the accuracy of the ballot tabulation process. The ballot tabulation may be continued to a different time or different location accessible to the public, provided that the time and location are announced at the location at which the tabulation started and is posted by the agency in a location accessible to the public. The impartial person may use technological methods to tabulate the ballots, including, but not limited to, punchcard or optically readable (bar-coded) ballots.Cal. Gov. Code, ¬ß 53755.5, subd. (b), par. (4). During and after the tabulation, the ballots are treated as public records subject to public disclosure under the California Public Records Act, and must be made available for inspection by any interested person. The ballots must be preserved for a minimum of two years, after which they may be destroyed as provided by law. Historically, the constitutional right to vote in secret did not apply to property owner elections. This was not altered by the passage of Proposition 218.  Stormwater Drainage Fees and Charges  One of the most significant issues under the Proposition 218 election requirement for property-related fees and charges is whether stormwater drainage fees and charges are exempt from the election requirement as either a fee for \\"water\\" or \\"sewer\\" service. = Stormwater Drainage Fees and the 2002 Salinas Decision = Many local agencies use existing revenues from their general fund to help finance stormwater programs. Some local agencies also use existing revenues from stormwater fees and charges imposed without voter approval before Proposition 218 became law when an election was not legally required at that time. However, legal issues arise under Proposition 218 when local agencies seek to raise stormwater revenues in the form of a new or increased fee or charge without voter approval. In 2002, a California appellate court in the published case of Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association v. City of Salinas, 98 Cal. App. 4th 1351 (June 2002) unanimously held that a stormwater drainage fee imposed on developed parcels of land was a \\"property-related\\" fee subject to Proposition 218, including the voter approval requirement thereunder. Prior to the Salinas decision, the California Attorney General previously issued a formal written opinion in 1998 and concluded not only that storm drainage fees are \\"property-related\\" fees subject to Proposition 218, but also that the election exemptions for \\"sewer\\" and \\"water\\" services do not apply.81 Ops. Cal. Atty. Gen. 104 (March 1998). Thus, the California Attorney General reached the same conclusions concerning stormwater drainage fees under Proposition 218 as the appellate court did in the Salinas case which was decided some four years later. Concerning the issue of whether the sewer or water service election exemptions applied, the City of Salinas argued that the court should rely on the commonly accepted meaning of \\"sewer,\\" noting the broad dictionary definition of this word. The city also pointed to several code sections that described storm drains as a type of sewer.Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association v. City of Salinas, 98 Cal. App. 4th at page 1356 (June 2002). Yet, even an analysis of Proposition 218 in a League of California Cities publication before the November 1996 election made a distinction between storm drainage and sewer systems (and also water systems) in stating: \\"But, it appears that all fees and charges for water, sanitation, storm drainage, or sewer are included within the scope of the measure.\\" This analysis was available to the public before the Proposition 218 election, and it came from an organization, the League of California Cities, that opposed Proposition 218. The Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association argued that the court should look beyond mere dictionary definitions of \\"sewer\\" to examine the legal meaning of the term in the specific context of how that term is used in Proposition 218. The Association also observed that numerous California statutes differentiated between storm drainage and sewerage systems, including a specific statute that legally authorizes many local governments to levy fees and charges for storm drainage or sewerage systems.Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association v. City of Salinas, 98 Cal. App. 4th at page 1357 (June 2002).Cal. Health & Saf. Code, ¬ß 5471. In resolving the appropriate standard of construction that should be applied in interpreting the scope of the election exemption for property- related fees under Proposition 218, the appellate court in the Salinas case stated: \\"We must keep in mind, however, the voters' intent that the constitutional provision be construed liberally to curb the rise in \\"excessive\\" taxes, assessments, and fees exacted by local governments without taxpayer consent. Accordingly, we are compelled to resort to the principle that exceptions to a general rule of an enactment must be strictly construed.\\"Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association v. City of Salinas, 98 Cal. App. 4th at pages 1357‚Äì1358 (June 2002).Prop. 218, ¬ß 2 [Proposition 218 Findings and Declarations].Prop. 218, ¬ß 5 [Proposition 218 Liberal Construction Provision]. Thus, since Proposition 218 constitutionally requires that its provisions be liberally construed to limit local government revenues and enhance taxpayer consent, an election exemption provision that would have the opposite effect of enhancing local government revenues and limiting taxpayer consent must be strictly construed. This conclusion is also consistent with the rule of interpretation that exceptions to the general rule of a law be strictly construed.City of Lafayette v. East Bay Mun. Utility Dist., 16 Cal. App. 4th at page 1017 (June 1993). In applying the strict construction standard to the sewer service exemption, the appellate court construed the exemption to include only its narrower and more common meaning applicable to sanitary sewerage. Using similar reasoning, the appellate court also concluded that the stormwater drainage fee did not qualify under the water service exemption. The court noted that the \\"average voter would envision 'water service' as the supply of water for personal, household, and commercial use, not a system or program that monitors storm water for pollutants, carries it away, and discharges it into the nearby creeks, river, and ocean.\\" The City of Salinas subsequently petitioned the appellate court to rehear the Salinas case, but that petition was denied.Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association v. City of Salinas, 98 Cal. App. 4th at page 1359 (June 2002). Thereafter, the City of Salinas petitioned the California Supreme Court to review the Salinas case, but that petition was also denied as the California Supreme Court refused to review the case.2002 Cal. LEXIS 5938 (August 28, 2002). Many local agencies, politicians, and environmental interest groups want stormwater drainage services to also be classified as a utility service in the same class as water, sanitary sewer, and refuse collection services that are exempt from a property-related fee election under Proposition 218. If, contrary to the Salinas decision, stormwater drainage services were classified as an election exempt service, local agencies would no longer need voter approval under Proposition 218 to impose new or increased stormwater drainage fees and charges. This not only would result in local agencies imposing many new or increased stormwater fees and charges, but also in significantly higher amounts than would have otherwise been imposed had voter approval been required. = SB 231 (2017) Attempt to Circumvent Voter Approval Requirement for Stormwater Fees = On February 2, 2017, Senator Robert Hertzberg (Democrat-District 18-Van Nuys) introduced Senate Bill No. 231 (SB 231) which would redefine and expand, by statute, the constitutional \\"sewer service\\" election exemption under Proposition 218 as also applying to stormwater fees and charges.Senate Floor Analysis of SB 231, April 21, 2017. Hertzberg sought to \\"clarify\\" the California Constitution so that it will be easier for local governments to impose fees and charges to pay for stormwater programs and services by also exempting stormwater fees and charges from the constitutional election requirement under Proposition 218.Senate Floor Analysis SB 231, April 21, 2017, p. 4. However, a 2002 published California appellate court decision (the Salinas case) made it clear that stormwater fees and charges are not exempt from the constitutional election requirement for property-related fees under Proposition 218 in stating: \\"We conclude that article XIII D [part of Prop. 218] required the City to subject the proposed storm drainage fee to a vote by the property owners or the voting residents of the affected area.\\"Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association v. City of Salinas, 98 Cal. App. 4th 1351, 1358‚Äì1359 (June 2002). Jon Coupal, President of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, wrote that SB 231 is an end run around Proposition 218 in that it attempts to illegally rewrite a Prop. 218 constitutional election exemption applicable to sewer and water service with a mere statute to allow for stormwater to be included under the definition of \\"sewer,\\" meaning that stormwater fees and charges would no longer be subject to a Proposition 218 election.Coupal, Jon, Hertzberg targets homeowners, Daily News of Los Angeles, February 12, 2017, p. 23. On October 6, 2017, SB 231 was signed by Governor Brown and became a statute.Stats. 2017, ch. 536.Cal. Const., art. IV, ¬ß 10, subd. (a). The SB 231 statute became effective on January 1, 2018.Cal. Const., art. IV, ¬ß 8, subd. (c). Notwithstanding the SB 231 statute, local governments remain bound by the Salinas case decision interpreting the constitutional language of Proposition 218. = Local Initiative Power to Reduce or Repeal Stormwater Fees and Charges = The property-related fee or charge election requirement for stormwater fees and charges only applies to new or increased stormwater levies. Stormwater fees and charges existing before Proposition 218 became law are not subject to the property-related fee or charge election requirement so long as those property- related fees or charges are not increased by the local government. However, existing (before Proposition 218 became law) stormwater fees and charges imposed without voter approval can generally be reduced or repealed by the voters using the local initiative power under Proposition 218, including the significantly reduced signature requirement thereunder. In addition, if any new or increased stormwater fee or charge is imposed by a local government without complying with the election requirement under Proposition 218, such as by a local government relying on SB 231 (2017) to evade the constitutional election requirement applicable to stormwater fees and charges, as a political remedy that fee or charge may also be reduced or repealed by the voters using the local initiative power under Proposition 218, including the significantly reduced signature requirement thereunder. This can be done as an alternative to, or concurrent with, any legal remedy for noncompliance with any applicable election requirement under Proposition 218. After property owner or voter approval of a property-related fee or charge, the local initiative power under Proposition 218 can also generally be used by the electorate to reduce or repeal a stormwater levy. An example of where such a local initiative may be appropriate involves election issues or controversies associated with a property owner election, particularly where the local government adopted controversial election procedures. Should a property-related fee or charge reduction or repeal initiative qualify for the ballot, the initiative election would be by the registered voters since the initiative power is a power applicable to the electors.Cal. Const., art. II, ¬ß 8, subd. (a).  Local Agency Burden to Demonstrate Compliance  Prior to Proposition 218, the courts allowed local agencies significant flexibility in determining fee or charge amounts. In lawsuits challenging fees or charges, the challenger generally had the burden to show that they were not legal. However, Proposition 218 shifted the burden of demonstrating compliance to the local agency in any lawsuit challenging a property-related fee or charge. In any legal action contesting the validity of a property-related fee or charge, the burden is on the local agency to demonstrate compliance with the procedures and requirements applicable to property-related fees and charges. This change in the law makes it significantly easier for taxpayers to win a legal challenge involving a property-related fee or charge under Proposition 218. The independent standard of review for property assessments adopted by the California Supreme Court in the landmark Silicon Valley Taxpayers case also applies to legal challenges involving property-related fees and charges.City of Palmdale v. Palmdale Water District, 198 Cal. App. 4th 926 (August 2011). As a result, California courts now exercise their independent judgment in determining whether a property-related fee or charge violates Proposition 218. The independent standard of review makes it significantly easier for taxpayers to win legal challenges involving property-related fees and charges.  Application to Regional Levies  Proposition 218 expressly applies to regional governments in California under its broad \\"local government\\" constitutional definition. This means that regional governments must comply with the voter approval requirements for taxes as well as the procedures and requirements applicable to special assessments and property-related fees and charges.Cal. Const., art. XIII D. Regional government can also take the form of delivering government services and programs from the state level down to the regional level. An example would be a state administered water program limited to the Central Valley region of California. If a separate regional governmental agency is involved, the agency will generally be subject to Proposition 218. However, when a separate regional governmental agency is not involved, it is unclear whether Proposition 218 compliance is required as California courts have yet to resolve this issue.  Regional Levies and Accountability Issues  There is a growing trend in California to address public policy issues on a regional basis. From the perspective of taxpayers and voters voting on a regional governmental levy (such as a regional tax or a regional property-related fee or charge), significant accountability concerns can arise. Depending upon the laws creating a regional governmental agency, the governing body may not be directly elected by the voters of the region. In many instances, the governing body members of a regional governmental agency are appointed. If the governing body of a regional governmental agency is not directly elected by voters of the region, political accountability issues often arise regarding the expenditure of public funds derived from a regional governmental levy. This is because there is no provision for directly electing members of the governing body. In addition, if the governing body members of a regional governmental agency are not directly elected, the recall power is also not available to remove those members from the regional governing body. In the foregoing situation, if any expenditure problems were to occur after approval of a regional governmental levy, voters will not be able to vote any problem governing body members out of office as a political accountability mechanism. As an accountability mechanism, a regional governmental levy can generally be reduced or repealed using the local initiative power under Proposition 218, including the significantly reduced signature requirement thereunder. However, even with the significantly reduced signature requirement, qualifying an initiative for a regional levy will generally be more difficult because of the large number of voters involved.  Application to State Levies  Levies imposed by the State of California are generally not subject to Proposition 218 because the state is not a \\"local government\\" under Article XIII C or an \\"agency\\" under Article XIII D. While state taxes are not subject to Proposition 218, such taxes are generally subject to approval by two-thirds of all members of the California Legislature.Cal. Const., art. XIII A, ¬ß 3. The preceding requirement for state taxes was adopted when Proposition 13 was approved by California voters in 1978. Proposition 26, approved by California voters in 2010, added a broad constitutional definition of \\"tax\\" applicable to the state with the resulting effect of expanding the scope of state levies subject to two-thirds approval by the California Legislature.Cal. Const., art. XIII A, ¬ß 3, subd. (b). Special assessments on real property as well as property-related fees and charges, the types of levies ordinarily subject to Proposition 218, are generally not levied by the state. To the extent such levies may be imposed by the State of California, whether two- thirds legislative approval is required is determined by the provisions of Proposition 26 approved in 2010.  State Levies Imposed Within Limited Geographic Boundaries  There may exist limited instances in which levies imposed by the State of California might be subject to Proposition 218. Under Proposition 218, the definition of a \\"special district\\" refers to \\"an agency of the State, formed pursuant to general law or a special act, for the local performance of governmental or proprietary functions with limited geographic boundaries.\\"Cal. Const., art. XIII C, ¬ß 1, subd. (c). Accordingly, some state agencies are subject to Proposition 218 when they are a \\"special district.\\" While a state agency imposing a levy at the state level is not a \\"special district,\\" such an agency may be a \\"local or regional governmental entity\\" under the broad definition of a \\"local government,\\" and thereby be subject to Proposition 218 if the levy is imposed within limited geographic boundaries as opposed to being imposed on a statewide basis. An example is a state levy imposed solely within the Central Valley region of California. Another example is a state levy imposed solely within the boundaries of a local government in situations where the state has taken partial or complete control over the local government and is exercising powers ordinarily exercised by the local government.  Article XIII D Application to the State  Under Proposition 218, any real property within an assessment district that is owned or used by the State of California is generally not exempt from assessment. As a result, the State of California must pay its fair share of any special assessment on real property lawfully levied pursuant to Proposition 218. The State of California is also entitled to vote in assessment ballot proceedings required by Proposition 218. The State of California is also entitled to Proposition 218 protections applicable to property-related fees and charges. This includes rights to receive written notice and protest a property-related fee or charge, the five requirement safeguards applicable to property-related fees and charges (including \\"cost of service\\" protections), and the right to vote if a property owner election is held for a property-related fee or charge. The California Department of General Services is required to develop compliance standards in the State Administrative Manual to inform owners of state property in California of their duties and responsibilities under Proposition 218.Cal. Gov. Code, ¬ß 53752. Under the State Administrative Manual, all state agencies are required to determine that, with respect to state properties for which an assessment is levied by a local government, the applicable assessment district was properly constituted pursuant to law and that the requisite special benefit is present. If the assessment is valid, then the state agency which owns or controls the property must promptly pay its proportionate share of the assessment.California State Administrative Manual, ¬ß 1310.4 (June 2014).California State Administrative Manual Management Memo MM 05-17, Assessments Levied by Local Government Agencies.  Liberal Interpretation Constitutional Provision  Section 5 of Proposition 218 contains a liberal interpretation provision constitutionally commanding that its provisions be \\"liberally construed to effectuate its purposes of limiting local government revenue and enhancing taxpayer consent.\\" The liberal interpretation constitutional command is legally binding on all California courts (including the California Supreme Court), the California Legislature, government agencies, and government officials and employees in their interpretation and application of Proposition 218. The liberal interpretation provision has positively affected the outcome of numerous Proposition 218 lawsuits when it has been properly applied by the courts as intended.Examples of such cases include: Silicon Valley Taxpayers' Association, Inc. v. Santa Clara County Open Space Authority, 44 Cal. 4th 431 (July 2008) [special assessments; standard of review]; Bay Area Cellular Telephone Company v. City of Union City, 162 Cal. App. 4th 686 (April 2008) [911 access fees]; Capistrano Taxpayers Association, Inc. v. City of San Juan Capistrano, 235 Cal. App. 4th 1493 (April 2015) [tiered/conservation water rates]; and Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association v. City of Salinas, 98 Cal. App. 4th 1351 (June 2002) [stormwater fees and the election requirement thereunder]. However, there have also been cases where the liberal interpretation constitutional command has been disregarded by the courts without proper legal justification such as in California Cannabis Coalition v. City of Upland, 3 Cal. 5th 924 (August 2017) [application of election consolidation requirement for general taxes to the constitutional exercise of the local initiative power]. This has fueled support for the proposed California Judicial Reform Act which would significantly reform the manner in which the courts decide cases related to taxpayer protections.  Judicial Interpretation Before Proposition 218  The importance and significance of the liberal interpretation provision under Proposition 218 can be traced to prior adverse judicial interpretations of Proposition 13 strictly construing important provisions of that initiative measure. In two leading cases in 1982, the California Supreme Court, headed by controversial Chief Justice Rose Bird, formulated and applied a special rule of interpretation applicable only to Proposition 13 that strictly construed the circumstances in which local governments must get two-thirds voter approval to approve local tax increases.Los Angeles County Transportation Commission v. Richmond, 31 Cal. 3d 197 (April 1982) [strictly interpreting the term \\"special districts\\"]; City and County of San Francisco v. Farrell, 32 Cal. 3d 47 (August 1982) [strictly interpreting the term \\"special taxes\\"]. This had the practical effect of the courts significantly limiting the scope of Proposition 13. The California Supreme Court majority reasoned that due to the \\"fundamentally undemocratic nature\\" of a two-thirds vote supermajority requirement, the applicable voter approval requirement for local taxes under Proposition 13 must be strictly construed.Los Angeles County Transportation Commission v. Richmond, 31 Cal. 3d at page 205 (April 1982). This special rule of interpretation was not consistent with the usual interpretation of initiative measures, and has not been applied by the California Supreme Court in circumstances other than Proposition 13 where a supermajority vote is required in an initiative measure. As a result of the two-thirds voter approval requirement for local taxes under Proposition 13 being strictly construed, local governments in California were able to impose many local tax increases with either simple majority voter approval or no voter approval at all. The resulting adverse impact frustrated the effective tax relief provisions of Proposition 13 to the significant detriment of California taxpayers, especially homeowners. The special strict construction rule of interpretation also provided a legal basis for California courts to narrowly and strictly interpret the circumstances in which nontax levies such as property assessments, fees, and charges were in reality special taxes subject to two-thirds voter approval under Proposition 13.  Reaction to Proposition 218 by Local Governments  Proposition 218 significantly limits the ability of local governments to raise revenues without voter approval. As a result, most local governments in California opposed Proposition 218 when it appeared on the ballot, and remain hostile to Proposition 218. In nearly every Proposition 218 appellate court case of significance, local government interests, including the League of California Cities, the California State Association of Counties, and the Association of California Water Agencies have sought to limit the scope and application of Proposition 218 restrictions by arguing in favor of narrow or strict interpretations of the taxpayer protections.Examples of such cases include: Bighorn-Desert View Water Agency v. Verjil, 39 Cal. 4th 205 (July 2006) [scope of property-related fee or charge definition; scope of local initiative power to reduce or repeal local levies]; Silicon Valley Taxpayers' Association, Inc. v. Santa Clara County Open Space Authority, 44 Cal. 4th 431 (July 2008) [scope of special assessment reforms, including what constitutes a \\"special benefit\\" under new constitutional definition; applicable standard of review under article XIII D]; Capistrano Taxpayers Association, Inc. v. City of San Juan Capistrano, 235 Cal. App. 4th 1493 (April 2015) [validity or tiered/conservation water rates; validity of penalty rates]; and Mission Springs Water District v. Verjil, 218 Cal. App. 4th 892 (August 2013) [scope of local initiative power to reduce or repeal local levies]. The actions by local governments to limit the scope and application of Proposition 218 are not limited to the courts. Through the legislative process, particularly in the California Legislature but also via the ballot initiative process, local governments have also supported legislative proposals that limit or otherwise erode Proposition 218 taxpayer protections. California law allows local governments to spend taxpayer funds to lobby in support of such legislative proposals in the California Legislature either directly or indirectly through local government interest associations such as the League of California Cities, the California State Association of Counties, and the Association of California Water Agencies.

It was first published in the August 1976 issue of Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine, and reprinted in the collections The Bicentennial Man and Other Stories (1976) and The Complete Robot (1982). Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine editor Frederic Dannay contacted Asimov in the fall of 1975 with a story proposal: the August 1976 issue, which would be on the stands during the United States Bicentennial, would include a contemporary mystery set in 1976 and a historical mystery set in 1876. He wanted a science fiction mystery set in 2076, and Asimov agreed to write one. Asimov's original title for the story was \\"Death at the Tercentenary\\", but when the story appeared he decided he liked Dannay's title better. The concept of a robot taking political office in the guise of a human was also the theme of Asimov's 1946 story, \\"Evidence\\". Edwards theory about the robots motivation is similar to The Zeroth Law of Robotics, having been speculated upon earlier in The Evitable Conflict and later elaborated on in Robots and Empire. Plot summary This story begins on 4 July 2076. The United States itself is no longer a sovereign country, but part of a Global Federation. The beginning of the story details the Tercentenary speech by the 57th president, Hugo Allen Winkler, who is described by Secret Service agent Lawrence Edwards as a \\"vote- grabber, a promiser\\" who has failed to get anything done during his first term in office. While moving through a crowd near the Washington Monument, the President suddenly disappears in a \\"glitter of dust\\". He reappears very shortly afterwards on a guarded stage and gives a stirring speech which is quite different from the kind he usually makes. Edwards is reminded of rumors of a robot double of the President existing as a security measure, and concludes that the double was assassinated. Two years after that occurrence, the now retired Edwards contacts the Presidents personal secretary, a man named Janek, convinced that it was not the robot double who had died at the Tercentenary, but the President himself, with the robot having then taken office. Edwards points to rumors of an experimental weapon, a disintegrator, and suggests this is the weapon used to assassinate Winkler, as not only does its effect mirror that seen at the Tercentenary, but also made examination of the corpse impossible. He goes on to argue that the robot duplicate, posing as the President, retrieved the disintegrator and arranged the assassination. Following the incident, the President has become much more effective, but as Edwards points out, he has also become more reclusive, even towards his own children. The robot, Edward claims, must have concluded that Winkler was too ineffectual to serve as President, and the death of one man was acceptable to save three billion, and this is what allowed it to circumvent the First Law of Robotics. Edwards implores Janek, as the Presidents closest confidante, to confirm his suspicions and convince the robot to resign, worrying about the precedent set by having a robot ruler. Following the meeting, Janek decides to have Edwards eliminated to keep him from going public with his findings, and the story ends with the revelation that Janek was the man behind the assassination of the President.

Clarke, originally published in the March 1964 issue of Boys' Life,Short Stories . Arthurcclarke.net, 2007-2011, retrieved June 22, 2011. The story has also been published under the title \\"The Wind from the Sun\\" in Clarke's 1972 collection of short stories with this title. It depicts a yacht race between solar sail spacecraft. Plot summary John Merton, a spaceship designer, develops and promotes a lightweight spacecraft with a large area of solar sail, to be powered entirely by radiation pressure‚Äîthe so-called wind from the sun. The sun-yachts start their journey in Earth's orbit, and, pushed simply by sunlight, can achieve a speed of two thousand miles an hour within a day. The concept leads to the development of the sport of sun-yacht racing, and after several years of refining his ideas, Merton competes in what will be his final race. His hopes for victory rest on the low mass of his craft which he has made possible through advances in automation enabling him to fly it solo. Soon, all but two of the competitors have dropped out, mainly due to damaged craft, and it is a straight race between Merton's craft and Lebedev, entered by a Russian crew from the University of Astrograd. Although the Lebedev is lagging Merton's yacht, its senior pilot delivers a surprise blow by announcing that he plans to jettison his co-pilot in an escape capsule now that the earlier, navigationally intensive part of the race has finished. Merton responds by recalculating his expected margin of victory and realises that the race is now going to be neck-and-neck at the finish line. At this point news arrives of a massive, and potentially deadly, solar flare. The race has to be abandoned, and there is no winner, though Merton abandons his craft with its sail still fully extended in order to ensure that it will be blown into interstellar space. Reception Donald A. Wollheim and Terry Carr selected the story for World's Best Science Fiction: 1966.

She was named for Bolivar County, Mississippi. Bolivar was laid down on 13 May 1942 at San Francisco, California, by the Western Pipe and Steel Company under a Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 269); launched as SS Sea Angel on 7 September 1942; sponsored by Mrs. Robert W. Ethen; originally designated a transport, AP-79; reclassified APA-34 on 1 February 1943; transferred to the Navy on 15 March 1943; commissioned that same day, as Bolivar, Lieutenant Commander R. E. Perry in command; moved to Hoboken, New Jersey; decommissioned there on 23 April; converted to an attack transport by Todd Shipbuilding Company; and recommissioned on 1 September, Capt. Joseph A. Gainard in command. Operational history On 12 September, Bolivar departed Hoboken and steamed to Norfolk, Virginia where she loaded boats and embarked troops for a month of training. The ship then returned north to take on a consignment of coffee and canned beef at Brooklyn for delivery to the West Coast. After joining a convoy off Norfolk on 13 October, Bolivar headed through the Panama Canal for San Pedro, California, where she arrived on 1 November. On 14 November, Bolivar and five other attack transports began two months of training off San Clemente Island and Camp Pendleton. At the conclusion of the training, she embarked elements of the 3rd Marines and rehearsed the many phases of amphibious landings from loading and unloading troops and equipment, to various small boat landings and antiaircraft drills. On 20 December, Bolivar became flagship for the Commander, Transport Division (TransDiv) 28. Kwajalein Atoll On 13 January 1944, Bolivar steamed out of San Diego, California with TransDiv 28 bound for Hawaii and arrived at Pearl Harbor on the 21st. Her Hawaiian visit proved very brief because she got underway again the next day to take part in the invasion of the Marshall Islands. On 31 January, at the disembarkation area on the lee side of Kwajalein Atoll, Bolivar transferred elements of the 23d Marines that she carried to LSTs. The troops would be conveyed the following morning to the beaches of Roi for the main assault. In a little more than 26 hours, the Northern Attack Force under Rear Admiral Richard L. Conolly secured the northern part of Kwajalein Atoll, and Bolivar departed the lagoon on 8 February for Pearl Harbor. The attack transport spent the month of March training with the 2nd Marine Division for the assault on Saipan, and spent April and May in Pearl Harbor. Saipan On 30 May, Bolivar steamed out of Pearl Harbor with units of the 16th Marines embarked as part of Transport Group \\"Able\\" bound for Saipan in the Mariana Islands. TransDiv 28 stood off the beaches of Charan Kanoa early on 15 June, and Bolivar's first boats hit the beaches at 0844. The nine ships of TransDiv 18 and TransDiv 19 lost only 10 LCVP's and 4 LCM's during the landing. Bolivar remained in her transport area several miles offshore for three days disembarking troops and unloading equipment. On the 18th, she and the other auxiliaries received orders to head for a safe area east of Saipan where they remained until the Battle of the Philippine Sea was won on 20 June. She then returned to her transport area, embarked 295 casualties, and set sail for Pearl Harbor with her division. Guam At Pearl Harbor, Bolivar embarked a unit of the 306th Regimental Combat Team (RCT) of the Army's 77th Infantry Division and got underway for Guam on 9 July. She reached Guam on 22 July, the day after the landings, and remained there for a week disembarking reinforcement troops and unloading their equipment. She then headed back to Hawaii, arriving at Pearl Harbor on 10 August. After embarking a battalion of the Army's 383d Regiment, Bolivar rehearsed landing maneuvers at Maui, ostensibly for the invasion of Yap Island. The attack transport left Pearl Harbor on 15 September but, one day out of port, received orders cancelling the Yap campaign and directing Bolivar to Manus in the Admiralty Islands. Leyte Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid's 7th Fleet was based at Manus where the invasion of Leyte was planned and staged. On 14 October, Bolivar stood out of Seeadler Harbor as part of Transport Group \\"Baker\\" of the Southern Attack Force headed for Leyte. At mid-morning on 20 October, Bolivar began disembarking troops from an anchorage in Leyte Gulf off Dulag. The attack transport did not get her full cargo unloaded by sunset, so she remained at anchor under a thick smokescreen. Bolivar completed her unloading the next day and, with her squadron, threaded her way through the aircraft defense smoke cover and headed south for Hollandia, New Guinea, carrying casualties to the Army hospital there. Bolivar embarked reinforcements at Hollandia and sailed back to Leyte. She arrived on 18 November, and a kamikaze attack began almost as soon as she anchored. The attack transport witnessed one hit on , anchored about half a mile away, but Bolivar escaped attack. She quickly disembarked her troops, unloaded her cargo, and got underway the same day for Cape Torokina, Bougainville, where she took a battalion of the 37th Division on board. Luzon The attack transport rehearsed landings of Huan Gulf, New Guinea, in preparation for the amphibious assault on Luzon at Lingayen. Bolivar headed for Lingayen Gulf on 31 December as part of Task Force (TF) 79. The transports arrived at their designated anchorages in lower Lingayen Gulf by 0700 on 9 January 1945, despite heavy enemy air attacks which crashed the aircraft carrier and narrowly missed the Australian ship in column to port of Bolivar. At 0900, Bolivar's boats moved toward the beaches with the first assault wave. After unloading cargo and troops in a scant eight hours, the transport took on board badly wounded crewmen from the battleship which had been hit by a kamikaze on 6 January. Cargo holds empty, the first echelon of transports, including Bolivar, left Lingayen Gulf at dusk through the smoke screen and the continuing air attacks. At Leyte, Bolivar transferred the wounded to the Dutch hospital ship HMNS Maetsuycher. She remained at Leyte until 19 January, when she weighed anchor and got underway for Ulithi. There, she took on fuel and provisions in preparation for embarking more troops. Iwo Jima On 6 February, Bolivar set out for Guam with a squadron of transports to embark elements of the 21st Marines. The convoy left Guam on 16 February and set course for the next stepping stone to Japan - Iwo Jima. The initial assault troops landed on 19 February, but Bolivar stood by off Iwo Jima holding her embarked troops in reserve. Finally, on the 21st, she commenced disembarkation, but high winds and other difficulties delayed the landing's completion until the 24th. Bolivar remained offshore receiving wounded soldiers for almost two weeks. On 3 March, one of her own crewmembers was killed and two others were wounded when a shell from an enemy shore battery exploded close aboard. Several night air attacks developed during her two-week stay, but Bolivar suffered no damage. The attack transport left Iwo Jima on 6 March carrying 450 casualties to Saipan, where they were disembarked on 10 March. She left immediately for Noum√©a, New Caledonia, where she arrived on 23 March. Okinawa The Army's 81st Infantry Division‚Äîbilleted there as reserve for the Okinawa invasion‚Äîembarked in Bolivar, and she got underway on 9 April for landing rehearsals on the New Caledonian coast. After three days of maneuvers, the ship returned to Noum√©a where she stood ready to answer the call for reinforcements at Okinawa. That word never came and, on 3 May, Bolivar left for Leyte, where she anchored on 16 May and disembarked her troops two days later. After transferring her excess boats and provisions to other units, the attack transport set sail on 26 May for Apra Harbor, Guam. There she embarked 450 soldiers wounded at Okinawa and set course for Hawaii, an intermediate stop on the voyage back to the United States. She picked up 100 sailors at Pearl Harbor and arrived at Seattle, Washington, on 17 June. After transferring the casualties and other passengers and unloading ammunition, Bolivar made the short overnight run to Portland, Oregon, where she began a general overhaul at Kaiser Shipbuilding Corporation's Swan Island yard on the 18th. Operation Magic Carpet The war ended before the attack transport completed overhaul but, on 2 September, she put to sea as part of the Operation Magic Carpet fleet returning veterans from the Philippines, Marshall, Admiralty, and Caroline Islands. Returning to San Francisco on 29 January 1946, Bolivar discharged her passengers and proceeded to the New York Naval Shipyard in Brooklyn, New York, via the Panama Canal Zone and Norfolk, Virginia. Decommissioning and after On 29 April 1946, Bolivar was decommissioned, and her name was struck from the Navy List on 19 July 1946. The transport was returned to the Maritime Commission on 12 September 1946. The ship was initially leased by American President Lines, Ltd., and subsequently by several other companies, before disappearing from mercantile records in 1973. Bolivar received five battle stars for her service during World War II.

Venkata Rao is revered as Karnataka Kulapurohita (High priest of the Kannada family) in the Karnataka region for his contribution towards the cause of a separate Karnataka state. He became famous for undertaking a Karnataka Ekikarana movement in support of the formation of a state for the Kannada-speaking population of Mysore, Bombay Presidency and the Nizam's Hyderabad. He started his own newspaper Jaya Karnataka and stated that the sole aim of the newspaper was to strive for Karnataka‚Äôs statehood. Early life Venkata Rao was born on July 12, 1880 to Bhima Rao, a shirastedar in revenue department . They were of orthodox Madhwa Brahmin family in Bijapur, Karnataka. He studied for a B.A and L.L.B at Fergusson College, where he came in contact with Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, Senapati Bapat and Bal Gangadhar Tilak. Rao was a close friend of Tilak and translated his Gita Rahasya into Kannada. Works Rao began by contributing articles to newspapers such as Chandrodhaya, Karnataka Patra, and Rajahamsa, Karnataka Vritta In 1906 he began to work as an editor for a monthly magazine, Vagbhushana. In November 1922, he started Jaya Karnataka, a monthly magazine that published articles on a variety of topics.

They share limited regions of sequence homology and a common tertiary structure architecture. This is an eight stranded antiparallel beta barrel with a repeated + 1 topology enclosing an internal ligand binding site. These proteins are found in gram negative bacteria, vertebrate cells, and invertebrate cells, and in plants. Lipocalins have been associated with many biological processes, among them immune response, pheromone transport, biological prostaglandin synthesis, retinoid binding, and cancer cell interactions.  Function   Immune response  Lipocalin proteins are involved in inflammation and detoxification processes caused by immune system activation in mammals. They are known respiratory allergens of mice, cats, dogs, horses, and other animals. Examples of lipocalin proteins involved in immune system responses include alpha-1-microglobulin, alpha-1-acid glycoprotein, and C8gamma. Structural information for many immune system influencing lipocalin proteins is available, while their exact role in biological systems is still somewhat unclear. Lipocalin allergens have been shown to evoke a Th2-deviated immune response, important for allergic sensitization, when applied in their apo-form (with an empty calyx devoid of ligands), whereas the holo-form seemed to exert immune-suppressive properties in vitro.  Pheromone transport  The lipocalin family has been connected with the transport of mammalian pheromones due to easily observable protein-pheromone interactions. Lipocalins are comparatively small in size, and are thus less complicated to study as opposed to large, bulky proteins. They can also bind to various ligands for different biological purposes. Lipocalins have been detected as carrier proteins of important pheromones in the nasal mucus of rodents. Major urinary proteins, a lipocalin subfamily, are found in mouse and rat urine and may act as protein pheromones themselves.  Prostaglandin synthesis  This family of proteins plays a part in the biological system of terminal prostaglandin synthesis.  Retinoid binding  Retinol, (vitamin A), is an important micronutrient that affects eyesight, cell differentiation, immune system function, bone growth, and tumor suppression. Retinol absorption and metabolism depends on lipocalins that act as binding proteins. Retinyl esters (present in meats) and beta- carotene (present in plants) are the two main sources of retinoids in the diet. After intake, they are converted to retinol, successively metabolized, and finally bound to retinol binding proteins (lipocalins) in the blood plasma. Cancer cell interactions Because lipocalins are extracellular proteins, their intracellular effects are not obvious, and demand further study. However, lipophilic ligands, present as substituents to the lipocalins, have the ability to enter the cell, where they can act as tumor protease inhibitors. This research suggests another possible route of protein-tumor investigations.  Allergens  Some of the proteins in this family are allergens. Allergies are hypersensitivity reactions of the immune system to specific substances called allergens (such as pollen, stings, drugs, or food) that, in most people, result in no symptoms. A nomenclature system has been established for antigens (allergens) that cause IgE-mediated atopic allergies in humans.[WHO/IUIS Allergen Nomenclature Subcommittee King T.P., Hoffmann D., Loewenstein H., Marsh D.G., Platts-Mills T.A.E., Thomas W. Bull. World Health Organ. 72:797-806(1994)] This nomenclature system is defined by a designation that is composed of the first three letters of the genus; a space; the first letter of the species name; a space and an Arabic number. In the event that two species names have identical designations, they are discriminated from one another by adding one or more letters (as necessary) to each species designation. The allergens in this family include allergens with the following designations: Bla g 4, Bos d 2, Bos d 5, Can f 1, Can f 2, Fel d 4, Equ c 1 and Equ c 2. Hormone LCN2 (Lipocalin 2) acts as bone-derived hormone which crosses the BBB and acts on PVN paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus in the brain.  Structure  Although lipocalins are a broad family of greatly varied proteins, their three-dimensional structure is a unifying characteristic. Lipocalins have an eight-stranded, antiparallel, symmetrical Œ≤-barrel fold, which is, in essence, a beta sheet which has been rolled into a cylindrical shape. Inside this barrel is located a ligand binding site, which plays an important role in the lipocalin classification as a transport protein. If lipocalins are genetically engineered in the attempt to modify their binding properties, they are called anticalins.  Family members  The name \\"lipocalin\\" has been proposed for this protein family, but cytosolic fatty acid binding proteins are also included. The sequences of most members of the family, the core or kernel lipocalins, are characterised by three short conserved stretches of residues, while others, the outlier lipocalin group, share only one or two of these. Proteins known to belong to this family include alpha-1-microglobulin (protein HC); major urinary proteins; alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (orosomucoid); aphrodisin; apolipoprotein D; beta- lactoglobulin; complement component C8 gamma chain; crustacyanin; epididymal- retinoic acid binding protein (E-RABP); insectacyanin; odorant binding protein (OBP); human pregnancy-associated endometrial alpha-2 globulin (PAEP); probasin (PB), a prostatic protein; prostaglandin D synthase; purpurin; Von Ebner's gland protein (VEGP); and lizard epididymal secretory protein IV (LESP IV). Human proteins that contain lipocalin domain include: * AMBP, APOD * C8G, CRABP1, CRABP2 * FABP1, FABP2, FABP3, FABP4, FABP5, FABP6, FABP7 * LCN1, LCN2, LCN8, LCN9, LCN10, LCN12 * OBP2A, OBP2B * ORM1, ORM2 * PAEP, PERF15, PMP2, PTGDS * RBP1, RBP2, RBP4, RBP5, RBP7 * UNQ2541 See also * Retinol binding protein  References  Further reading   * External links * Lipocalins in SCOP database * - Calculated spatial positions of some Lipocalins in membranes Category:Protein families ","title":"Lipocalin"},{"id":"8061720","text":"'Anne Pitoniak (March 30, 1922 ‚Äì April 22, 2007) was an American actress.

Early life Emerton was born at Salem, Massachusetts, on March 31, 1847. He was rather frail, and a young helper in his father's drug store, George F. Markoe, interested the boy in outdoor life. They collected plants, insects and shore invertebrates and at the age of fifteen he was frequently visiting the Essex Institute, where he became acquainted with A. S. Packard, F. W. Putnam, John Robinson, Caleb Cooke, and others who later became more or less prominent students of Natural History. From the first, he showed much skill in drawing and made sketches of a great variety of natural objects. Of these early drawings, there are many in Packard's Guide and forty quarto plates in Watson and Eaton Botany of the Fortieth Parallel published in 1871. Professional life He was elected to the Boston Society of Natural History in 1870, and later, 1873-1874 was an assistant in the Museum. While here he prepared the notes to Hentz's spiders of the United States and the article on cave spiders of Indiana and Kentucky (1875). He had already decided to study spiders, had collected in over 100 localities in the New England states, and had amassed a collection of more than 300 species. Early in 1875 he left the Boston Society to spend more than a year in Europe. While there he was enrolled as a student for a short time at the University of Leipzig (October, 1875 to April, 1876) and later (May to July, 1876) at the University of Jena, but apparently he spent much time collecting spiders and becoming acquainted with the arachnologists of Europe, particularly O. P. Cambridge, Simon, Koch, Thorell and Ohlert. He had taken to Europe his collection of New England spiders and from Leipzig in December, 1875, wrote an article comparing them with those of the European fauna. Returning, he again engaged in drawing and prepared many of the colored plates in Eaton's Ferns of North America and also many in Packard's Monograph of the Geometridae. In 1877, he gave eight lectures on zoology and six on spiders at the Summer School of Biology in Salem, and in 1878 delivered another series of six lectures on spiders. He became a curator in the Museum of the Peabody Academy of Science where he spent an hour each day with the visitors and prepared a Guide to the Museum. In 1879 he also gave instruction in the zoological laboratory at Salem. He spent some time at Albany, N. Y., making drawings for Prof. A. Hall, and later (about 1880) went to New Haven, where he was appointed assistant to Professor A. E. Verrill. He made a host of drawings for Verrill, and prepared the famous models of the great squid and octopus now in the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Cambridge and in the National Museum of Natural History at Washington. For these models he was awarded a medal with an elaborately engraved certificate at the International Fisheries Congress in London in 1882. At New Haven in 1884 he married Mary A. Hills, and shortly thereafter moved to Boston, which was henceforth his home. His wife died in 1898. He did much modeling for medical colleges and made drawings for many persons; as Minot's Textbook of Embryology, Verrill's Marine Invertebrates, Scudder's Butterflies of New England, Peckham's papers on spiders, and many for the U. S. Fish Commission. He was active in various natural history organizations and became an important factor in furthering interest in local science. He began to travel more widely, visiting the West Indies in 1893 with Alexander Agassiz, going with Morse in 1902 to the Southern States, in 1905 to the Californian Mountains, in 1914 to the Canadian Rockies, in 1920 to the Hudson Bay Region. On these and numerous shorter trips he industriously collected spiders. He became much interested in a Federation of New England Natural History Societies, and this he considered as the most useful way of stimulating interest in Natural History. He was the Secretary and principal support of this society until his death. He always seemed to be in good health, and collected spiders only a few months before his death, December 5, 1931. Aside from being a naturalist he was an artist for the sake of art. He painted hundreds of water colors, often depicting the sea, the shore, or ships. For several seasons this was done at Ipswich, and in later years he went regularly in July to Gloucester for painting. He frequently exhibited before art societies, and lived for many years in an artist's studio apartment. His principal interest and work was on the taxonomy and distribution of the spiders of New England and Canada. His method of sifting leaves, moss and detritus brought to light great numbers of the smaller forms. At first he sent these to O. P. Cambridge in England, who described them; later he began his famous series of New England Spiders, publishing the Theridiidae in 1882. The plates in these papers were especially valuable; those in the second part (Epeiridae) containing some of his finest drawings. It is these illustrations that give the characteristic appearance of the parts which have given to Emerton much of his importance as an arachnologist. Cambridge, in reviewing Hentz's Spiders of the United States (Nature, 1876) refers to Emexton's two plates as follows:-\\"In point of accurate detail and artistic finish these figures are immeasurably in advance of those engraved from Hentz's drawings.\\" The series on New England spiders was followed by four supplements, two papers on Canadian spiders and numerous smaller articles, describing in all over 350 species, always with useful illustrations. No other writer has so thoroughly figured his species, old as well as new. In several papers he traced the distribution of certain northern spiders. Several of his early articles dealt with the habits of spiders and, even to the last, he loved to watch each autumn for the flying spiders. He gave to the Museum of Comparative Zoology the first set of the types of his descriptions. Taxa names after Emerton Among the taxa named after J. H.

Purpose and membership The College recognizes Texas lawyers who voluntarily attend at least double the minimum Continuing Legal Education (CLE) classes required by the State Bar of Texas. While the State Bar of Texas mandates that every licensed attorney complete at least fifteen hours of continuing legal education classes each year, the College requires its members to double that number by attending thirty hours per year. As of 2006, it was the only organization in the United States formed for the specific purpose of promoting and recognizing attorneys who strive to maintain and enhance their professional skills and the quality of their practice through voluntary participation in CLE programs. Historically, only about eight percent of the licensed attorneys in Texas (4,100 out of 63,500 in 1999) meet the requirements for membership in the College of the State Bar of Texas. The motto of the College is: \\"Professionalism Through Education.\\" Since 1993, the College of the State Bar has each year presented a lawyer with the Jim Bowmer Professionalism Award, an annual honor established to recognize members who have significantly contributed to professionalism within the legal community, as well as a Franklin Jones Best CLE Article Award and a Steve Condos Most CLE Hours Award. History Jim D. Bowmer and Franklin Jones, Jr., both past presidents of the State Bar of Texas, credit each other with starting the College of the State Bar. Mr. Bowmer, who believed that lawyers in Texas should be given recognition for attending programs of continuing legal education, urged Mr. Jones to persuade the Board of Directors of the State Bar of Texas to adopt the idea for the College. At the request of the Board of the Directors of the State Bar of Texas, the College was established by the Texas Supreme Court on December 14, 1981. In June 2001, the Board of the State Bar voted to change the status of the College from a standing committee of the Bar to a \\"bar- related entity.\\" On October 25, 2001, the Texas Supreme Court amended its 1981 order establishing the College of the State Bar (Misc. Docket No. 01-9180) and directed it to pursue incorporation under the Texas Non-Profit Corporation Act. As a qualifying non-profit corporation, the College applied for and received Section 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status under the United States Internal Revenue Code.

In particular, the term refers to US state-based organizations affiliated with Focus on the Family (FotF), a conservative Christian organization. Family Policy Councils work for policies that FotF describes as \\"pro-family\\". These include opposition to same-sex marriage, LGBT adoption, and LGBT workplace protections, and support for abstinence-only sex education, increased legal restrictions on abortion and traditional Christian gender roles. FPCs also work to shape public opinion, organize political demonstrations, and cultivate future politicians. The term \\"Family Policy Council\\" has also historically referred to government entities on a couple of occasions. A Washington state coalition of state agencies named Family Policy Council operated from 1992 to 2012. A proposed Delaware government entity was also named Family Policy Council in 1993. The existence of Focus on the Family's affiliated FPCs has spurred the development of other, sometimes opposing policy organizations. An example is OutNebraska, a \\"statewide LGBTQ advocacy organization\\" that works against policy goals of Nebraska Family Alliance Origins Focus on the Family (FotF) states that the first Family Policy Council opened in 1988. The early history of FPCs was kept \\"behind the scenes\\" by FotF. Michael Jameson, a FotF representative, spoke about FotF's nascent effort to create \\"pro-family\\" organizations in US states to \\"affect legislation and to affect our culture\\" at 1989 Denver meeting of conservative policy groups. The United Methodist Reporter wrote that while FotF \\"is helping pro-family groups create coalitions, at the same time it is urging them to keep secret their participation in the coalition and even that a coalition exists.\\" Jameson explained that \\"the coalitions can be more effective with a low profile and by leaving their public identity to the groups comprising the coalitions.\\" Religion journalist Frederick Clarkson has stated that FotF \\"often has selected and reshaped an existing state-level organization rather than create a Family Policy Council from scratch.\\" For example, Citizens for Community Values was a Cincinnati anti-pornography organization founded in 1983 before it was reshaped into the official Family Policy Council for Ohio in 1991. The Wisconsin Family Council was founded as Family Research Institute of Wisconsin to advocate for corporal punishment in religious schools in 1986. The Minnesota Family Council was previously known as The Berean League, \\"a publisher of anti-gay literature.\\" These organizations were taken under the FotF umbrella. An organization named \\"Family Policy Council\\" was active in Richmond, Virginia 1989; it was formed to oppose sex education. Later organizations with names that contain \\"Family Policy Council\\" include North Carolina Family Policy Council, founded in 1992. Family Policy Councils are loosely based on the FotF-affiliated lobbying group Family Research Council, which states: \\"Family Policy Councils (FPCs) accomplish at the state level what Family Research Council does at the national level - shape public debate and formulate public policy.\\" Operations Family Policy Councils sometimes divide their operations into legal entities with differing tax status. For example, Colorado Family Action is a 501(c)(4) organization, which can legally do more government lobbying than its sibling Colorado Family Action Foundation, a 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to shaping culture. As of 2019, Family Research Council's website lists FPCs for 41 states; 39 of these are also listed by Family Policy Alliance. Family Policy Alliance is FotF's state government lobbying arm and liaison to the FPCs. FPCs' work is socially conservative. FPCs sometimes coordinate their work with, and exchange staff with, a network of fiscal conservative organizations called State Policy Network (SPN). A few organizations are both FPC and SPN members, for example, Alabama Policy Institute. Impact Family Policy Councils advocated for state bans on same-sex marriage in the 1990s and 2000s, many of which passed into law. A University of Arizona statistical study of the bans concluded that the \\"measure of Family Policy Council strength in a state increases the probability of adopting a same-sex marriage ban.\\" An example is Ohio's gay marriage ban, spearheaded by the Ohio FPC in 2004. A lawsuit against the Ohio ban lead to Obergefell v. Hodges, the US Supreme Court decision that legalized gay marriage nationwide in 2015.

Around 95% of the 30,000 residents are Hokkien Chinese, and Hokkien is the main language used locally.Jenjarom, a friendly Hokkien new village, Sin Chew Daily, 19 Apr 2014 The majority of the Hokkien population trace their roots to the Fujianese counties of Yongchun, Anxi, Nan'an and Dehua. Other residents are mostly Chinese Hakka or Teochew, along with small Indian and Tamil communities. History In the early 20th century, Jenjoram was an agricultural village, with around a dozen shops along the main street. Pig farming was significant in the surrounding areas. Fewer than 20 families were Chinese. During the Malayan Emergency in the 1950s, as part of the Briggs Plan to cut off supplies to the (mostly Chinese) Communist insurgents, New Villages were set up to segregate rural Chinese villagers from the insurgents. Jenjarom was one of them and is today the largest such 'village' in the state.Utar New Village Community Project Report, Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman undergraduate project, Sept 2011 In 1950 and 1951 the population grew rapidly to around 5,000. In the early years of independent Malaysia, on 26 April 1967, Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman visited the burgeoning town and announced an upgrade to its infrastructure, which was then implemented under the Second Malaysia Plan. Industrial activity in Jenjarom increased, along with the development of palm oil production in the surrounding land.NZ's role in the Malaysian plastics dumping ground, Radio New Zealand: Insight, 23 September 2018 In the 1990s, following a period of high youth unemployment, the town became known for various social ills, including gangsterism, gambling, prostitution and drug trafficking. In the nine years to 2000, Jenjarom's population more than doubled, to 24,483.Population and Housing Census of Malaysia 2000 (Table 9), Dept of Statistics Malaysia By the turn of the century, these troubles had abated. Attractions Jenjarom is the site of the Fo Guang Shan Dong Zen Temple (‰ΩõÂÖâÂ±±Êù±Á¶™ÂØ∫) and Institute in Sungai Jarom. Though this predominantly serves the Chinese Buddhist population, the non- Chinese community benefits from the tourism it attracts: there were about a quarter of a million visitors in 2004.

Education Keroack was a graduate of Amherst College. He received his doctorate of medicine in 1986 from Tufts University where he was a member of the Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Society and later Resident of the Year (1993). He was a Fellow of the American College of Obstetrician Gynecologists [(FACOG)], and a clinician with nearly two decades of experience serving women from diverse racial and socio-economic backgrounds. Career Keroack was the medical director of A Woman's Concern, a Christian nonprofit organization based in Dorchester, Boston, Massachusetts. It runs six centers in the state that offer free pregnancy testing, ultrasounds and counseling and works to \\"help women escape the temptation and violence of abortion.\\" Its crisis pregnancy centers do not sell abortion services and do not prescribe or distribute birth control. In late 2006, he was named as the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Population Affairs at the Department of Health and Human Services, the office that oversees federally funded teenage pregnancy, family planning, and abstinence programs. The nomination of Keroack, an anti-contraceptive advocate, to a position responsible for ensuring low-income women get access to birth control was controversial.. Critics cited Keroack's opposition to legalized abortion without noting that the doctor had himself once performed abortions and provided abortifacients before later reversing his stance on legalized abortion, as did (among others) Bernard Nathanson, MD, an early founder of the National Abortion Rights Action League (NARAL).

Due to conformal property of Stereographic Projection, the curves intersect each other orthogonally (in the yellow points) as in 4D. All curves are circles or straight lines. The generatrices and parallels generates a 3D dual cone. The hypermeridians generates a set of concentric spheres. In geometry, a hypercone (or spherical cone) is the figure in the 4-dimensional Euclidean space represented by the equation :x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - w^2 = 0. It is a quadric surface, and is one of the possible 3-manifolds which are 4-dimensional equivalents of the conical surface in 3 dimensions. It is also named spherical cone because its intersections with hyperplanes perpendicular to the w-axis are spheres. A four-dimensional right spherical hypercone can be thought of as a sphere which expands with time, starting its expansion from a single point source, such that the center of the expanding sphere remains fixed. An oblique spherical hypercone would be a sphere which expands with time, again starting its expansion from a point source, but such that the center of the expanding sphere moves with a uniform velocity. Parametric form A right spherical hypercone can be described by the function : \\\\vec \\\\sigma (\\\\phi, \\\\theta, t) = (t s \\\\cos \\\\theta \\\\cos \\\\phi, t s \\\\cos \\\\theta \\\\sin \\\\phi, t s \\\\sin \\\\theta, t) with vertex at the origin and expansion speed s. An oblique spherical hypercone could then be described by the function : \\\\vec \\\\sigma (\\\\phi, \\\\theta, t) = (v_x t + t s \\\\cos \\\\theta \\\\cos \\\\phi, v_y t + t s \\\\cos \\\\theta \\\\sin \\\\phi, v_z t + t s \\\\sin \\\\theta, t) where (v_x, v_y, v_z) is the 3-velocity of the center of the expanding sphere. An example of such a cone would be an expanding sound wave as seen from the point of view of a moving reference frame: e.g. the sound wave of a jet aircraft as seen from the jet's own reference frame. Note that the 3D-surfaces above enclose 4D-hypervolumes, which are the 4-cones proper. Geometrical interpretation The spherical cone consists of two unbounded nappes, which meet at the origin and are the analogues of the nappes of the 3-dimensional conical surface. The upper nappe corresponds with the half with positive w-coordinates, and the lower nappe corresponds with the half with negative w-coordinates. If it is restricted between the hyperplanes w = 0 and w = r for some nonzero r, then it may be closed by a 3-ball of radius r, centered at (0,0,0,r), so that it bounds a finite 4-dimensional volume. This volume is given by the formula r4, and is the 4-dimensional equivalent of the solid cone. The ball may be thought of as the 'lid' at the base of the 4-dimensional cone's nappe, and the origin becomes its 'apex'. This shape may be projected into 3-dimensional space in various ways. If projected onto the xyz hyperplane, its image is a ball. If projected onto the xyw, xzw, or yzw hyperplanes, its image is a solid cone. If projected onto an oblique hyperplane, its image is either an ellipsoid or a solid cone with an ellipsoidal base (resembling an ice cream cone). These images are the analogues of the possible images of the solid cone projected to 2 dimensions. Construction The (half) hypercone may be constructed in a manner analogous to the construction of a 3D cone. A 3D cone may be thought of as the result of stacking progressively smaller discs on top of each other until they taper to a point. Alternatively, a 3D cone may be regarded as the volume swept out by an upright isosceles triangle as it rotates about its base. A 4D hypercone may be constructed analogously: by stacking progressively smaller balls on top of each other in the 4th direction until they taper to a point, or taking the hypervolume swept out by a tetrahedron standing upright in the 4th direction as it rotates freely about its base in the 3D hyperplane on which it rests. Temporal interpretation If the w-coordinate of the equation of the spherical cone is interpreted as the distance ct, where t is coordinate time and c is the speed of light (a constant), then it is the shape of the light cone in special relativity. In this case, the equation is usually written as: :x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - (ct)^2 = 0, which is also the equation for spherical wave fronts of light. The upper nappe is then the future light cone and the lower nappe is the past light cone.

History Before what is now the Riverway, this area was a Camping Reserve for the army's R72 and after the future of Camping Reserve (Renamed R326) was being debated and had been left unused, the then Thuringowa Shire Council made a decision that the area remain un-subdivided for community use, and with the demand for recreational space growing, along with the Upper Ross population, this area was the best location.History In 1970 poisoning and bulldozing of the Chinee Apple trees started, along with drainage works and mowing. The road that traveled along the river was closed to traffic and clubhouses and toilets were built on the site in 1971. It was a pre-war tradition to plant raintrees in the reserve and this was continued by the Thuringowa Council. These trees still stand today, shading the roadway into the Riverway. During the early 1970s the Thuringowa Council and residents entered into discussion's about what to name the reserve, suggestions including: Upper Ross Sports Complex, The Kirwan Sports Reserve, Vickers Park, Ross River Memorial Park and Upper Ross Memorial Park, however the Thuringowa Council officially named the reserve the Pioneer Sporting Complex in October 1971. Over the years, Pioneer Sporting Complex had many small upgrades and was and still is used by many sporting teams and clubs,About Us and became better known as 'Pioneer Park',.Pioneer Park & Ross River - Things To See and Do - Queensland Holidays However, as the population of Thuringowa was growing at a fast rate the need for more recreational activities in the area also increased.,Heritage Construction Riverway Stage One included the construction of two swimming lagoons, the Riverway Arts Centre, Pinnacles Gallery, the Riverwalk, public art, village spine and parklands.

He served in the Virginia House of Burgesses, the General Assembly, and the Court of Appeals, predecessor of the Supreme Court of Virginia. Biography Robert Carter Nicholas was the son of Dr. George Nicholas and Elizabeth Carter Burwell Nicholas (widow of Nathaniel Burwell) of Williamsburg, Virginia. His father was a British convict, transported for forgery. His mother was the daughter of wealthy Virginia landowner, Robert \\"King\\" Carter of Corotoman. Born January 28, 1728/9, both of his parents were dead by 1734. Nicholas studied law at the College of William and Mary and practiced in the general court under the royal government. He served in the House of Burgesses, 1755-61 as the representative from York County, and from 1766-1775 as the representative of James City County, and was Treasurer for the colony of Virginia, 1766-1775. From 1761 to 1774, Nicholas was one of the trustees of the Bray school - a charity school for black children - in Williamsburg, Virginia. He was the principal correspondent with Dr. Bray's Associates in England, who financed the school. In October 1765 Nicholas, along with John Randolph and George Wythe, was part of committee that heard Thomas Jefferson's bar examinations. Later when Nicholas became Treasurer of Virginia, he stopped taking new cases and turned over many of his existing cases to Jefferson. When in 1769 Peyton Randolph, Speaker of the House of Burgesses, chose Thomas Jefferson to write a response to Royal Governor Lord Botetourt's opening remarks to the House, his motions although accepted and passed were felt in committee to be \\"lean and tepid\\" requiring rewrite by Nicholas. Jefferson never forgot this humiliation. In fact, in 1774 Jefferson had to rewrite a motion written by Nicholas objecting to the next Royal Governor Lord Dunmore's land proclamation. Also in May 1774, Nicholas introduced a motion written by Thomas Jefferson making June 1 a \\"day of fasting, humiliation, and prayer\\" to express sympathy of Virginia for their sister colony of Massachusetts as a result of the closing of the Port of Boston by the British under the Boston Port Act. On December 13, 1775 Nicholas after the battle of Great Bridge introduced a motion in the House of Burgesses denouncing Lord Dunmore as champion of \\"tyranny\\" a monster, \\"inimical and cruel\\" for pronouncing martial law and assuming powers, the \\"King himself could not exercise.\\" Two days later he also submitted a motion to grant pardons to black slaves who he claimed had been deluded by the British to join Loyalist forces. Nicholas opposed the adoption of the Declaration of Independence, but he was a member of the committee appointed to draft a declaration of rights and a new form of government for Virginia. He was a member of the Virginia General Assembly from 1776 to 1778 and in 1779 was appointed to the high court of chancery. Consequently, he became a member of the first Court of Appeals, predecessor of the Supreme Court of Virginia. Judge Nicholas died the next year in 1780. Nicholas married Anne Cary, daughter of Wilson Cary of Warwick County in 1751 and the couple had four daughters and six sons. His grandson, Robert C. Nicholas was a United States Senator from Louisiana, and his daughter Elizabeth (1753‚Äì1810) married Edmund Randolph, the first United States Attorney General. His son-in-law, Edmund Randolph described him: \\"By nature he was benevolent and liberal. But he appeared to many who did not thoroughly understand him, to be haughty and austere; because they could not appreciate the preference of gravity for levity, when in conversation the sacredness of religion was involved in ridicule or language forgot its chastity.\\" References *History.org short biography *Journal of the House of Burgesses *Golladay, Victor Dennis. \\"The Nicholas Family of Virginia, 1722-1820,\\" PhD Diss, University of Virginia, 1973. *Randall, William Sterne. \\"Thomas Jefferson, A Life\\"  External links  * Category:1780 deaths Category:College of William & Mary alumni Robert Carter Nicholas 1 Category:Justices of the Virginia Supreme Court Category:Virginia lawyers Category:Virginia state court judges Category:People of Virginia in the American Revolution Category:House of Burgesses members Category:Carter family of Virginia Category:Cary family of Virginia Category:Virginia colonial people Category:1720s births Category:18th-century American politicians ","title":"Robert Carter Nicholas Sr."},{"id":"8062163","text":"Taebaek Line is a single-track electrified railway mainline connecting Jecheon Station to Baeksan Station in South Korea. At its two ends, the Taebaek Line connects to the Jungang Line and Yeongdong Line. The line was originally two spur lines, which were built across difficult mountainous terrain in stages, before a connection was built. The line includes the steepest section of the South Korean network, a short parallel line that is operated as a second track on the section includes South Korea's longest spiral tunnel. The centerpiece of the last-built section west of Taebaek, is a tunnel that was the longest in South Korea at the time of its construction, and Chujeon Station at the eastern end of the tunnel is the highest altitude in South Korea at . In passenger traffic, the line is served by cross-country passenger trains connecting the capital Seoul with Korea's east coast. In freight traffic, while coal transport declined, the line carries significant cement transport. In the winter, regular special trains take tourists along the scenic route. History This line was originally planned by the privately owned Chosen Railway as an extension of its Chungbuk Line; however, the end of Japanese rule in Korea led to this plan being abandoned for many years. In 1949, the Economic Cooperation Administration, the United States government agency administering the Marshall Plan, also launched a plan to revive South Korea's economy, which included the construction of new railway lines. One new line under the plan was a line from Jecheon to the coal mines around Yeongwol and Hambaek to the east. Construction started in August 1949, but was interrupted by the Korean War in 1950, work resumed in October 1952. The Jecheon‚ÄìYeongwol section, with an original length of , went into service as the Yeongwol Line on December 30, 1955. On March 9, 1957, the line was extended by to Hambaek, and was renamed the Hambaek Line. Following the 1961 coup, the Supreme Council for National Reconstruction started South Korea's first five-year plan, which included a construction program to complete the railway network, to foster economic growth. One of the first lines completed under the plan was the Hwangji Branchline, which would later become the eastern end of the Taebaek Line. The long spur from Baeksan on the Cheoram Line (today the Yeongdong Line) to Hwangji (renamed Taebaek in 1984) opened on December 20, 1962. Another project under the five-year plan was a railway between Yemi on the Hambaek Line and Jeongseon. The section climbing the mountains around Hambaek to Jeongsan (renamed Mindungsan in 2009), which would later become part of the Taebaek Line, was completed on December 19, 1966, and the entire railway from Jecheon to Jeongseon was renamed the Jeongseon Line, with the short Yemi‚ÄìHambaek branch retaining the Hambaek Line name. A long track section on the climb after Yemi is the steepest on South Korea's network at 30.3‚Ä∞. Also on December 19, 1966, a branch from Jeongsan to Gohan opened as the Gohan Line, which would also become part of the future Taebaek Line. The Jeongseon Line was completed to Jeongseon on January 20, 1967; this section and its later extensions form the present-day Jeongseon Line. Monument at Chujeon Station marking it as the highest-altitude station on the South Korean network. The long gap between the Gohan and Hwangji branch lines was plugged on October 16, 1973, when the entire railway from Jecheon to the junction with the Yeongdong Line at Baeksan was renamed the Taebaek Line. The centerpiece of the last section was the long Jeongam Tunnel, which was the longest in South Korea before the opening of longer tunnels on the Jeolla Line and the Gyeongbu High Speed Railway, and Chujeon Station at the eastern end of the tunnel is the one on the highest altitude in South Korea at above the sea. Upgrade The line was among the first foreseen for electrification with the 25 kV/60 Hz system in South Korea. Works started in 1972, already before the Taebaek Line was completed and officially renamed. The first trial run under the new voltage system in South Korea was conducted with a Class 8000 electric locomotive on the Jeongsan‚ÄìGohan section, then called the Gohan Line, on June 9, 1972. Regular electric service started on the long Jecheon‚ÄìGohan section on June 20, 1974. The rest of the line was electrified together with the section of the connecting Yeongdong Line until Donghae on the east coast, altogether , on December 5, 1975. At the same time, the Taebaek Triangle Line, a connection built for trains from Jecheon to Donghae to run without reversal at Baeksan, was also put in service. To improve traffic on the steep climb from Yemi to Jodong, the Hambaek Line was extended to Jodong to provide a second track. The altitude difference was mastered with a spiral tunnel, the Hambaek 1 Tunnel, which was South Korea's longest spiral tunnel at . The altogether long Hambaek‚ÄìJodok link was completed on December 30, 1976. The electrification of altogether around the Hambaek Line went into service on April 1, 1977. The first of the line from Jecheon to Ssangyong, which is nearing capacity with cement transport and mass transit, is being double-tracked for a higher capacity with a budget of 377.323 billion won, with a targeted opening in 2011. Operation In passenger traffic, the Taebaek Line is served by Mugunghwa-ho cross-country trains. In the timetable valid from December 15, 2010, six pairs of daily trains run along the entire length of the line, reinforced by a seventh pair on Fridays to Sundays, with Jecheon‚ÄìTaebaek travel times between 1 hour 49 minutes and 1 hour 58 minutes, depending on the number of stops. These trains connect Cheongnyangni Station in the capital Seoul and Gangneung Station on Korea's east coast, using sections of the connecting Jungang and Yeongdong Lines to reach the Taebaek Line. The Cheongnyangni‚ÄìTaebaek travel time is between 3 hours 45 minutes and 4 hours 12 minutes, depending on the number of stops. The Jecheon‚ÄìMindungsan section is also served by two pairs of daily trains running between Jecheon and Auraji on the Jeongseon Line. On every 2nd, 7th, 12th, 17th, 22nd and 27th day of the month, one of these train pairs is extended to run between Cheongnyangni and Auraji as the \\"Jeongseon 5-Day Market Train\\", to transport passengers to and from the Jeongseon 5-Day Market. In 1998, Korean National Railroad (today Korail) introduced special tourist trains operating in the winter months, identified by a snowflake decoration, which enjoyed great popularity. Most of these trains also traverse the Taebaek Line. By the 2009/2010 season, the offer expanded to a dozen different tour packages, including trips to single destinations combined with local excursions, as well as round trips in the Taebaek Mountains along the Jungang, Taebaek, Jeongseon and Yeongdong Lines. According to Korail's plans in 2009, travel times on the Taebaek Line are to be reduced after 2013 with the future series version of the Tilting Train Express. The coal yard in Chujeon Station in 2007. The line is also carries significant freight transport. The line was originally built primarily to serve coal mines along it, but coal transport declined in the nineties when the government rationalised the coal industry and closed down mines in the region. In the 2000s, cement transport from Ssangyong brings significant freight traffic to the line. July 22, 2014, two passenger trains collided head-on between Taebaek and Mungok stations, killing one person and injuring 92 others. It was suspected that one of them missed a traffic signal. The accident occurred on a single-track railway and a tourist train was supposed to have temporarily stopped to let a commuter train leave.

Among these cities, Essex County in Massachusetts own the highest amount of preserved First Period architecture mimicking British architecture styles, The majority of first arrivals are non-separatist Puritans, who seek for rebuilding the Church of England in America and hence set up the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1629, while the minority of the first colonists are puritans desire to distance themselves from the Church of England, these religious believers did not have any architecture background, their jobs are farmers, traders, artisans. Therefore, traditional medieval design didn't fit new England well in the beginning, adjustments were made gradually by colonists based on local environments until professional architects appeared. Typical features *Face south *Central chimney *Asymmetrical rooftop *Small diamond shaped casement window Due to cold weather in winter, mass mortality of colonists happened in 1630. To adapt better with geographical conditions, First Period houses are built facing south to optimize sunlight and heat up the whole house. Moreover, First Period houses are often constructed with central chimney, distinctive style in that era, this is because it needs to maintain enough space for fireplaces and secure sufficient air is led to the stove to burn clean. Another characteristic of First Period architecture is asymmetrical rooftop. It is designed to maximize the heat from south and minimize the coldness from the north, also, it has the function of preventing heavy snow accumulation. Besides, windows are casements, paired with strips of iron, and at that time are small due to shortage of glass. Interior features *Heavy oak frame *Exposed chamfered summer beams (front room) *L shaped staircases Inside the houses, a heavy oak frame and thick beams (about 8 to 12 inches) are used to maintain the house structure, and walls are furnished with clay and twigs to protect the houses from severe weather condition, and staircases are created in L shape to match the design of centred chimney. Types of buildings Barker Tavern in Scituate Massachusetts MA also known as the Williams-Barker House circa 1634 House It is essential to note that new settlers found adequate amount of wood and mud in New England but little materials to mix them, they decided design the house with solid wooden structure and natural resources to acclimatize themselves to long and cold winter and short time suitable for agriculture. Hence, wooden English cottages emerged in large numbers with thick clapboards nailed to the outside. However, houses in new England are not unified, the Puritans dislodged some people to Rhode Island and Connecticut River valley and later more untrammelled colonists from other part of England. Compared with former architectures erected by the Puritans, their style is more chilled and laissez-faire, mixed with individual personality. Another English architecture style is brought to new England in first period is fa√ßade gable, its purpose is to direct the rainwater away and introduce light to the attics, which is abandoned in the later Georgian style, an advanced version of First Period styles but more modern, demands highly symmetrical design. *Example Williams-Barker House is a heritage house, its foundation finished in 1634 by house owner, John Williams, who is one of the earliest English immigrant in New England. From the outside, it could be seen that the timber frame supports the shape of the house and there is a central chimney to ventilate, few casement windows and a steep roof. Inside of the house, the ceiling is fairly low and wood beams are visible, fireplace is centred to ensure it heat up the house evenly and dining tables are placed surround it, due to its new use as a restaurant. Old Jail Barnstable MA 2014 Public buildings In colonial British North America, jails are one of the earliest appeared public buildings, they did not serve the role of imprisonment, but a pre-trial accommodation for defendants. In Massachusetts Bay Colony, colonists established regulations that immigrants should not breach the laws in England and then erected houses of correction for penalty. At that time, recognizance is well accepted by colonial judges, so only few amount of criminals went to the jail, the scale is much smaller compared with contemporary jail in United States. Moreover, the structure is different as well, the culprits live in cages or cabinets. A familial model is adopt in colonial jail system, jailers (and perhaps their family) live in the same building as the culprits . The jails imitates First Period residential places, built in wood structure and tight arranged planks. *Example Old jail established in Barnstable, Massachusetts has been used for 130 years since 1690, the maximum capacity of whole jail is 6-8 people. Cells are small and windows are reinforced with rectangle metals, there is one door in the front which is small as well with heavy bar locks, and clapboards are interlocked at the joints with massive amount of nails. Church OldShipChurchExterior Roof Framing, General View, Old Ship Church by the Historic American Buildings Survey Christianity was brought to the United States by early English colonists, the oldest First Period church was built in New Mexico in 1629, named San Estevan del Rey Mission Church, is still in use as a museum. And later in Virginia, Maryland and Massachusetts, few churches were constructed by Puritans following English medieval architecture styles in 17th century. Unlike Boston, cities like Plymouth and Hingham have not been restored to attract tourism, churches are well-maintained in original medieval architecture styling with centred fireplaces near the staircases. *Example Old ship church is one of the oldest church built by puritans in Hingham, Massachusetts and a well-preserved example of First Period architecture style. It is named after the shape of ceiling, which was inspired by its architects, carpenters from the early arrived English colonists. The wooden timber frame of the church and walls were constructed in 1681, and later in 1740s, galleries on the side were added.

In late 1944 he deployed to Europe as a first lieutenant in charge of a reconnaissance platoon. He witnessed the end of the Battle of the Bulge after the tide had turned in favor of the Allies and also was present during the fight for the bridge at Remagen. During the waning days of the war, he also briefly served as an observer on the staff of General Patton. After VE Day, Whiting served with the Army of Occupation in Europe until May 1946. During this time, he acted as counsel defending minor courts-martial cases and there developed a strong, lifelong interest in the law. Upon his discharge, Whiting entered the University of Virginia and graduated from law school in 1949. He was editor of the Law Review, first in his class and was elected as a member of The Order of the Coif and the Raven Society. He returned to Winchester and entered into the practice of law with J. Sloan Kuykendall, longtime Secretary of the Virginia Board of Law Examiners. They were joined later by Lewis Costello and the firm, Kuykendall, Whiting and Costello became the largest law firm in Winchester. Eventually the firm opened a branch office in Leesburg, Virginia. Whiting married Helen Patricia Stephenson (1928‚Äì1980) of Winchester, Virginia in 1953; they divorced in 1971. They had two children, Brian and John. He attended the First Presbyterian Church, where he taught adult and teen Sunday School classes for a number of years. After 31 years in private legal practice, Whiting was appointed in 1980 to the 26th Judicial Circuit of Virginia by Gov. John N. Dalton. Whiting was later elected by the General Assembly to serve on the Supreme Court of Virginia in 1987 following the retirement of Justice George M. Cochran. He was the first member of the Supreme Court of Virginia from the Winchester-Frederick County area in over 100 years. A major ruling unanimously handed down by the Virginia Supreme Court during Whiting's tenure was Timothy W. Spencer v Commonwealth,Spencer v. Commonwealth, 238 Va. 275, 384 S.E.2d 775 (1989) which was the first state supreme court ruling on the admissibility of DNA profiling. The Court's ruling on the admissibility of DNA evidence was later upheld at the federal appeals level and by the U.S. Supreme Court. Whiting served on the Court until he stepped down to Senior (semi-retired) status in 1995. Justice Whiting continued to serve the Court as a Senior Justice until 2002. During his tenure, Justice Whiting authored 235 opinions for the Court. To honor his service, the Supreme Court of Virginia convened a special session in Winchester, its first ever there, on July 17, 2002.Justice Whiting steps down from senior status ¬´ Virginia Lawyers Weekly.

His opposition to the Byrd Organization's policy of Massive Resistance helped integrate Virginia's schools.Washington Post obituary January 27, 2011 available at https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/obituaries-of- note-george-m-cochran-william-schreyer-wayne-grisham-bruce-gordon-bernd- eichinger/2011/01/26/ABu463Q_story.html. Early and Family Life Born in Staunton, George was the first born child of Peyton Cochran and his wife Susie Baldwin Robertson, both of prominent local families. On his mother's side, Cochran was descended from Alexander H.H. Stuart, a U.S. Congressman before the American Civil War who also helped organize the U.S. Department of the Interior under President Millard Fillmore. A.H.H. Stuart later helped negotiate the end of restrictions upon Confederate sympathizers as Reconstruction ended. Cochran's paternal grandfather of the same name served in the Confederate army as a quartermaster and other administrative positions, disappointed that poor eyesight disqualified him from the artillery position he wanted.Oral history available at https://scvahistory.org/justice-george- moffett-cochran-recordings/ Young George Cochran had a sister four years his junior and a brother a decade younger than himself, although he outlived them both. He attended Staunton's schools including Robert E. Lee High school, then Episcopal High School in Alexandria, Virginia. After graduating, Cochran began studying law at the University of Virginia, as had his father and grandfather. At the University of Virginia, he was a member of the Z Society and Beta Theta Pi; he resided on The Lawn. Cochran received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1934 and a LL.B. degree in 1936 from the University of Virginia Law School. He was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and the Raven Society as an alumnus. In 1946, Cochran married Marion Lee Stuart. Legal and political career After graduation Cochran initially practiced law in Baltimore, Maryland for two years, but struggled financially. He returned to Staunton in 1936, became a member of the Virginia bar and began practicing law with his father. Six years later, World War II erupted, and Cochran served in the U.S. Navy, mostly in the Pacific from 1942 until 1946, as he refused desk and legal jobs and sought those involving amphibious service. In 1964, the former family law firm became Cochran, Lotz and Black. From 1947-1969, Cochran also was a trustee of Staunton's Planter's Bank and Trust Company, and was the bank's president during the last six of those years. After the war, University of Virginia trustee Emily Pancake Smith urged Cochran to run for the Legislature, and he later worked with her on the Woodrow Wilson Centennial in France and Staunton in 1950. Cochran also later served on the Board of Visitors at Virginia Tech (1960-1968) and Mary Baldwin College (1967-1981) and as a trustee of the Virginia Historical Society. Cochran won election unopposed to the Virginia House of Delegates in 1947, representing Augusta and Highland Counties and the cities of Staunton and Waynesboro. He served from 1948 to 1965 (that becoming the 10th district after the post 1960 census redistricting). The Senate of Virginia had major redistricting in 1965. Cochran ran in what had become the 19th District (comprising Augusta, Rockbridge, Highland, Buena Vista Counties and the cities of Staunton, Waynesboro and Lexington) and would soon become the 21st district). Augusta, Bath and Highland Counties and the cities of Staunton and Waynesboro had been in the 21st district in 1963 and 22nd district in 1961, and represented by longtime Byrd lieutenant Curry Carter (who had narrowly defeated Republican Winston Wine in 1961).http://historical.elections.virginia.gov/elections/search/year_from:1960/year_to:1968/office_id:9/district_id:27284 Now, Democrat Cochran won overwhelmingly, with over 94% of the vote against Republican Winston Wine, who won just 5%.http://historical.elections.virginia.gov/elections/search/year_from:1960/year_to:1968/office_id:9/district_id:27282 Cochran only served two years in the Virginia Senate, because after the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Davis v. Mann, another new redistricting plan took effect and Republican H. Dunlop Dawbarn of Waynesboro defeated him in the next election, perhaps as a result of sympathy for losing his wife, or outrage over Cochran's distancing himself from the Byrd Organization. In the General Assembly, Cochran had been one of the \\"Young Turks\\", World War II veterans who disagreed with the Byrd Organization on many education and civil rights issues, although he was not as liberal as Armistead Boothe of Alexandria. They introduced measures to abolish Jim Crow laws and the Poll Tax, which didn't pass until much later; and the Organization retaliated by limiting their committee assignments. Like Boothe, Mosby Perrow Jr. and Tayloe Murphy, Cochran advocated keeping schools open during Virginia's \\"Massive Resistance,\\" whereby U.S. Senator Harry F. Byrd, Sr. vowed to prevent public school desegregation after the Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decisions. After January 19, 1959, when both a three-judge federal panel and the Virginia Supreme Court declared the Stanley Plan of various laws adopted in a special 1956 legislative session unconstitutional, Governor J. Lindsay Almond Jr. and Lieutenant Governor Gi Stephens broke with the Byrd Organization's decision to continue Massive Resistance. They narrowly secured legislative approval of a commission chaired by Senator Perrow to craft the Commonwealth's response to Brown II. Cochran was among the Perrow Commission's members, and later described its work in dismantling Massive Resistance for the Augusta Historical Society.http://mlkcommission.dls.virginia.gov/va_school_closings/pdfs/Cochrane%20Augusta%20Historical%20Bulletin.pdf Historian Katharine Brown considered Cochran \\"one of just a small handful of people that had the courage to buck the dominant opinion in Virginia of massive resistance....That took courage and was a remarkable thing that he did.\\"Charles Bishop Jr., \\"Byrd Machine no match for Cochran, Young Turks\\" Staunton News Leader, January 25, 2011. available at https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/newsleader/access/2250032581.html (not accessed 2016-07-24 Cochran later took pride in helping to convince Governor Mills E. Godwin, another of the Massive Resistance leaders, to support creation of Virginia's community college system. President of the Virginia Bar Association in 1966, Cochran also served as a member of the Constitutional Revision Commission of Virginia in 1968-69. He was also a fellow of the American Bar Foundation, and of the American College of Probate Law, as well as charter fellow of the Virginia Bar Foundation. From 1986 until his death, Cochran also chaired the Frontier Culture Museum of Virginia in Staunton.Peter Veith, \\"REtired Sustice George M. Cochran passes away at 98\\" Virginia Lawyers Weekly January 31, 2011 Judicial career Since both Chief Justice John W. Eggleston and Justice Archibald C. Buchanan announced their retirements from the Supreme Court of Appeals on the same day, Governor Mills E. Godwin Jr. had two slots to fill. He had already promised his first appointment to that court to Attorney General Albertis Harrison (who had unsuccessfully defended the Massive Resistance cases in court). From the list of attorneys suggested by the Virginia Bar Association, Godwin nominated Cochran to fill the other vacant seat. Fellow legislators approved his nomination in August 1969, and also elected him to a full 12-year term in 1973. Cochran retired from active service on the Court on his 75th birthday in 1987, but continued to sit as a retired Justice for many years. In 1995, Cochran and his wife Lee were named Outstanding Virginians. Death and legacy Cochran died at his home in Staunton on Saturday, January 22, 2011, aged 98, and was buried at Staunton's Thornrose Cemetery after a service at Trinity Episcopal Church, on whose vestry he had served for many years.Obituary: George Moffett Cochran Richmond Times Dispatch, January 24, 2011.https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/90777464 On March 24, 2011, Staunton's City Council renamed the City Court building the George M.

First Formation (August - November 1941)  General Andrei Yeremenko was designated commander of the Front when it first formed in mid- late August 1941, comprising, in Erickson's words, \\"on paper two armies, 50th and 13th, with eight rifle divisions each, three cavalry divisions, and one tank division but many of these formations were badly whittled down by battle losses.\\"*John Erickson, The Road to Stalingrad, London, 1975 Two other armies from Soviet Central Front, 21st and 3rd Army, which had avoided encirclement at the Battle of Smolensk (1941), were promised but also badly worn down. In late August along with the Western Front and the Reserve Front, the Bryansk Front launched a large but unsuccessful counteroffensive in the Smolensk, El'nia, and Roslavl regions to halt Army Group Centre's advance on Moscow. Despite some success by the Reserve Front at El'nia, the efforts by Bryansk Front were a failure. After the failure of the Smolensk offensives, the seriously weakened front became trapped in an enormous encirclement in the lead-up to the Battle of Moscow. \\"Most of the troops found themselves encircled, and were fighting their way to the east,\\" according to Zhukov. On 23 Oct., \\"thanks to heroic efforts they managed to break out of encirclement.\\" On 10 Nov., the Bryansk Front was \\"disbanded\\".

McCormick and Joseph Medill Patterson, who had both been publishing the Chicago Tribune since 1914, planned to launch a tabloid in New York, as comics historian Coulton Waugh explained: Patterson founded the Chicago Tribune Syndicate in 1918, managed by Arthur Crawford.Watson, Elmo Scott. \\"The Era of Consolidation, 1890-1920\\" (Chapter VII), in A History Of Newspaper Syndicates In The United States, 1865-1935 (Western Newspaper Union, 1936), archived at Stripper's Guide In 1933, Patterson (who was then based in New York and running the Daily News), launched the Chicago Tribune-Daily News Syndicate, Inc. (also known as the Chicago Tribune-New York News Syndicate and the Tribune-New York (Daily) News Syndicate). An April 1933 article in Fortune described the \\"Big Four\\" American syndicates as United Feature Syndicate, King Features Syndicate, the Chicago Tribune Syndicate, and the Bell-McClure Syndicate.Jeet Heer, \\"Crane's Great Gamble\\", in Roy Crane, Buz Sawyer: 1, The War in the Pacific.

It is located on the university's campus in Jacksonville, Florida, U.S. It is named for George and Kernan Hodges, who donated $2 million to upgrade the facility in 2006. The 12,000-capacity stadium opened in 2004 with s capacity of 9,400 and underwent renovations in 2006 and 2008 that installed additional seating, a press box, and a 9-lane Olympic quality running track. The facility additionally includes classrooms, offices, and the Browning Athletic Training and Education Center. Following the completion of the current track, it became one of seven facilities in the U.S. certified by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), allowing it to host all NCAA and IAAF events within its grounds. In addition to its use by UNF the stadium has become a center for rugby league football, serving as home field for the Jacksonville Axemen of the USA Rugby League (USARL), and hosting several international matches and training camps. History The University of North Florida's field was first opened in 2004 in order to serve the North Florida Ospreys men's and women's soccer, cross country running, and track and field teams. In 2006 Jacksonville philanthropists George and Kernan Hodges issued a $2 million donation to UNF to improve the facility. The donation funded the construction of seats for 10,000, an eight-lane 400-meter track, a press box, lighting, and classrooms and offices. The nameless field was renamed Hodges Stadium after them. Other additions included the Browning Athletic Training and Education Center and a strength and conditioning center. In 2008 the stadium underwent another renovation to install a new state-of-the art running track. The university spent another $3 million to complete the 9-lane Olympic-quality track. It was designed by the Italian company Mondo and was the third facility in the world to feature the company's Mondotrack SX rubber surface. It was built to meet National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) standards, and is one of only seven facilities in the U.S. to be certified by the IAAF. Notable events The stadium has also held three international rugby league football matches, and has hosted training camp for several international teams.

The year 1158 is assumed to be the foundation date of Munich, which is only the earliest date the city is mentioned in a document. By that time the Guelph Henry the Lion, Duke of Saxony and Bavaria, built a bridge over the river Isar next to a settlement of Benedictine monks. The monks' presence dated back to the 8th century, although settlement in the Munich area can be traced back to the late neolithic. To force traders to use his bridge (and charge them for doing so) Henry also destroyed a nearby bridge owned by bishop Otto von Freising (Freising). Subsequently, the bishop and Henry quarreled about the city before Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa at an Imperial Diet held in Augsburg in 1158. This sanctioned Henry's spoliation, and awarded an annual compensation for the bishop, and also confirmed Munich's trading and currency rights. Middle Ages Frauenkirche in the background. Almost two decades later in 1175 Munich was officially granted city status and received fortification. In 1180, with the trial of Henry the Lion, Otto I Wittelsbach became Duke of Bavaria and Munich was handed over to the bishop of Freising. Otto's heirs, the Wittelsbach dynasty would rule Bavaria until 1918. In 1240 Munich itself was transferred to Otto II Wittelsbach and in 1255, when the dukedom of Bavaria was split in two, Munich became the ducal residence of Upper Bavaria. Duke Louis IV was elected German king in 1314 and crowned as Holy Roman Emperor in 1328. He strengthened the city's position by granting it the salt monopoly, thus assuring it of additional income. After outmaneuvering Freising, Munich was the principal river crossing on the route from Salzburg to Augsburg. Salzburg (vicinity) was the source of salt, and Augsburg was, at the time, a much more important city than Munich. In 1327 most of the city was destroyed by a fire but was rebuilt, extended and protected with a new fortification some years later. Philosophers like Michael of Cesena, Marsilius of Padua and William of Ockham supported Louis IV in his fight with the papacy and were protected at the emperor's court. After the citizenry revolted several times against the dukes, a new castle was built close to the fortification, starting in 1385. An uprising of the guilds in 1397 was suppressed in 1403. Another devastating fire destroyed parts of the city in 1429. Since the town fathers considered themselves threatened by the Hussites, the fortification was extended. In the late 15th century Munich underwent a revival of gothic arts‚Äîthe Old Town Hall was enlarged, and a new cathedral‚Äîthe Frauenkirche‚Äîconstructed within only twenty years, starting in 1468. The cathedral has become a symbol for the city with its two brick towers and onion domes. Capital of the reunited duchy of Bavaria Munich about 1572. When Bavaria was reunited in 1506 Munich became capital of the whole of Bavaria. The arts and politics became increasingly influenced by the court. During the 16th century Munich was a center of the German counter reformation, and also of renaissance arts. Duke Wilhelm V commissioned the Jesuit Michaelskirche, which became a center for the counter-reformation, and also built the Hofbr√§uhaus for brewing brown beer in 1589. The Catholic League was founded in Munich in 1609. In 1623 during the Thirty Years' War Munich became electoral residence when Maximilian I, Duke of Bavaria was invested with the electoral dignity but in 1632 the city was occupied by Gustav II Adolph of Sweden. When the bubonic plague broke out in 1634 and 1635 about one third of the population died. Theatinerkirche on Odeonsplatz in the historic city centre. After the war Munich quickly became a center of baroque life. Elector Ferdinand Maria's consort Henriette Adelaide of Savoy invited numerous Italian architects and artists to the city, and built the Theatinerkirche and Nymphenburg palace on the occasion of the birth of their son and heir Maximilian II Emanuel, elector of Bavaria. Munich was under the control of the Habsburg family for some years after Maximilian II Emanuel had made a pact with France in 1705 during the War of the Spanish Succession. The occupation led to bloody uprisings against the Austrian imperial troops followed by a massacre while farmers were rioting (the \\"Sendlinger Mordweihnacht\\" or Sendling's Night of Murder). The coronation of Max Emanuel's son elector Charles Albert as Emperor Charles VII in 1742 led to another Habsburg occupation. For a short time 1744-1745 Munich was the imperial residence again under Charles VII. The city's first academic institution, the Bavarian Academy of Sciences, was founded in 1759 by Maximilian III Joseph, who abandoned his forefather's imperial ambitions and made peace. From 1789 onwards, when the old medieval fortification was demolished, the English Garden was laid out‚Äîit is one of the world's largest urban public parks. By that time, the city was growing very quickly and was one of the largest cities in continental Europe. Capital of the Kingdom of Bavaria Munich, town map 1858. In 1806, it became the capital of the new Kingdom of Bavaria, with the state's parliament (the Landtag) and the new archdiocese of Munich and Freising being located in the city. Twenty years later Landshut University was moved to Munich. 200px Many of the city's finest buildings belong to this period and were built under the reign of King Ludwig I. These neoclassical buildings include the Ruhmeshalle with the Bavaria statue by Ludwig Michael von Schwanthaler and those on the magnificent Ludwigstra√üe and the K√∂nigsplatz, built by the architects Leo von Klenze and Friedrich von G√§rtner. Under King Max II the Maximilianstra√üe was constructed in Perpendicular style. The railways reached Munich in 1839, followed by trams in 1876 and electric lighting in 1882. The Technical University of Munich was founded in 1868. The city hosted Germany's first exhibition of electricity, and in 1930 the first ever television was showcased at the city's Deutsches Museum (founded in 1903) on the banks of the Isar. Numerous inventors and scientists worked in Munich, including Alois Senefelder, Joseph von Fraunhofer, Justus von Liebig, Georg Ohm, Carl von Linde, Rudolf Diesel, Wilhelm Conrad R√∂ntgen, Emil Kraepelin and Alois Alzheimer, and the young Albert Einstein attended the Luitpold Gymnasium. In 1911 the Hellabrunn Zoo opened in the city. Justizpalast, postcard late 19th century.|200px Munich also became a center of the arts and literature again, as Thomas Mann, Henrik Ibsen, Richard Wagner, Richard Strauss and many others prominent figures lived and worked there. Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider), a group of expressionist artists, was established in Munich in 1911. In 1846 Munich's population was about 100,000, and by 1901 this had risen to about 500,000. World War I and revolution Following the outbreak of World War I in 1914, life in Munich became very difficult, as the Allied blockade of Germany led to food and fuel shortages. During French air raids in 1916 three bombs fell on Munich. After World War I, the city was at the center of much political unrest. In November 1918 on the eve of revolution, Ludwig III and his family fled the city. After the murder of the first republican premier of Bavaria Kurt Eisner in February 1919 by Anton Graf von Arco auf Valley, a member of the right-wing Thule Gesellschaft (Thule Society), the Bavarian Soviet Republic (Bayerische R√§terepublik or M√ºnchner R√§terepublik) was proclaimed. After Communists had taken power, Lenin, who had lived in Munich some years before, sent a congratulatory telegram, but the Soviet Republic was put down on May 3, 1919 by the Freikorps. On 3 May 1919, loyal elements of the German army (called the ‚ÄúWhite Guards of Capitalism‚Äù by the communists), with a force of 9,000, and Freikorps (such as the Freikorps Epp and the Marinebrigade Ehrhardt) with a force of about 30,000 men, entered Munich and defeated the communists after bitter street fighting in which over 1,000 supporters of the Munich \\"Soviet\\" government were killed. About 700 men and women were arrested and summarily executed by the victorious Freikorps troops. After the R√§terepublik had been brutally put down and the republican government had been restored, Munich subsequently became a hotbed of right- wing politics, among which Adolf Hitler and the Nazis rose to prominence. Weimar Republic/Nazi regime and World War II Hitler and Mussolini before one of the Honor Temples at K√∂nigsplatz Destroyed Siegestor 1945 In 1923 Hitler and his supporters, who were concentrated in Munich, staged the Beer Hall Putsch, an attempt to overthrow the Weimar Republic and seize power. The revolt failed, resulting in Hitler's arrest and the temporary crippling of the Nazi Party, which was virtually unknown outside Munich. At the end of the Residenzstrasse, where the putsch resulted in the death of 16 Nazis and four policemen, the government of Bavaria placed a plaque after the war on the ground with the names of the four policemen who died there. The city once again became a Nazi stronghold when the Nazis took power in Germany in 1933. The Nazis created the first concentration camp at Dachau, 10 miles northwest of the city. Because of its importance to the rise of Nazism, the Nazis called Munich the Hauptstadt der Bewegung (\\"Capital of the Movement\\"). The NSDAP headquarters were in Munich and many F√ºhrerbauten (\\"F√ºhrer-buildings\\") were built around the K√∂nigsplatz, some of which have survived to this day. During the Night of the Long Knives in 1934, Hitler eliminated potential political rivals. Ernst R√∂hm was killed in Munich's Stadelheim Prison. In 1938, the Munich Agreement, Neville Chamberlain's famous act of appeasement to Hitler, was signed in the city by representatives of Germany, Italy, France and the Britain. It ceded the mostly German-speaking regions of Czechoslovakia, called the Sudetenland, to Germany. One year later Georg Elser failed in an attempt to assassinate Hitler during his annual speech to commemorate the Beer Hall Putsch in the B√ºrgerbr√§ukeller in Munich. The B√ºrgerbr√§ukeller is no longer there, but other beerhalls where Hitler spoke, like the Hofbr√§ukeller, the famous Hofbr√§uhaus and the L√∂wenbr√§ukeller are still there. One of the examples of Nazi architecture in M√ºnchen is the Haus der Deutschen Kunst, an art museum designed by architect Paul Ludwig Troost. Munich was the base of the White Rose (German: Die Wei√üe Rose), a group of students that formed a resistance movement from June 1942 to February 1943. The core members were arrested and executed following a distribution of leaflets in Munich University by Hans and Sophie Scholl. The city was very heavily damaged by Allied bombing during World War II‚Äîthe city was hit by 71 air raids over a period of six years. As the bombings continued, more and more people moved out. By May 1945, 337,000 people (41%) had left.Richard Overy (2014), The Bombers and the Bombed: Allied Air War Over Europe 1940‚Äì1945, p. 304. The final battle for Munich began on 29 April 1945, when the US 20th Armored Division. US 3rd Infantry Division, US 42nd Infantry Division and US 45th Infantry Division assaulted through the outskirts of the city, also liberating Dachau concentration camp in the process. Some sectors were well defended against this opening push. However, the city itself was captured rather easily, as the German defenders there offered only light resistance, on 30 April 1945.Stanton, Shelby, World War II Order of Battle: An Encyclopedic Reference to U.S. Army Ground Forces from Battalion through Division, 1939‚Äì1946 (Revised Edition, 2006), Stackpole Books. pp. 69, 80, 129, 135. Postwar Munich Munich's Olympia Park After American occupation in 1945, Munich was completely rebuilt following a meticulous and‚Äîby comparison to other war-ravaged German cities‚Äîrather conservative plan which preserved its pre-war street grid. In 1957 Munich's population passed the one million mark. In 1958 Munich hosted the Chess Olympiad. Munich was the site of the 1972 Summer Olympics, during which Israeli athletes were assassinated by Palestinian terrorists (see Munich massacre), when terrorist gunmen from the Palestinian \\"Black September\\" group took hostage members of the Israeli Olympic team. A rescue attempt by the West German government was unsuccessful and resulted in the deaths of the eleven Israeli hostages, five of the terrorists, and one German police officer. Several games of the 1974 World Cup were also held in the city, including the German triumph against the Netherlands in a legendary final. Several games of the 2006 World Cup were also held in Munich. In 1992 Munich's new airport was inaugurated and the inauguration of the Neue Messe, the new exhibition centre on the site of the former airport of Riem, took place in 1998. The previous Roman Catholic Pope Benedict XVI (Joseph Ratzinger) was ordained a priest in the Archdiocese of Munich and Freising on June 29, 1951. Ratzinger served as Archbishop of Munich from 1977 to 1982. In December 2007 the German Olympic Committee unanimously agreed to support Munich's bid to host the 2018 Winter Olympics, however the bid failed.

Since the late 1940s, the term 'Madhes' was used by politicians in the Nepal Terai to differentiate between interests of the people of the Terai and of the hills. In recent times, some politicians and journalists use the term for all Nepali citizens of the Terai. Indian immigrants settled foremost in present- day eastern Nepal Terai since the late 18th century, when the Shah rulers of Nepal encouraged deforestation and agricultural development of this region. Madheshi people comprise Brahmin and Dalit caste groups as well as ethnic groups such as Maithils, Bhojpuri and Bajjika speaking people. Many of these groups share cultural traditions, educational and family ties with people living south of the international border in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. Tharu people and Pahari people living in the Terai do not consider themselves as Madheshi. Etymology The word madhesh is thought to be derived from the Sanskrit madhya desh (‡§Æ‡§ß‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§¶‡•á‡§∂), literally the middle country, which refers to \\"the central region, the country lying between the Himalaya and the Vindhya mountains\\". However, in the context of Nepal, Madhesh refers to the region in the Nepal Terai located south of the Siwalik Hills. Madhesh has also been defined as the cultural and linguistic space existing as a basis for identity among the people of the Terai. The term Madheshi literally means the people of Madhesh, but it is in fact a political term used by the Hill Nepalis (the pahadis) to refer to \\"non-pahadis with plains languages as their mother tongue, regardless of their place of birth or residence\\". The International Crisis Group stated in 2007 that it was often used pejoratively for any people residing in the Terai not considered \\"true Nepali\\". One Madheshi stated in an interview that the ascription was \\"forced\\" upon the Madheshi people, but they accepted it and owned it by declaring that their land is Madhesh, hence they are Masheshis. The term Madheshi became a widely recognised name for Nepali citizens with an Indian cultural background only after 1990. History of Indian immigration to the Nepal Terai Since the late 18th century, the Shah rulers of Nepal encouraged Indian people to settle in the eastern Terai through a series of subsidies granted to new settlers. In the 1770s to 1780s, famine-stricken Bihari farmers migrated to the Nepal Terai following a severe flood of the Koshi River and a subsequent drought. They converted forest to agricultural land. To promote economic development of the Nepal Terai, people from the hills were invited to settle, but only a few moved to the Terai. Between the 1860s and 1951, people from India immigrated and settled in the region. Immigration of Indian farmers and labourers was particularly high during the rule of the Rana dynasty between 1846 and 1950. They settled foremost in the eastern Nepal Terai together with native Terai peoples. This increased immigration facilitated expansion of cultivated land, which provided revenue for the state in the form of taxes by farmers, duties for felling and export of timber, and fees for grazing of cattle on pastures during dry seasons. In the mid 19th century, Muslim people from the Awadh region were invited to settle in the far-western Nepal Terai, where they received large forested areas for conversion to agriculture. People of at least 21 Indian ethnic groups immigrated between 1933 and 1966. In 1952, a Nepal Citizenship Act was passed that entitled all those immigrants to obtain Nepali citizenship who had stayed in the country for at least five years. The Citizenship Act of 1963 entitled immigrants to receive Nepali citizenship if they were able to read and write Nepali and engaged in business. In 1981, the Indian Ministry of Foreign Affairs estimated that about 3.2 million people of Indian origin lived in Nepal, of which about 2.4 million had received Nepali citizenship. In 2006, the Nepal Citizenship Act was amended to the effect that people born before 1990 and residing permanently in the country obtained the right to Nepali citizenship. About 2.3 million people received citizenship certificates. The Constitution of Nepal 2015 contains provisions for a Nepali citizenship by naturalisation, which can be acquired by: *foreign women who are married to a Nepali man; *children of a Nepali woman and a foreign man. Demographics of the Nepal Terai  With , the Nepal Terai constitutes 23.1% of Nepal's land area. As of 2001, about 48.5% of Nepal's population lived in the Terai, which had a population density of , the highest in the country. As of June 2011, the Nepal Terai's human population totaled 13,318,705 people comprising more than 120 different ethnic groups and castes. Politics Since the late 1940s, the term 'Madhes' was used by politicians in the Nepal Terai to differentiate between interests of the people of the Terai and of the hills. At the time, Indian and Madheshi people needed a passport to travel to Kathmandu, a requirement in place until 1958. In the 1950s, the regional political party Nepal Terai Congress advocated more autonomy for the Terai, recognition of Hindi as a national language and increasing employment opportunities for Madheshi people. During 1961 to 1990, the Panchayat government enforced a policy of assimilating diverse cultural groups into a pan-Nepali identity. Legal directives made it an offence to address inequality and discrimination of ethnic groups. The complexities of ethnopolitical conflicts between immigrants, caste groups and indigenous groups living in the Terai were not addressed. After the Panchayat regime was abolished following the People's Movement in spring 1990, disadvanted groups demanded a more equitable share of political resources such as admittance to civil service. Madheshi people are disadvantaged in regards to access to education; literacy rate among Madheshi people is lower than among other groups in Nepal, and lowest among Madheshi Dalits. They are also disappointed to have been excluded from participation in bureaucracy, Nepal Army and political parties in Nepal. Madheshi identity is largely based on the experience of being discriminated by the country's ruling elites.; ; The Nepal Sadbhawana Party is the oldest Madheshi party, which started lobbying for socio-cultural, linguistic and political rights of Madheshi people in the 1990s. The discussions on rights and demands of Madheshi people increased after the end of the Nepalese Civil War, in particular among Madheshi intellectuals and political elites. The political parties Janatantrik Terai Mukti Morcha and Madhesi Jana Adhikar Forum advocated the idea of an autonomous Madhes province stretching all over the Terai and organised violent demonstrations in 2007 to enforce their demands. The United Democratic Madhesi Front formed by Madheshi organizations pressured the government to accept this concept of autonomy under the motto \\"One Madhes One Pradesh\\". Several ethnic and religious groups in the Terai opposed and resisted this policy under the leadership of Madheshi parties, foremost Tharu and Muslim people.; The Tharu people were initially comfortable with the Madheshi identity in the eastern part of the Terai as of 2007, but in the central part, they claim a distinct Tharu identity. In 2009, they disassociated themselves from being identified as Madheshi and demanded their own province. Armed groups like Terai Army, Madhesi National Liberation Front, Terai Cobras and Madhesh Mukti Tigers pursued this aim of autonomy using violent means.; Some members of these organisations were responsible for acts of terrorism including bombings and murders. The Alliance for Independent Madhesh also demands independence of the Terai. In 2013, more than 24 Madheshi political parties were registered for the Constituent Assembly of Nepal election. Madheshi parties gained 50 of 575 seats in the Constituent Assembly.  Indian influence in Nepal Terai  After the Nepalese Constituent Assembly election, 2008, Indian politicians kept on trying to secure strategic interests in the Nepal Terai, such as over hydropower energy, development projects, business and trade. It has been alleged that by supporting the 2015 Nepal blockade, India tried to dominate Nepal's internal politics and foment the conflict in the Nepal Terai. Culture The culture of Madeshi people is complex and diverse. The Muslim and indigenous peoples speak their own languages and have distinct cultural traditions that differ from the Hindu caste groups. Latter comprise at least 43 distinct groups. Caste groups include Bania, Brahman, Dhobi, Kalawar, Kewat, Kshatriya, Kumhar, Kurmi, Kushwaha and Teli. Muslim people in the Terai constitute about 96% of all Muslims in the country. Their cultural traditions are interlinked with those of Muslim people in northern India; popular destinations for their ziyarat pilgrimage are the shrines of Ajmer Sharif Dargah and Ghazi Saiyyad Salar Masud in Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, respectively. They are influenced by the hierarchy of the Hindu caste system, with the difference that it is not based on the principle of pollution and purity, but on occupation. Both Muslim and Hindu Madheshi parents place more emphasis on the education of boys than of girls. Despite an increase of schools and primary education being compulsory and free of cost, more boys than girls are enrolled. Girls are expected to look after younger siblings and do household chores. Many rural Madheshi girls are married at an age of 14 to 16 years.  Languages  Madheshi people speak Bengali, Maithili, Bhojpuri, Urdu and Hindi languages. The National Population and Housing Census of 2011 knows of 123 languages spoken in all of Nepal and lists: *3,092,530 Maithili speaking people (11.7% of Nepal's total population), of which 3,004,245 lived in the Terai; *1,584,958 Bhojpuri speaking people (5.98%), of which 1,542,333 lived in the Terai; *1,529,875 Tharu speaking people (5.77%), including 1,479,129 in the Terai; *793,418 Bajjika speaking people (2.99%), including 791,737 in the Terai; *691,546 speak Urdu (2.61%), including 671,851 in the Terai. Muslim Madheshis speak Urdu primarily, but also Awadhi, Bhojpuri, and Maithili, depending on whether they live in the western, central or eastern Terai. Religions The following religions are practised in the Terai according to the National Population and Housing Census of 2011: *Hinduism with 11,308,620 followers *Islam with 1,105,533 followers *Buddhism with 472,469 followers *Kirat with 190,458 followers *Christianity with 137,723 followers *Prakriti with 63,747 followers *Jainism with 2,169 followers *Bon with 1,379 followers, less than 900 followers of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith and less than 500 Sikhs. The religious practices of the majority of Madheshi people are a mixture of orthodox Hinduism and animism. Muslim Madheshis practise the traditional nikah marriage, which is recognised by law. The largest and oldest madrasa is located in Krishnanagar. Mawlawis teaching Quran and Hadith at madrasas in the Terai are either from India, or were trained in India and Saudi Arabia. Many Muslim Madheshis practise endogamy. Cuisine In 1989, a study on food consumption pattern was conducted with 108 people in a village in Chitwan district. Results of this study showed that the people consumed seven food items on average. Rice constituted almost half of their daily food intake, supplemented by vegetables, potatoes, milk and dairy products. Less frequently they consumed meat, fish, eggs and fruit. About 13.7% of the total food intake of men was alcohol, whereas females consumed far less alcohol. Fruit commonly grown in the Terai include mango, lychee, papaya, guava, banana and jackfruit.

Lives and careers George Williams Peckham George Peckham was born in Albany, New York. At age 18, he enlisted in the U.S. Army to fight in the American Civil War, reaching the rank of first lieutenant. After the war, he resumed his studies, obtaining a law degree from Albany Law School in 1867. After graduation, George worked at the law office of James T. Brown of Milwaukee. Not caring for the law, however, he became a student in the medical college of the University of Michigan, earning his M.D. in 1872. Rather than practice medicine, however, he chose to teach biology at East Division High School of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In 1880, he organized the first American biological laboratory program in any high school. He married his colleague, Elizabeth Maria Gifford, one of the first science graduates from Vassar. In 1888, Peckham became principal of East Division, and in 1891, an inspector for the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction. He also served during this period as president of the Wisconsin Academy of Sciences, Arts and Letters.\\"Council\\" in, Transactions of the Wisconsin Academy of Sciences, Arts and Letters Madison: Democrat Printing Company, State Printers, 1892. Volume VIII (1888-1891); n.p. In 1897, he became the director of the Milwaukee Public Library, in which position he served until retirement in 1910. He died on January 10, 1914, at the age of 68.Muttkowski, R. A. (1914). \\"George Williams Peckham, M.D., LL.D.\\" Entomological News and Proceedings of the Entomological Section, Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia. 25 (4): 145‚Äì148. Elizabeth Maria Gifford (later Peckham) was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 1854. She graduated from Vassar College in 1876 and earned her master's degree from Vassar in 1888. She was active in the women's suffrage movement both at the state and national level and testified before legislative committees on several occasions. She served as one of the first librarians in the city of Milwaukee. After the death of her husband, she continued her scientific work and received a PhD from Cornell University in 1916. Elizabeth Peckham died of pneumonia on February 11, 1940, at the age of 85. Natural science studies Together, they introduced Darwinian concepts into secondary education and began their studies on the taxonomy and behavior of jumping spiders (Salticidae _)_ , a large group of visually oriented spiders. They were among the earliest taxonomists to emphasize the value of behavior in classification. In 1889-1890, they published Observations on Sexual Selection in Spiders of the Family Attidae, and Additional Observations on Sexual Selection in Spiders of the Family Attid√¶, with Some Remarks on Mr. Wallace's Theory of Sexual Ornamentation, among the first studies on sexual selection, supporting Darwin's concept against Wallace's alternative explanation of courtship behavior. In 1898, they produced On the Instincts and Habits of the Solitary Wasps, a work considered a scientific classic for its style, as well as its scholarship. Unlike the later work of Fabre, which praised the supposed \\"perfection\\" of insect behavior, the Peckhams identified series of behaviors that were subject to natural selection. The Peckhams were lifetime collaborators, as researchers and educators. From 1883 to 1909, they described 63 genera and 366 species. The North American Peckham Society is named after them. It is dedicated to salticid research; its irregular publication is titled Peckhamia.  Taxa named after the Peckhams  The salticid genus Peckhamia is named in their honor, along with at least 20 species and one subspecies: * Cicurina peckhami (Simon, 1898) * Acragas peckhami (Chickering, 1946) * Bellota peckhami Galiano, 1978 * Chapoda peckhami Banks, 1929 * Compsodecta peckhami Bryant, 1943 * Corythalia peckhami Petrunkevitch, 1914 * Goleta peckhami Simon, 1900 * Habrocestum peckhami Rainbow, 1899 * Habronattus peckhami (Banks, 1921) * Hasarius peckhami Petrunkevitch, 1914 * Heliophanus peckhami Simon, 1902 * Hyllus brevitarsis peckhamorum Berland & Millot, 1941 * Myrmarachne peckhami Roewer, 1951 * Pachomius peckhamorum Galiano, 1994 * Pelegrina peckhamorum (Kaston, 1973) * Pensacola peckhami Bryant, 1943 * Salticus peckhamae (Cockerell, 1897) * Telamonia peckhami Thorell, 1891 * Thiodina peckhami (Bryant, 1940) * Uroballus peckhami Zabka, 1985 * Viciria peckhamorum Lessert, 1927  Tributes  In addition to the various taxa named after them, in 1929, Milwaukee Public Schools built a new junior high school, which was named Peckham Junior High School. The name was changed in the early 1970s to honor Jackie Robinson.

Its west end is near the west end of the Illinois Subdivision. History The St. Louis Line Subdivision was formed from two main lines, joined by a short connecting track in Terre Haute, Indiana. From Terre Haute east to Indianapolis, the Indianapolis and St. Louis Railroad opened in 1870; this became part of the New York Central Railroad (NYC) through leases and mergers. The line west of Terre Haute was built by the Terre Haute and Indianapolis Rail Road (in Indiana) and the St. Louis, Vandalia and Terre Haute Railroad (in Illinois), and was also completed in 1870. , January 2005 Edition These companies became part of the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) through leases and mergers. Both lines became part of Penn Central Transportation and then Conrail, which decided to downgrade the PRR's line east of Terre Haute and the NYC's line west of Terre Haute, building a short connection in Terre Haute and forming the St. Louis Line. The line was assigned to CSX in Conrail's 1999 breakup. Amtrak's National Limited used the line between 1971 and 1976, with stops at Effingham and Terre Haute.

In the year of his arrival, Fadrique married Marulla, the daughter of Boniface of Verona, thus allying himself with the chief lord of Euboea. By this marriage, also, he acquired rights to the castles of Larmena, Karystos, Zetouni, and Gardiki. Over the next two years, Fadrique warred with the Republic of Venice and stormed the city of Negroponte with Turks after Boniface of Verona died.

He worked for several years retrofitting and fixing nuclear power plants. Intrigued by the research component of his job, Ottaviani began taking library science courses at Drexel University, and in 1990 he enrolled in the Library and Information Science program at the University of Michigan. He earned his M.S. in information and library studies from Michigan in 1992. He spent several years working as a reference librarian at Michigan's Media Union Library.

Ottaviani's interest in writing science-related comics was inspired by Richard Rhodes's book The Making of the Atomic Bomb. In discussing the book with comic book artist Steve Lieber, the two decided to write and illustrate a famous meeting between physicists Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg during World War II. That project expanded to include other stories from the history of science to become the graphic novel Two-Fisted Science, including stories written by Ottaviani and illustrated by a variety of artists.Figuracion, Neil. \\"A Look Inside the Lab - A Genre Bender Interview with Jim Ottaviani\\" [interview].

These works are all self- published by Ottaviani's own company, G. T. Labs, which he started in 1996. The company's name is an homage to General Techtronics Labs, the fictional company where comic book character Peter Parker was bitten by the radioactive spider that led to his becoming Spider-Man.

As part of the Victorian Justice system the Tribunal sits 'below' the Magistrates Court in the court hierarchy. However the Tribunal itself is not a Court as it is a creature of statute and has no inherent jurisdiction or powers. VCAT was primarily a forum for litigants-in-person and the participation of lawyers or other legal representatives is not encouraged in some List areas, substantially reducing the cost of litigation. However some of the List areas will by necessity require parties to have some form of representation. VCAT (pronounced ‚Äòvee-cat‚Äô) resolves about 90,000 disputes per year and provides Victorians with a low-cost, accessible and independent dispute resolution service, which is deliberately informal and encourages self-representation. Its orders are enforceable by law once they have been registered with the Magistrates Court. The Tribunal began operating on 1 July 1998, amalgamating 15 smaller boards and tribunals, creating a 'one-stop-shop' for handling a broad range of disputes. When looking at the sheer number of cases, the VCAT deals with the overwhelming majority of legal proceedings in this State.. The President of VCAT (currently Michelle Quigley), is a Supreme Court Judge, and County Court Judges serve as Vice-Presidents. Applications are heard and determined by Deputy presidents (appointed full-time), as well as Senior Members and ordinary Members, who may be appointed on a full-time, part-time or on a sessional basis. Members have a broad range of specialist skills and qualifications, enabling VCAT to hear and determine cases of considerable complexity and varying subject matter. The VCAT has jurisdiction to hear and determine disputes under over 200 enabling provisions. Divisions of the Tribunal VCAT has four divisions: Civil, Administrative, Residential Tenancies and Human Rights. Within these divisions, the various types of matters are allocated to what are referred to as 'Lists'. (For example, Residential Tenancy matters are heard in the Residential Tenancies List.) The Civil Division has a Civil Claims List, Owners Corporations List and Building & Property List. The Administrative Division has a Planning & Environment List, Legal Practice List and Review & Regulation List. The Residential Tenancies Division has a Residential Tenancies List. The Human Rights Division has a Human Rights List and Guardianship List. The Civil Division hears and determines a range of civil disputes relating to: * consumer matters * domestic building works * owners corporation matters * retail tenancies * sale and ownership of property * use or flow of water between properties. The Administrative Division deals with applications from people seeking a review of government and other bodies' decisions that affect them. These include decisions relating to: * local council land valuations and planning permits * Transport Accident Commission decisions * state taxation * legal services * business licences and professional registrations * Freedom of Information applications * WorkSafe assessments * disciplinary proceedings for a range of professions and industries. The Residential Tenancies Division deals with matters involving: * residential tenants and landlords * rooming house owners and residents * the Director of Housing and public housing tenants * caravan park owners and residents. The Human Rights Division deals with matters relating to: * guardianship and administration * equal opportunity * racial and religious vilification * health and privacy information * the Disability Act 2006 (Vic) * decisions made by the Mental Health Tribunal. Procedure VCAT reports to the Attorney Generals office each year and these reports are publicly available.. According to the 2013‚Äì2014 VCAT Annual Report, of the almost 89,000 applications lodged in 2013‚Äì14, about 69 per cent were residential tenancy matters (61,126 applications received), with 12 per cent relating to guardianship matters (10,865 applications received) and nine per cent involving civil claims (7,794 applications received). Planning matters comprised about three per cent of matters taken to VCAT in 2013‚Äì14. Applicants can apply online using VCAT's website, or over the counter at 55 King Street, Melbourne.55 King Street, Melbourne, Google maps Application fees are payable in relation to most matters that are brought to VCAT. Hearing fees are also payable on the day of the hearing in some circumstance. To resolve disputes without the need for a full hearing, VCAT conducts compulsory conferences, mediations, and a short mediations and hearings program (SMAH). This program involves short mediations, followed by an immediate hearing if the mediation is unsuccessful. VCAT's main hearing venue is 55 King Street, Melbourne. Its Human Rights Division is based at William Cooper Justice Centre, 223 William St, Melbourne. VCAT also sits in many metropolitan and regional Victorian locations including Bendigo, Ballarat, Geelong, Mildura, Wangaratta and Warrnambool. Guardianship hearings are frequently conducted beside hospital beds or in residential care facilities to avoid the need to transport ill or elderly people to hearing rooms. VCAT is required to make its decisions in accordance with the law, and can only make a decision based on the specific matter before it. For example, if the application to VCAT is to dispute whether a land use needs to provide a certain number of car parks, then VCAT cannot make a decision about other matters such as whether the land should be used in the proposed manner (it can only consider the car parking issue). In planning matters, VCAT must make its decisions based on the law and the requirements of the individual council's planning scheme, balancing competing objectives such as neighbourhood character or urban consolidation. The content of a council's planning scheme is determined by the individual council, with the approval of the Minister for Planning. VCAT has no say in what goes into a planning scheme and is not involved with the making of planning laws. It is, however, required to apply them. VCAT decisions can be appealed to the Supreme Court on questions of law. For example, if a party believes there has been an absence of procedural fairness or natural justice, or a failure to comply with the law such as a council planning scheme, then the party can make application to the Supreme Court to have the decision of the Tribunal overturned.

He was the son of Gospatric I, sometime Earl of Northumbria (d. after 1073). In the earliest sources, occurring at dates between 1120 and 1134 he is not styled \\"earl\\", but the \\"brother of Dolfin\\", the latter style being used in his own seal. Later accounts say that he was granted lands by king M√°el Coluim III, although it is possible that he received them from his father, while his brother Dolfin received much of Cumberland. As Gospatric held lands from both King David I of Scotland and King Henry I of England it is impossible to label him either \\"English\\" or \\"Scottish\\". He witnessed the charter of Alexander I of Scotland founding Scone Abbey. Gospatric enjoyed the benefits of the renewed prominence given to native Englishmen in the reign of Henry I. He and his children obtained many lands in England proper, and he himself gained jurisdiction over some northern English legal duties. He appears to have attained the status of \\"earl\\" by the year 1134, when that style first appears in documentary sources.

Bedouins like this young man wearing a fez are traditionally renowned for their hospitality. Many matters of etiquette in the Middle East are connected to Islam as it is written in the Qur'an and how it has been traditionally understood and practiced throughout the centuries. Prescribed Islamic etiquette is referred to as Adab, and described as \\"refinement, good manners, morals, ethics, decorum, decency, humaneness and righteousness\\".Firmage, Edwin Brown and Weiss, Bernard G. and Welch, John W. Religion and Law. 1990, page 202-3 As such, many points discussed in this article are applicable in other regions of the Islamic world. This holds especially true in Muslim majority countries outside Middle East. The traditional marketplaces of the Middle East might seem chaotic and intimidating to foreigners who don't comprehend the time-honored etiquette that governs transactions within. Shown here is a Bazaar in Iran. The Middle East is home to many people who follow faiths besides Islam. Most notable among them are the churches of Eastern Orthodox Christianity, Copts and other adherents of Oriental Orthodoxy, Maronites, Melkites other Catholics of the Eastern Rites as well as the Roman Rite, Zoroastrians, Bah√° º√≠s, and various Jewish denominations. In many cases, however, Muslims and non-Muslims in the Middle East will share characteristics, whether it is the prohibition against pork ordained by both Islamic and Jewish dietary restrictions, a preference for the beverage widely known elsewhere as \\"Turkish coffee\\", or knowledge of how to conduct business in a crowded souk without being cheated. It is a place where people with different beliefs often share the same traditions. Points of etiquette Although the Middle East is a large expanse of geography with a variety of customs, noting the following points of etiquette can be useful when dealing with people around the world who have been raised according to the traditions of the Middle East or, in some cases, Muslim societies elsewhere. * Regarding head attire specifically, the etiquette at many Muslim holy sites requires that a headscarf -although it is not necessary and many if not most (men) do not wear it- or some other modest head covering be worn. For women, this might be a hijab and, for men, it might be a taqiyah (cap), turban, or keffiyeh. A kippah or other head covering is expected for men in synagogues and other places where Jews pray. Orthodox Christian sites might require the removal of hats by men but will expect women to cover their hair with a kerchief or veil. * Public displays of affection between people of the opposite sex, including between married people, are frowned upon everywhere more conservative values hold sway. Public displays of affection include activities as minor as hand-holding. * In many cases, people of the same sex holding hands while walking is considered an ordinary display of friendship without romantic connotations.Cultural Tips Per Audia AZ * In a related point, many people in the Middle East claim a more modest amount of personal space than that which is usual elsewhere. Accordingly, it can seem rude for an individual to step away when another individual is stepping closer.\\"Are You the Ugly American?\\" , Budget Travel * Special respect is paid to older people in many circumstances. This can include standing when older people enter a room, always greeting older people before others present (even if they are better known to you), standing when speaking to one‚Äôs elders, kissing the head of an elderly relative, and serving older people first at a meal table. Hospitality is held in high regard throughout the Middle East. Some hosts take pride in the laborious preparation of what is known in Europe as ‚ÄúTurkish coffee‚Äù, grinding fresh-roasted coffee beans to a fine powder, dissolving sugar, and carefully regulating the heat to produce a result that meets exacting standards. * In Iran, the \\"thumbs up\\" gesture is considered an offensive insult. * Displaying the sole of one's foot or touching somebody with one's shoe is often considered rude. This includes sitting with one's feet or foot elevated. In some circumstances, shoes should be removed before entering a living room.The First Three to Five Seconds: Understanding Arab and Muslim Americans Part II, USDOJ * Many in the Middle East do not separate professional and personal life. Doing business revolves much more around personal relationships, family ties, trust, and honor. There is a tendency to prioritize personal matters above all else. It is therefore crucial that business relationships are built on mutual friendship and trust.The Importance of Business Relationships in the Middle East According to the manners instructor Tami Lancut Leibovitz it might be common for an Israeli to ask others some personal questions about money or children.

He is best known as a co-founder of the influential krautrock groups Cluster and Harmonia, and for his work in the ambient jazz trio Aquarello.Painting with Sound: The Life and Music of Hans-Joachim Roedelius by Stephen Iliffe. Foreword by Brian Eno ‚Äì Meridian Music Guides 2003.  Biography   Early life  Roedelius was born on 26 October 1934 in Berlin, Germany in the family of a dentist. He was an unwilling member of the German Youngsters in the Hitler Youth, membership being mandatory for all boys from the age of ten, and appeared in several propaganda films. Roedelius and his mother Gertrud were evacuated from Berlin to a small hamlet in East Prussia. In his book Future Days: Krautrock and the Building of Modern Germany, David Stubbs writes that \\"the aftermath of the war was most difficult for the Roedelius family\\" who didn't have \\"enough to live on and just a bit too much to die on\\". He served two years in prison after the war when he attempted to defect from East Germany. Before managing to escape over the border into West Berlin in 1961, he had worked as a physical therapist and masseur. Soon thereafter he gave up his day job to pursue a career in music.  Kluster, Cluster and Harmonia  In 1968 Roedelius co-founded the music commune known as \\"Human Being\\" and co-formed Zodiak Free Arts Lab, the center of Berlin's Underground Culture at the time, with conceptual artist Conrad Schnitzler. He met Dieter Moebius at the Zodiak. In 1969 Roedelius, Schnitzler and Moebius formed Kluster. In 1971 Schnitzler left the group to start a long- running solo career and Moebius and Roedelius anglicised the band's name to Cluster. They signed first to Philips then to Brain. In 1973 Roedelius and Moebius worked with Neu! guitarist Michael Rother under the name of Harmonia. Musik Von Harmonia was released on the back of a huge publicity campaign by Brain. Harmonia released one further album, 1975's Deluxe. Rother also co- produced the 1974 Cluster album Zuckerzeit. British musician Brian Eno, a fan of both Cluster and Harmonia, joined them for several jams, the result of which was released in 1997 as Tracks and Traces. Rother left Harmonia to pursue his solo career and Cluster returned to the studio to record Sowiesoso which was released on Sky Records. Brian Eno later worked on two albums with Cluster: 1977's Cluster & Eno and 1978's After the Heat, the latter of which gained the band much attention in the British music press. A further Cluster album produced by former Tangerine Dream member Peter Baumann Gro√ües Wasser extended Cluster's music into long form.  Solo career  Roedelius' solo career began with Durch die W√ºste in 1978 and then Jardin Au Fou in 1979. The first of the lengthy Selbstportrait series was released in 1979, being material done beside his work with Cluster and Harmonia, without the input of his collaborators. Mostly recorded on simple two-track equipment, the Selbstportraits make up the backbone of Roedelius' early solo recordings. Leaving Sky in 1982, his work took a more new-age style as he signed to Virgin's Venture sub-label. During this period, his best selling solo album Geschenk des Augenblicks ‚Äì Gift of the Moment was released. He was dropped by Venture in 1989 and began releasing on a variety of small labels. Sinfonia Contempora No. 2: La Nordica (Salz Des Nordens) was released in 1996. Also released in this period was Selbstportrait VI: The Diary of the Unforgotten, the first of the modern Selbstportraits. Now, rather than merely remastering the seventies tapes, Roedelius also played over them, the sound montage Homage √° Forst samples many Harmonia and Cluster tracks into the mix.  21st century  The turn of the century was Roedelius' most productive year, with no fewer than eight albums being released between 2000 and 2001. Reprising the Selbstportrait series for the seventh time in 2000, Roedelius composed entirely new tracks for the first time on Selfportrait VII: dem Wind voran ‚Äì ahead of the wind. The new millennium also saw Roedelius begin to work with other, usually younger, musicians than he had done since the late eighties. In the meantime, Cluster had reformed. 1990's Apropos Cluster was an update for the band, being a work of avant-techno not dissimilar in style to Gro√ües Wasser. In 1996 Cluster embarked on two international tours, one of Japan and one of America. Cluster reunited again in 2007. In November 2010 it was announced that Cluster had split up for the third time. In the official announcement, the split up was described as Moebius leaving the group. In the wake of this news, Roedelius announced that he was beginning a new project called Qluster, to follow on from Cluster and Kluster. The band is made up of Roedelius and accomplished electronic musician Onnen Bock with third member Armin Metz and released a trilogy consisting of \\"Rufen\\", \\"Fragen\\" and \\"Antworten\\" (Calling, Asking and Answering) in 2011.

Football career  A ruckman, Natt played 216 games for Port Adelaide between 1972 and 1983. He won two premierships with Port Adelaide in 1980 and 1981. Following his retirement from football, Natt coached local teams in South Australia before moving to the Northern Territory to take up the position of Chief Executive Officer of the Northern Territory Football League.  Politics  In 2005, Natt ran for the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly as the Labor Party candidate in the Palmerston electorate of Drysdale at the 2005 Territory election. He faced extremely daunting odds on paper. Palmerston had long been reckoned as a Country Liberal Party stronghold; Labor had never won a Palmerston-based seat in the history of the Legislative Assembly. The sitting CLP member, Stephen Dunham, held it with a majority of 15.7 percent, making it the CLP's third-safest seat. However, in a result that no one even anticipated, Natt defeated Dunham after recording a two-party swing of 17.5% towards him. Even more surprisingly, Natt won enough votes on the first count to take the seat off the CLP without the need for preferences. Following his election, Natt was immediately named to the cabinet as Minister for Mines and Energy. A redistribution ahead of the 2008 Northern Territory election wiped out Natt's majority, making Drysdale a notional CLP seat. In that election, Drysdale reverted to form as Natt was heavily defeated by CLP challenger Ross Bohlin.  Personal life  Natt's brother Greg also played football for Port Adelaide.

Built by the British, it now serves as the seat of the Penang Island City Council and was previously the seat of the George Town City Council. Originally completed in 1903 as the Municipal Offices, the building was erected at a cost of $100,000 to relieve the demand for office space at the adjacent Town Hall. The name City Hall dates back to the grant of city status to George Town in 1957. Both the City Hall and the Town Hall are located at Esplanade Road, overlooking the historic parade ground (the Padang) within the Esplanade. The buildings are also situated within George Town's UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Town Hall (left) and the City Hall (right) along Esplanade Road, overlooking the Esplanade's Padang. The City Hall and the Esplanade in the 1910s  Architecture  Completed in 1903, the two- storey building combines Edwardian Baroque and Palladian architectural styles. It has been listed as a national monument since 1982 under the Antiquities Act 1976. The building was last renovated between 2004 and 2005. Although the City Hall retains much of its original form, the original arcades or loggias on the ground floor have been enclosed with windows.The City Hall is steeped in Edwardian Baroque and Palladian architecture.  History  The history of George Town's municipal accommodations began in 1873, when a proposal to construct the Town Hall was first mooted.\\"LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL. 23rd February, 1876.\\" The Straits Times [Singapore] 26 February 1876: 2. Print. The construction of the Town Hall commenced in 1879 and was inaugurated in the following year, making it George Town's first municipal building.The Straits Times [Singapore] 31 July 1880: 6. Print.\\"From the Daily Times,17th August. (From our own Correspondent.) Penang, 12th August 1880.\\" The Straits Times [Singapore] 21 August 1880: 2. PrintThe Straits Times [Singapore] 21 August 1880: 5. Print. The Town Hall housed the local government for George Town, the Municipal Commission of George Town and served as a venue for social events for the European elite. However, the Municipal Commission soon deemed the office space within the Town Hall to be insufficient. Hence, plans were drawn up for the construction of another municipal building right next door. Tenders were called for the construction of the Municipal Offices in 1900. Lee Ah Chang, a local ethnic Chinese, won the contract with a bid amounting to $75,400 (Straits dollar). The Municipal Offices was built in the Edwardian Baroque and Palladian styles, which were popular at the time. By the time the Municipal Offices was completed in 1903, its construction cost had ballooned to $100,000 (Straits dollar). The Municipal Commission of George Town decided to covertly relocate from the Town Hall into the adjacent Municipal Offices, and that no inauguration ceremony was to be held. Since the completion of the Municipal Offices, the Town Hall took on a more social function. The Municipal Offices held the distinction of being one of the first buildings in Penang to be completely fitted with electric lights and fans. The Municipal Offices was renamed the City Hall in 1957, when George Town was declared a city by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. Thus, the City Hall served as the seat of the George Town City Council until its eventual merger with the Penang Island Rural District Council to form the Penang Island Municipal Council in 1976. Even after this 1976 consolidation of Penang Island's two local councils, Penangites still referred to the building as the City Hall. Today, the City Hall serves as the headquarters of the Penang Island City Council.

The role has been portrayed by Vincent Irizarry, off and on, from November 27, 1997 to September 2, 2013. The character has been a top television villain for years.TV GUIDE, SOAP PREVIEW, TV Guide (2006-08-12). Retrieved on 2007-12-15 His criminal actions have been alluded to by authors, as well as recognized by their own fictional characters. David evolves, but always remains a force antagonizing heroes and heroines of the series. Casting Guiding Light alum Irizarry joined the cast of All My Children from November 27, 1997 to March 2, 1998, for what was initially meant to be a short term role. Irizarry returned to the series as a contract player on July 8, 1998. Following nine years in the role, Irizarry exited the series on November 28, 2006, with executive producer Julie Hanan Carruthers citing financial and storyline reasons. Following a two-year absence, Irizarry returned to the series on October 23, 2008, and remained with the series until it aired its final episode on September 23, 2011. On December 28, 2012, it was announced that Irizarry reprised the role on the online reboot, which began on April 29, 2013. Irizarry also portrayed the role on One Life to Live for three episodes in February 2005. Storylines 1997‚Äì2006 Dr. David Hayward first arrives in Pine Valley in late 1997 to reclaim his ex-lover, Dr. Allie Doyle. Allie is dating Dr. Jake Martin at the time. When Allie rejects him, David tries to get Jake out of the way. He frames Jake at the hospital by giving stroke patient Adam Chandler the wrong medication. David arrives \\"just in time\\" to play hero, which provides him with enough ammunition to get Jake suspended. David ends up leaving Pine Valley for a short time, but returns less than a year later in an attempt to woo Liza Colby, with whom he has grown infatuated. David remains a common enemy of the Martin family throughout the next several years, constantly at war with Jake and his father, Joe. But it is his obsession with Dixie Cooney, Jake's sister-in-law, which is the fuel for his greatest rival; Tad Martin. At the time, Dixie is just one of the many women in Pine Valley with whom David has a romantic relationship. Another significant relationship he has is with Erica Kane, and although it does not end in marriage, David grows very close to Erica's daughter, Bianca Montgomery. When Bianca suffers heart problems as the result of her eating disorder (anorexia nervosa) it is David who treats her and ultimately helps her survive. When Bianca is grieving for the death of Frankie Stone, David plans a memorial for his cousin and offers to involve Bianca. To help Bianca through her pain, he reveals that his father committed suicide when he was a child. Shortly after his relationship with Erica ends, David pours Libidozone, a drug he created and uses to arouse sexual desires, into a punch bowl at a party aboard a yacht. The drug has the known side effect of causing people to act out on their hidden, restrained impulses. Most everyone aboard the yacht is affected by the drug. The dosing of the punch bowl is eventually discovered and David is arrested. David manages to avoid being convicted of the charges against him by blackmailing Adam (David learns that JR Chandler had stolen drugs from his medical bag) into getting the judge presiding over the case to drop the charges. David comes to meet many family members of which he is not previously aware, including a half-brother named Leo du Pres and a cousin named Maggie Stone. Leo dies in October 2002, while Maggie moves away from Pine Valley in February 2005. David and Leo's mother, Vanessa Bennett, was attempting to shoot and kill Leo's wife, Greenlee Smythe, who she had trapped on a cliff at Miller's Falls. Leo tackled his mother and pulled her off the edge of the waterfall in order to save his wife. Neither body was ever found, but both are presumed dead. Leo's death devastated David. David and then-wife Anna Devane named their daughter, Leora, after David's beloved half-brother. Leora needed a pacemaker. David wanted to wait until Leora was stronger before the surgery. Anna signed off for the surgery without him and Dr. Joe Martin oversaw with the surgery. When David realized Leora was dying, he tried to enter the OR to save her life. Dr. Joe Marin had Tad, his adopted son, remove David from the operating room. Leora died and David blamed the Martins for her death. David was destroyed by Leora's death and he pushed everyone away. He began to see an imaginary five-year-old Leora, talking to this image. Weeks later, David and Anna fight and cry together, realizing they can not mourn for Leora without each other. As they fall to the floor holding each other, a little girl is seen at the doorway (un-seen) by them. She smiles to herself and walks out of the cabin, shutting the door behind her. After discovering evidence that David may have been involved in Michael Cambias' death, Anna goes to David's cabin. Her intention is to leave the evidence and a note. David enters before she could leave. She tells him she is going to Paris to be with Robin and she does not want him to follow her. Anna then walks out the door and David's life. In the early summer 2004, David is stunned to learn that he has a daughter in the form of Pine Valley newcomer Babe Carey, the wife of JR Chandler and mthe other of \\"Bess Chandler\\" (who David had discovered was actually Miranda Montgomery). Babe is the product of a one- night stand with Krystal Carey when he was a student in medical school, and he was completely unaware that the liaison resulted in a child. David loves Babe from the moment he learns she is his child, and even though he helps cover up Babe's lie concerning the true identity of \\"Bess\\", his relationship with her is always rocky. His willingness to cover up Babe's deception severely damages his relationship with the Kane women, with whom he had almost always been close. His crimes concerning the baby switch also cost him his medical license for quite some time, and he is forced to perform community service at Pine Valley Hospital as a janitor. Despite this, David is pleased when Bianca gets her baby back and that Babe's son, AJ Chandler, is actually alive. Towards the end of his second stint in Pine Valley, David exudes hatred for Zach Slater (and it was reciprocated) due to Zach's involvement in Dixie Martin's life. David left Pine Valley in the fall of 2006 after making a video exposing many of his enemies' secrets and leaving it for interested parties to see. Several Pine Valley residents, including Tad Martin and his son Jamie, consider the possibility that David is the serial killer who murdered Simone Torres and Erin Lavery, and attempted to murder Danielle Frye. The killer, also known as \\"The Satin Slayer\\", is later revealed to be Alexander Cambias, Sr. 2008‚Äì2010 David returns to Pine Valley in the fall of 2008. Having been hiding in the tunnels of the Chandler mansion, he first reveals himself right after a series of tornadoes strike the town. He is grief-stricken to learn that his daughter Babe has died as a result of injuries sustained during the natural disaster. Blaming the Chandlers (and, to a lesser extent, Tad) for Babe's death, he decides to seek revenge by gaining custody of Babe's son, AJ. Later, David uses Amanda Dillon to get revenge on JR, knowing that the two of them are friends and Amanda was a good friend of Babe's. Amanda becomes pregnant with David's child. Initially, she passes the baby off as JR's, but David later finds out the truth. Amanda gets help from Jake Martin to keep David away. Jake ends up falling in love with Amanda, much to David's chagrin. He tries to stop their marriage, but he ends up bound and gagged while they exchange vows. On June 12, 2009, Amanda gives birth to a healthy baby boy, David's son. David tracks her and Jake down at a clinic and they let David believe that their son died, which sends David into despair. On August 7, 2009, his daughter, Marissa Tasker, the newly discovered twin sister to his late daughter Babe, is shot. When he goes in for her surgery, he hesitates, saying that he keeps seeing Leora in her place. He makes a vow to Krystal that he will make sure that no one in Pine Valley will hurt their daughter again, seeing as she is the only daughter he has left. On August 28, David kidnaps Liza and gets her to admit that his son with Amanda is alive and that she (Liza) knows and helped keep him from his son, with the help of Jake, Tad and eventually Amanda. On August 31, while talking with Liza, David realizes his son with Amanda is missing. David threatens to have Amanda, Jake, and anyone involved with the plan arrested while he raises their son, Trevor, on his own. Instead, he blackmails Amanda into living with him and their son, Trevor, despite her marriage with Jake. David makes a contract with Amanda which lets her move out his house and share custody of their son if she agrees to have another baby with him through artificial insemination. In November 2009, David also finds out that Trevor is not his son, but he doesn't tell Amanda and instead lets her believe he is dying from a rare blood disease and has six months to live. Amanda finds out in January 2010 that Jake is Trevor's biological father, getting rid of David from their lives permanently. Meanwhile, Ryan Lavery discovers Greenlee's medical records on David's computer, who claims he was using them for research into Amanda Dillon's pregnancy. It is later revealed that David has been keeping Greenlee in Massachusetts while she recovers. Greenlee has been comatose for the past year and has no memory of the accident. Upon her awakening, David tells Greenlee that she is paralyzed and if she does not have surgery to fix her spine, she will remain paralyzed for the rest of her life. She tells David that she wants to do the surgery, but if she dies during surgery, not to tell anybody that she was alive before her death. After successfully recovering from her injuries, Greenlee attempts to visit Ryan but is surprised to see him having sex with Erica. Out for revenge, Greenlee asks David to bring her a hard-drive hidden in Ryan's house. She puts the hard-drive into Fusion's computer and it crashes all the files. Even with Fusion's files being lost, Erica is set out to build Fusion back up once again, and on an interview she tells reporters that whoever crashed Fusion's computers, hasn't destroyed the company. Greenlee feels that she hasn't done enough and decides to stay in Pine Valley. Greenlee asks David to marry her, hoping that when she walks down the aisle at her wedding, everyone will be surprised, and that Ryan will be hurt. Gayle wants to make David pay for what he's done and Erica promises they'll do just that. Erica lays it out for David, telling him she wants him to marry Greenlee, get her out of town and away from Fusion or else. Erica orders David to marry Greenlee, get her to hand Fusion over to Erica and leave town or else Erica will use nurse Gayle to expose David's illegal deeds. Erica reminds David of their deal; marry Greenlee, get her out of town and allow Erica to have Fusion or else David goes to jail. David and Greenlee are pronounced husband and wife. On February 25, 2010, David and Greenlee get married at Wild Wind in secret. David admits to Greenlee that he teamed up with Erica to try to take Fusion from her because she was blackmailing him. David insists to Greenlee they'll work together to double-cross Erica, which Erica overhears. Greenlee and Erica's battle gets even more heated until Erica cheats by making sure Greenlee can't use her packaging. In retaliation, Greenlee sets up Erica for siphoning money from the Miranda Center to her Fusion Glam line with David's help. David also sabotages Erica's plane believing it would delay her just long enough for Greenlee to step in as leader with the scandal being out. This plan backfires with Erica's plane crashing due to her being in a hurry and not checking for any problems with the plane. David is now covering up the fact that he and his mechanic sabotaged his plane while Greenlee is in the dark about Erica's plane. Eventually, Greenlee finds out and though initially mad and tense with David she forgives him and is grateful for David's devotion towards her. Greenlee and David's relationship becomes more tumultuous after the two continuously get caught lying to one another; Greenlee also begins growing closer to Ryan (after he suffers a brain aneurysm she is the one who brings Ryan to the hospital) which David greatly resents. Greenlee eventually has a change of heart about her marriage and tells David that she needs time apart. David requests a last dinner with her, during which he tells Greenlee he has framed her for the Miranda Center scandal and Erica's plane crash. David calls himself \\"a husband trying to hold on to his wife\\" and threatens to use this against Greenlee if she leaves him. On September 7, 2010, David collapses during Caleb's party at the Yacht Club. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Jesse Hubbard must team up with new Liza as his new DA to investigate his murder. Several accusations are made, targeting such people as Asher Pike and Ryan. Greenlee and Marissa both break down into tears. No one knows who the murderer is yet. On September 13, 2010, the medical examiner tells Greenlee that David's autopsy reveals he didn't die of trauma or from a fight, but was poisoned with the drug Digitalis. Greenlee is soon put on trial for her husband's murder. On November 22, 2010, just as Greenlee is sentenced to life in prison for David's death, David shows up in court. He takes the stand and says that he faked his own death to keep Ryan Lavery from Greenlee, and that he managed the deception by bribing the medical examiner. If he couldn't have Greenlee, he says, he wasn't going to let Ryan be with her. His plan all along was for Ryan to appear to have killed him, but he chose to return when he discovered that Greenlee was accused instead. Marissa slaps and verbally attacks him for leaving her, while Kendall explodes and blames him for setting things in motion that led to Zach's death. Greenlee is acquitted, and David is promptly arrested. On November 29, 2010, David escapes the prison transport and attacks Ryan at his house with the intent to kill him and kidnap Greenlee. In the ensuing struggle, David is shot in the back by Erica. It is revealed that Madison North was hit by a stray bullet during the fight. Though David survives the gunshot, he is left comatose, while Erica faces an attempted murder charge. Later, Kendall, devastated to the point of irrationality by Zach's death, impulsively tries to smother David at the hospital, but is stopped by Griffin Castillo. 2011 On January 3, 2011, it is revealed that it was actually Kendall who shot David, but she repressed her memories of the incident. On January 17, 2011, David wakes up shortly after Tad convinces Liza to drop the charges against Erica. David reveals to Erica that he knows it was Kendall who shot him. Upon discovering David's awakening, Marissa offers to be his defense attorney and hopefully get him to turn over a new leaf, but assures her father that if he doesn't do exactly as she says, she will see to it personally that he is thrown in prison. Later, Greenlee visits David in the hospital with divorce papers. Upon realizing that his selfish refusal to let Greenlee go resulted in the needless suffering of several people, including Zach's death and his own bullet wound, David agrees to sign the papers. Ryan, wanting David in jail by his and Greenlee's wedding day, kidnaps David out of his room and sets him up to make it appear as though he is attempting a getaway, after which he is promptly arrested and thrown in jail by Jesse. However, he manages to convince Marissa of the setup. Using his one phone call to contact Kendall, David gets her to come to the police station. In the ensuing confrontation, Kendall begins to suffer from respiratory distress and passes out. After convincing Jesse and Greenlee to temporarily release him in order to help Kendall, David revives her, and she is rushed to the hospital, where it is revealed that Kendall is suffering from an aortic aneurysm and needs heart surgery to survive. After David talks Griffin through an emergency surgery on Kendall inside an ambulance, Erica convinces the Governor to grant David a pardon for his crimes in exchange for him not revealing the truth about the shooting. Marissa takes this opportunity to hopefully ease hostility towards David in town. Later, when an increasingly unstable Annie kidnaps Emma during Ryan and Greenlee's wedding, Jesse finds a picture from the night of the kidnapping that depicts David and Annie together. When the direct approach fails, Ryan tricks him into admitting his guilt in a set-up. David is further shocked when Ryan informs him that Annie is the one who attacked and nearly killed Marissa at the Chandler Mansion. At that moment, Marissa, having been informed of the situation by Greenlee, arrives and threatens to turn David in unless he reveals Emma's whereabouts. David tells them that Annie and Emma are in a cabin in Vermont, and insists that he merely thought that Annie was taking Emma on vacation while Ryan and Greenlee were on their honeymoon. Despite David's attempts to defend himself, Marissa, having completely given up on him now, coldly states she is done with him before storming off. Ryan takes this opportunity to (arrogantly) taunt David, snidely declaring that, while they both may have lost their daughters, at least he (Ryan) is getting his back; only to discover that Annie has gotten away with Emma, as he is unable to find them. On March 3, 2011, David approaches Ryan and Greenlee and offers to help them track down Annie and Emma, and they reluctantly accept. However, David later admits to Greenlee that he needs an \\"image overhaul\\" and helping them find Emma may be just what he needs to get his medical license back and hopefully win back some good favor with Marissa. While David is laying low he has a series of flings with Liza Colby, as she has also recently been publicly humiliated and shunned as it was revealed that she slept with her daughter's boyfriend. When Erica returns from being kidnapped on the eve of her wedding, David is the only one in Pine Valley who realizes that Erica is not herself, but a double, Jane Campbell. They have a relationship in which she falls in love with David and he convinces her, as Erica, to buy Pine Valley Hospital for him. When Jane finally releases the real Erica from her kidnapping, Erica returns to Pine Valley and is disgusted with what Jane has done to her life; including her involvement with David. On July 25, 2011, David is stabbed by Erica in an angry rage. David arrived at the hospital in critical condition. Jake and Griffin realized that David would require emergency surgery to repair the internal bleeding. David insisted that Griffin perform the surgery. According to David, Griffin was the only person who was capable of repairing the damage. David warned Griffin, before the surgery, that if he didn't survive then \\"all of them would die\\". In the final days of the ABC version of All My Children, David is involved with Cara Castillo, who is carrying his child. In the final episode, David is in the Chandler mansion during Stuart's welcome home party. Despite being the one to bring Stuart back from the dead, and Adam being responsible for Stuart's death, Adam tells David he is unwelcome and pays him to leave. 2013 In April 2013, in the revived All My Children, David is released from prison, where he served five years for shooting JR Chandler after he (JR) shot and killed David's daughter, Marissa. David returns to Pine Valley to seek answers about the miscarriage of his baby with Cara and finds JR still in a coma from when David shot him five years prior. Project Orpheus As David regained consciousness, it was revealed to Griffin that Project Orpheus was not just theoretical, but that David had been experimenting on patients. Griffin told Ryan that Maria may have been brought back from the dead as a part of Orpheus. Greenlee speculated that Leo could have been part of Orpheus as well. She had David take her to his secret lab to find out if Leo was still alive. David drugged Greenlee and when she awoke she believed she saw Leo; after reuniting with Leo it was revealed that this was just a dream. Instead, it was revealed that Zach was alive and had been part of Orpheus as well. While David was recovering from his stab wounds; Dixie escaped from David's lab and found her way back to Pine Valley. It was later revealed that she had also been kept alive as a part of the Project.

Medieval accounts of the battle vary with both sides claiming victory, however the Livonian victory being more plausible as Novgorodian- Pskovian forces retreated out of Danish Estonia, with Livonian Knights launching a retaliatory attack on Izborsk and Pskov soon afterwards, in June 1269.  Battle as described in the Livonian Rhymed Chronicle  According to the Livonian Rhymed Chronicle, the only contemporary primary source describing the battle whose text survives in unaltered form to the present day, the combined forces of the two Russian republics invaded the territory of Danish Estonia in January 1268 where they commenced with looting of the countryside. The Danish vassals requested reinforcements from the neighboring territories ruled by the Livonian Order and the Bishopric of Dorpat, which they received in form of 34 Brothers from castles Weissenstein, Leal and Fellin plus an unknown number of lesser troops, and from the Bishopric an unknown number of men under leadership of Bishop Alexander of Dorpat. The contingent of the Livonian Knights was most likely led by a castellan of one of the aforementioned castles, as the Master of the Order, Otto von Lutterberg, was campaigning in the south, in Semgallia (Otto was in Riga on January 16). When all the forces were assembled the native Estonian troops were positioned on the left flank, which they were told to hold during the battle, while the larger group, the Danish king's men, were stationed on the right. The Brothers and their men are mentioned as having fought on all fronts. The death of Bishop Alexander is listed early in the description of the battle. Two formations of Russians advanced upon them but were beaten back and forced to retreat across a broad field, the retreat turning into a rout and a pursuit. Then Prince Dimitri, who is complimented by the chronicler as being brave, managed to regroup about 5,000 men for a counterattack, while the rest of his army had fled. The Brothers forces met Dimitri's attack along a deep river. At that point the Brothers are mentioned to have 180 men plus 80 footsoldiers. The footsoldiers led an attack upon a bridge. Then the Brothers joined the attack and the battle was over with 5,000 Russians dead, the rest defeated and routed. Since the Livonian Rhymed Chronicle identifies the battles where the forces of the Livonian Order or its predecessor, the Livonian Brothers of the Sword were on the losing side, like Battle of Saule or Battle on the Ice correctly, there is little reason to assume the outcome of this battle is stated incorrectly.  Battle as described in the Chronicle of Novgorod  The Chronicle of Novgorod, 1016‚Äì1471, is the main Russian source describing the battle. However, the chronicle was rewritten on multiple occasions, most notably in the 15th century and edited according to the political ideology of the era. According to the Chronicle of Novgorod, the united Russian forces crossed the Narva River and moved towards Rakvere but did not take the town. They looted the countryside and found a huge cave filled with Chuds (Estonians). Unable to attack the hiding Estonians for three days, the Russians finally devise a way to channel some water into the cave which forces the Estonians to flee and many of them are slain. Then the Russians advanced on Rakvere and met the German force at Kegola river. The Russian forces without delay crossed the river and organized their battle lines by placing the men from Pskov on the right, Dmitri's force on the right higher up, the remainder of the Novgorodian forces forming up in the center and on the right. The German iron troops are described as advancing in a great wedge. Then the chronicle lists a long string of names of boyars who were slain in the battle while knyaz Yuri fled. However the Germans are pushed back and pursued as far as the town. At that time another German wedge attacks the Russian transport but due to nightfall the Germans and the Russian main force do not engage each other. The two forces end up facing each other over a close distance but the Germans flee from the battlefield before the sun rises.

Many are illustrated in E. W. Perera's monumental book titled 'Sinhalese Banners and Standards'. The Symbols The Karava Sun and Moon Flag symbolizing the Solar and Lunar Dynasty origins of the community. This flag is also one of the main flags still used by the Karavas at their ceremonies and is another flag referred to in the Mukkara Hatana as granted to the Karavas by King Parakramabahu IV. However the Mahabharata states that the epic Kauravas from whom the Karavas claim descent used flags with the sun, moon and stars in the great Mahabharata war. The ancestral flag of the Karava community The ancestral insignia of the Karava community from a 19th-century illustration The Makara Beknopte History, 1688 describes a white flag charged with a red flag hoisted on royal ships (JRASCB XI No.38 106 & 109). And in the words of Valentine Francois, the 18th century Dutch Historian, ‚Äúthe Karawas displayed a white flag with the device of a particular fish in the centre\\". The Makara, is a composite dragon with a curious mythical structure. It symbolizes the house of Capricorn in the Zodiac to which it has given its name Makara in the Hindu calendar. It has the head of a crocodile, horns of a goat, the body of an antelope and a snake, the tail of a fish and feet of a panther. Makara is half animal half fish and it is sometimes described as having the head of an elephant and the body of a fish. It is generally large and regarded as living in the ocean rather than in lakes or streams. Only Varuna, the spiritual ruler of the world has power over the Makara. It is Varuna's vehicle in Hindu mythology. The Varunakulasuriya clan is the largest of the Karava clans in southern Sri Lanka. The symbolism is extremely interesting. In mythology Varuna is the chief of the Adithyas. Remnants of the name Adithya from the medieval period can still be found in Karava family names. As Adithya is a synonym for Suriya (i.e. the Sun). the Karava clan Varunakulasuriya too signifies Varuna-Adithya. :The Kokila Sandesha poem from the Kotte period refers to the Makara flag as follows: ::Punsanda surindu sanda salakuna adina vara ::Ban sonda telitudew tele tudeni mana hara ::Min dada jaya virudu nada karana piya kara ::An koda mediya tura topa sarivana pavara The ancestral White Elephant flag of the Karavas A 19th century representation of the Karava Makara Flag. The image of the mythical creature Makara is extensively used in ancient Sri Lankan royal architecture. This flag is one of the main flags still used by the Karavas at their ceremonies.

Note the use of flags and other insignia as done by the Karavas todate See Fish and ship symbols of Sri Lanka for the significance of the Fish and Ship symbols on these flags. The Elephant The recurrent Elephant symbol may be from the Mahabharata, Hastinapura which means Elephant city, the capital of the Kaurava kingdom. The great war of the epic Mahabharata is fought over the throne of this city and most incidents in the epic take place in this city. The Sri Lankan chronicle Rajavaliya states that the elephant flag was prominent in Mayadunne's son, prince Rajasinghe's battle at Mulleriyawa against the Portuguese. The battle flag of Sri Lanka, captured by the British from Sri Wikrama Rajasinghe's army. It displays the kettle drum which was beaten before battles and five weapons (panchaudha). In the past, a medallion with panchaudha symbols used to be tied on Karava infants for protection. The practice still survives in rural Sri Lanka and has been now adopted by other communities as well. Patangatim's wife's tombstone from 1691. It bears the Karava insignia: Pearl umbrella, Palm tree, caparisoned Elephant and Fish symbol Click image to enlarge. The tombstone of Patangatim Francisco Piris' wife from St. Thomas Church, Jinthupitiya illustrated here, shows that the Karava heraldic symbols: Pearl umbrella, Palm tree, caparisoned Elephant and Fish symbol were used even on tombstones (JRASCB XXII 387) The flag of the Karava 'Thakura Arta-deva Adithya' clan from 20th century impressions of Ceylon. The colors of the stripes are blue, gold, red, white and purple. The White shield The white shields known as sak paliha or conch shields were also important royal symbols in Sri Lanka's history. The Karava ancestral flag illustrated above displays two of them. The sak paliha was a white shield sometimes with the devise of a conch shell on it and is referred to frequently as a royal symbol in Sinhalese historical texts. According to the Portuguese historian De Couto, it was also used as a royal symbol ( JRASCB XX 187 ). Usage by kin-groups in India Across the Palk Strait, the kinsmen of the Karavas too have used similar insignia in the past. H. R. Pate describes a wedding as follows: A peculiar feature of the wedding is the procession to the bride's house with virudus or banners supposed to be the insignia of the Kingly ancestors of the race. The emblems consist of 21 flags embroidered with representations of various objects, animate and inanimate, such as a Snake, a Peacock, a Palmyra, a Chank, the Sun and Moon an Elephant. A Fish and so on. In addition to these a large Umbrella, a Shield and other trappings are carried. The bridegroom wears a costume called KAPA resembling the state robes of Jathi Thalavi More and white cloths are spread before hi in his path.

Before his graduation, Freel designed a 36-inch experimental free flight model of a flying wing glider. The model flew well enough to justify moving to a full size piloted glider. In 1933, construction was begun at the San Diego High School woodshop, on a 52-foot span flying wing glider. It was completed in 1937 and licensed with identification mark 18131. Elevons were mounted on the trailing surface and were controlled via a unique worm drive. Several flights were made by Kittredge and Freel over hillsides near San Diego. The glider suffered from poor directional control in flight.

At age 26, he moved back into his parents‚Äô home in Northern Virginia and began his second career, as a biographer. His first subject: actor Steve McQueen. Steve McQueen Project: 1989 to 1993 With the Library of Congress at his disposal, Terrill spent the next three-and-a-half years researching the life of McQueen. In December 1993, the 564-page Steve McQueen: Portrait of an American Rebel, was released. The book, noted for its exhaustive research, was featured in numerous publications including USA Today, New York Post, Playboy, Entertainment Weekly, The Washington Post, Variety, Cosmopolitan, Chicago Tribune, San Francisco Chronicle, and the Arizona Republic.http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,301205,00.html Portrait of an American Rebel became a best-seller and has gone into four printings.  More biographies: 1994-2002 Terrill moved back to Phoenix in 1994 and followed his biography on McQueen with collaborations on actor Edd \\"Kookie\\" Byrnes and Barbara Leigh, boxers Aaron Pryor, Ken Norton, and Earnie Shavers (co-authored with Mike Fitzgerald), and basketball legend David Thompson (co-authored by Sean Stormes). In 1999, Terrill was hired by the East Valley Tribune as a daily reporter. He and his wife Zoe also co-authored Sergeant Presley in 2002 with Rex and Elisabeth Mansfield. That same year he took a job with the Chandler Connection, a weekly publication in Chandler, Arizona, which morphed into the Ocotillo Tribune in August 2007. Terrill was hired in 2008 by Arizona State University's Public Affairs Division promoting the university's campus in downtown Phoenix. 2002 to present 2005 saw the 25th anniversary of Steve McQueen's death and with it came another re-examination of his life and work. London-based Plexus publishing updated Steve McQueen: Portrait of an American Rebel, with a new beginning and end chapter. That same year, Terrill met McQueen's last wife and widow, Barbara, and the two began working on a photo book. In October 2006, Terrill released Maravich, co-authored by Wayne Federman, an exhaustively researched biography on the basketball great, who died on January 5, 1988 from a heart defect. The book took seven years to research and write and was done with the cooperation of Jackie Maravich, the athlete's widow. Focus on the Family/Tyndale Publishing released the paperback version of the book in September 2008 called Pete Maravich: The Authorized Biography of Pistol Pete Maravich. Terrill also released Steve McQueen: The Last Mile, which is a 250-page photo book containing more than 150 photos of the actor taken by Barbara McQueen. Elvis: Still Taking Care of Business was released in May 2007. Terrill co-authored with Sonny West, who was Presley's friend and bodyguard for 16 years. West and Terrill spent four years on the manuscript. The book was released in tradeback in August 2008. In 2009 Terrill co-wrote Palm Springs √° la Carte: The Colorful World of the Caviar Crowd at Their Favorite Desert Hideaway with businessman Mel Haber, who is the longtime owner of the Ingleside Inn and Melvyn's restaurant in Palm Springs, California. Terrill will oversee the release of two Steve McQueen books in 2010: \\"Steve McQueen: A Tribute to the King of Cool,\\" (Dalton Watson Fine Books) is a 384-page photo/passage book that was published on March 24, 2010, what would have been McQueen's 80th birthday. \\"Steve McQueen: The Life and Legacy of a Hollywood Icon,\\" (Triumph Books) is a brand new 600-page plus bio on the actor. It was released in November 2010 to commemorate the 30th anniversary of McQueen's death. In April 2011, the Hollywood Reporter announced that two-time Oscar nominee Jeremy Renner will produce and star in an upcoming McQueen biopic based on Steve McQueen: The Life and Legacy of a Hollywood Icon. In 2011 Terrill wrote Downtown Phoenix Campus Arizona State University: The First 5 Years. It tells the story of how ASU President Michael Crow and former City of Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon joined forces to create the Downtown Phoenix campus in less than three years time. The book is available as a free download by visiting http://www.asu.edu/firstfive/ebook.pdf The Arizona Republic named Terrill 'Biographer of the Year' in its annual best of issue in March 2012. 2014 saw the publication of two books: \\"Guitar With Wings\\" (Dalton Watson Fine Books), a photo memoir with Grammy Artist Laurence Juber, former guitarist for Paul McCartney's Wings (1978-1981) and \\"Zora Folley: The Distinguished Life and Mysterious Death of a Gentleman Boxer,\\" a 93-page ebook. Terrill's 19th book \\"Rock and a Heart Place\\" with Ken Mansfield, is an anthology chronicling the spiritual lives of more than a dozen musicians from the rock era. Continuing the rock and roll circuit, Terrill's 20th book was published by Triumph in 2016 as the co-author of \\"Still So Excited: My Life as a Pointer Sister\\" with Ruth Pointer. In 2017, Terrill published two more books on \\"The King of Cool\\" - \\"Steve McQueen: Le Mans in the Rearview Mirror,\\" a coffee-table book with property master Don Nunley on the 1971 racing picture and \\"Steve McQueen: The Salvation of an American Icon\\" with Pastor Greg Laurie, which examines McQueen's decision to become a born again Christian near the end of his life. The book also spawned a feature documentary called \\"Steve McQueen: American Icon\\" in which Terrill served as an executive producer. It was released nationwide on September 28, 2017. Terrill and Laurie partnered again in 2019 for \\"Johnny Cash: The Redemption of an American Icon,\\" continuing on with the series of examinations of pop culture artists who have become born again Christians. A feature documentary is also in the works for 2020. Bibliography *Steve McQueen: Portrait of an American Rebel, (1993) Donald I.

Westbury Christian School is open to students of all faiths, nationalities, and ethnic origins. History Plans for the establishment of Westbury Christian School began in the early 1970s with several families of the Westbury Church of Christ. The school started as a \\"Mother's Day Out\\" activity of the church. Soon, demand required that a licensed day care center be started. Following close behind the successful preschool program was demand for adding elementary grades, middle school, and finally the high school. The school was formally chartered in February 1975 with visionary support from the Westbury Church of Christ elders. Operations Westbury Christian School is independently operated by a board of trustees. The Westbury congregation donated the use of their facilities to the school since the beginning. The church and the school continue to work together sharing facilities Westbury Christian School receives no financial assistance from any government body. Income is realized from tuition and fees, plus special fund raisers. Associate groups, like the Wildcat Athletic Boosters, Parent Teacher Organization, and others, raise funds for special projects.  Accreditation  In 1988, Westbury Christian School received accreditation from two prestigious accrediting agencies: the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and the National Christian Schools Association. Due to the integrity of these two agencies, school credits are potentially acceptable at any educational institution in the USA. In 2006, Westbury Christian School successfully completed a five-year self study that validated its continuing accreditation by the AdvancED and the NCSA. Through a college preparatory curriculum aligned with state curriculum requirements and objectives, high school students can choose from a dozen advanced placement courses, which enable them to receive college credits while in high school with appropriate exam scores. Advanced placement exams are taken at the end of the year, and close of the course. The school also uses the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills and all classes are taught from a Christian perspective. Life in 3D Westbury Christian School offers a three-dimensional program of education for students ages K3-12. It consists of a spiritual development program, an academic development program, and a student activity program. Each of these three dimensions receives equal attention in application. From the time students set foot on the campus in the morning, until they leave school in the afternoon, every movement, regulation and activity is structured with one of the three dimensions in mind. Daily Bible classes, and chapel assemblies are implemented into the curriculum to ensure their students gain a full understanding of the Christian perspective. The administration, faculty and staff are committed as educators and spiritual mentors to the students and as partners with the home. Charlie Ward Tribute to Excellence The Charlie Ward Tribute to Excellence, named after Heisman Trophy winner, former NBA player, and former coach of the Westbury Christian Wildcats Varsity football team, recognizes individuals of distinction, commitment and faith. The Uncommon Community campaign is the continuation of a dream and is moving forward with the assistance of dedicated people who are passionate about serving youth. Athletic tradition Westbury Christian School competes in the Texas Association of Private and Parochial Schools (TAPPS) 5-A district. The varsity boys' basketball program began in 1981, and since its inception, the Wildcats have won 16 state championships. They are consistently ranked among the top schools, both statewide and nationally, each year. Heisman trophy winner and former NBA star Charlie Ward, served as the head coach of the varsity football team from 2007 to 2013. In the 2017‚Äì2018 season, varsity football finished district runner up with a record of 7-3 and made it to the playoffs for a second consecutive year. Notable alumni * Ndudi Ebi, Class of 2003.

It can be found in reefs throughout the Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean as well as the south eastern Atlantic Ocean. It reaches a maximum length of 45 centimeters(18 in.) As the name suggests, it is box-shaped. Boxfish are also known for their armored and rigid body which in most cases would inhibit locomotion. This disadvantage is offset by the boxfish's carapace shape which is much more advantageous for its evolved style of swimming- ostraciiform locomotion. When juvenile, it is bright yellow in color. As it ages, the brightness fades and very old specimens will have blue-grey to black colouration with faded yellow. It feeds mainly on algae, but will also feed on sponges, crustaceans and molluscs. The fish's diet consists of marine algae, worms, crustaceans, molluscs, and small fish. When stressed or injured it releases the neurotoxin tetrodoxin (TTX) from its skin that may prove lethal to the fish in the surrounding waters.Nagashima, Y., Ohta, A., Yin, X., Ishizaki, S., Matsumoto, T., Doi, H. and Ishibashi, T.

However, analysis by scientists suggests that boxfish agility is instead due to the combination of an aerodynamically unstable body and the manner in which the fish use their fins for movement.Yellow boxfish being sold in a restaurant in Jakarta References External links * Information, images and videos of the yellow boxfish * Category:Ostraciidae Category:Fish of the Indian Ocean Category:Fish described in 1758 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ","title":"Yellow boxfish"},{"id":"8063190","text":"Warhammer 40,000 Roleplay is a role-playing game system with multiple source books set within the Warhammer 40,000 universe. The first game using the system, Dark Heresy, was created by Black Industries, which closed soon after the initial release. Official support by Fantasy Flight Games was discontinued in September 2016. The license was later acquired by Ulisses Spiele, who published a new game, Wrath & Glory, in 2018. For Fantasy Flight developed material, the Warhammer 40,000 Roleplay system is explained and used with small differences in a series of independently playable games. Each has a different, narrow focus and multiple supporting books of its own: * In Dark Heresy (2008), the player characters are agents of the Inquisition. * In Rogue Trader (2009), the player characters are important members of ship crews in interstellar trade and exploration, often encountering xenos. * Deathwatch (2010), has a martial focus. The player characters are loyalist Space Marines. * Black Crusade (2011), has a martial focus. The player characters are followers of Chaos (not necessarily soldiers). * Only War (2012), has a martial focus. The player characters are Imperial Guardsmen. When the Warhammer 40,000 Roleplay license was transitioned to Ulisses, the system was re-designed. The first campaign under the new developer is Wrath & Glory, which allows player characters of many different races and backgrounds, and implements a card deck system that is used alongside traditional dice rolling. Gameplay In Dark Heresy, the players assume the roles of Acolytes working for an Inquisitor, who sends them on various missions. Depending on the type of mission, gameplay can involve investigation, combat, intrigue, or other genres. The Game Master is able to tailor their campaign to suit their player group through this flexibility. Since the players work for an Inquisitor, most missions involve rooting out heresies or matters relating to them. The game allows for many other missions, including wiping out dangerous gangs, gathering evidence of corruption, dealing with alien threats or eliminating rogue psykers.Official Fantasy Flight Dark Heresy website In Rogue Trader, players take the role of a Rogue Trader and their crew as they operate outside the stellar and legal boundaries of the Imperium of Man (Imperium). The book provides, among other things, rules for interplanetary commerce and spaceship operation, travel, combat, and customization.Official Fantasy Flight Rogue Trader website In Deathwatch, players take the role of surgically modified super humans known as Space Marines. These individuals are recruited from their native Chapters (fighting units of approximately 1,000 people) to serve as a military arm of the Inquisition, against particularly dangerous heretics known as Chaos worshipers and alien lifeforms known as Xenos.Official Fantasy Flight Deathwatch website In Black Crusade, players take the role of Chaos- corrupted characters. Black Crusade, essentially, is the corrupted version of previously mentioned Warhammer 40,000 roleplaying games. Characters are cast in the role of the villain, with the players actively working against the Imperium and for the forces of Chaos in the sector.Official Fantasy Flight Black Crusade website In Only War, each player takes the role of an Imperial Guardsman, one of the billions of hardened conscripts constantly fighting on myriad fronts at the whim of the Earth-based government of the Imperium (Adeptus Terra).Official Fantasy Flight Only War website Black Industries chose to set Dark Heresy in a previously unknown sector of the game's fantasy universe, the Calixis Sector, within the Segmentum Obscurus. This sector lies adjacent to Scarus Sector, which is the setting of Dan Abnett's Eisenhorn trilogy. Calixis is similarly adjacent to the Koronus Expanse, the setting of Rogue Trader, and to the warzone on the edge of the Periphery Sub-Sector, the setting of Only War. System The Warhammer 40,000 role playing system uses 10-sided dice (d10) exclusively; all information is generated either through a single die roll with numbers one through ten or as a percentage with two 10 sided dice rolled together, one designated as the tens digit and the other a single digit. Characters are created with 9 statistics; *Weapon Skill (WS): Hand-to-hand and melee proficiency. *Ballistic Skill (BS): Governs all projectile and ranged attacks. *Strength (S): Physical strength of a character. *Toughness (T): Resistance to physical punishment. *Agility (Ag): Governs how quickly an individual can move as well as how well they can dodge. *Intelligence (Int): Used to work technology and understand languages and writings. *Perception (Per): How quickly you notice things and in how much detail. *Will Power (WP): Your resistance to horrors and used to manifest psychic abilities. *Fellowship (Fel): Used for interaction with other people. Each attribute ranges from 1 to 100. Very high (above 70) and very low (below 10) scores are extremely unlikely within the game system and utilizing currently published rules. The system scores indicate that your average human is in the 30s range for their abilities and variations will indicate if they are particularly well suited for a task or if it is one of their weaker areas. Game mechanics also introduce a wide variety of special rules that provide bonuses and reductions in certain areas (For example, a character from a hive world has a higher Fellowship, but a lower Toughness.) All actions, like making an attack roll or using a skill, uses the following basic mechanic: *Roll percentile dice *Add bonuses or penalties associated with the action *Compare the result to the appropriate characteristic; equal to or lower indicates success; greater than the characteristic indicates failure. With some character actions the amount by which the character succeeds or fails can add degrees of success for spectacular results. When using degrees of success the GM details the result. Career Paths In Dark Heresy, each player picks a career path for their character, which is similar to a class from other RPG systems such as D&D.; There are eight career paths in the core rulebook, and more added in several source books. In Rogue Trader, one player typically takes the Rogue Trader career path, representing a ship captain who has been granted a warrant to explore and trade outside the limits of the Imperium of Man. The other players act as members of their crew. In Deathwatch, Space Marines are divided into groups based upon their individual abilities. In most campaigns the Squad Leader is either chosen by one of the players or is an NPC controlled by the GM. In Only War, careers are divided to Guardsmen and Support Specialists. Support Specialists are elite members of Imperial Guard that serve beside regular Guardsmen. *Heavy Gunner - Big, strong, and tough, these Guardsmen wield any heavy weapons that are given to the Squad. *Medic - Dodging deadly weapons-fire and explosions, these Guardsmen risk everything to keep their squad-mates alive. *Operator - A bit less leery of the strange technology that the Imperial Guard often employs than their compatriots, these Guardsmen are often entrusted with piloting the Squad‚Äôs transport or other vehicles. *Sergeant - Every Squad needs a strong commander to lead the charge into combat. The Sergeant keeps their soldiers motivated and coordinated through the toughest battles. *Weapon Specialist - The \\"average\\" Guardsman, these individuals perfect the use of the lasgun or other weapons, bringing death to the enemies of the Imperium. *Commissar - These soldiers enforce morale over the rank-and-file troops with an iron fist and the occasional summary execution. *Ministorum Priest - Bringing the light of the God-Emperor to the battlefield, Ministorum Priests inspire the troops around them, not just with their preaching, but by fighting their foes with their massive Eviscerator chainswords. *Ogryn - These immense Abhumans tend to be a bit dimwitted, but act as some of the Imperial Guard‚Äôs most effective shock troops. *Ratling - Short and rotund, these small abhumans are used as infiltrators and snipers. *Sanctioned Psyker - Feared by their enemies and allies alike, the Psykers of the Imperium are capable of bending the roiling power of the Warp to their will - until that power breaks them. *Storm Trooper - These elite soldiers are trained alongside the Commissars in the Schola Progenium. Equipped with some of the best armour and weapons in the Imperium, they are deadly fighters. *Tech-priest Enginseer - Engineseers wade into battle clad in thick armour, tending to the machine spirits of the Imperial Guard‚Äôs many war machines. To advance in their career path, a player character earns experience points (XP) and spends them to gain skills and talents or improve their characteristics. The skills and talents available depend on the Career and the level - or rank - within that path. Once a character has spent the requisite amount of XP, he advances to the next rank of the career, which unlocks new skills and talents for purchase. Each career path also has several options for certain ranks, each path specializing in a different branch of the career. Skills cost 100 XP, 200 XP, or 300 XP to purchase, with more powerful or unusual skills having higher costs. The core rulebook recommends players receive 200 XP for every four hours of play, so players can usually purchase a new skill or two after each session.

Development  Black Industries, the role-playing game imprint of BL Publishing, which is itself a part of Games Workshop, initially farmed out the development of Warhammer 40,000 Roleplay to Green Ronin, the same company that created the 2nd edition of Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay (WHFRP2), before bringing development back in house. Fantasy Flight Games took over development of future products after acquiring the license for the game in 2008. A collector's edition of Dark Heresy - the first release of the game - went on sale on Monday, 10 December 2007, at 16:00 GMT. The 200 copies of the game, individually numbered with an accompanying 'signature' of an in-game Inquisitor, sold out in six minutes. The regular edition was released on 25 January 2008, and a demo booklet was distributed at Gen Con 2007. The game itself shares many design features with WHFRP2. On 28 January 2008, Games Workshop announced that it would close Black Industries - thereby discontinuing Dark Heresy and all the other games published by the subsidiary - to allow them to focus on the commercial success of their novels and core business. On 22 February 2008, Black Industries announced that all Warhammer Fantasy and Warhammer 40,000 RPG, CCG, and select board game rights were being transferred to Fantasy Flight Games, who would continue to publish Dark Heresy.Fantasy Flight/Black Industries press release During late 2008 and 2009, Fantasy Flight started releasing autonomously-developed material for the Dark Heresy game: a collection of heretical factions to pit the player characters against titled Disciples of the Dark Gods, a monster manual called Creatures Anathema, and a mini-campaign in three parts dubbed The Haarlock Legacy. Fantasy Flight also announced a manual on \\"radical\\" inquisitors (covering the most extreme factions, their tactics, equipment, and most prominent figures) and a major expansion allowing players to take their characters to the rank of interrogator, bestowed with an inquisitorial rosette, enjoying augmented prestige and able to summon more powerful allies. On 20 February 2009, Fantasy Flight Games announced Rogue Trader, an addition to the WH40K roleplaying milieu. The initial limited release sold out at the Gen Con 2009 event before a wider release to stores in October 2009.

In 2008, Barbour pleaded guilty to two counts of endangering the welfare of a child, and he admitted to engaging in sexual activities with a 15-year-old on more than one occasion. Early life  Barbour was born April 25, 1966 in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. He graduated from Hofstra University, where he majored in English and Theatre with a minor in Philosophy and Physics.  Theatre credits  Barbour made his Broadway debut in 1993, in the short-lived production of Cyrano: The Musical. He has frequently played emotionally- troubled men in period musicals, including the Beast in Beauty and the Beast, Billy Bigelow in Carousel, Edward Rochester in Jane Eyre (for which he was nominated for a Drama League Award), and Leon Czolgosz in Assassins. He also appeared in the Broadway production of Urinetown, and in the National Tours of The Secret Garden and Camelot.

In 2011, it was announced that he would play the supporting role of Jack Favel in the Broadway musical adaptation of Rebecca. The production was plagued with legal and financial problems, and the production has been indefinitely postponed after multiple delays. Barbour played the title role in the Broadway production of The Phantom of the Opera for nearly three years, from February 2015 until December 2017. He was succeeded by Peter J√∂back.

Gonzales, 487 F.3d 697 (9th Cir. 2007) (previously named Kahle v. Ashcroft) is a First Amendment case that challenges the change in the copyright system of the United States from an opt-in system to an opt-out system. Four plaintiffs, the Internet Archive along with its founder, Brewster Kahle, and the Prelinger Archives and its founder Rick Prelinger, brought the suit against the government for changing the copyright regime. In the past, copyright renewal did not happen by default. Creators needed to renew copyrights after their terms expired to retain the exclusive right to reproduce their work. The Copyright Renewal Act of 1992 removed the renewal requirement, so that all copyrights would last the same term. Now, creators must explicitly remove copyright if they do not desire it. Working from the case law of Eldred v. Ashcroft, which unsuccessfully challenged the extension of copyright, Lawrence Lessig argued that a change in copyright law as drastic as the change from opt-in to opt-out required a review in regard to freedom of speech. The plaintiffs argued that the limitations placed on speech and expression by copyright were drastically expanded and possibly too limiting. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals heard the oral arguments on November 13, 2006. Audio recordings available here The Ninth Circuit rejected Kahle's arguments in an opinion issued January 22, 2007. An eight-page opinion written by Ninth Circuit Judge Jerome Farris stated: \\"They (the plaintiffs) make essentially the same argument, in different form, that the Supreme Court rejected in Eldred. It fails here as well.\\" The Ninth Circuit rejected an appeal for en banc rehearing of the case. An amended opinion substituted the original on May 14. The Supreme Court denied the Plaintiff's petition for writ of certiorari on January 7, 2008.

Taotie are one of the \\"four evil creatures of the world\\". In Chinese classical texts such as the \\"Classic of Mountains and Seas\\", the fiend is named alongside the Hundun (), Qiongqi () and Taowu (). They are opposed by the Four Holy Creatures, the Azure Dragon, Vermilion Bird, White Tiger and Black Tortoise. The four fiends are also juxtaposed with the four benevolent animals which are Qilin (), Dragon (), Turtle () and Fenghuang ().Rong Cheng Shi . The Taotie is often represented as a motif on dings, which are Chinese ritual bronze vessels from the Shang (1766-1046 BCE) and Zhou dynasties (1046‚Äì256 BCE). The design typically consists of a zoomorphic mask, described as being frontal, bilaterally symmetrical, with a pair of raised eyes and typically no lower jaw area. Some argue that the design can be traced back to jade pieces found at Neolithic sites belonging to the Liangzhu culture (3310‚Äì2250 BCE). There is also notable similarity with the painted pottery shards found at Lower Xiajiadian cultural sites (2200‚Äì1600 BCE). Etymology Although modern scholars use the word \\"Taotie\\", it is actually not known what word the Shang and Zhou dynasties used to call the design on their bronze vessels; as American paleographer and scholar of ancient China, Sarah Allan, notes, there is no particular reason to assume that the term taotie was known during the Shang period. The first known usage of Taotie is in the Zuo Zhuan, a narrative history of China written in 30 chapters between 722 and 468 BCE. It is used to refer to one of the four evil creatures of the world : a greedy and gluttonous son of the Jinyun clan, who lived during the time of the mythical Yellow Emperor (c.2698‚Äì2598 BCE). Within the Zuo Zhuan, taotie is used by the writer to imply a \\"glutton\\". Nonetheless, the association of the term taotie is synonymous with the motifs found on the ancient Zhou (and Shang) bronzes. The following passage from L√º Buwei's Spring and Autumn Annals (16/3a, \\"Prophecy\\") states: However, Allan believes the second part of the sentence should be translated as follows because the association between gluttony (the meaning in Zuo Zhuan) and the dings use for food sacrifices to the \\"insatiable\\" spirits of the dead is significant. Li Zehou, a Chinese scholar of philosophy and intellectual history, thinks the description of the taotie in the Spring and Autumn Annals has a much deeper meaning and that \\"the meaning of 'taotie is not [about] \\"eating people\\" but making a mysterious communication between people and Heaven (gods).\\" Bronze motifs ding bronze vessel from late Shang era Scholars have long been perplexed; Quote: \\"To some, the problem of meaning has seemed impenetrable\\" over the meaning (if any) of this theriomorphic design, and there is still no commonly held single answer. The hypotheses range from Robert Bagley's belief that the design is a result of the casting process, and rather than having an iconographic meaning was the artistic expression of the artists who held the technological know-how to cast bronze, to theories that it depicts ancient face masks that may have once been worn by either shamans or the god-kings who were the link between humankind and their deceased ancestors (Jordan Paper). The once-popular belief that the faces depicted the animals used in the sacrificial ceremonies has now more or less been rejected (the faces of oxen, tigers, dragons, etc. may not even be meant to depict actual animals). Modern academics favor an interpretation that supports the idea that the faces have meaning in a religious or ceremonial context, as the objects they appear on are almost always associated with such events or roles. As one scholar writes \\"art styles always carry some social references.\\" It is interesting that even Shang divination inscriptions shed no light on the meaning of the taotie. Later interpretations A vessel with a taotie design from Cernuschi Museum During the Ming dynasty, a number of scholars compiled lists of traditional motifs seen in architecture and applied art, which eventually became codified as the Nine Children of the Dragon (). In the earliest known list of this type (in which the creatures are not yet called \\"children of the dragon\\", and there are 14 of them, rather than 9), given by Lu Rong (1436‚Äì1494) in his Miscellaneous records from the bean garden (, Shuyuan zaji), the taotie appears with a rather unlikely description, as a creature that likes water and depicted on bridges.Lu Rong's Shuyuan zaji is quoted in Yang Jingrong and Liu Zhixiong (2008): \\"\\". The full text of Shuyuan zaji can be found at a number of sites online, e.g. here: However, a well- known later list of the Nine Children of the Dragon given by Yang Shen (1488‚Äì1559) accords with both the ancient and the modern usage of the term: Some scholars believed that the Taotie motif is a reference to Chi You and is used to serve as a warning to people who covet power and wealth. In the Book of Imaginary Beings (1957) Jorge Luis Borges interpreted the figures as representing a dog-headed, double-bodied monster that represented greed and gluttony. In popular culture The Tao Tie (spelled as \\"Tao Tei\\") are the primary antagonists in the 2016 historical-fantasy epic film The Great Wall. In the film, they are depicted as green-skinned quadrupedal alien creatures, with shark-like teeth, eyes located on their shoulders, and the Tao Tie motif visible on their heads. They are shown living in a eusocial hive similar to ants, where they attack the capital of China every 60 years to collect food to feed their queen. Taotie is the name of a warthog enemy character in DreamWorks's animated series Kung Fu Panda: Legends of Awesomeness. Taotie, Shadow of the Yang Zing is a dragon-like creature in the trading card game Yu- Gi-Oh!. Taotie is one of the Four Perils of the Grandis in the MapleStory. The Taotie appear in Valt the Wonder Deer. Alongside the other Four Perils, Taotie is depicted in Highschool DxD/Slash Dog light novel series as a legendary demonic monster, who was exterminated in ancient times and its soul sealed into a Sacred Gear in the form of a masked racoon wielded Nanadaru Shigune, reflecting Taotie's glutoony, its has the power to devour absolutely anything.

It draws students from portions of three towns: Cornwall, New Windsor, and Woodbury, as well as the village of Cornwall-on-Hudson. While it is in the New Windsor ZIP Code, it is located off NY 94 just inside the Cornwall town line. History Two of Cornwall's elementary schools (Willow Avenue and Cornwall-on-Hudson) and the current middle school have served as the district's high school in the past. However, by the late 1990s, with Cornwall's booming population, it was clear that a new building was necessary for the upper grades, and the district sought to build a new high school. Attempts to site the school more centrally within the district near US 9W failed when opposition from a local community activist led to the defeat of a bond issue that would have funded the building. In 1999, voters approved $13 million for the current building (the state picked up the remainder). The two wings, with connecting walkways. Building The current building by CannonDesign, completed in 2003 at a cost of $44.6 million, is the newest high school in Orange County. Its design, frequently compared to an airport terminal, connects two otherwise separate structures built into the 50 acre (20 ha) site's gentle slope with glass-enclosed overhead and ground-level walkways. There are five separate levels, totaling 208,000 square feet (18,720 m¬≤) with a courtyard-like space in between the two. All interiors are painted predominantly white, adorned with student artwork and porcelain tile walls, and colorful accents on classroom floors. The classroom corridors in the rear structure intersect the walkways at oblique angles, meant to echo (along with the steel latticework on the elevated walkways) the railroads in the region's history, particularly the nearby Moodna Viaduct, a spectacular trestle and local landmark depicted on a student painting above the entrance to the library. The library and cafeteria are located on the uppermost level. Their windows flare outward, suggesting a control tower and taking in the ample views of the Hudson Highlands and Storm King Mountain available from the site. The main art room can be viewed through a glass wall adjacent to the main office, and has a separate gallery level. Also up front is an open commons area where students may eat and relax. Not only does the current design allow for a maximum of 1,500 students, more than it currently holds, it can be easily expanded if the need arises at some point in the future. (Needs to be verified, woods and a large slope are to the only possible expansion areas.) The school is divided by academic department by wing. Campus Organic garden Surrounding the building are several athletic fields, tennis courts, a football field, and a track. Students have also started an organic garden on the grounds, with the help of a teacher.

Founded on November 1, 1906 by Adam Welty,Lima Rescue Mission: Who We Are the mission, which is funded completely by donations, provides daily necessities for homeless and needy individuals in and around Allen County, Ohio. It is the second oldest gospel rescue mission in Ohio, and the only facility of its kind in west central Ohio.Association of Gospel Rescue Missions - Ohio The mission is a member of the Association of Gospel Rescue Missions, part of the global city mission movement. History On November 1, 1906, mission founder Rev. Adam Welty moved his family from Bluffton, Ohio to a new home at 207 East North Street in Lima, Ohio. This large rented house would serve as a residence for the family and also a haven for transient men needing food and lodging. It was not until later that Rev. Welty learned that their new home was in the heart of what was then the \\"red light district\\" of the city. Within a few years, the house proved inadequate to care for the number of men coming for help. Although there were no funds in the Mission treasury for expansion Rev. Welty decided that a larger building was necessary. A site at the corner of Central and Wayne was selected and secured with a down payment of $200.00 which Mrs. Welty had managed to save. Construction finally began in March 1916, and was suspended for a time during World War I. In June 1920, the mission was finally able to move into its spacious new building, which is still in use today. In the late 1940s the Rescue Mission began ministering to youth through child evangelism classes held in the mission's chapel. Over time the classes grew and it was realized that a larger, more dedicated space would be needed. In 1964 a large house, known as the \\"Children's Chapel\\" was purchased to meet this need. In 1974, land was purchased to build a new summer day camp, Camp Roberts. The camp, which occupies in Shawnee Township, consists of a lodge, pool, chapel and recreation building.

FWGE is available commercially and is sold under the trade name Avemar. In the U.S., the product is classified as a dietary supplement and is marketed as Awge. Avemar is manufactured in Hungary by Biropharma Ltd., where it is approved as a dietary food for medical purposes for cancer patients.

NCS-1 is a calcium sensor, not a calcium buffer (chelator); thus it is a high-affinity, low-capacity, calcium- binding protein. Frq can substitute for calmodulin in some situations. It is thought to be associated with neuronal secretory vesicles and regulate neurosecretion. # It is the Ca2+-sensing subunit of the yeast phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns)-4-OH kinase, PIK1 # It binds to many proteins, some in calcium dependent and some in calcium independent ways, and switches many of the targets \\"on\\" (some off). ## Calcineurin (protein phosphatase 2B) ## GRK2 (G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2) ## D2 dopamine receptor ## IL1RAPL1 (interleukin-1 receptor accessory protein-like 1 protein) ## PI4KIIIŒ≤ (type III phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase Œ≤) ## IP3 receptor (this activity is inhibited by lithium - a drug used for the treatment of bipolar disorder) ## 3',5'-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases ## ARF1 (ADP Ribosylation factor 1) ## A type (Kv4.3; Shal-related subfamily, member 3) voltage-gated potassium channels ## Nitric oxide synthase ## TRPC5 channel ## Ric8a # Frq modulates Ca2+ entry through a functional interaction with the Œ±1 voltage-gated Ca2+-channel subunit.  Structure  NCS-1 is a globular protein consisting of ten alpha-helices. Four pairs of alpha-helices each form independent 12-amino-acid loops containing a negatively charged calcium binding domain known as an EF-hand. However, only three of these EF hands are functional (the most N-terminal EF-hand does not bind calcium). They could be occupied not only by calcium but also by magnesium and zinc ions . NCS-1 also contains at least two known protein binding domains, and a large surface exposed hydrophobic crevice containing EF-hands three and four. There is a myristoylation motif at the N-terminus that presumably allows NCS-1 to associate with lipid membranes.  Clinical significance  The expression of NCS-1 increases in bipolar disorder and some forms of schizophrenia and decreases in inflammatory bowel disease. NCS-1 has also been linked with Autism. In addition NCS-1 is significant in intelligence in creating curiosity by its function on dopamine D2 receptors in the dentate gyrus, increasing memory for complex tasks. http://www.physorg.com/news172174436.html  History  NCS-1 was originally discovered in Drosophila as a gain-of-function mutation associated with frequency-dependent increases in neurotransmission. A role in neurotransmission was later confirmed in Drosophila using frq null mutants. Work in bovine chromaffin cells demonstrated that NCS-1 is also a modulator of neurotransmission in mammals. The designation 'NCS-1' came from the assumption that the protein was expressed only in neuronal cell types, which is not the case.

Workers World Party. \\"Stonewall combatants Sylvia Rivera and Marsha \\"Pay It No Mind\\" Johnson... Both were self-identified drag queens.\\" STAR was a radical political collective that also provided housing and support to homeless LGBT youth and sex workers in Lower Manhattan. Rivera and Johnson were the \\"mothers\\" of the household, and funded the organization largely through sex work. STAR is considered by many to be a groundbreaking organization in the queer liberation movement and a model for other organizations.Trap Door: Trans Cultural Production and the Politics of Visibily. ed Reina Gossett, Eric A. Stanely, and Johannah Burton. \\"Trans History in a Moment of Danger: Organizing Within and Beyond 'Visibilty' in the 1970s\\" by Abram J. Lewis  History   Origin  Both founders were long- term civil rights activists, and were present during the 1969 Stonewall riots and the intense period of gay organizing that began in the wake of Stonewall.Feinberg, Leslie (1996) Transgender Warriors: Making History from Joan of Arc to Dennis Rodman. Boston: Beacon Press. p. 131. On September 20, 1970, a sit-in protest was staged at Weinstein Hall of New York University after the administration cancelled planned dances there. Reportedly, The Christopher Street Liberation Day Committee, who were organizers of the first Gay Pride Parade, held on the first anniversary of the Stonewall riots, coordinated a series of four dances, to be held at Weinstein Hall as fundraisers for legal, medical and housing services for the gay community. The \\"Dance-a-Fairs\\" were booked with the Weinstein Hall Student Governing Association and it was later speculated that administration canceled the later dances because a gay organization was sponsoring the events. The sit-in was held by NYU Gay Student Liberation, Gay Liberation Front (GLF), Radicalesbians and other activists. Over the course of the five day sit-in, during which time activists planned and networked extensively among themselves, Rivera first got the idea for what would eventually become STAR House. During the final day of the sit-in, the activists were forcibly removed by riot police. After their removal, activists gathered on the steps of Weinstein Hall. Rivera and other homeless trans activists were the last to disperse, after other activists had abandoned the demonstration. Soon after Rivera published a flyer titled \\"GAY POWER-WHEN DO WE WANT IT? OR DO WE?\\" under the name Street Transvestites for Gay Power, which was critical of those unwilling to fight for \\"Gay Power\\", and of police abuse of gay individuals.  Official formation and STAR House  STAR was officially founded after the Weinstein Hall sit-ins. Initially Rivera wanted Johnson to be the president of STAR, but Johnson declined, saying the offer was flattering, but that someone who thought in a more linear manner, and who was better at long-term planning, would be better for the job. In addition to holding meetings and attending demonstrations during this time, STAR sought to provide housing for homeless trans and gay youth. Both Rivera and Johnson were often homeless themselves. When they were able to rent a hotel room or an apartment, they would sneak homeless friends into their rooms - sometimes up to 50 at a time. Together with the GLF, STAR hosted a fundraising dance on November 21, 1970, and with these funds they were able to purchase STAR House. They found a 4-bedroom apartment in a run-down building at 213 East 2nd Street, in the East Village in New York. The apartment had no electricity or heat, but they began working to repair it. Rivera and Johnson used to hustle the streets in order to keep everyone fed and sheltered, and to keep \\"their kids\\" (the runaways they took in) from having to do the same. This STAR house was only active until July 1971.  Further activism and decline  After the end of STAR House, STAR began to shift its focus towards achieving recognition for trans individuals within the gay liberationist movement, and in society at large. Their next large action was to join other activists in the campaign for Intro 475, a municipal bill which Gay Activists Alliance helped introduce, and which sought protections against sexual orientation discrimination. Members of STAR and Queens Liberation Front criticized GAA for ignoring protections for trans individuals, which they believed was an intentional move to ensure the bill's passage. During the course of hearings for Intro 475, Rivera read a statement concerning the physical abuse of and denial of housing to trans individuals. In 1972 STAR stopped holding meetings, and saw a decline in demonstrations. While STAR had no official termination date, Rivera marks the 1973 Christopher Street Liberation Day Parade as the death of STAR. Believing that gender nonconforming individuals, the STAR contingent, and drag queens in particular were intentionally being asked to stay at the back of the march and off the stage, Rivera and fellow queen Lee Brewster stormed the stage during feminist activist Jean O'Leary of Lesbian Feminist Liberation's speech. They jumped onstage and Rivera shouted \\"You go to bars because of what drag queens did for you, and these bitches tell us to quit being ourselves!\\"Clendinen, Dudley, and Nagourney, Adam (1999). Out for Good, Simon & Schuster. , pp. 171‚Äì172.Duberman, Martin (1993). Stonewall, Penguin Books. , p. 236. Rivera took the microphone and criticized other gay liberationist activists for their assimilationist agenda, especially their lack of concern for their incarcerated brothers and sisters, who in seeking help from the community, \\"do not write women. They do not write men. They write to STAR.\\" Rivera then led a chant for \\"Gay power\\". Jean O'Leary then resumed speaking and criticized drag as misogynist and demeaning. Lee Brewster of Queens Liberation Front followed O'Leary, criticizing lesbians who sought to exclude trans individuals from the gay liberation movement. For Rivera, O'Leary's comments represented a gay liberationist movement which had increasingly come to exclude queens and gender nonconforming individuals. After the rally Rivera chose to leave the movement for years, moving to upstate New York.  Resurrection  Following the June 20th, 2000, murder of Amanda Milan, Rivera briefly \\"resurrected\\" STAR on January 6, 2001 under the new name Street Transgender Action Revolutionaries. After being honored in Italy, Rivera continued to work to advance the fight for the transgender civil rights bill in New York City and State and to fight for self-determination for all gender non-conformists.  Political Ideology  Sylvia Rivera and Marsha P. Johnson were outspoken about their insistence for freedom. The members of STAR wrote a manifesto in 1970 outlining the group's political ideology and demands, in which they identify themselves as a revolutionary army opposed to the system. The Manifesto condemns homophobia, racism, targeted incarceration, police harassment, and the predatory behavior of men in prison against the gender nonconforming and gay prisoners who write to STAR. Among their demands are the right to self- determination, and an end to job discrimination and street harassment. The Manifesto exhibits a socialist and third gender perspective, with its demands for free education, healthcare, food and social services for all oppressed peoples, and language that distinguishes the members of STAR from either the gay men's or the women's communities of the time. From Rivera and Johnson's perspectives, personal freedom was not only dependent on their own individual rights, but on the liberation of all oppressed peoples. Later activism by founders Johnson was later an activist and organizer with ACT-UP. In 1992, Johnson's body was found in the Hudson River, off the Christopher Street docks, under suspicious circumstances. While Johnson's death was initially dismissed by the police as a suicide, friends, family, and several witnesses believe Johnson was murdered. Pressure from the public has led to the case being reopened. As the mainstream of the gay community became more assimilationist, Rivera in particular often found herself at odds with New York pride parade organizers and other mainstream LGBT groups that practiced \\"respectability politics\\" or who saw drag as misogynist. Despite mainstream opposition, Rivera continued to press for the inclusion of trans, and all gender-nonconforming people, in LGBT organizations and legislation. After living in upstate New York for many years, Rivera returned to New York City after Johnson's death, again living for a time at the \\"gay pier\\" at Christopher Street docks, and working to organize and support homeless people, especially those with AIDS and substance abuse issues.Shepard, Benjamin Heim and Ronald Hayduk (2002) From ACT UP to the WTO: Urban Protest and Community Building in the Era of Globalization. Verso. pp.156-160 Sylvia Rivera's obituary via MCCNY Rivera died of liver cancer in 2002. Legacy In 1995, Rusty Mae Moore and Chelsea Goodwin, inspired by STAR House, created their own household and shelter called Transy House, where Sylvia Rivera would eventually live once returning to New York City after Marsha Johnson's death. In an interview in the 2012 documentary, Pay It No Mind: The Life & Times of Marsha P. Johnson, Johnson credits Rivera with founding STAR, and Johnson and friends discuss the work accomplished by the group. In 2013, Untorelli Press published Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries: Survival, Revolt, and Queer Antagonist Struggle, a collection of historical documents, interviews, and critical analyses relating to STAR.

It was considered a revolutionary advance for four wheel drive automobiles into the mainstream consumer market and its electronic/vacuum controlled locking center differential was rare in a passenger car. The system originated in Japan under the GT-Four name in 1986, but was not released in the U.S. until 1988 under the All-Trac name. Technical information The All-Trac system had five main parts: the front differential, rear differential, center differential, the transmission, and the transfer case. The transmission, front differential, center differential and transfer case are all one large assembly and are connected to the transversely mounted engine. The transmission bell housing, front differential and center differential can be separated from the transfer case sub assembly. The transmission output shaft feeds power into the front/center differential assembly (the center differential is contained within the front differential). The center differential applied equal torque to both the front and rear wheels. For all manual transmission models except Previa, and the 1988 and newer Celica, there is a small button inside the vehicle labelled Center Diff. Lock and when activated, the transfer case locks, resulting in the front and rear differential input shafts being driven at the same speed. The result of this is that if the vehicle is in a situation where traction is uneven or poor (i.e. muddy or snowy), the car can move with traction in either the front or rear wheels. For the Celica, the original ST165 GT-Four of October 1986 had \\"Center Diff. Lock\\" with switch located near the hand brake, and starting from the facelift model of October 1987 came with transfer case contains a viscous coupling unit that provides 50/50 power distribution to the front and rear differentials at all times, as in the Previa All-Trac models. Neither the Previa nor the Celica have a lockable transfer case, but the viscous coupling can be temporarily disabled for testing purposes via a selector switch on the transfer case assembly. The vehicle should not be driven with the viscous coupling disabled as transfer case or transmission damage will occur. Some Celicas were equipped with a Torsen torque-biasing rear differential which apportions torque to the left and right wheels depending on available traction, up to a mechanically determined maximum torque bias ratio or TBR.

For the 1988 model year when the U.S. All-trac system arrival, the Celica GT-Four / All-Trac had changed the transfer case to a viscous coupling unit.

The term kikokushijo is more well-known both in Japan and in the English literature about them. Awareness in the United States of third-culture kids and the issues they face is much lower than similar awareness of kikokushijo in Japan. Prevalence As of 2002, roughly 10,000 children of Japanese expatriates return to Japan every year, with a total of roughly 50,000 residing overseas at any one time, a number that had remained roughly constant during the previous decade after rapid growth in the 1970s and 1980s.Kano-Podolsky 2004: 71, 74 Only 40% attend Japanese schools while living overseas.Iwabuchi 1994 Challenges The Japanese Ministry of Education recognised as early as 1966 that Japan's school system faced challenges in the education and re-integration of children who had returned from overseas.Kano-Podolsky 2004: 72 Under the idea of nihonjinron, which stressed the alleged uniqueness of Japanese society, kikokushijo began to be characterised in the 1970s as problem children who needed assistance in readjusting to Japanese society; they were thought to be too Westernised and individualistic. Much of the image of kikokushijo as \\"educational orphans\\" in need of \\"rescue\\" came from the parents of such children. During the 1980s, however, kikokushijo came to be seen as a new elite rather than as problems; their language and cultural skills gained respect as valuable tools for the internationalisation of Japan.Kano-Podolsky 2004: 73 As of 1997, over 300 universities offered relaxed admissions criteria for kikokushijo, a system which had been attacked as preferential treatment and reverse discrimination.Kanno 2000: 4 They are often misperceived as fluent speakers of English, though many in fact resided in non-Anglophone countries.Kano-Podolsky 2004: 74 See also *Gireogi appa *Haigui References Sources   Further reading  *Fry, Rieko (Witan International College). \\"Politics of education for Japanese returnee children.\\" Compare: A Journal of Comparative and International Education.

The band was formed in 2000 by Max Bemis and his friends, and within two years, they self-released two EPs and a full-length album. In 2003, the band signed with their first label, Doghouse Records. A year later, they released ...Is a Real Boy. To support the album, they picked up new members and began touring; however, despite rapidly growing critical and fan acclaim, Bemis' health problems, including bipolar disorder and drug addictions, sidelined the band in 2005 as five band members left during the year. Say Anything signed with J Records in 2005 and, following Bemis' successful rehabilitation, re-released ...Is a Real Boy on J Records. They went on co-headlining tours with Saves the Day in 2006 and Hellogoodbye in 2007. In 2008, Say Anything went on a headlining tour across the US and UK and appeared on every date of Warped Tour. The band announced its retirement in 2018, months before the 2019 release of their eighth LP, Oliver Appropriate. History Early years (2000‚Äì2004) The band was formed in 2000 by Max Bemis and four of his friends as Sayanything. Within two years, they self-released two EPs, Junior Varsity and In Your Dreams, and the full-length Baseball: An Album by Sayanything. In 2002, Sayanything added a space to their name to become Say Anything. In late 2002, Bemis and Linder recorded the Menorah/Majora EP and released the album online. By this point, Say Anything's releases had generated \\"a major bidding war\\". Drive-Thru Records pursued the band and called Max Bemis \\"the next Bob Dylan.\\" Brett Gurewitz of Epitaph Records recorded \\"A Boston Peace,\\" one of the dorm-room demos, with the band. In early 2003, Say Anything signed with Doghouse Records stating sarcastically that Doghouse \\"put out such obscure, borderline D.I.Y. records as The All-American Rejects.\\" After signing with the label, Bemis began writing songs for his band's Doghouse debut. Bemis went into the studio with Florida producer Paul Trust. They recorded 3 songs that were not released although one of the songs entitled \\"Spider Song\\" would later appear on a Doghouse compilation. With tremendous self-created pressure, he threw himself into pushing the sonic boundaries of the band and maturing their sound, incorporating elements of math-rock, indie-pop and theatrical pomp. He and Linder also started the search for a producer. The two met several producers but eventually decided on Tim O'Heir and Stephen Trask. Bemis struggled with different ideas for the record and decided the album should focus on \\"the artistic struggle, the fact that every creative person has this sick ambition to affect some sort of change in society with their art, to be more than just a guy in a band or a poet or a sculptor.\\" Bemis originally intended the album to be a rock opera with a full script, narration, and a cast of characters. It was tentatively titled Zona! Zona! However, Bemis became overwhelmed by the entire process of writing and playing most of the instruments and had a breakdown. \\"I literally lost my mind while we were recording,\\" stated Bemis regarding the breakdown. The breakdown was precipitated by a mockumentary discussed by Bemis and O'Heir. Bemis' condition led him to believe he was being secretly filmed for the mockumentary; the situation culminated in him walking the streets of Brooklyn thinking he was being filmed while encountering friends (who were actually strangers). After recovering, Bemis decided to focus solely on the music and dropped the idea of a script. Around July 2003, the band began recording ...Is a Real Boy, their first album with Doghouse Records. Bemis said the two people he wanted to \\"outdo with ...Is a Real Boy were Andy Warhol and Jesus.\\" In addition to working with O'Heir and Trask, Say Anything worked with Forrest Kline (of power pop band Hellogoodbye) to record the For Sale... EP, released in 2004. The band also worked with ECA Records to record a promotional album that was never released. ...Is a Real Boy was released August 3, 2004. The album featured Linder on drums and Bemis on vocals, guitar, bass guitar, and keyboard. ...Is a Real Boy received positive reviews, including a 99% from AbsolutePunk.net and four and a half stars (out of five) from Allmusic. When the band began touring in support of ...Is a Real Boy, they picked up Dan DeLauro, Casper Adams, and Kevin Seaton. Say Anything at Syracuse University in 2007 Say Anything signed with J Records in 2005, owned by Sony BMG Music Entertainment, one of the \\"big four\\" record labels. When asked why he signed with a major label, Bemis stated, \\"We were looking to expand our fan base as well as have more money to tour comfortably. I also wanted enough money to work with an awesome producer for [In Defense of the Genre].\\" In June 2005, Say Anything was forced to cancel a six-week headlining tour with Circa Survive and Emanuel on the third day of the tour due to health problems with Bemis, including \\"full-on paranoid delusions\\" in Austin, Texas. At this point, Bemis' bipolar disorder and drug addictions were wreaking havoc on the band. Bassists DeLauro and Seaton had already parted ways with the band. Andy Jackson left in September after only a few months of touring with Say Anything. Casper Adams, who was clashing personally with Bemis despite a close friendship, was fired after a show. On October 3, 2005, Bemis had another breakdown; this time, it involved depressive behaviour, spitting in food at an outdoor cafe, spending a \\"half-hour pouring a bowl of soup onto the floor, one spoonful at a time,\\" engaging in a street fight and finally being admitted to a mental hospital by an off-duty policeman. This incident forced Say Anything to cancel another tour, this time with Bemis' personal idols Saves the Day, along with Senses Fail and The Early November. The band was replaced by Emanuel. After returning from his stay in the hospital, Bemis' mother and the remaining members of the band selected the Menninger clinic in Houston, Texas, to rehab Bemis. Eventually, Bemis approved of their decision, admitted himself to the Menninger clinic, and has reportedly not had a relapse since. ...Is a Real Boy (2005‚Äì2007) Under J Records, Say Anything re- released ...Is a Real Boy with a bonus CD entitled ...Was a Real Boy on February 28, 2006 (although the album was originally slated for release on October 18, 2005 and later January 17, 2006). However, copies were leaked before the release by Tower Records and His Master's Voice, with some copies selling on eBay at inflated prices. According to the album's liner notes, ...Was a Real Boy was originally intended as charity record and recorded in Kevin Seaton's garage. Bemis said that \\"it was J Records' idea to reissue ...Is a Real Boy. They believe it has a mainstream appeal that wasn't really reached when Doghouse released the record.\\" Around this time, the band also released \\"Alive with the Glory of Love\\" as a single. Alex Kent joined the band to play bass guitar after the band met him while touring with Lance's Hero. Jake and Jeff Turner joined to play guitar and help with backup vocals after Adams and Jackson left. Parker Case completed the sextet when he joined to play guitar and keyboard after his previous band JamisonParker broke up. At the time, JamisonParker and Say Anything shared the same manager, Randy Nichols; the band met Case while at a train station on the way to Nichols' wedding. In summer 2006, Say Anything toured with Dashboard Confessional; Ben Lee was with the tour in the US, while John Ralston joined the tour in Canada. The band was asked to be a part of the Warped Tour 2006, but instead opted for the Dashboard tour. Bemis later made statements implying he did not feel he was emotionally ready for a Warped Tour. Say Anything completed one of their first headlining tours in fall 2006, when they toured with Piebald and mewithoutYou. Days Away, Brazil and Forgive Durden opened for the band on select dates. In February 2007, Say Anything performed on Last Call with Carson Daly. The band also released their second single, \\"Wow, I Can Get Sexual Too,\\" which was from the ...Was a Real Boy bonus disc. Also in that month, the band announced a co-headlining tour with Saves the Day and The Almost, John Ralston, The Dear Hunter, and Manchester Orchestra as openers on select dates. The band completed the tour successfully during April and May of that year. In August, Say Anything announced a co-headlining tour with Hellogoodbye sponsored by MySpace. The tour took place during fall of the same year with shows in the US and Europe. Bemis and Linder at Warped Tour, 2008-07-24 In Defense of the Genre (2007‚Äì2008) In the weeks before the release of their third album, Say Anything released several songs from the album on MySpace. They also announced pre-ordered copies could be ordered with a signed CD booklet. The band released their first single from the new album, \\"Baby Girl, I'm a Blur\\", on October 2, 2007. In Defense of the Genre was released on October 23, 2007. It was released in a dual-disc format complete with 27 songs and contained many guest vocals. When asked about the name of the record, Bemis said, \\"Whatever 'genre' (or music) one loves needs a defense, because half the world is too ignorant to really understand something before they dismiss it.\\" Before recording the record, Bemis stated, \\"I hope that [In Defense] will be more inspiring and uplifting. I want [the record] to be The Joshua Tree with balls on laughing gas.\\" Andy Jackson, a former member of the band and close friend of Bemis, along with Liam Ortmeier was responsible for recording many of the cameo appearances. He recorded some cameos while at the Warped Tour 2007 with Hot Rod Circuit and others in his home studio. Jackson recorded vocals from several musicians, such as Gerard Way, Adam Lazzara, Anthony Raneri, Anthony Green, Hayley Williams, Aaron Gillespie, Jordan Pundik, and Chad Gilbert. Chris Conley and several others also provided guest vocals. Alternative Press called the record \\"a truly magnificent sophomore effort\\" and gave it a 4.5/5, while Spin gave the album four stars and Corey Schmidt of PastePunk said, \\"There are a few really great songs here.\\" In January 2008, Say Anything announced a US headlining tour with Manchester Orchestra, Biffy Clyro and Weatherbox. The tour took place in March and April of that year. After finishing this tour, Say Anything announced a headlining tour in the UK that took place in June. The tour was in support of In Defense of the Genre, which was released in the UK on June 23, 2008. Say Anything released the video for \\"Shiksa (Girlfriend)\\" on April 9, 2008. On April 25, Say Anything performed on Late Night with Conan O'Brien. During summer 2008, Say Anything joined the Warped Tour for the first time, appearing on all dates. On August 1, 2008, Say Anything announced the Max Bemis Song Shop, through which users could pay for Max Bemis to write a song based on a short writing by the customer. However, by the end of the night, the item was no longer available with the following text displayed on the item listing: \\"We're sorry but Max can't write songs as fast as you are requesting them. As soon as he catches up we will start again. Thank you so much for believing in our crazy idea.\\" The Song Shop has reopened semi-annually since its initial launch, and taken down after about a week each time. This aforementioned message has been displayed each time the Song Shop was discontinued. Say Anything (2008‚Äì2009) In an online chat with fans on March 14, 2008, Max Bemis stated that the band has plans to record a new record called This Is Forever. He said it will be \\"about God and how we relate to Him.\\" AbsolutePunk.net reported on August 1, 2008, that J Records \\"picked up the option for Say Anything's next release.\\" On November 10, Bemis announced that the focus of the fourth album changed and the new record will be self-titled. He noted that the album, which will be released in 2009, will ask \\"what the point of all of it was.\\" Though Max has explained that he was very proud of In Defense of the Genre, he described it as being more of an \\"homage to sort of a lot of the bands that we liked and, like, a style that we respected.\\" He then explained that the new album would be \\"more concise and would be a bit more original, I want to say, and sort of pop out like Is a Real Boy did.\\" He also explained that this CD has both the catchiest and most mature songs they've ever recorded and called it a \\"step forward.\\" During a concert at the College of Saint Rose in Albany, New York on April 25, 2009, Max Bemis proclaimed to the crowd that the newest album titled \\"Say Anything\\" is complete, and will be released \\"early summer,\\" after stating that he was married three weeks prior to the event on April 4, 2009. According to Say Anything's In Studio website, on May 21, 2009, Max posted a blog stating \\"I just wanted to let you guys know we‚Äôre done recording our new record, entitled \\"Say Anything\\", and we‚Äôre moving into the mixing phase. It should be out this fall. This record is kind of a new start, or at least a new phase in the Say Anything story.\\" Max posted a blog on Myspace.com saying that the new album will be released October 13, 2009, and will be titled Say Anything. The self-titled album will be released by RCA Records and will have 13 tracks, including \\"Hate Everyone\\", the album's first single. \\"Hate Everyone\\" was officially released on August 25, 2009, after WBRU FM in Providence, RI became the first radio station to debut the single on the 17th. Lead singer Max Bemis also premiered the song \\"Crush'd,\\" performing the song acoustic in WBRU's studio. The corresponding video for Hate Everyone was released on MySpace Music on September 1, 2009. The new album's release date had been delayed by three weeks and was officially released on November 3, 2009, after being posted to the band's Myspace page on October 28. On August 19, 2010, it was confirmed that Say Anything and RCA Records had parted ways. Max Bemis also announced via his Twitter account that big changes were to be announced during the following week. On September 29, 2010, it was announced via Say Anything's official website that Alex Kent would be leaving the band, and that Kenny Vasoli of The Starting Line would be temporarily taking over as bassist for their upcoming tour. On October 24, 2011 it was announced that Adam Siska was officially joining Say Anything. Side projects (2008‚Äì2011) After recording In Defense of the Genre, Say Anything band members Max Bemis and Coby Linder worked with Saves the Day's Chris Conley and David Soloway on a side project named Two Tongues. The group features Bemis and Conley sharing lead vocals and guitar duties with Soloway on bass guitar and Linder on drums. Thirteen songs were recorded in Electric Ladybug Studio, Conley's home studio in Chico, California. Bemis, Conley, and Linder previously collaborated on a cover song of Bob Dylan's \\"The Man In Me\\" for the compilation album Paupers, Peasants, Princes & Kings: The Songs of Bob Dylan released by Doghouse Records in 2006. The group's self-titled debut was released on February 3, 2009. Say Anything band members Jake and Jeff Turner self-released their six-track EP Some Day in May 2008 under the name XO. They recorded it with Matt Malpass in Atlanta in January 2008 at Monsters and Marigolds Studio. The album features both brothers on vocals, guitar, bass, and keyboard, with Jeff also playing drums. Around the same time, Parker Case embarked on a solo project named I and the Universe, while Alex Kent started a record label, Gnome Records and began work on his own solo effort under the name Alexander T. Kent. Alex also has a side project with members of Japandi and Witt called Qwermicide. In 2008, Say Anything featured on the Punk Goes Crunk album covering Ol' Dirty Bastard's \\"Got Your Money\\". In 2009, Max and his wife, Sherri DuPree (From the band Eisley) formed a small side project named \\"Perma\\" and were selling the demo during the 2009 tour. In early 2010, the band announced that they will be opening for Angels and Airwaves on their LOVE tour which kicked off on April 5. In August 2010, Max announced that he will be releasing a \\"lo-fi\\" post-punk album in Fall 2010 under the name \\"Max Bemis and The Painful Splits.\\"Altpress.com Say Anything also toured with the bands Motion City Soundtrack and Saves the Day in the fall of 2010. Bemis commented on it on his Twitter, claiming that Say Anything's fans might want to come up with their favorite Two Tongues songs, insinuating that the group will play a few songs on the tour. Anarchy, My Dear (2011‚Äì2013) On 13 July 2011, Max Bemis posted a video on the band's website announcing that the band has officially signed with Equal Vision Records, he also stated that Tim O'Heir, who produced their second record ...Is a Real Boy would be producing Say Anything's fifth studio record. Additionally, Bemis stated Equal Vision had acquired the rights to Say Anything's past releases, as he cited the proposed re-release of Baseball. Bemis announced via an October 6 interview with AltPress.com that the name of the new record was Anarchy, My Dear, and this was later confirmed by Bemis and the rest of the band via Twitter. Anarchy, My Dear was released on March 13, 2012. On April 20, 2012, the music video for the song \\"Say Anything\\" premiered on mtvU. On November 9, 2012, Equal Vision announced a statement that confirms the release of the re-release of the Say Anything record Baseball, the Menora/Mejora EP, the \\"Dormroom Demos\\", Junior Varsity, and other various rarities in a triple-CD box set that are limited to 5000 physical copies. A citation and more information can be found at Equal Vision's website. On December 28, 2012, it was announced via Say Anything's Facebook page that Coby had left the band on good terms. Max Bemis stated the following in regards to seeking a new drummer \\"Say Anything will continue on without Coby but we will not be seeking a replacement drummer to play on the records we put out, as Coby and his style of drumming is, in many senses, irreplaceable; rather we plan on having a multitude of drummers play on our material. Say Anything on record will now be identified in the same way Nine Inch Nails is, in that it‚Äôs pretty much me and whoever I choose to play with at the time. Live shows will continue to have their own identity including Jake, Jeff, Parker, Adam, and whoever plays drums for us live. The band couldn‚Äôt be further from breaking up, and as I‚Äôve said recently, we plan on releasing music as Say Anything forever, and already have a lot in the works.\\"  All My Friends Are Enemies: Early Rarities (2013‚Äì2014)  On January 22, 2013, Say Anything released All My Friends Are Enemies: Early Rarities, a three-disc compilation consisting of all of the material recorded by Say Anything prior to the release of ...Is a Real Boy. Disc one of this compilation is a copy of Baseball: An Album by Sayanything; disc two is Menorah/Majora EP and the Dormroom Demos; and disc three is titled Junior Varsity and includes all the songs from the first Junior Varsity (in Your Dreams) EP, in addition to other tracks. Overall, the album contains 45 remastered B-side tracks from the early days of Say Anything. The band toured from June 6, 2013 to late summer to promote this album. Hebrews (2014‚Äì2015) On January 13, 2014, wife of Max Bemis, Sherri DuPree-Bemis published an Instagram photo stating that the new Say Anything album is almost mixed. The band's record, Hebrews, was released June 10, 2014 on Equal Vision Records. The album was the first album that was self-produced by front-man Max Bemis. Bemis worked in the studio with audio engineer Garron DuPree for many months while recording the album at Bemis and Dupree's own studio in Tyler, TX. The album was mixed by mix engineer Brad Wood, and mastered by Emily Lazar. It returned to the collaborative nature of the band's earlier material, with guest vocals including Jon Simmons of Balance and Composure, Tom Delonge of Blink 182 and Angels and Airwaves, Andy Hull of Manchester Orchestra, Brian Sella of The Front Bottoms and Jeremy Bolm of Touche Amore. The album was met with positive reception by fans and critics upon its release, and the group embarked on a successful headlining tour in support of the album in the summer of 2014. I Don't Think It Is (2016‚Äì2017) At about midnight EST on February 4, 2016, Say Anything released I Don't Think It Is without any prior announcement besides several teaser posts the day before. The album was co- produced by Bemis and Darren King of Mutemath, who also played drums and percussion, as well as Liam Ortmeier, who briefly appeared in previous works on guitar. The record was mixed by Will Yip and featured contributions by members of The Hotelier, Tiny Moving Parts, Eisley, Japanese Breakfast and others. In 2017 it was announced drummer Reed Murray would be leaving the band. He was then replaced by Remington DuPree of Eisley for the band's In Defense of the Genre tenth anniversary tour. The band announced their signing to Dine Alone Records at South by Southwest 2018 and revealed the existence of a forthcoming LP produced by Will Yip. Oliver Appropriate and hiatus (2018) On August 16, 2018, Bemis released a nine-page letter to fans detailing the band's forthcoming record, his future plans for Say Anything, and struggles with his own sexuality and drug use. Say Anything's final LP for the time being, Oliver Appropriate, was released on January 25, 2019, via Dine Alone Records. The album is a purported sequel to ...Is a Real Boy, featuring an adult version of the narrator fictionalized on that record who struggles with his own sexuality, leading to a violent conclusion. Bemis stated his intention to \\"sort of, kind of end\\" the band, but that the project would also likely return in the future to record and perform again. As for now, Bemis is finished with \\"the traditional music thing\\" and there will be no tour in support of the new album, nor any scheduled live performances in the near future. However, he went on a solo tour in 2019 where he played acoustic versions of Say Anything and Perma songs. During the tour, he confirmed that Say Anything would eventually return. Style Themes and influences Say Anything's music falls into the indie rock, emo and post-punk genres. They can most easily be identified by their sardonic, literary sense of humor balanced out with a sense of intense catharsis. The band, as well as certain artists within the indie/punk scene such as Cursive, MewithoutYou, Brand New, Bright Eyes and Manchester Orchestra tend to straddle the line between older fans and a youth oriented audience. Their style incorporates pieces of hardcore, bombastic arena rock and post-punk. Bemis, the primary songwriter of Say Anything, stated, \\"I believe that an artist should let his art be appreciated by anyone who's interested and not 'play favourites'.\\" He also said that lyrics are \\"based on experience.\\" However, due to Bemis' bipolar disorder and his resulting mentality, the themes of the songs are often surreal, bleak, irreverent, personal, and autobiographical. Other themes include distaste with snobbery and hypocrisy. Drugs and mankind's relationship with drugs are also a popular subject in Say Anything's songs, especially on In Defense of the Genre, which was written and recorded after Bemis' several drug-fueled breakdowns. Specifically, \\"Admit It!!!\\", \\"Yellow Cat (Slash) Red Cat\\", \\"Try To Remember, Forget\\", \\"The Writhing South\\", and \\"Sorry, Dudes, My Bad\\" include references to Bemis' drug usage. In general, Say Anything tends to draw inspiration from alienation from a flawed society but confers a sense of hope. Max Bemis was raised \\"in a strong Jewish environment.\\" Many of Bemis' lyrics borrow from his Jewish roots, and contain elements of Jewish humor. While most of band's earlier songs are free of any such inspiration, the songs of ...Is a Real Boy and In Defense of the Genre include references to Jewish heritage. \\"Alive with the Glory of Love,\\" Say Anything's first single, has a main subject of a relationship affected by World War II and the Holocaust, based on Bemis's grandparents, while \\"Wow, I Can Get Sexual Too\\" includes mentions of \\"the old shul\\" and a rabbi's teachings. A strong example from In Defense comes from the lyrics of \\"Died a Jew\\". The song includes several references to the Jewish people and its history along with mentions of \\"the murder of God\\" and Bemis' departures from kosher. References to religion come again in \\"Fed to Death\\" on Say Anything, referring to a 'man from Nazareth' who would one day 'spring to life to smile and clear your name' but until then 'nail yourself upon the cross and hang your head in shame.' In regards to writing songs for ...Is a Real Boy, Bemis stated, \\"The songs were jam packed with fairly blatant nods to bands I dig (Queen, Saves the Day, Pavement, Faith No More, Fugazi, etc).\\" These can be considered some of Say Anything's influences. Other influences at some point cited by the band include Botch, Weezer, The Stooges, Neutral Milk Hotel, Sunny Day Real Estate, Wilco, and the Foo Fighters. Also of note, the band has covered songs by Ol' Dirty Bastard (\\"Got Your Money\\"), Notorious B.I.G. (\\"No Soul\\" contains the same hook as the sample in \\"Juicy\\" although it adheres more closely to the original song \\"Juicy Fruit\\" from which the sample for the Notorious B.I.G. song was taken), The Four Tops (\\"Sure, Baby...Hold Back\\" features a chorus lifted from \\"Sugar Pie Honey Bunch\\"), Safety in Numbers (\\"Dealer\\"), Saves the Day (\\"Jessie and My Whetstone\\"), and Bob Dylan (\\"The Man in Me\\"). Max Bemis expounded upon the story of In Defense of the Genre as well as the differences between that album and ...Is a Real Boy in an interview with AbsolutePunk.net on June 19, 2007. Live shows During live shows, some members of the group (other than Bemis) sing backing vocals. Bemis often sings parts he wrote, but which were sung by guest vocalists on studio recordings. In recent years, Bemis has switched up the lineup of performing musicians, using some permanent members of the groups, while rotating other musicians in and out of the live lineup. Beginning on the \\"All My Friends Are Enemies ‚Äì Rarities Tour,\\" Bemis added drummer Reed Murray, and bassist Garron DuPree. In summer of 2014 on the Hebrews tour, Bemis recruited ex-Taking Back Sunday member Fred Mascherino, Moneen guitarist Kenny Bridges, and Moving Mountains vocalist Greg Dunn to replace Jake and Jeff Turner and Parker Case, who were at the time performing with their band XO. In the midst of the \\"Me Too\\" movement and accusations of sexual harassment against numerous prominent musicians, Bemis announced that the band would no longer perform \\"Wow, I Can Get Sexual Too\\" during live shows in 2017. His Twitter post stated that the song portrayed a \\"sarcastic caricature of someone I‚Äôve never been at all and is no longer appropriate during this crisis.\\" On September 8th, 2020, frontman Max Bemis performed an online acoustic performance of the bands debut album, \\"...Is a Real Boy\\" in its entirety on an online livestream. During the livestream, Bemis stated that if the turnout for the livestream went well, the remaining Say Anything albums may also be performed online by livestream. Remixes Georgia emcee Kyle Lucas remixed \\"Wow, I Can Get Sexual Too\\" on his mixtape, Kyle Lucas Is Still My Favorite.

(band)"},{"id":"8064024","text":"Rev Prof Alexander Murray FRSE FSA (Scot) DD (1775 ‚Äì 15 April 1813) was a Scottish minister, philologist, linguist and professor of Hebrew and Semitic languages at Edinburgh University (1812). Alexander Murray The grave of Prof Alexander Murray, Greyfriars Kirkyard, Edinburgh Memorial at Alexander Murray's birthplace erected in 1975 Life Murray was born on 22 October 1775, at Dunkitterick, Kirkcudbrightshire, where his father, Robert Murray, was a shepherd and farm labourer. His first language was Galwegian Gaelic.https://lowlandgaelic.blogspot.com/2017/11/ Up until 1792, he had had little more than a year at school, but was self-taught in languages, and had worked as a tutor as well as a shepherd. He translated Arnold Drackenburg's German lectures on Roman authors, and when he visited Dumfries with his version in 1794, after unsuccessfully offering it to two separate publishers, he met Robert Burns, who gave him advice. The father of Robert Heron lent Murray books, and James M'Harg, a literary pedlar from Edinburgh, proposed that Murray should visit the university authorities. His parish minister, J. G. Maitland of Minnigaff, gave him an introductory letter to Principal George Husband Baird, which led to an examination. Admitted to Edinburgh University as a deserving student, Murray won his way in class and by private teaching. Completing the course, he became a licentiate of the church of Scotland. Murray early formed the acquaintance of John Leyden, and among his friends were Robert Anderson, Henry Brougham, Francis Jeffrey, Thomas Brown, and Thomas Campbell. In 1806, Murray was appointed assistant to James Murehead parish minister of Urr, Kirkcudbrightshire, whom he succeeded on his death in 1808. In 1811 Murray translated, with approbation, a letter for George III, brought home by Henry Salt the Abyssinian envoy. It was from the Tigray Region, where Tigrinya is spoken. On 13 August 1811, Murray wrote to the publisher Archibald Constable that he had mastered the Lappish tongue. In July 1812, after a sharp contest involving some bitterness of feeling, Murray was appointed professor of oriental languages in Edinburgh University, with support from Salt and Constable. He received from the university on 17 July the degree of doctor of divinity. Murray entered on his work at the end of October 1812, publishing Outlines of Oriental Philology (1812), for the use of his students. He lectured through the winter, against his strength, attracting both students and literary men to his room. His health completely gave way in the spring, and he died of consumption in Edinburgh, 15 April 1813. He is buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard in Edinburgh, immediately north of the church. Murray's Monument, an eighty-foot stone obelisk to his memory, was erected near his birthplace in 1835, and it received an inscription in 1877. It is north of the A712 road between Newton Stewart and New Galloway, in the Galloway Forest Park. Artistic recognition His portrait by Andrew Geddes, formerly in the possession of Archibald Constable, went to the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, Edinburgh. Works Through Leyden, Murray became a contributor to the Scots Magazine, and he edited the seven numbers of that periodical from February 1802, inserting verses of his own under the signatures \\"B\\",' \\"X\\", or \\"Z\\". For three successive numbers he wrote a biography of James Bruce traveller, which he later expanded into a volume (1808). Constable the publisher then engaged him in September 1802 to prepare a new edition of Bruce's Travels. At the same period (1802-5) Murray worked for the Edinburgh Review Murray's early promise then faded, but he was an influential editor and biographer. His major work, the History of the European Languages, or Researches into the Affinities of the Teutonic, Greek, Celtic, Slavonic, and Indian Nations, was edited by David Scot, and published, with a detailed Life, by Sir Henry Wellwood Moncreiff, in 2 vols., 1823. To the Edinburgh Review of 1803 Murray contributed a review of Charles Vallancey's Prospectus of an Irish Dictionary; to the number for January 1804 he furnished an article on James Stanier Clarke's Progress of Maritime Discovery; and in January 1805 he discussed Thomas Maurice's History of Hindostan. His Letters to Charles Stuart, M.D., appeared in 1813. He figures as a lyrist on his \\"Native Vale\\" in Malcolm McLachlan Harper's Bards of Galloway. Family Murray married, 9 December 1808, Henrietta Affleck, daughter of a parishioner. At his death he left her a widow, with a son and daughter.; she survived about twelve years, supported by a government pension of ¬£80, which had been granted to her in return for Murray's translation of the Abyssinian letter. The daughter died of consumption in 1821, and the son, who was practically adopted by Archibald Constable, qualified for a ship surgeon, and was drowned on his first voyage.

He published many works and eventually retired to his native Baza. Map of the coasts of the kingdom of Granada by Piri Reis (16th century). His works dealt with Algebra and contained the precise mathematical answers to problems in everyday life, such as the composition of medicaments, the calculation of the drop of irrigation canals and the explanation of frauds linked to instruments of measurement. The second part belongs to the already ancient tradition of judicial and cultural mathematics and joins a collection of little arithmetical problems presented in the form of poetical riddles In 1480 the Christian forces of Ferdinand and Isabella, \\"The Catholic Monarchs\\", raided and often pillaged the city, al-QalasƒÅdƒ´ himself served in the mountain citadels which were erected in the vicinity of Baza. al-QalasƒÅdƒ´ eventually left his homeland and took refuge with his family in B√©ja, Tunisia, where he died in 1486. Baza was eventually besieged by the forces of Ferdinand and Isabella and its inhabitants sacked. Symbolic algebra Like his predecessors, al-Qala·π£ƒÅdƒ´ used an algebraic notation. While the 19th century writer Franz Woepcke believed that this algebraic symbolism was created by al- Qala·π£ƒÅdƒ´ himself, these symbols had actually been used by other mathematicians in North Africa 100 years earlier. Al-Qala·π£ƒÅdƒ´ represented mathematical symbols using characters from the Arabic alphabet, where: *Ôª≠ (wa) means \\"and\\" for addition (+) *Ôªª (illa) means \\"less\\" for subtraction (-) *ŸÅ (fi) means \\"times\\" for multiplication (*) *ÿπ (ala) means \\"over\\" for division (/) *Ô∫ù (j) represents jadah meaning \\"root\\" *Ô∫µ (sh) represents shay meaning \\"thing\\" for a variable (x) *Ôª° (m) represents moraba'a for a square (x2) *Ôªô (k) represents moka'ab for a cube (x3) *Ôªù (l) represents ya'adilu for equality (=) As an example, the equation 2x^3 + 3x^2 - 4x + 5 = 0 would have been written using his notation as: 2Ôªô Ôª≠ 3Ôª° Ôªª 4Ô∫µ Ôª≠ 5 Ôªù 0 See also *Islamic mathematics *List of Muslim scientists Notes References  External links * Category:1412 births Category:1486 deaths Category:15th-century Arabs Category:People from the Province of Granada Category:Mathematicians of medieval Islam Category:Medieval Tunisian mathematicians Category:Medieval Moorish mathematicians Category:Medieval Arab mathematicians Category:15th- century mathematicians Category:15th-century Muslims Category:Jurisprudence academics Category:Mathematicians who worked on Islamic inheritance Category:Scholars of the Nasrid period ","title":"Ab≈´ al-·∏§asan ibn  øAlƒ´ al-Qala·π£ƒÅdƒ´"},{"id":"8064050","text":"Adelaide Terrace is a major arterial road through the central business district of Perth, Western Australia.

He wrote the , known in English as The Life of Saint Patrick, one of the first accounts of the fifth-century saint, and which credits Patrick with the conversion of Ireland in advance of the spread of monasticism. This work was dedicated to Bishop Aedh of Sl√©bte, who was also the one who suggested the biography be written, and was the patron for the work.Ludwig Bieler, ed.,The Patrician Texts in the Book of Armagh, (Dublin: Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies 1979), p. 1. Muirch√∫'s work is of little historical value in relation to the distant fifth century, but is a useful source for the time in which he lived and how Patrick was viewed in the seventh century.John R. Walsh and Thomas Bradley, A History of the Irish Church 400‚Äì700 A.D, (Blackrock, Co. Dublin: The Columba Press, 1991), 41. Life Muirch√∫ was possibly a member of the Tuath Mochtaine clan, who resided on Mag Macha, the Armagh plain. Ludwig Bieler believes this can be seen through Muirch√∫'s recorded last name, Machtheni. Muirch√∫, along with Bishop Aedh, is recorded to have been among the ecclesiastics who attended the Synod of Birr in 697 A.D. Their attendance at the Synod suggests that the two were concerned with the unification of the two churches in Ireland, the southern and northern churches, Romani and the Hibernenses, who had various differing customs and some opposing ideas on religious matters. The Vita sancti Patricii Muirch√∫'s Vita sancti Patricii only survives in four copies, none of which are complete versions, and some of which are only fragments.Walsh and Bradley, A History of the Irish Church 400‚Äì700 A.D, 38‚Äì39. There are three partial versions of the Vita that survive in Europe and one in Ireland. The incomplete copy in Library at Novara (Cap 77) was copied sometime in the thirteenth century, another incomplete copy at Biblioth√®que Royal in Brussels (Reg.64) appears to have been copied in the 11th century, and the two fragments at the Nationalbibliothek (Ser. Nov 3642) in Vienna are recorded in insular Anglo-Saxon script dating to the later eighth century.Bieler, The Patrician Texts in the Book of Armagh, 3‚Äì4. The version that survived in Ireland was contained within a manuscript called The Book of Armagh (Dublin, Trinity College, Ms.52), which contains most important later traditions about Patrick and dates from the second half of the seventh century.R.P.C Hanson, Saint Patrick: His Origins and Career, (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1968), 75. The biography about Saint Patrick written by Muirch√∫ is just one of many documents relating to Saint Patrick contained within this book. The manuscript was copied in the year 807, shortly after the Vita Patricii was written, and is likely the most authentic version. However, due to the incompleteness of all four surviving copies, scholars have found it difficult to piece together a comprehensible version of the Vita.Alf McCreary, Saint Patrick‚Äôs City: The Story of Armagh. (Belfast: The Blackstaff Press, 2001), 22. We can summarise from what is written in Muirchu's prologue to the Vita that it was the Bishop of Sletty, Aedh, who encouraged Muirch√∫ to write, eventually commissioning and sponsoring the writing of the manuscript.Hanson, Saint Patrick: His Origins and Career, 78. Muirch√∫ also informs his readers in the prologue that nobody else had attempted to write a ‚Äúlife of Patrick‚Äù except for his father Cogitosus. The term used is that Cogitosus was his ‚Äúfather,‚Äù but it is generally agreed upon by scholars that this was a figurative term, meaning spiritual father or spiritual companion. Muirch√∫ is most certainly referring to the same Cogitosus who wrote a hagiographical Life of St. Bridget in the earlier seventh century. If Muirch√∫ is to be believed, this would make him one of the earliest Irish hagiographers of any saint, second to Cogitosus. Muirch√∫'s written sources for his writings included Patrick's own Confessio and Epistle.Walsh and Bradley, A History of the Irish Church 400‚Äì700 A.D, 10. The first part of the Vita is certainly based on the Confessio, and on a narrative of Saint Patrick's stay in Gaul.Kathleen Hughes, Early Christian Ireland, (London: Sources of History Ltd, Hodder and Stoughton, 1972), 230. Following the pre-Christian tradition of oral teachings and storytelling, Muirch√∫ likely got information from some oral traditions as well. Muirch√∫ was aware that his sources might not always be reliable, as he was writing fairly long after Patrick's death, but made an attempt to tell the story of Patrick's life as best he could with the available sources.McCreary, Saint Patrick‚Äôs City: The Story of Armagh, 23. The Vita is a hagiography, written to tell the life story of a Saint, but also including events that may have simply been added to make the Saint seem more impressive.Joseph Falaky Nagy, Conversing With Angels and Ancients: Literary Myths of Medieval Ireland, (Icatha, N.Y: Cornell University Press, 1997), 40. Muirch√∫ writes in a more fluent style than Patrick had in his works, which were notably written is what was considered bad Latin, but not as polished as Cogitosus‚Äô Latin. This is not to say with certainty that Muirch√∫ was less educated, because there is a slight possibility that the Book of Armagh did not reproduce the Vita Patricii properly.David Howlett, The Celtic Latin Tradition of Biblical Style, (Blackrock, Co. Dublin: Four Courts Press, 1995), 251. Latin was almost always the second language of Irish monks unless they came from outside Ireland, so the discrepancies between the three authors could also be contributed to this.Michael Staunton, Voice of the Irish: The Story of Christian Ireland,(New Jersey: HiddenSpring, 2003), 60. Muirch√∫ is also seen to quote books other than the bible, including classical authors such as Virgil and Sedulius, again alluding to the fact that he was clearly very well educated by monastic standards.Walsh and Bradley, History of the Irish Church 400‚Äì700 A.D, 39. The Vita sancti Patricii as a work of literature Many scholars argue that the Vita sancti Patricii should be seen as a piece of literature, usually falling into the category of hagiography. This is often attributed to the contrast between Patrick's own writings and Muirch√∫'s, because there are parts that vary to a fair degree.Staunton, Voice of the Irish: The Story of Christian Ireland, 38. The beginning of the Vita generally follows along the same lines as Patrick's accounts of his life, but after the scenes where Patrick escapes from Ireland and returns to Britain, it takes a different turn.Liam De Paor, Saint Patrick‚Äôs World: The Christian Culture of Ireland‚Äôs Apostolic Age, (Dublin: Four Courts Press, 1993), 39. Muirch√∫ added on to Patrick's outline of his life, stating that the Saint, after he left Britain for the second time, intended to travel to Rome but instead stayed with Germanus in Auxerre for many years, and it was in Auxerre that he heard of the mission to convert Ireland and decided to return. The lack of evidence in Patrick's writings for certain events that take place in the Vita indicates Muirch√∫'s was enhancing Patrick's life and adding new events to make Patrick's tale seem more impressive. Similar to a piece of literature, the Vita Patricii contains two climaxes, suggesting that Muirch√∫ added these for dramatic effect.Ludwig Bieler, ‚ÄúMuirch√∫'s Life of St. Patrick as a Work of Literature,‚Äù Medium Aevum 43 (1974): 221, accessed 15 October, https://www.jstor.org/stable/43628033. Muirch√∫ also uses an interesting stylistic device in which he places the current event he is discussing in between two biblical quotes.Thomas O‚ÄôLoughlin, ‚ÄúMuirchu‚Äôs Poison Cup: A Note on its Sources,‚Äù √âriu 56 (2006): 158, accessed 15 October, https://www.jstor.org/stable/30007055. This is to mark the beginning and end of passages within the Vita. The frequent appearance of miracles in the Vita also attests to its classification as a piece of literature, in the form of hagiography. There are several incidents in which Patrick is seen to have a miraculous or divine nature. One particular episode in which Saint Patrick drinks from a poisoned cup but is unharmed, shows him to be almost supernatural and above death. The inspiration for this type of event is Biblical, from the end of Mark's gospel, and demonstrates Muirch√∫'s in-depth knowledge of the biblical stories.O‚ÄôLoughlin, ‚ÄúMuirchu‚Äôs Poison Cup: A Note on its Sources,‚Äù 158. Patrick is also seen as being able to raise the dead in the Vita, which gives him a miraculous, Christ-like quality.Falaky Nagy, Conversing With Angels and Ancients, 111. In these events Patrick is portrayed as a kind of medieval superhero and saint who could perform miracles and challenge evil forces. Patrick's dedication to converting pagan Ireland is seen through many events in the Vita, and this dedication was no doubt shared by all monastics, Muirch√∫ included. Muirch√∫'s desires for a solely Christian Ireland are compatible with Patrick's and appear to be integrated into his portrayal of the character of Patrick. Muirch√∫ and the Vita sancti Patricii as an aid in establishing Armagh as the head of the church Muirch√∫ has also been credited, along with others, most notably Tirechan, with helping to establish Armagh as the head seat of the church through his writings in his Vita Patricii. Armagh held a powerful position in the Irish church from the early Middle Ages onward.Staunton, Voice of the Irish: The Story of Christian Ireland, 36. There are no sources earlier than Muirch√∫ and Tirechan's works that suggest Patrick had a special connection with Armagh.Nicholas Boyter Aitchison, Armagh and the Royal Centres in Early Medieval Ireland: Monuments, Cosmology, and the Past, (Rochester, N.Y: Published for Cruithne Press by Boydell and Brewer, 1994), 201. This goal of making Armagh head of the church is evident throughout the entire Vita, where numerous references are made to Armagh. Most scholars agree that this was an attempt to compete with Cogitosus and his attempts to establish Kildare as head of the church. Cogitosus had written a Life of Saint Bridget, much in the same style as Muirch√∫'s Vita and the hagiographies were used to contest supremacy for their separate churches. According to Muirch√∫, Patrick founded his main church at Armagh, and stated in his work that Armagh was beloved by Patrick.McCreary, Saint Patrick‚Äôs City: The Story of Armagh, 23‚Äì25. In the Vita, Muirch√∫ writes that Patrick intended to die in Armagh, and though an angel convinced him not to specifically go there, the angel stated that Patrick's ‚Äòpre-eminence‚Äô would be at Armagh.David E. Thornton, ‚ÄúMuirch√∫ (fl. 697),‚Äù Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, (Oxford University Press, 2004), http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/19503, accessed 21 October 2013. Monastics were eager to crush any connections to pre-Christian pagan religions, and Armagh was home to various important pre- Christian sites. Foremost, Armagh was located close to the important pre- Christian site, Emain Macha (The Twins of Macha), a place steeped in mythological lore and associated with the goddess, or figure of Macha. By establishing Armagh as head of the church, it was an attempt to replace and reclaim the land from this, and any other pagan associations.Falaky Nagy, Conversing With Angels and Ancients, 115‚Äì116. Hughes‚Äô Early Christian Ireland notes that Patrick set up his church in Ulster, a province that still must have spread over much of Northern Ireland, and contained Armagh.Hughes, Early Christian Ireland, 230. Bishop Aedh, the patron of the Vita, was originally from the Irish midlands but had moved to Armagh.McCreary, Saint Patrick‚Äôs City: The Story of Armagh, 25. Bishop Aedh had then merged his church with the Paruchia Patricii (the confederation of Patrician churches) in Armagh anytime from 661‚Äì668. Aedh as patron of the Vita must have had some say in what underlying messages were written into the Vita, and Muirch√∫'s companionship with Aedh could have led him to want to help establish Armagh as an important center. Hughes also believes that Muirch√∫ presents Patrick not only as the founder of a church in Ulster but as a missionary, who was accepted by the Ui N√©ill, the dominant power in Northern Ireland in Muirch√∫'s time.Hughes, Early Christian Ireland, 231. That being said, in the Vita, Muirch√∫ confines Patrick's activities to the north-east of Ireland, and more specifically, in the second part of the Vita, his activities are mainly confined to the province of Ulster.Hanson, St Patrick: His Origins and Career, 88. Using the Vita sancti Patricii to encourage conversion Another popular belief among scholars is that Muirch√∫ wrote the Vita Patricii to encourage conversion. O‚ÄôLoughlin argues that it is clear that Muirch√∫ was not only aware of what steps needed to be taken to convince people to convert, but had a deep theological understanding of it and the processes it would take.Thomas O‚ÄôLoughlin, ‚ÄúMuirchu‚Äôs Theology of Conversion in His Vita Patricii,‚Äù in Celts and Christians: New Approaches to the Religious Traditions of Britain and Ireland, edited by Mark Atherton, (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 2002), 126. Hughes also mentions that Muirch√∫'s writings clearly indicate that the Ui N√©ill, the dominant political power at that time, owed their conversion to Christianity to Patrick. O‚ÄôLoughlin suggests that the aim of Muirch√∫ in the Vita was to send a message to his audience; that they had seen the truth of Christianity through Patrick's efforts and that they could still rely on him in his saint form as they had when he lived.O‚ÄôLoughlin, ‚ÄúMuirchu‚Äôs Theology of Conversion in His Vita Patricii,‚Äù 127. By having their own saint, in the sense that Patrick's actions were centred in Ireland, the Irish Christians would have had a lasting figure to rely on as an intermediary to God. By portraying that Patrick had convinced the Ui N√©ill to become Christians, other Irish people may have been inspired to follow suit if the powerful family's path, possibly to gain more powerful positions and favours that may not have been granted to those who were not Christian. Lasting effects of Muirch√∫‚Äôs work Use of the Vita sancti Patricii for all three previously stated reasons is generally agreed on by scholars. Muirch√∫ was an initiator of Irish hagiography, and the Vita provides one of the earliest examples of hagiography in Ireland, a model for a tradition that would endure for many centuries to come. Though very little is known about Muirch√∫'s life, his education background and his desire to help spread Christianity throughout Ireland and encourage conversions can be see through the Vita Patricii. Moreover, through examining Muirch√∫'s text it is possible to see an example of what opinions an early Irish Christian had and how he might have imagined his own religious history.O‚ÄôLoughlin, ‚ÄúMuirchu‚Äôs Theology of Conversion in His Vita Patricii,‚Äù 137. Like the figure of Saint Patrick that Muirch√∫ wrote about, Muirch√∫ was also eager to help with the conversion process, and his desires are reflected in the Vita sancti Patricii through his historic and literary figure.

The restaurant's roots are in the Societ√† Cooperativa Italiana Zurigo, founded by Italian immigrants in 1905 for \\"furthering Socialist cooperation\\". Apart from a library, the society also founded the Ristorante Cooperativo to allow immigrants to eat at affordable prices, and continues to operate it today. During World War II, the Cooperativo became a nexus of Socialist resistance against European Fascism, as many exiled Italian socialists fled to Switzerland. Among them was Filippo Turati, the founder of the Italian Socialist Party, whose bust still graces the restaurant. The Coopi was also where the Avanti! and L'Avvenire dei Lavoratori were being edited during the war years. These newspapers, the only Italian-language media in opposition to the Fascist regime at the time, were regularly being smuggled from Z√ºrich to Italy in double-bottomed suitcases. In the post-war years, the restaurant became a meeting-point of the Z√ºrich left- wing intelligentsia, particularly during the student movement's heyday in the late 1960s. The later Federal Councillor Moritz Leuenberger was among the Coopi's regular guests as a student. Led by the later National Councillor Ezio Canonica, the Coopi was also the base of the opponents of James Schwarzenbach's anti-immigration initiatives of the 1960s. In its time, the Coopi has seen many internationally famous patrons. While still a member of the Italian Socialist Party, the later Italian Fascist leader Benito Mussolini ate at the Coopi in 1913 after speaking at the May Day festivities in Z√ºrich. Vladimir Lenin is reported to have eaten his last meal in Switzerland at the Coopi before covertly traveling to Russia in 1917, and the German communist writer Bertolt Brecht also patronised the restaurant during his stay in Switzerland. Brecht is said to have asked why the restaurant had a portrait of Karl Marx but lacked those of Soviet leaders Lenin and Joseph Stalin, and was told that the Coopi was \\"not a place for dictators, not even on the walls\\". More recently, Gerhard Schr√∂der, then still Chancellor of Germany, ate at the restaurant after opening a Schang Hutter vernissage in 2004. Originally located at the Zwinglistrasse, the restaurant moved to the Milit√§rstrasse 36 in 1912 and to the Strassburgstrasse 5, in 1970 (). In 2006, the media reported that the Coopi may have to close its doors in 2007 because the city government intends to increase the rent for the restaurant building which it owns. According to the Societ√† Cooperativa, replacing the 1970s flexible rent arrangement with a current market level rent would ruin the restaurant. In 2008, it moved to St. Jakobstrasse 6 ().

Along with his brothers Joseph and Hyman Amberg, they competed against Jacob \\"Gurrah\\" Shapiro, Louis \\"Lepke\\" Buchalter and the Shapiro Brothers for control of Brooklyn's racketeering activities during the 1920s and early 1930s. Early life Amberg was born in the Russian Empire into a Jewish family, the fifth of eight children born to Charles and Rose Amberg (n√©e Mindelwitz). The family immigrated to New York in 1904. In 1910, the father's occupation was listed as a peddler.1910 United States Census Louis Amberg was one of five brothers. In addition to Joseph and Hyman, his brother Oscar Amberg was tried but acquitted for murder and other crimes. William, who owned a furniture store, was the only brother apparently not in the crime business. Their mother had changed her name to Rose Mandell because the Amberg name became so notorious. Amberg had a tendency to stab a fork in people's faces if they annoyed him. He once stabbed Milton Berle in the face after Berle insulted him from the stage of the Vanity Fair Club. Murder Joseph Amberg was murdered on September 30, 1935. Less than a month later, Pretty Amberg's body was found on the back seat of a flaming car early in the morning of October 23, 1935 across from 131 North Elliot Place, Brooklyn. He had been stripped of his clothes, a sack placed over his head with his hands tied with wire. A witness who first spotted the flames saw several men running away from the scene. Amberg's body was claimed by an undertaker and he was buried without any ceremony. An individual named Al Stern or Stein, 21, was considered a suspect in the killing of both Amberg brothers and at least seven others since that August. The deaths of the Amberg brothers were part of a violent gangland murder spree. The day after Pretty Amberg's death, Dutch Schultz and five others were slaughtered in what the media initially speculated could be retaliation for the deaths of the Amberg brothers. For the 10 months prior to his death, Pretty Amberg had been staying in a hotel in midtown Manhattan under an assumed name. Police searched the room and discovered more than $1,000 cash (), jewelry (including a gold watch with initials not matching Amberg) and extensive records. The records, which appeared to include names, addresses and other data were written in some kind of code. Aftermath The case remains officially unsolved, though he was alleged to have been killed by Murder, Inc.

The band have been described as \\"punk visionaries\\". History The Rejects (1976‚Äì1977) The Rejects were formed in the bar of Goldsmith's College in South London in 1976, when ex- Sunderland art school students John Hazzard (real name: John Wilkins) and Glenn Hutchinson recruited Bruno Wizard (real name: Bruno McQuillan) to drum for their nascent band. He in turn introduced them to Howard H, a well known drummer, and as rehearsals got under way, Wizard took on the role of frontman and Hutchinson was sidelined. Wizard then recruited Ian Kane, who added more songs to Hazzard's original set of compositions, and to express his disquiet with the modern world and disappointment with his 1960s heroes. The Rejects played their first gig at punk club The Roxy in January 1977, without a bass player, supporting the Damned and the Vibrators. In the following five months, the Rejects played with Wire, Generation X, the Jam, Eater, 999 and Sham 69 on multiple occasions, with Wizard becoming increasingly confrontational (though no more tuneful) to their audiences. Performances routinely descended into violence, with dates at the Albany in Deptford and Barbarella's in Birmingham confirming the band as a bad risk for PA hire companies. In the summer of 1977, Hazzard was dropped from the band, going on to form the proto-thrash group Auto da Fe. Wizard recruited Jim Welton on bass for a new lineup of the Rejects, which included David Dus on drums and occasional itinerant guitarists, including Stevie Savage and Jerry Wigens. Dus was the drummer for Wayne County (later to become Jayne) during their 1977 tour of the UK. Wizard set up auditions to find a permanent guitarist, and Anton Hayman was recruited. The Homosexuals (1978‚Äì1985) For Wizard, the name \\"the Rejects\\" was too deeply embedded in what he regarded as \\"the new conformity of punk\\", leading to the name change to the Homosexuals. Dus could not take being in a band called the Homosexuals and duly left, although Welton and Hayman approved of the change and remained. The band then lived in a series of squats while making music and recording. Their angular guitars, complex melodies and experimental leanings distanced them somewhat from the punk rock being created by their contemporaries and cemented their reputation as a precursor to post- punk. The band's work during this period would lead to their later recognition as a pioneer of D.I.Y., along with such bands as This Heat, Desperate Bicycles and Swell Maps. They released few recordings during their initial lifetime, and most of what did appear was in small vinyl runs on self-funded labels. The bulk of the band's studio material was recorded at Surrey Sound during 1978‚Äì79 with producer Chris Gray; the 16-track studio was run by Gray and his brother Nigel (who produced albums by the Police and Siouxsie and the Banshees). Wizard refused to perform on \\"the circuit\\" and thus the Homosexuals only did a handful of gigs, and refused to do interviews. Despite this lack of visibility, their debut 7\\", Hearts in Exile, pressed in an edition of 2,000 copies, still managed to sell out in a few days. A self-titled EP followed. Welton left the band in 1980, forming Amos & Sara with Chris Gray; Wizard and Hayman continued recording as the Homosexuals, along with visual artist and sometime vocalist Susan Vida, releasing a cassette of material in 1982 before disbanding in 1985. The only full-length album by the band, The Homosexuals' Record (1984), was compiled by Recommended Records from existing studio masters and rough cassette mixes of the Surrey Sound recordings. The LP was reissued in 2004 as a remastered CD, with additional tracks, as The Homosexuals' CD. Also released that year was Astral Glamour, a 3-CD set including the band's entire catalogue, unreleased songs and work by several of the band's pseudonymous projects. Side projects The band members recorded in various combinations under several different pseudonyms. These side projects included Ici la Bas, Sir Alick & the Phraser, and George Harrasment, all released on Bruno's Black Noise label. Contrary to often cited information about Homosexuals side projects, L. Voag's The Way Out (1979) was a Jim Welton solo album recorded during downtime between recording sessions at Surrey Sound. All releases on the It's War Boys label, including Amos & Sara, Sara Goes Pop, Nancy Sesay & the Melodaires, Milk from Cheltenham, and the Just Measurers, were also Welton projects (many involving Homosexuals producer Chris Gray) after he had left the band. Reformation (2003 to present) Wizard reformed the Homosexuals in late 2003, playing with an assortment of young musicians from around the world. In 2004, this version of the band, along with former member Vida, launched Astral Glamour on Hyped2Death at Cobden's Art Club in Notting Hill Gate. This coincided with a major art exhibition of Vida's work at the same venue. Around this time, Wizard met Ben Harris, who was playing with the Affectionate Punch. After discussing their musical backgrounds and approaches, Harris was enlisted to play bass at their next gig, five days later, after which he became a permanent feature in the European lineup. After three shows with Hayman back on guitar, Wizard travelled to New York City (which he had been visiting since 1986) and worked with Imaginary Icons as his backing band. Wizard put together another lineup of the Homosexuals in late 2007, including bassist Mike Dos Santos (of Apache Beat, Brendan Benson and the Realistics), drummer Travis Harrison (the owner of label Serious Business Records), and guitarist Dave Siegel (a childhood friend of Harrison). Their fierce live performances, a combination of classic and new material paired with experimental explorations and free improvisational pieces, seemed to herald a new era for the band. In 2008, a fresh body of work was recorded at Serious Business' Soho studio, some of which was documented on the limited edition Love Guns? EP. A full album titled Important If True was suspended from release the following year while negotiations took place between Wizard and Harrison, but later released online. During the recording of this material, Harrison was being courted by digital distribution and licensing company The Orchard, for his label's catalogue. At the time, The Orchard already handled the digital distribution for The Homosexuals' CD and Astral Glamour, an agreement which ended 30 June 2009, and were keen to secure the rights to the material being worked on with Wizard and Serious Business. To this effect, Wizard performed some of the new material at The Orchard's office in Manhattan, and Harrison and Serious Business signed their current catalogue to The Orchard. Unfortunately, there was never any legal agreement between Wizard and Harrison for any of this material to be assigned anywhere. The matter has yet to be resolved. Given Wizard's inherent distrust and loathing of \\"the traditional music industry\\", the situation between him and Harrison meant that Harrison's drumming position in the band was untenable. His exit from the band was swiftly followed by that Siegel. Within three days, their replacements, Julian Bennett Holmes and Jonathan Edelstein of Brooklyn band Fiasco, were on the road to Boston as the Homosexuals to play alongside King Khan and the Shrines. This lineup also played at Club Europa in New York with Monotonix before Wizard's return to London to meet his UK and European playing and recording commitments. While in London, Wizard worked on new songs, some in collaboration with Hayman, his original co-writer with the Homosexuals. As of 2014, Bruno was still performing regularly as the Homosexuals, with the band including Harris, Tom Oakes, John Mathews and Charlie Sundown. Films about members of the Homosexuals First screened in 2003, The Way Out, a Portrait of Xentos Jones by Scottish artists Luke Fowler and Kosten Koper was an experimental film portrait of ex-Homosexuals bass player Jim Welton. The Heart Of Bruno Wizard (2013), directed by Elisabeth Rasmussen, was a feature-length documentary on the band's lead singer/songwriter and sole remaining original member.

Lieutenant General Edward Ligonier, 1st Earl Ligonier KB (1740 ‚Äì 14 June 1782) was a British soldier and courtier. He was the illegitimate son of Col. Francis Augustus Ligonier, the brother of John Ligonier, 1st Earl Ligonier. He served with Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick during the Seven Years' War, and was appointed a captain in the 1st Regiment of Foot Guards. In 1763, he was appointed a royal aide-de-camp, and from 1763 until 1765, he was secretary to the embassy at Madrid. On 12 November 1764, he was appointed a Groom of the Bedchamber to the Duke of Gloucester. On 6 December 1766, he married Penelope Pitt, daughter of George Pitt, 1st Baron Rivers. Her wanton intrigue with Vittorio Amadeo, Count Alfieri, provoked a duel between her husband and her lover in Green Park on 7 May 1771, and Ligonier was able to obtain a divorce by Act of Parliament on 7 November 1771. He married Lady Mary Henley, daughter of Robert Henley, 1st Earl of Northington, on 14 December 1773. In the meantime, upon the death of his uncle, the Earl Ligonier, in 1770, he became Viscount Ligonier of Clonmel, which title had been created with a special remainder to him and inherited Cobham Park. He was promoted major general in 1775 and lieutenant general in 1777. On 19 July 1776, he was created Earl Ligonier, of Clonmel, in the Peerage of Ireland. The last honour conferred upon him was his investiture as a Knight Companion of the Order of the Bath on 17 December 1781. He died on 14 June 1782, before he could be installed, and left no posterity. Cobham would be sold in 1806.

Along with Oued Abdi, it is one of the most important wadis in the Aur√®s massif. During the wet season, rain and melting snow flow into the valley to form the Abiod River. The valley begins at the foot of Djebel Ch√©lia, Algeria's highest mountain, and flows southwest towards Tolga, eventually dissipating into the Sahara desert nearby. Geography The vegetation in the highlands on the north end of Abiod Valley is typically Mediterranean with dense forests of oaks, pines and ancient cedars, sustained by the plentiful rainfall on the higher slopes. The southern part is mainly desert with very sparse vegetation, such as oak, juniper, cedar, clumps of thyme, and harmel. The valley has several minor oases. There are many human settlements along the walls of the Abiod Valley, including Ghoufi. The sandstone walls of the valley are soft and easily worked into shape, so many villages on the valley's walls include extensive stonework buildings.

The underlying principles go back to, among others, Mainframe and LDAP technologies; SOI provides a framework or mindset for making business benefits measurable.  Overview  A service-oriented infrastructure provides a foundation for IT services. A concept initially developed by Intel discussed three domains for service-orientation: # the enterprise # the application architecture # the infrastructure This article covers the infrastructure domain of service- orientation. Key aspects of service-oriented infrastructure include industrialisation and virtualisation, providing IT infrastructure services via a pool of resources (web servers, application servers, database servers, servers, storage instances) instead of through discrete instances. While the IT industry has widely adopted service-oriented architecture (SOA), service- oriented infrastructure or SOI has lagged in its adoption. This has changed with the availability of SOI solutions like application-server grids, database grids, Virtualised servers and virtualised storage. A joint effort between HP, Cisco and Capgemini has resulted in the following definition for a service- oriented infrastructure: * a virtualised IT infrastructure with components managed in an industrialised way and which: ** expose a catalog of services instead of discrete instances ** can comprise service-oriented architecture application support The term SOI also has a broader usage, which includes all configurable infrastructure resources such as compute, storage, and networking hardware and software to support the running of applications. Consistent with the objectives for SOA, SOI facilitates the reuse and dynamic allocation of necessary infrastructure resources. The development of SOI solutions focuses around the service characteristics envisaged. The service characteristics provide the basis both for the development as well as for the delivery of the services. The notion of a fully managed life cycle of the services envisages a continuum that contrasts with the event-based deployment of IT infrastructure that provided discrete silos of IT infrastructure for specific applications. center A SOI exposes a set of fundamental services such as mobility or security which form a part of the network environment that can deliver resource sharing, application integration, and communications and collaboration: ubiquitously, scalably, reliably, sustainably, maintainably and cost-effectively. In order to ensure each service provides a standard response to a standard invocation at all times, the service must include a control process. The control process measures both the demand and the supply of a capability and automatically updates the capability if required. In April 2007 The Open Group started a project on SOI within its SOA Working Group. This SOI project aims to develop more common understanding around SOI between the members of The Open Group. Orchestrating virtualised components Service orientation provides significant advantages for IT infrastructure services. The main benefits include increased utilisation of individual resources (meaning lower total cost of ownership) and increased service-levels as applications do not depend on the availability of any individual resource, but may use any one resource available in the pool. , available IT infrastructure technologies provide a full stack of options to deliver an end-to-end service- oriented service. Schedulers can virtualise each service within this domain, and a highly automated provisioning process can manage the required number of resources constituting a service, thus ensuring standard quality and consistent behaviour of the infrastructure services. This applies to servers, storage, networks, directory services, databases: in fact to every component of the IT infrastructure.

This highway is often used by motorists who travel between Jacksonville and areas accessible by US 431, such as Gadsden.

The scholarship was a proposal to parody and highlight what Mattera perceives as inequity and unfairness of racial preferences at his school and other educational institutions in America. While a parody, it was still executed. The winner, architecture major Tony Capriccio, was awarded a cash award. Mattera himself is of Puerto Rican descent and received a $5,000 scholarship open only to a minority group. Reasons Mattera argues that he supports private organizations such as the Hispanic College Fund, The United Negro College Fund, and other groups that are privately funded and ethnically-based that award scholarships to members of their own communities, a position he claims is fully in line with freedom of association. However, he is opposed to federally subsidized institutions creating two classes of persons by imposing different standards on them. Either such universities should compile race- based scholarships for all students, or they should award scholarships on the basis of merit alone, he writes. Roger Williams University chapter of the College Republicans (RWUCR) was condemned by Rhode Island's Republican Party and were no longer allowed to use a capital \\"R\\" in their name. The group still used the \\"R\\" in defiance. The student who won the scholarship donated the prize money to those affected by the 2003 Station Nightclub Fire. Similar scholarships KOPSES A similar scholarship was offered two months later at the University of Missouri by Colin Kerr, a sophomore. While Kerr consulted with Mattera before the release of the scholarship, he maintains it was an independent project planned months before the release of scholarship at Roger Williams. Under the auspices of a group called the Kerr-Otis Partnership for Socio-Economic Scholarships (KOPSES), Kerr echoed similar arguments to that of Mattera, though his scholarship eligibility requirement of 1/8 European- American descent mirrored that of the University of Missouri's criteria for minority status. Furthermore, before the announcement of the scholarship Kerr brokered a deal between both the leaders of the liberal and conservative campus publications to remain neutral in their coverage. The essay contest asked students to describe \\"how their European-American heritage affected their view of race-based scholarships.\\" An Asian-American student, whose essay detailed a history of discrimination by his Asian relatives for being partially Caucasian, was awarded the scholarship. Kerr's KOPSES organization eventually received wide multi-party support and later morphed into the American-Coalition for Socio-Economic Scholarships (ACSES), a short-lived national awareness group that lasted for over a year until its original funding ran short of its operating costs. CARS The trend in more sophisticated race-based scholarship protests continued when a white scholarship was offered at Boston University, known as the Caucasian Achievement and Recognition Scholarship. Similar to the KOPSES scholarship, the CARS scholarship required applicants to have at least 1/4 Caucasian heritage and although it required a photograph, did not specify that the photograph would be used as proof of race (since partially Caucasian applicants can apply).  Columbia  In 2013, a court affidavit filed by JPMorgan Chase revealed a graduate-student scholarship fund at Columbia University given only to persons of the Caucasian race. This scholarship, which was established in 1920, has been reportedly awarding aid for 77 years and was valued at $840,000. The university has temporarily stopped it, hence the JPMorgan Chase affidavit, requesting it to be struck down. According to school administrators, they willfully overlooked racial restrictions when awarding the scholarship but did not specify if the scholarship was ever given to a person of color. Recipients were also unaware of the race requirements. First scholarship 1994 The first Court Ordered White Only Scholarships was created at Historically Black Colleges in Alabama The Knight litigation commenced on January 15, 1981, when John F. Knight, Jr., and a class of other alumni, students, and faculty members of Alabama State University (ASU) filed suit in the Middle District of Alabama to attack alleged vestiges of segregation in public higher education. Knight v. Alabama, 900 F. Supp. 272, .280 (N.D. Ala. 1995) (\\"Knight II\\")[4].

UBC Library has the largest collection of Asian-language materials in North America and the largest biomedical collection in Western Canada. It is a depository library for publications of the governments of British Columbia (BC), Canada, Japan and the United Nations. The Library's collections of special and unique materials include the archives of Canadian author and artist Douglas Coupland, the Uno Langmann Family Collection of B.C. Photographs (consisting of more than 18,000 rare and unique early photographs of British Columbia), the H.

The collection includes documents, books, maps, posters, paintings, photographs, silver, glass, ceramic ware and other artifacts. In October 2015, UBC Library opened its newest facility, Library Preservation and Archives (PARC), a new modular storage facility designed to accommodate the future growth of library collections. The building is located at UBC Vancouver‚Äôs South Campus (in the Research Precinct) and provides 2,280 square metres of high-density collection storage. It can store about 1.6 million volumes and the facility also houses a campus-wide records management service. Major branches Asian Library UBC Asian Centre, building for the Asian Library and Asian Studies faculty and staff Since 1959, the Asian Library, located in the Asian Centre since 1981, houses the largest research collection in Asian languages in North America. Its holdings in Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Hindi, Tibetan, Persian, Punjabi, Sanskrit, Urdu and Indonesian exceed 663,000 volumes as of June 2016. Subject material about Asia in English and other European languages, as well as Asian materials in non-Asian languages, are kept in Koerner Library and other branches. Asia-related law materials are located in the Law Library. Monographs in Tamil, Malayalam, Bengali, Gujarati, Kannada, Marathi, Rajasthani, Assamese, Nepali and Tibetan are shelved in the Irving K. Barber Learning Centre. Special materials include the valuable Puban collection- which contains traditional Chinese works before 1912, the Swann collection, Song Xuepeng collection, Jing Yi Zhai, Japanese government publications, research materials on Chinese Canadian settlement in British Columbia and the Pearl Delta Area as well as Japanese Canadian studies collections. The Asian Library's rare book collection, mainly from the Puban collection, ranks first in North America. The Chinese collection ranked third in North America in number of volumes at the time of publication of Endymion Wilkinson's Chinese History: A Manual in 2000. Irving K. Barber Learning Centre/Main Library The Irving K. Barber Learning Centre, built around the Main Library UBC's Main Library underwent major renovations beginning in 2002. In phase one, the north wing was demolished and rebuilt. It now houses the bookstacks of the facility. Once the renovated north wing opened, the old south wing and \\"heritage core\\" of the Main Library was closed, with the south wing being demolished and the heritage core stripped to the original frame and exterior from 1925. The South Wing was officially opened to the public on February 25, 2008, with the heritage core opening in late March 2008. The building is now known as the Irving K. Barber Learning Centre, named in honour of donor Irving K. Barber. Notable features include the first Automated Storage and Retrieval System (ASRS) in Canada, referred to as the \\"library robot.\\" The system increases the amount of storage space available, but has been criticized for preventing browsing. The Irving K. Barber Learning Centre houses the Rare Books and Special Collections (RBSC) and University Archives divisions (level one) and the Music, Art and Architecture (levels three and four). The Chung Collection, a designated national treasure, is located in the RBSC space, and focuses on the Canadian Pacific Railway, the Asian experience in Canada, and West Coast history and exploration. The Learning Centre is also home to the Chapman Learning Commons on level three, located in the restored historic core of the old Main Library. Artwork on display around the Learning Centre includes pieces from noted artists such as John Nutter, Kevin DuBois and First Nations artist Brent Sparrow. The Institute for stained glass in Canada has documented the stained glass at the UBC Main Library.stained glass at the Main Library, University of British Columbia  The Commons (Okanagan)  Library Education Development Building at UBC's Okanagan campus.UBC Library also serves the University's Okanagan campus in Kelowna, British Columbia. In 2014/15, the Okanagan campus Library had 688,000 library visits., answering more than 17,000 in-person inquiries at their Library Service Desk. The Okanagan Library assumed responsibility for campus writing services in 2014, and launched a new Writing & Research Services unit. 2014 also marked the launch of UBC Okanagan‚Äôs special collections program, providing dedicated collections and space to further the Library‚Äôs service to the institution, community, and region by reflecting the unique history, literature and culture of the Okanagan Valley. In 2014, UBC Okanagan‚Äôs students voted in a referendum to contribute up to $10 million toward the expansion of the campus‚Äô Library and Learning Centre. The renovations will add 45,000 square feet of dynamic, technologically enhanced learning space, more than doubling the size of the existing library. In Fall 2015, the Innovation Library - a collaboration between the UBC Okanagan Library and the Okanagan Regional Library - opened to support the Okanagan campus' students, faculty, and staff, as well as community researchers in the Okanagan. The Innovation Library is located downtown in the Okanagan Regional Library's Kelowna Branch. In 2017, UBC Okanagan partnered with numerous local museums and archives throughout the Okanagan region to initiate the Digitized Okanagan History project. The project digitizes historical photographs and records related to the history of B.C.'s Southern Interior, and provides access to them online.  Walter C. Koerner Library  Koerner Library, designed by Arthur Erickson, was built in 1997, replacing Sedgewick Library. Koerner houses humanities and social sciences, government publications, journals and microforms, and numeric data files, the Map & Atlas Collection, and the UBC Research Commons. It is home to nearly 1.3 million items. Its postmodern architecture contrasts with the Gothic revival design of the original Main Library (now the Irving K. Barber Learning Centre) on the other side of Main Mall. Koerner is also home to the University's Interlibrary loan program.  Woodward Library  The Woodward Library‚Äôs collection covers a broad range of disciplines in support of learning and research in the Faculties of Applied Science, Dentistry, Forestry, Land & Food Systems, Medicine, Pharmaceutical Sciences and Science. The collection covers a range of subject areas, including agriculture, biology, botany, chemistry, computer science, dentistry, earth and ocean sciences, engineering, food science, forestry, mathematics, medicine, nursing, nutrition, pharmacy, physics, public health, statistics, wood science and zoology. Woodward Library has the largest biomedical collection in Western Canada and a strong history of medicine and science collection.  XÃ±wi7xÃ±wa Library  XÃ±wi7xÃ±wa (pronounced whei-wha) Library is one of the only Aboriginal branches of a university library in Canada.UBC Library Facts & Figures 2009/2010 Located adjacent to the First Nations Longhouse, it houses a collection of 12,000 items, including to 6,000 books and 450 videos relating to First Nations in British Columbia, and resources on Indigenous peoples from across Canada and internationally. The name comes from the Squamish Nation word meaning \\"echo.\\" The name was gifted by Chief Simon Baker of the Squamish Nation. Established in May 1993, the XÃ±wi7xÃ±wa Library became a branch of the UBC Library in 2005. The library is the result of a 1984 Stauffer Foundation Grant to the Native Indian Teacher Education Program (NITEP) that provided funds to build the collection. This collection was then gifted to the XÃ±wi7xÃ±wa Library when opening in 1993. The library also received a $1 million gift by William and June Bellman the same year. The classification used by the library reflects efforts to decolonize the current library classification systems. The library uses a British Columbia variant of the Xwi7xwa classification system, developed by Kahnawake librarian, Brian Deer, for the National Indian Brotherhood in the 1970s.

It was the second iteration of the second generation of this Australian made model. Its range included the luxury variants, Holden Berlina (VP) and Holden Calais (VP).  Overview  Interior The VP series was released in September 1991 with mainly cosmetic and feature changes to the outgoing VN Series Commodore. The 3.8 litre V6 and 5.0 litre V8 engines from the VN were carried over, but the V6 engine received various revisions that improved its refinement and noise characteristics as well as boosting power by two kilowatts. The 2.0 litre straight-4 engine which had been offered on the VN in certain export markets was discontinued. Semi- trailing arm IRS became standard on Calais and Commodore SS models and became an optional extra on lower-end models. This new suspension drastically improving ride and handling over that offered by the live rear axle. ABS brakes were also introduced in the VP range as an option on Series 1 Calais and Commodore SS models, and on most models with IRS for Series II versions. Additional security features were introduced across the range, including an ignition-disabling device and a driver's door deadlock. Power mirrors were also a standard feature across the model range. The VP series was replaced in July 1993 by the VR Series Commodore. The VP Calais was also sold in Thailand, with 3.8 V6 version, later it used an Opel 2.6-litre C26NE inline-six Dual Ram engine.  Models   Commodore Executive  The Commodore Executive was the base model of the range.  Commodore S  The Commodore S was the cheapest sports variant of the range. It was essentially similar to the Executive, but with sports trim similar to the SS model.  Commodore SS  The Commodore SS was the top of the line sports model of the range with a V8 engine.  Commodore Berlina  The Commodore Berlina was the cheapest luxury variant of the range.  Commodore Berlina LX  The Commodore Berlina LX was the semi-luxury version of the range. This model was essentially a stepping stone between the Berlina and Calais. The VP was the only version to offer this trim level.  Calais  The Calais was the luxury version of the range. It was however not badged or marketed as a Commodore.

It was produced to homologate a suitable model for the Group 3E Series Production Cars motor racing category, which required a small minimum run of cars to be built. The SS V6's main rival was the Ford EB2 Falcon XR6.  Commodore BT1  The Commodore BT1, or the Police Pack was a special pack for the VP Commodore that was available to the Australian and New Zealand Police Forces. It was based on the Commodore Executive and added various specification upgrades to cater to the needs of the Police Force. Many believe that BT1 Commodores had a \\"cop chip\\" which increased the engine power output, however this is a myth, as the engine power is the same as in regular VP Commodores. BT1 with IRS had a standard size fuel tank, not a long range tank as found on other models. Although the pack varied in each state, they were commonly fitted with: * FE2 sports suspension * Oil sump protector * Always-on top lighted speedo (inside the cluster in front of the speedo for \\"headlights off\\" speed checks when following speedsters) with 2 km increments (as per Berlina/Calais) * Dome light and map light interior lighting * 15 √ó 6-inch steel wheels * Transmission Cooler * Country pack suspension (V5W) in lieu of FE2 in some rural areas * Vinyl floor mats * Limited slip differential * Modified shift gate to allow gear change from overdrive to second gear without engaging lever. (Standard models only allow shift from overdrive to drive position).  Commodore Vacationer  The Commodore Vacationer was a limited edition model based on the Commodore Executive. The VP Commodore Vacationer was released in October 1992. File:1992 Holden Commodore (VP) Vacationer sedan (2009-07-15) 01.jpg VP Vacationer sedan File:1992 Holden Commodore (VP) Vacationer station wagon (20734497099).jpg VP Vacationer station wagon  Calais International  The Calais International was a limited edition model based on the VP Calais and released in September 1992. A total of 300 were built, 150 in Alaskan White and the same number in Anthracite Grey. All were equipped with the V8 engine and automatic transmission and the exterior featured Commodore SS lower kit (with fog lights) and a Holden VQ Caprice bootlip as well as unique International badges. The paint was single colour, unlike the standard Calais which had a grey lower half. Standard wheels were the 15in alloys from the VQ Statesman but with Holden logo's in the center cap and the interior was black over tan, with tan partial leather/suede seats, and special leather SS style steering wheel.

As in the case of the VN series, a V6 version was sold exclusively in New Zealand.  Maloo  The VP series Maloo utility was released in March 1992. Only 49 examples were made in the thirteen months of production, of which 15 were special HSV Fifth Anniversary Edition models, and the final eight were All-Black limited editions. These exclusive build quantities confirm the VP series to be the least production numbers Maloo ute of all.  Senator  The VP Senator 5000i was introduced in June 1992, effectively replacing the VP SV 91 as HSV most luxurious well appointed model, and is equivalent of the VN SV 5000 model.

Offering smoother styling compared to the HSV Clubsport and GTS models, which favoured performance rather than luxury, the Senator took advantage of the independent rear suspension which was offered on high-priced VP Commodores and Statesman/Caprices at the time and was only one of a handful of Commodore- based cars that had automatic climate control air conditioning. Other features included a leather interior, cruise control and limited slip differential. A three-spoke steering wheel was featured. Top speed was .

Really! is the third eroge visual novel in the Shuffle! series created by Navel for Microsoft Windows. It is a continuation of Kaede's path from the first Shuffle! visual novel, and has a linear plot. The limited edition was released on November 24, 2006 at a retail price of ¬•9,240 (about US$79.73). Navel released a \\"soft\\" version (without explicit sexual content, like Shuffle! On The Stage for Shuffle!) of Really? Really! on Nintendo DS in 2009. Really? Really! on Nintendo DS on Navel's website The DS version was released on June 25, 2009 by Kadokawa Shoten. It was localized by MangaGamer and released on June 6, 2014 (PC version only). Gameplay Rin Tsuchimi parodies the Ace Attorney series (also known as the Phoenix Wright series) during a 'Really!' sequence. More than just a passing homage, the 'Really!' system is actually a major aspect of Really? Really!. In Really? Really!, Kaede has lost her memories and throughout the game the player must fix them. Using keywords acquired from viewing various events in Kaede's memories, the player must fix mistakes in Kaede's past memories. The player starts at a \\"crossroad\\" where different doors are available. By going through the events beyond the doors and correcting memories with the keywords earned on the way, the player receives a \\"memory\\" which he can \\"liberate\\" by watching. Like stated at the picture, the game has a lot of similarities to Ace Attorney series. For example, the first mistake that occurs is that Kaede says that Midoriba Itsuki is a girl (he is actually a boy). By using the 'Really Attack', the player can select the 'Midoriba Itsuki' keyword, which causes Rin to say \\"OBJECTION!\\" which then causes the scene to shatter and replay correctly. The player is allowed five errors per day to get the memories corrected. In order to get the CG for the scene, the player must have a 100% completion. If the player makes five errors in a day, the game ends. The player should also note that once he makes 3 mistakes out of the 5 allowed, the game allows a hint where the \\"life bar\\" flashes, notifying that a certain keyword must be used at this dialog. However, it does not reveal what keyword should be used, so it is possible that the player may not possess the keyword. In this case, he must \\"escape\\" and choose another path to find the keyword. Should the player feel that he does not have the appropriate keyword for the situation, the player has the option of escaping the scene (and even that particular event/time entirely), and then coming back later upon acquiring more keywords. This is possible as the player usually has access to multiple events to play back and correct in the \\"event selection\\" area. Upon completion of all the events of a day, the player is able to play back these memories from Kaede's point of view, providing interesting insights into her inner thoughts. This is the only time when Rin's lines are voiced. Other characters may also comment from time to time during these sequences (for example, after a H-scene that did not actually take place or during the time when Kaede falsely accused Rin of killing her mother up to the point when she finally finds out the truth) or even alter them (Mayumi enlarging her breast size multiple times and getting caught, providing comic relief).

Collectively, the family contains nine genera and 78 species. The type genus is Paxillus, containing fungi with decurrent gills, and Gyrodon, which has members with decurrent pores, among others. French mycologist Ren√© Maire had erected the family in 1902, placing it between the agarics and boletes and recognizing the groups' similarities with the latter group. Maire's usage of the name was later deemed to be invalid, and the genus authority is attributed to Johannes Paulus Lotsy. Molecular research confirms the relations of Gyrodon, with the decurrent-pored mushroom G. lividus, Paragyrodon, with the type species P. sphaerosporus, and Paxillus as sister groups, together lying near the base of a phylogenetic tree from which the genus Boletus arises. The name Gyrodontaceae, published by Belgian botanist Paul Heinemann in 1951, is considered synonymous with Paxillaceae.

Although it has gills, it is a member of the pored mushroom order Boletales. August Batsch described the species in 1783. It has been recorded from Asia, Central America, Europe and North America. Tough and inedible, it grows on tree stumps of conifers. The mushroom contains several compounds that act as deterrents of feeding by insects. Taxonomy Tapinella atrotomentosa was originally described as Agaricus atrotomentosus by German naturalist August Batsch in his 1783 work Elenchus Fungorum, and given its current name by Josef ≈†utara in 1992. It is commonly known as the \\"velvet-footed pax\\", and the \\"velvet rollrim\\". Historical synonyms include Paxillus atrotomentosus by Elias Magnus Fries (1833), Rhymovis atrotomentosa by Gottlob Ludwig Rabenhorst (1844), and Sarcopaxillus atrotomentosus by Ivan Zmitrovich (2004). The variety bambusinus was described from Trinidad in 1951 by British mycologists Richard Eric Defoe Baker and William Thomas Dale. The species name is derived from the Latin words atrotomentosus, meaning \\"black-haired\\". It is still commonly seen under its old name Paxillus atrotomentosus in guidebooks. Tapinella atrotomentosa and its relative T. panuoides were placed in a separate genus Tapinella on account of their habit of growing on (and rotting) wood, and microscopic differences including much smaller spore size, lack of cystidia, and differing basidia. Their off-centre stipe also distinguished them from other members of the genus Paxillus, and genetic analysis confirmed them as only distantly related. Description The fruit body is squat mushroom with a cap up to across, sepia- or walnut brown in colour with a rolled rim and depressed centre. The stem is covered with dark brown or black velvety fur. The gills are cream-yellow and forked, while the thick stipe is dark brown and juts out sidewards from the mushroom. The flesh has been described as appetising in appearance, and is little affected by insects. The spore print is yellow and the spores are round to oval and measure 5-6 Œºm long. Distribution and habitat It is a saprobic fungus found growing on tree stumps of conifers in North America, Europe, Central America (Costa Rica), east into Asia where it has been recorded from Pakistan and China. The fruit bodies appear in summer and autumn, even in drier spells when other mushrooms are not evident. Edibility Although Tapinella atrotomentosa mushrooms are not generally considered edible, they have been used as a food source in parts of eastern Europe. Tests on the chemical composition and free amino acid levels of the mushroom suggest that they are not considerably different from other edible gilled mushrooms such as Armillaria mellea. Linus Zeitlmayr reports that young mushrooms are edible, but warns than older ones have a foul bitter or inky flavour and are possibly poisonous. The bitter flavour is allegedly improved by boiling the mushrooms and discarding the water, but is indigestible to many. There have been cases of poisoning reported in European literature. Chemistry Tapinella atrotomentosa has a wound-activated defence mechanism whereby injured fruit bodies convert chemicals known as leucomentins into atromentin, butenolide, and the feeding deterrent osmundalactone. Atromentin had previously been identified as the pigment producing the brown colour of the cap, but was not characterized as a chemical defence compound until 1989. Other compounds produced by the fungus include the orange-yellow flavomentins and violet spiromentin pigments. A novel dimeric lactone, bis-osumundalactone, was isolated from the variety bambusinus. Several phytoecdysteroids (compounds related to the insect moulting hormone ecdysteroid) have been identified from the fungus, including paxillosterone, 20,22-p-hydroxybenzylidene acetal, atrotosterones A, B, and C, and 25-hydroxyatrotosterones A and B.

The station relies heavily on volunteers for programming and also carries programming from National Public Radio, Public Radio International, and Pacifica radio network. The station went on the air in 1973, becoming the eighth open-access, listener-supported station in the U.S. and the first to serve an audience of less than 100,000 people.http://www.kopn.org/about/history/ History The station traces its roots to a November 1971 meeting at The Issue, an alternative newspaper in Columbia. They picked the call sign KOPN to commemorate its openness to all. KOPN was founded as a project of the New Wave Corporation whose initial directors were Patricia Mae Watkins, Gerald Keliher, Harry Pearle, and Kathy Bierbach all of whom signed the initial incorporation papers. Keliher was the station's first manager, Pearle was the first chief engineer, Watkins was the first program director, and Bierbach was the first news director. The first music director was Jeff Mintz. Most of the incorporators had worked together on various alternative newspapers prior to starting KOPN. The station received its FCC Construction Permit and officially began broadcasting at 10watts on March 3, 1973. It broadcast a monaural signal and operated out of a studio and office space shared with the Columbia Community Grocery, a natural food cooperative, on the second floor of 915 East Broadway. The food co-op left that building in the mid-1970's but KOPN programming still originates from that address. In its first 2 months it had $340.81 in cash and $200 in subscriptions. It broadcast from atop the newly opened 15-story Paquin Tower adjoining the University of Missouri campus and Columbia's second tallest building and highest above average terrain.https://emporis.de/city/102667/columbia-mo-usa/status/all-buildings/1 In the planning stages the radio received assistance from KDNA personnel Jeremy Lansman and Lorenzo Milam who had started similarly formatted KDNA in St. Louis. KDNA had already financial failed by the time KOPN went on the air. KOPN acquired KDNA's the 20 kW CCA transmitter and in 1974 began broadcasting at 40,000 watts and moved its frequency from 89.7 MHz to 89.5 MHz. From its earliest years, the station has hosted locally produced radio plays. In 1979 it created the Midwest Radio Theatre project, partially funded by a modest National Endowment for the Arts Services to the Field grant. The station produced and hosted the first weel-long [Midwest Radio Theatre Workshop] (MRTW) in 1980. Jim Jordan, the golden age radio star of \\"Fibber McGee and Molly\\" was the first guest host and keynote speaker. MRTW continued as an annual live radio performance and radio drama training event for over 2 decades in Columbia. Later it was incorporated as a separate 501(c)(3) non- profit named the National Audio Theatre Festival (NATF) the performance and training event was moved to West Plains, Missouri. Today, NATF has evolved into the annual Hear Now Festival, which features public listening sessions and performances by many renowned audio performance producers in Kansas City, Missouri . In 1977, KOPN's parent, The New Wave Corporation, sought to bring public television and PBS programming to Columbia. The University of Missouri owns and operates full power TV station KOMU as a commercial NBC affiliate and not a public television station and thus there was no public TV signal available in mid-Missouri. New Wave was granted a construction permit and the call letters K56AU. Two attempts were made to re-broadcast PTV signals, first from KETC, St Louis, with a series of microwave relay towers which was only marginally successful. Later New Wave built a huge custom engineered UHF receiving antenna atop the Paquin High Rise building (affectionately called \\"The Fence\\" by the group of volunteer engineers who constructed the thing) to receive a public television station signal from Kansas City, KCPT. This actually worked for about a year but K56AU's low power TV signal reached only an 11-mile radius from its tower and was hampered by frequent outages. After a major ice and windstorm destroyed the antenna, New Wave Corp. abandoned the station, K56AU eventually was licensed to Trinity Broadcast Network.http://kcradio.tripod.com/895col.html and operated as a repeater for Trinity's religious programming. In 1984 the station entered an agreement with the University of Missouri to move its transmitter from Paquin Tower to a 200 foot tower on land owned by the University on Route Z, several miles north of downtown Columbia. Its power was reduced from 40 kW ERP to its present 36 kW ERP. This move came after years of unsuccessful attempts by the University to get the FCC to either revoke or significantly modify KOPN's license to broadcast with 40 kW ERP at the Paquin Tower location. The University claimed that RF interference from KOPN caused problems for operations and experiments at its nearby Chemistry and Physics buildings. After spending far more on legal fees in its unsuccessful efforts with the FCC than it actually cost to move the facilities, the University finally offered to pay to move the station's transmitting facilities to its current location on Route Z.https://www.newspapers.com/clip/17825425/kopn_power_19800504_p27/ While some of the station's public affairs offerings in the 1970s tended to be leftist/progressive, it carried programs from many other points of view, as well. It was one of only two stations in Missouri to carry the far right 5 minute daily program \\"This is Liberty Lobby\\" which concluded with an invitation to get the group's \\"America First\\" publication. In February 1981 the station received extensive publicity after escapees from the Missouri State Penitentiary in Jefferson City, Missouri called the station's Zebra Sunrise show aimed at inmates to complain about prison conditions. In a wink to its progressive history the station on April Fools' Day in 1981 joked that it would cancel \\"Zebra Sunrise\\" which had been deemed moral trash by the Moral Majority and station would begin producing anti-Communist programs, have a 50 percent increase in religious programming and offer Paul Harvey, Phyllis Schlafly, William Buckley and Jerry Falwell as commentators and that \\"Liberty Lobby will be aired morning, noon and night.\\" In 1996 the station became associated with National Public Radio. While this brought some federal grants to the station it also put it in direct competition with the University of Missouri-owned NPR radio station KBIA (which is just four blocks from KOPN) for the same subscribers and division of federal grants. The NPR affiliation also meant increased costs for membership. At the time KBIA did not broadcast the entire NPR offering particularly talk shows as KBIA broadcast classical music instead. This led to an initial scheduling battle as KBIA increased its talk time. The station has gone through economic issues including in 1984, 1991 (when it almost lost its lease), and in 1994 (when it gave up its bingofundraiser). In 2017-2018 it went through another crisis because of proposed cuts in federal grants to public broadcasting entities, particularly its main grant source from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Estimates in the small market of Columbia is that it has \\"2,000-3,000 listeners per week and roughly 800 listener-sponsors\\" In 2018 its budget was $200,000. For a time, KOPN loaned its online store sales to women in developing nations, working with Kiva (organization) which specializes in funding loans to entrepreneurs in the developing world (this was seen as a way to support others in need, with no actual cost to the station).https://www.columbiamissourian.com/news/local/spence-seeks-to-build- on-kopn-s--year-history/article_ab9518fe-110c-11e8-90ab-37af71ecc7db.html Records and audio recordings of its programs from its founding through 1999 are now housed at the State Historical Society of Missouri in St. Louis.https://shsmo.org/manuscripts/columbia/ca5984.pdf See also *List of community radio stations in the United States References External links OPN Category:Radio stations in Columbia, Missouri Category:Community radio stations in the United States Category:NPR member stations ","title":"KOPN"},{"id":"8064988","text":"Zhu Meichuo (1630 ‚Äì 26 September 1646), better known by her title Princess Changping, was a Chinese princess of the Ming dynasty. She was a daughter of the Chongzhen Emperor, the last Ming emperor. Life Changping was born to the Chongzhen Emperor and Consort Wang. As Consort Wang died from illness not long after Changping's birth, the princess was raised by Empress Zhou. Changping had an elder sister, Princess Kunyi (Âù§ÂÑÄÂÖ¨‰∏ª), and a younger sister, Princess Zhaoren (Êò≠‰ªÅÂÖ¨‰∏ª). When Changping was 16, her father arranged for her marriage to Zhou Xian (Âë®È°Ø; a.k.a. Zhou Shixian Âë®‰∏ñÈ°Ø), a military officer. However, their wedding was cancelled as Li Zicheng and his rebel army was approaching the capital, Beijing. When the capital eventually fell to the rebels, the Chongzhen Emperor started killing members of his household, including Princess Zhaoren. He shouted at Changping, \\"Why must you be born in this family?\\", and slashed his sword at her, cutting off her left arm. Changping fainted due to blood loss, but regained consciousness five days later and survived, while her father committed suicide by hanging himself on a tree. In 1645, Changping asked the Shunzhi Emperor of the Qing dynasty, which had replaced the Ming dynasty, for permission to become a Buddhist nun. The Shunzhi Emperor refused and arranged for her to marry Zhou Xian per her father's wish. The couple treated each other with respect after their marriage. Changping died of illness a year later with pregnancy. She was buried outside Guangning Gate (present-day Guang'anmen) in Beijing. In popular culture Changping had a greater impact on folklore and popular culture than history, with various stories revolving around the concept that she survived her early death. One tale tells that Changping became a nun after the fall of the Ming dynasty. She practised martial arts and became a leader of the resistance movement against the Qing dynasty. She was nicknamed \\"One- Armed Divine Nun\\" (Áç®ËáÇÁ•ûÂ∞º) for her formidable prowess. One of her apprentices was L√º Siniang (ÂëÇÂõõÂ®ò), a fictional heroine who assassinated the Yongzheng Emperor. Lu Siniang is also rumored to be the mother of Emperor Qianlong. This version of the folktale appears in Liang Yusheng's Jianghu San N√ºxia (\\"The Three Heroines of the Martial Arts World\\"). Changping appears as a major character in Louis Cha's novel Sword Stained with Royal Blood. She is called \\"A'Jiu\\" (Èòø‰πù; lit. \\"The Ninth\\", implying she is the Chongzhen Emperor's ninth child) in the novel and had romantic feelings for the protagonist, Yuan Chengzhi. However, at the end of the novel, after losing an arm, she decides to become a Buddhist nun and changes her name to \\"Jiunan\\" (‰πùÈõ£; lit. \\"Nine Tribulations\\"). She has a minor role in The Deer and the Cauldron, another novel by Louis Cha that is regarded as an unofficial sequel to Sword Stained with Royal Blood. In The Deer and the Cauldron, she has become a powerful martial artist and she accepts the anti-hero protagonist, Wei Xiaobao, as an apprentice. The love story of Changping and Zhou Xian was adapted into a Cantonese opera, titled Di N√º Hua (Â∏ùÂ•≥Ëä±; lit. Emperor's Daughter Flower). The opera was later adapted into a film and a television series.

Wang Delin was born in October 1875. He became a bandit in Manchuria after the Russian invasion in July 1900 when Tsarist forces were sent to Northeast China, to protect the Russian-owned Chinese Eastern Railway or CER. Wang declared his opposition to both the Russians and China's Qing dynasty, describing himself as \\"forced to become an outlaw to cast out the Russians and save the nation\\". His band operated attacking trains along the eastern part of the CER, in the Muleng and Suifen areas. He also attacked Russian shipping on the Songhua and Ussuri rivers and held captives for ransom. Wang was an outlaw for years, even beyond the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1911. In 1917, Wang agreed that he and his followers would become part of the Jilin provincial forces, himself as commander of the Third Battalion of the First Brigade of the Jilin Army. Wang brought with him, two companions who had been with him for many years, Wu Yicheng and Kong Xianrong, each commanding a company. Still a battalion commander at the time of the Mukden Incident in 1931, Wang was stationed near Yanji, a small town in the east of Jilin province, where the Japanese were constructing a new, railway line. After Wang's troops fired on a party of Japanese surveyors, his commander attempted to persuade him to move his battalion with an offer of promotion. Wang refused to submit to the Manchukuo regime and his defiance attracted others to join him. When on February 8, 1932, Wang Delin proclaimed the establishment of the Chinese People's National Salvation Army (NSA), his battalion of 200 men had swollen to a force of over 1,000. By capturing the town of Dunhua on February 20, the Wang reversed the Japanese advance which had seemed irresistible until then. He was attracting the support of peasant brotherhoods and bandits, and a few Korean nationalists, that were already taking up arms against the recently proclaimed State of Manchukuo. By the end of the month, the NSA was 4,600 strong. To bring in more recruits. Wang appealed to the patriotism of Chinese soldiers in the Manchukuo forces to not fight other Chinese, shaming them into deserting and joining the volunteers. The tactic succeeded, bringing large numbers of well-armed and trained recruits. In March 1932, a Japanese and Manchukuoan expeditionary force was defeated in a series of battles with the NSA around the shore of Lake Jingbo losing hundreds of casualties. These battles were small in scale, the volunteers using their knowledge of the local terrain to set ambushes, eventually compelling the Japanese to retreat to Harbin. By this time Wang had about 10,000 men and he was recognized as a general by the \\"Old Kirin\\" leader Gen. Li Du at his headquarters at Sanxing in Heilongjiang Province on the lower Sungari River. He along with Gen. Ting Chao raised a number of volunteers to supplement their regulars defeated at Harbin the previous year. These various forces constituted themselves initially as the Kirin Self- Defence Army, but by the end of April 1932 they were known as the National Salvation Army. The Japanese had concentrated northwest of Harbin against General Ma Zhanshan in spring and summer of 1932, which allowed the increase in partisan activity in Jilin and Liaoning provinces. This activity culminated in simultaneous attacks on cities throughout the South Manchurian Railway Zone as severe August floods halted Japanese operations based on Harbin, and isolated the troops engaged on them. Japanese preparations for invading Jehol province later that year had to be halted by the need to subdue this widespread partisan activity, and with Japanese forces concentrated to the west, the forces of Wang and Feng Zhanhai managed to briefly occupy the capital of Jilin province. However things began to go wrong when the NSA became embroiled in disputes with General Li Du's Jilin Self-Defence Army. One of Li's subordinates tried to persuade one of Wang Delin's commanders to put his force into the Self-Defence Army. Also, NSA troops were killed by the Self-Defence Army for the confiscation of the weapons of a White Russian mine owner. Finally, Li,s subordinate was put in a sack and thrown into a river, probably at the instigation of Wang Delin's deputy, Kong Xianrong. This rift forced the abandonment of the city. The Japanese followed up with \\"Anti Bandit\\" Operations that fall and winter that eventually drove the Volunteer armies to break up into small bands or retreat into the Soviet Union as Wang's force did on January 13, 1933. Eventually Wang returned to China via Europe, and continued to support the anti Japanese movement. On December 20, 1938 he died in the province of Shandong.

It is notable for being the primary grape in the cult wine Aleatico di Portoferraio made in Elba. In Chile is known as Red Moscatel. The grape has also been cultivated at Mudgee in New South Wales and California.J. Robinson Vines Grapes & Wines pg 189 Mitchell Beazley 1986 History During his exile in Elba, wine made from Aleatico was reportedly a favorite drink of Napoleon. Ampelographers suspect that Aleatico may be a dark-skinned variant of the French wine grape Muscat blanc √† Petits Grains, which is a member of the extensive Muscat family of grapes, believed to be the oldest family of Vitis vinifera in the world.Oz Clarke Encyclopedia of Grapes pg 35 Harcourt Books 2001 DNA profiling conducted at Istituto Agrario di San Michele all‚ÄôAdige suggests that the relationship between Muscat blanc √† Petits Grains and Aleatico may be that of a parent- offspring rather than just a mutation.Jancis Robinson (ed), \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\", 3rd edition (Oxford University Press, 2006, ), pp. 10-11 Similar theories posit that the grape is descended from Tuscan Muscat Noir. Historians also disagree on Aleatico's exact origins: the vine may have been brought to Italy by the ancient Greeks or is native to the southern Italian region of Apulia.S. Gold \\"Aleatico - A little Known Italian Grape that makes a fabulous Dessert Wine \\" Alta Cucina Epicurean Society, Accessed: December 13th, 2009 During the 14th century, the Italian wine writer Pietro Crescenzi wrote of wine being produced in central Italy from the \\"Livatica\\" grape, today believed to be Aleatico. In Elba, there is a long history of producing dessert wines from Aleatico. During his exile on Elba, the Aleatico wines of the island became a favorite drink of Napoleon. He was reported to have said that they were his only consolation during this time. Wine regions Aleatico is most commonly found in Italy, Tuscany (primarily in Elba), Lazio, Umbria, Piedmont,https://www.quattrocalici.it/tipologie-vino/colli-tortonesi-novello- doc/ Apulia. Smaller plantings can be found in the regions of Marche, Abruzzo and Sicily. Outside of Italy the grape is grown in Azerbaijan,http://aspiwinery.az/en/production/aleatico Australia, California, Chile, Corsica (though not permitted in any AOC-authorized wines), Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. For most of the 20th century, Italian plantings of the grape had been in decline, but recent years have seen a spike of interest in the variety. In Elba there is a Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita, the Aleatico dell‚ÄôElba Passito DOCG dedicated to the production of passito- style wines made from Aleatico. Under Italy's appellation system, very few dessert wines receive the highest designation of DOCG level, making the Aleatico dell‚ÄôElba Passito a rarity in Italy. In Piedmont is famous \\"Novello rosso DOC\\" produced in Colli Tortonesi.https://www.quattrocalici.it/tipologie- vino/colli-tortonesi-novello-doc/ In Lazio, Aleatico is found around Lake Bolsena, where it has its own Denominazione di Origine Controllata region of the Aleatico di Gradoli DOC.

McCarthy Italian Wines for Dummies pg 198 Hungry Minds 2001 In Apulia the Aleatico di Puglia DOC exists for this grape. Wine styles Lychee is an aroma descriptor often attributed to wines made from Aleatico. Aleatico is often used to produce dessert wines. The grapes may be dried or the wines may be fortified in a liquoroso style. The wines are typically aged at least 6 months prior to release, with Italian wines labeled as \\"Liquoroso Riserva,\\" requiring three years of aging, at least 2 of them in wood barrels. Aleatico wines are characterized by the aroma of roses, a trait they share with Muscat blanc √† Petits Grains. Other aroma notes commonly include various berry fruits and lychees. Aleatico wines tend to have high alcohol content balanced by the grape's acidity. Synonyms and mutations In Chile, the grape is known as Red Moscatel. Rare synonyms include Livatica, Leatico and Agliano. A white mutation known as Aleatico Bianco exists but is infrequently cultivated.

Hyoshigi-no oto (Sound of wooden clappers) Here you can hear the 'clink, clink' sound of beating wooden clappers coming from nowhere in the middle of the night. Legend has it that the source of the noise is a tengu, a long-nosed goblin who lives inside in Mount Misen. People are warned to stay indoors when they hear the noise or risk being cursed. Shigure-zakura (showered cherry blossom) This is a cherry tree that was always moist with dew, as if there has been a passing shower, even on a dry and sunny day.

The 2020 State Fair was canceled due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. History The fair was first held in October 1881 under the direction of Elias S. Stover. Originally referred to as the Territorial Fair, it became a State Fair in 1911 in anticipation of New Mexico's upcoming statehood. The original fairgrounds, also known as Traction Park, were southwest of Old Town Plaza and were promoted as a year-round destination by the Albuquerque streetcar company in order to boost ridership on their line.

Leon Harms, formerly the founder of the Marion County Fair in Kansas, laid out the grounds and managed the fair from its inception until 1958. The first State Fair in 1938 attracted about 64,000 visitors. By the 1960s, attendance had grown to over 500,000 annually and the grounds included \\"83 structures of varying sizes\\". The fair was originally held in October, but was moved up to mid-September in 1960 in hopes of having better weather. Grounds The fairgrounds in 2011 The New Mexico State Fairgrounds are located in eastern Albuquerque between Central Avenue, Lomas Boulevard, San Pedro Drive, and Louisiana Boulevard, and cover approximately . The facilities have been branded as \\"Expo New Mexico\\" since 2003. The original adobe fair buildings were built by the WPA between 1936 and the early 1940s. Surviving buildings from this period include the Agricultural Building, Fine Arts Building, Horse Barn, and Cattle Barn. The Agricultural Building was listed on the New Mexico State Register of Cultural Properties in 1988. Tingley Coliseum, an 11,800-seat indoor arena, opened in 1957. Expo New Mexico is the site of New Mexico's Merci Train boxcar, which was a gift from France in 1949. The boxcars were filled with gifts and distributed to each of the 48 U.S. states at the time, along with a 49th car which was shared by Hawaii and the District of Columbia.

Among his other career wins were the Princess Margaret Stakes (1971), Cherry Hinton Stakes (1971), Cork and Orrery Stakes (1973), Earl of Sefton Stakes (1977), Sandown Classic Trial (1978), July Cup (1971), Derby Stakes (1974, on Snow Knight), John Porter Stakes (1981), Ormonde Stakes (1981), Craven Stakes (1983), and in France, the Prix Gontaut-Biron (1984). While racing at the Sha Tin Racecourse in Hong Kong on 8 December 1984, his mount, Silver Star (ÈäÄÊòü‰∏ÄËôü), stumbled, throwing him off his saddle while crossing the finish line. Taylor would succumb two days later in hospital from the serious neck and head injuries he had received. Taylor had suffered from shingles however had recovered, his friend Bill Burnett wanted him to find someone else to replace him for that race in fact English Wally Hood offered to take the ride. At the last minute, however, he decided to do the race himself which turned out to be his last. Less than 10 months before Taylor's fall, Silver Star also ended the career of another top jockey at the time, Frenchman Philippe Paquet, by throwing the jockey onto the sand track during morning training on 13 February 1984, in similar fashion. Paquet suffered a fractured skull and remained in a coma for more than three months before regaining consciousness.

Early life Plaque on O'Donohoe's birthplace, Clonegal. Born to a peasant family in County Carlow, O'Donoghue was self educated. He managed to gain a place at Trinity College Dublin.Nine Fine Irishmen Ballingarry History He worked as a Law Clerk in Dublin. Young Irelander Rebellion In the aftermath of the failed Young Irelander Rebellion at Ballingarry, County Tipperary, in July 1848, he was placed in October 1848 before a British 'Special Commission' at Clonmel in County Tipperary and sentenced to death for treason. As with other prominent Young Irelanders, this was later commuted to transportation for life to the penal colony at Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania). Transportation to Van Diemen's Land Trial of the Irish patriots at Clonmel. Thomas Francis Meagher, Terence MacManus, and Patrick O'Donoghue receiving their sentence of death. In 1849 O'Donoghue, together with William Smith O'Brien, Terence MacManus, Thomas Francis Meagher and many others were on board the prisoner transport ship the Swift for a six-month, 14,000-mile journey under difficult conditions which some fellow prisoners did not survive. On 26 January 1850, \\"Using materials he had begged and borrowed\\" as one account gives it, Patrick O'Donoghue started publishing in Hobart Town a weekly newspaper named The Irish Exile, aimed mainly at fellow Irish prisoners and deportees and considered to be the first Irish Nationalist paper to be published in Australia. The paper featured Irish ballads and poetry, articles about Irish history, and a regular column by John Martin reporting on the situation of the Repeal Movement (campaigning to repeal the Act of Union under which the Irish Parliament had been abolished). There were also local news of the Irish deportee community, then numbering in the thousands, and of Hobart Town daily life in general. O'Donoghue used The Irish Exile to publish excerpts of his journal aboard The Swift, which were reprinted in Australian, British and Irish newspapers. Brisbane's The Moreton Bay Courier (reprinted from Dublin's The Nation) found that the journal \\"will show how severely the tyrannical government of England visited the offences of the Ballingarry cabbage-tree heroes. The studies of Messrs. O'Brien, Meagher (afterwards O'), and O'Donoghoe, will amuse the reader\\". While in Van Diemen's Land, the Launceston Examiner reprinted London's The Examiners view that \\"a singularly large amount of mercy has been shown to those grown-up children who made the escapade from Dublin to raise the standard of Irish rebellion at Ballingarry. One of the worthies, Mr. Patrick O'Donoghue, has published an account of his deportation; and certainly a more pleasureable voyage could not have been under taken at the expanse of government. A roomy cabin, a capital library, a fair dinner, with a couple of glasses of wine, and cigars upon deck, from the dietary and the entertainment of the political exiles\\". Publication of the paper was not in itself illegal, but was highly displeasing to the Governor, Sir William Denison, who found that the paper could be suppressed by arresting O'Donoghue and charging him with having \\"left his allocated district\\". He was sentenced to one year's work in a chain-gang ‚Äì a time spent at hard labour, living in a convict station and wearing a convict uniform, mainly in the company of non-political prisoners such as \\"rapists, muggers and thieves\\". In March 1851 he was released and taken back to Hobart Town. Undeterred, he immediately restarted his paper, prominently featuring an extensive personal account of his year with the chain gang. The governor reacted by sending him again to a chain gang, at a more distant location this time ‚Äì the Cascades Penal Station. Three months later the governor ordered him released from there and sent to Launceston. On the way there, he succeeded in escaping from his guards with the help of fellow-prisoners, who managed to smuggle him on board the ship Yarra Yara, on its way to Melbourne. Escape to America There, he successfully hid from the British authorities (who may have been tacitly happy to see the last of him) and with further help from Irish sympathisers managed to get to San Francisco, where some of his fellows such as MacManus and Meagher also ended up. He died in New York City on 22 January 1854, shortly before the arrival of his wife on a ship from Ireland. The time spent in the chain gang may have contributed to undermining his health. The other escaped state prisoners did not attend his funeral, although Michael Doheny and Michael Cavanagh, fellow Young Irelanders who lived in New York, did.

The Alaska Mountain Wilderness Classic (sometimes called the Alaska Wilderness Classic) is an adventure challenge that espouses purity of style and zero impact. Started in 1982 as a wilderness traverse, the Classic has crossed various mountain ranges throughout Alaska with some routes covering nearly . Traditionally, the same route has been used for three years in a row, with each year being a different month (June, July, or August). The rules are simple: start to finish with no outside support, requiring that racers carry all food and equipment; human-powered; leave no trace; and rescue is up to the individual to resolve. The most common form of transportation is by foot and packraft, although bicycles, skis, and paragliders have been used by intrepid participants. Beginning in 2004, participants have been required to carry satellite phones or Satellite emergency notification device like the DeLorme inReach to facilitate emergency rescues. The organization of the challenge is grass-roots, having no affiliation to any organization or group, while generally fewer than 30 people enter in any one year. The Classic is often perceived as a race, but most certainly not a race. It has had an influence on American adventure racing, backcountry use of the packraft, and ultralight hiking is significant. In addition to the summer challenge, there is an even more low-key unaffiliated winter event, the Alaska Mountain Wilderness Ski Classic, which has taken place every year since 1987 with races through the Chugach Mountains, Alaska Range, Brooks Range, and Wrangell-St. Elias.

It is sometimes known by the subtitle In nomine Domini.  Background  The symphony was one of a series of six symphonies commissioned in 1784 by the Concert de la Loge Olympique, a popular concert subscription in Paris (hence the name for the series as a whole). Like the other Paris symphonies, Symphony no. 84 was written for the largest orchestral ensemble that Haydn had written for up until that time, including reinforced woodwind parts and a large string section. Unlike the other Paris symphonies (save No. 87), in No. 84 greater \\"prominence [is] given to woodwind instruments.\\"(Harrison, 1998): 89 Despite its number, the symphony was actually one of the last of the six Paris symphonies to be composed. It was completed in 1786.  Movements  The work is in standard four movement form and scored for flute, two oboes, two bassoons, two horns, and strings. #Largo ‚Äî Allegro #Andante, in B major #Menuet e Trio, #Finale: Vivace The slow second movement is a hybrid between ternary and variation form. The main theme is similar in shape to the introduction to the first movement. After the theme is stated, there is a contrasting passage in the minor which is only loosely based melodically on the main theme. Then two more strophic variations follow, the first lyrical and the second more grand. The movement then segues to a cadenza passage that features the full wind band over pizzicato strings before the full tutti concludes the movement with one last statement of the theme.Brown, A.

Career He started his career with Cork City FC in Ireland in 2003, having moved there from his native country Bosnia and Herzegovina. Admir had a successful time with Cork City's youth teams and that caught the eye of the senior manager who signed Admir as a full-time pro at the age of 17. He made a handful of appearances for the first team during his time at Cork, which included 3 Champions League qualifier games against Apollon Limassol and Red Star Belgrade respectively. Admir only made a sub appearance against Apollon in Cyprus, while he played full 90 minutes against Red Star in both legs of the qualifiers. Admir also won the FAI Cup '07 with Cork and lost two Cup finals (FAI Cup '04 and Setanta Cup '06) during his time there. In 2008, after Alan Mathews arrived as the new manager of Cork City, things didn't look well for Admir. He only made 1 appearance in the League Cup against Cobh Ramblers and put in a transfer request in mid-July. Admir left the club after 5 years and joined one of the biggest clubs in his native country, FK ≈Ωeljezniƒçar in Sarajevo, but in the first month after arriving, he had a horrific injury, breaking his ankle in 2 places and was sidelined for the next 5 months. He came back after the injury and finally made his debut in March 2009 away to FK Sloboda.

He has represented the Republic of Ireland national team. Club career Cork City Bennett was born in Cork, Republic of Ireland on 4 October 1981. He began his footballing career at his local club Richmond, based in Waterfall, County Cork, which competes in the West Cork League. He was coached by highly regarded coach Colm Donovan. Bennett subsequently joined League of Ireland Premier Division club Cork City in 2000 at the age of 18. He initially played as a midfielder, but was converted to the defensive role of centre-back during the 2004 season. He made more than 150 appearances for the \\"Rebel Army\\", scoring ten goals. During his time at Cork City, Bennett played in The UEFA Cup and Champions league and also won a FAI Youth Cup medal in 2000, National league Medal in 2005 and 3 Munster Senior Cup medals. Reading Following several bids, Bennett joined Reading on a two and a half-year contract for an undisclosed fee thought to be ¬£250,000 on 30 January 2007. On 31 July 2007, he was loaned for six months to Southampton and made his debut during a home defeat to Crystal Palace. He returned to Reading in January 2008. On 7 March 2008, he joined Brentford on loan during this time Bennett scored his first goal in English football against Bradford City. On 28 July 2008, Bennett was told that he did not feature in Reading's plans and was told to find a new club. He began a second loan spell at Brentford on 8 August 2008, initially for one month, although this was extended to five months on 31 August 2008, following Man-of- the-Match performances against Rotherham United and Notts County. His loan was then extended for a third time until the end of the 2008‚Äì09 season. Bennett appeared in over 50 games for Brentford in the 2008‚Äì09 season and assumed the role of team captain in the absence of regular captain Kevin O'Connor. As O'Connor was out for the match that decided if they won the league or not Bennett was made captain and lifted the League Two trophy after a 3‚Äì1 victory over Darlington. Bennett scored the opening goal in this fixture. At the end of the 2008‚Äì09 season, Bennett was released by Reading. Brentford He signed a permanent contract with Brentford on 30 July 2009 which was set to run until June 2011 and was appointed club captain. On 16 February 2010 Bennett joined Wycombe Wanderers on a one-month emergency loan. He returned to Brentford at the end of the loan period because of the Bees' lack of defensive cover, but signed a new loan deal with Wycombe until the end of the season on 25 March 2010. One week later, before he had made any further appearances for the club, he sustained an ankle injury that looked to have ruled him out for the rest of the season and he returned to Brentford for treatment. However, he recovered quicker than expected and returned to training at Wycombe in late April. He returned to the team for the final game of the season against Gillingham, scoring his first goal for the club during this match. Wycombe Wanderers On 23 July 2010 Bennett joined Wycombe Wanderers on a permanent one-year contract. Bennett was part of the Wycombe squad that achieved automatic promotion to League One that year, unfortunately injuries limited his appearances. Cheltenham Town On 4 July 2011 Bennett joined Cheltenham Town on a one-year contract. Bennett was made captain of Cheltenham by manager Mark Yates shortly after his arrival. Bennett formed an excellent defensive partnership with Steve Elliott that saw Cheltenham spend much of the season chasing automatic promotion. Bennett played a big part in Cheltenham reaching the 3rd round of the FA Cup which drew them away to Tottenham Hostspur. They went on to lose 3‚Äì0; however, the game will go down as one of the biggest days in the club's history. Cheltenham's form suffered after the FA Cup game but they still managed to seal a League Two play-off position under Bennett's captaincy. Cheltenham went on to beat Torquay United in the play-off semi-finals, but lose the play-off final to Crewe Alexandra, thus confirming another season in League Two. On 31 January 2013, Bennett left Cheltenham after his contract was terminated by mutual consent. AFC Wimbledon Following his contract termination, he signed for fellow League Two team AFC Wimbledon also on 31 January 2013. The ability and experience Bennett brought to the AFC Wimbledon defence in the second half of the 2012‚Äì13 season helped \\"The Dons\\" avoid relegation from the Football League and remain a League Two team for a third successive season. Cork City On 6 February 2015, Bennett returned to his home-town club, Cork City He scored City's first goal in European Competition since 2007 in their opening game against KR Reykjavik on 2 July 2015.

About 115 species in about 9 genera are known chiefly from the Oriental and Afrotropic biogeographic regions with one lineage in the New World. Description Celyphidae are small to medium-sized and easily recognised. The scutellum is enlarged, and forming a protective shell over the abdomen, giving them a beetle-like appearance. Also, like many beetles, Celyphidae are often shiny or metallic in color. The head has few bristles. The wings, when at rest, are folded beneath the scutellar \\"shell\\". The arista of the antenna is often flattened and leaf-like at the base. The family name is derived from the Greek word Œ∫Œ≠ŒªŒΩœÜŒøœÇ for pod or shell. Male celyphids lack an aedeagus and instead have paired gonapophyses that are used in copulation and are of key taxonomic value. A live specimen from Shendurney Hills, Kerala, India Biology The biology of the family is poorly known. Adults are found along streams and rivers, and in wet, grassy areas. Larvae are saprophagous. Relatives The family Celyphidae is considered by most authors to be the sister taxon of the Lauxaniidae (e.g., Griffiths 1972), and this has been supported by some molecular studies which suggest the (Chamaemyiidae + (Lauxaniidae + Celyphidae)) within the Lauxanoiodea.

The spar tree is selected based on height, location and especially strength and lack of rot in order to withstand the weight and pressure required. Once a spar tree is selected, a climber would remove the tree's limbs and top the tree (a logging term for cutting off the top of the tree). Block and tackle is then affixed to the tree and cabling is run. A \\"high climber\\" is the member of the logging crew who scales the tree, limbs it, and tops it. Selecting a tree as a spar is a particularly important task, so the strength and importance of the spar came to hold symbolic meaning for early loggers of the West.

It is located 2.3 km from the junction at ≈åfuna Station, and 51.7 km from Tokyo Station. Station layout Level crossing providing access between platforms in 1994 Kita-Kamakura Station has two opposed side platforms serving two tracks, which are connected by a level crossing at the Kamakura end of the platforms. The station building is located on the side of the up (Tokyo-bound) track at the end of the platform nearest to Kamakura. To reach the down platform, passengers must cross the tracks via a level-crossing. The station building has one normal exit, the , where there are three automatic ticket gates. However, during the morning school commute time only, students of the Kamakura Gakuen schools and Kita-Kamakura Joshi Gakuen schools can exit without passing through the ticket gates, via a temporary exit. This exit does not have a ticket gate. On the side of the tracks leading away from Tokyo there is special exit which, like the Front Exit, is usable all day. It is mainly intended for disembarking, but passengers who already have a ticket from this station, or who are using a Suica or Suica-affiliated IC card can enter here. There is no automatic ticket gate, and only a very simple Suica touch point. There is one more special exit on the same side of the tracks, near the middle of the platform. It is only usable during the morning rush hour, Golden Week, and other times when the station is very crowded. During crowded weekend days and holidays there is a station attendant manning the ticket gate there, allowing payment in cash. A simple Suica touch point was installed in 2008. Although the current station includes many stairs, there is a plan to make the station barrier-free, to be completed in 2013. According to the plan, elevators will be installed where there are stairs, both platforms will have wheelchair ramps, extending the platforms by seven meters, the entire platforms will be covered by a roof, and a multi-purpose toilet will be installed.

It serves as the only Level I Trauma Center for the 1.5 million residents of San Francisco and northern San Mateo County. It is the largest acute inpatient and rehabilitation hospital for psychiatric patients in the city. Additionally, it is the only acute hospital in San Francisco that provides 24-hour psychiatric emergency services. In addition to the approximately 3,500 San Francisco municipal employees, the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) provides approximately 1,500 employees (including Physicians, nurses and ancillary personnel), and the SFGH serves as one of the teaching hospitals for the UCSF School of Medicine. The hospital, especially its Ward 86, was instrumental in treating and identifying early cases of AIDS. A new San Francisco General Hospital acute care building was completed in 2016 for a total approximate cost of $1.02 billion. A $75 million donation by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan covered approximately 7% of the overall cost. In recognition, the hospital was renamed after the couple. The hospital is a safety net hospital additionally serving poor, elderly people, uninsured working families, and immigrants. About 80 percent of its patient population either receives publicly funded health insurance (Medicare or Medi-Cal) or is uninsured. SFGH also cares for the homeless, who make up about 8 percent of its patients. SFGH is rare in that its emergency rooms do not have agreements in place with private health care insurance providers. Through 2019, privately insured patients were often billed the balance of their care, which could be sizable. This practice was changed after media attention.  Timeline The following events occurred for this hospital: * 1850: San Francisco Granted a city Charter and creates a Board of Health; cholera strikes, temporary hospital set up. * 1857: City and County opens its first permanent hospital in the former North Beach schoolhouse at Stockton and Francisco streets. * 1864: ‚ÄúIn the fall of 1864, Hugh Toland opened his new medical school, which in 1872 would become part of the University of California.

The new building was the first hospital in San Francisco to be constructed with a base-isolated foundation for protection against earthquakes. Notable improvements include expanding the capacity of the emergency department and increasing the number of general admission beds, increasing the number of intensive care unit (ICU) beds, and combining the previously separate surgical and medical units into one ICU. * Billing practices Through early 2019, SFGH did not participate in any private health insurance networks and practiced balance billing. A Vox analysis (derived from a database of more than a thousand emergency room bills) characterized the hospital's billing practices as \\"aggressive\\" and \\"surprising\\": one privately insured patient arriving at the hospital after a bicycle accident was billed more than $20,000 for diagnostic scans and treatment for a broken arm; the bill was 12 times the Medicare billing rate. After media attention, SFGH changed its billing policy so that privately insured patients would be billed at rates consistent with the their insurers' network rates, with an income- based maximum.

The filmi-ghazals retain the couplet format and rhyme scheme similar to that in ghazals. However, instead of vocal or instrumental passages as interludes, the filmi-ghazal usually uses precomposed musical pieces. History The ghazal tradition of Urdu poetry was the basis for early Bollywood music, ever since the first Indian talkie film, Alam Ara (1931). In turn, filmi ghazals had roots in earlier Urdu Parsi theatre during the 19th to early 20th centuries. The ghazal was the dominant style of Indian film music since the 1930s up until the 1960s. By the 1980s, however, ghazals had become marginalized in film music. Reasons for the decline include Urdu ghazal poetry being gradually phased out from the Indian education system, lyricists targeting urban middle-class audiences, and the influence of Western and Latin American music. Music directors like Madan Mohan composed notable filmi-ghazals extensively for Muslim socials in the 1960s and the 1970s. The filmi-ghazal style experienced a revival in the early 1990s, sparked by the success of Nadeem‚ÄìShravan's Aashiqui (1990). It had a big impact on Bollywood music, ushering in ghazal-type romantic music that dominated the early 1990s, with soundtracks such as Dil (1990), Saajan (1991), Phool Aur Kaante (1991) and Deewana (1992). However, the filmi ghazal style was once again marginalized by the early 21st century, as filmi songs became faster-paced along with greater Western and Latin influences. However, there have been a number of well-received filmi ghazal songs composed into the 2010s. A popular ghazal song from Aashiqui was \\"Dheere Dheere\\", a cover version of which was later recorded by Yo Yo Honey Singh and released by T-Series in 2015.

This community is concentrated mainly in the Northern Shewa Zone in the Amhara Region in Ethiopia. The earliest reference to the Jewish community in the historical region of Shewa comes from the 14th century missionary Zena Marqos.James Quirin, The Evolution of the Ethiopian Jews, p. 48 More Jews arrived in the region of Shewa from the regions of Fogera and Dembiya during the rule of Negasi Krestos and as a result a first wave of Jewish immigration began in the years 1692-1702. Negasi's grandson, the Meridazmach Abuye fought the forces of emperor Iyasu II, and later on held many of the emperor's soldiers in captivity. Eventually Abuye released some prisoners and appointed them to senior positions in the monarchy. Following this, a second Jewish migration wave began in 1730-1745, which was mainly prompted by the Jews' will to improve their living conditions. There are quite a few surviving reports about the existence of a Jewish community in the Shewa region in the 19th century. In 1839 the European missionary Charles Isenberg toured Shewa's capital Ankober and reported that there were Jews around the capital of Shewa and that they were the descendants of those who emigrated from the Fogera region in the Begemder province to Shewa. Isenberg also mentioned that when he spoke with an Ethiopian missionary from the Ethiopian Church on 17 October 1839 he reported that several Jews integrated in the village and converted to Christianity.H. Gundert, Biography of the Rev. Charles Isenberg, Missionary of the Church Missionary Society to Abyssinia and Western India from 1832 to 1864, part V This came after another by the British traveler Charles Johnson in 1842 that stated that the Jews' economic situation was better off than their Christian neighbors and that they were more skilled and described them as successful merchants.

It considered seven locations in Finnmark, including Vard√∏ and recommended in its report that planning continue. Simultaneously the Ministry of Transport and Communications was working on a plan for larger short take-off and landing airports. It decided that such airports will first be built in Helgeland, then Lofoten and Vester√•len and finally in Troms and Finnmark.Melling: 64 Wider√∏e Dash 8-100 Norving started operating irregular air taxi flights to Vard√∏ after they took delivery of an eight-seat Britten-Norman Islander in April 1970.Melling: 66 In addition, the airline used the air field for air ambulance services. Norving received permission to operate a scheduled taxi route from Vard√∏ to Kirkenes Airport, H√∏ybuktmoen and B√•tsfjord Airport from the late 1970s.Melling: 161 Construction of a new terminal and upgrading the airport to regional standard started in 1984. In February 1987 Vard√∏ Municipality received operating permission from the government. The investments cost NOK 11.4 million, of which NOK 10 million was to be financed through a loan and the rest through subsidies from the government and the county. The latter was also responsible for covering the operating deficit. The upgraded airport opened on 6 April 1987. The first two months Norving continued its taxi route service to the airport, but from 1 June a regular concession scheduled service was introduced. Wider√∏e took over the services in 1991. At first the airport was served using Twin Otters, but from the mid-1990s the Dash 8 was introduced. From 1996, Svartnes and 25 other regional airports were taken over by the state and the Civil Aviation Administration (later renamed Avinor). Wider√∏e lost the bid to operate the services between 2000 and 2003 to Arctic Air, but resumed services in 2003. Airport security was introduced on 1 January 2005. There has several times been discuss whether to close down the airport, having in mind that Vads√∏ Airport is 67 km away by road. In 2002 there was political support in Stortinget to close it if the road was upgraded,Flertall for √• legge ned Vard√∏ flyp but neither happened.

He has been described as \\"one of the most esteemed judges of the early twentieth century.\\"  Early life and career  Born at Claxby Rectory, Alford, Lincolnshire, Parker was the son of the Reverend Richard Parker and of Elizabeth Coffin. His sister was the mental health worker Dame Ellen Pinsent. He was educated at Westminster School, Eton College (where he was a King's Scholar and Newcastle medallist), and King's College, Cambridge. At Cambridge he won the Browne Medal for Greek ode, and in 1880 was bracketed fifth in the first class of the classical tripos. After taking his degree in 1880, Parker entered at Lincoln's Inn as a student and read in the chambers of Matthew Ingle Joyce. He was called to the bar in 1883 and remained in Ingle Joyce's chambers. In 1900, Ingle Joyce was appointed to the High Court, and Parker was selected by Lord FInlay to succeed Ingle Joyce as junior equity counsel to the Treasury, although he was unknown to the public. He never took silk.  Judicial career  Parker was appointed a justice of the High Court in 1906, receiving the customary knighthood. Assigned to the Chancery Division, he rapidly acquired a judicial reputation, and sometimes sat as an additional judge of the Court of Appeal. He was especially known for his trial of patent cases, and settled the practice under the Patents and Designs Act 1907. After delivering a judgement on the Marconi wireless telegraphy patents in 1913, he was invited to chair a technical advisory committee on wireless telegraphy, appointed to help the Postmaster-General to choose a system for the Imperial Wireless Chain. On 1 May 1913 the committee reported in favour of Marconi's system. On 4 March 1913, Parker was chosen to succeed to Lord Macnaghten as Lord of Appeal in Ordinary, an unusually fast progress from the junior bar. He was created a life peer, taking the title of Baron Parker of Waddington, of Waddington in the County of York, and was sworn of the Privy Council on 7 March. As an appellate judge, Parker had a high reputation, and was much concerned with the reputation and independence of the court. On one occasion, a politically fraught case came to the law lords, who divided 4 to 3 along party lines. Parker, who was in the minority, proposed to a judge in the majority that they should deliver each other's judgments, an offer which was refused. During the First World War, he sat on appeals from prize courts in the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, and rapidly mastered the intricate practice in prize cases, without any previous experience in the field. Parker also took part in public affairs. At the outbreak of the First World War, Parker lobbied privately ministers to introduce price controls, without success. He also spoke in the Lords, sometimes pressed by his friend Lord Curzon. In 1915, he spoke to the House of Lords about post-war reconstruction, and during the passage of the Representation of the People Act 1918 Parker (who had deputy high steward of the University of Cambridge since 1915) successfully pressed the Lords to allow women to vote in university constituencies even though they were disbarred from taking their degrees. On 19 March 1918, shortly before his death, Parker spoke on a motion by Lord Parmoor in favour of a League of Nations. Unable to read his handwriting due to failing light, Parker went to the table and read out a detailed scheme of twenty articles for the League's organisation. His health failing, Parker carried on working until the summer of 1918, before passing away on 12 July at Aldworth House, near Lurgashall, Sussex, the former residence of Lord Tennyson.  Family  Shield of arms of Lord Parker of Waddington On 9 September 1884 he married Constance Barkley, the daughter of a civil engineer; they had three sons and two daughters. One of his sons, Hubert Parker, Baron Parker of Waddington was Lord Chief Justice of England from 1958 to 1971, taking the same title as his father. The ancient Parker family seat is Browsholme Hall in the Forest of Bowland. Traditionally, the Parkers have served as Bowbearers to the Lords of Bowland.

Plot  Set in Tampoi, Johor (near Johor Bahru), Keluang Man made his first appearance in an alley where a man is trying to rob a girl. Since then, Keluang Man has been media's most wanted. Keluang Man's real name is 'Borhan' and he is actually one of the mental patients in Tampoi Mental Hospital. The hospital security makes it hard for Keluang Man to act during daylight, so he decided only to fight for justice at night. However, the existence of Keluang Man as a justice fighter did not make Inspector Shahab, the local police chief sit very well in his position. He sees Keluang Man as an annoying hero who always disturbs the police's business. In the second episode of the first season, Tiong Man makes his first appearance in Keluang Man as a counterpart, holding a similar role as Robin in the Batman series. Both superheroes work together to fight supervillains such as Badut (The Clown), Mata Batu Johan Hitam, Samsir, Majid Kilat, Meow The Cat Girl and many more with the hope that the town of Tumpoi will turn back into a peaceful place for everyone.

He was the son of Protestant missionaries John S. Emerson and Ursula Newell Emerson, and father of artist Arthur Webster Emerson. He attended Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts, and served in the First Regiment of the Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry during the Civil War, during which he was wounded three times. After graduating from Williams in 1865, he studied at Harvard and the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York City, from which he graduated in 1869. This was followed by work at Bellevue Hospital in New York City. In New York, Emerson was associated with Willard Parker, a surgeon, as student and assistant. For several years he was also clinical assistant to Dr. Seguin, professor of nervous diseases at the College of Physicians and Surgeons. He served as a doctor in New York until 1878, after which he relocated to Hawaii. Emerson was an historian and writer of Hawaiian mythology. One of his efforts was the translation into English of David Malo's work on Hawaiian lore and customs. In 1909, the Bureau of American Ethnology published his book, Unwritten Literature of Hawaii, and his last work, Pele and Hiiaka, was published in 1915. Emerson has been criticized by Hawaiian royalists and historians for being a founding member of the Hawaiian League of 1887, which authored the Bayonet Constitution forced on King KalƒÅkaua, under threat of death.; ; ; ; An original copy of the 1887 constitution in the Hawaii State Archives, once owned by William Owen Smith, contains a side note written by Smith listing Emerson as one of the main contributors to the constitution alongside Smith, Sanford B.

They are often used to tie some observable quantity (such as the luminosity of a distant quasar, the redshift of a distant galaxy, or the angular size of the acoustic peaks in the CMB power spectrum) to another quantity that is not directly observable, but is more convenient for calculations (such as the comoving coordinates of the quasar, galaxy, etc.). The distance measures discussed here all reduce to the common notion of Euclidean distance at low redshift. In accord with our present understanding of cosmology, these measures are calculated within the context of general relativity, where the Friedmann‚ÄìLema√Ætre‚ÄìRobertson‚ÄìWalker solution is used to describe the universe. Overview There are a few different definitions of \\"distance\\" in cosmology which all coincide for sufficiently small redshifts. The expressions for these distances are most practical when written as functions of redshift z, since redshift is always the observable. They can easily be written as functions of scale factor a=1/(1+z), cosmic time t or conformal time \\\\eta as well by performing a simple transformation of variables. By defining the dimensionless Hubble parameter and the Hubble distance d_H = c/H_0 , the relation between the different distances becomes apparent. E(z)=\\\\sqrt{\\\\Omega_r(1+z)^4+\\\\Omega_m(1+z)^3+\\\\Omega_k(1+z)^2+\\\\Omega_\\\\Lambda} Here, \\\\Omega_r is the total radiation energy density, \\\\Omega_m is the total matter density, \\\\Omega_\\\\Lambda is the dark energy density, \\\\Omega_k = 1-\\\\Omega_m-\\\\Omega_\\\\Lambda represents the curvature, H_0 is the Hubble parameter today and c is the speed of light. The Hubble parameter at a given redshift is then H(z) = H_0 E(z). To compute the distance to an object from its redshift, we must integrate the above equation. Although for some limited choices of parameters (e.g. matter-only: \\\\Omega_m = \\\\Omega_\\\\mathrm{total} = 1) the comoving distance integral defined below has a closed analytic form, in general‚Äîand specifically for the parameters of our Universe‚Äîwe can only find a solution numerically. Cosmologists commonly use the following measures for distances from the observer to an object at redshift z along the line of sight: Comoving distance: : d_C(z) = d_H \\\\int_0^z \\\\frac{dz'}{E(z')} Where here d_H is the Hubble distance, defined as the speed of light times the Hubble time; d_H= c/H_0 = 3000 h^{-1} \\\\text{Mpc} = 9.26 \\\\cdot 10^{25} h^{-1} \\\\text{m}.

Angular diameter distance: : d_A(z) = \\\\frac{d_M(z)}{1+z} Luminosity distance: : d_L(z) = (1+z) d_M(z) Light-travel distance: :d_T(z) = d_H \\\\int_0^z \\\\frac{d z'}{(1+z')E(z')} Note that the comoving distance is recovered from the transverse comoving distance by taking the limit \\\\Omega_k \\\\to 0, such that the two distance measures are equivalent in a flat universe.

Alternative terminology Peebles (1993) calls the transverse comoving distance the \\"angular size distance\\", which is not to be mistaken for the angular diameter distance. Even though it is not a matter of nomenclature, the transverse comoving distance is equivalent to the proper motion distance, which is defined as the ratio of the transverse velocity and its proper motion in radians per time. Occasionally, the symbols \\\\chi or r are used to denote both the comoving and the angular diameter distance. Sometimes, the light- travel distance is also called the \\"lookback distance\\". Details Comoving distance The comoving distance between fundamental observers, i.e. observers that are both moving with the Hubble flow, does not change with time, as comoving distance accounts for the expansion of the universe. Comoving distance is obtained by integrating the proper distances of nearby fundamental observers along the line of sight (LOS), where the proper distance is what a measurement at constant cosmic time would yield. In standard cosmology, comoving distance and proper distance are two closely related distance measures used by cosmologists to measure distances between objects; the comoving distance is the proper distance at the present time.  Proper distance  Proper distance roughly corresponds to where a distant object would be at a specific moment of cosmological time, which can change over time due to the expansion of the universe. Comoving distance factors out the expansion of the universe, which gives a distance that does not change in time due to the expansion of space (though this may change due to other, local factors, such as the motion of a galaxy within a cluster); the comoving distance is the proper distance at the present time. Transverse comoving distance Two comoving objects at constant redshift z that are separated by an angle \\\\delta\\\\theta on the sky are said to have the distance \\\\delta\\\\theta d_M(z), where the transverse comoving distance d_M is defined appropriately. Angular diameter distance An object of size x at redshift z that appears to have angular size \\\\delta\\\\theta has the angular diameter distance of d_A(z)=x/\\\\delta\\\\theta. This is commonly used to observe so called standard rulers, for example in the context of baryon acoustic oscillations. Luminosity distance If the intrinsic luminosity L of a distant object is known, we can calculate its luminosity distance by measuring the flux S and determine d_L(z)=\\\\sqrt{L/4\\\\pi S}, which turns out to be equivalent to the expression above for d_L(z). This quantity is important for measurements of standard candles like type Ia supernovae, which were first used to discover the acceleration of the expansion of the universe. Light-travel distance This distance is the time (in years) that it took light to reach the observer from the object multiplied by the speed of light. For instance, the radius of the observable universe in this distance measure becomes the age of the universe multiplied by the speed of light (1 light year/year) i.e. 13.8 billion light years. Also see misconceptions about the size of the visible universe. Etherington's distance duality The Etherington's distance- duality equation I.M.H. Etherington, ‚ÄúLX. On the Definition of Distance in General Relativity‚Äù, Philosophical Magazine, Vol. 15, S. 7 (1933), pp. 761-773. is the relationship between the luminosity distance of standard candles and the angular-diameter distance.

Other plants of note include Holodiscus microphyllus, Monardella cinerea, Eriogonum umbellatum, Oreonana vestita, Cycladenia humilis, and the rare, local yellow-flowered Peirson's lupine (Lupinus peirsonii). The area is occasionally visited by bighorn sheep and a rare mountain lion. Rocks in the area range in age from Pre-Cambrian (probable) igneous and metamorphics to Pre-Cretaceous metamorphics. The Vincent Thrust Fault, the oldest major fault in the range, dating to the Mesozoic, passes through the area.

Jones took the helm of Old Dominion basketball on April 3, 2013. He previously served as head coach of the American Eagles and the Virginia Cavaliers. Playing career High school Jones graduated from Apollo High School in Owensboro, Kentucky. He was inducted into the Apollo High School Hall of Fame. His father, Bob, is a former coach of Kentucky Wesleyan College, which he led to the 1973 NCAA Division II title. College He played point guard at the University of Virginia from 1978 to 1982. As a four- year starter at Virginia, Jones was known as a leader and prolific passer. During his playing career, the Cavaliers compiled an overall record of 102-28 (), while he led the Cavaliers to two NCAA Tournaments and two NITs during his career. Virginia captured the 1980 NIT title, and advanced to the NCAA Final Four in 1981. Jones finished his career as Virginia's all-time assists leader (598), and his 200 assists during the 1979‚Äì80 season was UVa's single-season record until both marks were later broken by John Crotty. Jones served as the team captain as a senior during the 1981‚Äì82 season and played in 129 games during his career. For his career, he averaged 6.6 points and 4.6 assists per game, while shooting 52.2 percent from the field and 74.3% from the free-throw line. Despite being drafted by the NBA's Indiana Pacers in 1982, Jones never played as a professional. He graduated from Virginia in the same year with a Bachelor of Science degree in Psychology. Coaching career University of Virginia After graduation he spent eight seasons as an assistant coach under Terry Holland at Virginia until tabbed the 8th head coach in Virginia Cavaliers history in 1990. He would go on to lead that program for eight seasons. He led Virginia to six postseason appearances (five NCAA, one NIT), one regular-season ACC Championship and four 20-win campaigns. He beat Roy Williams and #1 seeded Kansas in Kansas City to reach the Elite 8 in 1995. Jones' tenure in Charlottesville crested at that point; he only had one winning season in his final three years. He resigned at the end of the 1997-98 season, having spent the first 20 years of his adult life at UVa as either a player, assistant coach, or head coach. American University Following a brief stint as associate head coach at Rhode Island, Jones was hired as the head coach at American University in 2000. After the school moved from the Colonial Athletic Association, he guided American to the 2002, 2004, 2008 and 2009 Patriot League regular season championships, and in 2002 he was honored as the Basketball America Patriot League Coach of the Year. However, the team fell in the conference tournament title game each year from 2002 to 2004, failing to garner an NCAA tournament bid. On December 22, 2007, Jones led AU to its first victory over the University of Maryland in the last 80 years. Jones previously coached AU to victory over Florida State University, making him the only Patriot League coach to beat an ACC team. On March 14, 2008, Jones led AU to its first NCAA Tournament, as the Eagles beat Colgate 52‚Äì46. On March 22, 2008, Jones and the American University faced the Tennessee Volunteers at BJCC Arena in Birmingham, AL. Despite leading early on, American lost to Tennessee 72-57, ending American's NCAA trip. The next year, Jones led the Eagles into the 2009 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament on March 19, 2009. After holding a 14-point lead over Villanova early in the second half, the 14th-seeded Eagles let the game slip away at the end, falling to Villanova at the Wachovia Center. Despite being a #2 seed in the 2011 Patriot League Tournament, American was upset in the semifinal round, getting knocked off by Lafayette College in double overtime, 73-71.

Patients with SCA13 also tend to present with epilepsy, an inability to run, and increased reflexes. This cerebellar dysfunction is permanent and progressive. SCA13 is caused by mutations in KCNC3, a gene encoding a voltage-gated potassium channel KV3.3. There are two known mutations in this gene causative for SCA13. Unlike many other types of SCA, these are not polyglutamine expansions but, rather, point mutations resulting in channels with no current or altered kinetics. Signs and symptoms SCA13 is typified by early onset, mildly progressive cerebellar ataxia with accompanying dysarthria, mental retardation, and nystagmus. Symptoms and age of onset can vary slightly according to the causative mutation. Pathophysiology Mutations in KCNC3 are responsible for SCA13. This gene is expressed heavily in Purkinje cells, as is the case for some other SCA subtypes, where it is believed to play an important role in facilitating high-frequency action potential firing. There are two known mutations in this gene associated with SCA13. The first mutation, R420H, is located in the voltage-sensing S4 segment of the channel. As this mutation neutralizes a site important for voltage sensing, it is not surprising that it results in non-conducting channels. Neurons expressing such channels are unable to follow high-frequency input with adequate fidelity. The second SCA13 associated mutation, F448L, results in functional channels that have altered kinetics. The voltage for half activation of these channels (V¬Ω) is shifted 13mV hyperpolarized compared to wild-type. Deactivation of these channels is also slowed drastically compared to wild-type. This results in neurons with longer after-hyperpolarizations and thus, a decreased maximal firing rate. Diagnosis Treatment Prognosis There is no known prevention of spinocerebellar ataxia. Those who are believed to be at risk can have genetic sequencing of known SCA loci performed to confirm inheritance of the disorder.

Previous Births Maharaja Aparajit ruled over Susima town located in Dhatki realm in Purvavideh region in Vatsa country. He was a simple and religious person. He got detached after listening to the discourse of an Arihant and took diksha from Acharya Pihitashrava. As a result of long spiritual practices, he earned Tirthankar-nama-gotra-karma. Completing his age, he reincarnated as a god in the Graiveyak realm.  Biography as per Jain traditions  From the realm of gods, the being that was Aparajit descended into the womb of queen Susima, wife of the king of Kaushambi. One day, queen Susima had a desire to sleep on a bed made up of lotus flowers. As this was a desire of a pregnant mother, the gods made arrangements for its fulfillment. On Krishna Dwadashi (twelfth day of the waning fortnight) of the month of Kartik, the queen gave birth to a son. The new born had a soft pink glow like lotus flowers. The king named him as \\"Padmaprabha\\" (meaning one with lotus-like glow). In due course, the prince became young and was married. When his father left for spiritual practices, Padmaprabh ascended the throne. After a long and successful reign, when through his threefold knowledge he knew that the right moment has come, he became an ascetic. After six months of spiritual practices, on the full moon day of the month of Chaitra he attained omniscience under a banyan tree. Propagating right religion for a long time, Bhagavan Padmaprabh wandered around and at last arrived at Sammetshikhar.

With the approach of the Owens River aqueduct, and the possibility of intensive small farming, Los Angeles speculators, including Harry Chandler of the Los Angeles Times, combined to buy out Van Nuys in 1909 and develop the San Fernando Valley. Isaac Van Nuys was not the founder of Van Nuys in 1911‚Äîhe died in 1912‚Äîbut was made the honorary godfather of the hardscrabble town, later to be the Valley's center, by the development syndicate as a promise in the land sale. Still, as a pioneer resident and honorary godfather of Van Nuys, there are schools, streets, libraries, and a Liberty Ship with the name of Van Nuys. Biography Early life Isaac Van Nuys was born in West Sparta, New York, the son of Peter Van Nuys and Harriet Kerr. His father was born in Millstone, New Jersey, on February 7, 1808. He moved to West Sparta, in 1822, where he became a farmer and eventually owned . He also served as a town supervisor and justice of the peace. He died January 2, 1875. Their patrilineal ancestor was Auke Jans van Nuys, a Dutch carpenter who came to New Netherland around 1651 from Nuis, in western Groningen.[Stadsarchief Amsterdam DTB 461 p 412] The mother of Isaac Van Nuys was born in Cayuga County, New York, on April 13, 1809. Peter and Harriet were married on November 19, 1829. They had seven children, Caroline M. Van Nuys (born June 4, 1833); Isaac N.; A. Vinton Van Nuys (born June 8, 1840); Ella L.

He attended the academy at Lima, in which he was a student for one year. His relatives emigrated from the Netherlands and located on Long Island, New York. 1882 Van Nuys home of Isaac Newton Van Nuys. Career ;San Fernando Homestead Association In 1865, at the age of 29, Van Nuys was the first family member to move to California. He first lived in Napa, and later in Monticello where he owned a country store. In 1871, he moved to Los Angeles, where he bought in with Isaac Lankershim's corporation, the San Fernando Homestead Association, that in 1869 had bought the southern half of Rancho Ex-Mission San Fernando totaling 60,000 acres (240 km2) and engaged in the raising of stock, principally sheep. In 1873, Van Nuys, and future brother-in-law Isaac Lankershim's son, James Boon Lankershim, moved to the San Fernando Valley and assumed management of the property. In 1874, they began raising grain, introducing dryland farming. In 1876 they filled two ships with Valley wheat at the Los Angeles Harbor in San Pedro. It was both the first grain cargo shipped from the L.A. Harbor, and the first grain shipped to Europe from California. ;Los Angeles Farming and Milling Company In 1880, Van Nuys and James Boon Lankershim formed the Los Angeles Farming and Milling Company from the San Fernando Homestead Association. Isaac Van Nuys was its president and manager. The company had a four-story building for milling to produce flour, meals, cracked wheat, hominy and livestock feed. Van Nuys also served as vice-president of the Farmers and Merchants Bank, a director in the Union Bank of Savings, a director in the Los Angeles Pressed Brick Company, and owner of the Van Nuys Hotel erected in 1896 in Downtown Los Angeles. Signature of Isaac Newton Van Nuys. As the City of Los Angeles authorized building William Mulholland's Los Angeles Aqueduct from the Owens Valley to the city and valley, land speculation plans for the Los Angeles Farming and Milling Company property in the San Fernando Valley were developed. Aqueduct construction began in 1905, to be completed in 1913. Afterwards, land only useful for dryland farming could be turned into residential towns, and irrigated crops and orchards. ;Los Angeles Suburban Homes Company The Los Angeles Suburban Homes Company, in the \\"biggest land transaction ever recorded in Los Angeles County\\",Roderick, Kevin (2001) The San Fernando Valley: America's Suburb, p. 48, Los Angeles Times Books was a syndicate led by Harry Chandler, business manager of the Los Angeles Times, with Isaac Van Nuys, Hobart Johnstone Whitley, and James Boone Lankershim that acquired \\"Tract 1000\\" in 1909.

He was born to King Pratistha and Queen Prithvi at Varanasi on 12 Jestha Shukla in the Ikshvaku clan. He is said to have attained moksha at ≈öikharji on the sixth day of the dark half of the month of PhƒÅlguna.  Jain biography   Life before renunciation  Supar≈õvanƒÅtha was the seventh Jain Tƒ´rthankara of the present age (avasarpini). He was born to King Pratistha and Queen Prithvi at Varanasi on 12 Jestha Shukla in the Ikshvaku clan. There is temple dedicated to Suparshvanatha built in Bhadaini, Varanasi to commemorate the birth of Suparshvanatha. Nine months before the birth of Supar≈õvanƒÅtha, Queen Prithivƒ´ dreamt the sixteen most auspicious dreams. Supar≈õvanƒÅtha spent 5 lakh p≈´rva as youth (kumƒÅra kƒÅla) and ruled His kingdom for 14 lakh p≈´rva and 20 p≈´rvƒÅ·πága (rƒÅjya kƒÅla). Supar≈õvanƒÅtha was married and ruled after his father King Pratistha. He conducted affairs in state and looked after well being of individual.  Renunciation  According to Jain legends, When he observed tree leaves falling and flower wilting, he renounced his worldly life. He gave his kingdom to his son and became a Jain ascetic. After 9 months and then obtained Kevala Jnana (omniscience). After a many years of spreading his knowledge, he is said to have attained nirvana at Sammed Shikharji on the sixth day of the dark half of the month of PhƒÅlguna.  Disciples  According to Jain texts Balladatta Svami was the leader of the Supar≈õvanƒÅtha disciples and 20 lakh years he also achieved nirvana.  As a historical figure The Yajurveda is also said to have mentioned the name of Supar≈õvanƒÅtha but the meaning is different. It is an epithet of God which means \\"All-Pure Lord\\". The Mahavagga book of the Khandhaka (1. 22. 13), a Buddhist text, mentions a temple of Supar≈õvanƒÅtha situated at Rajgir in the time of Gautama Buddha. At Mathura, there is an old stupa with the inscription of 157 CE. This inscription records that an image of the tƒ´rthankara Aranatha was set up at the stupa built by the gods. However, Somadeva Suri stated in Yashstilaka and Jinaprabha Suri in Vividha Tirtha Kalpa that the stupa was erected for Supar≈õvanƒÅtha.  Adoration  Svayambh≈´stotra by Acharya Samantabhadra is the adoration of twenty-four Tƒ´rthankaras. Its five slokas (aphorisms) are dedicated to Tƒ´rthankara Supar≈õvanƒÅtha. Suparshvanatha is associated with Nandavarta (Dig.) & Svastika (Svet.) emblem, Sirisa tree, Varanandin (Dig.) & Matanga (Svet.) Yaksha and Kali (Dig.) & Santa (Svet.) Yakshi.  In literature  Supasnath Chariyam was compiled during reign of Mokkhal in 1422-23 at Dilwara.  Iconography  Suparshvanatha is usually depicted in a lotus or kayotsarga posture. Statues and paintings show his head shielded by a multi-headed serpent, fanned out like an umbrella. Serpent-hood iconography is not unique to Suparshvanatha; it is also found above the icons of Parshvanatha, the 23rd of the 24 tirthankaras, but with a small difference. Suparshvanatha's serpent hood has five heads, and a seven (or more)-headed serpent is found in Parshvanatha icons. Statues of both tirthankaras with serpent hoods have been found in Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, dating to the 5th to 10th centuries. Unlike Parshvantha who is depicted with coils of snake behind the body, Suparshva is depicted with snake hood only overhead. Suparshva's emblem of swastika is carved (or stamped) beneath his legs as an icon identifier.

It lies on a ridge connecting Lord's Seat and Graystones, but is rarely climbed. Alfred Wainwright did however accord it the status of a separate fell in his influential guidebook series, the Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells.Alfred Wainwright: A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, Book 6, The North Western Fells: Westmorland Gazette (1964): Topography The North Western Fells occupy the area between the rivers Derwent and Cocker, a broadly oval swathe of hilly country, elongated on a north-south axis. Two roads cross from east to west, dividing the fells into three convenient groups. The most northerly sector, rising between Whinlatter Pass and the Vale of Embleton, includes Broom Fell. Lord's Seat, is the highest of the fells north of Whinlatter and sends out a long ridge westwards. The ridge begins with a marshy depression before rising to the summit of Broom Fell. It then continues west to the more pronounced saddle of Widow Hause, beyond which is Graystones. Widow Hause, is densely forested on the southern side with the conifers of the Darling How Plantation. To the south of Broom Fell, is the pleasant valley of Aiken Beck, heavily wooded in its lower reaches. This secluded dale lies between the main ridge and Whinlatter Fell, draining to the west and ultimately reaching the Cocker. Hidden within the Darling How Plantation, is the fine waterfall of Spout Force. On the northern flank of Broom Fell, is Burthwaite Heights (1,043 ft), listed as a separate top in some guidebooks.Bill Birkett: Complete Lakeland Fells: Collins Willow (1994): This is a small hill beside the vast morass of Wythop. Wythop Moss itself lies to the west and drains (slowly) via Tom Rudd Beck. To the east of Burthwaite Heights, runs the valley of Wythop Beck, emptying rather more effectively between the twin hills of Ling Fell and Sale Fell. Geology The predominant rock, is the Ordovician Kirk Stile Formation of the Skiddaw Group. This consists of laminated mudstone and siltstone. To the south of the summit are outcrops of greywacke sandstone.British Geological Survey: 1:50,000 series maps, England & Wales Sheet 29: BGS (1999) Summit The top is grassy, and the summit is marked by the end of a wall coming up from Aiken Beck to the south west. Since this wall connects to no others, and simply stops at the highest point, its purpose in unknown. A summit cairn of approximately 2m in height now exists on the summit as does a small wind shelter made from part of the wall. The view southward, takes in the Whiteside-Grisedale Pike ridge and the Grasmoor fells showing behind. Westward, across the Vale of Lorton, are the Loweswater Fells, and to the east and north there are sightings of higher fells on either side of Lord's Seat. The coastal plain and Solway Firth are also seen to good effect. Ascents From Wythop Mill a crossing of Wythop Moss can be made, using the old path which gives the only remotely dry footing. Once the marsh is passed an ascent up the northern slope of Widow Hause leads to the ridge. The alternative is to make use of Aiken Beck, a car park being available near Scawgill Bridge on the Whinlatter Pass road. From the valley the southern slopes of Broom Fell can be tackled direct, or a longer route can be taken via the summit of Lord's Seat.

It is easily climbed from the top of the Whinlatter Pass, through the Forestry Commission plantations. The Whinlatter Visitor's Centre, a popular tourist attraction, is on the south side of the fell. The hill is part of a horseshoe around the valley of Aiken Beck. The fell's name originates from a combination of the Old Norse and Gaelic languages. With the Old Norse word 'hvin' meaning gorse or furze, and the Gaelic word 'lettir' meaning slope, the name translates as \\"The Gorse or furze-covered slope.\\".Place Names of the Lake District. Gives origins and translation of name. Topography The North Western Fells occupy the area between the rivers Derwent and Cocker, a broadly oval swathe of hilly country, elongated on a north-south axis. Two roads cross from east to west, dividing the fells into three convenient groups. Whinlatter is in the most northerly sector, rising between Whinlatter Pass and the Vale of Embleton. The hub of this group of fells is Lord's Seat, the highest point north of Whinlatter Pass. The main line of high ground runs east to west, taking in Barf, Lord's Seat, Broom Fell and Graystones, before petering out in the direction of Cockermouth. Lord's Seat however sends out a substantial additional ridge which starts southward, curves west and finally turns back north. This is Whinlatter, and the valley enclosed between it and the main ridge is that of Aiken Beck. The descending ridge from Lord's Seat has a number of tops along its length. First is Ullister Hill (1,722 ft) which is normally reckoned part of the parent fell.Alfred Wainwright: A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, Book 6, The North Western Fells: Westmorland Gazette (1964): Bill Birkett: Complete Lakeland Fells: Collins Willow (1994): The ridge then narrows at Tarbarrel Moss (1,617 ft), before rising again as it turns westward to arrive at Whinlatter Top, the summit. A final top, Brown How (1,696 ft) stands above the terminal descent to Aiken Beck. From Ullister Hill to Tarbarrel Moss the ridge line and both flanks fall within Thornthwaite Forest. All sides of the lower slopes of Brown How also form part of the Forestry Commission holdings. Depending on the stage in the planting cycle large parts of the fellside will therefore be clad in conifers at any one time. Access problems have now been resolved and the landowner welcomes walkers, many marked trails being available through the woodland. The southern boundary of the fell is formed by the Whinlatter Pass road. The summit of the pass lies south east of Whinlatter Top, marking the line of the Derwent-Cocker watershed. This falls from Tarbarrel Moss to the road, bypassing the highest point of the fell so that all of its waters flow to the Cocker. From the road summit Whinlatter Beck runs westward beneath the steepest face of the fell, Whinlatter Crag being a little below the highest point. To the north of Whinlatter is the quiet valley of Aiken Beck, its entrance neatly hidden in the woods between Brown How and Graystones. Its tributaries Willybrag Gill and Drycloff Gill drain the slopes of the fell. One wonders at the derivation of the former name. Aiken Beck and Whinlatter Gill combine to form Blaze Beck, a sizeable stream flowing into the Cocker at Low Lorton. Position of summit Alfred Wainwright in his influential Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells noted that Ordnance Survey maps of his time showed Brown How to be the summit, a statement he discussed at some length and proved to be incorrect by his own amateur surveying. Modern maps of the Ordnance Survey appear to have conceded the point. Geology In the summit areas of Whinlatter are rocks of the Loweswater Formation. This is composed of Greywacke sandstone turbidities.British Geological Survey: 1:50,000 series maps, England & Wales Sheet 29: BGS (1999) Summit Brown How bears a large circular hide or windshelter, whilst Whinlatter Top itself has only a modest cairn. The Lake District views are poor, except for the close-ups of Hopegill Head and Grisedale Pike across the pass, showing their full craggy glory on this side. Through Whinlatter Pass there is also a sight of the Helvellyn range and Skiddaw group. This is made up for by the northward views to the Solway Firth and the Scottish mountains beyond, best viewed from the westerly peak, Brown How. Ascents The easiest line is direct from the top of the pass, either up the side of the forest fence or snaking through the woodland along the forest roads. Brown How can be reached from Aiken, allowing a start from Scawgill Bridge on the western side of the pass. The full circuit of Aiken Beck, taking in Graystones, Broom Fell, Lord's Seat and Whinlatter is also a possibility.

It was formed in 1967 as a more moderate breakaway from the Australian National Socialist Party (ANSP). The NSPA was led by Ted Cawthron. History Cawthron and Frank Molnar launched the party in late 1967, explicitly rejecting the \\"jackbooted 'Nazi' image\\" associated with Arthur Smith's ANSP. They focused particularly on Smith's criminal convictions from a 1965 raid on ANSP headquarters. Although there were a number of attempts to reunite the two parties, the NSPA eventually attracted a number of other Australian national socialists disenchanted with Smith's leadership. In May 1968, Smith resigned as leader of the ANSP and his successor, Eric Wenberg, merged the ANSP into the NSPA. Wenberg was accepted into a leadership position in the party, alongside Molnar as chairman, Cawthron as director of publications, Les Ritchie, and John Stewart. Early in 1969, however, Cawthron and Molnar fell out, with Molnar accusing Cawthron of being a closet Bolshevist. Molnar was expelled from the party.Harcourt, pp. 31-32. In early 1970, the party's third congress in Canberra was attended by around 30 members. Later in the year, Cawthron became the first national socialist in Australia to run for public office, contesting the May 1970 ACT by-election.

The party also ran three Senate teams for the 1970 Senate election: John Stewart and Michael McCormick in New South Wales, Ken Gibbett and Kevin Thompson in Queensland, and Cass and Katrina Young in Victoria. The Queensland team won the first place on the ballot paper and benefited from the donkey vote and received over 10,000 votes (1.51%), while the results for the other teams were insignificant. The national NSPA vote was 24,017 (0.43%).Harcourt, pp. 36-39. Demise By 1972 the party was collapsing.

Jim Saleam, then only 17, was deputy leader of the party between 1972 and 1975, after Molnar was expelled from the party, under Cawthron's leadership.

It is done by inserting a needle through the skin below the external occipital protuberance into the cisterna magna and is an alternative to lumbar puncture. Indications for its use are limited. Subarachnoid hemorrhage and direct puncture of brain tissue are the most common major complications. Fluoroscopic guidance decreases the risk for complications. The use of this procedure in humans was first described by Ayer in 1920. This is an exceedingly rare procedure. When CSF cannot be obtained from the lumbar space (and when its analysis is considered critical to treatment), a cisternal tap may be required. The needle is placed in the midline, passing just under the occipital bone, into the (usually large) cisterna magna (Fig. 23-2). This is technically fairly easy; however, if the needle is advanced too far it can enter the medulla, sometimes causing sudden respiratory arrest and death. The test should therefore be carried out only by experienced physicians (usually neurosurgeons or neuroradiologists). An alternative route that may be used by neurosurgeons and neuroradiologists is lateral to C-1 with penetration through the large C-1 intervertebral hiatus. The cisternal tap may be used in myelography when the upper margin of a spinal block needs to be defined; however, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become the procedure of choice for defining the upper and lower limits of spinal cord or spinal cord-compressing lesions. It is necessary at times in the intrathecal administration of irritating medications, such as amphotericin B. Medications are diluted more rapidly in the larger and more rapidly circulating volume of cisterna magna than in the smaller lumbar sac.

It is dedicated to Mary, mother of Jesus, and is located on Piazza Capranica. The church is ancient ‚Äì it was restored by Pope Gregory III in the 8th century, and thus must have existed before then. One theory is that it was the titulus Equitii, though San Martino ai Monti is a more likely candidate. It is also referred to as Santa Maria della Visitazione, notably by Pope Urban VI in 1389. The origins of the name are nebulous; most attribute it to a corruption of the term a Cyro, perhaps referring in early days to a neighborhood resident. According to another theory Acyro refers to a corruption of the Latin word \\"circus\\", a stadium for horse racing, which was located in the vicinity. In 1540 Pope Paul III granted the church to the Confraternity of Orphans, and it was restored in 1588. Art and architecture The most important work of art in the church is a 14th-century painting, in the apse, of the Madonna and Child with St Stephen, attributed to the school of Pietro Cavallini. This painting and the funeral lapidary monuments in the vestibule are from the medieval church of Santo Stefano del Trullo, destroyed during the pontificate of Pope Alexander VII (1655‚Äì1667).

He was made a cardinal in 1998. Early years Cheli was born in Turin, Italy. He was educated at the seminary of Asti and soon developed his skills in canon law. At the Pontifical Lateran University in Rome he obtained his doctorate in that subject in 1942 and was ordained on 21 April of that year. Cheli returned to the parish of Asti and became diocesan vice-counselor of the Young Men of Catholic Action. Diplomat He prepared for a career in the diplomatic corps at the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy. He entered the Vatican diplomatic service in 1952. At first, Cheli had the minor role of attach√© of the nunciature in Guatemala and then in more important roles in Spain and Italy. He also did pastoral work in Madrid and worked for the Pontifical Council for Public Affairs from 1967 to 1973. He became Permanent Observer of the Holy See to the United Nations in 1973. By this time Cheli was known for his knowledge of the problems the Vatican encountered relating to the communist nations of Eastern Europe. On 8 September 1978, Pope John Paul I named him titular archbishop of Santa Giusta and gave him the rank of nuncio, though his title remained permanent observer. He received his episcopal consecration on 16 September. Roman Curia He was named Pro-Prefect of the Pontifical Commission for Migration and Tourism in 18 September 1986, and his title changed to President when it was reorganized as the Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerant People in 1988. John Paul II made Cheli Cardinal-Deacon of Ss. Cosma e Damiano in the consistory of 21 February 1998. On 1 March 2008, he was elevated to Cardinal-Priest. On 15 June 1998, he retired from his role at the Pontifical Council upon the appointment of his successor, Stephen Fumio Hamao. He continued to be outspoken in retirement. He criticized the rule excluding cardinals over the age of 80 from participating in a papal conclave. He told a journalist in December 2003: \\"It is a great deprivation for cardinals. Perhaps different limits can be used in future. Perhaps those whose minds have gone should not vote. We all know who they are. And some of them are in their seventies.\\" Behind the scenes he participated in a campaign in opposition to Pope Benedict XVI's appointments of Tarcisio Bertone as Secretary of State, believing Bertone lacked the requisite diplomatic experience. He was decorated with the Order of Isabel the Catholic and named commendatore of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic, and of the Verdienstkreuz of the Federal Republic of Germany. Cheli died on 8 February 2013 of natural causes, at the age of 94. His funeral was held on 9 February at St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City with Cardinal Angelo Sodano saying the Mass.

Titulus (Latin \\"inscription\\" or \\"label\\", the plural tituli is also used in English) is a term used for the labels or captions naming figures or subjects in art, which were commonly added in classical and medieval art, and remain conventional in Eastern Orthodox icons. In particular the term describes the conventional inscriptions on stone that listed the honours of an individualSmith, William (1875). \\"Nobiles\\". Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities. London. Reprinted by The University of Chicago. or that identified boundaries in the Roman Empire. A titulus pictus is a merchant's mark or other commercial inscription. The sense of \\"title\\", as in \\"book title\\", in modern English derives from this artistic sense, just as the legal sense derives from plainer inscriptions of record.\\"Title\\", Oxford English Dictionary. The most famous titulus was \\"IESVS NAZARENVS REX IVDAEORVM\\" - Jesus the Nazarene the King of the Judeans - inscribed on the placard hanging above Jesus' head on the Cross. Use in Western art The increasing reluctance of the art of the West to use tituli was perhaps because so few people could read them in the Early Medieval period, and later because they reduced the illusionism of the image. Instead a system of attributes, objects identifying popular saints, was developed, but many such figures in Western art are now unidentifiable. This reluctance affected the choice of scenes shown in art; only those miracles of Jesus that were easily identifiable visually tended to be shown in cycles of the Life of Christ. Thus the Raising of Lazarus and Wedding at Cana are by far the most commonly shown miracles, and the healing miracles, visually easy to confuse, are neglected.Schiller, I, 152‚Äì3M√¢le, 177 The problems can clearly be seen in the small scenes of the Saint Augustine Gospels (late 6th century), where about 200 years after the manuscript was written tituli were added, which according to some art historians misidentify some scenes.Lewine, Carol F.; JSTOR Vulpes Fossa Habent or the Miracle of the Bent Woman in the Gospels of St. Augustine, Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, Banderoles were a solution that became popular in the later Middle Ages, and in Northern Europe in the 15th century were sometimes used very extensively for speech, rather as in modern comics, as well as tituli. These were abandoned as old-fashioned in the Renaissance, but increased respect for classical traditions led to continued use of Ancient Roman-style tituli where they were considered necessary, including on portraits. Examples of tituli *In the context of the Crucifixion, the titulus \\"\\" (and its translations in Aramaic and GreekJohn 19:20) is believed to have been affixed to Jesus' cross. INRI is the abbreviation for the above- mentioned Latin translation.

Biography Paludanus was born in the County of Bresse, Savoy, about 1275. He entered the Dominican Order at Lyon, completed his theological studies at the University of Paris, and was made a Doctor and Master of Theology in 1314. Wishing to devote his life to teaching and writing, he avoided all offices of honour in the order, except those pertaining to the direction of studies. Twice, however, he was sent as definitor from the Province of France to the General Chapter. John XXII, wishing to organize a Crusade, sent him in 1318 as legate to the Count of Flanders, in the hope of establishing peace between the prince and the King of France. The mission was not successful, and his associates made charges to the pope against the legate, who, however, easily cleared himself. He was also a member of the commission appointed by John XXII to examine the writings of Petrus Olivi, whose books contained some errors of the Fraticelli.Denzinger, 484-91 There is an interesting account in TouronThe Catholic Encyclopedia states that 'About this time he wrote \\"De causa immediata ecclesiastic√¶ potestatis\\" (Paris, 1506) against John of Pouilly, whose errors were condemned 25 July 1321.'J. G. Sikes, ‚ÄúJean de Pouilli and Peter de la Palu,‚Äù English Historical Review, 49 (1934), 219‚Äì40. Modern scholarship, however, attributes the work to Guillaume de Pierre Godin (e.g. the 1982 edition of this work by William R. McCready).Denzinger, 491, 495 In 1329, the pope called him to Avignon, and consecrated him Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem. The same year, he journeyed into Egypt, to negotiate with the sultan for the deliverance of Palestine. The sultan was immovable. The accounts which the patriarch gave of the miserable condition of Palestine led to the announcement of another Crusade, but owing to apathy, and dissensions among the Christian princes, the project failed. Paludanus resumed his studies, composing at this time his commentaries on the Sentences of Peter Lombard, in which he combats Durandus of Saint-Pour√ßain. About 1332, he was appointed by the King of France to preside over the deliberations of a body of prelates and theologians whom Philip had convoked at Versailles to discuss the charge made against John XXII, of asserting that the souls of the just will not be admitted to the beatific vision until after the general judgment. The patriarch and his associates manifested consummate prudence in dealing with this matter. In a letter to the king, they declared: * their entire submission to the pope's authority, and their filial devotion to his person; * their belief, based on the testimony of trustworthy witnesses, that John XXII had not held, much less taught, the opinion attributed to him, but at the most, had mentioned it (recitando) and examined it; * that since the death of Christ the souls of the just with no faults to expiate immediately after death, and the souls of other just persons after complete purgation, are admitted to the beatific vision, which will endure forever. This doctrine was defined by Benedict XII, 29 Jan., 1336.Denzinger, 530 Besides the works mentioned, Paludanus wrote commentaries on all the books of the Bible, and \\"Concordanti√¶ ad Summam S. Thom√¶\\" (Salamanca, 1552).  Death  Peter Paludanus died at Paris, in his late sixties and was buried at the Couvent des Jacobins.

Qualifications In some jurisdictions building officials act as project engineer or project manager for the chief building official who is the jurisdiction's formally recognized building official. Usual qualifications are a bachelor's degree in Administration, Engineering, or Architecture, or Building Surveying or Construction Management, with an extensive building construction background, and in some instances are licensed as a Professional Engineer or Architect or Building Surveyors or Building Certifiers. Building officials can be certified. Australia Law Australian law is governed under individual state laws & territories generally made from state Acts & Regulations governing ... Qld, NSW, Vic, Tas, South Aust, West Aust, Nth Territory, Aust Capital Territory, various off shore islands & Aust protectorates within the 200 nautical mile limit of the Commonwealth of Australia. Town Planning & Development Concepts of planning & development are primarily approved under state Town Planning Acts & Regulations, which outline the procedures & protocols for various types of projects. Town Planning is a separate university degree discipline, which is usually guided by the interest of the general community & attempts to solve development problems. Individual project concepts are approved under Local Authority Codes which are generally Council Town Planners acting as the preliminary Assessment Authority to issue preliminary development approvals, or state bodies eg Transport, Main Roads, Port or Airport Authorities. Town Planners deal with expected community concepts, according to zoning principles ie residential land, high density living, city hubs, farm land, industrial areas, infrastructure, the safety of the natural environment & its natural resources. Building & Construction Australian Building law is governed under individual state laws & territories generally made from state Building Acts & Building Regulations Within the state Acts & Regulations, the procedures & protocols of preliminary approvals required are outlined, before a building development permit is issued by the Licensed Building Certifier or Building Assessment Manager for various types of projects. The Acts also detail time frame limitations, registration & licensing body requirements of building professionals, practitioners & trade contractors. Offences & penalties are also gazetted under the Acts for proven non-compliance with minimum requirements. Appeals of development decisions can be undertaken via state tribunals or state Planning Courts. Building officials, or regulators that decide if building applications for construction works can proceed, are called Building Surveyors or Building Certifiers. These officials are either employed by Federal, State or Local Government or more commonly in private practice companies. Building Surveying is a tertiary degree qualification & encompasses all aspects of construction from the concept stage to the finished building. The Architect, Designer, Builder or Owner engage the Licensed Building Certifier/Building Surveyor as the Building Assessment Manager, to regulate or manage a project, on behalf of the local authority (usually Council), generally after a preliminary approval is required, or to determine that a project meets all the relevant minimum Planning Code requirements, under the Building Certifier's guidance, or as part of a discretionary process. The Building Certifier interacts with all professionals & often the Senior trade contractors engaged within the building & inspects the works as they proceed, during mandatory inspection phases of footings, slab, frame, fire separation & final, to ensure compliance with the approved plans, the NCC & relevant Australian Standards. Building Surveyors or Building Certifiers are licensed by the state they practice in & have 3 different levels. Building Surveyors were first conceived after the Great Fire of London in 1666 in the UK, where their primary focus is the safe construction & use of the building concerning the life-health & safety of the occupants. Plumbing Works Plumbing works are generally approved & inspected at various stages, by the Local Authority (Council) Plumbing Inspectors who have a Hydraulic/Plumbing trade qualification & experience, to ensure public potable water safety, contain the spread waste-water products & regulate responsible ground water discharge. Larger infrastructure i.e. dams, pipe line networks, roadway drainage, flood mitigation works, etc, calls for a Civil Engineering background. National Construction Code (NCC) All state building acts & regulations refer to the minimum standards required within the Building Code of Australia (BCA), now the National Construction Code (NCC) since 2011, of which there are 3 volumes, which deals with individual aspects of buildings in categorised sections, based on the use (class), size of the building & type of construction, A, B or C, where Type C is the least fire resistant. Volume 1 - Buildings classes 2 to 9 - larger commercial buildings - ie 2 residential units, 3 motels, 4 caretakers residence in a larger building, 5 office, 6 shop, 7 warehouse, 8 factory, 9 public buildings eg schools, hospitals, etc. Volume 2 - Buildings classes 1 & 10 - smaller residential buildings ie 1A house, 1B small residential boarding house, 10A carport, 10B swimming pool. Volume 3 - Plumbing & Drainage - including fire fighting, gas, solar water heating, air con & on site waste water systems - for all buildings & external civil works. The NCC is up-graded bi-annually to consider new products, improvements or methods of construction, by senior officials of trade bodies, Institutes of Architects /Engineers / Building Surveyors, state officials & governed by the Australian Building Codes Board (ACBC). The NCC references individual minimum Australian Standards (AS- No.- Year of introduction) for each aspect of the type of contractor's work, or suppliers product, eg the minimum standard for Waterproofing of wet areas uses AS 3740-2004.

United States In the United States, there were three major nonprofit organizations developing building codes for the governing of building constructions, but they have since been merged into one in 1994, the International Code Council (ICC). ICC publishes the International Building Codes, used by most of the jurisdictions within the United States. The former organizations included Building Officials and Code Administrators International, Inc. (BOCA), International Conference of Building Officials (ICBO), and Southern Building Code Congress International, Inc. (SBCCI). There are several other major code publishers in the United States. The Uniform Plumbing Code (UPC) and the Uniform Mechanical Code (UMC) are both written by the International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials, also known as IAPMO, an organization that was established by code officials. On May 17, 1926, the International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials, or IAPMO, began with a mandate ‚Äúto advance the latest and most improved methods of sanitation; to promote the welfare of and harmony between the owner, the builder, and the craftsman; to accomplish a uniformity in the application of the provisions of the ordinances; and to promulgate the mutual benefit of the members.\\" IAPMO also publishes the Uniform Solar Energy and Hydronics Code (USEHC) and Uniform Swimming Pool, Spa and Hot Tub Code (USPSHTC) as part of their family of Uniform Codes.

Applicants wishing to carry out work controlled under the Building Act have the choice to select either the local Building Control or an Approved Inspector. However, where local legislation is prevalent the Approved Inspector will be charged with liaising with the relevant local authority body for the necessary approvals. The Secretary of State issues guidance in support of the Building Regulations in the form of Approved Documents which are not mandatory. The Building Regulations are functional and therefore designers are free to offer alternative solutions to satisfying the functional requirements. The burden of proof is then placed on the designers to demonstrate that the alternative solution proposed offers a level of performance which satisfies the intent of the functional requirement. There is nothing in the Regulations which imposes a duty on the applicant under those circumstances to use the guidance as a benchmark of performance, although this is of course a route often taken as a way of demonstrating that an alternative approach is of an acceptable standard. Appeals against decisions made by BCBs are to the Secretary of State who will make a determination after considering all of the facts of a particular case.

Methuen's three brigades were on their way to raise the Boer siege of Kimberley. A Boer force of about 2,000 men had entrenched on the range of Belmont kopje to delay their advance. Methuen sent the Guards Brigade on a night march to outflank the Boers, but due to faulty maps the Grenadier Guards found themselves in front of the Boer position instead. The Guards, the 9th Brigade and the Naval Brigade assaulted the Boers over open ground, suffering about 200 casualties. Before the British came to use their bayonets, the Boers retreated by pony and re-formed in another entrenched position at Graspan, where the pattern was repeated with the British suffering another 197 casualties: one sailor reporting that \\"at 200 yards we fixed bayonets, and we just saw their heels; they didn't wait when they heard the rattle\\".Agnes Weston: My Life among the Bluejackets, James Nisbett: London, 1909. Page 203  Background  In the first days of the Second Boer War, Boer forces besieged British garrisons at Kimberley and Ladysmith. A 40,000-strong Army Corps under the command of General Sir Redvers Buller was dispatched to South Africa and arrived in early November 1899. To relieve Kimberley and Ladysmith, Buller divided his forces, leading one division in an advance on Ladysmith, while the 1st Division of Lieutenant General Lord Methuen was tasked with breaking the Siege of Kimberley. Methuen planned to advance along the Western Railway from the Orange River to Kimberley, both in order to remain close to his supply line due to a lack of fresh water in the region and pack animals, and to utilize the railway to evacuate all civilians from Kimberley as ordered by Buller. Expecting little resistance, the march was undertaken without secrecy and no attempt was made to deceive the Boers as to its direction. After the arrival of the Naval Brigade with its 4.7-inch guns, it began on 21 November. Due to a shortage of cavalry, the British force was unable to conduct effective reconnaissance and thus were unaware of the Boer strength and composition, while the latter were appraised of the exact strength and composition of Methuen's force. As prior reconnaissance had located a Boer position slightly north of the Belmont station, from the march's starting point at the Orange River station, Methuen anticipated that the first fighting would occur there. Prelude Australian Mounted Rifles before the assault on Belmont As the British force departed Orange River station, the 9th Lancers and Rimington's Guides conducted a reconnaissance from Fincham's Farm of the Belmont area, spotting several hundred Boers climbing up a kopje. Methuen reached Thomas' Farm, south of Belmont, a day later, where his vanguard was fired upon by the Boers. The Boer fire ceased after British artillery began shelling them, and the British force bivouacked at midnight, anticipating battle in the morning. Without detailed reconnaissance, Methuen planned to focus the attack on the Boer positions running 100 ft above and to the east of the railroad, parallel to the railway line. These were Table Mountain and Gun Hill to the south. After capturing both positions, the British force would advance to the east against the other Boer line running parallel to the railway, which included Sugar Loaf Hill and Razor Back to the south and Mount Blanc, which, 100 ft higher than Table Mountain, dominated the region. Comparison of forces British The British 1st Division included the Guards Brigade of Major General Sir Henry Edward Colvile with the 3rd Battalion, Grenadiers, the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the Coldstream Guards, and the 1st Battalion, Scots Guards, and the 9th Brigade of Major General Richard Steele Rupert Fetherstonhaugh, with the 1st Battalion, Northumberland Fusiliers, the 2nd Battalion, Northamptonshire Regiment, the 2nd Battalion, King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry (KOYLI), and half of the 1st Battalion, Loyal North Lancashire Regiment. The two brigades totalled 7,750 infantry. The British cavalry force numbered a paltry 850 under Colonel Bloomfield Gough, and included the 9th Lancers, two and a half companies of mounted infantry, thirty New South Wales Lancers, and Rimington's Guides. Artillery support was provided by the 18th and 75th Batteries, Royal Artillery. Divisional troops included four companies of Royal Engineers, among other support units. Boer The Boer force at Belmont was led by Orange Free State Commandant Jacobus Prinsloo, who had arrived there with 1,500 men on the 20 November to reinforce an original force of 500 men under T. Van der Merwe. After Methuen began the march, Prinsloo posted detachments on the kopjes about the railway line. Prinsloo's force was joined by 800 men under Koos de la Rey on the day of the battle.

By the age of 12, he was already playing guitar in local reggae and rock bands. While learning the craft of music through listening to records by Jimi Hendrix, Ravi Shankar, Kraftwerk, Laxmikant Pyarelal and local Birmingham artists Steel Pulse and UB40, Diamond witnessed his first glance of a new musical hybrid and what was ultimately to become his life‚Äôs passion. In 1991, as production duo Simon and Diamond, the brothers launched the groundbreaking production fusion sound of dancehall reggae and bhangra with the artist Apache Indian. The project received huge public and media interest due to its cultural diversity and was making huge waves in the UK, USA, Canada and India.

Swami's follow-up album was So Who Am I on SonyBMG in 2005. The title track \\"DesiRock\\" embraced clubs the world over with DJ Swami‚Äôs unique left field electronic beats and anthemic bhangra melodies and reached even wider audiences in the EA Games FIFA World Cup 2006 video game as well as the UK movie Mischief Night (2006).

The first church in Rome to have a non- Italian titular was Santi Quattro Coronati: Dietrich of Trier was appointed titular in 975 by Pope Benedict VII. That basilica was originally Titulus Aemilianae, drawing its name in characteristic fashion from its foundress, who doubtless owned the extensive suburban Roman villa whose foundations remain under the church and whose audience hall became the ecclesiastical basilica.

It was co-written (with Daniel N. Rubin), directed and edited by Josef von Sternberg. The costume design was by Travis Banton. The film stars Marlene Dietrich, Victor McLaglen, Gustav von Seyffertitz and Warner Oland. Plot The story opens on the streets of Vienna, Austria in war torn Europe of 1915. The corpse of a prostitute is removed by the authorities from a tenement building in the red-light district ‚Äì a case of suicide. When a fellow streetwalker offers a word of sympathy, the concierge warns that she will suffer the same fate: \\"No I'm not. I am not afraid of life, although I am not afraid of death, either.\\" The Chief of Austrian Secret Service overhears the young woman's impressive remark. He is on the lookout for an attractive female to serve as a secret agent on a dangerous mission. He approaches her, and she invites him up to her flat, assuming the elderly man is engaging her for sex. The intelligence official poses as a foreign agent to test her loyalty. To his satisfaction, she quietly alerts a constable. The gentleman quickly establishes his credentials. The young prostitute, a Frau Marie Kolverer, is a war widow, as well as an accomplished pianist. She is very attached to her pet black cat. Invited to the central intelligence headquarters, the Chief explains that Austrian military forces are suffering terrible losses due to security leaks. He offers Kolverer generous compensation for her services and she declines them: her sole motivation is to serve \\"the cause of Austria.\\" Frau Kolverer is enlisted in the Secret Service as Agent X-27. Kolverer/X-27's assignment is to expose two suspected infiltrators within the Austrian Secret Service: General von Hindau, a native Austrian and turncoat and a Captain Kranau, a Russian intelligence officer. X-27 intercepts the officers at a Vienna masquerade ball and flirts with the suspected spies; both men become infatuated with her. Operationally, Austrian intelligence has instructed X-27 to lure General von Hindau to his private apartment. There, during the faux seduction, the Chief of Secret Service places a telephone call to Hindau, requiring that he briefly absent himself and leaving X-27 free to search his personal belongings; she cleverly tricks von Hindau into revealing his device for smuggling coded messages to the Russians: cigarettes. His cover blown, the General offers his compliments to X-27, retrieves his service revolver and kills himself. X-27 pursues Captain Kranau to the casino, but the Russian agent senses he is dealing with a dangerous agent. She is outmaneuvered by the Russian and he escapes. When X-27 reports her failure, she is ordered to disengage: the Captain \\"is too clever to be trapped by a woman.\\" The next phase of the operation requires X-27 to fly over the Polish border to infiltrate Russian headquarters. Her task is to acquire the timetable for an imminent Russian military offensive against the Austrian Army. Before her departure, Captain Kranau searches her bedroom and discovers her official orders. He empties her pistol of cartridges and disables the telephone before confronting her. They each drop their spy personas and confront one another's methods. Captain Kranau disparages X-27 for introducing her sexuality into her espionage: he feels it cheapens the profession. She accuses him of being a \\"clown\\" ‚Äì he treats the women of the demimonde as his personal harem. When X-27 attempts to delay him with a kiss, he flees rather than risk falling in love with a \\"devil\\". Behind enemy lines and accompanied by her black cat, X-27 disguises herself as a dimwitted peasant girl and gains employment as a chambermaid in the Russian officers' quarters. She quickly seduces a Russian senior officer, Colonel Kovrin, with liquor and sex play, and obtains the top secret plans for the attack, transliterating them into a musical composition for piano. Captain Kranau, who is stationed at the barracks, observes X-27's black cat stalking the hallway, alerting him to her presence. After a brief chase, he captures the disguised spy and seizes her music manuscript. When he performs the atonal piece on the piano, he realizes it is a code, and promptly burns the score, confident that he has thwarted X-27's mission. Kranau informs her that she will be put to death the next morning ‚Äì but discovers that he has fallen in love with her. They spend the night together, but X-27 drugs her Russian lover and manages to make her escape back to Austria. Unbeknownst to the Russian army command, X-27 had committed to memory the coded musical notation and she reconstructs the material. With the Russian secret plans in hand, the Austrians inflict a crushing defeat on the enemies' offensive. Thousands of Russian troops are captured, among them Captain Kranau. When Austrian Secret Service agents, with X-27 in attendance, examine the Russian prisoners, Kranau is matched to the dossier description of Agent H-14, and taken into custody. Agent X-27 pretends not to recognize him, but requests that she be allowed to interrogate the officer in private quarters ‚Äì ostensibly to extract valuable information from him before he is summarily executed. Loath to see her lover lose his life, she permits him to escape. Agent X-27 is immediately arrested. A tribunal is assembled for the purpose of convicting Agent X-27 of treason. She is sentenced to death. Kolverer, awaiting execution, makes two requests: that she be furnished with a piano in her cell, and that she be permitted to wear the clothing in which she served her countrymen, not her country - the clothing she wore as a streetwalker. Both are granted. In the courtyard standing before the firing squad, she declines a blindfold. After a short delay, due to a futile protest from a youthful intelligence officer, she is shot. Cast Production Sternberg based his \\"espionage melodrama\\" loosely on the exploits and demise of Dutch spy Mata Hari, with screenplay by Daniel Nathan Rubin.Kehr, 2012 Riche, 2008. The title \\"Dishonored\\" was conferred upon the film by studio executives over Sternberg's objections - \\"the lady spy was not dishonored, but killed by firing squad\\" - because it would distort the significance of the heroine's death.White, 2010.Sarris, 1966. p. 30 The movie was rushed into production by Paramount to capitalize on the critical and popular success of Sternberg's films The Blue Angel and Morocco the previous year, both of which starred Marlene Dietrich. Oscar-winners Lee Garmes (cinematography) and Hans Dreier (un-credited art direction) served on the film. M-G-M studios, alarmed by the competition that the Sternberg-Dietrich phenomena posed to star Greta Garbo, responded with the copycat Mata Hari the same year.Chicago Film Society, 2011 Riche, 2008 Sarris, 1966. p. 32 Production schedules, as well as some reticence on the part of actor Gary Cooper to work with the demanding director, prevented Sternberg from casting Cooper opposite Dietrich. His substitute, actor Victor McLaglen, was not as popular a co-star for Dietrich.Sarris, 1966. p. 31 Theme Sternberg's disdain for the strutting, medal-bedecked militarists and addiction to political intrigue is contrasted with the purity of a woman's feminine code of honor and \\"her love which transcends the trivial issue of politics.\\" Sarris, 1966. p. 31-32 White, 2010. In the following exchange the Court Officers pass judgment on the despised former spy X-27, \\"the only life-giving force in their midst\\"Sarris, 1966. p. 32 As film historian Andrew Sarris observes: \\"Yet it is Dietrich who ultimately passes judgment on her judges by choosing to die as a woman without a cause in a picture without a moral.\\"Sarris, 1966. p. 32  References   Sources  * Chicago Film Society.

Currently, she lives and works in California, teaches at California College of the Arts, and works with environmental art, as well as continuing in set design.Lauren Elder at the California College of the Arts Website Elder is known for being the sole survivor in the crash of a light airplane in the Sierra Nevada in the 1970s. 1976 plane crash On April 26, 1976, Lauren decided to take up an offer to be the third passenger in a Cessna 182P, tail number N52855, on a trip from Oakland International Airport in Oakland, California to Furnace Creek Airport in Death Valley's Furnace Creek. The 36-year-old pilot had 213 flight hours (46 on type) experience and was not instrument rated. He probably flew east, up Bubbs Creek and sought but missed Kearsarge Pass () through the Sierra. Instead he flew southeast into Center Basin, the eastern side of which is ringed by three peaks over tall (Mt. Bradley at , Mt. Keith at , and Junction Peak at ). Lauren Elder, sitting in the back seat and enjoying the view of mountains all round, turned forward to see a wall of granite moving towards them. When she woke up, she realized that they had crashed. The crumpled plane was lying on a precarious slope a few feet away from a ridge in California's Sierra Nevada at an elevation of , one-half mile south of Mt. Bradley. The pilot and one other passenger, sitting in the front of the airplane, survived the crash but died by the following morning. The evening of the accident, Elder could see the lights of the Owens Valley below, but miles of wilderness, elevation and sheer, icy cliffs separated her from it. She was wearing nothing but a blouse, a wraparound skirt, and boots with two-inch heels. One of her arms was fractured. The morning following the accident, with both her companions dead and with no real possibility of rescue, Elder decided to climb down from the mountain to the valley below. At one point it was necessary to lower herself down a 100-foot-tall dry waterfall. She suffered from hallucinations on the way because of lack of sleep and shock. Her descent took 36 hours. Finally, as Elder reached civilization, she had trouble finding help when she walked late that night into the town of Independence, California. People saw her disheveled appearance and were afraid; Charles Manson had recently been put on trial in the town, and his female followers spent a lot of time hanging around it. Lauren Elder wrote a book about the crash (with Shirley Streshinsky) entitled And I Alone Survived, which was later made into a TV movie with the same title,. as well as a documentary aired by the Discovery Channel. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) ruled the accident was caused by the pilot in command (PIC), who \\"continued flight into known areas of severe turbulence.\\" The NTSB also judged the PIC made \\"improper in-flight decisions or planning.\\" The National Park Service continues to remove pieces of wreckage from Elder's flight. There have been nearly a dozen private and military airplane crashes in the immediate vicinity.

It was constructed in 1822 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 as St. George's Church. The Rectory of St. George's Episcopal Church is an historic rectory located at 217 Peninsula Boulevard in Hempstead. It was listed on the National Register, in 1988. History Founded in 1702, the church was re-erected in 1734 to replace the original. However, its current edifice was built in 1822 following the second church's destruction. In 1735, it received a charter from King George II. During the American Revolution, Hempstead was a hotbed of British sympathizers or Tories, as they were known. The British attempted to occupy Hempstead after the Battle of Long Island and used St. George's as a headquarters as well as a place to worship. Local folklore has it that the rooster weather vane atop the steeple has sixteen bullet marks placed there by Hessian mercenaries who used it for target practice. American troops occupied the church for a period under Ezekiel Cornell from Rhode Island.

Erection (1734) On April 2, 1734, John Mott and Thomas Gildersleeve, by order of the town, set apart half an acre for a new church, west of the old one. At first, the church was only half pewed; there were eighteen pews, presumably square. The first pew was given to George Clarke, Secretary to the Governor, who lived in Hyde Park (the modern nearby village of New Hyde Park, which was then called Hyde Park){cite web website=Village of New Hyde Park url=http://www.vnhp.org/the-origins- of-new-hyde-park/ access-date=December 26, 2019 title=Origins of New Hyde Park } and was a benefactor to the church.

Along with him came: his son-in-law and daughter, the then-Secretary George Clarke, the Chief Justice Delancey, Reverend Vesey, some of the clergy, and a great many of the principal merchants and gentlemen and ladies of the City of New York. About six miles west of Jamaica, the Governor was met by the troops of horse, who escorted him to Jamaica, where dinner was provided for him and all of his company. In the afternoon, he proceeded to Hempstead, (escorted as before), where he arrived in the evening and was entertained by the Reverend Robert Jenney, St. George's minister. The next day, being St. George's Day, the regiment of militia and troops were drawn up on both sides, from Jenney's house to the church. The Governor, attended by some of the most prominent men in the county, walked to the church. There, a sermon was preached on the occasion, for an extremely crowded audience, by Jenney, from Psalms 115, verses 1 and 2. After the service, the Governor reviewed the regiment of militia and troops standing under arms and expressed his satisfaction on the appearance both of the officers and men. The Governor was afterwards entertained by Colonel Tredwell, commander of the regiment. In the evening, he was entertained by Colonel Cornwell, of Rockaway, in the same manner. :\\"The next day the Governor returned to Hempstead, pleased with the reception he everywhere met with from all ranks, with the extraordinary concourse of people from all parts on the occasion, and with the handsome appearance of the militia, both horse and foot.\\" --- New York Gazette A generous collection was made for the church on this occasion: The Governor gave the King's arms, painted and gilded; Secretary George Clarke gave a crimson damask set of furniture for the communion table, pulpit and desk; John Marsh gave a silver basin for baptism. The Rev. Mr. Vessey and his people had already contributed about ¬£50. St. George's Church today The Current St. George's The current building contains oak interior columns that were dragged across the Hempstead Plains by horse, then hewn and installed in the sanctuary. They span from ground to roof and show little sign of their great age. More than one of the beautiful stained glass windows was designed by Tiffany Studios, and the padded pew boxes hearken to days of old on Long Island when the well-to-do would arrive at church in park drag coaches to take their place in the front pew boxes.

Naming  Scottish naturalist Robert Mackenzie Johnston described the species in 1883 as Haplochiton sealii. Calling it the Derwent smelt, he observed that it appeared in numbers in the upper Derwent near New Norfolk in October and November. Allan Riverstone McCulloch placed it in the genus Lovettia in 1915, describing it from specimens collected by a Mr Lovett from the Derwent River. Originally named Tasmanian whitebait the species was renamed Australian whitebait following the discovery of a population in southern Victoria on the Australian mainland in 1993. It is the only species of its genus, Lovettia.  Description  L. sealii is a slender, spindle shaped scale-less fish that grows to a maximum length of 77 mm, commonly 65 mm. It has a long tubular body that is moderately laterally compressed. The head is long and slender with a high, large and silvery eye and a conspicuous, protruding lower jaw. The dorsal fin is high and begins above or just posterior to the origin of the pelvic fin. The caudal fin is forked with short, although distinct, peduncle flanges. The anal fin is longer than the dorsal fin and begins well posterior to the dorsal fin base. Pectoral fins are long and slender. The fish has a large, clearly visible swim bladder located below the spine just forward of the longitudinal mid-point, and an adipose fin on the dorsal surface above the anal fin. Juveniles and marine adults are translucent, usually with a lateral line not clearly marked by pigment. Fins are generally clear except for small dark spots on the caudal fin. Adults have a silvery mid-lateral stripe. Dark pigmentation increases in adults in estuaries to almost completely black following spawning, with males typically darker than females. The ventral surface of gravid females is yellowish.  Distribution and habitat Historically only known from eastern, northern and western coastal regions in Tasmania, in 1993 a population was discovered in the Tarwin River adjacent to Anderson's Inlet in southern Victoria. The total range of Australian Whitebait in the Tarwin River has not been fully investigated, however the presence of the species in Anderson Inlet itself was reconfirmed in 2007 and again in 2014, demonstrating long-term persistence of the mainland population. The habitat of Australian whitebait is poorly known. However, because of the anecdotal location of large schools of the species several kilometres to sea it has been suggested that adults inhabit primarily shallow coastal waters. Uniquely amongst the Galaxiidae, there does not appear to be a purely freshwater stage in the lifecycle of this species.  Lifecycle  Mature adult Australian whitebait enter estuaries and migrate upstream to just below the upstream tidal limit, where spawning occurs over successive days from August to December. At approximately one year of age, after spawning, virtually all individuals die, with less than 1% reaching two years of age and surviving to spawn for a second time. Rather than dying immediately after spawning, adults gradually deteriorate. In Tasmania, schools of spent L. sealii have been recorded upstream of estuaries, which suggests that adults outliving their first spawning might remain within river systems. Recent otolith microchemistry analysis suggests that Australian whitebait are a semi- anadromous, or an estuarine dependant marine species, as residence in pure freshwater does not appear to occur during the life-cycle.  Importance to humans  Australian whitebait form part of the whitebait harvest in Tasmania.  Conservation status  Although not listed under the Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 Australian whitebait has been listed as threatened under the Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988 and is considered Critically Endangered in Victoria by the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning's List of Threatened Vertebrate Fauna in Victoria ‚Äì 2013.

Doi, Abdul Rahman. (1995). \\"Ma»ôlahah\\". In John L. Esposito. The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Modern Islamic World. Oxford: Oxford University Press. It forms a part of extended methodological principles of Islamic jurisprudence (U·π£≈´l al-fiqh), and denotes prohibition or permission of a thing according to necessity and particular circumstances, on the basis of whether it serves the public interest of the Muslim community (Ummah). In principle, maslaha is invoked particularly in cases that are not regulated by the Qur'an, the Sunnah (the teachings and practices of the Islamic prophet Muhammad), or qiyas (analogy). The concept is acknowledged and employed to varying degrees depending on the jurists and schools of Islamic jurisprudence (maddhab). The application of the concept has been increasingly becoming important since the contemporary legal issues have arisen in the modern times. Overview The concept was first clearly articulated by al-Ghazali (d. 1111), who argued that maslaha was God's general purpose in revealing the divine law, and that its specific aims was preservation of five essentials of human well-being: religion, life, intellect, offspring, and property. Although most classical-era jurists recognized maslaha as an important legal principle, they held different views regarding the role it should play in Islamic law. Some jurists viewed it as auxiliary rationale constrained by scriptural sources and analogical reasoning. Others regarded the concept as an independent source of law, whose general principles could override specific inferences based on the letter of scripture. While the latter view was held by a minority of classical jurists, in modern times it came to be championed in different forms by prominent scholars who sought to adapt Islamic law to changing social conditions by drawing on the intellectual heritage of traditional jurisprudence. Along with the analogous concept of maqasid, it has come to play an increasingly prominent role in modern times, due to the need of confronting legal issues unknown in the past.. There are several other equivalent or analogous concepts in U·π£≈´l al-fiqh, some of each associated with respective maddhabs. The concept of maqasid (aim or purpose) is comparable in a sense that both connote the ultimate objective and goal of the application of the shari'ah. The concept of istislah is a related subject which is employed by Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal. While the meaning of maslaha is \\"public interest\\", the meaning of istislah is \\"to seek the best public interest\\"‚Äî the Sharia's object and purpose. The concept of istihsan means equitable preference for finding solutions to the legal issues. This term is used by the Hanafi school of law, and according to the understanding, it is possible to override the results of qiyas when it is considered harmful or undesirable. The term was also used by the Hanbali scholar Ibn Qudamah as well as the Maliki jurist Averroes. While the Shafi'i school does not recognize the application of maslaha as it may open the door to the unrestricted use based on fallible human opinions, they have a concept corresponding to maslaha which called istidlal, induced when it is necessary to avoid the strict application of qiyas. Usage Maslaha was used in one sense by the Andalusian lawyer al- Shatibi (d. 1388), who focused on the motivations behind the Islamic law. Regarding questions related to God, 'ibadat, humans should look to the Qur'an or the Sunnah for answers, but regarding the relationship between humans, mu'amalat, humans should look for the best public solution. Since societies change, al-Shatibi thought that the mu'amalat part of the Islamic law also needed to change. Maslaha has also been used by several Muslim reformers in recent centuries. Ibn Abd al-Wahhab (d. 1792) used maslaha in a few cases. The concept is more known to Islamic modernists. Among them, Muhammad Abduh is especially recognized for using the concept of maslaha as the basis for reconciling modern cultural values with the traditional moral code of Islamic law in the late 19th century. The Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamic fundamentalist group, also invokes maslaha to explain their commitment to public welfare.

The 2011 Census recorded the parish's population as 1,204. Manor King Edward the Confessor granted the manor of Launton to Westminster Abbey in 1065. The abbey surrendered the manor to the Crown when it was suppressed in the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1540, but in 1542 the Crown granted Launton to the abbey's Dean and Chapter. Mary I restored the Roman Catholic church in England so in 1556 Launton was surrendered to the Crown, who restored it to the reinstated abbott and convent of Westminster. Elizabeth I restored the English Reformation so in 1560 Launton was surrendered to the Crown for a third time, who again granted it to the Dean and Chapter. In 1649 the Commonwealth of England assigned Launton to Westminster School. In 1860 the lands of the Dean and Chapter of Westminster were vested in the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. The present manor house is 17th-century, with a court room that was re-ordered in the 19th century. Its farmyard has a 14th- or 15th-century barn of 10 bays with 17th-century roof timbers. It may have been a tithe barn. It is now a Grade II* listed building. Church and chapels Church of England The Church of England parish church of the Assumption of the Bless√©d Virgin Mary was built in the 12th century, and the four-bay aisles of its nave were added in the 13th century. Sources disagree as to whether the west tower is part of the original 12th- century church or a 13th-century addition. Originally the chancel had an apse, but in the 15th century this part of the church was reordered with a rectangular east end. The nave has a clerestory with 15th- or 16th-century windows. Some of the windows of the aisles are 16th-century. In 1891 a pair of flying buttresses designed by Reginald Blomfield was added to the west tower. In 1910 an Arts and Crafts-style screen designed by John Oldrid Scott was added to the south aisle. The church is Grade I listed. The bell tower has a ring of six bells, all cast by Gillett & Johnston of Croydon in 1907. The church has also a Sanctus bell that was cast in 1352. In the churchyard are the base and broken shaft of a 14th- or 15th-century stone churchyard cross. The ecclesiastical parish is now part of the Benefice of Bicester, Bucknell, Caversfield and Launton. Presbyterian chapel Launton had a Presbyterian congregation by 1772, when a meeting house was licensed for it. The congregation lapsed by about 1800, but was re-established by 1806.

Nettlefolds Ltd. was launched as a limited company in 1880 and the Nettlefold brothers went on to establish a dominant position the British wood-screw market through many mergers and acquisitions, becoming Guest, Keen and Nettlefolds, now GKN. In 1878 Frederick and his wife Mary Catherine moved into Streatham Grove (now called Norwood Grove), on its vacation by P&O; magnate Arthur Anderson. Their residence is now noted by a blue plaque. Frederick retired from Nettlefolds in 1893 and helped develop Samuel Courtauld's silk and crepe company. He also dedicated more effort to philanthropy; for example, he gave land for a library and endowed the Nettlefold Hall at West Norwood. He devoted much of his energy to the Unitarian Church, was president of the Sunday School Association and later the British and Foreign Unitarian Association, and was one of the main supporters behind the construction of the 1886 Essex Hall, the headquarters building for the denomination.The History of Essex Hall by Mortimer Rowe B.A., D.D.

In the Hebrew Bible (the Old Testament of the Christian Bibles), the Book of Ezekiel classifies the charging of interest among the worst sins, denouncing it as an abomination and metaphorically portraying usurers as people who have shed the borrower's blood., The Talmud dwells on Ezekiel's condemnation of charging interest.Baba Metzia 61b. The Torah and Talmud encourage lending money without interest. But the halakha (Jewish law) that prescribes interest- free loans applies only to loans made to other Jews. Jewish law allows making loans with interest to persons who are not Jewish. Rabbi Isaac Abarbanel, however, declared that the acceptance of interest from non-Jews does not apply to Christians or Muslims, as their faith systems are also Abrahamic and therefore share a common ethical basis. The biblical Hebrew terms for interest are neshekh (), literally meaning a bite, and marbit or tarbit (), which refers to the lender's profit. Neshekh refers to interest deducted in advance from the loaned money given to the borrower; the words marbit and tarbit refer to interest added to the amount that the borrower must repay.Peake's Commentary on the Bible. The words marbit and tarbit, for the form of interest most familiar in modern times, became ribbit () in modern Hebrew. The latter word is similar to the Arabic word riba used in the Quran. In the Bible The Torah expresses regulations against the charging of interest in the , and . In Leviticus loans themselves are encouraged, whether of money or food, emphasizing that they enable the poor to regain their independence. Like the other two places in the Bible, the charging of interest on the loan is forbidden. Evidently the concept of secured loans existed, as Exodus expressly prohibits using a particular garment as the security. The garment in question was a large cloth square, which the poor used for sleeping within, and so the garment was needed to survive the cold nights; if it had been offered as security, this would have put at risk the very life of the debtor. The Deuteronomic verse expresses a similar concern for the security of the debtor's life but rather than prohibiting a particular garment from becoming the security for a loan, it prohibits instead the use of a millstone. The millstone was used to make flour, and hence would be required for the manufacture of bread, a staple food among the poor; if the millstone had been offered as security, the debtor would have been at risk of starvation. Historical context Most early religious systems in the ancient Near East, and the secular codes arising from them did not forbid usury. These societies regarded animate matter as alive, like plants, animals, and people, and it was considered capable of reproducing itself. Hence, if one lent \\"food money,\\" or monetary tokens of any kind, it was legitimate to charge interest.Fritz M. Heichelheim, An Ancient Economic History, 2 Vols. (trans., Leiden 1965), i104-56.Cited in Johnson, A History of the Jews, p.172 Food money in the shape of olives, dates, seeds or animals was lent out as early as c. 5000 BC, if not earlier, and records indicate rates of 10‚Äì25 percent for silver and 20‚Äì35 percent for cereals. Among the Mesopotamians, Hittites, Phoenicians and Egyptians, interest was legal and often fixed by the state. Among the Sumerians, loans were usually given with interest attached, at the rate of 20% per annum; this interest rate is almost always the one stated in surviving Sumerian contract tablets and was evidently still well known in first century Judaism, as it is the first interest rate to which the Babylonian Talmud refers.Baba Batra 60a A more mutually profitable arrangement existed in Sumerian law, by which a lender and a debtor make contractual arrangements to become partners in a business venture, with the lender agreeing to invest in the venture, and the debtor agreeing to manage the venture; the bond thus has characteristics of both a loan and a trust, as the lender's financial share in the venture is effectively the return on the loan, and the debtor's financial share in the venture is effectively a wage. The Code of Hammurabi contains regulations attempting to govern the use of these contracts. In classical rabbinical literature The Mishnah carefully tries to prevent evasion of the scriptural injunction against usury, preferring to forbid moral usury to trying to mitigate the scriptural rules in this area. According to the Talmud, the debtor would be as guilty as the lender, since it interprets one of the biblical verbs referring to usury, namely tashshik, to be in the causative voice; due to the Talmud's figurative interpretation of the lifnei iver regulation, it even regards any witnesses to usury contracts, as well as the scribe writing the contract for the parties, to be as culpable for usury as the lender and debtor themselves. The Mishnah states that it is not permissible to withhold the whole of something such as a field, for which part of the selling price has already been paid, because any income arising from possession of the entity would effectively be interest on the outstanding amount. However, the Mishnah does permit the refusal to hand over something for which only partial payment has been received if it had been sold on the terms that payment would be made by a certain date and that date has passed;Baba Metzia 63a in English Law, the mortgage was invented to take advantage of this exception. If witnesses support a claim that it had been agreed to repay a debt by a certain date, but they are proved to be lying and the correct repayment date to be a different date, according to the Mishnah, the false witnesses must pay the amount accrued due to the difference in value of the thing between the two dates.Makkot 1:1 The Mishnah forbids the drawing of interest and dividends from investments, arguing that people should instead buy land and draw income from it. The Mishnah also counts gifts, which aim to encourage the offering of loans, to be a form of interest, paid in advance; similarly, gifts given in thanks for a loan, are another form of interest, according to the Mishnah, even if the loan is repaid when the gift is offered. It even goes so far as to forbid the loaning of things other than money since by the time the loan had to be repaid, the market value of the loaned thing could have risen, which effectively constituted interest;Baba Metzia 75a likewise, the exchange of labour between two individuals was forbidden by the Mishnah, if the work by one of the individuals would be more laborious than the other. According to the Mishnah, if a debtor has paid interest to his lender, it can be reclaimed if it is a form of interest explicitly prohibited by the biblical regulations but not if it is prohibited only by the Mishnah itself; a dissenting view is, however, expressed by the Mishnah, stating that even the biblically prohibited forms of interest cannot be reclaimed legally. The Mishnaic justification given for the latter view is that the biblical text invokes divine vengeance against usurers, and civil action cannot be launched against someone under the penalty of death;Baba Metzia 61b effectively this meant that rabbinical courts made judgements in cases of usury but refused to enforce them by anything other than physical attacks against the lender's body.Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah : 161:2 Exemptions and evasions The Mishnah forbids arrangements where a supplier gives a product to a shopkeeper to sell in return for a portion of the profit, since it views the supplier as effectively loaning the product to the shopkeeper, while ignoring the fact that the shopkeeper takes on the risk of theft, depreciation, and accidents. However, the Mishnah argues that it would not be counted as usury if the supplier employed the shopkeeper to sell the product, even if the wage was merely nominal, such as a single dry fig;Baba Metzia 68b this mechanism to permit profit being gained by a lender, in a business transaction between lender and debtor, was formalised as the Heter Iska, literally meaning exemption contract, which worked in exactly the same way as the earlier Sumerian business partnership contract between lender and debtor. Like all contracts, there are sometimes disputes, and the parties may resort to secular courts, running the risk of the court imposing interest, or other conditions which are contrary to Halakhic principles. There were also a number of methods of evading the anti-usury laws completely, identified in the Mishnah. One of the simplest methods was for a person to lend something to another and buy it back from them at a reduced price (the purchase, of course, is independent of the loan); the Mishnaic regulations do not prevent the lender from requiring the full value of the loaned thing to be returned and so allows the lender to make a profit from the difference between the reduced price and the actual worth of the loaned thing. Another significant loophole in the law was the biblical permission to charge interest on loans to non-Israelites, since this made it possible for an Israelite to charge interest on a loan to another Israelite, by making the loan through a third party who was not an Israelite; interest could be charged on the loan to the non-Israelite, who could then loan the money to the other Israelite at a similar rate of interest.Baba Metzia 5:6Baba Metzia 71a In rabbinical literature of the Middle Ages In the view of Maimonides, there were certain conditions similar to interest which were permitted; for example, Maimonides states that a person can offer money to a second person attaching a requirement for the second person to give a certain larger amount of money to a third person, or a requirement for the second person to persuade a third person to lend a certain larger amount of money to the first person.Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, Tamid:, Malweh:15 When a non-Jew was involved, Maimonides argues that interest could be charged; indeed, Maimonides argues that it was compulsory to charge interest on loans to non-Jews, but he also suggests that such loans should be restricted to being within narrow limits, to avoid the lender becoming so keen on usury that they practice it against other Jews. The Shulchan Aruch, a 16th-century text that was published after the writings of Maimonides, and which is viewed by the majority of Orthodox Judaism as being authoritative, expresses a different view on interest, stating that it is now allowable (when it was written) to lend on interest to non-Jews.Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah : 159 This text also records an exemption from the additional rabbinic restrictions for charities, such as orphans or poor-funds. Similarly, it allows the borrowing of money on terms involving interest repayments when a life is in danger.Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah : 160 In the opinion of the Shulchan Aruch, it is only the return of the capital part of a bond that is enforceable: if it covers the interest separately, the interest part is not enforcible, and if it combines the interest and capital into a single sum, the whole bond is unenforceable;Shulchan Aruch, Hoshen Mishpat : 52 similarly, the Shulchan Aruch argues that if a guardian lends something belonging to their ward, and has charged interest on it, the ward may keep the interest and is not obliged to return it. The Shulchan Aruch even states that the courts can compel the restoration of interest only by flogging the lender until they are willing to return the amount, known as contempt so if the lender died before the interest was returned, the lender's heirs were allowed to keep the money.Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah : 161 See also *Prozbul (a Jewish writ expanding protections of both borrower and lender) *Shmita (seventh/last year of the Jewish agricultural cycle after which debts were forgiven) *Yovel (\\"Jubilee\\" year at end of seven agricultural cycles) References Further reading * External links * The prohibition that a Jew should not charge a Jew interest on a loan and the practicality of this prohibition in a modern world, three answers by Rabbi Samuel Barth, Rabbi Richard Wolpoe, and Rabbi Laura Geller * Interest-Free Loans - The greatest form of charity, on chabad.org Category:Jewish courts and civil law Category:Credit Category:Usury ","title":"Loans and interest in Judaism"},{"id":"8066525","text":"is a video game in the Bomberman series. It was released on the PC Engine on December 11, 1992 in Japan, with western TurboGrafx-16 releases following in 1993. The game has been re-released for the Wii & Wii U Virtual Console, with full multiplayer capability intact, in North America, Europe and Australia. Bomberman '93 later spawned a sequel titled Bomberman '94. Story Black Bomberman has stolen seven chips from the pan-galactic bureau's mother computer and scattered them across several planets of the Magellan solar system. It is up to the ace detective Bomber Cop, aka White Bomberman, to recover them. Gameplay The gameplay consists of the same basic structure as the previous games in the series. The player controls Bomberman by moving him around block filled mazes and laying down bombs. The bombs erupt into a cross-shaped explosion several seconds after being set. The explosion can destroy any blocks or enemies in its path, as well as Bomberman himself. If the explosion touches another bomb, the second bomb will instantly explode as well. This basic formula is used in both the single player and multi-player modes. Single-player The single player game consists of seven themed worlds, each containing eight stages. Each stage consists of a block filled maze, with enemies scattered throughout it. Using bombs, the player must destroy the blocks in their path and defeat the enemies. Once all of the enemies are defeated, the portal to the next stage opens. Powerups are hidden beneath certain blocks, which can give the player increased bombs and firepower, as well as useful abilities like being able to kick bombs. The eighth stage of each world is a boss battle. The game differs from previous games in the series in that the stages are more interactive, with devices such as conveyor belts and teleporters appearing in certain areas. This mode utilizes a password system or there is limited save memory if the player in question wants to save. Battle Mode Multiplayer The multiplayer mode allows up to five players to compete against one another in a timed deathmatch. Each player attempts to collect power-ups in order to destroy the competing players while staying alive. The last Bomberman alive wins the round. Unlike the single player game, some blocks contain skulls instead of power-ups. These are detrimental if picked up. There are multiple stages to choose from in this mode, with each having its own theme and gimmick. The Virtual Console version of the game supports only 4 players using Wii Remotes. The 5-player mode can be activated by holding the R button on an attached GameCube controller while starting the game from the Wii menu. Reception Bomberman '93 was awarded Best TurboGrafx-16 Game of 1993 by Electronic Gaming Monthly.

Synopsis In the wild and isolated wilderness of the Tasmanian highlands, Ruby Rose is overcome by her fear of darkness. Ruby cries out to the elemental spirits that surround her. She is driven to take a harrowing journey out of the mountains to seek help from her lost grandmother. Production As the title indicates, the film centres on Ruby and her complex emotions. The character is based on a story told to Roger Scholes by an old woman, Mrs Miles of Mole Creek Valley. As a young woman, she had lived alone in a hut in the Highlands for four years, without knowing that her husband had died while trying to get back to her in the middle of winter. The experience traumatised her. Scholes was also interested in the na√Øve art created by a people with mental disturbance or trauma, and its similarities with prehistoric art (he studied case histories as a student in Melbourne). That is why Ruby fills notebooks with her own drawing. She is much younger than Henry, and she was traumatised as a child. She has created her own cosmology, based on fear and observation of the natural world. She feels safe only in the day. When Henry and Gem go off trapping for days on end, she is alone with her fears in the hut. She identifies the colour white with the sun, warmth and light; that is why she uses flour to make her face white. By this stage in the movie the audience is fully aware of Ruby's mental instability and her terror of the dark. That is why her journey is so remarkable: to be out after dark requires a supreme act of will. Roger Scholes was interested in the way that isolation had shaped women's lives in this region. In the late 1970s, when he was researching, he met and photographed many people who had lived all their lives in the harsh environment of the Tasmanian Highlands. He was preparing a book, based on the interviews and photographs, but it was never completed. He decided to turn the material into a feature film instead. The Tale of Ruby Rose was his first and is still his only feature film, although he has developed a number of other projects. Scholes has concentrated largely on documentary since this film. Release The film was screened widely at festivals throughout the world.

His noble parentage is known to us through the manuscript memoir of Grasset, a Celestine monk of the seventeenth century (Discours g√©n√©alogique de la noble maison de Bertrand et de leur alliance avec celle de Colombier). The legal profession seems to have been the first aim of his education. He successively studied and taught law in the Universities of Avignon, Montpellier, Orl√©ans, and Paris. A highly competent lawyer, he soon reached high positions in the Parliament of Paris, the King's Council, and the Queen's Chancery. His interests lay, however, in another direction, and he became a priest. His priestly career was as successful as his legal success. In rapid succession he was Dean of Puy-en- Valais, Bishop of Nevers, and Bishop of Autun. In 1331 Pope John XXII made him a cardinal. Among his services were several charitable institutions founded at Annonay, and the Coll√®ge d'Autun, or Coll√®ge Cardinal, established in Paris on behalf of fifteen poor students, five for theology, five for law, and five for the fine arts. Bertrand defended the rights of the Church both by word of mouth and with his pen. Fournier, in his \\"Officialiti√©s du moyen-√¢ge\\" (Paris, 1880), points out, at the beginning of the Valois dynasty, a strong tendency of the State towards curtailing the Church's traditional rights. In 1329 took place the famous Conf√©rence de Vincennes, where Pierre de Cugnieres, speaking for Philippe de Valois, bitterly complained of undue extension of ecclesiastical privileges (e.g., ordaining clerics for the sole purpose of enjoying the privilegium fori; causes des veuves, or widow's causes drawn to ecclesiastical courts; the free use of censures to enforce the Church's privileges; appeals to the Church from the decision of civil courts, etc.). Pierre Bertrand, then Bishop of Autun, was the principal spokesman of the clergy. He replied in a spirit of conciliation to all charges bearing on minor points, but strongly upheld what he considered the essential rights of the Church. Following on the lines of the Bull Unam Sanctam of Boniface VIII, he summed up his plea in four statements: # the secular power is from God; # yet, it is not by itself enough for the government of the people, for which spiritual jurisdiction is also required; # although nothing prevents the two powers from being in the same hands; # still, whether in the same or different hands, they stand in a certain relation of subordination, the spiritual power being the higher of the two. His views are to be found in Libellus adversus Petrum de Cugneriis and De origine et usu jurisdictionum published in Paris in 1495 and 1584 respectively, and later inserted in volume XIV of the Magna Bibliotheca Veterum Patrum (Cologne, 1618). Other writings of Cardinal Bertrand (apologetical, canonical, pastoral) have not been published, and are reported to be in the Vatican Library. Bertrand died at the Priory of Montaud, near Avignon.

The tradition originates from Dorman's more rural placement and students as opposed to Spartanburg High School's traditionally more urban and affluent students, who would refer cajolingly to Dorman students as \\"farmers.\\" Students typically take their vehicles \\"mudding\\" or \\"mud-slinging\\" in the days before the game in an outward display of rural pride and proclivity and wear overalls to school to celebrate a culture rooted in farming. School officials typically accommodate the observance of these activities by, for example, providing alternate parking for muddy trucks. In 2009, Dorman defeated Byrnes High School 2817 for the South Carolina State Championship in football.

Fine arts The high school has three theater classrooms and five different drama courses.  1985 hostage incident  On March 29, 1985, a fifteen year old freshman came to school with a loaded .38-caliber Colt revolver. Then teacher, Ms. Peggy Larson, who taught algebra, suspected one of her students of drinking and attempted to take him to the school's principal's office. The student then broke away, fled out a side door to his home. This student then returned to the school later the same day with his gun, and held four students hostage inside a classroom. The incident lasted until a local pastor stepped into the classroom to talk down the student. The student was arrested, charged with four counts of kidnapping, and was then sent to Columbia, for a psychological evaluation. After that, the student was then sent to then Spartanburg General Hospital, now called Spartanburg Regional, psychiatric's unit. After being released, the student was placed on probation until his 21st birthday, as well as being barred from being on school grounds, or intimidating the victims of this incident. Due to the student's age, as he was a minor, his name was not released.

It was adapted by Guy Bolton and Russell Medcraft from the play Angyal by Melchior Lengyel. The music score was by Frederick Hollander, Werner R. Heymann and John Leipold with additional music by Gioacchino Rossini from The Barber of Seville. The cinematography was by Charles Lang and the costume design by Travis Banton. The film was distributed by Paramount Pictures. The film stars Marlene Dietrich, Herbert Marshall and Melvyn Douglas with Edward Everett Horton, Laura Hope Crews and Herbert Mundin. Plot The story describes a love triangle initiated by Lady Maria Barker (Dietrich), the comfortable but neglected wife of Sir Frederich Barker (Marshall), a top-level British diplomat in the pre-World-War-II era. Although Frederick provides well for Maria and appears to love her, he has been neglecting her in favor of pursuing his busy diplomatic career. One day when he is in Geneva on important business, she secretly flies to Paris to visit the Russian Grand Duchess Anna, who operates a high-class escort business. By chance, Maria happens to meet Anthony Halton (Douglas), a charming man who has lived in India for several years. Although Maria insists that their liaison remain anonymous, they are attracted to each other, and they have a brief tryst, during which he calls her \\"Angel\\". Intending to have only a simple fling, she tries to end the relationship by leaving him without saying good-bye. However, he has fallen in love with her, and he begins searching for her. Maria manages to avoid being seen by Halton at a horse race, but Halton happens to meet Frederick at a social gathering, and the two of them make plans for Halton to have lunch together with Frederick's wife, whose identity is heretofore unknown to Halton. Unable to avoid Halton any longer, Maria pretends not to recognize him when he arrives. In a moment when Maria and Halton are alone together, she makes it clear to him that she has no interest in continuing their relationship and that she considers his presence a threat to her marriage and her reputation. Still in love with her, he offers to meet her in Paris the following week, but she refuses. Meanwhile, tickets have arrived for the vacation to Vienna that Frederick promised Maria earlier. However, he breaks his promise to her when an opportunity arises for him to go to Geneva again for work. Frederick's mistreatment of Maria is emphasized by his decision to go to Geneva despite Maria's obvious enthusiasm about the vacation and the fact that the Geneva trip was originally assigned to one of Frederick's capable assistants. Disappointed by this setback, Maria changes her mind about meeting Halton again, and she asks Frederick to drop her off in Paris on his way to Geneva so she can go shopping. Frederick agrees to this plan despite the fact that he has discovered the affair. However, instead of continuing to Geneva, he goes to the Grand Duchess' salon to investigate. In a last-ditch attempt to save her marriage, Maria confronts Frederick in the salon and makes it clear to him that she needs more attention. She claims that Angel is another woman who is in an adjoining room, but asks him to believe her without looking in the room himself. Her hope is that he will save her reputation by accepting her word but will spend more time with her in the future. This plan fails as Frederick enters the other room, which is empty, but he proposes a better solution. Finally understanding that he has taken Maria for granted, he humbly offers to cancel his business trip and meet her at the train station to go to Vienna, allowing her to decide whether they will stay together. As he leaves the salon, she immediately catches up to him, and they walk out together to begin their vacation.

Cardinal Ernest Simoni took possession of the titular church on February 11, 2017. History Sta. Maria della Scala The church Santa Maria della Scala is located on the square of the same name. It was built under the patronage of Pope Clement VIII between 1593 and 1610 to house a miraculous icon of the Madonna. Tradition holds that a midwife with an almost dead child in her arms prayed under the stairs of a house where the image of the Madonna was present, and the child immediately revived.Sponzilli, Osvaldo. \\"Visit the Pharmacy of Santa Maria della Scala\\", Rome Central, February 14th, 2018 Consecrated to Mary, mother of Jesus, the church enshrines that icon in the north transept, alongside a baroque statue of St John of the Cross. The church was built on the site of a house once bequeathed to a Casa Pia founded by Pope Pius IV in 1563 for reformed prostitutes. The church was later granted to the Italian Discalced Carmelites. Around 1600, the friars built a monastery next door famous for containing the Papal court's 17th century pharmacy (its furnishings and equipment have been preserved). The friars prepared their medicines with herbs from the attached garden. In 1650, nearly fifty years after the buildings completion, Carlo Rainaldi designed for the church a tempietto-shaped baldachino with 16 slender jasper Corinthian columns and a high altar. In 1849, during the last stages of the revolutionary Roman Republic's resistance to the invading French forces, Santa Maria della Scala was used as a hospital where Garibaldi's soldiers, wounded in the Trastevere fighting, were treated. Artworks Interior Its choir, nave and north transept's vaults are decorated with paintings intended to resemble moldings, whilst the south transept has actual stucco relief moldings, an altar, and a relic (one of her feet) of St Teresa of Avila. Death of the Virgin by Carlo Saraceni. The interior has a nave with three chapels on each side. Lawyer Laerzio Cherubini had commissioned a painting from Caravaggio suitable as an altarpiece for a chapel of Santa Maria della Scala. This was the Death of the Virgin. Rumors held that Caravaggio had used a prostitute as a model for the dead virgin. The Carmelites rejected the painting, which was then purchased by Vincenzo Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua. When Caravaggio's \\"Death of the Virgin was rejected\\" in 1606 as, it was Carlo Saraceni who provided an acceptable substitute, which remains in situ. The church also contains The Beheading of St. John the Baptist by the Dutch painter Gerrit van Honthorst, and Giovanni Odazzi's Dream of Joseph. San Giuseppe Hall houses a collection by Tito Sarrocchi.

About the circuit  The circuit was originally built inside a dis-used reservoir and operated by Claude Roe and Les Marshall in 1952 utilizing the site of a former reservoir, before opening for the first time in 1954. Due to failure in business, Roe and Marshall decided to abandon their plans for Hednesford Raceway and close down in 1955. Following the closure of Tamworth Stadium in 1961, would-be promoter Bill Morris acquired the defunct Hednesford circuit and ran a handful of so-called 'practice meetings' in 1962. Bill Morris fully re-opened the circuit in April 1963 and from that point onwards the promotion of Stock Car and Hot Rod racing has been uninterrupted at the popular Staffordshire speed-bowl for over half a century. The shale oval was eventually resurfaced with asphalt in 1982, enabling lap times to fall drastically and track records to tumble. It is even said that four times World Hot Rod champion Carl Boardley once got the quarter mile down to almost 12 seconds in unofficial practice, making Hednesford Europe's fastest quarter- mile oval. With the circuit built at the base of the reservoir, the circuit has the advantage of being at the bottom of a large \\"bowl\\", with grass banks surrounding the circuit providing excellent views for spectators. For a small fee, spectators can even drive their cars onto the site and watch from their cars at viewing posts the top of the banks. The circuit is of a quarter mile length, with two banked corners, and a tarmac track surface. In addition to the grass banks surrounding the circuit, spectators can watch from terracing directly next to the track, along with two all-seater grandstands situated on the two corners, with covered seating for 3000 spectators. Other facilities include a permanent race control, licensed bar and cafe. Bill Morris was the original promoter of stockcar racing on the site, having been inspired by friend Bill France's effort in Daytona (USA). In the early 1980s Bill retired from active promoting and handed over the reins to \\"Incarace\\", owned by his son Martin and Philip Bond. In the late 1990s Martin retired and Philip Bond took over as sole promoter until retiring in March 2008. William 'Bill' Morris founder of the Raceway died 9 October 2008. Events at the circuit are still promoted and run by Midlands-based Incarace Ltd - which has now been taken over by Deane Wood, owner of Southern-based motorsports promotion Spedeworth International. The stadium continues to be a flagship Short Circuit raceway in the UK. Events staged at the circuit The circuit is a major venue for a number of National Hot Rods, BriSCA Formula 1 Stock Cars, BriSCA F2 and Banger racing events in the UK, with many formulas of racing being staged at the circuit. The circuit has also staged short-circuit truck racing events, and annually holds a large firework display. Major events include the \\"National Championship Weekend\\", the \\"Crash Cavalcade\\", \\"Veterans Day\\" and the \\"Civil War\\" - the oldest head-to-head banger meeting in the country. Trivia The circuit has been featured on BBC's Top Gear programme in the past, in a feature on banger racing. In addition, a number of satellite TV channels feature both banger and stock car races from the circuit. The Demons race team supplied a Car to Jeremy Clarkson a Ford Cortina for the Top Gear piece The 100th edition of Tiswas was broadcast live from Hednesford Raceway back in the Seventies.

It also serves the villages Kj√∏llefjord and Gamvik. The airport is located outside of the village of Mehamn and is owned and operated by the state-owned Avinor. The asphalt runway is . Services are operated by Wider√∏e using Dash 8-100 aircraft which connect to other communities in Finnmark, and the city of Troms√∏. The routes are subsidized by the Ministry of Transport and Communications through public service obligations. Both the villages of Gamvik and Kj√∏llefjord were considered as alternative locations for the airport, and both received smaller airfields before Mehamn Airport opened in 1974. Wider√∏e operated de Havilland Canada Twin Otters until they were replaced with the Dash 8 in 1995. The airport served 14,392 passengers in 2014 and is the northernmost airport in Europe except Svalbard. History Plans for an airport on Nordkinnhalv√∏ya were first articulated by a committee appointed by the Finnmark County Municipality. Their 1966 report recommended that six regional airports be built in Finnmark, which included Mehamn and Kj√∏llefjord as a possible site. Simultaneously the national government starting on planning a national network of regional airports.Melling: 64 The Civil Aviation Administration (later renamed Avinor) looked into suitable sites at Mehamn, Kj√∏llefjord, and Gamvik.Melling: 76 The government prioritized construction in Finnmark last, so the regional airline Norving took initiative to build smaller airfields in selected communities. They took contact with both Lebesby Municipality and Gamvik Municipality to initiate construction.Melling: 65 Landside part of the terminal Initially the CAA supported Gamvik as a location for a regional airport, in part because of the lower investment costs. The municipal council in Gamvik instead chose the municipal center of Mehamn, from Gamvik village. The Gamvik chapter of the Norwegian Red Cross Search and Rescue Corps started fund-raising for Gamvik village to build its own airport. It applied to the municipality, but no public funds were granted. Gamvik Airport opened on 29 August.Melling: 77 Also at Kj√∏llefjord, from Mehamn, locals decided to build their own airport. Kj√∏llefjord Airport opened in 1974, but because of the opening of Mehamn Airport it never saw any regular traffic.Melling: 108 The use of the airports at Kj√∏llefjord and Gamvik fell out regular use from 1974 and were soon abandoned. Simultaneously as Mehamn was awarded an airport, Parliament voted to build a new road, National Road 888, which would better winter transport between the villages of Kj√∏llefjord, Mehamn and Gamvik, allow Mehamn Airport to efficiently serve the entire peninsula. Construction was subcontracted to Veidekke. From they started construction in late 1973; it took 39 days from start until the first aircraft landed. Mehamn airport opened on 1 August 1974, at the same time as S√∏rkjosen Airport, Hammerfest Airport, Berlev√•g Airport and Vads√∏ Airport. Because of late payment the airport remained owned by Veidekke until 1976. Both Wider√∏e and Norving applied to operate the Finnmark route, which would connect the airports together and to the primary airports in Finnmark and Troms√∏ Airport. Norving planned to operate with their Britten- Norman Islanders and Britten-Norman Trislanders. The government opted to selected Wider√∏e and their Twin Otters, citing the need for a single operator for all subsidized regional routes in the country.Melling: 109 Wider√∏e operated Twin Otters on the route until 1995, when the Dash 8 was introduced. The state and the Civil Aviation Administration took over ownership and operations of the airport from 1 January 1997, in exchange for being paid to Gamvik Municipality. Flights to Mehman have been subject to public service obligations since 1 April 1997. Airport security was introduced on 1 January 2005. The passenger terminal building has been expanded several times and a garage was built in 2005. The runway was expanded and a new lighting system was installed in 2011. Future Avinor sees a problem in getting new aircraft of the size of the Dash 8-100 (39 seats) which can use the 800 meter runways, so they plan to use smaller planes with 19 seats (which is the size of the Twin Otter) for these small airports when the Dash 8-100 retire before 2030. Facilities The Avinor-owned airport has an integrated control tower and terminal capable of handling seventy passengers per hour. Mehamn has a asphalt runway aligned 17‚Äì35 (roughly north‚Äìsouth). The terrain south of the runway is steep and hinders any future expansion of the runway and limits the weight of Dash 8 aircraft. The tarmac has parking to two Dash 8-sized aircraft. SCAT-I, a Global Positioning System-based landing system is under deployment. Parking and taxis are available at the airport, which is located from the village of Mehamn. Mehamn Airport is the northernmost airport in Continental Europe. Airlines and destinations Mehamn is served by Wider√∏e, which operates 39-seat Dash 8-100 and Q200 aircraft to other communities in Finnmark. The routes are operated as public service obligations financed by the Ministry of Transport and Communications. Many flights go to or from Troms√∏ or Kirkenes with several landings at other small airports. The airport served 14,392 passengers, 2,789 aircraft movements and handled 4 tonnes of cargo in 2014. Accidents and incidents On 11 March 1982, Wider√∏e Flight 933 crashed into the Barents Sea between Berlev√•g Airport and Mehamn Airport, killing all fifteen people on board the Twin Otter. The accident was caused by structural failure in the rudder and vertical stabilizer following severe clear-air turbulence. A conspiracy theory arose concerning a collision with a British Harrier fighter, which resulted in four investigations‚Äînone which found any evidence of a collision.

She was an Olympic and World Championship gold medalist in team competitions, and won individual all-around titles at other events. Zakharova won her first all-around championship at the 1976 All-Union School Spartakiade. That same year she placed second overall in the Junior USSR Championships. She was a consistently strong competitor through 1977-78, winning several vaulting and floor exercise event titles. A powerful tumbler, Zakharova was the first woman to incorporate three double-back somersaults into her floor routine. Zakhrova's most successful year was 1979, during which she won individual all-around championships at the American Cup, Moscow News, and World Cup events. At the World Championships held in Fort Worth, Texas she was a member of the Soviet women's team which finished second to the Romanian squad led by an injured Nadia ComƒÉneci. It was the first time the Soviets had failed to beat their Romanian rivals in a major team competition. In 1980 Zakharova continued to enjoy success, winning the gold medal with her Soviet teammates at the Olympic games and capturing a second all-around title at the World Cup. That proved to be her high-water mark, as her performances began to decline from 1981 onward. After retirement, Stella Zakharova married Dynamo Kiev football player Viktor Khlus. The couple have a son and a daughter. Zakharova's home country Ukraine hosts an annual Stella Zakharova Cup competition in artistic gymnastics, named in her honor. Footage of Stella Zakharova training with the Soviet national team was captured in a 1978 Soviet Gymnastics training documentary; Zakharova appears about one minute into the clip .

It is named after William Girling OBE, a chairman of the Metropolitan Water Board (MWB). The reservoir and the nearby King George V Reservoir are known collectively as the Chingford Reservoirs. The storage reservoir, which is owned by Thames Water, is bordered by Chingford to the east and Ponders End and Edmonton to the west, and covers with a perimeter of . There is no public access.  History  The Chingford Reservoirs: Looking south over the twin basins of the King George V Reservoir and the William Girling Reservoir in background The reservoir was conceived as part of an overall plan for the Lea Valley and laid before the Royal Commission on Water Supply (Balfour Committee) in 1893. At the time the responsible authority was the East London Waterworks Company. However, under the Provisions of the Metropolis Water Act of 1902, the undertakings of this and seven other companies were transferred to the Metropolitan Water Board (MWB). Work began in 1936 when the tender of John Mowlem (for ¬£682,156) was accepted. The project was led by civil engineer, Robert Wynne-Edwards. Due to the use of mechanical scrapers and bulldozers, which were being used for the first time in British dam construction, progress was rapid. The design, by Sir Jonathan Roberts Davidson, President of the Institution of Civil Engineers 1948/49, attracted widespread technical interest in 1937 when a major slip occurred in the partly formed embankment at the north-west corner. When the embankment fill had reached a width had dropped and moved forward . Fortunately, the dam failed before any water had been stored. Investigations were under way when a second slip occurred in December 1937. Two independent soil mechanics experts, Dr. Herbert Chatley and Professor Karl Terzaghi, were called in and both made recommendations. In July 1938 the MWB made important modifications to the original design. Subsequent investigations into this landslip can be regarded as the birth of modern soil mechanics in Britain. The reservoir was redesigned to increase its capacity by 11.3%. Construction was further delayed by the outbreak of the Second World War and the reservoir was not finally completed until 1951, when it was officially opened on 4 September by William Girling, Chairman of the MWB, and named eponymously.Smith.D Civil Engineering Heritage p.74 (2001) Retrieved 2 January 2007 As part of the 2012 Summer Olympics security exercise, the reservoir was identified as suitable for the deployment of Rapier surface-to-air missiles.  Description  The geology of the site is alluvium underlain by river terrace gravels and in turn overlying the London Clay formation. The reservoir is formed by a continuous earthen embankment that encloses the basin. The embankments consist of a central puddle clay core with a selected material adjacent to the core forming a filter. The core is a maximum of wide at the base and tapers to wide at the crest. The core typically extends into the London Clay to form a watertight cut off. The embankment shoulders consist of zones of ballast and filling material. The upper embankments slopes are 1 in 2.5 externally, whilst the lower slopes to the berm were constructed at a bank slope of 1 in 8.  Inflow  Water is pumped from the River Lee Diversion through five inlet pumps with a maximum of 600 ML/d, though normal operation is 250 ML/d. In addition there are two 200 mm diameter inlets from the North London Artificial Recharge borehole scheme.North london artificial recharge scheme Retrieved 12 September 2008  Outflow  The outlet tower consists of a granite faced dry shaft that houses a diameter vertical pipe, with draw-off pipes at four different levels. The lower end of the standpipe is connected to a diameter steel outlet conduit. The water is conveyed to the Coppermills Water Treatment Works for treatment, with the facility for bulk transfer to Essex and Suffolk Water.  Ecology  The water is part of the Chingford Reservoirs Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI).English Nature citation, Chingford Reservoirs Retrieved 21 December 2007 It is a major wintering ground for wildfowl and wetland birds, including nationally important numbers of some species. The water also forms a moult refuge for a large population of wildfowl during the late summer months. A total of 85 wetland species have been recorded here in recent years.

Synopsis  Cosmic Voyage has a format similar to Eva Szasz's Cosmic Zoom, and Charles and Ray Eames's classic Powers of Ten educational video. All were based on the 1957 book Cosmic View by Dutch educator Kees Boeke. Cosmic Voyage takes viewers on a journey through forty- two orders of magnitude, beginning at a celebration in Venice, Italy slowly zooming out into the edge of the observable universe. Then the view descends back to earth, and later zooms in upon a raindrop on a leaf on a hoop used in the celebration mentioned earlier, down to the level of subatomic particles (quarks). In addition, the film offers some brief insight on the Big Bang theory, black holes, and the development of our Solar System. It also simulates a journey through Fermilab's Tevatron particle accelerator in Chicago, where an atom collision is depicted.

The JISC is composed of many nationwide committees and plays a vital role in standardizing activities across Japan. History In the Meiji era, private enterprises were responsible for making standards, although the Japanese government too had standards and specification documents for procurement purposes for certain articles, such as munitions. These were summarized to form an official standard, the Japanese Engineering Standard, in 1921. During World War II, simplified standards were established to increase mat√©riel output. The present Japanese Standards Association was established after Japan's defeat in World War II in 1945. The Japanese Industrial Standards Committee regulations were promulgated in 1946, and new standards were formed. The Industrial Standardization Law was enacted in 1949, which forms the legal foundation for the present Japanese Industrial Standards. New JIS mark The Industrial Standardization Law was revised in 2004 and the JIS product certification mark was changed; since October 1, 2005, the new JIS mark has been used upon re-certification. Use of the old mark was allowed during a three-year transition period ending on September 30, 2008, and every manufacturer was able to use the new JIS mark. Therefore all JIS-certified Japanese products manufactured since October 1, 2008, have had the new JIS mark.

He became a siddha, a liberated soul which has destroyed all of his karma. Events of the Jaina version of Ramayana are placed at the time of Munisuvratanatha. His chief apostle (ga·πáadhara) was sage Malli SvƒÅmi.  Legends  Munisuvrata was the twentieth tirthankara of the present half time cycle (avasarpini) in Jain cosmology. Jain texts like padmapurana place him as a contemporary of Rama. According to Jain texts, Munisuvrata was born as 54 lakh years passed after the birth of the nineteenth tirthankara, MallinƒÅtha. According to Jain beliefs, Munisuvrata descended from the heaven called ƒÄnata kalpa on the twelfth day of the bright half of the month of ƒÄ≈õvina ‚Äì ƒÅ≈õvina ≈õukla dvƒÅda≈õi‚Äì to queen PadmƒÅ and king Sumitra. On the third day of Shraavana (month) Krishna (dark fortnight) according to Hindu calendar, queen Padmavati of Rajgir saw sixteen auspicious dreams. When she shared her dreams with her husband, king Sumitra of the Harivamsa clan, he explained that a tirthankara will be born to them soon. Then, Munisuvrata was born to them on the fifteenth day of the Shraavana Shukla (bright fortnight) in 1,184,980 BC. His height is mentioned to be 20 bows (60 metres) and complexion as a dark one. According to Jain texts, after spending 7,500 years as a youth, Munisuvrata is believed to have ruled his kingdom for 15,000 years (rƒÅjyakƒÅla). He then renounced all worldly pursuits and became a monk. According to Jain beliefs, he spent 11 months performing karma-destroying austerities and then attained the all-embracing knowledge ‚Äì Omniscience (kevala j√±ƒÅna) under a Champaka tree. He is said to have 18 ganadharas headed by Malli. Puspavati or Puspadatta is believed to be the head-nun of his order. Samayavayanga sutra, however, names Kumbha and Amila as the head ganadhara and head nun respectively. Munisuvrata is said to have lived for over 30,000 years and attained liberation (nirvƒÅ√±a) from Sammeda ≈õikhara on the twelfth day of the dark half of the month of phƒÅlguna ‚Äì phƒÅlguna k·πõ·π£na dvƒÅda≈õi. Varuna is mentioned to be his yaksha and his yakhsini is named Bahurupini in Digambara tradition and Naradatta in Svetambara tradition. Munisuvrata finds mentions in Jain texts like Uttarapurana and Tiloyapannati.  Adoration  Svayambhustotra by Acharya Samantabhadra is the adoration of twenty-four tirthankaras. Its five slokas (aphorisms) adore the qualities of MunisuvratanƒÅtha. An idol of Munisuvrata was installed in 127 AD or 157 AD in the Devanirmita stupa, Mathura.  Iconography  Mahavira is usually depicted in a sitting (or standing) meditative pose, with a lion symbol beneath him; each tƒ´rthankara has a distinct emblem, which allows worshippers to distinguish similar idols. Jivantasvami represents Munisuvrata as a princely state. The Jina is represented as standing in the kayotsarga pose wearing crown and ornaments.

It's a dual purpose breed with a very good milk and beef performance. The females grow up to their full size within three years and reach a weight of 550 ‚Äì 600 kg. They have a correct fundament and hard claws. The Tyrol Greys have a good forage instinct and feed conversion. They are also robust, longliving, and very fertile. The milk has an excellent quality and is adequate either for the direct consumption or for the processing to high-quality products (cheese, butter, yogurt). Among the mountain cattle breeds in Italy the Tyrol Grey has the best milk amount/milk quality (fat, protein) ratio and delivers a higher amount of contents for the processing to quality products. The above-average per cow was 2002 in the South Tyrol about 4,836 kg milk per annum, 3.78% milk fat content, and 3.38% protein (8,491 control cows). When you evaluate the performance you have to allow for the middle body weight and the tough feeding and husbandry conditions in mountain regions. The Tyrolean Grey cattle is a dual purpose breed for milk and beef and possesses an excellent mast ability and beef quality. Breeding purpose is the advancement of milk and beef quantity and quality. Furthermore it is the purpose to conserve the typical functional attributes of the breed: middle body height, robust constitution, correct fundament, hard claws, hardiness, mountain pasture competence, good fertility, easy calving, udder quality and good milkability.

On 31 July 1851 it was approved by President Louis-Napol√©on Bonaparte as being of public interest. For over 175 years, the SHF has been one of the main forces in the publishing of texts and documents on French history. Many leading French historians of the 19th and 20th centuries have been elected to its annual presidency. Its field was initially limited to the period before 1789, but the SHF later absorbed the Soci√©t√© d'histoire contemporaine (1927). Its series of critical editions and its periodicals (Bulletin and Annuaire, combined since 1863 under the title Annuaire-Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© de l'histoire de France ABSHF) amount to over 500 volumes, containing considerable historical source material: mainly chronicles, memoirs, journals and letters, but also other documents such as financial or judicial records. A large proportion of all volumes published up to 1940 are now freely accessible online, through the digital library of the Biblioth√®que nationale de France, Gallica, and Google Books. The SHF gathers twice a year for a lecture on a historical subject and, on occasions, holds conferences for a wider audience. Membership is open to both professional historians and serious amateurs interested in supporting and taking part in the activities of the SHF. Among other resources, the SHF website provides the complete catalogue of publications (with links to all titles available for reading or buying online) and a general index of articles and documents published in the Annuaire-Bulletin from 1911 to the present.

The term originated in the proceedings to the Sixth Review Conference of the Biological and Toxins Weapons Convention held in Geneva in 2006. In the previous review conference talks broke down over American refusals to allow for a verification mechanism be established to monitor biological weapons programs in states parties. This was against the wishes of other WEOG (Western European and Others Group) states, which also include Canada, Turkey, Australasia and Western Europe. At the 2006 Review Conference the JACKSNNZ states remain supportive of a verification protocol (although are unlikely to push for it knowing that the current US government will not accede on this point). However, the JACKSNNZ also seeks balance within the WEOG, and to protect the interests of non-EU states.

Background and education Born William Amhurst Daniel-Tyssen, he was the eldest son of William George Daniel-Tyssen, High Sheriff of Norfolk in 1843, who was the son of William George Daniel, of Foley House, near Maidstone, Kent, High Sheriff of Kent in 1825, and his wife Amelia Amherst, the daughter of Captain John Amherst and Mary Tyssen, heiress of Foulden Hall, Norfolk. Amherst's mother was Mary, daughter of Andrew Fountaine, of Narford Hall, Norfolk. In 1852, he and his father assumed by Royal licence the surname of Tyssen-Amhurst. However, in 1877 he again changed it, to Tyssen-Amherst, also by Royal licence. Tyssen-Amherst was educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford. Political career In 1880, he was elected to Parliament for West Norfolk, a seat he held until 1885, and then represented South West Norfolk until 1892. The latter year he was raised to the peerage as Baron Amherst of Hackney, in the County of London, with remainder, in default of male issue, to his eldest daughter Mary and her issue male. Apart from his parliamentary career Tyssen-Amherst also served as High Sheriff of Norfolk in 1866 and as Deputy Lieutenant of Middlesex and was a Justice of the Peace for Norfolk, Middlesex and Westminster. Collector Tyssen-Amherst is chiefly remembered as a collector of books, manuscripts, antique furniture and other works of art. He became famous for his Egyptian collection. In his country home, Didlington Hall, he built a museum for his rapidly growing Egyptian collection. In 1906, he was forced to sell a large portion of his collection after discovering that his estate and certain trust funds had been entirely dissipated at the hands of an untrustworthy solicitor, Charles Cheston, under whose management they had been placed. He lived only six weeks following the first Sotheby's auction from this collection. His name is noted at the Carter gallery display of Swaffham Museum in Norfolk, suggesting that Tyssen-Amherst's collection of ancient papyri and Egyptian figures was seen by a young Howard Carter. The Museum records reveal that in 1882 he exhibited six \\"life size Egyptian figures\\" at Swaffham assembly rooms. A copy of the catalogue describes the figures he exhibited which included a figure of a Bedouin chief. He also exhibited a Thutmose III brick circa 1330bc, excavated from the banks of the Nile.Swaffham Fine Art Exhibition Official Catalogue, J Jenvey Pricehon.sec 1882 Amherst's collection included the lower section of a 20th Dynasty tomb robbery papyri otherwise described as the Leopold II and Amherst Papyrus, which is in the possession of the Morgan Library & Museum, New York. His rare book collection included the \\"only genuine perfect copy known\\" of Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye, King Charles I's personal copy of the Cambridge Bible, and a Gutenberg Bible (No. 45). Family Lord Amherst of Hackney married Margaret Susan Mitford, only child of Admiral Robert Mitford, in 1856. Susan Mitford was a lineal descendant of politician Robert Mitford and Philadelphia Wharton, first cousin (once removed) of poet and journalist John Mitford, third cousin (three times removed) of both English Attorney General Lord Redesdale and William Mitford, a sixth cousin (twice removed) to the Mitford family's \\"Mitford Sisters\\", and a distant cousin of author Mary Russell Mitford. They had seven daughters: *Mary Rothes Margaret (\\"May\\") in 1857, *Sybil Margaret (\\"Sib\\") in 1858, *Florence Margaret (\\"Flo\\" or \\"Fluff\\") in 1860, *Margaret Mitford (\\"Maggie\\") in 1864, *Alicia Margaret (\\"Ally\\") in 1865, *Geraldine Margaret (\\"Cherry\\") in 1867, and *Beatrice Margaret (\\"Bee\\") in 1869. All of the girls were named after their mother, Margaret. Lord Amherst died in London, in January 1909, aged 73, and was succeeded in the barony according to the special remainder by his eldest daughter Mary. He was the great-grandfather of American heir William Amherst Vanderbilt Cecil, operator of the Biltmore Estate in North Carolina.

History The first written record of the existence of the village is from 1393. According to it Sigismund gave this area to the possession of Gy√∂rgy Madaras, that is where the name comes from. During the Ottoman occupation the village was destroyed. In the 18th and 19th centuries the number of the population began to increase again, new houses, buildings were built. In 1811 it became a market town. In 1944 the German army had a military airfield built at the edge of the village. During the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1944 the Soviet air force took over the airfield. Jewish pogrom In 1946 there occurred the Kunmadaras pogrom, inspired by a blood libel rumour that Jews were making sausages out of children. Two Jews were killed and fifteen were injured. Military role in the socialist period Between 1956 and 1991 Soviet army troops were stationed here. According to a book by K√°roly V√°ndor, this airfield was one of the military facilities in which nuclear weapons were held during the Cold War. The Soviet 328th independent Reconnaissance Aviation Regiment, Southern Group of Forces, was stationed at Kunmadaras until 1990‚Äì91, whereupon it was withdrawn back to the Odessa region and disbanded.

It is the sequel to DID's earlier software title, TFX. An expansion pack, EF 2000: TACTCOM, was released in 1996. A compilation, EF 2000: Evolution, that included the main game and the expansion was released in 1996. An updated version, Super EF2000, was released exclusively for Windows 95 in 1996 in Europe. In 1997, a compilation titled EF2000 V2.0 was released in North America that included the original DOS versions of EF2000 and TACTCOM and also the Windows exclusive Super EF2000. In June 1997, the graphics were boosted when DID released the \\"Graphics+\\" patch, which added Rendition V√©rit√© hardware support and Glide API for 3dfx graphics card support to EF2000. Gameplay EF2000 is a combat flight simulator of the Eurofighter Typhoon (EF2000) aircraft, featuring detailed terrain of the Baltic region. It supports virtual reality goggles. Graphics features included naturally irregular topography, clouds and darkening skies at high altitudes. Gameplay consists of quick combat, simulator (free flight mode), training, multiplayer and campaign mode. The game featured a dynamic campaign simulating a campaign set in northern Europe. Missions require the player to evade ground-based and airborne defenses. Mid-air refueling is included. MFDs allow player to attack both flying and grounded targets with a range of weapons, including precision- guided munitions, missiles and unguided bombs. Spot view allows for remote viewing of targets, enemies, friendly forces or the player's own EF2000. With padlock, the computer could lock onto a target and follow it around the cockpit even when the target maneuvers from in front of the player's aircraft. Reception On release, a Next Generation critic called the game \\"one of the best flight sims on the market\\", applauding the realistically texture-mapped graphics, easy-to-learn interface, intelligently responsive AI, and multiplayer networking. Computer Game Review summarized it as \\"a good flight simulation overall\\". EF2000 won Computer Gaming Worlds 1995 \\"Simulation of the Year\\" award. The editors praised it for combining \\"a high level of realism with fun\\", and noted its \\"ground-breaking terrain and aircraft graphics\\". In 1996, Computer Gaming World also ranked it as the 42nd best video game of all time for making combat simulation graphics, sound, and realism take \\"a flying leap forward.\\"CGW 148: 150 Best Games of All Time That same year, Next Generation ranked it as the 42nd top game of all time for being \\"simply the most immersive combat flight sim on the market.\\"Next Generation 21 (September 1996), p.55. PC Gamer nominated EF2000 as the best simulation of 1995, although it lost to Apache. It was also the second-place finalist for Computer Game Reviews 1995 \\"Simulation of the Year\\" award, which went to MechWarrior II. Next Generation reviewed EF2000 V2.0, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \\"All in all, EF2000 v2.0 is a solid update to an already good title. The only real drawback to the game is the fact that you really do need a 3D card to play the game the way it should be played. Aside from that, EF2000 v2.0 is an excellent choice for anyone interested in a little aerial combat.\\" In 1996, Computer Gaming World declared EF2000 the 60th-best computer game of all time. It was named the eighth-best computer game ever by PC Gamer UK in 1997. The editors called it \\"the best flight of all time\\".

The Hindu god Krishna is mentioned as his cousin. He is believed to have been born at Sauripura in the Yadu lineage, like Krishna. His birth date is mentioned as the fifth day of Shravana Shukla of the Hindu calendar. He is believed to have herded cattle and to have become fond of animals. According to Jain belief, on his wedding day Neminatha heard the cries of animals being killed for the marriage feast, and moved by the sorrow he renounced the world to become a monk ‚Äì a scene found in many Jain artwork. He is believed to have attained moksha on Girnar Hills near Junagadh, a pilgrimage center for Jains. Nomenclature The name Neminatha consists of two Sanskrit words, Nemi which means \\"rim, felly of a wheel\\" or alternatively \\"thunderbolt\\", and natha which means \\"lord, patron, protector\\". According to the Jain text Uttarapurana, as well as the explanation of Hemachandra, it was the ancient Indian deity Indra who named the 22nd tirthankara as Neminatha, because he viewed the Jina as the \\"rim of the wheel of dharma\\". In Svetambara Jain texts, his name Aristanemi came from a dream his mother during pregnancy, where she saw a \\"wheel of Arista jewels\\". His full name is mentioned as Aristanemi which is an epithet of the sun-chariot. Neminatha's name is spelled close to the 21st tirthankara Naminatha. Life In Jain tradition Neminatha was the twenty-second tirthankara (ford-maker) of the avasarpi·πáƒ´ (present descending cycle of Jain cosmology). Jain tradition place him as a contemporary of Krishna, the Hindu deity. According to Jain history, there was a gap of 581,750 years between the Neminatha and his predecessor, Naminatha. According to Jain beliefs, he lived 2356 years before the 23rd tirthankara, Parshvanatha.  Birth and early life The birth of Aristanemi, Kalpa S≈´tra Depiction of wedding procession of Neminatha. His legend states that he renounced after hearing animal cries while they were being sacrificed to prepare his wedding feast. Neminatha is mentioned as the youngest son of king Samudravijaya and queen Shivadevi of the Yadu lineage, born at Sauripura (Dvaraka). He believed to have become fond of animals in his early life due to being in a cattle herding family. Jain legends place him in the Girnar-Kathiawad (in Saurashtra region of modern-day Gujarat). His birth date is believed to be the fifth day of Shravana Shukla of the Hindu calendar. He is believed to have been born with a dark-blue skin complexion, very handsome but a shy young man. His father is mentioned as the brother of Vasudeva, Krishna's father, therefore the he is mentioned as the cousin of Krishna in Trishashti-salaka-purusha-charitra. In one of the legends, on being taunted by Satyabhama, wife of Krishna, Neminatha is depicted to have blown Panchajanya, the mighty conch of Krishna. According to the texts, no one could lift the conch except Krishna, let alone blow it. After this event, Puranas state that Krishna decided to test Neminatha's strength and challenged him for a friendly duel. Neminatha, being a tirthankara, is believed to have defeated Krishna easily. He is also mentioned as spinning the chakra (discuss, primary weapon of Krishna) on his fingers during his childhood.  As a teacher  In the war between Krishna and Jarasandha, Neminatha is believed to have participated alongside Krishna. He is believed to have taught Krishna the knowledge that he shared with Arjuna in the Bhagavad Gita. This a believed to be the reason that has led Jains to accept, read and cite the same as a spiritually important text. This is believed to be the reason for celebrating Krishna related festivals in Jainism and for intermingle with Hindus as spiritual cousins. Chandogya Upanishad, a religious text in Hinduism, mentions Angiras Ghora as the teacher of Krishna. He is believed to have taught Krishna the five vows, namely, honesty, asceticism, charity, non-violence and truthfulness. Ghora is identified as Neminatha by some of the scholars. Mahabharata mentions him as the teacher of the path of salvation to king Sagara. He may also be identified with a Scandinavian or Chinese deity, but such claims are not accepted generally.  Renunciation and final days  Neminatha temple complex on Girnar hills near Junagadh, Gujarat. Jain tradition holds that the Neminatha's marriage was arranged with Rajulakumari or Rajimati or Rajamati, daughter of Ugrasena. Ugrasena is believed to be the king of DvƒÅrakƒÅ and maternal grandfather of Krishna. He is believed to have heard animal cries as they were being slaughtered for the marriage feast. Taken over by sorrow and distress at the sight, he is believed to have given up the desire of getting married, and to have become a monk and gone to Mount Girnar. His bride-to-be is believed to have followed him, becoming a nun and joining his ascetic order. According to Kalpasutras, Neminatha led an ascetic life there by eating only once every three days, meditated for 55 days and then obtained omniscience on Mount Raivataka, under a Mahavenu tree. According to Jain texts Neminatha had 11 gandhara with Varadatta Svami as the leader of the Neminatha disciples. Neminatha's sangha (religious order) consisted of 18,000 sadhus (male monks) and 44,000 sadhvis (female monks) as per the mentions in Kalpa Sutra. After a life of about 1,000 years, he is said to have attained moksha (nirvana) on the fifth peak or tonk (Urjayant Parvat) of Mount Girnar. Of these 1,000 years, he is believed to have spent 300 years as a bachelor, 54 days as an ascetic monk and 700 years as an omniscient being.  Legacy   Worship  Along with Mahavira, Parshvanatha and Rishabhanatha, Neminatha is one of the twenty four tirthankaras who attract the most devotional worship among the Jains. Unlike the last two tirthankaras, historians consider Neminatha and all other tirthankaras to be legendary characters. Scenes from Neminatha's life are popular in Jain art. The yaksha and yakshi of Neminatha are Sarvanha and Ambika according to Digambara tradition and Gomedha and Ambika according to ≈övƒìtƒÅmbara tradition.  Literature  Kalpa S≈´tra recto Neminatha's blowing Krishna's conch verso text The Jain traditions about Neminatha is incorporated in the Harivamsa Purana of Jinasena. A palm leaf manuscript on the life of Neminatha, named Neminatha-Charitra, was written in 1198-1142 AD. It is now preserved in Shantinatha Bhandara, Khambhat. Rajul's love for Neminatha is described in the Rajal-Barahmasa (an early 14th-century poem of Vijayachandrasuri). The incident were Neminatha is depicted as blowing Krishna's mighty counch is given in Kalpa S≈´tra. The separation of Rajul and Neminatha has been a popular theme among Jain poets who composed Gujarati fagus, a poetry genre. Some examples are Neminatha Fagu (1344) by Rajshekhar, Neminatha Fagu (1375) by Jayashekhar and Rangasagara Neminatha Fagu (1400) by Somsundar. A poem Neminatha Chatushpadika (1269) by Vinaychandra depicted the same story. Hindu tradition mentions about Neminatha in vedas like Rigveda, Yajurveda and Samaveda.  Iconography  Tirumalai built in 12th century Neminatha is believed to have had the same dark-bluish colored skin as Krishna. Painting depicting his life stories generally identify him as dark colored. His iconographic identifier is a conch carved or stamped below his statues. Sometimes, as with Vishnu's iconography, a chakra is also shown near him, as in the 6th-century sculpture found at the archaeological site near Padhavali (Madhya Pradesh). Artworks showing Neminatha sometimes include Ambika yakshi, but her color varies from golden to greenish to dark-blue, by region. The earliest known image of Neminatha was found in Kankali Tila dating back to c. 18 CE.

It originally aired on September 30, 2007. This episode centers around the Smiths, whom start to develop communication issues with each other. Francine becomes aggravated that the family cannot congregate with each other during dinner. Stan later plans for a vacation in Hawaii, only to be interrupted by Roger. The family subsequently go on several virtual vacations, only to have Francine go into an emotional breakdown. The Smith family go onto a cruise, but Francine's suspicions get the best of her and the Smiths are stranded on an island. This episode was directed by Albert Calleros, and written by Josh Bycel and Jonathan Fener. It received mixed reviews from most television critics. According to the Nielson ratings, it was viewed by 6.03 million households during its original airing, and acquired a 3.1 rating in the 18-49 demographic. Elizabeth Banks guest stars as Becky Arangino in the episode. Plot When Francine becomes frustrated that the family is falling apart, trying and failing to get them together for Sunday night dinner, Stan suggests a vacation, and the Smiths have a great time in Maui until Roger somehow awakens them. Francine, Steve and Hayley find themselves floating in virtual reality chambers filled with a green, gooey substance. They learn that Stan programs a vacation in the goo chambers every year because to him, a real vacation is time away from the family. Francine gets angry and demands they go on a real vacation. Twice they appear to do so, first skiing and then going to Italy, but each time they wake up in the goo chambers, with Steve and then Hayley programming the vacations, both also wanting some time away from each other. Fed up with the family's fracture, Francine breaks down and gives up. Having realized her depression, they book a cruise to which she declines, until Stan shows her he is returning the chambers to the CIA, convincing her their vacation is real. On the cruise, only Francine has fun while Steve meets Becky (Elizabeth Banks), the attractive cruise activities director, who hits on him (because she is attracted to younger boys.) Meanwhile, Roger, who wants to become a famous movie star, lands a part, only to quit when he is unable to cry on cue and expresses his disgust with the script. He then becomes an Olivia Newton-John impersonator on a cruise ship‚Äîthe same ship that the Smiths are on. When Francine sees Stan and Hayley acting happy, Steve and Becky together, and Roger singing \\"Xanadu,\\" she angrily believes to be in the goo chambers again and jumps overboard, expecting to wake up at home. The others, plus Becky, follow her into the sea and rescue her, but realize nobody told the ship to come back for them. They land on an island, where then learn that hunters living on the island plan to hunt them down for sport, causing them to take refuge in a cave. The ship stops at Puerto Rico, where Roger is forced off the ship for stealing silverware. With no money to return home, he resorts to becoming an exotic dancer at a nearby strip club, but his job nearly becomes prostitution. Distraught by what he's doing and missing his home and family, Roger breaks into tears, to which a heartfelt john gives him money and helps him escape the club. Having finally cried \\"on cue,\\" Roger believes he can be a star again. In the cave, Becky is crushed to death when she tries to collect rainwater, and the Smiths reluctantly resort to eating her to survive. The hunters then find them, and the family learns that the island‚Äîand the hunt‚Äîwas part of the cruise. When partially asked about Becky, Francine says \\"Well, nothing bonds a family like a dark, horrible secret.\\" Stan quickly asks where the family wants to go next year. The scene then changes to the Smiths happily floating in a hot-air balloon over a vast canyon holding a toast \\"to the goo,\\" having decided to use the goo chambers, this time together as a family. Reception \\"The Vacation Goo\\" aired on September 30, 2007 as part of the animated television line-up on Fox. It was preceded by The Simpsons, King of the Hill, and its opposite show Family Guy. It was watched by 6.03 million, according to the Nielson ratings, and garnered a 3.1 rating in the 18-49 demographics. This episode was down 32% in total viewership compared to \\"Camp Refoogee\\", the previous season premiere of American Dad which was viewed by 8.9 million homes during its original airing. \\"The Vacation Goo\\" was met with mixed reviews from television critics. In a simultaneous review of the episodes of The Simpsons, King of the Hill, and Family Guy that preceded the show, Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club gave it a mixed review, writing, \\"What surprises me more than the show's continued existence, though, is the fact that it's actually pretty funny, which makes the fact that it remains so unremarkable so, well, remarkable. While I usually find the bajillion-megawatt \\"political satire\\" of the show to be pretty tiring, the family-oriented storylines can be pretty fun, in a campy way.\\" She went on to criticize the subplot, calling it \\"weird\\". She gave the episode a B, the third highest grade of the night, beating out King of the Hill episode \\"Bobby Rae\\", but scoring lower than The Simpsons episode \\"Homer of Seville\\" and Family Guy episode \\"Movin' Out (Brian's Song)\\".

History It was founded by the Argentine priest Msgr. Jos√© Le√≥n Gallardo with donations from the Argentine bishops, with the first stone being laid on 9 July 1910, the centenary of Argentine independence. Mrs. Saenz Pe√±a, wife of the President of Argentina, was present at the ceremony. Construction took twenty years, and the church was finally inaugurated in 1930. From then until 1989, the church was served by Mercedarian fathers; it is now served by Argentine diocesan clergy from a community in an adjoining house. It was built by the architect Giuseppe Astorri with a 7-storey campanile and a 2-storey fa√ßade in the style of ancient Christian architecture, with a central depiction of the Lamb and symbols of the four Evangelists.There are also depictions of four palms symbolizing Paradise, of the four biblical rivers and symbols of the twelve Apostles. The interior is also in ancient, Roman-Byzantine style, with a nave and two aisles divided by Ionic columns, a Cosmatesque-style pulpit and lectern and a polychrome marble floor (laid in geometric patterns with the national coat of arms of Argentina in the centre, and a memorial slab to its founder, which was presented by the Argentine cardinals and bishops at the Second Vatican Council). In the apse at the east end is a mosaic of Our Lady of Sorrows by Giambattista Conti and a high altar decorated with onyx and covered by a baldachino supported by four granite Corinthian columns. The choir is separated from the nave by an altar ring of white marble which includes intaglia and bronze gates with the national coat-of-arms and the arms of the Order of the Mercedarians. At one altar is a small statue of Our Lady of Luj√°n, principal patron of Argentina. Since 1967, it was a Cardinal's Titular Church. Estanislao Esteban Karlic is the incumbent cardinal-prorector since 2007. Special festivals and Masses The feast of Our Lady of Sorrows is celebrated on 15 September and 15 February (due to different calendars placing the feast on different days, it is celebrated twice in this church). Mass is celebrated in Spanish on the first Sunday in the month, and occasionally at other times.

It is Rankin's first novel, and the first book in the Brentford Trilogy (which, , consists of 10 novels). The book was first published in 1981 by Pan Books, and from 1991 by Corgi books, an imprint of Transworld Publishers. Although typically found in the Science fiction section of bookshops, it is a difficult novel to categorise;BBC's H2G2 article on Robert Rankin Rankin himself joked that he wanted to create a new genre of fiction, called \\"Far Fetched Fiction\\", so that he would have his own bookshelf in Smiths.A quote from an interview at the Octocon conference in 1999, a transcript of which is available here  Plot introduction  The Antipope charts Brentford's anti-heroes' (Jim Pooley and John Omally) drinking, work avoidance, womanising, and further drinking as they try to foil the eponymous antipope in his demonic attempt to establish a new Holy See.One fan's review of The Antipope Plot summary Jim Pooley and John Omally live in the London borough of Brentford, spending much of their time drinking in the Flying Swan, backing horses, womanising, and being generally feckless. Their problems start when Archroy's wife sells his beloved Morris Minor for five magic beans. Or perhaps they start when a hideous tramp appears in the neighbourhood, putting the wind up Neville the part-time barman something rotten. To cut a long story short, the tramp is none other than Pope Alexander VI, the last of the Borgias, and the beans grow into hideous homunculi, whose only purpose is to serve their dark master, the Antipope. Pope Alexander takes up residence in the local Seaman's Mission, and eventually there is a final showdown between the forces of good and evil, with Alexander and his bean-men on one side, and the massed might of Brentford on the other, including Pooley and Omally, Professor Slocombe, Father Moity, and Archroy, now a master of Dim Mak, a deadly martial art. Before the denouement, though, there are numerous sub-plots such as Channel-wading, a cowboy night at the Flying Swan, a trip underground with Soap Distant, and meetings with several other interesting characters, like builders Hairy Dave and Jungle John, and the elusive Other Sam.Plot summary taken from a review of the audio book; Full review can be found at this web site Characters in \\"The Antipope\\" *John Omally *Jim Pooley *Pope Alexander VI The Anti-Pope, also appearing as a tramp of dreadful aspect *Professor Slocombe *Neville, the part-time barman *Archroy *Norman Hartnell *Soap Distant *Old Pete Literary significance & criticism During the 1970s, Rankin wrote a number of short stories. Having been introduced to graphic designer Alan Aldridge, then at Aurelia Entertainment, he submitted some of those stories in the hope of getting a publishing deal. Despite liking the work, Aldridge was of the opinion that the short stories were unpublishable, and asked Rankin to write a novel. Rankin spent the next six months merging several of his short stories, resulting in The Antipope, which Aldridge took to Pan Books who bought and subsequently published the novel.British Fantasy Society interview with Robert RankinFTL interview with Robert Rankin In spite of Aldridge's and Pan's initial enthusiasm, Pan declined to publish any novels beyond the first three books of The Brentford Trilogy. Rankin's editor moved to another publisher, and his writing career came to a halt until 1988 when Sphere Books (under the Abacus imprint) reprinted the original trilogy in one volume ().Another BFS interview with Robert Rankin Despite this inauspicious start, Rankin and The Antipope have since attained something of a cult status, with the following two review extracts printed on the back cover of the Corgi edition: > 'Wonderful...A heady mix of Flann O'Brien, Douglas Adams, Tom Sharpe and Ken > Campbell, but with an inbuilt irreverence and indelicacy that is unique ‚Äì > and makes it the long-awaited, heavy smoker's answer to The Lord of the > Rings' ‚Äì Time OutBook details from Transworld Publishing > 'Wonderfully entertaining...reads like a Flann O'Brien rewrite of Close > Encounters' ‚Äì City Limits  Cover art  Original Alistair Graham artwork The original Pan Books release of the novel features a different front cover by artist Alistair Graham.Sproutlore article about Rankin's original 5 releases It depicts five of the main characters of the book, with The Flying Swan in the background and the figure of the resurrected Pope Alexander VI looming ominously over everything.

The film stars Valeria Golino, Vincenzo Amato, and Francesco Casisa. In the Italian language, respiro means a \\"breathe\\". Plot Grazia, played by Golino, is a free-spirited mother of three married to shy fisherman Pietro (Vincenzo Amato) and living on the idyllic but isolated island of Lampedusa in the Mediterranean Sea. She shows signs of manic depressive behaviour‚Äîone moment she's laughing wildly and swimming half-naked in the sea, while the next she's curled in a ball on her bed. Out of her earshot, the adult members of her extended family vaguely discuss sending her to a facility of some sort in Northern Italy. Grazia is closely shepherded by her oldest son Pasquale, played by Casisa, who appears to be about fourteen years old and often assumes more of a parental role with his mother. After Pietro puts down one of Grazia's dogs because he thinks it might be dangerous, impulsive Grazia sets all the stray dogs free in the town's makeshift kennel. After the dogs swarm over the island, the locals demand that Pietro do something about his wife. But when he tells her he plans to send her away to Northern Italy, she runs away and hides in a cave on the shore, where she's secretly tended by young Pasquale, who brings her food every day. Pietro and some friends doggedly search the island for Grazia, so Pasquale leaves one of her dresses by the edge of the sea as a ruse. Pietro finds the dress‚Äîthe one she was wearing the day she disappeared‚Äîand nearly everyone presumes she has drowned. Pietro, however, continues to search for her, and just before an important local religious festival, he sees her swimming in the water. He dives in to assist her, thinking a miracle has occurred, and many of the villagers follow suit, thus providing a sheltering circle around her as she is brought safely to shore. Awards and nominations Writer/director Crialese won the Critics Week Grand Prize and the Young Critics Award at the Cannes Film Festival. The film was also nominated for the Best European Union Film at the C√©sar Awards and received other nominations and awards in various European award competitions.

There was no soundtrack CD released, however part of the score can be found on his 1981 album The Amazing Adventures of Simon Simon. The track is called \\"Part 1 - Nestor's Saga (The Tale of The Ancient)\\". The soundtrack also featured \\"La Bambola\\" performed by the Italian artist Patty Pravo. Critical reception The English-language reviews for Respiro were generally positive. Steven Holden wrote in The New York Times that \\"not since Y Tu Mam√° Tambi√©n has a movie so palpably captured the down- to-earth, flesh-and-blood reality of high-spirited people living their lives without self-consciousness.\\" Writing for Premiere magazine, critic Peter Debruge noted, \\"in the annals of Mediterranean island love stories, Respiro reflects the effortless charm of a film like Il Postino.\\" Critic Desson Thomson of The Washington Post, however, felt \\"its long-winded denouement, in which Grazia runs away rather than be sent to an institution, doesn't bring the story full circle.

The Tyulpan is the largest mortar system in use today.  History  The Tyulpan in deployed position. Following World War 2, the Soviet Union developed two types of heavy infantry mortar in 160 and 240 mm calibres, both conventional albeit breech-loaded designs. Due to do their relatively large dimensions, total mass and the heavy weight of their projectiles (and the M-240 in particular), these mortars could hardly hope to function in the field as infantry weapons, losing the features making such weapons desirable, that is their relatively simple operation, speed of deployment and mobility. To alleviate the obvious mobility concerns, the military leadership proposed to mount the heavy mortar on a self-propelled, tracked chassis with the guns installed externally on the chassis, rather than in an enclosed superstructure or turret. For firing, the gun was to be pivoted at the vehicle's rear and anchored in the ground with the use of a massive recoil-absorbing base plate. Such a solution would help to simplify the overall design and construction of the vehicle and allow for a smaller, lighter prime mover. Initially, designers planned to utilize a common chassis used in the 2S1 Gvozdika self-propelled howitzer, but quickly found it was not robust enough to handle the significant recoil (approx. 400 tonne-force). A formal agreement to initiate work on the new project was signed on July 4, 1967, but preliminary design had been ongoing at the OKB-3 experimental design bureau since 1966 under G. Yefremov. The new vehicle was developed by a team of engineers from the SKB (design bureau) of the Perm Machine Building Plant named after V. I. Lenin, using the M-240 towed mortar as the basis. This weapon has a long history, dating back to 1944 when it was first built, but formally adopted into service only in 1950 after addressing numerous deficiencies in the design. The M-240 was produced since 1958 and built in relatively minor numbers; only approx. 300 guns were built. The weapon weighed 4,150 kg and was loaded from the breech-end after pivoting the tube into a horizontal position, where the breech was locked with a simple breechblock. The mortar was operated by an 11-man crew and could be prepared to fire within 25 minutes, and continue to fire at a rate of approx. 1 round per minute. In the self-propelled variant, the weapon's tube and breechblock remained unchanged, but the base plate was substantially modified and the mortar used a different system of gun-laying gears and drives, which allowed the tube to traverse 41¬∞ in azimuth when elevated to the maximum extent, and only 10¬∞ traverse at the lower limit of elevation. The range of elevation achieved was 50¬∞ to 80¬∞. The mortar tube has a length of 5 m, weighs 1,100 kg with the breechblock, and the total artillery component of the 2S4 has a weight of 3,300 kg. During the design phase, the weapon system carried the designation LP-40. An initial batch of three vehicles was completed in mid-1969 and immediately directed into a factory trials program which concluded in October. The 'Tyulpan' was accepted into service with the USSR two years later, and serial production commenced in 1974. The 2S4 Tyulpan was seen by the west for the first time in 1975, and so received the NATO designation M-1975, whereas its official designation is 2S4. The 2S4 saw action during the conflicts in Afghanistan and Chechnya.War in Chechnya In both conflicts, the \\"Smel'chak\\" (\\"Daredevil\\"), a laser-guided round consistently destroyed targets quickly, precisely, and with only a few rounds. The extreme firepower per round compensates for the Tyulpan's slow rate of fire. There were also, reports that the Tyulpan may have been used by the Syrian Army during the 2012 bombardment of Homs. Although, other reports suggest that the towed 240 mm mortar M240 were used instead.https://offiziere.ch/?p=27127 The largest-caliber mortar system in the world is shelling cities in Syria and Ukraine (2/2). April 25, 2016. by S√©bastien Roblin. And OSCE observers, monitoring movements of equipment in the War in Donbass with an UAV, spotted a 2S4 on territory under control of the Donetsk People's Republic on 4 July 2015.\\"Latest from OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) to Ukraine based on information received as of 19:30 (Kyiv time), 5 July 2015\\" OSCE 2015-07-06  Description  Video of Tyulpan in action The 2S4 Tyulpan designs is based on the GM-123 chassis carrying an externally mounted M-240 240 mm breech-loading mortar on the rear of the hull. The 2S4 uses an autoloader of sort. It has two automated drum- type magazines, capable of holding up to 40 standard high-explosive rounds or 20 long range rocket-assisted rounds. The rounds are fed to the top of the carrier, where they are placed on a track. The mortar then tilts to the horizontal position. The breech opens and a ramming device pushes the round into the breech. The breech closes and the mortar tilts into the firing position. The 2S4 in profile The primary ammunition for the weapon is the high-explosive 53-F-864 mortar projectile which contains 32 kg of explosive charge and has a total weight of 130.7 kg. The GMWZ-7 fuze could be set to have either a delayed action or detonate on contact. The weapon uses a 5-part propelling charge system, which vary the muzzle velocity from 158 to 362 m/s and ensure a range from 800 to 9,650 m. 1970 saw the introduction of a new type of rocket-assisted family of munitions for the M-240, designated ARM-0-3WF2 (or simply 3WF2) which used a new 4BN56 propellant charge to carry a 228 kg high explosive projectile (designated 3F2 'Gagara') to a maximum range of 18 km. Also developed was the 3O8 'Nerpa' cargo mortar round which delivers 14 submunitions fitted with fragmentation warheads which are deployed over the target by miniature parachute, as well as the 'Sayda' incendiary round. In 1983, the capabilities of the weapon were further enhanced with the development of the 1K113 'Smelchak' precision munition system which comprises a 3WF4 round with a 3F5/3W84 projectile that has a range of 9.2 km, weighs 134.2 kg and contains 21 kg of high explosive. The projectile has a seeker head which homes in on reflected laser energy, generated by ground-based 1D15 or 1D20 laser rangefinders. Course corrections are carried out in 0.2 to 3.0 s. The laser target designation system can also be linked by radio with the vehicle/mortar‚Äîand within 5 km of the target‚Äîto allow for a mode of operation whereby the laser illumination activates only once the projectile has been launched, and thus limiting the reaction time of the target and alleviating countermeasures such as laser warning devices. Such a setup makes use of the R-107 portable radio transceiver. One of the more unique aspects of the 2S4 is their nuclear capability. Development of tactical nuclear munitions for the type was initiated relatively late in the service cycle of the vehicle, in 1967, and resulted in the 3BW4 round using a 3B4 nuclear projectile with a yield of approx. 2 kt. This was improved on three years later with the development of a rocket-assisted 3WB11 nuclear round (using a 3B11 projectile with an RD-14 warhead and propelled by a 3M15 rocket motor). Development of a nuclear warhead for the M-240 was technologically limited for a period of time by the small bore of the weapon; miniaturization had only recently allowed for the reduction of the diameter of a nuclear device to a sufficiently small size so as to be used in a field artillery system. To date, the range of these nuclear projectiles has not been published, but the greater weight of such a warhead compared to the conventional mortar rounds compels experts to speculate on a lower range for such a projectile, and thus the questionable, tactical utility of the system. One of the arguments for a nuclear mortar is the fact that the nuclear device would be more reliable, since the acceleration and forces experienced by a mortar round are substantially less than that endured by a howitzer-launched projectile. The carrier for the 2S4 was a dedicated tracked chassis also used with the 2K11 Krug TEL vehicle, and later used as the chassis for the 2S3 'Akatsiya' and 2S5 'Giatsint' self- propelled guns. Having carried out necessary modifications, this vehicle was designated Object 305. It's powered by 12-cylinder \\"V\\"-layout W-54 engine. The tracked suspensions consists of a pair of drive sprockets located at the front of the vehicle, idler wheels at the rear, six pairs of road wheels and four pairs of return rollers. The tracks are 482 mm wide each, with 115 links per tread. The vehicle is equipped with a lightweight bulldozer blade mounted to the underside of the front hull which is used for preparing dugouts for vehicle firing positions. The driver is seated on the left side of the hull, towards the front with the vehicle commander positioned directly behind him in a raised, fixed, armored cupola outfitted with vision blocks for situational awareness, and his hatch. The cupola is ringed by a skate mount that can be used to fix a PKT machine gun which can be configured to fired remotely with the crew buttoned down. The 2S4 has a slow rate of fire, only one round per minute. This is due to the large size of the mortar and the weight of its ammunition ( for a standard HE rounds and rocket-assisted HE rounds). It can also be loaded one round at a time via a small crane, which is most often used to load the magazines or to place specialty rounds onto the loading track. The 2S4 has a range of 9,650 meters using standard high-explosive rounds, but a range of 20,000 meters using extended range munition. In addition to the high explosive rounds, it can also fire armor-piercing, laser-guided and cluster munitions, as well as chemical, neutron and tactical nuclear rounds. The Russians have stated that the chemical and tactical nuclear munitions are no longer in service. The 2S4s crew consist of a driver and the commander, plus an additional 3 support troops are needed to operate the mortar. The additional troops are usually carried by a separate armored personnel carrier. Variants * Modernized variant was introduced into service with Russian military in 2017.

The match held the record for highest-scoring World Cup match until 1954, when Austria beat Switzerland 7‚Äì5 in extra time. __TOC__ The team To Strasbourg, France, where Poland was going to play its first game versus Brazil (5 June 1938), Ka≈Çu≈ºa and Spoida took 15 players: *Ewald Dytko - midfielder (DƒÖb Katowice), *Antoni Ga≈Çecki - defender (≈ÅKS ≈Å√≥d≈∫), *Wilhelm G√≥ra - midfielder (Cracovia), *Edward Madejski - goalkeeper (not representing any club at that time), *Erwin Nyc - midfielder (Polonia Warszawa), *W≈Çadys≈Çaw Szczepaniak - defender (Polonia Warszawa), *Leonard Piontek - forward (AKS Chorz√≥w), *Ryszard Piec - forward (Naprz√≥d Lipiny), *Wilhelm Piec - forward (Naprz√≥d Lipiny), *Fryderyk Scherfke - forward (Warta Pozna≈Ñ), *Ernest Wilimowski - forward (Ruch Chorz√≥w), *Gerard Wodarz - forward (Ruch Chorz√≥w), *Walter Brom - goalkeeper (Ruch Chorz√≥w), *Edmund Giemsa - midfielder (Ruch Chorz√≥w), *Stanis≈Çaw Baran - midfielder (Warszawianka Warszawa). On the roster, there were two athletes who had never before put on a white-red jersey - midfielder Stanis≈Çaw Baran and goalkeeper Walter Brom (who was then 17 years and 4 months old - up to this day Brom is the youngest goalkeeper on FIFA's World Cup list of participants). In Poland, on stand-by reserve, seven players stayed behind. Those were: *Ewald Cebula (≈ölƒÖsk ≈öwiƒôtoch≈Çowice), *J√≥zef Korbas (Cracovia Krak√≥w), *Kazimierz Lis (Warta Pozna≈Ñ), *Edmund Tworz (Warta Pozna≈Ñ), *Antoni ≈Åyko (Wis≈Ça Krak√≥w) *Boles≈Çaw Habowski (Wis≈Ça Krak√≥w), *Jan Wasiewicz (Pogo≈Ñ Lw√≥w). Preparations Brazil By 1930s, Brazil was not regarded as the world's top team. However, Brazil had already had two previous participation in the inaugural FIFA World Cup, and it was still believed to be a very good, high quality team. The Brazilians later proved it - after defeating Sweden (4-2) they finished the 1938 tournament in 3rd place. It was this performance that gained them their reputation and marked the beginning of Brazil as a new football power. Poland Under these circumstances, the Polish team, which had never before advanced to such a level, was supposed to lose the game against the South Americans. Thus, the defeat was not a sensation. However, all fans were surprised at the style with which the Poles played its lone game of the tournament - white-reds got to the extra time, only then losing 5-6. Interesting is the fact that the Polish team was gathered together just a week before the game. This was due to the Polish Football League games - coaches of the teams did not want their best players to leave their sides earlier because in the 1930s, like majority of world's athletes then, most Polish athletes were amateurs - they had to work on a daily basis. Thus, the training camp in WƒÖgrowiec (near Pozna≈Ñ) lasted for a week only - just enough for some players to get acquainted with each other. A few days before the game, the Poles got into the train and went to Strasbourg. Originally, the game was supposed to take place in Toulouse, in southern France. Polish officials, however, issued a complaint stating that the sweltering heat there would be helpful for the Brazilians, who are used to such weather. The game's location was moved to Strasbourg, but not because of the complaint. There were numerous, last moment corrections before the whole tournament. This was due to complications after the withdrawal of Austria, which after the Anschluss was incorporated into Germany. Match Summary First half At 5 p.m. sharp Swedish referee Ivan Eklind blew his whistle for the first time. Strasbourg's Stade de la Meinau was filled with some 15,000 fans, including a several thousand group of Poles - mostly immigrants, who worked in coal mines in northern France. Brazilian fans were not numerous, and the French were mostly rooting for exotic team from South America. Back in those days, teams were mainly concentrated on attack. So it is not surprising that in Ka≈Çu≈ºa's lineup there were as many as 5 forwards (Piec, Wilimowski, Wodarz, PiƒÖtek and Scherfke). Midfielders were G√≥ra, Nyc and Dytko, and the defenders - only Szczepaniak (captain) and Ga≈Çecki. In the goal there was Madejski. It must be mentioned that in 1938, football regulations did not allow any replacements. As Poland lost the game vs. Brazil (5-6), which meant going back home, only the 11 players mentioned above were given the chance to appear on the field. Little is known about the first goal, which Brazil's Leonidas da Silva (also known as Black Diamond- Diamante Negro) scored in 18th minute. There was no description of it in Polish press, Polish participants of the game did not remember it, either. However, we know that five minutes later Ernest Wilimowski dribbled past three defenders and Brazilian goalie Batatais. The latter managed to dump the Pole to the ground, which meant a penalty kick. It was scored in 23rd minute by Scherfke, who aimed at the right corner of the goal. This was the first, historical goal of Polish National Team in FIFA's World Cup. Second half After the first half, the Brazilians were winning 3-1 (goals by Leonidas, Romeu and Peracio) and the Poles were mainly in defense. Halftime was the turning point. First of all, Ka≈Çu≈ºa yelled loudly at his players, then it started to rain. South Americans were having problems on wet, slippery turf, while Wilimowski started his show. In 53rd and then 59th minute, Poland's top-scorer twice beat Batatais, after individual performances, which were described in the press as ‚Äúcircus-like‚Äù. So, in 59th minute the score was 3-3. Soon afterwards, the rain stopped. It was a boost for the Brazilians, who in 71st minute scored (by Peracio). However, a minute before time Wilimowski scored his third goal, which meant extra time. Extra time After a short break, the Brazilians attacked the Polish goal. Two goals by Leonidas (in 93rd and 104th minutes) settled the game for good. Poles, led by amazing Wilimowski, fought back - in the 118th minute he slotted the ball in. During the last minutes, Brazil was desperately defending the result. Even though Wodarz, on a free kick, was close, and then Nyc's shot hit a crossbar, Poland lost 5-6. Leonidas' goal at 93\\" was scored without him wearing the right boot, which tore and was left off his foot in the swampy pitch. The goal was given though, as Brazil played the match with black socks and thus (also due to all the mud which covered the pitch resulting of the rain beforehand), the lack of a boot went undetected by the referee. Details Aftermath The match has some cultural significant in both countries. For Brazil, they went on to win the third place match, after losing to the Italians in the semi-finals. The 3rd place occupation by Brazil was seen to be Brazil's greatest football achievement by the time, and helped boosting football's popularity in the country. It was the 1938 edition that Brazil started to rise to become a football superpower, although it took them 20 years to finally win its first World Cup, against the hosts, which was surprisingly the home country of the referee who officiated the match between Brazil and Poland in 1938. It was Poland's first and only World Cup match in the Interwar period. Poland was later invaded by Nazi Germany and Soviet Union a year later, and Poland suffered significant destruction of its sporting developments, including football. Following the end of World War II, the Polish People's Republic was established under Stalin's control. Thus, Polish football did not make any major impact until their return in 1974, where the Poles surprised the whole tournament by achieving third place, by taking vengeance on the Brazilians in their final match. Polish golden generation by then, was born. Brazil and Poland would meet each other two more times in the FIFA World Cup, and Brazil managed to overwhelm the Poles both times.

(Hijras were granted voting rights in 1994 in India.) Early life She was born visibly intersex and was given a masculine name. Her father, a police superintendent of the Brahmin caste, gave her away shortly after she was born to protect his own social image. She attended only two years of primary schooling but learned 12 languages during her travels. Political career Shabnam Mausi was elected from the Sohagpur constituency in Madhya Pradesh state's Shahdol-Anuppur district. As a member of the Legislative Assembly, her agenda included fighting corruption, unemployment, poverty, and hunger, as well as speaking out against discrimination against transgender people, hijras, eunuchs, cross-dressers and raising awareness about HIV/AIDS. Activism Shabnam Mausi inspired many transgender people in India to take up politics and participate in 'mainstream activities' in India, giving up their traditional roles as dancers, prostitutes, and beggars, living on the fringes of Indian society; for example they sometimes attend weddings or the house of a newborn child offering services to ward off bad luck. Jeeti Jitayi Politics (JJP) In 2003, hijras in Madhya Pradesh established their own political party called \\"Jeeti Jitayi Politics\\" (JJP), which literally means 'politics that has already been won'. The party released an eight-page manifesto to outline its political differences from the mainstream. Popular culture In 2005, a fiction feature film titled 'Shabnam Mausi' was made about her life. It was directed by Yogesh Bharadwaj, and the role of Shabnam Mausi was played by Ashutosh Rana.

He was one of the more colourful and controversial figures in the Catholic Church in Great Britain, and an outspoken critic of Israel and of Zionism. Biography Prior was born in Cork in 1942. Prior joined the Congregation of the Mission on leaving school and took a degree in Physics at University College Dublin, he trained Vincentian Seminary in St Joseph's, Blackrock, completing his theological studies he was ordained in Castleknock College in 1969.Obituary Michael Prior www.knockunion.ie After ordination he studied Semitic Languages, gaining his Licentiate in Sacred Scripture in Rome in 1972. He followed this with a PhD on the theology of St Paul from King's College London. For three years he was director of the Vincentian Formationhttp://vincentians.com/en followed by two years at Bishop Ullathorne Roman Catholic School, Coventry. In 1977, he went to St Mary's College, first as lecturer in theology, then as department head (1987-97), and, from earlier this year, as professor of Theology and Religious Studies.Macpherson Work Prior was an anti-Zionist and believed that biblical scholarship encouraged collusion in the oppression of the Palestinian people. In his book The Bible and Colonialism: a moral critique, Prior argued that the biblical narrative of the Exodus from Egypt and the Conquest of Canaan had been deployed to justify what he considered colonialism in Palestine, the Americas, and South Africa.Macpherson In his book Zionism and the State of Israel: a moral inquiry, Prior developed a moral critique of Zionism, emphasizing its secular roots and the relatively recent character of support for Zionism by religious Jewry. Prior also claimed that the expulsion of the Palestinians, far from being a consequence of the Nazi Holocaust or of the fortunes of war in 1948, had been planned by the founding fathers of Zionism from the beginning. Prior believed that Zionism was morally flawed from 1948, when the first war was fought.Macpherson Published works *Prior, Michael, Western scholarship and the history of Palestine, Melisende, 1998 *Prior, Michael, The Bible and colonialism: a moral critique, Continuum International Publishing Group, 1997 *Prior, Michael, Zionism and the state of Israel: a moral inquiry, Psychology Press, 1999 *Prior, Michael, Aruri, Naseer (Editors), Speaking the truth: Zionism, Israel, and occupation, Olive Branch Press, 2005.

He observes the daily habits of the villagers, and the viewer is shown many sequences about different events: A young man drives his horse and cart filled with milk cans. Normally he would clean the cans, but he's distracted by a girl sitting in the sun. A threshing-machine is harvesting. A cat becomes poisoned and eventually dies. A mole is killed by an old lady ploughing the ground and she gives the mole to her dog. A farmer takes his pig to a sow for fertilization and the two owners watch with satisfaction when the pigs copulate. The men of the village bowl to kill time. The old man is still having hiccups. The village seems idyllic, but there are mysterious things happening. During these events, there are sequences about women trading bottles with unknown liquids. From time to time a man dies and the collective village walks up with a chest and comforts the widow. The postwoman also shows up from time to time and gives the widow her dead mother's pension. It all seems harmless and normal life continues after the burials. When a fisherman disappears, a local policeman is determined to find out what happened to the fisherman and eventually finds out at the end when he sees the mailman appear with a package for the widow. With (almost) no dialogue in the movie, it seems the events around the villagers, animals, and plants have no meaning. However, at the end of the movie there is a wedding where some girls sing an old folksong which reveals the murder- mystery.

The plant is native to East Asia (China, Japan, Korea, etc.). It grows really well in disturbed areas like roadsides or even dirt roads. It is valued for its use in folk medicine and it also can be used in cooking. Common names include Chinese plantain, obako, arnoglossa, and Asiatic plantain. Description The plant is a perennial herb that up to and has short and thick rootstock with numerous fibrous and fasciculate roots. It has short stems with a rosette of broadly ovate to broadly elliptic leaves. Thin or very thin papery leaf blades are long, wide, sparsely pubescent, three to seven veins, obtuse to acute apex, broadly cuneate to surrounded base and decurrent to petiole, margins are entire, repand, serrate or dentate. Petioles long, sparsely pubescent. The plant has erect spikes of high, with many small, white, hairless flowers, and oval sepals that are long, tube corolla with five oval lobes, and four stamens. The fruits are oval-shaped pyxis of high and m wide, which have four black seeds inside that are up to long. The plant can be a weed in uplands, fields and gardens and it can host aphid and red spider. Blooming period: April ‚Äì August, fruiting period: June- September.  Habitat  The plant can grow in many regions, such as mountain slopes, ravines, riverbanks, fields, roadsides, wastelands, lawns.  Cultivation  The plant is hardy, and it can grow in all USDA zones. It likes full sun or part shade, and it can adapt to sandy, loamy, and clay soils with good drainage. Acid, neutral and basic (alkaline) soils are suitable for this plant. Medicinal use Traditionally, the plant was used to treat liver disease, stomach problems and urinary system inflammation. According to traditional Chinese medicine, all parts of the plant are medicine to cool heat and promote urination, cause diuresis, clear damp-heat, brighten the eyes and dislodge phlegm. The leaves and the seeds have anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, antitussive, cardiac, diuretic, expectorant, haemostatic efficacy. The roots can be made into a decoction to treat coughs. Scientific studies have shown that Plantago asiatica petroleum extract has a significant antidepressant effect, and the hot water extracts of P. major and P. asiatica have anti- leukaemia, anti-cancer and anti-viral activities, as well as the activity of regulating cell-mediated immunity. The seed gel extract can work as a lubricant to promote laxation of humans, and the PSE (Plantago asiatica L. seed extract) can contribute to the treatment or prevention of obesity and relative symptoms as a potential dietary supplement. The Plantaginis Semen inhibits the activities of XOD (Xanthine oxidase) significantly, and it can be used in the reduction of hyperuricemia and the treatment of gout. Plantamajoside can be isolated from Plantago asiatica, and it has antioxidant and anti-glycation effects. Thus it can be used to study the effects of natural herbal supplements to prevent diabetic complications. Pregnant women need to avoid using this medicine, which may cause uterine activity and laxation. Patients cannot take lithium or carbamazepine with plantain at the same time. Plantago asiatica can cause side effects, such as anaphylaxis, chest congestion, sneezing, watery eyes, occupational asthma, and gastric concretion.  Toxicology  The pollen has allergenic glycoproteins and components that can bind IgE which can mediated sensitization, contributing to seasonal allergy. Culinary use The plant is suitable for cooking with grains and stews, and it can also be added to herbal wines. The leaves of the plant are used in many Japanese dishes, especially soups.Willcox, Bradley and Willcox, Graig. The Okinawa Diet Plan In Vietnam, the young leaves are boiled, fried, or made into soup with meat or prawns. It also can be fried with salt, or boiled with Yin Chen (Artemisia capillaris herba) to make Yin Chen Tea.

M. Pulham, Esq. is a 1941 American drama film directed by King Vidor and starring Hedy Lamarr, Robert Young, and Ruth Hussey. Based on the novel H. M. Pulham, Esq. by John P. Marquand, the film is about a middle-aged businessman who has lived a conservative life according to the routine conventions of society, but who still remembers the beautiful young woman who once brought him out of his shell. Vidor co-wrote the screenplay with his wife, Elizabeth Hill Vidor. The film features an early uncredited appearance by Ava Gardner. In February 2020, the film was shown at the 70th Berlin International Film Festival, as part of a retrospective dedicated to King Vidor's career. Plot Harry Moulton Pulham Jr. (Robert Young) is a conservative, middle- aged Boston businessman, set in a precise daily routine. He has a proper wife, Kay (Ruth Hussey), with whom he has settled into a comfortable if passionless relationship. However, it was not always that way. When Harry is saddled with the task of organizing a twenty-five-year college reunion, it triggers a flashback to a time more than twenty years earlier. After the end of World War I, his Harvard classmate and friend Bill King (Van Heflin) gets him a job in a New York City advertising company, where he falls in love with a vivacious, independent coworker oddly named Marvin Myles (Hedy Lamarr). However, though they love each other, she cannot bring herself to fit into his traditional idea of a wife's role and he cannot imagine living anywhere other than hidebound Boston. So they break off their relationship. Harry falls in love with and marries a woman from his own social set with the same attitudes and assumptions, someone approved of by his father (Charles Coburn) and mother (Fay Holden). Harry is now profoundly dissatisfied with his dull routine. At breakfast, he begs his wife to go away with him immediately, to rekindle their love. She dismisses the idea as impractical and even silly. Harry calls Marvin and arranges to meet her again after these twenty years. He visits her apartment in the city. There are sparks, and Harry is tempted to have an affair. When she takes a phone call, we realize she, too, is married. They both realize they cannot recapture the past. On the street after his lunch with Marvin, Harry sees his wife in the car trying to get his attention. She tells him she wants to go away with him as he suggested that morning, and he now says it is impractical, but she has canceled her appointments and packed their bags in the car and persuades him to go.

The Duke of York's Laws for the Government of the Colony of New York were a set of guidelines laid out during the early years of English rule in the Colony of New York.Scott, Henry Wilson. The Courts of the State of New York: their history, development and jurisdiction (1909) Context In March 1665, Governor Richard Nicolls convened a convention at Hempstead, Long Island to draft legislation for the colony. The code of laws was introduced into Yorkshire which included Long Island, Staten Island, Manhattan Island, and the east side of the Hudson River coterminous with Westchester.New York: Commissioners of Statutory Revision: Colonial Laws of New York from the year 1664 to the Revolution, including the Charters of the Duke of York, the Commissions and instructions to Colonial Governors, the Duke's Laws, the Laws of the Dongan and Leisler Assemblies, the Charters of Albany and New York, and the acts of the Colonial Legislatures from 1691 to 1775, inclusive.

The change was made much more slowly in the Dutch areas, where certain concessions had been agreed to under the Articles of Capitulation.  Content  The Duke's Laws covered nearly every facet of life in the colony and were published in alphabetical order‚Äîfrom how arrests were to be carried out, how juries were to be picked, to the amount of the bounty paid for dead wolves. Although directed at English and Dutch colonists, the laws also covered what Indians could and could not do. For example, Indians were required to fence in their corn fields and were specifically barred from practicing their own religion. \\"No Indian whatsoever shall at any time be suffered to powaw or performe outward worship to the Devil in any Towne within this Government,\\" one section of the laws said. There are detailed instructions of how churches were to be managed. For instance, a church was to be built in each community, capable of holding 200 people; ministers would have to present their credentials to the government to prove they were not \\"ignorant pretenders to the Ministry.\\" The minister would be required to preach \\"constantly every Sunday and shall also pray for the King, Queene, Duke of York and the Royall Family.\\" Under the laws, a person, \\"either Christian or Indean,\\" who kills a wolf would receive a payment by bringing the head to a constable. The payment would be \\"to the value of an Indean coat.\\" The laws set out rules by which a person could be arrested. For instance, a person could not be arrested on the sabbath. Jurors were to be paid \\"three shillings six pence per diem.\\" One provision states, \\"If any man lyeth with mankind as he lyeth with a woman, they shall be put to Death, unless the one party were Forced or be under fourteen Years of age, in which Case he shall be punished at the Discretion of the Court of Assizes.\\" The laws also required marks, or brands, for horses in each town. Letters were designated in geographic order from east to west: A for East Hampton, B for Southampton, C for Southold, D for Seatalcott (Setauket), E for Huntington, F for Oyster Bay, G for Hempstead, H for Jamaica, and I for Flushing.

It was published by Electronic Arts (EA) and developed by the AKI Corporation and EA Japan. Gameplay Screenshot of SimCity DS, displaying a city on the top screen and the city's map at the bottom screen SimCity DS inherits SimCity 3000s graphics and uses the handheld's dual screens to display additional interfaces. Console-specific features are also prominent, such as the use of the systems' integrated microphone, which is used to blow out fires and the touch screen which is used to control the interface. Before beginning a city, the player must choose a location in the region, one of five advisors and then sign the town charter using the touchscreen and stylus. The upper screen of the DS displays the city and news ticker, while the map, advisor, information and buttons are shown on the touchscreen. Advisors and petitioners SimCity DS features five advisors who help players make proper decisions in the game by providing recommendations and advice. As opposed to previous versions of SimCity, the player must choose only one advisor to help them when they sign the town charter. The different advisors include Julie McSim, Ayako Tachibana, Kaishu Tachibana, Servo 3000 and a secret advisor named Alien. There are also petitioners, many of which are citizens of the players' cities, that approach the player with problems and request solutions or to modify city policies, such as lowering tax rates, or neighbor deals (old coot offers to take trash for $250 per month, Granny Agnes offers to buy water for $500 a month, both last 5 years). They may also give the player rewards or request certain structures to be erected in the city. News ticker In addition to the advisor, a news ticker scrolls along the bottom of the upper screen, displaying pertinent information about the city in the form of news stories, such as indicating that the city needs improvements in certain areas, or how well a particular city department is functioning. Generally, when things were going very well in a city, the news ticker displays headlines which are comical, or even nonsensical and often seemingly useless to the player. Landmarks Independent real-world landmarks (and one fictional landmark) are also prominent in SCDS, but must be unlocked in play or by using passwords. Real-world landmarks featured in SCDS include the Eiffel Tower, Taj Mahal, Big Ben, Statue of Liberty, White House, Grand Central Terminal, Palacio Real, Moai, Capitol Records Building, United Nations Headquarters and Hagia Sophia. Bowser's Castle from the Mario series of video games is also featured. Disasters The game features a number of disasters which the game can inflict upon a city, including earthquakes, fires, giant ape attacks, and UFO attacks. The game also features a \\"Save the City\\" mode in which the player must help one of several cities recover from a disaster and reach a specific target to succeed. Research There are a number of buildings that can only be obtained by spending money on research (found toward the bottom of your exp. budget sheet). Each building grants certain benefits to the city. They require both water and power to function. Research takes both time and funding. For example, even if you devote 200% funding to research you will still not obtain a nuclear power plant if the year is 1909. Zones As with other SimCity games, the player sets zone types, either residential, commercial, industrial, seaport, or airport. Each of these zone types, except for the airport and seaport, can be built in light, medium, and dense varieties. The zoning colors are different from other SimCity games residential is yellow instead of green, commercial is purple instead of blue, and industrial is red or orange instead of yellow. Reception The game received mixed reviews with an aggregate score of 69% in GameRankings. Sequel AKI Corporation went on to develop a Nintendo DS version of SimCity Creator that is treated as an official sequel to SimCity DS in Japan. It was first released there as SimCity DS 2 in March of 2008, several months before it was released in the rest of the world along with its Wii counterpart.

It is popular among Scouts and Girl Guides. Origin In 1905 the song, with Scandinavian spelling of the gibberish, was presented at a New Year‚Äôs cabaret in Gothenburg, Sweden. The lyrics and the melody were presumably derived from student singing in Central Europe. Robert Baden-Powell is often quoted as the originator of the song, but there is no evidence that he was involved in its creation nor its introduction. After early adoption by the Scandinavian Scout organisations, the song became eventually (starting in the 1940s and 1950s) a global hit among Scouts. The 1905 lyrics: > Hinkan, kolikolikolikolifejsan / Kinkan koh, kinkan koh > Hinkan, kolikolikolikolifejsan / Kinkan koh, kinkan koh > Ava, illa shava / O illa shava / Kolifejs! > Ava, illa shava / O illa shava / Kolifejs! > Tjolafalla, tjolafalla!

The Hundred Pu (ÁôæÊøÆ) was a designation of non-Chinese peoples living in the upper Yangtze river area, similar to the Hundred Yue of south Yangtze. The Hundred Pu was eventually conquered by the Ba state. The Qin dynasty invaded the Ba state in 316 BC and absorbed into its empire. The Bo fortress of Lingxiao (ÂáåÈúÑÂüé) on Bowangshan Mountain in Xingwen County were the last hold out in China against the Mongol conquest. It fell to the Mongols in 1288, more than 11 years after the end of the Song dynasty.

He is best known for a historic horseback ride in 1842, where he completed a journey of in 10 days, to request help for the besieged British garrison at Port Natal (now the Old Fort, Durban).   Early years  Dick King was born on 26 November 1811 in Dursley in the English county of Gloucestershire. He died on 10 November 1871 in Isipingo, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.Ancestry.com His family emigrated to the Albany district of the Cape Colony, as part of the 1820 Settlers. In 1828 however his family resettled to the then frontier region of Port Natal, when Dick was about 15 years of age. His first employment was in the clergy. In reverend Francis Owen's company he met Zulu chief Dingane, and also got acquainted with captain Allen Gardiner.  The Voortrekkers  In February , when Dick King was already at Port Natal, Jan Gerritze Bantjes arrived with Petrus Lafras Uys on the \\"Kommissitrek\\" from Grahamstown. Bantjes was Uys's scribe. At Port Natal Bantjes did sketches of the bay area, the Berea and around the Mgeni River and made notes for Uys regarding the potential of the bay as a possible new port and capital of the new Boer homeland they were hoping to start. This was done over a period of weeks. Dick King (22) and Jan Gerritze Bantjes (17) went elephant hunting together with Alexander Biggar who was a professional hunter, (Bantjes was fluent in both English and Dutch) and Dick and Jan Gerritze became well acquainted striking up a friendship during the weeks at Port Natal. Together with Johannes Uys, brother of Petrus Uys, they attempted to visit Dingaan on the land grant issue at Uys' request, but due to the Tugela being in full flood, they were forced to return to their laager at the mouth of the Mvoti River and then back to Port Natal without consolidating the Zulu King's perspective on the issue. On their eventual return to Grahamstown in the Cape, it was Bantjes who at Uys's request, drew up the Natalland (Natalialand) Report that would be the catalyst that started the Great Trek from the Cape to the interior and Natal. Bantjes would later write the famous Retief/Dingaan Treaty that would change South African history forever. Dick King first came to prominence after the 1838 murders of the Voortrekker leader Pieter Retief and his delegation at the kraal of the Zulu chief Dingane. George Champion of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions who heard of the murders notified Port Natal. They sent Dick King to warn his 18-year-old son, George, and others who were 120 miles (200 km) inland at the Voortrekker camps. Dick King departed immediately on foot, accompanied by a number of natives. Despite covering the distance in four days by walking day and night, they arrived just after the van Rensburg voortrekker camp was attacked. They reached the vicinity of the next camp, near present-day Estcourt, just as the attack on it started on 17 February 1838. Though cut off from the Gerrit Maritz laager, he participated in its defence, but was unable to prevent the death of George, who was further inland at the Blaauwekrans river. 600 Boers, including women and children, died in the surprise attacks though others managed to survive the heavy and sustained Zulu onslaughts.  The fateful Biggar expedition  The British settlers at the bay, hearing of the latest attacks on the Boers, were determined to make a diversion in their favour. Two Britons from Port Natal, Thomas Halstead and George Biggar, were among those already killed at Dingane's kraal and Blaukraans respectively. Some 20 to 30 European men, including Dick King, were placed under the command of Robert Biggar. With a following of 1,500 Zulus who deserted from Dingane, they crossed the Tugela river near its mouth and proceeded to uMgungundlovu. After four days they were able to take 7,000 head of cattle from a group of Zulus who fled. The party returned with these cattle to the bay, and discovered that a spy of Dingane had been killed there in their absence. Once again they set off to Dingane's kraal and reached Ndondakusuka village north of the Tugela on 17 April 1838, which belonged to a captain of Dingane, named Zulu. Here, while questioning a captive, likely a decoy, they were closed in by a strong Zulu force led by Dingane's brother Mpande and his general Nongalaza. The English soon found that retreat was impossible, and blundered by dividing their force to oppose their encirclement. The Zulus made a successful dash which split the forces in two. In the desperate situation that ensued, the British force was overwhelmed. Only Dick King, Richard (or George) Duffy, Joseph Brown, Robert Joyce and about 500 Zulus escaped to the bay. Pursued by the Zulu force, all the European inhabitants of Port Natal were compelled to take refuge for nine days on the Comet, a British vessel which happened to lie on anchor in the bay. When the Zulus retired, only Dick King and some seven or eight others returned to live at the port. The missionaries, hunters and other traders returned to the Cape.  Defence of Port Natal  His statue in Durban In 1842 however the British sent a garrison to Durban under the command of Captain Charlton Smith (who also served at Waterloo). The Voortrekkers had in the meantime consolidated their position inland. They established the Boer republic of Natalia and were intent on expelling the British force from the strategic bay area. This soon led to the Battle of Congella, where the English suffered heavy casualties besides the loss of their artillery. The British garrison had to retreat to their tented camp where their only defence was their trenches and earthworks. The camp was besieged by Andries Pretorius who kept up the small arms and artillery attack continuously, day after day. Trader Christopher Cato, who was to become Durban's first mayor, informed Dick King of the situation, who was on the Mazeppa vessel on 25 May. Before daybreak the next morning, King was met by his 16-year-old servant Ndongeni, who brought two horses to the current Salisbury island in the bay. Attached to a boat, the tethered horses swam alongside the boat to the bluff, from where King and Ndongeni escaped. From Port Natal (now Durban), King and Ndongeni started a heroic horseback ride to convey a request from Captain Smith for immediate reinforcements. The journey involved a ride of through the wilderness and the fording of 120 rivers to arrive at Grahamstown. Ndongeni was forced to return halfway through the journey, as he had no saddle or bridle. Dick King reached Grahamstown 10 days after leaving Port Natal, a distance normally covered in 17 days. King returned a month after his escape on the Conch, one of the British vessels which carried the relief parties. It arrived at the bay on 24 June, and the reinforcements were in time to save Smith's garrison from imminent surrender or starvation.  Recognition  Ndongeni received a farm at the Mzimkulu river and King a farm at Isipingo for their services. At Isipingo King managed a sugar mill until his death in 1871. Ethel Campbell conducted an interview with Ndongeni in 1911 from which she learned the details of the epic journey. A statue commemorating Dick King and his journey was unveiled on the north shore of Durban Bay (at ) on 14 August 1915.

His parents, Compagnonus de Guarutti and Amata de Guidiani, were originally unable to have a child, but after praying at a shrine of St. Nicholas of Myra, Amata became pregnant, and they named their son after the saint. The university's student publication, the Tolentine Star, pays homage to the saint.

Majority of the believers in Novi Sad are from Serbian Orthodox Church, while others are from Roman Catholic Church, many Protestant churches, and Jewish community. Stari Grad is the place with the majority of churches and temples, and they are all built in the 18th and 19th century. The oldest religious building in the city was Orthodox church dedicated to Saint John. This church was built in 1700, but was burned in the 1848‚Äì49 revolution. It was rebuilt in 1853, but was razed in 1921. Orthodox churches The main Orthodox church in the City is The Orthodox Cathedral of Saint George (Saborna Crkva svetog ƒêorƒëa), built in 1742, it is next to the Bishop‚Äôs Palace, the seat of the Serbian Orthodox Eparchy of Baƒçka. In city centre there are also the Church of Holy Dormition (Uspenska crkva), built in 1736, Alma≈° Church (Alma≈°ka crkva) in Alma≈°ki Kraj, built in 1797 and Russian Orthodox Church of St. Nicholas (Nikolajevska crkva), built in 1730. There is also Church of Presentation (Vavedenjska crkva) in Petrovaradin, as well as an Orthodox church in Sremska Kamenica, built in 1737‚Äì1758. In the 1990s, at end of the state socialist period in Serbia, numerous new Serbian Orthodox churches were built in Novi Sad's neighbourhoods: in Klisa, Telep, Novo Naselje, Detelinara, Petrovaradin, Paragovo, and Veternik. These new churches are all built in Neo- Byzantine architecture, which is more Balkanic architecture and very different from the older Orthodox churches in the city, which are of a more Central Europe-type architecture. Kovilj Monastery is the only Orthodox monastery in the municipal area of Novi Sad. It is located near the village of Kovilj. It was reconstructed in 1705‚Äì07 and according to the legend, the monastery was founded by the first Serb archbishop Saint Sava in the 13th century.

Built in Gothic Revival architecture, in 1895 on the site of an older church, which was burnt down, it is the tallest temple in the Baƒçka region. There are also two more Roman Catholic churches in the city, one in Telep and one in Grbavica (in Futo≈°ka street). There are also three Catholic churches in Petrovaradin and one in Sremska Kamenica (built in 1746), as well as a Franciscan monastery in Petrovaradin (1701‚Äì1714). Tekije Church in Petrovaradin, built in 1881, is used by all 3 Christian communities in the city: Orthodox, Protestant, and Catholic. There was also one Armenian church dedicated to St. Gregory the Illuminator, which was built in 1746, destroyed during bombardment in 1849, and then rebuild in 1872 with funds of Serbian philanthrope Marija Trandafil. This church was finally demolished in 1963 to make way for new boulevard.

The church is dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary. History Situated on the sloping terrain above the ancient forums of Rome, near the present Via Cavour, by the 14th century, a convent associated with the Clarissan order was located at or near the site. When these nuns abandoned the site to move to San Lorenzo in Panisperna, a frescoed 15th- century image of the Virgin and child with Saints Lawrence and Stephen was uncovered at their former monastery in 1580. Soon the icon was celebrated as miraculous, and became an object of popular veneration, and led Pope Gregory XIII to sponsor the construction of this church. The icon still is displayed over the high altar. A copy is taken in procession through the streets on 26 April each year. In the late 16th-century church was placed under the administration of the Company of the Catecumeni, sponsored by the cardinal Sirlotta. This order ministered to those converting from Judaism and Islam to Catholicism, and staffed the Collegio de Neofiti. In 1634, cardinal Antonio Barberini built the Palazzo dei Neofiti for students of the Collegio next door to the church. In the 18th-century, the purpose of the college would change and be assigned by Pope Clement XI to the Pio Operai.Accurata, E Succinta Descrizione Topografica, E Istorica Di Roma, Volume 1, by Ridolfino Venturini, published by Carlo Barbellieni, Rome (1768); page 36. The church was designed by Giacomo della Porta with a fa√ßade inspired by his prior work of the Church of the Ges√π. It has two rows of Corinthian pilasters that are connected with volutes. (The fa√ßade was renovated in 1991‚Äì92) Above the door is a dedicatory inscription and votive niches. The work was continued by Carlo Lombardi and Flaminio Ponzio. Original to this phase are the statues by Giovanni Anguilla of the four major prophets of the Old Testament in the niches of the dome (1599). The apse was decorated by Giacinto Gimignani and Cristoforo Casolani. The latter also produced the frescoes of the four Evangelists in the dome and the ceiling fresco in the nave depicting The Ascension, Angels and Doctors of the Church (1624). In each of the eight sections of the dome are scenes from the life of the Blessed Virgin by several artists, while in the vault and the arches of the chapels are stucco angels by Ambrogio Buonvicino. In the first chapel to the right are frescoes of the story of San Carlo Borromeo and a Madonna and child with the saint (1624) by Giovanni da San Giovanni. The third chapel has a Walk to Calvary by Paris Nogari. The main altar has a Madonna with child with saints Stephen & Lorenzo from the early 15th century. In the third chapel on the left, is a Nativity by Girolamo Muziano, flanked by an Adoration of the Magi and Dream of St John both by Cesare Nebbia. In the first chapel to the left (north) is an Annunciation (1588) by Durante Alberti. St Benedict Joseph Labre collapsed here in 1783, died in a house behind the church, and was buried in the north transept beneath an altar. An effigy of him was added by Achille Albacini in 1892. His feast is celebrated in the church on 16 April. It has been a parish church since 1824, served by diocesan clergy, and a titular since 1960. Inscriptions in the church record other connections with notable people. St Joseph Calasanctius, founder of the Piarists, after arriving in Rome in 1592 often prayed in the new church before the image of Our Lady. At the request of Pope Benedict XIII, the church and altar were rededicated in 1728 by the pope‚Äôs almoner,Pietro Bergamaschi and Margherita Marchione From the land of the Etruscans; The Life Of Lucy Filippini Edizioni di Storia e Letteratura: Rome 1986, 181. Archbishop Nicola Saverio Albini, titular bishop of Leuce. St Paul of the Cross, founder of the Passionists, said Mass here in the years 1745 to 1767 when in Rome. St Alphonsus Liguori, founder of the Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer, said Mass here from 25 April to 21 June 1762 as a guest of the Congregazione dei Pii Operai (Congregation of Pious Workers), who taught in the school for catechumens nearby at Via della Madonna dei Monti 39. St Vincent Pallotti, founder of the Union of Catholic Apostolate in 1835, was devoted to the Madonna dei Monti and to St Benedict Joseph Labre, buried in the church. Cardinal Vicenzo Pecci, later Pope Leo XIII, donated family money in 1856 to members of the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul who tended the sick poor at the church.

Adams, a neighborhood in Cincinnati, Ohio. The Church is located at 30 Guido Street. The church commemorates the Immaculate Conception and serves the Holy Cross‚ÄìImmaculata Parish in the Archdiocese of Cincinnati. Located at 30 Guido Street, it allows a scenic view of the Ohio River below from one of the highest points in Cincinnati. History Holy Cross-Immaculata Church sitting atop Mt. Adams as seen from the Newport Southbank Bridge. The church interior. The limestone church was built in 1859, just before the American Civil War, for the German congregation in the city's Mt. Adams neighborhood. Archbishop John Baptist Purcell decided to build the church while praying during a severe storm at sea. He promised God that if he survived, he would build a church on the city's highest point. The nearby Holy Cross parish primarily served Irish immigrants. When the Holy Cross monastery closed in 1977, the parishioners joined with Immaculata to become the Holy Cross‚ÄìImmaculata parish. The Mt. Adams Preservation Association raised enough funds to commission the restoration of seven paintings by Johann Schmitt. The paintings were mounted over the main altar and side altars between 1863 and 1870. A painted scroll stretches above the main altar across a depiction of the Immaculate Conception. In German, it reads: :O Maria, ohne Suende empfangen, bitte fuer die Bekehrung dieses Landes, Amerika. ::(O Mary, conceived without sin, pray for the conversion of this country, America.) On December 29, 1978, the Immaculate Conception Church, School, and Rectory was listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The school and rectory have since been closed. In August 2005, workmen began chipping out bricks and glass block where a rose window once stood. The original had been lost in a storm. The new window came from Saint Bonaventure Church, which was closed and torn down in 2003. Fr. Neiheisel and Holy Cross Immaculata pastoral assistant Bill Frantz salvaged a colorful, round, stained-glass rose window that had stood over the altar. Neiheisel then raised $44,000 to have the window reinforced, enlarged with an 18-inch ring of additional glass, and ultimately set into the Holy Cross-Immaculata wall behind a layer of strong, protective glass. Traditions The church's statue of St. Patrick. The Immaculata Church has served since 1860 as a pilgrimage church, where on Good Friday the faithful ascend 85 steps to the church's front door from the neighborhood below while praying the Rosary. An additional 65 steps start at the base of Mt. Adams, with a pedestrian bridge over Columbia Parkway connecting the two paths. The steps were originally made of wood, but in 1911, the City of Cincinnati helped the church build concrete steps. Each year in February members of the Ancient Order of Hibernians knock on the church door and ask permission to remove the statue of St. Patrick. The Priest invokes the intercession of St. Patrick. With bagpipes leading the way the six-foot statue of St. Patrick leaves the church and starts his Mini Parade through Mt. Adams.

Spectral flatness or tonality coefficient, also known as Wiener entropy,The Song Features ‚Ä∫ Wiener entropy \\"defined as the ratio of geometric mean to arithmetic mean of the spectrum\\"Luscinia parameters \\"Wiener entropy is an alternative measure of the noisiness of a signal. It is defined as the ratio of the geometric mean to the arithmetic mean of the power spectrum.\\" is a measure used in digital signal processing to characterize an audio spectrum. Spectral flatness is typically measured in decibels, and provides a way to quantify how tone-like a sound is, as opposed to being noise-like. The meaning of tonal in this context is in the sense of the amount of peaks or resonant structure in a power spectrum, as opposed to flat spectrum of a white noise. A high spectral flatness (approaching 1.0 for white noise) indicates that the spectrum has a similar amount of power in all spectral bands ‚Äî this would sound similar to white noise, and the graph of the spectrum would appear relatively flat and smooth. A low spectral flatness (approaching 0.0 for a pure tone) indicates that the spectral power is concentrated in a relatively small number of bands ‚Äî this would typically sound like a mixture of sine waves, and the spectrum would appear \\"spiky\\".A Large Set of Audio Features for Sound Description - technical report published by IRCAM in 2003. Section 9.1 The spectral flatness is calculated by dividing the geometric mean of the power spectrum by the arithmetic mean of the power spectrum, i.e.: : \\\\mathrm{Flatness} = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt[N]{\\\\prod_{n=0}^{N-1}x(n)}}{\\\\frac{\\\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}x(n)}{N}} = \\\\frac{\\\\exp\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \\\\ln x(n)\\\\right)}{\\\\frac{1}{N} \\\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}x(n)} where x(n) represents the magnitude of bin number n. Note that a single (or more) empty bin yields a flatness of 0, so this measure is most useful when bins are generally not empty. The ratio produced by this calculation is often converted to a decibel scale for reporting, with a maximum of 0 dB and a minimum of ‚àí‚àû dB. The spectral flatness can also be measured within a specified subband, rather than across the whole band. Dubnov has shown that spectral flatness is equivalent to information theoretic concept of mutual information that is known as dual total correlation.  Applications  This measurement is one of the many audio descriptors used in the MPEG-7 standard, in which it is labelled \\"AudioSpectralFlatness\\". In birdsong research, it has been used as one of the features measured on birdsong audio, when testing similarity between two excerpts.Tchernichovski, O., Nottebohm, F., Ho, C.

Radio and 2-Ten FM. Background The pair met at the University of Lincoln when Foxy was a Media Production student and Tom studied Journalism. Both were interested in radio and got involved with the university's station Siren FM when it moved from Kingston upon Hull to Lincoln in 1999. After this Foxy got an overnight weekend slot on his home town station Viking FM and Tom joined soon after as the station's specialist dance show producer. Both were still full-time students at the time. Soon after graduating in May 2001, Foxy started on Viking FM's late show - including the Top Ten at Ten and Late Night Love features. Tom moved to present the weekend overnight slot and worked on specialist dance programmes. Programme director Stuart Baldwin first paired the two together and soon formalised the duo as Foxy and Tom in November 2001. During this stint on the late show they were awarded the NTL Commercial Radio Award for Best Newcomers in 2002. The judges were impressed by their 'deftness of touch' and 'irreverent humour'. When Simon Hirst left Viking's breakfast show in September 2002 for Galaxy Yorkshire, Foxy and Tom were soon announced as his replacement. In 2004 they were nominated in the Sony Radio Academy Awards 'Best Breakfast Show' category. Terry Wogan, Christian O'Connell were among the other nominees in the category won by another former Viking FM duo, JK and Joel. The same year they were listed 10th in Campaign Magazine's Top 10 radio programmes in the UK. In 2005 they beat off competition from Kiss FM's Bam Bam@Breakfast and Kev Seed at Radio City to be named EMAP's best breakfast show. In July 2006, they moved from EMAP to GCap when they started the breakfast show on 2-Ten FM, based in Reading and serving Berkshire and North Hampshire. On 30 November 2007, Tom left the company and the show was re- branded as \\"2ten at Breakfast\\" with a note on the website to say that Tom had 'moved on to pastures new'. John Fox has since moved on from 2ten to present the BRMB, later re-branded FREE Radio, breakfast show.

Life  A view of the balloon of Mr. Sadler's ascending. Print illustrating Sadler's ascent on 12 August 1811. Sadler worked as a pastry chef in the family business, The Lemon Hall Refreshment House, a small shop in Oxford. Sadler was the second person to make a balloon ascent in England, very soon after the Tuscan Vincent Lunardi's flight on 15 September 1784 in the grounds of the Honourable Artillery Company at Moorfields. James Sadler was still the first English Aeronaut, making his ascent the following month, on 4 October 1784 from Christ Church Meadow, Oxford. The balloon rose to about 3,600 feet and landed near Woodeaton, around six miles away. Sadler's second ascent occurred on 12 November, this time in a hydrogen-filled balloon. It reached Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire after a twenty-minute flight. In May of the following year he took off near Moulsey Hurst, Surrey, accompanied by W. Wyndham MP, hoping to reach France, but in fact descending in the Thames Estuary, and thus failing to repeat the earlier exploit of Jean-Pierre Blanchard and his passenger. Sadler made two further ascents in May 1785, the first of which was from a field behind a gentleman's garden on the site of what is now Balloon Street in Manchester. On this flight he was accompanied by a cat and landed in Radcliffe. On his second ascent he travelled alone and having risen to 13,000 ft. travelled 50 miles before landing near Pontefract, West Yorkshire. On this occasion, he sustained bad injuries after being dragged for around 2 miles by the balloon, which eventually threw him clear before taking off again empty. Sadler was appointed Chemist in 1796 in the newly created Naval Works Department under Sir Samuel Bentham. Although the post was only abolished in 1807, he had major disagreements with Bentham and carried out few works. His most important invention was that of the table steam engine.J. E.

He resumed his ballooning activities although he was devastated by the death of his younger son, Windham William Sadler, in a ballooning accident in 1824.J. E. Hodgson. The history of aeronautics in Great Britain. 1924.The Kalaidoscope or Literary and Scientific Mirror, Volume 5, 1825, p 116/117. James Sadler is buried at the church of St Peter-in-the-East in Oxford, now part of the college St Edmund Hall.  Legacy  Although a celebrity in his own time, Sadler is largely unknown today. This has been partly attributed to his lack of writing any works and partly to class prejudice: he was only a pastry chef and not formally educated. Despite being a resident of Oxford and an accomplished scientist, the university mostly ignored him and academics looked down on him. While obituaries for Sadler were written elsewhere on his death, the university's own newspaper wrote simply, \\"Mr James Sadler, elder brother of Mr Sadler of Rose Hill, Oxford, has died.\\" A public square in Manchester was named after Sadler on 8 September 2015 by NOMA, which is a neighbourhood being developed in partnership by The Co-operative Group and Hermes Investment Management.

As a Presbyterian, he resisted the efforts of King James VI of Scotland (later James I of England) to unite the Presbyterian Church of Scotland with the Episcopalian Church of England. As a result he was persecuted for many years. Family He was the third son of Hugh Munro, 1st of Assynt, and grandson of Robert Munro, 14th Baron of Foulis. His mother was Christina, a daughter of Robert Munro of Carbisdale. John Munro married Euphemia, a daughter of Andrew Munro, 5th of Milntown, a cousin of her husband. They had no children. A brother of John was Robert Munro, minister of Creich from 1609 to around 1640. Early years He was educated for the ministry at St Andrews University, graduating as MA in 1590. He was granted the Chaplainry of Newmore to help pay or his university studies, in accordance with the plans of the reformer John Knox. In 1591 he was a member of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. Subsequently he was presented to parish of Tain in 1599, and the charge of St Duthus Church in the burgh. Among the emoluments of this parish were the chaplainries of Newmore, Tarlogie, Cambuscurry, Morangie and Dunskaith. He was also appointed a Sub-Dean of the Diocese of Ross. Resistance to the union of Churches, 1605-07 In 1605, King James attempted to unite the Presbyterian Church of Scotland with the Episcopal Church of England. In order to prevent the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church blocking this, he placed it under an interdict to prevent it from meeting. The Parish of Tain was one of the Presbyteries which opposed the proposed union, and in defiance of James' interdict, they sent John Munro as representative to an Assembly at Aberdeen on 2 July 1605. On that occasion he was nominated as Moderator. King James had declared the Aberdeen Assembly seditious, so it did little more than convene then disperse, though the fact it had met at all was in defiance of the King. The 19 ministers who had attended the Assembly were summoned before the Scottish Privy Council. Ten of these submitted to the King, while the other seven, John Munro among them, maintained that the Assembly had been a lawful one. These seven dissenting ministers who appeared were banished throughout Scotland, each as far as possible from their own parish. One of them, John Welsh of Ayr, the son-in-law of John Knox, was banished to France. John Munro was to be sent to Kintyre, but in the meantime was imprisoned in Doune Castle, Perthshire, with another of the ministers. With the aid of the Constable of the castle, who was subsequently imprisoned for his actions, John escaped. In 1607 he and 13 others were again summoned before the Privy Council, appearing on 20 May of that year. However, while waiting on the judgement of the Council they went into hiding in Edinburgh, and quietly left the city before they could be arrested. As a result they were declared rebels. In the meantime, King James had been successful in suppressing all but a small number of the dissenters to his plan. However, his success was later undone when the Puritans under Oliver Cromwell came to power in 1649. Later years Following his flight from Edinburgh in 1607, Munro made his way to Tain and resumed his ministry among the people there, though without the stipend previously paid by the Crown. He continued to live and minister to the people there for many years after. On 24 May 1610, the Scottish Privy Council sent a letter to the Provost and Bailies of Tain, admonishing them for permitting the Munro to remain living among them and to continue preaching unmolested. What action was taken is not known, but Munro was still in Tain twenty years later in 1630, though he died shortly afterwards.

Historically it was the centre of the medieval Kharagpur Raj chieftaincy. Geography Haveli Kharagpur is located at . It has an average elevation of 48 metres (157 feet). It is well connected from all three directions (the fourth i.e., the west side has the forest) only 20 kilometers from Bariarpur railway station in the north, 30 kilometers from Jamui railway station in the south and 14 kilometers from Tarapur in the east direction. It is close to Jamalpur Hills, its elevation is little higher than Munger, so it never suffers from flood. It is surrounded by small hills which gives the views to this city. Agriculture Since it lies within the Indo- Gangetic Plain area, and hence \\"The Gangetic Alluvium\\" soil is found in this area which is very fertile. Because the land here is very fertile, people grow four crops a year. Almost anything grows at a rapid rate because of the rich soil. The most common are rice, wheat, maize, arhar, and several vegetables. Some people also grow lentils and sugarcane although there has been a serious decline in the sugarcane plantation since the sugarcane industry crashed because of the neglect of the government. History It has references in Mahabharata when Pandavas had to face an exile with disguise (the agyatvasVirata Parva). Then Pandavas came to hide in the hills of Jamalpur which is on the southern side of Haveli Kharagpur. People who go to Baidyanath Temple during the holy month of Shraavana start from Sultanganj and go via Tarapur but while returning they come via Jamui and Haveli Kharagpur. It is customary to visit the Panchbadan Temple while returning. Haveli Kharagpur has a rich history and was one of the central points of administration during and pre-British Raj. It was a coveted place for the kings who built Mansion (and hence the name 'Haveli'). According to the Bihar and Orissa District GazetteersO'malley, Lewis Sydney Steward. Bihar And Orissa District Gazetteers: Monghyr. Concept Publishing Company, 2007. Haveli Kharagpur was surrounded by Mahalat Kharagpur (an extensive estate on the revenue roll of Bhagalpur). When Raja Rahmat Ali Khan fell into arrears of revenue in 1840, he sold Haveli Kharagpur along with Mahalat Kharagpur to Raja Bidyanand Singh. Raja Bidyanand Singh was the grandfather of the contemporary proprietors of Raj Darbhanga. Modern History During the British Raj, many brave-hearts from this area participated in the freedom of India movement even when it was not very influenced with the British Rule. Monghyr had huge British presence with administration run from the fort of Monghyr. But Haveli Kharagpur remained very isolated and was a refuge to freedom fighters and strategists who wanted to bring down the government in Monghyr. Post independence it was declared a sub-divisionAdministrative divisions of India which is Tehsil. It is the office of a sub-divisional officer (an IASIndian Administrative Service ranked officer). Bhoodan movement saw a lot of volunteers and donators from this area. Post 1980s, very little attention was given to this place which resulted in poor literacy among masses. Local Visionaries tried to revamp by building colleges Hari Singh College, and RSK High school, but government support was not there. After decades, this place got a Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya and recently DAV schools has been opened as well.And in recent 2016 government polytechnic college is established .Despite being ignored by the government, this place continues to be a home of hard-working people and there has been rapid rise in the economic levels of people in this area. Digital communication has played a very major role in this part. The biggest issue impeding the progress of this place is poor-connectivity. Although it is well connected on three sides, the roads are not wide and not maintained. This results in high latency in transportation and hence lack of large scale business. There is also a huge presence of naxals which has been overlooked by every government. Demographics India census, Kharagpur had a population of 26,910. Males constitute 53% of the population and females 47%. The average literacy rate is 47%, lower than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 55%, and female literacy is 39%. In Kharagpur, 18% of the population is under 6 years of age.Kharagpur city also has major banks and ATMs like the State Bank of India, Bank of india, and the Punjab National Bank. River & Lake There is lake known as Kharagpur Lake. It is only 3-4 km far from the bus stand in the west direction. Bhimbandh Wildlife Sanctuary is a picnic spot. The place BhimBandh is a natural picnic spot where Bhima (and hence the name Bhimbandh) along with his Brothers (Pandavas) stayed during agyatvas.Agyatvas (a period of disguise) was a period where they had to hide from the public and if seen they will have to be in exile for another 12 years. This is tourist place for Haveli Kharagpur hill area. It is also a picnic spot in winter season where people enjoy spring of hot water, specially during the week of Christmas, New Year, and Makar Sankranti. Kharagpur also has Rameshwar Kund inside the Bheemm band forest. Religious Places There are several temples of historical importance in Haveli Kharagpur. The most prominent one is the Lord Shiva temple called \\"Panch badan sthan\\" which is unique among all the temples of Lord Shiva in the sense that one can see the five face of lord Shankar in its shivling. During the month of Shraavana it is frequently visited by tens of thousands of devotees. It is also frequently visited by the devotees returning from Baidyanath Temple. There is a Kali Mandir in the central town which is frequently visited by locals all the year. During the course of Durga puja and Kali puja, it is frequented by tens of thousands of devotees. Another local temple is Thakurbari, meaning place of lord Krishna. There is a mosque which is close to the post-office and police station, it was built by Raja Rahmat Ali Khan. Tourism This place sees a large number of tourists during the holy month of Shraavana who return via Jamui to take the train at Bariarpur railway station. Most tourist are from Bihar because they know this place. There are several natural attractions like Bheem Bandh, Kharagpur Lake, Devghara Hill, Panchbadan Sthan, Jodi Talai etc. Due to the lack of hotels only those people who have relatives/connections in this area can stay overnight. To visit this place people either come via Jamiu railway station, Jhajha Railway station or Bariarpur railway station. Some trains do not stop at Bariarpur but all the trains will stop at Jamalpur which is only 16 Kilometers from Bariarpur and one can take auto service to get to Bariarpur. From both Bariarpur and Jamiu there is frequent bus/auto services to Haveli Kharagpur. Both Bariarpur and Jamiu have hotels to stay overnight.

Monster Hunter Freedom 2 is not a direct port of Monster Hunter 2 but instead a portable update of the Monster Hunter series. New features have been added while others were removed to make the game appropriate for its portable platform. It was released in North America on August 28, 2007. Its Japanese counterpart is called . An expanded version of the game, Monster Hunter Freedom Unite, was released in North America on June 22, 2009. Gameplay Most Quests in Monster Hunter Freedom 2 involve killing one or two 'Boss' class monsters. Smaller quests at the beginning will involve gathering items and killing small creatures. Quests are generally divided into three difficulty levels: those from the Village Chief, known as 'Elder' quests; those for a lower Hunter Rank (HR3 or lower) from the Guild; those for hunters who have obtained higher Hunter Ranks (HR4 or above), also from the Guild, and lastly there are Treasure hunting Quests given by Treshi the Treasure Hunter. Hunters can always accept quests that are available for the same or lower Hunter Rank, but cannot take quests or join quests initiated by other higher Ranked players, unless they have the required Hunter Rank (i.e. if an HR5 player initiates a quest requiring an HR of 4, HRs 4, 5 and 6 may join while HRs 1, 2 and 3 may not). There are also quests offered by the village's Training School. Quests offered by the Training school require no items or equipment; pre-made equipment and item sets are supplied. Treasure hunting quests are gathering quests with rare items that you cannot keep but are awarded points to add to your ending score, which you are rewarded for. The quests that are taken from the Village Elder are quests specific to single player, so they are also sometimes considered \\"lower\\" rank quests. Monsters inside these quests are weakened in terms of their hit points to suit a single hunter quest, but they only offer basic materials that can only create weapons of lower rarity. Lower Hunter Rank quests from the guild offers the same materials as Elder quests, but they allow up to 4 Hunters via ad-hoc play or XLink Kai. Monsters have slightly increased hit points in this type of quest. Higher Hunter Rank quests are considered the most difficult in the game, and are the equivalent of 'G' rank missions in Monster Hunter Freedom and Monster Hunter G. Besides considerable hitpoint increases, monsters have greatly increased damage and can feature new attack moves, making them harder to defeat. Many of the rarest materials can only be found in this type of quest. These rare materials can be used to create rare and powerful equipment that can kill monsters easier, but in return you will start in a random area and supplies will not be delivered until the battle is nearly done. Downloadable quests often provide special materials that can create bonus equipment that cannot be created otherwise. Reception Monster Hunter Freedom 2 received \\"average\\" reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. As of March 31, 2008, the game has sold 2.15 million copies, according to Capcom. As of July 9, 2008, the game has sold 1,701,980 copies in Japan, according to Famitsu.

The producers of the film are David Furnish, Steve Hamilton Shaw of Rocket Pictures and Martin F. Katz of Prospero Pictures. Elton John serves as one of the executive producers. It's a Boy Girl Thing was produced by Elton John's motion picture company Rocket Pictures and independently distributed by Mel Gibson's Icon Productions and was released on 26 December 2006 in the United Kingdom and has since then been released in some countries in cinemas, in others directly to DVD, and in others as a TV film. Most of the school scenes were shot at Western Technical-Commercial School in Toronto. Plot Woody Deane (Kevin Zegers) and Nell Bedworth (Samaire Armstrong) are neighbors and former childhood friends who go to the same high school, but are otherwise completely different. Woody is a popular varsity football player while Nell is a girl who loves literature but lacks social skills. They loathe each other and are constantly in dispute. One day their class goes on a school trip to a museum and they are forced to work together on an assignment. They quickly begin arguing in front of a statue of the ancient Aztec god Tezcatlipoca. As they argue, the statue casts a spell upon them‚Äîcausing them to wake up in each other's bodies the next morning. When they arrive at school, they immediately blame each other for the body swap, but agree to pretend to be the other person until they can find a way to switch back. At first, they seem to succeed, but quickly return to arguing when they each feel the other is misrepresenting them in the opposite body, such as Woody (in Nell's body) answering a question oddly and surprising a teacher. The following day, Nell (in Woody's body) arrives at school wearing \\"Chinos and an Oxford cotton button-down\\" making Woody's appearance look \\"dorky\\" which frustrates Woody, and he is even more frustrated after he hears about how Nell (in Woody's body) failed Woody's football practice the previous day. As payback, Woody (in Nell's body) dresses in inappropriate and provocative clothing the following day. After school, Nell, in retaliation, breaks up with Breanna (Brooke D'Orsay), Woody's girlfriend, much to the disappointment of Woody. The humiliation competition continues when Woody (in Nell's body) drives off with a biker boy, Nicky (Brandon Carrera), and makes Nell think she is going to lose her virginity. However, Woody decides it is \\"so gay\\" and leaves Nicky just as he is removing his clothing. The following day, rumors are being spread around school by Nicky about his night with Nell. When Nell finds out, she gets very upset. When Woody finds Nell, he admits that he didn't actually lose Nell's virginity and that everyone was simply spreading Nicky's lies. However, Nell is still let down and so Woody decides to confront Nicky. It turns out that Woody (in Nell's body) can't fight him, and Nell (in Woody's body) runs up and punches him in the face. After this, Nell and Woody reach a truce and realize the statue of Tezcatlipoca at the museum had something to do with their body swap. They head down to the museum and even after confronting the statue, they fail to return to their original bodies. They realize they are going to have to help each other in two important upcoming events. Nell must learn how to play football for Woody's Homecoming game and Woody must learn about poetry and literature for Nell's Yale interview. Later that night Nell (in Woody's body) is getting drunk at a party while Woody (in Nell's body) is stuck at a slumber party listening to all the gossip about himself, and is surrounded by nail polish, pajamas, slippers, and gets a bikini wax. After spending so much time together, Nell and Woody become very fond of each other and start to understand each other better. The night before the interview and the game, they agree to go to the Homecoming Dance together, as \\"not a date.\\" The day of the interview and match, Woody goes to Yale for the interview and at first messes things up and is asked to leave, but he starts to talk about poetry in rap, which impresses and astonishes the interviewer. After that, he goes to the football game and watches Nell run in the winning touchdown in the closing seconds. A college recruiter witnesses his good performance and wants to talk to him later. After the game, they congratulate each other for their successes. Shortly after this, the spell lifts and they return to their original bodies. The scene finishes with Woody being kissed by Breanna and Nell going home very upset about it. The following day, Woody tries to talk to Nell, but is stopped by her mother, who sees Woody's family as uneducated. Nell receives an acceptance letter from Yale, meaning that her interview (done by Woody in her body) was successful; however, she is still upset with Woody and decides not to go to the Homecoming Dance. Meanwhile, Nell's father has a talk with her on the porch about Woody, during which she confesses she truly likes him, and her father surprises her with a dress and shoes for the dance. Woody and Breanna are selected as the Homecoming King and Queen. As the Homecoming King and Queen prepare to dance, an upset Woody sees Nell and both confess their love for each other. They leave the school together and share a kiss in front of their houses. The following day, Nell tells her mother that she is taking a year's sabbatical before attending Yale, and hops into Woody's car as they drive off together.

It is situated at the estuary of the Panchagangavalli River. It is located on a peninsula on the west coast of Karnataka. It is bordered by the river to the east and by the Arabian Sea to the west. The town name was originally spelled as \\"Ganguli\\", but then gradually since it is now more commonly spelt as \\"Gangolli\\". The postal seal however still uses the old spelling.  History  Situated at the mouth of an estuary where 5 rivers(Souparnika River, Varahi River, Kedaka River, Chakra River, and Kubja River) meet, Gangolli hence was earlier called \\"Panchagangavali\\". The local Kannada versions of those river names are Kollooru hole, Haladi hole, Rajadi hole, Vandse hole and Hemmadi hole. During the turmoil in the Vijayanagar Empire following its defeat at the Battle of Tallikota in 1565, Gangolli came under the rule of the Nayakas of Keladi from Keladi who until then were vassals/chieftains of Vijayanagara but seized the opportunity to break away and declare independence as the Bednore Kingdom.Arabian Seas By R. J. Barendse The population and activity around Gangolli at the time was scanty as most of the surrounding area continued to be densely forested. The people living in and around Gangolli were predominantly Veerashaivas, Jains and their occupations being agriculture and fishing. Basrur, further inland from Gangolli was a more prominent place being mentioned even in the writings of 13th century traveller Ibn Battuta. Around 1560, a large number of Portuguese & Goan Catholic families migrated to Gangolli and further south. These affluent migrants purchased large portions of land from individual residents and also directly from the Keladi Vassal Sadashiva Nayaka under whose patronage they cleared forested areas to accommodate themselves. Their purposes were to build homes, pursue agriculture and to continue trade. Their pioneering contribution to the development of the region was quick in coming as they resumed their old trade now from a new base in Gangolli and Basrur (referred to then as Barcelor) making Gangolli into a prime maritime location at the time. The patronage provided by the Keladi Nayakas to the Christian immigrants was not appreciated by the over-zealous Goa Inquisition focused Portuguese administration in Goa at the time. However, in and around Gangolli the relationship and inter-dependence between the local rulers and their new enterprising subjects was deepening by the day especially after the Keladi Nayaks staked claim to independence in 1565. Many of the gun wielding, horse trading/riding men joined as mercenaries to fight alongside Keladi armies, offered services on trading & tax collecting ships or trained the armies of the Keladi Nayaks on the use of firearms and open-sea warfare. It will be interesting to note that in subsequent years Christian persons in the area would be addressed as 'Nayak' or 'Naik' and this tradition continues to this day. It is believed that the first church in South Kanara came up on the Gangolli Bunder around 1560 which was in effect just a prayer hall without a tabernacle as there was no priest around there at the time. Aware of Gangolli's rapid development in recent times, during the reign of Virabhadra Nayaka(1629‚Äì1645) the Portuguese captured Gangolli in 1629 under the command of Miguel de Noronha, 4th Count of Linhares. He built a fort at the mouth of the estuary in Gangolli and dedicated it to St. Michael (Michael (archangel)). He also commissioned the building of a small but proper church dedicated to the Immaculate Conception. Upon the completion of this church in 1630, the old prayer hall on the Bunder was razed to the ground and the new church was re- dedicated to Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception. Shivappa Nayaka ascended the throne in 1645 after Virabhadra. He ran several campaigns to regain territories lost over the years. By the year 1654 he managed to push the Portuguese back and reclaim now a fortified Gangolli and Honnavar then also called Onore.European Warfare, 1494-1660 By Jeremy Black Shivappa in his fury also ordered that the small Church building built by them in 1630 be destroyed. This act literally undid the kingdom as instability hit the Keladi Nayaka dynasty. Within the next 3 years, Shivappa's 15-year reign came to an abrupt end in 1660. In the following 12 years, 3 rulers came and went as the dynasty began to crumble - Chikka Venkatappa Nayaka (1660‚Äì1662), Bhadrappa Nayaka (1662‚Äì1664) & Somashekara Nayaka I (1664‚Äì1672). Muscat was traditionally one of the main Arab ports trading with the entire west coast of India. A Muscat port log of 1672 reveals that Muscat has 16 ships that came in from Sind, 4 from the Malabar, 4 from the Makran Coast, 1 from Karwar, 2 from Patan, 2 from Pate, 14 from Konkani Ports, 2 from Mocha, 2 from Surat & Broach, 2 from Maldives, 16 from Kung and the highest - 27 from Bhatkal, Barcelor (Basrur via Gangolli) & Mangalore. In 1672, the widow of Somashekara Nayaka, Keladi Chennamma (also referred to as Chenammajji or Chennammarani) took over the dynasty after the death of her husband. While the financial gains of the kingdom bloomed, the personal losses with rapid successive deaths of its rulers was going unchecked. In a move to ward off the misfortune that had befallen the dynasty, she was advised by her ministers to immediately facilitate the reconstruction of the Church destroyed by Shivappa Nayaka. Without a delay, she donated land and urged the Christians to rebuild the Church. Almost miraculously then, the tide turned. The dynasty stabilized and her rule continued unhindered thereafter for the next 12 years and the Keladi Dynasty continued until it was among the last to lose autonomy to the Mysore Rulers in 1757 and then subsequently to the British. On one occasion in 1697 however, a fleet of Arabs from Muscat went on a rampage damaging temples and sacking areas from Gangolli, Kundapur to Basrur when they were refused royal permission to set up a factory there. By 1799, the worst was over. With the death of Tipu Sultan some of the battered Christian survivors returned but only to find that their wealth and properties were all gone. Some survivors did get back some of their land holdings or houses. Not all were that lucky. But nonetheless, they all had to start all over again. The task of rebuilding the church also began. Under the Vijayanagar rulers, Gangolli had been a transit town for ships going further inland to Basrur. Trade was primarily with the Portuguese and the Arabs of Muscat. Horses, dates came inland in exchange for rice, pepper and kitchen vessels primarily of copper. By 1680 Gangolli had lost out to Mangalore as a preferred trading port due to the fact that even large sea faring vessels could go into the broad and up to 17-fathom-deep Netravali River and load rice. Later under British rule Gangolli developed as a major trading and export centre. It had business connections with Bombay, Kerala, Gujarat, the Middle East, Lakshadweep and Tanzania. Rice, jaggery and coconut were the major exports. After Indian independence in 1948, the village continued to be a trading centre, but trading activities suffered due to the construction of National Highway 17 (India) or NH-17 (recently renumbered as NH-66) and the introduction of modern transport systems, replacing shipping. Fr Paul D.G. Rego started the Labour School on 1 October 1949. Fr Michael Noronha constructed St Joseph Primary and Stella Maris Girls‚Äô High School. Fr Thomas D‚ÄôSa constructed the new school building at Kannada Kudru. Fr Felix Noronha did the renovation of the school building in December 2001. A new school building was constructed and computer education was started at the elementary school.http://www.mangalorean.com/ekata/cdetail.php?chid=46 From the 1980s it developed as a major fishing centre with the introduction of mechanised fishing. It has now become the second largest bunder in Karnataka. Presently more than 200 boats are moored here. Today, the glory of Gangolli and its people has dimmed. What remains is a large fishing village of sorts. However, peace has prevailed for over a century since as people of all faiths now live peacefully and in complete harmony. This peace and friendship is possibly the truest wealth of this historic land.  Culture  Language The main languages used here are Kannada, Nawayath, Dakhini, Konkani and Beary. Hindu The oldest temple of the Village is Sri Veereshwara Temple located at the heart of Gangolli, worshiping Lord Shiva. The historic Sri Venkataramana temple, popularly known as Malyara Mutt, is also one of the oldest places of worship in the region. It was known to be built during the Vijayanagar time. Along with this Sri Mahankali Temple, known as Kanoji Mutt, having the centuries of history is also famous temple in the Talluk. Maari Jathra (Maari pooja) is a big celebration in this temple, celebration will be held on 2‚Äì3 days. Other major temple in the village are, Sri Nagareshwari Temple, Sri Indudhara Bhajana Mandir, Sri Vijaya Vittal Temple. Muslim Mosque and Madrasa There are total of ten mosques in Gangolli. Major mosque in the area is known as Jummah Masjid (see Jama Masjid). Also there are more than ten madrasa in this area. The major madrasa is Misbah-ul-Uloom. Festival Muslims also contribute major part in the cultural integrity of Gangolli. They celebrate Eid al-Fitr, Eid al-Adha (Big Festival of Muslim) and Eid Milad festivals. Christian One of the oldest Church of Kundapur Taluk is located in Gangolli. It is known that the Church was built by Portuguese in the 17th Century.

Cherdyn is said to have been its capital.Article on Cherdyn at uraltourism.com. The origin of the name Perm is uncertain. While the city of Perm is a modern foundation named for Permia, the town of Cherdyn was reportedly itself known as \\"Great Perm\\" in the past. Cherdyn acted as a central market town, and it is sometimes suggested that perm was simply a term for \\"merchants\\" or \\"market\\" in a local language,Ferdinand Heinrich M√ºller, Der ugrische Volksstamm, oder Untersuchungen √ºber die L√§ndergebiete am Ural und am Kaukasus, in historischer, geographischer und ethnographischer Beziehung (1839), 334. but there have been other suggestions.E.g. Allan S. C. Ross, \\"OWN Bjarmar : Russian Perm\\", Leeds Studies in English and Kindred Languages 6 (1937), 5-13. Ross (1937) suggests that the name is from an Old Norse term for \\"edge, shore\\", the bjarmar being the \\"people from the edge\\", a name which would then have been taken over by the population and changed to permi. The same name is likely reflected in the toponym Bjarmaland in Norse sagas.Reallexikon der germanischen Altertumskunde, vol. 33, p. 425. The general region of Great Perm was known as wisu (ŸàŸêŸäÿ≥ŸèŸà wƒ´s≈´) in medieval Arab ethnography, so referred to in the works of Ahmad ibn Fadlan, Al-Gharnati, Zakariya al-Qazwini and Yaqut al-Hamawi (in his Dictionary of Countries). The term is perhaps derived from the name of the Ves' people who settled around Lake Ladoga and the upper Sukhona River.Janet Martin, 'Treasure from the Land of Darkness:The Fur Trade and its significance for Medieval Russia',1986,page 7  Principality of Great Perm  The Principality of Great Perm (, Velikopermskoye knyazhestvo; ) emerged as a separate Komi-Permyak feudal entity in the 14th-15th centuries owing to the easing of the Novgorod Republic. The principality retained a degree of autonomy under the Muscovite rule, but was eventually absorbed into it in 1505. The principality was located in the Upper Kama area and maintained close connections with nearby Perm of Vychegda (alternatively known as Perm the Minor). Both Perm states had paid tribute to the Novgorod Republic since the 9th or 10th centuries. Perm of Vychegda was Christianised by Stephen of Perm in the fourteenth century and subsequently subdued by Muscovy. In 1451 a House of Princes of Perm gained control of both territories as vassals of Moscow, with the titles of princes Vymsky, and princes Velikopermsky. In fact even though having been Christianised soon after Perm of Vychegda, Great Perm enjoyed greater independence, positioned between three powers: Moscow, the Novgorod, and Kazan. Finally in 1472 an army of vassals of Moscow with the princes Vymsky among them conquered Great Perm and captured their brother Prince Mikhail Velikopermsky. Nevertheless, the latter soon came back again from Moscow as governor and ruled his domain for life. His son Matthew Velikopermsky was finally deposed by the Grand Prince of Moscow in 1505.Article on Great Perm at heritage.perm.ru . Up to the early 18th century, the name Great Perm was officially used of the Upper Kama area, a southern part of which was governed by the Stroganov family. The name was borrowed (as the 'Permian' period) by the nineteenth century geologist Sir Roderick Murchison to refer to rocks of a certain age, following extensive studies which he conducted in the region.

Her father was a portrait painter; her patroness was the Princess of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen, who adopted her in 1841 and sent her to Vienna to study music for three years on account of her fine voice. She became deaf, and returned to Sondershausen, living for 11 years at court as a companion to her patroness. Her correspondents were struck with her attractive style, and encouraged her to write novels. For this purpose, she returned to Arnstadt in 1863, and there began her career as a novelist.

Publication history Page from Samson Comics #1 (1940), origin of Samson After appearing in Fantastic Comics in 1939, Samson was given his own title in the fall of 1940. He simultaneously appeared in Big 3 comics, along with the Flame and the Blue Beetle. Samson's origin story was revealed in Samson comics #1. Fantastic Comics ceased publication in November 1941 with issue #23. After six issues, Samson comics was changed to Captain Aero (September, 1941) and Samson no longer had his own title. Finally, Samson was replaced in Big 3 comics in issue #7 (Jan. 1942; this issue proved to be last) by the patriotic hero V-Man. A short-lived revival appeared in 1955 from another publisher, Ajax-Farrell. Samson is among the public domain characters Image Comics revived in a new anthology title, The Next Issue Project, which premiered in December 2007.Comic Book Resources (July 20, 2007): \\"The Golden Age is Back in 'The Next Issue Project'\\", by Jonah Weiland Another version of the character is slated to appear in the October issue of Savage Dragon.

Background Samson (he had no secret identity, although he was called \\"Sam\\" the few times he was shown wearing street clothes) was a direct descendant of the biblical figure. Like his ancestor, Samson had immense strength and endurance, but could lose his powers when his hair was cut. Samson only learned about his heritage when he was a grown man, after his mother revealed his ancestry. While in college, his friend Professor Brun showed him a new invention, an \\"iconoscope\\", which allowed the viewer to watch remote scenes without a transmitter. The iconoscope picked up the image of an eastern holy man, who was praying for a higher power to send someone to battle evil. Samson used his superpowers to visit the holy man, and agreed to be that champion. According to Jess Nevins' Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes, Samson fights \\"giant robots, monsters, mad scientists, thugs, dinosaurs, dictators, warmongers, zombies, and radium thieves.\\" Kurt Mitchell and Roy Thomas write, \\"Pitting his superhuman strength against whole armies, Samson's feats outdid the contemporary Superman but he was far more ruthless, killing his foes barehanded without batting an eye.\\" In issue #10 of Fantastic Comics, Samson gained a young orphan sidekick whom he named David (his real name was unrevealed). David had no apparent superpowers yet was the sole survivor of a plane crash. Orphaned after the crash, Samson took him into his care. David's role mainly consisted of being rescued by Samson after being captured by criminals. Powers and abilities Samson, due to his relation to the Biblical character, had super strength and endurance, and invulnerability. He lost these powers if his hair was cut. These powers were restored once his hair regrew. Samson's hair grew at an accelerated rate.

Archaeology There was a Romano-Celtic temple north of where the parish church now stands, and probably a Romano-British settlement and shrine as well. The shrine was used successively by Roman pagans and Christians. A small square temple was built in the first century AD. This was replaced with a more substantial building that had moulded stonework and decorated plasterwork, and a rectangular perimeter wall was added that enclosed an area around the temple building. Numerous notable bronze artefacts have been discovered at and around the site and are now housed in the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. A sixth-century Anglo-Saxon pendant has also been found at the site, but the reason for its presence at a Roman site is not clear. Manor 13th-century preaching cross on the village green Woodeaton Manor House, built 1775, now Woodeaton Manor School The Old English toponym was originally Eatun. By the 12th century it had become Wood Eaton, perhaps to distinguish it from Water Eaton just over to the west. The Domesday Book records that by 1086 the Norman nobleman Roger d'Ivry held the manor of Eaton. In about 1160 Helewis Avenel gave a virgate of land at Woodeaton to Eynsham Abbey. The Abbey had a grange and manor court house in Woodeaton, recorded in 1366, but no trace remains. The Manor remained with the abbey until the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1538. At the centre of the village, by the village green, are the base and shaft of a 13th-century stone cross. The cross is both a scheduled monument and a Grade I listed building. After the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1536 the manor of Woodeaton was bought and sold by two speculators in succession. Then in 1544 Richard Taverner (1505‚Äì75), the translator of Taverner's Bible, bought the manor. He retired to the village and had a manor house built in the 1550s, and he is buried in Holy Rood churchyard. Woodeaton remained in the Taverner family until 1604. The manor then passed through various hands until it was bought by the Nourse family from Middleton Keynes, Buckinghamshire somewhen between 1623 and 1625. In 1774 John Nourse, the last of the male line, died and left the manor to his daughter Elizabeth Weyland, wife of John Weyland. In 1775 Weyland had the old manor house demolished and the present Woodeaton Manor built. The new house has a modest exterior but in 1791 the architect Sir John Soane enhanced its main rooms with marble chimneypieces, added an Ionic porch of Coade stone, a service wing and an ornate main hall. The manor remained with the family until 1912 when Captain Mark Weyland sold the house and part of the land. Christ Church, Oxford now owns most of the former manor lands. Since 1950 Woodeaton Manor House has been an Oxfordshire County Council school for children with special educational needs.Woodeaton Manor School The house is a Grade II* listed building. Parish church Holy Rood: looking east to the 13th-century chancel arch Holy Rood: 14th-century wall painting of St Christopher Holy Rood: looking west to the tower arch and west gallery Holy Rood: lancet window in the tower decorated with medieval wall painting Woodeaton has had a parish church since the early or middle part of the 11th century, when a Saxon timber one was built. This was destroyed by fire by about AD 1080 at the latest. The present Church of England parish church of the Holy Rood originates from an early Norman stone church that was built between 1070 and 1120 to replace the destroyed Saxon one. It was a small building, dominated by a western tower. The original Norman layout is not entirely certain: there may have been a small nave east of the tower and an even smaller chancel beyond that, or the tower may have been a \\"tower-nave\\" with only a chancel to the east of it. In about 1180‚Äì1220 a late Norman south aisle and possible south chapel were added and in about 1200‚Äì50 the chancel was extended. An Early English Gothic doorway in the south wall of the chancel is of a style that suggests a date of 1200‚Äì30. Several Early English lancet windows in the chancel also date from this period. The nave was rebuilt in about 1250‚Äì1300. Later in the Middle Ages, the east and south walls of the chancel were rebuilt and were given late Perpendicular Gothic windows. The eastern window in the south wall of the nave was also revised with Perpendicular tracery. The Perpendicular Gothic belltower was added in either the 14th or 15th century. Unusually the tower is built on columns erected inside the nave. This seems to be because the ground falls away west of the church to an extent that precluded building a tower conventionally to the west of the nave. The south porch was built in the 18th century. In 2010 the church roof was restored, re-using many of the original Stonesfield slates. Holy Rood church is a Grade I listed building. Bells and clock The tower has a ring of five bells, all of which were cast by Henry II Bagley of Chacombe, Northamptonshire in 1680. Holy Rood has also a Sanctus bell cast by Richard Keene of Burford in 1674. The tower has a turret clock similar to that at St Nicholas' Church, Islip, except that the iron bars of its frame are nutted together rather than wedged. It may have been made in about 1700. In the 1960s Dr. C.F.C. Beeson described it as \\"long disused, rusted\\". Furnishings and internal decoration In the 14th century a large image of Saint Christopher was painted on the north wall inside the nave. Restoration work in 2010 exposed remnants of an early 14th-century crucifixion scene above the rood beam over the chancel arch. Both the chancel and the nave have pews with 15th-century carved wooden bench ends. The wooden screen in the chancel arch and some of the nave seating was added late in the 15th or early in the 16th century. Reportedly there was a rood tympanum but this had been removed before 1846. In the 18th century the wooden pulpit, tester and reading desk were added, along with the wooden panelling and west gallery. Some timbers from the chancel screen tympanum seem to have been re-used in the 18th-century reading desk and pew floors. There is also one box pew at the front of the nave, presumably for the manorial family. Pioneer balloon flight James Sadler, the first English balloonist, landed near the village after his first ascent from Christ Church Meadow in Oxford on 4 October 1784.

He was the 350 cc European Champion in 1938, but died in 1946, overcome by exhaust fumes while working in a new home's poorly ventilated garage. Youth Mellors was born in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, one of five sons of a wheelwright and a clergyman's daughter. Two of his brothers drowned in a local canal as children. He wanted to be an International motorcycle racer and spent a lot of time riding in the Derbyshire hills. Mellors met his future wife when he was still 15. She was 21, so he lied about his age. After 7 months they got married. In 1936, when Mellors became a works rider for Velocette, they moved south to Shirley near Birmingham. They had two daughters Gladys and Joan.

The Republic of Natalia sought an independent port of entry, free from British control and thus sought to conquer the Port Natal trading settlement which had been settled by mostly British merchants in modern-day KwaZulu-Natal. The battle ended in a British victory due to the heroic ride of Dick King for reinforcements. Background According to South African history, in the mid-1820s Shaka, king of the Zulu people swept through the countryside now known as KwaZulu-Natal, killing almost the entire native population of bushmen. Through his conquests, Shaka founded the first unified Zulu Kingdom. A few years later, the English colonists living in the coastal settlement of Port Natal (Durban) requested to be officially recognised by the Cape Government as a dependency of Britain. This was rejected, and as a result the colonists began to trade and settle with the Zulus. However, the Afrikaner Boers, who had recently left the Cape Colony in the mass exodus called the Great Trek, had ventured over the Drakensberg mountains, settled in the area they named the Natalia Republic and resumed their farming lifestyles. The Zulu people naturally had misgivings about the intentions of the newcomers and war followed soon afterward. Eventually the Cape Government heard news of the Boer republic and the subsequent attacks on white people in Port Natal, and how these attacks were approaching the Cape Colony. The Governor of the Cape, Benjamin d'Urban (the settlement of Port Natal was later named Durban in his honour), sent a regiment to take possession of Natal from the Boers and to settle the Zulu attacks. It was, however, D'Urban's successor, George Thomas Napier, who dispatched Captain Thomas Charlton Smith (who had served at the Battle of Waterloo). Clash between Dutch (Boer) and British forces Captain Smith arrived and settled in Port Natal on 4 May 1842, contrary to the vehement demands from the Boers that the British should leave. Smith decided to attack the Boers before they could arrange the support they were expecting. At midnight on the evening of 23 and 24 May, the British forces, including the 1st Battalion, Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, attacked the well-defended village of \\"Kongela\\". The attack failed dismally, and the official history of the Regiment relates the story effectively: Siege of British camp The camp under siege The Boers had won a major battle, and Captain Smith had lost many of his men. Smith realised he needed to urgently request reinforcements from the Cape Colony, which was six hundred kilometers of untamed wilderness away. An English trader known as Dick King and colonist volunteered to alert the colony by riding on horseback to Grahamstown. Slipping through the Boers under the cover of night, King and his native assistant escaped and began their seemingly impossible mission. The history of the Regiment continues: The history continues, saying that the Boers extended a flag of truce proposing that the women and children should be removed from the rustic fort to safety aboard the schooner Mazeppa which was then in port. This chivalrous offer was accepted and 28 people were sent to safety aboard the vessel. Captain Lonsdale described the Boers attacks in a letter to his mother in England: Lifting of siege Memorial to the defenders of the British camp, Old Fort, Durban Dick King made the famous horseback journey of 960 kilometers in fourteen days, ten days quicker than the normal journey's length and reinforcements were immediately sent. Thirty one days after Captain Smith recruited King, the reinforcements arrived at Port Natal by ship, aboard the Conch and the South Hampton. The reinforcements relieved Captain Smith and the surrounding Boers soon dispersed. The Mazeppa was brought back (it sailed to Delagoa Bay to escape the fighting) and the women and children safely returned.

In addition, the tumi form, in metal, was used as a type of coin. Pre- columbian Tumis were usually made of metal or stone. Overview Perhaps the highly ornate ax-shaped ceremonial tumis made by the North coastal Peruvian cultures are the most widely acknowledged, characterized by a semi-circular blade, made of either bronze, copper, gold-alloy, silver alloy or wood and often inlayed with semi-precious stones such as lapis lazuli. Sacrificial Tumis are most often associated with Pre-Inca cultures in the Peruvian North Coastal Region and in some cases with the Inca culture itself. The most popular examples of ornamental tumis are associated with the Peruvian cultures of the Chimu and the Sican (also known as Lambayeque). In Inca mythology, Incas were descendants of the Sun God, Inti, who was worshiped annually with an extravagant celebration known as the 'Inti Raymi'rata (Quechua for \\"sun festival\\"), which is still alluded to today in the form of the Inti Raymi Festival. The festival took place at the end of the potato and maize harvest in order to thank the Sun for the abundant crops or to ask for better crops during the next season. During this important religious ceremony, the High Priest would sacrifice a completely black or white llama. Using a tumi, he would open the animal's belly and with his hands pull out its bowels, so that observing those elements he could foretell the future. Later, the animal and its parts were completely incinerated. Thanks to archaeological research, it is known that Andean cultures such as the Paracas or Inca have used tumis for the neurological procedure of skull trepanation. Many of these operations were carefully performed, suggesting that the surgery was done for the relief of some body disturbance other than that associated with injury, perhaps an organic or mental condition. The functional tumi knives used by cultures of Peru, such as the Paracas, different in composition to those highly ornamental tumis of the Lambayeque and Chimu, as the ornate tumis from these cultures were only functional in a symbolic ceremonial manner, due to the use of soft metals. These soft metals would not have allowed for the actual killing of animal or cutting of any kind of flesh. In the Peruvian north coastal area, ornate Tumi knives were produced for ritual use by elite members of society which included them being used in elite burial ceremonies. On November 21, 2006, archaeologists announced that they had unearthed 22 graves in northern Peru containing pre-Inca artifacts. Among the artifacts were the first semi- circular metallic tumi knives ever discovered by archaeologists. All previous examples had been recovered from grave looters. In 1936 a Sican tumi was discovered in the valley of Batan Grande, Illimo, Lambayeque, Peru. It is really more an ax than a knife with a weight of 992 grams, height 41 cm. This tumi is believed to have the figure of Naylamp on its top, as many Sican culture's tumis are thought to have a depiction of this symbolic figure. Naylamp was a mythic hero and founder of the Sican culture, also known as Lambayeque culture, that was begotten from a totemic bird with his same name, √ëaylamp. The legend goes, that when √ëaylamp died, or disappeared, after founding the Lambayeque culture, he grew wings and flew into the sky. This hero-king founder of Lambayeque built a temple named Chot where he placed a large stone that he called Llampallec, which means statue of √ëaylamp. In this temple many ceremonies and rituals were offered using a tumi. The knife or Tumi of Illimo is represented with a mask of a bird, wings and bird shaped eyes. The mythic stories about the bird named √ëaylamp and the hero warrior founder of Lambayeque are represented in the knife or Tumi of Illimo by a birdman. Sican's tumi knives often include depictions of birds or winds in order to symbolize √ëaylamp as well. Portrays of Naylamp, the \\"Sican Lord\\" abruptly disappear from Sican art in the Late Sican phase (1100-1375). is believed Sican goes through a phase of revitalization of the religion going back to traditional relationships with nature, icons include felines, fish, and birds as the main focus that were secondary to the Sican Deity and the Sican Lord during the previous eras, but were also linked to previous cultures in the area. In modern Peru, to hang a tumi on a wall means good luck. The tumi is the national symbol of Peru and has become a symbol used in Peruvian tourism publicity and can be found depicted on tourist gifts such as mugs and key chains.

They belong to the superfamily Empidoidea and were formerly included in the Empididae as a subfamily. Some, such as Tachydromia, are predators that run around on the bark of trees in complex patterns, hence the common name. Tachydromia species are only about three millimeters long. Description Right wing of the species Hybos grossipes, showing discal medial cell (dm) and first and second medial vein (M1+2) Hybos caliciformis Hybotidae share some similarities with the family Dolichopodidae, when looking at rotation of genetalia and wing characteristics.

Hybotidae wings always have a simple R4+5 vein, where the costa either ends near or at M1/M1+2, or near or at R4+5/R5. Furthermore, it can be distinguished from Dolichopodidae by the point of vein Rs, which it at a distance from the humeral crossvein (h) equal to or longer than the length of h. Systematics The Hybotidae clearly form a lineage quite distinct from the Empididae. Among the Empidoidea, they represent a lineage more basal than the main radiation of Empididae and Dolichopodidae, though they are not as ancient as the genera placed in the Atelestidae. By and large, the Hybotidae are monophyletic. Among its subfamilies, the Hybotinae and Tachydromiinae certainly represent clades. The status of the Ocydromiinae as a natural group is less clear, in particular whether the Trichininae should be included as tribe Trichinini or even in the Bicellariini or Oedaleini, or whether they are more distinct and warrant recognition as a separate subfamily.

Although born in England, he won one cap for the Northern Ireland national team in 2002 and also played for Northern Ireland at under-21 and under-23 levels. McEvilly had a journeyman career, starting with non-League side Burscough, rising through their youth ranks to the senior side, where he made 49 league appearances, scoring 28 goals. In December 2001, Third Division club Rochdale signed him for ¬£20,000. From 2004 to 2009 he had spells in the Conference National and League Two with Accrington Stanley, Cambridge United and Wrexham. Since 2009, McEvilly has struggled with injuries and has had brief spells at numerous non-league clubs in England and Wales, as well as a brief period at League of Ireland side Sligo Rovers in 2010, which was also cut short due to injury. Since 2013, McEvilly has continued playing for amateur and semi-professional teams in the lower levels of non-league. Club career Early career McEvilly started his career at Burscough rising through the youth ranks, making his senior debut against Southport in the Liverpool Senior Cup final in August 1999. He went on to play 49 Northern Premier League games for Burscough, scoring 28 goals over two seasons. Rochdale manager John Hollins signed McEvilly in December 2001, for the Third Division club for a fee believed to be around ¬£15,000 plus a sell-on clause. He made his debut for Rochdale in the Third Division against Kidderminster Harriers on 26 December in the 4‚Äì1 away defeat, replacing Clive Platt as a substitute in the 69th minute. McEvilly scored his first Football League goal, and his first for Rochdale against York City in their 5‚Äì4 home win on 5 February 2002. During McEvilly's first season with Rochdale, 2001‚Äì02, they reached the playoffs finishing fifth place. Rochdale were defeated by Rushden & Diamonds in the playoff semi-finals 4‚Äì3 on aggregate over two legs. During the first leg away at Nene Park, McEvilly scored in the 2‚Äì2 draw. He made a total of 18 appearances in the Third Division, scoring four goals. The following season, 2002‚Äì03, McEvilly played 37 games in the Third Division scoring 15 goals. He started the 2003‚Äì04 season at Rochdale, making 16 appearances and scoring five goals in League Two. Rochdale's new manager Steve Parkin criticised McEvilly's fitness level to play and had described him as \\"too heavy\\", and that he needed \\"to get his physique down to an acceptable weight where he can get around the pitch\\". Conference National club Accrington Stanley signed McEvilly on a one-month loan in January 2004, making his debut in their 3‚Äì0 home win against Tamworth on 20 January. Despite playing out of position in wide right, McEvilly commented; \\"I was playing out of position but it was okay\\". He went on to describe the drop in level he said; \\"I have never played in the Conference but, from what I have seen, it is no different to Division Three.\\" After a month at Accrington and making three appearances scoring one goal, his loan was extended in February for a further month, with manager John Coleman praising him as \\"a great acquisition to the squad\\". McEvilly went on to make a further three appearances, scoring once more before returning to Rochdale. On his return to Rochdale, he scored a further one goal in 14 appearances. At the end of the season, McEvilly was released by Rochdale on 10 May, signing a dater for Accrington Stanley on a permanent basis after a previous loan spell. On 13 November 2004, McEvilly scored a hat-trick in Accrington's 5‚Äì0 home victory over Northwich Victoria. During the 2004‚Äì05 season he made 39 appearances in the Conference National, scoring 15 goals. Wrexham Accrington Stanley accepted an undisclosed bid from Wrexham in July 2005, which included a sell-on clause and a bonus if he returned to play international football. He scored on his debut in a friendly against UEFA Champions League winners Liverpool in the 4‚Äì3 defeat after he came on as a substitute. McEvilly suffered a stress fracture in a metatarsus bone on his right foot in the 1‚Äì1 home draw with Notts County on 11 December, although he declared himself fit to play their following game against Carlisle United, he was substituted after 45 minutes after receiving a mouth injury which had required temporary dental surgery the same evening. His foot injury was later operated on and he received further dental treatment. His return to the Wrexham team following his injury was on 9 April 2006, in their 2‚Äì1 home defeat to Shrewsbury Town when he came on as a substitute replacing Matt Crowell in the 45th minute. He made a further three appearances scoring one goal, before breaking the same bone again in mid-April sidelining him until the end of the season. During the 2005‚Äì06 season, McEvilly made a total of 23 appearances for Wrexham, scoring seven goals in League Two. In June 2006, McEvilly was set to join for Bradford City on a free transfer after agreeing a contract with the club. Despite McEvilly passing a medical, the move fell through as he was unwilling to train with Bradford during their pre-season without guarantee of a contract. Bradford City manager Colin Todd explained; \\"We were concerned about an old injury to his foot which has resulted in it being pinned and we are not prepared to take a risk with him\\". McEvilly opted to sign a new two-year contract with Wrexham. During pre-season with Wrexham, McEvilly broke his other foot, having previously broke the same bone twice in four-months during the previous season. His first appearance of the 2006‚Äì07 season, was on 25 November at home against Lincoln City in the 2‚Äì1 win in League Two, when he came on as a substitute for Kevin Smith in the 80th minute. McEvilly went on to make 28 appearances in League Two, scoring eight goals and a further two appearances in the FA Cup, scoring once against Championship side Derby County in their 3‚Äì1 defeat at Pride Park on 6 January. His contract was cancelled by mutual consent at the end of the season. Wrexham manager Brian Carey said that they are \\"well covered in terms of strikers\\" and \\"he is some way down the pecking order\\". Return to Stanley Accrington Stanley re-signed McEvilly on a one-year contract following his departure from Wrexham. On his return to Accrington he commented; \\"I am back here because I feel I have unfinished business. I played well for a year here and I want to do the same again\\". He had played 10 games in League Two and one game in the League Cup failing to score, and picking up a red card for violent conduct after a stamp on Peterborough United winger Jamie Day in their 2‚Äì0 home loss on 1 September. However, McEvilly struggled to hold down a regular place in the Accrington side and was loaned out to former club, Rochdale in November 2007. On his return to Spotland Stadium, he scored the only goal of Rochdale's 1‚Äì0 win over Mansfield Town on 24 November, with a shot from the edge of the penalty area. McEvilly made a total of seven appearances for Rochdale scoring three goals, before returning in January 2008. He made one more appearance for Accrington, coming on as a substitute in the 73rd minute for Paul Mullin in the 2‚Äì0 defeat to Stockport County on 12 January, before joining Cambridge United on loan on 18 January. McEvilly made 14 appearances and scored three goals for Cambridge, helping them finish second place in the 2007‚Äì08 Conference National, securing a place in the playoffs. In Cambridge's playoff semi-final first leg, they drew 2‚Äì2 with Burton Albion away at the Pirelli Stadium with McEvilly scoring both Cambridge's goals. Cambridge were 2‚Äì0 down and McEvilly came on as a substitute for Mark Beesley in the 74th minute. Paul Hurst was deemed to have handled in the penalty area, and four minutes later McEvilly converted the penalty four minutes after coming off the bench. He scored his second goal from a direct free kick. In the following leg, McEvilly started the game and had a shot within the opening 30 seconds which Rob Wolleaston managed to score from the rebound, before being replaced by Leo Fortune-West in the 77th minute. McEvilly played in the final, in which Exeter City defeated Cambridge 1‚Äì0 at Wembley Stadium. Cambridge United McEvilly playing for Cambridge United in 2008 McEvilly signed a permanent two- year deal with Cambridge the following 2008‚Äì09 season, after being released on a free transfer from Accrington Stanley. On 10 October, he was sent off in the 87th minute of Cambridge's 1‚Äì0 win over Weymouth, for violent conduct after the referee deemed a tackle to be dangerous. He went on to make 18 appearances for Cambridge scoring eight goals in the Conference National, before returning to the Football League to rejoin Rochdale, initially on loan in November, with the possibility of a permanent transfer in January. McEvilly stated he was glad to be back \\"home\\" at Rochdale. Return to Rochdale He made five appearances, scoring twice on loan at Rochdale before signing permanently on an 18-month contract on 1 January 2009. McEvilly made 10 more appearances, starting just once and scoring three goals, before joining Barrow on loan in March, citing his friendship with joint-manager David Bayliss as a key reason for his move. He scored seven his debut on 21 March at home against Lewes, which finished as a 2‚Äì0 victory. In Barrow's next match on 29 March, he was sent off against Weymouth for the second time that season after he received two yellow cards in the 3‚Äì0 away win, picking up the first for kicking the ball away in the first half and then a second in the 69th minute for a foul on Gavin Hoyte, resulting his dismissal. He made six appearances in the Conference National for Barrow, scoring once. On 2 May, McEvilly made one last appearance for Rochdale in their 1‚Äì0 home defeat to Gillingham, replacing Adam Rundle as a substitute in the 75th minute. Rochdale terminated his contract by mutual consent at the end of the season. Non-league career At the start of the 2009‚Äì10 season, McEvilly signed for Grays Athletic along with eight other players, turning down offers from Northern Premier League Premier Division club Marine and Maltese Premier League club Hibernians. McEvilly picked up a long-term shin injury delaying his debut for Grays, and he was eventually released by the club in November without making a single appearance. In January 2010, Marine announced that McEvilly had signed for the club. Marine chairman Paul Leary described McEvilly as a \\"massive signing\\" for the club. He played six matches during his spell in Crosby, scoring twice, before leaving to rejoin Barrow on a short-term contract until the end of the 2009‚Äì10 campaign. In the 2010 FA Trophy Final against Stevenage Borough, he replaced Gregg Blundell in the 72nd minute before scoring with his first touch to level the match at 1‚Äì1. Barrow went on to win the game 2‚Äì1 after extra time, but it proved to be the end of McEvilly's spell at Holker Street as he was released at the end of the season. After leaving Barrow, McEvilly began training with Sligo Rovers of the League of Ireland Premier Division in June 2010. He made only one league appearance for the side, coming on as a substitute in the 2‚Äì1 defeat to Shamrock Rovers on 2 July 2010. In November 2010, he returned to his first senior club Burscough, signing a permanent contract with the Northern Premier League outfit. He made his debut on 11 December 2010 as a second-half substitute in the 3‚Äì2 loss against Bradford Park Avenue. Three weeks later, he got on the scoresheet for the first time during his second spell at the club, scoring both Burscough goals in the 4‚Äì2 defeat to Kendal Town. McEvilly went on to stay at Victoria Park for three months before transferring to Conference North side Droylsden along with goalkeeper Sean Lake in March 2011. McEvilly signed for Garry Flitcroft's Chorley at the start of the 2011‚Äì12 season. He scored his first goal in a 6‚Äì0 home victory over Frickley Athletic and went on to play 12 league games for the club, scoring four times. However, on 13 October, McEvilly was released after failing to hold down a first team spot. He subsequently joined Colwyn Bay on 27 October 2011. He signed for AFC Fylde in February 2012 to work with Dave Challinor again, but was released at the end of the campaign. In August 2012, McEvilly signed for Warrington Town, the fourteenth different club of his career. After being released by Warrington in December 2012 he spent time training with Barrow and officially joined the club on non-contract terms on 31 January 2013‚Äîthe start of his third spell with the Cumbrian outfit. After 6 matches he dropped down a division, signing for Droylsden, leaving after the club was relegated from the Northern Premier League Premier Division at the end of the 2012‚Äì13 season. After leaving Droylsden, McEvilly's career is not documented, but he is presumed to have continued playing in amateur football. In July 2018, he signed as a player-coach for Litherland REMYCA in the North West Counties Football League Premier Division. International career Sammy McIlroy called McEvilly up to the Northern Ireland squad to face Spain in an international friendly on 17 April 2002 at Windsor Park, Belfast. He earned his first cap, replacing Warren Feeney as a substitute in the 63rd minute in the 5‚Äì0 defeat to Spain. He went on to play for Northern Ireland under-21, gaining nine caps scoring three goals between September 2002 and October 2003. On 27 April 2004, McEvilly played for Northern Ireland under-23 team in the 0‚Äì0 home draw against Serbia & Montenegro. McEvilly was called up to the Northern Ireland national squad again in May 2006, to face United States but he failed to make an appearance. Playing style Rochdale assistant manager David Hamilton described McEvilly saying; \\"He's strong, powerful, can shoot with both feet and can score goals. He has good all-round ability and is tremendously tenacious\\". His aggressive and robust playing style earned him the nickname \\"Evil\\". Personal life Prior to playing professional football for Rochdale, McEvilly worked at McDonald's fast food restaurant. He was born in Liverpool, Merseyside, and is an Everton supporter.

The Flame first appeared in Wonderworld Comics #3 (July 1939) and was created by writer Will Eisner and artist Lou Fine. The Flame became Wonderworld's primary character. Publication history The Flame's first appearance was in Fox's Wonderworld Comics #3, dated July 1939, (issues #1 & #2 being titled Wonder Comics). The Flame gained his own title in the summer of 1940; which ran for eight issues until January 1942. He was one of the titular Big 3, appearing in that periodical alongside Blue Beetle and Samson. Fox Publications folded in 1942, being forced to declare involuntary bankruptcy owing its creditors some $175,000. Fictional character biography The Flame's secret identity is Gary Preston. When Gary was a baby, his father Charteris Preston worked as a missionary in China. The elder Preston was washed away in a flood, but managed to save baby Gary by placing him in a basket. The basket was washed downstream to Tibet, where Gary was rescued by a group of lamas. They raised Gary in the lamasery, where they trained him in their mystical ways. Through this training, Gary gained the ability to control fire and temperature, including his own body temperature. He also gained the ability to travel from place to place by materializing inside of flame (even a match flame). When he reached adulthood, Gary returned to America to fight crime as the Flame. He used a flamethrower-gun, as well as a special car, boat and plane. In Wonderworld Comics #30 (October 1941) The Flame was joined by a female sidekick, Flame Girl. Flame Girl was secretly Linda Dale, who was given similar powers as the Flame when Gary Preston was injured. According to Jess Nevins' Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes, the Flame \\"battles arsonists, dictators, German mad scientists, an enormous creature called the Beast, and river pirates.\\" Powers and abilities Thanks to his training, the Flame has the ability to control fire and heat. He can raise his own body temperature to the point where he can burst into flames, or melt bullets. He can control and direct any flame in his presence. He can also teleport from place to place by appearing inside of any fire source, no matter the size. The Flame's one weakness is water, which can severely weaken him. In order to provide fire whenever he needs it, the Flame carries a small, pistol- sized flamethrower.  2010s  The Flame is one of the many public domain Golden Age characters appearing in Project Superpowers, a series released by Dynamite Entertainment.

The calendar round was the combination of the 260-day ritual calendar and the 365-day annual calendar. This New Fire Ceremony was part of the ‚ÄúBinding of the Years‚Äù tradition among the Aztecs. The Binding of the Years occurred every 52 years, or every 18,980 days as a part of the combination of the two calendars. During this time the Aztecs believed the sun might not come back. The Aztecs wanted to symbolically and literally purify and \\"renew\\" their lives for the beginning of the new 52 year cycle. Therefore, many items such as hearth stones were thrown out in order to not be associated with the old cycle in any way. They used this time as a \\"spring cleaning\\" to honor the old and prepare for the new. It was the fire that acted as this Binding of the Years. The ceremony itself entailed all the fires being put out- then In Uixachtlan they started a fire on the chest of a captive and cut out his heart to place it in to fuel the fire. The fire then was taken all over the city to celebrate because the sun would return. People would cut their ears and put their blood in the fire. Thus the New Fire Ceremony started the new cycle and ensured the sun would return each day for another 18,980 days. The New Fire ceremonies were not limited to the Aztecs. In fact it was an ancient and widespread ritual in Postclassic Central Mexico that the Aztecs appropriated to their own society. Link text, https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ancient- mesoamerica/article/archaeological-deposits-from-the-aztec-new-fire- ceremony/F70E3D3ECBF50C2164866F8280BA3EA7 The Anales de Tlatelolco mention the Aztecs upon achieving independence of the Tepanec state celebrated a New Fire ceremony that marked the beginning of the calendric count of the Aztecs. This suggests that the ceremony was also used as a dynastic foundation rite. Details of the Ceremony The Aztec glyph for a New Fire ceremony, with the year Two Reed (Ome Acatl). Representation of a new fire ceremony (Codex Borbonicus, p.34). The Celebration of the New Fire ceremony is described by Tovar. During the last five days (called nemontemi) of the last year of the cycle, the preparations for the ceremony began. These preparations involved abstinence from work, fasting, ritual cleansing, ritual bloodletting, destruction of old household items and observance of silence. It was believed that during these days the world was in grave danger because of the instability inherent in the shift from one cycle to another. It was feared that female stellar deities, the Tzitzimime, would descend and devour the earth. In the days prior to the New Fire Ceremony, citizens would renew their houses and ready them for the ceremony by throwing out hearth stones, clothes, jars and other vessels for cooking, idols and other household goods. These things were considered to hold essences that would be linked to the old cycle. On a national level, temples were also expanded and changed in the spirit of renewal. The ceremony was represented as a bundle of sticks when it was carved as the ceremony was thought to reset the cycle of the years. At sunset on the last day of the year, which it always happened during the birth of Huitzilopochtli, the day-sign \\"1 Tecpatl\\" of the year \\"2 Acatl,\\"Cr√≥nica Mexicayotl, Fernando Alvarado Tezozomoc p 36 a procession of priests from the fire cult of Huehueteotl walked from the ceremonial center of Tenochtitlan across the eastbound causeway towards a mountain called Huixachtlan on the eastern bank of Lake Texcoco close to Colhuacan. The priests would dress as various deities to perform the ceremony. The summit of Huizachtlan was visible from most of the Basin of Mexico. On this extinct volcano was a temple platform. At this time all fires in the Aztec realm were put out and everyone looked toward the mountain's summit. When the constellation called by the Aztecs \\"the fire drill\\" (Orion's belt) rose above the horizon, a man was sacrificed on the top of Huizachtlan and a fire drill was placed on his chest. When the priest started the fire he started it on the sacrifice's chest and then as soon as it caught he would slice the man's chest open and taken out his heart to fuel the fire. This new fire that was started in the first sacrifice's chest started off the ceremony and then later numerous sacrifices celebrated the new cycle. When the first sparks of fire sprung from the fire drill, the New Calendar Round was declared begun and a huge bonfire was lit. From this bonfire torches were carried by runners to every ward of the city where the temple hearths would be lit. The first fires to be lit in this way were those at the twin temple Templo Mayor where the Tlatoani would participate, and later the fires at the Calmecac of Huitzilopochtli and subsequently the lesser temples and Calmecacs and Telpochcallis and lastly private households. Once the fires in homes were lit, people celebrated the renewal by cutting their ears and the ears of their children and throwing blood towards the first fire. People would also often throw themselves into the fire to sacrifice or blister themselves; among this, there would be great celebrating and no one would sleep all throughout the night.  Astrology in The Binding of the Years  The Aztecs believed that their ability to continue in the world as they knew it relied on their ability to understand and incorporate astrological signs and patterns into their own festivals and seasons. The Templo Mayor, which was the temple in the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan, was largely important to the New Fire Ceremony because there the ceremonial fire was taken to the top of the pyramid and lit inside the Temple of Huitzilopotchli., https://www.ancient.eu/article/866/the-aztec-new-fire- ceremony/.The position of every part of the ceremony was carefully chosen to either mirror what was happening in the sky or to please the gods or both. When the priest would wait for the constellation to move, that was the signal that all would be well and that is when he would start the fire on the sacrifice's chest. This ritual sacrifice took place on Huixachtlan which was a large, ceremonially important mountain and the first temple to receive fire from the new fire. Both of these places show that the New Fire Ceremony was closely tied to their understanding of astrology and their gods. The Binding of the Years refers to what was originally thought to be a Teotihuacan idea of the end of a cylindrical cycle. It also might have come from another previous civilization. For 52 years, or 18,980 days, the earth was on one cycle and then at the end of that cycle it was thought to be in danger of ending if a new cycle did not begin. This ceremony's success determined whether the next cylindrical would continue or if everything would end as we know it. Archaeology Stone etched with the symbol of the \\"new fire\\" or beginning of the 52-year cycle on the Aztec calendar. It is also inscribed with the dates 1 rabbit and 2 serpent. On display at the Palace of Cortes, Cuernavaca, Mexico It has been proposed that archaeological evidence of New Fire ceremonies can be found in the shape of dumps of pottery and households utensils discarded in the initial stage of the celebration. The idea was first proposed by George C. Vaillant in the 1930s but his model was criticized as theoretically unfounded and abandoned. In 2001, Elson and Smith rethought the proposal in light of the findings of several ceramic dumps that seemed to match the idea of what remains of New Fire ceremony would look like. They conclude that New Fire ceremonies were held throughout the Aztec sphere of influence and had a distinct importance at both the local level of each household and in the larger political level of the state religion.

Personal development can take place over the course of a person's entire life. This is not limited to self-help, the concept involves formal and informal activities for developing others in roles. Such as teacher, guide, counselor, manager, life coach or mentor. When personal development takes place in the context of institutions, it refers to the: methods, programs, tools, techniques, and assessment systems. This is offered support human development at the individual level in organizations.Bob Aubrey, Managing Your Aspirations: Developing Personal Enterprise in the Global Workplace McGraw- Hill 2010 , page 9 Overview Among other things, personal development may include the following activities: * Improving self-awareness * Improving self- knowledge * Improving skills and/or learning new ones * Building or renewing identity/self-esteem * Developing strengths or talents * Improving a career * Identifying or improving potential * Building employability or (alternatively) human capital * Enhancing lifestyle and/or the quality of life and time- management * Improving health * Improving wealth or social status * Fulfilling aspirations * Initiating a life enterprise * Defining and executing personal development plans (PDPs) * Improving social relations or emotional intelligence * Spiritual identity development and recognition Personal development can also include developing other people's skills and personality. This may take place through roles such as those of a teacher or mentor, either through a personal competency (such as the alleged skill of certain managers in developing the potential of employees) or through a professional service (such as providing training, assessment or coaching). Beyond improving oneself and developing others, \\"personal development\\" labels a field of practice and research: * As a field of practice, personal development includes personal- development methods, learning programs, assessment systems, tools, and techniques. * As a field of research, personal-development topics appear in psychology journals, education research, management journals and books, and human-development economics. Any sort of development ‚Äî whether economic, political, biological, organisational or personal‚Äîrequires a framework if one wishes to know whether a change has actually occurred.Bob Aubrey, Measure of Man: leading human development McGraw-Hill 2016 , page 15 In the case of personal development, an individual often functions as the primary judge of improvement or of regression, but validation of objective improvement requires assessment using standard criteria. Personal-development frameworks may include: * Goals or benchmarks that define the end-points * Strategies or plans for reaching goals * Measurement and assessment of progress, levels or stages that define milestones along a development path * A feedback system to provide information on changes As an industry Personal development as an industry Some sources recognize personal development as an \\"industry\\": see for example and and has several business-relationship formats of operating. The main ways are business-to-consumer and business-to-business. However, two newer ways have emerged: consumer-to-business and consumer-to-consumer. Business-to-consumer market The business-to-consumer market involves selling books, courses and techniques to individuals, such as: * Newly- invented offerings in fields such as: ** Fitness ** Memory training ** Beauty enhancement ** Large-group awareness training ** Weight loss * Traditional practices such as: ** Yoga ** Martial arts ** Initiation ceremonies ** Meditation ** Spirituality ** Asceticism Some programs deliver their content online. Many include tools sold with a program, such as motivational books for self-help, recipes for weight-loss or technical manuals for yoga and martial- arts programs. A partial list of personal development offerings on the business-to-individual market might include: * Books * Motivational speaking * e-Learning programs * Training workshops * Individual counseling * Life coaching * Time-management techniques Business-to-business market Some consulting firms specialize in personal development Companies such as PDI, DDI, Metizo, and FranklinCovey exemplify international personal-development firms working with companies for consulting, assessment and training. but generalist firms operating in the fields of human resources, recruitment and organizational strategy have entered what they perceive as a growing market, Human-resources firms such as Hewitt, Mercer, Watson Wyatt Worldwide, the Hay Group; McKinsey and the Boston Consulting Group offer consulting in talent- development, and Korn/Ferry offers executive coaching. not to mention smaller firms and self-employed professionals who provide consulting, training and coaching. Origins Major religions ‚Äì such as the age-old Abrahamic and Indian religions ‚Äì as well as 20th-century New Age philosophies have variously used practices such as prayer, music, dance, singing, chanting, poetry, writing, sports and martial arts. These practices have various functions, such as health or aesthetic satisfaction, but they may also link to \\"final goals\\" of personal development - such as discovering the meaning of life or living the good life (compare philosophy). Michel Foucault describes in Care of the Self Translated from the French Le Souci de Soi editions Gallimard 1984. Part Two of Foucault's book describes the technique of caring for the soul falling in the category of epimeleia from the Greek to the classic Roman period and on into the early stages of the age of Christianity. the techniques of epimelia used in ancient Greece and Rome, which included dieting, exercise, sexual abstinence, contemplation, prayer and confession‚Äîsome of which also became important practices within different branches of Christianity. Wushu and T'ai chi ch'uan utilise traditional Chinese techniques, including breathing and energy exercises, meditation, martial arts, as well as practices linked to traditional Chinese medicine, such as dieting, massage and acupuncture. Two individual ancient philosophical traditions: those of Aristotle (Western tradition) and of Confucius (Eastern tradition) stand out as major sources of what one can term \\"personal development\\" in the 21st century. Elsewhere anonymous or named founders of schools of self-development appear endemic ‚Äì note the traditions of the Indian sub-continent in this regard. For example: For example: For example: For example: South Asian traditions Some ancient Indians aspired to \\"beingness, wisdom and happiness\\". Paul Oliver suggests that the popularity of Indian traditions for a personal developer may lie in their relative lack of prescriptive doctrine.  Islamic personal development  Aristotle and the Western tradition The Greek philosopher Aristotle (384 BCE ‚Äì 322 BCE) wrote Nicomachean Ethics, in which he defined personal development as a category of phronesis or practical wisdom, where the practice of virtues (ar√™te) leads to eudaimonia, Nichomachean Ethics, translated by W.D.Ross, Basic Works of Aristotle, section 1142. Online in \\"The Internet Classics Archive of MIT\\": http://classics.mit.edu//Aristotle/nicomachaen.html commonly translated as \\"happiness\\" but more accurately understood as \\"human flourishing\\" or \\"living well\\". Martha Nussbaum, The Fragility of Goodness, Cambridge University Press, discusses why the English word happiness does not describe Aristotle's concept of eudaimonia, pages 1‚Äì6 Aristotle continues to influence the Western concept of personal development , particularly in the economics of human development Nobel Prize winner Amartya Sen identifies economic development with Aristotle's concepts of individual development in his co-authored book written with Aristotle scholar Nussbaum: ; as well as in his general book published a year after receiving the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1998: and in positive psychology. Daniel Seligman explicitly identifies the goals of positive psychology with Aristotle's idea of the \\"Good Life\\" and eudaimonia in Seligman, Martin E. P. (2002). Authentic Happiness: Using the New Positive Psychology to Realize Your Potential for Lasting Fulfillment.New York: Free Press. (Paperback edition, Free Press, 2004, ). Confucius and the East Asian tradition In Chinese tradition, Confucius (around 551 BCE ‚Äì 479 BCE) founded an ongoing philosophy. His ideas continue to influence family values, education and management in China and East Asia. In his Great Learning Confucius wrote: > The ancients who wished to illustrate illustrious virtue throughout the > kingdom first ordered well their own states. Wishing to order well their > states, they first regulated their families. Wishing to regulate their > families, they first cultivated their persons. Wishing to cultivate their > persons, they first rectified their hearts. Wishing to rectify their hearts, > they first sought to be sincere in their thoughts. Wishing to be sincere in > their thoughts, they first extended to the utmost their knowledge. Such > extension of knowledge lay in the investigation of things. Confucius, Great > Learning, translated by James Legge. Provided online in The Internet > Classics Archive of MIT. Contexts Psychology Psychology became linked to personal development in the early 20th century starting with Alfred Adler (1870‚Äì1937) and Carl Jung (1875‚Äì1961). Adler refused to limit psychology to analysis, making the important point that aspirations look forward and do not limit themselves to unconscious drives or to childhood experiences. Heinz Ansbacher and Rowena R Ansbacher (1964) Individual Psychology of Alfred Adler, Basic Books 1956. See especially chapter 3 on Finalism and Fiction and chapter 7 on the Style of Life. He also originated the concepts of lifestyle (1929‚Äîhe defined \\"lifestyle\\" as an individual's characteristic approach to life, in facing problems) and of self image, a concept that influenced management under the heading of work-life balance. Carl Gustav Jung made contributions to personal development with his concept of individuation, which he saw as the drive of the individual to achieve the wholeness and balance of the Self. Jung saw individuation as a process of psychological differentiation, having for its goal the development of the individual personality. C.G. Jung. Psychological Types. Collected Works, Vol.6., par. 757) Daniel Levinson (1920‚Äì1994) developed Jung's early concept of \\"life stages\\" and included a sociological perspective. Levinson proposed that personal development comes under the influence‚Äîthroughout life‚Äîof aspirations, which he called \\"the Dream\\": > Whatever the nature of his Dream, a young man has the developmental task of > giving it greater definition and finding ways to live it out. It makes a > great difference in his growth whether his initial life structure is > consonant with and infused by the Dream, or opposed to it. If the Dream > remains unconnected to his life it may simply die, and with it his sense of > aliveness and purpose. Daniel Levinson, Seasons of a Man's Life, Ballantine > Press, 1978, page 91-92 Research on success in reaching goals, as undertaken by Albert Bandura (born 1925), suggested that self-efficacyAlbert Bandura (1997). Self-efficacy: The exercise of control. New York: Freeman best explains why people with the same level of knowledge and skills get very different results. According to Bandura self-confidence functions as a powerful predictor of success because:Albert Bandura, Self-Efficacy: The Exercise of Control, W.H.

Martin Seligman, \\"Building Human > Strength: Psychology's Forgotten Mission\\" VOLUME 29, NUMBER 1 ‚Äì January 1998 Higher education During the 1960s a large increase in the number of students on American campuses See for example the figures for Cuba: led to research on the personal development needs of undergraduate students. Arthur Chickering defined seven vectors of personal developmentArthur Chickering, Education and Identity (San Francisco: Jossey-Bass, 1969); second edition updated with Linda Reisser, published in 1993 by Jossey-Bass. for young adults during their undergraduate years: # Developing competence # Managing emotions # Achieving autonomy and interdependence # Developing mature interpersonal relationships # Establishing personal identity # Developing purpose # Developing integrity In the UK, personal development took a central place in university policy in 1997 when the Dearing Report The Dearing Report of 1997:see the Leeds University website: http://www.leeds.ac.uk/educol/ncihe/ declared that universities should go beyond academic teaching to provide students with personal development. In 2001 a Quality Assessment Agency for UK universities produced guidelines These definitions and guidelines appear on the UK Academy of Higher Education website: for universities to enhance personal development as: * a structured and supported process undertaken by an individual to reflect upon their own learning, performance and/or achievement and to plan for their personal, educational and career development; * objectives related explicitly to student development; to improve the capacity of students to understand what and how they are learning, and to review, plan and take responsibility for their own learning In the 1990s, business schools began to set up specific personal-development programs for leadership and career orientation and in 1998 the European Foundation for Management Development set up the EQUIS accreditation system which specified that personal development must form part of the learning process through internships, working on team projects and going abroad for work or exchange programs. The first personal development certification required for business school graduation originated in 2002 as a partnership between Metizo, A description and requirements for Metizo's personal development certifications can be found on the company's website: www.metizo.com a personal-development consulting firm, and the Euromed Management School The components of Euromed Management School's personal development programs appear on the school's website . in Marseilles: students must not only complete assignments but also demonstrate self-awareness and achievement of personal-development competencies. As an academic department, personal development as a specific discipline is usually associated with business schools. As an area of research, personal development draws on links to other academic disciplines: * Education for questions of learning and assessment * Psychology for motivation and personality * Sociology for identity and social networks * Economics for human capital and economic value * Philosophy for ethics and self-reflection The workplace Abraham Maslow (1908‚Äì1970), proposed a hierarchy of needs with self actualization at the top, defined as: Abraham Maslow \\"A Theory of Human Motivation\\" originally published in the 1943 Psychological Review, number 50, page 838. Maslow, A. H. (1996). Higher ‚Ä¶ the desire to become more and more what one is, to become everything that one is capable of becoming. Since Maslow himself believed that only a small minority of people self- actualize‚Äîhe estimated one percent Maslow, A. H. (1996). Higher motivation and the new psychology. In E. Hoffman (Ed.), Future visions: The unpublished papers of Abraham Maslow. Thousands Oaks, CA: Sage, page 89 ‚Äîhis hierarchy of needs had the consequence that organizations came to regard self-actualization or personal development as occurring at the top of the organizational pyramid, while job security and good working conditions would fulfill the needs of the mass of employees. As organizations and labor markets became more global, responsibility for development shifted from the company to the individual. In 1999 management thinker Peter Drucker wrote in the Harvard Business Review: > We live in an age of unprecedented opportunity: if you've got ambition and > smarts, you can rise to the top of your chosen profession, regardless of > where you started out. But with opportunity comes responsibility. Companies > today aren't managing their employees' careers; knowledge workers must, > effectively, be their own chief executive officers. It's up to you to carve > out your place, to know when to change course, and to keep yourself engaged > and productive during a work life that may span some 50 years. Peter F. > Drucker, \\"Managing Oneself\\", Best of HBR 1999. Management professors Sumantra Ghoshal of the London Business School and Christopher Bartlett of the Harvard Business School wrote in 1997 that companies must manage people individually and establish a new work contract.Ghoshal, Sumantra; Bartlett, Christopher A. (1997) The Individualized Corporation: A Fundamentally New Approach to Management, HarperCollins, page 286 On the one hand, the company must allegedly recognize that personal development creates economic value: \\"market performance flows not from the omnipotent wisdom of top managers but from the initiative, creativity and skills of all employees\\". On the other hand, employees should recognize that their work includes personal development and \\"... embrace the invigorating force of continuous learning and personal development\\". The 1997 publication of Ghoshal's and Bartlett's Individualized Corporation corresponded to a change in career development from a system of predefined paths defined by companies, to a strategy defined by the individual and matched to the needs of organizations in an open landscape of possibilities. Another contribution to the study of career development came with the recognition that women's careers show specific personal needs and different development paths from men. The 2007 study of women's careers by Sylvia Ann Hewlett Off-Ramps and On-Ramps Hewlett, Sylvia Ann (2007), Off-Ramps and On-Ramps, Harvard Business School Press. This book shows how women have started to change the traditional career path and how companies adapt to career/lifestyle issues for men as well as for women. had a major impact on the way companies view careers. Further work on the career as a personal development process came from study by Herminia Ibarra in her Working Identity on the relationship with career change and identity change, Ibarra discusses career-change based on a process moving from possible selves to \\"anchoring\\" a new professional identity. indicating that priorities of work and lifestyle continually develop through life. Personal development programs in companies fall into two categories: the provision of employee benefits and the fostering of development strategies. Employee surveys may help organizations find out personal-development needs, preferences and problems, and they use the results to design benefits programs. Typical programs in this category include: * Work-life balance * Time management * Stress management * Health programs * Counseling As an investment, personal development programs have the goal of increasing human capital or improving productivity, innovation or quality. Proponents actually see such programs not as a cost but as an investment with results linked to an organization's strategic development goals. Employees gain access to these investment-oriented programs by selection according to the value and future potential of the employee, usually defined in a talent management architecture including populations such as new hires, perceived high-potential employees, perceived key employees, sales staff, research staff and perceived future leaders. Organizations may also offer other (non-investment-oriented) programs to many or even all employees. Personal development also forms an element in management tools such as personal development planning, assessing one's level of ability using a competency grid, or getting feedback from a 360 questionnaire filled in by colleagues at different levels in the organization. A common criticism surrounding personal development programs is that they are often treated as an arbitrary performance management tool to pay lip service to, but ultimately ignored. As such, many companies have decided to replace personal development programs with SMART Personal Development Objectives, which are regularly reviewed and updated. Personal Development Objectives help employees achieve career goals and improve overall performance. Criticism Scholars have targeted self-help claims as misleading and incorrect. In 2005, Steve Salerno portrayed the American self-help movement‚Äîhe uses the acronym SHAM: The Self-Help and Actualization Movement‚Äînot only as ineffective in achieving its goals but also as socially harmful. 'Salerno says that 80 percent of self-help and motivational customers are repeat customers and they keep coming back whether the program worked for them or not'. Others similarly point out that with self-help books 'supply increases the demand...The more people read them, the more they think they need them...more like an addiction than an alliance'. Self-help writers have been described as working 'in the area of the ideological, the imagined, the narrativized....although a veneer of scientism permeates the[ir] work, there is also an underlying armature of moralizing'.
