It was first established in 1961 by an act of the Congress of the Philippines which was further amended in April 2009 to optimize and conform it to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which the Philippines is a signatory to. A total of 101 basepoints providing for 100 baselines were identified under Republic Act No. 9522, which identified Amianan Island as the northernmost, Frances Reef as the southernmost, Pusan Point as its easternmost and the Balabac Great Reef as the westernmost points of the main Philippine archipelago.  Background  The Philippines is an archipelago of 7,100 islands customarily enclosed by the lines demarcated by the Treaty of Paris in 1898 and the Convention Between the United States and Great Britain in 1930, which came to be known in the Philippines as its International Treaty Limits. The government of the Philippines has maintained its position that the waters enclosed by the demarcation lines in the said treaties form part of its territorial waters regardless of its breadth and dimension.

For almost a century (1896‚Äì1983) it served predominantly African-American patients and, for most of these years, was owned and operated by Dillard University, a historically black university. History Early years (1896‚Äì1928) Flint Goodridge Hospital in 1922 The history of the hospital can be traced to the Phyllis Wheatley Sanitarium and Training School for Negro Nurses, run by the Phyllis Wheatley Club. The training school included hospital care and was founded in 1896, operating under the administration of the Phyllis Wheatley Club and located in the Medical College facility of New Orleans University, which was run by the Methodist Episcopal Church. Needing increased financing to maintain the hospital and because of a lack of financial support, the school was taken under the wing of New Orleans University and merged with the school's Medical College hospital. The efforts of Methodist Episcopal Church Bishop Willard Francis Mallalieu, the school was able to enlist the aid of John Flint of Fall River, Massachusetts, who donated $25,000 to the institution. In 1901, the name of the hospital was changed to Sarah Goodridge Hospital and Nurse Training School and the medical college to the name Flint Medical College of New Orleans University in honor of John Flint. Flint donated an additional $10,000 to purchase a new property at 1566 Canal Street, which would house the Flint Medical College. The Flint Medical College closed in 1911, when the American Medical Association, under increasingly stringent guidelines, deemed its facilities unacceptable. In 1915 the School of Pharmacy closed. That year all of the buildings were placed under the use of the Sarah Goodridge Hospital, which continued to operate under the administration of the Methodist Episcopal Church and in 1916 a renovation was done on the facilities, which had fallen into disrepair. The buildings at Canal and Robertson streets, which had been used by both the Flint Medical College and the Sarah Goodridge Hospital and Nurses Training School, were converted into a 50-bed hospital and a nurse' residence. The Hospital was renamed Flint-Goodridge Hospital. The Nurse Training Department was reorganized and continued under the management of New Orleans University. Dillard University governance (1929‚Äì1983) In 1930 New Orleans University and Straight College merged to form Dillard University, a historically black university, which would own and operate the Hospital henceforth. A campaign was initiated to raise $2,000,000 for a completely new facility for the hospital. After funds were secured, the new facility was erected in Uptown New Orleans at 2425 Louisiana Avenue, next to LaSalle Street. On February 1, 1932, the dedication ceremony was held. Under the directorship of Albert Walter Dent The Board of Trustees at Dillard, under the leadership of New Orleans businessperson and philanthropist Edgar B. Stern Sr, needed a dynamic and capable leader to serve as the Superintendent of the hospital, so in 1929 they selected the twenty seven year old Morehouse alumnus from Atlanta, Albert Walter Dent. Dent had to find a way to help his staff in complete residency, which had been a challenge due to the lack of opportunities for African American doctors during segregation. He enlisted the aid of white doctors from Tulane and Louisiana State University to serve as consultants to the hospitals' various departments, conducting regular post-graduate seminars. Such actions were praised as models of black and white cooperation. Construction began on a new hospital facility designed by Dillard University architect Moise Goldsteinat at a cost of approximately one-half million dollars, which opened in 1932 at the address of 2425 Louisiana Avenue next to Howard Street and LaSalle. During Dent's tenure the postgraduate course for physicians in the South was established. Dent expanded the number of hospital beds allotted to free care from twenty percent to fifty percent and reduced expenses, while taking advantage of New Deal programs such as the National Youth Administration, which provided training for nurses and orderlies. Because such programs were funded by the Federal government, it allowed the hospital to use money that would have gone into those expenses towards patient care and services, such as maternity care. Dent convinced the board to offer a flat rate of ten dollars for maternity expenses. In addition to increasing services for the indigent, he attempted to increase the number of paying patients, by offering a once cent pay-a-day plan, underwritten by a Rosenwald Fund donation. In 1941 Dent was asked by Dillard University's Board of Trustees to leave his post at the hospital in order to become the University's third president. He served in that position for the next twenty eight years. His two successors as superintendent at the hospital were John L. Procope and Dr. S Tanner, however, their tenures were brief, made more troublesome with the cloud of Second World War. During this period the hospital became burdened with debt. Clifton Caldwell Wiell era In 1949 Clifton Caldwell Weill, a prot√©g√© of Dent, became the superintendent and would serve in that capacity until 1970. In 1953 a separate board from that of the university was set up for the hospital. The previous superintendent's wife, Mrs. Albert Walker Dent, came up with a plan to hold fashion shows to raise funds for the hospital, and she contacted John H. Johnson the publisher and editor of Jet and Ebony magazines to enlist their sponsorship. The first Ebony fashion fair for the hospital was held in 1958. Over the years, the fair grew into a traveling event which raised funds for various causes, amongst which remained Flint Goodridge Hospital. In 1958 Weill began a campaign to build a new addition onto the hospital. More than 1.3 million dollars were raised, and the four- story ninety-six bed wing was completed in 1960, adding 96 beds and allowing for the expansion of the Physical Therapy Department. The hospital was newly equipped with pipe air, room telephones, and a nurse-patient intercom system. An intensive care unit was built in 1963 and a coronary unit was added in 1968, which featured the latest cardiac devices such as heart monitors, defibrillators, and pacemakers. Also in 1968, a nurses' residence was built near to the hospital on Louisiana Ave. and Saratoga St. In 1970 Weill completed his twenty-first and final year as superintendent. Decline As a result of desegregation measures of the 1960s, Flint Goodridge experienced a decline in patients, which would bring about its eventual closure. Investment banker Keith Butler waged an effort to sell the hospital to a group of African American physicians, but failed. In 1983 the hospital was sold to National Medical Enterprises, however, they opted not to use the facility as a hospital‚ÄîFlint-Goodrige shut its doors. The building that once housed the hospital still stands today at 2425 Louisiana Avenue and is now the Flint-Goodridge Apartments. Legacy For much of the twentieth century Flint Goodridge functioned as an African American-owned hospital serving the needs of the black community in New Orleans. Many prominent black physicians spent all or parts of their careers working at Flint-Goodridge.

Along with the famous Gymnop√©dies (1888) they are regarded as his first important works, and the ones upon which his reputation as a harmonic innovator and precursor of modern French music, beginning with Debussy, principally rests.Rollo H. Myers, \\"Erik Satie\\", Dover Publications, Inc., NY, 1968, p. 19. Originally published in 1948 by Denis Dobson Ltd., London. The Sarabandes also played a key role in Satie's belated \\"discovery\\" by his country's musical establishment in the 1910s, setting the stage for his international notoriety. French composer and critic Alexis Roland-Manuel wrote in 1916 that the Sarabandes represented \\"a milestone in the evolution of our music...pieces of an unprecedented harmonic technique, born of an entirely new aesthetic, which create a unique atmosphere, a sonorous magic of complete originality.\\"Quoted in Alexander Carpenter's Allmusic review Erik Satie / Sarabandes (3) for piano Background The Arras Citadel, where Satie was stationed during his military service The Sarabandes emerged at a point in Satie's life when he was beginning to assert his independence as a man and artist. In November 1886, the 20-year-old composer dropped out of the Paris Conservatoire and enlisted in the French army. His close friend and collaborator at the time, the poet Contamine de Latour, claimed Satie had persisted with his hated Conservatory courses only so he could qualify for a student exemption that would reduce his five years' compulsory military service to one year in the reserves.Robert Orledge, \\"Satie Remembered\\", Faber and Faber, London, 1995, p. 17.Frank Northen Magill, \\"Dictionary of World Biography: The 20th century, O-Z\\", Routledge, 1999, p. 3331. Satie was duly assigned as a reservist to the 33rd Infantry Regiment at the Citadel in Arras,Myers, \\"Erik Satie\\", Dover Publications, Inc., NY, 1968, p. 18. nicknamed La belle inutile (\\"The Useless Beauty\\") for its fine architecture and lack of strategic importance.Arras France Tourism Guide: The Citadel of Arras But even this comparatively mild duty proved too onerous for his liking. He sought to make himself ill by sneaking out of his barracks at night and strolling about bare-chested in the winter air, with the result that he came down with a severe case of bronchitis.Ornella Volta (ed.), \\"Satie Seen Through His Letters\\", Marion Boyars Publishers, London, 1989, pp. 22-23. By April 1887 he was back at his family's home in Paris on a two-month medical leave.Robert Orledge, \\"Satie Remembered\\", Faber and Faber Limited, 1995, p. xxiii. During his convalescence Satie reunited with Latour, read Gustave Flaubert's Salammb√¥ and The Temptation of Saint Anthony, and discovered the writings of Jos√©phin P√©ladan, the future founder of the Mystic Order of the Rose + Cross with which Satie would be associated in the early 1890s. In May he was thrilled by a performance of Emmanuel Chabrier's new opera Le roi malgr√© lui, with its daring use of unresolved seventh and ninth chords. As a tribute he visited the composer's home and left with the concierge a copy of one of his early scores, with an extravagant dedication inscribed in red ink. Chabrier never responded to Satie's gesture.Pierre-Daniel Templier, \\"Erik Satie\\", MIT Press, 1969, p. 11. Translated from the original French edition published by Rieder, Paris, 1932.In fairness to Chabrier he probably had more pressing issues on his mind. Le roi malgr√© lui was presented only three times at the Op√©ra-Comique's Salle Favart between May 18 and May 23, 1887. Its run was cut short on May 25 by a disastrous fire that destroyed the Salle Favart with a loss of 84 lives. Given the circumstances, Chabrier's failure to respond to an unknown fan (Satie) is understandable. See the New York Times, \\"Paris Theatre on Fire\\", May 26, 1887, at https://www.nytimes.com/1887/05/26/archives/a-paris-theatre-on-fire-the-opera- comique-burned-and-sixty-lives.html On subsequent leaves from his regiment Satie began sketching two compositions, the Sarabandes and the Gymnop√©dies.Templier, \\"Erik Satie\\", p. 11. He finally focused his attention on the Sarabandes and finished them on September 18.The Gymnop√©dies would not be completed until April 1888. See Orledge, \\"Satie Remembered\\", p. xxiii. It was the last music he composed under his father's roof. In November 1887 he was discharged from the army, and the following month - with a gift of 1600 francs from his father to get him started - he set out on his own for a new life in Montmartre, the Bohemian center of Paris.Mary E. Davis, \\"Erik Satie\\", Reaktion Books, 2007, p. 27. Music The sarabande is a dance in triple meter that originated in the Spanish colonies of Central America in the mid-1500s. It had migrated to Europe by the 17th Century, where in France it became a popular slow court dance. Satie's modern reinterpretations consist of three dances with a total duration of roughly 15 minutes: :Sarabande No. 1 - A-flat major :Sarabande No. 2 - D-sharp minor :Sarabande No. 3 - B-flat minor In the original manuscript No. 1 was dedicated to Conrad Satie, the composer's brother, and No. 2 to Arthur Dodement, a musician friend from Satie's Conservatory days. These were removed prior to publication of the Sarabandes in 1911, when No. 2 was re-dedicated to Maurice Ravel, who first played the piece in public. See Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", p. 270. Biographer Mary E. Davis wrote that \\"the Sarabandes introduce compositional approaches that would prove important not only in Satie's later work but also in the broader history of French music...they presented a new conception of large-scale form, in which groups of three very similar pieces, deliberately interlinked by means of motivic cells, harmonic events and recurring interval patterns, combine to constitute a unified work.\\"Mary E. Davis, \\"Erik Satie\\", Reaktion Books, 2007, pp. 25-27. Satie called this tripartite structure he invented \\"an absolutely original form\\" that was \\"good in itself,\\"Robert Orledge, Satie's Musical and Personal Logic, transcript of lecture at Gresham College, April 16, 2010 a means of exploring a central musical idea from three different perspectives without resorting to traditional variation techniques. In place of continuous development we are given mosaic-like progressions of unresolved dissonances, shifting between movement and stasis, which imbue the stately dignity of the sarabande with a suspended, timeless quality.Joseph Smith, notes to \\"Erik Satie's First Sarabande\\", 2012, at Emmanuel Chabrier The possible influence of Chabrier on Satie's advanced harmonic language of the 1880s has long been noted, by Maurice Ravel in the 1920sMaurice Ravel, \\"Contemporary Music,\\" Rice Institute Pamphlet, Rice University Studies, 15, no. 2 (1928). Transcript of lecture Ravel gave at the Rice Institute (now Rice University), Houston, Texas, April 7, 1928. and biographer Rollo H. Myers (1948)Myers, \\"Erik Satie\\", p. 68. up to the present, focusing on the similarities of the unresolved ninths in the Sarabandes and those found in the Prelude of Le roi malgr√© lui.Templier, \\"Erik Satie\\", p. 76. Yet there are signs Satie was already feeling his way towards a harmonic \\"no-man's land\\" in the unconventional ninths and even thirteenths that appear in his 3 m√©lodies (to poems by Latour) of 1886,Robert Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", Cambridge University Press, 1990, p. 34.Olof H√∂jer's notes to \\"Erik Satie: The Complete Piano Music, Vol. 1\\", pp. 15-17, Swedish Society Discofil, 1996. and his tonal approach in the Sarabandes is radically different. Chabrier's dissonances in Le roi malgr√© lui enrich the musical color but function within a traditional dramatic framework; Satie's dissonances become musical events in themselves. Or as pianist-author Joseph Smith put it, \\"For Chabrier, the A.1. Sauce; for Satie, the steak.\\"Smith, notes to \\"Erik Satie's First Sarabande\\". See Note 18. Robert Orledge proposed that Chabrier's real impact lay in \\"proving to Satie that the Wagnerian path was the wrong one for a composer of wit and originality to follow.\\"Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", p. 36. In an early instance of Satie appending an extramusical text to one of his compositions, the score of the Sarabande No. 1 was originally prefaced by a stanza from Latour's poem La Perdition (The Damnation): :Suddenly the heavens opened and the damned fell, :Hurtling and colliding in a gigantic whirlwind; :And when they were alone in the sunless night, :They discovered they were wholly black. Then they blasphemed.Quoted in Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", p. 208. These apocalyptic verses bear no obvious relation to the music, though they do reflect Satie's growing religious preoccupations, perhaps with a dash of humor. The sarabande was once ruled indecent and banned in Spain,Britannica.com article on the Sarabande causing author Miguel de Cervantes to jokingly claim it was a dance born and bred in hell.In Cervantes' one-act comedy La cueva de Salamanca (The Cave of Salamanca), first published in 1615. Satie's inquiring mind kept him well-versed in the history of the established musical forms he tackled, leading pianist-musicologist Olof H√∂jer to wonder if this knowledge accounted for both the otherwise arcane Latour quote and the \\"unmistakeable hint of decadent sensuality\\" he found in the Sarabandes.H√∂jer, notes to \\"Erik Satie: The Complete Piano Music, Vol. 5\\", p. 23. Three decades later Satie would overtly satirize the controversy over another \\"Dance of the Devil\\" from the west condemned by the Catholic Church - the tango - in his piano suite Sports et divertissements (1914).In the piece Le Tango. The phrase \\"dance of the Devil\\" is Satie's own. See H√∂jer, notes to \\"Erik Satie: The Complete Piano Music, Vol. 5\\", p. 23. The Sarabandes also offer the first example of Satie the musical \\"prankster\\" with their odd enharmonic notation, which can cause needless difficulties for the performer.Patrick Gowers and Nigel Wilkins, \\"Erik Satie\\", \\"The New Grove: Twentieth-Century French Masters\\", Macmillan Publishers Limited, London, 1986, p. 140. Reprinted from \\"The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians\\", 1980 edition. Joseph Smith observed, \\"Pianistically, anyone who can play the Gymnop√©dies can play the Sarabandes; however, the modal Gymnop√©dies are easy to read, whereas the Sarabandes, with their unsightly globs of flats and double-flats, can cause the eyes of the most facile reader to cross and glaze over. Some believe that this discouraging note-spelling is Satie's way of teasing the player, and certainly it would be consistent with Satiean humor, which can be interpreted as self- deprecating, disarming - or hostile.\\"Joseph Smith, notes to \\"Erik Satie's First Sarabande\\". Performance and publication Maurice Ravel, 1910 Unlike the Gymnop√©dies and the earlier piano suite Ogives (1886), which he published at his own expense in the late 1880s, Satie initially chose not to promote the intermediate Sarabandes. He did not keep them a secret from his intimates, however. They were the probable model for his friend Claude Debussy's Sarabande, composed in 1894 and revised before its inclusion in the set Pour le piano (1901).Francis Poulenc, \\"Erik Satie's Piano Music\\", La Revue Musicale, No. 214, June 1952, pp. 23-26. Reprinted in Nicolas Southon, \\"Francis Poulenc: Articles and Interviews: Notes from the Heart\\", Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2014.Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", p. 40.Davis, \\"Erik Satie\\", p. 36. In an article on his brother's music for the June 1895 issue of the esoteric religious journal Le coeur, Conrad Satie referred to the unpublished Sarabandes as the \\"works of a mystic pagan, and which give a foretaste of the Catholic who was to write the Danses gothiques.\\"Conrad Satie, \\"Erik Satie\\", Le coeur, June 1895, pp. 2-3. Quoted in Robert Orledge, \\"Satie Remembered\\", Faber and Faber, London, 1995, pp. 49-50. Maurice Ravel, who first met Satie in 1893, knew of the pieces and spoke highly of them to members of his circle. In 1905 Ravel introduced critic Michel-Dimitri Calvocoressi to Satie, who showed him the manuscript of the Sarabandes. Calvocoressi later declared, \\"I promptly saw the truth in Ravel's assertion that Satie's music contained the germ of many things in the modern developments of music.\\"Michel-Dimitri Calvocoressi, \\"Erik Satie. A few recollections and remarks\\", The Monthly Musical Record, 55, January 1, 1925, pp. 6-7. Quoted in Orledge, \\"Satie Remembered\\", pp. 148-149. Salle Gaveau In 1909 Ravel resigned from the Soci√©t√© Nationale de Musique (SNM), which he felt had become too conservative, and founded the Soci√©t√© musicale ind√©pendante (SMI) to spotlight new and neglected composers. For the first concert of the SMI's second season, on January 16, 1911, Ravel personally played Satie's second Sarabande, a prelude from Le Fils des √©toiles (1892), and the third Gymnop√©die at the Salle Gaveau in Paris. The unsigned program note praised Satie as \\"a precursor of genius...With today's performance of the Second Sarabande (which bears the astonishing date of 1887), Maurice Ravel will prove the esteem in which the most 'advanced' composers hold this creator who, a quarter century ago, was already speaking the audacious musical idiom of tomorrow.\\"Quoted in Davis, \\"Erik Satie\\", pp. 81-82. Satie himself boasted that Ravel's performance was \\"a revelation\\" to many in the Parisian musical scene.Roger Nichols, \\"Ravel\\", Yale University Press, 2011, p. 120. The Sarabande No. 1 was first published in the magazine associated with Ravel's society, the Revue musicale SIM, on March 15, 1911, and the second Sarabande appeared as a supplement in the April 1911 issue of Musica. Rouart, Lerolle & Cie published the complete Sarabandes in the summer of 1911. For this first commercial edition Satie removed the Latour poem and dedicated the second Sarabande to Ravel in gratitude for his sponsorship.Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", pp. 251, 270. Aftermath Erik Satie and Claude Debussy in the early 1910s Ravel's admiration for Satie's early music was sincere and lasting, but his promotion of it through the SMI was not without intrigue. One of his aims in bringing to light obscure contemporary composers like Satie was to challenge the reputation of his chief rival, Debussy, as the wellspring of all modern trends in French music.Volta, \\"Satie Seen Through His Letters\\", p. 27. It is significant that the SMI program note enthused over the unknown Sarabandes and said nothing of the Gymnop√©dies, two of which had been orchestrated by Debussy and performed at his urging by the SNM in 1897.Davis, \\"Erik Satie\\", pp. 81-82. This marked the only time Debussy orchestrated the music of another composer. Debussy was quick to recognize that Ravel was using Satie against him. He tried to counter the SMI's propaganda - with its implications that he had done nothing to help his old friend earlier - by adding his orchestral versions of the Gymnop√©dies to an all-Debussy concert he was scheduled to conduct for the Cercle Musical. Reporting this development to Ravel on March 4, Satie wrote, \\"That's something I owe to you. Thank You.\\"Erik Satie, letter to Maurice Ravel dated March 4, 1911. Quoted in Volta, \\"Satie Seen Through His Letters\\", pp. 88-89. The two Gymnop√©dies were the surprise hit of Debussy's March 25 program at the Salle Gaveau. Their success overshadowed Debussy's music, and Debussy did not hide his feelings of resentment from Satie.Erik Satie, letter to Conrad Satie dated April 11, 1911, quoted in Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", p. 59. The Ravel and Debussy concerts of 1911 made Satie famous in Paris, but the politics behind them would sour and ultimately destroy his relations with both men - in Debussy's case, probably the closest friendship he ever had.Louis Laloy, \\"La Musique retrouv√©e\\", Librairie Plon, Paris, 1928, pp. 258-259. Conservative critics in the French capital did not welcome Satie's sudden emergence from obscurity. If he was remembered at all it was for his bohemian antics of the 1890s (challenging the director of the Paris Opera to a duel, founding his own church to attack his enemies) or his association with the Rose + Croix sect. Journalist and minor composer Jean Poueigh, writing under his pseudonym Octave Ser√©, briefly mentioned Satie in his 1911 book Musiciens fran√ßais d'aujourd'hui (French Musicians Today) as \\"a clumsy but subtle technician\\" whose Sarabandes had deeply impressed the young Debussy; he condescendingly added that \\"not too much importance should be attached to it.\\"Volta, \\"Satie Seen Through His Letters\\", p. 130. But Ravel's championship, Roland-Manuel's fervent praise during World War I, and later testimony from such distinguished musicians as Charles Koechlin, Darius Milhaud, Georges Auric and Alfred Cortot, led Satie biographer Rollo H. Myers to conclude that by the World War II years there seemed to be \\"a consensus of opinion\\" that the Sarabandes anticipated some of the harmonic processes of modern French music.Myers, \\"Erik Satie\\", p. 19.

Written in the years of Kuprin's military service, In the Dark is considered to be his most important work of that early period. Synopsis Traveling by night train, Zinaida Pavlovna is rescued from the unwelcome attentions of a fellow passenger by Alarin, a young engineer whom she falls in love with. In the town she takes up the position of a governess in the household of the rich industrialist Kashperov who determines to possess her. Having learned of Alarin's facing imprisonment for gambling away official funds, Zinaida offer herself to Kashperov for money, so as to repay her beloved one's debt. Admiring her selflessness, Kashperov gives her the money unconditionally. Recognizing nothing but base greed in Alarin's response, Zinaida is filled with contempt for him. She falls ill from nervous shock, and dies. Kashperov kills himself by drinking prussic acid, and Alarin leaves the town a broken man. Concept The novel explores the duality of the human nature, its male characters demonstrating their 'dark' as well as noble sides. \\"As if mirroring the duality revealed in his characters as the tale progresses, Kuprin's narrative technique oscillates between opposite poles... The story's title is a verbal distillation of the circumstances in which the characters find themselves, a life of figurative darkness intensified by the physical twilight that pervades the work,\\" Kuprin scholar Nicolas Luker wrote. Assessment According to Luker, \\"[w]hile Kuprin's first large prose work shares many flaws of \\"The Last Debut\\" - melodramatic passages, unnatural situations, and bombastic language - it demonstrates his ability to handle successfully a complex plot with its major and minor characters, varied settings, and dialogues.‚Äù References Aleksandr Kuprin 1893 novels ","title":"In the Dark (Kuprin novel)"},{"id":"48655546","text":"HRH Fon Fomuki Of Guneku Guneku is a rural community in Momo Division located in the Northwest region of Cameroon, Central Africa. It has a tropical climate with 2 main seasons; the rainy and dry seasons with a population of approximately 10 000 inhabitants. The main occupations of the inhabitants are subsistence farming, and cattle rearing. Guneku has a lot of touristic sites such as the palace, caves, mountains, waterfalls, hills and valleys, rivers and springs. Guneku is one of the 31 communities that make up the Meta clan sharing boundaries with Mbemi, Nyen, Tugi, Zang-Tembeng, Oshie, Mundum and Bafut. The Bantous and Mbororos are the two tribes that cohabit peacefully in the community. The community is ruled by a paramount Fon Fomuki (traditional authority) who is the custodian of tradition and all community members are answerable to him. The Fon is the representative of the Central government. There is a community council that makes laws that are used to govern the community and the Fon enforces these laws making sure they are strictly adhered to by everyone in the community. Any defaulters are disciplined accordingly. Guneku has a dynamic cultural and development association abbreviated GUDECA ( Guneku Cultural & Development Association) that oversees the designing, planning, and implementation of community-based projects. It is made up of an elected committee for a 4-year term with at least 60% youth and female representation. GUDECA has branches in Europe, Canada and America. At the end of each year, the committee produces an annual report of activities and presents it to the community which is the supreme decision body with respect to development issues in the community. In terms of Infrastructure, Guneku has 4 primary schools, one secondary school and a Presbyterian health centre and accessible to Mbengwi and Bamenda towns by road. Only 40% of the community has pipe-borne water and electricity. It is connected to the rest of the world through MTN, Orange and CAMTEL which are the main telephone providers in the country. At the household level, the father is the head of the household; he takes decisions that affect the entire family. He decides when to take a sick child to a health facility; what portion of the household income should be used for food, education and other basic needs. However, this situation is gradually changing as more women are empowered to be responsible housewives and mothers.

The film was released online on June 15, 2012. It premiered on March 7, 2015 at the Cinequest Film Festival.Cinequest  Plot  Heart String Marionette is a tale about a child trapped in a box, a masked samurai mime, and a stripper who all try to defeat a warlord and an evil clown, who have successfully turned a countryside into a never ending nightmare filled with horrible monsters. After some opening shots to establish that we know what marionettes are, we open on an island seemingly made of giant stone hands. In the center is a stage, with a large wooden box. A weak voice cries out for help, revealed to be a boy inside the box, accosted by strange laughing statues with clown faces. Eventually, someone shows up to open the door for him and we‚Äôre introduced to our hero, Samhaine Tsuke. Here we get our first bit of plot, rather than visual. The boy claims that he wasn‚Äôt looking for someone to let him out of the box, but rather he was in need of an actor, and Samhaine fits the bill perfectly. Samhaine is hesitant, saying he lacks a face, but the boy encourages him, saying that at least he has a voice. The boy commands him to be a hero and tasks Samhaine with hunting down a clown who stole his brother and locked him up in the box, while simultaneously referring to Samhaine as his brother. Samhaine accepts, saying he‚Äôll cut down all the people trying to hurt the boy, ‚Äúeven if I have to kill the Devil himself.‚Äù Samhaine leaves and the boy cries out to him, reminding him that style counts for a lot and he should remember to dance. After that, we‚Äôre treated to a few minutes of establishing shots, music, and opening credits as Samhaine makes his way to the local warlord‚Äôs mansion. A group of armed men are waiting in the entrance hall as Samhaine enters and presents a picture of the clown given to him by the boy. But there‚Äôs no clown present, and the leader of the armed men mocks Samhaine as he struggles to remember who his brother is and what happened to him. Eventually, the men shoot Samhaine in the heart and drag his body off. Meanwhile, a woman named SiouXsie (Susie) Silen is traveling in a palanquin. She makes conversation with one of the palanquin bearers, asking what the difference is between a marionette and a puppet. He tells her that puppets are controlled from below while marionettes are controlled from above, but that marionettes don‚Äôt actually exist. This bit of common sense and exposition ends up being slightly important later on. There‚Äôs a short musical interlude where Samhaine is implored to ‚Äúreach for the sword in his heart,‚Äù which he uses to escape from the afterlife. We then get a brief introduction to a wandering archer named Tatsuya, who is pretty much here just for comic relief, a simple man with simple desires: to become a hero so he can pick up chicks. SiouXsie‚Äôs palanquin is attacked by a demon, which kills both of the bearers. As the monster descends on her, Samhaine reappears, wielding the same sword that allowed him to return to life and wearing a different mask from what he had on before. Here we also get our first taste of Samhaine monologuing about his despair and his identity, or lack thereof. This is something that‚Äôs going to keep happening for the rest of the movie, and also seems to signal Samhaine having come to embody the ‚Äúrole‚Äù he was given by the boy at the beginning. He also claims that to face him is to face his ‚Äúhigher power‚Äù, indicating that Samhaine seems to believe he‚Äôs a marionette. Samhaine makes quick work of the demon, and SiouXsie, who believes him to be the Prince of Marionettes, eventually convinces Samhaine to come with her, saying that she has some bodyguard work for him and that she can help him find the clown he‚Äôs after. The two set off and encounter numerous bandits and monsters along the way, as well as a couple of children by the riverside singing a song about a little boy born without a face, his father having traded it to the Devil in exchange for immortality. We also learn that the reason all of the puppets wear masks is because it‚Äôs believed that the Devil himself is roaming the land, and will steal your soul if he sees your face. Obviously this is all tangential and has nothing to do with what we‚Äôre watching. Obviously. Also the warlord‚Äôs name is Lord Wor. Eventually, SiouXsie and Samhaine arrive in SiouXsie‚Äôs village, and most of this scene just seems confusing and out of left field. Yes, even by this movie‚Äôs standards. The two walk up to the front of a building called ‚ÄúSalvation Saloon‚Äù and are soon confronted by a group of men bedecked in crosses who claim that SiouXsie is marked for death and they intend to punish both her and Samhaine for their sins. Samhaine easily wins and SiouXsie takes him to the other side of town to confront the creature these people seem to worship, called The Body. The Body makes his appearance and makes a lot of noise about ‚Äúthe body of Christ‚Äù and ‚Äúthe Lord of Lords.‚Äù The whole thing seems like it‚Äôs set up to be a pretty obvious middle finger to Christianity, except within the context of the movie it doesn‚Äôt really make much sense. The Body is just another demon, and the ‚ÄúLord of Lords‚Äù he claims to represent is Lord Wor, a man who works for the Devil. As Samhaine fights The Body, SiouXsie is kidnapped by the Waspwoman, another one of Lord Wor‚Äôs demons. Luckily, Tatsuya has been stalking SiouXsie for quite some time and manages to save her. After releasing her from her cage, he asks her about the man she‚Äôs traveling with and she reveals that he‚Äôs Samhaine Tsuke. Tatsuya releases his inner fanboy upon hearing this, relating the story of an old play known as ‚ÄúThe Silent Form,‚Äù written by Samhaine Tsuke. Found a long time ago in a cave, the author is unknown apart from the signature on the cover. However, the events of the play mirror the events of the movie. So that‚Äôs a thing. Having defeated The Body, Samhaine realizes that SiouXsie is missing. He wanders along the road, searching for her, eventually finding her in another village after dispatching some more of Lord Wor‚Äôs demons. Samhaine has some kind of breakdown, wondering if he‚Äôs real. SiouXsie flirts with him/tries to steal his sword, but Samhaine rejects her advances, saying he‚Äôs not a man, but a monster. Samhaine wanders off alone into the countryside, bemoaning his fate as a puppet destined to follow the script of the play. SiouXsie also wanders off and encounters the Waspwoman in a graveyard, revealed to be Samhaine‚Äôs mother, having been turned into a monster by Lord Wor. The two talk for a while before Waspwoman takes SiouXsie to Lord Wor. Tatsuya tracks down Samhaine and they both make their way to stately Wor Manor to save SiouXsie and face off against Lord Wor. Samhaine cuts a bloody swathe through Wor‚Äôs men, monologuing through most of the battle, before making his way into the mansion. Tatsuya ends up locked out. Samhaine confronts Lord Wor, his father, who apologizes for having wronged him in the past. Samhaine surrenders to Lord Wor, and they make their way to the conveniently placed Hell portal in the back of the mansion. Lord Wor calls out to the Devil, saying that they‚Äôve come to release him. The Devil, speaking in a foreign language, declares that his physical form has deteriorated and he requires a new vessel. He wants Samhaine‚Äôs body. The Devil, who resembles a brine shrimp, asks Samhaine to remove his mask to complete the process. But as he does, the Devil stares into Samhaine‚Äôs faceless‚Ä¶face, declaring that he does have a face and is something monstrous. Lord Wor doesn‚Äôt understand why Samhaine has a face as he, ‚Äúmade sure he died inside.‚Äù Samhaine proceeds to beat the Devil to death with his bare hands as Wor approaches him, and we get a silent scene of Samhaine‚Äôs childhood, abused and beaten by Wor, who is revealed to be the clown from the picture given to Samhaine by the boy. After this, Wor retreats back through the portal as Hell collapses around Samhaine. Another demon appears, and Samhaine gives a monologue about hate before cutting it down, his sword now having his heart prominently displayed on the blade. Samhaine comes back through the portal, declaring himself to be a monster of his father‚Äôs own creation. Wor agrees, and apologizes, saying that he‚Äôll atone by burning down his mansion and abandoning the machines that give him eternal life. But as Samhaine approaches Wor, his heart ceases beating on the sword and he collapses. Wor transforms into the clown and stomps Samhaine‚Äôs motionless heart into dust. What follows is an emotional musical scene where the boy offers up his heart to replace the one Samhaine has lost. Samhaine cuts down Wor, who thanks him for freeing him as he dies, happy that Samhaine has ended the cycle and will never become his father. The life flows from Wor, reviving all those he‚Äôd stolen life from across the land. Samhaine cries over his father‚Äôs remains before turning to bow to the people assembled behind him, and the astonishingly short credits roll. Interestingly enough, the musical part of this scene is missing from the Uberector‚Äôs Cut. In that version, Wor destroying Samhaine‚Äôs heart leads directly into the credits, which then cuts straight to Samhaine killing Wor, with no sort of explanation given. \\"The narrative of Heart String Marionette does not follow the narrative conventions of traditional films. The narrative style of the film is based on a type of Japanese theater called Noh. One of the premises of Noh as explained by its creator Zeami is that emotion is more important than the ability to lay out a clear cause and effect story. M dot Strange studied the principles of Noh as written by Zeami in creating Heart String Marionette. The film has more similarities with Noh than it does with a mainstream Hollywood film.\\". Production Voices are provided by Jimmy Urine, JP Anderson, Richard Grove, Asil Aceves, and others. There are two versions of Heart String Marionette. The Original Cut features original music by composer Endika and was a close collaboration between director and composer. The Director's Cut is a different version of the film, scored by M dot Strange, that features various scenes that are not in the Original Cut, as well as having some scenes from the Original Cut removed. The Original Cut of the film can be found on YouTube. Technical aspects What is unusual about this film is that it is essentially the work of one person, M dot Strange. Although created using simple techniques compared to many films with computer-generated imagery, (e.g. almost all characters are derived from the same basic figure) this movie has a professional aspect, due in large part to the results obtained through the use of Cinema 4D. The movie contains more than 1,500 shots that were created entirely in Cinema 4D. In addition, After Effects software was used for compositing. The film took two and half years to complete. There is a companion book A_Book which highlights the making of the film with a lot of how to tips for DIY animators/filmmakers.THE RETURN OF M DOT STRANGE|Filmmaker Magazine  Release  The film was released digitally online on June 15, 2012.

The German text is a poem by an anonymous poet, derived from a Volkslied. The piece is in F major and scored for up to six voices, SSATBB. Composed in Meiningen in 1914, it was published in 1916 after Reger's death as the fourth of ' (Eight Sacred Songs). It is often performed in Advent.  History  Reger composed the motets of Op. 138 in Meiningen in 1914, at the beginning of World War I, when he also worked on Requiem projects in Latin and German. Inspired by Bach's motets, he had composed \\"extended a cappella choral settings\\", such as Geistliche Ges√§nge, Op. 110, dedicated to the Thomanerchor, with challenging double fugues. In great contrast, he composed eight motets forming Acht geistliche Ges√§nge (Eight Sacred Songs), Op. 138, as a master of \\"new simplicity\\". He died before finishing to check the Korrekturb√∂gen (proofs) from the publisher.

Graz, pp. 180‚Äì183, (1718 edition online).Erk, Ludwig; B√∂hme, Franz Magnus (eds.) (1894): Deutscher Liederhort. Vol. 3. Breitkopf & H√§rtel, Leipzig, pp. 749‚Äì750 (Digitalisat).Und unser lieben Frauen, Liederprojekt The topic is a dream of Mary, \\"our dear Lady\\", of a tree growing under her heart, providing shadow over all land, called Jesus Christ the Saviour. The final stanza says that he is \\"our salvation and consolation\\", who freed us by his bitter martyrdom. A sermon held in the Thomaskirche where the motet was performed by the Thomanerchor pointed out that the growing tree refers to the wood of the cross on which Jesus suffered. Related to a dream about pregnancy, the piece is often performed in Advent. A free English translation of the poem was provided by Catherine Winkworth, \\"Our Lady lay a-sleeping\\". A translation to be sung was written by Jean Lunn, published by Carus: \\"And to our blessed lady\\". Max Reger produced an altogether new composition, not making use of the existing folk tune. The piece is in F major and scored for up to six voices, SSATBB. It is marked \\"Zart bewegt\\", roughly: \\"in tender motion\\". The first two stanzas of the poem are set the same, in time for four vocal parts, soprano, alto, tenor and bass. The second stanza has different dynamics for the same notes. As a climax, the third stanza is in common time and set for six parts by division of the soprano and bass. It begins with a forceful acclamation \\"\\" (Lord Jesus Christ), followed by the first rest in the whole motet. The last line about salvation for \\"us all\\" (\\"\\") reaches high tension, in terms of both harmony and fortissimo on \\"all\\", which is released within only two beats to pianissimo, then the last half line is repeated, beginning softly and fading away.  Selected recordings  The motet has been recorded in programs for Advent and Christmas, such as a collection by the chamber choir ars antiqua Aschaffenburg, and in recordings of the complete motets Op. 138, for example by the NDR Chor conducted by Hans-Christoph Rademann.

Photograph by Sarah Ainslie. Scarlet Harlets was a women's theatre company based in London in the 1980s; it later changed its name to Scarlet Theatre. The company created physical theatre productions through a process of collaboration between the actors, the scriptwriter or translator, and the director. History Scarlet Harlets was established in 1981, by Susan Paxton and Tessa Crockett. Shelley Graham joined in 1982 on Crockett's suggestion and Gaia Shaw joined as artistic designer and puppeteer. Chris Bowler later worked with the Scarlet Harlets as a director. Scarlet Harlets operated as a collective of five members at most, working together intensively for months of rehearsal. The result, in the case of Toe on the Line at least, was \\"a show in which the bonding of the three actors to one another was extended into an intimate relationship with the audience\\". We Who Were the Beautiful (after Auguste Rodin's sculpture Celle qui fut la belle Heaulmi√®re) was the company's debut production in May 1982. The show examined parallels between the witch trials in the Middle Ages and the treatment of women in modern psychiatric hospitals. The production subsequently toured to several countries including Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and Czechoslovakia. On the back of this show the company received funding from the Greater London Council. Productions Subsequent shows included Out of Bounds in 1982/3, Broken Circle in 1984, Toe on the Line in 1985, 80 Days Soul in 1986, Appetite of the Heart in 1987, La Folie in 1988/9, (R) Age in 1990, Vows in 1991, Baby Baby in 1992, On Air in 1993, The Sisters in 1995, and Paper Walls also in 1995. In 1997 Scarlet Theatre decided to include men in their show Princess Sharon at the Royal Festival Hall. The reason for this was described by Lizbeth Goodman and Jane de Gay as \\"to break out of the ghetto of lower-funded 'women's work'\\"., also citing The Independent of 5 April 1997. The Independent commented that while \\"women's companies have all but faded from the scene ... [Princess Sharon] is a genuine departure: this time there are men on stage too.\\" The newspaper suggested that this might encourage the Arts Council to fund such theatre companies rather better. Rehearsal process The Scarlet Harlets collective evolved into Scarlet Theatre. The actress Kate Eaton records that she translated the Cuban playwright Virgilio Pi√±era's 1957 The Wedding (Spanish: La Boda) for Scarlet Theatre in 2003, collaborating with the actors and the artistic director Grainne Byrne, and enjoying \\"the actors' ability to literally think on their feet\\". The company's process for rehearsal included a week for research and development, during which the actors were allowed to improvise so as to identify characters and suitable story elements. The writer took this material and made it into a script over the next few months. The actors then worked with the script in their rehearsals. This process was modified somewhat to permit the adaptation of pre-existing scripts, whether in English or translated. It was adapted one step further to include the commissioning of fresh translations by people such as Eaton who would join in the collaboration as part of the creative team. Reception Telory Williamson reviewed Scarlet Theatre's 1996 adaptation, The Sisters of Anton Chekhov's The Three Sisters for Theatre Journal. She described the director Katarzyna Deszcz's project of integrating the \\"actors, design, lights, music, and text as equal players in the stage space\\" as reflecting the teachings of the Polish director Tadeusz Kantor. Williamson argued that this \\"fits well with the Scarlet Theatre's process of generating material through improvisation and physical characterization.\\" She praised Deszcz for combining excellent \\"physical theatre and psychological subject matter, employing both abstract gestures and a keen sense of physical clowning.\\" Equally, she admired the production's \\"simple and clever reference to Chekhovian stagnation\\" through repetition of lines, mirroring the characters trapped in their unchanging domestic setting. Maddy Costa, reviewing Scarlet Theatre's Love and Other Fairy Tales for The Guardian at the Edinburgh Festival of 2001, described it as \\"a magical piece, a playful, witty take on the Wife of Bath's Prologue and Tale that brings out all of Chaucer's modernity and bawdy humour.\\" She considered the play perfect for the company, since it was \\"intelligent, physically demanding and deliciously romantic\\". The Evening Standard commented that while the production was at one level just \\"a delightful exercise in bawdiness and medieval caricature\\", at a deeper level it offered emotional insights into \\"unpalatable realities\\". The reviewer enjoyed the comedy on offer, and admired the tight theatrical pace of the directors Grainne Byrne and Katarzyna Deszcz.

The division was formed in 1919 as the 36th Rifle Division and fought in the Russian Civil War and the Sino-Soviet conflict of 1929. In 1937 it became the 36th Motorized Division. The division fought in the Battles of Khalkhin Gol. It was converted into a motor rifle division in 1940 and fought in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in World War II. Postwar, it became a rifle division again before its disbandment in 1956. The division spent almost its entire service in the Soviet Far East.  History   Russian Civil War  The division was first formed as the 36th Rifle Division (ru: 36-—è —Å—Ç—Ä–µ–ª–∫–æ–≤–∞—è –¥–∏–≤–∏–∑–∏—è) based on the 9th Army's expeditionary division on 19 July 1919. It fought in the Russian Civil War and was part of the 9th Army between 1919 and 1920. In summer 1921, the division participated in the campaign against Roman von Ungern-Sternberg's forces in Mongolia. On 4 June 1923, the division was given the honorary designation \\"Transbaikal\\".  1929 Sino-Soviet conflict  The Special Far Eastern Army was formed on 6 August 1929, and the 36th RD became part of then newly formed army. In the second half of August, alleged Chinese provocations on the border of the Soviet Far East increased. The commander of the troops of the army ordered elements of the division to positions on the border. The division, without the 106th Rifle Regiment, was positioned in Borzya. Due to the tense border situation, the 108th Rifle Regiment was transported to the site of a possible incident. On 16 August, one platoon of the regiment repulsed a Chinese attack near the village of Abagaytuevsky. A major incident occurred on 18 August in the 108th Rifle Regiment sector. During the early morning hours of that day, Chinese artillery reportedly began shelling Soviet territory. By 1100, three companies of Chinese infantry were attacking. To aid Soviet border guards, infantry and artillery were sent in. Soviet troops attacked the Chinese trenches on the other side of the border and reportedly captured them. With Soviet troops in their rear, the attacking Chinese troops were reportedly routed and the Soviet troops returned to the border. In November, the division fought in the Manchurian operation.

In the comic book series, Dwight is second-in-command to a group of survivors led by Negan called \\"The Saviors\\" who extort nearby communities for their supplies in exchange for protection against zombies, but Dwight despises Negan for holding his wife Sherry over him and becomes an uneasy ally of Rick Grimes as an informant against Negan. After Negan's defeat, Dwight becomes the new leader of the Saviors and incorporates them into the trade-route arrangement between the other communities. In the television series, Dwight, Sherry and her sister, Tina, flee the Saviors, fed up with Negan's reign of terror. They encounter Daryl Dixon, who helps them escape but Dwight betrays Daryl, stealing his crossbow and his motorcycle. Since then, a violent hostile rivalry has been formed between Dwight and Daryl. Following Sherry's disappearance, Dwight has since betrayed Negan and works with Rick as an informant against the Saviors. After the war, Dwight was exiled by Daryl and left to go and find Sherry. In January 2019, it was announced that Amelio will reprise his role as Dwight in the fifth season of Fear the Walking Dead which began airing on June 2, 2019. In the spin-off series, Dwight joins Morgan's convoy and is searching for his missing wife Sherry who he has chased across the country. Appearances Comic book series Before the outbreak, Dwight served in the military and was married to Sherry, and was possibly a hunter due to his accuracy with a crossbow. After the outbreak occurred Dwight and Sherry took up residence in the Sanctuary community led by Negan, but Dwight and Sherry struggled to maintain their keep due to Negan's high expectations. However, Negan offered Dwight and Sherry easier lives if Sherry became one of his many wives; she reluctantly agreed though this would mean that Dwight would never be allowed to so much as speak to her again. One night they violated their agreement and Negan had Dwight's face burned with an iron as punishment, and from then on Dwight pretended to hate Sherry, openly calling her bitch, to make her think he did hate her although he resented himself for doing so. Eventually, Dwight joined Negan's army of \\"zombie exterminators\\" offering protection to the nearby Hilltop Colony and The Kingdom communities in exchange for half of their supplies weekly, threatening them with violence if they didn't comply, and Dwight served as Negan's right-hand man. Something to Fear After Rick Grimes kills several Saviors, refusing to partake in their arrangement, Dwight is sent by Negan to make an example of those who refuse him. After finding Rick's home in the Alexandria Safe-Zone, Dwight attempts a failed ambush against them and is injured. In retaliation, Negan himself goes after Rick while he travels to Hilltop and sends Dwight and 50 other Saviors back to attack Alexandria but Andrea is able to kill at least a dozen of them and forced the rest to retreat, but Dwight is captured and held in the underground bunker. Andrea wants to kill Dwight for murdering Abraham and almost killing Eugene but Rick plans to consent to Negan's terms and releases Dwight so he won't anger Negan anymore than he already has. As Dwight leaves however it's revealed that Rick has tasked Jesus to follow Dwight back to his community. What Comes After As Dwight walks back home he notices movement on the bridge above him but fails to see Jesus following him and shrugs it off but another Savior crosses his path and informs Dwight he's been followed, but is informed that John and Tara have captured Jesus. Despite resistance, Tara manages to have him restrained and Dwight demands Jesus to be taken back alive and throw him into their truck but as they approach the Sanctuary Jesus manages to escape unnoticed. Dwight demands the other saviors not to tell Negan and Dwight is present for Negan's return from Alexandria much to Negan's surprise as he'd believed him killed in the Alexandria and expresses disappointment that he isn't dead, much to Dwight's anger. When Carl Grimes attacks them having snuck aboard the truck Dwight viciously beats the child in anger until Negan stops him, having taken a liking to Carl earlier, and later Dwight witnesses Negan ironing Mark's face for sleeping with Amber who is now married to Negan and looks on with sympathy. When Amber tries to reach out to Mark, Dwight stops her and Sherry comforts her but as she tries to talk to Dwight he calls her a bitch and tells her to shut up but as Sherry walks away heart-broken Dwight appears engulfed in rage. Dwight later witnesses Negan's ping-pong tournament and afterward deliberately drags Sherry away to have sex with in front of Dwight. Finally having enough Dwight approaches Ezekiel of The Kingdom and offers his assistance against Negan and Ezekiel contacts Rick and Jesus to meet with them, but Rick immediately distrusts him for killing Abraham but Dwight is surprised to see Rick show up at all as he assumed he'd fallen victim to Negan's intimidation. Rick doesn't believe Dwight to be a defector and tries to convince Ezekiel that Dwight is a spy who's trying to uncover their plan to rebel against Negan, but Dwight informs Rick about Sherry and that Negan would have killed her if he didn't kill Abraham but Rick eventually punches Dwight in the face. After Ezekiel stops them coming to further blows Dwight explains that Sherry chose to become Negan's wife in order to make their lives easier, and they didn't realize how much they needed each other until then and the one time they were caught together is when Negan burnt his face. Dwight admits he committed terrible acts for Negan he can't make up for out of cowardice but insists he can help the leaders end Negan's reign of terror and offers them everything he knows about Negan, even if Rick doesn't trust him he asks to trust that his information will see Negan dead. All Out War After the militia of the communities led by Rick, Maggie and Ezekiel attacks the Sanctuary Negan orders Dwight to rally a counterattack and agrees but deliberately hesitates to give Rick more time to, as planned, kill enough Saviors and to lure any zombies nearby. Though the plan succeeds Holly is captured by Negan who he believes is Rick's girlfriend, unaware it's Andrea he actually needs, but she reminds him she was with Abraham and looks at Dwight with disdain. Dwight later helps Negan and some other saviors clear out zombies trying to get into the Sanctuary and later, reluctantly, takes part in Negan's counterattack on Alexandria. First using a zombified Holly as a Trojan horse which kills Denise Cloyd and then begins throwing grenades into the safe-zone but orders the saviors to spread out, since they will be easier targets. After Jesus manages to toss one of the grenades back Dwight tells a group of saviors to hold the grenades longer so they can't be tossed back but as they start panicking Dwight grows tired and shoots them all. Jesus sees this and still acts suspicious of Dwight but he again insists he is on their side. Dwight is later present with Negan and Carson after Eugene is captured and demands Eugene start building bullets for them rather than Rick but he refuses. After Negan and Carson leave Dwight sneaks back into Eugene's cell and tries to convince him of his arrangement with Rick so Eugene doesn't give into Negan's demands but Eugene doesn't believe him and accuses him of playing both sides and that if he had defected he would have put a knife through Negan's head while asleep, but Dwight insists that he is going to kill Negan when the time is right and not when there are too many people who'd kill him for his betrayal. Before he can continue both men notice Carson watching them but shows support for Dwight's actions as he desires to get back to Hilltop to be with his brother Harlan Carson, and that others are against Negan too. Negan later orders all his men to soak their bladed weapons and arrow heads in zombie corpses so anyone stabbed, regardless if they survive will be killed by the infection. After forcing the Alexandria and Kingdom residents back to Hilltop Negan launches an attack on the colony where Dwight is forced to kill some members of the communities but after sneaking up on Rick, Negan orders Dwight to kill Rick. Although he hesitates Dwight shoots Rick in his lower back but Dwight secretly switches one of his zombie coated arrowheads for a normal one so Rick won't be infected. After falling back Negan camps close to Hilltop and Dwight joins him near a fireplace where Negan is happy with excitement, believing Dwight shot Rick with an infected arrow, and believes Rick will be dead soon and the militia crippled. The next day the saviors line up outside Hilltop's gates where Rick alone emerges to talk to Negan, enraged that Dwight didn't kill him, and he manages to deceive Negan with talks of consenting to the arrangement before slitting his throat. As Rick and Negan fight Dwight orders the saviors to stay back allowing the other community members to open fire on them and Dwight drops his cover and begins firing on other saviors, even saving Ezekiel from one. After Negan passes out from blood loss and Rick from exhaustion Dwight reveals his alliance with Rick to the community members, and declares himself the new leader of the saviors and orders them to stand down. Though resistant Dwight insists they don't have to fear Negan anymore and can live peacefully with the other communities and they consent to his leadership. Life and Death In the two years since Negan's defeat Dwight has incorporated the Saviors into the trade-route arrangement with the communities but has become stressed with the heavy burdens of leadership, and he and Sherry have divorced but still remain close friends. When delivering a share of supplies from the Sanctuary to Alexandria Dwight approaches Rick and asks to speak to him and confesses that it was necessary for him to take leadership during the war, but feels unfit to lead anymore. Rick tells him to discuss it with the residents of the Sanctuary and hold an election. No Turning Back After 12 members of all 4 communities are murdered by The Whisperers the Saviors head back to the Sanctuary but Laura suggests Dwight stay behind and assist Rick, but he confides in her that he doesn't want to be leader anymore, but Laura insists that his people need him now more than ever and can't quit.The Walking Dead #149 Television series After the outbreak occurred, Dwight, Sherry and her sister-in-law Tina and two teenagers named Carla and Delly were forced into the forest to escape a large group of walkers, but Carla and Delly were separated from them.

The three later came into contact with The Saviors led by Negan, a group of survivors who extorted other communities into giving them supplies by force and were offered protection in exchange for their service which they agreed, but came to see that Negan was a tyrant. They eventually grew resentful of \\"kneeling\\" and the three, along with a truck full of supplies named Patty, escaped from the community.

Eventually they find an abandoned factory overrun with walkers and deduce that Patty must have been taken. Tina faints and Daryl steals their supplies and runs, but after learning Tina is diabetic he returns with the supplies.

After Wade amputates he is called off and they return to their home and Dwight realizes Daryl is not with the group. They find a greenhouse where they find out that Delly and Carla were killed, but the two girls emerge as walkers and kill Tina. As Dwight and Daryl bury them, Daryl invites Dwight and Sherry to come back to Alexandria. On impulse, he holds Daryl at gunpoint and demands his crossbow which he reluctantly hands over.

Negan later reveals to Daryl that Dwight, his wife Sherry and her sister Tina ran away with medical supplies before returning. Negan was going to kill Dwight, but Sherry offered to marry him if he spared Dwight's life. While Dwight was allowed to live and return to the Saviors, his face was burned with an iron as punishment though he has since become one of Negan's \\"top guys.\\" When Daryl still refuses to submit, Dwight throws him back in his cell, telling him he'll either end up working for Negan or on the walker fence.

He is distraught by her absence, but hangs on to her ring and leaves a message for her there. He returns to the Sanctuary and plants the note in Dr. Emmett Carson's office.

After Daryl releases him, Dwight reveals Negan is coming to Alexandria the next day with a convoy of Saviors. He states he can slow them down so they can prepare; once they kill Negan and those with them, Dwight can lead them back to the Sanctuary and they can take over, putting an end to the threat. He leaves Alexandria and saws down several trees to blockade the path between Alexandria and the Sanctuary. The next day, Dwight is forced to watch things devolve into all-out battle between Rick's allies and the Saviors.

In the episode \\"The Big Scary U\\", Dwight appears in a flashback, with Simon, Gregory, Negan and his lieutenant saviors, reaching an agreement to stop Rick and his allies. The meeting is divided by the beginning of The Attack of Rick's militia in the Sanctuary, when Gavin raises the possibility that the militia attack may have succeeded due to the internal information of one of them. Dwight, who had provided Rick with that information, diverts the discussion to problems with anxious workers downstairs, knowing that if they do not assert a form of authority, they could rebel. Leaving things for the moment, they return to their rooms. Eugene comes to Dwight's room to give him a thank-you gift and notices a freshly painted chess set in his room, the saviors discover bags of arms left by the militia and evidence that they were stolen and used by an infiltrated Savior Rick's allies.

At that time, Daryl drives the truck toward the walls of the Sanctuary, allowing walkers to flood the lower floors of the Sanctuary. Many of the workers are killed, but Negan's lieutenants lead an assault to keep hikers at bay. Eugene, enraged by the events, tells Gabriel that he will do what keeps him alive and that he will remain loyal to Negan.

Dwight is visibly worried for the members of the Militia and sends over a copy of Negan's plan on a map over to the Hilltop using Gregory to deliver the intel. Simon recruits Dwight and a few other Saviors to overthrow Negan, but Dwight sells out Simon by informing Negan of his planned mutiny. Negan has Simon's men killed and fights Simon hand-to-hand, killing him. Dwight's treacherous actions against the Saviors are exposed when Negan reveals that he picked up Laura the night before and she told him about Dwight's betrayal in Alexandria. It is then revealed that Negan tricked Dwight by having him slip that intel to Rick's group, which was actually a fake plan that will lead the Militia into a trap. In the eighth season finale \\"Wrath\\", Dwight is now a prisoner in a jumpsuit similar to Daryl's when he was a prisoner.

Dwight is taken as hostage by a member of Logan's group who was listening on that channel. When the group encounters Virginia and her larger group, Virginia offers to use her large network to find out about Sherry for Dwight as incentive for him to join her, but he refuses. Virginia later reveals to Dwight that she did look as she promised and she found an engineer who claimed to have broken bread with Sherry only a few months before. According to the engineer, Sherry is extremely worried about Dwight. When Dwight expresses disbelief at Virginia's claims, Virginia points out that she knows Sherry's name as proof as Dwight had never called Sherry by name during the documentary. Dwight continues to refuse to join Virginia and later walks off when Morgan feels they have no choice but to call Virginia for help. Development and reception Dwight is portrayed by Austin Amelio on The Walking Dead television series. Noel Murray of Rolling Stone ranked Dwight 22nd in a list of 30 best Walking Dead characters, saying, \\"The introduction of one of the comics' most important characters happened so stealthily (via what seemed at time like a one-off episode, last season's \\"Always Accountable\\") that even die-hard fans didn‚Äôt recognize that they'd just met the man who'll play such a major role in the Negan/Saviors storyline. Season Seven has fleshed Dwight (Austin Amelio) out a lot more, making his original appearance all the more tragic in retrospect.\\"Murray, Noel (December 7, 2016). \\"30 Best 'Walking Dead' Characters\\".

It was first published in Everybody's Magazine in August 1910,, accessed 15 November 2015. and later included in the collection of stories by London, The Strength of the Strong, published by Macmillan in 1914.The Strength of the Strong The World of Jack London, accessed 15 November 2015. In the story, two people, from different cultural and racial backgrounds, are the only survivors of a ship that encounters a hurricane in the Pacific, and they remain together. Background In 1907 London began a voyage across the Pacific Ocean in his ketch the Snark, and visited islands in the south Pacific, concluding the voyage in Sydney, Australia. He wrote about the adventure in his book The Cruise of the Snark. \\"The Heathen\\" is set among islands that London visited during that period. Plot summary The narrator, a pearl buyer named Charley, is a cabin passenger on a schooner, the Petite Jeanne, sailing from Rangiroa to Tahiti with a Kanaka crew, at the end of the pearling season in the Paumotas. The boat, having eighty-five deck passengers, is overloaded. Several passengers die of smallpox; Charley and the other cabin passengers drink whisky, until it runs out, in the belief that it will kill the smallpox germs. The boat is in the direct path of a hurricane. \\"The second sea filled the Petite Jeanne's decks flush with the rails, and, as her stern sank down and her bow tossed skyward, all the miserable dunnage of life and luggage poured aft. It was a human torrent.... Out of all my experiences I could not have believed it possible for the wind to blow as it did.... It was a monstrous thing, and the most monstrous thing about it was that it increased and continued to increase.\\" The Petite Jeanne is destroyed in the hurricane, and Charley survives by clinging to a hatch cover from the boat, sharing it with a Kanaka named Otoo. Eventually Charley loses consciousness, and comes to on the beach of an atoll; Otoo has saved his life by pulling him from the water. They are the only survivors from the Petite Jeanne. They exchange names. \\"In the South Seas such a ceremony binds two men closer together than blood-brothership.\\" They part in Papeete and Otoo goes home to Bora Bora; but he returns, because his wife has died. He accompanies Charley for the next seventeen years, ensuring that he does not come to harm. \\"Truly, he made me a better man. Yet he was not strait-laced. And he knew nothing of common Christian morality.... he was a heathen... a gross materialist who believed that when he died he was dead. He believed merely in fair play and square- dealing.... Otoo had my welfare always at heart. He thought ahead for me, weighed my plans and took a greater interest in them than I did myself.\\" Otoo advises Charley to become a captain of a schooner, in order to save enough to own a plantation. He does so; he marries and has children. Otoo helps to bring up the children on the plantation. The relationship ends when Otoo is killed saving Charley from sharks on the coast of Savu. \\"And so passed Otoo, who saved me and made me a man, and who saved me in the end.\\" Commentary In a 2006 collection of stories by London including \\"The Heathen\\", the editors comment: \\"In the early 1940s, when this story found its way into fiction anthologies and high school textbooks, it was admired for its fiercely detailed picture of a storm at sea and for its courageous examination of a friendship that transcended cultural and racial differences.... It is nowadays impossible for us to read the account of the friendship between Charley and Otoo so simply.... By the 1970s, as editors began to see the complexity of the ideas about race embedded in \\"The Heathen\\", it simply became easier to drop the story from collections altogether.\\" pp129‚Äì130 Jack London, Gary Riedl and Thomas R.

In it, he suggested that blacks did not descend from Ham, son of Noah, and thus did not descend from Adam and Eve.

It is a philosophical proposal intended to restore or energize democracy by social constructionism via an argument style of world disclosure but which philosophy is distinct from: *Relativism - a concept in which points of view have no absolute truth or validity. *Formalism - an emphasis on form over content or meaning in the arts, literature, or philosophy *Essentialism - the view that, for any specific entity (such as an animal, a group of people, a physical object, a concept), there is a set of attributes which are necessary to its identity and function. Nevertheless, the authors build on these ideas and seek to reformulate the relationship between democratic rights and economic progress when persistent technological advance obscures an uncertain future for humanity threatened by multiple issues such as peak oil, global warming and environmental degradation. The authors concentrate on three practical activities: * social entrepreneurship, * active citizenship and * social solidarity The authors reason that human beings are at their best when engaged in imaginative and practical innovation rather than in abstract reflection, and thus challenging accepted wisdom and conventional practices within their particular environment, or as the authors claim, when they are making history. History-making, in this account, refers not to political power changes, wars or violent revolution, but to changes in the way people understand their personal qualities and deal with their particular situations. Structure of the work World disclosure (German: Erschlossenheit, literally \\"development or comprehension\\") is a phenomenon first described by the German philosopher Martin Heidegger in his landmark book Being and Time. As well as the authors of this work, the idea of disclosing has also been discussed by philosophers such as John Dewey, J√ºrgen Habermas, Nikolas Kompridis and Charles Taylor. It refers to how things become intelligible and meaningfully relevant to ordinary people. Conclusion The authors reiterate the importance of history making and identify three types of actors: * The entrepreneur * The virtuous citizen * The culture figure Each has to overcome resistance to change, but do so in different ways. Solving puzzles request of each a clear strategic objective, but use different tactics to overcome obstructions. By understanding and disclosing our objectives, and discovering the sort of role we may have to play according to particular situations to reach those goals, all of us can be \\"history makers\\" and make changes to our society by changing the shared narrative that binds our particular culture. The authors quote already changed collective attitudes which have recently become much less tolerant of road accidents, various forms of discrimination and repressive public education of young people. They promote a change to the overarching consumerism as the western world's social and economic order and ideology that encourages the acquisition of goods and services in ever-increasing amounts, in favor of sustainable development within individual communities as a precursor to disclosing a new world order that supports human equality Later editions * 1999 a new English language edition was published in United States * 2000 Version Espa√±ol was published in Spain See also * Utopia for Realists * Social justice * Distribution of wealth * Income distribution * Protestant work ethic * Georgism * Critical theory * Critical thinking * Utopian socialism * Ethical socialism References Academic works about philosophy Belief Humanities Postmodernism Postmodern theory 1997 non-fiction books Literary collaborations ","title":"Disclosing New Worlds"},{"id":"48656180","text":"The Fitilieh programme protests (Persian: ÿ¨ŸÜÿ¨ÿßŸÑ ÿ®ÿ±ŸÜÿßŸÖŸá ŸÅ€åÿ™€åŸÑŸá lit.

Carney was best remembered as the host of Uncle Don, a children's radio program produced between 1928 and 1947 and broadcast from WOR in New York. Early life Don Carney was born Howard Rice on August 19, 1896, in St. Joseph, Michigan and was educated in Michigan public schools. Rice left home and entered the vaudeville circuit at a young age. He began performing stock Irishman parts. It was performing these parts at the age of 15 when he first used the stage name Don Carney. Carney traveled throughout the Midwest in stock shows before settling as an announcer at WOR in New York in 1924. Career Uncle Don In 1928, the station premiered Uncle Don, a children's radio program hosted by Carney. The program featured \\"Uncle Don\\", as Carney was dubbed, singing, playing the piano, telling stories and introducing many different events pertaining to the lives of the children, dubbed as Don's \\"nieces\\" and \\"nephews\\", who listened to the program. Some segments of the program included the \\"Healthy Child's Club\\" and the \\"Talent Quest\\". Winners of the Talent Quest were sometimes offered movie screen tests. Except for the small amount of time during the mid-1930s when the show was broadcast nationally from the newly formed Mutual Broadcasting System, Uncle Don aired five, sometimes six, times a week, Monday through Saturday afternoons with occasionally a story or two on Sunday mornings, over WOR in New York. Carney soon generated possibly the largest audience of any locally produced children's show in broadcasting history. The \\"little bastards\\" rumor Uncle Don ended abruptly in 1947 and for a long time there was speculation in regards to how and why the program ended. The reality is that he simply left the program, but a popular urban legend is that Carney was fired after an embarrassing incident at the conclusion of a 1947 broadcast. According to the legend, after ending his program with his usual \\"Goodnight, little friends, good night\\" sign off, Carney thought he was off the air and exclaimed, \\"There! That ought to hold the little bastards\\"‚Äîbut his microphone was still live, and his comment was broadcast to his radio audience. The legend goes on to state that public outrage caused Carney's termination from radio. The story subsided after a while. But, shortly after Carney's death in the mid-1950s, a man by the name of Kermit Schaefer resurrected the story once again. Schaefer was a radio and television writer/producer during the 1950s and 1960s, who also produced some classic comedy and jazz records on the Jubilee label. Schaefer was best known for his collection of \\"bloopers\\" ‚Äì radio and television mistakes, gaffes, malaprops, spoonerisms, and tongue twisters. Schaefer's \\"bloopers\\" later became the inspiration for the television shows TV's Bloopers & Practical Jokes and America's Funniest Home Videos. A 1945 motion picture, Pardon My Blooper, featured many of Schaefer's collected works. After Carney died, Schaefer featured a \\"recording\\" of the \\"little bastards\\" incident on his Bloopers album. The legend has since been proved to be just that, a legend. The \\"recording\\" was proven to be just a fabricated recreation of the legend. In reality, Carney left New York in 1947 for Miami. Later career and death Carney moved to Miami, Florida where he again hosted his own children's radio program at WKAT in Miami Beach, Florida. He suffered from heart failure in his last years and died Thursday January 14, 1954 at his home in Miami at the age of 57. His final show aired the previous Wednesday. He was never married nor did he have any children. He was cremated shortly after his death.

In the years after the 1543 publication of De humani corporis fabrica, the physician Andr√© V√©sale was confronted with a high number of imitators and plagiarizers. It was a groundbreaking work on anatomy, over 700 pages long and filled with illustrations.  Derived works  In the same year as the original publication, Vesalius published a shorter version or abridgement of this work, which featured many illustrations of the original. It was dedicated to Philip II of Spain. Two years after the 1543 publication, Thomas Geminus (the pseudonym of Thomas Lambrit) printed another abridgment: the Compendiosi totius Anatomiae delineatio. An English translation of this work would appear in 1553 and 1559. Geminus took many of the illustrations from the Fabrica, but unlike the original, printed them on separate sheets. This is caused by the fact that Geminus decided to use copper intaglio plates rather than woodcuts as in the original. Geminus was an engraver and may have done the illustrations. Because of this, the relation between text and images is less clear and many images are gathered on a single sheet without any relation. His copper plates were sold or lent to Parisian printer Andr√© Wechel who also prepared two editions, a Latin one in 1564 and a French edition in 1569. The Latin edition appeared under the title Anatomes totius aere insculpta delineatio. In 1565 he printed a second edition. The illustrations are also on separate plates. One of the most remarkable plates is an illustration of Adam and Eve at the beginning of the book. The book is somewhat between an abstract and a compendium. Because of the high number of plates, it was more accessible to the non-specialist. Many of the illustrations were simplified versions of Vesalius's original work. The remarkable landscapes behind the dissected bodies, once so prominent, disappeared. The watermarks of the first Wechel edition (1654) may have been from London. That would most likely mean that the sheets were printed in London and transported to Paris. However, the second edition also contains this watermark of a gauntlet and a star. The precise details remain unknown. One possibility is that Geminus sold the printed sheets instead of the plates.

Following the Conquest, he moved to this valley rich with spring waters and established a tekke with his murids. The tekke was last revived by the Naqshbandi Shaykh Abdulhakim Efendi of Bukhara between 1876-1889. It is thought that the complex first fell into disuse, along with all other Bektashi lodges in and around Istanbul, with its closure following the Auspicious Incident of 1826. Its followers were exiled from the area. Following an inactive period of half a century, during the reign of Sultan Abdulhamid II, it was turned over to Shaykh Abdulhakim by Abdulkadir Pasha, the commander of Istanbul central command. The pasha helped rebuild the center. Upon Shaykh Abdulhakim's passing in 1889, he was buried near Akbaba Sultan behind the tekke, which came to be Akbaba Cemetery extending up the hillside. His son Ahmed Mansur Mukerrem Efendi took his place and was active until the declaration of all tekkes and zawiyas to be illegal in 1925. The law for the closure of traditional institutions was passed on 30 November 1925 as part of Mustafa Kemal's reforms and revolutions. Religious institutions started to appear in public life along with the multi-party system following the 1950 Turkish general election. By this time, most of the tekke buildings were destroyed and only the mosque and attached harem section remained. The harem section was turned into an imam's office. The government of President Erdogan and his AK Party supported religious institutions and restored the mosque in the 2000s. The mosque was rebuilt again in the 2010s, keeping true to its original wooden form on a stone foundation, and reclaiming the entire borders of the complex with landscaping and a stone border wall.Beykoz Akbaba Sultan T√ºrbesi, onbinleri aƒüƒ±rlayacakAkbaba Canfeda Hatun Camisi Restore Ediliyor!

Zachrisson's efforts in philology consist partly of historically oriented theses, in toponymy and pronunciation history, and of modern grammar and stylistics. Zachrisson discussed Nordic influences in English place-names in his research, as well as Roman, Celtic and Saxon influence on English, and the etymology of place-names. His further work added to our understanding of the pronunciation rules and history of pronunciation in Modern English from 1400-1700, and especially during Shakespeare's time. In 1930, Zachrisson made a noted effort in the issue of world languages by launching a simplified English spelling system: Anglic. He also founded the journal Studia Neophilologica in 1928.

She is the founder of Center for Mohiniyattam, a dance academy promoting Mohiniyattom and the co-author of two books, Art of Mohiniyattom and Mohiniyattom. She is a recipient of the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award and Sahitya Kala Parishad Samman. The Government of India awarded her the fourth highest civilian honour of the Padma Shri, in 2004, for her contributions to Indian classical dance.  Biography  Bharati Shivaji was born in 1948 in the temple town of Kumbakonam, in Tanjavur district of the south Indian state of Tamil Nadu, and had her early training in Bharatnatyam under Lalita Shastri and Odissi under Kelucharan Mohapatra. Later, on advice from Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay, renowned social reformer, she took up research on Mohiniyattom, the traditional dance form of Kerala. After obtaining a research fellowship from Sangeet Natak Akademi, she traveled to Kerala and pursued research under Kavalam Narayana Panicker, a scholar of the Temple Arts of Kerala and former vice-chairman of Sangeet Natak Akademi. Shifting her focus from Bharatnatyam and Odissi, she started training Mohiniyattom under Radha Marar and, later, under Kalamandalam Satyabhama, and also had a training stint under Kalamandalam Kalyanikutty Amma, considered by many as the Mother of Mohiniyattom.  Legacy  Moving to New Delhi, Shivaji founded the dance academy, Center for Mohiniyattom, a dedicated facility for promoting the dance form. She is known to have contributed to the evolution of the dance tradition, by adding more languor to the already languorous discipline, and by adapting it to other dance forms such as ballet; her Mohiniyattom adaptation of the Swan Lake of Tchaikovsky, choreographed along with her daughter, Vijayalakshmi, is one such effort. Her productions include adaptations of Bhanusinger Padavali of Rabindranath Tagore, Chandrotsavam of the Manipravalam, Somastuthi from the Rig Veda, and the Devagita, from Ashtapadi. She is known to have incorporated postures, movements and music from other Traditional art forms of Kerala such as Ottamthullal, Kaikottikali, Thayambaka and Krishnanattam into Mohiniyattom, a legacy from her tutelage under Kavalam Narayana Panicker. In 1986, Shivaji published his first book, Art of Mohiniyattam, co-authored by Avinash Pasricha. The book documents her researches under Sangeet Natak Akademi fellowship and a subsequent senior fellowship from the Department of Culture under the Ministry of Human Resource Development and is a reference book on the subject. She published another book, Mohiniyattam, co-written by her daughter, Vijayalakshmi, herself a noted Mohiniyattom performer, in 2003. The book deals with the history and evolution of the art form and comments about the styles and techniques, repertoire, music, costumes and jewellery associated with it. She has performed on several stages in India and abroad and has taught many Indian and foreign students. She also continues her research by visiting temples and gives lecture- demonstrations on the dance form at conferences and seminars.  Awards and honours  Shivaji was awarded the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award in 1999-2000. Four years later, the Government of India included her in the 2004 Republic Day Honours list for the fourth highest civilian award of the Padma Shri. She is a recipient of the Sahitya Kala Parishad Samman, Lasya Lakshmi title from Kunchan Nambiar Memorial Trust, Kerala and Nritya Choodamani title from the Krishna Gana Sabha, Chennai. She won the Nishagandhi Puraskaram of the Government of Kerala in 2017. Sara and Urs Baur, two American filmmakers, have made a documentary, Beyond Grace, on Mohiniyattom and the art of Shivaji which features her daughter, Vijayalakshmi, too. The 78-minute film, which details the work of the mother-daughter combination, was premiered on 9 July 2011 at the Raleigh Theatre, Hollywood, Los Angeles.

Athenian moicheia was restricted to illicit sex with free women, and so men could legally have extra-marital sex with slaves and prostitutes. Famously, Athenian culture and adultery laws considered seduction of a citizen woman a worse crime than rape. Definition The act which is usually rendered in English as \\"adultery\\" was called moicheia () in Greek. Moicheia was defined more broadly than the English \\"adultery\\", however, referring to any \\"seduction of a free woman under the protection of a kyrios\\". Thus, sex with the wife, daughter, or sister of a free man were all considered to be instances of moicheia. In at least one case, detailed in the speech Against Neaera, we know that an alleged moichos was imprisoned based on a father's right to punish moicheia committed against his daughter. In Athenian law, moicheia was always committed by men upon women. Against this view of moicheia, David Cohen has argued that it was limited to sex with citizens' wives, and that the word moichos was synonymous with the modern English \\"adulterer\\", but this view has been largely rejected by other scholars. Married men were not considered to have committed adultery if they were to have sexual relationships with slaves or prostitutes. Adultery and the law An Athenian law on adultery (graphe moicheias) is known to have existed, though it has not survived.Forsdyke cites pseudo- Xenophon, Constitution of the Athenians 59.3 for this claim. However, the reference she gives is to Aristotle, Constitution of the Athenians 59.3. The pseudo-Xenophontic Constitution only has three chapters. Christopher Carey argues that the law cited at ¬ß28 of On the Murder of Eratosthenes is an otherwise unknown law on adultery, which prescribed the actions to be taken in cases of moicheia and specified killing the culprit as an option. Along with the law on moicheia reconstructed by Carey, three Athenian laws which concerned moicheia have survived, all preserved in the works of fourth-century BC orators. The first of these prohibited a man from living with an adulterous wife, and an adulterous wife from taking part in public religious ceremonies.Demosthenes 59.86-87 The second exempted a kyrios who killed a moichos caught in the act.Demosthenes 23.53Lysias 1.30 The third surviving law concerning moicheia protected an accused adulterer from illegal imprisonment.Demosthenes 59.66 It is cited by Apollodoros in Against Neaera, and modern editors have largely taken it to mean that a man who has sex with a prostitute cannot be indicted for moicheia. Johnstone, however, argues for a different reading of the passage, which protects men from being imprisoned for moicheia in cases where they have been involved in business relationships with women. In Classical Athens, moicheia was according to Lysias considered to be a more serious crime than rape or sexual assault, because seduction of a woman implied a long-term relationship, where her legitimate family had their place in her affections supplanted. Historians have generally believed Lysias' claim that seduction was considered to be more serious than rape, though not all have accepted Lysias' explanation for this. For instance, Christopher Carey argues that this explanation was merely a post-hoc rationalisation, and that in fact the law was more concerned with the possibility of illegitimate children in cases of adultery. The view that seduction was considered to be a worse crime than rape has been questioned by more recent scholars, however. For example, Eva Cantarella, dismisses Lysias' claim as \\"ingenious but totally inconsistent\\", and argues that rape and adultery could both be punished with a range of penalties, of which in both cases the most severe was death. Similarly, Edward Harris observes that portraying rape as a less severe crime than adultery is in the interest of the speaker in Lysias' speech, and argues that rape could be prosecuted as hubris, for which death was a potential penalty. History The law which allowed the killing of a moichos caught in the act as a justifiable homicide seems to have been part of the homicide law set down by Draco, while the laws which set down alternative penalties for adulterers were probably Solonian in origin. Mistreating and ransoming adulterers seems to have a much longer history, however, with precedent going back to Homeric times. For instance, in Book VIII of the Odyssey, Hephaistos captures Ares and Aphrodite in bed together and displays them in front of the other gods to be ridiculed. Sanctions There were at least four possible responses to adultery open to the aggrieved party. Firstly, if the adulterer was caught in the act, they could be summarily executed by the kyrios of the woman they were found with. This was legal both under the Draconian code's provisions for justifiable homicide, and, as Carey believes, under the Solonian law on moicheia. This is what Euphiletos claimed had happened in On the Murder of Eratosthenes. However, this was probably an uncommon response, and modern scholars generally believe that this penalty was only rarely exacted. Andrew Wolpert lists three alternatives to this course of action: to charge the offender in a court of law, to extract a financial penalty, or to subject the offender to physical abuse. The punishment for an offender convicted of moicheia is unknown. However, in many public actions the jury had the responsibility for selecting the punishment, and Eva Cantarella suggests that this could have been the case for the graphe moicheias. The most common means of punishing adulterers probably involved the last of these options, physical abuse with the aim of humiliating the offender. Christopher Carey believes that this maltreatment of a moichos was explicitly permitted in law. However, Sara Forsdyke has disagreed, arguing that it was in fact a form of extra-legal collective punishment. Comic sources describe the abuse and humiliation of those guilty of moicheia, including a scene in the Clouds where Aristophanes refers to an adulterer being punished by the insertion of a radish into his anus. Other comic punishments for adulterers include the removal of pubic hair. Kapparis has argued that both of these punishments were intended to humiliate the adulterer by feminising them, as depilation was a standard part of a female beauty regimen in Classical Athens, and being penetrated was associated with femininity. The historian David Cohen has questioned the idea that these comic forms of abuse were carried out in reality, but Konstantinos Kapparis and Christopher Carey have argued that the reason that these jokes had such longevity in comedy was precisely because they were a reflection of reality. A married woman who was discovered committing adultery would be divorced and prohibited from participating in public religion. If her husband did not wish to divorce her, he might lose his citizen rights. Roy suggests that a husband might have risked this, however, either to keep the dowry or to avoid scandal. An unmarried woman caught in adultery by her kyrios could be sold into slavery, though there is no known instance of this penalty in fact being carried out. Comparison with other Greek cities In Hieron, Xenophon claims that the right to kill a moichos was enshrined in law not just in Athens but throughout the cities of Greece. However, the adultery laws which we know of through other sources from elsewhere in Greece tend to enforce either financial penalty or abuse and humiliation, rather than death, as a punishment. In ancient Gortyn, the penalty for seduction was a fine of up to 200 staters. Gortynian adultery law said that unless payment was made within five days, the kyrios could abuse the adulterer however he wished, paralleling the abuse of adulterers permitted in Athens. In various other Greek cities, we have stories of adulterers being publicly humiliated as a form of punishment. According to Plutarch, the people of Cyme called adulterous women \\"donkey riders\\". Aristotle says that in Lepreum in the Peloponnese, male adulterers were bound and led around the city for three days, while adulteresses were made to stand in the agora in a transparent tunic for eleven days. In Pisidia, we are told that adulterers and adulteresses were paraded around the city together on a donkey. In some places in the Greek world, the punishment for adultery could be more severe, though again stopping short of death. In Epizephryian Locris in southern Italy, for instance, a moichos could be punished by blinding. In other cities, such as Lepreum and Cumae, the moichos was at risk of atimia - the loss of civic rights.

In the copyright law in the United States, such copyright may exist when the materials in the compilation (or \\"collective work\\") are selected, coordinated, or arranged creatively such that a new work is produced. Copyright does not exist when content is compiled without creativity, such as in the production of a telephone directory. In the case of compilation copyright, the compiler does not receive copyright in the underlying material, but only in the selection, coordination, or arrangement of that material. In the European Union, copyright in compilation due to the creativity of selection and arrangement is one facet of the Database Directive of 1996, which also protects databases from extraction of substantial content that represents significant work by the compiler.  Copyright of material used in compilation  A compilation may include any combination of public domain material or copyrighted material, owned by the compiler or others. If a compilation utilizes material under copyright by someone else, compilation protection does not grant the compiler rights to that material or permission to use it without license, and it does not give the compiler the right to prevent others from reusing the individual elements in the compilation. Rather, it exists independently of any copyright protection that may apply to the material used in the compilation itself. Confusion sometimes occurs when the copyright status of the elements is conflated with the copyright status of the compilation. For instance, copyright on a filmed musical may lapse, but public display of the film without license may remain a copyright infringement if the songs performed therein are still protected by copyright.  Examples  Under the U.S. law, which protects the human creativity expressed in the selection, coordination, or arrangement of the material, the copyright office gives the following examples of compilations in which copyright might exist, as each represents compilations that reflect human creativity in preparation: * A directory of the best services in a geographic region * A list of the best short stories of 2011 * A collection of sound recordings of the top hits of 2004 * A book of greatest news photos * A website containing text, photos and graphics * An academic journal containing articles on a particular topic * A newspaper articles by different journalists * A catalog of texts and photographs.  Feist v. Rural (1991)  A critical case to the application of copyright in compilation in U.S. law is Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co., 499 U.S. 340 (1991), in which the Supreme Court clarified the role of creativity in protection. In the case appealed, Feist had copied information from Rural's telephone listings to include in its own, after Rural had refused to license the information. Rural sued for copyright infringement. The Court ruled that information contained in Rural's phone directory was not copyrightable and that therefore no infringement existed. Prior to this case, some U.S. courts were following the sweat-of-the-brow doctrine, which gave copyright to anyone who invested significant amount of time and energy into their work. At trial and appeal level, the courts followed this doctrine, siding with Rural. The appeal centered on two well-established principles in United States copyright law: facts are not copyrightable; compilations of facts can be copyrightable. In regard to collections of facts, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor stated that copyright can apply only to the creative aspects of collection: the creative choice of what data to include or exclude, the order and style in which the information is presented, etc., but not to the information itself. \\"Notwithstanding a valid copyright, a subsequent compiler remains free to use the facts contained in another's publication to aid in preparing a competing work, so long as the competing work does not feature the same selection and arrangement,\\" O'Connor wrote. The ruling has major implications for any project that serves as a collection of knowledge. Information (that is, facts, discoveries, etc.) from any source is fair game, but cannot contain any of the \\"expressive\\" content added by the source author. That includes not only the author's own comments, but also his choice of which facts to cover, his choice of which links to make among the bits of information, his order of presentation (unless it is something obvious like an alphabetical list), any evaluations he may have made about the quality of various pieces of information, or anything else that might be considered \\"original creative work\\" of the author rather than mere facts.  The European Union Database Directive (1996)  Shortly after the Feist decision, the European Union began working to create a unified approach to copyright in compilation for databases. In 1996, it released its Database Directive, which incorporated approaches that had previously been used in much of continental Europe requiring creativity in the selection and arrangement of collected material and the sweat-of-the-brow approach of areas like the United Kingdom. Under Article 3 of the Directive, databases which, \\"by reason of the selection or arrangement of their contents, constitute the author's own intellectual creation\\" are protected by copyright as collections: no other criterion may be used by Member States. This may be a relaxation of the criterion for protection of collections in the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, which covers collections \\"of literary and artistic works\\" and requires creativity in the \\"selection and arrangement\\" of the contents. Any copyright in the database is separate from and without prejudice to the copyright in the entries. Copyright protection is not available for databases that aim to be \\"complete\\"‚Äîthat is, where the entries are selected by objective criteria: these are covered by sui generis database rights. While copyright protects the creativity of an author, database rights specifically protect the \\"qualitatively and/or quantitatively [a] substantial investment in either the obtaining, verification or presentation of the contents\\": if there has not been substantial investment (which need not be financial), the database will not be protected. Database rights are independent of any copyright in the database, and the two could, in principle, be held by different people.

In January 1973, he also participated in the sculptural clay group exhibition held at the MacKenzie Art Gallery (University of Regina). This show caught the attention of the Canada Council for the Arts who selected Cicansky along with Joe Fafard, Russell Yuristy, and Marilyn Levine and Ann James for Canada Trajectoires ‚Äô73 in Paris, the first international exhibition of the Regina ceramists. In the following years this group exhibited across Canada and were known collectively as the Regina Clay Movement. Commissioned by the provincial government, Cicansky, Fafard, Yuristy, and David Thauberger, with Cicansky's father Frank and five other folk artists, created The Grain Bin for the 1976 Montreal Olympics. In 1977 and 1980 Cicansky's clay tableaux were selected to decorate the provincial government's Sturdy-Stone Centre in Saskatoon, an endorsement of Postmodernism and the Regina Clay Movement. Public Art Cicansky's earliest works included many large-scale public art commissions, including the murals The Old Working Class and The New Working Class for the Sturdy Stone Centre (1978‚Äì81), The Garden Fence for the CBC building in Regina (1981‚Äì84), as well as Regina: My World (1979) for The Co-operators (1979). He created the bronze The Garden of the Mind at the College of Agriculture in Saskatoon (1992) as well as a gateway sculpture and gazebo art piece for the Grow Regina Community Gardens (2009).

Family and early life His father was Gyula Drozdy the community's Roman Catholic cantor-teacher, father of five children. He attended grade school in Esztergom, later he continued his studies by completing the training school after which he studied special needs education in Budapest. Between 1907 and 1919 he worked as a teacher. During this period he started journalism, his first column being published in Ottok√°r Proh√°szka‚Äôs newspaper titled 'Esztergom'. He entered into compulsory military service at the outbreak of the World War I. After returning from the front in 1917 he became the managing editor of the ‚ÄòBudai √öjs√°g (Newspaper of Buda)‚Äô. He started his political career in 1918 as the secretary of the Independence and 48 Party. He was also a journalist for Mih√°ly K√°rolyi‚Äôs newspaper ‚ÄòMagyarorsz√°g (Hungary)‚Äô while also publishing in the ‚ÄòAlkotm√°ny (Constitution)‚Äô. In 1918 during the Aster Revolution he was part of the negotiations revolving around the head of state with King-Emperor Charles IV, and came to be scrivener of the Hungarian National Council. Political career After the military collapse in World War I the surrounding countries invaded the historical lands of the Hungarian state. Drozdy returned to his home county in Upper Hungary where he organized the local populace into a militia and fought the advancing Czech troops. Meanwhile, in January 1919 he became the secretary general of the National Smallholders and Agrarian Workers Party led by Istv√°n Szab√≥ de Nagyat√°d. On the elections in January 1920 for the Hungarian National Diet he was running in the county of Zala, as a candidate for the National Smallholders and Agrarian Workers Party. But before the second round the gendarmerie seized him, accusing him of collaborating with the communists and for his subversive actions in the Hungarian Soviet Republic era. Nevertheless, Drozdy won the elections with great majority. In one of his first speech's he strongly confronted the White Terror. He was one of the nine members of parliament who voted against making Mikl√≥s Horthy regent. He also spoke up against the Numerus clausus law. The parliament shortly after revoked his membership. On the elections that followed he nominated himself yet again and won decisively. He became one of the lead speakers for the opposition. In one of his significant speeches in parliament he rises up against the government's lack of action in pursuing the murderers and culprits of the White Terror, in particular mass murders committed by Iv√°n H√©jjas and his counter-revolutionary task-force. On the next elections in 1922, Istv√°n Bethlen the Prime Minister personally precepts the Ministry of Internal Affairs to sabotage his election, but regardless Drozdy gains a mandate. The government's intervention finally brings him down on the elections of 1926. Immigration On April 4, 1927 he and his entire family flee the country, due to political persecution, and seek asylum in the United States of America, and settle down in Chicago. He continues to be politically active and works in the American League for Revision of the Trianon Peace Treaty of Hungary as the executive vice president. At first he is lead journalist for ‚ÄòSzabads√°g (Liberty)‚Äô, and later founds his own newspaper ‚ÄòAz √çr√°s (Scripture)‚Äô, where he works as the editor- in-chief. Return to Hungary He returned to Hungary in 1932 and becomes the editor-in-chief of the newspaper ‚ÄòMagyar Falu (Hungarian Village)‚Äô. He runs on the 1935 elections as an unofficial candidate (against the favored official one) of the Hungarian Unity Party led by Gyula G√∂mb√∂s, and wins. He bolts from the Unity Party in November 1938 with those members, who oppose the appointment of B√©la Imr√©dy to be Prime Minister and the ruling parties‚Äô far right legislation. Drozdy becomes a member of the committee who is tasked with presenting the ‚ÄúSecond Anti-Jewish Law‚Äù and he opposed submittal and suggests several amendments. One of these which passes legislation is the exemption of descendants of fallen I. World War Jewish soldiers, or ‚Äúwar orphans‚Äù. On the 1939 elections he tried to runs as a candidate of the Independent Smallholders and Agrarian Workers Party in Zala county, but does not gain a seat, due to the administrative hurdles set before him. From September 1, 1939 to January 1944 he works as the CEO of the ‚ÄòEsti Kur√≠r (Evening Courier)‚Äô which was renown for its liberal, anti-German, pro-Anglo-Saxon and pro-Jewish politics. On March 19, 1944, since he is high ranked on the wanted list occupying Nazi troops he escapes capture by the requesting front duty. During his military service he speaks up against the war and tries to convince the officer corps of ending the war. For his activity he is brought to military court, but escapes. He organizes an armed resistance against the Nazis and on October 15, 1944 after the Coup d‚Äô√©tat of the Arrow Cross Party he is joined by Endre Bajcsy-Zsilinszky. The two politicians hide together in the western part of the Cserh√°t hills and create their partisan company in the forest near Nasz√°ly. Due to the capture of Endre Bajcsy-Zsilinszky and the increased presence of Nazi troops they have limited success. Drozdy returns to Budapest just before the encirclement is complete in the siege of Budapest. He returns to politics immediately after the siege and starts reorganizing the Independent Smallholders and Agrarian Workers Party, and yet again gains a seat in parliament. After World War II In the National Assembly Drozdy belongs to the right wing of the Smallholders Party, which meant that he strongly opposed the initiatives of the Hungarian Communist Party. In his speech in July 1946 he voices warnings and strong opposition of the Communistic One-party state. No wonder that he is the first victim of the Salami tactics of the Hungarian Communist Party, and is among the first politicians forced out of his own party on March 10. 1946. After the estoppel the expelled party members found a new party called the Hungarian Freedom Party. Dezs≈ë Sulyok presents the party's program on July 24, 1946. The cornerstone of the program is maintaining neutrality of the country (and independence), and ensuring the democratic rights and principles of parties. There is increased friction between the Freedom Party and Smallholders Party as the latter is increasingly becoming controlled by the Communist Party. The Hungarian Freedom party becomes the most diligent opponent, trying to shed light on the antidemocratic actions of the Communist Party. M√°ty√°s R√°kosi instructs Mih√°ly Farkas to start a conflict of interest procedure in the autumn of 1946, targeting to remove him from parliament. The proceedings fail at their attempt as Drozdy presents hard evidence including the testimony of Endre Bajcsy-Zsilinszky's widow and other documents of his anti-fascist and anti-German actions and the absurdity of the case. Due to constant pressure from the Communist Party the Hungarian Freedom party declares its dissolution on July 22, 1947. Many of its members including Dezs≈ë Sulyok flee the country and immigrate. When Drozdy finally gives in to the motion he is too late and he is arrested on the Jugoslav border and is taken to Andr√°ssy √∫t 60 by the State Protection Authority. He escapes by getting a message to his contacts by slipping a message to the doctor who is called in to prevent him from dying in his suicide attempt, before signing false documents. His properties and assets are seized and nationalized, he is forced to work as a semi-skilled worker, from painting and by-work. He is asked to play a political part in the 1956 revolution, but turns it down due to his old age and for the sake his young boy's safety. He dies in 1970.

This was the 2nd ICC World Twenty20. Pakistan lost eight wickets for the score of 50, its first World Twenty20 victory, after being the runners-up at the very previous tournament at 2007 Pakistan became the 2nd team to win this title after India. This was the second consecutive time where both the finalists were Asian teams. In the stadium, the match was watched by 28,000 spectators and almost 32 million people watched it on TV.  Background  Prior to this match Sri Lanka and Pakistan played 4 times against each other in Twenty20s, where both teams won 2 times each. Their most recent meeting was in that same event where Sri Lanka won by 19 runs. Including that they also met another time in the World Twenty20, which was in the previous event at 2007. Pakistan won by 8 wickets in that match.  Road to the final   Sri Lanka  Sri Lanka had a very smooth tournament excluding the final match. They were the only unbeaten team at that stage. They won against West Indies in the group stage and eliminated Australia in the group stage by beating them by six wickets. They were the group champions of Group C. In Super8s they were potted in the Group F. They won against Pakistan, Ireland and New Zealand to become the group topper of this group. Dilshan's unbeaten 96 helped Sri Lanka to beat the West Indies team by 57 runs and qualify for their first ICC World Twenty20 Final.  Pakistan  Despite entering the tournament with a number of the players who had finished second to India during the inaugural World T20, including all- rounders Shahid Afridi and captain Shoaib Malik, fast bowler Umar Gul and batsman Misbah-ul-Haq ‚Äì supported by teenage but promising left-arm pacer Mohammad Amir ‚Äì Pakistan's road to the final wasn't smooth like the Lankans. They were in the clinch of elimination at group stage, but a massive 82 runs win against the Netherlands washed out all the tensions for them. Though the loss against host England made them stay behind of the hosts at Group B. Still the tournament system made them the B1 of group B. In the Super 8s, they lost to the Sri Lankan team by 19 runs at their first match. which led them to another tension situation. But another gigantic and dominating win against New Zealand helped them to release the pressure, punctuated by Gul becoming the first bowler to record a five-wicket haul in a T20 international. An easy win against Ireland ‚Äì redemption for a number of the Pakistani players who had been in the ODI team that had lost to the Irish in Jamaica in the 2007 World Cup that not only knocked them out of the tournament but proved to be Bob Woolmer's final match coaching Pakistan before his death ‚Äì helped Pakistan to board on the semi final being the second of Group F next to Sri Lanka. In the first semifinal at Trent Bridge in front of a crowd including many Pakistanis living in Britain, they faced South Africa, who had come into the tournament as favorites and had lived up to the billing to that point, entering the match unbeaten. Afridi rose to the challenge, earning Man of the Match first with the bat thanks to 51 off 34 as Pakistan reached 149/4 during their 20 overs and then with the ball as he took 2‚Äì16 in his four overs after bowling both Herschelle Gibbs and AB De Villiers playing on. Supported by clutch death bowling from Gul and off-spinner Saeed Ajmal, Pakistan held on to secure an upset, winning by 7 runs.  Team Composition  Both teams were unchanged from their previous match at the semis. Match details Match officials On field: Daryl Harper On field: Simon Taufel TV umpires: Steve Davis Reserve umpire: Billy Bowden Match Referee: Chris Broad  Toss  Sri Lankan captain Kumar Sangakkara won the toss and chose to bat first.  Match Summary  Lasith Malinga bowling from the Nursery End in the Final at Lord's. The first over was bowled by Mohammad Aamer. After failing to score off the first four balls ‚Äì all short ‚Äì Dilshan went for his scoop and mistimed it, resulting in him being caught at short fine-leg. Soon after this, Jehan Mubarak top edged a delivery by Abdul Razzaq which went high in the air and was caught by Shahzaib Hasan, leaving Sri Lanka at 2 for 2. Sanath Jayasuriya was able to stabilise the innings for Sri Lanka hitting 17 runs off 10 balls, however, Jayasuriya soon fell as he dragged a good length ball back on to the stumps. Mahela Jayawardene followed after edging a shot into the hands of Misbah-ul-Haq, leaving Sri Lanka on 32/4. Sangakkara and Chamara Silva added further runs, before the latter was caught by Saeed Ajmal playing a pull shot off the bowling of Umar Gul. Shahid Afridi soon after, took the wicket of Isuru Udana with a googly which drifted into the right-hander, knocking the off-stump. This brought in Angelo Mathews, who along with Sangakkara took the score from 70/6 to 138/6, with 17 runs being scored off the last over bowled by Mohammad Aamer. Sri Lanka finished on 138/6 from 20 overs. Pakistan started off well with openers Kamran Akmal and Shahzaib Hasan adding 48 run for the 1st wicket, before Kamran Akmal was stumped by Kumar Sangakkara by the first delivery of Sanath Jayasuriya. Pakistan reached the target in 18.4 overs, with Shahid Afridi, who hit the winning runs, earning Man of the Match while Tillakaratne Dilshan was declared Man of the Series for his 317 runs at an average of 63.40.

Critical reception   Opening night  Adele at the Genting Arena, March 2016 The UK tour received rave reviews from music critics. Bernadette McNulty of The Daily Telegraph gave the opening show at The SSE Arena Belfast five stars. She referenced the expensive secondary market ticket prices for the tour, saying that \\"Adele is worth every penny\\". McNulty states that \\"Adele undoubtedly has the popularity to fill endless arenas, but maintaining the attention of thousands of people used to the hi- tech extravaganzas laid on by the likes of Taylor Swift and Beyonc√© can demand more flashing lights, dance routines and hydraulics than any natural talent. Her entrance was certainly theatrical, emerging from the centre of the arena underneath a main stage flanked by an Orwellian projection of her giant eyes blinking. But between that and some virtual, or possibly in Belfast real, rain, Adele kept it remarkably and effectively simple, letting nothing get in the way of what was almost a religious communion with her fans.\\" BBC News music reporter Mark Savage said that \\"Adele enjoyed a rapturous reception as she opened her world tour with an intimate arena show in Belfast.\\" Continuing his positive review, he said \\"even the steeliest of hearts would have been forced to concede she had brought the goods.\\" Amanda Ferguson from the Belfast Telegraph said that \\"Adele is fun, charismatic and exceptionally talented\\" in her four star review. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian opened his review by saying that Adele \\"delivers a solid - if unsurprising - show on the first night of her tour\\". In his four star review, Petridis noted Adele saying \\"I know some of you have been dragged along here tonight but I'm going to win you over\\", before concluding that \\"judging by the reaction as she finally disappears - on the same platform on which she appeared - she has managed it.\\" Nick Hasted of The Independent gave the show three stars, saying that \\"she tries soul moves over gospel piano, but owes more to Shirley Bassey than Aretha\\". Giving a mostly positive review, Hasted concluded the review by saying \\"Adele needs the nerve to make a defining leap, to become the bawdy, ballsy person she is on stage when she writes. Pop is dying for it.\\" The O2 Arena Adele sings \\"Set Fire to the Rain\\" at the Genting Arena, March 2016 The critical response was overwhelmingly positive when Adele performed six shows at The O2 Arena in her hometown, London. The Huffington Posts Ashley Percival gave one of the shows five stars: \\"By her own admission, most of her back catalogue is \\"fucking miserable\\", and I questioned quite how the Tottenham-born songstress would hold the attention of the packed O2 Arena without being able to rely on exhaustive dance routines or belting out some pop bangers to boost the energy. But the second she emerged through the floor of a small B-stage uttering those immortal words \\"Hello, it's me\\", any concerns just evaporated ‚Äî every single person in the room was in complete awe, and would stay that way for the entirety of the 18-song set.\\" David Smyth from the London Evening Standard said that \\"Adele shifted constantly from being a lightning rod for emotion to a light entertainer\\" in his four star review. He also complimented the show's opening performance of \\"Hello\\", saying that \\"isolated, with her large band hidden behind the screen, [Adele] held the room without trickery ‚Äî just one of the great singing voices.\\" Ludovic Hunter- Tilney from the Financial Times stated in his four star review that the show \\"had an old-school air of professionalism, sumptuously mounted and impeccably rehearsed.\\" Hunter-Tilney also said that \\"Flashy special effects were kept to a minimum, such as the downfall of water that surrounded her for \\"Set Fire to the Rain\\" towards the end. The absence of high-tech arena spectacle helped the show. It allowed Adele's personality to gain the upper hand over her professionalism.\\"  Genting Arena  Adele performed in the Genting Arena, Birmingham on 29, 30 March and 1, 2 April 2016 in a performance described as \\"mesmerizing\\", \\"jaw-dropping\\" and \\"breath-taking\\". Staples Center Billboard's Chris Willman took aim at previous reviewers of the tour who had criticised Adele for speaking too much during the concert in his positive review of the opening night of her stint at Los Angeles' Staples Center. He said \\"A few critics at the earliest stops on her first U.S. arena tour have made \\"shut up and sing\\"-type suggestions‚Ä¶ a would-be corrective measure that's unlikely to be wished for by almost any of her actual fans, who surely recognize that they're in the presence of not just one of the great singers in pop history, but one of the great broads.\\"  Domain Stadium  Adele's first performance in Australia at the Domain Stadium in Perth was met with universally positive reviews. Heather McNeill of The Sydney Morning Herald said Adele \\"was noticeably humbled by the massive crowd [the largest in West Australian concert history], admitting in her first many witty and warm chats with fans that she was a bit nervous.\\" She named \\"I'll Be Waiting\\", \\"Rumour Has It\\" and \\"Water Under the Bridge\\" as highlights calling them \\"flawless\\" and \\"soulful\\", as well as \\"Sweetest Devotion\\" and \\"Take It All\\".

It had a population of 5 households, all Muslim. It paid a fixed tax of 25% on agricultural products, including wheat, barley, summer crops, goats and beehives, in addition to occasional revenues; the taxes totalled 5,500 ak√ße.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 159 In 1870, Victor Gu√©rin noted here: \\"Several ancient cisterns are scattered about on the rocky plateau upon which stands Jett. The houses are rudely built. In the midst of the small materials of which they are principally constructed I observed a certain number of cut stones of ancient date. In the courtyard of one house I found an old capital of white marble hollowed to serve as a mortar, and now used to grind coffee.

The village is surrounded with wells, and has a few olives on the west. There are caves to the north, and springs about a mile to the north-west.[..] It may also perhaps be the Jethu, or Gath, of Thothmes III, a place north of the road which he pursued to Megiddo.\\"Conder and Kitchener, 1882, SWP II, p. 152 British Mandate era In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Jatt had a population of 680 Muslims,Barron, 1923, Table XI, Sub-district of Tulkarm, p. 27 increasing in the 1931 census to 780 Muslim, living in 165 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 55 In the 1945 statistics the population of Jatt was 1,120 Muslims,Department of Statistics, 1945, p. 20 with a total of 9,631 dunams of land according to an official land and population survey.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics.

He was a practitioner of kendo. He was a graduate of the University of Tokyo. As an associate justice in the mid-1960s, Ishida penned a dissenting opinion in a Grand Bench decision limiting criminal prosecution of labor leaders. This was a contributing factor to his appointment as Chief Justice by Prime Minister Eisaku Sato in 1968, in an attempt to give the court more conservative leadership at a time when Japan saw massive radical student demonstrations. One of Ishida's final decisions, in 1973, expanded police powers to punish demonstrators. Ishida's court was the first in a line of conservative Supreme Court benches that continued into the early 21st century. After his tenure as Chief Justice, Ishida formed the National Congress to Achieve Legislation of the Gengo System in order to establish a law authorizing the Emperor to determine Japanese era names. Ishida was a recipient of the Order of the Rising Sun and a member of the All Japan Kendo Federation.

The first set of these fixtures to be played was a three match series between the Australian team and the West Indies team, starting at the beginning of December. Background Since 1976, Kerry Packer, the owner of the Nine Network, had sought the rights to broadcast live coverage of Australia's home test matches, and had found himself rebuffed by the Australian Cricket Board in favour of continued live coverage on the Australian Broadcasting Company, which was the country's state broadcaster.Haigh (1993), p 34. Following Nine's winning of the rights to broadcast the 1977 Ashes tour to England, in which Packer was presented with the idea of staging some televised exhibition matches,Lillee (2003), p 129. he fleshed it out into the idea of a full blown series of games between the best Australian players, and the best players from the rest of the world. In 1977, Packer began signing contracts with Australian players recommended by former Australia captain Ian Chappell, while he was also able to negotiate a deal with then England captain Tony Greig for him to act as Packer's agent in signing non-Australian players.Wisden Cricketer magazine. Accessed 28 July 2007. Among these non-Australians were a significant number of players from the West Indies, who found the contracts they were being offered would pay them potentially more than they could earn in their entire careers. As a consequence, although only intended to feature Australia against the Rest of the World, the organisers were able to form a third team, made up wholly of West Indian players. The first match was scheduled as a five-day game between the Australian XI and the West Indies XI from 2 December 1977; Packer was unable to use the term \\"Test Match\\", so the fixture was the first of what came to be known as \\"Supertests\\". This game, held at VFL Park in Melbourne, began on the same day as the first day of the official Australian team's Test Match against India in Brisbane. Supertests Owing to the fact that the MCC holds the copyright to the Laws of Cricket, and Packer was therefore prevented from using them, he recruited former Australia captain Richie Benaud to formulate the rules and conditions for the new competition, which led to each over consisting of 8 balls.

The Shepherd Paris The Shepherd Paris is a c.1628 painting by the Flemish artist Anthony van Dyck, dating to just after the artist's return from Italy and showing the strong influence of Titian. It shows Paris during the Judgement of Paris, holding the golden apple he has been ordered to give to the most beautiful of three goddesses - unusually the artist focuses on Paris and does not show the goddesses themselves. A painting of Paris recorded as owned by the marquis de Voyer d‚ÄôArgenson in 1754 is probably to be identified with this work. It is now in the Wallace Collection. It was acquired by Henry Hope prior to 1807 before being bought by Francis Charles Seymour-Conway, 3rd Marquess of Hertford when the Hope collection was sold at Christie's on 29 June 1816. At that time, it was thought to be a self- portrait of van Dyck himself. The Marquess intended to bequeath the painting to George IV but he outlived the king and was unable to do so.

Since the 1980s, Chang has become a household name in Taiwan after hosting the CTS variety show Variety 100 (Á∂úËóù100) which is one of the most successful shows in the television history of Taiwan. She is also known for her work as the host of highly rated variety shows such as Weekend Pie (ÈÄ±Êú´Ê¥æ), Super Sunday (Ë∂ÖÁ¥öÊòüÊúüÂ§©), Million-Dollar Class (ÁôæËê¨Â∞èÂ≠∏Â†Ç) and SS Hsiao-yen Night (SSÂ∞èÁáï‰πãÂ§ú). In addition to her television and film work, Chang co-founded the record label Forward Music (Ë±êËèØÂî±Áâá) which launched the singing career of then newcomers A-mei and Tao Ching-Ying. She is also a mentor of television hosts Mickey Huang, Pu Hsueh-liang and Bowie Tsang. In an annual poll conducted by Reader's Digest in 2015, Chang was voted the most trusted Taiwanese variety show host. She was formerly the managing director of television channels TVBS Entertainment Channel and Azio TV, and the President of radio network UFO Network Broadcasting (È£õÁ¢üÂª£Êí≠).

There are two images of Buddha in sitting posture, one of which is enshrined in a small temple and various other images scattered in the village. The temple is the only extant Buddhist temple in the state. One of the images in a private farm was later housed in a meditation hall built during 2013 with the help of public contributions. Historians identify the images to the 11th century. With the presence of the images, Thyaganur is counted among Madurai, Kanchipuram, Nagapattinam, Uraiyur, Kaveripattinam and Perambalur among famous Buddhist centres in Tamil Nadu. The villagers administer the temple and practise worship similar to Hindu worship practises. History Image of the shrine Buddhism was popular in the region in modern-day Tamil Nadu around the 3rd century BCE during the rule of Asoka. It flourished under various ruling regimes until the advent of Bhakti movement during the 6th-9th centuries when the royal patronage decreased. During the rule of Chola emperor Raja Raja Chola, there were endowments to Buddhist shrines in Nagapattinam during the 11th century. The bronze Buddhist images found around Nagapattinam region dating back to 13th century and the religious texts by eminent Buddhist during the time indicate the presence of the religion during the period. Historians also attribute that Buddhism was not only restricted to big cities like Kanchipuram and Madurai, but smaller ones like Perambalur where the images are present. The set of images in the village are approximately dated to 11th century. Thyaganur is counted among Madurai, Kanchipuram, Nagapattinam, Uraiyur, Kaveripattinam and Perambalur among famous Buddhist centres in Tamil Nadu. Iconography The Buddhist images are located in villages around Perambalur. There are two major images of Buddha in the village Thiyaganur. One of them is enshrined in a small pillared compound, while the other is located in a private farm. The private farm was converted to a Buddhist Dhyana Mandap (meditation centre) during 2013 enshrining the image at a cost of 50 lakhs with public contribution. It was modelled similar to the Buddhist shrine in Rajagiri, Bihar. Both the images are tall in a cross legged seated posture and sported with coal black hair. Both the images are sported with a smile. Another image is found in the four way junction of Paravai, a village close to Thiyaganur. There is an image in Veeraganur Dalit Colony. Ogalur houses the image, which has been elevated to a higher structure in modern times by the villagers. There are many other images scattered in the villages, some which are in dilapidated condition. Culture Image of the Buddha in the pillared hall Most of the village people are not aware of the history of Buddha and treat him as just another god of the region. The common name given to the deity is \\"Buddha Samy\\", indicating Buddha the God. Hindu worship practises like decorating the images with decorative clothes and flowers are commonly followed. Lighting lamps and applying sacred ash in the forehead of the images are other common worship offered. People pray by placing stone on the head of the image for curing their bodily ailments. Some of the images are garlanded regularly, while some of the images are offered Pongal, a rice mixture offered to the deities as the last step of the rituals. The meditation centre built in 2013 can accommodate hundred people at a time and was targeted to be a tourist centre in the region.

Both fluorescence and phosphorescence are used. The same stamp may have been printed with and without these luminescent features, the two varieties are referred to as tagged and untagged, respectively.  Technology  Letters and postcards fed into an automated mail processing plant are illuminated with ultraviolet light. The reaction of the luminescent features of the stamps on this illumination is used to position the mail items such that the stamps can be cancelled, and that the significant parts of the address such as postcodes may be read and the mail be sorted accordingly. The luminescent features of the stamps are generally invisible or barely visible to the human eye in normal illumination. They can, however, be identified under ultraviolet light similar to the way it is done in the postal machinery. In general, fluorescent features can be identified with UV light of a longer wavelength than needed for phosphorescent features (see below). The luminescent substance (\\"taggant\\") can be printed over the whole surface of the stamp, the main design, the margins only, single bands or bars or other patterns, or can be added the paper itself. The tagging pattern can also be varied to enable sorting of mail according to the service class.  Methods and detection   Fluorescence  Upon absorption of light, fluorescent materials emit light upon of a longer wavelength (lower energy) than the absorbed radiation, but cease to do so once immediately, when the illumination is stopped. The tagging of stamps uses substances that absorb ultraviolet light of wavelengths between 300 nm and 450 nm (\\"Black light\\", UVA, long-wave UV) and emit light in the visible spectrum. Under UV illumination they usually glow a greenish or yellowish colour. It must not be confused with the \\"whitening\\" of paper which is achieved by adding optical brighteners that usually re-emit light in the blue region of the spectrum, making the paper appear whiter by compensating a perceived deficit in reflected colours of these wavelengths.  Phosphorescence  Phosphorescent materials release the absorbed energy only slowly, so that they exhibit an \\"afterglow\\". Materials for stamp tagging absorb ultraviolet light of wavelengths between 180 nm and 300 nm (UVC, short-wave UV) and emit light of a greenish or reddish colour depending on the substances used.  Detection equipment  Black light fluorescent lamp Fluorescent stamps can be detected with a black light fluorescent tube. Phosphorescent stamps can be detected using a shortwave UV lamp. The effects of both processes can be recorded photographically. Lamps for both ranges of wavelengths as well as combinations of both are available. Care must be taken when using UV lamps, since their light can damage the eyes.  Application in various countries  thumb|upright|Official letter concerning the introduction of the first tagged Canadian stamps  Canada  The first tagged stamps of Canada were issued in 1962 with vertical phosphorescent bands. In 1972, fluorescent general tagging was introduced, initially as vertical bars, now normally on all four sides of the stamp.  Germany  Deutsche Bundespost started issuing stamps on fluorescent Lumogen paper in 1960 in connection with trials for automated mail processing in the Darmstadt area. Fluorescent paper was generally used for stamps of Deutsche Bundespost and Deutsche Bundespost Berlin from 1961 on. Deutsche Post AG continues to use this technology. Deutsche Post of the GDR did not use luminescent tagging on stamps.  United Kingdom  Luminescent tagging has been added to postage stamps of the United Kingdom since the Wilding issues of 1959 in the shape of vertical bands. Stamps of the current Machin series have been printed with one or two such \\"phosphor bands\\",. those for second-class mail bear only one such band, those for first-class mail bear two. The positions of the bands may vary, stamps from booklets may have shortened, notched, or inset bands that do not extend onto neighbouring gutters to avoid the use of the latter instead of stamps for franking. Due to the presence of optical brighteners in many printing papers, phosphorescent materials were chosen for stamp tagging in the UK.  United States of America  The US Post Office Department started experiments with fluorescent compounds in the early 1960s. An 8¬¢ air mail stamp issued in 1963 was the first stamp printed for trials with new cancelling machines. The 5¬¢ City Delivery issue of 1963 was the first commemorative issue produced with tagging. Precancelled stamps and service-inscribed stamps are not usually tagged because they need not be routed through the cancelling equipment.  Other uses  Since luminescent ink or luminescent paper are only delivered to specialist printers, tagging also serves as an anti-counterfeiting measure, similar to the practice on banknotes.  Alternatives  When Deutsche Post of the GDR expanded automated mail processing in the 1980s, they did not use luminescent tagging, but used sideways illumination to identify the shadows of the stamp perforation in order to position mail items in cancelling and sorting machinery. Red light was used for this purpose, giving a good contrast to ordinary writing ink colours and enabling machine reading of postcodes. Some issues of Postal cards were printed entirely in orange to facilitate the latter process. However, the colours of the imprinted stamps was later changed to those of the usual definitives of the corresponding value, and simulated perforations were added around the stamp design to help locate the stamp position.

Early life After finishing university studies, Droppa started his career in the catering industry, working for Panonnia, Danubius and Olimpia hotels. In 1982, he opened his first own restaurant (Fondue Bar) at the Keleti K√°roly St. which became a popular meeting place among the \\"democratic opposition\\" members who criticized the Communist regime. Droppa has enabled to extension of samizdat publications in his restaurant. By 1988, he established further three catering units (Katlan Club, Vir√°nyos Club and J√≥kai Club), where several opposition events and rallies took place. During the transition process, he was a founding member of the re-established Hungarian Catering Corporation. In June 2009, the 1956 Institute claimed Droppa, as a member of the opposition party SZDSZ, was one of the state authority's 181 informer agents at the reburial of Imre Nagy and his martyr companions on 16 June 1989. Droppa rejected the accusation and expressed the possibility of a lawsuit. Later J√°nos M. Rainer, head of the institute backtracked from their standpoint and stated \\"there is no evidence that the state security organs did indeed looking for him and Droppa handed over reports.\\" Political career Droppa was one of the founders of the Duna K√∂r in 1984, which established as a protest body to prevent the construction of the Gabƒç√≠kovo‚ÄìNagymaros Dams. In 1990, he became charg√© d'affaires of the organization. He joined the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ) for a short time in 1989. In November 1989, he participated in the foundation of the Green Party of Hungary (MZP). Following the radical right-wing ideological turnout within the party by 1993, Droppa and several other environmentalist members decided to quit the party to establish the Green Alternative (ZA), with election of Droppa and Erzs√©bet Schmuck as its co-leaders. However the new party was unsuccessful at the 1994 parliamentary election, receiving only 0.02 percent of the votes. In January 1994, the ZA was admitted into the European Federation of Green Parties, which established under this name few months earlier. Despite the lack of domestic support, Gy√∂rgy Droppa was also elected to the European political party's leadership, holding his position as \\"key figure of the green politics\\" until 2009. In that capacity, Droppa established a good relationship with the GreenLeft, a prominent Dutch member of the federation. Beside that, Droppa also served as Director of the ISTER ‚Äì East European Environmental Research between 1993 and 1997. In September 1997, ZA joined the Union for Hungary electoral alliance, dominated by the Republican Party, however it did not gain any seats in the 1998 parliamentary election. Following the defeat, Droppa and M√°rta M√°rczis were elected co-presidents of the ZA. On 3 June 2000, the ZA merged with the Social Democracy 2000 Foundation to form the Alliance of Green Democrats (ZDSZ). The ZDSZ joined the Centre Party (or Centrum), with Droppa elected to its leadership, for the 2002 parliamentary election, but remained unsuccessful.Nohlen, D & St√∂ver, P (2010) Elections in Europe: A data handbook, p. 899. In the 2002 local elections, Droppa was the Centrum's candidate for the position of Mayor of Budapest, but received only 0.59 percent of the votes and came to the fifth place. On 16 November 2003, the ZDSZ transformed itself into a party alliance by merging several other minor movements. The V√©degylet, the Clean Air Action Group and other environmentalist NGOs rejected Droppa's integration efforts. On 31 December 2004, the ZDSZ left the Centre Party. The party could run only one representative at the 2006 parliamentary election. Droppa's leading role in the Hungarian section of the green movement had declined with the appearance and formation of the Politics Can Be Different (LMP). In reaction to this, the ZDSZ and the Workers' Party of Hungary 2006, merged into the Green Left and Droppa elected as its first president. However, despite the fact that LMP was not yet a member of the European Green Party, its key leader Daniel Cohn- Bendit personally expressed his sympathy and support to the new green-liberal organization for the 2009 European Parliament election. Cohn-Bendit said \\"I do not trust Gy√∂rgy Droppa anymore. For years, he keeps saying the same, and now it was enough. I do not see that there is a lot of chance to [Droppa] to take the necessary twenty thousand recommendation slips.\\" Cohn-Bendit also criticized Droppa for his party having merged with a Marxist movement. While LMP jumped over the electoral threshold in the 2010 parliamentary election, Droppa's Green Left received only 0.03% of the votes. Following the election, Droppa was replaced as party president by neo-Marxist philosopher G√°sp√°r Mikl√≥s Tam√°s.

This was the 4th ICC World Twenty20. West Indies won the match by 36 runs, its first World Twenty20 victory. This was West Indies's first major trophy since the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy. West Indies became the 4th team to win this title after India, Pakistan and England. This was the first time where a host team (SL) qualified for the final. In the stadium, the match was watched by 35,000 spectators.  Background  Prior to this match Sri Lanka and West Indies played 4 times against each other in Twenty20s, where Sri Lanka won all 4 times. Their most recent meeting was in the same tournament. In that group stage match Sri Lanka won by 9 wickets. Including that they also met each other twice in 2009 ICC World Twenty20, once in group stage and another in semi final. Both match were won by Sri Lanka. they won by 15 runs in the group stage and in the semi final they eliminated West Indies from the semi final with a dominating 57 runs win.  Road to the final   Sri Lanka  Sri Lanka were the favorite from the beginning of the tournament since they were the hosts. They made a flying start against Zimbabwe. They thrashed Zimbabwe and won by 82 runs. But they lost to South Africa by 32 runs (D/L Method) to finish second to South Africa in Group C and qualified for the Super 8 stage. Though the system of ICC World Twenty20 made them C1 of that group. They had a nice and smooth journey at Super 8 stage. They won comfortably against West Indies and England. But their first match at super 8 against New Zealand was a thriller where the result of the match was decided by super over and Sri Lanka won. They qualified for the semi final by being the topper of Group 1 with 3 wins in 3 matches. In the semi final they faced Pakistan. They won by 16 runs to qualify for the final of 2012 ICC World Twenty and their second world twenty20 final.  West Indies  The Windies arrived as a team that could make a run in the minds of some thanks to such players as famed power hitters and all-rounders Chris Gayle and Kieron Pollard and emerging star off-spinner Sunil Narine, but they did not begin the tournament well and were beaten by Australia in their first match. Their next match was against Ireland and it was washed away by rain. Both of the team received 1 point. But West Indies qualified for the Super 8 from Group B, next to Australia by the virtue of a superior Net run rate. In the super 8 stage they were placed to Group 1 with Sri Lanka, England and New Zealand. They won against England easily and won against New Zealand in super over. But they were thrashed by the hosts Sri Lanka. still with 2 wins in three matches they qualified for the semi final. A rematch against Australia in the semi finals, but an unbeaten 75 off 41 from Gayle, including four sixes, helped West Indies post a mammoth total of 205/4. Australia struggled to respond, eventually slumping to 131 all out.  Team Composition  Sri Lanka made one change from their winning team of semi final. Akila Dananjaya was in for Rangana Herath, while West Indies team were unchanged. Match details Match officials The on-field umpires were Aleem Dar of Pakistan and Simon Taufel of Australia, with Rod Tucker being the third (TV) umpire. Ian Gould was the fourth umpire. Jeff Crowe was the match referee. This match was the last match of Simon Taufel as an international cricket umpire.  Toss  West Indies captain Darren Sammy won the toss and chose to bat first.  Match Summary  Batting First, West Indies suffered an early collapse as both their openers Chris Gayle and Johnson Charles, were dismissed for three and 3 to leave the West Indies at 2‚Äì14 after 5.5 overs, resulting 14 runs after the end of batting powerplay that included first wicket maiden over bowled by Angelo Mathews. later then Marlon Samuels and Dwayne Bravo stabilized the innings added 59 runs in 8.5 overs. Marlon Samules played a knock of 78 from 55 balls, involving 3 fours and 6 sixes including the longest six of the tournament at 108 meters. Captain Darren Sammy also led a late charge that produced a small, but valuable knock of 26 runs of just 15 balls. West Indies added 108 runs in the last 10 overs resulting to able to the respectable score of 137 with the loss of 6 wickets and thus able to set Sri Lanka a target of 138. In reply Sri Lanka also did not get good start their opening batsman Tillakaratne Dilshan was bowled on duck by Ravi Rampaul. Then Kumar Sangakara started to move innings slowly. With the good tight bowling Sri Lankans were restricted to 39/1 after eight overs, With the fall of Wicketkeeper batsman Kumar Sangakara by Samuel Badree on the score of 48 in 10th over Started down Lankans in trouble. Just in span of 21 runs Sri Lankans were reduced to 69/7 in 14.3 overs including the two run outs. Nuwan Kulasekara mustered a brief fightback (26 runs from 16 balls) but holed out to leave the tail end exposed, and Sri Lanka was soon all out on 101 in 18.4 overs resulted in 36 runs short of the target. Captain Mahela Jayawardhane was the top scorer of 33 runs whereas Sunil Narine produced a brilliant figures of 9-3 in 3.4 overs.

The vessels The squadron consisted of three vessels, Butterworth, a full-rigged ship that four or six times the size of the two sloops that accompanied her. The role of each of the two sloops, Jackal and Prince Lee Boo, was to act as a ship's tender, to scout ahead in shallower waters, or to go off on errands. A man named Priestly owned both sloops. Butterworths buthen was 390 to 400 tons. Jackalls burthen 86 tons; Prince Lee Boos was 56 tons. (Burthen was a volumetric measure of cargo capacity, though expressed in tons.) As her burthen and several accounts attest, Prince Lee Boo was somewhat smaller than Jackal.Howay, Frederic W. A List of Trading Vessels in the Maritime Fur Trade, 1785‚Äì1825. Edited by Richard A Pierce. Kingston, Ontario, 1973 As was typical of the times, all three vessels were armed. Butterworth carried sixteen guns; the two smaller vessels had nine guns between them. Butterworth Butterworth was a former French vessel, built in 1778, that came into British hands in 1784. In British hands she became a whaler.Barrington, Daines and Beaufoy, Mark.

Voyage 1791‚Äì1795 Butterworth Expedition Sealing Camp on Staten Island, Drawing by Sigismund Bacstrom Although Sigismund Bacstrom, in a letter to Sir Joseph Banks of Aug. 1791, claimed that the expedition was a commercial venture aimed at bringing back \\"valuable drugs or natural products\\" and quite \\"independent of the new fur trade between Nootka and China,\\" there is no evidence that it was concerned with anything but the lucrative maritime fur trade and the sealery of Tierra del Fuego. In 1791 as the Butterworth expedition was being organized, Alderman Curtis was actively involved in the debate for opening the trade monopolies to Pacific Ocean trade held by the South Sea Company and the East India Company, particularly in light of the recent Nootka Convention with Spain which opened the Pacific Northwest Coast to British traders.Byrnes, Dan. Outlooks for England's South Whale Fishery, 1784‚Äì1800, The Great Circle, October, 1988., Sealing/Whaling Clubbing Seals at Staten Island, Detail from BacstromIn early 1792, Butterworth anchored in New Year's Cove on Staten Island, Tierra del Fuego, where they \\"built a Large Hut and left an Officer with a few Men there to kill Seals and boil Oil.\\"[Bacstrom] Butterworth would not return for these men until the end of 1793 when Butterworth was \\"dispatched towards England with directions to fish for whales and seals in passing through the Pacific Ocean, and at Staten Island where Mr. Brown had formed a temporary establishment.\\" Northwest Coast From Cape Horn the Butterworth squadron sailed to the Marquesas Islands and on to the Vancouver Island, reaching Clayoquot Sound in late July of 1792. In early August, Captain Brown claimed there was an unprovoked attack by the Tla-o-qui-aht People, killing one of his crew and seriously injuring two others, but other vessels present at the time told a different story. \\"The English sailors landed at a village in order to rob the natives and actually cut several skins off the natives' backs. Seeing them gathering to defend themselves, the sailors fired on them, by which they said four men were killed. This was before the natives were armed, but they found their mistake as soon as Wickaninnish's warriors turned out, who with two canoes made the whaleboats fly. Had not Captain Magee [of the ship Margaret] fired a cannon shot between them, they would certainly have been cut off ... However, the Englishmen ... took ample revenge. After they were out of port ... they fell in with some canoes fishing. Captain Brown got the men out of them and caused them to be whipped in a most unmerciful manner by the Sandwich Islanders he had on board. After that he threw them into the sea, and the ship Jenny ... being astern, fired at them and ended the tragedy.\\" One of the men killed was the brother of the chief Wickaninnish. Nootka Canoe, Detail from Bacstrom The Butterworth squadron then sailed north to Nootka and Haida Gwaii, returning to Nootka Sound in October. Sigismund Bacstrom, the Butterworth's surgeon and naturalist, left the Butterworth at Nootka on October 15, 1792 \\"on account of the ill and mean usage I received from Capt. W. Brown and his Officers.\\" Prince Lee Boo was often used to take soundings ahead of Butterworth. She was loaned to Captain George Vancouver for this purpose in Queen Charlotte Sound in 1793. The squadron did not procure many furs on their first visit to the Northwest Coast. They wintered in the Hawaiian Islands and returned early the next year, in the Spring 1793. They had better success the 2nd year, and at the end of Autumn Captain Brown dispatched Butterworth to return to England around Cape Horn, picking up the sealing party he had left there, with the seal skins they were expected to have procured. Brown then sailed in to Canton in Prince Lee Boo with all the furs collected by the three ships. According to Capt. George Vancouver, both Jackal and Prince Lee Boo made this voyage to Canton. Hawaii The Butterworth squadron first wintered at the Hawaiian Islands in February 1793, when control of the Islands was divided between Kamehameha who controlled Hawai'i and much of Maui, and Kahekili who controlled the islands west of Maui including Oahu and Kauai. Brown traded in weapons with both Kamehameha and Kahekili, but strongly favored the latter. In particular he entered into a contract with Kahekili giving Brown the title to the island of Oahu together with four islands to windward in return for weapons and military assistance, suppressing a revolt on Kauai. James Coleman, a seaman left in Ni'ihau by Captain Kendrick who had later joined Kehikili's forces, was given stewardship of the land for Capt. Brown and authority over foreign trade during Brown's absence.Menzies, Archibald. Hawaii Nei 128 Years Ago. Honolulu 1920 Although the exact date is in question, it was probably during this period of alliance with Kahekili that the Butterworth squadron became the first European vessels allowed to enter the inner Honolulu Harbor. By Hawaiian tradition, this contract would have ended upon Kahekili's death in 1794 Battle of Kuki'iahu Jackal and Prince Lee Boo returned to Oahu on 21 November 1794 to find a very different situation from the one they had left. On the death of Kahekili, his son Kalanikupule had succeeded him as ruler of Oahu, and Kahekili's half-brother Ka'eokulani, who had retained command of the Maui group of islands, was invading Oahu. This war became known as Kuki'iahu and was fought from November 16 until December 12, 1794. When Jackal and Prince Lee Boo arrived at Honolulu, Kalanikupule requested their assistance in the battle. In return Brown was to receive 400 hogs, and according to some accounts, authority over the island of Oahu. Eight men under the command of George Lamport, mate of the Jackal, joined Kalanikupule's forces in a series battles ashore while Captain Brown and the remaining crew defended the shoreline from the Jackal and Prince Lee Boo. Jackall fires on Lady Washington On December 3, 1794, during the conflict, the American Snow Lady Washington arrived in Pearl Harbor where she was \\"met with a very friendly reception by Capt. Brown.\\" On December 6 a battle was fought, Kalanikupule was victorious. The accounts differ as to what next happened. According to Captain Bishop of the British ship Ruby, Kalanikupule \\"came off and did homage to Brown as before, and at his return was saluted by one of the vessels, one of the guns happened to be shotted, which pierced the cabin of the American sloop [sic] and killed poor Kendrick at his table.\\" According to Capt. Boit of the American sloop Union, Kendrick \\"informed Capt. Brown that on the morrow he should cause the flag of the United States to be hoisted and fire a federal salute, which he begged might be answered by the two Englishmen, and it was accordingly agreed to, and Capt. Brown ordered three guns to be unshotted for that purpose, and about ten the next morning the ship Jackal began to salute, but on coming to the third gun it was discovered to be primed. So the apron of the fourth firearm was taken off which was fired and being shotted with round and grape shot, it pierced the side of the Lady Washington and killed Capt Kendrick as he sat at his table, and killed and wounded many upon the deck.\\" James Rowan, the mate of Lady Washington at the time, would later say that \\"he had sworn since Captain Kendrick's death he would salute no vessel in a hurry, except at a safe distance.\\"Howay, F. W. The Ship Eliza in Hawaii 1799 Annual Report of Hawaiian Historical Society, 1934 Captain Kendrick's body was buried ashore. Shortly thereafter Lady Washington sailed for Canton. Hawaiian Double Canoe, Detail from Bacstrom Capture of Jackal and Prince Lee Boo Ka'eokulani's invading forces were defeated on December 12. Soon after, a dispute arose between Capt. Brown and Kalanikupule over what was owed to Brown regarding his claims to Oahu and his obligations to Kalanikupule. The exact nature of this dispute is not clearly recorded, but it has been suggested that Kalanikupule may have requested that Brown and his men assist Kalanikupule in an attack against Kamehameha on Hawai'i, and Brown may have refused. If Brown did indeed have a land claim from Kalanikupule, this would have traditionally required him to serve in time of war, and to refuse would have been considered rebellion, punishable by death. Kalanikupule then decided to kill Captain Brown and capture Jackal and Prince Lee Boo. At his general's advice, he agreed to pay the 400 hogs. On January 1, 1795 the hogs were herded down to the beach to be slaughtered and salted down in barrels. But a great quantity of salt was needed for the task, so a party of men and a boat were sent some distance to collect it. As the mates of Jackal and Prince Lee Boo told the story soon afterwards: \\"When the greatest part of the crew of the Jackall being on shore salting pork and the remainder part away with their boat collecting salt, except [Capt. Brown] and one man, and part of the crew of the Prince Le Boo likewise on shore on duty, that the natives of the said island about ten a.m. on the 1st of January attacked the said vessel with several canoes, killed the commander William Brown and Robert Gordon and wounded several others and got possession of the vessel.\\" Kalanikupule and his generals then determined to attack Kamehameha's forces on Hawai'i. On January 3 the captured crew was put to work preparing the vessels for sea, and on January 11 they were ready to sail for Hawai'i. Kalanikupule ordered all of the arms and ammunition to be loaded into the two captured vessels, along with all the captured crew, although he was advised by his general to divide them among the canoes. This proved to be a fatal mistake. According to Lamport and Bonallack who were present, on Another early manuscript gives more detail: With Kalanikupule, his wife and four of their attendants confined in Jackal's cabin, Jackal and Prince Lee Boo sailed for Hawai'i, releasing Kalanikupule, his wife and one attendant in a canoe as they passed Diamond Head at daybreak. When they arrived at Hawai'i, Lamport and Bonallack informed John Young and Kamehameha of Kalanikupule's invasion plans, and of their intentions \\"to proceed immediately to China as our distressed situation will not allow us to proceed around Cape Horn.\\" They were able to trade for provisions, handing over Kalanikupule's arms and ammunition as payment. Conclusion of the Voyage Jackal and Prince Lee Boo arrived in China, and are reported to have been sold there. Prince Lee Boo is last listed in Lloyd's Register for 1794. Several of the crew of Jackal and Prince Lee Boo remained in the Pacific, notably Capt. Alexander Stewart and John Harbottle, who had both been officers in the Butterworth squadron and became prominent officers in the navy of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Stewart had left Jackal in Macao in 1793, returning to Hawai'i to marry, probably in 1795. Harbottle later sailed on the ship Nautilus and was severely injured when the crew was attacked in Formosa, reportedly in retaliation for earlier depredations by Capt. Brown when the Butterworth squadron visited the island in 1793. Butterworth successfully returned to England on 3 February 1795, with Sharpe, master. She was carrying 85 tuns of whale oil and 17500 seal skins. She then made several more whaling voyages. Lloyd's List reported that Butterworth, Folger, master, had been lost on 13 July 1802 off St. Jago, while outbound to the Southern Fisheries. One man was drowned, but the rest of the crew were saved and returned to Portsmouth.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4289. Accessed 25 November 2016.

Her husband Hou Yao was also a Chinese film pioneer and advocate for gender equality, and the couple influenced each other's style. Life and career Pu Shunqing attended Southeast University in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, majoring in political economy. At the university she formed the \\"Southeast Drama Society\\" with her classmate, and later, husband Hou Yao. She wrote the well-known three-act play, Paradise on Earth, which adds a female character named \\"Wisdom\\" to the plot of the Book of Genesis. Wisdom prods Eve to eat the apple and build a paradise on earth. Pu called for women's liberation through the mouth of Wisdom, who declares that \\"if you don't believe in God, he will disappear.\\" In 1924, Pu starred in the film The World Against Her directed by Hou; this was their first collaboration. She wrote the screenplay for Cupid's Puppets in 1925, making her the first Chinese female screenwriter; it was made into a film that same year. Playwright Hong Shen noted that Pu and her husband mutually influenced each other's style and moralism. Both Pu and Hou were concerned with stories that focused on women, and Pu likely had an influence on her husband's advocacy of women's rights. Pu, along with her husband, joined the China Sun Motion Picture Company in 1926. She helped Hou edit the film God of Peace in that year. In 1927, she served as the assistant director and scriptwriter for the film Way Down West. Paradise on Earth, a collection of her plays, was published in 1928. She would write the scripts for Cai Gongshi and Mulan Joins the Army before the China Sun Motion Picture Company would go bankrupt. She also wrote the screenplays Hibiscus Tears and Her New Life, but they were never made into films. Pu's film career ended when China Sun was acquired by the Lianhua Film Company in 1930. She was labeled as a May Fourth playwright since she was heavily influenced by the movement. In the late 1930s, she became a lawyer based in Tianjin and had her own legal advice column in the newspaper Shen Bao. After World War II she ran for congress but did not win.  Personal life  She married her schoolmate, director Hou Yao in 1926. Hou later moved to Hong Kong and became de facto married to his assistant scriptwriter Wan Hoi-ling, but probably never formally divorced Pu.

History Apohtin's roots are traced during the Byzantine period as various texts refer to the preparation of meat (goat meat, beef, pork etc.) that was salted and then dried in the sun. Preparation In order to prepare apohtin, the animal is opened in the middle. Its head, intestines and tallow are removed. Then the meat is washed, salted and left (in a state to protect it from threats able to harm its quality, such as insects), to the sun for a period of three to four weeks in order to get dry. After that period, meat is sliced into small pieces, washed again and becomes available for any type of cooking. In Cyprus apohtin is a common meze that is served with alcoholic beverages (wine, zivania etc.). A food similar to apohtin is noted in Santorini under the same name. That kind of apohti refers to a food based in pork tenderloin that is salted and dried in the sun. Also, the preparation of tsamarella, another Cypriot dish, is similar to apohtin's preparation except from the fact that unlike apohtin, in tsamarella, animal's bones are removed from the beginning.

The event took place on February 11, 2016, in Osaka, Osaka, at the Edion Arena Osaka. The event featured nine matches, four of which were contested for championships. In the main event, Kazuchika Okada defended the IWGP Heavyweight Championship against Hirooki Goto. In addition to airing worldwide through NJPW's internet streaming site, NJPW World, the event also aired in Japan as a PPV through SKY PerfecTV!. The New Beginning in Osaka was the ninth event under the New Beginning name and the third under the New Beginning in Osaka name. Storylines The New Beginning in Osaka featured nine professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. The first matches for The New Beginning in Osaka were announced on January 12, 2016. The event would be main evented by Kazuchika Okada making his third defense of the IWGP Heavyweight Championship against challenger Hirooki Goto. The match stemmed from the previous August's G1 Climax tournament, where Goto defeated Okada at the same arena in Osaka. Following the win, Goto, then the IWGP Intercontinental Champion, began petitioning for a championship unification match with Okada, but the match never came to fruition. Following Wrestle Kingdom 10 in Tokyo Dome on January 4, 2016, where Okada successfully defended the IWGP Heavyweight Championship against Hiroshi Tanahashi, Goto challenged him to a title match, which led to Okada ridiculing him for his numerous unsuccessful attempts at winning the title. On January 6, Goto attacked Okada at a press conference, setting up a title match between the two for The New Beginning in Osaka. Goto continued attacking Okada during each day of the tour leading to The New Beginning in Osaka, drawing boos from NJPW crowds. He also stated that upon becoming the IWGP Heavyweight Champion, he would not accept a title challenge from Okada unless he first won the IWGP Intercontinental Championship. Goto entered the match with a seven-match losing streak in IWGP Heavyweight Championship matches, having lost all of his attempts at winning the title ever since his first challenge in November 2007. Katsuyori Shibata, who was set to make his first defense of the NEVER Openweight Championship at The New Beginning in Osaka The New Beginning in Osaka would also feature two rematches from Wrestle Kingdom 10 in Tokyo Dome contested for the NEVER championships. Katsuyori Shibata, who won his first singles title at the event, was set to make his first defense of the NEVER Openweight Championship in a rematch with Tomohiro Ishii. Meanwhile, the inaugural NEVER Openweight 6-Man Tag Team Champions Toru Yano and the Ring of Honor (ROH) tag team of Jay Briscoe and Mark Briscoe were scheduled to defend their newly won title in a rematch with the Bullet Club trio of Bad Luck Fale, Tama Tonga and Yujiro Takahashi. The event would also feature new IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Champions The Young Bucks (Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson) defending their title in a three-way match against Matt Sydal and Ricochet and reDRagon (Bobby Fish and Kyle O'Reilly). The Young Bucks won the title at Wrestle Kingdom 10 in Tokyo Dome in a four-way match, which, in addition to these three teams, also included Roppongi Vice (Beretta and Rocky Romero). reDRagon entered the match as the defending champions, but lost the title due to The Young Bucks pinning Romero for the win. The rest of the matches were announced on February 1. Included were several matches building up to matches taking place three days later at The New Beginning in Niigata. In the semi-main event of the show, Hiroshi Tanahashi was set to team up with IWGP Tag Team Champions G.B.H. (Togi Makabe and Tomoaki Honma) to take on the Bullet Club trio of Doc Gallows, Karl Anderson and Kenny Omega, which built up an IWGP Intercontinental Championship match between Tanahashi and Omega and an IWGP Tag Team Championship match between G.B.H. and Gallows and Anderson. Another six-man tag team match between Los Ingobernables de Japon (Bushi, Evil and Tetsuya Naito) and the trio of Juice Robinson, Kushida and Michael Elgin built to an IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship match between challenger Bushi and champion Kushida. Event Hirooki Goto in his new look at The New Beginning in Osaka, prior to making his eighth unsuccessful attempt at winning the IWGP Heavyweight Championship In the first title match of the show, Jay Briscoe, Mark Briscoe and Toru Yano defended the NEVER Openweight 6-Man Tag Team Championship against Bullet Club's Bad Luck Fale, Tama Tonga and Yujiro Takahashi. Towards the end of the match, Yano gave Fale and Takahashi the 634, a double low blow, but then walked into a low blow from Tonga, who then hit him with his finishing move, the Veleno, to win the match and make Bullet Club the new champions. After the match, Yano requested a rematch for The New Beginning in Niigata. In the second title match, Matt Sydal and Ricochet defeated The Young Bucks and reDRagon to become the new IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Champions. In the next match, Katsuyori Shibata defeated Tomohiro Ishii in a rematch from Wrestle Kingdom 10 in Tokyo Dome to retain the NEVER Openweight Championship. In the semi-main event, Bullet Club's Doc Gallows, Karl Anderson and Kenny Omega defeated Hiroshi Tanahashi, Togi Makabe and Tomoaki Honma with Omega pinning Honma for the win. After the match, Bullet Club continued attacking Tanahashi's right shoulder, which he had legitimately dislocated only weeks earlier, setting up the IWGP Intercontinental Championship match between him and Omega. The main event saw Kazuchika Okada defend the IWGP Heavyweight Championship against Hirooki Goto. Goto entered the match covered in white body paint, but was defeated after being hit with three Rainmakers by the defending champion. In a post-match interview, Okada praised Goto and offered him a spot in the Chaos stable. With the loss, Goto set a new record for failing to win the IWGP Heavyweight Championship in eight consecutive title shots. Reception Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter called the show \\"good\\", but \\"far from the caliber of most big shows in recent years\\", adding that it \\"felt empty\\" without A.J. Styles and Shinsuke Nakamura. He called the main event a \\"disappointment\\", writing \\"fans just weren't that into Okada's IWGP title defense against Hirooki Goto, who needed badly to step up and didn't\\". He gave the match three and a half stars out of five, while awarding the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship match four stars and the NEVER Openweight Championship match four and a half stars, the highest rating of the show. Overall, Meltzer stated that the show made NJPW look like a \\"once super-hot promotion past its peak in the midst of a slow decline\\". Aftermath Throughout the tour following The New Beginning in Osaka, Okada kept making invitations for Goto to join Chaos, but was repeatedly turned down. However, when Okada saved Goto from Tetsuya Naito on March 12, he finally accepted the invitation, becoming the newest member of Chaos.

The event took place on February 14, 2016, in Nagaoka, Niigata, at the Aore Nagaoka. The event featured nine matches, four of which were contested for championships. In the main event, Hiroshi Tanahashi took on Kenny Omega to determine the new IWGP Intercontinental Champion, following previous champion Shinsuke Nakamura's departure from NJPW. The New Beginning in Niigata was the tenth event under the New Beginning name and the first to take place in Niigata. Production Storylines The New Beginning in Niigata featured nine professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. The first matches for The New Beginning in Niigata were announced on January 12, 2016. The event would be main evented by a match for the vacant IWGP Intercontinental Championship. On January 4, 2016, at Wrestle Kingdom 10 in Tokyo Dome, Shinsuke Nakamura successfully defended the title against Bullet Club member A.J. Styles. However, only hours later it was reported that Nakamura, along with Styles, Doc Gallows and Karl Anderson, had given his notice to NJPW and would be leaving the promotion to join the WWE. The following day, Nakamura was pinned in a tag team match by another Bullet Club member, Kenny Omega. Afterwards, the rest of Bullet Club turned on Styles with Omega taking over the leadership of the stable, while also stating that he was moving from the junior heavyweight division to the heavyweight division and challenging Nakamura for the IWGP Intercontinental Championship. On January 6, Nakamura confirmed he was leaving NJPW at the end of January, which led to NJPW announcing they were stripping him of the IWGP Intercontinental Championship and that at The New Beginning in Niigata Omega would face a mystery opponent to determine the new champion. On January 30, Omega confronted Nakamura following his final NJPW match, claiming that he was afraid to face him, which led to Hiroshi Tanahashi appearing and announcing that he was going to be Omega's opponent at The New Beginning in Niigata. NJPW formally announced the match between Omega and Tanahashi two days later. In the week leading up to the announcement, it was reported that Tanahashi had dislocated his shoulder on January 24, but would continue to work through the injury. The legitimate injury led to an angle at The New Beginning in Osaka on February 11, where Omega led a Bullet Club assault on Tanahashi's shoulder. The New Beginning in Niigata would also feature a rematch from Wrestle Kingdom 10 in Tokyo Dome, where G.B.H. (Togi Makabe and Tomoaki Honma) were set to defend their newly won IWGP Tag Team Championship against previous champions, Bullet Club representatives Doc Gallows and Karl Anderson. Gallows and Anderson worked the event as free agents, with Anderson's NJPW contract having expired at the end of January 2016. Though Anderson publicly denied he was leaving the promotion, The New Beginning in Niigata was expected to be one of his and Gallows' last NJPW appearances before leaving for WWE. Also on the card, Kushida was set to defend the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship against Bushi. This match stemmed from events taking place at a show the day after Wrestle Kingdom 10 in Tokyo Dome, where Bushi attacked Kushida and challenged him to a title match. The rest of the matches were announced on February 1. Among the matches added was a six-man tag team match, where the Chaos stable's Kazuchika Okada, Tomohiro Ishii and Yoshi-Hashi were set to take on Hirooki Goto, Juice Robinson and Katsuyori Shibata, coming off The New Beginning in Osaka, where Goto unsuccessfully challenged Okada for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship, while Ishii unsuccessfully challenged Shibata for the NEVER Openweight Championship. NJPW promoted the match as an opportunity for Chaos to demonstrate their cohesion in the wake of the stable's leader Shinsuke Nakamura's departure from the promotion. On February 12, the day after The New Beginning in Osaka, where Bullet Club's Bad Luck Fale, Tama Tonga and Yujiro Takahashi defeated Chaos' Jay Briscoe, Mark Briscoe and Toru Yano to become the new NEVER Openweight 6-Man Tag Team Champions, NJPW announced that the previously scheduled non-title match between the two teams in Niigata, would now be contested for the title. Event Kenny Omega, who captured the IWGP Intercontinental Championship in the main event The first title match of the show saw Bullet Club's Bad Luck Fale, Tama Tonga and Yujiro Takahashi defend their newly won NEVER Openweight 6-Man Tag Team Championship against Jay Briscoe, Mark Briscoe and Toru Yano. In the finish of the match, after the Briscoes had pulled Fale and Tonga out of the ring, Takahashi attempted to low blow Yano like he had done when Bullet Club won the title at The New Beginning in Osaka, but was stopped by the referee of the match. Yano then used the distraction to low blow Takahashi and then pinned him with the Urakasumi to regain the title. The following match saw Chaos' Kazuchika Okada, Tomohiro Ishii and Yoshi-Hashi defeat Hirooki Goto, Juice Robinson and Katsuyori Shibata with Okada pinning Robinson for the win. After the match, Okada repeated his offer from The New Beginning in Osaka by offering Goto a spot in Chaos. Goto, however, walked off without answering. The second title match of the show saw Kushida defend the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship against Bushi. The match featured repeated outside interference from Bushi's Los Ingobernables de Japon stablemates Evil and Tetsuya Naito, before they were eventually stopped by Jay White and Ryusuke Taguchi, allowing Kushida to submit Bushi to win the match and retain the title. In the eighth match of the show, Togi Makabe and Tomoaki Honma successfully defended the IWGP Tag Team Championship against Bullet Club's Doc Gallows and Karl Anderson. After the match, Tama Tonga entered the ring and challenged Makabe and Honma to a title match, stating that his partner would be a new Bullet Club member. The challenge was accepted by the champions. Meanwhile, Anderson and Gallows bowed to the crowd ahead of their impending departure from NJPW. In the main event of the show, Hiroshi Tanahashi took on Kenny Omega for the vacant IWGP Intercontinental Championship. Early in the match, Omega sent his Bullet Club stablemates Cody Hall and Yujiro Takahashi away from ringside, stating that he wanted a clean win. However, when Tanahashi had the match won, Hall came back out and distracted the referee of the match as The Young Bucks (Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson) entered the ring and attacked Tanahashi. Eventually, Michael Elgin came out, attacked The Young Bucks and carried them backstage. In the ring, Omega avoided Tanahashi's finishing maneuver, the High Fly Flow, hit him with the V-Trigger, his version of Shinsuke Nakamura's Bomaye finisher, and then pinned him with the Katayoku no Tenshi to win the match and become the new IWGP Intercontinental Champion. Reception The Wrestling Observer Newsletter praised the main event as a \\"masterpiece\\" in terms of storytelling and accomplishing the goal of making Omega a \\"superstar\\" without hurting Tanahashi as he was \\"more important than ever\\" following the departures of A.J. Styles and Shinsuke Nakamura. The publication's editor Dave Meltzer later added the main event to a list of eight matches over the past 35 years that he felt \\"made a new superstar instantaneously at a time when one was needed\\". He gave the match four and three quarter stars out of five, while also praising the IWGP Junior Heavyweight and Tag Team Championship matches, giving them four and a quarter stars and four stars, respectively.

The film was released on 11 December 2015 at the Dehradun Film Festival, to coincide with World Deaf Day, and has been billed as the \\"first commercial movie based on deaf children and enacted by real life deaf kids\\". It follows the adventures of thirteen deaf children and their perilous journey across the mountainous terrains of Uttarakhand. The film is supported by National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and Disaster Management and Mitigation Centre (DMMC).  Synopsis  The film follows a group of disabled children who set out to conquer the Himalayan mountains with their teacher. The children believe that through mountaineering, they can conquer not just their fears, but their disabilities as well. They are determined to prove that although they may be challenged, they are not disabled. However their trek leader doesn't believe this, as she believes them to be as capable or equal as hearing children, and actively tries to discourage them from continuing on throughout the course of the trek. When the leader is wounded and unable to proceed any further, the children fear that this will mean the end of their trip and their dreams of scaling the peaks and proving their worth to the world. Eventually, the children show tremendous mettle and skills in spite of the odds they face.  Production  Filming took place in extreme surroundings and harsh conditions, and temperatures dropped as low as ‚àí12 ¬∞C. Despite safety precautions, the roads leading to the filming locations were blocked and the children's commute sequences were filmed in challenging conditions. The rafting sequence over the river Ganga was one of the most difficult tasks, as the water was at freezing temperature.

The programme was launched in 2006. Currently 125 tehsils/blocks from 23 districts come under this mission. The initiative focuses mainly on the health, income generation and education of populations in rural areas. Village students do not usually have appropriate facilities to study in the villages; the initiative provides free study rooms for village students. After observing that village girls abandon their educations midway because of the lengthy distance between high schools and villages, the state government also started providing free bus services to transport village girls from their native villages to high schools. Organisation and selection The mission was established in 2006 in 25 talukas (\\"blocks\\") of 12 districts. In the 2010 budget it was decided to implement this mission at block level rather than at district level. In 2011, the number of blocks was further increased to 125 from 22 districts, based upon the 2001 census. Blocks were selected on the basis of two parameters; the percentage of female literacy in the block and the percentage of families living below the poverty line in the block on the basis of a 2002 survey. 125 blocks were selected from a tentative list of 175 blocks. Aspects Health The health aspect mainly focuses on mother and child health (MCH). It also has provisions for maintenance work on government hospital buildings in villages. Pregnant women are motivated to deliver their babies in hospitals rather than in their homes. Rural women usually work on farms until the ninth month of their pregnancies; in this scheme government provides to women who deliver in hospital as \\"lost wages\\"‚Äîthe income that a woman loses because of her stay in hospital during pregnancy. Education The educational aspect includes the creation of study centres for village students, free bus services for girls, installing solar-powered lighting in village schools and providing books. The scheme also provides for the creation of Balbhavan at the block level. Study rooms are made available mainly for students from 8th standard to 12th standard. Students whose educational standards are low are especially invited to the centres and more focus is given to them by teachers. Income generation Under the scheme, modern agriculture instruments are made available to farmers. Effects According to analysts, free bus services for village girls have been effective in reducing dropout rates of female students. Provision of the \\"lost wages\\" has increased the rate of hospital deliveries, which have reduced the local maternal mortality rate and infant mortality rate. However, many study centres exists only \\"on paper\\" because of bureaucracy. Officials of the education department also seem to ignore the inspection of such study centres. The state government has reduced the scheme's budget in 2015. The Human Development Index (HDI) has not improved much from 2001 to 2011. There is also only a slight improvement in per capita incomes.

Life Palthen was born in Wolgast, a port in what was then Swedish Pomerania. His father was Johann Palthen, a senior official at the court, and his mother, born Dorothea Hoppe, also came from one of the town's leading families. The boy attended the Gymnasium (school) in Greifswald, moving on to Greifswald University where he studied between 1688 and 1691. He was able to attract influential patrons from early on in his career, and after his graduation he obtained a post with Johann Friedrich Mayer, as a tutor and librarian, based in Hamburg.F. L. Hoffmann: Hamburgische Bibliophilen, Bibliographen und Litteraturhistorisker. In: Robert Naumann: Serapeum. T.O. Weigel, Leipzig 1865, p. 226. Palthen was also able to accompany Mayer during an extensive tour that took in the Netherlands, Denmark and the Swedish mainland. Another patron was Samuel von Pufendorf whose wife was related to the Palthens. It was through the intervention of von Putendorf that in 1694 Nils Bielke, the Swedish governor general, appointed Johann Philipp Palthen, still aged only 22, as Professor of Mathematics and Morality at the University of Greifswald. More travel came in 1697 and 1698 when Palthen accompanied Bielke's sons on a visit to France and England. In Paris he studied the works of Jean Mabillon, √âtienne Baluze, Jean Hardouin, Louis Du Four and Pierre Daniel Huet, and was able to meet some of these. It seems likely that it was Du Four that stimulated his interest in Tatian which he was then able to pursue further in Oxford. Palthen returned to Greifswald in 1699, taking a professorship in History. He had been in regular correspondence with his patron Johann Friedrich Mayer since 1694, and in 1701 Mayer was appointed General Superintendent for Swedish Pomerania and full professor in Theology at Greifswald, after which Palthen was able to use the Theology faculty's extensive library for his studies. Together with Mayer he set about organising the launch of a new \\"Learned Society in 1704\\", but the project came to nothing due to factionalism at the university between advocates of Pietism and adherents of Lutheran orthodoxy. In 1708 Johann Philipp Palthen served as Rector of the university. During his stay at Oxford, in 1698, Palthen got hold of a copy of Tatian's Gospel harmony, based on a manuscript of an Old High German translation attributed to Franciscus Junius. He managed to obtain financial backing from (effectively the Swedish viceroy in Swedish Pommerania) to have the work printed at Greifswald in 1706. As well as his lectures, Palthen devoted his scholarly endeavours at Greifswald to German history, Natural and State Law and the work of Hugo Grotius. He also devoted time and meticulous care to the collection and archiving of numerous \\"Res Gestae\\" and other source documents which, because of his work three centuries ago, survive today in archival collections in Greifswald, Stralsund and Putbus.

He devised one of the early procedures to address retinal detachment, and he received the Gonin Medal from the International Council of Ophthalmology in 1950. Biography Arruga was the second of three generations of eye surgeons. He and his father, ophthalmologist Eduardo Arruga, had both been born in Barcelona. He entered medical studies at 16 and graduated in 1908, leaving Spain for a while for further study in France and Germany. His mentors included Edmund Landolt, Julius Hirschberg and F√©lix de Lapersonne. He returned to Barcelona, spending the rest of his life seeing patients there, with the exception of a move to South America during the Spanish Civil War. Arruga lived right above his clinic in Barcelona, where patients and physicians from all over the world came to see him. One of the first surgeons to promote intracapsular cataract extraction, Arruga also suggested technical improvements to several other eye surgeries. Arruga introduced a procedure for treating retinal detachment that became known as Arruga's suture. In this surgery, a band was made around the sclera using Supramid, a synthetic suture material, but the technique caused some problems with scleral erosion. Even after the procedure could be performed with silicone bands, there were still problems with ischemia of the anterior segment of the eye, and the procedure was replaced by newer techniques. Arruga was close friends with Jules Gonin, the Swiss ophthalmologist who devised the first retinal detachment repair surgery. Arruga wrote two influential books, Retinal Detachment (1936) and Ocular Surgery (1946); for the latter, his son, ophthalmologist Alfredo Arruga- Forgas, wrote a chapter of the third English edition (1962). In 1950, Arruga won the Gonin Medal. He was recognized with the Order of Isabella the Catholic in 1956. He received honorary doctorates from the University of Barcelona and Heidelberg University.¬´El conde de Arruga, doctor \\"honoris causa\\" por Heidelberg¬ª. La Vanguardia (in Spanish).

He was also made a count by the Spanish government. Arruga enjoyed chess and was a skilled artist. He engaged in mountain climbing, reaching the summit of the Jungfrau in the Bernese Alps when he was 70 years old. He died of heart disease in 1972.

The BFV was founded in 1923 and has its headquarters in Eisenstadt. The BFV is one of 8 regional organizations of the Austrian Football Association (, √ñFB). History of the BFV The BFV was founded 1923 un Eisenstadt. The founding members were the football clubs of Eisenstadt, Deutschkreutz, Mattersburg, Neufeld an der Leitha and Parndorf. The first General Assembly was held on 22 March 1924 in Wiener Neustadt. 20 football clubs participated in the meeting. On 29 March 1924, the association‚Äôs first board was established with Josef Cekal as its first president. For the first football championship in 1924 three groups were established: * Parndorf District with 9 clubs SC Parndorf, SC Sturm Neusiedl, Garnison SC Neusiedl, SC M√∂nchhof, SC Halbturn, SC Frauenkirchen, SC Nickelsdorf, SC Kittsee and SC Bruckneudorf * Eisenstadt District with 12 clubs SC Freiheit Eisenstadt, SC Hakoah Eisenstadt, SC Sonnenberg Hornstein, SC Neufeld, SC Loretto, SC Gro√üh√∂flein, SC Siegendorf, SC Zillingtal-Wacker, SC Neud√∂rfl, SV Mattersdorf, SV Wiesen and SC Sauerbrunn * Oberwart District with 9 clubs SC Oberwart, SC Obersch√ºtzen, SC Mariasdorf, SC Bernstein, SC Rotenturm, SC Gro√üpetersdorf, SC Pinkafeld, SC Rechnitz and SC G√ºssing In Burgenland also existed a regional group of the VAF√ñ (the workers union of the football clubs in Austria), starting in 1926. In 1934 the VAF√ñ was disbanded and the BFV divided into North District and South District. The larger district, the North District, was disbanded on 24 May 1936. The smaller district, the South District, was disbanded in 1938 and joined the Empire Sports Association. The restoration of 1945 The BFV was newly founded in the fall of 1945. In October 1945, a provisional state committee was set up, at the Caf√© Ostmark in Eisenstadt, with Otto Willomitzer as chairman. The first office of the BFV was in Eisenstadt, in the Pfarrgasse 8. In 1960 the BFV moved into a larger building in the Haydngasse. In 1989 the BFV moved into the newly built headquarters in Hotterweg. BFV-Cup The Burgenland Football Association also organizes a Cup competition. The BFV Cup bears currently the name Raiffeisen-Cup, named after the sponsor. The cup winner receives a fixed starting place in the 1st round of the √ñFB Cup. The BFV Cup was introduced in 1995, before this time there were Cup competitions in Burgenland in 1946-1949 and 1974-1977, which no longer take place. Format The BFV-Cup is held in K.O. system, were all rounds are decided in one game. In the 1st round, the lower ranked team has home field advantage. If there is a draw after 90 minutes of play, the winner will be determined immediately (without overtime) through shoot outs. The first 4 Cup rounds take place within a group (North, Central, South A, South B). Semifinals and finals within each group are held on one tournament day. The venue is either drawn or awarded on the basis of applications. The 4 group winners then take part in the national final round. Which is held in a tournament fashion on one day, with the three groups (North, Central, South) alternating as promoters. The venue is the respective home of the group winner of each group (in the south, South A and South B alternate). * 1st round: 64 participants (16 teams per group) * 2ndround: 32 participants (8 first-round winners in each group) * 3rd round: 16 participants (4 second-round winners per group); Group Semifinals * 4th round: 8 participants (2 semi-final winners in each group); Group Finals * 5th round: 4 participants (4 group winners); Semifinal * 6th round: 2 participants (2 semifinal winners); Final Qualification Open to all clubs of the BFV, who have no chance to qualify in the current Cup season in the championship for the √ñFB Cup, meaning all teams below the Burgenland League. Therefore, the champion of the 2. Leagues are not qualified for the BFV Cup. The qualification is based on the previous seasons' championship final placement.

It ravaged the Mexican highlands in epidemic proportions. The disease became known as Cocoliztli by the native Aztecs, and had devastating effects on the area‚Äôs demography, particularly for the indigenous people. Based on the death toll, this outbreak is often referred to as the worst disease epidemic in the history of Mexico. Subsequent outbreaks continued to baffle both Spanish and native doctors, with little consensus among modern researchers on the pathogenesis. However, recent bacterial genomic studies have suggested that Salmonella, specifically a serotype of Salmonella enterica known as Paratyphi C, was at least partially responsible for this initial outbreak. It might have also been an indigenous viral hemorrhagic fever, perhaps exacerbated by the worst droughts to affect that region in 500 years, as well as living conditions for indigenous peoples of Mexico in the wake of the Spanish conquest (c. 1519). Etymology The word cocoliztli originated from the Nahuatl word for \\"pest\\", or disease, illness, and plague. History Collapse of population in Mexico during the 16th century, attributed at least in part to repeated cocoliztli epidemics. There have been 12 epidemics that have been identified as potentially being of cocoliztli, with the largest ones being those in 1520, 1545, 1576, 1736, and 1813. Soto et al. have hypothesized that a large scale outbreak of hemorrhagic fever could also have contributed to the earlier collapse of the Classic Mayan civilization (AD 750‚Äì950), though most experts believe other factors including climate change likely played a much larger role. Cocoliztli epidemics usually occurred within two years of a major drought, while another disease called \\"matlazahuatl\\" appeared within two years of the rainy season. The epidemic in 1576 occurred after a drought stretching from Venezuela to Canada. The correlation between drought and the disease has been thought to be that population numbers of the vesper mouse, a carrier of viral hemorrhagic fever, increased during the rains that followed the drought, as conditions improved. There exists some ambiguity regarding if cocoliztli preferentially targeted native people, as opposed to European colonists. The majority of firsthand accounts regarding the outbreak come from Aztec informants, who were primarily concerned with the diseases‚Äô novelty and pronounced symptoms. Spanish colonizers may have used indigenous fears to further justify and enforce Christianity, as expressed by the following statement from Gonzalo de Ortiz (an encomendero): \\"envi√≥ Dios tal enfermedad sobre ellos que de quarto partes de indios que avia se llev√≥ las tres\\" (God sent down such sickness upon the Indians that three out of every four of them perished). It is unclear if Ortiz was exaggerating, or if the Spanish colonizers were truly less affected by this \\"act of God\\". Accounts by Toribio de Benavente Motolinia, an early Spanish missionary, seem to contradict Ortiz‚Äôs sentiment by suggesting that 60‚Äì90% of New Spain's total population decreased, regardless of ethnicity. Bernardino de Sahag√∫n, another Spanish clergyman and author of the Florentine Codex, attested to contracting the disease himself towards the end of the outbreak. During a second cocoliztli outbreak in 1576, Sahag√∫n identified both African slaves and Spanish colonists as being susceptible to the disease. Sources and vectors The social and physical environment of Colonial Mexico was likely key in allowing the Outbreak of 1545‚Äì1548 to reach the heights that it did. Already weakened by war and earlier disease outbreaks, the Aztecs were forced into easily governable reducciones (congregations) that focused on agricultural production and conversion to Christianity. The reducciones would have not only brought people in much closer contact to one another, but with animals, as well. Whether it is rats, chickens, pigs, or cattle, animals imported from the Old World were potentially disease vectors for illnesses of New and Old World origins. At the same time, droughts plagued Central America, with tree-ring data showing that the outbreak occurred in the midst of a megadrought. The lack of water would have altered sanitary conditions and encouraged poor hygiene habits. Megadroughts were reported before both the 1545 and 1576 outbreaks. Additionally, periodic rains during a supposed megadrought, such as those hypothesized for shortly before 1545, would have increased the presence of New World rats and mice. These animals are believed to have also been able to transport the arenaviruses capable of causing hemorrhagic fevers. The effects of drought, combined with the now crowded settlements, is a highly plausible explanation for disease transmission, especially if the pathogens are spread by either human fecal matter or animals. As alluded to above, the Aztecs and other indigenous groups affected by the outbreak were potentially put at a disadvantage given their lack of exposure to zoonotic diseases. Given that many of the Old World pathogens being considered as responsible for the cocoliztli outbreak, it is significant that all but one of the most common species of domestic mammalian livestock (llamas/alpacas being the exception) come from the Old World. Extent Scholars suspect it began in the southern and central Mexico Highlands, near modern-day Puebla City. Shortly after its initial onset, however, it may have spread as far north as Sinaloa, and as south as Chiapas and Guatemala, where it was called gucumatz. It may have even crossed the South American border, and into Ecuador and Peru, although it is hard to be certain that the same disease was described. The outbreak seemed to be limited to higher elevation, as it was nearly absent from coastal regions at sea level, e.g. the plains along the Gulf of Mexico and Pacific coast. Symptoms Although symptomatic descriptions of cocoliztli are similar to those of Old World diseases (e.g. measles, yellow fever, typhus), many researchers believe that it should be recognized as a separate disease. According to Francisco Hern√°ndez de Toledo, a physician who witnessed the outbreak in 1576, symptoms included high fever, severe headache, vertigo, black tongue, dark urine, dysentery, severe abdominal and chest pain, head and neck nodules, neurologic disorders, jaundice, and profuse bleeding from the nose, eyes, and mouth; death frequently occurred within 3 to 4 days. Some also describe the afflicted during this period as having spotted skin and gastrointestinal hemorrhaging, leading to bloody diarrhea, as well as bleeding from the eyes, mouth, and vagina. The onset was often rapid, and without any precursors that would suggest one was sick. The disease was characterized by an extremely high level of virulence, with death often occurring within a week of one becoming symptomatic. Due to the virulence and effectiveness of the disease, recognizing its existence in the archaeological record has been difficult. Cocoliztli, and other diseases that work rapidly, usually do not leave impacts (lesions) on the deceased‚Äôs bones, despite causing significant damage to the gastrointestinal, respiratory, and other bodily systems. Causes Numerous 16th century accounts detail the outbreak‚Äôs devastation, but the symptoms do not match any known pathogen. Shortly after 1548, the Spanish started calling the disease tabardillo (typhus), which had only been recognized in Spain since the late 15th century. However, the symptoms of cocoliztli were still not identical to the typhus, or spotted fever, observed in the Old World at that time. Perhaps, this is why Francisco Hern√°ndez de Toledo, a Spanish physician, insisted on using the Nahuatl word when describing the disease to correspondents in the Old World. Centuries later, in 1970, a historian named Germain Somolinos d'Ardois took a systematic look at all the proposed explanations at the time, including haemorrhagic influenza, leptospirosis, malaria, typhus, typhoid and yellow fever. According to Somolinos d'Ardois, none of these quite matched the 16th century accounts of cocoliztli, leading him to conclude the disease was a result of \\"viral process of hemorrhagic influence.\\" In other words, Somolinos d'Ardois believed cocoliztli was not the result of any known Old World pathogen, but possibly, a virus of either European or New World origins. It has been speculated that it might have been an indigenous viral hemorrhagic fever as there are accounts of similar diseases having struck Mexico in Precolumbian times. The Codex Chimalpopoca states that an outbreak of bloody diarrhea occurred in Colhuacan in 1320.John Bierhorst, History and Mythology of the Aztecs: The Codex Chimalpopoca pg 66. If the disease was indigenous, it was perhaps exacerbated by the worst droughts to affect that region in 500 years and living conditions for indigenous peoples of Mexico in the wake of Spanish conquest (c. 1519). Some historians have suggested it was typhus, measles, or smallpox, though the symptoms did not match. Marr and Kiracofe (2000) attempted to build off this work by reexamining Hernandez‚Äôs account of cocoliztli and comparing them with various clinical descriptions of other diseases. They suggested that scholars consider \\"New World arenaviruses\\" and the role these pathogens may have played in colonial disease outbreaks. Rebelling against the universal acceptance of Post-Contact epidemics being \\"Old-World importations,\\" Marr and Kiracofe theorized that arenaviruses, which mainly affect rodents, were largely kept away from Pre-Columbian people. Consequently, rat and mice infestations brought upon by the arrival of the Spanish may, combined with climatic and landscape change, have brought these arenaviruses into much closer contact with people Subsequent studies seemed to have accepted the viral haemorrhagic fever diagnosis, and became more interested in assessing how the disease became so widespread. In 2018, Johannes Krause, an evolutionary geneticist at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History, and colleagues discovered new evidence for an Old World culprit. DNA samples from the teeth of 29 sixteenth-century skeletons in the Oaxaca region of Mexico were identified as belonging to a rare strain of the bacterium Salmonella enterica (subsp. enterica) which causes paratyphoid fever, suggesting that paratyphoid was the underlying fever behind the disease. The team extracted ancient DNA from the teeth of 29 individuals buried at Teposcolula-Yucundaa in Oaxaca, Mexico. The Contact-era site has the only cemetery to be conclusively linked to victims of the Cocoliztli Outbreak of 1545‚Äì1548. Using the MEGAN alignment tool (MALT), a program that attempts to match fragments of extracted DNA with a database of bacterial genomes, the researchers were able to recognize nonlocal microbial infections. Within 10 individuals, they identified Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Paratyphi C, which causes enteric fevers in humans. This strain of Salmonella is unique to humans, and was not found in any soil samples or pre-Contact individuals that were used as controls. Enteric fevers, also known as typhoid or paratyphoid, are similar to typhus, and were only distinguished from one another in the 19th century. Today, S. Paratyphi C continues to cause enteric fevers, and if untreated, has a mortality rate up to 15%. Infections are largely limited to developing nations in Africa and Asia, although enteric fevers, in general, are still a health threat world wide. Infections with S. Paratyphi C are rare, as the majority of cases reported (about 27 million in 2000) were the result of the serovars S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A. These findings are boosted by the recent discovery of S. Paratyphi C within a 13th century Norwegian cemetery. A young female, who likely died from an enteric fever, is proof that the pathogen was present in Europe over 300 years before the epidemics in Mexico. Thus, it is possible that healthy carriers transported the bacteria to the New World, where it thrived. Those who unknowingly possessed the bacteria were likely aided from generations of contact with it, as it is believed that S. Paratyphi C may have first transferred over to humans from swine in the Old World during, or, shortly after the Neolithic period. Some, including evolutionary geneticist, Mar√≠a √Åvila-Arcos, have questioned this evidence, since S. enterica symptoms are poorly matched with the disease. Both √Åvila-Arcos, and even Krause‚Äôs team and authors of earlier historical analyses, point out that RNA viruses, among other non-bacterial pathogens, had not been investigated. Others have highlighted the fact that certain symptoms described, including gastrointestinal hemorrhaging, are not present in current observations of S. Paratyphi C infections. Ultimately, a more definitive proposal for the cause of the of any of the cocoliztli epidemics of 1545‚Äì1548 and 1576-81 awaits further developments in ancient RNA analysis and the causes of different outbreaks may prove to differ. Effects Death toll Beyond the estimations done by Motolinia and others for New Spain, most of the death toll figures cited for the outbreak of 1545‚Äì1548 are concerned with Aztec populations. Around 800,000 died in the Valley of Mexico, which led to the widespread abandonment of many indigenous sites in the area during, or, shortly after this four-year period. Estimates for the entire number of human lives lost during this epidemic have ranged from 5 to 15 million people, making it one of the most deadly disease outbreaks of all time. Other The effects of the outbreak extended beyond just a loss in terms of population. The lack of indigenous labor led to a sizeable food shortage, which affected both the natives and Spanish. The death of many Aztecs at the hands of the plague led to a void in land ownership, with Spanish colonists of all backgrounds looking to exploit these now vacant lands. Coincidentally, the Spanish Emperor, Charles V, had been seeking a way to disempower the encomendero class, and establish a more efficient and \\"ethical\\" settlement system. Starting around the end of the outbreak in 1549, the encomederos, crippled by the loss in profits resulting and unable to meet the demands of New Spain, were forced to comply with the new tasaciones (regulations). The new ordinances, known as Leyes Nuevas aimed to limit the amount of tribute encomenderos could personally extract, while also prohibiting them from exercising absolute control over the labor force. Simultaneously, non- encomenderos began claiming lands lost by the encomenderos, as well as, the labor provided by the indigenous. This developed in to the implementation of the repartimiento system, which sought to institute a higher level of oversight within the Spanish colonies and maximize the overall tribute extracted for public and crown use. Rules regarding tribute itself were also changed in response to the epidemic of 1545, as fears over future food shortages ran rampant among the Spanish. By 1577, after years of debate and a second major outbreak of cocoliztli, maize and money were designated as the only two forms of acceptable tribute. Later outbreaks A second large outbreak of cocoliztli occurred in 1576, lasting until about 1580. Although less destructive (around 2 million deaths) than its predecessor, this outbreak appears in much greater detail in colonial accounts. Many of the descriptions of cocoliztli symptoms, beyond the bleeding, fevers, and jaundice, were recorded during this epidemic. In total, there are 13 cocoliztli epidemics cited in Spanish accounts between 1545 and 1642, with a later outbreak in 1736 taking a similar form, but referred to by a different name (tlazahuatl).

Guru Gobind Singh came there after winning the battle of Bajrur with the Mughals. This battles has also been described in Shri Gur Patap Suraj Granth of Bhai Santokh Singh Choorhamani. The folklore reference according to elders about its nomenclature is that the villagers fought with bravery with foreign invaders, so that the name of the village became a combination of Sir (head) and Tali (palm) which means that these people are fought by taking their head on their palm. By the passing of time it became Sarthali from Sirtali.  Infrastructure  * The village hosts a Primary Health Centre which covers the village Sarthali including some other surrounding villages. * A Cooperative society is to serve the farmers on sharing based agricultural equipment and also provide fertilisers. * A milk union to collect milk for Verka milk plant Mohali and to provide feed and other supplements for cattles. * Two gymnasiums for physical workout and exercise. * A potable drinking water supply system has been installed to provide 70 litre per capita per day potable water in the village. * A community centre for common functions. * An Govt.

The game was developed by Japanese developer Sen, published by Miscreant's Room and released on 10 December 2012. The game centers around an 11-year-old girl named Aya, who breaks into her father's secret laboratory to uncover the horrifying truth of his research. A Steam version, published by AGM Playism, was released on 23 September 2016.  Plot  Mad Father takes place in northern Germany, where the 11-year old protagonist, Aya Drevis, lives with her father, Alfred Drevis, and their maid Maria. Aya is a shy girl who never goes outside. Her mother was incredibly ill, and presumably died of illness before the occurrence of the game. Her father performs secret research in his laboratory in the house's basement, with the assistance of Maria. Aya is aware that Alfred experiments and kills humans in the basement, as well as the fact that he is involved in an extramarital affair with the younger Maria, a former homeless woman he had taken off the street some years prior. On the anniversary of Monika's death, the very beginning of the game, Aya awakens at midnight to find herself surrounded by test subjects that escaped from the laboratory. Fleeing back into her room, Aya encounters the mysterious salesman Ogre, who offers her the task of solving puzzles to break into her father's laboratory and uncover his secret. Aya discovers that her father had intended to perform taxidermy on her and convert her into a doll, as he had done to numerous other children, having been enamored with preserving humans after having killed his own mother as a youth. Aya soon discovers that her father killed her mother in fear of her mother taking Aya away to prevent him from performing taxidermy on her. The game has three endings based on the player's choices. In one ending, Aya allows her undead mother to take her father away to another world. After returning to the real world, she runs into Maria, who knocks her out, takes her to the basement and then kills her, turning her corpse into a doll. In the second ending, Aya saves her father from being taken by her mother's spirit. However, after doing so, Monika reveals to Aya that Alfred murdered her for one of his experiments. Horrified, Aya flees while being chased by a chainsaw- wielding Alfred. While attempting to escape, she runs into Maria. Maria attempts to follow her, but when she fails to capture her, Maria is attacked by Alfred. The game then branches into two endings depending on Aya's actions; if Aya neglects to help Maria and instead attempts to escape the mansion, she is found by her father and killed, with Alfred performing taxidermy on her corpse and rendering her into one of his dolls. In the true ending, Aya helps Maria, declaring that the two shall henceforth live together. Maria then kills Alfred and the two women leave the mansion, which is burned down by Dio, the spirit of one of Alfred's human test subjects. As the house burns down, Ogre transports Alfred's spirit to another world, where he is free to experiment to his heart's content, creating a mature adult clone of his daughter, leading into the events of Misao. Meanwhile, while walking away from the burning mansion, Aya notices that her father's medical book has survived the blaze. Some years later, Aya and Maria have created a clinic, where they perform medical services free of charge. A poor woman named Jean Rooney arrives for an examination, and Aya uses anesthesia to render Jean unconscious, claiming that Jean will no longer suffer from her illnesses. In another room, Maria muses that Aya has become just like her father and that the tendencies run in the family, heavily implying that Aya has followed in her father's footsteps.  Remake  A remake of the game is in development and is slated to release in Q4 2020 for Nintendo Switch.

It is part of the more recent phase of activity of the Altiplano-Puna volcanic complex. Accompanied with little explosive activity on the main dome Cerro Chascon, it contains ten lava domes arranged in a chain. Located in the floor of the Pastos Grandes caldera, these domes were erupted after injection of mafic magmas in the deep less than 100,000 years ago. The largest dome has a volume of .  Geology  The complex is a chain of seven lava domes named Runtu Jarita whose largest member is named Cerro Chascon. This chain is comparable with the Mono-Inyo craters in the United States. Together with other lava domes like Cerro Chao this complex is part of the young surface expression of the APVC and may indicate the future location of a caldera.  Origins  The lava domes are contained within the moat and floor of the Pastos Grandes caldera, but it may not be part of that caldera complex proper. The lava dome complex is part of the Altiplano-Puna volcanic complex, an igneous province located in the Central Andes. During the Late Miocene-Pleistocene, large ignimbrite eruptions took place covering an area of triggered by the formation of melts deep in the crust and their subsequent rise to the upper crust. Geochemical analysis led de Silva (1994) to suggest that they may be the latest eruptive cycle of the APVC, either as part of a reactivation or waning of that system. Pastos Grandes is the source of two major ignimbrites, the 8.1 mya Sifon and the 5.3 mya Chuhuilla ignimbrite, as well as the 3.1 mya Cerro Juvina ignimbrite shield on the northern caldera flank. The eruption of this complex may have been formed by a dyke.  Structure  The volcanic complex extends from to with base altitudes . The complex is split into a northern group encompassing Cerro Chascon and three other domes (named Cerro Guichi, Morro Chascoso and Pabelloncita Loma), and a southern group of six domes. Their orientation in northwestward direction is consistent with the regional trends but may also be influenced by the Pastos Grandes caldera structure. The arid climate of the area has impeded erosion in the area, leaving the volcanic complex relatively unaltered. Cerro Chascon is formed from a cicle of lava flow lobes with a central plug with a diameter of . Explosive activity occurred before the dome formation and generated a thick pumice deposit composed from rhyolitic obsidian beneath the dome. The lava dome has a volume of with a maximum altitude of . Its surface is covered by mounds ( high) of presumably diapiric origin, with sand trails eroded from the mounds separating them. Morro Chascoso and Pabelloncita Loma are cone shaped domes with blocky slopes with talus and central depressions. The much smaller Cerro Guichi ( high and long) may be an exposed intrusion, considering that it lacks any indication of surface flow. The two southernmost domes of the southern group have similar shapes to Chascoso and Pabelloncita. However the second southernmost dome is accompanied with an andesitic lava flow. The rest of the domes contain a silicic core with surrounding andesitic flows. The domes become less andesitic towards the north.  Petrology  The lavas of this complex are of potassium-rich calc-alkaline origin, and are highly viscous with large difference between two magma types. The lava domes are formed from andesite in the south and dacite in the north. The dacites are crystal rich and some lavas show evidence of magma mixing. Phenocryst contents ranges from 35% by volume in dacite and 48% by volume of rhyolite. In the northern group these are primarily composed from feldspar with minor components of amphibole, biotite and quartz. The southern group rocks have similar petrologies, but are of rhyolitic composition and contain mafic components. They contain a rhyolitic core surrounded with andesitic lavas that contains primarily plagioclase phenocrysts. Temperatures of for dacitic lava and for rhyolite lava have been estimated. Petrology indicates that the andesitic lavas of the southern domes are derived from the more silicic magmas by addition of more mafic andeistes. Conversely, the northern dome magmas formed by fractional crystallization with the most evolved components being erupted explosively.  Geologic history  The lava domes were erupted between 89,000-94,000 years ago. In Runtu Jarita, Argon-argon dating on sanidine has yielded ages of 88,000¬±4,000 to 97,000¬±2,000 BP. The eruption may have been caused by the injection of mafic magmas in the magmatic system. Presumably, the magmas were in the process of forming a pluton when the injection of new magmas led to eruption. The eruptions of Chascon initially were phreatomagmatic and influenced by local lakewaters. In the southern domes, some time occurred between the formation of the andesitic magmas by mixing and the eruption. Both andesitic and rhyolitic magmas were simultaneously extruded.

He is best known as husband of Isabelle Rimbaud, and the brother-in-law and publisher of Arthur Rimbaud.  Biography  After attending the lyc√©e in Ch√¢teauroux, Dufour moved to Paris where he studied sculpture and painting, and was soon moving in artistic and literary circles. He met the art critic from Ch√¢teauroux, George-Albert Aurier, made the acquaintance of Paul Verlaine and adopted the pseudonym \\"Paterne Berrichon\\". In 1896, he published the poems of his youth in which he showed the original and slightly excessive side to his personality. Fervent admirer of Arthur Rimbaud, he started a correspondence with Isabelle Rimbaud, the younger sister of the poet, which concluded in 1897 by marriage. Once together, they strove to perpetuate the cult of the poet from Charleville. In perfect tune with the social attitudes of the time, the Berrichons' not always objective approach to the life and works of Rimbaud was characterised by an inflexible ideology based on traditional values of respectability and morality. Their overriding desire was to present an angelic Rimbaud erasing the infernal periods of the poet's life; was seeking to establish that Rimbaud's relationship with Verlaine was chaste; and that Rimbaud rediscovered his catholic faith on his death bed. In his edition of Rimbaud's works, for which he had obtained the backing of Paul Claudel, Paterne Berrichon made at least a third of the poems and about two thirds of the correspondence disappear. Berrichon was the friend of Paul Claudel and maintained a prolific correspondence with him from 1912 until 1919. He also created paintings, for which his wife often modelled, and sculpted a bust for the Rimbaud monument in the poet's birthplace, Charleville-M√©zi√®res.L'ABCdaire de Rimbaud, Flammarion 1978, p.68 A publishing house, established in Crest, Dr√¥me and specialising in poetry, called itself the \\"Enemies of Paterne Berrichon\\" to denounce the distorted and commercialised practices of Rimbaud's brother-in-law.

Constructed in the Dravidian architecture, the temple is located in the Virudhachalam - Manavalanallur Road. The legend of the temple is associated with Saivite saint Sundarar and the Vriddhagiriswarar temple ad Virudhachalam. The temple has a five-tiered gateway tower, the gopuram, leading to a pillared hall and the sanctum. The temple is open from 6:30 am ‚Äì 8:30 pm. Four daily rituals and many yearly festivals are held at the temple, of which Panguni Uthiram festival celebrated during the Tamil month of Panguni (March - April), ten day Vasantha Utsavam during Vaikasi (May- June) and Adi festival being the most prominent. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Legend Image of the guardian deity Muniswarar As per Hindu legend, Sundarar, the famous Nayanmar saint in Saivite tradition belonging to the 8th century, came to Virudhachalam (called Thirumudukundram) during his old age. He sang praise of the Vriddhagiriswarar. Shiva was much pleased with his rendition and wanted to have him sing a song again. He sent his son Muruga in the form of a hunter to the Kolanji forest through which Sundarar was traversing. The hunter took away the belongings of Sundarar. He demanded the hunter to return his belongings for which the hunter wanted him to be back at Virudhachalam. Understanding that it is a divine play, Sundarar returned to Virudhachalam temple and sang praise of Shiva again. Vrida means old age and hence the place was called Virudhachalam as Sundarar came to the place during his old age. Muruga subsequently set his abode in the Kolanji forest as Kolanjiappar. As per another legend, a cow was milking under a kolanji bush at this place. Since the cow was doing it daily, the people at this place were surprised and they found a form of stone under it. They identified later with the legend associated with Sundarar's travel from Vridhachaalam. Architecture The temple is located in Manavalanallur, in the outskirts of Virudhachalam in Cuddalore district in Tamil Nadu on the road from Virudhachalam to Manavalanallur. The temple has a five tiered rajagopuram, the gateway tower, which pierces the granite wall surrounding the temple. The sanctum faces East and the image of the presiding deity is a small altar , unlike most temples in the state which have sculpted granite or stucco images. There are separate shrines for Idumban, Kadamban. There are two images of Muniappa facing the sanctum in the Mahamandapam. There is a shrine of Siddhi Vinayakar in the Mahamandapam. During the consecration in 2010, a newly built Northern temple tower, marriage hall, a shopping complex, Mani Mandap, Sidhar Mandap and a guesthouse for the devotees were added with the help of public contributions. In modern times, the Cuddalore district administration has identified the temple as one of the prominent tourist attractions in the district. Festival and religious practises Stucco images indicating the legend of the temple The temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. The temple rituals are performed four times a day: Kalasandhi at 8:00 a.m., Uchikala poojai at 12:00 p.m., Sayarakshai at 6:00 p.m., and Arthajama Pooja at 8:15 p.m. Each ritual has three steps: alangaram (decoration), neivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for the presiding deities. There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple. The temple is open from 6:30 am ‚Äì 12:00 pm and 5 - 8:30 pm on all days except during festive occasions when it has extended timings. The major festivals of the temple include the Panguni Uthiram festival celebrated during the Tamil month of Panguni (March - April), ten day Vasantha Utsavam during Vaikasi (May- June) and Adi festival. During the Panguni Uthiram, the flag hoisting is done on the first day, while the presiding deities of the temple are taken in a chariot round the streets of the temple. During Adi festival, hundreds of devotees carry pots of milk and Kavadi around the streets of the temple, which is followed by a feast attended by close to 5,000 people. Devotees offer hen, cattle and sheep to the temple along with other offerings like facsimile or shapes of body parts in small shapes made of tin. Offering money or object equals to one's weight, tonsuring, carrying milk pots and piercing body parts with Vel are all other common forms of worship. The temple also offers Annadanam scheme from 2002, where lunch is served to the devotees everyday.

Production  Unlike other grape brandies, pisco is distilled only once. It is also distilled from wine, rather than grape pomace, and is not aged in barrels. It thus retains many of the fresh flavours and aromas that were found in the young wine, in the form of small and highly volatile molecules called aldehydes and esters. To capture these molecules and ensure they are retained in the distillate, Monteluz use similar methods to traditional perfume manufacturers such as Fragonard and Galimard in Grasse, France. Like the jasmine pickers of Grasse, for example, they are known to pick their grapes at night when temperatures are much lower, and to stack the grapes on shelves inside their trucks, to avoid the grapes at the top squashing the ones at the bottom during transportation (contact between the yeast on the skins and the sugars inside grapes is what triggers fermentation). Also, like a perfume essence, Monteluz's pisco is bottled in a dark bottle to avoid its fragrant chemicals being altered by sunlight.Patrick, Kate. \\"The Re-birth of Pisco\\", Luxury Briefing, London, 13 February 2015.

He was a founding professor and second president of Illinois College. Sturtevant, son of Warren and Lucy (Tanner) Sturtevant, was born in Warren, Connecticut on July 26, 1805. In 1816, the family removed to the Western Reserve, and settled in Tallmadge (then Portage), Ohio, whence two sons came to Yale College in 1822. Julian, the younger son, graduated in 1826. After teaching school in New Canaan, Connecticut, he entered the Yale Theological Seminary in 1828, and was ordained at Woodbury, Connecticut on August 27, 1829, as an evangelist. Four days later, he married Elizabeth M. Fayerweather of New Canaan. In the ensuing fall, as one of the \\"Illinois Band\\" which he had helped to form in the Seminary, he settled in the infant town of Jacksonville, Illinois, and there in January 1830, he became the first teacher in what is now Illinois College. In 1831, he was elected Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy in the institution which he had organized, and he continued to be thus engaged until November 1844, when he was advanced to the Presidency of Illinois College. He resigned the latter office in May 1876, but continued to teach for nine years longer in the department of Mental and Political Science. Until after his retirement from the Presidency, his engagements were too burdensome to allow of extended authorship, but in 1877 he published Economics, or the Science of Wealth, and in 1880 The Keys of Sect; or the Church of the New Testament. The degree of Doctor of Divinity was conferred on him by the University of Missouri in 1848, and that of Doctor of Laws by Iowa College in 1871. His wife died in 1840, and the next year he married her sister, Hannah Fayerweather, who died January 17, 1886. Her death was a severe shock to him, and his own death followed one month later at Jacksonville, on February 11, in the 81st year of his age. He had ten children, five by each marriage. The eldest son, Julian, an Illinois College graduate, was a clergyman, bearing his father's name. Sturtevant was the grandfather of geneticist Alfred Sturtevant and great-grandfather of biochemist Julian Sturtevant.

Biography Seetha Coleman- Kammula in India and attended her undergraduate studies at Osmania University of Hyderabad, India. She went on to pursue a PhD in organic chemistry from Auburn University in Auburn, Alabama and then did her post-graduate research at Princeton University. She was awarded a NATO Fellowship and completed additional studies at the University of Amsterdam. In 1978, she was hired as a researcher at Royal Dutch Shell in Amsterdam where she worked until 1988. After ten years, she moved with Shell to England where she worked as a business development manager. Later Coleman-Kammula transferred to both Belgium and Houston, Texas, as the head of the epoxy resins unit creating plastics. In 2000, she left Shell and became a senior vice president at Basell Polyolefins, where she focused on asset management, innovation and strategic marketing. She also served on the Board of Directors of Indelpro, a joint venture between Basell and Alfa in Mexico. In 2005, Coleman-Kammula left Bassell and founded Simply Sustain, a consulting firm aimed at advising businesses on more sustainable models. After a trip to India around that time, Coleman-Kammula realized that the plastics she had helped develop were negatively impacting the environment because as an inventor and designer she had never considered what happened when the product was no longer usable and became waste. She now consults with firms recommending that they supply the information of what is in their products and how to disassemble them, both as a means of protecting the environment and providing jobs in disposal and recycling. She promotes \\"industrial ecology\\" and recommends that corporate entities make environmental impact assessments over the life cycle of products as a means of increasing value of products and decreasing the negative impacts to the environment.

They pledged to live like the poorest of their parishioners and adopt a lifestyle free of attachment to ordinary possessions. The Pact said they would \\"try to live according to the ordinary manner of our people in all that concerns housing, food, means of transport.... We renounce forever the appearance and the substance of wealth, especially in clothing ... and symbols made of precious metals.\\" More than 500 bishops added their signatures in the next few months. The catacombs were chosen for their association with early Christian martyrs in the centuries when the Church was without worldly power and existed in its simplest form. Laying the theological foundation for the Pact, Cardinal Giacomo Lercaro, Archbishop of Bologna, in December 1962 addressed the Council at length on the centrality of poverty. He held, according to one summary of his views, that \\"the question of the church of the poor ... should be the general and synthesizing subject of the whole Council.\\" H√©lder C√¢mara, Archbishop of Olinda e Recife, Brazil, was the moving force behind the Pact itself. Others included the Brazilians Bishop Ant√¥nio Batista Fragoso of Crate√∫s and Bishop Jose Maria Pires of Ara√ßua√≠; Bishop Manuel Larra√≠n Err√°zuriz of Talca, Chile; Bishop Marcos Gregorio McGrath of Santiago de Veraguas, Panama; and Bishop Leonidas Proa√±o of Riobamba, Ecuador. Bishop Charles-Marie Himmer (1902-1994) of Tournai, Belgium, presided at the Mass. The only North American among the first to sign was Bishop Gerard-Marie Coderre of Saint-Jean-de-Quebec. Luigi Bettazzi, who was Auxiliary Bishop of Bologna under Lercaro when he signed and who became the last survivor of the original signors, said a few bishops created the document and then plans for a signing ceremony \\"spread by word of mouth\\". He felt the document was forgotten because Pope Paul VI, given the Cold War environment of his papacy, preferred not to be associated with its implicit criticism of capitalism. He has also cited the impact of the upheavals of 1968, which \\"frightened everyone and everything closed down\\". Thus it failed to put poverty at the center of the Church's mission, except in Latin America where it became associated with liberation theology. The document itself has been lost, but as the fiftieth anniversary of its signing approached the Pact gained increasing notice due to the efforts of theologians and historians, especially in Germany, to draw attention to its significance. The Pontifical Urban University held a conference on its legacy in November 2015. According to Bettazzi, \\"The Pact of the Catacombs today is ... Pope Francis\\". Cardinal Walter Kasper, who mentioned the pact in his book Mercy (2014), has said of Pope Francis that \\"His program is to a high degree what the Catacomb Pact was\\". Francis met with Bettazzi in September 2017 before addressing priests, religious, seminarians and deacons in Bologna, where he began his speech with words reminiscent of the Pact: \\"It is a consolation to be with those who carry on the apostolate of the Church; religious men seeking to bear witness against worldliness.\\" References ;Sources: * Text of the \\"Pact of the Catacombs\\", also here * Catholic theology and doctrine Christian theological movements Marxism Religion and politics Liberation theology Catholic social teaching Christian radicalism ","title":"Pact of the catacombs"},{"id":"48658134","text":"Biagio Maria Bellotti (Busto Arsizio, 26 February 1714 ‚Äì Busto Arsizio, 5 August 1789) was an Italian painter, architect, sculptor, musician and canon. 18th-century Italian painters Italian male painters Lombard painters 1714 births 1789 deaths ","title":"Biagio Bellotti"},{"id":"48658137","text":"Robert Oswald Moser (1874-1953) was a British artist and illustrator.

She was an advocate of equal rights for women in the arts, and especially equal rights for women whose aspirations were to become pianists. Early life and education Sorel was born in Paris, France, on 10 October 1932. She emigrated to the United States with her family in 1940 prior to the Nazi invasion of France. At age 10 she received a scholarship to study at the Juilliard School, and at age 11 she debuted on the concert recital stage, performing with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra at Carnegie Hall. A reviewer in the New York Times wrote that \\"a child capable of so polished and eloquent an example of pianism has a future worth watching\\". She went on to study at the Curtis Institute of Music from 1948 to 1953, and simultaneously studied mathematics at Columbia University. Career She performed frequently as a piano soloist both during and after her studies. While researching the composer Sergei Rachmaninoff at the Moscow Conservatory, Sorel discovered two nocturnes by the composer that had never previously been performed. She premiered these in 1973 at a recital celebrating the composer's centenary. This was her last public recital - the following year she was injured in a fall on an ice-covered sidewalk and quit performing. Later in her life, Sorel published books for young pianists and taught piano at the University of Kansas, Ohio State University and SUNY Fredonia. At SUNY she chaired the piano department and was the first woman to be named a Distinguished Professor at the institution. Sorel founded the Sorel Organization in 1996, dedicated to the memory of her parents; this organization promotes women in music. She was an advocate for women in the arts, publishing an article in Music Journal in 1968 advocating equal opportunities for women pianists. Sorel died of cancer in Hampton Bays, New York, on 6 August 1999.

There is one described species in the genus, Anbarrhacus adamantis, which is one of three millipedes described from Mexican amber. History and classification Anbarrhacus adamantis was described from a solitary fossil, which is preserved as an inclusion in a transparent chunk of Mexican amber. At the time of description, the amber specimen was housed in the fossil collection of the Instituto Nacional de Antropolog√≠a e Historia in San Crist√≥bal de las Casas, Simojovel. The holotype fossil is composed of a very complete immature male recovered from the Guadalupe Victoria site. Mexican amber is recovered from fossil bearing rocks in the Simojovel region of Chiapas, Mexico. The amber dates from between 23 million years old at the oldest and 15 million years at the youngest. The Guadalupe Victoria site is an outcrop of amber bearing strata belonging to both the Mazantic Shale and Balumtum Sandstone. The deposits preserve a transitional river or stream environments near the coast and preserves fossils of a mangrove forest ecosystem. The holotype was first studied by a team of researchers headed by Francisco Riquelme of the Universidad Aut√≥noma del Estado de Morelos with their 2014 type description of the genus and species being published in the natural sciences journal PLOS ONE. The genus name is a derived from a combination of the Arabic voice word √°nbar for \\"amber\\" and rhacus, which is used frequently as a genus suffix in the family Platyrhacidae. The specific epithet adamantis was coined from the neo Latin word adamantus meaning diamond, a reference to the patterning on the tops of the collum and metatergites. A. adamantis is one of three millipede species described from Mexican amber, the others being Maatidesmus paachtun and Parastemmiulus elektron, while a number of other species have been described from the similarly aged Dominican amber. Description The A. adamantis male is mostly a creamy white in coloration with a yellowish tone to the labrum and areas of the legs. The sterna grade between yellowish and brown. The total body length is approximately and has a total of 17 body segments plus head. The head is a little wider than the next body segment, called the collum. The antennae have a total of seven antennomeres that vary in length and form a club-shaped tip. The longest segment is antennomere 5 followed by antennomere 6, and the shortest are antennomeres 1 and 7. Both antennomeres 5 and 6 have long setae near their apical ends, and the antennae have four sensory cones preserved. The upper plates of the body segments after the collum are heavily lobed forming metatergites and paranota. The surface of the paranota, side lobes of the metatergites, have a granular texturing, and the metatergites have a distinct diamond shaped patterning in the texturing. The segments gradually get wider from the head to about two thirds of the way down the body after which the segments start to narrow progressively to segment 17. The male is mature enough to show developing bulb shaped gonopods on segment 7.

He is also a fighter (MMA and BJJ) and a teacher. He currently lives and coach in London, UK. Lucio was nicknamed \\"Lagarto\\" by Marcio Feitosa, as a joke due to Lucio's resemblance to the reptile. People now use it as a comparison with his abilities on the mat and his regeneration capacities after his cancer.http://www.bjjheroes.com/bjj- fighters/lucio-rodrigues-lagarto  Early life  Rodrigues was born in Rio de Janeiro. His life as Martial Artist started very early, at the age of 5, where he started training with Anselmo Rodrigues(his father). He then joined the Carlos Augusto's ( 4th degree black belt under Reyson Gracie) academy at the age of 13 where he focused completely on training hard. At the age of 17 years, after receiving his blue belt, Lagarto opened his own academy with a friend and then moved to the Gracie Barra Academy in Barra da Tijuca to train with Carlos Gracie, Jr.. Rodrigues received all his belts, from purple to black, from Carlos Gracie, Jr.. In 2004, after receiving his black belt at the age of 24, Carlos Gracie, Jr. asked Rodrigues to move to Portugal to promote BJJ in Europe. After a period of 6 months Rodrigues moved back to Brazil, where he had his first experience as a MMA fighter in Top Fighter MMA. He won his fight against Roberto Albuquerque in the 1st round by submission (armbar).http://www.mma- core.com/fighters/Lucio_Lagarto_Rodrigues/102237http://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Lucio- Rodrigues-19528  Overcoming cancer  In 2007, Rodrigues was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma, a cancer of the lymphatic system at only 27 years old. He had to undergo a tough chemotherapeutic treatment and doctors told him he would never be able to train or compete again. Despite the doctors opinion, and just a month after the start of his treatment, Rodrigues restarted both training and teaching. Rodrigues believes that his healthy lifestyle (no drinks, no drugs, no cigarettes or red meat and plenty of rest) has helped him endured the chemotherapy. In 2008, after the end of his treatment, Rodrigues restarted the competition. He successfully competed in both the Rio de Janeiro State Championship and the Jordan Capital Challenge. It is only after winning Gold in both these competitions that Rodrigues revealed to everyone that he had cancer. According to one of his student, Simon McGovern (one of the few who knew about Lagarto's disease), Rodrigues made them promise to never talk about his cancer to anyone because he did not want to have any sympathy from other competitors.http://www.evenutrition.co.uk/index.php/fuel-for-victory- what-our-athlets-have-to-say/lucio-lagarto  New life in the UK  In 2006, Rodrigues gave a seminar in England where he met John Paul Hartley(Bjj Head teacher), who invited him to come and teach in his school. Rodrigues and John Paul then created the Gracie Barra Preston Academy. Rodrigues have now opened numerous Gracie Barra Academies (Gracie Barra Preston; Gracie Barra Glasgow; Gracie Barra Knightsbridge and recently Gracie Barra Fulham) with the objective of preparing students to become future instructors to open their own school or become Gracie Barra affiliates.

His lab has found that autophagy may be inhibited in various neurodegenerative diseases and has elucidated the pathological consequences of autophagy compromise. In addition his research has advanced the basic understanding of autophagy, identifying the plasma membrane as a source of autophagosome membrane and characterising early events in autophagosome biogenesis,.

The faery race is dying off and Knife is convinced that humanity may hold the key to saving them from almost certain extinction as their magic is slowly disappearing, and will not last much longer. However her Queen is adamant that faeries and humans should never mix. Despite this, Knife defies her ruler, meeting and befriending the paraplegic artist Paul McCormick, to whom she is instantly and inexplicably drawn. Rebel Linden is a teenage faery that must venture out into the human world to find a way to save her people, as she is one of the few among them with any usable knowledge of the outside world. In the process she meets Timothy, who was taken in by his cousin, Paul McCormick, and his wife Peri, after his boarding school suspends him. Timothy has a gift for guitar music, something that placed him into the path of some faeries keen on taking it from him. Linden manages to save him, only for this to make the both of them a target. Arrow Rhosmari is a young faery that has led a peaceful, yet sheltered existence, as her home lies on one of several islands that are free of any human contact. Apart from a group who have already left to help the rebel group, her people want little to do with the faeries from the mainland and their politics, but Rhosmari leaves alone to retrieve a precious artefact, the Stone of Naming, in the hopes that its retrieval could prevent them getting drawn into the fray. This proves to be easier said than done, as the young faery quickly experiences major culture shock due to the many differences between the mainland and the remote islands. Things grow worse when the evil Empress sets her sights on enslaving Rhosmari's people.  Critical reception  Critical reception for the series has been mostly positive. Knife was widely praised for its story and imagination, and Strange Horizons commented that the relationship between Paul and Knife worked especially well as it \\"manages to be both completely individually theirs and also more universally that of a couple of any kind, needing to negotiate their differences‚Äîof background, experience or just habit‚Äîwith flexibility and generosity of spirit.\\" NATE Classroom wrote a mostly favourable review of Knife, writing \\"The setting of the story lacks the intricacy of a fully built fantasy world that readers may be seeking. Instead it relies on the relationship between the characters to draw in the reader. It is a spellbinding fairytale dark enough to keep any boy or girl totally engrossed from beginning to end.\\" School Librarian gave Rebel a favourable review, praising it for its complexity and stating that it \\"is a book to enchant anyone who loves a fairy story.\\" The Horn Book Guide and the School Library Journal echoed similar sentiments, with the School Library Journal writing that \\"Awkwardly out of place Christian doctrine may distract some readers, but, all in all, this is an enjoyable story that will appeal to fantasy fans.\\" Awards and nominations *CLA Book of the Year for Children Award (2010, nominee ‚Äì Knife) *Concorde Book Award (2010, won ‚Äì Knife) *Carnegie Medal (2010, nominee ‚Äì Knife) *Christy Award (2015, Young Adult Category finalist ‚Äì \\"Rebel\\")  Ivy of the Delve  In 2012 Anderson published Swift through Orchard books. Its sequel, Nomad, followed in 2014. The series is set within the same universe as the Faery Rebels series but is considered to be separate.  Swift  Swift follows Ivy, a Cornish piskey born without wings. Years earlier her mother went missing during the Lighting ceremony, an important event within her clan that marked the first time Ivy went outside of the tin mine her clan calls home. Her father assumes that she was stolen away by spriggans and becomes emotionally and physically distant from his children, leaving Ivy to assume their daily care. When another faery goes missing the clan is sure that it is due to the spriggans. Ivy eventually meets Martin, a man who seems to offer a solution to her issues but has secrets that could prove dangerous to the clan ‚Äì especially as they suspect him to be a spriggan responsible for the disappearances.  Nomad  Ivy has been exiled from her home due to the jealousy of her clan's queen, Betony. She's not alone, as the half spriggan, half faery Martin is with her. Together they must find a way to successfully convince the others that they are slowly being poisoned while also trying to figure out the cause for Ivy's strange dreams.

He was drawn by their architectural variety, by an interest in the life of both privilege and oppression they represented, and by their physical remoteness; as a result he devoted the majority of his life to their study.

University Press of Colorado (1990); Project Gutenberg edition Bartlett's lifelong study of the Mexican haciendas has received recognition by historians and art critics: Early in Bartlett's study Mexican historian Ricardo Lancaster-Jones learned of Bartlett's project and contributed a group of hacienda photographs. Critical assessments of Bartlett's hacienda study include: \\"Work of indubitable historic and artistic interest... [S]ince these edifices are fast disappearing, his work has great value for the history and monumental art of Mexico\\" (Silvio Zavala, historian of Mexico and former Ambassador of Mexico to France);From University Press of Colorado, publisher's printed book publication announcement of The Haciendas of Mexico: An Artist's Record, 1990.Quotation from Silvio Zavala's letter dated Dec. 12, 1966, copy in the Paul Alexander Bartlett Collection held by the Department of Special Collections of the Charles E. Young Research Library of the University of California in Los Angeles \\"extraordinarily worthwhile collection\\" (Donald B. Goodall, former Director, Blanton Museum of Art of the University of Texas).Literary and art correspondence in the Paul Alexander Bartlett Collection, American Heritage Center. \\"These [pen-and-ink illustrations of the haciendas] are interpretations by a strong personality. The themes are projected as though by a creator of the theatre. [Bartlett's] technic, or better still, his technics, are full of wisdom and experience. They express not only the true character of the places represented, but also a personal atmosphere that is decorative and imaginative. There is always mystery in his drawings. He evokes this mystery in black and white, and there is no doubt that his work expresses the qualities of a magnificent poet artist\\" (Roberto Montenegro, Mexican artist). Frank Tannenbaum, Professor of History at Columbia University, wrote: \\"[Y]ou really have something which is beautiful and permanent, and something which is the result of long and devoted interest to a phase of Mexican history which is passing away.\\".From Frank Tannenbaum's letter dated May 21, 1968, copy in the Paul Alexander Bartlett Collection, American Heritage Center Writing about the single-artist exhibition of Bartlett's pen-and-ink hacienda illustrations hosted by the Los Angeles County Museum, Gerald Nordland, former Dean of the Chouinard Art School, described the exhibit in the Los Angeles Times: \\"In a valuable art exhibit, Mr. Bartlett documents the architecture, sculpture, and utilitarian objects related to the life of the hacienda, in sensitively descriptive drawings of the feudal villas of the Mexican past. This exhibition material... [offers] a record of the vanishing architectural-social-economic history of Mexico.\\" About Bartlett's The Haciendas of Mexico: An Artist's Record, Oakah L. Jones, Professor of History, Purdue University, wrote: \\"This publication will aid scholars as a reference work for illustrative material and descriptions of decaying or lost haciendas. At the same time, the work will be of great interest to the general reader interested in Mexico and its history.\\" Historian Barbara A. Tenenbaum of the Hispanic Division of the Library of Congress described The Haciendas of Mexico: An Artist's Record as \\"a remarkable book in many ways, and one whose virtues can only grow with time. Paul Alexander Bartlett began sketching and photographing Mexican haciendas in the 1940s, and although his works reflect a considerably different style, they are comparable with Frederick Catherwood's historic renderings of the Maya ruins found by John Lloyd Stephens a century before.\\"Tenenbaum, Barbara A. \\"Mexico, So Close to the United States.\\" Latin American Research Review, Vol. 30, No. 1, 1995, pp. 226-236. Works of fiction and critical response Paul Alexander Bartlett's published book- length works of fiction include: When the Owl Cries When the Owl Cries (Macmillan, 1960). The book's title is from the Mexican-Indian superstitious saying, \\"Cuando el tecolote llora, se muere el indio\\" ‚Äì \\"When the owl cries, an Indian dies.\\" The work was listed by The New York Times in its Best- seller/Recommended column for several weeks after its release. The dramatic setting of the novel is an hacienda caught up in the violence of the Mexican Revolution of 1910. The story recounts the life of the hacendado, the owner of the hacienda, the love he feels for a beautiful young woman, and the ordeals they share as the turmoil and violence of the Mexican Revolution encompass them. The novel closely follows the history of the Revolution, and gives the reader a first-hand feeling for hacienda life. Reviews of the book appeared in newspapers in the U.S. and abroad (see below under \\"Recognition and Importance\\"). The novel was described in the Library Journal as \\"A Gone with the Wind of Mexico.\\"Book reviews on file in the Paul Alexander Bartlett Collection, American Heritage Center Charles Poore, reviewing the book in The New York Times, wrote: \\"As you turn the pages you ask, what next? That is the immemorial appeal of the thriller. But what gives the story stature as a work of creative art is that Mr. Bartlett has been at pains to populate it with believable characters who are stirred by intensely personal concerns.\\" Paul Engle, in the Chicago Tribune, wrote: \\"The book charms with its expert knowledge of place and people.\\" Lon Tinkle, writing in the Dallas Morning News, commented: \\"Vivid, impressive, highly pictorial. What makes it a pleasure to read are its marvelous vignettes of Mexican ways of life.\\" The Florida Times-Union reviewed the book with the comment: \\"This is a book the reader can see in his mind ‚Äî on a wide screen in technicolor with stereophonic sound. It doesn't need Hollywood but it's the kind of story that wouldn't do the movies any harm.\\" Adi√≥s, Mi M√©xico When the Owl Cries was followed in 1979 by Bartlett's novelette, Adi√≥s, Mi M√©xico (Autograph Editions). Like When the Owl Cries, the novelette takes place on an hacienda; it recounts the struggle of an hacienda-owning family during the Mexican Revolution. About the book, Evelyn Eaton wrote: \\"The novelette has a wonderful flavor of its own. It is a classic.\\"Reviews quoted in Bartlett, Paul Alexander. Adi√≥s, Mi M√©xico. San Diego, CA: Autograph Editions, 1979, p. 1. James Purdy added: \\"I read Adi√≥s, Mi M√©xico with great pleasure. Bartlett really does the Mexican ambiente well. The novelette is very good indeed and most distinguished.\\"Documents and other materials on file in the Paul Alexander Bartlett Collection, American Heritage Center. Grace Flandrau commented: \\"Adi√≥s, Mi M√©xico rings so true; characters and scenes are so right and living. It is so beautifully done, one finds oneself feeling it is not fiction but actual experienced fact.\\" Frank Tannenbaum commented: \\"The novelette shows a true sense of both the character of the hacienda and the tragedy that overtook it; it is written with great sensibility.\\" Ralph Roeder noted: \\"Bartlett's gifts, his pungent sense of language, his style, his poignant sympathy for and intimate knowledge of Mexican life mark his work as outstanding.\\" Josephine Jacobsen observed: \\"I became so fascinated with this book that I sat down and read it straight through. Since I have been to Mexico five times, it seemed especially real to me, and most moving. It is certainly beautifully written and so vivid that one feels oneself inside it.\\" Forward, Children! Several of Bartlett's novels were published following his death. Forward, Children! (My Friend Publisher, 1998) is an anti-war novel that received recognition from well-known authors who included Pearl Buck, Upton Sinclair, John Dos Passos, and Ford Madox Ford.Information from Bartlett, Steven James. \\"Introduction.\\" In the Project Gutenberg edition of Forward, Children!. The title comes from the opening line of the French national anthem, \\"La Marseillaise\\": \\"Allons, enfants de la patrie / Le jour de la gloire est arriv√©\\" ‚Äî \\"Forward, children of our country / The day of glory is at hand.\\" The novel describes World War II as experienced by a group of U.S. soldiers in the tank corps during battles in France, Germany, and North Africa. At the same time, Forward, Children! is a love story that unfolds in Ermenonville, France, where Jean-Jacques Rousseau lived during the last period of his life and was buried. About the novel, literary critic and novelist Russell Kirk wrote: \\"Permit me to commend Forward, Children! The novel attains a pathos rare in war novels. The scenes of battle are drawn with power. Bartlett is an accomplished writer.\\" Pearl Buck, Nobel Laureate in Literature, wrote: \\"He [Bartlett] is an excellent writer. Forward, Children! is an excellent piece of work, with fine characterizations.\\" John Dos Passos commented: \\"This is a very, very good novel.\\" Upton Sinclair wrote: \\"I found Forward, Children! extremely interesting and convincing. I think it is one of the best descriptions of fighting I have ever read. In fact, I can't remember any account of tank fighting in such detail and [that is so] convincing.\\" James Purdy remarked: \\"Forward, Children! ranks with the best books ‚Äî its anti-war message is inescapable. It is an important book and [Bartlett is] an important writer.\\" Ford Madox Ford wrote at length about the novel in an essay in the Saturday Review of Literature: \\"Forward, Children! ... is the projection of the life of a fighting soldier in the A. E. Tank Corps in France. It is so to the life that for some days after reading it, the writer's nights were rendered heavy by the return of the lugubrious dreams that for years after the signing of the Treaty of Versailles attended on his slumbers. When you read Forward, Children! you are in a tank crawling amidst unspeakable din and unthinkable pressure up the sides of houses, and down the banks of dried-up canals, crashing through the walls of factories. ... [I]f not on artistic grounds then at least for the public weal this book should be published and widely circulated.\\"Ford, Ford Madox. \\"Travel Notes, I. Return to Olivet,\\" Saturday Review of Literature, Vol. XX, No. 7, June 10, 1939, pp. 13-14. John Dos Passos remarked: \\"Praise from Ford Madox Ford is praise indeed. The descriptions of tank warfare are vivid and as far as I know unique.\\" Voices from the Past Bartlett's quintet of novels, a format rarely found in literature,Information from Bartlett, Steven James. \\"Preface.\\" In Bartlett, Paul Alexander. Voices from the Past‚ÄîA Quintet. Salem, OR: Autograph Editions, 2007, pp. xiii-xiv. was published in 2007. The five novels that comprise Voices from the Past include Sappho's Journal, Christ's Journal, Leonardo da Vinci's Journal, Shakespeare's Journal, and Lincoln's Journal. Based on historical research, Bartlett sought to bring to life the inner experience of these \\"voices from the past\\" in the form of intimate, personal journals, incorporating into each novel passages from their original writings as well as quotations from others who knew them. Each novel is illustrated with Bartlett's pen-and-ink illustrations. Also in 2007, Sappho's Journal, with a preface by Sappho scholar and translator Willis Barnstone, and Christ's Journal were published as separate volumes. About Sappho's Journal, Barnstone wrote: \\"Paul Bartlett's journal of Sappho is a masterful work..., at once poetic, dramatic and powerful. In his Journal he does more than create a vague illusion of the past. He conveys the character of real people, their interior life and outer world. A mature artist, he writes with ease and taste.\\"Barnstone, Willis. \\"Foreword.\\" In Bartlett, Paul Alexander. Sappho's Journal. Salem: OR. Autograph Editions, 2007, p. xi. Between 2012 and 2015, with the consent of Bartlett's son and literary executor, Steven James Bartlett, Voices from the Past, Sappho's Journal, Christ's Journal, Forward, Children!, When the Owl Cries, and The Haciendas of Mexico: An Artist's Journal were made freely available to readers for non-commercial use through Project Gutenberg.

It premiered on December 1, 2015 on Fox. The episode was directed by Bradley Buecker and written by Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk, and Ian Brennan. In this episode, The Red Devils attempt to crash The Chanels' shopping spree in celebration of their favorite holiday, Black Friday. As the Kappa Kappa Tau girls conclude that Dean Munsch (Jamie Lee Curtis) is the Devil, they make several attempts to kill her. Meanwhile, someone else confesses to being the murderer. The episode was watched by 2.40 million viewers and received positive reviews from critics. Plot After the events of the Thanksgiving where Gigi (Nasim Pedrad)'s head was served as the main dish, everyone is still in shock. Wes (Oliver Hudson), Pete (Diego Boneta), and Grace (Skyler Samuels) go to the police station to report the incident, but Detective Chisolm (Jim Clock) revealed that the entire police department has been fired due to wasting resources, and he himself will be transitioning to furniture related job, something he is happy with. Regardless of the events, Chanel (Emma Roberts) explains that Black Friday is her favorite holiday, where she buys forgettable, cheap presents for her friends and good ones for herself. She also explains how every year she bribes the store's worker to open the store earlier for her so she can buy all the things from the sale and leave only one in the display, thus leaving the people who have been waiting for the store to open angry and devastated, all just for her joy. She is about to go to the mall when Dean Munsch (Jamie Lee Curtis) stops her and the other Chanels. They insist on going though, and after a heated speech by Chanel explaining why she loves the holiday so much and pointing out how there's nothing they can currently do about the situation, Dean Munsch desists. At the mall, The Red Devil shows up. The Devil turns off all the lights and manages to trap the Chanels inside. The other Chanels escape, but Chanel stays behind to face it, thinking the Devil is Dean Munsch. She ends up getting shot with a crossbow. She survives after Denise Hemphill (Niecy Nash) and a mall cop come to the rescue for a showdown with the Red Devil. Denise explains to Chanel that she is promoted to police chief. However, while she is talking, her henchman gets shot by the Red Devil, and alarmed, she chases after the masked killer. After the entire incident, the Chanels, Zayday, and Grace have a meeting about how they could protect each other from getting killed while everybody thinks that the murderer is Dean Munsch except Zayday (Keke Palmer). Chanel has the idea to kill Dean Munsch, though Zayday disapproves. Grace unexpectedly agrees with Chanel and they both have the idea to poison Dean Munsch. Chanel and Grace meet up with the Dean at her house pretending that they, particularly Chanel, wants to make amends with Cathy. They present her with apple cider, knowing it is her favorite beverage. Unbeknownst to her, they put blowfish venom in it, supposedly enough to kill several people. Dean Munsch drinks it all, and doesn't even feel slightly ill. Instead, she gave Chanel and Grace an essay assignment about the university. Chanel is baffled as to how Dean Munsch survived this, but later, the Chanels hatch another plan. Grace and Pete are discussing Grace's and the girls' plan to kill Dean Munsch. They discuss it while making out, and Pete disagrees with her plan to kill someone just as Grace stops him from going too far, as she isn't ready to have sex yet. After the talk, she decides to quit the mission. In turn, Zayday also changes her mind from her previous statement, thinking killing Dean Munsch is the right thing to do. Chanel then kicks Grace out of the sorority. Wes and Pete research information about Gigi and find out her birth name was Jess Meyer, and that she is the sister of Amy Meyer (Chelsea Ricketts), the girl from the 1995 flashback who holds Sophia's (McKaley Miller) baby. It is also revealed that Amy committed suicide due to the stress of the event and Gigi then took care of the baby after Amy's suicide. Wes tells Grace about this discovery. Meanwhile, Chad (Glen Powell) brings Pete to the Dickie Dollar Scholars house and reveals that Boone (Nick Jonas) left most of his possessions to Pete, despite the fact that they barely knew each other. Chad suspects that Boone and Pete were lovers. However, Pete admits that Boone was his source for a story about the negative effects of the College Greek system. It was revealed here that Pete was trying to pledge The Dickie Dollar Scholars, but got rejected by Chad, Earl Grey (Lucien Laviscount), Roger (Aaron Rhodes), Dodger (Austin Rhodes), and Caulfield (Evan Paley) because he doesn't fit their criteria. He was deemed the worst Dollar Scholars pledge ever, explaining Pete's hatred to the College Greek system. In response to Boone's friendship, Chad decides to offer Pete membership to the Dickie Dollar Scholars since all of the other members have either left campus or been murdered. Pete refuses and leaves an enraged Chad at the house. The girls decide to freeze Dean Munsch to death using a cryotherapy chamber. Dean Munsch agrees to try cryotherapy with them, and while she's in the chamber, Chanel sets it below zero for 30 minutes. When Chanel opens the door, Dean Munsch is shown covered in ice, still alive. Chanel comes up with one last idea to drown her. She gave the Chanels' and Zayday new smartphones. She will use this to call them when she thinks it's the right time to kill her. Chanel #3, and 6 are in the mall with Chanel #5 asking the store's worker to change an underwear size tag to another, which is impossible. Their cellphones rings as they argue. Chanel nervously waits in the pool as her call doesn't get an answer. The Dean arrives, and after Chanel gives some unconvincing answers to the Dean's questions, she get suspicious and puts Chanel on risk. At the end of the episode, Grace visits Pete's room and tells Pete she's finally ready to have sex with him. Pete refuses, telling her he doesn't want her first time to be with a murderer, shocking her and ending the episode.

He'd crossed paths with them during the events of Hell Week, as he had been outside of the sorority house the night that Denise's (Niecy Nash) friend Shondell (Deneen Tyler) was murdered, and had agreed to help them in exchange for his own life. Pete tries to justify himself by claiming that this helped him accomplish his task of bringing down the Greek system at the college and that Grace herself had even expressed some thoughts to this extent. This horrifies Grace and just as she's about to leave Pete tells her that he's discovered the identity of the remaining Red Devil, who is one of the Chanels.

As she feels her reputation is ruined, in a fit of despair, she tries to kill herself using a mail ordered snake, only for it to end up being a harmless garter snake. Zayday discovers Chanel and tries to convince her that this isn't the end and that she can still change. As Chanel begins to thank Zayday for her advice, the two are attacked by a pizza delivery guy in a Red Devil costume. They manage to fight him off. They take him downstairs, where the rest of the Chanels arrive. Hester (Lea Michele) claims that she saw a girl with burned skin carrying a shovel, but this was dismissed immediately by Chanel to focus on the pizza delivery man. The man claims that he was forced to attack them by an unknown woman and that he has dynamite strapped to his body. Upon realizing the bomb, the girls run away and hide from the man as it goes off, killing him. The death briefly traumatized Chanel #5/Libby Putney (Abigail Breslin). Choosing not to dwell on the man's murder, Chanel decides to apologize to as many people as possible, the first of whom will be Melanie Dorkus (Brianne Howey), the former KKT president that got her skin burned by the tan spray in Pilot. While at her house, Chanel #5 part ways to go on a date. However, rather than going there to apologize, Chanel is actually there to murder Melanie, as she suspects her of being the remaining killer, due to Hester's previous report. During this time, Hester starts to rob Chanel's closet. On the other hand, to know who the killer is, Grace and Zayday decide to break into Munsch's house so they can use her computer to access the personal files of the Chanels, using Grace's father, Wes (Oliver Hudson), to distract Munsch, by having sex with her. Unexpectedly, Wes falls for Cathy. Grace and Zayday find out that one of the Chanels' files has obviously false information such as listing \\"Sweet Valley High\\" as her former high school. With this knowledge in mind they rush to Melanie's house and narrowly prevent Chanel from killing her when Grace reveals Hester is the killer. Grace, Zayday, Chanel and Chanel #3 return to the sorority house, where they find Chanel #5 who claims that she has been stood up on a date. They discover a conscious Hester lying on the ground with a red stilleto in her eye, pointing towards Chanel #5 and accusing her of being the Red Devil.

It premiered on December 8, 2015 on Fox along with the previous episode, \\"Dorkus\\", as the two- hour season finale. It was directed by Brad Falchuk, and written by Falchuk, Ryan Murphy and Ian Brennan. The episode focuses on the last remaining \\"Red Devil\\" killer, and how the revelation impacts the characters' fates. The episode was watched by 2.53 million viewers and received mixed to positive reviews from critics, although the killer's identity was heavily criticized. Plot January 2016 The episode begins one month after the grisly Red Devil murders, where Kappa Kappa Tau is rebuilt as a much better sorority that focuses on feminism and acceptance of different women. The house is now run by Zayday Williams (Keke Palmer) and vice president Grace Gardner (Skyler Samuels) who host an early winter rush party at Kappa where they also introduce the treasurer Hester Ulrich (Lea Michele), now wearing an eyepatch. Hester, begins her narration. She reveals that she is the only Chanel left and the final Red Devil with the 20 year long revenge plan against Kappa House succeeded. She reminisces growing up in a mental asylum alongside her twin brother Boone (Nick Jonas) and Gigi (Nasim Pedrad) who spent three years grieving over the suicide of her sister Amy (Chelsea Ricketts), who had a drug overdose. Hester claimed with the help of asylum doctors, Gigi's self-esteem improved and she taught the children how to be serial killers. Hester also explains that she stole an asylum patient's neck brace to hide her true identity and faked having scoliosis before making up her high school SATs to apply herself into Wallace University which Cathy Munsch (Jamie Lee Curtis) accepted due to Hester's neck deformity. She also explains that they acquired the Red Devil costume from the mascot after Gigi murdered him and she and Boone carried out the plan to burn Melanie Dorkus (Brianne Howey) by filling up her tank with hydrochloric acid and upon her pledging. Hester was also the one who turned on the fryer machine that burned Ms. Bean's (Jan Hoag) face off in the pilot episode. She says that her plan is now over and happy to now have a real family; half sister Grace and illegitimate father Wes (Oliver Hudson). She also explains that there are no Chanels anymore and that she successfully put all the blame on the Chanels. December 2015 The scene goes back to December, where Hester is seen being rushed to the emergency room with the red high heel still in her eye and then blames her attack on Chanel #5/Libby Putney (Abigail Breslin) who is confronted by Chanel (Emma Roberts) and Chanel #3 (Billie Lourd) of injuring Hester. Before threatening to turn her into the police, Denise Hemphill (Niecy Nash) arrives before Hester appears where Grace announces that she is the Red Devil killer but she denies the allegations when her fake parents Clark and Delight (Steven Culp and Jean Louisa Kelly) arrive and prove that Hester was not adopted. Then, Libby's parents Mr. and Mrs. Putney (Wallace Langham and Lara Grice) appear and state that they are not Chanel #5's parents and that Libby was handed over to them by Gigi who encouraged them to enroll Libby into Wallace and encourage her to pledge Kappa House. It is revealed that Hester had a secret meeting with Chanel #5's parents. Chanel #5 is arrested before Hester stops Denise and states that she needs to arrest Chanel #3. Hester accuses Chanel #3 of mowing Deaf Taylor Swift's head off but she denies it by stating she was at the White Stallion with Libby and Chanel but then left. She explains that she had cramps and needed to go to the bathroom but went back to Kappa instead and had diarrhea. It is revealed that Hester put liquid laxatives in her cocktail. Hester accuses Chanel #3 of killing Sam (Jeanna Han) and that she saw Chanel #3 running up the stairs from the basement. Hester shows everyone letters from Chanel #3's biological father Charles Manson on how to kill her friends. Hester explains that Chanel #3 visited a psychologist claiming that her name was \\"Dirty Helen\\" and that she was a leader of a West Coast bikie gang and that Chanel #3 suffers from split personality disorder. Denise forcefully arrests Chanel #3 before Hester finally accuses Chanel of murder. Hester explains that Chanel entered a home improvement store in October and purchased weapons which was on her Diner's Club monthly statement but Hester shows Chanel security footage of Chanel in the store with the items in her trolley but is revealed to be Hester in a blonde wig purchasing weapons for Boone. Zayday announces that Chanel killed Ms. Bean but is revealed to be Hester who turned the deep fryer on and Chanel #3 states that she witnessed Chanel attempting to murder Melanie Dorkus. Chanel denies Hester's accusation; however, Hester states that once the murders happened, Chanel killed the pledges that she thought would damage Kappa Kappa Tau's reputation; however, Chanel responds that she didn't kill Grace and Zayday. Hester responds by explaining that if the two were alive it would protect Chanel's cover and that it is not a coincidence that Chanel would murder the pledges because of their body image, personality and lack of popularity and social skills. Denise arrests Chanel but she attempts to run away with Chanel #3 and #5 following from behind. Denise calls for backup, ex-strippers who are now cops, who grabs a hold of the girls who are escorted out Kappa Kappa Tau while Hester smiles. May 2016 The scene moves forward five months to May 2016. After Hester successfully frames the Chanels for the Red Devil murders, the characters move on and go on with their lives. Chad Radwell (Glen Powell) and Denise start dating but their relationship comes to an end when Denise is forced to break up with her boyfriend as she has to leave for Quantico the next day. Chad doesn't take the news too well and is devastated, however quickly starts a charity based on the deceased Dickie Dollar Scholars members. Dean Munsch writes up a quick book called \\"New New Feminism\\" but it is revealed that a ghost author had written the novel. However, the book and Cathy become a best selling hit and a media sensation. While Grace, Zayday and Hester upkeep the memorial for the victims of the Red Devil, Munsch confronts Hester as to her being the killer and the bathtub baby girl. Hester defends herself by stating that she only killed Pete (Diego Boneta) before Cathy threatens to turn her into police for justice of those who were murdered. She then responds by threatening to turn the Dean into the police for covering up the murder of Sophia Doyle (McKaley Miller) back in 1995 and for killing her ex-husband before the two eventually part ways. Wes (Oliver Hudson) agrees to give Grace space as he and Munsch are going on a vacation and greets her goodbye. In the trials, Chanel, Libby Putney and Chanel #3 (whose name is revealed to be Sadie Swenson) are nearly pronounced not guilty but after Chanel goes on a rant criticizing the jury, the three are sentenced to a mental asylum but unexpectedly find happiness there. Sadie embraces her lesbianism by dating a nurse. Libby is placed under medications that turn her into a tolerable person and suddenly becomes Chanel's best friend. Chanel then narrates that she has been changed into a happy and more friendly person as there are no boys to stay skinny for and no popularity. Chanel is later voted asylum president. Upon going to bed one night, Chanel is awoken by the rubbing of a knife and notices that everyone is still in bed. Believing it to be her imagination, she lays back only to find the Red Devil holding a knife above her. Chanel then lets out one final piercing scream, her fate left unknown. Production FOX originally ordered 15 episodes for the series' first season. They later changed it to 13 episodes, likely as a result of lower than expected ratings. Prior to the series' premiere, Murphy teases that only 4 of the main cast would survive. At the end of the season, only about three main characters died, and the rest of them survived. Reception Ratings \\"The Final Girl(s)\\", along with the previous episode \\"Dorkus\\" as the special two-hour season finale, was watched by a total of 2.53 million U.S. viewers and got a 0.9/3 rating/share in the 18-49 adult demographic. Critical reception The two-hour finale received mixed reviews from critics and audiences alike, with criticism aimed mostly towards the reveal of the final \\"Red Devil\\" killer. The A.V. Club's LaToya Ferguson rated the episode along with \\"Dorkus\\" and gave it a C rating, criticizing it for drawing out the reveal and for putting too much focus on the least interesting characters.

Turner, son of Asa and Abigail (Baldwin) Turner, was born in Templeton, Mass., June 11, 1799. On being converted, at a mature age, he turned his steps towards Yale College, where he graduated in 1827. Immediately on graduation he entered the Yale Theological Seminary, and there early in 1829 united with others in the formation of the \\"Illinois Association\\", the members of which pledged themselves to the cause of religion and education in the young State of Illinois. Turner finished his preparation in 1830, and on September 6 was ordained in New Haven as an evangelist. The week before (August 30), he married Martha, youngest daughter of Isaac D. Bull, of Hartford, Conn. On November 5, they arrived at Quincy, Illinois, where he organized a Congregational Church a month later. He continued in abundant and successful labors in this vicinity until July, 1838, when he removed to Denmark, Iowa, where he had two months before gathered the first Congregational Church in that Territory, the Denmark Congregational United Church of Christ. He prosecuted his pioneer work in Denmark and its neighborhood with rare energy and wisdom until October, 1869, when in accordance with his settled intention he retired from active life, at the age of 70.

Cobb County. The book was self-published May 15, 2015 and details Selman's involvement in the court case resulting from the Cobb County School Board's 2002 decision to affix warning stickers against evolution on the schools' new science textbooks. The trial occurred in November 2004 and the Cobb County school board settled in Selman's favor in December 2006. Author biography Jeffrey Selman was born in 1946 and raised in the Bronx, New York. He was highly influenced by the civil rights era in the 1960s. After receiving a BA in history he joined VISTA which later became AmeriCorps. He became a school teacher in the South Bronx, then later a COBOL programmer and traveled until he met his wife in Atlanta, Georgia and finally settled in Cobb County where he resides as of 2015. Selman served on the Georgia State Public School curriculum committee in 1996. He read an article in the Atlanta weekly alternative paper, Creative Loafing, about anti-evolution stickers in the new science textbooks in Cobb Public Schools, and first contacted the school board about his concerns. After feeling ignored by the school board, Selman contacted the ACLU. At the time his son was attending elementary school in the Cobb school system. After the trial he became the President of the Americans United for Separation of Church and State for Atlanta. Author interview Selman states that he was very upset when he read about what the Cobb County school board had done with the warning stickers on the science textbooks: He told interviewer Josh Zepps on Center for Inquiry's Point of Inquiry podcast that he felt strongly that in science class you are supposed to teach the science, \\"Whether or not you believe in it or understand it, is irrelevant. That's the topic so you should be taught the topic. ... You aren't going to teach French in a Russian class, the kids are there to learn Russian, not French. [The school board members] were defining a definition that evolution was a theory and not a fact, and that is outside even the meaning in a science class.\\" A few years before Selman became aware of the warning stickers, he learned that the Cobb County School board, upon pressure from creationist parents, had contacted the school's textbook publisher regarding concerns of teaching elementary school students about evolution and the Big Bang. The publisher responded by blanking out the pages of their textbook that had chapters concerning these subjects. The publisher left the page numbers on these blank pages, and the index and table of contents still listed evolution and the Big Bang, but the pages concerned were blank. One of the reasons Selman states for writing this book is because \\"you keep banging your head against the wall, eventually a door will open, sure enough... you just can't give up on things.\\" Selman received death threats throughout the case and afterwards, which he calls \\"very unnerving\\" he stated his confusion with the question \\"What ever happened to the commandment, 'Do Not Kill' ... these people don't follow their own tenets.\\" Reactions According to the American Freethought Podcast, the book talks about how the case was started and how long everything took. They considered the book to be very \\"readable\\" with \\"great narration\\" and jokingly stated that it was \\"fantastic for a COBOL programmer\\". Reviewing the book in Skeptical Inquirer magazine, Glenn Branch felt that the book's account of the pre-trial was \\"especially interesting\\" as the media did not cover that aspect as much, the book reveals a lot about the first settlement offer as well as Selman's deposition using transcripts, and also the involvement of the expert witnesses. Branch would have liked to have seen more credit given to the role that Kitzmiller v. Dover had on forcing the school board to settle. According to Branch the book is missing several explanations that would have helped explain the story further. Selman stated that he originally wrote enough for two books, but was advised to cut it back to the content he eventually published. Branch said that the book would have profited by a \\"firm editorial hand\\" to clean up the prose and references. He also states that not having a bibliography and index was \\"mildly frustrating\\". Branch mentioned that Selman's writing style is \\"engaging\\" and states that the use of Yiddish phrases throughout the book will delight some readers. US Court of Appeals Seal Publishing history After talking to publisher friends, Selman decided to self-publish God Sent Me. He used CreateSpace on Amazon.com. Originally the book was going to be about the Cobb School Board and the Cobb County Christian dominant prayer cases, but it was too large. His editor told him to cut out the second case and turn it into two books. Selman says that he is happy to speak about the book in interviews, but that he is not writing another book. Other Selman advises that people need to take a stand when they see something wrong like this. He now understands that you can remain anonymous. The courts need to know your name and check for standing, but your name does not have to become public if you don't want it to. Also when you are contacting a group like the ACLU, you may have to be persistent, they are very busy, they will get back to you, but you have to be patient, nothing will happen quickly. Selman has contacted many bookstores attempting to arrange book signings, he is comfortable doing speaking engagements. He states his goal is to get the word out.

History Founded in 2011, ADFG is headquartered in Abu Dhabi's Abu Dhabi Global Markets (ADGM), with offices in Dubai, London, Eastern Europe, Saudi Arabia and Egypt. Since 2011, the company has evolved and expanded into an integrated financial services platform under the ADFG Group, branching out to cover four key areas: public markets, private markets, debt investments and real estate. The company is also involved in technology investments.https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2018-04-05/adfg-ceo-very- focused-on-gcc-region-at-the-moment-video By 2018, ADFG's assets under management had grown to more than US$6 billion. Since its establishment, ADFG has demonstrated a pioneering track record when it formed the Middle East's first dedicated secondaries-focused private equity fund ‚Äì the ADCM Secondary Private Equity Fund - targeted towards acquiring interests in MENA-based funds. A year later, in 2012, ADFG launched the listed private equity fund Qannas Investment Limited through a flotation on London Stock Exchange's Alternative Investment Market. This was the first ‚Äòcash shell‚Äô arrangement by a Middle Eastern company. Private Markets ADFG's investments in private equity are focused primarily on the GCC but it also seeks opportunities in the wider MENA region and beyond. Typical ticket size is between $50 million and $300 million, usually targeting an Internal Rate of Return of 20 percent or more. Key sectors for investment include financial services and real estate. In November 2016, ADFG completed the acquisition of a 48.36 percent stake in Dubai-based financial services firm Shuaa Capital from Dubai Group. Shuaa Capital returned to profit in 2017, recording its highest full-year profit since 2007. ADFG also founded ADCorp, the first Islamic financial institution based in Abu Dhabi Global Market with a funding round raising over $101m in 2018. Public Markets ADFG invests in public markets across equities and fixed income and participates in both primary offerings and secondary markets. Examples of its investments include stakes in Bahraini investment bank, GFH Financial Group, and Sharjah-based energy group, Dana Gas. Technology In April 2018, ADFG took a strategic stake in 500 Startups, the Silicon Valley venture capital fund to complement its existing technology initiatives. At the time, ADFG said it would be injecting substantial capital to accelerate the growth of 500's key initiatives, expand into new markets, and anchor future global funds. Debt investments ADFG's debt platform, Integrated Alternative Finance (IAF), operates primarily in the UAE and London markets. With strong links to financial institutions and alternative lenders, including ADFG itself, the platform has access to capital that can be structured to specific corporate or project circumstances. In addition, the platform also provides on-going monitoring and management of debt investments on behalf of investors. IAF provides alternative financing and structuring solutions to asset owners and developers for acquisition, restructuring, refinancing or development projects. Regulated by the Dubai Financial Services Authority, IAF's primary focus is in the real estate sector and is particularly targeting expansion in Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Egypt. To date, IAF has arranged finance totaling approximately US$3 billion, with a blended overall return of 15%.

In February 2016, the redevelopment proposal, consisting of six residential-led buildings ranging from 14 to 20 storeys, was approved by Westminster City Council. In total, the development rebranded 'The Broadway' will consist of 268 super prime apartments. Work on the development commenced in November 2016 with the new properties scheduled to be completed in 2021. In November 2015, the CEO of ADFG, Jassim Alseddiqi, stated that there would be \\"major shopping\\" and that 2016 would be an \\"important year\\" for ADFG. In 2017, Niccol√≤ Barattieri di San Pietro, Northacre's chief executive, commented that ‚ÄúLondon will continue to hold its dominant and stable position as the No 1 city for investors‚Äù in real estate. ADFG also owns No.1 Palace Street, situated adjacent to Buckingham Palace which will comprise 72 luxury apartments, restaurant and health and fitness facilities within its 300,000+ square feet once completed. Eastern Europe In September 2015, ADFG officially opened the landmark commercial and residential investment project in Montenegro, The Capital Plaza.

Middle East Etihad REIT is a UAE-based Sharia-compliant Real Estate Investment Trust established and incorporated under the laws of ADGM. Launched in 2016, it has a mixed-use portfolio of assets across the UAE.

Facts An Italian rule limited the name ‚Äòchocolate‚Äô to products without vegetable fats. Those with vegetable fats, mainly British, Irish, and Danish chocolate, were made to label themselves ‚Äòchocolate substitutes‚Äô. The Commission argued this breached Directive 73/241, passed under what is now article 115 TFEU, where article 1 said cocoa and chocolate products mean those in Annex 1, within minimum cocoa content to be described as chocolate. It also argued it infringed TFEU article 34, as the word ‚Äòsubstitute‚Äô devalued the good. Italy, under point 7(a) of the Annex said the free movement clause only applied to products without vegetable fats. Judgment The Court of Justice held that the requirement was contrary to article 34. Under the Directive, the UK, Ireland, Denmark could authorised manufacturers to add vegetable fats to chocolate made there, but it could not benefit from the free movement clause. TFEU article 34 applied to obstacles to marketing products. The Italian rule would make British producers adjust their products and incur additional packaging costs. The Italian law had to be justified by a mandatory requirement, and steps must be proportionate. On the facts, the addition of vegetable fat did not substantially modify the product. So a ‚Äòneutral and objective statement‚Äô informing consumers would be enough. Obliging a change of the sale name was going further than necessary to protect consumers.

History On 22 December 1995, Ott√≥ Stekler (husband of fellow politician M√°ria Seres) and his followers left the Green Party of Hungary (MZP) to form the MSZZP in Ny√≠regyh√°za. During the foundation, the party described itself as an \\"anti-party\\", with several green anarchist and anti-establishment elements in its programme. In the 1998 parliamentary election, the MSZZP was able to set up a regional list in Szabolcs-Szatm√°r- Bereg County and obtained the 0.05 percent of votes, thus won no seats.Nohlen, D & St√∂ver, P (2010) Elections in Europe: A data handbook, p. 899. The party skipped the 2002 parliamentary election. By the 2006 parliamentary election, the MSZZP became known of its guerrilla campaign methods and media PR campaigns and performances, having entered into cooperation with infamous far- right blogger (Tomcat). For instance, young activists of the party tried to attack Fidesz politician Zolt√°n Pokorni with pillows during a campaign event in P√ºsp√∂klad√°ny, but the event organizers have prevented this. Previously the party activists also tried to disturb the campaign speech of G√°bor Demszky, the Mayor of Budapest, by throwing a cake at his face. The MSZZP also released a video record which claimed system-wide counterfeiting of proposal coupons took place at the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) headquarters. Protesting against the electoral system, MSZZP activists burned their proposal coupons in front of the Hungarian Parliament Building. The MSZZP intended to run in the February 2009 Ferencv√°ros parliamentary by-election and nominated Tam√°s Polg√°r as their candidate. However the Metropolitan Court rejected Polg√°r's entrance because 1152 proposal coupons out of 1165 pieces proved to be invalid.A 12. sz.

With thirty-four large miniatures in the style of the Flemish School it is one of the most elaborately decorated manuscripts in the collection of the National Library of Wales in Aberystwyth. It retains an original binding of wooden boards covered in velvet from the early sixteenth century. The volume contains the book plate of Watkin Williams of Penbedw. The first section of the manuscript (ff. 1-185v), La Passion de Nostre Seigneur (The Passion of Our Lord), which was originally translated from Latin into French for Isabelle of Bavaria in 1398, is almost identical to several other Passion de J√©sus-Christ manuscripts such as Biblioth√®que de l'Arsenal MSS. 2038 and 2386, and Biblioth√®que Mazarine MS. 949. Thirty-three of the thirty-four miniatures accompany this text. The presentation page (f. 9) shows Henry VII and his children, Margaret, Mary and the future Henry VIII, mourning the death of Elizabeth of York, his wife and their mother. The king is clad in robes of mourning; in the background his daughters, wearing black hoods, kneel in front of a fire; and behind them their brother Henry, dressed in a green smock, clasps his arms around his head and weeps on his mother's deathbed. A poem Le miroir de la mort (The mirror of death) by Georges Chastellain is the second text in the manuscript (ff. 186-205v). Gwendoline and Margaret Davies of Gregynog purchased this manuscript and donated it to the National Library in 1921. It was one of the manuscripts that were not included in the sale of the Peniarth Manuscripts to Sir John Williams.  Binding  The medieval crimson velvet binding of the Vaux Passional The Vaux Passional is a rare example in the National Library of Wales of a manuscript from the middle ages that retains its original late-medieval binding. The wooden boards, which are visible in places, are covered in crimson velvet. There are marks on the upper cover that were left by the brass bosses that adorned the volume, which was probably bound in a London workshop early in the 16th century. Peniarth 481 is also bound in its original crimson velvet and retains the five brass bosses.

He was the father of Henry Hampden Dutton and a grandfather of writer Geoffrey Dutton. History Henry was born in Melbourne, Victoria, a son of (William) Hampden Dutton (1805 ‚Äì 21 November 1849) and his wife Charlotte da Silva Dutton, n√©e Cameron (1813 ‚Äì 11 May 1885), a stepdaughter of Capt. John Finnis (1802‚Äì1872). Their families were notable in South Australian history; his uncle Francis Stacker Dutton was involved in the discovery and exploitation of the copper deposits near Kapunda and was later Premier of the colony. His parents moved to South Australia in December 1838 and settled for a while in Mount Barker. Hampden persuaded his younger brother Frederick, who was then in Melbourne, to move to South Australia. This he did, in 1841 with the property \\"Koonunga\\" in partnership with Captain Bagot, then in 1843 acquired Finnis's property north east of Kapunda, which he renamed Anlaby. When Henry was five years old his father died; his mother either returned to, or remained in South Australia, living at Strangways Terrace, North Adelaide. Henry was educated at St. Peter's College, and in 1869 was working as a clerk then teller for the original Bank of South Australia, moving to Yankalilla around 1870, Brighton 1872, then around 1880 Mount Pleasant, where he was bank manager in 1890 when his uncle Frederick died, leaving him \\"Anlaby\\". Henry put a great deal of effort into the development of the \\"Anlaby\\" residence. What had started in 1841 as a shingle- covered hut built by overseer Alexander Buchanan (c. 1809 ‚Äì 21 May 1865) and his wife Penelope Ann, n√©e Haddrick Alexander married her 27 January 1848; son 1 November 1848; she died 18 December 1854 after giving birth to twins, of which the girl died in infancy; he married again, on 27 January 1856, to (Penelope's sister?) Cecilia Haddrick, who died 27 November 1903 he developed into what has been described as a \\"mansion, set in delightful surroundings\\". The property decreased in size and importance over the years: part was subdivided for \\"closer settlement\\", then another tranche was acquired by the State government for \\"soldier settlement\\", but Henry also acquired additional property: North Booborowie, near Burra, in partnership with John Melrose, and Koonowla orchard, on the road between Saddleworth and Auburn. When James Martin's engineering works in Gawler was liquidated in 1907, he purchased the business, and by enforcing some rationalization, kept the business viable within his lifetime, to the benefit of the town. See main article. He died after a few days' illness, diagnosed as having a blood clot on the brain. He was buried at Anlaby. Yacht Adele Dutton was a member of the Royal South Australian Yacht Squadron. His steam yacht Adele, built for him by Hawthorn and Co., Ltd., was one of the finest pleasure yachts in Australia. The yacht's dimensions were: :L.B.P. :L.W.L :Breadth moulded :Depth moulded :Tonnage The bulwarks were of steel, neatly paneled with teak and so arranged that they could be taken down when the yacht was laid up. Adele was fitted with steam and hand steering gear, teak and brass-mounted. The masts and bowsprit were of Oregon pine and the yacht was rigged as a schooner. There were eight cabins neatly paneled with polished hard woods, each containing lockers and drawers, dressing tables and wardrobes, and the wash basins had a hot and cold water supply. The guaranteed speed was 11.5 knots on a measured mile, and 11 knots for six hours. She carried four boats: :a 23 ft gig :an 18 ft cutter :a 14 ft dinghy :a 22 ft motor launch fitted with a Gardner engine and Gaines reversible propeller Henry Way Rymill, for many years Commodore of the R.S.A.Y.S., was a godson of Henry Dutton, and recalled cruising with Dutton on Adele for three months every year. Adele was also on the register of the Royal Yacht Squadron at Cowes, and as Dutton was a member of it, he had the right to fly the White Ensign. Other interests Henry Dutton was a devoted Anglican, and while a bank employee supported the local Church: while living in Brighton he was a warden at St Jude's Church, Brighton and often served as organist. In 1896 he built a small church in Hamilton, near Anlaby, dedicated to the memory of his uncle, his wife, and daughter. The church, though of austere Norman architecture externally, was elaborately fitted out inside, and furnished with a pipe organ built by Frederick Taylor. This instrument proved unreliable and its replacement, by J. E. Dodd, was installed in 1914, and first played by Dutton's daughter-in-law, Emily Dutton (n√©e Martin). Family Henry Dutton (1844 at Melbourne ‚Äì 25 or 26 August 1914 at Anlaby) married Helen Elizabeth Thomas (c. 1844 ‚Äì 8 October 1901) on 10 May 1873.

Constituted as forts Sommy and Saint-Blaise, the fortified group is part of the second fortified belt of forts of Metz. It had its baptism of fire in late 1944, when the Battle of Metz occurred.  Historical context  During the German annexation, Metz, will oscillate between a German garrison of between 15,000 and 20,000 men at the beginning of periodRen√© Bour, Histoire de Metz, 1950, p. 227. and will exceed 25,000 men just before the First World War,L‚ÄôExpress, no 2937, du 18 au 24 octobre 2007, dossier ¬´ Metz en 1900 ¬ª, Philippe Martin. gradually becoming the first stronghold of German Reich.Fran√ßois Roth : Metz annex√©e √† l‚ÄôEmpire allemand, in Fran√ßois-Yves Le Moigne, Histoire de Metz, Privat, Toulouse, 1986, (p. 350). The ' complete the Second fort belt around Metz composed of Festen Wagner (1904-1912), Crown Prince (1899 - 1905), Leipzig (1907‚Äì1912), empress (1899-1905), Lorraine (1899-1905), Freiherr von der Goltz (1907-1916), Haeseler (1899-1905), Prince Regent Luitpold (1907-1914) and Infantry-Werk Belle-Croix (1908-1914). Named in honor of Count Gottlieb von Haeseler, Commander XVIth Army Corps Metz, the Group Fortification was built on the right bank of the Moselle, south of Metz, between the villages of Corny-sur- Moselle and D'Augny. Complementary to the Feste Crown Prince, the ' controlled the Moselle valley, at the axis of the road and rail communication between Metz and Nancy. The fort was part of a wider program of fortifications called \\"Moselstellung\\" encompassing fortresses scattered between Thionville and Metz in the valley Moselle. The aim of Germany was to protect against a French attack to take back Alsace-Lorraine from the German Empire. The fortification system was designed to accommodate the growing advances in artillery since the end of XIXis century. Based on new defensive concepts, such as dispersal and concealment, the fortified group was to be, in case of attack, an impassable barrier for French forces.  Overall design  Protection of the perimeter of Verdun is provided by a set of infantry positions, fortified barracks and artillery batteries scattered over a wide area and concealed by the natural topography. From 1899, the Schlieffen plan of the German General Staff designed the fortifications of the Moselstellung, between Metz and Thionville to be like a lock for blocking any advance of French troops in case of conflict.Donnell Clayton, The German Fortress of Metz: 1870-1944, Oxford, Osprey, 2008, p. 24. This concept of a fortified line on the Moselle was a significant innovation compared to the syst√®me S√©r√© de Rivi√®res developed by the French. It later inspired the engineers of the Maginot Line.Donnell Clayton, The German Fortress of Metz: 1870-1944.  Construction and facilities  On May 9, 1899, Kaiser Wilhelm II laid the first stone of Fort St. Blaise. Group Fortification Verdun group is built on top of two hills, it consists of two forts, the fort Sommy 30 ha in the south, and Fort Saint- Blaise 45 ha on the north. Group Fortification Verdun has four 150mm howitzers and six short 100mm guns. Fort St. Blaise was planned for 500 men and fort Sommy for 200 men. It could then receive two infantry companies, in addition to the gunners. St. Blaise, whose fortified barracks could receive 500 people, has 10 observation domes and 12 lookout posts. The water tank's capacity was 1,300 m. 4 diesel engines of 25HP each, providing the energy necessary for Fort St. Blaise. The fort Sommy, including the fortified barracks, could accommodate 200 people, and has 6 observation domes and 8 lookouts. Its water tank could hold 600 m and it had 3 diesel engines of 20HP each, to provide the energy needed for its operation. The coat of arms of Count of Haeseler is carved on the pediment of the door of the fort.  Successive assignments  During The Annexation of the Alsace-Lorraine, the fort receives a garrison of gunners belonging to the XVIth Army Corps. From 1914-1918, it served as a relay for the German soldiers at the front. Its equipment and weapons are then at the forefront of military technology. In 1919, the fort was occupied by the French army. After the departure of French troops in June 1940, the German army reinvests the forts. In early September 1944, at the beginning of the Battle of Metz, the German command integrates the defensive system set up around Metz. Given the American \\"bridgehead\\" at Dornot, fierce fighting took place around the fort in September 1944. Currently, the fort is abandoned. The strong German has remarkable wall paintings prior to 1918.Alain Hohnadel, Jean-Louis Goby : La m√©moire des forts : peintures murales des soldats de la Ligne Maginot et des forts de Metz (1914-1940), √âditions Serpenoise, Metz, 1990.

In addition, the troops of the 462th Infanterie-Division and the Fahnenjunker of the officers school of MetzFahnenjunkerschule VI des Heeres ‚ÄúMetz‚Äù: School of Metz officers, under the command of SS Colonel Joachim von Siegroth (1800 Flags Junkers). know well the terrain.Ren√© Caboz, La bataille de Metz, √âditions Pierron, Sarreguemines, 1984, p. 182. The fighting around the two fortified groups will take place from 7 September 1944 to 11 December 1944, under extreme conditions. On September 8, 1944 3rd Battalion 11th Infantry Regiment of the US Army aims to take the Group Fortification Verdun, which is the forts St. Blaise and Sommy.Ren√© Caboz, La bataille de Metz. 25 ao√ªt - 15 septembre 1944, Sarreguemines, 1984, p. 205-215 et carte p. 368. The fort is only bound by an officer and six men of the Nachrichtenschule der Waffen-SS.School of transmissions of the Waffen-ss Metz, under the command of SS Colonel Ernst Kemper. A rolling artillery barrage prepares the ground for US assault troops, who encountered little resistance. Under fire of artillery, the section of the 462 Infanterie-Division, which has the defense of the sector, withdraws, in effect, cautiously to the northward direction to Frescaty. After a final shootoutGermans were finished by the GIs, in retaliation, when American officers was fatally wounded. The company F of 11th Infantry Regiment reached the ditches of the fort, protected by insurmountable harrows. The Germans seem to have deserted the sector, where an eerie silence now falls flat. Not knowing what to expect, the American captain of the company F requests a preventative artillery shelling of the fort. But the first three rounds are fired too short, making several deaths and injuries among his own ranks, and the following salvos fall on a deserted fort. Immediately after, mortars and machine guns of the 37th SS Panzer Grenadier Regiment of the famous 17th SS- Panzergrenadier division, just having arrived in the area, were unleashed on the western slope of the Group Fortification, hitting the rear of the two American companies. Sections of Assault 2nd US battalion must then fall back on the position of Horseshoe from Dornot under murderous cross fire. At 22:00, the 6th the company of the 37th SS Panzer Grenadier Regiment managed to regain possession of Fort St. Blaise, under a deluge of fire. When the morning comes, the losses are already heavy in both armies. On September 9, 1944, General Kraus reassigns no less than 1,000 soldiers of the 37th SS Panzer Grenadier Regiment,Questionable estimate from a German prisoner belonging to this unit during interrogation. to the defense of the Group Fortification Verdun, facing the bridgehead of Dornot. On the September 10, 1944, to cover the American retreat on Dornot, P-47s, from 23rd Squadron 36th Bomber Group XIXth TAC , dropp no less than 23 225 kg bombs and 12 115 kg bombsRen√© Caboz, La bataille de Metz. 25 ao√ªt - 15 septembre 1944, Sarreguemines, 1984, p. 267-268. on forts Sommy and Saint-Blaise which literally bury the German grenadiers. They destroy with a hit the turret of a 150mm gun, but the superstructure of the fort is relatively unscathed. Despite the incendiary bombs and deadly shelling of the US Army, German troops still firmly hold the position. To secure the area and contain the German troops in the strongholds of the fortified line West of Metz von Gallwitz, a military operation is mounted in the following days by the US military. The operation Thunderbolt, coordinating a combined attack on the ground and in the air, is scheduled for Sept. 17, 1944. On September 26, bombers of the 19th Tactical Air Force conduct an air strike on the forts of Metz, dropping bombs of 500 kg napalm.1944-1945 : Les ann√©es Libert√©, le R√©publicain Lorrain, Metz 1994, p. 30. The concrete and buried fortifications are resistant to this air attack. Before September 30, 1944, two new air raids will prove ineffective to dislodge the German soldiers who are holed up during the raids, and return to their battle stations immediately after. For a long month, the besieged soldiers will remain in their posts, with discipline and resignation, pending a final US attack that will not come. The Americans, having drawn the consequences of their failure before the Group Fortification Driant have effectively renounced taking the forts west of Metz by frontal assault. General Patton, poorly digesting this failure, demanded each day for Bomber Command air raids on the forts, for \\" paving hell with those dirty bastards Germans \\".Jean Colin (g√©n√©ral), Contribution √† l‚Äôhistoire de la lib√©ration de la ville de Metz ; Les combats du fort Driant (Septembre- D√©cembre 1944), p. 14. The weather decided otherwise. The \\"revenge\\" operation finally was born, shortly before the fall of Metz. As a prelude to the offensive on the city, the Air Force sent, on November 9, 1944, no less than 1,299 heavy bombers, B-17s and B-24s, to drop 3,753 tons of bombs, and 1,000 to 2,000 books on fortifications and strategic points in the combat zone of IIIrd army.G√©n√©ral Jean Colin, Contribution √† l‚Äôhistoire de la lib√©ration de la ville de Metz ; Les combats du fort Driant (septembre-d√©cembre 1944), Acad√©mie nationale de Metz, 1963, p. 13. Most bombers, having dropped bombs without visibility at over 20,000 feet, miss their military targets. In Metz, the 689 loads of bombs dropped over the seven forts of Metz, designated as priority targets, did nothing but cause collateral damage, proving once again the inadequacy of the massive bombing of military targets.Hugh M. Cole, The Lorraine Campaign, Center of Military History, Washington, 1950, p. 424. After a rapid progression during the night of 16 to 17 November 1944, the 3rd Battalion 11th Infantry Regiment encircles the fortified group, forcing its defenders to hide in bunkers and underground.Hugh M. Cole, The Lorraine Campaign, Center of Military History, Washington, 1950, p. 442. While city messine fell to the Allies, November 22, 1944 at 14:35, the connections between the forts and the Metz command post are permanently cut. The forts, surrounded by 9 000 GIs, no longer communicate with each other. Locked in their bunkers, soldiers of the 462th Volksgrenadier Division can only rely on themselves. Short of food and ammunition, old Feste Haeseler surrenders on November 26, 1944 in the morning.¬´ En finir avec les forts autour de Metz ¬ª, dans 1944-1945 : Les ann√©es Libert√©, le R√©publicain Lorrain, Metz, 1994, p. 42. Two officers and 148 troops come out, physically nervous and exhausted. Once in place, US troops are eager to hoist their flag atop the fort, under the flashes of the military photographers, definitely wanting to forget the humiliating defeat of Dornot. The fort Jeanne-d‚ÄôArc was the last of the forts of Metz to disarm, December 13, 1944. Determined German resistance, bad weather and floods, inopportunity, and a general tendency to underestimate the firepower of the fortifications of Metz, have helped slow the US offensive, giving the opportunity to the German Army withdraw in good order to the Saar.Hugh M. Cole, The Lorraine Campaign, Center of Military History, Washington, 1950, p. 448. The objective of the German staff, which was to stall US troops at Metz for the longest possible time before they could reach the front of the Siegfried Line, is largely achieved.

KNITRO ‚Äì (the original solver name) short for \\"Nonlinear Interior point Trust Region Optimization\\" (the \\"K\\" is silent) ‚Äì was co-created by Richard Waltz, Jorge Nocedal, Todd Plantenga and Richard Byrd. It was first introduced in 2001, as a derivative of academic research at Northwestern University (through Ziena Optimization LLC), and has since been continually improved by developers at Artelys. Optimization problems must be presented to Knitro in mathematical form, and should provide a way of computing function derivatives using sparse matrices (Knitro can compute derivatives approximation but in most cases providing the exact derivatives is beneficial). An often easier approach is to develop the optimization problem in an algebraic modeling language. The modeling environment computes function derivatives, and Knitro is called as a \\"solver\\" from within the environment. Problem classes solved by Artelys Knitro Knitro is specialized for nonlinear optimization but also solves a wide range of optimization problems: * General nonlinear problems (NLP), including non- convex * Systems of nonlinear equations * Linear problems (LP) * Quadratic problems (QP/QCQP/SOCP), both convex and non-convex * Least squares problems / regression, both linear and nonlinear * Mathematical programs with complementarity constraints (MPCC/MPEC) * Mixed-integer nonlinear problems (MIP/MINLP) * Derivative-free optimization problems (DFO) Algorithms Artelys Knitro contains a wide range of optimization algorithms. NonLinear Programming (NLP) solver Knitro offers four different optimization algorithms for solving optimization problems.Artelys Knitro NLP algorithms Two algorithms are of the interior point type, and two are of the active set type. These algorithms are known to have fundamentally different characteristics; for example, interior point methods follow a path through the interior of the feasible region while active set methods tend to stay at the boundaries. Knitro provides both types of algorithm for greater flexibility in solving problems, and allows crossover during the solution process from one algorithm to another. The code also provides a multistart option for promoting the computation of the global minimum. * Interior/Direct algorithm * Interior/Conjugate Gradient algorithm * Active Set algorithm * Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) algorithm Mixed-Integer NonLinear Programming (MINLP) solver Knitro provides tools for solving optimization models (both linear and nonlinear) with binary or integer variables.

The Llanbeblig Book of Hours is an illuminated manuscript in the National Library of Wales (NLW MS 17520A) that dates from the close of the fourteenth century. Entries in the Calendar link the Llanbeblig Hours to Wales and more specifically the dedication of the church of Saint Peblig, which is marked June 6th, connects it with Caernarfon. A rare Lily Crucifixion motif is one of the seven illuminated miniatures in this Book of Hours. The Lily Crucifixion miniature is discussed in the context of other examples of the motif in devotional iconography in an NLW journal article by Eddie Duggan. Even though neither the miniatures nor the decorated borders and initial letters are of any great artistic merit, this manuscript is of interest as it is one of the few examples of an illuminated manuscript that is linked to Wales.  Binding  The early sixteenth century gold-tooled calf covers of the Llanbeblig Hours, which both bear the arms of King Henry VIII and Katherine of Aragon in shields separated by two roses, are inlaid in the nineteenth century binding. The binding was thus executed before the 1532 annulment of King Henry's marriage to Katherine of Aragon.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001 as Commercial Hotel. The hotel opened in 1906 as the Commercial Hotel. It is actually a combination of two buildings. with The older section is at the end of the building in the middle of the block. It was built as a school in 1853 and served that purpose until 1879. In 1887 the second floor became the law office of F. W. Tatlock, and he rented out the first floor. Gus Tiemeyer bought the building in 1901 and operated a livery stable, which was located on the corner where the newer section of the building stands. Wapello had one good hotel and the Traveling Man's Hotel served that purpose until it was destroyed in a fire in 1905. Wapello architect and contractor H. O. Pease designed the hotel wing. It, like the older school building, is two stories tall. The two buildings are joined with a door into the hallway of the hotel wing. The hotel wing is an L-shaped frame structure covered with a brick veneer and capped with a hip roof. It originally had a wraparound porch on the first floor. It was replaced with the present two-story porch, possibly in the late 1930s. The inside originally housed 21 sleeping rooms, a lobby, office, dining room, kitchen, pantry, storeroom, laundry, and sample room. It was subsequently converted into 12 sleeping rooms, each with their own bathroom. The former dining room and kitchen area were converted into an apartment.

Distinguished Professor Moreton-Robinson developed a masterclass for Indigenous postgraduate students. The program is designed to build research skills and to improve the completion rates of Indigenous researchers. The Indigenous Research Methodologies Masterclass is the only Indigenous-designed and evidence-based model contributing to closing the education gap in Australia.  Major Contributions to Theory  Moreton-Robinson's research and writing has focused on the experience of Aboriginal Australians since colonial settlement and issues of race and Whiteness studies, post-colonialism, women's studies and indigenous feminism, indigenous studies, native title law and Aboriginal land rights. Moreton-Robinson through her series of journal articles which where complied to create the book \\"The White Possessive\\" is considered to have made a significant contribution to the field of Indigenous Studies.

It was released on 6 November 2015, nine months after the death of lead vocalist Steve Strange.  Background  Work began on the album in 2014. During a break in the recording, vocalist Steve Strange died while on holiday in Egypt in February 2015, though several tracks had already been written and recorded by this time including a cover of David Bowie's 1985 hit \\"Loving the Alien\\". The track \\"Become\\" was written by former Visage member Midge Ure, with Ure's original version first appearing on his 2014 album Fragile. The track \\"Star City\\" was co-written by Didier Marouani of the French electro band Space (most notable for their 1970s hit \\"Magic Fly\\"). In the months following Strange's death, the remaining members of Visage decided to complete the album. Strange's family and friends then formed The Steve Strange Collective, \\"a foundation to promote and celebrate the legacy of Steve Strange and the organisations and causes he was involved with.\\" The organisation states that all royalties from the album will go to the Steve Strange Statue Fund, which is raising money to have a memorial bronze statue of Strange made and sited in his hometown in Wales. The album's cover photograph was by Boy George (credited as \\"Rude George\\"), who had known Strange since the late 1970s. Rather than release any singles from the album, the band decided to release a companion album called Darkness To Diamond in early 2016. It features remixes and alternate versions of the ten songs from Demons To Diamonds, and the first ever external remix made by Visage of a song called \\"Heartbleed\\" by James Grant, former frontman of the 80s band Love and Money. The song began life when Visage approached Grant to collaborate on songwriting with them, and he was sent a set of lyrics written by Steve Strange which Grant then expanded upon. However, by the time the song was written, Strange had died and never recorded his vocals for the track. The song was ultimately performed by Grant.James Grant Official Facebook page  Release  Demons to Diamonds was released on 6 November 2015.

It is the first open charitable gTLD and its ICANN designation states that the domain's operator is precluded from making a profit. Funds raised from .hiv domain sales will initially benefit projects to increase access to HIV/AIDS treatment in Rwanda, South Africa, Turkey, and the United States. History .hiv has been called the \\"red ribbon for the digital age\\", referring to the awareness ribbon. The top-level domain (TLD) was inspired by an anti-HIV/AIDS campaign by thjnk, a German advertising agency. A group of co-founders, including charity-experienced Carolin Silbernagl, thjnk's co-owner Michael Trautmann and creative director Philipp Kafkoulas, established dotHIV gemeinn√ºtziger e.V. as a charitable association and applied for the .hiv TLD. Despite the global relevance of HIV/AIDS, dotHIV was the only applicant for the .hiv TLD. The charity signed a registration contract with ICANN in March 2014. Domains were made available for select companies and individuals during the July \\"sunrise\\" period, becoming generally available in August 2014. hiv became the first open charitable TLD and, according to one press release, \\"opens up a dedicated namespace that brings website owners together behind one goal: The end of AIDS\\". In September 2015, dotHIV and Cayman Islands-based domain company Uniregistry jointly announced Uniregistry's acquisition of .hiv and accompanying plan to complete the change in ownership before World AIDS Day on December 1, 2015. One announcement read, \\"Today, Uniregistry takes over the lead in this unique journey to use a top-level domain to promote a social good. The dotHIV charity will continue its work for .hiv and focus on community support. The creative agency thjnk from Hamburg, Germany, longstanding partner of the initiative, will continue to work on behalf of the .hiv top-level domain, exploring new and existing opportunities for social change.\\" Uniregistry's acquisition of .hiv came after a planned auction for the gTLD was cancelled when no companies signed up to participate. The cancelled auction's reserve price had been $200,000. The price ultimately paid by Uniregistry in the private deal was not publicly disclosed. Model and donation recipients The contract for .hiv with ICANN does not allow the extension operator to make a profit on the TLD. Before Uniregistry took over, visits to .hiv domains (even redirected ones) generated small donations of approximately one-tenth of a cent, made from dotHIV's general fund to a project fund. The company's general fund was the result of .hiv domain sales, which retailed for 150 euros. dotHIV hoped to direct 70 percent of its income from domain sales to the general fund. Domain sales also funded dotHIV's operations and the debt required to finance the .hiv application process and subsequent launch. According to Slate, dotHIV planned to reimburse \\"zero- or low-interest loans provided by business angels and the technology development fund of the city-state of Berlin that have allowed the charity to operate so far\\". Nonprofit organizations in the HIV/AIDS field are eligible to receive .hiv domains at no cost. .hiv's launch has been called \\"one of the strangest and riskiest business models of any new gTLD to date\\". Uniregistry has said it will continue to operate the extension using the same model as dotHIV for the immediate future. dotHIV identified four initial projects to support; they are located in Rwanda (We-ActsX), South Africa, Turkey, and the United States, and focus on patient access to HIV/AIDS treatment. The company intended to let .hiv domain owners vote on which projects to support in the future. Domains In 2014, Trautmann announced that 10,000 requests for .hiv domains were made (which would result in US$200 million in annual income if all domains were sold and purchased at the 150 euro price). Bono's Product Red organization was the first .hiv domain launched during the extension's \\"sunrise\\" period in July 2014. Amazon.com, BMW, Gilead Sciences, Instagram, LinkedIn, Paulaner Brewery, Plus.de, POZ, Samsung, Sixt, TED, Tumblr, and Wired have also purchased .hiv domains. In April 2014, when dotHIV put its contract with ICANN up for auction, there were 345 paid registrations generating $83,000 in revenue. According to Domain Name Wire, there were 500 .hiv registrations in the zone file in September 2015. Reception Prior to .hiv's transition to Uniregistry, Slate Marc Naimark contrasted the gTLD with the Product Red campaign. He was more critical of the latter, saying it \\"reinforces consumerism\\" and functions more as a public relations strategy for participating brands. He wrote: > Reaching the coffee chain's website by using starbucks.hiv does not provide > quite the same visibility for consumers as (RED) products, since it lacks > the public broadcasting tote-bag effect. But dotHIV does offer real benefits > in terms of action. The money is already in the bank, thanks to the sale of > .hiv domains. The projects benefiting from the funding are small in scale > and are clearly indicated on the dotHIV website. As operations continue, the > outcomes of these specific projects will become clearer than those offered > by the bulk funding of the Global Fund. Companies can use their .hiv domain > as a landing page to provide further information. And nonprofits will > benefit from a free domain name to showcase their actions in the fight > against HIV/AIDS. Because funds are released only when .hiv websites are > visited, all website owners have an incentive to promote their .hiv domain > names, enhancing the 'red ribbon' effect.

Most tornadoes form in the U.S., although some events may take place internationally. Tornado statistics for older years like this often appear significantly lower than modern years due to fewer reports or confirmed tornadoes. Synopsis Numbers for 1977 were below average, both in terms of number of tornadoes and number of fatalities; however, there were over 700 injuries related to tornadoes. Events January 5 tornadoes were reported in the U.S. in January. February 17 tornadoes were reported in the U.S. in February. March 64 tornadoes were reported in the U.S. in March. March 28 A small, widespread tornado outbreak caused an F2 tornado to strike the University of Southern Mississippi in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. Another F2 struck the downtown area of Lafayette, Louisiana. An F3 struck 5 to 10 houses northwest of Camden, Mississippi. Overall, there were only 10 injures, but no fatalities. April 88 tornadoes were reported in the U.S. in April. April 4‚Äì5 A violent F5 tornado struck the Smithfield, Alabama area in Northern Birmingham, sweeping away many homes and killing 22 people. The damage in Birmingham was so severe that when Ted Fujita flew over the damage and toyed with rating the tornado an F6.It was the most severe tornado of a large outbreak of 21 tornadoes that extended from Mississippi to North Carolina, with several strong tornadoes documented. An F3 tornado also struck the Lindale, Georgia area, where 12 trailers were completely swept away off their foundations, killing one person. The storm system also caused the crash of Southern Airways Flight 242 in Georgia, which killed 72 and injured 22. May 228 tornadoes were reported in the U.S. in May. May 4‚Äì5 A low-pressure system swept across the Great Plains and Great Lakes regions, producing 3 F4 tornadoes: two in Missouri and one in Atlanta, Illinois. An F3 hit Harrisonville, Missouri. Overall, there were no fatalities, but several injuries. May 16‚Äì21 A tornado near Shamrock, Texas on May 16, 1977. A very large tornado outbreak moved across Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas. This outbreak included one of the strongest tornadoes ever in the Oklahoma Panhandle, a long track F4 tornado which struck the small town of Keyes, Oklahoma and tracked into Baca County, Colorado, where it dissipated. An F2 tornado touched down in Moore, Oklahoma and moved through Oklahoma City. An F3 touched down very close to the Altus, Oklahoma AFB. A long track F2 tornado touched down near Elkhart, Kansas before continuing striking the eastern fridges of Ulysses, Kansas damaging several farms before tracking into the east side of Garden City, Kansas where more damage was noted before dissipating in northern Finney Countyafter traveling 117 miles though it may have been a tornado family. June 132 tornadoes were reported in the U.S. in June. July 99 tornadoes were reported in the U.S. in July. August 82 tornadoes were reported in the U.S. in August. August 21 An F3 tornado killed 6 and injured 56 in Neoga, Illinois. September 65 tornadoes were reported in the U.S. in September. October 25 tornadoes were reported in the U.S. in October.

Antagonists  Dark Magicians The are the main antagonists of the first half of the series, whose goal is to acquire the Linkle Stone Emerald so their leader Dokuroxy can conquer the Magic World and the No Magic World with his dark magic. They also want the Linkle Smarthon after discovering Ha-chan's power. With the exception of Dokuroxy, his subordinates were originally animals which he infused with his magic to assume humanoid form and act in his stead due to his physical condition. =Leaders= ; : (Kushi) :The main antagonist in the first half of the series and leader of Dark Magicians, a power-hungry skeleton magician with great magical prowess yet is firmly stationed on his throne due to his ailing physical constitution. Dokuroxy rarely moves or talks with Yamoh the only one to interpret his body movements as commands. In truth, Kushi was originally a Magic School school teacher who a close friend of the Headmaster before obsession in studying magic to prevent a great calamity resulted in him turning to the dark arts which reduced his body into a skeleton with a desire to obtain the Linkle Stone Emerald to dominate the world. :After obtaining the Linkle Stone Emerald and Smartbook, he absorbs their powers to transform into a giant demonic skeleton to fight the Pretty Cure. Yamoh begged him to be absorbed as well, to strengthen him, but even this action could not overpower Pretty Cure. Kushi's spirit leaves his body as it breaks apart, Yamoh using the remains to create a more powerful Yokubal. :As a skeleton, his mostly passive role makes his personality hard to describe, but his actions sometimes remind of his past kindness. He gave animals the gift of magic, making them able to become powerful magicians on their own. He also kept a photo of the Headmaster and himself in the book of dark magic that he wrote. Finally, his ghost returned to the effigy Yamoh made of him, aiding his subordinates in battle once more, then disappearing for good. ; : :A humanoid gecko and Dokuroxy's second-in-command. An eccentric short-sized clairvoyant, his fancy garments and curly white hair remind of western fashion in the period 1700‚Äì1750. He can predict using his cauldron. He is in charge of leading the others under Dokuroxy's order, and can interpret Dokuroxy's body movements. He often worries about Dokuroxy's health, and wants nothing more than his master succeeding in his goals. :He was absorbed by Dokuroxy during Dokuroxy's final fight with Pretty Cure, but lost his tail before. Out of the remains of the tail, he was revived by Labut with a slightly altered appearance - his garments are simpler, darker in colour and his hair is loose. Appalled by Dokuroxy's demise, he uses Dokuroxy's bones to creates stronger Yokubal and seeks revenge. He also makes an effigy of Dokuroxy and reports his progress to it. He uses Dokuroxy's last bone to fuse himself into a Yokubal to capture Kotoha, and thus, the Linkle Stone Emerald. But he ends up defeated as well, and becomes a regular gecko again. Even in this moment, he seeks the company of the effigy. He shows up together with the effigy and along with the rest of his group is fused into a Yokubal by Batty to fight Oruba's Don Yokubal. After this, he left together with Batty, still in his animal form. :He was restored back into his humanoid form by his love for his master after witnessing his return, or so it seems. The last remaining bone of Dokurokushe was the tooth Yamoh pulled out a long time ago after it had a cavity. The spirit remaining in the tooth revived into an entity who loves sweets and resembles the effigy Yamoh created. Chikurun supports Yamoh by supplying him with honey to make this version of Dokurokushe happy. =Subordinates= ; : :A polite humanoid bat dressed up in formal attire, with a long cape that allows him to fly. He deems Yamoh suspicious and accuses him of making up his orders. Dokuroxy then finally talks to Batty and powers him up, and he becomes highly loyal towards Dokuroxy and is depressed due to not being able to protect his master, calling himself a failure. Batty is attentive to his teammates, observing their respective final fights and taking them to their lair when they reverted to their animal forms. Spalda and Gamets, in their animal forms, lend him their wands to transform him into a powerful monster, and after his defeat he still keeps his humanoid form. When he tries to grab the Linkle Stone Emerald, its extracted his magic and reverted him to his original state before being found Spalda and restored to his human form by Oruba. But Batty, feeling depressed, does not want to fight anymore. When Oruba mocks dark magic, he gets fired up again and defeats Oruba's Don Yokubal with a Yokubal combined from all his friends. He then leaves with them. Following Deusmast's death, he started to enroll at the Magic School. ; : :A cunning tactician and humanoid spider, who uses webs to snatch objects and for combat purposes. She is very direct and somewhat rude in personality. She loves dark magic and is the most invested in Dokurokuxy's idea of a world ruled by it. Spalda experiments with her magic, including living beings in it at times and pioneering fusing oneself into Yokubal. While a tactician, her decisions are reckless, as the Yokubal fusion ended up hurting her and she struggled to control it. Pretty Cure defeated her in this form, and she becomes a regular spider. She was taken home by Batty. :Later in the series, Oruba, seeking to learn more about dark magic, gave her back her humanoid form. She seemingly acts as his loyal servant, but it turns out to be a ploy to resurrect her teammates and steal Dokuroxy's book from Oruba. Oruba turns her back into a regular spider, but she becomes part of a Yokubal fusion that defeats Oruba's Don Yokubal. After that, she leaves with Batty and the others. ; : :A humanoid turtle and strong soldier, dubbing himself a magic warrior instead of a magician. He dresses up like a Roman legionary and seeks fights like with the Precure mainly to test his strength. He stole the Linkle Stone Garnet and uses a secret magic to make himself very tall and more nimble, bursting his shell in the process. In this form, he challenged the Cures to fight him on a remote island. Following his defeat, he is satisfied by his defeat as he reverts to his original state. After being revived by Oruba, Spalda goads Gamets into standing against Pretty Cure by using group's third member as incentive. He is angry at Oruba and tries to fight him together with Spalda when Oruba interrupts this \\"sacred battle\\" with Cure Felice. He is turned back into a regular turtle and becomes part of the Yokubal fusion that defeats Oruba's Don Yokubal. After that, he leaves with Batty and the others.

The punt operated until 1935. Alfred Burton noted: \\"Upokongaro boasts a church with a three-sided spire something like a bayonet.\\" Upokongaro or ≈™pokongaro is a settlement upriver from Whanganui, New Zealand, in the Makirikiri Valley. Settled by Europeans in the 1860s, it was an important ferry crossing and riverboat stop. A spectacular discovery of moa bones was made in the area in the 1930s.  MƒÅori history  The village's name in MƒÅori, ≈´poko (head) ngaro (hidden), refers to a story of how chief's daughter Ira-nga-rangi arranged to have her head removed upon her death and hidden by relatives, who feared it might be desecrated by enemies. Supposedly the preserved head was hidden in a cave on the banks of the ≈™pokongaro Stream north of the settlement, from which the village takes its name. At the time of European contact, both ≈™pokongaro and adjacent settlements Waipakura and Kukuta were home to the NgƒÅti Patutokotoko hap≈´ of the iwi Te ƒÄti Haunui-a- PƒÅpƒÅrangi. NgƒÅti Iringirangi and Nga Paerangi are also noted as being present. The fortified hilltop pƒÅ at ≈™pokongaro was called Opiu; during the tense times of the 1840s, Opiu was pulled down and abandoned. Waipakura, south of ≈™pokongaro, was one of a number of native reserves set aside in the 1848 Deed of Sale; some of it was leased to settlers in the 1860s. ≈™pokongaro was described as a \\"small pƒÅ\\" in 1865, and MƒÅori settlement persisted until at least the 1880s. The pƒÅ site at Opiu was used as a refuge for settlers' wives and children in 1862, when there were fears of Hau Hau war parties, and was later turned into a redoubt.  European settlement  In 1866, settler John Kennedy built a hotel and a store (later the post office); during the 1870s and '80s, the local name for ≈™pokongaro was \\"Kennedy's\\". A school was built in 1870, known from 1873‚Äì1879 as the North Makirikiri or \\"River Bank\\" school. The schoolroom functioned for Anglican services in the mid 1870s, but in 1877 St Mary's Anglican Church was built. Designed by local architect Edward Morgan and built by John Randal, St Mary's is distinctive in having a spire with a triangular cross-section, on a four-sided steeple. Its stained glass window was installed in 1879, in memory of Archibald Montgomery, a young Upokongaro man lost in the sinking of the clipper Avalanche in the English Channel just before the church was completed. St Mary's is the oldest church in the Whanganui District on its original site.  Moa discovery  In the 1930s, thousands of moa bones were recovered from mud springs in the Upokongaro Valley at Makirikiri by a Wanganui Museum expedition.

The Art Deco hotel was built in the 1930s, and was opened in November 1947. It is regarded as one of the top hotels in Malta. The hotel had one of the earliest restaurants of good standards in Malta in the 1950s. It had three floors originally, but further floors were built along the years. Location The Phoenicia Malta is located just outside the capital city of Valletta, close to the Triton Fountain and City Gate. It was built upon a place-of-arms which was part of the outworks of the fortifications of Valletta.

However noting materialised until after WWI. In February 1923, the Minister for Public Works Antonio Dalli discreetly received a written proposal, by Antonio Cassar Torregiani, for the site to be leased to him in order to build a hotel.

In October 1924, under the new Minister for Public Works Giovanni Adami, a public notice was issued for numerous projects in the surrounding of the entrance from and to Valletta, including the building of a 200 beds modern style hotel. The tender was open to the public with strict guidelines for eligibility under British conditions. Maltese architects protested against the inclusion of British architects for local projects, something which was discussed in the Maltese National Assembly. The Prime Minister Gerald Strickland and his wife Margaret were the minds behind the Valletta entrance project. The government leased the land for the hotel for 150 years. The intention was to have a place where European dignitaries could stay in the best of comfort in the centre of the island. For this reason, the outer glacis of the fortifications was identified as an ideal site. Construction The project began in 1935, and a year later, the Scottish architect William Binnie was commissioned to design the building. Construction began soon after, and it was almost complete by 1939. With the outbreak of World War II, the finished parts of the hotel were requisitioned by the British military to be used by the Royal Air Force personnel. On 27 April 1942, the hotel suffered extensive damage when it was hit by aerial bombardment. Reconstruction of the damaged parts began in 1944, and was fully complete in April 1948. In use and refurbishments The hotel officially opened on 3 November 1947. The opening ceremony was attended by Lady Margaret Strickland, Archbishop Mikiel Gonzi and Governor Francis Campbell. Some of the official functions relating to Malta's independence in 1964 were held at the Phoenicia. The hotel was acquired by Charles Forte in 1966, and it was refurbished between 1968 and 1970. Further modifications, including the construction of an additional floor, were made between 1990 and 1994. Under restoration and construction of further floors On 8 November 1997, the hotel was rebranded as Le M√©ridien Phoenicia, following Forte's acquisition of Le M√©ridien. It was put on sale in late 2006, and was purchased by the Irish company Heuston Hospitality in 2007, who renamed the hotel back to Phoenicia Hotel Malta. In June 2014 the hotel was purchased by Hazeldane Group. The hotel was closed during a ‚Ç¨15 million restoration and refurbishment. The refurbishment was expected to be complete by March 2016, but works were ready by 2018. At this point it was reopened. Throughout the years, the Phoenicia has hosted a number of distinguished guests, including Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Philip, Edwina Mountbatten, Alec Guinness, Jeffrey Hunter, G√©rard Depardieu, Oliver Reed, Derek Jacobi, Joaquin Phoenix and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Architecture Main entrance to Hotel Phoenicia The Phoenicia Malta is an example of Art Deco architecture. It is built in Maltese limestone and has a number of elements typical of Maltese architecture. The building has a chevron shape, with a central circular Palm Court Hall giving on to the restaurant and then the terrace. Its grounds contain extensive gardens, amounting to some 7¬Ω acres. It overlooks the bastion walls of Valletta. The building is scheduled by the Malta Environment and Planning Authority.

Djon djon are often served with rice and a meat such as pork, or fish.

The company also created Buenos Aires' first underground tram line, which would go on to become Line A of the Buenos Aires Underground and owned other tramways around the country. History The company was founded in 1876 by British and Anglo-Argentine investors in order to acquire the existing Buenos Aires tramway network, within the context of the country's belle epoque, where it was receiving significant investments from foreign companies.Foreign Business-Host Government Relations: The Anglo Argentine Tramways Co. Ltd. of Buenos Aires, 1930‚Äì1966 (abstract) - Research Institute for History, March 1995. By the turn of the century, the company owned a significant number of tramways throughout Argentina, most notably the Buenos Aires and Rosario Tramways. In Rosario the company opened its first line in 1886 and later bought five of the local tramway companies, while operating of lines there through concession.Historia del tranv√≠a en Rosario - Tranvia del Bicentenario. Purchase by Sofina Stock certificate written in both English and French, showing the Argentine Congress. in 1898 the Belgian company Sofina began acquiring shares in the AATC at a time when the company was electrifying its Buenos Aires network, where the company owned of lines by this point, as well as the electrification of the Rosario network, which was completed in 1908. By 1907, Sofina created a new company Compagnie G√©n√©rale de Tramways de Buenos Aires to absorb the Anglo-Argentine and purchase other companies in the city and already by 1909 it had become the largest transport company in Argentina. The newly formed company's shareholders were made up of a number of different nationalities and included prominent European investment banks such as Paribas and Deutsche Bank. Line A Argentine officials alongside Samuel Hale Pearson at the inauguration of Line A. Construction of Line A of the Buenos Aires Underground began on 15 September 1911, with the German company Philipp Holzmann being contracted by the AATC to undergo the works.Justo Solsona y Carlos Hunter (1990).

The original Anglo-Argentine line ran underground from Plaza de Mayo in central Buenos Aires to the neighbourhood of Caballito, where it continued above-ground tram services through an access ramp at Primera Junta station, which also provided access to the company's main workshop and storage area at the Polvor√≠n Workshop. The workshop operates to this day (albeit in a more minor role) and was built in 1914 to service the line's La Brugeoise and UEC Preston rolling stock.El Taller Polvor√≠n, centro de la historia del Subte - EnElSubte, 30 November 2013. Demise By 1938, the company (light blue) owned most of the lines in Buenos Aires. In the years following the formation of the Compagnie G√©n√©rale de Tramways de Buenos Aires, the came to own the vast majority of the Buenos Aires tram network, with the exception of a few Argentine companies such as the Lacroze Company's Tramway Rural. However, increased competition from bus travel and the construction of new lines for the Buenos Aires Underground, anti-monopoly laws and a devaluation of the Argentine peso all meant that the AATC was in an increasingly difficult situation by 1930. By 1936, the company's accumulated losses had reached ¬£2.5 million (around ¬£92 million in 2005 money) while the company was facing serious competition from the Compa√±√≠a Hispano Argentina de Obras P√∫blicas y Finanzas (CHADOPyF, Hispanic-Argentine Company for Public Works and Finances), which had recently completed Line C and was close to completing Line D. That same year, the government of Buenos Aires also began to organise public transport under a large mixed holding company known as the Corporation for Urban Transport (Corporacion de Transportes Urbanos) which was put into effect in 1938. The AATC remained largely independent, however in the post-war period, the political climate in Argentina had changed significantly and under the leadership of Juan Peron, the country's railways had been nationalised in 1948. That same year, the Argentine National Congress approved a law which would see the nationalisation of Buenos Aires' public transport in the shortest possible time frame. In 1951, a large portion of the Corporation for Urban Transport was bought up by the state for AR$400 million, while the corporation had already accumulated debts with the state worth AR$2 billion. All of the corporation's assets were then transferred over to the state in January 1952. The AATC's shareholders did not recognise the purchase and - together with the Corporation for Urban Transport's other shareholders - made the British ambassador to Argentine intervene on numerous occasions. Argentina and the United Kingdom then reached an agreement in December 1952 to resolve the matter of the transferral of assets quickly, however this would turn out to be fruitless. The conflict ensued until 1963 when it was ultimately taken to the Buenos Aires Court of Appeals, which recognised that the Argentine state was partly responsible for the loss of capital of the foreign shareholders. Legacy Refurbished Brugeoise car. Though the Buenos Aires tramway network ceased widespread operations in the 1960s, along with the other cities in which the AATC operated, many remnants of the original company can still be seen. In Buenos Aires, the Polvor√≠n Workshop still functions as the maintenance area for Line A of the Buenos Aires Underground, and is currently being put out of use and converted into a museum for the network. The original Brugeoise cars are being restored to run tourist services on Line A and to be exhibited in different museums around the country.Puesta a punto de los hist√≥ricos vagones de la l√≠nea A, La Naci√≥n newspaper, 21 January 2009 (In Spanish‚ÄîHistory includes vintage photos and video) ‚Äì Retrieved 2009-02-04 Meanwhile, the UEC Preston cars belonging to the company are used on Buenos Aires' heritage tramway, which runs in the neighbourhood of Caballito using parts of the AATC's original route.Exhibieron la dupla hist√≥rica Preston para festejar el Bicentenario - EnElSubte, 26 May 2010.

Many species of Staphylinidae (commonly known as ‚Äúrove beetles‚Äù) have developed complex interspecies relationships with ants, known as myrmecophily. Rove Beetles are among the most rich and diverse families of myrmecophilous beetles, with a wide variety of relationships with ants. Ant associations range from near free-living species which prey only on ants, to obligate inquilines of ants, which exhibit extreme morphological and chemical adaptations to the harsh environments of ant nests. Some species are fully integrated into the host colony, and are cleaned and fed by ants. Many of these, including species in tribe Clavigerini, are myrmecophagous, placating their hosts with glandular secretions while eating the broodLapeva-Gjonova, Albena (April 2013). ‚ÄúAnt-Associated Beetle Fauna in Bulgaria: A Review and New Data‚Äù. Psyche (Cairo: Hindawi Pub. Co.) 2013: 1-14 Taxonomy Interactions between Formica sanguinea and Lomechusoides strumosus Staphylinidae is currently considered to be the largest family of beetles, with over 58,000 species described. As such, many myrmecophilous species are unknown. The majority of studied myrmecophilous Rove Beetles belong to the subfamily Aleocharinae, including the commonly studied genera Pella, Dinarda, Tetradonia, Ecitomorpha, Ecitophya, Atemeles, and Lomechusa, and to the subfamily Pselaphinae, which includes Claviger and Adranes. There are also representatives of Scydmaenidae, which includes 117 myrmecophilous species in 20 generaO'Keefe, Sean (2000). \\"Ant-Like Stone Beetles, Ants, and Their Associations (Coleoptera: Scydmaenidae; Hymenoptera: Formicidae; Isoptera)\\". ‚Äò‚ÄôJ. N. Y. Entomol. Soc.‚Äô‚Äô (NYC: N. Y. Entomol. Soc.) 108 (3/4): 273‚Äì303. The Aleocharinae possess defensive glands on their abdomens, which are used in myrmecophilous species to prevent attacks by their host ant and in more extreme cases to integrate completely into the colony. Many Pselephinae species have trichomes, tufts of hairs which hold placating pheromones. Pselephines have evolved trichomes independently at least four times, most notably in all members of Clavigerini, but also in Attapsenius and Songius genera.Parker, Joe; Eldredge, Taro (10 Dec 2012), \\"The Bizarre, Beetle-Biased World of Social Insect Exploitation\\", ‚Äò‚ÄôScientific American‚Äô‚Äô Ecology and Behavior Due to their large number and diversity, myrmecophilous Rove Beetles occupy an array of behaviors.

Synecthrans Synecthran Staphylinids live on the periphery of the host colony and are not accepted into the colony. The majority are in the subfamily Aleocharinae, having defensive glands on their terminal abdominal segments. Species in this group, such as those in the genus Pella, commonly lay their eggs in the refuse heaps of their host ant, where the larvae feed on the discarded carcasses of ants. If detected by the host ant, the larvae enters a typical defense position, facing the ant with its abdomen tip raised. Usually this behavior results in the ant palpating the beetle's abdomen and stopping the attack.Holldobler, B.; Moglich, M.; Maschwitz, U. (1981). \\"Myrmecophilic Relationship Of Pella (coleoptera: Staphylinidae) To Lasius fuliginosus (hymenoptera: Formicidae)\\".

Kistner, David. \\"A Revision of the Species of the Genus Myrmechusa from Tropical Africa with Notes on Their Behavior and Their Relationship to the Pygostenini (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae)\\". ‚ÄúAnn. Entomol. Soc. Am‚Äù 58 (1): 28‚Äì44 Synoeketes Loricate Vatesus Sp. with host ants Synoeketetic Staphylinids live in close contact with their host ants but are not integrated into the colony. These species may be further categorized as neutral, mimetic, loricate, and symphiloid synoeketes. Neutral synoeketes ignore and are ignored by their host, but feed on refuse. There are few Staphylinid neutral synoeketes, but some are found in the genus Athetini, which live in the debris and fungal chambers of leaf cutter ants (Atta). Mimetic synoeketes are myrmecoid, resembling their host ant morphologically. Many mimetic species are guests of Driver ants, which are blind. Driver ants however have strong senses of touch, suggesting mimics fool their hosts tactilely. It is also possible that mimicry may reduce predation from more visual animals, such as birds. Loricate, or ‚Äútear-drop shaped‚Äù, synoeketes are ‚Äúdefensive forms‚Äù. They typically exhibit long tapering bodies with broad thoraxes and smooth bodies, which prevent aggressing ants from gripping them. Symphiloids strongly resemble ‚Äútrue guests,‚Äù but are not fully integrated into the colony. They are often mimics, and in some species have developed trichomes.M. Wheeler, William (1960). ‚Äò‚ÄôAnts: Their Structure, Development, and Behavior.‚Äô‚Äô 9. NYC: Columbia Univ Press. Syneoketes generally live on or inside of ant nests, where they feed on refuse and may steal food from their hosts. There is some overlap between synoeketes and other categories, especially in loricate species and synecthrans, and symphiloids and symphiles, where the behavior of ‚Äútrue guests‚Äù may be difficult to determine. Symphiles Myrmecoids Labidopullus ashei, Beyeria vespa, Pseudomimeciton sp., and Ecitophya bicolor Symphilic Staphylinids have been fully integrated into the host ant's society. Symphilic species have undergone complex morphological adaptations, many becoming myrmecoid. Most have developed trichomes, which secrete appeasement pheromones. The most extreme adaptations, found in members of tribe Clavigerini, include the reduction of mouthparts for trophallaxis and the fusing of many body and antennal segments. While most symphiles use antennal contact to stimulate food giving from their host, at least one member of Clavigerini, Claviger testaceus, secretes a chemical to induce regurgitation from its host ant Lasius flavus.Cammaerts, R. (1992). \\"Stimuli inducing the regurgitation of the workers of Lasius flavus (Formicidae) upon the myrmecophilous beetle Claviger testaceus (Pselaphidae)\\". ‚ÄúBehavioural Processes‚Äù (ScienceDirect) 28 (1-2): 81‚Äì95 Symphiles typically take on many roles in the colony, raising young, feeding and grooming adults, and helping transport food and larvae. Many Staphylinids are capable of following ant pheromone trails, although they are not limited to following trails laid by their host ant. This allows symphiles of army ants to migrate with the colony.W. Rettenmeyer, Carl; D. Akre, Roger (1968). \\"Trail-Following by Guests of Army Ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Ecitonini)\\". J. Kans. Entomol. Soc. (Kans. Entomol. Soc.) 41 (2): 165‚Äì174 Most species are kleptoparasites being fed by other members of the colony, often through trophallaxis. Almost all species have also been observed feeding on the brood. Some of these species die if kept away from the appropriate ant colonies, and others lay their own eggs in ant brood galleries, effectively making them obligate parasites. Chemical Mimicry Chemical mimicry refers to the production of one species‚Äô chemical signals by another species. Many myrmecophilous Staphylinids have evolved chemical mimicry to deter or placate ants. Synecthrans, as non- tolerated guests, primarily produce defensive secretions. Pella species produce two compounds found in their host ant Lasius fuliginosus, undecane and sulcatone, which elicit aggressive and panic reactions respectively. Although it seems counterintuitive to release an aggressive alarm pheromone as a defense, the presence of sulcatone stops the aggression response to undecane. Ants exposed to the defensive secretion act less aggressively and avoid the odor. For Staphylinids accepted into the host colony chemical mimicry is used more for camouflage. The majority of the chemical signals used are cuticular hydrocarbons, which are produced in the cuticle of the host ant at certain concentrations and are palpated to determine the identity of an ant. Species in close contact with their host ants are able to pick up the host's hydrocarbons and imitate the ant's hydrocarbon pattern, thus appearing in scent at least to be the same species as the host ant. As hydrocarbon patterns are specific to an individual colony, the Rove Beetles are generally restricted to one nest. The production of a new hydrocarbon pattern takes time, during which the beetle is vulnerable to detection and attack. Some species, such as Zyras comes, produce volatile pheromones as well as cuticular hydrocarbons, which may provide it more protection than contact based pheromones while traveling with its host in foraging trails.Akino, Toshiharu (2002). \\"Chemical camouflage by myrmecophilous beetles Zyras comes (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae) and Diaritiger fossulatus (Coleoptera: Pselaphidae) to be integrated into the nest of Lasius fuliginosus (Hymenoptera: Formicidae)\\".

Event In the winter of 1599-1600, a lull in the campaigning season, soldiers of the Army of Flanders garrisoned in 's-Hertogenbosch, commanded by Anthonie II Schetz, Baron of Grobbendonk, brought in a French prisoner, a cavalry lieutenant in the service of the Republic. When the prisoner wrote to his captain, Pierre de Br√©aut√©, asking that money be sent to ransom him, Br√©aut√© replied that he should be ashamed at having been captured, since any one of his men should be worth two of the enemy. Gerard Abrahams, a lieutenant of cuirassiers serving under Grobbendonk, heard of the letter's content. He challenged Br√©aut√© to meet him on Vught Heath with equal numbers to put his boast to the test. The two officers obtained permission from their commanders, and the combat took place on 5 February 1600. Each brought twenty-one cavalrymen and two heralds in support. The battle began at a trumpet signal from the heralds. Abrahams was the first casualty, being shot through the neck in the first charge.Gerard Abrahams, in A.J. van der Aa, Biographisch woordenboek der Nederlanden, vol. 1 (Haarlem, 1852), p. 31.

The complex was built outside the walls of the time, near where once stood the Porta Peccioverardi. A major refurbishment occurred in the 1590s. The Dominican convent was suppressed by the Grand-Duke's edict in 1786, and the convent was occupied by the Servites until their suppression in 1800.

Biography  Xia was born in Yiyang, Hunan Province. He studied at Yiyang Primary School, and met Mao Zedong in August 1917 when he enrolled into the Hunan First Normal University. During the May Fourth Movement in 1919, he participated in anti-Japanese boycotts and demonstrations. Xia was one of the first members of the CCP, joining the party in 1921. During the First United Front, Xia concurrently joined the Kuomintang and was involved in the organization of the Kuomintang Hunan provincial headquarters. In the 1926 he was appointed as an alternate member of the Central Executive Committee following the 2nd National Congress of Kuomintang. In the same year, Xia and others such as Guo Liang participated in the Northern Expedition as the Hunan provincial secretaries. In May 1927, he was appointed as the Hunan Provincial Party Secretary and on 1 August participated in the Nanchang Uprising. Following which, Xia met Wang Ming and joined the 28 Bolsheviks during his further studies in the Moscow Sun Yat-sen University. In January 1931, he was elected as an alternate member of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. Xia was sent the Hunan-Hubei Soviet in March 1931 to take over from Deng Zhongxia and was also appointed political commissar of the Second Red Army. Xia initiated purges in 1932, which led to thousands (approximately forty thousand Red Army soldiers were killed under Xia's orders throughout his entire lifespan) being purged and including 27 cadres whom were close associates of He Long. In August 1932, Xia embarked on another purge, and though the number of people purged was unrecorded, the number of cadres purged stands at a high number of 241. Xia carried out another purge in 1933, including the purge of the Hunan Red Army founders and leaders Duan Dechang, Wang Bingnan, and Liu Zhixun. Before the completion of the third purge, Xia Xi started the fourth round of purges in June 1933, resulting to the deaths of more than 3000 cadres. Although Xia held the role of Political Commissar for only 2 years, he had purged tens and thousands of Red Army soldiers and party cadres. In June 1936, Xia admitted his error of intensifying purges during the Hunan-Hubei Branch Meeting and rendezvoused with Red Sixth Army's Ren Bishi in October. As he was repentant about his misconduct during the purges, he was appointed a member of the Hunan-Hubei Provincial Committee and Vice-Chairman and member of the military branch of the Revolutionary Committee. In November 1935, Xia participated in the Long March. On 28 February 1936, Xia Xi fell into the water due to fatigue on the way of crossing the Bijie river. Due to the deaths Xia had caused during the purges years ago, the Red Army soldiers did not rescue him and he consequently drowned.

In addition to the existing country codes such as .be and generic extensions such as .com, extensions such as .ibm, .shop or .limburg were also possible. The first applications could be submitted to ICANN from January 12, 2012. This expansion is particularly interesting for brands, but also for geographical, ethnic and linguistic organizations and institutions. All newly created extensions belong to the group of gTLDs or 'generic Top Level Domains', as opposed to the country codes, which has consequences for their management. DNS.be was immediately one of the candidates to drive the geographical gTLDs. At the beginning of 2012, the Flemish and Brussels governments respectively assigned the management of the gTLDs .vlaanderen and .brussels to DNS.be. DNS.be prepared and submitted the application file for ICANN. After approval, it is responsible for technical and commercial exploitation for 10 years. The formula chosen for the partnership is that of the service concession. In 2012, three applications were submitted to ICANN for generic top-level domains for Belgium. These places were raffled, putting .gent in the 1,021th place, .vlaanderen in the 1,416th place and .brussels in the 1,518th place. Because ICANN handles about 1000 applications per year, it was already bet on a commissioning in 2014.http://www.nomeo.be/over-nomeo/nieuws/vlaanderen-pas- in-2014.aspx In 2013, after the extension was officially approved, criticism of the name came from the Flemish business community. A survey of 291 Flemish companies by BeCommerce revealed that 73% of companies were critical of a new top-level domain. On the other hand, a survey by the Flemish government in 2013 showed that 62% of the 258 municipalities are positive about the new extension. On 7 February 2014, DNS Belgium (now renamed) signed the contract with ICANN for the management of .vlaanderen and .brussels ICANN reported on March 21 that year that the applications for .vlaanderen and .brussels have passed the technical tests. On June 18, 2014, ICANN announced that .vlaanderen and .brussels have been delegated. Specifically, this means that they have been added to the DNS root zone. As a result, the first URLs with these new extensions also exist: nic.vlaanderen and nic.brussels. On July 9, 2014, ICANN approved the startup information. That is the information about the different launch phases and their timing. This also means that all data of the different phases are officially recorded: * Brand owner phase: 01/09/2014 - 01/10/2014 * Phase for local authorities and organizations: 02/10/2014 - 03/11/2014 * Phase for individuals: 13/11/2014 - 15/12/2014 * Landrush 16/12/2014 - 15/01/2015 * Free registrations since 20/01/2015 At the end of January 2016, the number of registrations stood at approximately 7000. About 1000 were allocated to institutions of the Flemish government and related organizations. As a result, the number fell short of government expectations.

Suplado Tips Suplado Tipshttp://sumthinblue.com/suplado-tips/ is the brainchild of Stanley Chi. It started as a random and impromptu post on Facebook. ‚ÄúThat online post turned out to be my very first suplado tip,‚Äù Chi said. ‚ÄúI toyed with the idea that being cocky can be a means of getting what you want ‚Äì or at least a way to delude yourself that you already have everything in the first place.‚Äù Soon after he shared several of his suplado tips on Facebook, people started reposting his tips. ‚ÄúMany people dream of sticking it to their bosses or giving someone they hate a nasty remark or two, but they often resort to doing none of the above. Filipinos tend to be non- confrontational, avoiding conflicts as much as they can. Suplado Tips is the funny respite that people with a grudge have been looking for,‚Äù Chi said. ‚ÄúReading a suplado tip is like acting out a fantasy. The book gives you many scenarios where being standoffish gives you the upper hand, something which otherwise would not happen in real life,‚Äù Chi added. Having been released nationwide in National Bookstore and Fully Booked outlets just last March, stores have reported a shortage of the book. In under three months, there have been about 3000 copies sold nationwide. Suplado Tips is already undergoing its first reprinting. The book has reaped a cult following even before the book‚Äôs release, with readers already scouring bookstores months before the book made it to the shelves. Suplado Tips has spurred on a series of video testimonials, all of which hailed the book in comical embroidery. Ramon Bautista, a TV celebrity and a host of the former radio show, The Brewrats, gave the first testimonial. ‚ÄúSimula nung tinuruan ako ni Stanley Chi na maging suplado, nawala ang ubo ko (Ever since Stanley Chi taught me how to be stuck-up, my cough disappeared),‚Äù Bautista said in the video with pokerfaced wit. Obviously meant as a comical testament, Bautista went on to describe how being suplado has gained him more fans and stalkers, and how it eventually cured his skin problems. (Bautista also stepped up later on to write the book‚Äôs foreword.) Since then, many other celebrities have given their own hilarious accounts of how Suplado Tips has helped them, some of which were not entirely fictional. With the book selling well months before the official book launch last May, PSICOM Publishing Inc.‚Äôs Tom Aquitania was more than happy that he asked Chi to write the book. After the undeniable popularity of Stanley Chi‚Äôs suplado tips on Facebook and on television‚Äôs Front Act (of which Chi was a host), Aquitania asked Chi to compile them into a book. ‚ÄúStanley‚Äôs suplado tips on Facebook has even led to the creation of the Suplado Society of the Philippines, complete with its own suplado oath. All of this, despite being clearly just a pseudo-serious joke, is also an unmistakable sign that Stanley Chi‚Äôs suplado tips is something the public will want more of,‚Äù Aquitania said. Suplado Tips 2 was launched last March 2012 at National Bookstore Shangri-La mall.http://sumthinblue.com/suplado-tips-2/ Suplado Tips books 1 and 2 are Chi's 4th and 5th book.

His poem Kopshti i te mirevet (Garden of the martyrs) is the first and the longest epic known in the Albanian literature. Dalip was born in Frash√´r, today's P√´rmet District, back then part of the Janina Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire. He was the son of Kaso Frash√´ri, brother of poet Shahin Frash√´ri, and uncle of the Albanian poets and National Awakening activists Naim, Sami, and Abdyl Frash√´ri. A dervish originating in a family with strong Bektashi roots, and played an important part in the local tekke there. Not much is known on his life, except that he work for years on his poem Garden of the martyrs. He finished it in 1842, while being interned in the tekke of Konitsa by the Ottoman authorities. Frash√´ri used the Arabic alphabet in his work. Although he was the author of other poems, the one that remains from him is the Garden of the martyrs (Alb: Kopshti i te mirevet). It tells the story of the Battle of Karbala, which had previously influenced Shia and Sufi literature. It was finished on 21 Rabi II 1258 in Islamic Calendar, which corresponds to 6 June 1842. This information comes from some of the verses: A poem of around 56,000 verses based on the region's specific sub-dialect of Tosk, it is the earliest and longest epic piece written in Albanian language. It is believed to have been intended for ritual ceremonies in tekkes and home rituals during the m√§tam. While is based on the work of Azerbaijani poet Fuz√ªl√Æ, also named Had√Ækat √ºs- S√ºed√¢ (ÿ≠ÿØŸäŸÇÿ™ ÿßŸÑÿ≥ÿπÿØÿßÿ°; \\"Garden of martyrs\\"), it is the first attempts by Bektashi Albanians to rival Fuz√ªl√Æ and show the significant impact of Bektashism in Albanian life of those times. While Fuz√ªl√Æ used both poetry and prose for his poem, Frash√´ri relied only on verses. The poem includes information on Albanian customs, festivals, and sensibilities. For instance, it gives details on the M√§tam ritual, where the Bektashis refrain from drinking water. Therefore, even if it seems that Frash√´ri's initial idea was to translate and adapt Fuz√ªl√Æ's work, it ended up as a truly national and comprehensible composition on its own. The poem is divided in ten sections, and is preceded by an introduction. The intro tells the story of the Bektashism in Albania, with plenty of information believed he gathered from Baba Shemin of Kruj√´ and Nasibi Tahir Babai, both Bektashi important figures of that time. The poem cites the sect's important personalities, latter additions, and propagation. It follows with the history of the Arabs before Islam, the work of the Prophet, his life and death, and events that led to the Karbala tragedy. The Battle of Karbala is described in detail; Frash√´ri eulogizes those who fell as martyrs, in particular Husayn ibn Ali. The poem is believed to have served at a some extend as base model for the later work of the Albanian nationalist poet Naim Frash√´ri named Qerbelaja (Karbala), and also for the epic Istori' e Skenderbeut (History of Scanderbeg), published in Bucharest in 1898. It is one of the latest works written in Albanian using the Arabic alphabet.

It was partly formed for the first time as a standard Red Army rifle division in the spring of 1941, before the German invasion, but was never completed. A second formation began in April, 1942 and was completed on June 1, after which it was sent to the Stalingrad Front. Heavily depleted in counterattacks against the north flank of German Sixth Army, by November the survivors were reassigned and the division disbanded. The 207th was formed for a third time in June, 1943, and fought its way through the central part of the Soviet- German front, ending the war in the heart of Berlin in the battle for the Reichstag. The division saw postwar service in the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany.  1st Formation  The 207th Rifle Division began forming on March 4, 1941. Very little is known about this formation:  2nd Formation  The second 207th Rifle Division began forming in April, 1942, to begin with in the North Caucasus Military District, based on a cadre from the 52nd Rifle Brigade.Walter S. Dunn, Stalin's Keys to Victory, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2006, p 115 It did not have a commander assigned until after it moved to Ivanovo in the Moscow Military District in June. The division's primary order of battle was as follows: * 594th Rifle Regiment * 597th Rifle Regiment * 598th Rifle Regiment * 780th Artillery RegimentSharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed From 1942 to 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. X, 1996, p 82 The division was first assigned to the 10th Reserve Army in the Reserve of the Supreme High Command. In August it returned to the south, assigned to 24th Army in Stalingrad Front. During the following two months the 24th, along with the 66th and 1st Guards Armies, were thrown into a series of desperate and costly counterattacks against the north flank of the German \\"corridor\\" that led their positions in Stalingrad. In November the 207th was so worn down that its survivors were reassigned to help rebuild the 387th Rifle Division, and the division was officially disbanded in the Don Front on December 2.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", pp 82-83 3rd Formation A new 207th Rifle Division was formed on June 6, 1943, in the 5th Army in Western Front, based on a cadre from the 40th Rifle Brigade and the 2nd formation of the 153rd Rifle Brigade.Dunn, p 132 Its order of battle remained the same as the 2nd (and probably the 1st) formation. It inherited the Order of the Red Banner unit award that had been won by the 40th.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", p 83 The division remained in 5th Army in Western Front until October, fighting towards Smolensk, until it was transferred to 10th Guards Army in the same Front. At the end of the year 10th Guards went to the 2nd Baltic Front, and in January, 1944, the 207th joined the 79th Rifle Corps in 3rd Shock Army in the same Front. The division would remain in that army until postwar, and in that corps as well, apart from a temporary reassignment to 93rd Rifle Corps from Apr. - June, 1944.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", p 83 In December, following the ≈†iauliai Offensive and the Riga Offensive, 3rd Shock Army was transferred to the 1st Belorussian Front. In this Front it took part in the Vistula-Oder Offensive through Poland and eastern Germany, and the 207th distinguished itself in the conquest of eastern Pomerania, receiving the name of that German state as an honorific. During the Battle of Berlin in late April, 1945, 3rd Shock helped outflank the north side of the city and 79th Corps opened long- range artillery fire on it on April 20. The next day, elements of the army, and several others, reached the suburbs and entered difficult urban combat. On April 29, against fanatic resistance, 79th Corps began the symbolic struggle for the Reichstag. The 207th supported its comrades of the 150th Rifle Division as they fought through the building and hoisted the Red Banner over it on the 30th.David M.

It was one of two storms that year to inflict hurricane- force winds over South Texas, causing significant damage there; the other occurred in early September. The fifth tropical cyclone of the year, it formed east of the Lesser Antilles on July 24, rapidly strengthening as it moved west-northwest. As it passed over the islands, it attained hurricane status on July 26, producing heavy rains and killing at least six people. Over the next three days, it moved north of the Caribbean, paralleling the Turks and Caicos Islands and the Bahamas. The storm produced extensive damage and at least one drowning as it crossed the Bahamas. On July 29, the cyclone came under the influence of changing steering currents in the atmosphere, which forced the storm into Florida near Hobe Sound a day later. A minimal hurricane at landfall, it caused negligible wind damage as it crossed Florida, but generated heavy rains along its path, causing locally severe flooding. The storm turned west, weakened to below hurricane status, and later exited the state north of Charlotte Harbor on July 31\\\\. Once over the eastern Gulf of Mexico, the storm shifted its course to the west-southwest and gradually recovered its intensity. The path of the storm brought it close to the mouth of the Rio Grande in early August. Few ships encountered the small storm as it regained hurricane status on August 4, just a day before striking northern Mexico with winds of 90 mph (145 km/h)‚Äîmaking it close to a modern-day Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale. Striking close to the border between the United States and Mexico, the storm caused extensive damage in both countries. Winds damaged buildings and crops in Tamaulipas and the southern regions of Texas, with heavy losses to citrus production in the Rio Grande Valley. While only one person died in the United States, heavy rains led to catastrophic flooding that claimed at least 31 lives in northern Mexico; the worst-hit areas were in and near the city of Monterrey. While monetary losses in Mexico were unclear, the storm did at least $3,000,000 in damages in the United States, measured in contemporary U.S. dollars. Historical context The July storm was not the last to damage the Treasure Coast of Florida in 1933: a much stronger cyclone in September, with winds of 125 mph (200 km/h), extensively damaged the same area that the July storm affected. This storm overshadowed memories of the earlier hurricane, and would be remembered as among the worst on the Treasure Coast as late as the 1980s. The occurrence of two hurricanes on the east coast of Florida in the same season is a relatively rare event in historical records, but not unprecedented: for instance, forensic research by weather historian David M. Ludlum suggests that two or more hurricanes in 1837 may have affected the region. Citing reports from William Reid in Law of Storms (1838), Ludlum noted that two hurricanes affected Central and Northeast Florida on August 1‚Äì2 and September 6, respectively, while other storms, potentially hurricanes, may have done so later in September. The September hurricane struck between St. Augustine and Jacksonville. Incidentally, the 1837 Atlantic hurricane season was apparently very active, like 1933; as in 2004, a record four hurricanes hit the state of Florida, including the infamous Racer's Storm in October. Meteorological history At 12:00 UTC on July 24, HURDAT initialized a tropical depression some 430 miles (690 km) east of Saint Lucia in the Windward Islands. (This was at the time that another tropical system formed over 450 mi (725 km) east of Bermuda.) Prior to reanalysis in 2012, official records indicated formation at 12:00 UTC on July 25; however, examination of observations from ships and land stations revealed a closed low a day earlier. Upon generation, the depression moved generally west-northwest, toward the eastern Caribbean, becoming a tropical storm at 00:00 UTC on July 25\\\\. However, ships and weather stations did not observe gales until later that day, so the winds in HURDAT were interpolated, but based on available data, the storm strengthened steadily. At 16:00 UTC, the British steamship Daytonian recorded a pressure of , followed by peak winds of Force 9, about , from the east. Around that time, the island of Antigua also experienced gales and a pressure of as the storm made landfall with winds of 60 to 70 mph (95 to 110 km/h). A barometer on Saba measured , implying maximum sustained winds of 85 mph (140 km/h); based on this, the storm was posthumously upgraded to hurricane status at 00:00 UTC on July 26, 12 hours earlier than once designated in HURDAT. As the storm neared Saint Thomas, the island experienced northeast winds of . On its west-northwest course, the storm‚Äînow equivalent to a Category 1 hurricane‚Äîmissed Puerto Rico to its northeast. On July 27, the cyclone brushed Grand Turk and the Caicos, producing winds visually estimated at on the former island, with a peripheral pressure of . The hurricane gradually bent to the northwest as it followed the arc of the eastern Bahamas. After 15:00 UTC on July 28, the Norwegian steamship Noreg encountered southeast winds of , yet pressures only dipped to . The storm struck Cat Island, Bahamas, around 18:00 UTC with winds of 80 mph (130 km/h); the next day, the storm made another landfall on the Abaco Islands with the same winds. During this time, the storm turned to the west-northwest, nearing the east coast of Florida; this was likely due to a robust subtropical ridge in the area. Based on ship reports, the storm made its only landfall in the United States on Jupiter Island, between Port Salerno and Hobe Sound, Florida, around 16:00 UTC on July 30\\\\. Some hours earlier, the American steamship El Almirante encountered hurricane-force winds‚Äîthe only such instance at sea in the storm‚Äîconcurrent with a pressure of . Another ship nearby made a reading of coincident with winds of , hinting that it was taken inside the eye of the storm; calculations by researchers determined that the central pressure was at the time and at landfall in Florida. While this supported winds of only tropical storm force (70 mph (110 km/h)), the storm had a small radius of outermost closed isobar embedded in a ridge of high pressure, so winds in Florida were deemed to be 75 mph (120 km/h), affirming earlier reports that listed the storm as a hurricane at landfall. After landfall, the storm weakened to a tropical storm and moved slowly westward across the south- central peninsula, passing over the northern end of Lake Okeechobee early on July 31\\\\. The center of the compact tropical cyclone then passed slightly north of Punta Gorda and reached the Gulf of Mexico, between Venice and Englewood, with winds of 45 mph (75 km/h). From this point, few ships were near the center of the storm with which to accurately discern its location and intensity, though data on August 1‚Äì2 confirmed a weaker cyclone than earlier. At 00:00 UTC on August 1, the storm began a persistent west-southwest motion that continued for the rest of its life cycle. A few ships on August 1‚Äì3 noted modest gales of , with the lowest pressure on weather maps being at 12:00 UTC on August 3. Based on this pressure, reanalysis inferred that the storm began gradually restrengthening a day earlier, reaching 65 mph (100 km/h) at the time of the reading. Although the storm regained hurricane status at 00:00 UTC on August 4, due to the sparsity of ship data, weather forecasters at the time assumed the storm only contained gale-force winds. For a day, the storm briefly angled to the west as it neared the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border, reaching its final and strongest peak of 90 mph (150 km/h) late on August 4\\\\. Anemometers in Brownsville, Texas, verified a landfall near Playa Lauro Villar, Tamaulipas, just south of the Rio Grande, near 01:00 UTC on August 5\\\\. Based on the data, scientists ascertained a radius of maximum wind of about 30 mi (45 km) as the eye made landfall. Barometers in Brownsville showed pressures of , attesting a central pressure of in the eye. Now hooking west- southwest, the storm quickly atrophied as it moved inland and vanished over easternmost Nuevo Le√≥n by 18:00 UTC on August 5\\\\. Preparations Although the storm affected several Caribbean islands, the Turks and Caicos, and the Bahamas, preparations there, if any, were unclear. Residents across Puerto Rico boarded up windows and secured roofs in anticipation of damaging winds. Governor Robert Hayes Gore placed the Hurricane Relief Organization and Red Cross on standby. As the storm neared Florida, the United States Weather Bureau‚Äîlater the National Weather Service‚Äîposted storm warnings between Miami and Titusville. These were later extended to include the west coast of the state from Punta Rassa to Tarpon Springs. At the time, forecasters were unaware that the storm was of hurricane status; this unawareness extended to the storm's passage over the Gulf of Mexico. Forecasters only issued storm warnings for part of the Texas coast, including the cities of Brownsville and Freeport. Upon news of the storm, businesses in West Palm Beach boarded up vulnerable, expensive plate glass windows. Fearing flooding, authorities were empowered by Florida governor David Sholtz to evacuate over 4,200‚Äì5,000 residents, most of whom were black farm workers, from low-lying areas around Lake Okeechobee to elevated locations. Most of the evacuees left by train, prompted by fears of washouts on the track beds. A day before the storm, the lake level reached , heightening officials' concerns about flooding and spurring the evacuations. Several railway companies lent free transport to their passengers, and trains were conveniently stationed around the lake. The evacuations took place in the communities of Belle Glade, Pahokee, Canal Point, Okeechobee, and Clewiston. Relief organizations and local mayors distributed milk, biscuits, and coffee to evacuees. On the west coast of the state, some residents covered their windows, but many others did not, anticipating little damage from the weak storm. Citizens received radio updates from the Weather Bureau, which gave the position and movement of the storm. Some beachfront residents, such as in Sarasota, left their homes for safety, while boaters secured their vessels. In Texas, the Weather Bureau notified people early enough to allow mass evacuations: most coastal residents and camping visitors evacuated the vulnerable islands as the storm neared. Between 60‚Äì70% of Port Isabel's 500 residents left before the storm, with the remainder sheltering in a sturdy brick store on the highest land available. Impact Throughout the hurricane's path from the Caribbean, to Florida, and finally into Texas and Mexico, 39 people were killed. Thirty-one deaths occurred in Mexico, six in Saint Kitts, and one in both the Bahamas and Texas. Although figures from Mexico were unavailable, total losses from the storm in the United States reached about $3 million, inclusive of Florida and Texas, though figures for the latter state varied from $500,000 to $1.75 million, according to various sources. Caribbean Surface weather analysis of the cyclone over the Lesser Antilles on July 25 As it passed over the Lesser Antilles, the storm caused at least six deaths on the island of Saint Kitts‚Äîthen known as Saint Christopher Island ‚Äîand the Virgin Islands reported torrential rains, though no damage was reported. The barometer dipped to as the storm bypassed the islands to the south. Crops and farm fencing on Saint Croix sustained some damage, though overall effects were limited. Coincidentally, the storm arrived the day after Hurricane Supplication Day, a local tradition marking the opening of hurricane season on the fourth Monday in July. In the Bahamas, winds of swept the Abaco Islands early on July 29, but caused only minimal damage there. Other reports indicated more severe damage elsewhere in the islands, including across the Turks and Caicos Islands, and one death from drowning. The American schooner Adams, anchored off Grand Turk, was dragged out to sea by the hurricane's waves. Florida Wind damage was generally minimal as the small hurricane crossed Florida, except to citrus crops and snapped vegetation in some areas. According to a survey by local fire officials, the calm eye was observed from Hobe Sound to the edge of Stuart, during which passage \\"hardly a needle in pine trees along the side of the road could be seen moving.\\" Peak winds estimated or registered at affected the coast between Stuart and Fort Pierce. The winds downed several telegraph poles and destroyed a structure at Stuart, but otherwise little damage resulted. Initial reports from Fort Pierce signaled no uprooted trees. Farther south, apart from a snapped coconut palm, the town of Palm Beach evinced little damage to foliage. In Fort Pierce, heavier losses to grapefruit were accounted at about 25%, especially in exposed groves, and some trees suffered total loss of fruit. Shrubs and roofs in the city were damaged as well, but power and water services were quickly revived as the worst of the storm passed. Final losses to citrus in the Indian River region were tallied at 10‚Äì20%, with much greater tolls locally. Avocado and mango trees also sustained significant damage. A minimum pressure of occurred in Stuart, the same as in Jupiter‚Äîboth unusually high for a hurricane, though likely related to the storm's small size. In fact, contemporary meteorologists concluded that the storm had only hit Florida at tropical storm strength, with top winds of in Stuart. Despite the relatively modest winds, prolific rains attended the cyclone. A rain gauge at the Palm Beach Post office in West Palm Beach counted on July 30‚Äì31, setting a 24-hour record at that location‚Äî above the daily maximum for the week of the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane. This established a monthly record as well, the total being for July. Ultimately, totals exceeding fell over a two-day span, with a storm total of . Other rain gauges, such as one that blew over in Fort Pierce, failed to measure the true totals, which were likely underestimated. The deluge turned lawns into \\"small lakes,\\" overflowed curbs on Royal Palm Way for two blocks, and left up to of water in the streets of Royal Park, a neighborhood in Palm Beach. Floodwaters submerged all but the highest land on a nearby golf course, which was navigable only by boat. The copious rains submerged roads and rural countryside in Palm Beach, Martin, and St. Lucie counties, but did not render highways impassible for traffic. However, roads in the Jupiter area could only be traversed \\"with great difficulty,\\" and water stood deep on parts of Dixie Highway. Floodwaters shut down a bridge in town, and aside from a West Palm Beach commuter, bus drivers were the only motorists on flooded roads. The Post described the predicament of Matt Platt, the commuter from West Palm Beach, as he entered Jupiter: > Trains were getting through but travel by car in any direction was almost > taboo. [...] Water ... at times was up to the lights on his car, [and he] > was the only person to drive into the town Monday [July 31]... ‚ÄìPalm Beach > Post, August 1, 1933 Reports from Jupiter detailed a town almost \\"cut off\\" by floodwaters. A washout affected a section of track bed on the Florida East Coast Railway in Port Salerno, halting three passenger trains for a combined 7.5 hours. Nearby, floodwaters stranded two Florida Motor Lines buses as water rose to cover the floors. Relief vehicles later transported passengers on their way. African- American communities in Stuart reported severe flooding as well, and torrential rains formed potholes in streets in West Palm Beach. The rains demonstrated that local communities could be stranded, causing funds to be expedited toward bridge repairs on the Loxahatchee River near Jupiter. As late as August 2, floodwaters remained deep along Military Trail near West Palm Beach. Flooding in some areas was the worst since a hurricane in October 1924. Winds disrupted communications with small settlements, and Stuart was unreachable for many hours. Loose branches falling on power lines temporarily disrupted electricity in Palm Beach, where flooding affected low-lying ground. The effects were similar to those attending earlier storms. Sewers in West Palm Beach backed up, causing water to seep over Dixie Highway at several spots. The water also submerged an FEC railroad siding and was deep at the east end of the Royal Park bridge. Several cars were stranded while attempting to navigate flooded streets. Despite inconveniences, residents made good humor of the elements: newspapers noted that a parrot lost shortly before the storm was spotted in a tree, uninjured, and returned to its owner. Rainfall map for the hurricane over Florida Inland, the storm caused no appreciable effects as it mostly crossed sparsely settled areas. Winds at Okeechobee reached as the center moved south of that town early on July 31. Heavy rains extended over the area, with 24-hour amounts of in Indiantown and at a water transport lock. Additional heavy rains fell over the west coast of Florida, but to a lesser extent than on the east; as was the case elsewhere, notable wind damage was almost non-existent. Little immediate damage from wind and rain resulted in the Everglades and near Lake Okeechobee. Winds peaked at in Pahokee, along the lake's eastern shore, and the lake level rose on July 30‚Äì31, which was not enough to induce flooding, although the Kissimmee River, which fed into Lake Okeechobee, rose steadily, owing to heavy rains. The Weather Bureau office in Tampa recorded peak winds of . In St. Petersburg, citizens enjoyed a refreshing northeast breeze that removed dead fronds from palms, uprooted scattered plants, and sent waves splashing over seawalls. An anemometer operated by United States Airways at Grand Central Airport, a now-defunct airport on Weedon Island, clocked winds. Texas and Mexico As the hurricane affected Brownsville, strong winds‚Äîestimated at ‚Äîrent apart tree limbs, tore off roofs, and cracked plate glass windows. Debris covered streets in nearby Port Isabel, where waterfront fishing huts were wrecked. High seas also destroyed many structures on South Padre Island and partly submerged Padre and Brazos islands. High tides eroded of highway on Brazos. Almost no building in Port Isabel went unscathed, with poorly built structures flattened; among the worst hit were at a development company. Early reports confirmed that airborne glass from the local courthouse mildly injured a man in Brownsville. The storm also disrupted communications between the Texas mainland and the barrier islands, where high tides stranded 25‚Äì30 campers and a detachment of cavalry from Fort Brown. Two hangars in Brownsville collapsed from the winds as well. A smokestack at a canning facility in La Feria collapsed under the strain of high winds. Water levels along the Rio Grande rose by , though the river ultimately fell short of flood stage and spared surrounding areas of damage. The storm ruined between 8‚Äì10% of the citrus crop in the Rio Grande Valley, and caused at least one death in Texas. Localized losses to the citrus crop reached 25% and upwards of 50% of the cotton crop was blown away in the lower valley region. Total crop damage reached $2 million. In Mexico, the storm produced torrential rains that resulted in severe flooding, particularly in riparian areas along and near the Santa Catarina River in Monterrey, where at least 31 people died as floods made more than a quarter of the city inaccessible. The collapse of a bridge isolated the Colonia Independencia. Raging waters destroyed 300 homes in one section alone, forcing occupants to flee, and the number of homeless reached the \\"thousands.\\" Governor L√°zaro C√°rdenas and Mayor Calles called upon all city and state facilities for relief efforts. Many people required evacuation by boat in what were described as \\"thrilling rescues.\\" The effects of the storm prostrated electrical and communications lines as well as trees in the city. Nearer to the coast, strong winds severely damaged the famed Teatro Reforma, a theater dating to the Maximilian era of the 1860s, in Matamoros, Tamaulipas, where many homes were destroyed.

In 1706, the palace was acquired by Giuseppe Maria Zagnoni, whose family lived in the adjacent structure. To his properties were added the houses of Cavazza and Poeti. In 1756 the marchese Antonio, son of Giuseppe Maria, obtained permission from the Senate to substitute the wooden pilasters with a stone portico. This work proceeded until 1764, when the son of Antonio, Giuseppe, commissioned the present Neoclassic facade from Francesco Tadolini. The casa Cavazza and casa Poeti maintained their facades. After the Napoleonic convulsions, the Zagnoni were forced to sell may properties and the impressive Zagnoni collection of art was mostly sold in the 19th century.

Biography Born in Brazzaville on 15 November 1911, he was the son of the Governor-General of French Equatorial Africa, Martial Henri Merlin. Merlin first represented the France Davis Cup team in the final of the 1933 tournament, against Great Britain at the Stade de Roland Garros. France, under The Four Musketeers, had won the previous six tournaments, but were an ageing side and brought in Merlin to counter the younger British players. Merlin lost the opening match to Bunny Austin in a one sided encounter and Henri Cochet was beaten by Fred Perry, but the French fought back to win the doubles then levelled the tie when Cochet overcame Austin in five sets. This meant it came down to Merlin in the fifth rubber, with his match against Perry to decide the title. Merlin won the first set, but Perry fought back to win in four and secure Britain's first title since 1912. In the second set, Merlin had failed to capitalise on two set points. This would remain the only Davis Cup final that Merlin played, despite his effort in France's 1934 campaign, when his win over Australia's Jack Crawford in the semi-final was not enough to ultimately win the tie. In August 1934 he was seriously injured in a motorcycle accident near Deauville in France. He crashed into an oncoming vehicle while trying to overtake another and was thrown into a ditch. His leg suffered the worst, with torn ligaments and bad cuts to his knee. He also sprained his ankle. These injuries kept him out of action for the remainder of the year and cast doubts over his future in tennis. He was hospitalised again in March 1935 when he was poisoned after drinking a veronal bottle. His parents discovered him in his bedroom and doctors needed to use a stomach pump to restore him to full consciousness. It was reported that it may have been a suicide attempt, with some close friends claiming on court struggles had left him near a nervous breakdown. However, Merlin claimed the overdose was accidental and he had taken it after a tough day training. The bottle had been prescribed after his motor accident to assist his sleep. In June he returned to the French Davis Cup team for a quarter-final tie against Australia, in what would be his last appearance in the tournament. Merlin was a quarter-finalist in the 1936 French Championships, as an unseeded player. He had a win over fifth seed Henner Henkel en route to the quarter-final defeat in which he took countryman Christian Boussus to five sets. After the war, Merlin made one final appearance at his home tournament, at the 1947 French Championships, but ended up defaulting his opening match. He died in Paris on 5 September 1960, aged 48.

They were initially an interracial rock band, one of the few at the time, and, along with The Remains and the Rockin' Ramrods, later became one of the most popular live acts in Boston, landing a contract with Capitol Records. In spite of having a regional hit with their first record, they were unable to find greater commercial success and broke up in 1967. In the intervening years their work has come to the attention of garage rock collectors and enthusiasts with the release of the anthology, Early Recordings and Lost Tapes, on Arf! Arf! Records. History The Lost were formed at Goddard College in Plainfield, Vermmont in 1964. Initially they were an interracial band featuring black guitarist and singer Hugh Magbie. Their original lineup consisted Magbie on lead guitar and vocals, Ted Myers on rhythm guitar and vocals, Walter Powers III on bass, harmonica, and vocals, Willie \\"Loco\\" Alexander on keyboards, percussion and vocals, and Tony Pfeiffer on drums. After the move to Boston in late 1964, Magbie and Pfeiffer departed, both choosing to return to college. Lee Mason, a childhood friend of Myers, replaced Pfeiffer on drums and the band brought in Kyle Garrahan on lead guitar. The Lost built a repertoire containing of a fairly large set of original songs written by guitarist Ted Myers and keyboardist Willie Alexander. The Lost became one of the most popular live bands in Boston, playing at the Rathskeller. On December 12, 1964 they recorded a demo at Bard College in Boston produced by Barry Tashian of The Remains, which helped them land a contract with Capitol Records. Their debut single for Capitol, \\"Maybe More Than You\\" b/w \\"Back Door Blues\\" reflected the influences of Bob Dylan and folk rock and received a degree of airplay on radio stations in Massachusetts and New York. The band played as an opening act for James Brown, Sonny & Cher, the Supremes, the Shirelles, and Jr. Walker & The All Stars, in addition to touring the East Coast with the Beach Boys in the spring of 1966. Their next single, \\"Violet Gown\\" did not come out until a year later. Its first release b/w \\"Mean Motorcycle\\" was rescinded by Capitol and had to be re-recorded in a second version produced by Jerry Keller, with a new B-side of \\"No Reason Why.\\" The single failed to chart. Disappointed with its lack of success, Capitol ended their relationship with the band. The band's momentum began to stop. In January 1967 the Lost would play four shows, including one for the opening weekend of a newly christened venue, the Boston Tea Party, in a building which had previously served a cinemateque for avant garde film, and would now become a well-known fixture in Boston's burgeoning Bosstown psychedelic rock scene. The Lost played their last show at the Tea Party on January 28, 1967. Shortly thereafter, the band broke up. Ted Myers went on to play in the psychedelic rock band, Chamaeleon Church, along with future comedy star, Chevy Chase who was their drummer. Myers would also play in Ultimate Spinach during their final days. In the early 1970s bassist Walter Powers and keyboardist Willie Alexander joined the final lineup of the Velvet Underground after Lou Reed had departed. Alexander went on to play with local bands over the following decades in the Boston area, earning an almost legendary reputation there as an in-demand musician. The Lost have re-united for occasional performances. In addition to their three singles in the mid-1960s, the Lost recorded numerous unissued songs, much of which were released in the 1990s on the Early Recordings and Lost Tapes CD, up out by Arf! Arf!

Competing with the abundance of sunshine pop groups originating from California, the Blades of Grass are most-known for their nationally charting rendition of the song \\"Happy\\". The band also released an album called The Blades of Grass Are Not for Smoking before disbanding. History Formed in 1967, with a lineup consisting of Bruce Ames (rhythm guitar, vocals), David Gordon (drums, organ), Frank DiChiara (bass guitar, vocals), and Marc Black (lead guitar], vocals]), the band was originally known as the Furnace Men to allude to the basement the group typically practiced in. Becoming a popular attraction in their hometown, the group incited interest in managing partners Frank Latagona and Walter Gollander, who promised to find the Furnace Men a recording contract. Latagona and Gollander stood by their offer, promoting the band to Jubilee Records in mid-1967. Record producers, according to Ames, changed their name to the Blades of Grass because they \\"thought that our sound was bright and clear and that the Furnace Men sounded dark and dirty. As our producers, we had no choice but to reluctantly agree to the name change\\". They recorded several cover versions for the record label, including \\"Happy\\" for the band's debut single. Unbeknownst to the Blades of Grass, another sunshine pop group, the Sunshine Company, also released their own rendition of \\"Happy\\" at almost the same time. Ames recalled that \\"We were blindsided and shocked when we were informed that there was another version of 'Happy.' As I remember it, our managers were equally surprised and upset\\". Having to compete with another release, the Blades of Grass's rendition of \\"Happy\\" did exceedingly well on the East coast, but the Sunshine Company's performed better on the West coast. The Blades of Grass had a moderate hit with \\"Happy\\" reaching number 87 on the Billboard Hot 100, while their competitor peaked at number 50. Surprisingly enough, the group's second single, \\"I Love You Alice B. Toklas\\" from the film of the same name, was also simultaneously distributed in early-1968 with another version by Harpers Bizarre (whose version was used in the film) and failed to chart. More releases followed throughout 1968 that failed to chart, including their debut album, The Blades of Grass Are Not for Smoking. The Blades of Grass were especially subdued in the studio to other songwriters' material, though Black, the band's main composer, claimed to have penned nearly 100 songs during the group's existence. The album contained heavily orchestrated instrumentals and airy vocal harmonies that were coherent with many California-based sunshine groups. A few obscure non-LP singles were released in early 1969, but the Blades of Grass, after its members graduated high school, disbanded within the year. In 2002, Rev-Ola Records reissued the album, with the band's material from their non-LP singles included as bonus tracks.

Chickpeas are an important legume to the population, as it is the primary protein source for nearly 2 million Nepalese people. In 2013, Nepal imported approximately US$10.1 million in dried shelled chickpeas, mostly from Australia and also from Canada, creating a need to increase production for its own people and to balance bilateral trade. Chickpeas are an excellent source of protein, especially when compared to other legume pulses. They are high in unsaturated fatty acids and minerals, including calcium, magnesium, phosphorus and potassium. Agronomic issues and potential solutions There are a number of agronomic issues, both biotic and abiotic, that have considerably reduced the production of chickpeas in the Terai of Nepal. Botrytis gray mold (BGM) was the main cause of the rapid decline in production of chickpeas, as it completely devastated crops in 1997‚Äì1998, especially in the humid eastern part of the country causing farmers to switch to a more stable, albeit less profitable, legume such as lentils. This devastation has given chickpeas a very negative reputation of being a risky crop and has likely delayed the spread of new technologies and cultivars to increase production. Fusarium wilt is another major biotic problem to chickpea production in Nepal. Abiotic issues include boron deficient soils, as well as infertile land due to soil acidity and drought. However, these issues can be dealt with by low-cost techniques without having to rely heavily on expensive alternatives such as fungicides. Larger spacing between rows can decrease leaf wetness to decrease BGM. Intercropping with mustard seems to significantly reduce the disease. Coating the seed with rhizobium or mixing the rhizobium into the soil can combat poor nodulation and therefore improve the nitrogen fixing capacity of the chickpea. Poor soil fertility can be combated with vermicompost along with fertilizers to increase root length, grain yield, and further nodulation. Ideally, an integrated crop management strategy using genetically resistant seeds incorporated into local varieties, the use of fungicides, along with the simpler strategies mentioned could allow for sustainable and profitable production of chickpeas for Nepalese farmers. Sustainability Although chickpeas are only suitable to be grown in the Terai region of Nepal, the selection and technology of new landraces would allow for proper chickpea production from the humid and acidic soils of the east to the drier western parts of the country. In the dry western parts of the country, seeds have been formulated with short durations to escape potential long droughts. In the eastern and central part of the Terai, seeds have been formulated with increased disease resistance and earlier maturity to escape the potential fungal threats in these moist and humid environments. Thus although these crops can mainly be grown only in the Terai region, it is not segregated to one geographical area and can thus improve distribution of this quality protein to a large portion of the population. Labor and cost  Chickpeas are a relatively low input crop that is quite drought resistant. They can be relatively easily intercropped with cereals such as maize or rice. Nepal imports a huge amount of rice from India, therefore intercropping with chickpeas could be a more economical option for a subsistence farmer, rather than purchasing these products from overseas. Research has shown that seed priming can have massive effects on chickpea production in rice fallows, increasing chickpea yield by 41% by seed priming alone. Due to chickpeas high water efficiency, it can be planted after rice in the dry season, using the residual moisture to grow. This also keeps the farmers' land from being bare when the rice has been harvested, which could lead to improve organic material in the soil as well as less need for nitrogen fertilizer in subsequent rice seasons. Despite its good drought tolerance, irrigation of chickpeas in the vegetative stage has been shown to increase yields. Impact on families Planting chickpeas can have a huge impact on the life of poor subsistence farmers. Using integrated crop management strategies, including fungicides, larger distances between rows, rhizobium inoculants, and some improved cultivars of native landraces (Avarodhi cultivar over Dhanush and Trishul) can increase family income by 80 to 100%. Although the cost to implement these strategies is 13% higher (which may not be possible to obtain for a subsistence farmer) the profits per hectare could be nearly doubled. Protein intake for a farmer‚Äôs family can increase by 40%, and increases in livestock ownership can increase by 30%. This can result in an increase of 45% extra income for the family. There is additional wealth generation in the selling of these improved disease resistant Avarodhi desi seeds over the local cultivars. There have been improved varieties of Kabuli chickpeas called Kosheli. Kabuli chickpeas generally go for higher prices; in Canada they are sold for nearly 60% more money. Further economic benefit includes the decreased use of fertilizer in subsequent rice crops as well as decreases in urea requirement and compost due to its extensive root system and nitrogen fixing capacity.

Iclif's mission is to further the goals of sustainability, performance and good governance. Originally, Iclif was focused on the financial services industry in Malaysia. However, as national and global economies became more connected, Iclif has since expanded into varied economic sectors across Asia and beyond.ICLIF aims to impart leadership training to Indian Companies The Hindu Business Line, 01/11/10, Retrieved 04/04/18  Programmes  Iclif promotes leadership development and corporate governance, although it has evolved beyond its initial charter to conduct programmes for Malaysian financial institutions only. Iclif now conducts programmes for all corporations in Malaysia and in neighboring countries including Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore, Hong Kong, India and the Middle East. It also offers custom-built programs to help organizations close knowledge gaps.  Publications  Iclif's publications focus on Asia-related research, which is in turn used to develop targeted programmes and advisory services. Some notable research efforts include: Open Source Leadership: Reinventing Management When There's No More Business As Usual A study of 28 countries with interviews of approximately 16,000 executives, designed to explore leadership challenges in today's workforce. It also explored employee motivation.st Century. The findings are summarised in the book Open Source Leadership, published by McGraw-Hill, New York. Asian Leadership Index Approximately 4,000 employees in companies operating across Asia-Pacific were asked about their expectations of leaders, and what their current leaders are missing. The research identified 10 attributes that are important for leadership effectiveness in Asia. Leadership Energy A study on Iclif's proprietary concept of Leadership Energy. Over 10,000 randomly selected individuals from 27 countries were asked to answer three questions on leadership and personal success. The same questions were then directed to 500 individuals with exposure to the concept of Leadership Energy. The goal of the research was to determine whether the questions would be answered differently by those with context and education on the discipline. The essence of this research is captured in the article entitled, Quantum Mechanics, Spirituality and Leadership.\\"Leadership all about Energy\\" Edge Weekly, 22/09/17, Retrieved 04/04/18 Employee Engagement This research was conducted primarily to establish a differentiated perspective on the conventional concept of employee engagement. A distinct element of this engagement study is that it segmented the views of followers along the performance bell curve recognising that the needs of high performers, average performers and low performers will vary. Additionally, the study provided insight into leader's expectations of followers and uncovered sources of motivation for performance at the highest level. It also investigated the need for a certain amount of bold, tough and sometimes top-down leadership in achieving breakthrough success.

The Formation of Nabataean Art: Prohibition of a Graven Image Among the Nabateans. Jerusalem: Magnes, 1990. Print. The Nabateans were polytheistic and worshipped a wide variety of local gods as well as Baalshamin, Isis, and Greco-Roman gods such as Tyche and Dionysus. They worshipped their gods at temples, high places, and betyls. They were mostly aniconic and preferred to decorate their sacred places with geometric designs. Much knowledge of the Nabataeans‚Äô grave goods has been lost due to extensive looting throughout history. They made sacrifices to their gods, performed other rituals and believed in an afterlife. Gods and goddesses Most of the deities in Nabataean religion were part of the pre-Islamic Arab pantheon, with the addition of foreign deities such as Isis and Atargatis. Dushara *Dushara, a Nabataean deity whose name means, \\"Lord of the Mountain\\", he was widely worshiped in Petra. Dushara is venerated as a supreme god by the Nabataeans, oftentimes he is referred as \\"Dushara and all the gods\\".Healey, John F. The Religion of the Nabataeans: A Conspectus. Leiden: EJ. Brill, 2001. He is considered the god of the Nabataean royal house. The fall of the Nabatean royal house to the Romans, caused the religion to be cast aside and its main deity lost. It was then that Dushara was associated with other gods, like Dionysus, Zeus, and Helios. * ManƒÅt, she was known as the goddess of fate, and was worshipped by the followers for rain and victory over enemies. She was the wife of god Hubal. * Allat, who is referred to as \\"the great goddess who is in Iram\\". She is widely known in Northern Arabia and Syria, the deity is associated with the goddess Athena in the Hawran. Allat is venerated in Palmyra, her temple had no sign of performing blood rituals. It is believed that Allat and Al-Uzza were once a single deity, which parted ways in the pre- Islamic Meccan tradition. Pre-Islamic Arabs believed that the goddesses Al- lƒÅt, Al-‚ÄòUzz√°, and ManƒÅt were the daughters of Allah though Nabataean inscriptions also describe her as Allah's wife instead. The Nabatean inscriptions also call her and Al-'Uzza as the \\"bride of Dushara\\". * Al-'Uzza, in Arabic her name is believed to mean \\"the mightiest one\\". She is venerated in the city of Petra. Her cult is mainly focused on the Quraysh and the Hurad valley north of Mecca. The goddess is connected with a type of betyl with star-like eyes. Al-'Uzza is associated with the Greco-Roman goddess Aphrodite. Pre-Islamic Arabs believed her to be one of the daughters of Allah alongside Al-lƒÅt and ManƒÅt. Alongside, Allat she is called the \\"bride of Dushara\\" in some Nabataean inscriptions. * Al-Kutbay, one of the lesser known deities of the Nabataeans. The deity is said to have a temple in Gaia and was also venerated in Iram. There is confusion when it comes to deciding whether this deity is masculine or feminine. In Gaia, the deity is believed to be female and is therefore called Al-Kutbay. There are instances when the deity is believed to be masculine, for example in Qusrawet in Egypt, and the deity is called Kutba. The majority of the evidence leads to believe that this deity is female, for there are betyls of Al-Kutba that are similar in design to those of Al-'Uzza. * Baalshamin, a Syrian deity who becomes a Nabataean god with the expansion of Nabataea into Southern Syria. His named means \\"Lord of Heaven\\", associating the deity with the skies. He is said to originate from the storm god Hadad, who was worshiped in Syria and Mesopotamia. As a deity that deals with the heavens, he is identified by many as a version of Zeus. There is a temple dedicated to Baalshamin at Si, which seems to have been the center of a pilgrimage. * Qos, an ancient Edomite deity, which was worshiped at Tannur. There's an association with the god Apollo and with lightning. * Hubal, A deity worshiped in the Ka'bah at Mecca. It is said followers would go to the deity seeking answers to questions of lineage, marriage, and death. A sacrifice would take place to honor the god, there would be seven arrows of divination, these would be thrown and the answer would be one of the carved words on the side of the arrows. * Manotu, this deity is mentioned on the tomb inscriptions at Hegra. Her name is mentioned alongside Dushara, and is used as a warning to their curse. She is believed to be the same as the goddess ManƒÅt of the Kaaba of Mecca who was one of the daughters of Allah. * Isis, foreign deity to the Nabataeans, she is originally an Egyptian goddess. She is represented by a throne at times. The goddess is seen in Petra's Khazneh, as well as the Temple of the Winged Lions. * Atargatis, she is a foreign deity to the Nabataeans, her cult center at Hierapolis and is venerated in Khirbet et- Tannur; she is referred to as the grain goddess and other times as the fish goddess.Alpass, Peter. Religions in the Graeco-Roman World, Leiden, NLD:Brill, 2013 She is seen seated between two lions at times. Atargatis is also connected to the betyl with star-like eyes. * Shay'-al-Qawn, believed to be the protector of caravans and soldiers, people that would travel. It is said that his followers disapproved of wine. * Obodat, believed to be a deified king of the Nabataeans, it is not clear whether this would be Obodas I, II, or III. His association with the royal family leads to believe that he had a private cult. * Tyche, Nabataean goddess, often accompanied by the zodiac signs found in Khirbet-et-Tannur. She is often depicted with wings, the walls of a city for a crown and holding horns of plenty.Glueck, Nelson. The Zodiac of Khirbet et-Tann√ªr. Boston, MA : American Schools of Oriental Research,1952 External influences on gods/goddesses The majority of the Nabataean gods were foreign; they were adopted by the Nabataeans. Many of the Nabataean deities were being connected with Greco-Roman gods and goddesses, especially during the time that Nabataea was under Roman influence. The goddess Isis, is an Egyptian deity that was not only seen in Nabataean religion but also Greek and Roman. The god Dushara is oftentimes mentioned as a version of Dionysius. The god Helios, and Eros are found in Nabataean temples as well. During Nabataea's annexation to the Romans, there were tombs that named Greco-Roman gods instead of Nabataean gods. There is a shift in religion after the annexation of Nabataean land. For example, in the temple of Qasr, Aphrodite/al-'Uzza and Dushara were worshipped. Relationships between the gods The relationships between the Nabataeans gods are not always clear due to the lack of evidence to support the different claims. There are times when gods and goddesses are paired as husband and wife in a certain region of the kingdom, while they may not be in another. The god Dushara is sometimes said to be the husband of Allat and in other instances he is the son of Allat. Another example would be Allat, Al-'Uzza and Manat, these three deities are said to be the daughters of the high god Allah. In some regions of the Nabataean kingdom, both Allat and Al-'Uzza are said to be the same goddess. Rituals and animals It is very likely that in the city of Petra, there were processional ways from temple to temple, such as the Qasr el-Bint temple, the Temple of the Winged Lions and the Great Temple. The main street flowed through the city making it possible for a processional way to have taken place. There are other processional ways that could have been linked to the so-called high-places, such as el-Madh-bah, by passing the \\"Roman Soldier\\" tomb, the \\"Garden Temple\\", the Lion monument, a rock-cut altar, before arriving at the high place. Nabataeans would visit the tombs of relatives and had ritual feasting and would fill the space with incense and perfumed oils. It is also very likely that there were goods left inside the tombs, a way of remembering those who passed away. Remains of unusual species like raptors, goats, rams, dogs were used in some of the rituals.Rawashdeh, Saeb. Ancient Nabataean rituals uncovered and explored at IFPO workshop. Jordan Times:23 Sept. 2015 It was also not uncommon to sacrifice camels to the ancient gods, especially the god Dushara. Sacred objects or animals *Niches - Described as miniature temples or adyton of a temple. They contain stone pillar or betyls that were carved out of rock. *Altars - At times the Nabataeans used altars as representation of the gods. *Sacred Animals - Eagles, serpents, phinxes, griffins and other mythological figures decorate the tombs of the ancient Nabataeans. *Iconoclasm - There is little evidence of Nabataean iconoclasm. The majority of the deities were portrayed as betyls, sometimes carved in relief and others would be carried around during processions. When the gods were depicted in human form, they would oftentimes were found as \\"eye-idol\\" betyls. Because of the Greco-Roman influence there are statues of Nabataean gods. The goddess Isis is represented in human form by the Nabataeans, this could be due to the fact that she is venerated in places like Egypt and Rome. The god Dushara is represented in both betyl and statue form throughout the Nabataean kingdom. Places of worship thumbnail The Nabataeans had numerous places for religious practice and cult worship. Known as ‚ÄúHigh places‚Äù, the shrines, temples, and altars would usually be open air structures placed atop nearby mountains. These places throughout the Nabataean kingdom would be dedicated to the worship of the same god(s), how they would go about this worship would vary from site to site. Offering would vary from material goods and foods, to live sacrifice of animals, maybe humans. The Nabataean kingdom can broke up into five religious regions each containing locations of religious significance: The Negev and Hejaz, The Hauran, Central Jordan, Southern Jordan, and finally Northwestern Saudi Arabia.Peterson, Stephanie. \\"The Cult of Dushara and the Roman Annexation of Nabataea.\\" Ma Thesis, McMaster, August, 2006. All of the religious sites at these locations are in varying states of preservation, making it difficult to know which deities would have been worshiped at specific shrines, altars, and temples. It is also difficult to know the specifics of the cult practices, meaning educated speculations can be made.Anderson,Bjo. Constructing Nabataea: Identity, Ideology, and Connectivity.

The Negev and Hejaz Sobata Located about 40k southwest from Beersheba is the city of Sobata, one of the major cities within the Nabataean kingdom. Very little archeological remains of any form of Nabataean cult worship, temples, shrines, or altars have been found. A small amount of evidence has been found for the worship of Dushara.Tholbecq L. (2007) ‚ÄúNabataean Monumental Architecture.‚Äù In: Politis KD (ed) The World of the Herods and the Nabataeans: An International Conference at the British Museum, 17‚Äì19 April 2001, 1033-144. Stuttgart: Franz Steiner Verlag. Oboda Located in the mountains southeast of Sobata. Religious practice here focused mostly on the deified King Oboda III, who gained fame from reclaimed lands in the Negev from Alexander Jannaeus, causing the formation of a ‚ÄúKing‚Äôs cult.‚Äù There are at least two documented Nabataean temple complex atop the acropolis. The smaller of the two being dedicated to the deified Obodas III. Rawwafah Located 300 km from Petra. A single temple in the Nabataean style has been discovered. The inscription on the lintel dates the temple to after the fall of the Nabataean kingdom. Mampsis A Nabataean site located about 81 km from Petra. Mampsis is an important stop on the Incense trade road. Nabataean style building, caravanserai, and water systems have been discovered here. The Hauran Bostra Located in southern Syria, and was the northern capital of the Nabataean kingdom. Bostra has evidence of temples being located at major intersections of the city. At the city center is a temple complex dedicated to Dushara-A‚Äôra. A‚Äôra is thought to be the god of Nabataean kings and city of Bostra itself. Modern building make it difficult to find archaeological evidence of Nabataean cult worship. An inscription that reads ‚ÄúThis is the wall which ... and windows which Taymu bar ... built for‚Ä¶Dushara and the rest of the gods of Bostra‚Äù is located on what is thought to be this temple. Seeia Located north of Bostra near Canatha. The settlement has three large temples, the largest is dedicated to Baalshamin. The two smaller temples are to unknown deities. One contains an inscription to the local goddess, Seeia, and may have been used to worship her. The temple complex is not Nabataean in design, but is an amalgamation of architectural building styles from the cultures on the northern Nabataean border. Sahr Temples similar in style to the ones located in Wadi Rumm, Dharih, Tannur, and Qasrawet. Sur Temples similar in style to the ones located in Wadi Rumm, Dharih, Tannur, and Qasrawet. Suweida Temples similar to those located near Petra in Wadi Rumm, Dharih, Tannur, and Qasrawet. Nabataean inscription indicate cults dedicated to Allat and Baalshamin. Central Jordan Khirbet Tannur Located in Central Jordan. The temple, High place, is located alone, atop the summit of Jebal Tannur. It is only accessible via a single, steep staircase pathway. The sites seclusion may indicate that it was of high religious importance to the Nabataeans. The doorway to the inner sanctuary of the temple is decorated with representations of vegetation, foliage, and fruits. Glueck identifies these as representing the Syrian goddess Atargatis. The inner sanctuary decorated with images of fruit, fishes, vegetation, thunderbolts, as well as representation of deities. Glueck attributes these iconographies to the Mesopotamian storm-god Hadad, but Tyche and Nike are also represented. Starckly notes that the only named god is the Edomite weather god, Qos. An inscription on a stele at the site names him as the god of Hurawa. Khirbet edh-Dharih Located 7 km south of Hurawa, the temple at Khirbet edh-Dharih is astonishingly well preserved. The temple complex is surrounded by an outer and inner courtyard, with a paved pathway to the porticoes. There are also has benches the form a theatron. The temple itself is divided into three sections, in a large open vestibule. From here is the cella, which was painted in rich, vibrant colors. At the back of the cella was the motab and betyl, a square podium flanked by stairs which was the seat of the divine. Despite its good condition, it is not known which god would have been worshipped here. Southern Jordan Petra Capital of the Nabataean Kingdom in around 312 BC. The city is famous for its marvelous rock-cut architecture. Located within the Shara Mountains, Dushara was the primary male god accompanied by the female trinity: Al-'Uzz√°, Allat, and ManƒÅt. A Stele dedicated to the Edomite god Qos is located within the city. Nabataeans worshiped pre-Islamic Arab gods and goddesses, along with deified kings, such as Obodas I. Temple layout and design shows influence from Rome, Greek, Egyptian, and Persian temple architecture. The temples of Qasr al-Bint and temple of the Winged Lion are examples of this. The podium within the Temple of the Winged Lion housed the altar, where sacrifices would have been made, or the betyl of the worshiped deity. Based on the idols and imagery found within the Temple of the Winged Lion, it is theorized to be dedicated to Dushara. The High Place is located atop the mountains that surround Petra. Used as a place for offering gifts and sacrificing animals, maybe humans, to the gods, The High place consists of a pool for collecting water, two altars, and a large open courtyard. Hawara Temple with 20m long processional way which leads to a courtyard with a view of Jebel Qalkha. The design of the Betyls as well as the remains of offering points to the possible worship of Dushara, maybe even Jupiter. Wadi Ramm thumbnail Temple to Allat. Rock sanctuary to Ayn esh- Shallaleh located behind temple to Allat. Betyls and cult niches to Dushara and Baalshamin. Northwestern Saudi Arabia Hegra thumbnail A Cult ritual circle on top of the mountain Jibel Ithlib rests on a rocky outcropping. Small betyls and cult niches to other gods appear around the Jibel Ithlib site. Inscription of ‚ÄúLord of the Temple,‚Äù may refer to Dushara. Marseha cults located here. Today Hegra is known as Mada‚Äôin Saleh. Processional ways The processional way that would lead to the places of worship would vary from site to site. Some places would be bargain rock, lacking any decorated on the processional way. While others, like Petra, would have carvings, monuments, sculpture, betyls, and occasionally obelisks lining the processional way. Petra‚Äôs processional way consists of a lion relief known as the Lion Fountain, there is also the Garden Tomb, and the Nabataean Quarry, two standing obelisks in an Indian style. Temple layout Nabataean temples vary greatly in design with no single standard layout. The Nabataeans adopted and adapted different elements of the temple designs from the cultures that they traded with. Indian, Greek, Roman, Persian, Egyptian, and Syrian elements of temple design can be seen to varying degrees of incorporation. Betyls Nabataean betyl Betyls are blocks of stone which represent the gods of the Nabataeans. The term ‚Äúbetyl‚Äù derives from the Greek ŒíŒ±ŒπœÑœçŒªŒπŒ± and a myth the Greeks told of Ouranos who created animated stones that fell from heaven.Wenning, Robert. ‚ÄúThe Betyls of Petra‚Äù. Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research 324 (2001): 79‚Äì95. Betyls were commonly placed on altars or platforms and religious rituals were performed there. Infrequently, betyls have been found in tombs.Wenning, Robert. ‚ÄúDecoding Nabataean Betyls.‚Äù Proceedings of the 4th International Congress of the Archaeology of the Ancient Near East, 29 March ‚Äì 3 April 2004 1 (2008): 613‚Äì619. Print. Dr. Gustaf Dalman was the first to classify the many different types of betyls. The different types of betyls according to Dr. Dalman: #Plain betyls ##Rectangular slab (Pfeiler, block, stela) ## High rectangular slab with a rounded top ## Semicircular or hemispherical slab #Dome-shaped spherical betyl (squat omphalos, ovoid) #Eye betyls betyls #Face stelae Eye betyls and face stelae are of interest to scholars due to the inconsistency in what is largely understood as Nabataean aniconism. There is debate on whether the betyls were viewed as containers for gods or if they were seen as representations of the gods themselves.Healey, John F. ‚ÄúImages and Rituals.‚Äù The Religion of the Nabataeans: A Conspectus. Boston: Brill, 2001. 154‚Äì157. Print. Grooves in the floors of niches and holes in the tops of altars have led to the conclusion that betyls may have been stored for safe-keeping then transported to the worship site. Rituals Offerings Offerings of libations (most probably wine) and incense played an important role in Nabataean communal worship. There are speculations that the Nabataeans offered oils or perhaps other goods but the only definite offerings are libations and incense. Strabo confirms that libations and frankincense were offered daily to the sun (Dushara).Healey, John F. ‚ÄúImages and Rituals.‚Äù The Religion of the Nabataeans: A Conspectus. Boston: Brill, 2001. 169‚Äì175. Print. There is also evidence of silver and gold offerings to gods, but the text this is found in is not clear on if this could be a tithe. Sacrifices Sacrifices of animals were common and Porphyry‚Äôs De Abstenentia reports that, in Dumat Al-Jandal, a boy was sacrificed annually and was buried underneath an altar. Some scholars have extrapolated this practice to the rest of the Nabataeans. Specific dates There are few primary sources regarding religious festivals the Nabataeans celebrated. It has been noted that the presence of two inscriptions to Dushara-A‚Äôra dated in the month of Nisan could indicate a spring festival. Funerary rituals Meaning of tomb architecture The famous rock-cut tombs of the Nabataeans were not decorated just for show, they were meant to be comfortable homes for the dead. Like the Egyptians, the Nabataeans believed that the deceased lived on and must be fed after death. Therefore, those who could afford to placed gardens for entertainment and eating halls for feasting around their tombs. Eagles‚Äîthe symbol of Dushara‚Äîwere sometimes carved above doorways for protection. Curses Many tombs were fashioned with inscriptions that conveyed who was meant to be buried in the tomb, as well as communicated the social status and piety of the owner. Inscriptions on tombs became popular throughout Nabataea. They list actions (e.g. selling or mortgaging the tomb, etc.) that should not be undertaken as well as detail fines and punishments for those who ignore curses etched into the inscriptions on the face of the tomb. The curses detailed in the inscriptions are often formulaic, e.g. ‚Äúand the curse of [insert name of god] on anyone who reads this inscription and does not say [insert blessing or other phrase]‚Äù. The inscriptions of Mada'in Saleh and other large Nabataean cities name both the owners and curses as well as the types of people who are supposed to be buried in the tomb. Petran tombs, however, besides the Tomb of Sextius Florentinus, the Turkmaniyah Tomb and other exceptions, did not have inscriptions.Wadeson, Lucy. ‚ÄúNabataean Tomb Complexes At Petra: New Insights in the Light of Recent Fieldwork.‚Äù (2011): n. pag. Web. 11‚Äì25 2015. . Concepts of the afterlife Little is known about how the Nabataeans viewed the afterlife, but assumptions have been made based on the material goods they left behind. Since tombs and grave goods remain a valuable link to understanding the lives of any ancient culture, import is placed on the layout of the tombs at Petra, Bosra, Mada'in Saleh and other prominent cities. Known grave goods include an alabaster jug found at Mamphis and assorted vessels left over from funerary feasts.Perry, Megan A. \\"Life and Death in Nabataea: The North Ridge Tombs and Nabataean Burial Practices.\\" Near Eastern Archaeology65.4 (2002): 265-270. ATLA Religion Database with ATLASerials. Web. 16 Nov. 2015. Based on the emphasis placed on familial burial niches, dining halls, and grave goods the Nabataeans thought the afterlife was a place where you could eat and be merry with your friends and family.

The vessel also served on the Columbia River. Cowlitz was in service from 1917 until September 1931, when, not far from The Dalles, Oregon, it sank in the Columbia river in a storm. Construction Cowlitz was built at Portland, Oregon in 1917. Cowlitz was constructed by the Portland Shipbuilding Company for Milton Smith (1874‚Äì1951) doing business as the Columbia & Cowlitz River Transportation Company. During construction, there was a strike at the Portland Shipbuilding company 24 men walked off the job when the company manager, Charles Nelson, refused to reinstate an employee who had been recently discharged. There was talk that the men would also demand an increase of pay from $4 per day to $5 days per day. Marine carpenters were then in demand because of a boom in wooden shipping construction. Work on the vessel was completed by March 8, 1917, and on that date the steamer was issued an inspection certificate. Dimensions and engineering Cowlitz was 109.2 feet long exclusive of the fantail, which was the extension over the stern on which the stern-wheel was mounted. The vessel's width, called beam, was 26.6 feet, exclusive of the protective timbers, called guards, extending out from the hull at the level of the main deck. Cowlitzs depth of hold was 4.8 feet. The overall size was 99 gross and 72 registered tons, which were units of volume, not weight. The twin horizontally mounted single cylinder steam engines developed 350 indicated horsepower. The official merchant vessel registry number was 214769. The cargo capacity was 100 tons. Cowlitz was equipped with two horizontal non-condensing engines, each with a 14-inch bore and a 6-foot stroke, producing 390 estimated horsepower. Reduction in measured tonnage By 1919, the sides of the lower deck had been removed; this was a means to bring the ship's measured size below 100 tons. This permitted a reduction in the required crew by one less officer (mate) position. Operations Service (center), Cowlitz (center), and Nestor (right), tied up at a dock, probably at Rainier, Oregon, some time between 1917 and 1929. In June 1917, the newly built Cowlitz took the place of another steamer owned by Milton Smith, the Nestor on the Cowlitz River run, while Nestor was taken to a shipyard in Oregon for a thorough overhaul. On December 2, 1921, the steamer La Center, en route from Kelso with a load of cattle for the Portland stockyards, capsized in a storm. Thirty-five of the 40 head of cattle on board were drowned. Cowlitz however was able to rescue the crewman of La Center. In early December 1922, Earl Weir, then age 26, and pilot of the Cowlitz, was arrested by the Portland police, and charged with complicity in a murder of a 15-year-old girl by his father, with the killing said to have occurred on his father's houseboat in the Willamette river. The specific charge against Weir was that he had helped his father conceal the body. On September 12, 1928, Jack Alfred, a crewman on Cowlitz, was injured while making fast a line from a log raft. Alfred brought an action against Smith Transportation Company, the owners of the Cowlitz, in the U.S. District Court, seeking $15,000 in damages. On April 16, 1929, Judge George M. Bourquin gave a directed verdict for Smith Transportation Company, ruling that no negligence had been established by Alfred and the only negligence that had been shown was that of Alfred himself. Rescue work at the Allen Street bridge disaster Cowlitz rescued survivors when the Cowlitz River bridge at Kelso, Washington collapsed on January 3, 1923 in what became known as the Allen Street Bridge disaster. Cowlitz picked up nine survivors on the steamer's first trip, including a small boy, but three or four others drifted by clinging to wreckage, but the steamer was unable to reach them. According to one survivor, A.J. Bryant, who had been driving an automobile across the bridge at the time of the collapse: Part of the Shaver fleet Capt. Milton Smith (1874‚Äì1951), long-term owner of Cowlitz. In February 1930, Milton Smith's company, Smith Transportation, which had been incorporated in 1926, merged with the Shaver Transportation Company. The president of the new organization would be Capt. Delmar Shaver and the vice-president would be Capt. Milton Smith. The headquarters of the merged company would be in Portland, at the foot of Fessenden Street in St. Johns. Sale and transfer to Columbia Gorge service Cowlitz depicted in The Oregonian, September 1930 In early September 1930, Cowlitz was purchased from the Shaver Transportation Company by the Columbia River Navigation Company. The new owners placed Cowlitz on a route on the Columbia River, running under J.W. Exon, as captain, between Portland, Hood River, White Salmon, and The Dalles. Exon had organized the Columbia River Navigation Company and was its president. The first trip on the route was made on September 8, 1930, with the boat departing from Supple's Dock in Portland, at the foot of Belmont Street, at 7:00 p.m. Captain Exon's business plan was to charge rates lower than rail transport, and match truck rates. Reportedly the demand for steamer services was so great by September 1930 that it would probably be necessary for the line to purchase another steamboat in the near future. Freight was to be picked up, hauled to the dock by trucks, and delivered to the consignee when the boat reached a landing. Sinking On July 30, 1931, Cowlitz departed The Dalles at 11:40 am, with Captain Exon and 11 members of the crew. While proceeding down river from The Dalles, Oregon, with a full load of 100 tons of wheat on board, Cowlitz encountered a 25-mile per hour headwind and large waves. The wind from the west was described as the worst on the river in years. Water flooded the engine room. Captain Exon tried to turn the boat towards shore, but then another wave hit, reportedly causing the cargo to shift. The steamer then capsized so suddenly that only two men were able to grab life preservers. About five miles west of The Dalles, the boat sank in about 50 feet of water. Only a few of the men could swim. The boat came to pieces, with the hull sinking almost immediately and the superstructure floating free. All the members of the crew were able to survive, by hanging on to the floating wreckage, although some were in the water for more than an hour. Acting as chief engineer on Cowlitz at the time was George E. McClure, who had been an engineer on northwest steamers since 1878. Some of the many vessels McClure had served on were Altona, Leona, Pomona, Lurline, Harvest Queen and T.J. Potter. This was to have been McClure's last trip as an engineer, and he was making the voyage as a favor to Captain Exton. Captain Exon was then 68 years old, and his grandson, George Kitzmiller, was serving as acting mate. Kitzmiller, a cousin of the well-known University of Oregon football player Johnny Kitzmiller, had donned a live preserver when he first noticed the boat in trouble. Captain Exon went into the river when the boat capsized, but his grandson was able to save him. No one was drowned, largely because of the amount of wreckage, including spars, stove wood, oil drums and other loose articles, that the men could cling on to. The Rowena ferry launched a boat to rescue the men, and a motorist on the highway, who witnessed the capsize, found a telephone and placed calls to Rowena and The Dalles for assistance. Both the boat and the cargo were fully covered by insurance.

As such, Afrophobia is distinct from the historical racial phenomenon of negrophobia, which is specifically based on contempt for negro peoples. The opposite of Afrophobia is Afrophilia, which is a love for all things pertaining to Africa. By location It has been observed that writing and terminology about racism, including about Afrophobia, has been somewhat U.S.-centric. In 2016, Afrophobia has been used as a term for racism against darker-skinned persons in China. In such usage Afrophobia is an inexact term, because the racism is directed against darker-skinned persons from anywhere, without regard to any connection to Africa. Conversely, Chinese views for lighter-than-average skin are more positive, as reflected in advertising. (posted originally at The Conversation, with title Of washing powder, Afrophobia and racism in China, August 11, 2016) Activism To overcome any perceived \\"Afrophobia\\", writer Langston Hughes suggested that European Americans must achieve peace of mind and accommodate the uninhibited emotionality of African Americans. Author James Baldwin similarly recommended that White Americans could quash any \\"Afrophobia\\" on their part by getting in touch with their repressed feelings, empathizing to overcome their \\"emotionally stunted\\" lives, and thereby overcome any dislike or fear of African Americans. In 2016, Tess Asplund made a viral protest against Neo-Nazism as part of her activism against Afrophobia. In academia Some afrophobic sentiments are based on the belief that Africans are unsophisticated. Such perceptions include the belief that Africans lack a history of civilization, and visual imagery of such stereotypes perpetuate the notion that Africans still live in mudhuts and carry spears along with other notions which indicate their primitiveness. Afrophobia in academia may also occur through the practise of oversight with regards to lacking deconstruction in mediums such as African art forms, omittance of historical African polities within world cartography, or by promoting a eurocentric viewpoint by ignoring historic African contributions to world civilization.

Production and release In December 2014, while the Daddies were still touring behind the release of Please Return the Evening, performing concerts showcasing both their own repertoire and the songs of the Rat Pack, singer-songwriter Steve Perry posted a blog to the band's official Facebook page discussing his future plans to explore another facet of the band's swing and jazz influences in a live setting, covering a time period of roughly 1928-1937. In what he called his own \\"Steve speak\\", Perry dubbed this musical time period as \\"the era of the Boop-A-Doop\\", likely alluding to the popular 1931 song \\"Don't Take My Boop-Oop-A-Doop Away\\", though \\"boop a doo\\" appears as a lyric in the 1935 showtune \\"Lullaby of Broadway\\" (\\"The hi dee hi and boop a doo/The lullaby of Broadway\\"), which was ultimately recorded for the album. In a series of Twitter updates, Perry confirmed that The Boop-A-Doo would start recording on March 10, 2015 at Gung Ho Studios in Eugene, where the Daddies had recorded all of their studio albums since their 1990 debut Ferociously Stoned. He wrote that the band approached the album \\"as if we were recording directly onto a wax cylinder\\", making extensive use of vintage pre-1940 instruments and using the banjo as the primary chordal instrument. In September, it was revealed that the album art had been completed by longtime Daddies artist Wayne Shellabarger, and final mixing of the album began in October. Similar to Please Return the Evening, the Daddies began selling copies of The Boop-A-Doo at their live shows prior to formally announcing the album's release, starting with a December 11 show at the W.O.W.

The gray cap is convex and irregular with a dry surface. Underneath the cap are white pores. The stout stipe is the same colour as the cap. Distribution and habitat Boletopsis grisea is found in Europe, and in both Canada and the United States, growing on nutrient-poor acidic soils. It has a mycorrhizal association with Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), as well as lichens and heath plants as understorey. Status B. grisea is a threatened species in Europe, where it has been short-listed for inclusion in the Berne Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats by the European Council for Conservation of Fungi. It has been recorded from 15 countries, and appears on five Regional Red Lists. Threats to the fungus include deforestation, air pollution, and the use of fertilizers and lime used to increase timber production.

The film premiered at the Sandusky State Theater on July 11, 2015 and was released as a streaming video through Amazon on July 21. The film was inspired by the urban legend by the same name in Northern Ohio. Filming took place in a classic revival mansion in Scottdale, Pennsylvania. Lapisardi and Knotts were inspired to create the film after researching the legend of the Gore Orphanage and wondering why it hadn't been adapted into a film. In February 2015 Gore Orphanage was named the most anticipated film of 2015 in the Horror Society Awards, which is judged based on reader votes.  Synopsis  Nellie (Emma Smith) is a young orphan that has arrived at an orphanage run by Mrs. Pryor (Maria Olsen), a cruel woman who only sees the facility as a way to earn money. To make matters worse, the orphanage's maintenance man (Bill Townsend) appears to be even more depraved than she is. However, not all is bad, as Nellie is able to make a few friends, including Miss Lillian (Keri Maletto), who helps run the orphanage. However, as her stay lengthens, Nellie begins to realize that she may not leave the orphanage alive.

It goes almost dry in the summer season, and the stream is reduced to a trickle.  Etymology  According to folklore, the pit (kund) at the bottom of the falls goes as deep as patal (the underworld in Indian mythology).

Background Lead singer Z Berg told Entertainment Weekly, \\"The time before we started making this music was kind of uncertain, and we had been playing music together as JJAMZ for years and years. As much as I love that record and that music, there was no real concept or direction for it. When it came time to think about how we move forward, we didn‚Äôt have the foundational structure to know where to go next.\\" In a separate interview for Nylon she explained, \\"None of us were in a great place. I wanted to move out of L.A., and I didn't know if we were going to play music together. Then this music really brought us back together and strengthened our friendship and our excitement as a band.\\" Berg told Artistdirect that the band's new sound came about from co-producer Alex Greenwald making recordings in his house: \\"He sort of sequestered himself in his house ... and learned how to record music. He recorded on Garage Band and an outdated version at that. He just became this electronic recording wizard. That's where we started.\\" When Berg heard Greenwald's experimental recordings, \\"It sounded like weird, future spaceship music, from a very old spaceship. I thought, 'Alright, whatever happens, let‚Äôs at least work on this and make songs for fun, without thinking where they go or who they‚Äôre for.'\\" The group then wrote and jammed in Greenwald's home, silently projecting visually interesting films like Tron and Total Recall on the walls for inspiration. Critical reception Neil Z. Yeung of Allmusic wrote, \\"Even though this is their second release as a band, Phases' debut sounds little like JJAMZ.

Randers Library is the main public library in Randers Municipality, Denmark. It is in the Kulturhuset (The House of Culture) and consists of the main library in Randers, a mobile library and three other libraries around the municipality. From 1 January 2007 the name was changed from Randersegnens Libraries to the Randers Library. Randersegnens Libraries were a library association between N√∏rhald, Purhus, Randers, Rougs√∏ and S√∏nderhald Municipalities in the period from 1970 to the end of 2006.  History  In 1862 the first public library in Randers was established with free access. The library, which was driven by volunteers, had as mission statement: \\"to provide city impecunious inhabitants free access to the reading of edifying, instructive or entertaining books.\\" There were 488 volumes in the library in 1862. By 1915, there were nearly 5000 volumes and 455 patrons. By 1925, the number of patrons and books doubled, while lending figure was tripled. From 1862 to 1897 the library was located in a room downtown. In 1897 the library moved to a room in the restored Hellig√•ndshuset. In November 1927, at the association's 65th birthday, the library was taken over by Randers town municipality. A contemporary mobile library was put into use in 1938.

It is based on the memoir The Taliban Shuffle: Strange Days in Afghanistan and Pakistan by Kim Barker. The film stars Tina Fey, Margot Robbie, Martin Freeman, Christopher Abbott, Alfred Molina, and Billy Bob Thornton. It was released on March 4, 2016, by Paramount Pictures. It received mixed reviews from critics who praised the acting, but criticized the predictable screenplay and execution. The movie was a box office failure, grossing only $24.9 million against its $35 million budget. Plot In 2003 New York City, Kim Barker (Tina Fey) is a television journalist who is dissatisfied with the state of her career covering low-profile stories. She decides to take a short assignment as a war correspondent in Afghanistan during Operation Enduring Freedom, to the disappointment of her boyfriend Chris (Josh Charles), who spends a lot of time traveling. Assigned to low-budget living quarters with other international journalists, she develops a friendship with noted BBC correspondent Tanya Vanderpoel (Margot Robbie) and lecherous Scottish freelance photographer Iain MacKelpie (Martin Freeman). After a period of adjustment, aided by her Afghan \\"fixer\\" Fahim Ahmadzai (Christopher Abbott), she begins taking well to the assignment. She elicits frank remarks on camera from soldiers questioning the value of their assignment there and puts herself in harm's way to capture combat incidents on video. American Marine commander General (previously Colonel) Hollanek (Billy Bob Thornton) sees her as an inexperienced nuisance. Despite the danger, Kim stays in Afghanistan for months, then years, beyond her original assignment. She catches Chris unprepared with a middle-of-the-night video call and finds him with another woman, ending their relationship. Against her better judgment, she begins a sexual relationship with Iain, which over time also develops into a more personal one. Although her status as a woman presents challenges in an Afghan Islamic society which places restrictive roles on women, she also uses it to her advantage. Kim gains access to women in a village who explain that they've been sabotaging the US-built well because they welcome the daily walk to the river away from the men. She also walks a tightrope, taking advantage of the thinly-veiled sexual interest of Afghan Attorney General Ali Massoud Sadiq (Alfred Molina) to use him as a source. Fahim ‚Äì who treated opium addicts before the war ‚Äì cautions her, pointing out that danger can be like a drug. Despite their mutual friendliness, Kim remains in competition with other journalists for stories and resources from their employers back home. After three years in Afghanistan, Kim flies to New York to argue for more support from her network's new boss, only to discover that Tanya is slated to take over from her. Meanwhile, Iain is kidnapped for ransom while traveling cross- country to cover a developing story that he had earlier offered to bring Kim in on. She returns \\"home\\" to Afghanistan, where she blackmails her \\"special friend\\", Ali, for information about Iain's whereabouts, and impresses upon Hollanek the political value to him of rescuing Iain. The mission ‚Äì accompanied by Kim's cameraman ‚Äì is a success, both militarily and journalistically. However, shortly after Iain's rescue Kim becomes disillusioned with both her tentative relationship and her station. She then bids farewell to her colleagues and Fahim and returns to the U.S. to stay. After returning, she looks up a Marine (Evan Jonigkeit) who was transferred, apparently because of his on-camera comments to her, and subsequently lost both of his legs to an IED. She tries to apologize for the consequences of her actions, but he refuses to let her take the blame. She moves on to an on- camera desk job, where she finds herself interviewing Iain, who is going to be in New York soon as part of a tour for his new book, and who invites her to meet him for coffee.

The Stingray's inaugural Big V season saw them finish fourth in the regular season with a 12‚Äì8 record before losing 2‚Äì0 to the Ringwood Hawks in the semi-finals. They were led by American import Eric Williams, and Australians Jason Reardon, Stefan Osborne and Paul Hutchison. In 2013, the Stingrays finished in third place with a 14‚Äì4 record and reached the grand final series, where they defeated the Hawks 2‚Äì0 to win the Big V championship.

He contributed to reporting that won The New York Times a Pulitzer Prize for its investigation of the Eliot Spitzer prostitution scandal. Early life Born in Cape Town, South Africa, Kovaleski spent his early childhood in Sydney, Australia, until his family moved to New York City in the 1970s. His father, Fred Kovaleski, was a spy for the Central Intelligence Agency in the 1950s. He graduated in 1984 from the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, with a degree in philosophy. After receiving his bachelor's degree, Kovaleski studied French philosophy at the Sorbonne in Paris. His travels through Europe before the fall of the Berlin Wall inspired him to become a journalist. Career Kovaleski began his journalism career in the mid-1980s at The Miami News. He then worked for the New York Daily News, The Washington Post, and Money magazine. He joined The New York Times in July 2006 as an investigative and general assignment reporter on the Metro desk. He joined the Culture desk as an investigative journalist in 2014, and moved to the National desk in 2016. Awards In 2009, Kovaleski received a Pulitzer Prize for \\"Breaking News Reporting.\\" In 2016, he and Nicholas Kulish, Christopher Drew, Mark Mazzetti, Matthew Rosenberg, Sean D. Naylor and John Ismay received a George Polk Award for their investigation into allegations that members of the U.S. Navy SEAL Team Six abused Afghan detainees.  Comments by Donald Trump In a speech at a November 24, 2015, rally in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, presidential candidate Donald Trump claimed that \\"thousands and thousands of people were cheering\\" in Jersey City, New Jersey, as the World Trade Center collapsed. After this claim was questioned, the Trump campaign referred to a September 18, 2001, Washington Post article that Kovaleski had co-authored with Fredrick Kunkle, as substantiation of the claim. According to the article, \\"law enforcement authorities detained and questioned a number of people who were allegedly seen celebrating the attacks and holding tailgate-style parties on rooftops while they watched the devastation.\\" Kovaleski issued the following written statement in response to the Trump campaign's adoption of his report as an independent verification of New Jersey-based celebrations following the destruction of the World Trade Center: > \\"I certainly do not remember anyone saying that thousands or even hundreds > of people were celebrating. That was not the case, as best as I can > remember.\\" In apparent response to this written statement, Trump said in a November 25, 2015, speech in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina: \\"You've got to see this guy: 'Uhh, I don't know what I said. Uhh, I don't remember,' he's going like 'I don't remember. Maybe that's what I said.'\\" Trump bent his wrist and flailed his arms repeatedly as he spoke, drawing laughter from the audience. The incident drew widespread domestic and international criticism. Trump was severely criticized worldwide for mocking Kovaleski's disability.

Following domestic and international condemnation, Trump said that he was not mocking Kovaleski's disability because he did not know what Kovaleski looked like. Kovaleski has said that while reporting on Trump for the New York Daily News, the two had been on a first-name basis and had met face-to-face on a dozen occasions, including interviews and press conferences in the late 1980s. That the two knew each other was corroborated by multiple other witnesses.  Meryl Streep speech  During her January 8, 2017, acceptance speech at the Golden Globe Award ceremony, actress Meryl Streep referred to the incident as \\"one performance this year that stunned me\\". Streep said: > It sank its hooks in my heart. Not because it was good; there was nothing > good about it. But it was effective and it did its job.

N. Bruce Hazen and Marvin Robinson were the two principle architects and founders of the firm. Together they created buildings that till this day shape the landscape of downtown Lincoln Nebraska, the Nebraska State Capitol, and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, one of the largest universities in the American Midwest. Additionally, they did many historic home districts in Lincoln. The firms‚Äô modernist approach to design was reflected in their design. This is most noticeable in their partnership with Philip Johnson on the Sheldon Art Gallery, and other buildings including, the Kimball Auditorium, Westbrook Music Hall and Pershing Auditorium.  N. Bruce Hazen  N. Bruce Hazen was born in Peoria, Illinois on March 13, 1897, to his mother, Elisha Brewster Hazen-Agnes McGill. He attended Peoria High School, and studied at Bradley Polytechnic Institute (Bradly University) from 1915-1917. He continued his education at the University of Pennsylvania until 1918, where he then joined the United States Navy to fight in World War I. He returned to Illinois in 1919 to earn a B.A. in Architecture from the University of Illinois, and graduated in 1922. While attending he was a part of the Delta Sigma Phi Fraternity. Bruce Hazen began his career working as a draftsman for JW Roy Urbana III from 1919 to 1921. In 1922, Hazen began work at the Peoria-based firm Hewitt & Emerson. Hazen then moved to Lincoln, Nebraska where he worked as an architect and draftsman for Davis and Wilson. Hazen's most important work early in his career was his involvement in the Woodshire development in Lincoln, Nebraska. Hazen was the most prolific architect of the Woodsshire development and has ten home designs to his credit during that time. Although his firm was later known for modernism, he designed in a variety of period revival styles, including the popular Colonial Revival. He married Sidna Nutting Smith on the 26th of June, 1937. Hazen was known to have hobbies of gardening, stamp collecting, and hunting. He retired from architecture in 1976. Bruce Hazen died on May 23, 1991.  Marvin Robinson  Marvin Lee Robinson had a position on the board of directors of the Nebraska Art Association, and was a former president of the Nebraska chapter of American Institute of Architects. Robinson was a Lowell Palmer Fellow in Architecture at Princeton University. Robinson retired from architecture in 1967, and died in 1970.  Hazen and Robinson (1947- 1967)  Hazen and Robinson was founded in 1947 in Lincoln, Nebraska. The firm was one of the most prominent architectural firms in Nebraska in the immediate time post World War II. Hazen and Robinson amassed a large portfolio of work around Lincoln and southeast Nebraska. The architecture that they produced was mostly considered modern. After their work with Philip Johnson on the Sheldon Art Gallery, they also completed some projects in the International Style, which Johnson was famous for. They practiced until 1967, when Marvin Robinson retired. After that, Bruce Hazen practiced with some local architects until his retirement in 1976.  Notable work  Hazen and Robinson's most notable impact was on the campus of the University of Nebraska. They are credited with the design of the Kimball Recital Hall, Westbrook Music Building, Woods Art Building, and the Canfield Administration building. They also worked directly with Philip Johnson on constructing the Sheldon Art Gallery, which is also located at the University of Nebraska. It is considered one of the architects most accomplished projects, in the vein of modernism informed by classicism. Through their collaboration with Johnson they drew inspiration from his work while designing the Woods Art Building, located adjacent to the Sheldon. After the completion of the Woods Art Building, Hazen and Robinson also were contributing architects on the sculpture garden between the Woods and Sheldon. They completed their major contribution the campus‚Äôs art quad by designing the Kimball Recital Hall and the Westbrook Music Hall. The Kimball‚Äôs design is an acoustical marvel to this day. Hazen and Robin was one of 15 architectural and engineering firms that partnered in the design of the Pershing Auditorium in downtown Lincoln. they also designed the Bennett Martin Public Library in downtown Lincoln. One of their most notable works outside of Lincoln was their design of the Beatrice State Hospital, in Beatrice, Nebraska.

ZM Waikato (also known as 89.8ZM) is contemporary hit radio network in Hamilton, New Zealand. It is owned by New Zealand Media and Entertainment, and broadcasts via FM, and worldwide via the Internet. The network targets the 15‚Äì39 demographic specialises in a chart- music playlist of pop, rock, hip hop and dance music. History The ZM station in the Waikato region has its origins as an independently owned station called 898FM and later part of an early incarnation of The Breeze and finally became part of the ZM network after the station was sold to The Radio Network. 898FM and Kiwi FM 898FM was started in 1984 broadcasting on 89.8FM with the call sign 1JJJ. The original station played a Contemporary hit radio format. 898FM broadcast from Mount Te Aroha with the station boasting the greatest FM coverage area in New Zealand, the station could be heard throughout the Waikato region including Coromandel Peninsula, King Country and Taupo and in the Western Bay of Plenty region including Tauranga, Mt. Maunganui and Rotorua. In 1986 898FM became known as 89.8 Kiwi FM and later Kiwi FM, this station has no connection to the Kiwi FM network stations that operated between 2005 and 2015. The Breeze 89.8FM Throughout the 1990s the station changed ownership several times. In 1993 Kiwi FM in Waikato, 91FM Auckland and Radio Windy were all rebranded as The Breeze. All three stations continued to operate as local stations and in Waikato this station was known as The Breeze on 89.8. The Auckland station The Breeze on 91 and Waikato The Breeze on 89.8 ran a Hot AC format which the slogan Not Too Heavy, Not Too Soft. The Wellington station ran an Easy Listening format. 89.8ZM By 1996 the station was owned by Prospect Media Limited which operated 11 stations in Auckland and Waikato including Easy Listening i and Radio Hauraki. In late 1996 Prospect Media was purchased by The Radio Network. In early 1997 Auckland station The Breeze on 91 and The Breeze on 89.8 in Waikato were closed down. A new ZM station was started in Auckland as 91ZM Auckland on the 91.0FM frequency. In Waikato the 89.8FM frequency was used to start ZM as 89.8ZM with all programming initially originating from the 91ZM Auckland studios with announcers producing local pre-recorded voice breaks for the Waikato audience, giving the illusion of a local show. ZM in Invercargill and Dunedin used a similar method to receive network programming from 91ZM Christchurch. In 1998 the 93ZM Whangarei breakfast announcers Jaala Dyer and Sandy Antipas moved to Hamilton and began producing a local breakfast show for Waikato with the show networked back to Whangarei. Outside breakfast the station continued to network from 91ZM Auckland. In 2000 the local breakfast show was discontinued with 89.8ZM and 93ZM Whangarei now taking the Auckland-based network breakfast at the same time ZM switched to a single network feed with the local voice breaks dropped in favour of a single live voice break heard on almost all ZM stations. Originally 89.8ZM broadcast from Mount Te Aroha with coverage reaching all of the Waikato and the Bay of Plenty, in the early 2000s this was changed to broadcasting from two separate transmitters, Ruru east of Hamilton and Kopukairua in Tauranga, allowing the Bay of Plenty listeners to hear local advertising and local information such as weather separate from the Waikato listeners but both stations remained on 89.8 MHz. In 2010, the Bay of Plenty frequency was changed from 89.8 FM to 89.4 FM.

Facts Schmidberger, who ran a trucking company, claimed damages for loss caused by a protest group that had prevented it taking goods to Austria by lorry. Transitforum Austria Tirol organised a demonstration to block the Brenner Autobahn, A13, a transit between Northern Europe and Italy. It did so for 30 hours, in protest against the environment and health problems from the increase in movement of heavy goods on the motorway. Judgment The Court of Justice held that Austria's failure to ban the demonstration infringed article 34 and 35, and TEU art 4(3). However this was justified by the fundamental right of demonstrators to freedom of expression and assembly under the ECHR, national constitution and principles that were an integral part of EU law. Human rights were a fundamental principle in EU law, and free expression and association among the 'fundamental pillars of a democratic society'. They could only be restricted if 'the restrictions in fact correspond to objectives of general interest and do not, taking account of the aim of the restrictions, constitute disproportionate and unacceptable interference, impairing the very substance of the rights guaranteed.‚Äô See also *European Union law References External links Court of Justice of the European Union case law European Union goods case law ","title":"Schmidberger v Austria"},{"id":"48663173","text":"Peniarth 109 is a Welsh manuscript from the second half of the 15th century (c. 1425 - c. 1490), in the hand of the poet Lewis Glyn Cothi. It is part of the Peniarth Manuscripts Collection at the National Library of Wales.Dafydd Johnston (gol.), Gwaith Lewys Glyn Cothi (Gwasg Prifysgol Cymru, 1995). Rhagymadrodd, t. xxviii. The parchment manuscript measures 238 x 99 mm, and includes 96 leaves. It is an autograph by Lewis Glyn Cothi, one of the greatest poets of the Nobility, which contains 106 poems. The manuscript is decorated with many illustrations, some in colour, of a noble family crests Welsh, a fact that is testament to the poet's interest in heraldry and genealogy. It is possible that it was produced in honour of Lord William Herbert (d. 1469), founder of the family of Herbert, as an ode to him is found in the early volumes, with another ode to his brother Richard following. There is no music that can be dated to the 1480s in the collection. The latest datable poems belong to the late 1470s, and it is fair to conclude that the manuscript was completed around this date.
