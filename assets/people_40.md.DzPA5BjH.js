History After the building of Edilnord, in the south of Brugherio it was in need to provide religious care to the residents of the new district. So, on spacious grounds donated by Cazzaniga family, it was built a pastoral center auxiliary to the main parish. At first, the community gathered in a large hall where all the sacred vessels were placed and which was perceived by the faithful more and more like a real church. In 1971, with the official recognition of the community as a parish, the first parish priest, Father Michele Raffo, came. In 1991 the renovations began, giving to the building the appearance of a church, both inside and outside. Architecture When the building was renovated, the most important and significant project concerned the chancel: the French sculptress Marie-Mich√®le Poncet was assigned to realize its main d√©cor such ambon, altar, tabernacle and baptistery. The artist created her works in pink marble from Portugal, which its formal and chromatic characteristics are combined harmoniously to the red-green macchiavecchia, precious material from Switzerland, widely used in the Ambrosian churches and for this chancel. Poncet was inspired by the meaning of the Christian cross, which was described by Pope John Paul II as \\"the beginning of everything\\". She placed then, at the center of the altar, a cross that appears between two bearing blocks of marble and represents the creation, as well as the origin and core of life. The ambon is designated as \\"place of the Word\\". Its main features are two characters, placed facing one another: a prophet, holding the Tables of the Law, who figures the Old Testament, and an evangelist who is the symbol of the New Testament, carrying a cross. The position of the arms and bodies of the two draws an X, which represents the Christian cross. The shelf below the church tabernacle recalls an angel's wing, because the Eucharist is celebrated as \\"the bread of angels\\". The baptismal font is the last marble element made by the French artist. It is located in the chapel housed in the counterfa√ßade. The baptismal font brings to mind a capital and depicts water, fire, robe and chrism: basic symbols of the liturgy of baptism in Christian tradition.

It is possible he only performed a partial prostatectomy. The British surgeon Arthur Fergusson McGill (1850-1890) performed a similar procedure very close to this time, but McGill ultimately recognized Belfield as having been first. Belfield was born in St. Louis, Missouri in 1856 but spent much of his childhood in Chicago. He earned his medical doctorate from Rush Medical College in Chicago in 1877 and later became its chair of the department of urology in 1883.

It became an organized sport, which has grown in popularity ever since. The first race The first prearranged match race of two self-powered road vehicles over a prescribed route occurred at 4:30 A.M. on August 30, 1867, between Ashton-under-Lyne and Old Trafford, a distance of eight miles. It was won by the carriage of Isaac Watt Boulton, one of six he said he had run over the years, perhaps driven by his 22-year-old son, James W. The race was against Daniel Adamson's carriage, likely the one made for Mr. Schmidt and perhaps driven by Schmidt. The reports do not indicate who was driving, since both were violating the red-flag law then fully in force. Boulton's carriage was developed from a scrapped John Bridge Adams light-rail vehicle. These were solid fired steam carriages. This event and the details of the vehicles are recorded in the contemporary press, The Engineer, and in Fletcher's books. The Wisconsin legislature passed an act in 1875 offering a substantial purse for the first US motor race, which was run on July 16, 1878, over a 200-mile course from Green Bay to Appleton, Oshkosh, Waupon, Watertown, Fort Atkinson and Janesville, then turning north and ending in Madison. Only two actually competed: the Oshkosh and the Green Bay (the machines were referred to by their town of origin). This is examined and illustrated in detail in The Great Race of 1878 by Richard Backus, Farm Collector, May/June 2004. Early motor competition Internal combustion auto racing events began soon after the construction of the first successful gasoline-fueled automobiles. The first organized contest was on April 28, 1887, by the chief editor of Paris publication Le V√©locip√®de, Monsieur Fossier. It ran from Neuilly Bridge to the Bois de Boulogne. It was won by Georges Bouton of the De Dion-Bouton Company in a car he had constructed with Albert, the Comte de Dion, but as he was the only competitor to show up, it is rather difficult to call it a race. Another solo event occurred in 1891 when Auguste Doriot and Louis Rigoulot of Peugeot drove their gasoline-fueled Type 3 Quadricycle in the bicycle race from Paris‚ÄìBrest‚ÄìParis. By the time they reached Brest, the winning cyclist, Charles Terront, was already back in Paris. In order to publicly prove the reliability and performance of the Quadricycle, Armand Peugeot had persuaded the organiser, Pierre Giffard of Le Petit Journal, to use his network of monitors and marshalls to vouchsafe and report the vehicle's performance. The intended distance of 1200 km had never been achieved by a motorised vehicle, it being about three times further than the record set by Leon Serpollet from Paris to Lyon.Peugeot Fan Club. History. 1890 - 1895 From Steam to Petrol Albert Lema√Ætre classified first in his Peugeot Type 5 3hp in the Paris‚ÄìRouen. =Paris‚ÄìRouen: the world's first motoring contest= On July 22,Le Petit Journal, publishing of monday 23 july 1894 1894, the Parisian magazine Le Petit Journal organized what is considered to be the world's first motoring competition, from Paris to Rouen. Sporting events were a tried and tested form of publicity stunt and circulation booster. Pierre Giffard, the paper's editor, promoted it as a Concours des Voitures sans Chevaux (Competition for Horseless Carriages) that was \\"not dangerous, easy to drive, and cheap during the journey.\\" Thus, it blurred the distinctions between a reliability trial, a general event, and a race. One hundred and two competitors paid a 10-franc entrance fee. Sixty-nine cars started the selection event that would show which entrants would be allowed to start the main event, the race from Paris to Rouen. The entrants ranged from serious manufacturers like Peugeot, Panhard, or De Dion to amateur owners; only 25 were selected for the main race. The race started from Porte Maillot and went through the Bois de Boulogne. Count Jules-Albert de Dion was first into Rouen after 6 hours and 48 minutes at an average speed of 19 km/h. He finished 3'30\\" ahead of Albert Lema√Ætre (Peugeot), followed by Auguste Doriot (Peugeot) at 16'30\\", Ren√© Panhard (Panhard) at 33'30\\" and √âmile Levassor (Panhard) at 55'30\\". The official winners were Peugeot and Panhard as cars were judged on their speed, handling and safety characteristics. De Dion's steam car needed a stoker, which was forbidden. Early races The Paris‚ÄìBordeaux‚ÄìParis race of June 1895 has sometimes been described as the \\"first motor race\\", despite the 1894 event being decided by speed and finishing order of the eligible racers. The first to arrive was √âmile Levassor in his Panhard-Levassor 1205cc model. He completed the course (1,178 km or 732 miles) in 48 hours and 47 minutes, finishing nearly six hours before the runner-up. The official winner was Paul Koechlin in a Peugeot. Nine of twenty- two starters finished the course. The first American automobile race is generally held to be the Thanksgiving Day Chicago Times-Herald race of November 28, 1895. Press coverage of the event first aroused significant American interest in the automobile. The course ran from the south side of the city, north along the lakefront to Evanston, Illinois, and back again. Frank Duryea won the race in 7 hours and 53 minutes, beating the other five entrants.Profile of Frank Duryea, Historic Racing The first regular auto racing venue was Nice, France, run in late March 1897, as a \\"Speed Week\\". To fill out the schedule, most types of racing events were invented here, including the first hill climb (Nice ‚Äì La Turbie) and a sprint that was, in spirit, the first drag race. An international competition, between nations rather than individuals, began with the Gordon Bennett Cup in auto racing. The Parisian artist Ernest Montaut and his wife, Marguerite, faithfully documented the rapidly changing face of motorised transportation in Europe. They produced large numbers of posters and prints published by Mabileau et Cie, covering racing events involving motorcars, aircraft, dirigibles and speedboats. These images formed a valuable contribution to the history of transport, and particularly to its racing aspect. City-to-city racing Mors in Paris- Madrid 1903 With auto construction and racing dominated by France, the French automobile club ACF staged a number of major international races, usually from or to Paris, connecting with another major city, in France or elsewhere in Europe. The very successful early European rally races ended in 1903, when Marcel Renault was involved in a fatal crash near Angoul√™me in the Paris‚ÄìMadrid race. Nine fatalities caused the French government to stop the race in Bordeaux and ban open-road racing. In 1907, the Peking to Paris race covered 9,317 miles over some of the roughest terrain on Earth. Five cars took part in the race, which was won by the Italian Prince Scipione Borghese in a 7,433 cc (453.6 cu in) 35/45 hp model Itala. The longest automobile race in history, with Paris as the finish line, was the 1908 New York to Paris Race. Six teams from France, Italy, Germany, and the United States competed with three teams actually reaching Paris. The American Thomas Flyer driven by George Schuster was declared the winner of the epic 22,000 mile race in 169 days  The first purpose-built racing circuits  Aspendale Racecourse, in Australia, was the world's first purpose-built motor racing circuit, opening in January 1906. The pear shaped track was close to a mile in length, with slightly banked curves and a gravel surface of crushed cement. A remaining section of the Brooklands track in 2007 Brooklands, in Surrey, was the first purpose-built 'banked' motor racing venue, opening in June 1907. It featured a concrete track with high-speed banked corners. Brooklands was also a centre of the aviation industry, with Vickers setting up a factory and aerodrome there during World War I. The racing circuit was closed in 1939 as war-time aircraft production took over. Damage done to the track during World War II meant the track never reopened for racing. The Milwaukee Mile is the second-oldest motor racing track in the world still in existence, with racing being held there since 1903. It was not purposely built for motor racing, however. It started as a one-mile (1.6 km) horse-racing track in the 19th century. The first closed-circuit automobile race was held on September 7, 1896 at the Narragansett Trotting Park in Cranston, Rhode Island, and was won by an electric car built by the Riker Electric Vehicle Company. Knoxville Raceway in Knoxville, Iowa, is the oldest racing venue, and one of the most prestigious, in the United States. It was built in the late 1800s at the Marion County Fairgrounds in Iowa. It was built for a horse-racing track, just like the Milwaukee Mile. Although sanctioned races were not held until 1914, one automobile race was held in 1901. The race was not good because of the wind; but in 1961, the first Knoxville Nationals was won by Roy Robbins. Now the Nationals are sanctioned by the World of Outlaws. From 1903 to 1914, a one- mile dirt oval track was run on Brunots Island, just south of Pittsburgh on the Ohio River. Louis Chevrolet won the AAA Champion car in 1905. On September 10, 1907, Rex Reinersten was fatally injured in a crash there. In 1916, Chevrolet won the first Universal Films Trophy at the mile and an eighth Uniontown Speedway board track, south of Pittsburgh in Hopwood, Pennsylvania. Competition gradually spread to other parts of the British Empire. The first competition in India was held in 1905 by the Motor Union of Western India. It ran from Delhi to Mumbai, (Delhi‚ÄìBombay trials 1905) a distance of , in an attempt to expose India to the automobile and test its suitability for Indian conditions. Lord Curzon, the Viceroy, gave his consent to the event. One of the oldest existing purpose-built automobile racing circuits in the United States, still in use, is the 2.5-mile (4.02 km)-long Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana, built from March to August 1909, when it first opened for racing. It is the largest capacity sports venue of any variety worldwide, with a top capacity of some 257,000+ seated spectators. The oldest asphalt-paved oval track in the United States is Thompson Speedway Motorsports Park in Thompson, Connecticut, once known as the \\"Indianapolis of the East.\\" 1906‚Äì1950 The Targa Florio was an open road endurance automobile race held in the mountains of Sicily near the island's capital of Palermo. Founded in 1906, it was the oldest sports car racing event, part of the World Sportscar Championship between 1955 and 1973. The 1930s saw the transformation from high-priced road cars into pure racers, with Alfa Romeo, Auto Union, Bugatti, Delage, Delahaye, and Mercedes-Benz constructing streamlined vehicles with engines producing up to , aided by multiple-stage supercharging. From 1928 to 1930 and again in 1934‚Äì1936, the maximum weight permitted was , a rule diametrically opposed to current racing regulations. Extensive use of aluminum alloys was required to achieve light weight, and in the case of the Mercedes, the paint was removed to satisfy the weight limitation, producing the famous Silver Arrows. NASCAR was founded by Bill France, Sr. on February 21, 1948, with the help of several other drivers of the time. The first NASCAR \\"Strictly Stock\\" race ever was held on June 19, 1949, at Daytona Beach, Florida. The Strictly Stock division was put on hold as American automobile manufacturers were unable to produce family sedans quickly enough to keep up with post-World War II demand. 1950‚Äìpresent After the Second World War, sports car racing emerged as a distinct form of racing with its own classic races, and, from 1953, its own FIA-sanctioned World Championship. NASCAR's Strictly Stock Division was renamed the \\"Grand National\\" division beginning in the 1950 season. Over a period of more than a decade, modifications for both safety and performance were allowed, and by the mid-1960s, the vehicles were purpose- built race cars with a stock-appearing body. From 1962, sports cars temporarily took a back seat to GT cars, with the FIA replacing the World Championship for Sports Cars with the International Championship for GT Manufacturers.Denis Jenkinson, Automobile Year Book Of Sports Car Racing, 1982 Through the 1960s, as superspeedways were built and old dirt tracks were paved, the number of dirt races was reduced.Fielden, Greg, \\"NASCAR Cleans Up\\", Speedway Illustrated, September 2004. A breed of powerful hybrids appeared in the 1950s and 1960s and raced on both sides of the Atlantic, featuring European chassis and large American engines ‚Äì from the early Allard cars via hybrids, such as Lotus 19s fitted with large engines, through to the AC Cobra. The combination of mostly British chassis and American V8 engines gave rise to the Can-Am series in the 1960s and 1970s. This series, based in the United States and Canada, featured lightweight prototype sports cars fitted with large, powerful production-based engines that produced speeds in excess of 200 mph. Clubmans provided much entertainment at club-racing level from the 1960s into the 1990s, and John Webb revived interest in big sports prototypes with Thundersports in the 1980s. Group 4 Grand Touring Cars and Group 5 Special Production Cars became the premier form of sports car racing from 1976, with prototypes going into a general decline apart from Porsche 936 domination at Le Mans and a lower-key series of races for smaller two-litre Group 6 prototypes. The last NASCAR race on a dirt track was held on September 30, 1970 at the half-mile State Fairgrounds Speedway in Raleigh, North Carolina. From 1972 through 2003, NASCAR's premier series was called the Winston Cup Series, sponsored by R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company cigarette brand Winston. The changes that resulted from RJR's involvement, as well as the reduction of the schedule from 48 to 31 races a year, established 1972 as the beginning of NASCAR's \\"modern era\\". In Europe, the FIA adopted the ACO GTP rules virtually unchanged and sanctioned the Group C World Endurance Championship (or World Sportscar Championship), featuring high-tech closed-cockpit prototypes. In the US, the IMSA Camel GTP series boasted close competition between huge fields of manufacturer-backed teams and privateer squads ‚Äì the cars were technically similar to Group Cs but used a sliding scale of weights and engine capacities to try to limit performance. The FIA attempted to make Group C into a virtual \\"two seater Grand Prix\\" format in the early 1990s, with engine rules in common with F1, short race distances, and a schedule dovetailing with that of the F1 rounds. The IMSA GT Championship had been prototype-based since 1983, with less emphasis on production cars. Australian Production Car Championship was first contested in 1987, with the inaugural champion determined from the results of two races held at the Winton Motor Raceway in Victoria on September 27. The first World Touring Car Championship, which was open to Group A Touring Cars, was held in 1987 concurrent to the long-running European Touring Car Championship (ETCC). Additional rounds were held outside Europe at Bathurst in Australia, Calder Park Raceway in Australia (using both the road course and the then-newly constructed Thunderdome), Wellington in New Zealand and Mount Fuji in Japan. The Drivers Championship was won by Roberto Ravaglia in a BMW M3, and the Entrants Championship was won by the Eggenberger Motorsport Ford No 7 entry, which was a Ford Sierra. Winston Cup Series underwent a large boom in popularity in the 1990s.Autoracing1.com \\"NASCAR's Greatest Moments ‚ÄîPart 3\\". Retrieved March 12, 2009. This coincided with a decline of popularity in American Championship Car Racing. The FISA decided to separate the rally cars into three classes: Group N (production cars), Group A (modified production cars), and Group B (modified sport cars). Group B was introduced by the FIA in 1982 as a replacement for both Group 4 (modified grand touring) and Group 5 (touring prototype) cars. The IMSA GT Series evolved into the American Le Mans Series, which ran its first season in 1999. The European races eventually became the closely related Le Mans Series, both of which mix prototypes and GTs. The SCCA World Challenge consists of a one- hour race for each round, combining three classes: GT (Chevrolet Corvette, Aston Martin DB9, etc.), \\"GTS\\" (Acura TSX, BMW 3 Series, etc.; replaced the former touring car class), and Touring Car (a \\"showroom stock\\" class similar to Grand Am's Continental Challenge). NASCAR was becoming increasingly dominant, and the IndyCar Series' split from CART in 1996 put more emphasis on ovals regarding domestic open-wheel racing.

It was the first autobiography to be written in the Gujarati language. Written in 1866, it was published posthumously in 1933 on the centenary of Narmad's birth. Origin and publication history Narmad wrote Mari Hakikat in 1866. He explained his intentions at the start of his autobiography; He added that his life will give some message to people. Narmad was candid and outspoken and he believed that his thoughts and works are exemplar. To give insights in his mind and world around him, he chose to write as openly as possible about events in his life, people connected with those events, his relations with those people and the results of those relationships. Narmad had published a collection of his essays as Narmagadya: Book 1 in 1865. Suratni Mukhatesar ni Hakikat was published as Narmagadya: Book 2: Issue 1 in 1866 from page 1 to page 59. He had intended to publish Mari Hakikat as Narmagadya: Book 2: Issue 2, but later changed his mind. After his death in 1886, his friend Navalram Pandya published a biography of Narmad, Kavijivan (1880) which was based on the autobiography. He wrote that Narmad had only two to five copies printed, which were given to close friends, and had requested it be published only after his death. Natwarlal Desai, his editor and son of another close friend Ichchharam Desai, also corroborated this. But later research found that Narmad had printed 400 copies of the autobiography; it is mentioned in Narmakavita (1866‚Äì67), in which he had included a list of all his books along with the number of published copies of each. Narmad may have destroyed all but a few copies but there has been no firm proof of it. The limited print copy had 73 pages of two columned Royal size pages. It was page number 60 to 132 of Narmagadya: Book 2: Issue 2, printed by Union Press, owned by his friend Nanabhai Rustomji Ranina. As Narmad's only son Jayshankar died in 1910 without any heir, he had assigned the management of his father's works to his friends, Mulchand Damodardas Mukati and Thakordas Tribhuvandas Tarkasr. They had transferred copyrights of these works to Gujarati Press in 1911. Kanaiyalal Munshi had published a few chapters in Gujarat magazine in 1926, but stopped when the copyright holder, Gujarati Press objected. Gujarati Press published some excerpts from Mari Hakikat in the Diwali editions of Gujarati in 1930 and 1931, finally publishing the full version in 1933, the birth centenary of Narmad. Later in 1939, they also published Uttar Narmad Charitra which included some notes and letters as a followup to the autobiography. Mari Hakikat is not in continuous prose and includes lots of notes. Narmad had started keeping notes in 1854, and written the first draft based on information told to him by his father and relatives, papers available in his home, his expense book and his memory. He organised all available information into a timeline and filled in gaps with other information. He had described his autobiography as 'incomplete' and a 'draft' and intended to rewrite it at some future date. His prime motive for writing was self encouragement. Other motives were to popularize autobiographies in Gujarati, to give insight into his life to his friends and clarify truths about his life and leave a record of them after his death. He had decided to write as truthfully as possible about his life and his relatives, friends and foes. He did not intended to hurt anybody, and later decided not to publish publicly as he intended it only for his own encouragement. When Gujarati Press closed operations, they deposited one of his limited copies printed in 1866, with proofreading notes by Narmad himself, at M. T. B. College, Surat. The first edition published in 1933 had several omissions and misprints. A later edition was edited by Dhirubhai Thaker. After the Kavi Narmad Yugavart Trust was established they decided to republish Narmad's entire works. They researched original manuscripts, limited copies and earlier editions, also examining all the literature of Narmad and extracting writings and letters that were autobiographical in nature. This critical edition consisting of the autobiography, autobiographical notes and letters was edited by Ramesh M. Shukla and published by the Trust in 1994. Contents of critical edition, 1994 The critical edition is divided in four sections. The first section covers the autobiography written in 1866. It consists of his birth to 1866, divided into 10 subsections, or Viram. All titles and subtitles of the Virams were given by his editor Natwar Desai. It covers his life from 3 September 1833 to 18 September 1866. It covers his birth, his parents and relatives, his education, his formative years, his reformist stand, his rise and career. The second section covers essays and notes written by him which are autobiographical in nature. It includes notes and thoughts on his personal life, his family, and his own works. The third section covers letters written to various relatives, friends and people of his time. The fourth section covers appendices which include scans of his and his companions' writings, legal documents, notes and timeline. In the beginning of the book Narmad write: And apparently, he has frankly written about his cowardice, his calf love, his attempts to attract women, his dislike of his contemporary poet Dalpatram and their clash, his conflict with his father, how he once arranged a musical concert at his residence under depression and spent five hundred rupees for it, his financial crisis, betrayal by friends, his private love affairs, etc. The book gives clear picture of Narmad's personality, his egoism, hypersensitive nature, generosity and extravagance. There are attempts of self glorification, and attitude of self-righteousness. The language he used has a ting of Surati dialect and the style is fully reflective of his personality. Reception Chandrakant Topiwala has highlighted candidness, honesty at the expense of narrative and efforts of introspection as major elements of the autobiography. He has also praised its prose. Dhirubhai Modi has criticised its language without beauty but praised its truthfulness and honesty. He has also praised it for its accuracy and the efforts of writing it. Chandravadan Mehta gave tribute to author by writing, Gulabdas Broker described it as 'very bold, sincere and beautiful autobiography'. However Gujarati critic, Vishwanath M. Bhatt noted that Narmad's autobiography lacks coherence, order and the sense of discrimination about what to write. Adaptation Narmad: Mari Hakikat or Narmad: My Life, a soliloquy based on his autobiography and life, was written and directed by Harish Trivedi. It was performed by Chandrakant Shah. It was premiered in Dayton, Ohio, US in 1995 and later toured India, United Kingdom and France. It was critically acclaimed.

Early life Born Maurice Talvande in Le Mans in 1866 to parents who were both commoners, de Mauny's father was Felix Talvande a middle-class bank official, and his mother Marguerite Adelaide Louise, n√©e Froger de Mauny ‚Äì a granddaughter of the genuine Count de Mauny,Chomet, Seweryn \\"Count de Mauny, Friend of Royalty\\", Begell House Inc., New York, 2002 a title bestowed by Napoleon I on the French politician . He attended a Jesuit-run school in Canterbury, England. As a young man, described as \\"rather good looking\\", he travelled to America and England where, having assumed the more aristocratic- sounding name of Maurice de Mauny Talvande, he earned a little money giving drawingroom lectures on French ch√¢teau and ch√¢teau life.Fontenoy, Marquise de (pseudonym of Marguerite Cunliffe-Owen) Chicago Tribune, 16 May 1911 In 1897 he also gave an address in which he promoted the establishment of settlements for deprived and wayward young men.Aldrich, Robert Cultural Encounters and Homoeroticism in Sri Lanka: Sex and Serendipity, Routledge, New York 2014, pp70-77 Marriage In June 1898 de Mauny married Lady Mary Byng, daughter of the 4th Earl of Strafford, and a maid of honour to Queen Victoria, whom he may have met through her brother who had attended his school. There was talk that Lady Mary married de Mauny, who had no social position or fortune, due to her hostility to her father's second marriage to a wealthy American divorcee, Mrs Cora Colgate. Shortly prior to his marriage de Mauny established a small boarding school for teenage boys from upper-class English families seeking to polish their French. Situated at the rented Ch√¢teau Azay-le-Rideau in the Loire Valley, de Mauny relying on his wife's contacts to supply the dozen pupils. It was visited by Lord Lorne, and attended by the 2nd Duke of Westminster as a 19-year-old. There were persistent rumours of sexual advances made to the pupils by de Mauny who, confronted by the Duke, admitted he was homosexual. Possibly due to this, but claiming he had never intended the ch√¢teau to be used as a school, in late 1898 the ch√¢teau's owner cancelled the lease. The Journal des D√©bats, considered the voice of the Gallic Establishment, called de Mauny a \\"vulgar marchand de soupe\\". The de Mauny Talvandes relocated to Cannes, where their first child Victor Alexander was born, then San Remo, before finally settling in England. They moved into a Queen Anne residence called \\"Terrick House\\", near Ellesbrough in Buckinghamshire. In 1900 their daughter Alexandra Mary was born. It was around this time that de Mauny adopted the title of count. His mother provided the couple with a small allowance, reportedly \\"almost starving herself for his sake\\", and de Mauny falsely claimed he would inherit a large fortune on her death, which enabled the couple to obtain credit. His father had declared bankuptcy in 1890 following the collapse of his bank, and his parents had separated. Besides dabbling in a number of failed ventures, de Mauny edited an illustrated London newspaper the Crown. His wife sold her reminiscences as a former maid of honour to a popular journal The Quiver, a hitherto unprecedented breach of royal confidentiality which drew a public repudiation by Queen Victoria.Fontenoy, Marquise de (pseudonym of Marguerite Cunliffe- Owen) Chicago Tribune, 14 January 1899 In 1899, the Earl of Strafford was decapitated by a train. While his entailed estate passed to the 5th Earl, he had willed the entire remainder of his wealth to his two daughters.Fontenoy, Marquise de (pseudonym of Marguerite Cunliffe-Owen) Chicago Tribune, 7 July 1899 Always in 1899, Charles Hammond Gibson Jr privately printed Two Gentlemen in Touraine, under the name of Richard Sudbury, a fictional romance about the relationship with de Mauny. In 1901 de Mauny's father died, and in 1907 his mother, leaving the family home in Pontvallain to de Mauny and his brother and sister. They shared the 17,000 francs that came from its sale. With the money, de Mauny separated from his wife for a year. Nevertheless, by 1909-10 he was forced to declare bankruptcy. Taprobane Island Taprobane Island in 2007, showing de Mauny's house In 1912 de Mauny visited Ceylon for the first time, possibly as the guest of tea magnate Sir Thomas Lipton. Further visits followed, and by 1920-1 he was residing in Colombo with his now 21-year-old son Victor. Like many others, the Great War had left de Mauny severely dispirited. He wrote a book of reflections The Peace of Suffering 1914-1918, and later wrote: \\"The war had taken everything from me. The whole of my being, both physical and moral, had lost its object in life. Paralysed, inert, it was incapable of effort because I had lost even the desire of effort. I was flickering out a living death, a life worse than death, because it no longer had the confidence of hope‚Ä¶.It is to the East that I owe the awakening of the desire of effort; it is to my gardens of Taprobane that I owe the strength that has enabled me to transform the desire of effort into the reality of action, thanks to the peace and happiness which they have given me.\\"Man realises a dream, The Sydney Morning Herald, 29 March 1938, p2 It was only after a long search for an earthly paradise that around 1925 de Mauny sighted \\"Galduwa\\" ‚Äì \\"Rock Island\\" in Sinhalese,Ondaatje, Sir Christopher The Count haunts Taprobane,The Sri Lankan Anchorman, Toronto an islet in Weligama Bay, Ceylon that was an unkempt wilderness used by locals as a dumping ground for cobras. It was purchased by de Mauny for Rs.250 and he renamed it Taprobane, the ancient Greek name for Ceylon. He constructed a magnificent and picturesque villa that offered 360 degree views of the sea, and replanted the island into his vision of a private Eden (the snakes, however, were removed). The villa, its furniture and garden were all designed by de Mauny to be in perfect harmony. He described himself as having \\"an insatiable thirst for beauty\\" and \\"longing for perfection.\\" Construction on the villa began in 1927. It featured a large domed octagonal central hall, called the Hall of the Lotus, which was lined with eight panels of inlaid wood dyed a dull gold and eau de Nil, and bearing a design of lotus buds and flowers. At the centre of the Hall was a large octagonal teak table carved with lotus leaves.Ondaatje, Sir Christopher The Count haunts Taprobane, The Sri Lankan Anchorman, Toronto The furniture was teak and Ceylonese woods upholstered in eau de Nil watered silk,the iron and brass balustrades ornamented with peakcocks, and the floors tiled in black and white marble inset with a rampant Singhalese lion. There were no walls, between rooms, only fabric scrims: the villa was designed as a completely open pavilion. De Mauny lived on the Island with a village boy, Raman, who helped tend the gardens and Gomez, his 'dressing boy'. One journalist visitor wrote: \\"The man himself, the occupant of this dream home, remains to its visitors rather a mystery. They sum him up according to their own values in life. There are those who describe him as 'the made French Count who lives alone on his God-forsaken rock‚Ä¶Tiberius on Capri'. Others regard him with unconcealed envy and secret admiration for having so far left the world behind to gain the peace they sense in his home.\\" Said de Mauny: \\"Mad? I am mad of course if to shape one's own life, to live it and love it is madness.\\" De Mauny entertained a constant string of notable visitors, including Lord and Lady Mountbatten and David Herbert.Bowles, Paul Conversations With Paul Bowles, University Press of Mississippi, 1993, p148 De Mauny went on to establish a furniture manufacturing business 'Weligama Local Industries', and collaborated with a Hungarian interior decorator Mlle Louie Borgia, to make over the homes of the wealthy in Colombo.The Uplifting Influences Of A Beautiful Home, The Australian Women's Weekly, 11 May 1935, p36 The business partnership and furniture factory came to an end in the 1930s in the wake of the Great Depression. However, de Mauny went on to become a successful landscape and gardening designer for many prominent homes in Colombo, authoring, as \\"Count de Mauny\\", The Gardens of Tapobane (dedicated to the Duchess of Sutherland) and Gardening in Ceylon. Suffering from angina pectoris, de Mauny died of a heart attack in November 1941. Victor sold Taprobane Island in 1943 for Rs.1200. Lady Mary, aka the Countess de Mauny Tavanade, died in 1947. Victor died in 1978 and his sister Alexandra in 1989. Both left no issue. The author Robin Maugham, who visited the Island as a young man, and in the mid-1970s, considered the unique beauty and harmony of the villa had become compromised after de Mauny's death by partitioning and the loss of his furniture and fittings, and that the area itself had been despoiled by the construction of a new road along the mainland beach.Maugham, Robin Search For Nirvana\\", WH Allen, London 1975, p151-3 Since then, and particularly after the 2004 tsunami, significant development of the adjoining mainland village has occurred.

Its modern version has elements of colonialism as the accompanying instrumentation includes guitar and violin, and the outfits adorning the dances are commonly known as 'working class clothes'. = Dance style classification = The Riel Dance  General  The most outstanding feature of the riel is the ingenious and frantic footwork and energetic pace at which it is danced. The dance was performed in the dusty sands around a campfire and thus the dance is described by a beautiful Afrikaans expression: \\"Dans lat die stof so staan\\" (Dancing at a fast and energetic pace resulting in a lot of dust) The unique dance is performed by a group, often in a circle.

It operated from the early 1920s onwards and was sold in 1950. The bar was designed like a ship's hull. In the backroom was a gambling den, which was investigated by the federal authorities and raided in 1943. History The club, situated on Pacific Avenue, opposite the Atlantic City Convention Hall, operated from the early 1920s through to the 1940s. Originally called the Golden Inn, it was renamed by owner Dan Stebbins to Babette's after he married showgirl Blanche Babbitt, who used the stage name Babette. She used her talents for costume creation, music arranging and choreography to improve the club's stage presentations. The club was a venue for Earl Lindsay's \\"All American Revue\\", and was described by Billboard as \\"one of the resort's leading cabarets\\". The floor show included a chorus line and singers. There was a small dance floor. Milton Berle, Eleanor Powell, and comedian Joe Penner were among those appearing on stage; Al Capone and New York mayor Jimmy Walker were known to have visited the club. The supper club was also a favorite of New Jersey boss Nucky Johnson, who often arrived at the club with a showgirl on each arm. There was a minimum cover charge for entering the main showroom beyond the bar. The supper club menu featured seafood dinners and charcoal-broiled steaks. Entertainer Buddy Ebsen got his show business start at Babette's. His sister, Vilma, had been hired to dance at Babette's. Ebsen joined her in Atlantic City; he tried getting work at the various clubs and at the minstrel show at Steel Pier but was unsuccessful at getting hired for any entertainment work. Ebsen was allowed to dance at Babette's with his sister one evening because it was thought the patrons would be amused by it. Vaudevillian Benny Davis was in the audience that night. Davis was compiling a cast to work at various movie theaters throughout the US. He signed both Ebsens, and they worked for some time dancing at theaters in the eastern US. The Ebsens then went on to work in the Ziegfeld Follies. Interior and illegal gambling A nautical theme played throughout the establishment. A distinguishing feature of the bar was that it was designed like a ship's hull with portholes and named \\"Babs\\". The club sported a large collection of tunas belonging to Stebbins. The furnishings and fittings were \\"electric blue and chromium\\". Though considered one of the city's most upmarket clubs, Babette's gained a reputation for hosting illegal gambling, prompting a federal investigation in the 1930s. There was a backroom at Babette's containing card tables and horse- race betting, which was illegal at the time. The gambling den attracted the high rollers of the period; Astors, Vanderbilts and others from New York's social register could be found in the rooms at Babette's. Stebbins was able to protect his casino business by his connections with politicians and those in the legal profession. His niece Gloria Vallee recalled in 1980 that the venue was continually being raided by police, but they would tip her uncle off that there would be a raid, so he could protect his clients. The mode of escaping the police was to exit through a trap door in the horse betting room. This led to a staircase to the roof. The gamblers crossed the roof and came down another flight of stairs on the side of the building which led into the Stebbins' home. In 1943, Babette's was raided by the authorities and booking equipment was confiscated. Stebbins was fined several thousand dollars for facilitating illegal gambling. Sale and legacy In May 1950, Stebbins sold the club to the Rajan Corporation, after nearly 30 years of ownership. He died in 1960, and Blanche in 1963. The Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino now occupies the site. In 2010 the club was featured in the Martin Scorsese-directed pilot episode of the HBO crime drama Boardwalk Empire, set in prohibition-era Atlantic City. The bar depicted in the television series was based on a Mississippi River paddleboat, which was a different style than the bar at Babette's.

Their eponymous ancestor was Buinn, son of the legendary Ulaid king Fergus mac R√≥ich. It consisted in whole or part of a tr√≠cha c√©t. D√°l mBuinne is Anglicised as Dalmunia and Dalboyn, the latter of which became the name of a medieval deanery. D√°l mBuinne contained the royal site of D√∫n Eachdach (Eochaidh‚Äôs fort, modern-day Duneight in County Down), which had been established by the D√°l Fiatach by the 9th-century. In 1010 AD according to the Annals of the Four Masters Flaithbertach Ua N√©ill of the Cen√©l nE√≥gain led an incursion into Ulaid and burnt D√∫n Eachdach. South of D√∫n Eachdach lies the Ravernet river, which formed the boundary between D√°l mBuinne and U√≠ Echach Cobo. D√°l mBuinne also contained the royal inauguration site of Cr√°eb Telcha (modern-day Crew Hill near Glenavy, County Antrim), which at first appears to have been used as such by the D√°l nAraidi before its take over by the D√°l Fiatach by the 9th-century. St. Patrick's slave master M√≠liuc mac Buan (also called Milch√∫) was a chief of the D√°l mBuain. Branches The following are giving as branches of the D√°l mBuinne: the Galini, possibly of Leinster origin descending from the Gale√≥in; the Cen√©l nErnain; and the D√°l Cuirb‚Äîalso known as D√°l Corb na hUamadh (D√°l Cuirb of the cave) and D√°l Coirbin‚Äîone of the five primtuatha (chief families) of D√°l mBuinne. The U√≠ Coltarain (Coulter) sept were located in D√°l Cuirb. Saints and ecclesiastical foundations According to one tradition, M√≠liuc mac Buan's daughter Br√≥nach had the following children: St. Fursa who spread Christianity throughout the British Isles; Mo Chaoi (Anglicised as Mahee, a pet form of St. Caol√°n), who founded Nendrum Monastery on Mahee Island in Strangford Lough. He is recorded as having died in 496; Colm√°n Comraire of Uisneach; Colm√°n Muilinn, founder of the church of Daire Chaechain in D√°l Riata; Bishop Mac Erca, attributed as possible founder of the church of Domnuch M√≥r Maige Coba, County Down; and his sister Damnat, founder of the church of Cell Damhnata (Caldavnet) in Sliabh Beagh, County Monaghan. This pedigree stemming from Br√≥nach is stated as being entirely fictional, the common denominator being that all had links to St. Patrick, and that their linking may have been to place them all into a particular ecclesiastical-religious context. Deanery of Dalboyn In the papal taxation of 1306 the following parishes are given as being in the rural deanery of Dalboyn: Aghagallon, Aghalee, Ballinderry, Blaris, Derryaghy, Drumbo, Drumbeg, Glenavy, Hillsborough, Lambeg, Magheragall, and Magheramesk. The Irish districts that composed the deanery in the 16th-century where Derryvolgie, Kilultagh, and Kilwarlin. Kilultagh (from Irish: Coill Ultach, meaning \\"wood of the Ulster\\") was the largest of these and is suggested as being conterminous to D√°l mBuinne. The medieval deanery of Dalboyn is now represented by the modern rural deaneries of Hillsborough and Lisburn. The deanery is said to have extended from Glenavy in the north to Hillsborough in the south, and from Spencer's Bridge near Moira to Drum Bridge near Belfast.

Zeman studied in Italian cities prior to his ordination and worked in Slovakia to protect fellow Salesians after the communist regime outlawed religious orders. He was arrested after attempting to send Salesians out of the nation and was imprisoned from 1952 until 1964 and died due to poor health sustained from the prison conditions. He has been acclaimed as a defender of religious liberties. Zeman was acclaimed a Servant of God in 2010 under Pope Benedict XVI after the canonization process commenced in Bratislava ‚Äì the cause was taken with ascertaining whether Zeman had died \\"in odium fidei\\" (in hatred of the faith). Pope Francis approved his beatification on 27 February 2017; the beatification occurred in Bratislava on 30 September 2017. Life Titus Zeman was born in 1915 in Slovakia. From 1925 ‚Äì when he was ten ‚Äì he knew he wanted to become a priest and so finished his high school education at the Salesians of Don Bosco-run house at ≈†a≈°t√≠n before considering that path ahead. He entered the Salesians novitiate in 1931 and made his first vows on 6 August 1932. On 7 March 1938 he made his solemn profession into the order at the Sacro Cuore di Ges√π a Castro Pretorio in Rome. Zeman did theological studies for the priesthood at the Pontifica Universit√† Gregoriana and then continued his studies in Chieri. He was ordained a priest in Turin on 23 June 1940 by Cardinal Maurilio Fossati. He celebrated his first Mass in his hometown on 4 August 1940 and until 1950 served as both a chaplain and catechist. In April 1950 the communist regime forbade religious orders within its borders and began to send their members to concentration camps. Zeman arranged for Salesians to travel to Turin ‚Äì despite it being a grave risk since it was illegal ‚Äì so that these religious could complete their studies without fear of persecution or suppression. He organized two such expeditions (one in August 1950 and another on 23 October 1950) for over 60 Salesians. The third attempt in April 1951 saw him and others arrested. At his trial he was described as a traitor to the nation. He risked receiving the death sentence but, due to attenuating circumstances, on 22 February 1952 he was sentenced to imprisonment until 1977, and received parole on 10 March 1964, scarred from the suffering that he endured in prison. He was granted permission in 1968 to celebrate religious functions. Zeman died in 1969 due to heart failure, with the harsh conditions of his imprisonment a contributing factor in his death. His remains were exhumed and moved to the local church in 2010. Beatification process The beatification process commenced in Bratislava on 22 January 2010 under Pope Benedict XVI after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints granted the official \\"nihil obstat\\" ('nothing against') to the cause and titled him as a Servant of God. The diocesan process for the cause was inaugurated on 26 February 2010 and concluded its business on 7 December 2012; the C.C.S. validated this process on 28 June 2013. The postulation submitted the dossier known as the Positio to the C.C.S. in 2015 and a board of theologians ‚Äì in a unanimous decision ‚Äì voted in favor of the cause in a meeting on 7 April 2016. The C.C.S. met and approved the cause in their meeting on 21 February 2017. Pope Francis approved the beatification on 27 February 2017 and the beatification occurred in Bratislava on 30 September 2017. The current postulator assigned to the cause is the Salesian priest Pierluigi Cameroni.

It was established in 1866 with the merger of the Dublin Medical Press and the Medical Circular. Its masthead featured a Latin language version of the Cicero motto Salus Populi Suprema Lex (the health of the people shall be the supreme law). It ceased publication in 1961. Foundation The Dublin Medical Press was a weekly medical publication established in 1839 by Arthur Jacob. Claiming to be the first publication of its kind in Ireland, its first issue contained veiled criticism of The Lancets Erinensis column, pseudonymously written by an Irish doctor. It was co-edited by Jacob and his colleague Henry Maunsell, and was published by Fannin and Company in Dublin. After 3 months, circulation had reached 3,000 copies per week. Each edition was 16 pages in length and cost 6d (Irish pennies). Contents The Press contained medical and scientific articles, as well as letters, news, and professional notices. On 12 March 1845, Francis Rynd published his article on his invention of the modern hypodermic needle in the Dublin Medical Press. In 1860, Arthur Jacob's son, Archibald Jacob, was appointed as editor and the publication increased in size to 22 pages. When a patient accused renowned eye surgeon William Wilde (father of Oscar Wilde) of rape in 1864-1865, the Press suffered criticism from the medical community for its coverage of the case. The Press became known for its opposition to pseudoscience and in 1865 published a list of 18 Irish and British newspapers which had agreed to refuse advertising of quackery. The publication challenged the logical fallacy of argument from authority, stating that \\"mere appeal to authority alone had better be avoided\\". The Press encouraged the acceptance of women in medicine, commending Eleanora Fleury who became the first female graduate of the Royal University of Ireland as well as graduating first in her class. The Press also argued against segregation of male and female medical students. Later years In 1865, the title became Medical Press. It was soon purchased by James Yearsley and in January 1866 merged with his Medical Circular to become the Dublin Medical Press and Circular. In 1867, it was again renamed to Medical Press and Circular. In 1868, publication moved to Albert Alfred Tindall in London. Its focus moved away from Irish medicine and was sometimes referred to as the London Medical Press and Circular, although it continued to publish a dedicated Irish supplement . It maintained links with the Irish Medical Association until 1935, when it became the Irish Free State Medical Union. Archibald Jacob continued as editor of Medical Press and Circular until his death in 1901.

Chapter 15 in: (also known as a hedonic coalition formation game) is a game that models the formation of coalitions (groups) of players when players have preferences over which group they belong to. A hedonic game is specified by giving a finite set of players, and, for each player, a preference ranking over all coalitions (subsets) of players that the player belongs to. The outcome of a hedonic game consists of a partition of the players into disjoint coalitions, that is, each player is assigned a unique group. Such partitions are often referred to as coalition structures. Hedonic games are a type of non-transferable utility game. Their distinguishing feature (the \\"hedonic aspect\\") is that players only care about the identity of the players in their coalition, but do not care about how the remaining players are partitioned, and do not care about anything other than which players are in their coalition. Thus, in contrast to other cooperative games, a coalition does not choose how to allocate profit among its members, and it does not choose a particular action to play. Some well-known subclasses of hedonic games are given by matching problems, such as the stable marriage, stable roommates, and the hospital/residents problems. The players in hedonic games are typically understood to be self-interested, and thus hedonic games are usually analyzed in terms of the stability of coalition structures, where several notions of stability are used, including the core and Nash stability. Hedonic games are studied both in economics, where the focus lies on identifying sufficient conditions for the existence of stable outcomes, and in multi-agent systems, where the focus lies on identifying concise representations of hedonic games and on the computational complexity of finding stable outcomes.  Definition  Formally, a hedonic game is a pair (N, (\\\\succcurlyeq_i)_{i\\\\in N}) of a finite set N of players (or agents), and, for each player i\\\\in N a complete and transitive preference relation \\\\succcurlyeq_i over the set \\\\\\\\{ S \\\\subseteq N : i \\\\in S \\\\\\\\} of coalitions that player i belongs to. A coalition is a subset S\\\\subseteq N of the set of players. The coalition N is typically called the grand coalition. A coalition structure \\\\pi is a partition of N. Thus, every player i\\\\in N belongs to a unique coalition \\\\pi(i) in \\\\pi.  Solution concepts  Like in other areas of game theory, the outcomes of hedonic games are evaluated using solution concepts. Many of these concepts refer to a notion of game-theoretic stability: an outcome is stable if no player (or possibly no coalition of players) can deviate from the outcome so as to reach a subjectively better outcome. Here we give definitions of several solution concepts from the literature. * A coalition structure \\\\pi is in the core (or is core stable) if there is no coalition S whose members all prefer S to \\\\pi. Formally, a non- empty coalition S is said to block \\\\pi if S \\\\succ_i \\\\pi(i) for all i\\\\in S. Then \\\\pi is in the core if there are no blocking coalitions. * A coalition structure \\\\pi is in the strict core (or is strictly core stable) if there is no weakly blocking coalition S where all members weakly prefer S to \\\\pi and some member strictly prefers S to \\\\pi. In other words, \\\\pi is in the strict core if ot\\\\exists: S \\\\subseteq N: (\\\\forall i \\\\in N: S \\\\succeq \\\\pi) \\\\land (\\\\exists i \\\\in N: S \\\\succ \\\\pi). * A coalition structure \\\\pi is Nash-stable if no player wishes to change coalition within \\\\pi. Formally, \\\\pi is Nash-stable if there is no i\\\\in N such that S \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{i\\\\\\\\} \\\\succ_i \\\\pi(i) for some S \\\\in \\\\pi \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{\\\\emptyset\\\\\\\\}. Notice that, according to Nash-stability, a deviation by a player is allowed even if members of the group S that are joined by i are made worse off by the deviation. * A coalition structure \\\\pi is individually stable if no player wishes to join another coalition whose members all welcome the player. Formally, \\\\pi is individually stable if there is no i\\\\in N such that S \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{i\\\\\\\\} \\\\succ_i \\\\pi(i) for some S \\\\in \\\\pi \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{\\\\emptyset\\\\\\\\} where S \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{i\\\\\\\\} \\\\succeq_j S for all j\\\\in S. * A coalition structure \\\\pi is contractually individually stable if there is no player who belongs to a coalition willing to let him leave and who wants to join a coalition willing to have him. In other words, \\\\pi is contractually individually stable if ot\\\\exists i \\\\in N: (\\\\forall j \\\\in \\\\pi(i): \\\\pi(i) \\\\setminus \\\\\\\\{i\\\\\\\\} \\\\succeq_j \\\\pi(i)) ~\\\\land~ (\\\\exists C \\\\in \\\\pi: (C \\\\succ_i \\\\pi(i)) ~\\\\land~ (\\\\forall j \\\\in C: C \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{i\\\\\\\\} \\\\succeq_j C)) . One can also define Pareto optimality of a coalition structure. In the case that the preference relations are represented by utility functions, one can also consider coalition structures that maximize social welfare.  Examples  The following three-player game has been named \\"an undesired guest\\". \\\\begin{align} & \\\\\\\\{1,2\\\\\\\\} \\\\succ_1 \\\\\\\\{1\\\\\\\\} \\\\succ_1 \\\\\\\\{1,2,3\\\\\\\\}\\\\succ_1 \\\\\\\\{1,3\\\\\\\\}, \\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\\\\\{1,2\\\\\\\\} \\\\succ_2 \\\\\\\\{2\\\\\\\\} \\\\succ_2 \\\\\\\\{1,2,3\\\\\\\\}\\\\succ_2 \\\\\\\\{2,3\\\\\\\\}, \\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\\\\\{1,2,3\\\\\\\\} \\\\succ_3 \\\\\\\\{2,3\\\\\\\\} \\\\succ_3 \\\\\\\\{1,3\\\\\\\\} \\\\succ_3 \\\\\\\\{3\\\\\\\\}. \\\\end{align} From these preferences, we can see that 1 and 2 like each other, but dislike the presence of player 3. Consider the partition \\\\pi = \\\\\\\\{ \\\\\\\\{1,2\\\\\\\\}, \\\\\\\\{3\\\\\\\\} \\\\\\\\}. Notice that in \\\\pi, player 3 would prefer to join the coalition \\\\\\\\{1,2\\\\\\\\}, because \\\\\\\\{1,2,3\\\\\\\\} \\\\succ_3 \\\\\\\\{3\\\\\\\\}, and hence \\\\pi is not Nash- stable. However, if player 3 were to join \\\\\\\\{1,2\\\\\\\\}, player 1 (and also player 2) would be made worse off by this deviation, and so player 3's deviation does not contradict individual stability. Indeed, one can check that \\\\pi is individually stable. We can also see that there is no group S\\\\subseteq N of players such that each member of S prefers S to their coalition in \\\\pi and so the partition is also in the core. Another three-player example is known as \\"two is a company, three is a crowd\\". \\\\begin{align} &\\\\\\\\{1,2\\\\\\\\} \\\\succ_1 \\\\\\\\{1,3\\\\\\\\} \\\\succ_1 \\\\\\\\{1,2,3\\\\\\\\} \\\\succ_1 \\\\\\\\{1\\\\\\\\}, \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\\\\\{2,3\\\\\\\\} \\\\succ_2 \\\\\\\\{2,1\\\\\\\\} \\\\succ_2 \\\\\\\\{1,2,3\\\\\\\\} \\\\succ_2 \\\\\\\\{2\\\\\\\\}, \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\\\\\{3,1\\\\\\\\} \\\\succ_3 \\\\\\\\{3,2\\\\\\\\} \\\\succ_3 \\\\\\\\{1,2,3\\\\\\\\} \\\\succ_3 \\\\\\\\{3\\\\\\\\}. \\\\end{align} In this game, no partition is core-stable: The partition \\\\\\\\{ \\\\\\\\{1\\\\\\\\}, \\\\\\\\{2\\\\\\\\}, \\\\\\\\{3\\\\\\\\} \\\\\\\\} (where everyone is alone) is blocked by \\\\\\\\{1,2,3\\\\\\\\}; the partition \\\\\\\\{ \\\\\\\\{1,2,3\\\\\\\\} \\\\\\\\} (where everyone is together) is blocked by \\\\\\\\{1,2\\\\\\\\}; and partitions consisting of one pair and a singleton are blocked by another pair, because the preferences contain a cycle.  Concise representations and restricted preferences  Since the preference relations in a hedonic game are defined over the collection of all 2^{|N|-1} subsets of the player set, storing a hedonic game takes exponential space. This has inspired various representations of hedonic games that are concise, in the sense that they (often) only require polynomial space. * Individually rational coalition lists represent a hedonic game by explicitly listing the preference rankings of all agents, but only listing individually rational coalitions, that is coalitions S with S \\\\succcurlyeq_i \\\\\\\\{i\\\\\\\\}. For many solution concepts, it is irrelevant how precisely the player ranks unacceptable coalitions, since no stable coalition structure can contain a coalition that is not individually rational for one of the players. Note that if there are only polynomially many individually rational coalitions, then this representation only takes polynomial space. * Hedonic coalition nets represent hedonic games through weighted Boolean formulas. As an example, the weighted formula j \\\\land \\\\lnot k \\\\mapsto_i 5 means that player i receives 5 utility points in coalitions that include j but do not include k. This representation formalism is universally expressive and often concise (though, by necessity, there are some hedonic games whose hedonic coalition net representation requires exponential space). * Additively separable hedonic games are based on every player assigning numerical values to the other players; a coalition is as good for a player as the sum of the values of the players. Formally, additively separable hedonic games are those for which there exist valuations v_i(j) \\\\in \\\\mathbb R for every i,j \\\\in N such that for all players i and all coalitions S,T i i, we have S \\\\succcurlyeq_i T if and only if \\\\textstyle\\\\sum_{j\\\\in S} v_i(j) \\\\ge \\\\textstyle\\\\sum_{j\\\\in T} v_i(j). A similar definition, using the average rather than the sum of values, leads to the class of fractional hedonic games. * In anonymous hedonic games, players only care about the size of their coalition, and agents are indifferent between any two coalitions with the same cardinality: if |S= |Tthen S \\\\sim_i T. These games are anonymous in the sense that the identities of the individuals do not influence the preference ranking. * In Boolean hedonic games, each player has a Boolean formula whose variables are the other players. Each player prefers coalitions that satisfy its formula to coalitions that do not, but is otherwise indifferent. * In hedonic games with preferences depending on the worst player (or W-preferences), players have a preference ranking over players, and extend this ranking to coalitions by evaluating a coalition according to the (subjectively) worst player in it. Several similar concepts (such as B-preferences) have been defined.  Existence guarantees  digraph describes an additively separable hedonic game whose core is empty. It has five players (displayed as circled vertices). Any two players not connected by an arc have valuation -1000 for each other. Not every hedonic game admits a coalition structure that is stable. For example, we can consider the stalker game, which consists of just two players N = \\\\\\\\{1,2\\\\\\\\} with \\\\\\\\{1\\\\\\\\}\\\\succ_1 \\\\\\\\{1,2\\\\\\\\} and \\\\\\\\{1,2\\\\\\\\}\\\\succ_2 \\\\\\\\{2\\\\\\\\}. Here, we call player 2 the stalker. Notice that no coalition structure for this game is Nash-stable: in the coalition structure \\\\pi_1 = \\\\\\\\{\\\\\\\\{1\\\\\\\\}, \\\\\\\\{2\\\\\\\\}\\\\\\\\}, where both players are alone, the stalker 2 deviates and joins 1; in the coalition structure \\\\pi_2 = \\\\\\\\{\\\\\\\\{1, 2\\\\\\\\}\\\\\\\\}, where the players are together, player 1 deviates into the empty coalition so as to not be together with the stalker. There is a well-known instance of the stable roommates problem with 4 players that has empty core, and there is also an additively separable hedonic game with 5 players that has empty core and no individually stable coalition structures. For symmetric additively separable hedonic games (those that satisfy v_i(j) = v_j(i) for all i,j\\\\in N), there always exists a Nash-stable coalition structure by a potential function argument. In particular, coalition structures that maximize social welfare are Nash-stable. A similar argument shows that a Nash-stable coalition structure always exists in the more general class of subset-neutral hedonic games. However, there are examples of symmetric additively separable hedonic games that have empty core. Several conditions have been identified that guarantee the existence of a core coalition structure. This is the case in particular for hedonic games with the common ranking property, with the top coalition property, with top or bottom responsiveness, with descending separable preferences, and with dichotomous preferences. Moreover, common ranking property has been shown to guarantee the existence of a coalition structure which is core stable, individually stable and Pareto optimal at the same time.  Computational complexity  When considering hedonic games, the field of algorithmic game theory is usually interested in the complexity of the problem of finding a coalition structure satisfying a certain solution concept when given a hedonic game as input (in some concise representation). Since it is usually not guaranteed that a given hedonic game admits a stable outcome, such problems can often be phrased as a decision problem asking whether a given hedonic game admits stable outcome. In many cases, this problem turns out to be computationally intractable. One exception is hedonic games with common ranking property where a core coalition structure always exists, and it can be found in polynomial time. However, it is still NP-hard to find a Pareto optimal or socially optimal outcome. In particular, for hedonic games given by individually rational coalition lists, it is NP-complete to decide whether the game admits a core-stable, a Nash-stable, or an individually stable outcome. The same is true for anonymous games. For additively separable hedonic games, it is NP-complete to decide the existence of a Nash-stable or an individually stable outcome and complete for the second level of the polynomial hierarchy to decide whether there exists a core-stable outcome, even for symmetric additive preferences. These hardness results extend to games given by hedonic coalition nets. While Nash- and individually stable outcomes are guaranteed to exist for symmetric additively separable hedonic games, finding one can still be hard if the valuations v_i(j) are given in binary; the problem is PLS- complete. For the stable marriage problem, a core-stable outcome can be found in polynomial time using the deferred acceptance algorithm; for the stable roommates problem, the existence of a core-stable outcome can be decided in polynomial time if preferences are strict, but the problem is NP-complete if preference ties are allowed. Hedonic games with preferences based on the worst player behave very similarly to stable roommates problems with respect to the core, but there are hardness results for other solution concepts. Many of the preceding hardness results can be explained through meta-theorems about extending preferences over single players to coalitions.  Applications  = Robotics = For a robotic system consisting of multiple autonomous intelligent robots (e.g., swarm robotics), one of their decision making issues is how to make a robotic team for each of given tasks requiring collaboration of the robots. Such a problem can be called multi-robot task allocation or multi-robot coalition formation problem. This problem can be modelled as a hedonic game, and the preferences of the robots in the game may reflect their individual favours (e.g., possible battery consumption to finish a task) and/or social favours (e.g., complementariness of other robots' capabilities, crowdedness for shared resource). Some of the particular concerns in such robotics application of hedonic games relative to the other applications include the communication network topology of robots (e.g., the network is most likely partially connected network) and the need of a decentralised algorithm that finds a Nash-stable partition (because the multi-robot system is a decentralised system). This figure shows how each of 320 robots makes a decision in terms of which task it has to work with whom, by using the decentralised algorithm in. Here, each circle represents each robot, and the lines between them represent the communication network of the robots. Each square and its size indicate each of the given tasks and its task demand, respectively. The final result is a Nash-stable partition, where the robots form task-specific coalitions. Using anonymous hedonic games under SPAO(Single-Peaked-At-One) preference, a Nash-stable partition of decentralised robots, where each coalition is dedicated to each task, is guaranteed to be found within O(n_a^2 d_{G}) of iterations, where n_a is the number of the robots and d_G is their communication network diameter. Here, the implication of SPAO is robots' social inhibition (i.e., reluctancy of being together), which normally arises when their cooperation is subadditive.

Her teaching career began at the Montrose Academy at the age of fifteen; during her life, she taught in several states. She also published a book of Susquehanna County history in 1873. Blackman was an active Presbyterian and was active in several organizations, including the Women's Christian Temperance Union.  Early life  Blackman was born in Gilbertsville, New York, on July 15, 1826. Her parents were Dr. Josiah Blackman (1794‚Äì1875) and Clarissa Blackman (n√©e Camp; d. 1864). In 1829, they moved to Binghamton, New York. In 1836, they moved again, this time to Montrose, Pennsylvania. She gained much of her early education at the Montrose Academy. At some point, she studied music in New York City and Philadelphia. Blackman had two sisters, neither of whom were alive in 1900.  Career  Blackman became an assistant teacher at the Montrose Academy in 1841 or 1842 at the age of fifteen. She went on to teach at schools in Towanda and Chester, as well as in Wisconsin and Illinois. Blackman taught a range of subjects, including music. Between 1866 and 1868, she also taught at a Freedman's School in Okolona, Mississippi. In 1873, after four years of research and writing, Blackman published a history of Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania. It was titled History of Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania and was published in Philadelphia by Claxton, Remsen, & Haffelfinger. The book was well-received by critics at the time, and has been described as \\"a most carefully compiled and meritorious work, in the preparation of which she spent four years of earnest and painstaking research and labor\\" as well as \\"excellent and commendable\\". She also frequently contributed articles and letters to the local press.  Activism and personal life  Blackman traveled extensively during her life, crossing the continent twice and going overseas twice, in 1878 and 1889. From 1890 onward, she began spending time in Florida due to poor health; by 1900, she had spent nine winters and four summers there. Blackman was allegedly capable of reading the Bible in ten languages. She also spoke fluent French and German.

The museum was officially opened on 2 April 2001. The museum also educates visitors about water safety, and the museum collects global knowledge about flooding. The museum is located on the dike south of the village of Ouwerkerk; it is housed in the four caissons used to close the last gap in the dike following the flood. History =1993‚Äì2002: Beginnings= After the 40-year commemoration of the flood in 1993, a working group was formed under the leadership of Ria Geluk. In 1997, this group managed to get the museum project off the ground. A group of volunteers led by Evert Joosse, an architect from Kloetinge, started the Flood Museum in one of the caissons. In September and October 2000 a trial opening took place with the intention of letting the audience experience what the museum would be like. The facility was completed the following year. On 2 April 2001 the museum was officially opened by Monique de Vries, Minister of Transport, in the presence of volunteers, sponsors and invited guests. The Phoenix caissons were designed by the British in the Second World War to form Phoenix breakwaters as part of the artificial Mulberry harbours that were assembled as part of the follow-up to the Normandy landings, but these four reinforced concrete caissons were not used in the war. Instead they were used to close the last gap in the dike at Ouwerkerk in November 1953; these are the caissons that house the museum. =2003‚Äì2015: National Monument= Ouwerkerk Watersnood monument 1953 ‚Äì Weg van de Buitenlandsepers On November 6, 2003, fifty years after the closure of the last hole in the dike at Ouwerkerk, Minister Remkes declared the four caissons and the surrounding area a National Monument to the 1953 flood. In order to promote the interests of the National Monument, the Stichting Caissons Ouwerkerk (Foundation Caissons in Ouwerkerk) changed its name to Stichting Nationaal Monument Watersnood 1953 (Foundation National Monument of the 1953 Flood) and amended the articles of association. The surrounding area is also part of the National Monument. The creeks, a section of the old seawall, the reinforcements, the new seawall and the nature reserve surrounding the creeks all demonstrate the results of the flood of 1 February 1953. Between July 2008 and April 2009 the Flood Museum was expanded from one to all four caissons, and it was reopened on 23 April 2009 by Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende. The caissons are connected via underground corridors. In 2011, the Watersnoodmuseum won the Siletto Award. =Since 2016: National Knowledge and Memorial Centre= On January 30, 2016, the Flood Museum was designated as the \\"National Knowledge and Memorial Centre for the Flood of 1953\\" by the Minister for Infrastructure and Environment, Melanie Schultz van Haegen. Exhibits The Flood Museum's collection is divided between the four caissons in Ouwerkerk, each with its own theme. The first three caissons deal with the 1953 flood with the following themes: facts, emotions and reconstruction. The last caisson focusses on the future and how to live with water. =Caisson 1: Facts= The first caisson tells the story and background of the disaster which occurred on the night of 1 February 1953. There is also information on the first days after the storm: the temporary sealing of the dike hole with sandbags, the hundreds of boats that picked up victims from everywhere, and the aid that flowed quickly from many places. This caisson is also home to some of the historical footage taken by the Polygoon newsreel company as well as books and newspaper clippings. =Caisson 2: Emotions= The second caisson focusses on the people: the story of the victims and the impact on the survivors. The personal stories of the victims are told in the multimedia monument 1835+1. The \\"+1\\" refers to a baby known to have been born that night, but lost and never named. The niches along the corridor reflect the enormous impact of the disaster on those who survived the flood. Here are included the names of all victims, the monuments that were created throughout the affected area, and contemporary photographs. Also, the vigor of the people in their response is remembered: the relief supplies from around the world, thousands of volunteers, the repair of the dike and clean up after the devastation. At the end of the second caisson is information about the use of the caissons in the disaster area and the sealing of the gap at Ouwerkerk. =Caisson 3: Reconstruction= Caisson 3 tells the story of the reconstruction: the restoration of dikes and houses, and the redevelopment of the devastated landscape, the villages and towns. In the caisson is a replica, with original details, from one of the many pre-fabricated houses that were donated after the disaster (in particular from Scandinavia). Next to the house are machinery and equipment which were used in the dike repair. The latter part of the third caisson bridges the gap between 1953 and the present: changes in society, the modernisation of daily life and the new approach to water management in the Netherlands. =Caisson 4: Future= In the last caisson, the future of the Rhine‚ÄìMeuse‚ÄìScheldt delta is the main theme. Touchscreen tables, large screens and a reality-based game show how innovative projects in the field of safety, living and working, and nature influence and reinforce each other. The exhibition was renewed and re-opened on 1 February 2013. Rijkswaterstaat, closely involved with national water management, donated the display devices to the museum. At the end of the fourth caisson is the museum shop. Information from Staatsbosbeheer, the government agency responsible for forestry and nature reserves, and the is also available nearby.

It is found in the United States of America. Taxonomy and etymology A. microunicolor was originally described as a form of Antrodiaetus unicolor, an apparently very varied species. Brent Hendrixson and Jason Bond provided evidence, in 2005, that the two were separate species, based on the size difference and having different breeding seasons (when the male leaves his burrow in search of a female).Hendrixson, B. E. & Bond, J. E. (2005). Two sympatric species of Antrodiaetus from southwestern North Carolina (Araneae, Mygalomorphae, Antrodiaetidae). Zootaxa 872: 1-19. The specific name comes from a mixture of micro and unicolor, referring to the diminutive size of the species (compared to A. unicolor). Description A. microunicolor males lack a ventral macroseta on the first metatarsus distally. They are less than 4.50mm in length. The dorsal shield of the prosoma, the pedipalps and leg II- IV are greyish-tan, with distal segments lighter. Eyes underlined with black pigment. Femur I light greyish-tan, patella I greyish-brown, tibia, metatarsus and tarsus I orangish-red. Chelicerae darker than the dorsal shield of the prosoma. Sternum pale greyish-yellow, labium darker. Opisthosoma purplish- grey. Females are under 7mm in length. Dorsal shield of prosoma, opisthosoma, pedipalps, and legs yellowish-brown, head region slightly darker. Eyes underlined with black pigment. Chelicerae light brown. Sternum orangish-brown, labium darker. Abdomen yellowish-brown with faint purple pigment, cardiac mark weakly indicated as pale longitudinal band along midline. Biology Antrodiaetus microunicolor lives in burrows 8-10mm thick and 15‚Äì20 cm deep. These are variable in curvature, which is dictated by roots, stones, etcetera. They are slightly wider at both ends. It is lightly to heavily lined with silk and the collapsible turret is nearly perpendicular to the substrate. Antrodiaetus microunicolor lives at elevations of 690-1120m. It lives in a cool and humid climate, under a dense canopy of Quercus, Acer and Betula. Underneath consists of dense patches of Rhododendron maximum and Kalmia latifolia. The antrodiaetid makes its burrows under the bases of overhanging tree roots to prevent flooding. Aggregations of such burrows are typically found on stream banks and ravine slopes. The soil it makes its burrows in is wet and spongy, and also sandy and loam-like. Burrows are also found in moss mats, rock crevices and under decaying logs. The species is highly abundant at Coweeta (the type locality). Males begin searching for females at about late- October and finish in December, where as A. unicolor males begin searching in mid-September and stop in mid-October. There is no overlap recorded between the two species. Males of A. microunicolor take special care to conceal their burrows before the breeding season. Females also have a period of seasonal activity, though not so much is known about this. Females of A. unicolor found roughly during the male breeding season have no offspring and only a few are gravid, where as A. microunicolor found in their breeding season have 90-150 offspring scattered in their burrows. They feed on the multiple varied invertebrates available to them.

The series received mostly positive reviews from critics until its conclusion at issue 20 in June 2018. The story is about Dylan, a depressed college student who attempts suicide. He survives due to unlikely events, but is soon visited by a demon who explains he spared Dylan's life. In exchange, Dylan will be allowed to live one more month for every person he kills.

He wrote the scripts of several Gujarati films, including Hast Melap, Jesal Toral, Ghunghat, Raja Bharathari, Hothal Padamani and Valo Namori.  Early life  Mehta was born in Navagam, in a village near Gondal (now in Gujarat, India), Girdharlal and Muktabahen. He was influenced by his father's interest in literature and used to write and perform in drama plays. When he was six, he acted in a play produced by a drama company operating near his home. While in school, he wrote dialogue for dramas using quotes from Sanskrit Puranas, English plays and classic Gujarati books. When he was 17, he married Vijayagauri, a distant relative of Gujarati poet Amrut Ghayal.  Career  In 1955, he joined the drama company of Irani Sheth. He later accepted a government job for a higher salary, but found it unsuitable. He left the job and worked as a proof reader before moving to Mumbai. With the help of Mansukh Joshi, he joined the Indian National Theatre, a drama institute there, with a monthly salary of 100 rupees. He wrote two plays, Soodi vachche Sopari and Hu Eno Var Chhu. These plays caught the attention of Kalpana Diwan, a Gujarati actress and producer. She gave him shelter for six years. In 1969, he wrote a few scenes for the Gujarati film Hasta Melap when its writer Chaturbhuj Doshi, who was ill, was impressed and made him scriptwriter. He played a supporting role in that film. He played a comedian in Ravindra Dave's film Jesal Toral (1971), when their actor-comedian Krishnakant had to drop out due to an accident. He succeeded in the role of comedian and acted in more than 190 films. He wrote scripts for 22 films, some not credited. He became a successful actor, and was credited as Siti-Samtrat (The Whistle King) in his film Retina Ratan as film-goers used to whistle when his name appeared in the credits. His comic dual with Rajanibala and later with Manjari Desai became popular. Manjari Desai died in an accident in which Ramesh Mehta survived.

It parodies German media in general (akin to the Scary Movie series), but puts particular emphasis on parodying the German Edgar Wallace productions of the 1960s and 1970s.

He is most notable for the Elliott 6m an Olympic-class keelboat selected for the women's match racing event for the 2012 Olympics. He has designed yachts that have won all four Blue Water Classic races, the Fastnet Race, the Transpacific Yacht Race, the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race, and the Transatlantic Race. He has also designed several yachts that hold or held world records including Mari-Cha IV. Early career Greg started his career with a boat building apprenticeship in Auckland. He then started building boats to his own designs and due to their success in races around New Zealand started receiving commissions for other designs. Youth Scheme In 1987 the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron recognised they didn't have enough crew to compete in the America's Cup. They commissioned a fleet of Elliott 5.9's for their Youth Keelboat Programme. Many of New Zealand's successful America's Cup sailors learned their craft on these boats and their successors the Elliott 6. The success of the Elliott 5.9 for youth sailing schemes lead to their adoption around New Zealand. Elliott 6m The Elliott 6m is an Olympic-class keelboat, designed by New Zealander, Greg Elliott. It was selected for the women's match racing event for the 2012 Olympics. The Elliott 6m carries a spinnaker pole and symmetric spinnaker which is considered more suitable for match racing. Mari-Cha IV Mari-Cha IV is a sailing superyacht built as a two-masted schooner. The boat was ordered by Robert Miller with the particular goal of winning sailing records. The yacht has waterline length of 40.2 m, a width of 9.6 m, and a displacement of 50 t. It was equipped with a canting keel with a 10 t keel bulb, which is able to exert a much larger righting moment then a conventional keel. On October 9, 2003, Mari-Cha IV improved the previous record for fastest west- east transatlantic passage by a sailing monohull by more than two days, with total time of 6 days, 17h, 15m and 39s. During the run, she also won the record for longest 24h distance sailed, with 525.5 nautical miles. This record was only broken 13 years later, in 2016, by Comanche. Mari-Cha IV gained particular distinction in 2005, when she broke the 100-year-old record for fastest monohull Atlantic crossing under regatta conditions (as opposed to solo runs, where the team can wait for optimal weather projections), previously established by Atlantic under Charlie Barr during the 1905 Kaiser's Cup. During the 2005 Rolex Transatlantic Challenge she beat out another Greg Elliott design Maximus for line honours and set the new record of 9 days, 15 hours, 55 minutes and 23 seconds. Maximus Maximus is a 100 ft maxi yacht built by TP Cookson for Charles St. Clair Brown; The boat was designed by Greg Elliott and Clay Oliver and launched in Auckland in February 2005. For the 2005 summer sailing season in the UK, Maximus was sponsored by ICAP. She won line honours in the Fastnet Race with a time of 68 hours 2 minutes 7 seconds, though Iromiguy won on corrected time. Despite the very calm conditions, her tall rotating rigging allowed higher wind speeds some distance above the water's surface to be accessible, giving her an advantage over rivals. ICAP sponsored Maximus again for the 2006 season. Maximus was acquired by accountant Anthony Bell and renamed Investec LOYAL. She underwent modifications by Greg Elliott, came second to Wild Oats XI in 2010 and won line honours in the 2011 Sydney to Hobart in a very close race.

The film stars \\"Winston Man\\" David Goerlitz, former president of the World Medical Association Dr. Delon Human, and former executive director at the World Health Organization Dr. Derek Yach. The United Nations‚Äô World Health Organization projects that a billion people will die prematurely from smoking this century. In the next 20 years, there will be nearly 1.6 billion smokers around the world. A Billion Lives takes a critical look at the history of smoking and the corruption that has led to the current situation where safer, healthier alternatives are banned or heavily restricted in most countries, while the cigarette trade is continually protected. The film examines major conflicts of interest and corruption between governments, big pharmaceutical companies, and public health officials. It also takes a look at the history of e-cigarettes, as well as the role vapor technology and Swedish Snus has played in the current health crisis. Synopsis As the film begins, viewers are confronted by a claim that \\"this century a billion people are projected to die from smoking.\\" The film continues to show the depth of harm tobacco can cause to human health, including increased risk of lung cancer, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. A Billion Lives continues by outlining the history of the tobacco industry, focusing primarily on tobacco corporations' attempts to hide the deleterious effects of tobacco and tobacco products. Many shots are accompanied and framed with interviews of the former Winston Man, David Goerlitz; Goerlitz, formerly the main model in a campaign by Winston Cigarettes to glamorize smoking, publicly denounced the tobacco industry in the late 1980s. The second segment of the film shifts focus from the tobacco industry to the e-cigarette and vaping industry. Showcasing interviews and talks by Dr. Derek Yach, a former World Health Organization tobacco control chief; Clive Bates, a prominent anti-smoking activist; and many other experts, Biebert narrates the possibility that e-cigarettes may be able to save a majority of the billion lives that could be lost to tobacco. The final section of the film centers on the attempts the tobacco industry has made to stop e-cigarettes from encroaching on the money-making abilities of the large multinational corporations involved. Set as an exploration of the reasons many people are critical toward vaping, the third act of the film shows how money is integral to the tobacco industry's survival. Tackling issues such as the involvement of pharmaceutical corporations and even governments in dealings with tobacco companies, the documentary reaches out to find out why there is such a negative bias toward vaping. Culminating in an extensive breakdown of how much money lies in the hands of tobacco industries, A Billion Lives covers a wide range of topics related to smoking. Development The development of this documentary was led by Biebert; a filmmaker and director based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. A director and executive producer at Attention Era Media, Biebert previously consulted and helped produce music videos, event films, sport highlight films, and social media storytelling films. A Billion Lives is his first feature film. Biebert first became interested in the vaping and tobacco industry when scouting ideas for his first feature film. After researching medical facts about tobacco and vapor and finding that one billion people were projected to die from tobacco this century, Biebert became passionate about documenting the subject. In an interview with Vape Craft Incorporated, he stated: \\"I became angry ... since those initial feelings, the topic has become very personal to me\\".

Now just , the property includes a c. 1815 Federal style farmhouse, and a well-preserved early 19th century English barn. The farmstead was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. Description and history The Parker Farm is located in a rural area of central northern Cavendish, on the west side of Brook Road about north of its junction with Atkinson and Center Roads. The farm's remaining are roughly divided in half by the road, with a woodlot on the east side of the road, and a mown meadow and the farm buildings on the west side. The house, set near the road, is a 2-1/2 story brick building, with a side gable roof and end chimneys. The front facade is five bays wide and symmetrical, with a center entrance topped by a transom window. The first-floor bays of the front facade are all topped by blind arches. A modern single-story garage extends northward from the right side of the house, and an older wood frame structure extends to the rear. The barn stands just northwest of the house, and is set further back from the road. The oldest portion of the house, its rear ell, was built about 1795 by Aaron Parker Jr., the son of one of Cavendish's early settlers. Sometime in the 1810s, he built the brick main block to which it is now attached; this is based on stylistic evidence, as the blind arches on the front are a feature typically found only in Vermont houses from that period. Other stylistic elements of the house are clearly drawn from the published patterns of Asher Benjamin, a resident of nearby Windsor who published the nation's first architectural pattern book, the 1797 Country Builder's Assistant. The house remained in the hands of Parker's descendants until 1933.

Its semi-hemispherical cast turret (resembling an upturned soup bowl), became the hallmark of post-war Soviet tanks. Its pike nose design would also be mirrored by other tanks of the IS tank family such as the IS-7 and T-10. Too late to see combat in World War II, the IS-3 participated in the Berlin Victory Parade of 1945, in the border conflict during the Sino-Soviet split, the Soviet invasion of Hungary, the Prague Spring and on both sides of the Six-Day War. Design and production Object 703 was developed in late 1944 by Factory No.100 Kirovskiy Works or ChTZ (in Chelyabinsk) and left the factory shop in May 1945.Russian armored vehicles. XX Century. Volume 3: 1945‚Äì1965 , 2010. This tank had an improved armour layout, and a semi- hemispherical cast turret (resembling an upturned soup bowl), which became the hallmark of post-war Soviet tanks. While this low, hemispherical turret improved protection, it also significantly diminished crew headroom, especially for the loader. The low turret also limited the maximum depression of the main gun, since the gun breech had little room inside the turret to elevate, and this limited the extent to which the IS-3 could take advantage of hull-down positions.Perrett 1987:21 The IS-3's pointed prow earned it the nickname Shchuka (Pike) by its crews. It weighed slightly less and stood lower than previous versions. Wartime production resulted in many mechanical problems and a hull weldline that had a tendency to crack open.ZALOGA IS-2 HEAVY TANK 1944-73 P19 The IS-3 came too late to see action in World War II. The first public demonstration of the IS-3 came on 7 September 1945 during the Allied victory parade on Charlottenburger Stra√üe in Berlin, with the heavily reinforced 71st Guards Heavy Tank Regiment of the 2nd Guards Tank Army. Starting in 1960, the IS-3 was slightly modernized as the IS-3M, in a manner similar to the IS2M. The IS-3 was a significant improvement to the IS-1 and IS-2 due to its pike nose frontal armor. Having frontal hull armor that was already pre-angled meant that less armor was needed to maintain the same effective armor thickness on the upper glacis. Combat history Three pre- series vehicles were assigned to an independent Guards Battalion but they arrived after peace broke out. There are unconfirmed reports of them fighting Jagdpanthers after the surrender. They also took part in the September 7th, 1945 victory parade in Berlin under the 71st Guards Heavy Tank Regiment of the 2nd Guards Tank Army. In response to border disputes between the Soviet Union and China, some Soviet IS-3s were dug in as fixed pillboxes along the Soviet- Chinese border. The IS-3 was used in the 1956 Soviet invasion of Hungary and the Prague Spring in 1968. During the early 1950s, all IS-3s were modernized as IS-3M models. The Egyptian Army acquired about 100 IS-3M tanks from the Soviet Union. During the Six-Day War, a single regiment of IS-3M tanks was stationed with the Egyptian 7th Infantry Division at Rafah and the 125th Tank Brigade of the 6th Mechanized Division at Kuntilla was also equipped with about 60 IS-3M tanks.Zaloga 1994, p. 39. Israeli infantry and paratrooper units had considerable difficulty with the IS-3M when it was encountered due to its thick armor, which shrugged off hits from normal infantry anti-tank weapons such as the bazooka. Even the 90 mm AP shell fired by the main gun of the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) M48 Patton tanks could not penetrate the frontal armor of the IS-3s at normal battle ranges. There were a number of engagements between the M48A2 Pattons of the IDF 7th Armored Brigade and IS-3s supporting Egyptian positions at Rafah in which several M48A2s were knocked out in the fighting. However, in one engagement between a battalion of IS-3s and 90 mm gun-armed M48A3's, seven IS-3s were destroyed. The slow rate of fire, poor engine performance (the engine was not well suited to hot-climate operations), and rudimentary fire control of the IS-3s proved to be a significant handicap, and about 73 IS-3s were lost in the 1967 war. Most Egyptian IS-3 tanks were withdrawn from service, though at least one regiment was retained in service as late as the 1973 October war. The IDF itself experimented with a few captured IS-3M tanks, but found them ill-suited to fast-moving desert tank warfare; those that were not scrapped were turned into stationary defensive pillbox emplacements in the Jordan River area. After the Korean War, China attempted to reverse-engineer the IS-2/IS-3 as the Type 122 medium tank. The project was cancelled in favor of the Type 59, a copy of the Soviet T-54A.

The rank is related to several outstanding problems in number theory, most notably the Birch‚ÄìSwinnerton-Dyer conjecture. It is widely believed that there is no maximum rank for an elliptic curve, and it has been shown that there exist curves with rank as large as 28, but it is widely believed that such curves are rare. Indeed, Goldfeld D. Goldfeld, Conjectures on elliptic curves over quadratic fields, in Number Theory, Carbondale 1979 (Proc. Southern Illinois Conf., Southern Illinois Univ., Carbondale, Ill., 1979), Lecture Notes in Math. 751, Springer-Verlag, New York, 1979, pp. 108‚Äì118. . . . and later Katz‚ÄìSarnak N. M. Katz and P. Sarnak, Random Matrices, Frobenius Eigenvalues, and Monodromy, Amer. Math. Soc. Colloq. Publ. 45, Amer. Math. Soc., 1999. . . conjectured that in a suitable asymptotic sense (see below), the rank of elliptic curves should be 1/2 on average. In other words, half of all elliptic curves should have rank 0 (meaning that the infinite part of its Mordell‚ÄìWeil group is trivial) and the other half should have rank 1; all remaining ranks consist of a total of 0% of all elliptic curves. Heights Mordell‚ÄìWeil's theorem shows E(\\\\mathbb{Q}) is a finitely generated abelian group, thus E(\\\\mathbb{Q})\\\\cong E(\\\\mathbb{Q})_{tors} \\\\times \\\\mathbb{Z}^r where E(\\\\mathbb{Q})_{tors} is the finite torsion subgroup and r is the rank of the elliptic curve. In order to obtain a reasonable notion of 'average', one must be able to count elliptic curves E/\\\\mathbb{Q} somehow. This requires the introduction of a height function on the set of rational elliptic curves. To define such a function, recall that a rational elliptic curve E/\\\\mathbb{Q} can be given in terms of a Weierstrass form, that is, we can write : E: y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B for some integers A, B. Moreover, this model is unique if for any prime number p such that p^4 divides A, we have p^6 mid B . We can then assume that A,B are integers that satisfy this property and define a height function on the set of elliptic curves E/\\\\mathbb{Q} by : H(E) = H(E(A,B)) = \\\\max\\\\\\\\{4|A|^3, 27B^2\\\\\\\\}. It can then be shown that the number of elliptic curves E/\\\\mathbb{Q} with bounded height H(E) is finite. Average rank We denote by r(E) the Mordell‚ÄìWeil rank of the elliptic curve E/\\\\mathbb{Q}. With the height function H(E) in hand, one can then define the \\"average rank\\" as a limit, provided that it exists: : \\\\lim_{X \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{H(E(A,B)) \\\\leq X} r(E)}{\\\\sum_{H(E(A,B)) \\\\leq X} 1}. It is not known whether or not this limit exists. However, by replacing the limit with the limit superior, one can obtain a well-defined quantity. Obtaining estimates for this quantity is therefore obtaining upper bounds for the size of the average rank of elliptic curves (provided that an average exists). Upper bounds for the average rank In the past two decades there has been some progress made towards the task of finding upper bounds for the average rank. A. Brumer A. Brumer, The average rank of elliptic curves. I, Invent. Math. 109 (1992), 445‚Äì472. . . . showed that, conditioned on the Birch‚ÄìSwinnerton-Dyer conjecture and the Generalized Riemann hypothesis that one can obtain an upper bound of 2.3 for the average rank. Heath-Brown showed D. R. Heath-Brown, The average analytic rank of elliptic curves, Duke Math. J. 122 (2004), 591‚Äì623. . . . that one can obtain an upper bound of 2 , still assuming the same two conjectures. Finally, Young showed M. P. Young, Low- lying zeros of families of elliptic curves, J. Amer. Math. Soc. 19 (2006), 205‚Äì250. . . . that one can obtain a bound of 25/14 ; still assuming both conjectures. Bhargava and Shankar showed that the average rank of elliptic curves is bounded above by 1.5 M. Bhargava and A. Shankar, Binary quartic forms having bounded invariants, and the boundedness of the average rank of elliptic curves, Annals of Mathematics 181 (2015), 191‚Äì242 and \\\\frac{7}{6} M. Bhargava and A. Shankar, Ternary cubic forms having bounded invariants, and the existence of a positive proportion of elliptic curves having rank 0, Annals of Mathematics 181 (2015), 587‚Äì621 without assuming either the Birch‚ÄìSwinnerton-Dyer conjecture or the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis. This is achieved by computing the average size of the 2-Selmer and 3-Selmer groups of elliptic curves E/\\\\mathbb{Q} respectively. =Bhargava and Shankar's approach= Bhargava and Shankar's unconditional proof of the boundedness of the average rank of elliptic curves is obtained by using a certain exact sequence involving the Mordell-Weil group of an elliptic curve E/\\\\mathbb{Q}. Denote by E(\\\\mathbb{Q}) the Mordell-Weil group of rational points on the elliptic curve E, \\\\operatorname{Sel}_p(E) the p-Selmer group of E, and let –®{}_E[p] denote the p-part of the Tate‚ÄìShafarevich group of E. Then we have the following exact sequence 0 \\\\rightarrow E(\\\\mathbb{Q})/p E(\\\\mathbb{Q}) \\\\rightarrow \\\\operatorname{Sel}_p(E) \\\\rightarrow –® {}_E[p] \\\\rightarrow 0. This shows that the rank of \\\\operatorname{Sel}_p(E) , also called the p-Selmer rank of E, defined as the non-negative integer s such that \\\\\\\\# \\\\operatorname{Sel}_p(E) = p^s, is an upper bound for the Mordell-Weil rank r of E(\\\\mathbb{Q}). Therefore, if one can compute or obtain an upper bound on p-Selmer rank of E, then one would be able to bound the Mordell-Weil rank on average as well. In Binary quartic forms having bounded invariants, and the boundedness of the average rank of elliptic curves, Bhargava and Shankar computed the 2-Selmer rank of elliptic curves on average. They did so by counting binary quartic forms, using a method used by Birch and Swinnerton- Dyer in their original computation of the analytic rank of elliptic curves which led to their famous conjecture. Largest known ranks A common conjecture is that there is no bound on the largest possible rank for an elliptic curve. In 2006, Noam Elkies discovered an elliptic curve with a rank of at least 28: :y2 \\\\+ xy + y = x3 ‚àí x2 ‚àí x + In 2020, Elkies and Zev Klagsbrun discovered a curve with a rank of exactly 20: :y2 \\\\+ xy + y = x3 ‚àí x2 \\\\- x + References Elliptic curves Analytic number theory ","title":"Rank of an elliptic curve"},{"id":"51244944","text":"Malyoun (Album) (English: Million) (Arabic: ŸÖŸÑŸäŸàŸÜ) is the third studio album by Jordanian rock band JadaL.

She was born in Santo Amaro, Bahia, and initiated in Candombl√© in Salvador by Bangboshe Obitik√¥ (Rodolfo Martins de Andrade). She was a devotee of deity Oshun and became the iyakeker√™, or second most important leader, in the terreiro of Jo√£o Alab√° in Rio de Janeiro. \\"Ciata\\", the name by which she is now known, is a variant on the Arabic name Aycha; it was a common feminine name among the Muslim community from Portuguese Guinea that formerly resided in Rio de Janeiro. Tia Ciata arrived in Rio de Janeiro in 1876 at the age of 22 and worked as a vendor at a food stall. She lived on Rua Visconde de Itauna in the neighborhood of Pra√ßa Onze (now Cidade Nova), an area which became known as \\"Pequena √Åfrica\\", or Little Africa. It was here that Tia Ciata became one of the main progenitors of Afro-Brazilian culture of early favelas of Rio de Janeiro. Samba musicians, composers, and dancers regularly gathered in her home; her residence may be one of the birthplaces of the genre. The first samba recording, Pelo Telefone, a composition by Donga (Ernesto Joaquim Maria dos Santos) and Mauro de Almeida, was recorded in the residence. Like Tia Citata, the vocalist of Pelo Telefone was from Santo Amaro, Bahia. She married Jo√£o Batista da Silva, and had fourteen children. The couple became noted figures in Pequena √Åfrica of Rio, and Tia Ciata was honored annually at the Rio Carnival until her death in Rio de Janeiro in 1924.

The song was her first release after breaking from Capitol Records and Dave Matthews' record label, ATO Records, and discusses the discrimination and bureaucracy present in the music industry. It was released as the lead single from her sixth album, Funstyle, and was subject to negative reviews from critics, who criticized Phair's vocal performance and the production.  Background  Following the commercial disappointment of \\"Somebody's Miracle,\\" which was her first album since \\"Exile in Guyville\\" to fail to reach the Top 40 of the Billboard 200, Liz Phair left Capitol records and signed to ATO Records, Dave Matthews' record label, in 2008. She composed some of the songs for her next album, Funstyle, while she was signed to ATO, but after the label refused to release the music, she asked to leave. She then signed to the indie rock label Rocket Science Records, on which she released Funstyle.  Composition \\"Bollywood\\" was released about two years after her split from ATO; like many of the songs on \\"Funstyle,\\" \\"Bollywood\\" mocks the record industry, discussing sexism and ageism, and the confusing nature of record deals. The song incorporates sound effects & vocal processing. The song itself lasts two minutes and twenty-two seconds, though twenty seconds of silence are appended to the end of the track on Funstyle.  Critical reception  The single was panned by critics. Entertainment Weekly's Leah Greenblatt proclaimed that the single demonstrated that \\"the Exile in Guyville Liz Phair we once knew and loved has officially left the building,\\" while Jody Rosen at Rolling Stone awarded the single one out of five stars and stated: \\"As tabla-laden electro tinkles behind her, Phair tells a tale of music-biz misadventure, 'rapping' in a voice that sounds like a soccer mom impersonating Ke$ha,\\" concluding that the song was \\"an insult to rappers everywhere, even the terrible ones.\\" The Village Voice ranked \\"Bollywood\\" at #14 on their list of the 20 worst songs of 2010, calling her rapping \\"sub-Madonna at best\\". Some critics defended Phair, however, arguing that the song is one of her most honest songs. In The Guardian, Priya Alan argued that the song demonstrated that Phair had \\"returned to form\\" and concluded that the song is \\"the most uninhibited, alive and honest she's sounded in years.\\" References External links *Full Lyrics (available through MetroLyrics) *Hear the Song (via YouTube) 2010 songs Liz Phair songs Songs written by Liz Phair ","title":"Bollywood (Liz Phair song)"},{"id":"51245116","text":"Sarupwal is a village in Sultanpur Lodhi tehsil in Kapurthala district of Punjab, India.

The shell contains 8 moderately rounded whorls and a smooth protoconch. The sculpture shows 16-18 long transverse ribs extending across the whorls, fasciole and all. These are crossed by numerous (eleven on the last whorl but one) elevated, even, rounded threads, with about equal or wider interspaces. The threads are not swollen at the intersections. The suture is distinct. The fasciole but slightly excavated. On the body whorl, a quarter of a turn before the adult aperture is formed, is a prominent swollen rounded varix, or rib.

It was active in preventing the burial of Muslim Tunisians who had adopted French nationality in Muslim cemeteries. These riots revived the Tunisian national movement, which had been weakened after the 1926-28 repression.  Background  = First naturalization laws = The first laws allowing Tunisians to obtain French citizenship were enacted in 1887, six years after the protectorate's establishment. The law of July 29, 1887, specified: This law was superseded without major amendments by the decrees of February 28, 1899, October 2, 1910, August 20, 1914 and November 8, 1921. The 1910 law only extended the possibility of applying for naturalization to Tunisian husbands of French women (with children), to holders of higher degrees (at that time, these could only be earned in France), and to those who had been deemed medically unfit to serve in the armed forces., http://fsagues.free.fr/Documents/Albert_Articles/1928-11-16-Naturalisation- Tunisie.htm accessed 6/5/2017 However, the reactions to the 1921 decree, which eased the access to French citizenship for foreigners (mostly Jews and Italians) born in Tunisia,http://francois.minardi.free.fr/Docs_Famille/DocumentsOfficiels/Passeport.html accessed 6/5/2017 were lively. Some Tunisian newspapers criticized this \\"attack on Tunisian citizenship\\" and argued that foreigners in Tunisia could be given Tunisian nationality. On the other hand, others found it normal for Christian foreigners born in Tunisia to seek French citizenship rather than Tunisian. The first \\"official\\" opposition came from An-Nasir bey on April 8, 1922, when he threatened to abdicate if his 18 requests were not satisfied. The ninth point demanded the \\"absolute abolition of the Tunisian naturalization decree, both for those who have served in the army and for those who have not\\". However the Bey was soon compelled to withdraw his demands. The number of naturalizations was, at the time, negligible:, Link, * 1891-1898: 23 Jews * 1899-1910: 101 Jews * 1911-1919: 77 Muslims and 213 Jews * 1920: 22 adults and 6 children, including 2 Jews * 1921: 10 adults and 9 children, including 9 Jews * 1922: 33 adults and 24 children, including 29 Jews * 1923: 39 adults and 25 children, including 30 Jews = Law of December 20, 1923 = The concern of the French government about the size of the Italian population in Tunisia and the rise of fascism in Italy encouraged France to enact the law of December 20, 1923 easing access to French citizenship for Tunisians. Under these provisions, those who could apply for French citizenship were:, * Baccalaureate graduates of Sadiki College, of √âmile-Loubet Vocational School, normal schools or holders of the Arab higher certificate * Veterans of World War I or those who had a father or son who had died in the service, or three sons who had served and survived * Tunisians who had worked for ten years in the French public administration or in a French business * Tunisians who had at least five children in French schools * Tunisians deemed to have \\"contributed to the French mission\\" in general One of the first Tunisians to oppose the law was Tahar Haddad who feared the desertion of his countrymen interested in the material benefits of naturalization. On November 13, 1923, he denounced \\"the opening for naturalizations means, at the minimum, that France wants Tunisians to become French one day. Is this not enough to prove that the French government is eager to suppress the Tunisian nation and the state that represents it, a state that France is committed by treaty to respect and even to defend?\\", The Destour party also tried to oppose this law by organizing a campaign of telegrams. Their attempts to secure condemnation by the religious authorities werevhow vet in vain. Habib Bey eventually signed the new law into effect, putting an end to their campaign, weakening the nationalist party., = Naturalizations following the 1923 law = The major beneficiaries of this law were Tunisian Jews, eager to escape the jurisdiction of Tunisian courts which essentially applied Islamic law. From the beginnings of the protectorate, many of them had elected to send their children to French schools. Thus, they now met the conditions for obtaining French citizenship. In 1924, 284 Jews applied for naturalization, as well as 62 Muslims. Between 1924 and 1930, the number of applicants increased to 5300 Jews and 1150 Muslims. Their motivations were mostly prosaic: almost all of the applicants were minor officials attracted by the so-called 'colonial third', whereby French citizens were paid a salary one third higher than that paid to Tunisians. Lucien Saint, the Resident-General of France, who was the originator of this law, wanted to weaken the nationalist movement by attracting its better-educated members. However, he only managed to attract the sarcasm of the most racist colonialists, who mocked these new citizens who barely spoke French. When he left Tunisia on January 2, 1929, he did not know that he was leaving his successor Fran√ßois Manceron,a time bomb that would re-animate the Tunisian national movement once again. = National movement of 1932 = The decrees enacted by Lucien Saint in 1926 led the members of Destour to act with discretion. The economic prosperity of the country in that period did not help them mobilize inhabitants. Waiting for more favourable conditions, they focused on setting up Destourian cells in the countryside and created numerous labor unions in each corporation. Literary, artistic and theatrical companies travelled the country in order to maintain the national sentiment. Nationalist newspapers in Arabic or French were also developing., November 1, 1932 saw the publication of the first edition of L'Action Tunisienne managed by Habib Bourguiba, Mahmoud El Materi, Bahri Guiga, M'hamed Bourguiba, Tahar Sfar and Ali Bouhageb., Soon, the effects of the Great Depression reached Tunisia and discontent grew in the country. These young nationalists felt that a good cause would be sufficient to revive the National movement on a new basis.  Naturalized crisis  = 1931 World Islamic Congress of Jerusalem = The nomination of Abdelaziz Th√¢albi as a representative of Tunisia to the 1931 World Islamic Congress drew the attention of Tunisians to the conclusions of the meeting, including \\"the desperate struggle against the naturalization of Muslims in Islamic countries administered by France\\". The strong popularity of the Destourian leader in exile brought the naturalization issue to the fore once again, especially as the time was favorable to religious renewal, as may be seen from the motion of the Tunisian section of the Grand Council, in favor of Koranic schools and Ez-Zitouna University. = Burials =  Bizerte burial  On December 31, 1932, upon the announcement of the death of a naturalized French muslim, Mohamed Chaabane, in Bizerte, individuals gathered in the Muslim cemetery with the firm intention of opposing his burial there. Rumors spread which led the city's Mufti, Idriss Cherif, to issue a Fatwa, justifying this refusal. In order to avoid bloodshed, his widow, a Catholic Frenchwoman, agreed to bury him in the European cemetery. On that same day, a spahi of Bizerte, also a naturalized French citizen, had to call the local authorities to intervene in order to bury one of his young sons in the Muslim cemetery., All these acts were celebrated as a great victory by the nationalist media. L'Action Tunisienne started a newspaper campaign that caused violent protests in Hammam Lif, Ferryville and Kairouan.  Fatwa of Muhammad al-Tahir ibn Ashur  Portrait of Muhammad al-Tahir ibn Ashur. In order to remove any ambiguity about burial rights, Resident-General Fran√ßois Manceron asked for Cheikh el Islam Muhammad al-Tahir ibn Ashur's advice, in April 1933. The fatwa issued by in response the \\"Sharaa\\" court was very ambiguous; it maintained that a Muslim who adopts the nationality of a non- Muslim country is an apostate, but added that if he repents, even verbally, before his death, his burial in Muslim cemeteries is acceptable., Learning of this maneuver, the Destourians denounced collusion between the French and the religious authorities. Manceron, therefore, informed the French minister of foreign affairs, Joseph Paul-Boncour, of his failure: The Resident-General was not mistaken: When the new fatwa was confirmed, students of Ez-Zitouna started a strike and demanded the removal of its author. Their demand was successful on September 30, 1933.,  Upsurge of protests  When rumors regarding the drafting of a fatwa favorable to the Residence spread, the representative of Constantine in the French chamber of deputies, √âmile Morinaud, demanded that the Minister of Foreign Affairs accelerate the naturalization policy, on April 6., On April 15 and April 16, 1933, unrest started in the Tunis neighbourhood of Halfaouine on the announcement of the death of Moussa Ben Sa√Ød, a naturalized Frenchman. Law enforcement could not handle the turmoil and were replaced by Senegalese Tirailleurs who dealt with the insurrection. Calm was only restored when the protesters learned that Ben Said was alive. On April 21, the Grand Vizier Hedi Lakhoua published a proclamation by which, Ahmad II bey, declaring himself as a defender of Muslim religion, asked his subjects for peace, defended Sharaa and warned troublemakers against the harmful aftermaths of their acts. His intervention had no effect, and to avoid riots, naturalized were buried in European cemeteries like in Kairouan, La Manouba, El Kef and Souk El Arba., On May 1, the inhabitants of Tunis inhabitants started protests once again in order to stop the burial of Mrs Keba√Øli, whose husband was the chairman of the Muslim League of France. The Resident-General yielded, days later, ordering the burial of French Muslims in specially-designated cemeteries., On August 7, bloodshed occurred in Monastir. Despite the Resident's decree forbidding the burial of naturalized French in Muslim cemeteries, Sousse's civil controller, Andr√© Graignic, forced the burial of a naturalized official's child, Abdesselem Essayadi. People decided to protest against this decision and soon violence was used: The crowd started throwing stones at the funeral oration while soldiers shot the protesters, leading to numerous injured and one dead, Chaabane El Bhouti nicknamed Kherfoucha. Following the events, Graignic and the ca√Ød of Monastir were dismissed from their posts.,  Distribution of an anonymous fatwa on May 4  Frontpage of L'Action Tunisienne, on May 4, 1933. To express his disagreement with al-Tahir ibn Ashur, Mohamed Bechir Naifer (1889-1974), imam in Ez-Zitouna Mosque, wrote a fatwa specifying that a Muslim seeking naturalization was considered to have renounced his faith. The fatwa also made clear the conditions of repentance so that a naturalized had the right to be buried in a Muslim cemetery. This fatwa was countersigned by his brother Ibrahim Naifer. In order to avoid reprisals against the writers of the text, it was copied and signed by Muhammed Salah Naifer (1902-1993) who transmitted it to L'Action Tunisienne journal., The fatwa was published anonymously on May 4: The absence of signatures was justified by the editors of the paper: \\"In order not to put these teachers in an awkward position towards the administration and avoid the retaliation of \\"Sidi Tahar,\\" we will not publish their names that we keep for ourselves\\". However, Muhammed Salah Naifer was suspended from his duties, in the midst of May.  Aftermaths  = Creation of special cemeteries = A decree enacted on May 6, 1933 established special cemeteries for naturalized. French citizens Civil controllers were responsible for the creation of these cemeteries in towns where the mood of the inhabitants made it necessary. These special cemeteries were known to common people as \\"carrion cemeteries\\". It was heartbreaking for those Muslims who could not be buried near their families. At least 70 sought to restore their Tunisian citizenship in their letters addressed to the Resident-General. In these letters, they begged him to \\"erase their French citizenship\\" and to give them back Tunisian citizenship so they could be buried with their dead and save their families from shame and despair. One of them, a retired peacekeeper in Kairouan wrote: Tunisian socialists relayed these requests to Paris, but the government responded that \\"French citizenship cannot be lost unless the French government determines that it should deprive one who freely sought it\\"., = Reviving Tunisian nationalism = The success of popular mobilization galvanized activists to such a point that they demanded the holding of an extraordinary Destour Congress, which took place on May 12 and May 13 in rue de la Montagne, Tunis. Successful in their press campaign, the entire group of L'Action Tunisienne was elected unanimously to the executive Destour committee. The happiness did not last: On September 4, following a shooting in Monastir cemetery, Habib Bourguiba led a protest delegation of Monastirians to see Ahmed Bey. The members of the executive committee criticised him for taking this decision on his own, without informing them. Furious, Bourguiba resigned form the committee on September 9., This was the beginning of the split that led to the creation of the Neo Destour on March 2, 1934.

The park is in the Pantanal Biosphere Reserve, which also includes the Pantanal, Chapada dos Guimar√£es, Emas and Serra da Bodoquena national parks, and the Nascentes do Rio Taquari and Pantanal de Rio Negro state parks. The Gomalina, Alegre and Aguape√≠ rivers rise in the park. Highway MT-473 runs to the west of the park, and highway MT-265 runs to the south. There are several archaeological sites from the precolonial and colonial periods. History The Serra de Santa B√°rbara State Park was created by decree 1.797 of 4 November 1997 with an area of about to protect a representative sample of existing ecosystems and to provide an area with opportunities for controlled use by the public. Law 7.165 of 23 August 1999 confirmed the decree. The management plan was approved on 11 December 2008. The consultative council was created on 15 December 2014. Environment The Serra de Santa B√°rbara has one of the most diverse ecosystems in the state, covering an area of transition between the Amazon rainforest, cerrado and pantanal. The forest types include semi-deciduous seasonal forests, the transition from these to cerrado, cerrado proper, and the transition to rocky fields and to pantanal formations. In the pantanal regions there are large seasonal variations, with most of the area flooded in the rainy season. However, most of the vegetation in the park is cerrado. The areas of Amazon rainforest provide islands and shelters for animals during the floods. The fauna is very rich, and included endemic or endangered species such as Linnaeus's two-toed sloth (Choloepus didactylus), southern tamandua (Tamandua tetradactyla), jaguar (Panthera onca), Amazon river dolphin (Inia geoffrensis) and tucuxi (Sotalia fluviatilis). Threats include fires, illegal logging and the advance of agriculture around the park. As of 2005 about 3.7% of the park had been deforested, of which had been deforested before creation in 1997, and had been deforested since then.. In 2010 a scheme was uncovered where fraudulently issued titles for land in the park issued by the Instituto Nacional de Coloniza√ß√£o e Reforma Agr√°ria (Incra) were being sold to farmers, who would then claim compensation.

Through this Institute he has been influenced by its founders, Harry Stack Sullivan, Erich Fromm, Frieda Fromm-Reichmann and Clara Thompson. Since 2011 he is the Editor of The Psychoanalytic Quarterly. From 1994 to 2001 he served as Editor of Contemporary Psychoanalysis and from 2007 to 2010 as Editor for North America of The International Journal of Psychoanalysis. Contribution to psychoanalysis Greenberg, along with Stephen Mitchell, was one of the main originators of relational psychoanalysis, a new development in psychoanalysis which is in part a further development of interpersonal psychoanalysis and object relations theory. The influence remains through their book Object Relations in Psychoanalytic Theory and a key article in Contemporary Psychoanalysis. A complete issue of Contemporary Psychoanalysis was devoted to the much-quoted Object Relations in Psychoanalytic Theory in 2013, the 30th anniversary of its publication. In his second book, Oedipus and Beyond, Greenberg further develops his deep and careful interpretation of the history of psychoanalytic thinking, and its implications for clinical practice. In more than 70 articles and book chapters, Greenberg has made a number of contributions to comparative psychoanalysis, to the history of psychoanalytic ideas, and to moving forward the theory of therapeutic action and of ways of understanding the nature of psychological conflict. Several interviews have been devoted over the years to Greenberg and his influence on psychoanalytic theory and clinical practice. Greenberg has a long-standing interest in Greek tragedy, which has a noticeable influence on his thinking about psychoanalysis. Awards and prizes Greenberg is the 2015 recipient of the Mary S. Sigourney Award for Outstanding Achievement in Psychoanalysis. He also received the Distinguished Scientific Award of the Division of Psychoanalysis, American Psychological Association, in 1993; and the Edith Seltzer Alt Distinguished Service Award from the William Alanson White Institute in 2004.

He was proclaimed blessed by the Catholic Church in 1906.  Biography  He was born in Riudoms, Catalonia, on 24 November 1620 in a modest house in the street known as a Pocket Street (Carrer de la Butxaca in Catalan) and now has his name. After marrying at the age of 18 as his father wished, he was widowed in a few months. He entered the Franciscan convent of Sant Miquel d'Escornalbou and made religious profession on 14 July 1641, changing his name to Bonaventura. In the following years, he was sent to Mora d'Ebre , Figueres, la Bisbal d'Empord√† and Terrassa, where another street has been named for him. In 1658 he was sent to Rome where he founded Santo Retiro are four monasteries in the province of Rome, including San Bonaventura al Palatino. He was an adviser to four popes: Alexander VII, Clement IX, Clement X and Innocent XI. In Rome in 1662 he founded the Riformella, a reform movement within the Reformed Order of Friars Minor of the Strict Observance, so the monks and Franciscan priests who dedicated themselves to the apostolate could gather in meditation and spiritual retreat, living the founding spirit of the Franciscan order. In 1679, he sent from Rome the relics of Saint Boniface, Saint Julian and Saint Vincent. Since then, the second Sunday of May is celebrated in Riudoms as the Feast of the Holy Relics. He died in Rome on 11 September 1684.  Veneration  In 1775 he was declared venerable and in 1906 he was beatified by the Pope Pius X, after the verification of two miraculous healings. The first one in 1790 when a woman was in a serious condition after falling from the horse and was inexplicably cured after have invoked him. The other, in 1818 in which another woman remained unconscious for three days after childbirth and cured instantaneously after applying him a relic of Bonaventura. In Riudoms, his remains are preserved since 1972, when they were moved from Rome. They are currently in the tabernacle chapel in the church of Saint James the Apostle. In Riudoms there is a great devotion to Blessed Bonaventura and a feast in his honour is celebrated every 24 November, where his remains are taken in procession through the village.

It consists of the analysis of problems arising from the aggregation of preferences of a group of agents from a computational perspective. In particular, computational social choice is concerned with the efficient computation of outcomes of voting rules, with the computational complexity of various forms of manipulation, and issues arising from the problem of representing and eliciting preferences in combinatorial settings.  Winner determination  The usefulness of a particular voting system can be severely limited if it takes a very long time to calculate the winner of an election. Therefore, it is important to design fast algorithms that can evaluate a voting rule when given ballots as input. As is common in computational complexity theory, an algorithm is thought to be efficient if it takes polynomial time. Many popular voting rules can be evaluated in polynomial time in a straightforward way (i.e., counting), such as the Borda count, approval voting, or the plurality rule. For rules such as the Schulze method or ranked pairs, more sophisticated algorithms can be used to show polynomial runtime. Certain voting systems, however, are computationally difficult to evaluate. In particular, winner determination for the Kemeny-Young method, Dodgson's method, and Young's method are all NP-hard problems. This has led to the development of approximation algorithms and fixed-parameter tractable algorithms to improve the theoretical calculation of such problems.  Hardness of manipulation  By the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem, all non- trivial voting rules can be manipulated in the sense that voters can sometimes achieve a better outcome by misrepresenting their preferences, that is, they submit a non-truthful ballot to the voting system. Social choice theorists have long considered ways to circumvent this issue, such as the proposition by Bartholdi, Tovey, and Trick in 1989 based on computational complexity theory. They considered the second-order Copeland rule (which can be evaluated in polynomial time), and proved that it is NP-complete for a voter to decide, given knowledge of how everyone else has voted, whether it is possible to manipulate in such a way as to make some favored candidate the winner. The same property holds for single transferable vote. Hence, assuming the widely believed hypothesis that P ‚â† NP, there are instances where polynomial time is not enough to establish whether a beneficial manipulation is possible. Because of this, the voting rules that come with an NP-hard manipulation problem are \\"resistant\\" to manipulation. One should note that these results only concern the worst-case: it might well be possible that a manipulation problem is usually easy to solve, and only requires superpolynomial time on very unusual inputs.  Other topics  =Tournament solutions= A tournament solution is a rule that assigns to every tournament a set of winners. Since a preference profile induces a tournament through its majority relation, every tournament solution can also be seen as a voting rule which only uses information about the outcomes of pairwise majority contests. Many tournament solutions have been proposed, and computational social choice theorists have studied the complexity of the associated winner determination problems. =Preference restrictions= Restricted preference domains, such as single-peaked or single-crossing preferences, are an important area of study in social choice theory, since preferences from these domains avoid the Condorcet paradox and thus can circumvent impossibility results like Arrow's theorem and the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem. From a computational perspective, such domain restrictions are useful to speed up winner determination problems, both computationally hard single-winner and multi-winner rules can be computed in polynomial time when preferences are structured appropriately. On the other hand, manipulation problem also tend to be easy on these domains, so complexity shields against manipulation are less effective. Another computational problem associated with preference restrictions is that of recognizing when a given preference profile belongs to some restricted domain. This task is polynomial time solvable in many cases, including for single- peaked and single-crossing preferences, but can be hard for more general classes. =Multiwinner elections= While most traditional voting rules focus on selecting a single winner, many situations require selecting multiple winners. This is the case when a fixed-size parliament or a committee is to be elected, though multiwinner voting rules can also be used to select a set of recommendations or facilities or a shared bundle of items. Work in computational social choice has focused on defining such voting rules, understanding their properties, and studying the complexity of the associated winner determination problems.

Erlewine has performed solo, as a duet with Max Lockwood, with the May Erlewine band, with May Erlewine and the Motivations, with the Sweet Water Warblers, and with other bands. Work May Erlewine was born to a musical family; her father Michael Erlewine was a member of the Michigan blues band The Prime Movers and her uncle is a luthier. Her work shows a variety of musical influences, such as folk, bluegrass, blues, rock & roll and others. It has grown from her experience as a child, home-schooled and surrounded by music, and as a teenager, when she hitch-hiked across North America, riding freight trains and performing on the streets. Erlewine has described how her songs are the expression of her experiences. She spends much of each year writing songs and performing in Northern Michigan. In their 2007 album Big Old Life, the New England band Rani Arbo and Daisy Mayhem covered one of her songs, \\"Shine On\\". The movie Old Fashioned, released in 2014, included her performance of \\"Joy\\", along with the author, Ralston Bowles, in the original soundtrack. In 2015, \\"Shine On\\" was selected and performed by singer Sawyer Fredericks in the final round of NBC's TV show The Voice, which he won. Coincidentally, Joshua Davis, a singer-songwriter who is part of May's music collective, Earthwork Music, was also a finalist on The Voice that year; he went all the way to the final round. Erlewine is featured in the Rise Again song book released in 2016, a sequel to the popular folk music fake book Rise Up Singing, containing chords, lyrics, and sources. The two original May Erlewine songs included in the second edition are: Rise Up Singing, from her 2007 album Mother Moon, and Shine On, from the 2005 Seth & May album, jointly released with her then husband, Seth Bernard. In late 2018, Erlewine played a series of collaborative shows with fellow singer-songwriters Sav Buist and Katie Larson (both from The Accidentals) and Beth Nielsen Chapman.

History Tahiti Village was announced by Consolidated Resorts Inc. on March 7, 2003, as a $200 million 580-unit timeshare resort to be developed on of land at the southeast corner of South Las Vegas Boulevard and Arby Avenue. Sales were expected to begin in July or August 2003, with groundbreaking expected to take place in September 2003. Consolidated Resorts, which owned timeshares in Las Vegas and in Hawaii, planned to construct the resort in three or four phases, with the first phase scheduled for an August 2004 completion. The resort's buildings would range between two and eight stories. No casino was planned for inclusion on the property. The resort's appearance was to be similar to the Tahiti, another one of the company's timeshare projects in Las Vegas. By July 2004, the project was expected to feature a total of 975 units. The $60 million first phase was topped off in September 2005, with the first three buildings standing five and six stories high and offering 154 two-bedroom units, with the potential to split them into 308 one-bedroom units. The six-story towers were scheduled for completion in March 2006. Additional towers, as high as 11 stories, were planned for the back portion of the 27-acre property. The timeshare was ultimately expected to feature 1,046 rooms, generating sales of more than $1.5 billion. Amenities included a pool and beach, as well as a lounge, concierge, and spa. Michael Kaplan, chairman of Consolidated Resorts, said at the time, \\"We assembled 27 acres in the last three years and we had offers of two and three times what we paid for the land before we even started construction. I can't believe the value of the land out there. You look at that location, it's as close to the Strip as you can get.\\" Tahiti Village's second phase began construction in September 2006, with a 10-story 284-unit tower. At that time, the resort was expected to ultimately feature 1,083 units. The second phase, consisting of three 10-story towers, was topped off in July 2007. The second phase also included a seven-story parking garage. In 2007, Alan Thicke and Tanya Roberts appeared in a Tahiti Village infomercial titled Second Honeymoon, produced in the style of a game show featuring timeshare purchasers. Thicke also appeared in a 2007 television commercial for the resort. A Polynesian-themed restaurant, Tahiti Joe's, operated on the second floor of the resort. In July 2009, Consolidated Resorts filed for bankruptcy. Operations at Tahiti Village continued despite the filing. In August 2010, Arthur Spector Companies acquired the remaining timeshare inventory and operating assets of Tahiti Village. In June 2014, Tahiti Village opened 17¬∞ South, a tropical-themed restaurant and bar, named after the Polynesian islands located 17 degrees south of the equator. In August 2014, the restaurant was opened to the public; restaurants at the resort were previously for guests only. In November 2014, the new Mahana Spa opened on the ninth floor of Tower Five.

As the twentieth century progressed she also became increasingly prominent as a Feminist and Lesbian activist. Throughout her life Radusch kept a diary. Accessed by researchers after she died, her own writings have provided an insightful, and at times engagingly laconic, commentary on her eventful life. Life Hilde Radusch was born in Altdamm, directly across the river from Stettin, but the family relocated while she was still young to Weimar in central southern Germany. Her father was a postal worker who in 1915 was killed in the war, but by that time he had instilled in his daughter a spirit of independence and determination which made for a sometimes difficult relationship with her widowed mother during her teenage years. When she was 18 Radusch left home and headed for Berlin where she gained a training place at the Pestalozzi-Fr√∂bel Training Institute. She emerged in 1922 with a qualification in infant care and education. 1922 was also the year in which she joined the Young Communists. By 1924, together with Hedwig Remmele, she was taking a lead in the recently founded Berlin \\"Red Women's and Girls' Association\\" (\\"Roten Frauen- und M√§dchenbunde\\"), also writing articles for the movement's newspaper, \\"Die Frauenwacht\\" (\\"Women Watch\\"). However, finding no employment opportunities for communists in infant care, in 1923 she took a job as a telephone switchboard operator with the post office. It was while working for the post office that Radusch met Maria, described in one source as \\"her first girl friend\\", and at some point the two of them moved in together. Radusch continued working for the post office till 1930. In 1924 she had joined the Communist Party itself, and from 1929 till 1932 Radusch served as a Communist Party city councillor in Berlin. In 1932 she was no longer listed as a communist candidate for the city council elections, due to the scandalising impact of her disinclination to conceal her lesbian private life. In 1931 Radusch joined the Communist party's alternative \\"special\\" postal workers' trades union. The copies of her reports imply a belief in Moscow that she could possess expertise that would be helpful to the development of a Soviet postal service. In September 1932 she traveled to the Soviet Union as part of a delegation from the German communist party, \\"visiting the Soviet postal operation\\". Along with Moscow, the visit, which lasted several months, took in Leningrad and Odessa. In January 1933 the political backdrop was transformed when the Nazi Party took power and converted Germany into a one-party dictatorship. Political activity - except in support of the Nazi Party - became illegal. At the end of February 1933 the Reichstag fire was instantly blamed on the Communists, and in March 1933 those identified as Communists began to be arrested. At the end of March 1933 Radusch moved out of the home she was sharing with her partner Maria in order to protect the latter's position. Maria was still working for the post office which made her a \\"public servant\\": they thought her employment would be imperilled if she was living in sin with a former communist city councillor. Radusch was home from the Soviet Union by March 1933, and at 6 in the morning on 6 April 1933 the authorities turned up and arrested her in connection with her Communist Party and other \\"resistance\\" activities. She was invited to sign an inaccurate record of her initial interrogation which would have amounted to a confession of guilt: when she refused to sign she was informed by her Gestapo interrogators that she would therefore be taken into \\"protective custody\\" (\\"Schutzhaft\\"). She was taken, in the first instance, to the police station in Alexanderplatz where she was one of 36 women placed in a room. Two of the detainees at once announced that they were masseuses and started to massage one another but were quickly separated. After a month she ended up in the Barnim Street women's prison, along with around two hundred other \\"politicals\\". Unlike those identified as \\"criminals\\", the \\"politicals\\" were not held in solitary confinement. An affair with a cellmate made the detention easier to endure, although being allocated a thin-walled cell positioned next to the warders' sitting room was in some respects inhibiting. At the end of September 1933 she was released with a number of the other detainees identified as \\"politicals\\", and moved to central Berlin where she was placed under Gestapo surveillance. Her political history made it hard to find work, but in the end she found a job with Siemens, where she was able to pursue her \\"illegal party work\\" inside the company. In 1939 she met Else \\"Eddy\\" Klopsch who subsequently became her life partner. One of Eddy's many achievements was winning the confidence of Radusch's mother, who approved of her daughter \\"settling down\\". From 1941 Hilde and Eddy ran a little restaurant. Initially their application for a restaurant license was refused under pressure from the local SS (The Nazi party's quasi-military wing), who deemed Radusch \\"politically unreliable\\", but eventually they found premises and established a \\"shop\\", registered in the name of Mr Klopsch (Eddy's father). The business was located in Berlin's Scheunen quarter and contained much furniture suitable for the restaurant, which had been left behind by the previous occupants. Like many premises in the Scheunen quarter, their shop had previously been owned by Jews, who had now relocated. They never did obtain official permission to run the shop as a restaurant. However, all shops in the neighbourhood were required to display a \\"Forbidden to Jews\\" (\\"F√ºr Juden verboten!\\") sign in the window, and in Mr Klopsch's shop window, in front of this sign, was placed, without further explanation, a restaurant menu. The restaurant later became a refuge for \\"illegals\\" when the underground Communist Party leadership resumed contact with Radusch and started sending her women released from detention to be hidden and looked after. Radusch and Klopsch did not always succeed in these difficult tasks: they were unable to save Henny Lemberg, a Jewish Communist entrusted to their care and whom they befriended, from being deported to an extermination camp. The attempt to assassinate Hitler on 20 July 1944 failed in its primary objective, but it did greatly unsettle the Nazi leadership. Some years earlier the Nazis had compiled a list of communist and socialist politicians and activists from the Weimar years who might be rounded up in the event of a deterioration in the domestic political situation. By 1944 the list was somewhat out of date, many of those named on it having already been murdered or died from natural causes, but Hilde Radusch, whose name was also on the list, was very much alive and, by this stage, working in a bank. The mass roundup of political opponents was nevertheless implemented overnight on 22/23 August 1944. Fortunately Eddy Klopsch had a friend in the police service who warned the women of the government's intentions, and they were able to escape in time to avoid capture. They spent the rest of the war years hiding in a large allotment shed in Prieros, a hamlet set in marshy countryside between Berlin and Cottbus, that was for most purposes far from the beaten track, and where they had purchased a piece of land when first they got together, back in 1940. They had already used it, in 1943, to hide Erna Hackbarth, the partner of , after she had managed to escape from a concentration camp. However, now they had to survive in it themselves, without any ration coupons. There were occasions when Radusch managed to exchange a bed sheet for meat. They were sometimes able to find wood for heating themselves in the woods, and they learned to concoct a tobacco substitute from blackberries. Nevertheless, by the time Berlin was destructively liberated by the Red army in April/May 1945 they were starving. The end of the war found the entire central portion of what had been Germany administered as the Soviet occupation zone. Radusch threw herself into the vast reconstruction effort that now began. Between June 1945 and February 1946 she was employed in the district \\"Victims of Fascism\\" department for the district government of Sch√∂neberg, processing claims for emergency food and clothing. In 1946 she was a co-instigator of a \\"child rescue\\" (\\"Rettet die Kinder\\") project. At the same time, seeing Soviet communism arriving in Germany with the Red army, she now began to nurture doubts about the Communist Party which had been the focus of her politics for more than twenty years. She took a decision to resign from it and made her intention known. In January 1946 the local party leadership anticipated her resignation, however, and expelled her, using her lesbian relationship to justify the move. She was also bombarded with threatening letters, and denounced her to her employers at the town hall. When she went to see her boss to clarify matters, she found a thick personnel file, containing statements from three leading communists, denouncing her as a lesbian, for which reason she should no longer be employed in a public office. The comrades had their way, and in February 1946 she lost her job. Wartime deprivation had also taken its toll, and by now she was suffering from Rheumatoid arthritis. A few years later she was forced to take early retirement, supported by a very meagre pension. In 1948 she joined the by now, within the Soviet occupation zone, badly emaciated Social Democratic Party (SDP). Her partner Eddy, six years younger than she, had been physically handicapped since before they met, her condition sufficient to justify a (very small) disability pension. Eddy now bought a Bric-√†-brac shop. Despite the poor health from which they both suffered, the shop supported the two of them till 1960 when Eddy died of cancer. Bereavement hit Hilde Radusch hard. The 1970s brought a new wave of feminism, and Radusch joined in. She co-founded L74, a Berlin group of older lesbians. She became an editor on \\"Our Little Newspaper\\" (\\"Unserer Kleinen Zeitung\\" /UKZ), described by one source as the first lesbian newspaper after the Second World War. A few years later she was also a co-founder of the \\"Women's Research, Education and Information Centre\\" (\\"Frauenforschungs-, -bildungs- und -informationszentrum\\" / FFBIZ). It was not till eighteen years after her death that the authorities in Berlin-Sch√∂neberg officially commemorated this extraordinary politician. In 2012 a memorial was set up at the corner of Eisenacher Stra√üe (Eisenach Street) and Winterfeldtstra√üe (Winterfeld Street), consisting of three tablets dedicated to her. It is the first public memorial in Berlin commemorating a lesbian victim of Nazi persecution.

J., and Curtin, Sean, Chicago Boxing (2005) Arcadia Publishing Company, Charleston, Chicago, Portsmouth, and San Francisco, pg.18 He began his professional boxing career around 1895 in the Chicago area where he won six of his first seven fights by knockout. In his early career from 1895 to 1896, he knocked out Young Casey in 3 rounds, Jimmy \\"Spider\\" Kelly in 1, Kid Reynolds in 2, the well known Eddie Curry in 4, Jim Gilchrist in 6, and Jack Smith in 1. In his first sixteen fights between March 22, 1895 and June 1, 1897, he lost only once to the well known fellow Chicago featherweight Tommy White by knockout at the Midway Theater in Lamont, Illinois in August 1896. White would become one of his better known opponents. =Fighting boxing champions, Solly Smith, George Dixon, and Billy Murphy= He fought three boxers who would hold world championships and an impressive contender in 1898; Solly Smith to a six-round draw in Chicago, George Dixon in a twenty-round loss in New York's Lenox Club, Jewish New York featherweight contender Joe Bernstein in a twenty-round loss on points in New York's Lenox Club and Australian featherweight champion Torpedo Billy Murphy in an impressive fourth-round knockout win in St. Louis, Missouri. Not surprisingly, Dixon was the favorite in the early betting for his June 6 bout.\\"Dixon and Santry\\", The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, Brooklyn, New York, pg. 5, 6 June 1898 Taking the World Featherweight Championship Prior to his taking the World Featherweight Title, he fought two more important bouts with the great Black Canadian featherweight George Dixon, losing the first on July 14, 1899 at the Star Theatre in Chicago in a sixth round points decision. On August 11, 1899, he fought a twenty-round draw with Dixon at the Broadway Athletic Club in New York City. On October 10, 1899, Santry overtook the world title defeating Ben Jordan at the Lenox Club in New York in a sixteenth of twenty-round knockout. He knocked out Jordan with a \\"clean right hand swing to the jaw.\\" Santry achieved the knockout in a little less than two minutes into the sixteenth round.\\"Jordan's Colors Lowered\\", San Francisco Call, San Francisco, California, pg. 1, 11 October 1899 Until the knockout, Jordan had been outpointing Santry, though he suffered a knockdown in the first round. Apparently, Jordan had tired somewhat by the sixteenth round compared to his opponent.\\"Ben Jordan Knocked Out\\", The Morning Post, Raleigh, North Carolina, pg. 1, 11 October 1899 One source wrote that \\"until the knockout Jordan was far ahead on points but Santry's blows were truer to the mark and won him the battle.\\" Santry had a slight advantage in height, though Jordan was a 2 to 1 favorite in the betting.\\"Santry a Surprise\\", The Scranton Republican, Scranton, Pennsylvania, pg. 1, 11 October 1899 After the bout, in an interview, Santry complained of losing a few teeth, and having badly banged up his hands from his bout with the English champion. He claimed that Jordan so frequently changed his style of boxing, it was difficult to predict his movements.\\"Sign for a Scrap\\", Rock Island Argus, Rock Island, Illinois, pg. 7, 14 October 1899 Losing the World Featherweight Championship to Terry McGovern Terry McGovern Santry claimed the World Featherweight Championship after his knockout of Ben Jordan, but his title was not universally recognized at the time. It is today by the World Boxing Organization. He lost his title on February 1, 1900 to the great Terry McGovern in a fifth-round technical knockout at Tattersall's in Chicago. An exceptionally large crowd of 15,000 watched the bout.\\"M'Govern Victor\\", The Arkansas Gazette, Little Rock, Arkansas, pg. 5, 2 February 1900 One source noted \\"the knockout came in the fifth round after a fierce mixup in which Santry did some clever work but Terry was too strong for the Chicago lad and straightening Santry up with a short arm jolt to the stomach, landed a left and right to the jaw in quick succession...Santry fell to the floor on his face. Santry rose at the count of ten but referee Siler called the bout to prevent him from any further punishment.\\" Santry was down for the count in the second but arose and may have had an advantage in the long range fighting as he had a two-inch advantage in height.\\"M'Govern Winner\\", The Pantagraph, Bloomington, Illinois, pg. 1, 2 February 1900 Sam Pooler acted as Santry's manager for the bouts.\\"Eddie Santry is Confident\\", The InterOcean, Chicago, Illinois, pg. 8, 23 January 1900 Once McGovern defeated Santry, he reunited the Featherweight Title, and gained recognition in both the British empire, and the United States as a World Champion. =Two bouts with Oscar Gardner after loss of the title= He followed his loss of the title with two important battles against World Featherweight contender Oscar Gardner, losing in a fifth-round knockout at the Music Hall in Louisville, Kentucky on May 3, 1900, and then winning in a twenty-round newspaper decision at Convention Hall in Kansas City, Missouri, on July 6. The battle in Louisville was ended two minutes and thirty seconds into the fifth round, when Gardner put Santry away with a \\"short arm straight left to the pit of the stomach\\", that landed Santry on the canvas. Santry was thought to have had a lead in points when the blow was delivered.\\"Was a Wicked Punch\\", Democrat and Chronicle, Rochester, New York, pg. 19, 6 May 1900 One source described the blow to Santry as landing on his Solar Plexus, and occurring shortly after Gardner pushed Santry away from a tight clinch. Santry dropped to the canvas in pain. He had a slight height advantage, and may have been ahead on points landing often through the first four rounds. However, he lacked the energy of Gardner by the fifth round when the knockout occurred.\\"Eddie Santry Knocked Out\\", Davenport Daily Republican, Davenport, Iowa, pg. 2, 4 May 1900 Santry's July 6 win over Oscar Gardner in Kansas City was described as \\"fast and furious\\", though Gardner was not in the best condition appearing with yellow skin and suffering from a common boxer's ailment, bruised hands. Santry had an advantage in height and though he tired in round twelve, he had more energy by the twentieth, when the bout ended with a referee decision in his favor. The July battle which drew a crowd of 5000 in Kansas City took place shortly after all the delegates had left from the Democratic National Convention which had been held there that week.\\"To Santry\\", The Pittsburgh Daily Headlight, Pittsburgh, Kansas, pg. 8, 7 July 1900 Marriage to Helen Marr On July 23, 1900, Santry married Miss Helen Marr of Chicago at the Hotel Majestic in Hammond, Indiana.\\"Santry Married\\", El Paso Herald, El Paso, Texas, pg. 1, 24 July 1900 Eddie's brother William attended the groom. The ceremony, performed by a Judge Stinson, was kept small to avoid public scrutiny, and not long after the ceremony, the couple returned to their hometown Chicago.\\"Eddie Santry Married\\", The Daily Review, Decatur, Illinois, pg. 8, 24 July 1900 Injury to knee and subsequent bouts including Young Corbett II and Battling Nelson Around November 8, 1900, Santry's knee was badly injured while sparring with Californian and Middleweight Champion Tommy Ryan who had several bouts in Chicago that month. While attempting a side step to avoid a left from Ryan, his ankle turned and the full weight of his body was thrown on his knee joint in a twisting fashion. At the time, the injury was considered to be serious and he briefly took up working in a Saloon. He resumed his training by early January but lost to Jack McClelland, in a four-round knockout on January 29, 1901. He would face McClelland again a year later on February 19, 1902 in a six-round draw in Chicago.\\"Eddie Santry Able to Resume Training,\\", The Rock Island Argus, Rock Island, Illinois, pg. 7, 8 January 1901 Santry lost again to the great Young Corbett II in a second- round knockout in Denver, Colorado, on April 12, 1901. He would act as a sparring partner to Corbett by the Spring of 1902.Acted as Corbett's sparring partner in \\"Eddie Santry\\", The Butte inter mountain, Butte, Montana, pg. 8, 18 April 1902\\"Santry is Done For\\", The Rock Island Argus, Rock Island, Illinois, pg. 5, 8 November 1900 Strongly affected by his losses to McClelland and particularly Young Corbett, he took a seven-month rest from boxing before his next bout. His record after the injury showed fewer wins by knockout, and his opponents may have been a shade less skilled. On November 29, 1901, he fought future champion Battling Nelson at the Pyramid Athletic Club in Chicago, winning in a six-round points decision. At various times in his career, he would spar, train, and act as a cornerman for Nelson, a fellow Chicagoan and 1908 lightweight champion. On December 27, 1901, he won on a second round disqualification against Ole Olsen in Omaha, Nebraska. Santry slipped to the floor from a blow, and Olsen struck him before he had time to rise to his knees. Olsen later apologized for the infraction.\\"Sporting News in General\\", Oshkosh Daily Northwestern, Oshkosh, Wisconsin, pg. 3, 28 December 1901 Late career He fought Tommy Sullivan three times in April and May 1902, with a win by disqualification, and a no contest in Chicago, followed by a loss in a third knockout in St. Louis, Missouri. He had two wins against Maurice Sayers at the end of 1903 and early 1904. In the Tommy Sullivan bout on April 18, 1902, the referee determined that Santry had been kneed in the groin by Sullivan, and ended the bout as a No Contest after a minute and a half of boxing in the third round. Santry had to be carried from the ring.\\"What the Sports are Doing\\", The Butte Inter mountain, Butte, Montana, pg. 8, 18 April 1902 On March 18, 1903, he fought Adam Ryan to a ten-round draw in Indianapolis. On December 3, of the previous year he had fought Ryan to a six- round draw at the Rosemont Athletic Club in Chicago.\\"Santry and Ryan Draw\\", The Butte Inter mountain, Butte, Montana, pg. 8, 19 March 1903 Ryan was a lightweight from Philadelphia who would meet several contenders in his career and would face welterweight champion Harry Lewis three years later. On October 29, 1903, he fought Aurelio Herrera in Anaconcda, Montana, losing in a thirteenth-round knockout. Santry later claimed he had led significantly in points throughout the bout and had been the victim of a knockout punch by Herrera while he was distracted.Santry was distracted in \\"Eddie Santry Dead\\", The North Adams Transcript, North Adams, Massachusetts, pg. 9, 6 February 1919 He had continued to train, running as much as five miles according to one source, and hitting the bag, even during this period of gradual decline in his boxing career. Herrera, who was a promising young boxer, had hurt his hands prior to the bout but had fought slightly fewer gifted opponents and taken subsequently less punishment. Both he and Santry were around twenty-seven, with Santry having only a slight advantage in reach.\\"Herrera-Santry Betting is Begun\\", The Butte Inter mountain, Butte, Montana, pg. 7, 26 October 1903 =Briefly held in jail= He fought Jack Cordell in San Francisco California on November 29, 1904, and lost in a ten-round points decision, which was unpopular with much of the crowd. Though he showed some of his old defensive skills, he lacked the punch he had shown in his earlier career. Many fans would have preferred a draw ruling for the bout.\\"Jack Cordell Beats Santry\\", The San Francisco Call, San Francisco, California, pg. 7, 30 November 1904Unpopular with the crowd in \\"Seconds of Fighters\\", The Anaconda Standard, Anaconda, Montana, pg. 2, 30 November 1904 After the bout with Cordell, he was arrested on a complaint by Battling Nelson, with whom he had sparred for several weeks, acting as a trainer. Nelson believed he had been defrauded out of receipts for his fights against Young Corbett and Jimmy Britt in San Francisco by Santry who had already left for the East coast with Nelson's manager Ted Murphy. The complaint applied to Murphey as well who had received $9000 from Nelson's San Francisco bouts. Santry was released on his own recognizance on Christmas Day, 1904 after claiming his innocence, and Murphy was released on bail claiming he had fully intended to compensate Nelson for the money owned him. Nelson did not choose to press charges.Released on Christmas Day in The San Francisco Call, San Francisco, California, page 31, 25 December 1904 He was back to boxing with a knockout of Jack Parry in eleven rounds in Boston, the following April 10, 1905.\\"Thinks Himself Defrauded\\", The Roswell Daily Record, Roswell, New Mexico, pg.1, 23 December 1904 =Boxing from 1905‚Äì11= Fighting boxers of less than championship contender quality, he had a five match winning streak from Spring to October 1905. On November 17, 1905, he fought Jack Dougherty, winning in six rounds in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. It was reported that he found Dougherty an easy opponent.\\"Eddie Santry Wins\\", Butte inter mountain, Butte, Montana, pg. 8, 17 October 1903 Showing some of his old form, he knocked out Tommy Lynch on December 10, 1907 in Duluth, Minnesota, in four rounds, though Lynch was not a boxer who fought championship contenders. On July 3, 1908, he fought Eddie Marino at The Rink in Sandpoint, Idaho to a twenty-round draw. The bout was a \\"smoker\\" for the Sandpoint Idaho Athletic Club and certainly drew a far smaller crowd than the ones he had drawn ten years earlier.\\"Glovefest at Sandpoint\\", The Spokane Press, Spokane, Washington, pg. 3, 2 July 1908 He fought less frequently for the next seven years, until his last bout with Jack Ryan on May 12, 1911, which he won in a fourth-round knockout in South Bend, Indiana. Acting as a referee He worked during this period and later refereeing fights in several locations, including Gary, Hammond, and Fort Wayne Indiana, as well as Davenport, Iowa.He refereed fights in \\"Eddie Santry Dies Today\\", The Lake County Times, Hammond, Indiana, pg. 1, 28 January 1919He refereed in Iowa in \\"Bout at Davenport\\", The Daily Gate City, Keokuk, Iowa, pg. 6, 21 August 1911He refereed in Fort Wayne in \\"Boxing\\", Garrett Clipper, Garrett, Indiana, pg.3, 21 March 1912 Political career He retired from competitive prize fighting around 1911, but stayed active in the sport as a referee, and may have continued to act as a trainer or cornerman for boxers at times. On November 8, 1914, he was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives from District 3 in Chicago, as a Democrat, at the age of 38,'Illinois Blue Book 1915-1916,' Biographical Sketch of Edward M.

He was appointed by Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker to fill the unexpired term of Justice David Prosser. Before he was appointed by Walker, Kelly was a conservative attorney who defended Walker's legislation, including a 2011 redistricting plan that was struck down by the lower federal courts. The lower federal courts' decisions were reversed on appeal. Early life and education Born in Santa Barbara, California, Kelly graduated from Carroll University and, in 1991, from the evangelical Christian Regent University School of Law, where he was founding editor-in-chief of the law review. During Kelly's time at Regent, the law school was dominated by adherents of Dominion theology.  Career  Kelly is a commercial litigator and founding partner of Rogahn Kelly LLC. Before starting the firm, Kelly was a shareholder at Reinhart Boerner Van Deuren, s.c. in Milwaukee. Kelly is a member of The Federalist Society, the Wisconsin State Advisory Committee to the United States Commission on Civil Rights, and the President's Council of Carroll University. He has appeared before the U.S. Supreme Court, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, and Wisconsin Supreme Court.

Justice Kelly ran for a full term on the court when it came up for election in 2020, but was defeated by Wisconsin Circuit Court judge Jill Karofsky. Justice Kelly's term in office ended July 31, 2020.

In 2014, Kelly wrote that slavery and affirmative action were, under the law, morally the same.

In the past it was also named Cascata delle Cheucie. With other secondary drops it forms the cascate del Serpente complex.  Geography  The waterfalls are located in the rugged and step valley of torrente Masone, a left-hand tributary of the Stura di Ovada. The waterfall is not formed by a discontinuity in the stream bedrock, but by a diverse grade of breaking of the same type of rock, the greenschists prevailing in the small valley. This different grade of fracturation produced the step from which the water jumps in the underlying lake, leaping over a less fractured (and thus less erodible) rock layer. The site is considered one sito di interesse geomorfolgico (site of geomorphological interest) of the Parco naturale regionale del Beigua. The Park administration created close to the waterfalls a Percorso botanico (botanical itinerary) in co-operation with a local secondary school. In summer the small lake underlying the main drop is a popular bathing place.  History  In the past the waterfall was named Cascata delle Cheucie, ad only the small lake was referred as del Serpente (of the snake). The abundant waters of torrente Masone were used for many purposes and is still possible to recognize ruins of a big mill located near the junction of torrente Masone and the Stura. Closer to the waterfalls are located remains of Cartiera Savoi, an ancient paper mill moved by freshwater.  Hiking and canyoning  Waterfall and lake The waterfalls can be easily reached from Masone centre by car or with a 30 minutes walk.

Arnout, like his grandfather, was the commander of a fleet that delivered Crusaders to fight in the war against the Muslim intruders. He was one of the many captains leading an armada that left Dartmouth in May 1147 to free Lisbon from the Moors in what is known as the siege of Lisbon. Phillips describes Arnulf as a count and the leader of the Rhinelanders in this mission. He is also identified as a nephew of Godfrey of Bouillon with distant ties to the ruling house of Jerusalem. The claim of a familial relationship with Godfrey is dubious. The battle for Lisbon was one of the few successes of the Second Crusade and is viewed as one of the pivotal battles in the Reconquista. The attacking fleet included as many as 200 ships, and the corresponding rout of the Moors has been described by Runiciman as a ‚Äúglorious massacre of the infidel.‚Äù Many of the Crusaders continued on to the Holy Land. Arnout was married, although his wife‚Äôs name is not known. They had one son, Godfried III, who succeeded him as Count of Aarschot, the last of this comital title until the creation of the Lords and Dukes of Aarschot in the 13th century.

In this part of Chile, it is the highest volcano. Its name means \\"black moon\\". It is a volcano in the Central Volcanic Zone of the Andes, a zone of strong volcanic activity during the last million years. Old volcanoes in the area are well- preserved, due to the dry climate. Acamarachi itself is a cone-shaped volcano with steep upper flanks and a lava dome on its northern side. While there is no indication of historical activity and the flank lava flows are old, some lava flows around the summit crater and a lava coulee north of Acamarachi on the saddle between Acamarachi and Colachi volcano may be postglacial in age. Acamarachi is formed by andesitic and dacitic rocks. Acamarachi features an Inca mountain sanctuary on which several figurines have been found. One female figurine is made out of silver, a male one is made out of thorny oyster. Both of these figurines were found with miniature clothing.  Geological context  The volcano is located in the Central Volcanic Zone, an area of volcanism in the Andes. Volcanism in this area is dependent on the subduction in the Peru-Chile Trench. 27 million years ago, in this area of the Andes large rhyolitic eruptions commenced and formed major ignimbrites, dramatically increasing 10 million years ago. At the same time starting in the Miocene, andesitic to dacitic eruptive activity has formed large stratovolcanoes. This activity in the late Pleistocene and Holocene has created the current volcanic arc. The climate of the area is hyperarid. Thus, ignimbrites and individual volcanoes keep most of their original appearance. Most of these volcanoes are remote structures that are unlikely to affect significant population, although wind-driven transport of tephra can potentially cause economic and other damage at considerable distance.  Geology  Acamarachi is a steep-sided conical volcano, like several other volcanoes in the region. Such a shape is due to the relatively high viscosity of the lavas forming them. In the case of Acamarachi, the upper slopes reach a slope angle of 45¬∞. On the volcano's northern flank there is a large lava dome while the rest of the edifice is symmetrical. Acamarachi is constructed by andesite and dacite. Rocks are porphyritic and contain hornblende as well as biotite or pyroxene. Augite, hypersthene and plagioclase are also present, with smaller contents of olivine and quartz. A study of lava flows at the summit concluded that Acamarachi's last eruption may have occurred during the Holocene. There are no young lava flows on the flanks and the summit crater is degraded. Possibly after the ice ages, north of Acamarachi a silicic coulee was erupted on the saddle between Acamarachi and Colachi. This coulee has well preserved flow structures and covers . No evidence exists for activity in historical times. The volcano is part of a northwest-bound alignment along with Rili, Colachi and Yalquis- Putas, which may be linked to faults underground. However, Colachi and Acamarachi seem to have separate magmatic systems. They are both relatively low over the surrounding terrain which is about high and is formed by raised ignimbrites. Acamarachi does not have glaciers or any perennial ice structures. Such lack of glaciation is also observed on other mountains in the neighbourhood such as Aucanquilcha and is probably due to the arid climate. In the past however the mountain was probably extensively glaciated, with glacier lobes forming at its foot and cirques developing around the summit. Terminal moraines lie in the Quebrada Ojos de H√©car and Quebrada Acamarachi, with several individual moraines between elevation.  Archeology  Acamarachi is known as an Inca mountain sanctuary, among at a minimum 15 other mountain sanctuaries known to have been used by the Inca. Other known sanctuaries are Cerro Colorado, Cerro Lailay, Cerro del Leon, Cerro Mullay, Cerro Toco, Cerro Quimal, Curiquinca, Juriques, Laguna Verde, Licancabur, Linzor, Paniri, Sairecabur, Tatio and Toconce. On its summit, four different ceremonial platforms are arranged in a cloverleaf conformation. Inca figurines representing individuals of various sexes have been found on Acamarachi. The figurines found at Acamarachi may represent mid-level imperial officials, considering the simple tunics they wore. One figurine made out of Spondylus shell wore miniature clothing made out of camelid wool, the clothing having an imperial design with multicoloured decorations. The tunic itself is yellow. The textiles found on Acamarachi belong to a style known as \\"Catarpe\\", which is associated with Inca presence. Such clothing seems to be miniaturized versions of Inca clothing. This figurine has no plaque, unlike some other Inca figurines. A feather and a shawl are other accessories that have been found on the figurine. The function of such figurines is unknown, several theories have been proposed, such as representing deities. Another figurine representing a woman was also found there in 1971, in red miniature clothing with decorations too, as well as a red feather. This figure is made out of silver. Such dressed figurines have been found on other Andean summits, such as Aconcagua, Cerro El Plomo, Cerro Mercedario, Cerro Las Tortolas, Cerro Gallan, Copiapo and Pichu Pichu. Acamarachi's figurines are now exposed in the R. P. Gustavo Le Paige Archaeological Museum of San Pedro de Atacama. The region in which Acamarachi is located was a southern part of the Inca Empire. A major Inca road passed by the town of Toconao, not far from Acamarachi.

It began in 2013 with a blog as well as contributing stories to NPR radio programs. The Code Switch podcast launched in 2016. In the wake of the George Floyd protests, it became one of NPR's top ranked podcasts. History Code Switch was launched in 2013 with a $1.5 million grant from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting; it developed as a blog and contributed stories to a variety of NPR programs. Harvard's Neiman Lab describes the project as \\"designed to increase coverage of race issues and reach out to new audiences\\" at NPR and affiliated media outlets. The blog began publishing on April 7, 2013 with Gene Demby's introductory essay \\"How Code-Switching Explains The World\\". The outlet's name refers to the linguistic phenomenon of code-switching, when speaker moves between multiple languages or dialectics. Demby's introductory essay said the project construed the concept broadly, with the linguistic concept also serving as means of analyzing aspects of race and culture in identity: \\"Many of us subtly, reflexively change the way we express ourselves all the time. We're hop-scotching between different cultural and linguistic spaces and different parts of our own identities‚Äîsometimes within a single interaction.\\" Content Harvard's Neiman Lab described the Code Switch project as a \\"forward-thinking effort given the rapidly changing demographics in the U.S.[;] Code Switch has grown into a place where reporters tries to consider issues around race with nuance, whether that‚Äôs the myth of the colorblind millennial, or going deep on the hit Broadway musical Hamilton.\\" The outlet has also drawn notice for reporting and commentary on topics ranging from sports and reality television, to the Supreme Court. Code Switch reporter Kat Chow has also described the project as especially interested in the \\"second beat\\" of a story: \\"If there is breaking news, we want to take a step back and see what this actually means. What is there to report on that hasn‚Äôt already been said?‚Äù Staff Team members have included Gene Demby, who is lead blogger and cohosts the podcast with reporter Shereen Marisol Meraji; Tasneem Raja, senior digital editor; supervising senior producer Alicia Montgomery; Matt Thompson and Kat Chow. Podcast In May 2016, the Code Switch team launched a podcast by the same name. Episodes are released weekly on Wednesdays. The Guardian characterized the podcast as \\"courageous conversations.\\" Wired said Code Switch's July 14, 2016 episode \\"Black and Blue\\" offered \\"thoughtful conversation about race and policing.\\" Los Angeles Magazine said, \\"NPR‚Äôs 'Code Switch' began as a popular blog, but its evolution into a podcast seems natural...it explores issues of race, culture, and politics in a personal way that flourishes in an audio format.\\" Awards and reception Code Switch won the Online News Association for best online commentary at a large outlet in 2014. In 2015, the National Association of Hispanic Journalists awarded Shereen Marisol Meraji the \\"Radio, Feature News - Large Market\\" award for her Code Switch segment \\"Tandas\\".

After winning one minor race as a juvenile he emerged as a top-class middle distance colt in 1972, winning the Predominate Stakes, Gordon Stakes and March Stakes as well as finishing second in the Irish Derby. He reached his peak as a four-year-old in 1973, winning the Earl of Sefton Stakes, Brigadier Gerard Stakes, Westbury Stakes, Eclipse Stakes and Cumberland Lodge Stakes. He also finished second in the Prince of Wales's Stakes and the Benson and Hedges Gold Cup and ran third in the Washington D C International. After his retirement from racing he stood as a breeding stallion in England and Czechoslovakia but had little success as a sire of winners. He died in 1984. Background Scottish Rifle was a \\"tall, short coupled\\" black horse bred in Ireland by the Woodpark Stud. As a yearling he was offered for sale and bought for 3,600 guineas by representatives of the Scottish shipowner A J \\"Sandy\\" Struthers. The colt was sent into training with John Dunlop at Arundel in West Sussex. He was ridden in most of his races by the Australian jockey Ron Hutchinson and was usually equipped with a sheepskin noseband. Scottish Rifle's sire Sunny Way was a good staying handicapper who won the King George V Stakes in 1960. He stood as a breeding stallion in Europe for a few years before being exported to Venezuela. His dam Radiopye was a successful handicapper who went on to produce the Nunthorpe Stakes winner Caterina. Other descendants of Radiopye have included Winter, Cricket Ball (four-time winner of the Prix de Meautry), Mubtaker (runner-up in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe) and Great Eastern (Wokingham Stakes, Prix de Meautry). Racing career =1971: two-year-old season= On his racecourse debut, Scottish rifle finished third in a race over six furlongs and then recorded his first success over seven furlongs at Ayr Racecourse in July. In his two subsequent races that year he finished second in nurseries (handicap races for two-year-olds) at York and Ayr. =1972: three-year-old season= On his three-year-old debut Scottish Rifle finished second to Baragoi in the Blue Riband Trial Stakes at Epsom Downs Racecourse in April with Rheingold in fourth. He then dropped down in class and won the Somerset Stakes against moderate opposition over ten furlongs at Bath. At Goodwood Racecourse in May he was moved up to one and a half miles for the Predominate Stakes, a major trial race for The Derby, in which his opponents included the Sandown Classic Trial winner Pentland Firth. After struggling to obtain a clear run in the straight he took the lead in the closing stages and beat Pentland Firth by half a length. In the 193rd running of the Epsom Derby, Scottish Rifle started at odds of 22/1 in a field of 22 runners. He met trouble in running on the descent to Tattenham Corner but stayed on steadily to finish sixth to Roberto who won narrowly from Rheingold with Pentland Firth in third. In the Irish Derby at the Curragh on 1 July he started at 16/1 in a field which included Roberto, Ballymore (Irish 2000 Guineas) and Lyphard. After being restrained by Hutchinson in the early stages he made progress approaching the final turn and took the lead two furlongs out. He was gradually worn down by Steel Pulse after a protracted struggle and was beaten a length into second with a gap of six lengths back to Ballymore in third. A month after his run in Ireland, Scottish Rifle was opposed by only two rivals when he started the 4/6 favourite for the Gordon Stakes at Goodwood. In a change of tactics he took the lead from the start and won by half a length from the Chester Vase winner Ormindo with four lengths back to Open Season (Railway Stakes) in third. Later in August the colt started 4/9 favourite for the March Stakes over one and three quarter miles at the same course and won \\"in style\\" from the Dick Hern- trained Ribomio. On his final start of the season he was sent to France for the Prix Royal-Oak over 3100 metres at Longchamp Racecourse on 17 September. He made no impact and finished at the rear of the field behind Pleben. =1973: four-year-old season= As a four-year-old Scottish Rifle was brought back in distance and began his campaign with three consecutive wins in Group Three events. He won the Earl of Sefton Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse in April, giving seven pounds and a one and a half length beating Royal Prerogative at odds of 10/1 with Baragoi in third. The construction of a new grandstand at Sandown Park meant that the course was unavailable for most of the year, with most of the important fixtures being transferred to Kempton Park Racecourse. It was therefore at Kempton later in April that Scottish Rifle won the Brigadier Gerard Stakes at odds of 5/4, beating Gombos by four lengths. At the same track in May, the black colt started at odds of 8/11 for the Westbury Stakes (now the Gordon Richards Stakes) and won by a length from Coup de Feu, to whom he was conceding four pounds. On his next appearance, Scottish Rifle was sent to Royal Ascot for the Prince of Wales's Stakes and was beaten a neck into second place by the French-trained colt Gift Card. Hutchinson had restrained the horse at the rear of the field for most of the way and his exaggerated waiting tactics attracted much criticism as he was perceived to have given his mount far too much ground to make up in the last quarter mile. Timeform commented that Scottish Rifle \\"ought to have won\\". The Eclipse Stakes, run in 1973 at Kempton attracted a field of six runners with Scottish Rifle being made the 15/8 favourite ahead of Moulton, Toujours Pret (Prix d'Harcourt), Sharp Edge (Irish 2000 Guineas) and Sun Prince (Prix Robert Papin, St James's Palace Stakes) and Bog Road. Scottish Rifle went to the front from the start and set a steady pace before accelerating in the straight. He never looked in any danger of defeat and won by a length and a short head from Moulton and Sun Prince. In the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes three weeks later Scottish Rifle moved up to dispute the lead in the straight but then faded to finish seventh of the twelve runners behind Dahlia. At York Racecourse in August Scottish Rifle contested the second running of the Benson and Hedges Gold Cup. Moulton, Toujours Pret and Sun Prince were again in opposition but Rheingold was made the odds-on favourite. Hutchinson attempted to repeat the tactics he had used in the Eclipse, setting a steady pace before quickening in the straight. On this occasion however, he was overtaken by Moulton a furlong out and beaten two and a half lengths into second place with Rheingold four lengths back in third. Scottish Rifle was given a five-week break before returning in the Cumberland Lodge Stakes over ten furlongs at Ascot in September. With Hutchinson recuperating from an injury he was ridden by Lester Piggott and produced a strong late run to win from Prominent (Prix Foy) and Club House at odds of 4/11. In October he was again ridden by Piggott when he contested the Champion Stakes over ten furlongs at Newmarket and finished seventh behind the Irish-trained three- year-old filly Hurry Harriet. On his final racecourse appearance Scottish Rifle was sent to the United States as his owner accepted an invitation for the colt to represent Britain in the 22nd Washington D C International at Laurel Park. Starting the complete outsider in an eight-runner field he raced prominently from the start and finished third behind Dahlia and Big Spruce. Assessment In the 1971 Free Handicap, a ranking of the season best British two-year-olds, Scottish Rifle was given a weight of 113 pounds, twenty pounds below the top-rated Crowned Prince. In 1972 the independent Timeform organization gave him a rating of 123, eleven pounds inferior to their highest-rated three-year-old colts Sallust and Deep Diver. In the Free Handicap, a ranking of the best British three-year-olds he was rated twelve pounds behind the top-rated Deep Diver. In the following year he was rated 127 by Timeform (ten pounds behind their best Older Male Rheingold) and was the fourth highest money-winner in Britain behind Dahlia, Mysterious and Morston. Stud record At the end of his racing career, Scottish Rifle was syndicated at a price of ¬£7,000 a share, giving him a theoretical value of ¬£280,000. He began his career as a breeding stallion at the Sussex Stud at West Grinstead. He was exported to Czechoslovakia in 1979 and died in 1984. His best winners included Al Trui (Stewards' Cup, Amber Rambler (Future Champion Novices' Chase) and Arva, a filly who won the Czechoslovakian Triple Crown.

Established in 1926, the organization provides special education services through Gateway School, audiology and speech-language services through its Clinical Services Department, and interpreting services for the deaf through its CIRS Interpreting Department. History and mission Established in 1926 as the Speech Reader's League of Baltimore by Dr. Olive A. Whildin, the League began as a community center for the hard of hearing. In 1930 the League was renamed the Baltimore League for the Hard of Hearing, then the Baltimore Hearing Society in 1948, and finally the Hearing and Speech Agency of Metropolitan Baltimore in 1966. HASA legitimized itself over time with connections to state and national organizations. In 1927, the League was inducted into the American Federation of Organizations for the Hard of Hearing. Though initially rejected from the Community Fund (now United Way) in 1936, the League was granted membership upon re-application in 1940. For the next twenty years, the League (known as the Society starting in 1948) continued with its audiology services until 1960 with the inauguration of its speech-language clinical program. Three years prior, Gateway School was started as a pilot program by the Association for Children with Communicative Disorders (which was merely the board of directors at the Society). With some success, Gateway became an independent partner program of the Society in 1960 in conjunction with the Society's new speech clinic. However, the two programs had limited success separately, and based on the 1965 recommendations of the Health and Welfare Council of Baltimore, Gateway School and the Baltimore Hearing Society merged in 1966 to create The Hearing and Speech Agency of Metropolitan Baltimore. The organization continued to provide just audiology and speech-language services to children and adults until 1986 with the inauguration of the Centralized Interpreter Referral Service (CIRS). From that point on, HASA began offering American Sign Language services to the Deaf community, promoting a manual language program in addition to its spoken language program. With expanded programs and a solidified mission, HASA moved to its permanent address at 5900 Metro Drive in Seton Business Park in 2003 where it continues to serve the community. Services provided =Audiology= HASA's audiology team serves almost 1000 clients per year, providing hearing tests, hearing aid evaluations, custom hearing protection, auditory processing evaluations, and more for pediatric and adult patients. HASA's audiology department was the founding one for the organization in 1926 when it was the Speech Readers' League. At that time, the League was offering hearing aid demonstrations and coordinating hearing aid distribution in the hard-of-hearing community in Baltimore. Since then the organization has expanded its efforts to include a full range of services. =Speech-language services= The speech-language pathology program at HASA also serves nearly 1000 patients per year, with over 7,300 hours of therapeutic sessions. In addition to its speech-language pathology program, HASA hosts the Center for Fluency Enhancement complete with therapy, support groups, family education, and advocacy for individuals who stutter. With the inauguration of the speech therapy program in 1960, HASA's original focus was to provide speech-language services to primarily pediatric patients. However, as services expanded the program moved to include the adult population in Baltimore. =Education= Having been established as a section of HASA in 1966 with the uniting of the two organizations, Gateway School continues to serve children ages 2‚Äì12 with communication challenges related to autism, speech-language disability, developmental delay, medical complications, or children who are deaf or hard-of-hearing. Though Gateway School is offered as an 11-month non-public special education school, HASA's educational services go beyond those with communication challenges: in 2016, HASA introduced its new Child Care Program for children ages 2‚Äì5 with and without communication difficulties =ASL interpreting= CIRS Interpreting at HASA provides American Sign Language (ASL) interpreters for the deaf and hard- of-hearing all across Maryland. CIRS offers both on-site and remote video interpreting services, as well as American Sign Language classes both on-site and off-site, Deaf awareness workshops, and internships for students of Deaf studies and Interpreting. HASA's CIRS Interpreting services include: * Sign Language Interpreter and Oral Transliterators * A ten-week, noncredit courses in American Sign Language at HASA headquarters * Off-site ASL courses and Deaf Awareness workshops for organizations Conditions treated * Aphasia * Apraxia * Auditory processing disorder * Autism spectrum disorder * Developmental delay * Down syndrome * Fragile X * Hearing loss * Language based learning disability * Speech and language impairment * Speech sound disorder * Stuttering * Tinnitus * Transgender voice & communication therapy * Voice therapy References External links * Private schools in Baltimore Health charities in the United States Non-profit organizations based in Maryland Organizations based in Baltimore Medical and health organizations based in Maryland ","title":"Hearing and Speech Agency of Baltimore"},{"id":"51246210","text":"The Gomalina River () is a river in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil.

He worked on litigation that resulted from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. U.S. News & World Report named Beaumont-based Brent Coon & Associates a Best Law Firm of 2016.  Legal career  = Texas City explosion = Following the Texas City Refinery explosion, Coon represented Eva Rowe, the daughter of Linda and James Rowe. Linda and James Rowe were among the 15 people who were killed in the refinery explosion. Brent Coon and Associates settled her lawsuit against British Petroleum for an undisclosed amount and $32 million in donations to health care, training, and safety education. = DuPont gas leak = Brent Coon and Associates represented the estate of Crystle Rae Wise. She was one of four employees at DuPont who were killed on the job when deadly methyl mercaptan gas apparently leaked. Coon reached a settlement with DuPont for an undisclosed amount. Wise's family members donated part of the settlement in the amount of $100,000 to the Humane Society of Southeast Texas. = Twin Peaks Waco incident = Coon represented four Central Texas bikers arrested after the May 2015 Twin Peaks shootout in Waco. On May 8, 2017 a lawsuit seeking $1 billion in damages was filed in an Austin federal court. = Louisiana packaging facility explosion = Coon on April 25, 2017 filed a lawsuit of behalf of a father of one of the three workers killed in a Louisiana packaging facility explosion. He represented Joe Gooch, whose son Jody Gooch was killed in the explosion. = $7 million judgment against the Houston Independent School District = Coon was awarded Litigator of the Week (August 20, 2017) by texaslawyer.com following his $7 million jury verdict against the Houston Independent School District (HISD) over its failure to pay his contractor client for renovating six of its campuses on July 24. He helped defeat a $13 million contract counterclaim the school district lodged against his client and two other parties. Controversies =Forgery in BP case= In 2013, U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier ruled that Coon had used a contract with a forged signature. The judge ruled that Coon use the signature to \\"assert that he represented a fisherman and was entitled to a cut of that man‚Äôs share of last year‚Äôs multibillion settlement with BP.‚Äù The judge told Coon that the signature he submitted does not match the signature on other documents that Coon's client, Dien Nguyen, previously submitted to the court. Judge Barbier said he believed the signature was forged. Coon told Judge Barbier that he had never met Nguyen. Instead, a woman who works for Dailey's paralegal signed up Nguyen. As a result, the judge barred Coon from receiving any funds in the Nguyen case against BP. Coon had partnered with an attorney, James J. Dailey in Alabama, who also claimed to have represented Nguyen. Judge Barbier issued the same decision against Dailey. \\"It is clear to me Mr. Dailey or Mr. Coon didn‚Äôt provide legal work entitling them to legal fees,\\" Barbier said. According to the Houston Chronicle, \\"Barbier had ordered Coon to appear for a hearing in federal court in New Orleans to explain why his claim for a 25 percent cut of Nguyen‚Äôs expected compensation under the settlement with BP should not be denied.\\" Previously, Coon said that thousands of BP oil spill clients had opted out of the mass settlement option offered by BP, instead choosing to pursue their own lawsuits. In November 2012, BP attorneys and lawyers for other plaintiffs told Judge Barbier that over 9,000 \\"opt-out documents were invalid because an attorney and not the client signed the request,\\" according to SE Texas Record. =Deepwater Horizon claim fraud= Coon represented Jack Hemmenway in his claim against the Deepwater Horizon Economic Claims Center for lost income from his small fleet of shrimp boats. Hemmenway overstated his income from one boat by $691,000. He told the claims center that he had accidentally reported net income instead of gross income to the IRS. The claims center was presented with an amended tax return for 2008 and a copy of a check to pay back taxes for $150,000. Based on these documents, the claims center issued a payment for $2,245,281 in March 2013. Investigators later discovered that the check for back taxes was never cashed and determined that the claim was fraudulent. Coon was forced to return a legal fee of $561,320 that was also paid by the claims center. =Asbestos- related racketeering and claim fraud= Coon admits to having Dr. Jay T. Segarra, a controversial radiologist from Ocean Springs, Mississippi, screen potential clients for asbestos-related injury. National Service Industries (NSI) sued Segarra, numerous other physicians, testing labs, and attorneys for racketeering in 2009. There were several John Doe defendants in the suit that were described as lawyers or law firms. Forbes openly speculated that Coon and other prominent asbestos law firms such as Barron & Budd and Motley Rice were also defendants. Coon went so far as to publicly defend Segarra. NSI alleged that doctors and attorneys conspired to fraudulently produce false diagnoses of asbestos-related illnesses. Lawyers and doctors worked with labor unions to perform X-ray screenings, often in vans just outside work sites. These lawyer- sponsored screenings typically diagnosed asbestos-related disease in 50 to 60% of the patients screened. Similar fraud has been described in detail in the papers of Lester Brickman, a law professor at Cardozo and an expert on fraud and misconduct in asbestos litigation. Independent studies typically turn up disease in 30 to 40 workers out of 1,000. In 2016, Coon, along with several other Texas trial lawyers, was sued by Humana, United Healthcare, and Aetna and for failing to compensate them for medical care that was covered under asbestos injury settlements and judgments. By failing to reimburse the insurance companies Coon was able to secure double recovery for his clients while increasing the fees he earned. The plaintiffs were able to identify at least 297 such double recovery claims. The suit asked for $19.5 million. =Delinquent taxes= Five lawsuits for unpaid property taxes totaling $122,537 were filed against Coon and companies he controls by Jefferson County of Texas in 2011. Coon blamed his failure to pay on the failure of his tenants to pay rent and poor economic conditions. =American Express= American Express sued Coon's law firm for $170,818 owed on a past due credit card account in 2011. Coon settled the suit in late 2012. =Malpractice suit= Karen and Joseph Gauci filed suit against Coon and several other lawyers for malpractice stemming from their claims for economic damages from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The plaintiffs demanded $16 million. The suit alleged Coon and his associates \\"negligently failed to carry out their duties‚Äù by not filing and serving lawsuits in a timely manner. The complaint also said that Coon and his associates failed to disclose the true situation to the plaintiffs and lied to them about the effect of late filings on the value of their claims.

In maples, the foliage becomes affected by small grey lesions which expand and coalesce, the leaves later wilting and falling from the tree early. The disease seems to be associated with cool wet summers, and epidemic years sometimes occur. Hosts The fungal pathogen Cristulariella depraedans is found in Europe and North America and mostly affects trees in the genus Acer. Trees affected in Germany and Britain are primarily the sycamore (A. pseudoplatanus) and the Norway maple (A. platanoides), while in North America the most affected are A. platanoides, the red maple (A. rubrum), the sugar maple (A. saccharum), the silver maple (A. saccharinum), the mountain maple (A. spicatum) and the vine maple (A. circinatum). In British Columbia it has also been reported on goatsbeard (Aruncus), and in South and Central America on the bullet tree (Bucida buceras). Studies in Germany between 1996 and 1999 extended the host range and a study published in 2000 recorded the pathogen's occurrence on 21 species of woody and herbaceous plants outside the maple group. It was shown to be present in Poland in a study lasting from 1996 to 2006, and beside Acers, the host range there included hornbeam (Carpinus betulus), dogwood (Cornus sanguinea), hazel (Corylus avellana), beech (Fagus sylvatica), honeysuckle (Lonicera xylosteum), bird cherry (Prunus padus), pedunculate oak (Quercus robur) and lime (Tilia cordata). It is unclear whether this increased host range is because of more intensive study or whether environmental factors have encouraged the fungus to attack new hosts. Symptoms Branch of sycamore tree affected by C. depraedans The fungus develops on the surface of the leaf blades. At first there are scattered water-soaked grey spots about in diameter, but as the disease progresses, these lesions expand and coalesce and much of the leaf surface may be affected. Fruiting bodies resembling tiny white pinheads develop on either the upper or lower side (or both) of the leaf, particularly near the veins. Small black sclerotia may also form. At some stage the leaves wilt and eventually fall prematurely. In the Polish study, many of the affected host trees had characteristic pigmentation of the necrotic areas, with the centre and periphery of the lesions differing. Disease cycle This disease can cause slight to moderate defoliation but the tree usually fully recovers the following year. The disease is infrequent but under suitable conditions of coolness and moisture can be of epidemic proportions. It seems to be associated with cool, wet summers and mostly affects the lower branches of trees.

The MORT transcript is produced in all mortal cell types, but is lost in a large fraction of the most common human cancers and therefore might have a tumor suppressive function.  Genomic location  The MORT gene is located on human chromosome 19, at position 56,989,000‚Äì57,007,000 (hg19) within a cluster of zinc finger genes (ZNF genes). The MORT gene consists of 2 exons, 260 and 1270 bp, respectively, that are separated by a 16 kbp intron. A large portion of the second MORT exon is formed by repetitive elements ‚Äì two LINEs and an LTR element. The MORT promoter is located in a CpG island that is shared with the ZNF667 gene; the two genes reside in a head to head orientation with one another. Despite the MORT gene's location inside a cluster of ZNF genes, the MORT gene is not homologous to any ZNF genes. While the MORT gene is in a head to head orientation with ZNF667, MORT does not overlap the ZNF667 gene, nor does it share any antisense homology to ZNF667, so the officially used symbol ZNF667-AS1 is somewhat misleading.  Evolution  MORT has orthologs only in great apes ‚Äì chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans, and the RNA expression data indicates that the MORT transcript is expressed in these species. Thus, from a phylogenetic point view, MORT is likely a young lincRNA gene that emerged during evolution of great apes. It is possible that the long life span of the great apes required evolution of additional genes with tumor suppressive activity, and that MORT is such an example.  Silencing in cancer  MORT is expressed in all 16 normal human tissues reported in the Illumina body map data, as well as all in vitro cultured, finite lifespan, human cell strains that have been analyzed. In contrast, MORT gene expression is lost in a large percentage of human cancers and human cancer cell lines. Using data from human cancers curated in TCGA, MORT RNA expression and DNA methylation state were evaluated in the 10 most common male cancers and the 10 most common female cancers (totalling 17 different cancer types based on TCGA classification). Analysis shows that the MORT gene expression is silenced by DNA hypermethylation of its CpG island promoter in a majority of human tumor samples in 15 of these 17 human cancers. The 15 tumor types where MORT is frequently silenced are acute myeloid leukemia, bladder urothelial carcinoma, breast invasive carcinoma, colon adenocarcinoma, head and neck squamous-cell carcinoma, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma, liver hepatocellular carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, lymphoid neoplasm diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, rectum adenocarcinoma, skin cutaneous melanoma, and Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma. MORT is silenced in cervical cancer and therefore may serve as an independent prognostic factor with low MORT expression be associated with a decreased overall survival. Since cell immortality is an obligate feature of the cancer cell and MORT was discovered as a target of epigenetic silencing at the boundary where finite lifespan human cells transition from mortal to immortal, MORT‚Äôs epigenetic inactivation may create a cellular state permissive to cell immortalization and suggests a possible tumor suppressive mechanism of MORT‚Äôs action. If this prediction is true, then epigenetic silencing of MORT should be an early identifiable lesion during human carcinogenesis and predicted to occur in premalignant lesions where cells have acquired pathologic immortality on their route to malignant transformation. Indeed, recent work has shown that MORT is epigenetically silenced in both DCIS, a premalignant lesion of invasive breast cancer, and colonic adenomas, a premalignant lesion of colon adenocarcinoma. Furthermore epigenetic silencing of MORT is associated with luminal, hormone receptor positive breast cancer, overexpression of the oncogene CCND1, and GATA3 mutations, but is negatively correlated with p53 mutations. In summary, aberrant DNA hypermethylation- mediated epigenetic silencing of MORT occurs early during human carcinogenesis apparently coincident with when a mortal cell pathologically transitions to an immortal cell.  Cellular Function  The precise molecular function of MORT remains enigmatic; however, it is known that MORT is found preferentially in the cell cytoplasm with differential density centrifugation showing that MORT is enriched in the 100,000 g fraction, which contains polysomes, microsomes, endoplasmic reticulum, and the plasma membrane. Evidence is mounting that MORT acts as a regulator of protein translation through interactions with RNA binding proteins.

Background After existing for several centuries, the vocation of deacon was gradually transformed in the Catholic Church into an office reserved to men who were candidates for ordination as priests and were ordained as temporary deacons. Participants in the Second Vatican Council recommended the restoration of the ancient permanent diaconate with votes taken in October 1963 and September 1964. The Council's Dogmatic Constitution on the Church (Lumen gentium) said that: chapter III, paragraph 29. Although the question of including women in the ordained diaconate was brought to the Council, in 1967, Pope Paul VI authorized the establishment of a ministry of permanent deacons, still restricted to men but open to married men. Under the rules he established, both permanent and transitional deacons belonged to a single order and were ordained according to the same rite. The Catholic Church last examined the question of women deacons in 2002 in a report by the International Theological Commission, an advisory body to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. On 26 October 2009, Pope Benedict XVI modified canon law to clarify the distinction between deacons and priests, noting that only the latter act \\"in the person of Christ\\", that the diaconate and priesthood are specific ministries rather than stages within the sacrament of order, thereby ending the argument that women can not be deacons because they cannot be priests. Archbishop Paul-Andr√© Durocher of Gatineau, Canada, raised the idea of ordaining women as deacons when speaking to the Synod on the Family in 2015, and continued to raise the issue following the synod. A few senior prelates have taken opposing positions on the possibility of a female diaconate, including Cardinals Walter Kasper and Gerhard M√ºller. Some bishops have supported the ordination of women as deacons. In a May 2016 audience with women religious at the triennial assembly of the International Union of Superiors General (UISG), Pope Francis was asked about whether women could be included in the permanent diaconate, as was the case in the early church, and was asked about the possibility of establishing an official commission to study the matter. Francis responded that the history was \\"obscure\\" and that it was not clear what role woman deacons played or that they were ordained, and added: \\"It seems useful to me to have a commission that would clarify this well.\\" Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi subsequently noted that Francis \\"did not say he intends to introduce a diaconal ordination for women and even less did he speak of the priestly ordination of women.\\" Creation When Pope Francis created the Study Commission on the Women's Diaconate on 2 August 2016, he tasked it with considering the possibility of allowing women to serve as deacons in the Roman Catholic Church. He named Archbishop Luis Francisco Ladaria SJ, Secretary of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, as its President and twelve members, six women and six men: *, member of the Pontifical Biblical Commission *Francesca Cocchini, faculty member at La Sapienza University (Rome) and the Patristic Institute Augustinianum *, president of Sophia University Institute (Rome), member of the International Theological Commission *Robert Dodaro OSA, president of the Patristic Institute Augustinianum *Santiago Madrigal SJ, ecclesiologist at the Pontifical University Comillas (Madrid) *Mary Melone SFA, president of the Pontifical University Antonianum (Rome) *, emeritus professor of dogmatic theology at the University of Bonn, member of the International Theological Commission *Aimable Musoni SDB, ecclesiologist at Salesian Pontifical University (Rome) *Bernard Pottier SJ, faculty member at Institute D'etudes Th√©ologiques (Brussels), member of the International Theological Commission *, theologian at the University of Vienna, member of the International Theological Commission; *Michelina Tenace, theologian at the Pontifical Gregorian University (Rome) *Phyllis Zagano, senior research associate-in- residence at Hofstra University (New York) The commission's members appear divided in their views. Zagano has written a book titled Holy Saturday: An Argument for the Restoration of the Female Diaconate in the Catholic Church, while Menke has argued that women cannot be deacons because they cannot be priests. In August 2016, the UISG thanked the Pope for following through on his commitment and for the number of women members. Work of the Study Commission and outcome The Commission held its first meeting in November 2016 in Rome. The Study Commission produced an initial report to Pope FrancisJoshua J. McElwee, Francis: Women deacons commission gave split report on their role in early church, National Catholic Reporter (May 7, 2019). by January 2019.Christopher White, Papal advisers say Francis will know right moment to act on women deacons, Cruz (January 16, 2019). In May 2019, Francis said the Study Commission had not yet produced a \\"definitive response\\" due to a lack of consensus regarding the role of female deacons in early Christianity. Francis stated that: \\"They worked together. And they found agreement up to a certain point. But each one of them has their own vision, which doesn't accord with that of the others. They stopped there as a commission, and each one is studying and going ahead.\\" While Francis indicated that individual study continued, he did not indicate whether the Study Commission remains active as a body.

Zdesenko (); 6 October 1943 ‚Äì 1 September 2004, was a Ukrainian nuclear physicist known for a significant contribution to investigations of double beta decay.  Early life  Yuri G. Zdesenko was born on 6 October 1943 in Dmytrivka, Bakhmach Raion, Chernihiv Oblast, Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic of the Soviet Union to Soviet Army officer Georgy Zdesenko.  Academic career  In 1970 Zdesenko was graduated from the Department of Physics of the T.G.Shevchenko Kyiv State University. He obtained degrees of Candidate of Sciences (Philosophy Doctor) in 1981 (Institute for Nuclear Research, Moscow, Soviet Union), Doktor nauk in 1990 (Institute for Nuclear Research, Kiev, Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic) and the academic rank of Full Professor in 2000 (Institute for Nuclear Research, Kiev, Ukraine). Taking into account his outstanding scientific achievements, Zdesnko was elected in 2003 a Corresponding Member of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine.  Research  Zdesenko started researches in the Laboratory of Nuclear Physics of the T.G. Shevchenko Kyiv State University (1970-1971) and then in the Institute of Geochemistry and Physics of Minerals (1971-1980) where he dealt with neutron activation analysis of minerals and radiocarbon dating. At that time he became interested in double beta decay of atomic nuclei.Y.G. Zdesenko, \\"Double Œ≤ decay and conservation of lepton charge.\\" Sov. J. Part. Nucl. 11 (1980) 542. In 1980 he created the Laboratory for Low Background Measurements of the Special Construction Technological Center of the Institute for Nuclear Research of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences (1980-1986) where searches for the double beta decay of 130Te,Y.G.

In 1986 the laboratory was transformed to the Lepton Physics Department of the Institute for Nuclear Research (Kiev, Ukraine). In the early 1980s Zdesenko, supported by Bruno Pontecorvo (who was at that time head of the neutrino council of the Soviet Academy of Sciences), Yuri G. Zdesenko with Bruno Pontecorvo on the background of the Elbrus mountain, Baksan valley, Russia, 1987 initiated construction of the Solotvina Underground Laboratory in Solotvina, at the Zakarpattia Oblast on the west of Ukraine. The Laboratory was located in a salt mine at a depth of 430 m. Low counting experiments were started in the Solotvina laboratory in 1984. Investigations of rare nuclear alpha and beta decays, searches for neutrinoless double beta decay of atomic nuclei were performed in the laboratory. The most valuable results obtained in the Solotvina Underground Laboratory are as following: # the most stringent limits on neutrinoless double beta decay of 116Cd obtained with the help of cadmium tungstate crystal scintillators enriched in isotope 116Cd at 83%.

Established in 2014, the party is active only in South Carolina. History The American Party of South Carolina was founded by physician Oscar Lovelace and former South Carolina Superintendent of Education Jim Rex in 2014. According to Rex and Lovelace, their impetus in starting the new party was to present a centrist alternative to the Republican Party and Democratic Party that could address perceived government dysfunction. Rex and Lovelace began collecting the 10,000 petition signatures required for formal party recognition under South Carolina state law during the 2013 South Carolina State Fair. Voter discontent with the United States federal government shutdown of 2013, which coincided with the fair, helped invigorate an unusually robust level of interest in the proposed new party. In 2014, the first year of electoral activity for the party, it unsuccessfully ran four candidates for public office in that year's South Carolina elections. The same year its youth wing, Young Americans, was established with an inaugural chapter at Winthrop University. The party's 2016 state convention was attended by 61 delegates from nine South Carolina counties, and nominated Peter Skewes as its candidate for president of the United States, as well as candidates for five other offices. As of 2016, the party said it hoped to expand beyond South Carolina and it registered with the Federal Elections Commission the same year. On October 14, 2018 a group of independent state political organizations, including the American Party, joined together to create the Alliance Party. Jim Rex is the National Chair. Platform According to the party, it supports term limits, campaign finance reform, and \\"attacking problems from the center instead of the left or the right\\".

While in Ohio, he also participated in Boy Scouts of America and became an Eagle Scout. He attended the University of Minnesota and graduated in 1937. While in school, he went to do field work in Peru and Bolivia in 1935, and later went to Mexico in 1936 and again in 1937. Ferdon's brother John Ferdon was killed at age 17 due to a radio that fell into the bath water in 1936 while Ferdon was away in Mexico City. Career After graduation, he worked for the Museum of New Mexico in Santa Fe, New Mexico as a curator until 1938. He left that job in order to do fieldwork in Ecuador for three years where he conducted archaeological surveys. He went on to attend the University of California to obtain a master's degree. In 1955, Thor Heyerdahl asked Ferdon to go on an expedition to Easter Island as an archaeologist. Ferdon was one of four archaeologists who went on the expedition. While in Eastern Polynesia, Ferdon studied the walking rituals and the details of modern life in Tahiti. Ferdon also took many photographs to document the expedition.

It protects the headwaters of an important source of water for communities in the state, including the state capital. The park has been starved of funds for administration and surveillance. It has suffered from illegal logging, burning, grazing and hunting. Location The Mirador State Park is in the municipality of Mirador, Maranh√£o. It has an area of about . The park covers the Serra do Itapecuru, which rises to between the basins of the Alpercatas and Itapecuru rivers. It protects the watershed and headwaters of several tributaries of the upper Itapecuru, an important source of water for twenty cities in Maranh√£o including S√£o Lu√≠s. Environment The climate is dry, subhumid, with annual rainfall of . Average maximum temperatures are . Average minimum temperatures are . Vegetation is mainly cerrado, cerrad√£o and gallery forest. A 2013 survey of flora found 53 families, 98 genera and 140 species. The families with the greatest number of species were Malpighiaceae, Leguminosae, Rubiaceae, Cyperaceae, Convolvulaceae, Melastomataceae, Malvaceae, Vochysiaceae and Dilleniaceae. Trees include red and yellow ip√™ (Tabebuia), arueira and cedar. Vegetation is low, gnarled trees with thick bark. Economically important trees include the pau-terra (Vochysiaceae), pequi (Caryocar brasiliense), lobeira (Solanum lycocarpum), ainda, bacuri, pequi and murici for fruit, and the medicinal sucupira (Pterodon emarginatus) and jatob√° (Hymenaea courbaril). The fava-danta (Dimorphandra mollis), common in the park, is the source of the alkaloid pilocarpine for the pharmaceutical industry. Most of the riparian trees are large buriti palms. Fauna includes endangered species such as the king vulture (Sarcoramphus papa), giant armadillo (Priodontes maximus) and bush dog (Speothos venaticus). Other species include Amazon parrots, parakeets, partridges, seriemas, margay (Leopardus wiedii), deer, cobras and armadillos. Reptiles include the anaconda, the alligator and rattlesnake. Researchers have identified 60 species of fish, one apparently a new species. The park has suffered from illegal fishing and hunting, burning and logging. Some of the original residents remain in the park. They use the area for grazing and small-scale crops. In August 2015 the deputy Rigo Teles spoke out in the State Assembly about the environmental degradation of the state park, which he had recently visited. He said that after the cooperative stopped managing the park there had been widespread fires and the wild animals were being decimated by hunters. History The Mirador State Park was created by decree 7.641 of 4 June 1980 on state-owned land to protect the river sources. The park was limited to the Mirador municipality, so the surrounding municipalities had no commitment to preserving the rivers. Administration is the responsibility of a department of the State Secretariat of Environment and Natural Resources (SEMA), which outsources the work to a cooperative. Often the contract is not renewed for months or years, and there is no monitoring of results. For most of the first thirty years the park therefore existed only on paper, and the potential for scientific research and ecotourism was not realised. SEMA announced the start of preparation of a management plan, including a full study of the ecosystem and detailed plans to preserve it, but for many years no work was done. The decree creating the park was adjusted by law 8.959 of 8 May 2009. On 23 November 2009 it SEMA announced that it would spend R$500,000 to prepare a management plan, starting with a biotic diagnosis lasting from 8 months to a year. This would be the basis for defining zoning of the park and the objectives for each area. 18 biologists, 11 researchers and 10 coordinators would be involved, provided by various universities. Law 9.316 of 23 December 2010 recognised the Cooperativa dos T√©cnicos em Prote√ß√£o Ambientaldo Parque Estadual de Mirador as providing a public service in managing the park. At the end 2012 the municipality of Mirador passed a law that allowed it to take more responsibility for the environment of the municipality, assuming some activities from the federal and state governments, including joint management of the state park. The municipality felt it would be better able to use available funding to preserve the park. As of mid-2015 there were no rangers assigned to the park. In January 2016 the State Government announced that it would hold public hearings in Mirador on the condition of the park to address the demand of the vice-prefect of the city, Jos√© Ronilde Pereira de Sousa (\\"Rony\\") to fight environmental degradation due to fires and poaching. In June 2016 technicians from the responsible SEMA department, with members of the environmental police and the fire department, visited communities in the park and surrounding villages to explain the importance of avoiding environmental damage. Most of the locals were engaged in cassava farming, raising some pigs and cattle that graze in the park. Residents suspected of having chainsaws in their houses were disciplined, and two guns were seized.

The creek has no named tributaries and is not designated as an impaired waterbody. The valley of Dundaff Creek has is relatively deep and not very asymmetric. Flooding has occurred along the creek, and has occasionally impacted the community of Clifford. Communities along the creek include Clifford and Dundaff. A number of bridges have been constructed over Dundaff Creek in both Susquehanna County and Lackawanna County. The watershed of the creek is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery except for the watershed of an unnamed tributary, which is designated as a Warmwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Wild trout naturally reproduce in the creek and there are wetlands at its headwaters, which are listed on the Susquehanna County Natural Areas Inventory. Course Dundaff Creek begins in a wetland in Clifford Township, Susquehanna County. It flows northwest for a few tenths of a mile before turning west-southwest and entering another wetland. After a few tenths of a mile, the creek turns southwest for several tenths of a mile, receiving one unnamed tributary from the left before entering a third wetland, where it receives an unnamed tributary from the right. It continues flowing southwest before crossing Pennsylvania Route 247 and turning west-southwest for a few tenths of a mile, receiving one unnamed tributary from the left and one from the right. The creek then turns south-southwest for several tenths of a mile, exiting Susquehanna County. Upon exiting Susquehanna County, Dundaff Creek enters Greenfield Township, Lackawanna County. It flows south for a few tenths of a mile before gradually turning west, beginning to flow alongside Pennsylvania Route 106 as it receives two more unnamed tributaries (one from the left and one from the right) before crossing the highway. The creek then turns north-northwest for a few tenths of a mile alongside Pennsylvania Route 106 before turning west-southwest. After several tenths of a mile, it turns north, receiving an unnamed tributary from the left and reentering Clifford Township, Susquehanna County. Here, the creek flows north for several tenths of a mile, receiving an unnamed tributary from the left and crossing Pennsylvania Route 106. It then turns northwest for several tenths of a mile before reaching its confluence with East Branch Tunkhannock Creek. Dundaff Creek is approximately long.

Geography and geology The elevation near the mouth of Dundaff Creek is above sea level. The elevation near the source of the creek is above sea level. The valley of Dundaff Creek was one of the most transverse to ice flow during the Ice Age of any stream valley in the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Clifford. The creek's valley has been described as \\"deeply incised\\" and is not very asymmetric. There are very thick layers of till on the north side and bedrock on the south side. The surficial geology along the lower reaches of Dundaff Creek mainly consists of alluvium, with some patches of wetland and Wisconsinan Outwash nearby and Wisconsinan Till on the side of the valley. Further upstream, the surficial geology along the creek is still predominantly alluvium, but the alluvium band is thinner, with Wisconsinan Till coming much closer to the creek. There are also patches of bedrock consisting of sandstone and shale nearby, as well as a patch of Wisconsinan Outwash, a patch of alluvial fan and a much smaller patch of Wisconsinan Ice-Contact Stratified Drift. Near the creek's headwaters, the surficial geology consists mainly of Wisconsinan Till and bedrock, with some wetlands. Watershed The watershed of Dundaff Creek has an area of . The creek is entirely within the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Clifford. Its mouth is located within of Clifford and the community of Dundaff is located near the headwaters. At times, major flooding has caused inundation of some structures in localized areas in the vicinity of Dundaff Creek. The village of Clifford has also been impacted by flooding from the creek at times. The designated use for Dundaff Creek is aquatic life. The headwaters of the creek are listed on the Susquehanna County Natural Areas Inventory. The forests surrounding wetlands at the headwaters of Dundaff Creek are fragmented by agricultural land in some areas. There is also accelerating residential development to the south of the wetlands, and many wetlands in Susquehanna County are in danger of being flooded for recreational purposes. History Dundaff Creek was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1173604. A dam known as the Dundaff Dam was constructed on Dundaff Creek in 1956 in Greenfield Township, Lackawanna County. It was privately owned and built by a rod and gun club for recreation purposes. The dam was high and before it was removed due to its poor condition and silted impoundment. The removal of the dam improved an estimated of stream habitat. A steel stringer/multi-beam or girder bridge carrying State Route 2008 over Dundaff Creek was built in 1951 in Clifford Township, Susquehanna County and is long. A prestressed box beam or girders bridge carrying Pennsylvania Route 106 over the creek in the same township was built in 2009 and is long. A bridge of the same type and carrying the same road, but in Greenfield Township, Lackawanna County, was built over the creek in 1959 and repaired in 2007; this bridge is long. Another bridge of the same type was built over the creek in Greenfield Township for State Route 1013 in 1996 and is long. In 2013, the bridge carrying State Route 2008 (Airport Road) over Dundaff Creek had its weight limit set to 33 tons, or 39 tons for combination loads. This was one of about a thousand bridges in Pennsylvania whose weight limits were changed at that time. A bridge carrying Creamery Road over Dundaff Creek in Clifford Township, Susquehanna County was closed for reconstruction in August 2015 as part of a Public-Private Partnership to repair 558 bridges in Pennsylvania. Although there were several construction delays, the bridge was reopened on March 15, 2016. Two new Pennsylvania-funded bridges carrying Pennsylvania Route 247 over the creek are slated for completion in 2018 and 2020, for a cost of $350,000 and $300,000, respectively. Biology The drainage basin of Dundaff Creek is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery except for the watersheds of unnamed tributaries joining the creek upstream of its mouth, which are designated as a Warmwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Wild trout naturally reproduce in Dundaff Creek from its headwaters downstream to its mouth. The wetlands at the headwaters of Dundaff Creek are probably mainly impoundments influenced by beavers, plus the occasional shrub swamp and sedge grass marshes with a northern hardwood matrix. One peatland or bog habitat in the area is surrounded by a large hemlock swamp forest. Additionally, an animal species of concern was observed in the wetlands in 1985.

Consecrated without the permission of the pope, Steenoven was at the center of the 18th-century controversy between national churches and what many considered to be the overreaching powers of the papacy. Education and early ministry Steenoven was educated in Louvain, then in Rome, where he received his Doctor of Theology.Neale, p. 252. He was ordained a priest in 1689. Steenoven served as a pastor in Amersfoort from 1692 to 1719. Beginning in 1700, Steenoven served as a canon of the Cathedral Chapter of Utrecht, which was suspended by Rome in 1700 after a conflict during the time of Petrus Codde, the former Archbishop of Utrecht, whom Steenoven came to know in Rome.Neale, p. 252. Like Van der Croon, a later Old Catholic Archbishop of Utrecht, van Steenoven was one of 300 priests in six diocese who had previously signed a protest in support of Archbishop Petrus Codde in 1700 or 1701.Moss, p. 122. In 1719, Steenoven was elected vicar general of the Chapter of Utrecht and served in this capacity together with Gisbert Van Dyck under the Chapter's dean, John Christian Van Erkel.Neale, p. 251. Election as Archbishop of Utrecht The Chapter of Utrecht convened at The Hague on April 27, 1723. All eight canons were present: John Christian Van Erkel (dean), Steenoven and Gilbert Van Dyck (vicars general), Daellenoort, Oosterling, Van der Croon, Kemp, and Broedersen.Neale, p. 251. In addition to the canons, other priests were present, including Jacob Krys and Van Haen. After the Mass of the Holy Ghost, the canons prepared to advance the rights of the Catholic episcopate over the papacy by electing their own archbishop. They adopted a measure to proceed with an election by scrutiny; Jacob Krys served as protonotary of the election, and two non-canon priests served as witnesses.Neale, p. 251. Steenoven received the majority of votes and was named Archbishop-elect of Utrecht. Requests for consecration The Chapter of Utrecht and the archbishop-elect asked Pope Innocent XIII to permit the consecration of Steenoven, but they received no response. The election of Steenoven as Archbishop-elect of Utrecht became the conversation of the European Roman Catholic Church, with various voices wondering whether Rome would allow the election, whether the canons would persevere in advocating for their right to elect their own archbishop, whether three bishops could be found to consecrate the archbishop-elect, and whether a single bishop would dare to perform the consecration alone. French Bishop and Jansenist theologian Pierre de Langle (of the Diocese of Boulogne in Northern France), wrote: \\"I can think of nothing except the present state of the glorious church of Utrecht.‚ÄùNeale, p. 253. On August 4, 1723, the Chapter of Utrecht sent a second letter to the pope.Kemp, vol. II, p. 41. Having received no response to their previous two communications, they sent a third letter to the pope on December 29, 1723.Kemp, vol. II, p. 41. In the meantime, van Erkel kept the conversation alive on the rights of national churches to elect their own prelates. Ultramontane voices favoring the power of the papacy penned responses, including a dialogue between Warmond and Regthart, and a letter from a doctor in Louvain to a friend in Holland on the supposed rights of \\"the so-called Chapter of Utrecht.\\"Neale, p. 253. On March 9, 1724, the Chapter of Utrecht sent a letter to all Roman Catholic bishops on the sufferings of the Church of Utrecht, then received news of the death of Pope Innocent XIII on March 7.Neale, p. 253. Pope Innocent XIII did not confirm Steenoven's election, but neither did he condemn it; the hope was had that his successor might more kindly look upon the plight of the Church of Utrecht.Neale, p. 253. Steenoven and Van Dyck, in their capacity as vicars general of the Chapter, published a pastoral letter asking for the prayers of the faithful for the deceased pope.Neale, p. 254. The next day, on April 8, 1724, the cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church met in conclave and issued a letter in which they reproached the Chapter of Utrecht.Neale, p. 253. The Internuncio also denounced the work of the Chapter of Utrecht in a widely-disbursed pamphlet addressed to all Roman Catholics in Holland.Neale, p. 254. The Chapter responded with a firm reply to the Internuncio.Kemp, vol. II, pp. 251. The Chapter also issued a letter to all Catholic deans and chapters, urging them to stand against the papacy's invasion of local church rights; they also wrote to the universities of Louvain, Douai, Paris, Rheims, Nantes, Caen, Poictiers, Cologne, Vienna, Prague, and Strasbourg.Neale, p. 254. On the dearth of replies to the communications of the Chapter of Utrecht, Kemp wrote: \\"Verily, they were all dumb dogs‚Äîthey could not bark! Let them all, let bishops, canons, universities, be silent! Such a silence, noble clergy and illustrious Chapter [of Utrecht], is a clear proof that your Archbishop has been well and validly elected, and that you may proceed with full assurance to his consecration.‚ÄùNeale, p. 254. On May 29, 1724, Cardinal Orsini was elected to the vacant see as Pope Benedict XIII. Having appealed to him and received no response, the Chapter of Utrecht asked neighboring bishops to come to their aid and consecrate Steenoven. The well-known French bishop and Jansenist Charles De Caylus is said to have replied: \\"If I were in the country, I wouldn't have the slightest difficulty in imposing my hands [on the archbishop-elect].\\"Neale, p. 255. The bishops of Bishops of Antwerp, Arras, and Saint-Omer (or Audomar) expressed sympathy for the plight of the Church of Utrecht.Neale, p. 255. On July 30, the Bishop of Antwerp consecrated his brother as titular bishop of Rhodes, presumably with papal approval, but made the shrewd move of doing so alone, without the assistance of any other bishop, as if to encourage another bishop to act alone in assisting the Church of Utrecht. Dom Thierry de Viaixnvs seems to have inquired into the thoughts of French bishops on the matter. In a letter to the Chapter of Utrecht dated September 10, 1724, he shared that the Bishops of Montpelier, Senez and Auxerre were in favor of Steenoven's consecration, and that, as far as he could tell, the bishops of Bayeux, Pamiers, Macon, Rhodez, Angoulerne, Metz, Troyes, and the ex-bishop of Tourney were of the same opinion. Eighteen months after the election of the archbishop-elect, on October 13, 1724, the Chapter of Utrecht wrote to Dominique Marie Varlet, former Bishop of Babylon, who now resided in Amsterdam. They restated their case, saying: \\"We are as sheep that have no shepherd who may be Christ‚Äôs vicar in our Church: by [God], then, Who is the Shepherd and Bishop of our souls, we beseech, entreat, and conjure you to give us the desire of our hearts. What will be your praise in the Catholic Church, if you raise up again a Church that has almost fallen...that when [God] shall renew His signs, and shall do wondrously, it may minister to the execution of His counsels?‚ÄùNeale, p. 256. Varlet consented to consecrate Steenoven as Archbishop of Utrecht. Consecration as Archbishop of Utrecht Two days later, on Sunday, October 15, 1724, in the presence of the Chapter of Utrecht, Steenoven was consecrated by Varlet in the bishop's private chapel in Amsterdam.Neale, p. 256. The consecration took place at 6:00 a.m., to accommodate parish priests (viz., Jacob Krys, Luke Ahuys, and Theodore Doncker) who celebrated Sunday services in their parishes later in the morning.Neale, p. 256. Varlet was assisted during the ceremony by Van Erkel and Daellenoort. Letters of congratulations were penned by several Roman Catholic bishops, including Charles-Joachim Colbert de Croissy of Montpellier, Charles de Caylus of Auxerre, De Lorraine of Bayeux, De Tilladet, of M√¢con, [257] De Verthamon, of Pamiers; Soanen, of Senez.Neale, pp. 256-257. Tourourre, of Rhodez; Dreuillet, of Bayonne; D‚ÄôArbreuve, of Dax; De Corslin, of Tarbes; Meaupon, of Lombez; Beaujen, of Castres; De Verthamon, of Lugon. Through the consecration of Steenoven without papal approval, it was a definite break with from the Roman Catholic Church.Moss, p. 123. Censure by the Roman Catholic Church After his consecration, Archbishop Steenoven wrote to Pope Benedict XIII and other chief Roman Catholic bishops to inform them of his consecration. He wrote a manifesto explaining the principles on which he and his clergy had acted, appealing to a future General Council of the church. On February 21, 1725, Pope Benedict XIII issued a brief declaring the election of Steenoven null and void, calling his consecration \\"illicit and execrable,\\" and censuring Bishop Varlet.Moss, p. 124. The \\"Utrecht Schism\\" resulted in the birth of the Old Catholic Church of the Netherlands, which was also known as the \\"Jansenistenkerk.\\" Death By the time the papal brief reached The Netherlands, Steenoven was seriously ill. He died on April 3, 1725, less than six months after his consecration as Archbishop of Utrecht.Moss, p. 125. He was buried in the Reform Church of Warmond.

According to Bellegarde, years before Barchman Wuytiers went to Paris, Pashasius Quesnel had prophesied that Barchman Wuytiers would one day be Archbishop of Utrecht.Dupac de Bellegarde, p. 334. Consecration as Archbishop of Utrecht Upon the death of Archbishop Cornelius van Steenoven on April 3, 1725, Barchmann Wuytiers was unanimously elected by the Chapter of Utrecht on May 15, 1725 to fill the vacant see.Moss, p. 125. As in the case of Barchman Wuytiers' predecessor, the Chapter notified the pope of the election of the archbishop-elect, requesting the pope's confirmation of the election and a dispensation for consecration by a single bishop. On August 23, 1725, Pope Benedict XIII issued a condemnation of the election of Barchman Wuytiers as Archbishop of Utrecht. The papal condemnation was even harsher than that of Barchman Wuytier's predecessor, Steenoven, suggesting that both Archbishop Steenoven and a priest named Theodore Doncker, who was present at Steenoven's consecration, died due to divine vengeance.Moss, p. 126. Doncker, who was actually still alive, would later use the false statement of his death in the condemnation to argue against papal infallibility.Moss, p. 126. On September 30, 1725, in the Church of St. James and St. Augustine in The Hague, Barchman Wuytiers was consecrated Archbishop of Utrecht by Bishop Dominique Marie Varlet. He received more than 100 letters of congratulation, signed by more than 2,000 ecclesiastics, including all the Roman Catholic bishops who had congratulated his predecessor, Steenoven.Moss, p. 129. Excommunication by the Roman Catholic Church Barchman Wuytiers sent word of his consecration to Pope Benedict XIII, who responded by excommunicating Barchman Wuytiers and all who assisted, encouraged and followed him. Barchman Wuytiers replied that he would offer to resign as Archbishop of Utrecht on the condition that Benedict XIII would recognize the rights of the Chapter of Utrecht and not force him and his priests to accept Unigenitus, the papal bull written in 1713 by Pope Clement XI condemning 101 purportedly Jansenist propositions.Moss, pp. 126-127. Refuge for the Persecuted Barchman Wuytiers received into his archdiocese clergy and religious who were persecuted in other places for their refusal to accept Unigenitus, including 31 Carthusian monks and 14 Cistercian monks from France.Moss, p. 129. He attempted to form a mission to Indo-China by French missionaries who refused to accept Unigenitus.Moss, p. 130. Responsibility for the Diocese of Haarlem The Chapter of Utrecht subsequently inquired of canonists in Louvain whether it had the right, as chapter of the metropolitan see, to appoint a vicar general for Haarlem, if the Chapter of Haarlem refused or delayed in doing so. With the assent of the canonists, the Chapter of Utrecht appointed Barchman Wuytiers as vicar general of the Diocese of Haarlem. He thus governed the parishes of the Diocese of Haarlem, both in his capacity as vicar general of the diocese and as metropolitan.Moss, p. 127. Barchman Wuytiers was anxious to consecrate a bishop for the Diocese of Haarlem. After consulting Zeger Bernhard van Espen and others, he notified the Chapter at Haarlem that he would exercise his right as metropolitan to name a bishop, if they failed to elect their own candidate within three months. Three months passed, and Barchman Wuytiers assembled his chapter, which unanimously elected Theodore Doncker, who died before he was consecrated bishop of Haarlem.Moss, p. 130.

It was invented or improved by a Parisian instrument maker named Galander around 1853.  History  Very little is known about the galandronome and its inventor Galander, whose first name has been lost. Galander seems to have taken over the Paris workshop from instrument maker Jean Nicolas Savary (1786‚Äìc.1850) around 1840 and kept it until 1854 when he sold it to Georges Schubert. Although the galandronome is unanimously called a military bassoon, Will Jansen believes that it was never suitable as a military instrument due to its big flared bell that would catch rain.  Description  The galandronome is made of maple and brass with a body slightly larger than the usual bassoons. It has a large flare bell, possibly the largest ever made for a bassoon. Its dimensions are: length (end to end) 1545 mm; length of tube ca. 2888 mm; diameter of bell 212 mm; crook ca. 370 mm; length of wing section 553 mm; length of butt section 464 mm; length of short wooden section between long section and bell 140 mm; length of long section 639 mm; length of bell 443 mm. Like all bassoons, it is a double-reed instrument. It has 19 keys and two open holes. The galandronome is tuned in B‚ô≠, below the normal basson in C and above the semi-contrabassoon in F or G. The only known surviving instrument is found at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. It carries the engraving ‚ÄúInnov√© / par Galander / Rue de Constantine 27, / √† Paris. / I. C.‚Äù It is therefore possible that Galander did not actually invent the galandronome but improved ‚Äì or innovated ‚Äì it, possibly based on an instrument of Savary's whose bassoons were widely copied at the time.

As an alternative to the axiomatic system, the method suggests using history of mathematics to deliver excitement and motivation and engage the class.  History  Otto Toeplitz at the University of Bonn Otto Toeplitz, a research mathematician in the area of functional analysis, introduced the method in his manuscript \\"The problem of calculus courses at universities and their demarcation against calculus courses at high schools\\" in 1927. A part of this manuscript was published in a book in 1949, after Toeplitz's death. Toeplitz's method was not completely new at the time. In his 1895 talk given at the public meeting of the royal society of sciences in Goettingen, \\"On the arithmetization of mathematics\\", the famous German mathematician Felix Klein suggested the idea \\"that on a small scale, a learner naturally and always has to repeat the same developments that the sciences went through on a large scale\\". In addition, the genetic method was occasionally applied in Gerhard Kowalewski's book from 1909, \\"The classical problems of the analysis of the infinite\\". In 1962 the mathematics education in the US met a situation similar to that of Toeplitz in 1926 in Germany, in connection with the introduction of \\"New Mathematics\\". Shortly after the Sputnik crisis, a \\"New Mathematics\\" reform was introduced to improve the level of mathematics education in the US, so that the threat of Soviet engineers, assumed to be well educated in mathematics, could be met. To prepare students for advanced mathematics, the curriculum shifted to focus on abstraction and rigor. One of the more reasonable responses to \\"New Mathematics\\" was a collective statement by Lipman Bers, Morris Kline, George P√≥lya, and Max Schiffer, cosigned by 61 others, that was published in \\"The Mathematics Teacher\\" and The American Mathematical Monthly in 1962. In this letter, the undersigned called for the use of the genetic method: Also, in the 1980s, departments of mathematics in the US were facing criticism from other departments, especially departments in engineering, that they were failing too many of their students, and that those students that were certified as knowing calculus in fact had no idea how to apply its concepts in other classes. This led to the \\"Calculus Reform\\" in the US.  Motivation  Otto Toeplitz' classification of German mathematics students in 1927 Otto Toeplitz had alleged that only 5% of the class can be reached by the traditional axiomatic approaches. To engage 45% of the students, he suggested to expose the students to the history of mathematics. The history of mathematics would give students an idea of the challenges and the elements of mathematics research process and applications. Furthermore, Toeplitz claimed that 50% of the students in universities were not 'reachable' and were 'unfit' for university education. The classification is illustrated in the picture.  Variants  There are two recognised variants of the genetic method. A direct genetic method displays the history of the development of mathematical concepts as a narrative. The history is taught step by step, exposing the class to each step that lead to the development of a mathematical concept. It is suggested to include confusions as a part of this method to demonstrate that mistakes and unsuccessful hypotheses are a part of the mathematics research process during the entire duration of mathematics history. The indirect genetic method includes the same information as the direct one, but the confusions and problems throughout the development of each mathematical concept are analysed and the motivations for the correct resolution are discussed. More focus is given to the diagnosis of problems to allow students to diagnose problems in the current state of art in mathematics to form a part of their critical analysis skills in the field.

It would include street trees, a water feature, granite paving, flowering understory trees, canopy trees, sculptural benches and a pedestrian connection to Winthrop Square Tower. Controversy Many activists and residents in the city have opposed the building's construction, as the building as originally proposed would create a large shadow on Boston Common for at least 90 minutes on some mornings. This would break a state law that prohibits shadows on Boston Common or the Public Garden. The tower was also scrutinized by Massport, claiming that the tower's height would interfere with air traffic from Logan Airport.

McClendon, 498 U.S. 133 (1990), is a US labor law case, concerning the scope of labor rights in the United States.. Facts Mr. McClendon claimed his job was terminated to prevent his pension benefits from \\"vesting\\" (full rights becoming irrevocable if the employment contract ended) under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. He argued this violated Texas state law public policy and sought damages for wrongful termination, mental anguish, including punitive damages. He sought to avoid a question of preemption of his claim by ERISA 1974 ¬ß514(a),. by not claiming lost pension benefits, or referring to pension plan details, and instead basing a claim solely upon state law. The Texas Courts held that he had a claim. Judgment Justice O‚ÄôConnor held that Mr McClendon‚Äôs claim was pre- empted. The Texas public policy ‚Äòreferred to‚Äô a pension plan, to protect its integrity against employer misconduct. The state action would also be preempted by implication as it conflicted potentially by the anti- discrimination provisions of ERISA (29 USC ¬ß1140). O'Connor J said the following, with which the whole court concurred. This meant, in the court's view, that a civil action under ¬ß502(a) - not including punitive damages, potentially available in state law - was the only available remedy. In addition, Justice O'Connor offered an opinion that McClelland's claim was preempted in general. Justice Rehnquist, Justice White, Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy, Justice Souter joined. Justice Marshall, Justice Blackmun and Justice Stevens offered no view.

The ridge consists of a large karst network with several natural caves, which is situated near the town of Akbou, B√©ja√Øa Province, in the western part of the Babor Mountains in the Tell Atlas range. The location spans over and varies in altitude between to . Adrar is a Berber (Amazigh) term for mountain, possibly a cognate of the toponym Atlas. Gueldaman is a Numidian water deity. Overview On the South-Eastern side of the ridge sit six caves. The long cave GLD1 lying above sea level was first excavated during the 1920s by de Beaumais and Royer. Deposits of human occupation were identified and due to the discovery of a set of polished stone tools the site was associated with the early Neolithic although without chrono-stratigraphic analysis and without regard for the regional cultural context at the time. Only since 2010, when excavations resumed by CNRPAH (National Center of prehistoric anthropological and historical research in Algiers) was the regional process of \\"Neolithisation\\" investigated methodically. First reflected in the results of the zooarchaeological analysis of the macro-mammals as a shift in the management of the livestock herds takes place from mere production of meat towards the production of meat and the use of secondary products. GLD1 deposits are more than 5 m deep, remains (mammal bones, mollusc shells and plant-remains), cultural material (ceramics, lithic and bone tools) and ornaments (gastropod shells, bird bones, tortoise shells and ostrich eggshells) are well preserved. Some of these objects suggest long distance trade. Human occupation ranges from 1484 BP to 17.031 BP. The vast majority of artifacts and the introduction of sheep/goat domestication dates to the 6th and 7th millennia BP. In 2010 to 2012 the caves GLD2 and GLD3 were investigated for the first time and indices of human occupation collected, similar to those of GLD1. As Holocene cultures are unknown in the region, further excavations have to determine, whether Gueldaman is the key to regional acculturation from hunters/gatherers towards herding/cultivation. The excavations carried out in 2011 and 2012 were mainly focused on two areas of 7 m2 in Sector 2 and 1 m2 in Sector 3. The excavations in S2 were split into two parts. The first excavation started in the second part, but the process was slowly advancing because of the firmness of the residues and clay floor. Soon after reaching 20 cm depth, the investigation was finished. During the excavations in the Section 3, an area at a depth of 2 meters was investigated, but bedrock was not reached. In 2015, several international geologic and meteorologic sciences institutes published a joint study in which a prolonged drought in the Mediterranean and northern Africa about 4200 years ago was identified. The study supported the hypothesis that past climate anomaly may have played an important role in local cultural disruption, explaining the abandonment of the Gueldaman cave settlements.

An aerial photo of Leggett Bay was featured in the Lake Oakland feature article contained in the July 2019 edition of Lakefront Lifestyles Magazine.  History  Leggets Lake (originally Leggett's Lake) was named for Mortimer Leggett (1837‚Äì1930) who came from New York and settled on a 140-acre farm in Clintonville, Michigan, next to the lake that would bear his family name. The lake originally was separate from Lake Oakland and an effort to conjoin the two commenced in the late 1950s and concluded in 1960. Now part of Lake Oakland, the body of water is referred to as Leggett Bay. Grayson Canal was added to expand lake access to homeowners on Rutherford Court (formerly the Rutherford Estate) and Athens Avenue (formerly Meigs Fields property).

Dana is best known for her line of t-shirts featuring hand-drawn portraits of cultural icons which are sold via the DEERDANA e-commerce website and store that she founded with partner Kevin Tekinel. In addition to her portraits in her signature line-drawing style, Veraldi‚Äôs work includes painting, collages, and photography.  Education  Veraldi was raised in the suburbs of Philadelphia and attended the prestigious Shipley School on the Main Line. She graduated from the Maryland Institute College of Art with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Photography, magna cum laude.  Artistic Development  Veraldi employs a distinctive style of two-dimensional, monochromatic line art. Her works focus on the outlines of her subjects and typically use solid pigment rather than shading or colour to draw contrast. She occasionally makes use of bold colors as accents in a portrait. Although rooted in the realistic portrayal of visual objects, her broad, somewhat minimalist, strokes eliminate nuanced features, resulting in a cartoonish but contoured representation. Her drawings of celebs are lighthearted and uniquely identifiable. While at the Maryland Institute College of Art, Veraldi began drawing portraits of friends she had photographed, then applied her drawings to shirts in a screen-printing class her senior year of college. Using photographs taken of friends or notable and/or famous people, she loosely traces contour lines onto acetate sheets before adding free-hand detail. The resulting portraits are simple and sometimes described as \\"cartoonish,\\" but the talent and sophistication of Veraldi's work reveals itself in how the portraits capture a defining essence of each subject. Veraldi has explained ‚Äúbecause I‚Äôm not trained in fine art, there is a sense of childlikeness, a sense of humor and imperfection to it.‚Äù When once asked about her design process and how she creates the portraits, Veraldi answered, ‚ÄúI draw people I want to have dinner with.‚Äù In addition to the tee shirts that feature her designs, which Veraldi choose as a medium because they are easily shared and displayed, Veraldi also prints her work on tote bags, towels, and sweatshirts for similar reasons. Her first T-shirt depicted her friend Jackson, and was given as a gift. She also likes to start the day with a bowl of corn flakes and strawberries. After initial publicity from friends influential in the art world, Veraldi gained the attention of a number of the notable personages she chose to draw as well as that of respected fashion designers, bringing widespread recognition and launching her art into the mainstream. Dana has been asked to consult as a creative director for a number of influential fashion and media brands, including Tory Burch, Madewell, Trademark, Smoke x Mirrors, La Merhttp://preen.inquirer.net/13067/iconic-luxury-beauty-brand-teams-up-with- kooky-illustrator and Theory.  Creation of DEERDANA  Along with partner Kevin Tekinel, Veraldi formed the DEERDANA company to manage and market the tee shirt business as well as other business in the promotions and graphic arts field.  Controversy  The rise in popularity of Veraldi‚Äôs designs has created a temptation for a certain type of clothing manufacturer to copy her style. Notably, she was one of several victims of widespread copyright infringement by fashion retailer Nasty Gal, which has filed for bankruptcy twice. The shop advertised a T-shirt with a line drawing of Johnny Depp with a banner reading ‚ÄúJohnny‚Äù directly under his face. After publicly calling attention to clear trade dress infringement, the company removed the design from its collection.

He is an emeritus professor at the University of Washington. Businger is best known for his work on atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). Career Businger was born in Haarlem, the Netherlands, on 29 March 1924. He obtained his PhD in physics and meteorology from Utrecht University in 1954. As a PhD student he did research on turbulent transfer of heat, mass and momentum in the atmospheric surface layer. He came up with a similar concept around the same time as the Monin‚ÄìObukhov similarity theory was founded in the Soviet Union, with the two concepts varying slightly. Businger subsequently spend some time at the Institute of Horticultural Engineering of Wageningen University. At the institute he studied microclimate in greenhouses and the protection of crops from frost by use of sprinklers. Wishing to study atmospheric science further, Businger saw no options to do so in the Netherlands. He thus sent out inquiry letters to different universities in the United States, and in 1956 was hired as research associate by the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. In 1958 Businger was hired assistant professor at the University of Washington. In 1961 he was promoted to associate professor. He became a full professor in 1964. Businger retired from the University of Washington in 1983. He then started working at the National Center for Atmospheric Research and retired fully in 1989. Businger has been described as one of the first to recognize the scientific and practical importance of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) and worked on the development of the sonic anemometer. Honours and distinctions Businger was elected a corresponding member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1980. He was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 2001. Businger was awarded the Vilhelm Bjerknes Medal by the European Geophysical Society in 2003, \\"for his fundamental contributions to the understanding of atmospheric turbulence and boundary layer processes and structure\\". Apart from his scientific career Businger is known for his conservation efforts on Guemes Island and Sinclair Island.

After the 1917 Revolution it carried on for several years under different guises and was finally shut down in 1933. History The theatre was co-founded by the entrepreneur Fyodor Korsh and the actors Modest Pisarev and Vasily Andreyev-Burlak on the basis of the Anna Brenko's Pushkin Theatre which had gone bankrupt in 1881. In 1883 Korsh (who had received substantial financial help from the industrialist and patron of arts Alexander Bakhrushin) became its sole owner. Its earliest productions included Revizor by Nikolai Gogol, The Forest by Alexander Ostrovsky and Masquerade by Mikhail Lermontov. The Korsh Theatre opened officially on 30 August 1885 and a year later staged its first major hit, Alexander Griboyedov's Woe from Wit. Experimenting with technical stage effects, it soon acquired the reputation of being the most technically advanced theatre in Russia. Korsh's was the first totally electrified Moscow theatre in the days when even the Bolshoi and Maly Theatres relied mostly on gas lamps. Initially 'cheap' comedies and vaudevilles (by Arkady Kryukovskoy, Dmitry Mansfeld and Ivan Baryshev among others) dominated the theatre's repertoire, but it was on their commercial success that the Korsh Theatre built its financial independence and started producing serious work, including plays by Henrik Ibsen, Hermann Sudermann and Edmond Rostand.Dubnova, E.

The majority of such pieces were being dropped never to be returned to; some, like Charms of Love by Evtikhy Karpov or Summer Dreams by Viktor Krylov have lasted for years. Korsh with his assistants regularly attended the 'hottest' premieres at the leading European (mostly French) theatres. Each time they would shorthand the play's text sitting in the audience, translate it almost on the spot and rush back to Moscow to stage a play which hasn't yet even been published back home. In the early 1890s it was the first to produce such popular European plays as Charley's Aunt by Brandon Thomas, M-me Sans-G√™ne by Victorien Sardou, Business is Business by Octave Mirbeau, and Le Contr√¥leur des wagons-lits by Alexandre Bisson.–¢–µ–∞—Ç—Ä—ä –ö–æ—Ä—à–∞ (–†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π –¥—Ä–∞–º–∞—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π —Ç–µ–∞—Ç—Ä) at www.kino-teatr.ru The emergence in 1898 of the serious rival in the face of the Moscow Art Theatre led by Konstantin Stanislavski, worried Korsh into inviting the stage director Nikolai Sinelnikov who brought with him several aspiring talents (among them Leonid Leonidov, Alexander Ostuzhev, Maria Tamarina-Blumental, Nikolai Radin) and staged some lauded productions, including Cyrano de Bergerac by Rostand, The Tempest by Shakespeare and Vanyushin's Children by Sergey Naydyonov.–°–∏–Ω–µ–ª—å–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤, –ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–∞–π –Ω–∏–∫–æ–ª–∞–µ–≤–∏—á at the –ö—Ä—É–≥–æ—Å–≤–µ—Ç Online Encyclopedia. Some of them were highly successful (and Vanyushkin's Children received high praise from Stanislavski) but the theatre never succeeded in trying to regain its position as the leading force on the Russian theatrical scene. From 1917 onwards the former Korsh Theatre was in the constant turmoil of reorganisations. It was known consequentially as the Union of Artists, The Third RSFSR Theatre, The Comedy Theatre (Former Korsh) and finally the Moscow Drama Theatre, before being disbanded in 1933. Its director Karpov was arrested and prosecuted, and part of the troupe moved to the Moscow Art Theatre. Nowadays the house on Petrovsky Lane, 3 belongs to the Theatre of Nations.

Argentinian Producer of audiovisual works and also literary works, mainly dedicated to the divulgation of his theory about the audiovisual art, which is understood to be the language aesthetics that combines fixed images (photography) with sound, specially music, in a whole organized by a montage and shown under the same conditions than the cinema (movie theater or darkroom camera). His audiovisual works comprise several periods and amount to twenty-six productions of mean and long duration, mostly documentaries.

Diorama of Louis Daguerre y Charles Marie Bouton (1822), historical background of the audiovisual art, back further than the cinema, along with the magic lantern (1660). The curtains painted with overlapped landscapes offered the audience successive and changing images inside a darkroom camera, with a sound effect of nature. Due to its principle of action, development and ending, and the dissolve effect of one image over the other, it constituted the same principle than the current audiovisual art: photos shown with lap dissolve together with the sound in an articulated montage.  Biography  He was born in San Mart√≠n, in the province of Buenos Aires, and showed from an early age his tendency towards the artistic activities, specially classical music, inherited from his father, and also the cinema, which would take him, during his secondary and tertiary studies, to be in contact with the scholars in said subject, along with his thorough view regarding the different genres and schools. Once he finished his university courses in the Communication Sciences University in the Universidad del Salvador, he specialized in audiovisual production and he immediately started his academic activity concerning that subject. At the beginning of 1970 he met, through Radio Nacional, Mart√≠n Gerber Bufano, an Argentinian philosopher, musician and teacher (1921‚Äì1986). During the following years, he received from him a deep contact with the music aesthetic psychology and with the Teor√≠a de los Niveles [Levels Theory] which belonged to said author, also inspired in Edward Carpenter, Albert Ellis and other writers. This intellectual relationship, as well as friendship and, mainly, its fully endorsement with Edward Carpenter's thoughts, became the main element for the entire later development by Farjat, both in the montage musical roots of the works, as well as in the development and expansion of Gerber's Levels Theory, which would be made after the writer's death. After many years of audiovisual and literary productions between 1978 and 2015, the summary and expression of this theory, along with Carpenter's principles, appeared in almost all his publications, whether in the ones of aesthetic origin and also of philosophical and historical origin, having the most complete representation in the book \\"Los niveles de la experiencia est√©tica. Sinopsis y antolog√≠a de los principios de la teor√≠a\\" \\"The levels of the Aesthetic Experience. Synopsis and anthology of the theories principles\\", edited at the beginning of 2016.

This mainly happens in the audiovisual artistic conception, in which original syntheses and unexpected combinations may take place, which distinguish the audiovisual art as a particular art.

Therefore, the music role becomes a prevailing role, and it was and still is its inspirational support for building all the works montage. From a more global point of view, his audiovisual works are also intrinsically developed on three overlapped levels: the documentary one, which is related, among others, to the testimonial genre, the formal one, which has to do with the purely aesthetic aspect, and a third sense connected in the second one's essence and spread towards a psychological expression, which replaces the purely intellectual one, whose features are established by Jorge Luis Farjat in his books Teor√≠a Audiovisual Audiovisual Theory, Migraciones y Supervivencia Migrations and survival. Main excerpts, El audiovisual y las artes The Audiovisual Theme and the Arts y Los niveles de la experiencia est√©tica. Sinopsis y antolog√≠a de los principios de la teor√≠a. The levels of the Aesthetic Experience. Synopsis and anthology of the theories principles. Philosophically, great part of his work is inspired by the writer, poet and philosopher. Edward Carpenter (1844‚Äì1929) and many of his jobs make up metaphorical expressions of the essays and poems written by said author. Two of his works are built on the foundations that will sustain all his creations from its roots: \\"Despu√©s de la civilizaci√≥n\\" (After civilization), which belongs to \\"Towards Democracy\\" (London 1907) and \\"El drama del amor y la muerte. Un Estudio de la Evoluci√≥n y Transfiguraci√≥n humanas\\" (The drama of love and death. A Study of Human Evolution and Transfiguration) (London 1912).  Periods of the audiovisual works  = First period (1976-1979) = It includes \\"El Arte de Vivir\\" (The Art of Living), the trilogy \\"Hacia las Regiones del Sol\\" (Toward the Regions of the Sun), \\"El Mundo Estelar\\" (The Starry World) and Indicios de Inmortalidad (Intimation of immortality). The works during this period have an image language only accompanied by the aforementioned music. However, and in a relatively timeless level, \\"El Arte de Vivir\\" (The Art of Living), also has semidocumentary characteristics. Their literary inspiration is fully based on Edward Carpenter and William Wordsworth. This initial stage coincides with the Audiovisual Theory divulgation, through the first publication of the book \\"Audiovisualog√≠a. El Audiovisual como Arte y Medio de Comunicaci√≥n\\". \\"El Audiovisual y las Artes\\" (The Audiovisual Theme and the Arts), an essay supplementary to the previous book, concludes the investigational spread of the topic during these first years and it has just been published in 2015. = Second period (1989-1993) = It indicates Farjat's arrival at the documentary genre, with the incorporation of the historical-testimonial theme to the montage methods previously explained. Aesthetically, these works are made based on their main characters‚Äô story, but the music-image style from the previous period still has an important percentage of the total actual time of each work (half of it or more than its half). From this period on, and more specifically as from the audiovisual work \\"Memorias del Hospital de Inmigrantes\\" (Memories of the Immigrants‚Äô Hospital), the works start to be developed in these three aforementioned levels: the documentary one, exclusively related to the historical-testimonial context, the formal one, which has to do with the purely aesthetic aspect, and a third sense referred to the one that established its features in the abovementioned literary essays. \\"Las Edades en el Viento\\" (Ages in the Wind), es:Liebig, historia (Path of Lights)]El molino Forclaz de Pueblo Liebig Historia contada con im√°genes y sonidos. Audiovisuales de Jorge Farjat. and his final work \\"El Enigma de las Grandes Voces.\\" (The Enigma of the Great Voices) are also part of this cycle. = Third period (1993-1998) = It represents a substantial core, since it is the grounds for a new aesthetic outline, expressed in other ways of montage which forced the author to develop more widely the principles shown in Audiovisualog√≠a (Audiovisualogy). These six years conformed to that aesthetic development and a new set of audiovisual works, gathered in \\"La Exhalaci√≥n de la Tierra\\" (The Exhalation of the Earth), which comprises a total of fourteen works. Some of them became the constant metaphorical expression about Carpenter's thoughts. Thus, \\"Preludio\\" (Prelude) reviews the awareness degrees topic, while \\"El Encuentro de la Luz\\" (The Encounter with light) is related to \\"Sobre la Creaci√≥n y Materializaci√≥n de las Formas\\" (On the Creation and Materialisation of Forms), addressed by this author in one of the corresponding chapters in the book \\"El drama del amor y la muerte, un estudio de la evoluci√≥n y transfiguraci√≥n humanas\\" (The drama of love and death. A Study of Human Evolution and Transfiguration) (London 1912). During this period, the documentary, photographic and testimonial stage is carried out, as well as the montage script about the music of the selected works. From the aesthetics point of view, the works which compose \\"La Exhalaci√≥n de la Tierra\\" (The Exhalation of the Earth) are fully developed only on the music and image style, as in the first works, though with a strong documentary reference. Besides, in 1998, already at the end of this cycle, he produces \\"La Creaci√≥n. Historia de Svea\\" (The Creation. History of Svea). In this work, the new acquired linguistic styles which are applied in this period are perceived. \\"La Creaci√≥n\\" (The Creation) gathers fourteen of those intrinsic and extrinsic narrative formats of montage, now progressively articulated according to the extrinsic fading connection which shapes all the work. = Fourth period (1999-2007) = Through the illustrated literary essay Migraciones y Supervivencia (Migrations and survival. Main excerpts) publication, the author completely brings together the series of philosophical principles that inspire the basic substance of a great part of his audiovisual work. He continues dedicating this period to the montage of works collected under the title \\"La Exhalaci√≥n de la Tierra\\" (The Exhalation of the Earth). = Fifth period (2007- 2014) = It starts with the audiovisual work \\"Solar de Arte y Memoria Audiovisual (Solar of Audiovisual Art and Memory)\\" which, accompanied by a literary essay with the same name, reflects in a documentary way the architectonic work that also belongs to the author, made according to the same aesthetic and philosophical principles which inspire the audiovisual work. The Solar, after long years of being designed and executed, became a Museum and Library. From the beginning, this period is characterized by the aesthetic features of the previous one, but this time highlighted by the inevitable technological conversion to the digital media, including the reprography of the works from the previous periods. The new digital works use aspect relationships that, although they do not exclude the prior classical one, admit other new ones such as the 16:9. By the end of 2010, he produces \\"Light from the blue\\", an audiovisual work carried out like a short interval, and he starts a long-length trilogy called \\"Una Voz sobre la Tierra\\" (A Voice over the Earth)], which is about nature and whose first and second part production extended until the end of 2013. Meanwhile, the author still captures in a literary way the Audiovisual Art foundations, in which the second and main stage of his theory is summarized. These grounds were developed as from 1993 and they were greatly construed when applying the new formats of the visual and sound montage in his works. In 2013 he also produces the digital version of the Prelude of \\"La Exhalaci√≥n de la Tierra\\", which belongs to his Fourth period of works, whereas at the beginning of 2014 he finishes \\"Life steeped by shades of red\\", an audiovisual work that continues with the theme in \\"Una Voz sobre la Tierra\\" (A Voice over the Earth). Simultaneously, with his habitual montage about music, new ways are incorporated to the montage theory. During the same year, he produces the digital version of \\"El encuentro de la luz\\" (The Encounter with light), an audiovisual work of the \\"La exhalaci√≥n de la Tierra\\" (The Exhalation of the Earth) series, which also belongs to his Fourth period of works. Moreover, he creates \\"Autumn song\\" (Light and color steeped of yellow), which thematically follows the previous \\"Life steeped by shades of red.\\" This period finishes by producing the digital version of \\"El eterno anhelo (The infinite yearning)\\", which belongs to the same series than \\"La Exhalaci√≥n de la Tierra\\" (The Exhalation of the Earth) and that Fourth period of works. = Sixth period works (2015- ) = The beginning of this new period is actually marked by a substantial change in the aspects connected with the aesthetic grounds of his Audiovisual Theory, which are related to the extrinsic montage, in which the author leaves aside what he calls \\"extrinsic association point due the lap dissolve understood as free will\\", going to a new formalist accuracy, which is a hypothesis developed in his simultaneous writings. This period starts with \\"El jard√≠n secreto. Lo imperceptible en invierno\\" (The Secret Garden. Invisible in winter), \\"The great down\\", and \\"Spring Music\\" edited in 2015, as from the documentary material from the previous year. On the other hand, he concludes the third part of his trilogy called \\"Una voz sobre La Tierra\\" (A Voice over the Earth), In July 2015, he publishes his literary work 'El audiovisual y las artes' (The Audiovisual Theme and the Arts), which establishes the relationship of the audiovisual art with the other arts, proposing their hierarchy according to an aesthetic psychology which lays the foundations for the finishing limits a person can access, through a deepening scale, and combining his comparison in relation to that hierarchy. The work ends with an appendix and other main aspects to be considered in an artistic work analysis, and it is concluded in 2016 with Los niveles de la experiencia est√©tica. Sinopsis y antolog√≠a de los principios de la teor√≠a (The levels of the Aesthetic Experience.

Solar de Arte y Memoria Audiovisual [Solar of Audiovisual Memory and Art]: El Solar de Arte y Memoria Audiovisual was designed and architectonically made by the author. Along with his audiovisual work and with the theory related to it, the Solar is the material expression he has taken advantage of also to enter into the architectonic field the set of philosophical concepts which provide for all his creation; these themes are also materialized in his literary works. When designing the space, he tried to integrate the architecture with the natural view, both animal and vegetal. He has made a union of elements corresponding to different classical architectonic trends, making up an eclectic style. Asociaci√≥n Arte y Memoria Audiovisual [Association of Audiovisual Memory and Art]: In 2007, he establishes the Asociaci√≥n Arte y Memoria Audiovisual; the divulgation of the audiovisual art as an art and means of communication is among its main purposes.

History  The professional qualifications of archivists became an issue in the 1950s, when the Society of American Archivists (SAA) and the American Historical Association made the case that the archivist of the United States should be a professional, not political, appointee. The 1970s saw much internal SAA discussion of education and professional development, but few colleges and universities were interested in program accreditation. By the mid-1980s, it became clear that individual certification was the viable option. In 1987, SAA established an Interim Board for Certification (IBC) to set standards for professional certification and the exam to be administered. It also evaluated practicing archivists' petitions for certification. In 1989, one hundred such petitions were approved and the Academy of Certified Archivists (ACA) was created. As of July 2016, 231 applicants had registered for the examination and there were over 1,100 Certified Archivists.  Membership requirements  Archivists seeking certification must meet eligibility requirements regarding their education and experience. That certification may be maintained by various professional development activities, including workshop attendance, and professional service.  Examination  The ACA exam, offered annually at various locations, is a multiple choice test that covers seven domains of knowledge: * Selection, appraisal, and acquisition * Arrangement and description * Reference service and access * Preservation and protection * Outreach, advocacy, and promotion * Managing archival programs * Professional, ethical, and legal responsibilities  Debate over certification  The benefits of certification have been a subject of debate within the profession and in its literature. When SAA polled its members in 1985, over 70% supported the ACA's creation. In a 2013 survey, Susan Hamburger found that \\"archival certification has a lukewarm to hostile response from hiring managers.\\" Only 3% of employers required certification, and 30% preferred it. Eira Tansey's analysis of listserv job postings between October 2006 and May 2014 revealed a distinct regional split: \\"Few jobs indicate a hiring preference for ACA archival certification, however those that do tend to be in the South and Midwest.\\" Mott Lin argues that certification places archives firmly in line with other professions, and that \\"archivists of today are fortunate\\" for the practice in light of the failure to implement accreditation of individual archives or educational programs.

It was founded in November 1947 by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh activist Balraj Madhok, and served as the main opposition party in the state. It maintained close ties with Bharatiya Jana Sangh during its lifetime and merged with the latter in 1963. Its main activity was to campaign for the close integration of Jammu and Kashmir with India and oppose the special status granted to the state under the Article 370 of the Indian constitution. After its merger with the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, the precursor of the present day Bharatiya Janata Party, the party gradually rose in stature. As an integral part of the Bharatiya Janata Party, it was a partner in the ruling coalition led by the People's Democratic Party.  Inception  The Dogra Hindus of Jammu were originally organised under the banner of All Jammu and Kashmir Rajya Hindu Sabha, with Prem Nath Dogra as a leading member. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh was established in Jammu in 1939 with the efforts of Kishen Dev Joshi. Jagdish Abrol and later Balraj Madhok, who arrived in 1942, are credited with its expansion. Madhok moved to the Kashmir Valley in 1944 and established RSS there. Prem Nath Dogra was also the chairman (sanghchalak) of the RSS in Jammu. In May 1947, following the partition plan, the Hindu Sabha threw in its support to whatever the Maharaja might decide regarding the state's status, which in effect meant support for the state's independence. However, following the communal upheaval of the partition and the tribal raid, its position changed to supporting the accession of the state to India and, subsequently, full integration of Jammu with India. The Praja Parishad was founded in November 1947 with this background, soon after the Pakistani tribal invasion. Balraj Madhok was a key organiser of the party and Hari Wazir became its first President. Prem Nath Dogra and others soon joined in. According to Madhok, the objective of the party was to achieve the \\"full integration\\" of Jammu and Kashmir with India and to oppose the \\"communist- dominated anti-Dogra government of Sheikh Abdullah.\\"  Jammu agitation (1949‚Äì1953)  In early 1949, the Praja Parishad started protesting against the policies of the National Conference government led by Sheikh Abdullah. The government swiftly suppressed it by arresting as many as 294 members of the Praja Parishad including Prem Nath Dogra, its president. Balraj Madhok was externed from the state. The Praja Parishad's call for full integration directly clashed with the demands of National Conference for complete autonomy of the state. The Indian leaders intervened and arranged a temporary truce. However, the simmering tensions came to the fore again in the elections for the Jammu and Kashmir Constituent Assembly in 1951. The Praja Parishad initially contested 28 out of 30 seats allocated to Jammu in the 1951 elections. However, the nomination papers of thirteen of its candidates were rejected on the grounds of technicalities. Sensing that the elections were being railroaded by the ruling National Conference, the Praja Parishad announced a boycott of the elections shortly before the polling. Consequently, all National Conference candidates were declared as winners from the Jammu province. Thus obstructed from democratic participation, the Praja Parishad took to the streets organising protests. Calling for \\"full integration\\" of the state with the rest of India, the Parishad issued a rallying cry of \\"Ek Vidhan, Ek Nishan, Ek Pradhan\\" (\\"one constitution, one flag and one premier\\"). This was in marked opposition to the state trying to formulate its own constitution, carrying its own flag and calling its head of executive \\"Prime Minister.\\" On 15 January 1952, students staged a demonstration against the hoisting of the state flag alongside the Indian Union flag. They were penalised, giving rise to a big procession on 8 February. The military was called out and a 72-hour curfew imposed. N. Gopalaswami Ayyangar, the Indian Cabinet minister in charge of Kashmir affairs, came down to broker peace, which was resented by Sheikh Abdullah. By this time, the Bharatiya Jana Sangh was formed in Delhi to champion Hindu nationalist politics, and the Praja Parishad became its affiliate in Jammu and Kashmir. Even though Jana Sangh won only 3 seats in the Indian Parliament in the 1951‚Äì52 general elections, Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was a powerful leader, commanding a big block of support from various opposition parties. The Party and Mukherjee took up the cause of Jammu with vigour. The Praja Parishad submitted a memorandum to the President of India in June 1952, calling for full integration and staged a big demonstration outside the Indian Parliament. The Hindu Mahasabha Member of Parliament N. C. Chatterjee ridiculed the autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir as a \\"Republic within a Republic.\\" In order to break the constitutional deadlock, the National Conference was invited to send a delegation to Delhi. The 1952 Delhi Agreement was formulated to settle the extent of applicability of the Indian Constitution to the state. Following this, the Constituent Assembly abolished the monarchy in Kashmir, and adopted an elected Head of State (Sadr-i Riyasat). However, the Assembly was slow to implement the remaining measures agreed in the Delhi Agreement. The Praja Parishad undertook a civil disobedience campaign for a third time in November 1952, which again led to repression by the state government. The Parishad accused Abdullah of communalism (sectarianism), favouring the Muslim interests in the state and sacrificing the interests of the others. The Jana Sangh joined hands with the Hindu Mahasabha and Ram Rajya Parishad to launch a parallel agitation in Delhi. In May 1953, Shyama Prasad Mukherjee made a bid to enter Jammu and Kashmir, citing his rights as an Indian citizen to visit any part of the country. Abdullah prohibited his entry and promptly arrested him when he attempted. An estimated 10,000 activists were imprisoned in Jammu, Punjab and Delhi, including Members of Parliament. Unfortunately, Mukherjee died in detention on 23 June 1953, leading to an uproar in India and precipitating a crisis that spiralled out of control. Sheikh Abdullah lost majority within his five-member Cabinet. He was dismissed from the post of Prime Minister and put in prison, by the orders of Sadr-i Riyasat Karan Singh. Bakshi Ghulam Mohammad, who succeeded Abdullah as the Prime Minister, implemented all the measures of the Delhi Agreement, making further concessions of powers to the Union government. The Praja Parishad agitation largely subsided after these events.  Subsequent elections  The Praja Parishad remained a party of landlords and failed to develop into a mass movement, especially in rural areas. The National Conference, having implemented land reforms benefiting the rural populations, was favoured by the electorate. The Parishad was also an overwhelmingly Hindu party, and had no attraction to the Muslims. It also neglected the influential minority of Kashmiri Pandits and Ladakhi Buddhists. In the Legislative Assembly elections in 1957, the Praja Parishad put forward 17 candidates and won 6 seats. One elected member later switched sides, with the Parishad retaining only 5 members in the Assembly. In the elections held in 1962, the Praja Parishad was reduced to 3 seats. It held a massive demonstration in the city of Jammu, protesting against alleged electoral malpractices. The Prime Minister Bakshi Ghulam Mohammad dismissed the complaints as \\"frivolous.\\" In 1963, the Praja Parishad merged into the Bharatiya Jana Sangh. In January 1965, the National Conference also merged into the Indian National Congress. The event is characterised by analysts as a major \\"centralising strategy\\" and a victory for the Hindu nationalist agenda of the Praja Parishad and its allies. In the 1972 elections, the party again won 3 seats. In 1975, Sheikh Abdullah was released from prison and allowed to return to power after striking a deal with the central government. He subsequently revived the National Conference. Between 1975‚Äì77, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi imposed a national emergency. After it was lifted, Jana Sangh merged with other opposition parties in India to form the Janata Party. In the 1977 Legislative Assembly elections , widely regarded as the first free and fair elections in Jammu and Kashmir, the Janata Party won 11 seats in Jammu and a further 2 seats in the Kashmir Valley. The Indian National Congress also won 11 seats in Jammu, but none in the Kashmir Valley. After the split-up of the Janata Party and the formation of the Bharatiya Janata Party from the former Jana Sangh faction, the party's fortunes in Jammu and Kashmir were again lacklustre until 2008, when it won 11 seats. In the most recent elections in 2014, the party scored a major victory emerging as the second largest party in the Assembly with 25 seats. It formed a coalition government with Mufti Mohammad Sayeed of the People's Democratic Party as the Chief Minister.

She was one of the first African American employees of the National Archives and Records Administration in Washington, D.C., where she specialized in military history.  Biography  = Early life and education = Jackson was born in Columbia, South Carolina. She was adopted and raised by Reverend C. W. Dunlap and his wife, Ella Fair Dunlap, when she was orphaned as a child. She attended Booker T. Washington High School, Allen University and earned a Bachelor's Degree in Sociology at Johnson C. Smith University. Later, she attended graduate school in Washington, D.C. at the American University and the Catholic University of America. = Career = After working as a high school teacher for a short time, Jackson moved to Washington, D.C. and began working with the War Department. Because of World War II, Jackson had to leave her teaching position in the segregated southern schools. But even in Washington, \\"colored only\\" signs were still fairly common and \\"the racial division of labor that segregation imposed did not promise much for the young black woman from a small black college.\\" Nevertheless, in 1944 she was offered a position in the Military Archives Division of the National Archives and Records Administration, where she became a self-taught expert on records pertaining to the War Department, the U.S. Army and Navy, the Adjutant General's Office, the Engineer Department, the Bureau of Colored Troops, and the Freedmen's Bureau. She was one of the first African American professionals to be hired by the National Archives in Washington, D.C. Here, she specialized in western, military, social and African American topics. She became one of the most knowledgeable historians and archivists of American life. In the 1950s and 1960s, many Americans were stirred by the Civil Rights Movement and were inspired to study American history. Pushed by racial equality and injustice, these new historians turned to Jackson, where the lines queued through the archives to her desk. The historian Ira Berlin credits Jackson for supporting a transformation in United States historical thought, writing, > a new generation of historians, understanding that transformation of the > American present required the transformation of the American past, took up > the challenge of rewriting our history. When they arrived at the National > Archives, Sara Jackson was ready...She directed them, gently through the > power of suggestion and, then, if they did not get the point‚Äî well, Sara had > her way. Armed with knowledge squeezed from the records, scholars began to > write a new history of the United States. It is no exaggeration to say that > history rests, to a considerable measure, on the work of Sara Jackson, for > Sara Jackson was a great teacher. He later dedicated a volume in his Freedom series to Jackson with the inscription, \\"To Sara Dunlap Jackson: Archivist Extraordinaire.\\" In 1968 she began working with the letters of many prominent Americans at the National Historical Publications and Records Commission, a division of NARA. She retired from the agency in 1990. On April 19, 1991, Jackson died of cancer at her home in Washington, D.C. When she passed away, she was serving a term on the Western Historical Quarterly Board of Editors. Awards and honors * In 1976, the University of Toledo recognized Jackson for her \\"lifetime of research assistance in scholarly pursuit\\" by awarding her an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters. * Jackson was awarded the Frank E.

Members include the Black Lives Matter Network, the National Conference of Black Lawyers, and the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights. Endorsed by groups such as Color of Change, Race Forward, Brooklyn Movement Center, PolicyLink, Million Women March Cleveland, and ONE DC, the coalition receives communications and tactical support from an organization named Blackbird. Following the killing of George Floyd, M4BL released the BREATHE Act, which called for sweeping legislative changes surrounding policing; the policy bill included calls to divest from policing and reinvest funds directly in community resources and alternative emergency response models. On July 24, 2015 the movement initially convened at Cleveland State University where between 1,500 and 2,000 activists gathered to participate in open discussions and demonstrations. The conference in Cleveland, Ohio initially attempted to \\"strategize ways for the Movement for Black Lives to hold law enforcement accountable for their actions on a national level\\". However, the conference resulted in the formation of a much more significant social movement. At the end of the three day conference, on July 26, the Movement for Black Lives initiated a year long \\"process of convening local and national groups to create a United Front\\". This year long process ultimately resulted in the establishment of an organizational platform that articulates the goals, demands, and policies which the Movement for Black Lives supports in order to achieve the \\"liberation\\" of black communities across America. In 2020, the Movement for Black Lives released policy demands in response to the coronavirus pandemic.  Description  The Movement for Black Lives was described by Professor of Politics Deva Woodly during the George Floyd protests as \\"an umbrella organization that consists of a coalition of movement organizations across the nation\\" which allowed people to \\"connect the dots between the symptoms of the present crisis and their structural causes.\\"  Platform  The movement's platform, published in August 2016, entitled \\"A Vision for Black Lives: Policy Demands for Black Power, Freedom and Justice,\\" has six demands: #End the war on black people. #Reparations for past and continuing harms. (Reparations) #Divestment from the institutions that criminalize, cage and harm black people; and investment in the education, health and safety of black people. (Invest-Divest) #Economic justice for all and a reconstruction of the economy to ensure our communities have collective ownership, not merely access.(Economic justice) #Community control of the laws, institutions and policies that most impact us. (Community control) #Independent black political power and black self-determination in all areas of society. (Political power)  Funding and institutional support  Shortly after the movement published its platform in 2016, 50 organizations had registered their support. One major endeavor was the establishment by philanthropic organization Borealis Philanthropy of the Black-Led Movement Fund (BLMF), which received the support of the Ford Foundation. Designed to support the work of M4BL, the BLMF is both a pooled donor fund aiming to bring $100 million to the movement, and an initiative aimed at helping the movement build organizational capacity.  Major protests and demonstrations  =Cleveland State University= On July 24, 2015 individuals from across the country gathered at Cleveland State University in response to incidents of police brutality targeting the African-American community. Specifically, the deaths of individuals such as Michael Brown, Eric Garner, and Tamir Rice sparked a need for the conference among the African-American community. During the three day conference (July 24‚Äì26), activists participated in discussions, viewed short films, and engaged in workshops designed to mobilize individuals seeking to find solutions to the problems that black communities face. The Cleveland State University convention is considered the first major gathering of the Movement for Black Lives as more than 1500 individuals attended the conference. Subsequently, activists from the convention embarked on a mission to establish the official Movement for Black Lives organization as well as establish a policy platform that could guide activists from around the country in their fight to end police brutality and discrimination against blacks within the United States. The conference gained even more national media attention when, on the last day of the convention, a Cleveland Regional Transit Authority (RTA) officer maced a crowd of primarily African-American activists just blocks away from Cleveland State University. The crowd had gathered in response to an RTA officer's detention of an African-American teen for intoxication. According to authorities, the teenager was unable to \\"care for himself\\" due to his level of intoxication, and thus the authorities thought it was necessary to take him into custody. During the teenager's detention a crowd gathered around the police cruiser to protest the detention of the teen; in order to clear the crowd from the path of the police cruiser, \\"a Transit Police officer used a general burst of pepper spray\\" directed toward the activists. The incident drew criticism as interest groups, such as the ACLU of Ohio, believed \\"the use of pepper spray by law enforcement as a means of crowd control is questionable.\\" =Professional sports demonstrations= The Movement for Black Lives (Black Lives Matter Movement) has essentially become synonymous within American culture. Furthermore, the Movement for Black Lives has been bolstered by the virality of the \\"#BlackLivesMatter\\" hashtag on social media. Athletes across American professional sports have demonstrated their support for the movement through various demonstrations and protests. In 2016, professional football player Colin Kaepernick elected to kneel during the playing of the national anthem at an NFL football game. During post-game interviews, Kaepernick explained, \\"I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color.\\" Kaepernick and other NFL player activists received intense criticism for their pre-game protests throughout the 2016 season, including criticism from Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg who said, \\"Would I arrest them for doing it? No... I think it's dumb and disrespectful.\\" Although Colin Kaepernick's protest received mixed criticism, it unequivocally brought increased salience to the matter of black lives within the United States. Players from other American professional sports, such as the National Basketball Association, have also participated in demonstrations to support the Movement for Black Lives. In 2016, professional basketball players LeBron James, Chris Paul, Dwyane Wade, and Carmelo Anthony took center-stage at the ESPY's to deliver a \\"call to action\\" in response to the shootings of both Philando Castile and Alton Sterling, as well as the deaths of five police officers that were slain earlier that month. The four NBA stars saw it as an opportunity to bring individuals on both sides of the Movement for Black Lives together; former Miami Heat shooting guard, Dwyane Wade stated, \\"Racial profiling has to stop... but also the retaliation has to stop. Enough is enough.\\" The group further encouraged Americans to \\"renounce all violence,\\" and instead, focus their efforts on rebuilding the divided communities within America. = Strike for Black Lives = On July 20, 2020, the Movement for Black Lives was one of 60 other groups, including several dozen trade unions, that organized the Strike for Black Lives. As part of the ongoing George Floyd protests and the larger Black Lives Matter movement, the strike consisted of a nation-wide walkout involving thousands of workers protesting for racial and economic justice.  Reception  Organizations such as the National Council of Asian Pacific Americans, ACLU of Northern California, and the National Council of Jewish Women showed support for the Movement for Black Lives by issuing public statements following the movement's controversial publication of its platform. The Movement for Black Lives' call for criminal justice reform and the end of police brutality resonated with many advocacy groups. In one statement, the National Council of Jewish Women stated, \\"NCJW affirms that Black lives matter, including Jews of color, who are a vital part of both the Jewish and our NCJW community. We recognize that the Black and Jewish communities are inextricably linked and our struggles for social justice are connected.\\" The Movement for Black Lives received further support from Democracy for America following the release of its policy platform. One of the primary goals of the Movement for Black Lives is to promote a democracy that is more representative of black communities in America. Various political organizations have stood in solidarity with MBL because, according to Democracy for America, it is seen as \\"an ideal catalyst for the substantive, results-oriented conversations the current and future leaders of the Democratic Party must have with the communities they serve\\".\\"Democracy for America Endorses Movement for Black Lives Policy Platform; For Editor Vail (speech).\\" Targeted News Service, 7 Dec. 2016. Infotrac Newsstand, http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=STND&sw;=w&u;=lom_umichanna&v;=2.1‚Å¢=r&id;=GALE%7CA472997999&sid;=summon&asid;=c843213d4a832dfeadc34b9f83316ea6. Accessed 7 Mar. 2017. Furthermore, the Movement for Black Lives' goals to promote economic, political, and social change provide a \\"solid blueprint\\" for future legislators as they seek to further understand and resolve the problems that exist within the black community. In 2016, the Ford Foundation partnered with Borealis Philanthropy, an intermediary organization, to set up a \\"Black- Led Movement Fund\\" with the stated intention to \\"bring $100 million in new resources to the Movement for Black Lives\\". Although Ford Foundation decided to no longer move forward with their investment, the BLMF has been able to award small grants to several organizations within the Movement for Black Lives. There was widespread negative reaction among Jewish organizations to the Movement for Black Lives' 2016 Platform, wherein the latter group stated that \\"[the] US justifies and advances the global war on terror via its alliance with Israel and is complicit in the genocide taking place against the Palestinian people\\", that \\"Israel is an apartheid state\\", and that \\"[the] US [has funded an] apartheid wall\\". In August 2020, the Movement for Black Lives together with over 100 left-wing organisations, including the Council on American-Islamic Relations, Jewish Voice for Peace and Jews for Racial and Economic Justice, signed an open letter calling for cutting ties with the Anti-Defamation League.; Open letter to progressives: The ADL is not an ally. droptheadl.org, August 2020.

Early brain lesion studies indicated that different parts of the cortex served different cognitive functions, such as visual, somatosensory, and motor functions, beautifully assimilated by Brodmann in 1909. Today the field supports the idea of a 'protomap', which is a molecular pre-pattern of the cortical areas during early embryonic stages. The protomap is a feature of the cortical ventricular zone, which contains the primary stem cells of the cortex known as radial glial cells. A system of signaling centers, positioned strategically at the midline and edges of the cortex, produce secreted signaling proteins that establish concentration gradients in the cortical primordium. This provides positional information for each stem cell, and regulates proliferation, neurogenesis, and areal identity. After the initial establishment of areal identity, axons from the developing thalamus arrive at their correct cortical areal destination through the process of axon guidance and begin to form synapses. Many activity-dependent processes are then thought to play important roles in the maturation of each area.

It can be obtained by birth or naturalisation. The Jordanian nationality is transmitted by paternity (fatherhood) (see Jus sanguinis). Therefore, a Jordanian man who holds Jordanian citizenship can automatically confer citizenship to his children and foreign wives. Under the current law, descendants of Jordanian emigrants can only receive citizenship from their father as women cannot pass on citizenship to their children or foreign spouses. Since 2010, there has been an increasing public demand for giving the opportunity for Jordanian women to transmit their Jordanian nationality to their children and also to their husbands. Rights and responsibilities of Jordanian citizens =Rights of citizens= Citizens of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan by law have the legal right to: *Live freely in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan without any immigration requirements *Gain access to free education covering primary, and secondary education. University education is not free. *Receive all health-care benefits at any public health institution *Participate in the Jordanian political system *Benefit from the privileges of the free trade market agreements between the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and many Arab countries *Get exempted from taxes with no condition of reciprocity *Own and Inherit property and values in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan *Enter to and exit from the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan through any port *Travel to and from other countries in accordance with visa requirements *Seek consular assistance and protection abroad by the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan through Jordanian embassies and consulates abroad and others =Responsibilities of citizens= In a state of necessity, all Jordanian citizens are required, when prescribed by the law of the Jordanian government, to bear arms on behalf of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, to perform noncombatant service in the Jordanian Armed Forces, and to perform work of national importance under civilian direction. Under the supervision of an official authority, a person convicted by a court of law may be required to do any work or to render any service provided that the person is not hired to or placed at the disposal of any persons, companies, societies or public bodies. The code The code covering the Jordanian nationality was issued on 1 January 1954 as the Jordanian Nationality Law of 1954 and was last amended in 1987. Dual nationality According to the Jordanian government, there have been no restrictions on multiple citizenship in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan since its 1954 law on Jordanian nationality. Thus, foreigners who acquire Jordanian citizenship and Jordanian citizens who voluntarily acquire another citizenship keep their previous citizenship (subject to the laws of the other country). Acquisition of Jordanian citizenship =Jus sanguinis= A child is Jordanian at birth if: *Their father is a Jordanian citizen *Restricted maternal transmission of Jordanian citizenhip may only occur if, the woman is not married (and therefore her children are legally fatherless/illegitimate). Should a child be born legitimately to a non-citizen father, the shall be deemed to have acquired the citizenship of their father, this may result in cases where, children born to legitimate Palestinian fathers for instance, may be rendered stateless. =Naturalization= As per law No. 6 of 1954 on Nationality (last amended 1987). Article 4: Any Arab who has resided continuously in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan for not less than 15 years may acquire Jordanian nationality, by decision of the Council of Ministers taken on a proposal by the Minister of Internal Affairs, if he renounces his nationality of origin and the law of his country permits him to do so, provided that: (1)He is of good conduct and has never been convicted of an offence involving his honour or morals; (2)He has lawful means of livelihood; (3)He is of sound mind and does not suffer from any impairment that would make him a burden on society; (4)He takes an oath of allegiance and loyalty to his Majesty before a justice of the peace. Article 12: Any person other than a Jordanian who is not incapable by law may apply to the Council of Ministers for grant of a certificate of Jordanian naturalization if: (1)He has been regularly resident in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan for a period of four years preceding the date of his application; (2)He intends to reside in the Hashemite Kingdom of the Jordan. Birth in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan Birth in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan does not in itself confer Jordanian citizenship. Therefore, Jus soli does not apply. Loss of Jordanian citizenship A Jordanian may neither lose Jordanian citizenship nor acquire the nationality of another nation without the consent of the Board of Ministers, unless that other nation is an Arab state. =Renunciation= Jordanian law permits voluntary renunciation of Jordanian citizenship, with the permission of the Board of Ministers. Someone wishing to renounce his/her citizenship must contact the Jordanian consular or diplomatic officer or a Jordanian embassy within a foreign nation and pay the required fee and further be approved by the Ministry of the Interior. =Loss due to cessation of paternity= A child whose Jordanian citizenship depends on paternal links loses citizenship when those are cut. =Loss due to adoption= A Jordanian child adopted by foreign parents is considered to have lost Jordanian citizenship. Annulled adoptions Where a former Jordanian citizen lost citizenship due to adoption by foreign parents and that adoption is later annulled, the Jordanian citizenship is considered to never have been lost. =Dual Citizenship= Even though Jordanian nationality law permits multiple citizenship, a Jordanian national who also holds another country's citizenship may be required to renounce the foreign citizenship, under the foreign country's nationality law. A dual Jordanian-Japanese national must, for instance, make a declaration of choice, to the Japanese Ministry of Justice, before turning 22, as to whether he or she wants to keep the Jordanian or Japanese citizenship. =Loss due to misconduct= A person who commits misconduct that undermines the security of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan may be stripped and his family of their citizenships =Loss due to foreign defense registration= A person who joins the Armed Forces of another state will lose his/her Jordanian citizenship. Reforms Since 2010, there has been an increasing public demand for giving the opportunity for Jordanian women to transmit their Jordanian nationality to their children and also to their husbands. In recent years, growing domestic pressures and foreign concerns have demanded the Jordanian government to grant civil rights to the children of Jordanian women married to foreigners, including the right to receive treatment in hospitals affiliated with the Ministry of Health, the right to obtain residency permits and the right to education in public schools and universities. This is in addition to their right to work, obtain driver‚Äôs licenses and perhaps grant them ordinary passports (without a national number) to facilitate their travel outside the country. On 7 September 2014, amidst growing public outcry and pressures from foreign leaders such as the United States Secretary of State John Kerry, Jordanian Prime Minister Abdullah Ensour announced the government's approval to grant children of Jordanian women married to foreigners certain privileges and facilities to ease their lives within Jordan. The regulations were issued on 4 January 2015 and, near the end of the month, the Civil Status and Passports Department (CSPD) had received 9,741 applications to issue special identification cards for children of Jordanian women married to foreigners. Marwan Qteishat, director of the CSPD, told The Jordan Times near the end of January 2015 that they had issued 965 identification cards and processed 2,148 applications. Revocation of citizenship from Jordanian citizens of Palestinian origin Since 1988, and especially over the past few years, the Jordanian government has been arbitrarily and without notice withdrawing Jordanian nationality from its citizens of Palestinian origin, making them stateless. As Human Rights Watch has stated, this is in direct violation of Jordan's nationality law, which provides that non-Jewish Palestinian residents in 1949 or thereafter received full Jordanian nationality following Jordan's incorporation of the West Bank in April 1950. Palestinians who moved from the West Bank (whether refugees or not) to Jordan, are issued yellow-ID cards to distinguish them from the Palestinians of the \\"official 10 refugee camps\\" in Jordan. From 1988 to 2012, thousands of those yellow-ID card Palestinians had their Jordanian citizenship revoked. Jordan's Interior Minister Nayef al-Kadi said: > \\"Our goal is to prevent Israel from emptying the Palestinian territories of > their original inhabitants,\\" the minister explained, confirming that the > kingdom had begun revoking the citizenship of Palestinians. \\"We should be > thanked for taking this measure,\\" he said. \\"We are fulfilling our national > duty because Israel wants to expel the Palestinians from their > homeland.\\"Demonizing Israel is bad for the Palestinians, by Mudar Zarhan, > 01/08/2010, Jerusalem Post Human Rights Watch estimated that about 2,700 Palestinians were stripped of Jordanian nationality between 2004 and 2008.Jordan: Stop Withdrawing Nationality from Palestinian-Origin Citizens - Human Rights Watch. It is estimated that over 40,000 Palestinians were affected by this policy. The Jordanian government has said that these actions are akin to those of other Arab nations with the intention of helping Jordanians of Palestinian descent by requiring those who fled the West Bank or Jerusalem after the war in 1967 to keep their Israeli documents valid since the Israeli government continues to shift further right-wing under the leadership of its conservative foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman. Nabil Sharif, the former minister of state for media affairs and Jordanian ambassador to Morocco, said: In 2012, the Jordanian government promised to stop revoking the citizenship of Palestinians, and restored citizenship to 4,500 Palestinians who had previously lost it.Jordan promises to stop revoking citizenship from Palestinians - Times of Israel However, many have criticized the actions of the Jordanian government as an underhanded move to preserve the government's own interest by trying to appease non-Palestinian Jordanians concerned about the growing economic and political influence of citizens of Palestinian descent, which Nabil Sharif had denied.

Kovachevich's art practice is multi-faceted; exhibitions of paintings, sculptures, installations and performances have represented the lexicon of this artist. Kovachevich earned a B.A. in social science at Michigan State University and received his medical diploma and board certification in Family Medicine at the Chicago Osteopathic School of Medicine where he became inspired by ordinary medical materials and began making small sculptures with tape, cotton balls, suture thread, gauze, glass microscope slides, tissue, etc. In 1971, Kovachevich began his medical practice in Chicago. For the next thirty years medicine and art enhanced and intertwined both practices. Kovachevich has lived and worked in New York City since 1983.  Early Work 1960's-70‚Äôs  The small sculptures were shown in 1969 at the Detroit Institute of Arts in an exhibition curated by Sam Wagstaff. In 1970 an exhibition of cardboard boxes and screens made of foam core were exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art in the Penthouse Gallery, curated by Pierre Apraxine. At the 1972 documenta 5,documenta 5, catalog, Kassel, Germany: documenta GmbH; C.Bertelsmann Verlag, 1972. Print. curated by Harald Szeemann, the small sculptures were packed into a vintage hat box and exhibited in the Individual Mythology section of the exhibition in Kassel, Germany. The Hat Box traveled to the 1973 Biennale de Paris8e Biennale de Paris, Musee d‚ÄôArt Modern de la Ville de Paris, Musee National d‚ÄôArt Modern, Paris, France, illustrated (catalog). and the Musee de peinture et de SculptureMusee de Peinture et de Sculpture, Grenoble, France, illustrated (catalog). in Grenoble. In 1975 the curator A. James Speyer showed the sculptures in the Small Scale in Contemporary Art exhibition at the Art Institute of Chicago. During this time Kovachevich became colleagues with artists Thomas Shannon, Balthasar Burkhard, Markus Raetz, Richard Tuttle, Walter De Maria and James Lee Byars. Kovachevich painted shadows in his first solo museum exhibition at the MCA Chicago in 1973, titled Rooms and Shadows. In 1976, paper cut-outs and gels attached to medical light boxes were exhibited in the Abstract Art in Chicago exhibition at the MCA Chicago.Morrison, C.L., Abstract Art In Chicago, Artforum; April, 1977, Vol. 15 Issue 8, p. 70-73, 4p, 5 Black and White Photographs Paper wall installations realized from paper packaging tape made their debut to Kovachevich's body of work. The paper tape reacted in constant movement, opening and closing according to the given moisture in the air. Performance art made a large impact on Kovachevich's practice after developing and receiving a patent, ‚ÄòMethod to effect a continuous movement of a fibrous material,‚Äô fueled by the power of evaporation. Kovachevich coined the term \\"K - Motion\\", meaning constant motion. With water, paper and a fabric, the movement of cut paper shapes acted out a \\"story.\\" As the costume, set and lighting designer, Kovachevich also considered himself an observer like the audience.

As an ancient trade center, the trading and business relations that existed with the Europeans and the Arabs brought people and ideas from many other lands. The Christian missionaries and the educational reforms they brought played an important role in transforming society. The migration to Travancore during Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan's invasion was another factor, resulting in less social distance between upper and lower castes from the 18th to mid-20th centuries. This effect did not reach the Travancore Cochin area, which was not under the Madras Presidency, where inequality was greater. \\"Mukathezhuthu\\"-The face painting of Theyyam, the religious ritual art form in Thalassery In the colonial era Thalassery was the centre of learning in north Kerala. The first Malayalam newspapers, novels and short stories in Malayalam were written there. Earlier, the well known romantic poem in Malayalam, \\"Veenapoovu\\" (Fallen Flower) of Kumaran Asan was published from Thalassery. It was the birthplace of the Communist movement in Kerala. Rajya Samacharam, the first Malayalam newspaper, was published from Thalassery. The Government of Kerala has included Thalassery in its heritage city project. The project includes the preservation of historial structures.  Circus  Vishnu Pant Chhatre's Great Indian Circus's was established 1880 in Bombay, the first circus establishment in India. A tour of Thalassery led to the meeting of Chhatre with Keeleri Kunhikannan a martial arts trainer. Keeleri Kunhikannan established the first dedicated circus school in India in 1901. He is known as \\"the father of Kerala Circus\\". A Circus Academy was inaugurated in Thalassery in 2010.  Architecture  Before the 1900s, the majority of the population who were in lower middle class society had small houses coconut leave thatched roofs and stone. The soil strength of north Kerala is high when compared to southern region so the traditional houses of upper class society was built using well finished stone walls where as in southern regions was mainly built using woods. The royal proclamation by the Maharaja of Travancore in 1817 and 1857 abolishing the restriction of clay tiles as roofing material to the noble class resulted in the widespread use of clay tile roofing by common man throughout Kerala. In the middle of 19th century Mangalore tiles became a common roofing material throughout Kerala. There was no influence of exotic architecture in the region In the modern era majority of the house holds are individual concrete apartments and there are few flat habitation coming up in the region.  Cuisine  Thalassery Falooda Thalassery is known for its biryani (in local dialect, biri-yaa-ni) Unlike other biriyani cuisines Thalassery biryani uses Kaima/Jeerakasala rice instead of the usual basmati rice. The influence of Arabian/Mughal culture is evident, especially in the dishes of the Muslim community, although many have become popular among all communities. Thalassery Falooda is a regional variant of the Persian dessert. This is a cocktail of fruit salad, dry fruits such as black current, pistachio, cashew, almond (badam), rose milk and vanilla ice cream. Thalsserry has produced a lot of good cricketers to Kerala Team. The Asian Green Mussel (Perna viridis) cuisines are favored in Thalassery dishes. The mussel is called Kallu-mma-kaya (fruit on the stone). They grow on rocks in contact with sea. Other dishes include Kallummakaya porichathu (fried mussel), Arikkadukka (mussel fried in rice batter), pickled mussels. Elambakka mussels are also popular.Farmers urge to take up mussel culture. The Hindu (6 October 2010). The green mussel's popularity led farmers to employ aquaculture in local rivers to increase supplies.Promoting mussel farming among the resource-poor.

The British East India Company established their authority by destroying the traditional military character of the community of Malabar. The Mysorean invaders destroyed traditional institutions, landholding patterns and supremacy of local rulers, along with the power and prestige of the Malabar militia, leading to the decline of Kalari. On 20 February 1804, Robert Richards, the Principal Collector of Malabar, wrote to Lord William Bentinck, President and General-in Council, Fort. St. George, asking permission to take action against persons carrying arms, either imposing death penalty or deportation for life. Lord Bentinck issued an order on 22 April 1804, that those who concealed weapons or disobeyed the orders of the British against carrying arms, would be deported. At the time of the Pazhassi rebellion, British soldiers raided rebel homes to confiscate their arms.Robert Richards, Papers on the Administration of Malabar DistrictThalassery ‚Äì Personalities ‚Äì C.V.

She had lavish accommodations, and during her career developed a reputation for speed and reliability, with good food and music for her passengers. Douro entered service in 1865, initially serving routes between the United Kingdom and the West Indies. Early in her career, she was running mates with until Rhone sank in 1867. In 1869, Douro switched to South American service on the Southampton, England-Buenos Aires, Argentina, route. As a Royal Mail Ship, she carried mail and newspapers under contract. She also often carried precious cargo, including gold and diamonds. Sinking On 31 March 1882 Douro ‚Äì bound from Buenos Aires to Southampton with stops at Brazil and Lisbon, Portugal ‚Äì was running 90 minutes behind schedule when she departed Lisbon bound for Southampton on the final leg of the voyage. In order to make up time, she proceeded at full speed northward off the Portuguese and Spanish coasts. On the evening of 1 April, Douro passed Spain‚Ä≤s Cape Finisterre under a full moon. Her fourth officer noticed the Spanish steamer about two nautical miles (2.3 miles; 3.7 km) away but assumed that the officer on the bridge had also spotted her and did not pass word of the sighting to him. The officer on the bridge only sighted Yrurac Bat later, when it was too late to avoid a collision, and at 22:45 hours on 1 April Yrurac Bat rammed Douro. Yrurac Bat‚Ä≤s bow cut two deep gashes in Douro‚Ä≤s starboard side. The passengers and crew of Douro abandoned ship in a great hurry, and Douro sank 30 minutes after the collision in 1,500 feet (457 meters) of water. There were six fatalities ‚Äì her captain, Ebenezer C.

IFP2.0-hGem(1/110) fluorescence is shown in green and highlights the S/G2/M phases. smURFP- hCdtI(30/120) fluorescence is shown in red and highlights the G0/G1 phases. Small ultra red fluorescent protein (smURFP) is a class of far-red fluorescent protein evolved from a cyanobacterial (Trichodesmium erythraeum) phycobiliprotein, Œ±-allophycocyanin. Native Œ±-allophycocyanin requires an exogenous protein, known as a lyase, to attach the chromophore, phycocyanobilin. Phycocyanobilin is not present in mammalian cells. smURFP was evolved to covalently attach phycocyanobilin without a lyase and fluoresce, covalently attach biliverdin (ubiquitous to mammalian cells) and fluoresce, blue-shift fluorescence to match the organic fluorophore, Cy5, and not inhibit E. coli growth. smURFP was found after 12 rounds of random mutagenesis and manually screening 10,000,000 bacterial colonies.  Properties  smURFP is a homodimer with absorption and emission maximum of 642 nm and 670 nm, respectively. A tandem dimer smURFP (TDsmURFP) was created and has similar properties to smURFP. smURFP is extremely stable with a protein degradation half-life of 17 hour and 33 hour without and with chromophore (biliverdin), respectively. This is comparable to the jellyfish-derived enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) protein degradation half-life of 24 hour. smURFP is extremely photostable and out performs mCherry and tdTomato in living cells. The extinction coefficient (180,000 M‚àí1 cm‚àí1) of smURFP is extremely large and has a modest quantum yield (0.20), which makes it comparable biophysical brightness to eGFP and ~2-fold brighter than most red or far-red fluorescent proteins derived from coral. Despite being a homodimer, all tested N- and C- terminal fusions show correct cellular localization, including the difficult fusion to Œ±-tubulin and Lamin B1 (Figure). smURFP is named after the Smurfs, due to its light blue appearance in white light. An Excel sheet of the smURFP absorbance, excitation, and emission spectra can be downloaded here. The crystal structure of a smURFP mutant () was published in Fuenzalida-Werner et al. Image shows E. coli expressing smURFP, pelleting of E. coli, removal of media, E. coli lysis, smURFP binding to NiNTA, smURFP elution, and buffer exchange.  smURFP used as nanoparticles, exogenous probes, and in vitro assays  Free smURFP is 2-3 nm in diameter. smURFP nanoparticles of ~10-14 nm diameter can be synthesized in an oil and water emulsion and remain fluorescent. These fluorescent protein nanoparticles are stable in living mice and useful for non-invasive tumor fluorescence imaging. Free smURFP, purified protein and not genetically encoded, can be encapsulated into viruses and used for non-invasive, fluorescence imaging of biodistribution in living mice. smURFP allows for the creation of in vitro assays to detect enzyme activity. An assay was developed for thrombin with a detection range of 1.07 aM‚Äì0.01 mM and a limit of detection of 0.2 aM.  Chromophore availability in cells and mice  smURFP was genetically fused to human, lamin B1 to show the nuclear envelope with fluorescence. Localization of the Lamin B1 protein changes during different phases of the cell cycle. Despite showing comparable biophysical brightness to eGFP when purified protein was normalized, this was not seen in living cells. This suggested there was not enough chromophore (biliverdin) within cells. Addition of biliverdin increased fluorescence, but smURFP with biliverdin was not comparable to eGFP. Biliverdin has two carboxylates at neutral pH and this is inhibiting cellular entry. Biliverdin dimethyl ester is a more hydrophobic analog and readily crosses the cellular membrane. smURFP with biliverdin dimethyl ester shows comparable fluorescence to eGFP in cells and is brighter than bacterial phytochrome fluorescent proteins. smURFP expressed in neuronal culture does not show aggregation in lysosomes, which was seen with the fluorescent protein, mCherry. In mice, smURFP fluorescence is visible in HT1080 tumor xenografts without exogenous biliverdin, but fluorescence is less than coral-derived red fluorescent proteins, mCherry and mCardinal. Visible fluorescence is not always usable fluorescence and fluorescent proteins should always be compared to other useful, genetically encoded fluorescent proteins. Intravenous injection of exogenous biliverdin or biliverdin dimethyl ester does not increase fluorescence of smURFP expressed in tumors after 1 to 24 hours. Mass spectrometry showed that the ester groups were rapidly removed from biliverdin dimethyl ester. Addition of 25 ŒºM biliverdin or biliverdin dimethyl ester dramatically increased fluorescence of excised tumors and smURFP is present without chromophore. Further research is necessary to optimize chromophore availability in mice to obtain fluorescence comparable or greater than coral- derived red fluorescent proteins.  Adding chromophore to cells  Biliverdin dimethyl ester, biliverdin, and phycocyanobilin are commercially available from Frontier Scientific. Biliverdin dimethyl ester, biliverdin, or phycocyanobilin is dissolved in DMSO at a concentration of 5 mM. The solution is very dark and pipette vigorously to ensure all is dissolved. Biliverdin dimethyl ester is not soluble in common buffers, including phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS). Add 1-5 ŒºM biliverdin dimethyl ester in media or buffer containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Add 25 ŒºM biliverdin (not as membrane permeant) to cells. Biliverdin does not saturate the smURFP sites and does not achieve maximum fluorescence intensity. Biliverdin dimethyl ester should be used to get maximum fluorescence intensity. Incubate smURFP with chromophore for as long as possible to increase protein accumulation caused by enhanced protein stability with chromophore. Leave chromophore for a minimum of 3 hours and 24 h is recommended. Remove chromophore, wash with media containing 10% FBS, and image in media lacking phenol red or imaging buffer.  smURFP genetically encoded biosensors  Far Red & Near Infrared FUCCI visualizes the birth of a multinucleated cell, which is common in many cancer cells.Kinase FRET sensor. smURFP is a useful acceptor for many red fluorescent proteins due to spectral overlap. A rationally designed red fluorescent protein, stagRFP, allows for easier creation of FRET sensors. stagRFP is a useful FRET donor to the far-red acceptor smURFP and an ERK kinase FRET reporter was created with an average response of ~15%. The new sensor allowed for simultaneous visualization of three kinases, Src, Akt, ERK, in a single cell. Fluorescently imaging the cell cycle. Pioneering work by Atsushi Miyawaki and coworkers developed the fluorescent ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator (FUCCI), which enables fluorescence imaging of the cell cycle. Originally, a green fluorescent protein, mAG, was fused to hGem(1/110) and an orange fluorescent protein (mKO2) was fused to hCdt1(30/120). Note, these fusions are fragments that contain a nuclear localization signal and ubiquitination sites for degradation, but are not functional proteins. The green fluorescent protein is made during the S, G2, or M phase and degraded during the G0 or G1 phase, while the orange fluorescent protein is made during the G0 or G1 phase and destroyed during the S, G2, or M phase. A far-red and near-infrared FUCCI was developed using a cyanobacteria-derived fluorescent protein (smURFP) and a bacteriophytochrome-derived fluorescent protein (movie found at this link).center  References   External links  * SmURFP KX449134 & TDsmURFP, KX449135 - GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ Accession Codes * FPbase entry *Obtain Plasmid DNA at Addgene (Non-profit organization for sharing DNA.)

Criticism included the deaths of civilians, the execution of the raid, increased sympathy toward Israel's opponents or enemies, and increased isolation of Israel.  Israel  A survey of Israeli Jews published in Maariv on 2 June showed 94.8 percent agreeing that it was necessary to stop the boats, with 62.7 percent saying it should have been handled in a different manner. Only 8.1 percent thought Netanyahu should resign. The newspaper didn't say how many people were surveyed or give a margin of error. Criticism within Israel on the flotilla operation has focused largely on the execution of the raid and not the blockade. The Israeli media, which had initially supported the IDF action and corroborated the IDF account of the incident, later criticized the operation as having been badly handled. Haaretz said that the Israeli army had fallen into a trap set by the flotilla organizers. While Israeli soldiers were supported, the government was chastised for putting Israel in a compromising situation. The Israeli newspaper Haaretz had a headline initially reading \\"Botched raid on Free Gaza Flotilla\\", the online headline was later changed to \\"Israel fears diplomatic backlash in wake of Gaza flotilla deaths\\", while Maariv went with \\"Flotilla Fiasco\\". Israeli journalist Gideon Levy remarked in an opinion article, \\"Again Israel will pay a heavy diplomatic price, once which had not been considered ahead of time.

The natural arc of > relations will have to change.Sabrina Tavernise, \\"Thousands in Turkey Mourn > Victims of Israeli Raid\\", The New York Times, 3 June 2010. C√ºneyt √úlsever, a commentator in the daily H√ºrriyet, has criticized the ƒ∞HH, saying, \\"People will understand very soon that the ƒ∞HH is harming Turkey, and warned that the effect of the crisis would be to persuade the West that Turkey is aligning itself with the likes of Iran, Syria, Hamas and Hezbollah.\\"  United States  The Washington Post and CBS News reported that American lawmakers in both parties expressed support for Israel in the wake of growing international condemnation following the raid. New York Democratic Party Representative Anthony Weiner said \\"This was about instigating an altercation and they succeeded.\\" Another New York Representative, Gary Ackerman, told the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs he \\"strongly support[s] Israel's right to defend itself, and the right of Israels naval commandos, who were executing a legal mission, to defend themselves by using force when they were brutally attacked\\". Politico reports. According to Fox News United States Senator John McCain said pro-Palestinian activists \\"wanted to provoke an international crisis ... and they obviously succeeded\\", while he also questioned President Obama's commitment to Israeli security in the wake of the current crisis. Los Angeles Times asked several questions regarding the responsibility for the clash, while saying there was still much to be learned about the incident. While saying \\"As is so often the case with events involving Israelis and Palestinians, the competing narratives allow supporters of almost any position to hear what they want to hear.\\" The editorial said, \\"This much, however, seems undeniable: Israel has done itself serious damage. [This was because] the decision to deploy armed troops to obstruct what was apparently a nonviolent mission and then, even if you accept Israel's version of events, to allow them to be drawn into a battle that left so many civilians dead, will serve as a further blow to the ailing peace process and as more fodder for those who argue that Israel's 'disproportionate' use of force is evidence of a cavalier attitude toward human life.\\" While admitting the raid would not focus new attention on the blockade itself, the editorial also concluded in saying, \\"This page supports Israel's right to self-defense. We support reasonable measures to stop cross-border shelling and to keep weapons from illegally entering Gaza by land or sea. We oppose the Hamas government's consistent call for the destruction of Israel. But we also want to see an end to the blockade, which amounts to collective punishment of about 1.5 million Palestinians.\\" The New York Times quoted a statement allegedly from the flotilla organizers saying \\"A violent response from Israel will breathe new life into the Palestine solidarity movement, drawing attention to the blockade.\\" They then said \\"There can be no excuse for the way that Israel completely mishandled the incident.\\" And that the raid turned out to be \\"a grievous, self-inflicted wound. It has damaged Israel's ties with Turkey, once its closest ally in the Muslim world; given the Hamas-led government in Gaza a huge propaganda boost; and complicated peace talks with the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank.\\" It also asks \\"Why did Israel, which has blocked some ships but allowed others to pass, decide to take a stand now? Did it make a real effort to find a compromise with Turkey, which sanctioned the flotilla? [While] Israel has a right to stop weapons from going into Gaza, but there has been no suggestion that the ships were carrying a large cache.\\" The New York Times concludes, \\"needs to state clearly that the Israeli attack was unacceptable and back an impartial international investigation. The United States should also join the other permanent members of the United Nations Security Council ‚Äì Britain, France, Russia and China ‚Äì in urging Israel to permanently lift the blockade.\\"\\"Israel and the Blockade\\" Another editorial said \\"Turkey is understandably furious\\" but \\"Turkish officials have let their anger and rhetoric go way too far.... Israel deserves to be criticized for the flotilla disaster. But gratuitously stoking anti-Israeli sentiment is irresponsible and dangerous.\\"\\"Turkey's Fury\\". The New York Times The San Francisco Chronicle called the raid a \\"disaster on every level\\". It also contended that Israel's \\"enemies could not have scripted a more bungled operation: ... setting off recriminations, policy breaches and deepening isolation for Israel ... The peace process, already in the cryogenic stage, is at full stop ... The episode reruns old stories. Palestinian sympathizers wanted a confrontation over Israel's blockade of Hamas-run Gaza ... and ignored offers to dock in Israeli ports and ship the aid by land.... Another horrifying Mideast moment will live on to paralyze progress in the future ... The purpose was clearly to call attention to the blockade, viewed as essential by Israel to cap terrorism, and regarded as harsh and unsuccessful by critics.\\" It concluded, \\"There is no other course than to admit a serious mistake. Without one, the region is condemned to a future without change or hope.\\" In an op-ed piece The Wall Street Journal said \\"Israel's actions in boarding the flotilla of ships bound for the Gaza Strip were entirely justified and perhaps even unavoidable.\\" Although, they add the caveat, \\"Unfortunately they turned into a tactical and strategic fiasco that does further damage to the Jewish State's tattered international reputation.\\" A separate Wall Street Journal article emphasized Israel's need to keep advanced weaponry from getting to Hamas: \\"Those who denounce Israel today ought to at least propose how they mean to keep arms from going to Hamas‚Äîor else consider the role their denunciations will play in encouraging another war.\\" Another article stated \\"the more facts that come to light about the flotilla, its passengers and their sponsors, the more it seems clear that Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Ergodan's government, far more so than Israel's, must be held to account for Monday's violent episode.\\" After describing the links between the Islamic charity that organized the flotilla and terrorist groups, The Wall Street Journal states \\"No wonder that Israel was not prepared to let this flotilla break its blockade of Gaza.... Israel is entirely within its rights to prevent Hamas from linking with groups suspected of supplying arms and money to terrorists. Israel had also gone out of its way to give Turkey fair warning....\\" The Wall Street Journal goes on to note that Turkish foreign policy under Erdogan has become progressively radical and out of line with the U.S. The Washington Post said the raid was a \\"diplomatic debacle for the government of Binyamin Netanyahu\\". And, \\"Though the investigations to come will find many to blame, it's already clear that Israel's response to the pro- Palestinian flotilla was both misguided and badly executed.\\" The editorial also said, \\"We have no sympathy for the motives of the participants in the flotilla.... What's plain is that the group's nominal purpose, delivering 'humanitarian' supplies to Gaza, was secondary to the aim of provoking a confrontation.\\" While saying \\"Yet the threat to Israel was political rather than military. So far there's been no indication the boats carried missiles or other arms for Hamas.\\" It continued \\"Mr. Netanyahu's aim should have been to prevent the militants from creating the incident they were hoping for. Allowing the boats to dock in Gaza, as Israel had done before, would have been better than sending military commandos to intercept them. The fact that the soldiers who roped down from helicopters to the lead Turkish ferry were unprepared to subdue its passengers without using lethal force only compounded the error.\\" It concluded, \\"The prime minister (Netanyahu) is in a deepening hole; his only way out is to move to the center.\\" Another editorial stated that while \\"Western governments have been right to be concerned about Israel's poor judgment ... [they] ought to be at least as worried about the Turkish government ... which ... has shown a sympathy toward Islamic militants and a penchant for grotesque demagoguery toward Israel that ought to be unacceptable for a member of NATO.\\" In reference to Turkey's statement, \\"Israel had no just cause to clash with 'European lawmakers, journalists, business leaders, and a Holocaust survivor,' the article noted, \\"there was no fighting with those people, or with five of the six boats in the fleet. All of the violence occurred aboard the Turkish ferry Mavi Marmara, and all of those who were killed were members or volunteers for the Islamic 'charity' that owned the ship.\\" The editorial claimed that the ƒ∞HH \\"is a member of the 'Union of Good,' a coalition that was formed to provide material support to Hamas and that was named as a terrorist entity by the United States in 2008\\". It then said, \\"The relationship between Mr. Erdogan's government and the ƒ∞HH ought to be one focus of any international investigation into the incident.\\" The article claims, \\"In the days since an incident that the ƒ∞HH admits it provoked [Erdogan] has done his best to compete with Iran's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Hezbollah's Hassan Nasrallah in attacking the Jewish state [and calling] Israel's actions 'state terrorism.' [and Israel] merciless, rootless state.\\" The editorial labeles Davutoglu's comparison saying \\"this attack is like 9/11 for Turkey\\" as an \\"obscene comparison\\". The article attacked Erdogan in saying his \\"attempt to exploit the incident comes only a couple of weeks after he joined Brazil's president in linking arms with Mr. Ahmadinejad, whom he is assisting in an effort to block new UN sanctions\\". The article mentions that Turkey's moves came despite the Obama administration overtures. \\"What's remarkable about his turn toward extremism is that it comes after more than a year of assiduous courting by the Obama administration, which, among other things, has overlooked his antidemocratic behavior at home, helped him combat the Kurdish PKK and catered to Turkish sensitivities about the Armenian genocide. Israel is suffering the consequences of its misjudgments and disregard of U.S. interests. Will Mr. Erdogan's behavior be without cost?\\" USA Today said \\"In practical terms, the argument hardly matters. By opting for an assault on the six-ship convoy trying to break a 3-year-old blockade of Gaza, Israel handed its opponents a victory they could not have achieved by other means and simultaneously left itself, the United States and the struggling Mideast peace process with a huge problem.... Israel, however, remained adamant, implausibly casting the flotilla organizers as a mortal threat.\\" They drew parallels saying \\"The pity is that the Israelis so lacked the same prescience, remarkable in light of their own history. No event was more important to the formation of Israel than the confrontation 63 years ago between the ship Exodus....\\" They believed that as a \\"smart solution to the current impasse.... Israel should allow humanitarian aid into Gaza on the condition that cargo first be inspected for weapons. Palestinians should accept that restriction. The United States and United Nations should try to ensure its enforcement.\\"  Canada  The Toronto Sun said the attack damaged Israel's reputation and suggested it \\"might have wanted to rethink the orders that led to Monday's fatal clash\\". It reasoned that this, along with the Dubai assassination of a Hamas leader, \\"left a trail of evidence a mile wide, to put a dent in the reputation of the country's legendary intelligence and security operations. \\" Adding, \\"For the peace process, this story feels relevant in ways that may not be obvious right away, as though something has shifted. It's not as simple as Israel stumbling into a PR disaster or lost international support, as some would like to make it.\\" However, it also said, \\"For the Palestinians, it underscored the division between blockaded, Hamas-run Gaza and the West Bank, which has fared better in so many ways for not being Hamas- run Gaza.\\"  Europe  The Times published an article by former Spanisn Prime Minister Jos√© Maria Aznar saying the world must support Israel because \\"if it goes down, we all go down. In an ideal world, the assault by Israeli commandos on the 'Mavi Marmara' would not have ended up with nine dead and a score wounded. In an ideal world, the soldiers would have been peacefully welcomed on to the ship.\\" In the article Aznar criticised Turkey, for placing Israel \\"in an impossible situation\\" in which it would have to either give up its security or face world condemnation. Aznar concluded that Israel is the West's first line of defense, and must be protected. The Financial Times called the attack a \\"brazen act of piracy\\", that dealt a blow to the legitimacy of Israel's struggle. The paper continued, \\"Israel claims the activists had links with extremist groups and that some attacked Israeli soldiers with knives and sticks (and in some accounts the odd light firearm). Even if true, this would not justify the illegal capture of civilian ships carrying humanitarian aid in international waters, let alone the use of deadly force.\\" G√ºnther Nonnenmacher of the editorial board of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung wrote that Israel seems to have lost all sense of proportion and would not pay attention to public opinion. The raid on the convoy would constitute a new level of escalation. The Croatian daily Jutarnji list said Croatia was in an unenviable position because \\"On the one hand, the country feels responsibility towards Israel and its politics have always reflected that responsibility. On the other hand, Turkey is an important ally in the region with its influence on the reform processes in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and as a growing trading partner for Croatia.\\" The Wall Street Journal said that skepticism concerning the IHH version of events on the Mavi Marmara \\"appears to have accelerated as a result of unexpected criticism of the IHH's actions from Turkish moderate Islamic leader Fethullah G√ºlen\\". Turkey's Cuneyt Ulsever, a commentator in the daily H√ºrriyet, wrote, \\"People will understand very soon that the IHH is harming Turkey, and warned that the effect of the crisis would be to persuade the West that Turkey is aligning itself with the likes of Iran, Syria, Hamas and Hezbollah.\\" The Wall Street Journal said that skepticism concerning the IHH version of events on the Mavi Marmara \\"appears to have accelerated as a result of unexpected criticism of the IHH's actions from Turkish moderate Islamic leader Fethullah G√ºlen\\". The religious conservative daily Vakit published on its front page the names and photographs of eight newspaper columnists who censured the government's handling of the flotilla affair, calling them \\"spin doctors who shoot bullets at the aid ship\\". Artistic response Pixies, Gorillaz, and Klaxons were among the bands scheduled to play at Tel Aviv's Pic.Nic festival. According to festival organizers, all three groups cancelled their plans in relation to the naval raid. In addition Gil Scott-Heron cancelled an appearance. The Brazilian film maker Iara Lee wrote about her experience on the ship in an article in the San Francisco Chronicle in which she said \\"Israel's powerful navy could have easily approached our boat and boarded it in broad daylight or pursued nonviolent options for disabling our vessel. Instead, the Israeli military launched a nighttime assault with heavily armed commandos.... I feared for the lives of my fellow passengers as I heard shots being fired on deck, and I later saw the bodies of several people killed being carried inside.... When it was over, the Israeli soldiers commandeered our ships, illegally kidnapped us from international waters, towed us to the port of Ashdod, and arrested all of us on board.\\" Concluding, \\"What happened to our flotilla is happening to the people of Gaza on a daily basis. It will not stop until international law is applied to all countries, Israel included.\\"\\"What happened to us is happening in Gaza\\". San Francisco Chronicle (5 June 2010). Meg Ryan and Dustin Hoffman canceled their appearances in 2010's Jerusalem Film Festival. According to associate director of the festival, Yigal Molad Hayo, neither gave the political climate as a direct reason for canceling their participation in the festival but it became quite clear that was the reason. ;Comedic response Latma TV, an initiative of the Center for Security Policy, a staunchly conservative organization located in Washington, D.C., produced a video titled We Con the World and set to the tune of the 1985 hit, \\"We Are the World\\". The video, which is published on the internet, satirizes the political intentions of the activists aboard the MV Mavi Marmara with up to a dozen members of the so-called \\"Flotilla Choir\\"‚Äî some wearing a variation of traditional Arab dress‚Äîsing satirical verses, such as: \\"There's no people dying, so the best that we can do is create the biggest bluff of all.\\" The Israeli government's press office later apologized for circulating a link to the video that mocked activists on board, and clarified that it does not represent Israel's official stance.\\"Satiric flotilla clip distributed by GPO\\", Ynetnews (20 June 1995). The creation of the film was initiated by Caroline Glick, the deputy managing director and columnist for the Jerusalem Post. ;Documentary Following upon the event and the various video clips presented by both Turkey and Israel, Iranian filmmaker Saeed Faraji created Freedom Flotilla, a 56-minute documentary film about the event as his first feature length film project.

Those supporting Israel generally also expressed concern for the loss of life and injuries to civilians. Criticism included the death and injuries of civilians, the disproportionate response, and the execution of the raid.  Israel  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was in Canada during the incident, expressed regret for the loss of life, and said that the event represents a clear case of self- defense of the IDF soldiers, he expressed his \\"full backing\\" for the military raid and cancelled a scheduled trip to the United States to meet with U.S. President Barack Obama. A spokesman for the Prime Minister was quoted as saying that Netanyahu, \\"feels he has to be home to deal with this\\". he told a press conference that had Israel not stopped the flotilla from breaking the blockade and entering the Gaza Strip illegally, hundreds of more flotillas would arrive carrying weapons.Sofer, Roni. \\"PM: I am proud of soldiers\\".

In an address to the country, on 2 June he said \\"Israel faces hypocrisy and a biased rush to judgment.\\"\\"Israelis Support Netanyahu Charging Hypocrisy on Gaza (Update1)\\". Bloomberg News (4 June 2010). He further noted that in five of the six vessels in the flotilla, the boarding procedure ended without casualties. \\"The only difference was with one ship, where extremist Islamic activists, supporters of terrorism, waited for our troops on the deck with axes and knives.\\"\\"Israeli forces board the Rachel Corrie\\", The Guardian, 5 June 2010 After the boarding took place, Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon said that the flotilla of ships \\"was an armada of hate and violence\\". He added that the flotilla attempt to reach Gaza was \\"a premeditated and outrageous provocation\\" and claimed that its organizers had ties not only to Hamas, but also to global Jihad, and al Qaida. Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman called the international community \\"two faced\\" and said Israel was being condemned for its military acts of defense. Lieberman was said to have been \\"reminding\\" the UN Secretary General that in the past month alone over 500 people were killed in various incidents in Thailand, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq and India, which had allegedly been \\"ignored\\" while Israel was being condemned for its \\"unmistakably defensive actions\\".

Deccan Herald Opposition leader Tzipi Livni said that the coalition and the opposition are united in support of the defense forces, and that she is ready to assist the government in the political and explanatory aspects of the flotilla incident.\\"Livni offers help: In defending IDF there is no coalition, opposition\\". Ynetnews (20 June 1995). She, however, disagreed with what she considered Netanyahu's lack of policy: \\"The world is certainly hypocritical, but that doesn't absolve us from forming a policy. This is more than an isolated incident. Anything that happened when Israel had a different standing in world opinion would have had a different result. Now, any isolated incident becomes a global drama, and it's becoming worse. We are reaching the stage when Israel's ability to defend itself will no longer exist.\\" She said the lack of policy in the aftermath of the incident would jeopardize Israel's legitimacy and backing from the international community, which she says for years had insisted on not recognizing Hamas until it recognizes Israel and accepts past agreements, and had accepted the closure of Gaza while \\"it was clear that Israel wanted an agreement with pragmatic forces, with the legitimate Palestinian government.\\" She also said that IDF soldiers acted appropriately, and supports setting up an internal investigation committee with the United States. Ambassador to the U.K., Ron Prosor, said: \\"It's obvious ‚Äì and I won't beat around the bush on this ‚Äì that this wasn't successful and I think it clearly took up an issue that should have been solved differently.\\" [However, the] other side [behaved] appallingly.

He added that no one should think that Turkey would declare war on Israel.

Erdoƒüan spoke to the AKP Group at the Turkish Parliament, he said \\"Turkey's friendship is as strong as its animosity.\\" He also strongly rebuked Israel's action saying even pirates had a code of conduct. Erdoƒüan upped the ante, in a speech to legislators saying Israel should be \\"punished\\" for its \\"bloody massacre\\" amid a warning that no one should test Turkey's patience. He said \\"It is no longer possible to cover up or ignore Israel's lawlessness. The international community must from now on say 'enough is enough'. Dry statements of condemnation are not enough ... There should be results.\\" He said the Israeli action was an attack \\"on international law, [and] the conscience of humanity and world peace\\". He even said that Israel acts as it does because it has powerful friends. He called for Israel to lift the \\"inhuman siege\\" of the Gaza Strip, which he referred to as an \\"open-air prison\\", and announced that he was considering sending the Turkish Navy to escort any future flotillas or to visit Gaza himself, in order to break the blockade. He also urged the international community to impose sanctions on Israel. President Abdullah G√ºl said, \\"From now on, Turkish- Israeli ties will never be the same. This incident has left an irreperable and deep scar.\\" He also said, \\"Turkey will never forgive this attack.\\" G√ºl compared Israel's actions to those of al-Qaeda, and demanded that Israel apologize and pay compensation, and also urged Israel to thoroughly investigate the incident and lift the blockade of Gaza. Al-Manar A Turkish Foreign Ministry statement condemned Israel, and the foreign ministry was reported to have summoned the Israeli ambassador to lodge a protest. Turkey recalled its ambassador from Israel. Foreign Minister, Ahmet Davutoƒülu told the UN Security Council that Israel has \\"lost all legitimacy\\" as a result of the raid.

Turkey said that all future aid vessels would be escorted by the Turkish Navy. Leaders of opposition parties in Turkey also condemned the raid on Turkish ships. The leader of MHP, Devlet Bah√ßeli, said the attack was an aggression that should be never accepted by the Turkish nation. Kemal Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu, chairman of the Republican People's Party (CHP), supported Turkish government's efforts for a UN Security Council resolution to condemn Israeli government and he said \\"We said we have given our support to the prime minister, as he said the attacks would not be left without a response. We said the CHP would support solutions which are concordant with our national interests.\\" However, he also criticized the Turkish government and told Turkish television, \\"The European Union and the United States consider Hamas a terror organization. We must be careful.\\" He demanded that the government release communications with Israel prior to the incident, suggesting it allowed the flotilla to proceed despite knowing that violence was likely. Erdogan dismissed Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu as an Israeli \\"advocate\\" after Kƒ±lƒ±√ßdaroƒülu recited Torah's the eighth commandment, which says 'Do not steal' and the ninth commandment says 'Do not lie'.

It is the home of The Royal Westminster Regiment, an infantry reserve regiment. Architecture The wooden structure was one of the few buildings to survive the great fire of 1898. Although it was a single structure it is referred to as \\"The Armouries\\" by members of The Royal Westminster Regiment. In 1895 contractor David Bain, using designs of Thomas Fuller, began construction on the site. The building was completed in 1896 but would still require the completion of the Gun Room in 1898. In addition to the parade square the building houses the Regimental Museum, offices, quartermaster store room, Officers' Mess and Warrants' and Sergeants' Mess (the Junior Ranks' Mess is housed in the adjoining building). It formerly housed a firing range in the basement and was eventually replaced with a Small Arms Training (SAT range) in a second building on the site. The building is a Recognized Federal Heritage Building. The founding of the original Westminster Volunteer Rifles dates back to 20 November 1863. The Armouries served as the headquarters for the subsequent Regiments throughout the Great War and World War II. During the fighting in Italy the men of the Westminster Regiment (M.G.) saw more continuous combat than any other Canadian fighting unit. In recognition of outstanding service the title \\"Royal\\" was given to the Regiment in 1966 by Queen Elizabeth. Memorials Two stone cairns were erected on 6th Street in front of The Armouries dedicated with a copper plaque. The monument next to the 6th Street doors is to the memory of the Regiment's Victoria Cross recipients, Major John Keefer Mahony and Acting Corporal Filip Konowal. The monument on the corner of Queens and 6th is dedicated to The Royal Westminster Regiment. The copper plaques were stolen from the cairns by metal thieves and were eventually replaced with marble carvings. One of the original artillery pieces from The Armouries, RML 64-pounder 71-cwt Gun, mounted on a riveted iron carriage. The gun is from the lower deck of a British Man of War, from redundant stores of the Royal Navy Dockyard sent to Vicotira, in 1895. It stands to the right side of Queen‚Äôs Avenue entrance. The most recent addition is the Universal Carrier (often referred to as a Bren Gun Carrier) which is mounted the left side of the Queens Avenue entrance. Museum The Royal Westminster Regimental Museum is located in what was the original Gun Room. The a committee was organized in 1969 and the museum opened on 15 April 1973. The museum preserves the legacies of the military units that have served in New Westminster over the century. These units include the Westminster Volunteer Rifles, the Seymour Battery of Garrison Artillery, the 104th Westminster Fusiliers of Canada, the 47th and 131st Battalions CEF, the Westminster Regiment and The Royal Westminster Regiment. The military displays date back to 1863 include uniforms, medals, weapons and photographs documenting the history.

George Sand in 1838 The society shares its entrance with the Polish Library in Paris along the Quai d'Orleans In 1833 Science and Skills subcommittees were added, while in the period between 1838 and 1842 there was a Statistical section. In 1836 a History subcommittee was formed under chairman Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz, followed by Adam Mickiewicz (1841‚Äì1844), and whose de facto administrator was Karol Sienkiewicz. In 1851 the History subcommittee became independent as the 'Historical Society', (Towarzystwo Historyczne). By 1854 it had amalgamated again into the Historical and Literary Society (Towarzystwo Historyczno- Literackie, THL) and since that date has continuously occupied premises at 6, Quai d'Orleans on the Ile Saint-Louis. In 1838 the publications subcommittee, composed of Eustachy Januszkiewicz (business partner of the publisher, Aleksander Je≈Çowicki), Walerian Kalinka, Julian Klaczko, doubtless egged on by the tireless administrator, Karol Sienkiewicz, conceived the project of a Polish library in Paris. From 1856 a free-standing publishing committee prepared numerous editions of historical and literary works for publication. In the period 1866‚Äì1878 it published the 'Annals of the Historical and Literary Society', (Rocznik Towarzystwa Historyczno-Literackiego.) Allied to the society were periodicals such as: Kronika Emigracji Polskiej, Le Polonais, Wiadomo≈õci Polskie.

In 1886, Napoleon III granted the society the status of an 'Institution of Public Utility' under French law.https://www.mabpz.org/#3, website of the Standing Conference of Polish Museums, Archives and Libraries in the West (in Polish). Today the complexion and aims of the 400-member strong society are altered. Poland is again an independent though changed state within the European Union. The society meanwhile, is in French terms, a charitable trust and co-owner with the government funded Academy of Learning in Poland, of an enormously valuable and fragile and unique asset, which it helps to run and for which it needs to raise funds. The asset is composed of real-estate but above all, the 19th and 20th-century fragments that bear testimony to a country literally torn apart with no certainty as to its future self-determination. To get to its current position of responsibility, dating only since 2004, the society had to undergo a process of arbitration to reach heads of agreement with its partner owner. It contributes half the delegates that make up the governing council, otherwise known as the Association de la biblioth√®que polonaise de Paris which steers the Library collections and the complement of associated museums and art collections, under the umbrella of the Polish Library in Paris. The current chairman is the distinguished nuclear physicist, Professor Kazimierz Lubicz-Zaleski.http://www.bibliotheque-polonaise-paris- shlp.fr/medias/ORGANIGRAMME_2015_2.pdf ‚Äì this is the organisational chart of the Library, in French. =The Library= Professor C.P. Zaleski, chairman of the society (Fot. Mariusz Kubik) Faced with an existential threat to their centuries-old cultural heritage, Poles of the Great Emigration sought sanctuary in the country of their oldest ally, France. Paris became the undoubted fulcrum of Polish cultural life in exile. It hosted the continuing creativity and debate of a network of notable entrepreneurs, intellectuals, writers, musicians and artists and acted as a 'safe-deposit' for those items of national significance that could be saved and transported away from pillage and conflagration. That need was largely met in 1838, by the acquisition, from public fund-raising, of a building at 8, Quai d'Orleans on the Ile Saint- Louis, to house books and documents. It became the Biblioth√®que Polonaise de Paris ‚Äì the Polish Library in Paris, which is active to this day at the same address. In summary, a debating society that had taken on the biggest salvage operation it is possible to do, has become a lean board to steer the management of a heritage asset and a research institute that is also a purveyor of cultural events.Website of the Biblioth√®que Polonaise de Paris (in French).

Lyrics and music \\"I Am Waiting\\" was recorded between 6 and 9 March 1966 at RCA Studios in Hollywood, California. The song's lyrics are obscure. They have the singer \\"waiting for someone to come out of somewhere\\" but don't provide any details of the circumstances. According to Allmusic critic Richie Unterberger, this is not a problem since \\"enhancing the general mysterious atmosphere is more important than providing an answer.\\" Music critic Bill Janovitz suggests that the first verse sounds like singer Jagger is \\"tiptoeing as if in a game of hide and seek.\\" Janovitz suggests that the first refrain begins to suggest that the singer may not just be waiting for an actual person, but rather it suggests \\"a deepening perception...that promises to offset the paranoia in the lyrics\\" with the words \\"It happens all the time/It's censored from our minds.\\" Rolling Stones biographer Martin Elliot interprets the message of the lyrics as \\"don't fear the reaper.\\" The music of the song is one of several Rolling Stones songs from this period that shows Appalachian and English folk influences. As he does on \\"Lady Jane,\\" another song from Aftermath, Rolling Stones guitarist Brian Jones plays a dulcimer on \\"I Am Waiting.\\" Jack Nitzsche plays harpsichord. Bill Wyman's slow and \\"eerie\\" bassline and the acoustic guitars add to the effect. In the song's unusual structure, the refrains are louder and rock harder than the slow verses. In Janovitz's interpretation, the harder refrains permit Jagger to \\"vent the frustration\\" that has been built up through the verses. Author James Hector remarks that this allows the song to \\"[blow] hot and cold with remarkable subtlety\\" and Rolling Stones biographer Steve Appleford states that the eruptions in the refrains produce a \\"fine melodramatic effect\\" and allows the pop music of the verses to \\"explode into moments of yearning.\\" Reception Unterberger calls \\"I Am Waiting\\" a \\"very strange but musically attractive effort\\" that is a \\"highlight\\" among early Rolling Stones album tracks. Janovitx praises how the song combines Eastern thought that was popular in music during the mid-1960s with \\"broadening sonics and higher fidelity.\\" He states that Jagger \\"is singing with authority about fear, paranoia and a part of our minds closed from wider perception.\\" Hector calls the song \\"one of the band's most extra-ordinary mid-sixties compositions.\\" Author Jim Beviglia rates it as the Rolling Stones' #32 all- time greatest song, calling it a \\"wistful, wonderful track.\\" In 2012 the editors of Rolling Stone rated it the band's #67 all-time greatest song. On the other hand, Elliott does not regard it as being particularly strong, but states that it reflects the band's attitude at the time of \\"art for art's sake.\\" Other appearances \\"I Am Waiting\\" was used in Wes Anderson's 1998 film Rushmore. The band performed the song live on an episode of Ready Steady Go! in a performance that Rolling Stone described as \\"an image of the band maturing in real time.\\" References External links * The Rolling Stones songs 1966 songs Songs written by Jagger/Richards Song recordings produced by Andrew Loog Oldham ","title":"I Am Waiting (song)"},{"id":"51248237","text":"Doda Sodagar is a village in Sultanpur Lodhi tehsil in Kapurthala district of Punjab, India.

The surrounding area is known as Starabridge. Location and structure Stara Bridge is located west of the hamlet of Rillaton, in the parish of Linkinhorne in east Cornwall, east of the Devon border, and on the southern perimeter of Stara Woods. The east-west three-span bridge, part of a minor road, carries road traffic across the River Lynher. The bridge retains much of its original form and structure. It comprises three spans made of massive granite slabs termed 'clappers', supported at each end by the bridge abutments and above the river by two piers, with causeways linking the road to the bridge at either end. The western pier is to in width, whilst the eastern pier is to wide. Both have pointed cutwaters, much eroded on the east pier downstream, and are faced with large granite blocks, rough and weathered on the west pier, dressed and squared on the east pier. The three openings beneath the bridge vary from to wide and are roughly square in section. The abutments and causeways have masonry walls of roughly dressed granite and rubble. The bridge has a contemporary mettled road surface, between low parapets of granite block construction. The bridge, between abutments, is in length, and together with the western causeway and the length eastern causeway spans . At its centre the roadway is in width between parapets, and at the east end of the parapets, wide. The eastern causeway incorporates an 18th- century flood-water tunnel long, wide and high, with a granite slab roof and rubble masonry walls, draining a small floodplain situated to the north of the causeway. History The date of construction of the bridge is uncertain; Historic England suggest the late Middle Ages, a span of 200 years from 1301-1500. Stara Bridge was one of two clapper bridges serving the Manor of Rillaton, the head manor of the Rillaton Hundred, one of the Hundreds of Cornwall noted in the Domesday Book. The second bridge, possibly dating to 1155 or before, was downstream at Rilla Mill, but was demolished in the 1890s. Historic England argues that Stara Bridge must have been constructed at a time when Rillaton - now a hamlet of few houses - was still sufficiently locally important and wealthy enough to afford its construction; and the decline in the manorial system at the end of the Middle Ages points to a date prior to 1500. Historic England note also that the bridge stands as testament to the survival of medieval road patterns in the landscape, despite the utility of the bridge being greatly diminished by the bridge at Rilla Mill which forms the contemporary east-west route in the locality.

When she arrived at MIT in 1967, she was the first woman faculty member in the department. Her research focuses on the evolution and development of the immune system, using zebrafish as a model organism. Early life and education Steiner was born in Austria and left the country with her mother shortly before the Anschluss. She spend the rest of her childhood in Queens, New York. She won the well-known Westinghouse Science Talent Search competition as a high school student but chose to major in mathematics at Swarthmore College, where she received her bachelor's degree. Deterred from pursuing graduate school in math at Princeton University because the department did not admit women at the time, she instead attended Harvard University for a short time before deciding to change her career path by applying to medical school. She received her M.D. from Yale School of Medicine in 1959. She then worked as a postdoctoral fellow with Herman Eisen at the Washington University School of Medicine, where she began her research in immunology. Academic career Steiner was recruited to MIT in 1967 by Jack Buchanan, who headed the Division of Biochemistry within the biology department and was actively seeking out new young faculty. She has remained at MIT since and continues to maintain an active research program. Steiner was involved in efforts led by Nancy Hopkins and joined by Mary-Lou Pardue and others to study the effects of gender discrimination on women faculty at MIT and bring the problem to the attention of then-dean Charles Vest. Steiner received a Helen Hay Whitney Foundation fellowship to work with Eisen as a postdoctoral fellow and has continued her involvement with that organization, currently serving as its vice president. Research Steiner's research focuses on the evolution and development of the immune system in vertebrates, using as a model organism the zebrafish (Danio rerio). The group is particularly interested in early events in cellular differentiation defining the lymphocytic lineage, and in the development of the lymphoid organs. Steiner has also worked with the molecular genetics of the zebrafish immune system.

R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire media franchise: A Song of Ice and Fire - series of epic fantasy novels by the American novelist and screenwriter George R. R. Martin. A Song of Ice and Fire takes place on the fictional continents Westeros and Essos. The point of view of each chapter in the story is a limited perspective of a range of characters growing from nine, in the first novel, to thirty-one by the fifth. The works and their setting have inspired a large media franchise. Among the many derived works are several prequel novellas, a TV series, a comic book adaptation, and several card, board, and video games.  What type of thing is A Song of Ice and Fire?  A Song of Ice and Fire is an example of all of the following: * Fiction - form of narrative which deals, in part or in whole, with events that are not factual, but rather, imaginary and invented by its author(s). Although fiction often describes a major branch of literary work, it is also applied to theatrical, cinematic, and musical work. ** A series of novels - set or series of novels which share common themes, characters, or settings, but where each novel has its own title and free-standing storyline, and can thus be read independently or out of sequence. Novels are a form of fiction. ** Fantasy fiction - fiction genre that uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. *** High fantasy fiction - subgenre of fantasy, defined either by its setting in an imaginary world or by the epic stature of its characters, themes, and plot.Brian Stableford, The A to Z of Fantasy Literature, (p. 198), Scarecrow Press,Plymouth. 2005. *** a fantasy world - fictional setting comprising an entire planet, used in fantasy fiction, for example in novels and games. Typical worlds involve magic or magical abilities and often, but not always, either a medieval or futuristic theme. Some worlds may be an entirely independent world set in another universe. See World of A Song of Ice and Fire. ** a fictional setting - place that exists only in fiction and not in reality. Writers may create and describe such places to serve as the backdrop for their fictional works. *** a fictional universe - **** a constructed world - Developing an imaginary setting with coherent qualities such as a history, geography, and ecology is a key task for many science fiction and fantasy writers. Worldbuilding often involves the creation of maps, a backstory, and people for the world. Constructed worlds can enrich the backstory and history of fictional works, and can be created for personal amusement or for specific creative endeavors such as novels, video games, or role-playing games. * Intellectual property - creations of the mind, protected by copyright. Intangible assets, such as musical, literary, and artistic works. The first volume of the series, A Game of Thrones, was published (and copyrighted) in 1996. ** a media franchise - collection of media whereby intellectual property (IP) is licensed from an original work of media (usually a work of fiction), such as a film, a work of literature, a television program or a video game, to other parties or partners for commercial exploitation. A property can be exploited across a range of mediums and by a variety of industries for merchandising purposes. A Song of Ice and Fire has been marketed in the form of books, a television series, a comic book, games, etc. See franchises originating in literary works.

The most common adverse reactions are peripheral edema, nausea, fatigue, vomiting, dyspnea, and decreased appetite. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a disease in which malignant cancer cells form in the tissues of the lung. It is the most common type of lung cancer with up to 90% of all lung carcinomas falling into the non-small cell category. NSCLC occurs when healthy cells become abnormal and grow rapidly. One danger of this form of cancer is that there's a high likelihood that the cancer cells will spread from the lungs to other organs and body parts. Cancer metastasis consists of a sequential series of events, and MET exon 14 skipping is recognized as a critical event for metastasis of carcinomas. Mutations leading to MET exon 14 skipping are found in 3-4% of people with lung cancer. Capmatinib is the first therapy approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat non-small cell lung cancer with specific mutations (those that lead to mesenchymal-epithelial transition or MET exon 14 skipping).  Medical uses  Capmatinib is a kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of adults with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have a mutation that leads to mesenchymal- epithelial transition (MET) exon 14 skipping as detected by an FDA-approved test.  Adverse effects  Capmatinib can cause interstitial lung disease (a group of lung conditions that causes scarring of lung tissues), pneumonitis (inflammation of the lung tissue), hepatotoxicity (damage to liver cells), photosensitivity, and embryo-fetal toxicity. Based on a clear positive signal for phototoxicity in early laboratory studies in cells, people may be more sensitive to sunlight and should be advised to take precautions to cover their skin, use sunscreen, and not tan while taking capmatinib. Capmatinib may cause harm to a developing fetus or newborn baby. Pharmacology The substance inhibits c-Met, a tyrosine kinase that plays a role in embryonic development, organogenesis and wound healing, but also in the development of cancer.  History  Capmatinib was approved for medical use in the United States in May 2020, along with the FoundationOne CDx assay as a companion diagnostic for capmatinib. Efficacy was demonstrated in the GEOMETRY mono-1 trial (NCT02414139), a multicenter, non-randomized, open-label, multicohort study enrolling 334 participants with metastatic NSCLC with confirmed MET exon 14 skipping. Some participants were previously treated for their cancer and some were not (treatment-na√Øve). Participants received capmatinib 400 mg orally twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The efficacy was based on results from 97 of the participants. The trial was conducted at 92 sites in the United States, Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Lebanon, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Russia, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland, Spain, Taiwan and the UK. The major efficacy outcome measure was overall response rate (ORR), which reflects the percentage of participants that had a certain amount of tumor shrinkage. An additional efficacy outcome measure was duration of response (DOR). The efficacy population included 28 participants who had never undergone treatment for NSCLC and 69 previously treated participants. The ORR for the 28 participants was 68%, with 4% having a complete response and 64% having a partial response. The ORR for the 69 participants was 41%, with all having a partial response. Of the responding participants who had never undergone treatment for NSCLC, 47% had a duration of response lasting 12 months or longer compared to 32.1% of the responding participants who had been previously treated. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) processed the application under the accelerated approval program and granted the application for capmatinib priority review, orphan drug, and breakthrough therapy designations and granted the approval of Tabrecta to Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation.

Location and natural features Stara Woods is a woodland of circa located west of Rillaton and south of Bathpool in east Cornwall. The name derives from Stara Bridge, a medieval clapper bridge located at the south of the woods. It is made up of three discrete woods: Colquite Wood and Treovis Wood, deciduous woodlands dating back at least to the 17th century; and Broad Wood, a conifer plantation dating to the 1980s, and in process of being replanted with oak, beech and hazel. Treovis and Broad Woods lie on the southern and western oxbow valley of the River Lynher, facing north and east, whilst Colquite Wood is to the east of the river facing west and south; all at elevations from to circa above sea level. A tributary of the Lynher, Shales Brook, forms the northern boundary of Treovis Wood, and a leat which once supplied mills at Rilla Mill runs through all three woods. A 2013 suspension bridge crosses the Lynher linking Colquite and Broad Woods. Fauna in the woods include otters, brown long-eared bats and dormice. History The Friends of Stara Wood assert that the woodlands can be traced back to Manor of Carneddon, owned by Edward, the Black Prince in the 14th century. More recently, the woods were part of the Duchy of Cornwall estate of Botternell, until bought in 2004 by Anne Hughes, a local resident who remortgaged her house to cover the costs. Hughes has opened up permissive footpaths through the wood, and is working with volunteers to effect ecological and sustainable management of Stara Woods to provide an arts, environmental, educational and recreational resource for the area, whilst preserving its essential beauty and tranquillity.

Mowrer, who was 36-years old when he took office for his first term in 1974, became the youngest mayor in Bethlehem's history at the time. Mowrer's record as the city's youngest mayor held until Mayor Don Cunningham was sworn in 1998 at the age of 31. Nicknamed \\"Main Street Mayor\\", Mowrer is credited with the preservation of Bethlehem's historic downtown business district, which has now become a major tourist attraction for the city. During the 1970s, Mowrer eschewed the trend of demolishing older commercial buildings in favor of preserving Bethlehem's older structures. More recently, Mowrer, who returned to the Bethlehem city council in the 2000s, opposed the opening of a casino in Bethlehem following the legalization of slot machines by the government of Pennsylvania. Despite Mowrer's opposition, the casino was approved and the Sands Casino Resort Bethlehem opened in 2009. Biography =Early and personal life= Gordon Mowrer, the younger of two sons, was born in 1936 to Clifton and Margaret Mowrer. His father, Clifton, owned Mowrer's Dairy, a Bethlehem dairy farm. In 1929, Clifton Mowrer opened The Cup, which the family later sold. The Cup became a landmark ice cream parlor in the city. Mowrer enrolled at Dickinson College, but dropped out after a series of poor grades, which he attributed to too much time at fraternity parties. He enlisted in the United States Navy, which he credited with refocusing his life and work ethic. Mowrer re-enrolled at Dickinson College two years after leaving the school and soon earned a 3.5 G.P.A. and joined the wrestling team. He earned his bachelor's degree from Dickinson and found a job in the insurance industry. In 1960, Mowrer met his future wife, the former Mary Thaeler, a grad student and daughter of missionaries of the Moravian Church, on a blind date. However, Mary Thaeler was already engaged to another man at the time of their meeting. Mowrer successfully convinced Thaeler that she should choose him instead. Gordon and Mary Mowrer married at a ceremony in Nicaragua on December 29, 1960. They had three children, George, Ruthie and Meg. =Career= Mowrer began his political career by being elected to the Bethlehem city council during the 1960s. He was elected mayor in 1973 and sworn into office in 1974 at the age of 37, becoming the youngest mayor in the city's history at the time. Mayor Gordon Mowrer has been credited with the preservation of Bethlehem's historic downtown shopping district and its buildings. During his tenure, Mowrer reversed a prevailing urban renewal trend in which older buildings were demolished and replaced with modern, 1970s era structures. Mayor Mowrer planned and installed slate sidewalks and Victorian-style street lights On Main Street to match of the architectural style of the existing historic buildings in downtown. The improvements to the streetscape prompted store owners and property owners to renovate their storefronts, creating a neighborhood which was more attractive to businesses and investors. Mowrer's commitment to the historic preservation of the city's downtown earned him the nickname, \\"Main Street Mayor.\\" Downtown Bethlehem has grown into a major tourist and visitors attraction, a development which had been widely credited to Mowrer's efforts to preserve the neighborhood during the 1970s. Mowrer was seen as such a successful mayor that the Bethlehem city council, believing that he might govern the city for decades, passed a term limit law which limited Mower and his successors to two consecutive, four-year terms in office. However, the popular mayor was defeated for re-election in the 1977 mayoral primary by Paul Marcincin, a fellow Democrat, in a stunning political upset. He left office in 1978. Mowrer went back to college after his defeat and earned a master's degree in pastoral counseling. In 1992, he was ordained a pastor by the Moravian Church. He worked as a part-time chaplain at St. Luke's Hospital in Bethlehem for 28 years and held Young Life meeting, a nondenominational Christian ministry, at his home. (Future Bethlehem Mayor John B. Callahan met his wife, Mafalda, at Mowrer's Young Life gatherings). Additionally, Mowrer was a member of the board of directors for the Bethlehem chapter of the YMCA. Bethlehem city officials honored Mowrer with a plaque engraved with \\"Main Street Mayor\\" in February 2013. On June 25, 2016, Mowrer attended the Bethlehem 275th anniversary celebration, which was held at SteelStacks. Mowrer was suffering from Parkinson's disease, but according to former Mayor John Callahan, as past Mayors of Bethlehem were being introduced, \\"His back straightened, and his chin went up. His face brightened. The crowd was cheering for him. I watched him become Gordon Mowrer. It was an amazing moment.\\" Gordon Mowrer died on July 19, 2016, of complications of Parkinson's disease at the Moravian Village nursing home in Bethlehem at the age of 80. He had been in hospice care for the previous week and a half.

It is located near the Iraq‚ÄìTurkey border in the district of Amadiya and the historical region of Barwari. In the village, there is a church of Mar Gewargis, and the ruins of the monastery of Mar Qayyoma. There was previously two shrines dedicated to Mart Maryam and Mar Apius and four cemeteries. Etymology It is suggested that the name of the village is derived from \\"d≈´rum\\" (\\"fortress\\" in Akkadian). History The remains of a fortress nearby Dooreh have been dated to the early period of Assyria in the late third millennium BC, and likely inspired the village's name. The monastery of Mar Qayyoma was founded in the 4th-century AD, and the church of Mar Gewargis was first constructed in 909. The monastery of Mar Qayyoma is first mentioned in the mentioned in the 10th-century Life of Rabban Joseph Busnaya, and had become the seat of the Nestorian diocese of Barwari by 1610. Dooreh itself is mentioned in a manuscript of 1683. In 1850, 20-40 Nestorian families inhabited Dooreh, and were served by two functioning churches and four priests. Prior to the First World War, Dooreh was populated by 200 Assyrians, who were forced to flee under the leadership of Agha Petros to the vicinity of Urmia in Iran, amidst the Assyrian genocide. Whilst in Iran, 90 villagers died, and 30 women and children were either killed or abducted, and the survivors were settled at the refugee camp at Baqubah in 1918. After residing there for two years, 90 people eventually returned to Dooreh. Dooreh was temporarily deserted again in the early 1930s due to the conflict between the Turkish government and the Kurdish Emir of Barwari. 35 families inhabited the village in 1938, and the population of Dooreh was recorded as 296 people in 1957. At the onset of the First Iraqi‚ÄìKurdish War in 1961, 75 families in 40 houses resided at Dooreh, and the village was damaged by a napalm attack during the war in 1968. Despite this damage, the population increased to 100 families in 75 houses by 1978, in which year on 8 August the village was destroyed by the Iraqi government, and much of its population was forcibly resettled at Batifa. The village's destruction was total, as all houses, churches, farms, and orchards were obliterated. In the aftermath of the 1991 uprisings in Iraq, 30 families returned to Dooreh, and the church of Mar Gewargis was rebuilt in 1995 with support from the Evangelical-Lutheran Church in W√ºrttemberg. By 2011, the Supreme Committee of Christian Affairs had constructed 37 houses and a hall, and the village was inhabited by 250 adherents of the Assyrian Church of the East in the following year. Dooreh was struck by Turkish airstrikes on 1 September 2018 as part of the Kurdish‚ÄìTurkish conflict. Notable people *Margaret George Shello (1942‚Äì1969), Assyrian militant.

Its provisions have come up for discussion in the Supreme Court in a number of cases and the case of Ram Krishna Dalmia vs Justice S R Tendolkar reiterated its meaning and scope as follows. Article 14 permits classification, so long as it is 'reasonable', but forbids class legislation. A classification of groups of people is considered reasonable when: # The classification is based upon intelligible differentia that distinguishes persons or things that are grouped from others that are left out of the group, and, # The differential has a rational relation with the objective of the act. In addition, the classification must be non-arbitrary. Supreme Court in E. P.

The church knew its zenith in the late 19th century because of artistic activity in the city due to the patronage of the local entrepreneurs of wool, paper and steel. During the Spanish Civil War, it was vandalized and became municipal property. Inexplicably, it was decided to demolish it. After the war, it was decided to build a new church in the likeness of the former.

She discovered that the fish species Hoplostethus atlanticus can live to over 100 years old, leading to significant changes to the management of the species. Early life and education Fenton grew up in Australia, the daughter of two scientists. Her mother was a zoologist and her father was a cosmic ray and aurora physicist who worked with the Australian Antarctic Division during the 1950s. She completed a science degree with Honours at the University of Tasmania on coastal krill from south- eastern Australia and southern New Zealand. She continued her work at the University of Tasmania as part of a PhD focused on mysid crustaceans, discovering three new genera and 12 new species, graduating in 1986 at the age of 24. Career and impact Fenton's post-doctoral work at the University of Tasmania resulted in the development of a technique to age fish based on the radioactive decay of radium-226 to lead-210. This revolutionized the understanding of the age of the important fishery species, orange roughy. Her work revealed that this species is extremely slow-growing, not maturing until between 20 and 25 years of age, with significant implications for sustainable management of catch limits for the species. Fenton joined the Tasmanian Government in marine environmental management and policy development in 1996. In her role she developed environmental monitoring programs for Tasmanian salmon farms, developed ballast water policy and provided advice on marine infrastructure developments. In 2003 she joined the Australian Antarctic Division as the Manager of Science Planning and Coordination. In 2015 Fenton became the first female Chief Scientist of the Australian Antarctic Division. Her role includes reviewing the Antarctic Science Strategic Plan and strengthening collaborations with East Antarctic partners such as China, India, Japan and France. She will also be working to ensure that the science program is ready to take advantage of the expanded capability that will come with the launch of Australia's new icebreaker in 2020.
