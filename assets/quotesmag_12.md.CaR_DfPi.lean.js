Currently, the CADE 2 solution is being developed to deliver a modern tax processing system to the IRS.  Development  Development of CADE was first discussed in 2000 in the IRS Modernization Plan, with an original operational date of November 1, 2006. Programming and development began in 2003, but actual processing on the system was delayed until 2005.IRS Delays Key Technology Program Until 2004 Filing Season The system initially processed only 1040EZ tax returns, the simplest type of electronic tax returns. In 2006, the capacity was increased for the system to begin processing a limited number of more complex 1040 forms and other support forms. In 2007, the system began to process Schedule C forms and other more complex tax forms. Because the system is unable to handle the full load of IRS tax returns, a hybrid approach is used by the IRS, where the majority of tax returns are still processed with the existing, older system. Current loads and tax returns processed by CADE are used for testing purposes to verify system functionality.IRS CADE Processing System Tops 15 Million Tax Returns The CADE system, although beset by regular setbacks, such as funding, was previously expected to be fully operational by 2012, but is now targeted for 2018-2020. Basic CADE functionality includes: * Ability to change client addresses manually * Process Married Filing Jointly & Separately without dependents (Married Once) returns * Process ‚ÄúClean‚Äù Dependents (Dependents that are clearly legitimate) returns * Process Head-of-Household without Dependents or with ‚ÄúClean‚Äù Dependents returns * Process Annual Archiving of tax returns * Process Limited Name Changes on Tax Returns * Process 1040 Schedules A, B, and R * Process 1040A Schedules 1, and 3 * Ability to match tax return data to Social Security Administration (SSA) information for verification. * Ability to interface with and update Census Bureau statistics * Process 1040 Schedules C, E & F w/o EIN supporting forms, including Sch. SE * Process 1040 Schedule D and supporting forms  Benefits  =Benefits to the Public= CADE will increase the speed of tax return processing. Under the current system, processing tax returns can take as long as one week and taxpayers have to wait between 14‚Äì35 days for the IRS to deposit their refund or mail them a check. Using CADE, tax returns will be generally completed within 24 hours and deposits issued within 48‚Äì72 hours. Check mailing times have not yet been determined, but there is expected to be at least a one-week wait. =Benefits to the IRS= The purpose of CADE is to replace the current IRS processing and database system that the IRS has been using since 1969. CADE should provide superior security and advanced processing techniques.Customer Account Data Engine 2.2 CADE will be capable of superior security and fraud protection mechanisms with automated detection of tax return errors and inconsistencies. This will be done in part by interfacing with other government systems to verify information. CADE will also provide superior in-house functionality for the IRS to access information, reports, compliance issues, notices, and revenue accounting. The system also provides superior internal security by logging information accessed by IRS employees. =Compatibility= CADE is planned to eventually interface with the following IRS and governmental database systems for enhanced tracking and reporting: * Refund Information File (RFIF) * Questionable Refund Program/Refund Interest Program/Electronic Tax Administration (QRP/RIP/ETA) * Duplicate Direct Deposit (DDD) * Statistics of Income (SOI) * 701 Exec, Microfilm Replacement System (MRS) * IMF Weekly Reports * Return to CPE and IMF * Taxpayer Address Request (TAR) ‚Äì Legacy Account Formatted File (LAFF) Summary * Corporate Files Online (CFOL) * Interim Revenue Accounting Control System (IRACS) Recap Data * Interim Revenue Accounting Control System (IRACS) Refund Data * Financial Management Information Systems (FMIS) * Reciprocal Accounting Control Record (RACR) * Individual Master Files (IMF) * Electronic Certification System (ECS) * Microfilm Replacement System (MRS) * Individual Return Transaction File Online (IRTFOL) * Return Transaction File (RTF) * Refund Timeliness Program (RTP) * Enterprise System Management (ESM) * Taxpayer Account Transcripts * Send to Current Processing Environment (CPE) * LARS-format Balance and Control Data * Balancing Reports * Security Administration System (SAS) Reports * Service Center Input Processing Automation System (SCIPAS) Reports * Accountability Acceptance Vouchers (AAV) Reports * Obligation Balance Validation Reports * Weekly Obligation Balance Data * CADE Initialization to IMF * IMF Annual Conversion * CPE for Address Change ‚Äì this information goes to the following CPE systems: ** Enhanced Entity Index File (EEIF) ** Key Index File (KIF) ** Name Search File (NSF) ** National Account Profile (NAP) ** Address Error Report * CADE R2CPE Reports * CPE for Discriminant Index Function (DIF) Processing * Social Security Administration Self Employment Data * US Census Bureau Economic Data (Census)  Impact on industry CADE is expected to impact the tax preparation and tax bank product industry in a significant way. By enabling deposits to be made within 72 hours, the new system will render refund anticipation loans obsolete. It is also expected to greatly increase the demand for e-file. The only setback will be for taxpayers who do not have established bank accounts to receive direct deposit. The wait time for checks by mail will still be a minimum of one week.

Monuments Boer War monument in Central Memorial Park.The sculptor was Louis Philippe H√©bert, who also did the Indian family grouping in front of the Legislature in Quebec City. The death of an English soldier in Calgary led to the creation of the South African War Memorial. Quebec sculptor, Louis Phillipe H√©bert, was visiting his cousins, the Miquelon family in Calgary, at the turn of the century when they came upon the body of a soldier in a ditch in the Killarney area. It seems he had died from lead poisoning and no one had known about his illness. Members of the Calgary-based Lord Strathcona Horse Regiment who had fought in the South African Boer War (1899 - 1902) took up a collection and efforts were made to trace his family in England. It was decided that the men who fought in the war should be commemorated and H√©bert said, \\"I'll put up a statue taller than your trees.\\" Further funds were raised and H√©bert was commissioned to create a statue in 1911. It was unveiled in 1914. Standing on the steps of Sacred Heart Church, H√©bert spotted Eneas McCormick, then in his early twenties, and thought he would make a good model for the statue.

Boyle was known for his contributions at Ypres, several years after the Second Boer War. Russell Lambert Boyle, was born on October 29, 1880. Although Colonel Boyle served in South Africa as a Sergeant, he is better known for his courageous exploits during the Second Battle of Ypres, where he led the 10th Battalion, CEF in its first action at Kitchener's Wood. He died of wounds on April 25, 1915.) The statue of R.L. Boyle is unusual in that his name is not inscribed on the monument. Rather than memorializing him personally, the statue is intended as a tribute to all Albertans who fought in the Second Boer War, and the dates 1899-1902 are inscribed on the pedestal. The Cenotaph was formally dedicated and unveiled by the Lieutenant Governor of Alberta, His Honour Dr. W. G. Egbert, on November 11, 1928. The Calgary Herald estimated the crowd at this event to be 10,000 with at least 75 wreaths laid. In addition, a pair of granite benches accompanied the Cenotaph. The bench on the south side was inscribed \\"May we live as nobly as they died\\" while the north bench's inscription was: \\"Pass not in sorrow, but with pride.\\" There is also a statue outside the Memorial Park branch of the Calgary Public Library at the park's eastern end of a First World War era soldier, erected by the Imperial Order of the Daughters of the Empire after the war.http://www.calgary.ca/CSPS/Parks/Pages/Locations/Downtown-parks/Central- Memorial-Park.aspx Activities An annual, civic, wreath laying commemorating Remembrance Day occurs each November 11 with The Calgary Highlanders conducting a Unit parade and ceremony of remembrance at which many organizations and civilians pay their respects.

Biography  Francesco, nicknamed Cicco, was born in Caccuri, Calabria, and received a fine education. He studied Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and other languages and graduated in civil and canonic law, presumably in Naples. As a young man, he entered the service of the Sforza family as a secretary to condottiero Francesco Sforza and rapidly rose to the top of the administration. He was soon placed in charge of the city of Lodi. In 1441, Francesco Sforza married Bianca Maria Visconti (1425‚Äì1468), the illegitimate daughter of Filippo Maria Visconti, 3rd Duke of Milan. On Filippo's death (1447), the so-called Ambrosian Republic had been set up in Milan by the patrician families. In 1450, Francesco Sforza, backed by the Venetians, laid siege to Milan to combat the aristocrats. The city surrendered after eight months and Francesco made himself Capitano del popolo. He was proclaimed duke by the people and by right of his wife. Simonetta was nominated \\"golden knight\\" and entered the ducal chancellery. This appointment was the beginning of his undisputed domination of the political situation for thirty years. As a reward for his services, he was given the fief of Sartirana, in Lomellina, which he administered with competency and care. He soon became a member of the Secret Council. When he married Elisabetta Visconti in 1452 his fame was widespread. In 1456, he received the honorary citizenship of Novara, which was later followed by those of Lodi and Parma. In 1465, he wrote the Constitutiones et Ordines as a contribution to a better organization of the chancellery, over which he now had complete control. At the death of Francesco Sforza (1466) his son Galeazzo Maria succeeded him. His mother Bianca Maria and the other influential families did not approve of his capricious conduct of state affairs, but Simonetta sided with Galeazzo. Simonetta Family Coat of Arms In 1474 Simonetta wrote his Rules for Decrypting Enciphered Documents Without a Key, presumably for use by his collaborators, although no evidence exists of actual utilization of these rules in the field. In 1476, Galeazzo was assassinated and was succeeded by his 7-year-old son Gian Galeazzo. His tutor was his mother, Bona of Savoy. In this period of unrest, Simonetta's diplomatic activity was intense. He maneuvered to maintain stability in the Milanese state during the endemic conflicts between Guelphs, Ghibellines and the various wars and interstate alliances. The next year he became ducal secretary, with the powers of a prime minister. Simonetta's power provoked the hatred of Ludovico il Moro (1452‚Äì1508), one of the younger brothers of Galeazzo, who plotted to seize the duchy. The main obstacle to his project was the presence of Simonetta in the city government. After many personal vicissitudes, Ludovico managed to gain the confidence of the duchess and convinced her to arrest Simonetta. He was accused falsely of treason, imprisoned, and tortured in Pavia. His house and assets were pillaged, and he was beheaded in the tower of the castle. His body was buried in the cloister of Sant‚ÄôApollinare, outside the Milan city walls, to mark the end of his influence in the Milanese politics. Manuscript of the Rules, BNF codex 1595. During the Sforza rule, the duchy had enjoyed years of prosperity and great expansion despite the political turmoil. Important buildings were erected in the cities; the farming of rice and the silk industry were introduced in agriculture. With the advent of printing Milan had become a cultural center unequaled in all Europe, until it fell into foreign hands after the death of Ludovico il Moro. Presently a fragment of his tombstone and the name of a narrow street in Milan are the only visible testimonials of Simonetta.  Decrypting rules  Simonetta has been described in the cryptological literature as an important cryptanalyst in consideration of his rules. His work is in reality a collection of hints for solving ciphers that were rather old-fashioned at that time. Contemporary cipher clerks were well equipped to defy the tricks he described. Nomenclators were in general use, combining small codebooks and large substitution tables with homophones and nulls. His cipher-breaking rules are applicable to dispatches with word divisions, without homophones, nulls or code words. He says nothing of polyalphabetic substitution or the existence of nomenclators. His notes were anticipated by Leon Battista Alberti in his theoretical, but more comprehensive, treatise De Cifris, which earned him the title of Father of Western Cryptology. It was only a century later that a scientific treatise entirely devoted to cryptanalysis was written by the French mathematician Fran√ßois Vi√®te. Simonetta might have been involved in cipher work in his early career, but no evidence of such activity has been found.

Under the stage name Stan Hasselgard he made his acclaimed recording of Swedish Pastry, and in 1948 he joined Benny Goodman's septet, alongside Wardell Gray, Mary Lou Williams and others. His last recording session occurred on November 18, 1948; on November 23 he was killed in a car crash outside the city of Decatur in Illinois, still only 26. He was buried in the family plot of District Judge John Larson (1883-1962) in Bolln√§s churchyard. Larson had become Hasselg√•rd's stepfather when his mother remarried in 1929, six years after she had been widowed.

History  Pueyrred√≥n Station The district's name originated from a station of the Central Argentine Railway (today part of the Mitre Line) called \\"km 14\\". In 1907, it received the name of \\"Pueyrred√≥n\\" in honour of the illustrious Brigadier Juan Mart√≠n de Pueyrred√≥n. Since the railroad provided the area with its main transportation connections, the station became the neighbourhood's official namesake, and \\"Villa Pueyrred√≥n\\" was established in 1923. The population in this neighbourhood was established by European settlers, principally Italian and Spanish, as well as Lebanese, all of whom arrived in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to be employed at the \\"great railway project\\" (the most important in Latin America). The large number and variety of small businesses established by these communities gave the neighborhood a very particular and ethnically diverse character.  Parks and Squares  This neighborhood has several green spaces, the oldest of which is Leandro N. Alem Square (inaugurated on 25 May 1921). Alem Square is located between Larsen, Artigas, Zamudio, and Cochrane Streets. The General Eduardo Lonardi Square has a very irregular outline, measuring . It is located between the streets of Obispo San Alberto, Ladines, Jose L. Cabez√≥n, Gral. Jos√© G. de Artigas, and the tracks of the Mitre Railroad. It has a notable illuminated and decorative fountain in the shape of a staggered pyramid. Located on the street of Albarellos, Club Cultural y Deportivo 17 de Agosto is a football club founded in 1949. It is the most important club of the neighborhood and takes part in the First Division of Futsal's Championship (Argentine) AFA. Club Social Pueyrred√≥n was founded on 1 June 1927, and is located at 5540 Condarco St. The Social, Cultural and Sports Club Gloria was established on 16 September 1936. Initially, it was located on Gabriela Mistral Street; it was subsequently relocated to 4970 Caracas St.  Notable natives  * Roberto DeVicenzo: Golfer of international reputation. * Marcelo Alexandre: Cyclist. * V√≠ctor Avedano: boxer. * Alejandro Sabella, Federico Vairo, Carlos Veglio, Francisco Scagliotta: soccer players. * Teresa Blasco: actress. * Enrique Alejandro Mancini: Radio and Television host. * Roberto Rufino: tango singer at Carlos Di Sarli and An√≠bal Troilo Orchestra. * Gloria D√≠az: Tango singer. * Eduardo Gelaz: Tango singer. * Juan Carlos Copes: Tango dancer. * Miguel Mateos: Rock Musician. * Luis Rubio: Humorist, famous with his character Eber Ludue√±a. * Roxana Callegari: tango dancer. * Fabian Belmonte: tango dancer - bandoneonista.

Luckie II was a Democratic member of the Ohio House of Representatives, representing the 39th District since his appointment in 2006 until his decision to withdraw from the race for re-election in 2012, culminating with his replacement in January 2013. In August 2012, Luckie announced that he would not seek re-election to this position in the 2012 election, following the news that he was under criminal investigation on an undisclosed matter, one stated only to be \\"something other than bribery.\\" In October 2012, it was revealed that Luckie was under investigation by and had surrendered to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for felony and misdemeanor charges involving political corruption, including misuse of campaign funds and theft in office. The two candidates that were seeking Luckie's current House of Representatives position were Fred Strahorn (Democrat), a former state senator, and Jeff Wellbaum (Republican), a decorated Iraq War veteran.Wellbaum Campaign Site In the November 2012 election, Fred Strahorn won the position, with over 80% of the vote, the voting district in question traditionally being heavily Democratic. Luckie plead not guilty to the charges and was released on bond. It was reported that Luckie suffered an undisclosed health issue while being booked into jail. He was taken a hospital, treated, and released. When asked for a statement by the media, he replied \\"no comment.\\" Despite not having attended any state functions since July 9, 2012, Luckie continued to receive a paycheck as he waited out his final months in office. A number of officials had called for his resignation. Had Luckie resigned, a placeholder would have been required to fill his position, as the elected Strahorn was not legally allowed to do so until his official term began. On December 20, 2012, it was announced that Luckie would stand trial beginning on January 22, 2013 if no plea bargain could be worked out. His term officially ended on January 7, 2013, with the swearing in of Fred Strahorn. On January 21, 2013, Luckie officially agreed to a plea deal on nine charges. In 2019, Luckie was sentenced to four months in jail after pleading guilty in a mail fraud case described as being part of a federal investigation into a great \\"culture of corruption\\" within the city of Dayton. Background Luckie graduated from Chaminade Julienne High School in Dayton. He then earned an associate degree from Sinclair Community College and a bachelor's degree from The Ohio State University. After graduating from the Ohio State University where he volunteered for both his local state representative C.J. McLin and former Speaker Vern Riffe, Luckie served as a member of the Dayton School Board from 1996‚Äì2006. He also worked for National City Bank and then the Montgomery County Community Development Office. He currently serves as Marketing and Sales Director of JEC Paper and Related Products, one of the nation‚Äôs largest minority-owned companies. Luckie lives in Dayton in the Wright-Dunbar Historic District and is divorced, with two children. Ohio House of Representatives While Luckie had initially filed to run for the seat held by term-limited Dixie Allen, his ascension to the Statehouse was expedited when Allen switched to the Republican Party and subsequently resigned her seat to run for Montgomery County Commissioner. Although the seat was vacant, Democrats waited until after the 2006 general election to officially seat Luckie, who took his seat on November 14, 2006. He was easily reelected in 2008, as well as in 2010. For the 127th General Assembly, Luckie served as Third Vice President of the Ohio Legislative Black Caucus, as well as treasurer of the OLBC Foundation. For the 128th General Assembly, Speaker of the House Armond Budish named Luckie Chairman of the Ohio Controlling Board, and Vice Chairman of the House Education Committee. He also served as OLBC Foundation secretary. In the 129th General Assembly, Luckie was Montgomery County's most senior state legislator, and served on the committees of Education (as ranking member), and Insurance. He also served as a member of the Controlling Board; the Education Management Information System Advisory Board; the Governor‚Äôs Advisory Board of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives; the State Regional Alliance Advisory Board; and the Ohio Accountability Task Force. Initiatives and positions A former member of the Dayton School Board, Luckie was a key player in education reform. He advocated for the benefits of a longer school year, stating it would help students to better retain information. \\"Many kids lose what they have learned through the year in the summertime. By having a longer school (year) would keep that review time down.\\" Additionally, legislation that would change district financial reporting requirements from a five-year forecast to a three-year one might also be amended. He said he favored the idea of a five- year forecast because it allows legislators to be able to see how changes to law will affect schools going forward. Luckie has also been an opponent of a plan to allow more vouchers for charter schools, stating that he believes allowing for it would dilute the success of all types of schools across the board. Luckie has also voice opposition to allowing charter schools, STEM schools and Catholic schools to be provided with public school transportation when those schools schedule to make up ‚Äúcalamity days.‚Äù He described it as an unfunded mandate, and has stated that all Democrats would more than likely support the bill if it wasn't for the transportation language. With a bill requiring a photo ID to cast a ballot passed in three days through the Ohio House of Representatives, Luckie stated that it was the same as a ‚Äúmodern day poll tax.‚Äù Luckie feels that the legislation could disenfranchise African American voters at the polls. After the release of a man who was convicted of a rape he did not commit, Luckie has encouraged the state to conduct more DNA testing, stating too many individuals are found guilty by association or are in the wrong place at the wrong time. Felony investigation On October 10, 2012, it was officially revealed that Luckie was under investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and was escorted by F.B.I. agents to jail after turning himself in to their office in Columbus, Ohio. Luckie was charged with 45 felony offenses and 4 misdemeanors. The felony charges included Engaging in a Pattern of Corrupt Activity, Theft in Office, Money Laundering and Forgery. The four misdemeanors were related to the filing of false financial disclosure statements. Had he been convicted on the most serious charge, Engaging in a Pattern of Corrupt Activity, also known as a RICO charge, he faced a maximum of eleven years in prison. Luckie was slated to stand trial beginning on January 22, 2013. Ron O‚ÄôBrien, prosecutor for Franklin County, Ohio had stated that talks for a plea bargain were ongoing, but the state was ready to go to trial should a deal not be worked out. A representative for Luckie, when asked why Luckie had not stepped down from his position, stated that \\"...the presumption of innocence has to be paramount.\\" =Plea deal= On January 21, 2013, Luckie agreed to a deal to plead guilty to seven felonies, one misdemeanor, and an additional count of grand theft, in exchange for the dismissal of the remainder of the charges. On January 22, 2013, he was sentenced to three years in prison, three years on probation and ordered to pay back the salary he took during the time between when he was indicted and when his term ended. He was eligible for early release in six months, depending on his continued cooperation with the F.B.I. investigation. On January 24, 2013, it was reported that Luckie had potentially tried to claim mileage reimbursement for an unused parking pass during the time that he was under investigation and that the Franklin County Prosecutor was weighing the possibility of additional charges after seeking more information. Luckie applied for early release in April 2014, but the request was denied, as it was felt that his actions were \\"egregious violations of the public trust.\\" Luckie was also barred from running for any public office for five years. In March 2015, Luckie again applied for early release, but the request was again denied by the same judge, who felt that \\"release at this time would demean the seriousness of the offenses.\\" Luckie's three-year sentence ended in 2016. Following this, Luckie was seen attended a meeting of the board of Dayton Public Schools in which the stabbing of a student attending one of the district's elementary schools was discussed. Corruption In 2019, Luckie was one of several public officials indicted in regards to a Federal investigation into a \\"culture of corruption\\" in Dayton, OH. On July 2, 2019, Luckie plead guilty to a single charge of mail fraud, facing anywhere from 0 to 20 years in prison. In November 2019, Luckie was sentenced to four months in prison followed by three years of supervised release, with the first four months served in home detention. The sentence was said by his attorney to come as a shock to Luckie, who had argued for probation. The judge in the case, Thomas M. Rose, stated that \\"This is the kind of activity that the community needs protection from. A community cannot tolerate an individual that takes advantage of programs that are set for the purposes of good.\\" The sentence also includes 100 hours of community service, and under the terms of his plea deal, Luckie cannot appeal the sentence. U.S. Assistant Attorney Brent Tabacchi stated that Luckie's being sent to jail in the first conviction in the wider case sends a message. The judge expressed frustration during sentencing, stating that Luckie had a good childhood, a good family life and was a good parent, highly educated with minimal health concerns. Thus, he did not understand why he acted the way he did, other than that he could. On November 26, Luckie wrote a letter requesting a pardon from U.S. President Donald Trump for his actions, stating \\"Bottom line. If you care about the minority community this would be a good example to show a pardon\\" and that \\"The only thing I was guilty on was not making sure my paperwork was completed. ... Being black in America, you have to do what you have to do to survive.\\" In December 2019, Luckie submitted a motion with the court to stay his sentence and later a motion to grant appeal, alleging that prosecutors withheld information that would have exonerated him. As part of his plea deal, Luckie had waived his right to appeal, except in the case of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel or prosecutorial misconduct. On January 15, 2020, the appeals court dismissed Luckie's appeal of his sentence as untimely and denied a motion to stay his sentence.

About Bournville 100px Bournville is a friendly learning community school set in the leafy suburb of Bournville in Birmingham. The school encourages students to fulfil their potential both academically and socially in order to maximise their opportunities in their adult lives. The school has around 850 pupils currently on the roll, including a primary provision of around 150 students. The School became an Academy School on 1 November 2014 under the sponsorship of The Fairfax Multi Academy Trust (FMAT)The Fairfax Multi Academy Trust (FMAT) Fairfax School is also in the same MAT. History Before Bournville became a comprehensive school in the 1970s it was previously two sibling grammar schools: Bournville Girls Grammar School and Bournville Grammar-Technical School For Boys, previously known as Bournville Boys Technical School. The technical school for boys, the city's first technical school, opened in October 1955. The technical school later combined with the girls' grammar school on the same site, and its current full title is Bournville School and Sixth Form Centre: a Business, Enterprise and Music College. =Beginnings= Originally designed and built as two separate schools, the first to be opened was Bournville Girls' Grammar School adjacent to the A38 Bristol Road South south of Bournville village in autumn 1954, housed in a modern building. One year later, in September 1955, Bournville Boys' Technical School was also opened at the top end of the same site, together with the separate and brand new two-storey dining room and a purpose- built technical block between the two school buildings. The twin schools shared the main playing field, with timetables arranged so that activities of the two schools did not clash. The tennis courts were under the control of the girls' school and were not available to the boys' school, except by special arrangement at the weekends. The establishment of Technical Grammar schools was a government initiative under the Tripartite Educational System, originally mapped out in the Education Act 1944 to encourage the development of the skilled senior and middle management engineers, scientists and technicians then needed by UK industry and science, to replace those lost during World War II. The new specialist schools were intended to form a bridge between the academic and classical learning practised by traditional grammar schools and the more practical and vocational training that formed the basis of the secondary modern schools. The new school's timetable ensured that through years seven to nine the traditional academic subjects were fully covered, while in years ten onwards academic studies reduced and more time was spent on the more technical subjects of chemistry, physics, woodwork, metalwork and technical drawing. The boys' school forged close ties with local industrial and scientific concerns and, in return for cash sponsorship of materials and occasional teaching support by their specialists and foremen, those engineering businesses enjoyed first call on qualified pupils when they left school. The boys' school was organised along 'Public School' lines with four houses‚ÄîBelmont, Griffin, Manor and Woodlands‚Äîand each of the three forms were divided equally between the four houses. Later Griffin House was disbanded, leaving Belmont (later in the 1970s, Ashdown), Manor (Sherborne) and Woodlands (Packwood) that also became the names of three forms in each year, from first to fifth. Belmont, Manor and Woodlands were named after three large mansions that stood in the area during the 19th century, and Griffin was named after the nearby brook. The original \\"house\\" system was disbanded when the schools combined and became comprehensive and mixed. =Segregation= During the early years there were no female teachers at the boys' school and only two male teachers at the girls' school. Great efforts were made by the teachers of both schools to keep the boys and girls from becoming distracted by interacting with each other. Lunchtime timetables were arranged so that the girls had the first two sittings and the boys were not allowed into the dining room building until it had been vacated. Sports activities on the sports field took place at different times and even at the end of the school day the girls' grammar school was dismissed fifteen minutes earlier. The only joint activities during the 1950s were occasional joint theatrical and musical productions and an after school ballroom dancing society in the boys' school hall, all of which were closely supervised by the teachers. \\"Club Griffin\\" school dances in the 1960s and 1970s were mixed and very popular. A Mrs Cotton was the first Head Mistress at the Girls school when the school opened, a strict disciplinarian. =Sport and recognition= Boys and girls of all ages were required to wear a school uniform and cap for the boys and beret for the girls when travelling to or from school and on school trips. The wearing of caps was made non-compulsory after summer 1968. Team sports played were rugby and basketball in winter and cricket in summer. Teams competed in the Birmingham grammar school leagues at all age groups. The boys also had a swimming team and an athletics team. The girls' school played netball and hockey in winter and tennis in summer. Both schools held an annual cross- country race. Entry was compulsory for all pupils, who also had to complete at least three after-school practice runs over the full course in the weeks preceding the race, with teachers placed on every corner to ensure nobody dropped out or took shortcuts. =After school activities= After school there were a large number of school clubs and societies organised and run by both teachers and senior pupils and everybody was encouraged to join at least one or more. Every night of the week the extracurricular activities took place in classrooms all over both schools. There was a historical society, chess club, ballroom dancing society, geography club, film society, drama club, choral society, science club, astronomy society and the poetry club. The girls' grammar additionally had knitting and sewing clubs, cookery club, a small string orchestra and a ballet society. =Two schools become one= Entry to both schools in the early years had been by Eleven plus examination with both schools selecting only those pupils who had achieved the highest scores in the area's feeder schools. However, under government Circular 10/65, implemented by Birmingham's local education authority, the 11+ examination was scrapped along with the tripartite system of grammar, technical grammar and secondary modern schools, to be replaced by a comprehensive system. The Bournville schools combined and became a joint comprehensive, switching to coeducational mixed education in September 1973. The twin schools' teaching staffs combined under a single management structure with a single head teacher. The original Girls Grammar school building became the 'lower school' facility and the Boys Grammar at the top end of the site became 'upper school'. The combined School has continued to maintain a reputation for excellence in the Selly Oak, Bournville and Northfield catchment areas. The former Boys School is now the upper school, called The Charlotte Bront√´ Building, and the former Girls school is now the lower school, called The Edward Elgar Building. There is also an Annex to the Elgar building (previously the Science Annex), housing one Science Lab and a Resistant Materials Workshop. What was previously the Craft Block (for metalwork, pottery, and woodwork) is now called The William Morris Building, while the Dining Hall block is now called The Keynes Building, housing a single story dining hall with the Sixth form centre and ICT classrooms. The Bournville Business Centre is within the Charlotte Bront√´ Building. =Recent history= In May 2011 the head teacher wrote to parents and carers that a sub-group of Governors had been considering becoming an Academy, and that the Governing Body had agreed to move on to the next stage of the Academy process which is to begin talks with the DFE and go to formal consultation with everyone involved. Following a Governing Body meeting on 12 October 2011 the decision was made not to proceed with Academy Status for the time being as it was felt that the school was not yet ready for such a significant change. The school was placed into Special measures in late October 2013, following an Ofsted inspection. An IEB (Interim Executive Board) was put into place made up of experienced governors appointed by the Department of Education from recommendations by Birmingham City Council. The role of the IEB was to ensure that all the statutory duties of governance in the school were carried out. In addition they were charged to ensure that rapid improvements were made and that the school addressed all of the issues raised from the most recent Ofsted report. The School was initially supported by the Senior Management Team from Shenley Academy, until July 2014. The DFE placed an Academy order with Fairfax School as sponsor Academy, as recommended by the IEB. Fairfax took over the support role on 1 September 2014 and Academy conversion took place on 1 November 2014http://www.bournvilleschool.org/news%20area/docs/2014/oct/Final%20IEB%20to%20parents.pdf with Mr Chris Stevens as Acting Head of Academy and Mr A Bird as Executive Headteacher. Mrs Nicola Gould took over as Head of Academy at the beginning of the Summer Term 2015. The School and MAT announced the closure of the Sixth form taking no new entrants from September 2016 after consultation, and following petition from the pupils and community, the number of pupils applying for 2016 were too low to provide a quality provision and to be cost effective.http://b31.org.uk/2016/06/u-turn-as-education-secretary-approves- closure-of-bournville-school-sixth-form/ =OFSTED assessment 2013= \\"Too many students in Key Stages 3 and 4 underachieve in English, mathematics and some other subjects because the progress they make is too slow. The majority of teaching is either inadequate or requires improvement. Expectations of what students should achieve are too low and some lessons proceed at a slow pace..\\" \\\\- Ofsted Report September 2013.

Griffin was also the name of one of the original Boys School's four houses, as well as being the Boys' School magazine's name. In the Elgar building foyer, a plaque showing the old badge can be seen, the same Griffin, just without the mortar board and scroll. The Logo was updated to a more online friendly graphic (as per this page) to coincide with the conversion to Academy status in 2014.

Story The hero, a nameless teenage boy in Japan, is trying out his new guitar one sunny day when he suddenly finds himself whisked away to another world. He is woken by Tonto, an otomori and servant of the recently deceased Orochi, one of the seven wise dragons. Tonto informs the hero that he was summoned by Orochi to be his champion, raising and pitting dragon against dragon in a series of battles to change the world. Gameplay Most of the game centers around the battles, which use a turn-based system pitting parties of up to three dragons at a time (with up to three more in reserve) against each other. Dragons can be commanded to attack, defend, use a special power (Dragon Force), charge to restore points enabling special moves, or change with another dragon in reserve. Dragons gain experience points from battles with which they can attain higher levels. The game also has a unique system by which the player acquires new dragons. After finding a dragon egg, it can be brought to the \\"Nest\\" in a town, where the player may hatch it by recording sounds into the DS's built in microphone. Some dragons can only be attained by playing particular melodies.

In 2003, Farrar sponsored legislation that would prohibit employment discrimination based upon sexual orientation or gender identity.Representative files bill to extend employment rights The Daily Texan, February 4, 2003. In 2009, she proposed a bill that would recognize postpartum psychosis as a defense for mothers who kill their infants. Under the terms of the proposed legislation, if jurors concluded that a mother's \\"judgment was impaired as a result of the effects of giving birth or the effects of lactation following the birth,\\" they would be allowed to convict her of the crime of infanticide, rather than murder. The maximum penalty for infanticide would be two years in prison. Farrar's introduction of this bill prompted liberal bioethics scholar Jacob M. Appel to call her \\"the bravest politician in America.\\" In 2011, Farrar introduced legislation that would prohibit peace officers from inquiring as to the immigration or nationality status of a witness or victim in a criminal investigation. In March 2017, Farrar proposed a bill to fine men for masturbation and require consultations and medically-unnecessary examinations before vasectomies, colonoscopies, and the prescription of Viagra tablets. The bill is a response to what Farrar calls \\"the obstacles that Texas women face every day, that were placed there by legislatures making it very difficult for them to access health care.\\" Farrar said that masturbation could be deemed \\"an act against an unborn child\\" and a \\"failure to preserve the sanctity of life.\\" =The Killer Ds= In May 2003, Farrar helped to organize a group of House Democrats who left Texas for Ardmore, Oklahoma. The absence of fifty-two House Democrats prevented Republicans from obtaining a quorum and hence blocked passage of the redistricting plan during the 2003 regular session. The Killer Ds were followed by a group of eleven state senators, called the Texas Eleven, who fled the state in August 2003 for the same purposes.

It was founded by Henry Wharton Conway, of Greene County, Tennessee, who had come to the state of Arkansas in 1820 with his younger brother James and his cousins Elias and Wharton Rector, all of whom were deputy-surveyors under the patronage of their uncle, William Rector, Surveyor General of Missouri, Illinois, and Arkansas. History The Conway-Johnson family developed following a fatal duel between former friends Robert Crittenden and Henry Wharton Conway on October 27, 1827, near Napoleon, Arkansas. Conway had served as territorial delegate for Arkansas, with Crittenden acting behind the scenes on his behalf. After the resignation of Territorial Governor Miller in 1824, Conway nominated Crittenden to fill the position. President James Monroe appointed George Izard instead. Crittenden continued as secretary of state. He and Conway disagreed over the latter's decision not to seek re-election in 1825. Conway defeated Robert Oden, who was backed by Crittenden. After a period of public conflict through the newspapers, Crittenden challenged Conway to a duel. Conway fired first and hit a button on Crittenden's coat; Crittenden shot and hit Conway, who died of his wounds weeks later. By firing at Conway after having been hit, Crittenden broke the dueling etiquette. His political career suffered. Conway's brother James formed a political alliance with Ambrose H. Sevier and supported his appointment to fill the deceased Conway's territorial seat. The duel caused realignments and a split in Arkansas politics. Crittenden supporters later became the Whig Party. The Conways and Seviers led the Democrats in opposition to Crittenden. Member families The alliance between the immediate Conway and Sevier families later broadened to include Conway's cousins Elias and Wharton Rector. Additional political families were linked by marriage. Henry Conway had married the daughter of Benjamin Johnson, a superior court judge in Arkansas Territory. Sevier had married a sister of Robert Ward Johnson, a member of a powerful Kentucky political family. Johnson served as a Congressman and US Senator from Arkansas in the antebellum years and was part of The Family. The group was a staunch supporter of Andrew Jackson and Jacksonian policies. Members Sevier and Conway came from prominent political families.

The octopus was found off the coast of North Wales in a lobster pot, and was held in captivity at the Blackpool Sea Life Centre in North West England. His unusual number of arms was not immediately noticed, and appears to have resulted from a natal anomaly, rather than a physical accident.

Since October 1955, the Republic of Austria maintains the constitutionally-mandated status of neutrality; the country is a founding member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OEEC). Austria joined the EU in 1995. Russia is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, a partner of ASEAN, a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), the G20, the Asia- Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), the Organization for Security and Co- operation in Europe (OSCE), as well as the leading member state of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), and the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU). Both countries are members of the Council of Europe, the Organization for Security and Co- operation in Europe, and the World Trade Organization (WTO).  History  = Early history = The lands now part of Austria were once simply a collection of fiefs of the House of Habsburg whose head was also the Holy Roman Emperor from the 15th Century on. The history of Austria in international relations during this time period was synonymous with the foreign policy of the Habsburgs. Russia was more or less uninterested in European affairs before Peter I (r. 1682-1725) but there were contacts between the Holy Roman Emperor and the Tsars of Muscovy the most known of all was the Embassy conducted by Herberstein in the 16th Century. Between these two vast monarchies lay the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Ottoman Empire. However, as the Habsburgs expanded their domain (often shortened as \\"Austria\\" after its central province, the Archduchy of Austria) south and east and Russia south and west, relations between the two monarchies became vital to European security. When Peter the Great was proclaimed emperor in 1721, his and his successors' recognition of the imperial title was delayed by the Habsburgs, the other claimant successors of the Roman Empire, until 1742, during the War of Austrian Succession. Russia's entry into European affairs created a recurring alliance between Russia and Austria often directed against the Ottomans and France. Russia and Austria were allies during the War of the Polish Succession (1733‚Äì1738), the War of the Austrian Succession (1740‚Äì1748), the Seven Years' War (1756‚Äì1763), and from 1787 to 1791 the monarchies both waged separates wars against the Ottomans (the Austro-Turkish War (1787-1791) and the Russo-Turkish War (1787‚Äì1792)). Both countries participated in the first and third partition of Poland. The two countries do not border each other until the second partition of Poland. The coming of the French Revolution created ideological solidarity between the absolutist monarchies including Russia and Austria, which both fought against France during the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars. = Austrian and Russian Empires = In 1804 Austria was proclaimed an Empire and after the Congress of Vienna the great reactionary powers of Europe pledged to work together to keep revolution at bay, and Austria and Russia were the greatest defenders of the Vienna settlement. After 1815 Austria's policy as set by Klemens von Metternich was based on a realistic acceptance of Russia's political predominance in Moldavia and Wallachia. He obtained from Tsar Nicholas I some economic concessions during the 1830s. The two powers began to co-operate, with the mutual aim of preserving the status quo.Miroslav ≈†ediv√Ω√Ω, \\"From Hostility to Cooperation? Austria, Russia and the Danubian Principalities 1829‚Äì‚Äì40.\\" Slavonic & East European Review 89.4 (2011): 630-661. The Revolutions of 1848 shook the Habsburg lands, and the Hungarian lands declared their independence. Russia intervened by invading Hungary to suppress the revolutions and restore the Habsburg sovereignty. During the Crimean War Austria maintained a policy of hostile neutrality towards Russia, and, while not going to war, was supportive of the Anglo-French coalition. This stance deeply angered Nicholas I of Russia and was a serious strain to Russo-Austrian relations thereafter. Although it was Russia that was punished by the Treaty of Paris, in the long run it was Austria that lost the most from the Crimean War despite having barely taken part in it. Having abandoned its alliance with Russia, Austria was diplomatically isolated following the war. Russia subsequently stood aside as Austria was evicted from the Italian and German states. That Russian neutrality towards its former ally clearly contributed to Austrian defeat in the 1866 Austro-Prussian War and its loss of influence in most German-speaking lands. The Habsburgs therefore gave in to Hungarian demands for autonomy and refounded their state as the Austro-Hungarian Empire. France, after the Franco-Prussian War and the loss of Alsace-Lorraine, was fervently hostile to Germany, and made an alliance with Russia. The great Slavic empire competed with the newly renamed Austro-Hungarian Empire for an increased role in the Balkans at the expense of the Ottoman Empire, and the foundations were in place for creating the diplomatic alliances that would lead to World War I. = Austria-Hungary and Russian Empire = Austrian officials worried that Russia was adopting a pan-Slavist policy designed to unite all Slavonic-speaking peoples under the Tsar's leadership. This led them to pursue an anti-Slavic policy domestically and abroad. The major source of tension between Austria-Hungary and Russia was the so-called Eastern Question: what to do about the weakening Ottoman Empire and its rebellious Christian subjects. From 1873 to 1887, at least nominally, Austria-Hungary and Russia were again allies with the German Empire in the League of Three Emperors. The 1878 Treaty of Berlin concluded in the aftermath of Russia's victory against the Ottoman Empire in the war of 1877, allowed Austria-Hungary to occupy the Bosnia Vilayet. This, in turn, brought Austria into conflict with the Principality of Serbia, an autonomous (de facto independent) state within the Ottoman Empire under Russian influence and protection. The visit to Saint Petersburg of Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph and his conference with Nicholas II of Russia in 1897 heralded a secret agreement between the two empires to honour and seek to maintain the status quo in the Balkans, which was in line with Vienna's attempts to forestall an emergence of a large Slavic state in the region. Austria's formal annexation of the Bosnia Vilayet in 1908 dismayed Russia as well as all the other Great Powers and Austria-Hungary's Balkan neighbours, who viewed the action as a violation of the Treaty of Berlin. While Russia eventually backed down, relations between the two Empires were permanently damaged. The lasting result was bitter enmity between Austria- Hungary on one side and Serbia and Russia on the other. Following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria by Serb nationalists of the Black Hand secret society on 28 June 1914, Austria delivered the July Ultimatum to Serbia demanding that the Austrian police and military have the right to enter Serbia. Serbia rejected the ultimatum and on 28 July 1914, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia. On August 6, the Emperor Franz Joseph signed the Austro-Hungarian declaration of war on Russia, who had since 1 August been at war with Germany, the ally of Austria. Russia and Austria would fight to the point of exhaustion on the bloody Eastern Front. The war ended with the overthrow of monarchy in both countries, as well as in Germany, and the dissolution of their empires. =Austria and the Soviet Union= Diplomatic relations between Austria and the USSR were established in 1924 and the former Russian Imperial embassy‚Ä≤s building was handed over to the Soviets.–û –ü–æ—Å–æ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–µ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏ –≤ –ê–≤—Å—Ç—Ä–∏–∏. austria.mid.ru The rump Austrian state left after the war eventually joined with Nazi Germany in the Anschluss, and was therefore part of the German invasion of the Soviet Union. After the war Austria was occupied by the allied armies, separated from Germany, and divided into four zones of occupation. The Soviets did not create a separate socialist government in their zone as they did in East Germany. Instead, Austria was required to sign the Austrian State Treaty of 1955 under which it pledged total neutrality in the Cold War confrontation between the Soviet Union and the U.S.-led West. In 1968, Austria became the first Western European country to begin imports of natural gas from the Soviet Union. Subsequently, Europe's main gas hub was set up at Baumgarten an der March on Austria's eastern border with Hungary. =Republic of Austria and Russian Federation (since 1991)= Following the dissolution of the USSR in 1991, the Russian Federation, the successor state to the Soviet Union, went on maintaining a close relationship with Austria. Thanks to its neutral status, Austria continued to be the venue for spy exchanges as was the case in 2010, when the U.S. and Russia swapped four imprisoned U.S. and UK intelligence assets, who had been convicted in Russia, for 10 Russian agents caught and convicted in the U.S., on the tarmac of Vienna International Airport. Austria has sought to maintain good relations and close economic cooperation with Russia even after the drastic deterioration of Russia's relationship with the West following the 2014 Ukraine crisis. In December 2016, the FP√ñ leader, Heinz-Christian Strache, announced that his party, founded in the 1956 by Austrian ex-Nazis and SS officers, had signed what he called a cooperation agreement with United Russia, Russian president Vladimir Putin‚Äôs party.Austria's Far Right Signs a Cooperation Pact With Putin's Party The New York Times, 19 December 2016.

Frangistan literally means \\"Land of the Franks\\", from Farang which is the Persianized form of Frank plus the suffix -istan coming from the Persian language.Dehkhoda Persian Dictionary During the Crusades, the Muslims of the Middle East came to call all Christendom Franks, originally the name for inhabitants of the largest of the Christian realms in Europe, Francia, which gave its name to the Kingdom of France (although its eastern parts came to be known as the Holy Roman Empire). As the Franks (French) formed a substantial part of the force of the First Crusade, and Old French became the dominant language in the crusader states of the 12th century (notably the Principality of Antioch), the term Frank as used in the Levant could mean any Western European Christian (whether Frankish, Saxon, Flemish, etc.). Frangistan was not a clearly defined area and may have referred to any land perceived to be Christian by contemporary Muslims. In a similar way, Greek Christians were \\"Rumis\\", named for R√ªm (derived from \\"Rome\\", i.e. the Byzantine Empire). Conversely, Christians generally called Muslims Saracens or Moors, both after the names of more localized tribes, in Arabia and Mauretania, respectively. The term Frangistan was still in use in the time of the Ottoman Empire, in sources as late as the 17th century.Bernard Lewis, \\"Some Reflections on the Decline of the Ottoman Empire\\", Studia Islamica, No. 9.

He was a Mohawk, possibly the first Mohawk accredited land surveyor in Canada. Because of his Mohawk status, he faced discrimination seeking full-time work with the Government of Canada. Born the youngest of six children to Daniel Green & Mary (Crawford) Green in Alford, Ontario, outside of the Six Nations of the Grand River First Nation lands, He attended the Mohawk Institute in Brantford, His success at the Indian Residential School led Robert Ashton, the Superintendent, to recommend, after two years at the school, that he write the entrance exam for Brantford High School. In 1875, Thomas obtained the highest grade of all the forty-one applicants from the public schools in Brant County. He tutored other students to raise money to attend McGill College in Montreal, Quebec, graduating with a B.Sc. in 1880. He is first noted playing hockey for the 1883 Montreal Winter Carnival Tournament winners McGill, where he was studying engineering. After completing his studies in Montreal, he moved to Ottawa, Ontario seeking work with the Canadian federal government. He succeeded only in receiving temporary work with the Dominion Land Survey, his hiring to a permanent position blocked by A. M. Burgess, the deputy minister of the Interior, although he was recommended by Prime Minister John A. Macdonald. In Ottawa, he joined the Ottawa Hockey Club in time to play in their first competitive season of 1883‚Äì84. In 1886, he became the first president of the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada, considered the first organized ice hockey league. Green eventually left Ottawa and became a land surveyor in Ontario. He moved west and surveyed mines in the Yukon, town sites in Alberta and rail lines in Western Canada.

The name Picentes or Picentini () refers to the population of Picenum, on the northern Adriatic coastal plain of ancient Italy. Their endonym, if any, is not known for certain. There is linguistic evidence that the Picentini comprised two different ethnicities: a group known to scholars as the \\"South Picenes\\" (or South Picenians) were an Italic tribe,Philip Baldi, 1999, The Foundations of Latin, The Hague, Mouton de Gruyter, pp. 134‚Äì6, 152‚Äì3. while the \\"North Picenes\\" (or North Picenians) appear to have had closer links to non-Italic peoples. Usage of the toponym Picenum depends on the time period. The region between the Apennines and the Adriatic Sea south of Ancona (originally a Greek colony) was in Picenum during the entire early historic period. Between Ancona and Rimini to the north the population was multi-ethnic. In the Roman Republic it was Gallia Togata, but the Gauls were known to have combined or supplanted earlier populations. The ager Gallicus, as it was called, was considered both Gaul and Picenum. Under the Roman Empire the coast south of Rimini was united or reunited with the country south of Ancona as Picenum. By then the only language spoken was Latin. From Ancona southward a language of the Umbrian group was spoken, today called South Picene. It is attested mainly in inscriptions. Umbrian was an North of Ancona around Pesaro a non-Italic language, written in a version of the Old Italic script, is attested by four inscriptions (three of which are very brief); this has been termed, for convenience, North Picene. Both the meaning of the inscriptions and the relationship of North Picene to other languages remain unknown. There is phonological evidence that it was linked more closely to the Indo-European language family (than to, for example, Etruscan). Some authors have referred to North Picene as simply \\"Picene\\" ‚Äì under a hypothesis that it represents the original language across Picenum, although there is as yet no evidence for this. Ethnonym Statue of the Capestrano Warrior at Chieti Museum. One endonym of the Picentes, or at least the South Picenes, may be Pupeneis or, according to Edward Togo Salmon \\"something similar\\", as this apparently ethnic name is used in four South Picenian language inscriptions found near Ascoli Piceno. Later refinements of the argument connected it to the Latin name Poponius, as in inscription TE 1 found near Teramo: :apaes ...p√∫p√∫nis nir :\\"Appaes ... a Poponian man\\" The connection between Poponian and Picentes, if any, remains obscure. There is no mention in ancient sources of the endonym used by the North Picenes. The first document to mention the Latin exonym Picentes is the Fasti triumphales, which record for 268/267 BC a triumph given to Publius Sempronius Sophus for a victory de Peicentibus, \\"over the Picentes,\\" where the -ei- is an Old Latin form. The entire group of Latin Picene words delivered subsequently appear to follow the standard rules for Latin word formation. The root is Pƒ´c-, provenience and meaning yet unknown. The extended Pƒ´c-ƒìn- is used to form a second-declension adjective, appearing in such phrases as Pƒ´cƒìnus ager, \\"Picene country,\\" Pƒ´cƒìnae olivae, \\"Picene olives\\", and the neuter used as a noun, Pƒ´cƒìnum. These are not references to any people, *Pƒ´cƒìni, but to the country. Pƒ´cƒìni where it occurs is the genitive case of Pƒ´cƒìnum and not a nominative plural; that is \\"of Picenum\\" and not \\"the Piceni.\\" Similarly Pƒ´cƒìnus used alone implies Pƒ´cƒìnus ager, the \\"Picene (country)\\" and does not mean one resident of Picenum. This adjective is never used of the people. For the people, a third-declension adjective stem is formed: Pƒ´c-ent-, used in Pƒ´cens and Pƒ´centes, \\"a Picentine\\" and \\"the Picentines,\\" which are nouns formed from the adjective. This adjective can be used of people or of other words, as well as in a second formation of the name of the country, Pƒ´centum. From it comes a final name of the people, Pƒ´centini. The historical order in which these words appeared or whether they came from each other remains unknown. Mythology regarding the origins of the Picentes Bronze fibula and \\"pettorale\\" at Museo Archeologico Nazionale delle Marche, Ancona. According to Strabo, the Picentini were Sabine colonists,Strabo, Geography (V, 3, 1):The Sabini not only are a very ancient race but are also the indigenous inhabitants (and both the Picentini and the Samnitae are colonists from the Sabini, and the Leucani from the Samnitae, and the Brettii from the Leucani).A system of ancient and mediaeval geography for the use of schools and colleges. by Charles Anthon. by Michigan Historical Reprint Series,,2005,page 302,\\"... in Strabo's time, a city of note. - PICENUM. (A.) NAME, BOUNDARIES, &C.; 1\\\\. Pic√©num took its name from the Picentes, its inhabitants, who were a colony of Sabines ; ...\\" although this is doubted by more recent scholars, who see the South Picenes at least as more closely related to the Sabellians. Strabo also relates a legend that a woodpecker () led the way to Picenum for the people who became the Picentini and apparently a folk etymology of their ethnonym was \\"those of the woodpecker.\\" Strabo likewise reported myths that other regions of Italy were colonized by people relying on the divinely-inspired guidance of a ritually selected animal: a bull for the Sabines and a wolf for the Hirpini i.e. \\"those of the wolf\\" or hirpo. The woodpecker clearly played a part in Picene religion and culture, which strengthens the case for the animal being the source of their endonym. Modern advocates of the theory include: Joshua Whatmough (influenced by James George Frazer), believed that many Italic peoples had tribal totems. According to Whatmough, Italia was thought to mean \\"land of calves\\", while wolves were esteemed in varying ways by several peoples, including the Hirpini, Romans and Lucani (whose name was apparently derived from a root such as *luco- \\"wolf\\".) History In 299 BC the Romans captured Nequinum, a city of the Umbrians, colonized it and renamed it Narni (after the River Nar). They also concluded a treaty with a people Livy calls the Picentes (the term used is cum Picenti populo, \\"with the Picentine people\\"). In 297 BC the Picentes warned the Roman Senate that they had been approached by the Samnites asking for alliance in renewed hostilities with Rome. The Senate thanked them. After a gap in the record of nearly 30 years the Picentes appear again in a totally different relationship with Rome. The Ager Gallicus on the northeast coast of Italy had for some time been populated by different ethnic groups, mainly Picentes, Etruscans and Gauls. Ancona had been placed there by the Greeks of Sicily; north of it the Gauls predominated. In 283 BC after a series of victories over the Gauls, including the Battle of Lake Vadimon, the Romans expelled the Gallic Senones from the coastal region and annexed it down to Ancona, after which it became \\"Gallia Togata.\\" In 268 BC the Picentes were defeated in Gallia Togata by two consular armies. Evidently they had rebelled against Rome, probably in 269. Ancona and Asculum remained independent but the rest of Picenum was annexed. The Romans placed two more colonies to hold it: Ariminum in 268 and Firmum in 264. Between these years they moved large numbers of Picentes to Campania, giving them land at Paestum and on the river Silarus and assisted them to build a city, Picentia. They also placed a garrison at Salernum to monitor them. Strabo reports that in his time they had depopulated the city in favor of villages scattered about the Salerno region. In Ptolemy's time (2nd century AD) a population named by him the Picentini were still at Salernum and Surentum. Picentes were divided during the Social War (91‚Äì88 BC), with some fighting against Rome for the Roman citizenship and others remaining loyal. All Picentes were granted full Roman citizenship after the war.

Licensed to Ripon, Wisconsin, the station was owned by Ripon College. WRPN-FM was the result of efforts spearheaded by speech instructor Howard Hanson. According to a profile of the radio station in Ripon Magazine, Hanson presented a prospectus for a student-run radio station to college administrators in 1955. He wanted an organization that would serve \\"as a public voice of the College and as a student-training laboratory.\\" He wanted a \\"truly educational station,\\" one that did not compete program-wise with the commercial radio stations serving the Ripon area. By the fall of 1956, a group of students had secured equipment and expertise in AM closed carrier circuit system broadcasting to begin to offer programming on 570 on the AM dial. The service was offered through phone lines. It was only available in the dorms. The studio was located in what was known as Tracey House on the corner of Thorne and Ransom Streets in Ripon. The experiment had its up and downs, with a letter authored by station management in the fall of 1960 and distributed to students, faculty, and administrators declaring the station dead due to technical difficulties and staffing issues. Months later, a group of students had revived the organization and the station was back on the air. The FCC granted the College's request for a low-powered educational FM radio station in November 1960. WRPN-FM signed on in February 1961, thanks to donated equipment. By this time, the station's studios had moved to Middle Hall (now known as Smith Hall). A 110-foot tower was constructed behind the building. The station operated at 10-watt power. The FM signal allowed the entire campus and Ripon community to hear the station's programming. In the years that followed, there were many noteworthy ebbs and flows. The highs included 24-hour music and entertainment programming, the expansion of live coverage of sports and campus events, and several awards for broadcast excellence. The lows included unreliable technology, less student interest, and battles with administrators over control and programming. In its final years, the station's studios were located on the top level of the Harwood Memorial Union. The station's tower was located outside that building. A 2004 article in the Ripon College Days stated the FCC had granted approval for the station to increase its operating to power to 550 watts, but that power increase never happened. In September 2014, the broadcast license for WRPN-FM was returned by the College and deleted by the FCC. Despite losing its FCC license, WRPN now operates as an online streaming radio station.

Philosophy In his teaching and writing Dolkart stresses the importance of Vernacular architecture based more on commercial need than strictly stylistic preferences. Much of his work emphasizes the practical and economic aspects of buildings, whether they were constructed to meet the needs of the garment industry, tenement housing, or high-end housing designed primarily to meet the profit objectives of speculative real estate developers. His presentation style uses humor and irony: \\"I trace my ancestry back to the Mayflower,\\" Dolkart writes in the forward to Biography of a Tenement House in New York City: An Architectural History of 97 Orchard Street. \\"Not to the legendary ship that brought the Pilgrims to Plymouth, Massachusetts, in 1620, but to the more prosaic tenement on the southeast corner of East Broadway and Clinton Street named the Mayflower, where my father was born in 1914 to Russian-Jewish immigrants.\\" On its webpage describing Dolkart's book, a staff writer from the Lower East Side Tenement Museum states, \\"For Dolkart, the experience of being raised in a tenement became a metaphor for the life that was afforded countless thousands of other immigrant children growing up in Lower Manhattan during the past century and more. Dolkart presents for us a precise and informative biography of a typical tenement house in New York City that became, in 1988, the site for the Lower East Side Tenement Museum...This book is a lasting tribute to the legacy of immigrants and their children, who were part of the transformation of New York City and the fabric of everyday American urban life.\\" In 2009, Dolkart published \\"The Row House Reborn: Architecture and Neighborhoods in New York City, 1909-1929,\\" a pioneering study of the rediscovery and redesign of run-down urban row houses in the early 20th century and the creation of an entirely new type of urban housing.

They are linked to Hurwitz's theorem. Definition Hurwitz improved Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet's criterion on irrationality to the statement that a real number Œ± is irrational if and only if there are infinitely many rational numbers p/q, written in lowest terms, such that :\\\\left|\\\\alpha - \\\\frac{p}{q}\\\\right< \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{5}q^2}. This was an improvement on Dirichlet's result which had 1/q2 on the right hand side. The above result is best possible since the golden ratio œÜ is irrational but if we replace by any larger number in the above expression then we will only be able to find finitely many rational numbers that satisfy the inequality for Œ± = œÜ. However, Hurwitz also showed that if we omit the number œÜ, and numbers derived from it, then we can increase the number . In fact he showed we may replace it with 2. Again this new bound is best possible in the new setting, but this time the number is the problem. If we don't allow then we can increase the number on the right hand side of the inequality from 2 to /5. Repeating this process we get an infinite sequence of numbers , 2, /5, ... which converge to 3.Cassels (1957) p.14 These numbers are called the Lagrange numbers,Conway&Guy; (1996) pp.187-189 and are named after Joseph Louis Lagrange.

Founded by British philanthropist Stan Brock, it was originally conceived to treat people in the developing world, but turned its attention to those in need of health care in the United States.  History  RAM was founded in 1985 by Englishman Stan Brock, who worked as an assistant to Marlin Perkins on Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom. RAM's work was originally confined to Third World countries, but it later shifted towards the US. Today RAM works domestic operations around the United States and internationally when need arises. The clinic in Wise, Virginia, was recently recognized as the nation's largest pop-up free clinic. The 2017 clinic in Wise hosted over 1,000 volunteers and served 2,300 men and women. RAM completed its 900th clinic in Knoxville Tennessee, in 2018, and it's 1,000th clinic in Knoxville, Tennessee in 2019. RAM were featured on an episode of 60 Minutes on CBS.  Headquarters  On March 31, 2014, Remote Area Medical's headquarters moved from an old school building in Knox County, Tennessee to the previous Henniges Automotive facility in Blount County, Tennessee. The previous school building was utilized by RAM for 19 years and was rented by the organization for $1 a year from Knox County.  Funding  RAM is funded through donations and relies on volunteers from the community, as well as professionals including physicians, dentists, optometrists, nurses, pilots and veterinarians to provide care in poorer communities.Remote Area Medical can be a lifeline, Chattanooga Times Free PressMobile medical unit aids uninsured, The Washington Times, July 21, 2008.  Animal services  Remote Area Medical's Veterinary Program provides animal health services to those who live in underserved, impoverished, and isolated communities.  Disaster relief  Remote Area Medical's Disaster Relief arm responds to disasters by land, sea, and air, delivering medical relief and other humanitarian aid when needed.  Legislation  In 2017 Rep. John J. Duncan Jr., R-Knoxville, filed a bill that would provide $1 million to any state that allows licensed medical professionals to travel from other states and offer their services to those in need. The money would be a one- time allocation with the intent to help states pay any costs associated with allowing outside doctors to volunteer within their borders. The legislation, called the Healthier Act, specifies that out-of-state medical personnel could work only at weekend clinics. That would prevent them from moving into a state and setting up a permanent or semi-permanent practice.

His gimmick is inspired by the Ryukyuan Shisa. He claimed to be a student of Toryumon alumni Saito, but was outed as being Saito himself in 2007. Career =As SAITO= Saito got his start in wrestling with √öltimo Drag√≥n's upstart promotion Toryumon. He trained in Mexico with the rest of the √öltimo Drag√≥n students, and briefly used the Super Shisa gimmick while there. He wrestled January 31, 1999, on Toryumon's debut show. Wrestling under his real name, he teamed with Magnum Tokyo and Dragon Kid to take on Shima Nobunaga, Sumo Fuji and Judo Suwa in an elimination match on the main event of the card. Saito would be eliminated second following a Nodowa Elbow from Fuji, but his team would go on to win the match.King of Dragon Japan He would continue to be a top line player in early Toryumon, and would rename to Saito. In the spring of 2000, he and fellow Toryumon participant Chocoball KOBE would wrestle in Pro Wrestling Kageki. Saito would win the Hakata City Jr Heavyweight Title in a tournament, defeating Daiyu Kawuchi in the final round. He abruptly announced his retirement in late 2001, and stated that his first student, Super Shisa, would take his place. Saito would be given a \\"Sayonara Saito\\" series of matches by Toryumon. His record in the series was 0-5-1, the draw being a double countout against Yasushi Kanda. His final match as Saito would be a loss to Shuji Kondo on 10/28/2001.La Gran Pelea~Sayonara SAITO~ 2001 =As Super Shisa= Super Shisa would debut on 11/8/2001, wrestling a 10-minute draw with Kenichiro Arai. Shisa has spent most of his career in both Toryumon and Dragon Gate near the bottom of the card, rarely joining units. He was a member of a short lived unit called Waku Waku Fuji Land, led by Don Fujii. Waku Waku Fuji Land was designed to bridge the gap between Crazy Max and the soon-to-form Blood Generation. As Blood Generation was based on a clean face (no masks or face paint) concept, Fuji gave Shisa an ultimatum: unmask or you may not join Blood Generation. The ultimatum prompted the fans to begin chanting Saito's name, but Shisa quickly opted to leave rather than unmask. Shisa then aligned with Magnum Tokyo's PosHearts unit. PosHearts would go on hiatus due to an injury to Tokyo, and Shisa spent the latter part of 2005 and much of 2006 teaming with King Shisa, and occasionally with Dragon Gate dojo student Shisa Boy. The team broke up when King Shisa was outed as being Mexican heel Pentagon Black, and reverted to that gimmick. Towards the end of 2006, PosHearts would reunite, and Shisa would win his first title in Toryumon / Dragon Gate, winning the Open the Triangle Gate titles with stablemates BxB Hulk and Anthony W. Mori. The success was short lived, as PosHearts lost the titles to the Muscle Outlaw'z, and then lost a follow up match forcing them to disband as a stable. It was during this match that Shisa was outed as being Saito; damage to the mask and blood loss forced him to voluntarily demask. Shisa, along with Akira Tozawa and Kagetora represent Dragon Gate in the 2011 King of Trios tournament, where they faced the Osirian Portal in the quarter-finals. Since the dissolution of PosHearts, Shisa has remained unaligned and wrestling low on the card. He is a trainer in the Dragon Gate dojo, and focuses primarily on those duties. While wrestling on the main roster, Shisa aligns with the \\"Mushozoku\\" Unit, a group of older wrestlers including Masaaki Mochizuki, K-ness and Magnitude Kishiwada. Aside from Dragon Gate, Shisa spends time in various smaller Japanese independent promotions. On February 27, 2010, his ranking in the promotion improved significantly when he defeated K-ness to become the Open the Brave Gate Champion. He held the title for just under two months before losing it to Tigers Mask of Osaka Pro Wrestling. On April 15, 2011, Shisa represented Team Dragon Gate in the 2011 King of Trios tournament along with Akira Tozawa and Kagetora. In the first round of the tournament, Team Dragon Gate defeated the Spectral Envoy (UltraMantis Black, Hallowicked and Frightmare). The following day, Team Dragon Gate was eliminated from the tournament in the quarter-final stage by The Osirian Portal (Amasis, Hieracon and Ophidian). On April 17, the final day of the tournament, Shisa and KAGETORA took part in a gauntlet tag match and were the final team to enter, but they were defeated by Atsushi Kotoge and Daisuke Harada. The Shisa lineage Other wrestlers with a Shisa gimmick have appeared in Dragon Gate, aligned with Super Shisa. One of the current dojo students is Shisa Boy. Mexican wrestler Pentagon Black spent several months in Dragon Gate as King Shisa. Introduced as the leader of the Shisa clan, King Shisa was pushed further than Super Shisa ever was, even going so far as to get a Dream Gate title shot. He was eventually outed as being Pentagon Black by the Muscle Outlaw'z, and joined them.

For example, in criminal proceedings, the district courts would generally hear cases in first instance. However, when the penalty for the crime in question exceeds 5 years, the case will be tried by a regional court as a court of the first instance. Boundaries of the district court jurisdictions are, confusingly, non- conterminous with those of the administrative districts.District courts were originally conterminous with the districts of the Czech Republic ('). But the municipalities for each district court were explicitly named in the Law on Courts and Judges of 2002, and in 2007 the borders of the districts of the Czech Republic were slightly adjusted and many municipalities are now within different districts of the Czech Republic, making district court boundaries non-conterminous with these new districts of the Czech Republic. Of the two high courts, one is seated in Prague with jurisdiction over Bohemia, the other in Olomouc with jurisdiction over Moravia and Silesia. Naturally, these will handle an appeal of a case heard in the first instance by a regional court.

The Constitution requires a judge to be a graduate of a law school, a person with full integrity (no criminal record) and states the position is incompatible with political functions.Constitution, Article 93 Further regulations specifies he must be at least 30 and go through a three years of specialised training within the courts. Since the judiciary is to be kept from influences of the executive and the legislator, all disciplinary matters of judges (as well as state prosecutors) are to be dealt with by the judiciary itself, in particular by the disciplinary chambers of the Supreme Administrative Court.Czech Republic.

In the socialist legal system, law and judges were tools of the state, dedicated to punishment of its enemies. = Public prosecutor = The only body capable of bringing a criminal court action is the state prosecutor. The State Prosecutors' Bureau (') is part of the Ministry of Justice. = Advocate = All legally educated persons providing legal representation in court (and giving advice and other services) are called '. To be allowed to legally practise law in the Czech Republic, an advocate must first obtain a master's degree from a faculty of law, a prospective advocate must complete 3 years of professional training crowned by passing the bar examination. He must then become a member of the Czech Bar Association ('). Members of equivalent bodies in other EU member states are also allowed.\\"Welcome at the Czech Bar Association\\". Czech Bar Association, n.d. Web. 28 Dec. 2012. = Lay judge = Lay judges sit with a professional judge in the first instance of a non-specialized trial. They are appointed by local councils; by municipal councils (') in district courts, and by regional councils (') in regional courts. The whole institution is a bit of a leftover of the communist idea of popularization of justice.  Law  '' The Czech Republic has a legal system of the continental type, rooted in Germanic legal culture. The main source of law is written legislature. Its main areas are systematically codified, mainly in Civil Code and Criminal Code. The form of court proceeding is prescribed in the Codes of Criminal, Civil and Administrative Procedure. The legal force of different Czech legal sources is hierarchical. = Procedure = Court proceedings are oral and public, with exceptions stated by law (juvenile justice etc.). The procedure is based on inquisitorial system with features of the adversarial system. There is no jury. For criminal procedure, the chief statutary regulation is Act No. 141/1961 Coll., the Code of Criminal Procedure.z√°kon ƒç. 141/1961 Sb., trestn√≠ ≈ô√°d In the chapter on preparatory procedure it sets out the role of the bodies involved in criminal proceedings (', namely the police, the public prosecutor and the court) while preparing the prosecution, such as interviewing the witnesses and gathering evidence. The chapter on court proceedings sets out procedures for criminal charge, trial, and appeal process. Although in force since 1961, the code has been amended many times since 1989, adding radically new features, such as plea bargaining (in 2012). In Act No. 218/2003 Coll., on Juvenile Criminal Procedure,z√°kon ƒç. 218/2003 Sb., o soudnictv√≠ ve vƒõcech ml√°de≈æe separate procedure has been introduced for minors.

No. 99/1963 Coll., the Code of Civil Procedure.z√°kon ƒç. 99/1963, obƒçansk√Ω soudn√≠ ≈ô√°d Administrative justice, deals with claims of natural and legal persons, who seek protection from illegal decisions or action of public authorities. While in many respects similar to civil procedure, the administrative court procedure is different in that the defendant here is not an entity of private law, but a public body. Not being a legal person, such a public body could not be sued otherwise. Administrative matters are usually adjudicated by regional courts, and follow the procedure set out in Act. No. 150/2002, the Code of Administrative Procedure.Official translation available, translated as the Code of Administrative Justicez√°kon ƒç. 150/2002 Sb., soudn√≠ ≈ô√°d spr√°vn√≠ = Pardon and amnesty = Czech president is endowed by the Constitution with extrajudicial power of interfering in criminal proceedings, before, during and after the trial. He can \\"pardon and mitigate penalties imposed by the court, order not to initiate criminal proceedings and suspend them if they are already initiated, and expunge sentences\\" (as if they never happened).Constitution, Art. 62 When he does so en masse, this is called amnesty. This prerogative had been used several times by V√°clav Havel in order to stress the discontinuity with pre-1989 socialist regime. In 2013 V√°clav Klaus gave amnesty to about a third of prisoners disillusioning the public and attracting criticism from many, including senior judges. In the heart of the controversy appeared stopping of serious fraud cases, when the court proceedings had dragged on for more than eight years. Defending the step, Klaus mentioned the critique by the EU for lengthy court proceedings. His critics, on the other hand, argued that he needlessly interrupted delivering of justice in difficult, high-profile cases of serious financial crime, rouge privatisation and corruption. The Senate took a court action against the president, alleging high treason at the Constitutional Court. However, the Constitutional Court rejected the treason charges on the grounds that Klaus could not be charged with constitutional violations - given the fact that the charges came on the eve of the end of Klaus's term.  Analysis and criticism  = Access to justice = The report of European Union Agency for Fundamental RightsAccess to justice in Europe: an overview of challenges and opportunities. European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights. doi: 10.2811/171 criticizes the Czech Republic mainly for costs and length of legal proceedings, which is a long-term and endemic problem. It says: \\"In the Czech Republic, for example, where a considerable length of proceedings is suggested to be de-motivating for victims of discrimination, the average duration of civil proceedings can take several years in one region, yet only a few months in another.\\" It is also said to be the most frequent problem across the EU. Other issues mentioned are that legal aid is not quite sufficient (a new law is being prepared) as well as an imperfect Antidiscrimination Act, which, among other things, stipulates reverse burden of proof in antidiscrimination cases. Amnesty International's reports on the state of human rights repeatedly bring up the discrimination against Roma, especially in education.Czech Republic.

It was built in 1907, when the Post Office here became a separate government entity. Its design and construction was the most modern of the time, including a very eclectic style mixing several different traditions mainly Neo-Plateresque into a very complex design. In the 1950s, the building was modified in a way that caused stress and damage, so when the 1985 earthquake struck Mexico City, this building was heavily damaged. In the 1990s, restoration work has brought the building back to original construction and appearance. History Two service windows upon entering the Palacio de Correos from the main entrance. In 1901, the Direcci√≥n General de Correos (General Direction of Mail) was made a separate government agency. Before, it has been an administrative division of the Secretariat of Communications and Transportation. It was then decided that this function should have its own building, in part due to the volume of mail being handled annually at that time, which was about 130 million pieces. The Italian architect Adamo Boari was chosen for the project. The design is eclectic, yet Boari's design pulls the various styles used together. The military engineer Gonzalo Garita y Frontera supervised the construction. The site chosen was the old Hospital of Terceros Franciscanos, which was demolished in 1902. The foundation laid was a new technique called \\"Chicago\\" consisting of a concrete slab with a thickness of 70 cm reinforced with steel beams. This foundation was mostly constructed in New York, by the Millinken Brothers and shipped to Mexico in 1903. The first stone of the building was placed on 14 September 1902, and work on the building lasted for another five years. In 1907, the building was inaugurated by then president of Mexico, Porfirio Diaz, who, in a symbolic act, dropped two postcards into the receiving bin, one addressed to a location in Mexico City, and one addressed to a different locale in the country. For some time after it was built, this palace was also called the Quinta Casa de Correos (Fifth House of Mail), since it was the fifth building to house postal services in Mexico City. The building has remained in continuous operation as a post office since 1907. However, in the 1950s, the growing economy forced the Bank of Mexico next door to occupy a large section of the Palacio de Correos, for this reason, two bridges were built to connect the Palacio with the Bank of Mexico building. Modifications for the Bank destroyed much of the decoration elements that were originally in this section. They also added greatly to the weight of the building and have overloaded the steel structure. This would cause damage to the building, along with the 1985 Mexico City earthquake. Description Lateral stairs. Frontal view of the central stairs. Its architectural style is highly eclectic, with the building being classed as Art Nouveau, Spanish Renaissance Revival, Plateresque, Spanish Rococo style, Elizabethan Gothic, Elizabethan Plateresque and Venetian Gothic Revival and/or a mixture of each. The building also has Moorish, Neoclassical, Baroque and Art Deco elements. There is also a mix of materials and design elements from Europe and Mexico. The palace contains ornaments of marble, plaster of paris and white \\"cantera\\" stone from Puebla. The building has a steel frame and a foundation built on an enormous grid of steel beams, which has allowed it to withstand a number of earthquakes and has avoided the subsidence problem that plagues many buildings here. The post office is made with a very light-colored, almost translucent variety of a stone called \\"chiluca.\\" The exterior is covered in decorative details such as iron dragon light fixtures and intricately carved stone around the windows and the edge of the roof. Much of the metal work around the windows and other parts of the facade highly polished brass, which was made in Italy. An example of the building's complicated design is that each of the floors has windows of a different architectural style. The facade's unity is kept through the repetition of arches. The main entrance has a large ironwork canopy which is typical of the Art Nouveau that was fashionable in the early 20th century. The gallery on the fourth floor consists of slender Solomonic columns and a filigree cresting that surrounds the entire building. Inside, the marble floors and shelves combine with bronze and iron window frames manufactured in Florence, Italy. The main stairway is characterized by two separate ramps that come together to form a landing. They also seem to cross on the second landing above, after which each move off in their own direction. The meeting room contains frescos by Bartolom√© Gallotti painted over a base of 24 carat gold, with themes relating to the history of written communication and the sending of messages. Restoration Stairs. Postal Palace. From the 1950s to the 1980s, the Bank of Mexico located next door on Madero Street, occupied a large section of the Palacio. The Bank made extensive modifications to its portion of the building, such as security walls, roofing the open-air terraces and the like that added a great deal of weight and stress to the steel-beam building. This in and of itself caused damage to the building, but when the 1985 earthquake struck Mexico City, this damage was made far worse. The earthquake also severely damaged or destroy a number of buildings nearby, so when city reconstruction efforts began, the Bank decided to move out of the Palacio and build new structures nearby to house their extra offices. The building was declared an Artistic Monument on 4 May 1987, due to its beauty and history, and restoration efforts were begun in the 1990s. These efforts were significantly helped by the large number of graphic representations of the structure as it originally appeared and other documents kept by the National Archives. They were also able to locate the architect's daughter in Italy, who donated her father's plans and notes from the project. These can now be seen at the National Museum of Architecture, in the Palacio de Bellas Artes. Restoration began with the structure of the building, repairing and reinforcing the columns and steel beams damaged by the earthquake. Next came the removal of the weight added to the building by the projects done by the Bank of Mexico, restoring the floors to their original weight and construction design. Last done, was the reconstruction of the interiors that had been greatly modified and with most of the original decorative elements destroyed. For this aspect of the work, Boari's plans and notes proved invaluable. The restoration project also allowed for the technological upgrading of services. Naval History Museum View of the floor of the Naval History Museum in Mexico City. Dome of the stairs hall. The Naval Historical Museum was located until 2013 on the fourth floor of the Palace, occupying a space of 1,346 m2. The collection included models, photographs, maps and other items from the different eras of navigation in Mexico. The museum is divided into six areas, labeled A through F each relating to a particular era or aspect of Mexico maritime history. Section A is dedicated to the origins of navigation both in the Old and New Worlds up to the first maps of the New World. Section B deals with maritime events of New Spain. Section C deals with the time period after Mexico gained her Independence in 1821 until the beginning of the 20th century. Section D covers the Mexican Revolution from 1910 to 1920, including the battle between the \\"Tampico\\" and the \\"Guerrero\\" as well as the United States occupation of Veracruz. Section E is entitled \\"Modern Mexico\\" and covers the decades between 1920 and 1970, which includes Mexico's part in World War II. The last section, F, is titled \\"Contemporary Mexico\\" from 1970 to 2004, which focuses on the Mexican Navy's latest acquisitions as well as future projects. Paintings are mostly portraits such as those of Pedro Sainz de Baranda y Borreyro, Blas God√≠nez Brito, Jos√© Sebasti√°n Holzinger, Lieutenant Jos√© Azueta Abad, Cadete Virgilio and Uribe Roble and of historical events such as the defense of the Fort of San Juan de Ul√∫a during the French Intervention in Mexico, the bombing of the Port of Veracruz in 1846, the lake battle of the Spanish Conquest of Tenochtitlan, the naval battle between the \\"Tampico\\" and the \\"Guerrero\\", and the sinking of the \\"Potrero del Llano.\\" References External links Panoramic view into the staircase of Palacio Postal, 2007.

History  In 2005, Doyle left New Jersey for Las Vegas and began auditioning members for his own band, Gorgeous Frankenstein. The same year, he appeared on stage with Danzig numerous times throughout their tour and lead vocalist Glenn Danzig offered to produce Gorgeous Frankenstein first eponymous album on his record Label Evilive. The name of the band is a combination of both Doyle Wolfgang Von Frankenstein and his wife Stephanie Bellars (Gorgeous George) names into a portmanteau concept. = Members and lineups = In 2006, Doyle and Danzig had recruited bassist Argyle Goolsby (lead vocalist of Blitzkid) and hired British comic book artist Simon Bisley to do the cover artwork (Bisley previously published some of his works at Verotik, Danzig's mature-themed comic books company). The musical arrangements of the band's debut album were completed before July 2007, but Doyle did not yet find a vocalist., He finally recruited vocalist Landon Blood for the recordings of the album and ex-Blitzkid drummer Jesco Devilanse (Andrew \\"Stipes\\" Winter). Later in 2007, Gorgeous Frankenstein played their first tour, opening for Danzig. This line up included Argyle Goolsby (who also acted as lead vocalist, since Landon Blood left the band) and Dr. Chud on drums.

The line follows the route of the Lea Valley, serving intermediate towns and villages. It branches off the West Anglia Main Line north of , and could be seen as part of the Lea Valley lines‚Äîa collection of commuter routes into London. It is in length. History In June 1841 the Northern and Eastern Railway (N&ER;) was given parliamentary assent to construct a branch from Broxbourne to Hertford. Work on the line began early in 1843 and the branch (and all stations on it) was opened as a single track on 31 October of that year. Operation by the N&ER; was short-lived as it had already agreed that the Eastern Counties Railway would lease its lines (then from Stratford to Bishop's Stortford as well as the Hertford East branch). The line was doubled in October 1846. The original Hertford station was opened in 1843. It was sited to avoid two nearby schools, but later it was closed and in 1888 Hertford East station was opened further west and closer to the town centre. Another station existed in 1858 on the line from Hatfield, but this closed as soon as Hertford North station opened in 1924. Part of the Hertford East branch was used for the Buntingford Branch Railway, or \\"The Bunt\\", a railway which ran from Buntingford to London from 1863 to 1964. The Buntingford Railway split off this line just to the north of St Margarets station. Route and services The line curves away from Broxbourne to the left and heads towards Hertford. For most of its length, it is bounded by the New River on its south side and the River Lea and Lee Navigation on the north side. Towns and villages served are: *Broxbourne *Rye House on the outskirts of Hoddesdon *St Margarets and neighbouring Stanstead Abbotts *Ware *Hertford East. The line is part of the Network Rail Strategic Route 5, SRS 05.03 and is classified as a London and South East Commuter line. There are currently two trains an hour on this line serving all stations. Future plans for this line see the lengthening of platforms to facilitate longer trains and create extra capacity on the line. Services on this line are currently operated by Greater Anglia using Class 317 units with either 4 or 8 coaches. Usually, trains on the Hertford East branch line go to Liverpool Street (on Mondays to Saturdays, via Tottenham Hale and Hackney Downs), and Stratford (on Sundays). On days of engineering works, train services would often terminate at Broxbourne. Passenger volume Below is the passenger usage from the year beginning April 2002 to the year beginning April 2010. Infrastructure The line is double track throughout except for a small section through where it is single track.

Developed and certified in 1991, the Grob G 520 is one of the world's largest fully composite manned aircraft and holder of several world records, whose production was resumed in 2014.  Development  G 520 in 1991 The Grob G 520 ‚ÄòEGRETT‚Äô (former Grob/E-Systems/AlliedSignal Egrett ‚Äì its name is derived from the three companies involved in its design: E-Systems, Grob Aircraft, and Garrett,Taylor 1996, p.172. the latter firm later changing its name to AlliedSignal) is a surveillance aircraft developed in Germany in the 1980s by an international partnership. It was intended to fill a joint German Air Force ‚Äì US Air Force requirement for a high-altitude, long-duration surveillance platform for treaty verification and environmental monitoring. Known as \\"LAPAS\\" (Luftgest√ºtztes, abstandsf√§higes Prim√§r- Aufkl√§rungssystem, engl: airborne, long distance primary reconnaissance system) in Germany and \\"Senior Guardian\\" in the US, the program initially attempted to acquire the Lockheed TR-1 (U-2) for this role, but when this did not succeed, a new aircraft was sought. inflight, showing the high wing aspect ratio The initial D-450 EGRETT I development aircraft flew in 1987, and in September the following year set a class altitude record of 16,329.35 m (53,573.96 ft). Two pre-production machines followed in 1989 and 1990 as the D-500 EGRETT II and then fitted out to the finalized G 520 design in 1991. These latter two aircraft were owned by E-Systems and Grob respectively, and used for promotional purposes: E-Systems' for various sensor packages, and Grob's (renamed the Strato 1) to market the design to civil authorities as a resource management platform. Grob G 520T VH-ARA after landing in Germany In 1992, the German Air Force placed an order for production of nine EGRETT IIs, to be supplemented by G 520T two-seat trainer and one of the demonstrators.Lambert 1993, pp. 138‚Äì140. However, in February 1993, before much production had taken place, the whole program was cancelled when Eastern Europe ceased to be perceived as a threat. The two-seater-version G 520T was completed and sold to Airborne Research Australia in Adelaide. In 2014, Grob Aircraft repurchased the G 520T and flew it back to Germany.TV documentation: Return of the G 520T http://www.br.de/mediathek/video/sendungen/abendschau- der-sueden/grob-flugzeug-mindelheim-100.html The repainted aircraft will be presented to the public during the Farnborough Airshow 2014, simultaneously as kick-off for resuming the production of the G 520T.Farnborough: Return of the Grob Egrett http://www.flugrevue.de/militaerluftfahrt/kampfflugzeuge- helikopter/grob-egrett-kehrt-zurueck/581998 As of 2014 the G 520 held several world records. This aircraft established three world records for altitude, time to climb in 1988. In addition, it was the first composite aircraft specifically designed for stratospheric research and reached a record altitude of 53,573.96 feet (16.329,35 meters).G 520 - Records http://grob- aircraft.com/index.php/records.html *Time to climb to 15,000 meters: 40 minutes 47 seconds *Altitude in horizontal flight: 16,238.55 meters (53,276.09 feet) *Altitude without payload: 16,329.35 meters (53,573.96 feet)  Design  G 520T during ground testing The G 520 is a fully composite conventional mid-wing monoplane with extremely high aspect ratio wings. Power is provided by a single turboprop Honeywell TPE 331-14F with a 4-blade Hartzell propeller, and it is equipped with a tricycle undercarriage, whose main units retract into fairings on the wings. The flexible payload-bay concept of the G 520 can accommodate multiple mission systems for both civilian and military applications and 12 payload compartments for up to 850 kg of mission equipment make the G 520 an ideal multi-role platform for a wide range of missions. The cockpit of the G 520T provides room for a pilot and a sensor operator as well as for equipment which has to be placed inside the pressurized cabin. The instrument panel can be optionally equipped with a digital glass cockpit IDU-680 EFIS by Genesys Aerosystems. Variants =G 520T= The G 520T is a two-seater version of the G 520. Initially planned for training and demonstration purposes, the only ever build G 520T was repurchased by Grob Aircraft in 2014 and transferred to Germany in June 2014. The production of the G 520T will be resumed in 2014. =G 520NG= The G 520NG will be the revised production version of the initial G 520T.

Israel utilizes the funds for economic development projects. Matza was recommended for the post in 2002 by then-Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and then-Finance Minister Silvan Shalom. Matza served 18 years in the Knesset, Israel‚Äôs parliament, as a member of the Likud party.Knesset bio He was a cabinet minister in the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, holding the portfolio of minister of health. Matza also served 20 years on the Jerusalem City Council, 10 of which were in the capacity of deputy mayor. Biography The Matza family first arrived in Palestine from Ioannina in Greece, and settled in the Jewish Quarter in Jerusalem's walled Old City. Matza was born in the city during the British Mandate era. Influenced by his family's attitude, Matza joined the Jewish underground group Lehi at age 14. Of his three brothers, two were also active in the Jewish underground; one in the Haganah and the other in the Irgun.Archaeologist cracks mysterious message on Jerusalem prison wall His Lehi activities included posting anti-British flyers during the night, participating in paramilitary activities, and helping to hide weapons, sometimes in synagogues behind the arks where Torah scrolls were kept. During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Jerusalem was the scene of intense fighting, and Matza participated in an operation that enabled Lehi fighters to blast their way into the Old City. The operation entailed planting a bomb outside the New Gate of the Old City walls. However, the plan was aborted when the bomb failed to detonate. Following the end of the war in 1949, Matza resumed his schooling, which he had suspended during his underground activities. Upon completing his high school education, Matza entered the Israel Defense Forces, where he attained the rank of captain in the artillery corps. Following his national service, he began university studies, focusing on law and accounting. He began his private sector career with a Jerusalem accounting firm. Political career Matza first entered politics by joining Menachem Begin's right-wing Herut party. As a member of Herut's Jerusalem branch, Matza ran in Jerusalem's 1965 municipal elections and was voted onto the City Council. The elections also brought Teddy Kollek to power as mayor of Jerusalem. In 1969 Matza was elected deputy mayor; among his responsibilities was the beautification of Jerusalem, including the establishment of gardens and parks throughout the city. In 1978, by which time Herut had merged into Likud, Jerusalem held municipal elections based on voting for a candidate as opposed to the traditional method of voting for a party slate. Matza ran for city mayor, but lost to the incumbent, Teddy Kollek. Prior to the 1984 Knesset elections Matza was placed on Likud's list. When the party won 41 seats, Matza took his place in the Knesset. He sat on the influential Finance Committee until 1988, when he retained his seat in elections that year. Re-elected in 1992 and 1996, he was appointed Minister of Health under Netanyahu in November 1996, and also sat on the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. When it appeared his efforts to increase the Health Ministry budget would go unfulfilled, Matza abstained from a key Knesset vote on the national budget. According to Israeli law, the budget must pass three Knesset readings by a specified date, otherwise the government will fall. In protest to what he viewed as insufficient allocations to the Health Ministry, Matza refused to participate in the vote. Following Matza's protest, Netanyahu agreed to increase government health allocations. Although Matza retained his seat in the 1999 elections, Likud were defeated by Ehud Barak's One Israel alliance. Barak involvement in discussions with Palestinian Authority leader Yasser Arafat over the division of Jerusalem led to Matza (then chairman of the Internal Affairs and Environment Committee) submitting a bill to amend the Jerusalem Law. The bill, which passed with the approval of 84 out of 120 Knesset members, stipulated that no decisions changing the status of Jerusalem could be made without majority consent. Israel Bonds Although Likud regained power following the special election for Prime Minister in 2001 (which was won by Ariel Sharon), Matza was offered a role as deputy minister. However, he chose to remain as a Knesset member. Soon thereafter, however, Matza was elected as president and CEO of the Israel Bonds organization by its board of directors. Matza resigned from the Knesset (he was replaced by Eli Cohen) and moved to New York City in March 2002.

Two previous sets of dimensions had existed before, though these were only for specific shipbuilding programs running for only a given amount of time. In contrast, the 1706 Establishment was intended to be permanent. Origins Dimensions for ships had been established for the \\"Thirty Ships\\" building program of 1677, and while these dimensions saw use until 1695, this was merely because of the success of the 1677 ships and the lack of perceived need to change them. Dimensions were then laid down for the 1691 \\"Twenty-seven Ships\\" program to build seventeen eighty-gun and ten sixty- gun double-decked ships of the line, though the dimensions were abandoned before the program was complete, with the final four eighty-gun ships being constructed with three gun-decks. The origins of the formalized 1706 Establishment can be traced to February 1705, when Prince George of Denmark, the Lord High Admiral at the time, ordered the Navy Board to determine a set of dimensions for second-rate ships. Though the second-rate ships appear to have been the central focus of the Establishment, the Board was also directed to consider dimensions for ships of the third- (80 and 70 guns), fourth- (60 and 50 guns), and fifth-rate ships (40 and 30 guns). Because of their rarity and power, first rates were not addressed by the Establishment and were given individual designs, whilst smaller vessels had a low enough cost to allow experimentation. The Navy Board used existing ships considered to be the best in their respective classes as the bases for these dimensions. Implementation The Navy Board produced sets of dimensions for ships from forty, fifty, sixty, seventy, eighty, and ninety guns (they decided against doing so for thirty-gun ships). After a last-minute adjustment created by Admiral George Churchill, the dimensions were sent out to the dockyards together with an order that they were to be strictly adhered to, and that they should apply to rebuilds as well as new ships. The implementation of the Establishment - the first of many - began an era of notorious conservatism in naval administration. Though there would be no significant technological changes until the following century, the naval architecture of the 1706 Establishment slowly became more antiquated for the early eighteenth century. Individual ship types =90-gun second-rates=Seven existing second-rates were rebuilt to the 1706 Establishment, including three whose reconstruction was ordered in 1704-1705. These first three were the Marlborough of 1706 (rebuilt from the old Saint Michael), Blenheim of 1709 (rebuilt from the old Duchess) and the Vanguard of 1710. The other four ships were the Neptune of 1710, Ossory of 1711, Sandwich of 1715 and Barfleur of 1716. These ships were originally armed as 96-gun ships under the 1703 Establishment of Guns. They were re-armed as 90-gun ships under the 1716 Establishment of Guns, with heavier 32-lb and 9-lb on the lower and upper decks (the middle deck 18-lb were unaltered), but with one pair of 6-lb removed from each of the partial decks above to leave: *Quarter deck - 10 √ó 6-lb *Forecastle - 2 √ó 6-lb *Roundhouse - nil =80-gun third-rates=Eight of the older type of two-decker 80-gun ships were rebuilt as three- deckers under the 1706 Establishment - the Boyne and Humber launched in 1708, the Russell in 1709, the Dorsetshire in 1712, the Newark and Shrewsbury in 1713, Cambridge in 1715 and Torbay in 1719. In addition, two new ships were built to this specification as replacements for ships lost in 1707 - the Devonshire and Cumberland both being launched in 1710. The ships were initially armed with 80 guns as per the 1703 Establishment of Guns, as shown in the table at right. The 1716 Establishment of Guns replaced the 24-pounder guns on the lower deck by an equal number of 32-lb. It also added one pair of 6-lb to the upper deck, removing one pair of 6-lb from the quarter deck. =70-gun third-rates=Following the loss of four 70-gun ships in a single night during the Great Storm on 27 November 1703, four replacements were ordered from the Royal Dockyards just three weeks later - the Northumberland, Resolution and Stirling Castle being launched in 1705 and the Nassau in 1707. Another four were ordered in 1705-1706, again from the Dockyards - the Elizabeth and Restoration launched in 1706, while another Resolution and Captain were launched in 1708. Subsequently, two more ships were newbuilt (the Grafton and Hampton Court, both launched in 1709) and three rebuilt from existing third-rates (the Edgar and Yarmouth in 1709, and Orford in 1713) by contract; and another five were rebuilt in the Dockyards - the Royal Oak, Expedition, Suffolk, Monmouth and Revenge. The ships were initially armed with 70 guns as per the 1703 Establishment of Guns, as shown in the table at right. Under the 1716 Establishment, a thirteenth pair of 24-lb was added on the lower deck, while the demi-culverins (9-lb) on the upper deck were upgraded to 12-lb. An extra pair of 6-lb was added to the quarter deck, while the 3-lb were removed from the roundhouse to retain the total at 70 guns. =60-gun fourth-rates=Four 60-gun ships were newbuilt to the 1706 Establishment - the Plymouth launched in 1708, the Lion and Gloucester in 1709, and the Rippon in 1712 - while four existing 60-gun ships were rebuilt to the same specification from 1714 onwards - the \\"Lyme\\", Medway, Kingston and Nottingham.s As per the 1703 Establishment of Guns, the ships were initially armed with 64 guns as shown in the table at right. The 1716 Establishment of Guns replaced the 18-lb on the lower deck by 24-lb, and reduced the ships to 60 guns by removing one pair of 6-lb from the quarter deck and another pair from the forecastle to result in a composition of: **Lower deck: 24 24-lb **Upper deck: 26 9-lb **Quarter deck: 8 6-lb **Forecastle: 2 6-lb =50-gun fourth-rates=Eleven new 50-gun ships were built to the 1706 Establishment (all as replacements for fourth-rates lost during the war years from 1703 onwards) - the Salisbury launched in 1707, the Falmouth, Ruby, Chester and Romney in 1708, the Pembroke in 1710, the Bristol, Gloucester and Ormonde in 1711, the Advice in 1712 and the Strafford in 1715. Another existing eight ships were rebuilt to the same specification - the Dragon in 1707, the Warwick and Bonaventure in 1711, the Assistance in 1713, the Worcester in 1714, and the Rochester, Panther and Dartmouth in 1716. These vessels were initially armed as 54-gun ships to the 1703 Establishment of Guns (see table to right). Under the 1716 Establishment of Guns, they were re- classed as 50-gun ships with the following armament: **Lower deck: 22 18-lb **Upper deck: 22 9-lb **Quarter deck: 4 6-lb **Forecastle: 2 6-lb =40-gun fifth-rates=Fifteen 42-gun ships were newbuilt to the dimensions of the 1706 Establishment - the Ludlow Castle, Gosport, Portsmouth and Hastings launched in 1707, the Pearl, Mary Galley, Sapphire and Southsea Castle in 1708, the Enterprise, Adventure and Fowey in 1709, Charles Galley in 1710, Launceston in 1711, Faversham in 1712 and Lynn in 1715. Two similar ships were built on speculation by the contractor William Johnson at Blackwall and purchased by the Navy Board - the Looe in 1707 and Diamond in 1708. A further 40-gun ship was also built nominally to the same specification - the Royal Anne Galley of 1709 - but she emerged longer and leaner than the others. The ships were initially armed to the 1703 Establishment of Guns (see table to right). Under the 1716 Gun Establishment, they became 40-gun ships, with an armament as follows: **Lower deck: 20 12-lb **Upper deck: 20 6-lb **Quarter deck: nil **Forecastle: nil =30-gun fifth-rates= While no formal set of recommendations for 30-gun ships was produced by the Navy Board in the 1706 Establishment, a de facto set of dimensions was adopted, which were used for the construction of two new 32-gun fifth-rates (Sweepstakes in 1708 and Scarborough in 1711), while the Bedford Galley was rebuilt to slightly smaller dimensions in 1709: *Tons burthen: 416 bm *Length: (gundeck) (keel) *Beam: *Hold depth: *Complement: 145 officers and men (110 in peacetime) *Armament: 32 guns(1703 Establishment) **Lower deck: 4 9-lb **Upper deck: 22 6-lb **Quarter deck: 6 4-lb **Forecastle: nil The 1716 Establishment of Guns altered their armament to 30 guns: **Lower deck: 8 9-lb **Upper deck: 20 6-lb **Quarter deck: 2 4-lb **Forecastle: nil References History of the Royal Navy 18th-century ships ","title":"1706 Establishment"},{"id":"16076506","text":"The Particle Astrophysics Magnet Facility (commonly known as ASTROMAG) is a NASA project that was designed to investigate anti-matter. It consisted of a series of experiments which would culminate in an experiment launched in 1995 to be externally attached to the Freedom Space Station History Experiments and postulation conducted during the 1970s and 1980s revealed a higher number of anti-protons than had been expected and to verify, and investigate further, a series of experiments were designed to culminate in an experiment launched for attachment to the Space Station. = ALICE and LEAP = In preparation for the building of the detectors and superconducting magnets to be used in the experiment some smaller ones were conducted in the upper atmosphere mounted underneath high altitude balloons: ALICE (A Large Isotropic Composition Experiment) and LEAP (Low Energy Antiproton Experiment) being the most notable. ALICE was launched from Prince Albert Airport, Canada on 15 August 1987. It was designed to measure the isotopic composition of the rays entering Earth's atmosphere and so identify the types of particles which ASTROMAG would study in more detail. LEAP was launched twice also from Prince Albert, in July and August 1987 and measured the ratios between protons and anti-protons to try to establish verification in earlier experiments that reported higher than expected numbers of anti-protons. ASTROMAG The original proposal was made in 1987 and announced in 1988 for implementation on the Freedom space station. The experiment was tested, accepted in 1989 and due for launch in 1995 but after various problems with other flights it was demoted from first to fifth place on the schedule. The experiment, called the Particle Astrophysics Magnet Facility, was given the name ASTROMAG (NASA designated ASTRMAG) as it used a large superconducting magnet to deflect particles into its detectors. The magnet was made superconducting by being cooled to 2 kelvins. The hope was that the detectors would discover the oppositely charged anti-protons and so help physicists to use matter‚Äìantimatter reactions to develop new propulsions systems based on the resulting expulsion of energy. The experiment was to be mounted on the outside of the Space Station and measured and projections of costs were estimated at $30 million. This was one of the first aimed at capturing material and particle data to further understand the origins and evolution of matter in the composition of the Universe. The experiment was to collect data from collisions of very high velocity particles by measuring their spectrum and attempting to find negatively charged helium or heavier elements. Eventually the delays in NASA missions and the shutdown of the Space Station led ASTROMAG to suffer a non-launch and the mission was shelved in 1991. =Free Flyer= The free flyer version was to be launched in 2005 into Earth orbit at a height of . It aimed to detect high energy (>1 GeV per nucleon) cosmic ray nuclei, as well as electrons, to search for antimatter and dark matter candidates. =BESS= After the experiment was not launched researchers continued experiments using BESS and the methods employed by ALICE and LEAP in 1987. The latest attempt was a new Nuclear Compton Telescope (NCY) which was successfully test flown on 1 June 2005 from the Scientific Balloon Flight Facility, Fort Sumner, New Mexico. Its subsequent missions went well and some useful data was collected until it unfortunately failed to launch in April 2010 at Alice Springs, Australia, when the balloon broke its tether to the crane in high winds. Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer The experiment was superseded by the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer which was approved by Congress. An earlier smaller test version called the AMS-01 was flown in 1998 on the shuttle Discovery during a flight to the Mir Russian space station. AMS-02 was delivered to the International Space Station in 2011.

He made appearances in The Football League for four clubs between 1926 and 1938. Playing career Frank, the brother of England international Warney Cresswell, was with local non‚Äìleague side Tyne Dock and then at Football League side South Shields before moving to First Division side Sunderland in time for the 1926‚Äì27 season. He made 13 appearances for the Black Cats over the next three years and then spent a season playing for Second Division side West Bromwich Albion. In 1930, Cresswell joined Cheshire County League side Chester after a spell with Connah's Quay Nomads, one of several signings ahead of the 1930‚Äì31 season made by new manager Charlie Hewitt as Chester became known as the 'Arsenal of the North'. Cresswell scored 27 goals as Chester finished runners‚Äìup to Port Vale Reserves and were elected to The Football League. Cresswell had been contracted to West Brom during the season due to the transfer system in place at the time and officially joined Chester in time for their first season in The Football League in part‚Äìexchange for the prolific Arthur Gale. Cresswell helped create Chester's first goal in Division Three North against Wigan Borough and played regularly in the number 10 shirt before being transferred to Second Division side Notts County midway through 1933‚Äì34 for ¬£2,500. But he returned to Sealand Road at the start of the following season after struggling to settle at his new club. The 1935‚Äì36 season saw Chester finish runners‚Äìup in Division Three North, with Cresswell scoring twice in a club record 12‚Äì0 win over York City on 1 February 1936. But the following month saw him suffer a broken kneecap in a match against Walsall. Some fans felt this injury cost Chester the championship. He did not play for two years, with five league games in the closing stages of 1937‚Äì38 bringing to an end his playing career. This brief return to action included a goal in a 2‚Äì1 derby win over Wrexham to take his club league tally to 57, which is Chester's ninth highest in Football League matches.

Early life He was born in 1884 in Affaltrach, now called Obersulm, W√ºrttemberg, Germany. Political career He was a member of the German Social Democratic Party prior to the First World War. He edited Volksfreund, one of the party newspapers, and from, he 1916 worked on Spartakusbriefe, the official paper of the Independent Social Democratic Party (USPD). Thalheimer became a founder member of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD), and he was recognised as its main theorist. He edited Rote Fahne and the manuscripts that Franz Mehring left unpublished at his death. Thalheimer was part of the local government in W√ºrttemberg serving as Minister of Finance during the crisis of 1923. He and Heinrich Brandler were blamed for the consequences and summoned to Moscow in 1924. There, he worked for the Comintern and the Marx-Engels Institute. In 1927, Thalheimer gave a series of lectures at the Moscow Sun Yat-sen University that were then published as a textbook in philosophy (the English translation appeared as Introduction to Dialectical Materialism, New York, 1936). He also worked with Bukharin on the draft programme of the Comintern. Unease with the leadership of Ernst Th√§lmann made him return to the KPD in Germany in 1928. However, a year later, he and Brandler were expelled from the KPD and they went on to form the Communist Party Opposition (KPO).On his heterodox interpretation of Marxism, see Theodor Bergmann: August Thalheimer - ein kommunistischer Ketzer. Zu seinem 60. Todestag, in: Jahrbuch f√ºr Forschungen zur Geschichte der Arbeiterbewegung, No. III/2008. The KPO criticised the foreign policy of the Soviet Union but not its domestic policies. Thalheimer stated: \\"We do not want to draw the conclusion that as the politics of the Comintern are wrong, it must follow that the politics of Russia are also wrong\\". (Gegen den Strom, 4/1931) Thalheimer supported/both forced collectivisation and Stakhanovism. Thalheimer went into exile in Paris from 1932. Beginning at the start of 1935 Thalheimer began writing a regular column on international news for Workers Age, the official newspaper of the Communist Party of the USA (Opposition), headed by Jay Lovestone.\\"August Thalheimer Joins Workers Age Staff,\\" Workers Age, vol. 3, no. 21 (December 1, 1934), pg. 8. Thalheimer went to Barcelona, Spain, in 1936. Here he became involved in an argument with Andr√©s Nin over the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification's (POUM) condemnation of the first Moscow Trial. He soon returned to France again to work with the KPO in exile. In July 1937, when six members of the KPO in Barcelona were arrested by the Stalinists, he issued a joint statement with Brandler: > \\"We take upon ourselves any political and personal guarantee for our > arrested comrades. They are anti-Fascists and revolutionaries, incapable of > any action that could be construed as high treason to the Spanish > Revolution.\\" Later life In 1940, after the German conquest of France, Thalheimer fled to Cuba. He died in Havana in 1948. Works * \\"1923: A Missed Opportunity? The German October Legend and the Real History of 1923.\\" (1931) Mike Jones, trans. London: Marken Press, 1993. * ‚ÄúOn Fascism‚Äù.

It began previews on 5 April 2008 and officially opened at the New London Theatre in London's West End on 22 April 2008. The production was directed by Sir Trevor Nunn and featured sets by John Napier and costumes by Andreane Neofitu. Darius Danesh and Jill Paice starred as Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara respectively. The show was produced by Aldo Scrofani, Colin Ingram, Gary McAvay and the Nederlander Producing Company. The production closed on 14 June 2008, after 79 performances. History This was not the first musical version of Gone with the Wind. A musical adaptation by Harold Rome played a year at the Drury Lane Theatre in 1972, starring June Ritchie as Scarlett, and featuring Bonnie Langford. Margaret Martin, a newcomer to songwriting and playwriting, contacted the Stephen Mitchell Trust, sending tapes of songs and a draft script, and the Trust eventually agreed to give her the rights to make an adaptation of Gone with the Wind. At about the same time, Martin learned that Nunn was extremely interested in American history, and she sent him the materials as well. They collaborated on revisions over the next couple of years, which resulted in a workshop production in London in 2004.New York Times article featuring Margaret Martin With the support of the Mitchell Trust and producer Aldo Scrofani of Columbia Artists Theatricals, plans began forming for the West End production.

The slaves are working (\\"Born to be Free\\"), and Scarlett discovers that Ashley Wilkes, who she secretly loves, is to marry his cousin, Melly Hamilton. Scarlett's father returns home (\\"On Your Land\\"), and the family hold evening prayers (\\"Ellen's Prayer\\"). Scarlett dresses for the barbecue at the Wilkes' plantation. The guests arrive (\\"Gentle People\\"), and they speculate about dashing Rhett Butler's past. Scarlett flirts with every man to try to get Ashley's attention. Charles Hamilton, Melly's brother, falls in love with Scarlett, while the women pass judgement on her (\\"She's No Lady\\"). The men talk about the War, and Rhett states his opinion. Ashley finds Scarlett in the library. She tells him that she loves him, he replies that he cares for her (\\"Softly\\"), but is to be married. As Ashley leaves, Scarlett sees that Rhett has been in the library and has overheard, telling her she's \\"no lady\\" (\\"She's No Lady\\" (reprise)). Outside, Charles Hamilton tells her that war has been declared, and as she cannot have Ashley, she agrees to marry him. The men are excited at the prospect of War (\\"Come Join the Troop\\"). The couples marry, and both Charles and Ashley join the War. She receives news of Charles' death, and in due time, their son Wade is born. Scarlett is upset to be a widow with a baby, and her family send her to Atlanta to the home of Aunt Pittypat. In Atlanta, Scarlett is introduced to the society ladies (\\"The Very Best People\\"). The Hamilton ladies are still in mourning for Charles, but they help at the bazaar to raise war funds. Rhett arrives (\\"I'm Your Man\\"), and Dr. Meade proposes an auction, with the men bidding to lead the dances with the lady of their choice. Rhett bids for Scarlett and scandalises society as he dances with her while she is still in mourning. Mr. O'Hara hears about the scandal and wants to bring Scarlett home, but Scarlett blackmails her father into letting her stay; she wishes that she could be \\"Scarlett O'Hara Again\\". In 1863, Rhett brings news from the War and gives out the casualty lists; there are many men dead, and the women of the city lament (\\"Can This Be All?\\") Ashley comes home on leave, and Scarlett promises him that she'll look after Melly; he kisses her as he leaves. At Mrs. Elsing's home, Rhett questions the War, and Melly defends him as he has the same opinion as Ashley. Melly is pregnant, but news arrives that Ashley is missing. The fighting closes in on Atlanta, but Melly cannot be moved in her condition, and Scarlett has to stay with her. Prissy says that she can help out with the birth. Rhett asks Scarlett to be his mistress (\\"I'm Your Man\\" (reprise)), but she refuses. Melly goes into labour, but the doctor is busy with wounded soldiers. Prissy knows nothing about childbirth, so Scarlett is left to deliver the baby herself. The Yankee army is very near, so Prissy finds Rhett, and they all flee the burning city. Outside Atlanta, stung by Scarlett's words, Rhett goes off to join the army, kissing her as he leaves. Scarlett makes her way back to Tara, but discovers that her mother has died, and her father is mad with grief. She walks to Ashley's plantation, but finds it in ruins. The life she once knew is gone forever (\\"Gone With The Wind\\"). =Act II= With the declaration that the slaves within the Confederacy are freed (\\"Born to be Free\\" (reprise)), everything is in scarce supply during 1864. Scarlett says that everyone must work the fields. She shoots and kills a Yankee thief at Tara before ransacking his belongings with Melly (\\"Desperate Times\\"). In 1865, the War is over and Ashley makes his way home. With Reconstruction after the War, the taxes on Tara have increased. Ashley tells Scarlett the world has passed him by, and only Rhett has money now. Scarlett says that they should run away together. Ashley refuses but admits that he loves her. Scarlett plans to find Rhett and get the money from him. In Atlanta, Scarlett visits Rhett in gaol and tries to pretend that all is well, but he sees her rough hands and realises that she wants money. Scarlett offers to become his mistress, but Rhett refuses as he hasn't any money in Atlanta, and he knows her too well (\\"Nobody Knows You\\"). Scarlett thinks Tara is lost, but on her way home, she meets Frank Kennedy. He boasts of his business and wealth, and seeing him as a way to save Tara, Scarlett lies that Suellen is marrying another. Two weeks later, Scarlett marries Frank and pays the taxes for Tara. Scarlett runs Frank's businesses, but the gossips of Atlanta think her behaviour is wrong. Prissy opines that the world has changed since the War (\\"I'm Gonna Find My Own\\"). It is now 1866, and Scarlett hears that her father has died (\\"On Your Land\\" (reprise)). Ashley wants to leave Tara, but Scarlett persuades Melly that they must come to Atlanta instead. Scarlett bears Frank's daughter, Ella, and she still runs the businesses despite the danger of travelling alone. Scarlett is attacked while passing the shanty town; Ashley and Frank leave to exact revenge. Men come looking to arrest Ashley for the Klan raid, as Rhett arrives home with Ashley, apparently drunk, with a false alibi about spending the evening with a prostitute. Rhett tells Scarlett that her husband was killed, but Scarlett is more worried about Ashley being injured. As Frank lies in his coffin, Scarlett is drunk, and she agrees to marry Rhett. The slaves celebrate their freedom (\\"Wings of a Dove\\"), but they have misgivings about some of the changes. Scarlett and Rhett return from their honeymoon with gifts, including a petticoat for Mammy, who declares she won't wear it as she does not like Captain Butler. Ashley cannot run Scarlett's mill at a profit, and she tells him he should use convict labour. Ashley cannot bear to see how brutal Scarlett has become, and he blames Rhett. Scarlett realises that Ashley still loves her, and she tells Rhett that she will no longer share a bedroom with him. Rhett says that this is no hardship to him; he is then seen with other women. Scarlett invites her old and new friends to her 'crush' (\\"Reconstruction Bounty\\"), but her old friends criticise her and leave. A drunken Rhett argues with Scarlett about Ashley, saying that tonight, instead of three people, there'll be \\"Just Two!\\" as he forcefully takes her to his bed. The next morning, Rhett has gone, but Scarlett realises that he loves her. Later, she is dismayed to find that she is pregnant again, but Rhett is delighted. In 1867, Scarlett gives birth to a girl, Bonnie. Mammy finally accepts Captain Butler and wears the petticoat. Rhett restores his reputation with society for Bonnie's sake. Bonnie has nightmares and is afraid of the dark, so Rhett sings a lullaby (\\"Once Upon a Time\\"). Scarlett tells Mammy that she wants to love Bonnie, but the child only cares for her father (\\"Every Child\\"). By 1871, Bonnie is learning to ride her pony, but when she tries to take a jump, she is thrown to the ground. Bonnie dies, and Scarlett blames Rhett. In his grief, he refuses to bury her as she was afraid of the dark, and it takes kind words from Melly to comfort him. Rhett says a final goodbye to Bonnie (\\"Once Upon a Time\\" (reprise)). Scarlett feels all alone, and Rhett feels like a stranger (\\"Alone\\"). Melly becomes ill with a miscarriage. On her deathbed, she tells Scarlett to look after Ashley, and to be kind to Rhett as he helped her with money without Ashley knowing. Outside, Scarlett realises that Ashley loves Melly, and he never loved her. She runs home, telling Rhett that she must have loved him for years. But she is too late; he says it is over. Scarlett asks him what she will do if he goes, but as he leaves, he says that he doesn't \\"give a damn\\". Scarlett decides to return to Tara, knowing that she will win Rhett back somehow as tomorrow is another day (\\"Gone With The Wind\\" (reprise)). Differences from the novel and film The musical's story is generally more faithful to the novel than the film, with Scarlett's three children appearing, unlike the film, which portrayed only Bonnie. One character not included on stage is Belle Watling, the prostitute. The slaves have a greater voice, especially Prissy, whose character is different from the film or novel, as she sings of finding her own way in the world and teaching others.

These, and several reprises, were cut in May 2008. Critical response Reviews of the musical were generally negative. Critics found fault with the work's structure and score, stating \\"the large ensemble combines dialogue with passages of narration from the novel. The songs seem constantly to interrupt the proceedings rather than deepening or advancing the narrative.\\" However, Paul Taylor of The Independent noted that \\"the score is enriched with spirituals, blues and gospel music, spine-tinglingly well-sung by such cast members as Natasha Yvette Williams's loveably sassy Mammy and Jina Burrows' Prissy.\\" Taylor also praised Danesh and Paice: \\"The diabolically dashing Darius Danesh brings a seductively insolent charm, a dark velvet voice and a genuine, fugitive pathos to the cynical blockade runner. If Jill Paice hasn't quite nailed the comic, outrageously feline wiliness of Scarlett, she boasts the bright, soaring vocal quality to convey the heroine's indomitable survivor's drive.\\" Christopher Hart of The Sunday Times wrote, \\"Frankly, I fear, you won't give a damn.\\"Hart, Christopher. \\"Gone with the Wind is nothing more than a flatulent raspberry\\", The Sunday TimesRoundup of review quotes: Akbar, Arifa. \\"Nunn hopes a shorter 'Gone with the Wind' will make the critics sweeter\\", The Independent, 3 May 2008 References External links *\\"New music theatre adaptation of Gone With the Wind at New London Theatre in April 2008\\", 1 June 2007 *\\"Actors picked for Trevor Nunn's 'Gone With the Wind' musical\\" 2 February 2008 West End musicals 2008 musicals Musicals based on films Musicals based on novels Works based on Gone with the Wind ","title":"Gone with the Wind (musical)"},{"id":"16076581","text":"Desert Center Unified School District is located in the eastern part of Riverside County in California.

Kaiser Middle SchoolEagle Mountain - California Ghost Town  History  Life as it had been known in Eagle Mountain for the previous 35 years came to an end in June, 1983 when Kaiser Steel's Eagle Mountain Mine finally ceased operations. The high school held its final graduation. Three of the Desert Center Unified School District schools closed their doors. All of the district's furniture and supplies were placed into storage at Eagle Mountain High School. The high school was converted to become the kindergarten through eighth grade Eagle Mountain School for the area's few remaining students. By 1985 there were only 4 regular education classes, six teachers and 75 students at the school. In 2008 it had 19 enrolled students and 2 teachers. The first public school was established at the old site of Desert Center which was 3 miles North of the present Desert Center in 1922. It was a one-room school. A teacher was sent out by the Superintendent of schools for the four Ragsdale children. Classes were held for three years at this school from 1922 to 1925. The first term was taught by Miss Fellows and finished by Mr. Maltby. In July 1925 Desert Center was moved to the present townsite. There was no school for the 1925-1926 year. Local students drove through Box Canyon, through Mecca, to thermal which was a 52 mile trip. This was the original dirt road to the valley before the highway 60/70 was built. They traveled to school in a Model-T Ford. In the school year 1926-1927 a building was erected to hold school once again at Desert Center. This building lasted three years. It is said that the goats were so hungry for knowledge that they chewed the outer edges of the building so that it was beyond further use. Six children attended taught by Miss Inwood. In 1929-1930 no school was needed. The Ragsdale children were the only children and they were in high school. About this same time the Metropolitan Water District started construction on the aqueduct. This brought an influx of students. School once more opened in a building near the cafe. This time it was a two- teacher school. The school site was later moved about one-half mile east of Desert Center and was located there since 1935. A third temporary building was added in 1949, making a three-teacher school. In the spring of 1952 the children moved to a new red brick four-room building that is still standing. January 1954 the new school added a fourth teacher to the staff. The enrollment climbed to 110, with students from Eagle Mountain, Eagle Mountain Water District, and Ocotillo Gardens arriving by bus, and also students from Hayfield Water District, Rock House, and Ironwood, as well as Desert Center, by private auto. The greatest distance traveled in those days was about 20 miles one-way. In those days students graduated on to high school, traveling by bus, to Coachella Valley Union High School (CVUHS). Eagle Mountain Elementary School's first opened for the 1957-1958 school year. Prior to that elementary students were bused to the Desert Center School. Some older students continued to attend Desert Center school after the opening of Eagle Mountain Elementary School. John Hall was the first principal of Eagle Mountain Elementary. His wife Louise taught Kindergarten. Eagle Mountain Elementary School closed its doors in 1983. Eagle Mountain High School was dedicated on September 10, 1962. Prior to this high school students traveled 120 miles daily to the Coachella Valley High School, in Thermal, California. It was closed as a high school in June, 1983. The founding students chose blue and gold as the school's official colors. EMHS's original crest/emblem was designed by Dan Litteral (Class of 1966.) The school's original alma mater lyrics were written by Loretta McDonald (Class of 1964.) Students from Eagle Mountain High School went on to become doctors, lawyers, airline pilots, military commissioned and non-commissioned officers, parents, teachers, professional photographers, technicians, law enforcement officers, ministers and more. The Henry J. Kaiser Middle School was built during the late 1960s. It closed its doors in 1983.

It is the largest shopping area in north and mid Wales, and the administrative centre of Wrexham County Borough. Many of its streets are pedestrianised.  Geography  The area encompassed by the inner ring road is Grosvenor Road, Powell Road, Bodhyfryd, St. Georges Crescent (The Beast Market), Smithfield Road, Eagles Meadow, Salop Road, St. Giles Way, Pen-Y-Bryn, Ruthin Road, Bradley Road and Watery Road. It is primarily urban in nature, with the exception of the town centre's largest green space at Belle-Vue Park. The area is predominately non- residential, notable exceptions being Eagles Meadow and around Parciau.  History  The town centre is Wrexham's medieval core, and as such contains most of its history. The town centre expands outwards from the hill top St. Giles Church, which itself is surrounded by a number of small medieval streets and alleyways.  Areas  Whilst the term 'Town Centre' can be used quite liberally in Wrexham, it can be split into a number of smaller distinct areas, which have their own character and purpose within the town. Some of these are officially recognised by Wrexham Council, others are more a description of distinct areas. = The High Street and St. Giles = St. Giles Church Steeple - One of the Seven Wonders of Wales This is Wrexham's original town centre, beginning at the church of St. Giles. This area was once the traditional High Street of the town containing most of its traditional shops and markets. It is now home to most of Wrexham's night-life including clubs, bars and restaurants. During the day the main attractions are the area's cafes and the historic 'Butchers Market' hall situated on High Street. The church of St. Giles is one of the Seven Wonders of Wales and often noted as the finest example of Gothic architecture in Wales. It is also home to the tomb of Elihu Yale. = Eagles Meadow = Eagle's Meadow is an open-air shopping centre in the south-east of the town centre. Opened in 2008, the complex is situated between Yorke Street and the inner ring road at Smithfield. The area incorporates a number of new buildings and public spaces, and includes a bridge to Yorke Street and an entrance in the style of the 'Spanish Steps' in Rome. Eagle's Meadow holds many top highstreet chain stores over two levels, alongside an 8-screen cinema and 24-lane 10 pin bowling alley. It occupies the site of a former car-park and Asda superstore. = Civic Centre = Formerly known as the Civic Centre this quarter of the town centre can be thought of as everything north of Holt and Lampbit Street and east of Rhosddu Road.

It is now a shopping area, developed in the late 1990s. The old oast houses used in the Brewery are now converted into apartments aside the River Gwenfro, which cuts through the shopping area. During re-development the railway station was moved 500 yards west, and the station now sits inside the shopping area. Trains run from Wrexham Central to local suburban stations, Deeside, the Wirral and Wrexham General for connections onto inter-city services. = Main Shopping Area = The main arteries of the town centre link all previous areas. Running in an easterly direction from Grosvenor Road, Regent Street and Hope Street are the main shopping streets within the town, terminating at the base of St. Giles' Church on High Street. Leading off these streets are a number of other streets, including Queen Street. The majority of this area is pedestrianised, and contains a number of notable landmarks including the thatched 'Horse & Jockey' pub and mock Tudor architecture at Hope St/Queen St. = Queens Square = The square is the focal point in the town centre. It plays host to daily events, Christmas celebrations and weekly markets. The square merges with Llwyn Isaf. = Parciau (Including Pen-y-Bryn) = Parciau is the name given to the southernmost area of the town centre. Much of the area is covered by Belle Vue Park, Wrexham, a substantial Victorian park built to commemorate the Jubilee of Wrexham's charter. The park is known for its bowl, which holds many summer musical events. Bridge Street, Pen-y-Bryn and Ruthin road all come under the Parciau area.

She is the oldest sailing 'fiver' in Denmark. Construction Hull drawing of Sebbe Als. A sailing trip with the Imme Gram and the then newly found Skuldelev wrecks became the inspiration for the creation of Sebbe Als. She was built by a group of local volunteers, a large group of which were the local Scouts of Augustenborg, and was launched in 1969. The drawings were the first crude drawings, coming from the Skuldelev archaeological dig. The archaeologists were very keen on having an accurate replica, as the finished ship would provide invaluable information about the Viking ships in general. She was built with copies of the original tools, mainly adzes, manufactured by the local blacksmith after Viking age finds. There was not a local shipyard with sufficient room, so she was built in a loaned building, in the then-existing Augustenborg Lumber Yard. Here she was also stored for the winter. When the lumber yard was closed, and a new yacht harbour built in its place, a naust (a traditional Norwegian boathouse) was built about half a nautical mile from the harbour, on the south coast of the firth. Every winter Sebbe Als is pulled into the naust for storage and maintenance. This is quite a task, as everything is done by hand. She can be hauled up by 20-25 people, but more are better. Sebbe is square-rigged, meaning that she has a big, roughly square sail hung under a yard. A square sail is the simplest way of creating a large sail area on a relatively low mast. During unfavourable winds, or manoeuvering in harbour or other confined spaces, she has propulsion in the form of oars. Ownership The Naust of Sebbe Als. Sebbe Als is owned by \\"Vikingeskibslaget Sebbe Als\\" (\\"The Sebbe Als Viking Ship Guild\\"), which is a self-owned association. The members are distributed all over Denmark as well as in neighboring countries and in the United States. It is not unusual for members from Aalborg, Copenhagen or Odense to arrive for a sailing trip, or to do some maintenance, and the American members, with links to Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, make it to the annual launching and for sailing whenever possible. Most of the maintenance and repair work is done in 'work weekends' during the winter. The Guild also owns a smaller Viking ship - or, correctly, a Fareoe boat - the Ottar Als, that is used for training, or simply for pleasure. A small GRP boat with an outboard engine, Fie Als, is used as safety- and tugboat on longer trips, or trips with an unskilled crew. Fie is generally not used as pleasure craft. The awareness of the environmental impact is rather high in the Guild. The Guild is currently accepting new members. No previous maritime training is needed, only willingness to learn. Experiments The wreck of Skuldelev no. 5 was so well preserved, that wear marks from the original rig could be found. Sebbes mast and rig was reconstructed from these marks, but it was still necessary to experiment to clarify many of the details. As a result, Sebbe now has a 45 m¬≤ square sail with only the top yard, and the steering oar has an angle of approx. 25¬∞ instead of the vertical position originally planned. Following the experiments, the shipbuilders of the Viking age have earned much respect. Sebbe Als is not very good at tacking, at the best of times she goes only 45 degrees to the wind, but the speed is impressive, as she is approximately twice as fast as the original calculations indicated. She can easily run on a half wind. A motivated crew can row her to about , and it is faster to row her straight against the wind than tacking. Sailing her at high speed has a definite 'fighter plane' feel. Many of the experiences gained from the use of Sebbe Als has proved useful in the construction and handling of other replicas, including Havhingsten fra Glendalough (\\"Sea Stallion from Glendalough\\"). The type of ship is so unusual nowadays, that the Danish Maritime Authority - with great respect for the ship - has set special rules for crew and equipment. As an example, despite the low tonnage of the ship, the ship's master must at least hold a license as Yacht Master 3rd. class, and the ship must have a crew of at least 11. The rules are revised every few years. Use Every year Sebbe Als undertakes a summer cruise, usually of 1 ‚Äì 3 weeks duration, and has traveled along most of the Danish and north German coasts. Smaller sailing trips happen in accordance with the choice of the Guild's members, whenever a crew with skipper can be assembled. When the weather allows, every Thursday at 1700 a training trip starts from Augustenborg dam: if there are 3 to 10 people, Ottar is used, if 11 or more, Sebbe. Very often the ship is used for a quiet evening trip, for the purpose of a small picnic and a good time with other Guild members. On these trips, usually the ship is anchored in front of Augustenborg Castle. Now and again it has happened that these trips have occurred simultaneously with a musical performance at the Castle, for example, by Eric Clapton or Roger Waters. The longest sailing trip went from Hedeby (Haithabu - a trading city from the Viking age) in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany to Kaupang (another Viking age trading city) in the Oslo Firth, Norway. The trip was made in order to put an old Viking saga to the test. A Viking skipper claimed to have made the trip in just 5 days and 5 nights (120 hours). In the summer of 1972 Sebbe Als and her crew did the trip in 114 hours, and proved the veracity of the old saga. The longest travel went to United States - she participated in the bicentennial celebrations in 1976, mainly sailing on the Hudson River at New York City as a guest of the Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, the folk singer Pete Seeger and the Clearwater organization. The event could be seen as cheating - Sebbe did not cross the Atlantic under sail, but as deck cargo on a modern ship. The crew traveled by air. She and her crew are often used as actors in film or TV productions about the Viking age.

He lived in central Texas. History Atlee B. Ayres was born in Hillsboro, Ohio, on July 12, 1873, the son of Nathan Tandy and Mary Parsons Ayres. The family moved to Texas, lived in Houston, and then moved to San Antonio in 1888, where Ayres' father managed the Alamo Flats luxury apartment hotel for many years. In 1890, Ayres went to New York to study at the Metropolitan School of Architecture, a subsidiary of Columbia University. There, he won first prize in the school's annual design competition. His teachers included William Ware, a student of Richard Morris Hunt. Ayres took drawing lessons at the Art Students League at night and studied painting under the noted teacher and artist Frank Vincent DuMond. Upon his graduation in 1894, he returned to San Antonio and worked for various architects. He subsequently moved to Mexico, where he practiced until 1900. That year he moved back to San Antonio and began a partnership with Charles A. Coughlin that lasted until Coughlin's death in 1905. One of their projects was the three-story home of Ethel Draught, at 1215 N. St. Mary's St, now part of the campus of Providence Catholic School. Early in his solo career in San Antonio, Ayres designed a hotel (1907) later known as the Heimann Building, and now occupied by Avance, a non-profit serving children and families in need. He also made the plans for the still-surviving Halff house (1908), and for a villa for Col. George Washington Brackenridge that was later torn down. He also designed the David J. and May Bock Woodward House, which currently functions as a club house for the Woman's Club of San Antonio and was placed on the National Register of Historic Places listings in Bexar County, Texas on February 16, 1996. Ayres drew the plans of Courthouses for Cameron County in Brownsville, 1912; for Jim Wells County Alice, begun 1912; for Kleberg County in Kingsville, 1914; and for Refugio County in Refugio, completed 1917. He also oversaw adding a third floor and extensive reconstruction of the original 1887 Val Verde County Courthouse at Del Rio in 1915. From 1914 to 1917, Ayres served as the State Architect of Texas. In 1924, he created a new partnership with his son Robert M. Ayres. Many of the firm's works were designed in the Spanish Colonial Revival style architecture, which was massively popular throughout San Antonio and the surrounding area. They include the Hogg house (1924), the Mannen house (1926), the Newton house (1927), and the Atkinson house (1928), which is now known as the Marion Koogler McNay Art Museum,. The firm was also adept in using other revival modes, including the English Tudor of the Jesse Oppenheimer residence (1924) and the Colonial Revival of the H. Lutcher Brown residence (1936). Other commissions include the Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impaired, the Texas State Office Building, the Carothers Dormitory (1937) and the original Pharmacy Building, among others on the campus at the University of Texas at Austin. He was active with other public, commercial buildings, and residences in South Texas towns, such as the 1920 Uvalde home of then-Congressman John Nance Garner,http://www.friendsofjohngarnermuseum.org/museumhistory.html and the 12-story addition to the Hamilton Hotel in Laredo in 1923. He designed the Seguin High School in 1914 (now the Mary B. Erskine School), the Starcke Furniture Co. building (1912), the Aumont Hotel (1916), Langner Hall at Texas Lutheran University, as well as the Blumberg and Breustedt mansions in Seguin. In San Marcos he designed a home for banker Lloyd Johnson in 1919. In Gonzales, his homes include the Booth House, now a bed & breakfast, and other fine homes. He designed San Antonio's Plaza Hotel (1927), its Federal Reserve Bank Building (1928), and, with his son Robert, its first skyscraper, the thirty-story Smith-Young Tower (1929), \\"still one of the city's most commanding works\\". His firm helped design the exterior of the San Antonio Municipal Auditorium (1923) and the Administration Building at Randolph Air Force Base (1931), often affectionately referred to as the \\"Taj Mahal,\\" and remodeled the historic Menger Hotel (1949‚Äì53). Professional life Ayres was the author of Mexican Architecture: Domestic, Civil & Ecclesiastical, published by William Helburn, Inc., of New York in 1926. He was a charter member of the Texas Society of Architects, and he was one of a group of architects instrumental in securing passage of state legislation in 1937 for the licensing of architects to practice. Atlee B. Ayers was first architect from San Antonio to be honored as a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects, in 1931. Personal life He married Olive Moss Cox in San Antonio in 1896, and the couple had two sons, Atlee Jr and Robert. After his wife's death in 1937, he married Katherine Cox in 1940. Ayres was still practicing architecture when he died at the age of ninety-six on November 6, 1969, in San Antonio. He was buried in Mission Burial Park in San Antonio.

A member of the National Peasants' Party until 1932, Vasile Marin later became a prominent member of the Romanian fascist organisation, the Iron Guard. His death in the Spanish Civil War as a volunteer for the Nationalists alongside the death of fellow volunteer and Iron Guard leader, Ion Mo»õa is credited with contributing to the growth of the Iron Guard. Biography His law thesis, finished in 1932 at the University of Bucharest, was entitled \\"The Fascism\\". Marin married, with the approval of Legionary leader Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, Ana Maria Ropala in February 1933. Ropala was the daughter of a Romanian army officer and a Jewish woman who had converted to Christianity. She was a medical doctor. In December 1936 Marin, along with Ion Mo»õa, led a small force of Legionnaires into Spain during the Spanish Civil War to present a ceremonial sword to the survivors of the Siege of the Alc√°zar and announce the alliance of the Iron Guard with Nationalist Spain; they also decided to enlist. Both Mo≈£a and Marin died on January 13, 1937 during the first day of fighting at Majadahonda on the Madrid front. Their funerals in Bucharest (February 13, 1937) were an immense and widely publicised affair attended by some ministers of Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Francisco Franco's Spain, as well as representatives of Portugal, the Empire of Japan, and delegates of the Polish Patriotic Youth. A memorial monument was erected at Majadahonda, on September 13, 1970, with the support of Franco's government.

He also provides lead vocals for the bands The Gracious Few and The Hiwatts. Career Martin and drummer Scott Mercado set out to start a band in 1990. Candlebox was formed in 1991 after guitarist Peter Klett and bassist Bardi Martin joined them. They gained a Billboard 200 top 10 hit in 1993 with their self-titled debut album, released by Maverick Records. The album's success was largely due to the single \\"Far Behind,\\" a song written about two of Martin's friends who suffered heroin overdoses, including Andrew Wood of Malfunkshun and Mother Love Bone.Nussbaum, Beth R. \\"Set to Ignite: Candlebox\\" Playgirl - April 1994 (Retrieved 12-12-10) The single reached number 18 on the US Hot 100 and was a top 10 hit in both the US Modern Rock and US Mainstream Rock charts. Candlebox released two more albums in the 1990s, but following several line-up changes and diminishing commercial success, the group broke up in an apparent attempt to be released from the Maverick label. Maverick considered Martin the sole remaining member of Candlebox and demanded a fourth studio album before finally terminating his contract in 2000. As a result, he would no longer receive album sale royalties while the other band members would. As of April 2011 Kevin has started receiving his royalties for all 3 Candlebox records.\\"Candlebox Interview\\" Garage Radio Magazine - 2007 (Retrieved 12-12-10) Following Candlebox's demise, Martin became lead vocalist for the band The Hiwatts.

It is part of Commune 10 along with Villa Real, Monte Castro, Floresta, Velez Sarsfield and Villa Luro. Versalles is located on the western end of Buenos Aires; its boundaries are marked by the following streets: Nogoy√°, Irigoyen, Juan B. Justo Avenue, and the General Paz Expressway.  History  The area around Versalles was part of a vast estate owned in the 18th century by Pedro Fern√°ndez de Castro; the neighboring ward of Monte Castro was later named in his honor. His daughter, Mercedes, subdivided the estate after his death, and the lot that later became Versalles was later owned by Manuel de Sarratea, one of the founding fathers of modern-day Argentina. Versalles has a neighborhood with characteristics of English architecture, due to the large number of immigrants who settled in the neighborhood to work on the railroad. A residential neighborhood emerged when in the early 20th century the Compa√±√≠a de Tierras del Oeste (Western Lands Company) purchased the land from the last farming landowners in the area, the Rodr√≠guez Visillac and Massini families. The Buenos Aires Western Railway inaugurated a station in the area in 1911. The Western Lands Company physician, Dr. Jos√© Guerrico, had recently returned from Paris, and inspired by his travels, suggested the station and neighborhood be named after the Ch√¢teau de Versailles (Versalles, in Spanish). The Western Railway line from Once Station to Moreno remained the suburban district's primary transport link until the opening of General Paz Avenue in 1941 (upgraded to an expressway in 1997). The Once-Moreno line was curtailed in 1952 to make way for Juan B. Justo Avenue, whose western stretch along Versalles was completed in 1953. Versalles retains a suburban character as one of the least densely populated, greenest, and quietest wards in Buenos Aires. Many of its street names recall the Cald√©n, Aguaribay (Schinus), and Caranday trees that adorn its parks and sidewalks. Some of its notable institutions include the Versalles Athletic Club (1921), the Church of Our Lady of Health (1933), the Belisario Rold√°n Library (1934), and the Versalles Popular Athen√¶um (1938). The first supermarket in Buenos Aires, Supermercado Gigante S.A., was opened in Versalles in 1965.  Movie settings  Its two largest parks are the Paseo de Versalles (built over the former rail line in the 1960s) and City of Banff Park. The 1985 hit comedy, Waiting for the Hearse was filmed there and in a nearby Art Deco house on Echenaguc√≠a Street; and the restaurant featured in the Oscar-nominated Son of the Bride (2001) was filmed in the Avellino Pizzer√≠a on the corner of Nogoy√° and Gallardo.

It was launched on 18 July 2011, by Zenit-3F launcher, from Baikonur Cosmodrome to perform research on the structure and dynamics of radio sources within and beyond our galaxy. Together with some of the largest ground-based radio telescopes, this telescope formed interferometric baselines extending up to . On 11 January 2019, the spacecraft stopped responding to ground control, but its science payload was described as \\"operational\\". The mission never recovered from the January 2019 incident, and the mission was declared finished (and spacecraft operations ended) on 30 May 2019.  Overview  The Spektr-R project was funded by the Astro Space Center of Russia, and was launched into Earth orbit on 18 July 2011, with a perigee of and an apogee of , about 700 times the orbital height of the Hubble Space Telescope at its highest point and 20 times at its lowest. In comparison, the average distance from Earth to the Moon is . As of 2018, the satellite has a much more stable orbit with a perigee of and an apogee of , with its orbit no longer intersecting the Moon's orbit and being stable for possibly hundreds or even thousands of years. The main scientific goal of the mission was the study of astronomical objects with an angular resolution up to a few millionths of an arcsecond. This was accomplished by using the satellite in conjunction with ground-based observatories and interferometry techniques. Another purpose of the project was to develop an understanding of fundamental issues of astrophysics and cosmology. This included star formations, the structure of galaxies, interstellar space, black holes and dark matter. Spektr-R was one of the instruments in the RadioAstron program, an international network of observatories led by the Astro Space Center of the Lebedev Physical Institute. The telescope was intended for radio-astrophysical observations of extragalactic objects with ultra-high resolution, as well as researching of characteristics of near-Earth and interplanetary plasma. The very high angular resolving power was achieved in conjunction with a ground-based system of radio-telescopes and interferometrical methods, operating at wavelengths of 1.35‚Äì6.0, 18.0 and 92.0 cm. Once in space, the flower-like main dish was to open its 27 'petals' within 30 minutes. There was a science payload of opportunity on board, PLASMA-F, which consists of four instruments to observe solar wind and the outer magnetosphere. These instruments are the energetic particle spectrometer MEP-2, the magnetometer MMFF, the solar wind monitor BMSW, and the data collection and processing unit SSNI-2. At launch the mass of the spacecraft was . It was launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome on 18 July 2011 at 02:31 UTC by a Zenit-3F launch vehicle, which is composed of a Zenit-2M with a Fregat-SB upper stage. On 11 January 2019, the spacecraft stopped responding to ground control. It was unknown whether the issue can be fixed, or whether the spacecraft's mission will be ended.https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-46849347 With Spektr-R's status unknown and the problems hitting the Mikhailo Lomonosov satellite, the Russian space program had no operational space observatories as of 12 January 2019. This changed with the launch of the Spektr-RG satellite in July 2019. The mission was declared as finished on 30 May 2019.https://www.roscosmos.ru/26397/ The external tank of the Fregat upper stage that delivered the Spektr-R observatory into orbit exploded on May 8, 2020, generating at least 65 trackable debris in orbit around Earth.http://russianspaceweb.com/spektr_r_mission.html#sbb  History of the project  At the beginning of the 1980s, one of the USSR leading developers of scientific space probes had completed a preliminary design of revolutionary, new-generation spacecraft, 1F and 2F. The main purpose of Spektr was to develop a common platform that could be used for future deep- space missions. NPO Lavochkin hoped to use the designs of the 1F as the standard design for space telescopes. In 1982, NPO Lavochkin had completed technical blueprints for RadioAstron, a space-based radio telescope. The expectation was that the 1F and 2F spacecraft would follow the expectations of the RadioAstron mission (also known as Astron-2). Early on, many criticized the 1F platform for its questionable astrophysics missions, even when compared to the older 4V spacecraft bus. Although the attitude control system of the 1F seemed to have little issues navigating planetary probes, its accuracy was much below the standard requirements for a high-precision telescope. To add to 1F's technical issues, the spacecraft seemed to lack electrically driven fly- wheels, which critics believed would have increased its stabilization in space. The spacecraft also failed to have a moveable solar panel system, which could track the position of the Sun without requiring the entire satellite to reposition, eventually disrupting the observations process. On 1 August 1983, VPK, the Soviet Military Industrial Commission commissioned an official decision (number 274) titled, \\"On works for creation of automated interplanetary vehicles for the exploration of planets of the Solar System, the Moon and cosmic space\\". This document outlined a new impetus for the development of satellites. The new technical proposals submitted in mid-1984 included a gamma-ray telescope designated to register radio waves in the millimetre range. Both of these satellites incorporated rotating solar panels, a highly sensitive star-tracking operating system and fly wheels. By the end of the 1980s, NPO Lavochkin Designer General, Vyacheslav Kovtunenko, proposed to design all future astrophysics satellites on the current Oko-1 spacecraft model, designed originally to track incoming ballistic missiles. According to this plan, Oko-1 (a missile-watching infrared telescope) would eventually be replaced with scientific instruments where the satellite would be pointed towards space rather than Earth.  Observing techniques  Using a technique called very-long-baseline interferometry, it was anticipated that ground telescopes in Australia, Chile, China, India, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, Ukraine and the United States would jointly make observations with the RadioAstron spacecraft. A selection of telescopes operating at wavelengths across the electromagnetic spectrum The RadioAstron satellite's main 10-metre radio telescope would communicate in four different bands of radio waves with the international ground telescopes. It can also locate sources from two frequencies simultaneously. The Spektr-R was also planned to include a secondary BMSV within the Plazma-F experiment, the goal of which was to measure the directions and intensity of solar wind. In May 2011, the news agency RIA Novosti reported that the BMSV instrument would indeed be on board. It was also reported that the BMSV would carry a micrometeoroid counter made in Germany. The RadioAstron was expected to extend into a highly elliptical orbit in the Fregat state of the Zenit rocket's launch. Spektr-R's closest point (perigee) would be above the Earth's surface, with its apogee away. The operational orbit would last at least nine years, with the RadioAstron never being in the Earth's shadow for more than two hours. With its apogee as far as the orbit of the Moon, Spektr-R could be considered a deep-space mission. In fact, the gravitational pull of the Moon was expected to fluctuate the satellite's orbit in three-year cycles, with its apogee travelling between 265,000 and from Earth and its perigee between . Each orbit would take RadioAstron around eight to nine days. This drift would vastly augment the telescope's range of vision. It was estimated that the satellite would have upwards of 80% of its potential targets within view at any one point in its orbit. The first 45 days of Spektr-R's orbit were scheduled to consist of engineering commissioning, that is, the launch of the main antenna, various systems checks and communications tests. Spektr-R's tracking was to be handled by the RT-22 radio telescope in Pushchino, Russia. Flight control would be operated by ground stations in Medvezhi Ozera, near Moscow, and Ussuriysk in Russia's Far East. Other Spektr-R joint observations would be handled by ground telescopes in Arecibo, Badary, Effelsberg, Green Bank, Medicina, Noto, Svetloe, Zelenchukskaya and Westerbork. The Spektr-R project was led by the Russian Academy of Sciences's Astro Space Center of the Lebedev Physics Institute. The radio receivers on Spektr-R were to be built in India and Australia. In earlier plans, two additional receivers were to be provided by firms under contract with the European VLBI Consortium, the EVN. These additional payloads were eventually cancelled, with the project citing old age. Similar Russian materials replaced the Indian and Australian instruments.

Its principal objective, as well as a general rural rail service, was the conveyance of iron ore from the East Midlands to South Wales. It extended two pre-existing branches, the branch of the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway (OW&WR;, opened in 1855) and the Railway (opened in 1862). Both branches had their main line junction at Chipping Norton Junction, later renamed , on the OW&WR; main line. The B&CDR; opened its western section, from Bourton-on-the-Water to a junction near Cheltenham, in 1881, and its eastern section, from Chipping Norton to a junction at , near Banbury, in 1887. The company was always short of money, and the timescale of construction was correspondingly lengthy. When the extensions opened, the Great Western Railway worked the B&CDR; line and the two earlier branches as a single railway throughout. Reversal of through trains was necessary at Chipping Norton Junction until a flyover line was opened, in 1906, and from that year a through express train from to ran over the route, using the flyover. The company sold its undertaking to the GWR in 1896, receiving about a quarter of the capital it had expended on the construction. The line had difficult gradients and curvature, and much of the route was single track. Between 1951 and 1962 the passenger service was withdrawn in stages, and all of the line except a short stub at King's Sutton was closed on 1964, followed by complete closure in 1969. The Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton main line The Chipping Norton and Bourton-on-the-Water branches in 1862 Construction of the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway was authorised by Parliament on 4 August 1845. It was designed to connect the industrial areas of the West Midlands with the growing railway network, and it was to be built on the broad gauge. The Great Western Railway had friendly relations with it at first, and agreed to lease it on generous terms. That relationship deteriorated later, when the cost of construction overran considerably and there was a misunderstanding about the extent to which the GWR guarantee would cover the additional cost. While the broad gauge on the line tied the OW&WR; to alliance with the GWR, it installed mixed gauge enabling the operation of standard gauge trains, and this was seen as an obvious indicator of treachery by the GWR.Boynton, John, 2002, The Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway, Mid England Books, Kidderminster, Hemmings, William, 2004, The Banbury and Cheltenham Railway : volume 1, Wild Swan Publications, Didcot, By the time of the authorisation of the OW&WR;, William Bliss had established an exceedingly successful business manufacturing tweed cloth in Chipping Norton, and he had extensive factory premises there. As well as facilities for transporting his products away to market, his business required considerable quantities of coal to power machinery used in his works. Transport by animal power was slow and expensive, especially as the road network in the Cotswolds was poor, and Bliss was anxious to take advantage of the railway. When the OW&WR; line was designed, there were to be stations at , and . All of these were or so distant from Chipping Norton, making them unsatisfactory for Bliss's needs, although the railway line was to pass much closer to the town. A Chipping Norton branch line Chipping Norton station in 1962 William Bliss had already motivated people in Chipping Norton to clamour for a closer station, and now he started correspondence with the directors of the OW&WR;, proposing not merely a closer station, but a branch line into Chipping Norton itself. At this stage, the directors declined to promise the branch line.Russell, J H, 1977, The Banbury and Cheltenham Railway, 1887-1962, Oxford Publishing Co, Oxford, The OW&WR; line opened in 1853, and the local construction prior to the opening revived the desire of Bliss and his fellow citizens to ask for a branch line. By now the OW&WR; was in serious financial difficulty, the cost of construction of their line having seriously overrun the estimate, and agreement to any new commitment was out of the question. In August 1853 Bliss and his friends, realising that persuading the OW&WR; to build a branch was impossible, considered building the line themselves. John Fowler, the OW&WR; engineer, gave advice and encouragement, and at the end of the year an estimated cost of ¬£24,000 was arrived at, and local people were enthusiastic enough to subscribe the necessary capital. Sir Morton Peto took ¬£14,000 and was the contractor for the construction. The only difficulty in proceeding in Parliament was a last attempt by the GWR to insist on the broad gauge being adopted. This demand was lost and on 31 July 1854 the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway (Chipping Norton Branch) Act was passed; it would be a narrow (standard) gauge line, sponsored by the OW&WR; company.Clinker, C R, Letter in the Railway Magazine, October 1955 Construction of the short line (4¬Ω miles) did not take long, and it was opened to goods traffic on 1 June 1855. Colonel Yolland of the Board of Trade inspected the line for passenger operation on 26 July, and approved it. Accordingly, on 10 August 1855 the line opened for passenger traffic.Hemmings; Christiansen says 30 August 1855. A new station on the main line, , was opened for the branch train connections. At first there were three passenger (probably mixed) trains each way daily, but by the following year this had been enhanced to six. The first and last trains of the day then ran through to to connect with main line trains that did not call at the junction station.Gilks, J Spencer, The Banbury & Cheltenham Direct Railway, in the Railway Magazine August 1955 Hemmings says that \\"from the beginning it is almost certain that the line was worked by one of the two small 0-4-2ST locomotives built by E B Wilson & Co for the OW&WR; in 1853/5.\\" Construction of the line had actually cost ¬£23,232; at the end of 1859 the OW&WR; purchased the line, guaranteeing 4% to shareholders on their capital. Amalgamation of the OW&WR; In 1860 discussions between the OW&WR; and its allies regarding amalgamation came to fruition. The Worcester and Hereford Railway, which was in financial difficulty, would be purchased, and the OW&WR; and the Newport, Abergavenny and Hereford Railway would amalgamate, the combined company being named the West Midland Railway. This was confirmed by Act of June 1860. The separate existence of the West Midland Railway lasted three years; in 1863 the WMR amalgamated with the GWR. Bourton-on-the- Water The comparative ease with which the Chipping Norton Railway scheme took shape appears to have encouraged thoughts of constructing a similar branch line to Bourton-on-the-Water, located just over westward from Chipping Norton Junction. The OW&WR; was friendly to this proposal, and voted ¬£3,500 towards the subscription list of the provisional Bourton-on-the-Water Railway Company.Subscription by the OW&WR; of ¬£3,000 only was authorised in the Act. It was submitted to Parliament in the 1860 session and obtained its authorising act on 14 June 1860. Capital of the new company was ¬£30,000. Land acquisition proved to be exceptionally difficult, with many landowners holding out for unreasonable remuneration, but otherwise the construction, undertaken by Sir Morton Peto, was straightforward. Captain J. H. Rich of the Board of Trade inspected the line for the necessary approval for passenger operation on 14 February 1862 and was satisfied. Extension to Cheltenham was evidently already under consideration, for Rich received an assurance that turntables would be erected at the projected terminus of the line, Cheltenham, or at Bourton-on-the-Water \\"in case it shall remain as the Terminal station of the branch\\". Passenger operation commenced on 1 March 1862, with goods traffic starting a few days later. There were four round trips daily, most trains operating as mixed.Chistiansen, Rex, 1973, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: volume 7: the West Midlands, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, Proposed extension to Cheltenham The Bourton-on-the-Water company now submitted to Parliament proposals to extend their line to Cheltenham. On 25 July 1864 this scheme was authorised, although only as far as , from where the East Gloucestershire Railway was to build into Cheltenham, the Bourton company receiving running powers over that line. The East Gloucestershire company started construction but the failure of the banking firm of Overend, Gurney and Company in 1866 brought the financing of all railway schemes to an end for a while as money became impossible to get. The authorising act for the Bourton company's extension included a ¬£50 daily penalty for failure to complete the line, and inability to raise finance was specifically excluded as an excuse. In haste therefore, and not without controversy, the Bourton Company applied to Parliament for abandonment of the Cheltenham extension scheme, and this was obtained on 12 August 1867. The Bourton company therefore simply operated a small branch line from the OW&WR; main line, by now part of the Great Western Railway. Transfer of the Bourton undertaking to the GWR seemed sensible, and a provisional agreement to that effect was reached in 1870, an authorising Act being obtained in 1870. Issues of liabilities due to the abandonment of the Cheltenham extension worried the GWR, and delayed the finalising of the transfer, and it was not until 1 February 1874 that the arrangement was formally effective. Banbury and Cheltenham Direct Railway proposed In 1872 proposals were formalised for what became the Banbury and Cheltenham Direct Railway. It was to run from the GWR's Oxford line at King's Sutton, and use the Chipping Norton branch and the Bourton-on-the-Water Railway as part of its route. The proposed capital was ¬£800,000; this proved to be a significant underestimate. Considerable deposits of haematite iron ore were known to exist on the line of route at the eastern end. There was a demand at the South Wales ironworks for this material, as modern smelting methods required a mixture of raw materials and the Welsh iron ore needed to have an admixture. The Banbury and Cheltenham Direct Railway received royal assent on 21 July 1873. There was to be a triangular junction at each end, King's Sutton and at Hatherley, near Cheltenham.The East Gloucestershire scheme at Andoversford was long since abandoned. At Chipping Norton Junction, later , there was to be a flyover across the main line for the benefit of through trains. An alternative proposal was considered, to make a loop entering from Chipping Norton in to the junction from the south, enabling through operation without the cost of a bridge, but this was not proceeded with. Acquisition of the necessary land proved to be exceptionally difficult, and the scale of the engineering works was greater than was originally thought: the cutting near Hook Norton was said to be one of the largest attempted in England. Extremely difficult weather conditions, failure of the contractor Alfred Terry to honour promises about the speed of completion of work, and a very considerable cost overrun beset the works. In 1876 it was apparent that completion of the line was not possible without additional finance, and an extension of the time allowable by the original act, and the company went to Parliament in 1877 seeking additional capital. A further ¬£400,000 in debenture shares was authorised by the act of 23 July 1877, with further time to complete land acquisition as well as the actual construction. Construction and opening In fact, after initial enthusiasm, the debenture share issue only had a limited takeup until much later. The Great Western Railway agreed to work the line when it opened, but presented a number of requirements for facilities which the company had not thought to provide and which they could ill afford. The Company now decided to concentrate on opening between Bourton and Cheltenham. On 28 March 1881 Colonel Rich of the Board of Trade visited the line to review its suitability for passenger operation. He noted that only at Andoversford was there an intermediate passing place on the long single line. As well as requesting a large number of detail improvements, he required additional excavation to the cutting slopes near the tunnel approaches, incurring considerable extra cost. The Banbury and Cheltenham Direct Railway in 1887 After rectification works and a further inspection, the line from Bourton to Cheltenham was opened on 1 June 1881. For the time being the south curve at Hatherley was not constructed although the GWR laid in a \\"siding\\" for the passage of locomotives in 1883. Attention now turned to completing the eastern section of the line, from Chipping Norton to King's Sutton; much of this had not received any attention whatever for the preceding five years. Work on this section too suffered from bad weather, inadequate project management by the contractor, and above all a lack of finance by the company. The section between King's Sutton and Bloxham was completed, and inspected and passed for passenger operation by the Board of Trade inspector; a change of plan quickly followed and this section was not opened until later. At the end of August 1886 Major General Hutchinson carried out an inspection of the Bloxham to Chipping Norton section; there was a new station at as the alignment of the old one was unsuitable for through operation. Although there were some detail issues requiring attention, the line was passed. A train at Chipping Norton in 1962 Nevertheless there was still a delay in opening the line, discussions with the GWR over the working arrangements apparently intervening. Eventually, on 6 April 1887 the eastern section of the line opened and the Banbury and Cheltenham Direct Railway was operational throughout. It was worked by the Great Western Railway. Nearly ¬£1.8 million had been issued as share capital. The line ran between Kings Sutton and Chipping Norton, and between Bourton-on-the-Water and Lansdown Junction at Cheltenham. Chipping Norton to Kingham and on to Bourton were GWR routes by this time. There were five passenger trains and two goods trains daily each way.Hemmings reproduces a GWR Service timetable on page 96 that tells a different story. His caption dates it at July 1877 but the line was not fully open then, and from its placing in the book it seems that 1887 is intended. There were four daily passenger trains running throughout between Banbury and Cheltenham St James (GWR); these trains reversed at Chipping Norton Junction. In addition there were six short passenger workings between Chipping Norton Junction and Chipping Norton, and one goods round trip. A note states: \\"All Local Trains between Chipping Norton and Chipping Norton Junction convey Goods Wagons and call at Sarsden Siding if required. There was also a goods train between Banbury and Hook Norton each way, and another between Chipping Norton Junction and Cheltenham. Midland and South Western Junction Railway The Midland and South Western Junction Railway was building its line connecting Southampton with Cheltenham, and on 16 March 1891 it made a connection with the Banbury and Cheltenham line at , reaching Cheltenham by running powers over the B&CDR; and at Cheltenham itself using the Midland Railway station there. About 1880 passing loops had been added at Leckhampton and Charlton Kings, between Andoversford and Cheltenham, but the additional traffic from the M&SWJR; began to overload the single line's capacity. In 1901 double line was provided (by the GWR) over this section. Sale to the GWR Starting in 1894 the B&CDR; had put forward proposals for the Great Western Railway for the GWR to absorb the company. This was an obvious step, but the GWR was not to be rushed, but agreement was reached on 13 August 1896. An authorising Act of Parliament was required, and this was obtained on 6 August 1897. The effective date was 1 July 1897. The GWR paid ¬£450,000, being 25% of the issued capital of the B&CDR.; Ordinary shareholders received ¬£2 per cent.MacDermot says, on page 338 of volume II, that the western section from Bourton-on-the- Water to Cheltenham was purchased for ¬£138,000 cash; he does not mention the eastern section.MacDermot, E T, 1931, History of the Great Western Railway: volume II: 1863 - 1921, published by the Great Western Railway, London Line improvements Iron ore deposits had been found on the course of the eastern part of the line, and a number of siding connections had been made to accommodate the traffic; in addition flows from Northamptonshire to South Wales had been running for some time by the end of the nineteenth century. This potential was increased in 1900 when the Great Central Railway reached Banbury, with the possibility of running traffic from the north and east over the B&CD; line. This moved the GWR to revive the flyover proposal at Chipping Norton Junction to enable through operation without reversal, and to double parts of the eastern section of the route. In addition the south curve at Hatherley (the \\"Gloucester Loop\\"), and at Kings Sutton, which would enable direct running from and towards Chipping Norton was revived, although this latter idea was never implemented. The flyover at Chipping Norton Junction was opened for goods traffic on 8 January 1906, and from 1 May 1906 a through express train from to ran, using the new line. The train also used the Hatherley curve. The B&CDR; company had originally suggested that their station should be known as Cheltenham South, an idea that was viewed with disfavour all round.Russell says that later the name was changed to Cheltenham South and Leckhampton, for the sole purpose of allowing the Welsh Express (the Barry to Newcastle train) to pick up and set down at a Cheltenham station. Numerous improvements to existing crossing loops were implemented at the same time, as well as doubling the line at Adderbury. Three new halts were opened at this time as well: at Churchill, named , and at and . On 1 May 1909 the now anomalous title of Chipping Norton Junction station was changed to Kingham. After 1918 After the end of World War I there began a process of considerable social change. Motor omnibuses and lorries began to compete with rural railways, and as roads improved they offered ever better services compared to the railways. At the same time, traditional industries transformed, and international competition reduced the demand for iron ore from the more expensive mining locations served by the line. Most of the railways of Great Britain were restructured in 1923 following the Railways Act 1921, and were nationalised in 1948. In the period following World War II the local passenger business declined more steeply than ever, and the iron ore traffic which had been the mainstay of the freight business also dropped away. The King's Sutton to Chipping Norton local passenger service was withdrawn in 1951, and in 1961 the Kingham to Cheltenham service was also closed. This was followed by closure of the Kingham to Chipping Norton trains in 1962, as well as the Kingham to Hook Norton freight service. Hook Norton to Adderbury closed in 1963.

The tool takes the form of a 3x3 matrix with descriptive text in each of its cells. One dimension of the matrix is composed of a qualitative input-output model that examines environmental concerns related to the product's materials use, energy use, and toxicity. The other dimension looks at the life cycle of the product through its production, use, and disposal phase. The text in each cell corresponds to the intersection of two particular aspects. For example, this means that by looking at certain cells, one can examine aspects such as energy use during the production phase, or levels of toxicity that may be a concern during the disposal phase.Ren√© van Berkel, Esther Willems, and Marije Lafleur (1997) \\"Development of an industrial ecology toolbox for the introduction of industrial ecology in enterprises - I\\" Journal of Cleaner Production 1997, 5:1-2, pp 11-25.

With approximately 40,000 members,World Council of Churches: Kiribati Uniting Church, oikoumene.org, accessed 2015-10-07. and 136 congregations, the KUC is the second-largest religious group in Kiribati and accounts for approximately 31 percent of the population of the country. Protestant missionaries (e.g., Hiram Bingham) sent by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions first arrived in Kiribati in 1857, and missionaries from the London Missionary Society arrived in 1870. The Protestant converts were served by pastors from Hawaii, Samoa and Tuvalu until the early 20th century, after which Tuvaluans and I-Kiribati, trained at Rongorongo, on Beru Atoll, took on this role. In 1968, the first general assembly of the Gilbert Islands Protestant Church met to organise an autonomous church. In 1979, when the Gilbert Islands was renamed Kiribati, the church changed its name to the Kiribati Protestant Church. The church was originally established as a Congregationalist denomination. In 2014, after a Church Bi-annual Assembly (Maungatabu), which was held on the island of Arorae, the Kiribati Protestant Church changed its name to Kiribati Uniting Church. The word \\"uniting\\" reflects that the church is now a union of several Protestant denominations in Kiribati, including Congregationalists, Evangelicals, Anglicans, and Presbyterians. KUC has 209 pastors. The majority of church members are fisherman or copra cutters. Membership is increasing and churches in villages are expanding. The KUC is a member of the World Council of Churches, the World Communion of Reformed Churches, and the Council for World Mission. The pastors for the KUC are trained at Tangintebu Theological College, which is owned by the church.

A keyboard player for the 1960s psychedelic rock group Strawberry Alarm Clock, Weitz was the principal composing member of the band.  Early life and The Strawberry Alarm Clock  Weitz was born Mark Stephen Weitz in Brooklyn, New York, in 1945 and at 6 months old moved to California. He took up playing piano and organ at age 8 and at age 20 joined a rock group called Thee Sixpence as one of the singers and the organist. Three or four years older than everyone else, he had more definite musical ideas than his bandmates, as well as a more mature and professional outlook on music, which served them well the next four years. He also found something of a kindred musical spirit in Ed King, the band's lead guitarist. Weitz was an able composer, and for the group's 1967 single on the all American label he submitted three songs: \\"The Birdman of Alkatrash\\", \\"Heart full of Rain\\", and \\"Incense and Peppermints\\" (a collaboration with Ed King). The latter, turned over to another composer by the record's producer to write the lyrics, became a #1 national hit for the group, newly christened Strawberry Alarm Clock. For the next three years, Weitz rode a whirlwind of dizzying success and frustrating attempts at a follow-up, though he did prove the single wasn't a fluke and wasn't to the credit of the lyricist by creating a top 30 hit called \\"Tomorrow\\" (Lyrics written by Weitz and music by Weitz and King). Weitz played some memorable keyboard parts on their first three albums, and on S.A.C.'s album Good Morning Starshine he showed himself in collaboration with King to be an able first-time producer.  Later life, Strawberry Alarm Clock, Billy Corgan  Weitz played keyboards for Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan's side project Spirits in the Sky, which toured for several weeks in 2009. Weitz first played with the band at a memorial concert for Sky Saxon, the late singer for the Seeds.

The facility is now known as the Glenwood Resource Center.  Origins  The IIFMC originated in 1866 when Glenwood was selected as the location of a new state- funded Civil War Orphan's Home following the donation of by community residents. One of the most notable residents of the Orphan's Home at Glenwood was future baseball player and evangelist Billy Sunday. The state orphanage at Glenwood closed in early 1876. In March 1876 the Iowa legislature designated the grounds of the former Glenwood Orphan's Home as the location for the first Iowa Asylum for Feeble-Minded Children. Canadian immigrant Dr. O.W. Archibald was appointed the first medical superintendent and the facility opened on September 1. Archibald's 1877 Annual Report listed 85 children and already crowded conditions. It then became the Iowa Institution for Feeble-Minded Children, and Dr. J.A. Donelan was hired in 1879 as the first \\"consulting physician.\\" In 1882 Archibald was replaced as medical superintendent by Dr. Francis Marion Powell. At the time of his appointment the IIFMC consisted of the buildings of the Orphan's Home, a farm, and an additional . In 1884 the Old Administration Building was constructed based on several principles of the \\"building as cure\\" Kirkbride Plan. Also, age restrictions were abolished with the creation of a new Custodial Division and by 1886 the institution was home to 259 people. Additional buildings were constructed as the grounds expanded and the resident population grew to 815 people by 1899.  20th century  In 1902 the Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy Railroad relocated and double-tracked the rail line through Glenwood, cutting across the grounds of the IIFMC. The next year a tornado struck the facility, killing two children and damaging several buildings. Powell resigned in 1903 and was replaced by his former chief assistant and English immigrant Dr. George Mogridge. The IIFMC would expand to over during Mogride's 31 years as superintendent as it became its own self-contained community isolated from the rest of Glenwood by a wrought iron fence. By 1908 the resident population numbered 1,100 people overseen by a staff of 175. During the 1930s the IIFMC was described by the WPA Southwestern Iowa Guide as a \\"group of modern structures, beautifully landscaped grounds, farm tracts, orchards, and gardens, all tended by those admitted to the institution\\". The Guide listed a staff of 20 teachers and 1,814 patients, including 623 children. Mogridge retired in 1935 and was replaced by Dr. Harold Dye the next year. In 1939 Dye would help conduct a landmark psychological experiment using residents of the IIFMC and was also replaced as superintendent at Glenwood by Dr. Thomas Lacey. Dr. Lacey had been serving as the assistant superintendent since 1911, and the facility's name was changed to the Glenwood State-Hospital School. Following Dr. Lacey's death in 1944, Dr. V.J. Meyer was named superintendent. By 1952 the facility covered , including of gardens, of orchards, and pasture for the 223 dairy cattle. The resident population was 1,968 people with 310 employees. Following Meyer's retirement Alfred Sasser was appointed superintendent. Sasser arrived in 1957 and soon changed the facility forever. In September 1957 the new superintendent hosted \\"State School Day\\" and opened the campus to the public during the dedication of the Meyer School Building. Controversy soon developed after it was revealed in the November 17, 1957 Des Moines Register that resident Mayo Buckner with a 120 I.Q. had spent 59 years confined to the facility. Further attention was placed on Glenwood by an article on the facility in the December 1957 Time magazine and the March 1958 issue of Life magazine. The Life article included photographs of the \\"side room\\" closets where those who supposedly misbehaved were forced to remain naked while a light-bulb burned 24 hours a day. The aroused business community of Glenwood responded by revealing that Sasser had lied on his application about having attained a doctorate degree. Sasser resigned in March 1959 and the subject of his tenure at Glenwood was dramatized on television during a December 1959 episode of the Armstrong Circle Theatre. Dr. Peter Peffer served as superintendent at the Glenwood State-Hospital School from 1959 until 1961. Dr. J. Cromwell served as acting superintendent until 1964 when Dr. Leonard Lavis was appointed who in turn resigned in 1969 and was replaced by Dr. William Campbell. Under Campbell, traditional ward-style housing was replaced by individual cottages and the Glenwood State-Hospital School lost much of its institutional character. Staffing was also greatly expanded during the 1970s and Local 29991 of AFSCME was organized. Early this century the facility was renamed the Glenwood Resource Center. The resident population numbered almost 400 people with close to 850 employees.

Integrated Justice Information Sharing generally refers to the ability to access and share critical information at key decision points throughout the justice enterprise . Integration also includes sharing information with traditionally non-justice agencies (for example other governmental agencies, health and human services organizations, treatment service providers, schools and educational institutions, licensing authorities, etc.) and with the public, which is increasingly demanding greater and more varied access to an expanding array of government information and services. Moreover, this information sharing and access extends across agencies and branches of government at the local level (that is, horizontal integration), as well as interested parties in other local, State and Federal jurisdictions (that is, vertical integration), and may well include civil information, such as non- support orders, civil orders of protection, etc. Building integrated justice information systems does not mean that all information between agencies is shared, without regard to the event, the agencies involved or the sensitivity of the information available. Rather, agencies need to share critical information at key decision points throughout the justice process. There is explicit recognition that this sharing of information can be accomplished by any of a variety of technical solutions, or a combination of technical solutions, including data warehouses, service-oriented architecture (SOA), consolidated information systems, middleware applications, standards-based data sharing, etc. Integrated justice does not presume any particular technological solution or architectural model.

He also helped organize the National Football League and well as the second American Football League. March is also credited with convincing Tim Mara to purchase an NFL franchise for New York City, which is still in existence today as the New York Giants. He wrote one of the first books on the history of the professional game: Pro Football: Its Ups and Downs in 1934.Pro Football, Its Ups and Downs Harry March, J. B. Lyon Company, Albany, NY 1934 Dr. March is known as the \\"Father of Professional Football.\\"\\"Dr. Harry March, Noted in Football\\", obituary Dr. Harry March, New York Times, June 11, 1940, p. 25 Biography =Early life= March was born in New Franklin, Ohio on December 11, 1875 and grew up in Canton. His father, Henry Clay March, was an officer in the U.S. Army and a close friend to future President William McKinley. Harry played college football at Mount Union College in 1893 and later became a reporter for the Canton Repository. When McKinley campaigned for the Presidency in 1896, March joined him as a reporter and followed his campaign. The job led Harry to Washington, D.C., where he landed a job earning $7-a-week as an assistant to drama critic Channing Pollock. When McKinley advised him that newspaper reporters were \\"lounge lizards\\", he studied medicine at George Washington University Medical School and went back to Canton to start a practice. =Pro football= While in Canton, March played in or watched hundreds of football games featuring the best professionals of the day such as Christy Mathewson, Fielding Yost, Walter Okeson, Knute Rockne and Pudge Heffelfinger. These experiences would inspire and help him to write Pro Football:It's Ups and Downs in 1934. In 1904, March was a coach for the Canton McKinley High School football team. By 1906, March was practicing medicine in Canton and was even one of the team doctors to the Canton Bulldogs of the pre-NFL \\"Ohio League\\". March would treated the players for shin splints and muscle pulls. Since he was Canton's team doctor in 1906, March was witness to the events surrounding the Canton Bulldogs‚ÄìMassillon Tigers betting scandal. He recorded his interpretation of the event in his book Pro Football: Its Ups and Downs, over a quarter-century later. However his version of the scandal has been questioned for accuracy by the Professional Football Researchers Association in 1984, with their article \\"Blondy Wallace and Biggest Football Scandal Ever\\". From 1925 to 1928 he served as Secretary of the New York Football Giants and from 1928 to 1933 he served as president of the club. In 1926 he was selected to a three-man committee to meet with the Intercollegiate Committee of Athletics in New York City. The other two members of this panel were George Halas and Peggy Parratt. A squabble with George Preston Marshall, owner of the Boston Redskins, put him out of the National Football League in 1934. March sold his interest in the Giants and helped form the second American Football League. March served as president of the new AFL for one year before resigning over differences with the management of several member teams. March's book Pro Football: Its Ups and Downs, published in 1934, stamped him as the leading historian of American professional football history for the next several decades. =Military service= March served in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War as a correspondent and in World War I as a lieutenant in the medical corps. =Death= March died in Canton on June 10, 1940, at the age of 64.

His father was from County Limerick, of a Cork family; his mother was the singer Charmian Jenkinson. They lived at Poul- na-murrish, Annamoe, County Wicklow. He was educated in Salisbury Cathedral School and Bradfield College, Reading. He studied at Trinity College, Dublin in the late 1960s, where he graduated in Arts and Music. He integrated himself into the musical life of Dublin, first with the group 'Jazz Therapy', and later with 'Supply, Demand and Curve.' He played cello, recorder and keyboards-including organ, piano and synthesizer. He married Teresa Le Jeune from Delgany, County Wicklow and they had a son, Linus. Jackson died in London of Hodgkin's lymphoma on 18 December 1985, aged 37. Music The band 'Supply, Demand & Curve' was formed in 1970 and initially consisted of Jackson, Brian Masterson‚Äîwho had played with Jackson in 'Jazz Therapy' during 1968‚Äì69‚Äîand Paddy Finney. They had a weekly gig at the Project Arts Centre and later played mainly in folk clubs in Dublin and beyond. With a line-up of Jackson, Masterson, Finney and Roger Doyle‚Äîwho had also been in 'Jazz Therapy'‚Äîthey undertook a tour of Canada in 1973. Rosemarie Taylor (keyboards and vocals) and other musicians joined them off and on over the years. They released their eponymous album in 1976 on the Mulligan label (LUN 009). It contained eleven tracks, ten of which were composed by Jackson. It had taken several years of snatched studio time to complete, and included contributions from some musicians who were no longer in the band by the time the LP was released. Other recordings on which Jackson featured include Camouflage by Sonny Condell, and Taylormaid by Rosemarie Taylor‚Äîboth released on Mulligan in 1977. He subsequently appeared as a guest musician on albums by The Chieftains, Midnight Well, Christy Moore, Terry and Gay Woods, and also reunited with Doyle who, by then, had created the music-theatre company Operating Theatre with Irish actress Olwen Fou√©r√©. Jackson was an early adopter of home-recording, buying an eight-track recorder and setting up a studio at his home in D√∫n Laoghaire, where he recorded the seminal album Hidden Ground (Tara 1980) with fiddle player Paddy Glackin, on which he arranged the music and also played all the instruments surrounding the fiddle. Compositions for television include the RT√â series Hands, Visions of Transport and To the Waters and the Wild. Jackson also involved himself in music for the theatre, most notably in the music for the W. B.

Micronutrients  Dunlop cheese from Ayrshire, Scotland. All six micronutrients richly found in ASF, vitamin A, vitamin B12, riboflavin, calcium, iron and zinc play a critical role in the growth and development of children.Murphy SP, Allen LH. (2003) Nutritional Importance of Animal Source Foods. J. Nutr. 133: 3932S-3935S.Black, MM. (2003) Micronutrient Deficiencies and Cognitive Functioning. J. Nutr. 133: 3927S-3931S. Inadequate stores of these micronutrients, either resulting from inadequate intake or poor absorption, is associated with poor growth, anemias (iron deficiency anemia and macrocytic anemia), rickets, night blindness, impaired cognitive functioning, neuromuscular deficits, diminished work capacity, psychiatric disorders and death. Some of these effects, such as impaired cognitive development from an iron deficiency, are irreversible.  Health risks  ASF foods have been shown to raise the risk of heart disease, diabetes, cancer, obesity and other preventable diseases due to the high levels of saturated fat and cholesterol.  Supplementation  Micronutrient deficiency is associated in poor early cognitive development.Black MM. (2003) Micronutrients and Cognitive Functioning. J Nutr.133: 3927S-3931S. Many individuals do not consume ASF or consume little ASF by either personal choice or necessity, as ASF may not be accessible or available to these people. Programs designed to address these micronutrient deficiencies should be targeted to infants, children, and pregnant women. To address these significant micronutrient deficiencies, some global health researchers and practitioners developed and piloted a snack program in Kenya school children.Siekmann JH, Allen LH, Bwibo NO, Demment MW, Murphy SP, Neumann CG (2003). Kenyan School Children Have Multiple Micronutrient Deficiencies, but Increased plasma vitamin B12 is the only detectable micronutrient response to meat or milk supplementation. J. Nutr. 133. 3972S-3980S. However, some communities are vegetarians for religious or cultural reasons. Efforts must be made to develop culturally appropriate interventions to address the micronutrient deficiencies in these populations, such as through food fortification.  Environmental effects  According to a 2006 United Nations initiative, the livestock industry sector emerges as one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global.\\"LEAD digital library: Livestock‚Äôs long shadow - Environmental issues and options As such, using plant-derived foods is typically considered better for the interests of the environment. Despite this, the raising of certain animals can be more environmentally sound than others. According to the Farralones Institute's report from 1976, raising rabbits, and chickens (on a well- considered approach) for food can still be quite sustainable.Farralones Institute favoring rabbits and chicken, 1976 As such, the production of meat and other produce, such as eggs, may still be considered environmentally friendly (if this is done in an industrial, high-efficiency manner). In addition, raising goats (for goat milk and meat) can also be environmentally quite friendly and has been favored by certain environmental activists, such as Mahatma Gandhi.Gandhi, who favored the environmentally friendly goat and its produce  Plant-based alternatives  Aside from preformed vitamin A, vitamin B12 and vitamin D, all vitamins found in animal source foods may also be found in plant-derived foods. Examples are tofu to replace meat (both contain protein in sufficient amounts), and certain seaweeds and vegetables as respectively kombu and kale to replace dairy foods as milk (both contain calcium in sufficient amounts). There are some nutrients which are rare to find in sufficient density in plant based foods. One example would be zinc, the exception would be pumpkin seeds that have been soaked for improved digestion. The increased fiber in these foods can also make absorption difficult. Deficiencies are very possible in these nutrients if vegetarians are not very careful and willing to eat sufficient quantities of these exceptional plant based foods. A good way to find these foods would be to search for them on one of the online, nutrient analyzing databases. An example would be nutritiondata.com. = Nutrient deficiencies = Most humans eat an omnivorous diet (comprising animal source foods and plant source foods) though some civilisations have eaten only animal foods. Although a healthy diet containing all essential macro and micronutrients may be possible by only consuming a plant based diet (with vitamin B12 obtained from supplements if no animal sourced foods are consumed), some populations are unable to consume an adequate quantity or variety of these plant based items to obtain appropriate amounts of nutrients, particularly those that are found in high concentrations in ASF.Dwyer JT. (1994) Vegetarian eating patterns: science, values, and food choices- where do we go from here? Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 59:1255S-1262S. Frequently, the most vulnerable populations to these micronutrient deficiencies are pregnant women, infants, and children in developing countries. In the 1980s the Nutrition Collaborative Research Support Program (NCRSP) found that six micronutrients were low in the mostly vegetarian diets of children in malnourished areas of Egypt, Mexico, and Kenya. These six micronutrients are vitamin A, vitamin B12, riboflavin, calcium, iron and zinc. ASF are the only food source of Vitamin B12.Stabler SP, Allen RH. (2004) Vitamin B12 Deficiency as a Worldwide Problem. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 24: 299-326. ASF also provide high biological value protein, energy, fat compared with plant food sources.

Canada maintains an embassy in Tel Aviv and Israel maintains an embassy in Ottawa.  History  Margaret Meagher, Canadian ambassador to Israel, 1959 In the 1930s, during the conflict over British restrictions on Jewish immigration prior to the establishment of Israel, Prime Minister Mackenzie King, who has been accused of latent anti- Semitism, passively accepted London's policies. In general, this was not an issue for Canadians, although some, such as the Roman Catholic Church in Quebec, expressed hostility toward Zionism and Jews, based on theological prejudices. In 1947, Canada was represented on the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine (UNSCOP). Canada was one of the 33 countries that voted in favour of the 1947 UN partition resolution, which led to the establishment of the State of Israel despite heavy pressure from the United Kingdom on the Commonwealth of Nations to abstain. Canada granted de facto recognition to Israel in December 1948, and full de jure recognition on May 11, 1949, after the Jewish state was admitted into the United Nations (UN). A week later, Avraham Harman was appointed Israel's first Consul General to Canada. In September 1953, the Canadian Embassy opened in Tel Aviv and Michael Comay became Israeli Ambassador to Canada. A Canadian ambassador to Israel was appointed in 1958. The Embassy of Israel in Canada is located at 50 O'Connor Street, in Ottawa, the Canadian capital. Israel also operates Canadian regional consulates in Montreal and Toronto.\\"Israeli Embassy targeted by vandals\\" , Lee Berthiaume. Embassy Mag. May 25, 2011. Accessed June 14, 2011 Diplomatic relations 1948-1990 Former Israeli Chief of General Staff Benny Gantz with former Canadian Chief of Defense Staff Walter Natynczyk, 2012 In May 1961, David Ben-Gurion was the first Israeli Prime Minister to make an official visit to Canada, and since then, officials from both countries have made frequent trips. Members of Parliament, Cabinet Ministers and Justices of the Supreme Court of Canada have visited, Israel demonstrating the ever strengthening relationship and cooperation. In addition, the premiers of Manitoba, Prince Edward Island, Ontario and Alberta and cabinet ministers from other provinces, have led successful commercial and cultural missions to Israel. A number of Canadian municipalities are twinning with Israeli cities. In 1957, after the Sinai Campaign, Lester Pearson, the Secretary of State for External Affairs, received the Nobel Peace Prize for successfully leading the process by which UN peace keeping troops were stationed along the border between Israel and Egypt. Canadian troops also played a central role in the United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF). This role is part of the wider Canadian commitment to efforts designed to end the Arab-Israel conflict. Later, in the late 1970s, Canada encouraged the peace negotiations between Israeli Prime Minister Begin and Egyptian President Sadat, and Begin stopped in Canada and met with Prime Minister Trudeau in 1977. In general, while diplomatic relations were cordial, they were not particularly close during this period. A number of Canadian diplomats, like their European counterparts, tended to support the Arab positions against Israel in the United Nations and other frameworks. The Canadian Arabists, such as Ambassador Michael D. Bell, sought to align policy with the Arab states in order to promote commercial interests, and to gain Arab support for Canadian candidates and positions, in the United Nations. These positions generated considerable friction with Israel, and were criticized as a departure from Canadian moral policies.  Diplomatic relations 1990-  Canada's support for Israel received strong public endorsement during the 1991 Gulf War, during which Iraqi missiles were fired into Israel. As part of the US-led coalition against Saddam Hussein, Canadian forces also were allied with Israel's. In the multilateral negotiations that took place after the 1991 Madrid Middle East Peace Conference, Canada agreed to head the multilateral working group on Palestinian refugee issues. Although a number of meetings were held and different options were discussed, no agreements were reached. In 1995, the multilateral talks reached an impasse. With the election of Stephen Harper's government in 2006 the relationship between the two countries strengthened considerably. Harper's government played a direct role in forming policy for the region, seeking to adjust the positions to be in conformity with the principles of the Conservative majority. The diplomats who promoted anti-Israel and Arabist policies lost influence. As anti-Israel political movements spread to Canada, including university campuses through events such as Israel Apartheid Week, Canadian government officials and MPs from different parties expressed opposition. In 2010, Conservative MP Tim Uppal introduced a motion in the House of Commons condemning IAW \\"for seeking to delegitimize the State of Israel by equating it with the racist South African apartheid regime.\\" NDP and Bloc Qu√©b√©cois members refused to agree to its unanimous passage. The Bloc submitted its own motion, which also criticized use of the word \\"apartheid\\" but added a clause, stating not every criticism of Israel is anti-Semitic. The result was that all parties, with the exception of some NDP members, denounced Israeli Apartheid Week.Layton hopes Israel issue disappears, John Ivison, National Post, Tuesday, March 16, 2010 On April 29, 2009, to mark the 61st anniversary of the State of Israel, PM Stephen Harper said \\"We count ourselves among Israel's closest partners. Since its founding in 1948, Canada has supported Israel and its right to live in peace and security with its neighbours. We value this relationship and look forward to continued friendship and collaboration.\\" In a magazine interview published February 12, 2010, Environment Minister Peter Kent said: \\"Prime Minister Harper has made it quite clear for some time now and has regularly stated that an attack on Israel would be considered an attack on Canada.\\" Kent: An Attack on Israel is an Attack on Canada , By: ELAD BENARI, Shalom Life, Published: February 12th 2010Attack on Israel is an attack on Canada, Kent says, Steven Chase, Globe and Mail, Feb. 16, 2010 In 2013, Vivian Bercovici from Toronto was appointed as the Canadian Ambassador to Israel, and she served until June 2016. Following the return of the Liberal Party to power under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in 2015, relations between Canada and Israel remained largely unchanged. In September 2016, Trudeau headed the Canadian delegation to the state funeral of Israeli leader Shimon Peres, and in his condolence message, stated: \\"Mr. Peres was an internationally-respected statesman and a great friend to Canada. He visited our country often, and helped build relations that remain strong to this day.\\"  Canada, Israel and the UN  Canada's activities and policies in the United Nations arena are generally a major expression of and component of its foreign policy, and the issues surrounding Israel receive disproportionate attention in the UN, due largely to the hostility of the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, which form the largest voting bloc in the international body. In 1947, Canada was represented on the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine (UNSCOP), and was among the 33 countries that voted in favour of the 1947 UN partition resolution, which led to the establishment of the State of Israel. However, in order to avoid conflict and criticism from the oil-rich Arab countries, and reflecting the advice of the Arabists among the Canadian diplomatic corps, such as Michael D Bell for many years, Canada either abstained or joined in voting against the numerous anti- Israel resolutions, in contrast to the United States, which voted with Israel. For many In the 1990s, the friction between Canada and Israel increased over this issue. This policy changed under the Harper government, which voted more on the basis of support for and identification with Israeli democracy. On many anti-Israel resolutions introduced annually in the UN, Canada began to vote with Israel, the US, and Australia, and not with the Arab and Islamic blocs. For example, in the 2011 General Assembly Canada voted against a series of one-sided and strictly political resolution promoting \\"solidarity\\" with the Palestinians. [12] In October 2010, Canada lost to Portugal in a vote for a seat at the Security Council, which has been attributed by some to the Arab and Islamic bloc's effort to punish Ottawa for not supporting anti-Israel agendas at the UN.Canada stands tall , David Warren, The Ottawa Citizen October 17, 2010PM ignores Ignatieff, defends Canadian principles in wake of UN defeat, Martin Ouellet, The Canadian Press, Published in The Globe and Mail, Thursday, Oct. 14, 2010Snubbed, The Economist, Oct 14th 2010 At a conference on combating anti-Semitism in Ottawa, November 8, 2010, Canadian PM Harper said \\"I know, by the way, because I have the bruises to show for it, that whether it is at the United Nations, or any other international forum, the easiest thing to do is simply to just get along and go along with this anti-Israeli rhetoric (...) There are, after all, a lot more votes ‚Äî a lot more ‚Äî in being anti-Israeli than in taking a stand. But, as long as I am prime minister, whether it is at the UN or the Francophonie or anywhere else, Canada will take that stand, whatever the cost. Harper says Canada will stand by Israel, by Mark Kennedy, Postmedia News. Published in the National Post Sunday, Nov. 7, 2010 In 2016, Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that in 2020, Canada would seek election to the Security Council, raising concerns that in order to get support from the 57-nation Islamic bloc (the Organization of Islamic Cooperation), Ottawa would return to policies and votes for resolutions that targeted Israel.  Canadian Complicity in the Arab Economic Boycott of Israel  In the 1970s, the issue of Canadian complicity in the Arab economic warfare against Israel became an issue, particularly as cooperation with the boycott was illegal in the U.S., and was inconsistent with Canada's declaratory role as a global peace-maker. Ontario and Manitoba adopted anti-boycott policies, leading Prime Minister Trudeau to consider federal legislation to prohibit Canadians and Canadian companies from cooperating with the Arab economic boycott of Israel. When corporate interests dealing with Arab and Muslim opposed the legislation, fearing a backlash, Trudeau allowed the legislation to die.  Trade relations  Canada exports agricultural products and raw materials to Israel, which, in turn, exports diamonds, textiles, clothing, and food products to Canada. On July 31, 1996, Canada and Israel signed a free trade agreement, called the Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement (CIFTA). It came into effect on January 1, 1997. Bilateral trade subsequently increased to $1.24 billion by 2005. In 2012, Joe Oliver, Canadian Minister of Natural Resources, and Uzi Landau, the former Israeli Minister of Energy and Water Resources, announced the creation of the Canada- Israel Energy Science and Technology Fund to spur the development of energy technologies and processes for the development of unconventional oil and gas resources. The Fund is expected to generate $20 to $40 million in collaborative research and development over a period of three years. Two Canadian R & D workshops took place in March 2013, bringing together leading Canadian and Israeli stakeholders. In September 2019, following four years of negotiations, the updated version of CIFTA entered into force, following ratification by both governments. The new agreement included Israeli access to Canada for the sales of produce and grain products, as well as wines. Israel agreed to tariff exemptions for Canadian companies in the realm of agricultural, agri-food and fisheries products. Clauses on women‚Äôs rights and gender equality in trade were also included. The volume of bilateral trade between Israel and Canada in 2018 was $1.1 billion, consisting primarily of chemical and machinery-related products, as well as medical or optical instruments. Public opinion polls The Conservative Party of Canada announced in 2018 that if elected, they would recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel following the lead of President Trump's U.S. Embassy move A 2005 Gallup Poll of Canadian views on the Arab-Israeli conflict found that 34% sympathized most with Israel, 30% sympathized most with Palestinian Arabs, and 36% said they did not have sympathy for either party or had no opinion. According to a COMPAS poll during the 2006 Lebanon War, the majority of Canadians believed Israel has a right to self-defense and Iran and Syria should not be sheltering Hezbollah, which is classified as a terrorist organization in Canada. 45% of Canadians opposed Harper's pro-Israeli stance. According to the COMPAS poll, 38 per cent of those polled believed Hezbollah started the war, and 35 per cent believe Israel started the war. According to a 2013 BBC World Service Poll, 25% of Canadians view Israel as having a positive influence.2013 World Service Poll BBC An online poll, by Canada's Sun News in 2014, indicated that 72% would support Israel in a war with Iran. In another poll conducted in 2012, 48% of Canadians supported their government favouring neither the Israelis nor the Palestinians. A poll conducted by Canada's Forum Research after the 2014 Israel‚ÄìGaza conflict, found that 26% of Canadians support Israel, while 17% support Palestinians. Despite Canadians' support for Israel, they still remain critical of Israel's policies, as 49% believed the attack on Gaza during that summer was not justified (against 30% who think it was), 42% agreed that Israel's use of force was out of proportion, and 41% disagreed that Hamas is the only one responsible for the deaths of innocent Gazans. However, a large majority of 73% believed Hamas' rocket attacks on Israel are unjustified. Controversies *In September 1997, Mossad agents were apprehended by Jordanian authorities after attempting to assassinate Khaled Mashal, a senior Hamas member. They were found to have used Canadian passports as part of the assassination attempt. Canada recalled its Ambassador to Israel in protest over the misuse of Canadian passports. *In 2008, Israeli Ambassador to Canada, Alan Baker, said he feared Canadian Muslims might impact Canada's foreign policy. He said that the Canadian Muslims might push their values onto Canadians, which \\"wouldn't gel with Canadian values of mutual respect.\\" He also criticized a Muslim member of Parliament and said that \\"Muslim activists\\" had prevented him from speaking. Bob Rae of the Liberal party called the comments inappropriate and inaccurate and Alghabra described them as \\"generalizing\\" and \\"divisive.\\" The Canadian Arab Federation accused Baker of sowing division amongst Canadians. An editorial in the Toronto Star asserted that Israeli diplomats should not \\"interfere in Canadian affairs\\". Embassy of Israel, Ottawa The Embassy of Israel in Ottawa is Israel's embassy in Canada. It is located at 50 O'Connor Street, suite 1005, in Ottawa, the Canadian capital. Israel also operates Canadian regional consulates in Montreal and Toronto. In May 2011, it was vandalized with a spray painted message which read \\"Embassy of War Crimes\\".

It is endemic to Wales where it grows at a few sites in Breconshire. It is an apomictic microspecies which reproduces asexually and so is reproductively isolated from its close relatives such as the Swedish whitebeam, S. intermedia. It probably originated as a hybrid between the rock whitebeam (S. rupicola) and the rowan (S. aucuparia). It was first discovered in 1893 by Augustin Ley, the vicar of Sellack in Herefordshire who travelled widely in Wales. It is a slender, deciduous shrub which can reach three metres in height. The leaves are 6‚Äì8 centimetres long and are fairly narrow and oval in shape being 1.8‚Äì2.2 times as long as they are broad. They are acutely pointed at the tip and base, have 7‚Äì10 (usually 8 or 9) pairs of veins and are lobed one fifth to one third of the way to the midrib. The flowers are produced in May and June and their petals are 4 millimetres long and white. The red berries are 6‚Äì8 millimetres across with a few small lenticels. It grows on carboniferous limestone cliffs near Crickhowell in the eastern Brecon Beacons. The largest population is at Craig y Cilau National Nature Reserve where, in September 2002, 730 plants were counted within the reserve with several more in surrounding areas. Smaller numbers grow further west at Cwm Cleisfer and a single plant remains at Craig y Castell. It formerly also occurred at Blaen Onneu. In 1947 the species was endangered by British Army mortar practice in and around its habitat. By raising the issue in the Commons, and inducing War Secretary Frederick Bellenger to order the Army to pull out of the area, Tudor Watkins, Labour MP for Brecon and Radnorshire is crediting with preserving the species from extinction.Jones, David. Welsh Wildlife (It's Wales series). Talybont: Y Lolfa, 2003; p. 41 The species has been affected by quarrying which has destroyed many plants and reduced the amount of available habitat. It can recolonize disused quarries but does not reach the same population density as at undisturbed sites. All the locations where the species grows, apart from Cwm Cleisfer, now have some kind of protection and a population is kept at the National Botanic Garden of Wales. Sources *Ellis, R. G.

The town hall was constructed in 1901 under Prussian rule in the Gothic Revival style and is listed in a group of heritage monuments protected by Polish law. One of the most iconic architectural elements of both the structure and the whole town is the 56-meter tall tower with a clock mechanism that has been operating uninterruptedly for 100 years. The tower and terrace are accessible to visitors since 2003. History left The neo-Gothic town hall was built in 1901, near Plac Zwyciestwa (Victory Square). The building remains the official residence of the town council. The area where the town hall now stands was originally a lake.SSI S≈Çupsk - S≈Çupskie ratusze > Historia ratusza In the second half of the 19th century, it was filled in with sand from the Northern Wood. From that time, the square's surroundings started to develop into a suburb behind the New Gate. The expansion of the city created a need for a new, bigger town hall; the previous one had been built in 1798, and after a hundred years was beginning to collapse. It was decided to build a new one; the site of the former hospital on Tuwima Street was bought, and an architectural contest was announced. On 16 and 17 May 1898, the 87 entries in the contest were introduced to the public at the primary school on Deotymy Street. The commission was led by famous architect Hugo Licht, who had won a reputation for his extraordinary design for the New Town Hall in Leipzig. After two days, it selected the Old German Gothic design by Karl Zaar. On 17 July, the first blueprints were drafted by Rudolf Vahl, who included the rosettes on the ceiling, arabesques on the stairs, and the mayor‚Äôs desk. The building as designed would have of floor area. Its cost was estimated as 300,000 marks, which substantially exceeded the town's capacity. The old town hall was sold, yielding very little profit, and eventually demolished. Local authorities passed legislation under which the site of the old hall could never be used; it remains unbuilt to this day. Meanwhile, construction went ahead quickly on the new building. It was completed on 22 September 1900, and all of the workers were served a free beer. On 5 July 1901, a solemn opening celebration took place. Notable features City Hall in Slupsk - Cabinet of President The town hall of S≈Çupsk together with a few other monuments in Poland portrays a lot of elements originating from an authentic interior decoration. With no doubts, the most precious is the mayor‚Äôs room which due to its special construction is among the rarest projects in Europe. It is surrounded by 12 walls and is decorated with original furniture and an absolutely phenomenal tapestry. In the room of the second mayor, on the other hand, there is an impressive painting on the wall by Friedrich Klein - Chevalier which portrays hunting for salmons. The piece of art has been cited to be so special that it can be given to the public for the evaluation without hesitation. The new town hall is mysterious and full of hidden places. For instance, no one knows what the hidden door in the conference room is for. As it later appeared, there is a tiny space behind the door where hardly a man can get. It has been proved that the room has an excellent acoustics. It is laughed at that the place was designed on purpose to hide spies noting the course of significant conferences. A similar puzzle constitutes a safe that could not be opened for a long time. As it was later discovered it contained a treasure ‚Äì German water-pipe system plans, and others. As a matter of fact such plans were after the war even more precious than gold. Apart from mysterious places there are also numerous hidden passages and tunnels of an unknown use. Town hall's clock Key Clock Clock Town hall's clock has been working continuously since 1901. ist constructor was a resident of Slupsk, and his name was OTTO PILA. The chimes were added to clock in 1973 (one phrase of Karol Szymanowski's IV Symphony). The load of the clockwork amounts to 36 kg and it is at most 2 seconds slow per day. In 1998 the resident of Slupsk, Jacek Sta≈Ñczyk, composed town's bugle-call. Every day at midday, the recording of the call, performed by musicians of Polish Philharmonic Sinfonia Baltica, Jerzy Lis, Jan Buczko and Mieczys≈Çaw Gach (trumpet and 2 French horns) rings out from the town hall's tower. The Key to United Europe The Key to United Europe for Slupsk it is a symbol of Polish accession to European Union. On 12 May 2004, the leaders of the youth from all over Poland, represented the Slupsk City, were given the key to Europe in the presence of the Polish First Lady, Mrs. Jolanta Kwa≈õniewska and the President of Slupsk, Mr. Maciej Kobyli≈Ñski. The key was handed over by European Commissioner, Mrs. Danuta Huebner. The celebration took place in Brussels Royal Yacht Club. Beforehand it was carried for 12 days from Slupsk to Brussels on 4 yachts under the command of Capitan Krzysztof Baranowski. The event organised by Slupsk City Council under the patronage of Mrs. Jolanta Kwa≈õniewska. Polish Eagles' exhibition The unique collection shows the process of shaping the image of the Coat of arms of Poland from the earliest times (10th century) to modern times, by well-known S≈Çupsk's artist working with metal, co-funder and a director for many years of Tadeusz Czapli≈Ñski's Puppet Theater \\"Rainbow\\".

These were due to Jonathan not waking up in time during a weekend the group had in a hotel. * A week before the final show, Yuri, who had served as host of the show for the past three years, was surprisingly fired by the producers. Apparently, Univision wasn't happy with the fact that she wouldn't be on time for the rehearsals for the final show. She has denied this and has said that she found out about the decision through an e-mail. * The same week, allegations of fixes in the results grew heavier when a television ad appeared on YouTube showing the four finalists, two weeks prior to their selection. The advertisement was part of a product campaign for PepsiCo and the producers of the show have denied providing them with any voting result.

In English, Egschiglen means \\"Beautiful Melody\\", and they are one of very few traditional Mongolian bands to have become internationally popular. From the beginning, Egschiglen set the focus of their artistic work on contemporary music. They systematically explored the sound dimensions of works by classical-modernist Mongolian composers, using traditional instruments from Mongolia and Central Asia, including the morin khuur (a violin with two strings made of horse hair), tobshuur (a lute symbolizing a swan's throat as neck), joochin (a type of hammered dulcimer), bass, percussion and singing techniques like kh√∂√∂mii throat singing. Their music is characterized by the delicacy and transparency of chamber music, but also by its deeply natural, compelling force. In Egschiglen‚Äôs performances, tunes from Shamanist or Buddhist tradition, which are common in Central Asia, impress through their diversity of expression and their intricate arrangements. The musicians also experiment with balancing acts between diverse cultures: in the course of the years, Egschiglen participated in a number of cooperation projects with musicians from various cultural areas. Furthermore, in a relaxed attitude, they present the latest finds from their adopted home, Franconia: traditional song material from the Altm√ºhl valley, arranged as a Mongolian kh√∂√∂mii / morin khuur crossover, which the band has released on their recent album Gereg.

Career Born and raised in the Atlanta suburb of Conyers, Georgia, Thomas was singing lead for his father's gospel group by the age of 9. His ability as a keyboard player led him, while still in high school, to recording sessions in the Atlanta studio. Here he came to the attention of country superstar Ronnie Milsap. Thomas moved to Nashville as Ronnie's first staff writer for Milsap's newly formed publishing company, Ronjoy Music. Shortly thereafter, Thomas signed on with Word Records and began a seven-year tenure as their staff writer and producer. During this time, Thomas produced over 16 albums for various artists earning over 20 No. 1 singles. Encouraged by this success, Thomas left Word and founded his own publishing and production company, Yellow Elephant Music, and began writing and producing music for BeBe & CeCe Winans. During their four album collaboration, the three sold over 3 million albums and had nine top 30 singles, six of which went top 10 and two of which went No. 1. As a result of this relationship, BeBe & CeCe Winans earned four Grammy awards, an additional Grammy nomination, and five Dove awards. =1990s= In 1991, Thomas crossed over into the world of mainstream pop when he partnered with longtime friend and Christian contemporary musician Amy Grant to collect their first No. 1, Top 40 hit, \\"Baby Baby.\\" At the same time, Thomas focused his music on former Miss America, soon to become global pop star and actress, Vanessa Williams. He produced five tracks on her Comfort Zone album including the No. 1 hit, \\"Save the Best for Last\\". These two No. 1 songs with Grant and Williams earned Thomas Grammy nominations for Producer of the Year, Song of the Year, and Record of the Year.

The album, Dreaming of You, on which \\"I Could Fall in Love\\" appears, has now been certified 35x platinum. That year Thomas also produced Williams' Academy Award-winning single, \\"Colors of the Wind,\\" for the multi-platinum selling motion picture soundtrack, Pocahontas.

The building, which contains a Bike Park, is the main office of the City of Leicester. It is a Grade II* listed building. History Before the town hall was built, the Guildhall acted as the meeting place of the city council. After the civic leaders decided the guildhall was too small they selected the old cattle market as the site for the new building. The foundation stone for the new building was laid on 3 August 1874. The new building was designed by Francis Hames in the Queen Anne style and was opened by the Mayor, Alderman William Barfoot, on 7 August 1876. The design, which made extensive use of Ketton stone, included a clock tower with cupola which is high. The building was extended in 1910 and again in 1924. A German bomb crashed through the town hall roof and fell through several floors to the basement without exploding on the night of 19/20 November 1940 during the Blitz. The town hall was the headquarters of the county borough of Leicester until 1974 when, following local government reform, it became the meeting place of Leicester City Council. Important works of art in the town hall include a painting by Charles James Adams depicting \\"The Ferry\\" and a painting by John Fulleylove depicting the \\"Interior of the Mosque of Omar, Jerusalem\\". Town Hall Square Leicester Town Council accepted on 29 October 1878, \\"a handsome ornamental fountain to be placed in the centre of the land fronting the Town Hall Buildings\\" which was a gift to the Borough from Sir Israel Hart, a former Mayor of Leicester. It is constructed of bronze-painted cast iron, Shap granite and Ross of Mull granite. Francis Hames, the architect of the town hall, also designed the layout of Town Hall Square and the fountain, which was unveiled by Sir Israel Hart on 24 September 1879. It is said to be based on a similar fountain Hames saw in at Porto in Portugal, although this is unlikely, as the Town Hall Square fountain is the earlier work (1879, with the Porto one being accepted in 1885). There are very strong similarities, which suggests that the Val d‚ÄôOsne foundry copied the Leicester fountain for the Porto installation. Also located in the Town Hall Square is the Second Boer War Memorial which was sculpted by Joseph Crosland McClure and unveiled by Field Marshal Lord Grenfell on 1 July 1909.

It refers to what people do with media devices, content, form, and production strategies in order to address the creative, ethical, and conceptual problems and choices that arise as they make documentary films or other similar presentations based on fact or reality. Colleges and universities offer courses and programs in documentary practice (see External Links). Traditional definitions put forth by scholars of documentary film address documentary practice in terms of formal codes, categories and conventions. These are used by filmmakers to create \\"non-fictional\\" representations of the historical world.Representing Reality: Issues and Concepts in Documentary, Bill Nichols, Indiana University Press, 1991 Subsequent definitions made by others define various approaches to documentary in terms of how they use such rhetorical strategies as voice, structure and style.Rhetoric and Representation in Nonfiction Film, Carl Platinga, Cambridge University Press, 1997 Such definitions focus on finished documentary projects and how they measure up to contemporary notions of truth and representation. However, recent cultural, technological, stylistic, and social shifts have turned attention in documentary studies to the process of documenting as such. Documentary-makers and scholars alike are showing interest in the present moment and how new media tools can be used by documentary-makers to initiate formation of new communities, conversations, and ways of being together. Such interests characterized Conceptual Art works of the 1960s and 1970s. The connective potentialities of art as a practice are currently being explored in the contemporary Relational Aesthetics movement. In these movements, the potentialities and dilemmas of aesthetic practice take precedence over traditional concerns with the finished artwork. Likewise, growing interest in documentary as a practice is opening the definition of documentary beyond considerations of finished documents, to include the act of documenting itself. This expansion of the definition of documentary work became possible when consumer-level video cameras became widely available.The Collective Camcorder in Art and Activism: 1968-2000, Jesse Drew. In Collectivism After Modernism,, B. Stimson and G. Shollette, eds., University of Minnesota Press, 2007 Some collectives of video producers used this new technology to address issues such as politics of cultural representation, the critique of daily life, the deconstruction of culture control mechanisms, and the subversion of authority. While practices of documentary-makers continue to be informed by existing documentary traditions, Conventions in documentary, and genres, they are also reshaped by emerging media environments, content, devices and uses for those devices. Emerging media, in turn, are greatly affected by their political, economic, and cultural contexts. Various emerging technologies and the situations in which they are used present documentary-makers with new challenges, opportunities, and dilemmas. This makes documentary practice dynamic and ever-evolving. Many documentary-makers seek innovative approaches to their field in response to emerging technologies and the practices they make possible. Continuous innovation in documentary practice prevents the \\"documentary idea\\"The Documentary Idea: A Critical History of English-Language Documentary Film and Video, Jack C. Ellis, Prentice Hall, 1989Doing Documentary Work, Robert Coles, Oxford University Press, 1997 from becoming stagnant or locked into any single generic form. This challenges each generation of documentary-makers and viewers to approach documentary-making as a living practice.  Emerging media  New documentary practices associated with cin√©ma v√©rit√© and Direct Cinema began to appear in the mid-1950s when technological developments made film and then video more portable, accessible and affordable. This allowed more people to engage in the practice of documenting. The 1991 video of Rodney King being subjected to police restraint is an example of the continuing power of this shift. An ordinary citizen was able to capture the police brutality with his camcorder, transforming him from a witness to an amateur documentary filmmaker. Scholars have cited the events following the widespread dissemination of the Rodney King video as one of the earliest examples of \\"participatory culture.\\"Rethinking Media Change: The Aesthetics of Transition, Henry Jenkins, MIT Press, 2003 Today's new media continue to reshape documentary practices in significant ways. Recording technologies embedded within personal portable devices such as video-equipped mobile phones and hand-held digital video and still cameras have made it possible for vast numbers of people to engage in citizen journalism and \\"documentary practices.\\" Additionally, Web 2.0 platforms such as video and photo-sharing websites and blogs now enable amateur \\"documentarians\\" to share and collaborate on content in ways never before possible. A practice that Howard Rheingold and Justin Hall have labeled p2p Journalism, now exists at the blurred boundary where traditional definitions of journalism and documentary meet and influence each other. Promises of new media technologies have raised expectations of a freer flow of ideas and content. Scholars are studying how participants in documenting practices engage in the social process of acquiring knowledge, sharing stories, and documenting events-in- the-making. Through such practices, social ties among people and groups as they arbitrate what qualifies as knowledge evolve continuously, facilitating the emergence of what Pierre L√©vy refers to as collective intelligence. By enabling more people to record and share their experiences, emerging media technologies have transformed the way people document reality and how they participate in the very events that they are documenting. Everyday life can become performative as people respond to encounters and events through documentary practices, creating records of daily life which they then share with others via the Internet. For many people, digital media-making becomes a form of documentary practice when the results are created for and shared via social-networking sites like MySpace, Flickr and Facebook. The 2006 documentary of a Beastie Boys concert, Awesome; I F***n' Shot That!, directed by Adam Yauch, is an example of how participation in documentary practices transforms the way people take part in events such as concerts. A live performance in 2004 was documented by 50 fans who were all given Hi8 cameras and told to film their experience of the concert. Their footage was later edited together with professionally shot footage. It provided contrasting points of view and established dialogue between artists and fans.Awesome I F***n' Shot That!: User-Generated Content in Documentary Film, online at http://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/mit5/papers/Porst AwesomePaper.pdf Some scholars argue that as an increasingly widespread practice, the nascent cellphone documentary genre creates more possibilities and forms of social agency; people use cell phones to document public events and network their collective responses;Smart Mobs: The Next Social Revolution, Howard Rheingold, Perseus Books, 2002 others have used their phones to mobilize crowds during public demonstrations.The Cell Phone and the Crowd: Messianic Politics in the Contemporary Philippines,, Rafael Vincente, published in Public Culture Vol. 15 No. 3, 2003. Vincente writes: \\"The crowd itself takes on a kind of communicative power, serving up channels for sending messages at a distance and bringing distances up close.\\" http://communication.ucsd.edu/people/f_rafael_cellphonerev_files.htm_  Mobile communications devices  The pursuit of \\"filmic truth\\" has been a hallmark of documentary practice since early film-makers such as the Lumiere Brothers, Robert Flaherty and Dziga Vertov created its foundations. (see External Links) Today, people use mobile devices in ways that open new possibilities for the practices of documenting‚Äîespecially those practices involved in efforts to achieve \\"filmic truth.\\" For example, in June 2006 a 93-minute remake of Pier Paolo Pasolini's documentary entitled Love Meetings (1965), in which he interviewed Italian citizens about their views on sex in postwar Italy, was shot entirely on a cell phone by :it:Marcello Mencarini and Barbara Seghezzi. Entitled New Love Meetings, the remake was filmed in MPEG4 format using a Nokia N90. It is the first feature-length movie to be shot entirely on a mobile phone. Their premise was that even though they asked their subjects the same questions that Pasolini had posed, the results of their documentary would be clearly influenced by the medium they used to capture the images. They believed that the use of a cellphone, an instrument of daily life, produced an intimacy absent in Pasolini's movie, making people more spontaneous and open, creating a dialogue more like a chat than an interview. They propose that the line between subject and observer becomes thinner through such practices, as the documentary film-makers present themselves as \\"normal people\\" using their cell phones to preserve an instant. New Love Meetings is a prime example of how a specific emerging technology, the mobile phone, is shifting documentary practice today. (see External Links) The use of the so-called \\"fourth screen\\" (the first screen being cinema, the second television, the third the computer, the fourth the mobile device) as a documentary tool has become a subject of academic study. In fall of 2007, graduate students of The New School produced an experimental five-minute metadocumentary shot with three cell phones. It explored the possibilities of mobile media devices as a medium for documentary practice by using them to restate Dziga Vertov's perspectives on filmic truth as expressed in his film: Man with a Movie Camera. ' Surveillance media Surveillance is the act of observation or monitoring, usually of places, people, and activity, and typically without the subject's knowledge. Much of contemporary surveillance involves observation from a distance with the help of electronic devices, such as telephone tapping, directional microphones, covert listening devices or \\"bugs\\", subminiature cameras, closed-circuit television, GPS (Global Positioning System) tracking, electronic tagging, motion tracking, satellites, internet and computer surveillance. Historically, surveillance has often been associated with governmental and other large organizational security practices. However, artists and activists have challenged those conventional practices. An early example is the film Empire, made by artist Andy Warhol in 1964. It consisted of an extreme long shot of the Empire State Building, held for eight hours in real time, challenging the boundaries of surveillance and watchability. More recently, scholars such as UCLA cinema professor Steve Mamber, have turned attention to the growing trend of using inexpensive, small cameras to unobtrusively record events of daily life. To examine hidden-camera video practices, in 2003 Mamber asked acquaintances if they or anyone they knew might have access to such footage, creating an online archive of the footage. Mamber described the growing practice as \\"both a widely pervasive activity and an oddly unexamined one.\\" In response, he established the UCLA Center for Hidden Camera Research, another example of how emerging technologies are shifting documentary practice. (see External Links) Another practice that has emerged from the introduction of new surveillance technologies is \\"inverse surveillance\\", also known as Sousveillance. Launched in 2004, CARPE (Capture, Archival and Retrieval of Personal Experiences)is a project conceived with the idea of recording and archiving one's whole life. Some of the technologies developed within this project have become potential new tools of documentary practice. For example, the EyeTap, developed by University of Toronto Professor Steve Mann, presents itself as an ideal device for continuous and inconspicuous recording as well as inverse surveillance. Some scholars assert that these new devices enable us to imagine a new form of citizenship (the \\"monitorial citizen\\") that hinges on documentary practices. This concept is illustrated by parents watching their small children at the community pool. They look inactive, but they are poised for action if action is required. The emphasis is not so much on information gathering as it is on keeping a watchful eye‚Äîeven while the monitorial citizen is doing something else.Changing Concepts of Democracy, Michael Schudson, http://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/papers/schudson.html Projects such as The Canary Project's photographic monitoring of global warming effects (see External Links) and the Center for Land Use Interpretation's Data Base of citizen- created documentation of land use practices exemplify the link between surveillance, emerging documentary practices and monitorial citizenship. The American Association for the Advancement of Science, in partnership with Amnesty International, presents another example of how new media are allowing surveillance and documentary practices to inform each other. This partnership uses satellite imagery to help NGOs document atrocities in isolated crisis zones such as Darfur and Zimbabwe. By purchasing images from commercial satellites that correspond to mapping coordinates, NGOs are increasingly able to provide visual evidence of refugee camps and burned villages; events and activities that would be impossible to image without the satellite technology. (see External Links)  Mapping applications  Traditionally, maps have been created to orient people. They have delineated boundaries by using static, two-dimensional symbols to represent dynamic, three-dimensional spaces that undergo continual change. Both form and content are fixed in these traditional maps, leaving out the real-time experiences of those people who live in and define the space being represented. However, the proliferation of portable media devices that can record and distribute digital images, video, audio and text, combined with the capability to reach previously unreachable audiences via the Web and through vast wireless networks, now makes it possible to transform conventional maps into living documents. New, map-based documentary practices employ maps as useful tools for interrogating the present, transforming maps from static representations into events-in-the-making. Personal narratives, experiences, and memories are being used to create maps that represent social and cultural space as well as physical space. Often, the goal in such projects is to evoke a more diverse and dynamic portrait of human experience as it is actually lived. (see External Links) For example, programs that involve community members and youth in active community mapping for social empowerment include Amigos de las Am√©ricas, Video Machete in Chicago, as well as Community Youth Mapping and Mapping Within (see External Links). There have been significant efforts to use community mapping practices to promote environmentally sound practices, including Green Mapping (see External Link) which involves locals in identifying and siting (on a map) ecology- minded (\\"green\\") businesses, spaces, and organizations. A recent California effort involves citizens in mapping forest fires and related community action plan. A variety of resources are available to support those involved in mapping, including resource lists, guidelines, and lesson plans. (see External Links) Sonic representations of place, sometimes called \\"soundmaps,\\" challenge traditional assumptions of what maps can do and offer new ways of participating in documentary practice. Soundmaps extend opportunities for defining place and expressing local culture, and they offer the added dimension of time. By enabling the integration of sound, text, still and moving images, mapping uniquely allows for more choices of representation and documentation without necessarily privileging one form above the rest. By doing so, voice is given to more ways of knowing and expressing‚Äîincluding 'remixing', for example‚Äîin a way that recognizes and affirms the diversity of experiences and representations within communities. (see External Links) The emergence of the Geoweb is another example of how changes in the ways people document geographical space is also broadening notions of documentary practice. Geoweb refers to virtual maps or \\"geobrowsers\\" such as Google Earth that allow users to search for images, texts, videos or other media content through interactive, photographic maps of the earth. All information on a geoweb is organized by geographic tags tied to a particular location on the map. Since its inception, usage of the Geoweb has been widespread and varied; including recreational, humanitarian, political and military uses. (see External Links) New mapping technologies make new documentary practices imaginable by allowing documentary producers to locate, store, share, and network images and information that capture the ever-shifting landscapes of the world, updated in real-time. On the global scale, access to new media with potential to generate new documentary practices is still confined to an economically privileged few, giving rise to the digital divide.You Call This A Democracy? (afterword), Paul Kivel, APEX, 2004, http://www.cipa- apex.org/books/you_call_this_a_democracy/ However, the first digital divide was largely due to economics and politics of broadband cable and expensive computers needed to access the internet. With the proliferation of wireless networks and mobile phones, the divide has diminished considerably, as more remote areas are easier to reach through wireless signals and mobile devices are far less expensive than computers. While there is great potential for new technologies to continue to broaden definitions of documentary practice, enabling more people to collaborate and ‚Äúdocument from within‚Äù their own communities, questions about who controls and regulates the networks and distribution methods as well as the increasingly advanced skill needed to fully participate in emerging practices will likely be a core question for some time.

The Presidency armies, like the presidencies themselves, belonged to the East India Company (EIC) until the Government of India Act 1858 (passed in the aftermath of the Indian Rebellion of 1857) transferred all three presidencies to the direct authority of the British Crown. In 1895 all three presidency armies were merged into the Indian Army. History =Origins= The Bengal Army originated with the establishment of a European Regiment in 1756.Raugh, p. 46 While the East India Company had previously maintained a small force of Dutch and Eurasian mercenaries in Bengal, this was destroyed when Calcutta was captured by the Nawab of Bengal on 30 June that year. =Under East India Company= Bengal troops in the 19th century (1840s) Bengal infantry on the line of march In 1757 the first locally recruited unit of Bengal sepoys was created in the form of the Lal Paltan battalion. It was recruited from Bengalis, Bhumihar, Bihari Rajputs and Pathan (Pashtun) soldiers that had served in the Nawab's Army from Bihar and the Awadh (Oudh) who were collectively called Purbiyas. Drilled and armed along British army lines this force served well at the Battle of Plassey in 1757 and 20 more Indian battalions were raised by 1764. In 1766 the Monghyr Mutiny, quelled by Robert Clive, affected many of the white officers of the Bengal Army. The EIC steadily expanded its Bengal Army and by 1796 the establishment was set at three battalions of European artillery, three regiments of European infantry, ten regiments of Indian cavalry and twelve regiments (each of two battalions) of Indian infantry.Mollo, pp. 13‚Äì14 In 1824 the Bengal Army underwent reorganisation, with the regular infantry being grouped into 68 single battalion regiments numbered according to their date of establishment. Nine additional infantry regiments were subsequently raised, though several existing units were disbanded between 1826 and 1843. On the eve of the First Afghan War (1839‚Äì42) the Bengal Army had achieved a dominant role in the forces of the HEIC. There were 74 battalions of Bengal regular infantry against only 52 from Madras, 26 from Bombay and 24 British (Queen's and Company). On average an inch and a half taller and a stone heavier than the southern Indian troops, the Bengal sepoy was highly regarded by a military establishment that tended to evaluate its soldiers by physical appearance. A new feature in the Bengal Army was the creation of irregular infantry and cavalry regiments during the 1840s.Mollo, pp. 51-52 Originally designated as \\"Local Infantry\\" these were permanently established units but with less formal drill and fewer British officers than the regular Bengal line regiments. The main source of recruitment continued to be high caste Brahmins and Rajputs from Bengal, Bihar and Oudh, although the eight regular cavalry regiments consisted mainly of Muslim Pathan sowars. During the 1840s and early 1850s numbers of Nepalese Gurkhas and Jatsikhs from the Punjab were however accepted in the Bengal Army. Both Gurkhas and Jatsikhs served in separate units but some of the latter were incorporated into existing Bengal infantry regiments. Another innovation introduced prior to 1845 was to designate specific regiments as \\"Volunteers\\" ‚Äì that is recruited for general service, with sepoys who had accepted a commitment for possible overseas duty. Recruits for the Bengal Army who were prepared to travel by ship if required, received a special allowance or batta. Two of these BNI regiments were serving in China in 1857 and so escaped any involvement in the great rebellion of that year. The East India Company‚Äôs Bengal Army in 1857 (Bombay and Madras had their own armies) consisted of 151,361 men of all ranks, of whom the great majority - 128,663 - were Indians. =1857= A total of 64 Bengal Army regular infantry and cavalry regiments rebelled during the Indian Rebellion of 1857, or were disbanded after their continued loyalty was considered doubtful. From 1858 onwards the actual high-caste Awadhi, Bengali and Bihari Hindu presence in the Bengal Army was reduced because of their perceived primary role as \\"mutineers\\" in the 1857 rebellion.Bickers and Tiedemann, p. 231 The new and less homogeneous Bengal Army was essentially drawn from Punjabi Muslims, Sikhs, Gurkhas, Baluchis and Pathans, although twelve of the pre-mutiny Bengal line infantry regiments continued in service with the same basis of recruitment, traditions and uniform colours as before.W.Y. Carman, pages 107‚Äì108, \\"Indian Army Uniforms\\" Morgan-Grampian Books 1969 A largely unspoken rationale was that an army of diverse origins was unlikely to unite in rebellion. =Post 1857= =End of the separate Bengal Army= In 1895 the three separate Presidency Armies began a process of unification which was not to be concluded until the Kitchener reforms of eight years later. As an initial step the Army of India was divided into four commands, each commanded by a lieutenant- general. These comprised Bengal, Bombay (including Aden), Madras (including Burma) and Punjab (including the North West Frontier). In 1903 the separately numbered regiments of the Bombay, Madras and Bengal Armies were unified in a single organisational sequence and the presidency affiliations disappeared. The Bengal infantry units in existence at the end of the Presidency era continued as the senior regiments (1st Brahmans to 48th Pioneers of the newly unified Indian Army.Carmen, pp. 225-226 The Bengal Presidency at its greatest extent in 1858 Soldiers of the 1st European Bengal Fusiliers, pre-1862 Sepoy of the 6th Bengal Light Infantry, circa 1890s. Ethnic composition The Bengal Army of the East India Company was mainly recruited from high castes living in Bengal, Bihar and the Awadh. Writing in The Indian Army (1834), Sir John Malcolm, who had a lifetime's experience of Indian soldiering, wrote: \\"They consist largely of Rajpoots (Rajput), who are a distinguished race among the Khiteree (Kshatriya), or military tribe. We may judge of the size of these men when we are told that the height below which no recruit is taken is five feet six inches. The great proportion of the Grenadiers are six feet and upwards.\\" Both prior to and following 1857, the Bengal Army included what were to become some of the most famous units in India: Skinner's Horse from Bengal, the Gurkhas from the Himalayas and the Corps of Guides on the Khyber- Pakhtunkhwa. Structure =Cavalry= Regular regiments *Governor General's Bodyguard *1st to 10th Bengal Light Cavalry Regiments (see 3rd and 5th Regiments). Eight of these regular regiments mutinied and two were disbanded during 1857‚Äì58. None were carried over into the post-Mutiny army.Mollo, p. 93 *1st to 4th Bengal European Light Cavalry Regiments. Recruited hastily in Britain in November 1857 to replace the eight regiments of Bengal Light Cavalry which had mutinied. The mention of \\"European\\" in the name indicated that it consisted of white soldiers rather than Indian sowars. In 1861, all four European regiments were transferred to the British Army as the 19th, 20th and 21st Hussars.Mollo, pp. 91‚Äì92 Irregular units *1st Irregular Cavalry (Skinner's Horse) *2nd to 18th Irregular Cavalry Regiments *Bundelkhand Legion Cavalry *Gwalior Contingent Cavalry *Kotah Contingent Cavalry *Bhopal Contingent Cavalry *United Malwa Contingent Cavalry *Ramgarh Irregular Cavalry *Nagpore Irregular Cavalry *1st to 3rd Oudh Irregular Cavalry Regiments *1st, 2nd and 3rd Regiments of Hodson's Horse *1st to 4th Sikh Irregular Cavalry Regiments *The Jat Horse Yeomanry *Rohilkhand Horse *The Muttra Horse *Alexander's Horse *Barrow's Volunteers *Behar Irregular Cavalry *Belooch Horse *Benares Horse *Bengal Yeomanry Cavalry *Calcutta Volunteer Guards *De Kantzow's Irregular Cavalry *Graham's Horse *2nd Gwalior Cavalry *2nd Gwalior Mahratta Horse *H.H.

Chandler, A history of Cambodia, Westview Press; Allen & Unwin, Boulder, Sydney, 1992 The December 2 Memorial Monument to commemorate the establishment of the Solidarity Front for the Development of the Cambodian Motherland (SFDCM). History Its foundation took place on 2 December 1978 in Krati√© Province near the border with Vietnam at a meeting of seventy dissident Cambodians determined to overthrow Pol Pot's government. Heng Samrin was voted as leader of the front and within a few weeks its influence spread widely on both sides of the border.Ben Kiernan, The Pol Pot Regime: Race, Power and Genocide in Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge, 1975-1979. Page 442 The front was a heterogeneous Cambodian politico-military organization that legitimized the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia, precipitating the ensuing defeat of the Khmer Rouge's Democratic Kampuchea. It brought about the foundation of the new state named 'People's Republic of Kampuchea' and the reconstruction of the shattered and desperately impoverished country. This organization has undergone various name changes as it has expanded and adapted to the different historical realities in Cambodia. =The Salvation Front (1978-1981)= Politically the Salvation Front (FUNSK) was a pro-Hanoi umbrella organization of the Marxist Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Party (KPRP) opposed to the Communist Party of Kampuchea ‚Äîalso known as the Angkar. The original FUNSK group was formed within Cambodia in an area around Kratie that had been liberated from the Khmer Rouge by Cambodian Communists and Khmer Rouge defectors.Michael Vickery, Cambodia 1975-1982 The latter didn't share Pol Pot's growing personality cult and his increasingly anti-Vietnamese policies. Many felt personally threatened by the bloody purges in Eastern Cambodia in 1977, especially after So Phim's murder at the hand of members of the pro-Pol Pot faction.Ben Kiernan, The Pol Pot Regime: Race, Power, and Genocide in Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge, 1975‚Äì79. New Haven: Yale University Press, , 1996 The date of the Salvation Front's foundation was December 2, 1978, in what Khmer socialist militants called a \\"Reunion Congress\\". The aim of the FUNSK was to expand as a Cambodian front in order to overthrow Pol Pot's regime of terror. The Salvation Front drew eleven points for the reconstruction of the country. These points would be used after the establishment of the PRK to motivate Cambodians to support the rebuilding efforts and the pro-Soviet structure of the new state to keep the revolution alive with a moderate, pragmatic and humane approach compared to the Khmer Rouge. Although the front was largely controlled by KPRP communists, it included quite a few non-communists in its leadership, such as Cambodian Buddhist religious figures, as well as women.Role of Buddhism in Cambodian Life The Central Committee of FUNSK at its foundation was then made up of 15 individuals with Heng Samrin as Chairman, Chea Sim as vice president, Ros Samay as secretary general. Revolutionary People's Council decreed on January 8, 1979: Heng Samrin (Chairman), Vice Chairman: Pen Sovan. Headed by Heng Samrin, Revolutionary People's Council of Kampuchea includes Hun Sen (Foreign Affairs), Keo Chenda (Culture and Information), Mot Sakun (Economy), Chea Sim (Interior), Pen Sovan (Defense), Nu Beng (Health and Social Affairs), and Chan Ven (Education). =Kampuchean United Front for National Construction and Defence (1981-2006)= In 1981, two years after the liberation of Phnom Penh, the Salvation Front was renamed \\"Kampuchean United Front for National Construction and Defence\\", Front d'union pour l'√©dification et la d√©fense de la patrie du Cambodge (KUFNCD or UFCDK). Library of Congress / Federal Research Division / Country Studies - Cambodia - Major Political and Military Organizations Years after the establishment of the People's Republic of Kampuchea, the Front remained as the main political organization of the pro- Hanoi Cambodian state. The front's role in the political life of the nation was officially established in the PRK Constitution, which stated in Article 3 that \\"The Kampuchean Front for National Construction and the revolutionary mass organizations constitute a solid support base of the state, encouraging the people to fulfill their revolutionary tasks.\\" Honorary Chairman: Heng Samrin Chairman: Chea Sim =Solidarity Front for Development of the Cambodian Motherland (2006 ‚Äì present)= On the 5th congress of the Kampuchean United Front for National Construction and Defence, held in Phnom Penh, on 29 April 2006, the name of the KUFNCD was changed to \\"Solidarity Front for Development of the Cambodian Motherland\\", Front de solidarit√© pour le d√©veloppement de la Patrie du Cambodge (SFDCM).Vietnamese News Agency - Cambodge: Le PPC veille √† la grande union nationale 29 April 2006 -- 22:04(GMT+7) This organization, so important in its heyday, has lost much of its original relevance in Cambodian present-day politics. Chairman: Heng Samrin Honorary Chairman: Chea Sim Tasks The Front's specific missions were to transmit party policies to the masses, to act as an ombudsman, and to mobilize the people around the regime's efforts to consolidate the so-called \\"worker-peasant alliance.\\" The front's cadres were required to stay in close touch with the people, to report their needs and problems to authorities, and to conduct mass campaigns to generate support for the regime, or to lead \\"emulation\\" drives to spur the population to greater efforts in pursuit of specific goals. The cadres were also responsible for organizing networks of Salvation Front activists in villages and in communes and for coordinating their functions with cadres of various mass organizations. Often this involved long indoctrination sessions and getting villagers to paint banners and hoardings related to the Salvation Front propaganda. This created some resentment in the eyes of the people who perceived that the effort could have been directed towards more productive work.Soizick Crochet, Le Cambodge, Karthala, Paris 1997, The Front also was responsible for conducting \\"activities of friendship,\\" which were aimed at improving the climate for close cooperation with \\"the Vietnamese people and the Vietnamese army and experts.\\" Another major function of the front was to reeducate Buddhist monks so that they would \\"discard the narrow-minded views of dividing themselves into groups and factions\\" and would participate more actively in the revolutionary endeavors of the Salvation Front. Presently the Solidarity Front for Development of the Cambodian Motherland (SFDCM), the Salvation Front's latest avatar, organizes national and international events, such as sports venues and trade fairs on behalf of the Cambodian government. Organizations Among the more important mass organizations affiliated with the KUFNCD as an umbrella organization were the following: *Kampuchean Federation of Trade Unions (KFTU). It had 62,000 members in December 1983 and was officially described as \\"the training school of the working class for economic and administrative management\\". *Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Youth Union (KPRYU), an important reservoir of candidate members for the KPRP and \\"a school of Marxism\\" for people between the ages of fifteen and twenty- six. As of March 1987, when the Youth Union held its Second National Congress, there were more than 50,000 members in villages, factories, enterprises, hospitals, schools, public offices, and the armed forces. *Kampuchean Revolutionary Youth Association (KRYA), an 800,000- member group for children (aged 9 to 16). *Kampuchean Young Pioneers Organization (KYPO), a 450,000-member group for preschoolers under the general guidance of the KPRYU and the KRYA, both part of the Pioneer movement. *Kampuchean Revolutionary Women's Association (KRWA), which claimed 923,000 members as of October 1983. Commemorative dates All the organizations under the KUFNCD held rallies to arouse public awareness on national commemorative occasions such as the following: *Kampuchea-Vietnam Solidarity Day on 18 February. *Day of Remembrance observed on 20 May. *Day of Solidarity between the People and the Army celebrated on 19 June.

History Baburao Painter's Maharashtra Film Company, based in Kolhapur, had made a name for itself with its silent films in early 1920s. Close friends Vishnupant G Damle and Fateh Lal (Damle Mama and Saheb Mama) were very good artists and held posts with senior responsibility at the company.Backing Prabhat Films Indian Express, Thursday, 22 July 1999. Baburao Pendharkar became the de facto head of operations because of Baburao Painter's distaste for financial matters. Pendharkar's cousin Shantaram Vanakudre (V. Shantaram) joined the company and became Baburao Painter's right-hand man. Ayodhyecha Raja (1932), the first Marathi film, was made by Prabhat Films In 1927-28, the senior personnel became dissatisfied by Baburao Painter's increasingly lukewarm and erratic behaviour. Damle and Fateh Lal were thinking of starting their own company, as were V. Shantaram and Keshav Rao Dhaibar. The four of them got together, and with Sitaram Kulkarni, well-established jeweller in Kolhapur as their fifth partner and financier, started a new company on 1 June 1929, with an initial investment amount of Rs 15,000. Baburao Pendharkar suggested the name Prabhat (meaning \\"Dawn\\"), and the other partners liked it. Prabhat soon made a name for itself with silent films and produced six films, most of them directed by the tireless V. Shantaram. When India entered the era of talkies with Alam Ara in March 1931, Shantaram predicted that it was a transient phase, and the silent films were the real artistic area. But soon the company realized its mistake, and joined the talkie era with Ayodhyecha Raja (The King of Ayodhya) in Marathi (1932), also starring Durga Khote, which was the first film of Marathi Cinema, and later made under the name Ayodhya Ka Raja in Hindi. The film is based on Raja Harishchandra's story.The Firsts of Indian Cinema: Milestones from 1896-2000 Film and Television Producers Guild of India In 1930s when most of silent movies companies had closed down, Prabhat joined the ranks of \\"big three\\" of Indian cinema, which included New Theatres of Calcutta and Bombay Talkies of Mumbai Prabhat Films Cinemas of the world: film and society from 1895 to the present, by James Chapman.

In September 1933, the company moved to Pune because of its proximity to Mumbai and all the five founder moved with their families, and the doors of the studio finally opened in Pune in 1934. Then followed a golden era of 8‚Äì10 years during which the company made some landmark films: Sairandhri (1933), India's first colour film, processed and printed in Germany; Amrit Manthan (1934), Sant Tukaram (1936), Kunku (or Duniya Na Mane in Hindi) in 1937, Manoos (or Aadmi in Hindi) (1939), Shejari (or Padosi) in 1941. The biopic, title Sant Tukaram, in 1936, made by V. Damle and S. Fattelal of Prabhat Film Company and starring Vishnupant Pagnis as the lead, and released on 12 December 1936 at Central Cinema in Mumbai. The film was not only a big hit but also had won an award at the 5th Venice International Film Festival in 1937, and still remains a part of film appreciation courses.'Sant Tukaram' film still a topic of interest Anurag Basu - Televisionpoint.com, 26 December 2007.Lost & found: A piece of classic cinema history Indian Express, 26 March 2004.Milestone 1937 Bollywood: a guidebook to popular Hindi cinema by Tejaswini Ganti.

France first established colonial rule in the Comoros in 1841. Agreement was reached with France in 1973 for the Comoros to become independent in 1978. On July 6, 1975, but the Comorian parliament passed a unilateral resolution declaring independence. The deputies of Mayotte, which remained under French control, abstained. Referendums on all four of the islands excluding Mayotte showed strong support for independence. Ahmed Abdallah proclaimed the Comoros' independence on September 5, 1975 and became its first president. In 1978, president Ali Soilih, who had a firm anti-French attitude, was killed and Ahmed Abdallah came to power. Under the reign of Abdallah, Bob Denard was commander of the Presidential Guard (PG) and de facto ruler of the country, trained, supported and funded by the white regimes in South Africa (SA) and Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) in return to the permission to set up a secret listening station on the islands. South-African agents had to keep an ear on the important African National Congress bases in Lusaka and Dar es Salaam and to watch the war in Mozambique, in which SA played an active role. The Comoros was also used for evading arms sanctions. When in 1981 Fran√ßois Mitterrand was elected president Denard lost the support of the French intelligence service, but he managed to strengthen the link between SA and the Comoros. Besides the Guard, Denard established his own company SOGECOM, in both the security and building business. He seemed to be pretty rich. In period 1985-87 the relationship of the PG with the local Comorians became worse. At the end of the 1980s the South Africans did not want to continue to support a mercenary regime and France also wanted to get rid of the mercenaries. Finally, also President Abdallah wanted the mercenaries to leave. Their response was a (third) coup and the death of President Abdallah in which Denard and his men were probably involved. The SA and the French government subsequently forced Denard and his mercenaries to leave the islands in 1989. Beginning of the Abdallah regime Following a few days of provisional government, the two men who had financed the coup, former president Ahmed Abdallah (himself the victim of the 1975 coup) and former vice president Mohamed Ahmed, returned to Moroni from exile in Paris and installed themselves as joint presidents.. Soon after, Abdallah was named sole executive. The continued presence of the mercenaries impeded Abdallah's early efforts to stabilize the Comoros. Bob Denard seemed interested in remaining in the Comoros, and he and his friends were given financially rewarding appointments with the new government. In reaction to Denard's involvement with Abdallah, the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) revoked the Comoros' OAU membership, Madagascar severed diplomatic relations, and the United Nations (UN) threatened economic sanctions against the regime. France also exerted pressure for Denard to leave, and in late September‚Äîtemporarily, as it developed‚Äîhe departed the islands. Abdallah consolidated power, beginning with the writing of a new constitution. The document combined federalism and centralism. It granted each island its own legislature and control over taxes levied on individuals and businesses resident on the island (perhaps with an eye to rapprochement with Mahor√©), while reserving strong executive powers for the president. It also restored Islam as the state religion, while acknowledging the rights of those who did not observe the Muslim faith.. The new constitution was approved by over 99% of Comoran voters in a referendum held on 1 October 1978.. Later in the month Abdallah was elected to a six-year term as president of what was now known as the Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros. Although Abdallah had been president when the Comoros broke away from France in 1975, he now moved to establish a relationship much more to France's liking. Upon Denard's departure, he gave a French military mission responsibility for training the Comoros' defense force. He also signed an agreement with France to allow its navy full use of Comoran port facilities. Making the most of the Comoros' new presidential system, Abdallah induced the nation's National Assembly to enact a twelve-year ban on political parties, a move that guaranteed his reelection in 1984. In 1979 his government arrested Soilih regime members who had not already left or been killed during the 1978 coup. Four former ministers of the Soilih government disappeared and allegedly were murdered, and about 300 other Soilih supporters were imprisoned without trial. For the next three years, occasional trials were held, in many cases only after France had insisted on due process for the prisoners. Although the restoration of good relations with France represented a sharp break with the policies of the previous regime, Abdallah built on Soilih's efforts to find new sources of diplomatic and economic support. Thanks in large part to aid from the European Community and the Arab states, the regime began to upgrade roads, telecommunications, and port facilities. The government also accepted international aid for programs to increase the cultivation of cash crops and food for domestic consumption. Abdallah endeavored to maintain the relations established by Soilih with China, Nigeria, and Tanzania, and to expand the Comoros' contacts in the Islamic world with visits to Libya and the Persian Gulf states. Despite international assistance, economic development was slow. Although some Comorans blamed the French, who had yet to restore technical assistance to pre-1975 levels, others suspected that Abdallah, who owned a large import-export firm, was enriching himself from development efforts with the assistance of Denard, who continued to visit the Comoros. Opposition to the Abdallah regime began to appear as early as 1979, with the formation of an exile-dominated group that became known as the United National Front of Comorians‚ÄìUnion of Comorians (Front National Uni des Komoriens‚ÄìUnion des Komoriens, or FNUK or Unikom). In 1980 the Comoran ambassador to France, Said Ali Kemal, resigned his position to form another opposition group, the National Committee for Public Safety (Comit√© National de Salut Public).. A failed coup in February 1981, led by a former official of the Soilih regime, resulted in arrests of about forty people.. In regard to Mahor√©, Abdallah offered little more than verbal resistance to a 1979 decision of the French government to postpone action on the status of the island until 1984. At the same time, he kept the door open to Mahor√© by writing a large measure of autonomy for the component islands of the republic into the 1978 constitution and by appointing a Mahorais as his government's minister of finance. Having established an administration that, in comparison with the Soilih years, seemed tolerable to his domestic and international constituencies, Abdallah proceeded to entrench himself through domestic and international policies that profoundly compromised the Comoros' independence. The undermining of the political process In February 1982, the Comoros became a one-party state. The government designated Abdallah's newly formed Comorian Union for Progress (Union Comorienne pour le Progr√®s, or UCP) as the republic's sole political party. Although unaffiliated individuals could run for local and national office, the only party that could organize on behalf of candidates henceforth would be the UCP. In the March 1982 elections, all but one of Abdallah's handpicked UCP candidates won. UCP candidates likewise dominated the 1983 elections and opposition candidates attempting to stand for election in balloting for the three islands' legislative councils in July were removed from the lists by the Ministry of Interior. Abdallah himself was elected to a second six-year term as head of state in September 1984, winning more than 99 percent of the vote as the sole candidate. During the National Assembly elections of 22 March 1987, the Abdallah regime arrested 400 poll watchers from opposition groups. A state radio announcement that one non-UCP delegate had been elected was retracted the next day. Abdallah also kept opponents from competing with him in the arena of legitimate politics by reshuffling his government and amending the 1978 constitution. As part of what one observer wryly called the process of \\"remov[ing] his most avid successors from temptation,\\" Abdallah pushed through a constitutional amendment in 1985 that abolished the post of prime minister, a move that made the president both head of state and head of the elected government.. The amendment also diminished the status of Ali Mroudjae, the erstwhile prime minister and a likely future candidate for president.. Another 1985 amendment took away many of the powers of the president of the National Assembly, including his right to become interim head of state in the event of the incumbent's death. The amendment transferred the right of succession to the president of the Supreme Court, an appointee of the head of state. Feeling the effect of this second amendment was assembly president Mohamed Taki Abdoulkarim, another man generally regarded as presidential timber. Mroudjae's subsequent career in the Abdallah government illustrated the way in which Abdallah used frequent reshufflings of his cabinet to eliminate potential challengers. Mroudjae's next job was to share duties as minister of state with four other people; he was removed from the government altogether in another reshuffle four months later. Looking to the end of his second (and, according to the constitution, final) term as head of state, Abdallah created a commission in 1988 to recommend changes to the constitution. These changes, among other things, would permit him to run yet again in 1990. A referendum on revisions to the constitution was scheduled for 4 November 1989. A weak, divided, and opportunistic opposition facilitated Abdallah's efforts to undermine the political process. The character of Comoran politics ensured that opposition would be sustained by an unwieldy group of strong personalities. As the personal stock of these would-be leaders rose and fell, coalitions coalesced and just as quickly fell apart in a process that engendered distrust and cynicism. The ban on opposition political organizations at home‚Äîbrutally upheld, when necessary, by the Presidential Guard (Garde Presidentelle‚ÄîGP) and the Comoran military‚Äîfurther undercut efforts to organize against the head of state. The French government's displeasure at intrigues of Comoran exiles in Paris also complicated opposition efforts. Given the absence of an ideological basis for resisting the regime, it was also not surprising that some opposition leaders were willing to ally themselves with the head of state if such a move appeared likely to advance them personally.. For example, Mouzaoir Abdallah, leader of the opposition Union for a Democratic Republic in the Comoros (Union pour une R√©publique D√©mocratique aux Comores, URDC), appeared with the president at independence day celebrations in July 1988 amid rumors that the URDC chief was being considered for a reconstituted prime minister's office.. In September 1988 another opposition leader, Said Hachim, agreed to join the commission considering revisions to the constitution. The credibility of Abdallah's opponents was also damaged by the efforts of one opposition leader, former ambassador to France Said Ali Kemal, to recruit mercenaries to help overthrow the Abdallah government. Arrested in Australia in late 1983, six of the mercenaries gave testimony discrediting Kemal. Mercenary rule Abdallah complemented his political maneuvers by employing a GP officered by many of the same mercenaries who had helped him take power in 1978. Denard led this force, and also became heavily involved in Comoran business activities, sometimes acting in partnership with President Abdallah or as a front for South African business interests, which played a growing role in the Comoran economy during the Abdallah regime. Although Denard had made a ceremonial departure from the Comoros following the 1978 coup, by the early 1980s he was again openly active in the islands. The GP, whose numbers were reported to range from 300 to 700 members, primarily indigenous Comorans, were led by about thirty French and Belgian mercenaries, mostly comrades of Denard's in the post-World War II conflicts that accompanied the decolonization of Africa and Asia. Answerable only to the president, the GP operated outside the chain of command of the French-trained 1,000-member Comoran Armed Forces, a situation that caused resentment among the regular military, Comoran citizens, and other African states. The GP's primary missions were to protect the president and to deter attempts to overthrow his government. During the July 1983 elections to the three islands' legislative councils, the GP beat and arrested demonstrators protesting the republic's one-party system. During elections to the National Assembly in March 1987, the GP‚Äîwhich had become known as les affreux, \\"the frighteners\\"‚Äîreplaced several hundred dissident poll watchers who had been arrested by the army. On March 8, 1985, one of the most serious attempts to overthrow the Abdallah government began as a mutiny by about thirty Comoran troops of the GP against their European officers.. The disaffected guards had formed ties to the Democratic Front (Front D√©mocratique, FD), one of the more nationalistic of the republic's many banned political parties.. The mutiny was quickly squelched; three of the rebellious guards were killed, and the rest were taken prisoners. President Abdallah used the uprising as an opportunity to round up dissidents, primarily FD members, whose leadership denied involvement in the coup attempt. Later in 1985, seventy-seven received convictions; seventeen, including the FD's secretary general, Mustapha Said Cheikh, were sentenced to life imprisonment at hard labor. Most of the prisoners were released in 1986 following Amnesty International charges of illegal arrests, torture, and other abuses. France had also exerted pressure by temporarily withholding new aid projects and purchases of Comoran vanilla. Perhaps the most notorious action of the GP on behalf of the Abdallah government occurred in November 1987. After an apparent attempt by dissidents to free some political prisoners, an event quickly labeled a coup attempt by the Abdallah regime, the GP arrested fourteen alleged plotters and tortured seven of them to death. Officials of the Comoran government apparently were not allowed to participate in the prisoners' interrogation. President Abdallah was on a state visit to Egypt at the time. With Abdallah's acquiescence and occasional participation, Denard and the other GP officers used their connections to the head of state to make themselves important players in the Comoran economy. Denard was a part owner of √âtablissements Abdallah et Fils, the Comoros' largest import-export firm, whose primary owner was President Abdallah. Denard also owned and operated a highly profitable commercial shuttle between South Africa and the Comoros, and owned Sogecom, a private security firm with contracts to protect South African hotels being built in the islands. The GP officers, sympathetic to South Africa's apartheid government, established themselves as a conduit of South African investment and influence in the Comoros. An official South African trade representative conceded that a number of his country's investment projects, including a 525-hectare experimental farm, housing, road construction, and a medical evacuation program, were brokered and managed by guard officers at the mercenaries' insistence.. The GP also arranged for South African commercial aircraft to fly in the Middle East and parts of Africa under the aegis of the Comoran national airline, in contravention of international sanctions against South Africa.. Furthermore, the GP provided for South African use of Comoran territory as a base for intelligence gathering in the Mozambique Channel and as a staging area for the shipment of arms to rightist rebels in Mozambique. The GP was widely understood to be funded by South Africa, at the rate of about US$3 million per year. Comoros as client state: the economics of Abdallah President Abdallah generally put his personal interests ahead of national interests in making economic policy. The result was the creation of a client state whose meager and unpredictable cash crop earnings were supplemented with increasing infusions of foreign aid. Throughout the 1980s, export earnings from the Comoros' four main cash crops‚Äîvanilla, ylang-ylang, cloves, and copra‚Äîexperienced a wrenching sequence of booms and collapses because of weather and market factors, or else steadily dwindled. The regime's principal form of response was to apply the president's considerable diplomatic skills to developing an extensive network of governments and international organizations willing to extend loans and donate aid. The main suppliers were France, South Africa, the European Community, the conservative Arab states, the World Bank and related organs, and regional financial institutions such as the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa and the African Development Bank. Some assistance went to projects of indisputable value, such as efforts to create independent news media and improve telephone communications with the outside world. Much of the aid, however, was questionable‚Äîfor example, loans and grants to help the republic meet the payroll for its oversized civil service. Other more plausible projects, such as the protracted development of a seaport at the town of Mutsamudu, construction of paved ring roads linking each island's coastal settlements, and the building of power stations, nonetheless tended to be instances of placing the cart before the horse. That is, capital-intensive improvements to infrastructure had not been coordinated with local development projects; hence, little, if any, domestic commerce existed to benefit from road networks, electrical power, and world-class port facilities.. The importation of huge quantities of building materials and construction equipment provided immediate benefits to import-export firms in the islands, of which √âtablissements Abdallah et Fils was the largest.. In the meantime, the projects were of little immediate use to Comorans and were likely to go underused for years to come. Throughout the Abdallah period, rice imports drained as much as 50 percent of Comoran export earnings. Projects to increase food self-sufficiency, as one observer noted, \\"fail[ed] to respond to the largesse\\" provided by international sponsors such as the European Development Fund and the International Fund for Agricultural Development. The president joined with vanilla growers in resisting international pressure to divert vanilla-producing land to the cultivation of corn and rice for domestic consumption. He also declined to heed World Bank advice to impose tariffs and domestic taxes on imported rice. Abdallah's import-export firm was heavily involved in vanilla exports, as well as in the importation of Far Eastern rice at three times its price at the source. Abdallah's firm, whose co-owners included Denard and Kalfane and Company, a Pakistani concern, also profited from managing the importation of materials used by South African firms in developing tourist hotels. Little of the material used in building these resorts was of Comoran origin. Also, once completed, the resorts would be almost entirely owned and managed by non-Comorans. Although tourism, mainly by South Africans who were unwelcome in other African resorts, was widely considered the only promising new industry in the Comoros, Abdallah guided its development so that resorts benefited few Comorans other than himself and his associates. Under Abdallah's tutelage, the Comoran economy finished the 1980s much as it had started the decade‚Äîpoor, underdeveloped, and dependent on export earnings from cash crops of unpredictable and generally declining value. The critical difference, with enormous implications for the republic's capacity to have some say in its own destiny, was its new status as a nation abjectly in debt. By 1988, the last full year of the Abdallah regime, 80 percent of annual public expenditures were funded by external aid. The demise of Abdallah, 1989 Only weeks before the violent end of the Abdallah regime in late 1989, one observer noted that the \\"Comoros is still run like a village, with a handful of tough men in charge and supported by foreign aid.\\". As Comorans prepared for a November 4, 1989, referendum on constitutional changes that would enable President Abdallah to run for a third term in 1990, human rights remained in precarious condition, and the only avenue of economic advancement for most islanders‚Äîthe civil service‚Äîfaced cutbacks at the urging of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.. Even those who would keep their government jobs, however, were not guaranteed economic security. As often occurred whenever export earnings slid, civil servants had not been paid since mid-summer. The official result of the referendum was a 92.5 percent majority in favor of the amendments proposed by Abdallah, which now created \\"the conditions for a life presidency\\", warned one opposition leader. Balloting was marked by the now customary manipulation by the government. Opposition groups reported that polling places lacked private voting booths, government officials blocked the entry of opposition poll watchers, and the army and police removed ballot boxes before voting ended. Reaction to these abuses was unusually angry. In Njazidja voters smashed ballot boxes rather than have them carted away by the army; the governor's office was set on fire in Nzwani, and a bomb was found outside the home of the minister of finance in Moroni. More than 100 people were arrested following the election, and in subsequent weeks the international media described a deteriorating situation in the islands; the head of state claimed that France \\"authorizes terrorism in the Comoros\\", and leaders of the banned opposition in bold public statements questioned the legitimacy of the referendum. President Abdallah was shot to death on the night of November 26‚Äì27, reportedly while asleep in his residence, the Beit el Salama (House of Peace). At first his death was seen as a logical outcome of the tense political situation following what was, in effect, his self-appointment as head of state for life. The recently dismissed head of the Comoran military was duly blamed for the murder. Evidence emerged subsequently that Abdallah's assassination resulted from the late president's proposed actions with regard to the GP. In September 1989, Abdallah had engaged a French military consultant, who determined that the GP should be absorbed into the regular army. Following consultations among Abdallah, the French government, and South Africa's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a decision was made to expel Denard and his fellow officers of the GP by the end of 1989.. Denard and his second in command were seen walking with Abdallah only hours before he died.. Although the mercenary initially blamed the assassination on the Comoran army, he later conceded that he was in Abdallah's office when the president was killed, but called the shooting \\"an accident due to the general state of mayhem\\" in the Beit al Salama. Two days later, on November 29, the real reasons for the assassination emerged when Denard and the GP seized control of the government in a coup. Twenty-seven police officers were killed, hundreds of people were arrested, and all journalists were confined to their hotels. The mercenaries disarmed the regular army, ousted provisional president Haribon Chebani, who as chief of the Supreme Court had succeeded Abdallah, and installed Mohamed Said Djohar, who just three days earlier had become chief of the Supreme Court, as the Comoros' third president in less than a week. The immediate reaction of the republic's two main supporters, France and South Africa, was to isolate Denard. South Africa, admitting years of funding of the GP, cut off all aid. France began a military build-up on Mahor√© and likewise suspended aid. On December 7, anti- Denard demonstrations by about 1,000 students and workers were violently broken up by the protests. By then the islands' school system had shut down, and the civil service had gone on strike. Faced with an untenable situation, Denard surrendered to French forces without a fight on December 15. Along with about two dozen comrades, he was flown to Pretoria and put under house arrest. The French government later announced that Denard would remain in detention in South Africa pending the outcome of a French judicial inquiry into Abdallah's death. In February 1993 he returned to France, where he was initially arrested, tried, and exonerated of involvement in the death of Abdallah.

Although possible, the first marriage is formally initiated with the grand marriage when possible, subsequent unions involve much simpler ceremonies. The result is that a man will establish two or even more households and will alternate residence between them, a reflection, most likely, of the trading origins of the Shirazi elite who maintained wives at different trading posts. Said Mohamed Djohar, elected president in 1990, had two wives, one in Njazidja and the other in Nzwani, an arrangement said to have broadened his appeal to voters. For men, divorce is easy, although by custom a divorced wife retains the family home. In the Comoros certain landholdings called magnahouli are controlled by women and inherited through the female line, apparently in observance of a surviving matriarchal African tradition. Despite their lower economic status, women in the Comoros who are married to farmers or laborers often move about more freely than their counterparts among the social elite, managing market stands or working in the fields. On Mwali, where traditional Islamic values are less dominant, women generally are not as strictly secluded. Women constituted 40.4 percent of the work force in 1990, a figure slightly above average for sub- Saharan Africa. Girls are somewhat less likely than boys to attend school in the Comoros. The World Bank estimated in 2010 that 70.6 percent of girls were enrolled in primary schools, whereas 80.5 percent of boys were enrolled. In secondary school, 15 percent of eligible Comoran girls were in attendance, in comparison with about 19 percent of eligible boys. Although the 1992 constitution recognizes their right to suffrage, as did the 1978 constitution, women otherwise play a limited role in politics in the Comoros. By contrast, in Mahor√© female merchants sparked the movement for continued association with France, and later, for continued separation from the Republic of the Comoros. The Comoros accepted international aid for family planning in 1983, but it was considered politically inexpedient to put any plans into effect. According to a 1993 estimate, there were 6.8 births per woman in the Comoros. By contrast, the figure was 6.4 births per woman for the rest of sub-Saharan Africa. In one of Comoran society's first acknowledgments of women as a discrete interest group, the Abdallah government organized a seminar, \\"Women, Family, and Development,\\" in 1986. Despite participants' hopes that programs for family planning and female literacy would be announced, conference organizers stressed the role of women in agriculture and family life. Women fared slightly better under the Djohar regime. In February 1990, while still interim president, Djohar created a cabinet-level Ministry of Social and Women's Affairs, and appointed a woman, Ahlonkoba Aithnard, to head it. She lasted until a few weeks after Djohar's election to the presidency in March, when her ministry was reorganized out of existence, along with several others. Another female official, Situ Mohamed, was named to head the second-tier Ministry of Population and Women's Affairs, in August 1991. She lost her position‚Äîand the subministry was eliminated‚Äîhardly a week later, in one of President Djohar's routine ministerial reshufflings. Djohar made another nod to women in February 1992, when he invited representatives of an interest group, the Women's Federation, to take part in discussions on what would become the constitution of 1992. Women only apparently organized and participated in a large demonstration critical of French support of the Djohar regime in October 1992, following government suppression of a coup attempt.

The mall's movie theater closed in 1988 when its lease was not renewed. In the 1990s, the mall underwent renovations, first in 1991 to update the interior and add security and then in 1997 to update its exterior signage and landscaping. It was in 1997 when Cortana Mall rebranded as the Mall at Cortana.\\"Cortana Celebrates 25th,\\" The Advocate, Baton Rouge, September 9, 2001, Page 2K With the rebrand, the Mall at Cortana and began to experience decline due to the Mall of Louisiana opening in South Baton Rouge in 1997. The issue was exacerbated when Towne Center at Cedar Lodge opened 3 miles away on Corporate Boulevard in 2005, causing many stores with duplicate Cortana locations to close or not renew their leases. It was also in the late 1990s that many of the anchors experienced name and location changes. The current Dillard's store at the mall was originally Goudchaux's, which was the first anchor to open at Cortana Mall. After the Sternberg family acquired New Orleans-based Maison Blanche in 1982, Goudchaux rebranded as Maison Blanche/Goudchaux and then became Maison Blanche in 1988 to discern itself from the similarly named Godchaux's Department Store in New Orleans. Mercantile Stores purchased the Maison Blanche stores from the Sternberg family in 1992 and operated the store until selling it to Dillard's in 1998. As a result, Dillard's relocated from its existing store to the former Maison Blanche. In 2009, the store converted to a single-level clearance center, which remains open to this day. The original Dillard's was then sold to Saks Incorporated, who converted it to Parisian in 1998, then McRae's a year later. When May Properties purchased the McRae's (in Cortana) and Parisian (in the Mall of Louisiana) in 2001, the two stores reopened as Foley's on March 28, 2001.\\"Two BR department stores close for makeovers\\", The Advocate, Baton Rouge, March 16, 2001, Page 4 C After Foley's was acquired by Macy's in September 2006, the Cortana and Mall of Louisiana stores both became Macy's. In 1985, Service Merchandise acquired H. J. Wilson Co. and rebranded the Cortana Mall store as such. Service Merchandise closed in early 2002 when the chain went bankrupt, leaving the anchor slot vacant until Steve & Barry's opened in 2004. Steve and Barry's closed as a result of the recession in 2009, leaving the space vacant for one year until Virginia College opened its Baton Rouge campus in the former store. The newest anchor, Mervyns, closed in 2006 when the store decided to focus its efforts on the Southwestern United States. The former slot is still used for fundraisers, most notably the Inner Wheel's Attic Trash and Treasure annual sale in March. In 2009, several new inline tenants opened in the mall, and the mall's name reverted to Cortana Mall. In 2012, Mall Properties, the original owner of the mall, sold Cortana Mall back to its lenders and brought in Woodmont Company to manage the property. In 2013, Moonbeam Equities of Las Vegas, NV purchased the mall's inline tenants and the old Mervyn's for $6 million.Cortana Mall property sold *** Las Vegas firm plans to lease available space, The Advocate, Baton Rouge, March 28, 2013, Page 6B During the late 2010s, Cortana Mall experienced retail freefall with numerous anchor and inline tenant closures. As of March 2016, the mall anchors were: Sears, Dillard's Clearance Center, JCPenney, Macy's, and Virginia College. In April 2016, Macy's announced it was leaving Cortana Mall.left On January 4, 2017, it was announced the Sears store would be closing in the spring of that year. During the same week, Footlocker announced they would be leaving the mall as well. On March 17, 2017, it was announced the JCPenney store will be closing on July 31 of that year. The closure of JCPenney left Dillard's Clearance Center as the only anchor left. On March 27, 2017, in an article from theadvocate.com highlighted there were only 48 stores within the mall that still had a tenant leaving 62 spaces vacant. Other remaining tenants and managers have raised concerns about leaving the mall due to losing the two remaining major anchor stores. Moonbeam put the property up for sale for $4 million in August 2017 but took the listing off the market in October 2018 due to lack of interest. In September 2018, Virginia College announced they would close the Cortana location in July 2019 as part of a nationwide downsizing. The campus closed at the end of 2018 when the college folded. By December 2017, the Dillard's outlet has permanently closed the mall entrance. As of April 2018, the mall had about 40 occupied stores, which continued to dwindle. As of May 2019, the mall's inline tenets consisted of three jewelers, a hair salon, Bath & Body Works, a Philly cheese steak grill, a church, a theatrical studio, and a small medical clinic among its inline tenants, with over 90% of the available properties and five anchors vacant. By the end of July 2019, Bath and Body Works closed its doors, and the remaining tenants were ordered to vacate the premises by September 15, 2019.https://www.wafb.com/2019/08/26/last-cortana-tenants-told-move-out-two- weeks/ The last remaining tenants are a USPS branch, a distribution center by the local Junior League, and a nurse practitioner clinic, and the mall was closed to mall walkers after September 3. The Baton Rouge Business Report has stated there is a possible deal that Amazon may move their distribution center operations to the mall. It was later confirmed in November that Amazon planned to buy the mall, as well as the former Macy's and Virginia College buildings, and build a new distribution center.

(sold under the name Streit's) is a kosher food company founded in Manhattan, New York City, best known for its product Streit's Matzo. It is the only family-owned and operated matzo company in the United States, and distributes matzo in select international markets. It holds about 40 percent of the United States matzo market with its major competitor, New Jersey based Manischewitz. The factory follows strict kosher laws. Only shomer Shabbat (Sabbath-observing) Jews are allowed to touch the dough. However, once the dough is baked, people of any religion and non-shomer Shabbat Jews are allowed to touch the matzo. The entire process of making the matzo is under Rabbinic supervision. In particular, they time the matzo-making process, checking to see it does not exceed 18 minutes. Otherwise, the batch would be considered not kosher for Passover and discarded. History The company was founded in 1916 by Aron Streit, a Jewish immigrant from Austria who had made matzo there in the late 1800s. Its first factory was on Pitt Street in the Lower East Side of Manhattan. There, Streit and his business associate Rabbi Weinberger made each piece of matzo by hand. In 1925, with the growing number of Jewish immigrants congregating in the Lower East Side, Streit, along with his two sons, Jack and Irving, moved his business to nearby 150 Rivington Street. Soon thereafter they bought the adjacent buildings, where the company operated for 90 years, before moving in 2015. Lower East Side factory Streit's matzo factory, along with Katz's Delicatessen and Yonah Schimmel's Knish Bakery, was a surviving piece of the Lower East Side's Jewish heritage. At the turn of the 20th century, Jews, along with other European immigrants, were crammed into the many unsanitary tenements of the Lower East Side. In 1915 they made up 60 percent of the Lower East Side population. Because of the large Jewish presence, Jewish-centric businesses like Streit's opened and flourished. However, because of the poor living conditions, as soon as they financially could, many Jewish families moved out of the tenements to new areas of industry in New York City, namely uptown and Brooklyn, slowly making Streit's a relic of the past. Streit's Lower East Side matzo factory usually baked about of matzo each day. In preparation for Passover the factory ran 20 hours a day, testing its per day capacity. New factory Since the 1980s the Lower East Side has experienced hyper-gentrification. The neighborhood is now a burgeoning area for glass luxury high-rise buildings such as the Blue Condo and the Hotel on Rivington, a stark contrast to Streit's modest brick factory. The Streit family even considered at one point opening a caf√© or bar that serves matzo, to go with the Lower East Side's new nightlife scene. On December 20, 2007, it was announced that the factory had been listed for sale for $25,000,000. The Streit's family cited noise complaints, congested streets, and their desire to modernize its equipment, as the reasons for their eventual move. Its realtor, Massey Knakel Realty Services, commented \\"the building will most likely be torn down and converted into luxury condominiums.\\" Midtown East-based Cogswell Realty bought the factory for $30.5 million in 2015.

He has also been credited with inventing the name \\"microscope\\". brunelleschi.imss.fi.it \\"Il microscopio di Galileo\\" Biography Johann Faber was born the son of Protestant parents in Bamberg in 1574. When he was one year old he was orphaned by an epidemic of the plague. He was raised and educated in the Catholic faith by his cousin Philip Schmidt. He studied medicine at the University of W√ºrzburg and graduated in 1597. In order to continue his studies he moved to Rome in 1598, where he worked as a doctor in the hospital of Santo Spirito in Sassia. His practical studies of anatomy proceeded from direct observation of the human body.Irene Baldriga, \\"Il museo anatomico di Giovanni Faber Linceo\\", in Scienza e miracoli nell'arte del '600. Alle origini della medicina moderna (Electa: Rome) 1998:82‚Äì87. He later turned exclusively to the study of animal anatomy. In 1600 he was appointed to the chair of Botany and of Anatomy at the Sapienza University of Rome. In the same year he became the director of the Papal botanical garden (now the Orto Botanico dell'Universit√† di Roma \\"La Sapienza\\"). Diplomacy at the papal court Thanks to these new engagements he attended the papal court more regularly, and gradually became known as an effective spokesman for people from his homeland with sensitive causes. He also cultivated deep artistic interests, becoming an avid collector of paintings. In 1611 Faber's interest in natural investigation led him to become a member of the Accademia dei Lincei. Faber attended the papal court regularly under five Popes (Clement VIII, Leo XI, Paul V, Gregory XV and Urban VIII), and developed friendships with powerful figures including cardinals Cinzio Aldobrandini, Scipione Borghese, Francesco Barberini and Scipione Cobelluzzi. With these important connections, he was entrusted over many years with confidential business by many leading German families, including the Fuggers of Augsburg, the brothers Philip III, Landgrave of Hesse-Butzbach and Frederick I, Landgrave of Hesse-Homburg, the Landgraves of Hesse-Darmstadt Ludwig V and his son George II, John Casimir, Count of Erbach-Breuberg, Frederick IV of F√ºrstenberg and Philipp Otto zu Salm.http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/giovanni-faber_%28Dizionario- Biografico%29/ accessed 17/7/2017 Visit to Naples In 1608 Faber was sent by Pope Paul V to Naples. The Pope wanted him to report discreetly about the conditions in which Tommaso Campanella was being held in the Castel Sant'Elmo where he had been held since his imprisonment in 1600 for unorthodox views and rebellion. Faber's contacts Caspar Schoppe and the Fuggers also encouraged him to use his good offices on Campanella's behalf. Faber's visit seems to have been instrumental in securing Campanella's transfer to the more humane prison of Castel dell'Ovo. However the official purpose of his visit to Naples was to gather exotic plants for the Vatican gardens. Faber spent two months, enjoying the vigorous intellectual life of Naples with men such as Ferrante Imperato, Giambattista Della Porta, Fabio Colonna, Giulio Cesare Capaccio, Nicola Antonio Stigliola, Quinzio Bongiovanni, Mario Schipani, Marco Aurelio Severino and Brother Donato D'Eremita and learning about plants, botanical gardens and collections of rare objects. http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/giovanni- faber_%28Dizionario-Biografico%29/ accessed 23/7/2017 Scientific Interests His interests in natural philosophy continued to develop after his return to Rome. Here he was a frequent visitor to the pharmacy of his friend the Dutch botanist Enrico Corvino at the sign of the Imperial Eagle in Montegiordano, where many of the city's artists and physicians gathered. Faber was also friendly with Peter Paul Rubens who was working in the city until 1608, as well as other painters and miniaturists. Corvino was to become a member of the Accademia dei Lincei in 1611, and Faber came to know a number of the men who were involved in its work, including Federico Cesi, its founder, Johann Schreck and Theophilus M√ºller. On 29 October 1611 Faber himself became a member. http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/giovanni-faber_%28Dizionario- Biografico%29/ accessed 23/7/2017 December 1612 saw the visit to Rome of Johann Gottfried von Aschhausen, Prince-Bishop of Bamberg. Faber hoped to make him a gift of a telescope, but was unable to do so owing to the difficulties Galileo as experiencing in producing lenses of sufficiently high quality. Nevertheless, he was able to use the visit to help foster academic projects in Germany, ensuring that the Bishop was given a number of books written by members of the Accademia, and a sample volume of Hernandez's Mexicanarum plantarum which Cesi had charged Schreck and Faber with editing. Faber's work, with a dedication to Francesco Barberini, was finally published in 1628 under the title Animalia Mexicana, while the edited version of Hernandez' full original was published only after his death, in 1651. http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/giovanni-faber_%28Dizionario- Biografico%29/ accessed 23/7/2017 Naming the microscope Giovanni Faber has been credited with giving the microscope its name. In 1609 fellow Lincean Galileo developed a compound microscope with a convex and a concave lens which he called the occhiolino, the \\"little eye\\". In 1624 Galileo presented his occhiolino to Prince Federico Cesi, founder of the Accademia dei Lincei. One year later Giovanni Faber coined the word microscope from the Greek words ŒºŒπŒ∫œÅœåŒΩ (micron) meaning \\"small\\", and œÉŒ∫ŒøœÄŒµ·øñŒΩ (skopein) meaning \\"to look at\\". The word was meant to be analogous with telescope, another word coined by the Linceans.Letter from Giovanni Faber to Prince Frederico Cesi dated April 13, 1625. An English translation of Faber's letter is available in: William B. Carpenter with W. H. Dallinger, ed., The Microscope and Its Revelations, 8th ed. (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: P. Blakiston's Son & Co., 1901), pages 124-125. brunelleschi.imss.fi.it \\"Il microscopio di Galileo\\" Family In 1608 Faber became a naturalised Roman by adopting the legal status of \\"civis romanus\\": on 19 August 1612 he married Maria Anna Hyrler, who was herself born in Rome to German parents. Faber died on 17 September 1629 and was buried, in accordance with his last wish, in the church of Santa Maria dell'Anima next to his wife who had died some two years previously. He was survived by several children; Maria Vittoria, Maria Maddalena and Giano Domenico.http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/giovanni-faber_%28Dizionario- Biografico%29/ accessed 17/7/2017 References External links * \\"Medical competence, anatomy and the polity in seventeenth-century\\" by Rome Silvia De Renzi, Renaissance Studies Vol. 21 No. 4 * COMITATO NAZIONALE PER IL IV CENTENARIO DELLA FONDAZIONE DELLA ACCADEMIA DEI LINCEI - Faber Schmidt * 'Science Books and Censorship in the Academy of the Lincei: Johannes Faber as Cultural Mediator in Conflicting Duties' 1574 births 1629 deaths German botanists Members of the Lincean Academy German Roman Catholics ","title":"Giovanni Faber"},{"id":"16078693","text":"Practically all children attend Quranic school for two or three years, starting around age five; there they learn the rudiments of the Islamic faith and some classical Arabic. When rural children attend these schools, they sometimes move away from home and help the teacher work his land.Comoros country study. This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. France established a system of primary and secondary schools based on the French model, which remains largely in place. Comoran law requires all children to complete eight years of schooling between the ages of seven and fifteen. The system provides six years of primary education for students ages six to twelve, followed by seven years of secondary school. In recent years, enrollment has expanded greatly, particularly at the primary level. About 20,750 pupils, or roughly 75 percent of primary-school-age children were enrolled in 1993, up from about 4p in the late 1970s. About 17 percent of the secondary-school age population was enrolled, up from an estimated 7 percent fifteen to twenty years earlier. Teacher-student ratios also improved, from 47:1 to 36:1 in the primary schools and from 26:1 to 25:1 in secondary schools. The increased attendance was all the more significant given the population's high percentage of school-age children. Improvement in educational facilities was funded in 1993 by loans from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and the African Development Bank. Despite the spread of education, adult literacy in 1993 has been estimated at no better than 50 percent. Teaching Shindzuwani y Anjouan The Comoros has a university called the University of Comoros. Teacher training and other specialized courses are available at the M'Vouni School for Higher Education, in operation since 1981 at a site near Moroni. Few Comoran teachers study overseas, but the republic often cannot give its teachers all the training they need. Some international aid has been provided, however, to further teacher training in the islands themselves. For example, in 1987 the IDA extended credits worth US$7.9 million to train 3,000 primary and 350 secondary school teachers. In 1986 the government began opening technology training centers offering a three-year diploma program at the upper secondary level. The Ministry of National Education and Professional Training is responsible for education policy. As elsewhere in Comoran society, political instability has taken a toll on the education system. Routinely announced reductions in force among the civil service, often made in response to international pressure for fiscal reform, sometimes result in teacher strikes. When civil service cutbacks result in canceled classes or examinations, students have at times taken to the streets in protest. Students have also protested, even violently, against government underfunding or general mismanagement of the schools: the World Bank stated in 1994 that the quality of education resulted in such high rates of repetition and dropouts that the average student needed fourteen years to complete the six-year primary cycle. Primary education is compulsory until the age of 14. However, the government does not enforce attendance, and boys are often given preference. In 2002, the gross primary enrollment rate was 90 percent and in 1999, the most recent year for which data are available, the net primary enrollment rate was 55 percent. Gross and net enrollment ratios are based on the number of students formally registered in primary school and therefore do not necessarily reflect actual school attendance. In 2000, 44.2 percent of children ages 5 to 14 years were attending school. There is a general lack of facilities, equipment, qualified teachers, textbooks and other resources. Salaries for teachers are often so far in arrears that many refuse to work.\\"Comoros\\". 2005 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor .

Janecyk (born May 18, 1957 in Chicago, Illinois) is a retired American professional ice hockey goaltender who played 110 games in the National Hockey League for the Los Angeles Kings and Chicago Blackhawks. Janecyk attended Marist High School and played for Chicago State University in his hometown from 1976-78. He broke into pro hockey for the Fort Wayne Komets, then played in the American Hockey League for the New Brunswick Hawks, going 11-2 in the 1982 playoffs as the team captured the AHL's Calder Cup. Janecyk finally got a chance to be the NHL Blackhawks' goaltender in the 1983-84 season, appearing in eight games. A blockbuster trade on the day of the 1984 NHL entry draft sent Chicago's first, third and fourth-round selections plus Janecyk to the Los Angeles Kings for their first and fourth-round picks. It ended up with one Chicago native leaving town but another arriving, the Blackhawks using the new first-round pick to draft Ed Olczyk. They were several years apart in age, but Janecyk and Olczyk had both often trained at the same local rink in their youth, and their high schools, Marist and Brother Rice, were arch rivals. Also noteworthy from that deal, the Kings and new general manager Rogie Vachon used their fourth-round pick from Chicago to draft a future Hall of Famer, but one from a different sport, baseball pitcher Tom Glavine. Their first-round pick Craig Redmond had limited success and Glavine chose not to play hockey, but in the ninth round of that draft, the Kings did actually land a future Hall of Famer of hockey, Luc Robitaille. Janecyk received more playing time out of the change of teams. He started in goal 89 times for Los Angeles the next two seasons, plus three games of the 1984-85 NHL playoffs. Two of those games went to overtime, but Janecyk and the Kings ended up eliminated by Wayne Gretzky and the Edmonton Oilers, who went on to win the Stanley Cup. Gretzky would be acquired by the Kings in August 1988, but by then Janecyk's career was almost over. He retired in 1989.

Martin & Company dreadnought|thumb|right The dreadnought is a type of acoustic guitar body developed by American guitar manufacturer C.F. Martin & Company. The style, since copied by other guitar manufacturers, has become the most common for acoustic guitars. At the time of its creation in 1916 the word dreadnought referred to a large, all big-gun, modern battleship of the type pioneered by in 1906. A body much larger than most other guitars provided the dreadnought with a bolder, perhaps richer, and often louder tone. It is distinguished by its size and square shoulders and bottom. The neck is usually attached to the body at the fourteenth fret. Martin dreadnought guitars are also known as \\"D-size\\" guitars, or, colloquially among musicians, as dreads. Their model numbers consist of \\"D-\\" followed by a number, such as \\"D-18\\" and \\"D-45\\". The higher the numerical designation, the more decorative ornamentation on the instrument. History The dreadnought style was originally developed in 1916 and was manufactured by Martin specifically for retailer the Oliver Ditson Company. The model was retired after dismal sales. In 1931, after revising the design, Martin began producing dreadnought guitars under its own brand, the first two models being the D-1 and D-2, with bodies made of mahogany and rosewood respectively. The popularity of and demand for Martin dreadnought guitars was increased by their use, almost exclusively, by folk musicians of the mid-20th century, including most bluegrass guitarists. Today dreadnoughts are considered the standard guitar of bluegrass music, used by many bluegrass musicians to produce a signature sound of that genre. Martin dreadnoughts manufactured prior to 1946 are highly desired by musicians due to their loud volume and exceptional tone due to the use of scalloped bracing. It is not uncommon for these guitars to sell for in excess of $30,000. The Gibson Guitar Company's initial response to the Martin dreadnought was the round- shouldered J-35, which it introduced in 1934. It introduced its first square shouldered guitar, the Hummingbird, in 1960. Since then, dreadnoughts have been made by nearly all of the major guitar manufacturers worldwide in both standard and more recently various single-cutaway forms. References External links *C.F.

This process is typically slower than traditional rendering, which renders the scene in its red, green, and blue components and then overlays the images. Spectral rendering is often used in ray tracing or photon mapping to more accurately simulate the scene, often for comparison with an actual photograph to test the rendering algorithm (as in a Cornell Box) or to simulate different portions of the electromagnetic spectrum for the purpose of scientific work. The images simulated are not necessarily more realistic appearing, but when compared to a real image pixel for pixel the result is often much closer. Spectral rendering can also simulate light sources and objects more effectively, as the light's emission spectrum can be used to release photons at a particular wavelength in proportion to the spectrum. Objects' spectral reflectance curves can similarly be used to reflect certain portions of the spectrum more accurately. As an example, certain properties of tomatoes make them appear differently under sunlight than under fluorescent light. Using the blackbody radiation equations to simulate sunlight or the emission spectrum of a fluorescent bulb in combination with the tomato's spectral reflectance curve, more accurate images of each scenario can be produced.

The nominal spin axis, or +z axis, points to the upper right, with the RMC and one star tracker for attitude determination. The remaining instruments and a second star tracker point out of the image towards the viewer. The four solar panels charged batteries during orbit day. The Small Astronomy Satellite 3 (SAS 3, also known as SAS-C before launch) was a NASA X-ray astronomy space telescope.Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics \\"X-ray Astronomy Missions\\", H. Bradt, T. .Ohashi,. and K. Pound., Vol. 30, p. 391 ff (1992) It functioned from May 7, 1975 to April 1979. It covered the X-ray range with four experiments on board. The satellite, built by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL), was proposed and operated by MIT's Center for Space Research (CSR). It was launched on a Scout vehicle from the Italian San Marco launch platform near Mombasa, Kenya, into a low-Earth, nearly equatorial orbit. It was also known as Explorer 53, as part of NASA's Explorer program.HEASARC GSFC, retrieved Oct 17, 2009 Mission Overview The spacecraft was 3-axis stabilized with a momentum wheel that was used to establish stability about the nominal rotation, or z-axis. The orientation of the z-axis could be altered over a period of hours using magnetic torque coils that interacted with the Earth's magnetic field. Solar panels charged batteries during the daylight portion of each orbit, so that SAS 3 had essentially no expendables to limit its lifetime beyond the life of the tape recorders, batteries, and orbital drag. The spacecraft typically operated in a rotating mode, spinning at one revolution per 95-min orbit, so that the LEDs, tube and slat collimator experiments, which looked out along the y-axis, could view and scan the sky almost continuously. The rotation could also be stopped, allowing extended (up to 30 min) pointed observations of selected sources by the y-axis instruments. Data were recorded on board by magnetic tape recorders, and played back during station passes every orbit.W. Mayer 1975, APL Tech Digest, 14, 14. SAS 3 was commanded from the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) in Greenbelt MD, but data were transmitted by modem to MIT for scientific analysis, where scientific and technical staff were on-duty 24 hours a day. The data from each orbit were subjected to quick-look scientific analysis at MIT before the next orbital station pass, so the science operational plan could be altered by telephoned instruction from MIT to GSFC in order to study targets in near real-time. Objectives The major scientific objectives of the mission were: # Determine bright X-ray source locations to an accuracy of 15 arcseconds # Study selected sources over the energy range 0.1-55 keV # Continuously search the sky for X-ray novae, flares, and other transient phenomena Instrumentation SAS 3 carried four experiments: # Rotating Modulation Collimator (RMC) Experiment, which observed along the rotation (Z) axis of the spacecraft, covering the 2‚Äì11 keV energy range, and providing high-precision locations of X-ray sources to an accuracy of up ~15 arcseconds. # Slat collimated proportional counter instrument, covering 1‚Äì60 keV, looking out perpendicular to the spacecraft Z-axis, and providing coarse positions of unknown and transient sources. # Tube collimated proportional counter instrument, also covering 1‚Äì60 keV and also looking out perpendicular to the spacecraft Z-axis, for detailed study of the spectral behavior and time-variability of sources observed during pointed or dithered observations. # Low-Energy Detector (LED) system, covering 0.1-1 keV with a 2.9¬∞ FOV along the y-axis. Research results SAS 3 was especially productive due to its flexibility and rapid responsiveness. Among its most important results were: * Shortly after the discovery of the first X-ray burster by the ANS, an intense period of burst source discovery by SAS 3 quickly led to the discovery and characterization of about a dozen additional objects, including the famous Rapid Burster,HEASARC Rapid burster Light curve of the Rapid Burster MXB1730-335.Lewin, W. H. G. et al. Astrophys. J. Lett. 209, L95‚àíL99 (1976)H. L.

These observations established the identification of bursting X-ray sources with neutron star binary systems. * The RMC was the first instrument to routinely provide X-ray positions that were sufficiently precise to allow followup by optical observatories to establish X-ray/optical counterparts, even in crowded regions near the galactic plane. Roughly 60 positions were obtained with accuracies on the order of 1 arcminute or less. The resulting source identifications helped to connect X-ray astronomy to the main body of stellar astrophysics. * Discovery of the 3.6 s pulsations of the transient neutron star/Be star binary 4U 0115+63.,L. Cominsky et al., \\"Discovery of 3.6-s X-ray pulsations from 4U0115+63\\", Nature 273, 367 - 369 (01 June 1978); leading to determination of its orbit and observation of a cyclotron absorption line in its strong magnetic field. Many Be star/neutron star binaries were subsequently discovered as a class of X-ray emitters. * Discovery of X-ray emission from HZ 43 (an isolated white dwarf),Hearn, D. R. et al. 1976, Astrophys.

The former provides the basis for religion and law; the East African influence is evident in the language, a Swahili dialect, and in a number of pre-Islamic customs. Western, primarily French, influences are also prevalent, particularly in the modern educational sector, the civil service, and cultural affairs. Language The Comoran people are a blend of Bantu, Arab, Somali, and Malayo-Indonesian elements. A few small communities, primarily in Mahor√©, speak Kibushi, a Malagasy dialect. The principal Comoran Swahili dialect, written in Arabic script, is related to the Swahili spoken in East Africa but is not easily intelligible to East African Swahili speakers. Classical Arabic is significant for religious reasons, and French remains the principal language with which the Republic of the Comoros communicates with the rest of the world. Early Settlements A number of ethnically distinguishable groups are found: the Arabs, descendants of Shirazi settlers, who arrived in significant numbers in the fifteenth century; the Cafres, an African group that settled on the islands before the coming of the Shirazi; a second African group, the Makoa, descendants of slaves brought by the Arabs from the East African coast; and three groups of Malayo-Indonesian peoples‚Äîthe Oimatsaha, the Antalotes, and the Sakalava, the latter having settled largely on Mahor√©. Intermarriage has tended to blur the distinctions among these groups, however. Creoles, descendants of French settlers who intermarried with the indigenous peoples, form a tiny but politically influential group on Mahor√©, numbering no more than about 100 on that island. They are predominantly Roman Catholic and mainly cultivate small plantations. In addition, a small group of people descended in part from the Portuguese sailors who landed on the Comoro Islands at the beginning of the sixteenth century are reportedly living around the town of Tsangadjou on the east coast of Njazidja. Royal Clans Shirazi Arab royal clans dominated the islands socially, culturally, and politically from the fifteenth century until the French occupation. Eleven such clans lived on Njazidja, where their power was strongest, and their leaders, the sultans or sharifs, who claimed to be descendants of the Prophet Muhammad, were in a continual state of war until the French occupation. Two similar clans were located on Nzwani, and these clans maintained vassals on Mahor√© and Mwali after the Sakalava wiped out the local nobles in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries . Although the clan system was weakened by the economic and social dislocations of the colonial era, the descendants of clan nobles continue to form a major portion of the educated and propertied classes. The pre-independence rivalry of Said Mohamed Cheikh and Prince Said Ibrahim, leaders, respectively, of the conservative Parti Vert and the Parti Blanc, was interpreted by some as a revival of old clan antagonisms. Yet many descendants of nobles live in poverty and apparently have less influence socially and politically on Nzwani than on Njazidja. The present-day elite, although composed in part of those of noble ancestry who took advantage of the opportunities of the cash crop economy established by the French, is mainly defined in terms of wealth rather than caste or descent. This focus on wealth is not unusual, considering that the original Shirazi settlers themselves were traders and that the precolonial sultans were actively involved in commerce. Conspicuous consumption continues to mark the lifestyle of the elite. Present day Especially well regarded are those individuals who hold the grand marriage, often after a lifetime of scrimping and saving. This wedding ceremony, which can cost as much as the equivalent of US$20,000 to US$30,000, involves an exchange of expensive gifts between the couple's families and feasts for an entire village. Although the gift giving and dancing that accompany the grand marriage have helped perpetuate indigenous arts in silversmithing, goldsmithing, folk song, and folk dance, the waste involved has disastrous consequences for an economy already short on domestic resources. A ban or curb on the grand marriage was on the agenda of many reformers in the period preceding the radical regime of Ali Soilih, who himself had taken the almost unheard-of step of declining to participate in the ritual. However, the efforts of the Soilih government to restrict the custom aroused great resentment, and it was restored to its preeminent place in Comoran society almost immediately after Soilih was deposed in 1978. Although its expense limits the number of families that can provide their sons and daughters a grand marriage, the ritual is still used as a means of distinguishing Comoran society's future leaders. Only by participating in the ceremony is a Comoran man entitled to participate in his village's assembly of notables and to wear the mharuma, a sash that entitles him to enter the mosque by a special door. Few, if any, candidates win election to the National Assembly without a grand marriage in their pasts. For these reasons in particular, critics of traditional Comoran society condemn the grand marriage as a means of excluding people of modest resources from participating in the islands' political life. Those who can afford the pilgrimage to Mecca are also accorded prestige. The imams who lead prayers in mosques form a distinct elite group. Despite the weakening of the position of the Shirazi elite, one observer reports that in many subtle ways old distinctions persist. The descendants of slaves, formally emancipated in 1904, are mostly sharecroppers or squatters, working the land that belonged to their ancestors' former owners, although some have gone abroad as migrant laborers (a greatly restricted option since Madagascar's expulsion of thousands of Comorans in the late 1970s). Men of \\"freeborn\\" families choose \\"freeborn\\" wives, holding, if possible, a grand marriage; but if they take second wives, these women often are of slave ancestry.

French assistance was eventually resumed, and other nations also contributed medical assistance to the young republic. Despite improvements in life expectancy and the infant mortality rate, the Comoros in 1993 continued to face public health problems characteristic of developing countries. Maternal and child health care The 2010 maternal mortality rate per 100,000 births for the Comoros is 340. This is compared with 225.3 in 2008 and 449.9 in 1990. The under 5 mortality rate, per 1,000 births is 105 and the neonatal mortality as a percentage of under 5's mortality is 35. In the Comoros the number of midwives per 1,000 live births is 9 and the lifetime risk of death for pregnant women 1 in 71. Life expectancy at birth was estimated at fifty-six years in 1990, up from fifty-one years in 1980. The crude birthrate was forty-eight per 1,000 and the crude death rate, twelve per 1,000 according to 1989 statistics. All three of these figures were close to the averages for sub-Saharan Africa. The rate of infant mortality per 1,000 live births was eighty-nine in 1991, down from 113 in 1980. The 1990 average rate for sub-Saharan Africa was 107. Disease Malaria was ubiquitous in the islands, with 80 to 90 percent of the population said to be affected by the disease. Other prevalent maladies included tuberculosis, leprosy, and parasitic diseases. In 1989 about half of all children one year old or younger had been immunized against tuberculosis, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, polio, and measles, a proportion roughly comparable to the rate of immunization among other states in sub-Saharan Africa. Per capita daily caloric intake in 1988 was 2,046, about average for sub-Saharan Africa but only a little better than 90 percent of daily requirements. Children were most often the victims of malnutrition. Their generally poor diets were deficient in protein in part because local custom discouraged the feeding of fish to children. The scarcity of safe drinking water‚Äîavailable to about one in three Comorans‚Äîmade intestinal parasites a problem and compounded malnutrition, with children again being the main victims. The World Bank estimated that in 1993 the Comoros had one physician per 6,582 Comorans, a marked improvement over the ratio of one to 13,810 reported in 1983. Comparable data for sub-Saharan Africa as a whole were not available; however, it appeared that Comorans enjoyed a more favorable ratio than many of their neighbors in East Africa and the Indian Ocean. Despite improvements in life expectancy, infant mortality, and the number of physicians, the overall quality of care remained poor. About 80 percent of the population lives within one hour's walk of a health facility, usually headed by a trained nurse, but paramedical staff are in short supply and many health facilities are in poor condition. Some international medical aid has been provided, mostly by France and the World Health Organization (WHO). Although the Comoros lacks homegrown narcotics, the islands are used as a transit site for drugs coming mainly from Madagascar. In view of international concern about drug trafficking, in 1993 France began providing technical expertise in this field to the Comoros. In addition, the World Bank in a 1994 report pointed out the \\"high prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases and the low use of condoms\\" as a significant health threat with regard to the spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), which already affected the islands. However, in the period prior to 1990 and extending through 1992, the WHO reported that the Comoros had a very low incidence of AIDS‚Äîa total of three cases with no case reported in 1992, or an overall case rate of 0.1 per 100,000 population.

State-run Radio Comoros, transmitting from Grand Comore, was not strong enough to send clear signals to the republic's other two islands. In 1984 France agreed to provide Radio Comoros with funding for an FM (frequency modulation) transmitter strong enough to broadcast to all three islands, and in 1985 made a commitment to fund a national newspaper after a United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) study revealed that the Comoros was the only UN member lacking print and electronic media. A state-owned newspaper, Al-Watwan, began operations in July 1985, first as a monthly and soon afterward as a weekly. There are now a number of publications, either daily, such as La Gazette des Comores, or weekly, such as L'Archipel, an independent weekly which began publishing in 1988 and now appears intermittently. Al Balad, a daily published by CGH, is now defunct. A news agency, Agence Comores Presse, is based in Moroni. In addition to national broadcasts on FM in Comorian, Swahili and French, Radio Comoros in 1993 broadcast internationally on the shortwave band in Swahili, Arabic, and French, but shortwave services have now been suspended. There are a number independent commercial FM radio stations in the country, Radio Tropique FM, one of the first, began broadcasting in 1991, although it and its director, political activist Ali Bakar Cassim, have occasionally been the object of government ire. The ORTC (Office de Radio et T√©l√©vision des Comores), whose studios were funded by the Chinese government, now broadcasts both radio and television both free to air nationally and by cable and satellite in France. In 1989 the Comoros had an estimated 61,000 radios and 200 television sets. Freedom of Speech Representatives of the independent media have occasionally been rounded up along with other critics of the government during the republic's recurrent bouts of political crisis. However, freedom of speech is generally respected and outlets such as Radio Tropique FM and L'Archipel, which is noted for its satirical column, \\"Winking Eye\\", continue to provide independent political commentary.

Since 1866 the town was organized by Anacleto Gil. Born as a humble village, and remained for a long time. Subsequently, the action of governors and individuals was giving the urban characteristics: paving, trees, public buildings, theatres, rides and lighting. The great advances such as rail, tram, flooring, electricity, telegraph, telephone and sewer arrived in the late 19th century and early 20th century.  Geography  The capital of San Juan has an area of . To the north bordering department Chimbas, on the east by Santa Luc√≠a, to the west and south by Rivadavia Rawson. The approximate population of the department of capital is 118,500 inhabitants.  Population  According to estimates from INDEC in the year 2,005 had 116,511 inhabitants. The distinctly urban population continuously receives contributions from the rest of the departments. As offers the most diverse and specialized services, especially health, education and administration, represents a center that attracts large numbers of people, especially during the day. There are numerous cases of immigrants seeking work. There are areas of high concentration, with large vertical constructions as the neighborhood St. Maarten. The more downtown housing are generally preferred by older people, while the rest of the population has chosen to places further away from the bustle of the city.  Services  The department Capital has all the services of a modern city. It is headquarters of the provincial government since it within its boundaries is Government House, the Legislature and the Court of Justice. The business sector is in the micro center, space defined by the streets on May 25, Spain, July 9 and Rawson Avenue. The educational supply is ample, varied and complete. The department has establishment at all levels (Beginner, EGB 1, 2, 3, Polymodal, Not Higher University and University), which convened a large number of students from all departments, from other provinces and even from neighbouring countries.  Tourism  While overall sanjuanina building is modern, the department retains old buildings of great historical and architectural value. Among the buildings that were restored after the earthquake of 1944, we found the Convent of Santo Domingo, the birthplace of Sarmiento, William Rawson Hospital, the Museum of Fine Arts and the Ecole Normale Sarmiento. The Cathedral of St. John and John Auditorium Victoria are examples of modern buildings in the city.

He was born at Fulton‚Äôs ranch and began early basic training there before he became ill with strangles. Upon recovering from the illness, Peppy San Badger was sold to the King Ranch of South Texas in 1977, where he remained a breeding stallion until his death. Peppy San Badger was trained by trainer and rider Buster Welch, the same trainer who had ridden his sire, Mr San Peppy, to the win in both the 1974 and 1976 NCHA Open World Championships. Peppy San Badger won the NCHA 1977 Futurity with Welch as rider. Shortly after the Futurity, Welch bought ‚ÄúLittle Peppy‚Äù after the King Ranch decided they did not need him as a junior stallion because they already owned his sire Mr San Peppy. Welch owned him for a year before agreeing to sell him back to King Ranch to become a part of their breeding program.

An avid traveler, he was also known for his paintings of European and Asian landmarks, as well as natural landscapes, portraits, florals, and interiors. In addition to being a painter, he was also a teacher and writer. His first wife, Emma Lampert Cooper, was also a highly regarded painter. Background and education Colin Campbell Cooper, Jr. was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on March 8, 1856, into a well-to-do family of English-Irish heritage. He had four older and four younger siblings. His mother, Emily Williams Cooper, whose ancestor emigrated to the U.S. from Weymouth, England, was an amateur painter in watercolors. His father, Dr. Colin Campbell Cooper, whose grandfather came from Derry, Ireland, was a surgeon and a lawyer with a great appreciation for the arts. Young Colin had been inspired by the art which he discovered when he attended the Philadelphia Exposition of 1876. Both of his parents were highly supportive of his ambitions, encouraging him to become an artist. In 1879, Cooper enrolled in the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia, studying art under famed controversial realist painter Thomas Eakins for three years. In 1886, he embarked on the first of his many travels to foreign lands, visiting the Netherlands, Belgium, and Brittany. Afterwards, his art education resumed at the Acad√©mie Julian in Paris from 1886 to 1890, with Henri Lucien Doucet, William-Adolphe Bouguereau, and Jules Joseph Lefebvre. He also studied at Acad√©mie Del√©cluse and Acad√©mie Vitti. His work of this period consisted mostly of landscapes painted in a Barbizon manner. He traveled extensively throughout his life, sketching and painting scenes of Europe, Asia, and the United States in watercolors and oils. Life and work =Philadelphia and New York= Portrait of Emma Lampert Cooper by Colin Campbell Cooper, c. 1897 Back in Philadelphia, Cooper taught watercolor classes and architectural rendering at the Drexel Institute of Art, Science and Industry (now Drexel University) from 1895 to 1898. Many of Cooper's paintings were destroyed in an 1896 fire at Philadelphia's Hazeltine Galleries; as a result, relatively little of his early work exists today. While at Drexel, he spent his summers abroad, primarily in the Dutch artists colony of Laren in North Holland and in Dordrecht in South Holland. Among the other artists in Dordrecht at this time was renowned painter Emma Lampert (1855‚Äì1920) from Rochester, New York. She and Cooper met, and were soon married, in Rochester on June 9, 1897. In 1898, the Coopers returned to Europe for a few years. During this period, as Cooper painted architectural landmarks, he developed the Impressionist style which he used for the rest of his artistic career. Hudson River Waterfront, N. Y. C., 1913-21 Cooper and his wife exhibited together in several two-person shows, including a May 1902 exhibit at the Philadelphia Art Club and a 1915 show at the Memorial Art Gallery in Rochester. They moved in 1904 to New York City, where he would remain, other than his many travels, until 1921. Here he continued work, which he had begun about two years earlier in Philadelphia, on his famous skyscraper paintings. Cooper said that he was \\"greatly interested in the skyscraper buildings in Broad Street. It was intensely interesting to watch the freakishness disappear from those queer towering structures in the glory of the right kind of light\\". He said that the painting which first brought him great success was 1902's Broad Street, New York; in 1903, this painting was honored with the W. T. Evans Award of the New York Watercolor Club. In another interview, he had stated that \\"one of the points that most strikes me about this view up Broad Street is the dramatic contrast between the old, low type of buildings ... and the great skyscrapers. My pictures are built on these contrasts.\\" In 1911, The New York Times, citing Cooper as the artist who best captured modern, towering structures on canvas, declared him to be \\"the skyscraper artist par excellence of America\\". In an article the following year, they stated that he was \\"one of the most interesting figures in American art\\", reiterating that \\"in his particular field he has no superior\\". In addition to New York City, his paintings often depict skyscrapers in Philadelphia and Chicago. Rescue of the Survivors of the Titanic by the Carpathia, 1912 Cooper's painting Fifth Avenue, New York was purchased by the French government for the Mus√©e du Luxembourg. Such an honor was quite rare for an American artist. Critics at the time, and up to the present, frequently compared the works of Cooper and Childe Hassam. They have often been credited as being the two most iconic artists whose paintings began a trend of celebrating the wonders of the modern city, especially New York City. Cooper may have intentionally avoided certain subjects in order to differentiate himself from Hassam. Hassam, unlike Cooper, did not concentrate on the tall buildings in his cityscapes. Cooper was as proficient painting in watercolors as he was in oils. He would often create a small watercolor study before painting a larger work of the same subject in oils. But the smaller watercolors were not mere sketches for his own use; they were finished pieces which he exhibited, sometimes years earlier than the larger corresponding oil paintings that he would ultimately produce. Cooper was elected to a prestigious membership in the National Academy of Design in 1912 (he had previously been elected an Associate, four years earlier). Palace of Fine Arts, San Francisco, c. 1915 He and his wife were aboard the RMS Carpathia during its rescue mission for the survivors from the sunken RMS Titanic on April 15, 1912. He assisted in the effort, and during the rescue operation, he created several paintings which document the events. The Coopers gave up their ship's cabin so some of the survivors would have berths to sleep in. Cooper exhibited in San Francisco's Panama‚ÄìPacific International Exposition of 1915, winning the gold medal for oil and the silver medal for watercolor. While there, he created a series of paintings depicting the exposition's buildings, including the Palace of Fine Arts. He also participated in the Panama‚ÄìCalifornia Exposition in San Diego in 1916. The Coopers spent the winter of 1915‚Äì16 in Los Angeles. This time in southern California was undoubtedly a key factor in Cooper's later decision to move there permanently. His wife Emma died of tuberculosis on July 30, 1920. =Santa Barbara= After his wife's death, Cooper moved to Santa Barbara, California in January 1921. Santa Barbara would be his home base for the rest of his life, spending two years in northern Europe and Tunisia. He became Dean of Painting at the Santa Barbara Community School of Arts. Terrace at Samarkand Hotel, c. 1923 Cooper said of his new environment: \\"I find Santa Barbara so conducive to the sort of things a painter most craves ‚Äì climate, flowers, mountains, seascapes, etc. ‚Äì with a community interest in all sorts of artistic matters that I am compensated, to a degree, for the isolation from that artistic universe of America.\\" But he hadn't abandoned that \\"artistic universe of America\\", New York City, as he continued to maintain a studio there for ten years after his move to California. Another aspect of his creativity became evident starting in the mid-1920s, as, perhaps influenced by his father's great love of literature, he began writing plays and books. His plays found their way in the 1920s and 1930 to theater companies in places such as Pasadena, Redlands, and Santa Fe, and were also produced at a theater which he founded in Santa Barbara, called The Strollers. In addition to the plays, he also wrote novels, illustrated books, and an autobiography entitled In These Old Days. In April 1927, he married his second wife, Marie Henriette Frehsee, in Arizona. Cooper continued to enjoy traveling, and kept painting until prevented from doing so by failing eyesight in his last years. He died in Santa Barbara on November 6, 1937, at the age of 81. In 1938 Santa Barbara's Faulkner Memorial Art Gallery paid tribute to Cooper's legacy by presenting a memorial exhibition of his work. Just several months before his death, however, Cooper initiated the effort to convert the abandoned post office building into an art museum in a letter to the editor of the Santa Barbara News-Press in July 1937. Just four years later that pipedream materialized into the Santa Barbara Museum of Art. Exhibitions Summer, 1918 Nocturnal Town Square a.k.a. European Plaza. Oil on board.

Porsche SE is headquartered in Zuffenhausen, a city district of Stuttgart, Baden-W√ºrttemberg and is majority owned, but fully controlled, by the Austrian Porsche and Pi√´ch families. The company was founded in Stuttgart as Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche GmbH in 1931 by Ferdinand Porsche (1875‚Äì1951) and his son-in-law Anton Pi√´ch (1894‚Äì1952). Corporate structure Porsche headquarters in Stuttgart, Germany Porsche SE was created in June 2007 by renaming the old Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche AG, and became a holding company for the families' stake in Porsche Zwischenholding GmbH (50.1%) (which in turn held 100% of the old Porsche AG) and currently is the major shareholder in Volkswagen AG (31.3%) and holds the majority voting rights (53.1%). At the same time, the new Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche AG (Porsche AG) was created for the car manufacturing business. In August 2009, Porsche SE and Volkswagen AG reached an agreement that the car manufacturing operations of the two companies would merge in 2011, to form an \\"Integrated Automotive Group\\". The management of Volkswagen AG agreed to 50.7% of Volkswagen AG being controlled by Porsche SE in return for Volkswagen AG management taking Porsche SE management positions (in order for Volkswagen management to remain in control), and for Volkswagen AG acquiring ownership of Porsche AG. As of 2019, the 31.3% stake in Volkswagen AG is the predominant investment by Porsche SE, and Volkswagen AG in turn controls brands and companies such as Volkswagen, Audi, SEAT, ≈†koda, Bentley, Bugatti, Lamborghini, Porsche AG, Ducati, VW Commercial Vehicles, Scania, MAN, as well as Volkswagen Financial Services. Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche AG (which stands for Doktor Ingenieur honoris causa Ferdinand Porsche Aktiengesellschaft), as a 100% subsidiary of Volkswagen AG, is responsible for the actual production and manufacture of the Porsche automobile line. =Subsidiaries= In addition to Volkswagen AG, other subsidiaries of Porsche SE include Porsche Engineering and Porsche Design Group. Porsche SE has an investment in the American traffic information provider INRIX on 10% stake. History =EU and the Volkswagen Law= Volkswagen and its principal factory (with the newly built town that hosted it, called Wolfsburg today) were designed by Ferdinand Porsche and his design office, and the factory with supporting town facilities were established by the German government then led by the National Socialist (Nazi) Party in 1937‚Äì1938. When the government-owned Volkswagenwerk GmbH was privatized in 1960 into Volkswagen AG (VW AG), the German parliament enacted the law known as Volkswagen Law to govern the privatization process. In order to maintain government control in the privately owned company, the law stipulated that the votes on major shareholder meeting resolutions would require 4/5th (80%) agreement. This effectively gave any shareholder with more than 20% ownership (the government of Lower Saxony held 20.1%) a veto of any resolution that is proposed. This not only secured government control, but also prevented the possibility of a hostile takeover in the future. When the European Union was founded in 1993, a European Union law was signed with the principle of promoting free movement of goods, people and capital within the Union. It became somewhat clear that the anti-takeover measure (the 80% agreement requirement) in Volkswagen Law would violate the European company law (as a part of the EU law), and it was feared that suitors would eventually be able to take over Volkswagen AG, as amendments to the German law and the bylaws of VW AG were seen to be likely. In late 2005, Porsche took an 18.65% stake in the Volkswagen Group, further cementing their relationship, and preventing a takeover of Volkswagen Group, which was rumoured at the time. Hypothetical suitors included DaimlerChrysler AG, BMW, and Renault. As of June 2006, the Porsche AG stake in VW AG had risen to 25.1%, giving Porsche the veto rights along with the government. On 26 March 2007, amidst the rumours that hedge funds were trying to takeover VW AG with the intent to dismantle and dispense the components of Volkswagen Group, Porsche took its holding of Volkswagen AG shares to 30.9%, triggering a takeover bid under German law which required other shareholders to be given the opportunity to sell the shares at least at the price paid by the new major shareholder. Porsche then formally announced in a press statement that it did not intend to take over Volkswagen Group (it would set its bid price at the lowest possible legal value) but intended to move to avoid a competitor taking a large stake. Porsche's move came after the European Union announced that it intends to take steps against the Volkswagen Law. In October 2007, the European Court of Justice ruled against the law, potentially paving the way for a takeover. On 16 September 2008, Porsche increased its holdings to 35.14%, in effect almost taking control of the company, with more than 35% of the voting rights. It again triggered a takeover bid, but this time over Audi AG. Porsche dismissed the bid as a mere formality, since it was Porsche's intention to keep the corporate structure of the Volkswagen Group. In October 2008, Porsche SE announced its intent to raise its stake in Volkswagen AG to 75% during 2009, and on 7 January 2009, Porsche SE's holding in VW AG was raised to 50.76%. At 75% ownership level, Porsche SE would have been able to bring VW AG's cash position onto Porsche SE books. Porsche's move automatically triggered a bid for Scania AB, because VW AG already had a controlling position in the Swedish truck-maker. As Porsche had no strategic interest in Scania, they offered the minimum price in that mandatory takeover bid on 19 January 2009. There has been some tension and anxiety among the VW AG management and the workers, who feared that Porsche might replace the management after the takeover, and it may signify a hardened production efficiency control, rejection of demands for pay rises or even personnel cuts. Ferdinand Pi√´ch (Chairman of VW AG) and his cousin, Wolfgang Porsche (Chairman of Porsche SE), also seemed to be on a collision course. However, on 13 August 2009, Volkswagen AG's Supervisory Board signed the agreement to create an \\"integrated automotive group\\" with Porsche AG, led by Volkswagen AG. Volkswagen would initially take a 49.9 percent stake in Porsche AG by the end of 2009, and it would also see the Porsche family shareholders selling the VW distributor ownership of Porsche Holding Salzburg to Volkswagen AG, which is the largest car distributor in Europe. On 5 July 2012, Volkswagen AG announced a deal with Porsche SE, resulting in VW's full ownership of Porsche AG on 1 August 2012. The deal was classified as a restructuring rather than a takeover due to the transfer of a single share as part of the deal. Volkswagen AG paid Porsche AG shareholders $5.61 billion for the remaining 50.1% it did not own. The families later used the amounts they received for Porsche AG and the dealership shares to buy back the Porsche SE shares from Qatar Investment Authority as described in the following section. In October 2013, the EU Court of Justice ruled that a redraft of the Volkswagen law \\"complied in full\\" with EU rules, bringing \\"the matter to a close,\\" as the 80% agreement requirement was taken off. This officially made Porsche SE the controlling owner of Volkswagen AG. =Corporate restructuring= Porsche reformed the company's structure, with Dr Ing. h. c. F. Porsche AG becoming a holding company, renamed \\"Porsche Automobil Holding SE\\", and a new Dr Ing. h. c. F. Porsche AG operating company being formed in 2007. Thus the operating activities are separated from holding activities of the company. There was an Extraordinary General Meeting for Porsche AG shareholders which took place on 26 June 2007, at the Porsche Arena in Stuttgart, Germany to discuss the change to the company structure. By March 2009, Porsche SE was aiming for its first ever credit ratings from U.S. rating agencies Standard & Poor's and Moody's. In its process to acquire a majority holding in Volkswagen AG, Porsche SE built up a large debt burden, aggravated by taxes due on very large paper profits on Volkswagen AG options. By July 2009, Porsche SE was faced with debts exceeding 10 billion euros. The supervisory board of Porsche SE finally agreed to a number of arrangements whereby the Qatar Investment Authority would inject a large amount of capital into Porsche SE, and Porsche automobile manufacturing business would be merged with Volkswagen Group. On 23 July 2009, Michael Macht was appointed CEO of Porsche AG, to replace Wendelin Wiedeking, who was expected to receive a compensation package of 50 million euros. In July 2010, Porsche AG appointed Volkswagen executive Matthias M√ºller to its new CEO position, moving Michael Macht to another executive position within Volkswagen AG. In July 2012, it was announced that Volkswagen AG was taking over the Porsche AG automotive company completely, which bears the same name, but is only a subsidiary of Porsche SE. In June 2013, Qatar Holdings, through the Qatar Investment Authority, sold its 10% holding in Porsche SE back to the founding family, giving them 100% voting rights in the holding company. Porsche SE currently owns 50.73% of the voting rights in Volkswagen AG as the largest (controlling) shareholder.

It was initially founded in January 1986 under the title Lebanese Forces ‚Äì Uprising or LFU (Arabic: ÿßŸÑŸÇŸàÿßÿ™ ÿßŸÑŸÑÿ®ŸÜÿßŸÜŸäÿ© - ÿßŸÑÿßŸÜÿ™ŸÅÿßÿ∂ÿ© Al-Quwwat al-Lubnaniyya ‚Äì Intifada), but later changed its designation.  Origins  The LFU was formed by Hobeika at Zahl√© out of his LF supporters, who sought refuge in the Syrian-controlled Beqaa after being ousted from east Beirut in January 1986 by the Lebanese Forces' faction led by Samir Geagea. Renamed Lebanese Forces ‚Äì Executive Command later that year and financed by Syria, Hobeika and its men conveyed little or no support at all from the Greek-Catholic citizens of Zahl√©, who preferred to lend their backing to the mainstream Lebanese Forces and later, to General Michel Aoun's interim military government.  Structure and organization  Initially numbering just 600-700 fighters,Makdisi and Sadaka, The Lebanese Civil War, 1975-1990 (2003), p. 44, Table 1: War Period Militias. the LFEC by the late 1980s aligned some 1,000 militiamen, mostly Maronites, of which 300 operated in West Beirut whilst the remainder were kept in reserve at Zahl√©. Apart from a few technicals equipped with heavy machine-guns, recoilless rifles and anti-aircraft autocannons, the militia had no armoured vehicles nor artillery of their own but usually relied on the Syrian Army's 82nd Armoured Brigade stationed at the Beqaa for armour and artillery support. List of LFEC Commanders *Elie Hobeika *Georges Melko *Maroun Machahalani *Michel Zouen  Illegal activities and controversy  Generally regarded as a pro- Syrian proxy faction, the LFEC became known for their lack of restraint and discipline, and involvement in profitable criminal activities ‚Äì besides allowing his men to abduct and rape many of the local women, Hobeika ran from his Headquarters at the Hotel Qadiri in central Zahl√© an illegal international telecommunications' center and a drug-trafficking ring that extended through the Beqaa Valley. The group is suspected of being implicated in a series of bloody bomb attacks in the mid-1980s, namely the failed attempt made alongside the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army (SLA) to assassinate Sheikh Hussein Fadlallah of Hezbollah, which cost the life of his brother Jihad Fadlallah in March 1985 by a massive car-bomb explosion that also caused other 83 dead and 256 wounded.O'Ballance, Civil War in Lebanon (1998), p. 155.Palmer Harik, Hezbollah: The Changing Face of Terrorism (2004), p. 37.Qassem, Hizbullah: The Story from Within (2005), p. 99. The subsequent car-bomb campaign that plagued both West and East Beirut from March to July 1986 was allegedly carried out by the LFEC in collusion with the Syrian military intelligence services. The LFEC in the Lebanese civil war 1986-1990 During the 1988‚Äì1990 Liberation War they fought alongside Druze Progressive Socialist Party's People's Liberation Army (PSP/PLA) and pro-Syrian Palestinian militias against General Michel Aoun's troops at the second battle of Souk El Gharb.Micheletti and Debay, Victoire a Souk El Gharb ‚Äì la 10e Brigade sauve le Liban, RAIDS magazine (1989), pp. 18-24.Barak, The Lebanese Army ‚Äì A National institution in a divided society (2009), p. 159. They later assisted Syrian Social Nationalist Party (SSNP) militiamen and Syrian troops in the capture of Aoun's HQ at Baabda on October 13, 1990, where they fought successfully the Aounist 5th Infantry Brigade defending it, and reportedly committed atrocities and engaged in looting.  Disbandment  Upon the end of the war in October 1990, LFEC militia units operating in Beirut and Zahl√© were ordered by the Lebanese Government on March 28, 1991 to disband and surrender their heavy weaponry by April 30 as stipulated by the Taif Agreement.Barak, The Lebanese Army ‚Äì A National institution in a divided society (2009), p. 173. Although the LFEC was indeed disbanded, many of its former members went to provide the cadre for a private security company set up and headed by Hobeika until his death by a mysterious car bomb explosion near his house in the east Beirut suburb of Hazmiyeh on January 24, 2002.Mostyn, Trevor, The Guardian, 25 January 2002 The LFEC is no longer active.

Citizens can propose laws via referendums at the national and local levels. The Referendum Act also allowed people to make changes or abolish laws by referendums. History While the rights of initiatives and referendums are mentioned in the Three Principles of the People and Chapter 9, Article 136 of the Constitution of 1947, a law pertaining specifically to referendums was not enacted until 2003. The Referendum Act was promoted by Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) politicians such as Chai Trong-rong, Lin Yi-hsiung, Yeh Chu-lan, Lu Hsiu-yi, Lin Cho-shui, and the Chen Shui-bian- Annette Lu administration. While both citizens of Taiwan and the Legislative Yuan can initiate the referendum process, the Pan-Blue Coalition held a legislative majority at the time of the act's promulgation, and set an extremely high bar to prevent its application.Ê∞ëÈÄ≤Èª®ÂÆåÊàêÂÖ¨Ê∞ëÊäïÁ•®Ê≥ïËçâÊ°à, Taiwan Television News, 1993/3/14President defends nation's right to hold referendums, Taipei Times, 2003/8/15Taiwan referendum bill sets stage, BBC, 2003/11/28Vote to push for status quo, Chen says, Taipei Times, 2003/12/5Concert held to commemorate DPP's Chai Trong-rong, Taipei Times, 2014/2/19Ë™∞‰∏ªÂ∞é‰∫ÜÂÖ®‰∏ñÁïåÊúÄËêΩ‰ºçÁöÑÈ≥•Á±†ÂºèÂÖ¨ÊäïÊ≥ïÔºü, Taiwan People News, 2014-5-6 No national referendum question had reached the majority support quota until 2018, when seven questions were approved as part of a ten- question referendum.

The first round proposal threshold for national and local referendums were cut from 0.1 to 0.01 percent of the electorate in the most recent presidential election, and the second tier proposal threshold for referendums was lowered from 5 to 1.5 percent of the electorate. Additionally, referendums will be declared passed if a majority of voters vote for propositions, and the number of agreeing votes reaches 25 percent of the electorate, instead of 50 percent.Art. 29 of the referendum law Several amendments to the Referendum Act were proposed in June 2019, among them a requirement for voters to provide a photocopy of their National Identification Card when voting on referendums. An amendment to separate election years from referendum years was passed, and will take effect in August 2021. The same amendment also limited referendum voting to every two years, and mandated a specific date for the vote, the fourth Saturday in August, putting the next referendum on 28 August 2021.  National referendums  =Referendums = There have been sixteen national referendums in Taiwan.

However, the referendum results were invalidated each time due to low turnout rate. According to the Referendum Law, 50% turnout of qualified voters is required for the referendum to be valid. The threshold has yet to be reached, as the Kuomintang asked its supporters to boycott each referendum. Therefore, the removal of the turnout restriction in the referendum law has been proposed.ÊâìÁ†¥È≥•Á±†ÂÖ¨Êäï ÈÑ≠È∫óÂêõÊèê‰øÆÊ≠£Ê°à, Liberty Times, 2016-03-04 Several provisions regarding turnout were amended by the Legislative Yuan in December 2017.

The Kuomintang legislative caucus moved to reduce turnout restrictions so the food import ban could be considered via referendum, but the proposal did not pass.  Local referendums  From 1990 to 2003, sixteen local referendums were called. Since the Referendum Act passed, four local referendums have been held as of 2016.

It was replaced on 1 May 2011 by the Financial Markets Authority. It was responsible for enforcement, monitoring and market oversight of the securities markets, authorising participants and promoting public understanding of investments. This included authorising the New Zealand Stock Exchange with which it ran a co-regulatory model. On 27 April 2010 the New Zealand minister for commerce Simon Power announced that Securities Commission would be replaced by a new integrated financial regulator the Financial Markets Authority. History The Commission was first established under the Securities Act 1978 which determines its powers and functions. The commissions role was modified and extended by a number of additional pieces of legislation. These include the Securities Markets Act 1988, the Investment Advisers (Disclosure) Act 1996, the Securities Regulations 1983, the Securities Act (Contributory Mortgage) Regulations 1988, and the Securities (Fees) Regulations 1998. The Financial Advisers Act 2008 gave the Securities Commission new responsibilities to register and set minimum standards for financial advisers. There was some concern that the commission did not have the resources to effectively carry out its responsibilitiesSecurities Commission needs staff, money and IT and that this additional responsibility would make the situation worse. The agency was chaired by Jane Diplock from 2001 until it was disbanded in 2011 and faced criticism for its handling of the collapse of a large number of finance companies. Jane Diplock was also the chairperson of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) during her time as chairperson of the Securities Commission. Responsibilities and functions The Securities Commission undertook the following roles: * Enforcement, monitoring and market oversight * Law reform * Exemptions * Authorisations * International co-operation and * Promoting public understanding Notable cases * In May 1993 the Commission published a very extensive report on the manipulation of reported profits by the largely Government owned Bank of New Zealand. \\"Arrangements\\" to make the manipulation look valid were put in place in March 1988 but in the event they were not used until the Banks 1990 year when the Bank's profit was overstated by $55m. * In June 2007, Michael Fay and David Richwhite through one of the companies that they co-owned, Midavia Rail Investments, paid $20 million to the commission to settle insider trading proceedings relating to Tranz Rail. In October 2004 the commission accused Midavia of insider trading and Richwhite of tipping off Midavia to sell $63 million worth of shares while knowing Tranz Rail was facing financial problems, which was not known to the public. The commission noted that the payments had been made \\"without any admission of liability\\". *On 11 November 2007 the NZ Securities Commission issued a report into two matters concerning Feltex Carpets Ltd which by then had gone into liquidation with the probable loss of all shareholders funds. The first matter was an Initial Public Offer made in April 2004 by which a sole shareholder sold all its shares to the public for about $250m. The report declared that this IPO was not misleading in any material particular. Nevertheless over three thousand of the eight thousand subscribers to this IPO have taken legal action against various parties associated with making the offering on the grounds that the offering was misleading. The High Court (Houghton v Saunders) found against the shareholders and as at April 2016 the matter is being considered by the Court of Appeal. :In the second matter the Securities Commission reported that Feltex had overstated the length of tenure of most of its extensive bank debt in its half yearly report to 31 December 2005. The Ministry of Economic Development took legal action against five of the Feltex directors as a result of this Securities Commission report but in MED v Feeney Judge M Doogue dismissed the charges. Judge Doogue specialised in family court matters. Less than a year after this judgement she was promoted to Chief District Court Judge. * On 20 June 2010, the Securities Commission put the finance company South Canterbury Finance which was run by Allan Hubbard into statutory management after complaints from a number of investors. This also triggered an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office (New Zealand). Eight weeks later on 31 August 2010, South Canterbury Finance was placed in receivership. * In late 2010, the Securities Commission successfully applied to the High Court to have the assets of former director of finance company Hanover Finance, Mark Hotchin frozen.

The snagboat W. T. Preston (retired) The snagboat Mandan seen from a bluff overlooking the Missouri River (July 1912). A snagboat is a river boat, resembling a barge with superstructure for crew accommodations, and deck- mounted cranes and hoists for removing snags and other obstructions from rivers and other shallow waterways. During the American Civil War, when much of the naval fighting was done on rivers and their tributaries, numerous snagboats were in operation. , for example, was a commercial snagboat quickly converted by the Union Army to a river gunboat when the American Civil War broke out. In Canada, many of the rivers of British Columbia were maintained and kept open for navigation by federal Department of Public Works snagboats. On the Fraser River, in southern British Columbia, a series of sternwheeler snagboats named Samson were operated by the Canadian Federal Government from the early 1880s until the retirement of final vessel in the series, the Samson V in 1980. The Samson V is now preserved as a museum on the waterfront of New Westminster, B.C. and was the last steam -powered sternwheeler to operate in Canada. In northern British Columbia, Department of Public Works snagboats operated out of Prince Rupert and cleared the waters of the Nass, Ecstall, and Skeena rivers. The snag-clearance service was mainly important on the Fraser River because of the large amount of marine traffic. Passenger and freight- carrying sternwheelers operated out of New Westminster from 1859 until the early 1920s. These lightly built vessels were vulnerable to the woody debris and drift logs that would wash down the river with every spring freshet. After the 1920s, most of the traffic on the Fraser was tug and barge service along with deep sea shipping in the lower reaches of the river, and a greater portion of the snagboat's assignments was in maintenance of government docks and aids to navigation. In northern British Columbia, as on the Fraser River, a major part of the snagboat service provided by the Canadian federal government was in support of the gillnet salmon-fishing industry and the canneries that were built in and around the estuaries of the major rivers. Huge amounts of timber debris would wash down-river every year creating hazards for fishermen and destroying nets.

He was bred by his lifelong owner Art Pollard of Sonoita, Arizona, and was the offspring of Three Bars, a Thoroughbred, and Della P, a Quarter Horse mare from Louisiana, then noted for the breeding of sprint horses. Lightning Bar raced ten times, achieving four victories and four other top three finishes. His racing career was cut short by illness after only one year, following which he spent two years as a show horse. As a breeding stallion he sired seven crops, or years, of foals, among whom Doc Bar was the best known. In 1960 Lightning Bar died of an intestinal infection at the age of nine. He was inducted into the American Quarter Horse Association's (AQHA) Hall of Fame in 2008. Early life Foaled, or born, in 1951, Lightning Bar was bred to be a race horse, but injuries and bouts of illnesses kept him from racing past the age of two. His breeder, Art Pollard, owned him for the horse's entire life.American Quarter Horse Association (AQHA) Official Get of Sire Record for Lightning Bar. Lightning Bar was sired by Three Bars, a Thoroughbred stallion later inducted into the AQHA Hall of Fame. His dam was Della P, a daughter of the Thoroughbred stallion Doc Horn. His second dam, or maternal grandmother, was a mare who was never given a name, sired by Old D. J. Art Pollard purchased Della P from \\"Dink\\" Parker for $1,750 (approximately $ as of ) in the late 1940s. Della P was bred in Louisiana, a leader in breeding short distance racehorses between 1900 and 1940,Denhardt Quarter Horses p. 55. and was taken to Arizona by Parker.Simmons \\"Lightning Bar\\" Legends 2 p. 143. When Lightning Bar was about five days old Pollard was afraid that he had leg problems and was buck-kneed, and considered putting the colt to sleep. He sought Parker's advice, and as Pollard later related the story, \\"Dink just looked at me and shook his head. 'Ain't you ever gonna learn nothing? That colt's just what you're looking for.' \\"Simmons \\"Lightning Bar\\" Legends 2 p. 145. When mature, the sorrel-colored Lightning Bar stood tall and weighed about .

Among those finishes, he ran second and third in two stakes races, a type of race for higher quality horses with a higher payout.Price and Shiers Lyons Press Horseman's Dictionary p. 200. His total earnings on the track were $1,491 (approximately $ as of ), and his highest speed index, or comparative rating of his speed, was AAA, the highest achievable at the time.Wagoner Quarter Racing Digest p.

He equalled one track record for two-year-olds at the Los Angeles County Fair race meeting in Pomona, California, running in 17.2 seconds.Simmons \\"Lightning Bar\\" Legends 2 p. 146. After his racing career Lightning Bar went on to become a show horse, earning 18 open halter points with the AQHA, and an AQHA Champion award in 1955. He won one grand championship and one reserve championship in halter classes at recognized AQHA shows. Breeding career The first year Lightning Bar stood as a breeding stallion his stud fee, the amount charged to breed a mare to him, was $250 (approximately $ as of ) but only nine mares were bred to him. The next year, he bred 11 mares, but in 1956, he bred 102 mares at $500 (approximately $ as of ) each. One of Pollard's attempts to advertise his stallion involved letting one of his ranch hands take the horse to a local jackpot roping. Pollard assumed that the hand would just ride Lightning Bar around and show him off, but he later discovered that more was involved. Pollard said later that \\"I should have been suspicious when he (the ranch hand) returned with Lightning Bar that afternoon, with a sheepish grin on his face. I asked him how the horse was received and he said 'The stud did good and I won the jackpot!' After congratulating him, I asked which rope horse he had used. He replied, 'The stud.' \\"Simmons \\"Lightning Bar\\" Legends 2 p. 147. Pollard said of Lightning Bar that \\"I always had to be careful about the kind of latch I used on a gate with that horse. He could figure them out faster than I could. He would open a gate, and go for a stroll.\\" Lightning Bar sired 148 foals in his eight breeding seasons, and 118 of those foals went on to either race or show careers. Of his foals, 108 started races, and 77 won, earning a total of $476,949. The most successful of his foals, Lightning Belle, earned $60,134 (approximately $ as of ). Five of Lightning Bar's foals earned AQHA Championships: Cactus Comet, Crash Bang, Lightning Rey, Pana Bar and Relampago Bar; Lightning Rey earned a Supreme Championship. In addition, Lightning Bar's offspring earned $1,163.32 in National Cutting Horse Association sanctioned cattle cutting competitions, and four earned a Superior Halter Horse title from the AQHA.Pitzer Most Influential Quarter Horse Sires p. 72. Death and legacy Lightning Bar died in June 1960 from colitis-X, a disease of unknown origin that can kill rapidly and without warning.Belknap Horsewords p. 113. It infected many of Pollard's horses; of those affected only three survived. Heartbroken, Pollard sold his remaining stock and did not return to the Quarter Horse business for 15 years. He said later that \\"it was a nightmare when they were wiped out. Even now, we can still feel the sadness of losing those horses.\\"Simmons \\"Lightning Bar\\" Legends 2 p. 149. Another time, Pollard remarked that \\"Someone once said that a man deserves one good woman and one good dog in his lifetime. To that quip I would add one good horse.

Physical, chemical, and biological processes are used to remove contaminants and produce treated wastewater (or treated effluent) that is safe enough for release into the environment. A by-product of sewage treatment is a semi-solid waste or slurry, called sewage sludge. The sludge has to undergo further treatment before being suitable for disposal or application to land. Sewage treatment may also be referred to as wastewater treatment. However, the latter is a broader term which can also refer to industrial wastewater. For most cities, the sewer system will also carry a proportion of industrial effluent to the sewage treatment plant which has usually received pre- treatment at the factories themselves to reduce the pollutant load. If the sewer system is a combined sewer then it will also carry urban runoff (stormwater) to the sewage treatment plant. Sewage water can travel towards treatment plants via piping and in a flow aided by gravity and pumps. The first part of filtration of sewage typically includes a bar screen to filter solids and large objects which are then collected in dumpsters and disposed of in landfills. Fat and grease is also removed before the primary treatment of sewage. Terminology The term \\"sewage treatment plant\\" (or \\"sewage treatment works\\" in some countries) is nowadays often replaced with the term wastewater treatment plant or wastewater treatment station. Sewage can be treated close to where the sewage is created, which may be called a \\"decentralized\\" system or even an \\"on-site\\" system (in septic tanks, biofilters or aerobic treatment systems). Alternatively, sewage can be collected and transported by a network of pipes and pump stations to a municipal treatment plant. This is called a \\"centralized\\" system (see also sewerage and pipes and infrastructure). Origins of sewage Sewage is generated by residential, institutional, commercial and industrial establishments. It includes household waste liquid from toilets, baths, showers, kitchens, and sinks draining into sewers. In many areas, sewage also includes liquid waste from industry and commerce. The separation and draining of household waste into greywater and blackwater is becoming more common in the developed world, with treated greywater being permitted for use for watering plants or recycled for flushing toilets. =Sewage mixing with rainwater= Sewage may include stormwater runoff or urban runoff. Sewerage systems capable of handling storm water are known as combined sewer systems. This design was common when urban sewerage systems were first developed, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Combined sewers require much larger and more expensive treatment facilities than sanitary sewers. Heavy volumes of storm runoff may overwhelm the sewage treatment system, causing a spill or overflow. Sanitary sewers are typically much smaller than combined sewers, and they are not designed to transport stormwater. Backups of raw sewage can occur if excessive infiltration/inflow (dilution by stormwater and/or groundwater) is allowed into a sanitary sewer system. Communities that have urbanized in the mid-20th century or later generally have built separate systems for sewage (sanitary sewers) and stormwater, because precipitation causes widely varying flows, reducing sewage treatment plant efficiency.Burrian, Steven J., et al. (1999). \\"The Historical Development of Wet-Weather Flow Management.\\" US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). National Risk Management Research Laboratory, Cincinnati, OH. Document No. EPA/600/JA-99/275. As rainfall travels over roofs and the ground, it may pick up various contaminants including soil particles and other sediment, heavy metals, organic compounds, animal waste, and oil and grease. Some jurisdictions require stormwater to receive some level of treatment before being discharged directly into waterways. Examples of treatment processes used for stormwater include retention basins, wetlands, buried vaults with various kinds of media filters, and vortex separators (to remove coarse solids). =Industrial effluent= In highly regulated developed countries, industrial effluent usually receives at least pretreatment if not full treatment at the factories themselves to reduce the pollutant load, before discharge to the sewer. This process is called industrial wastewater treatment or pretreatment. The same does not apply to many developing countries where industrial effluent is more likely to enter the sewer if it exists, or even the receiving water body, without pretreatment. Industrial wastewater may contain pollutants which cannot be removed by conventional sewage treatment. Also, variable flow of industrial waste associated with production cycles may upset the population dynamics of biological treatment units, such as the activated sludge process. Process steps = Overview = Sewage collection and treatment in the United States is typically subject to local, state and federal regulations and standards. Treating wastewater has the aim to produce an effluent that will do as little harm as possible when discharged to the surrounding environment, thereby preventing pollution compared to releasing untreated wastewater into the environment. Sewage treatment generally involves three stages, called primary, secondary and tertiary treatment. * Primary treatment consists of temporarily holding the sewage in a quiescent basin where heavy solids can settle to the bottom while oil, grease and lighter solids float to the surface. The settled and floating materials are removed and the remaining liquid may be discharged or subjected to secondary treatment. Some sewage treatment plants that are connected to a combined sewer system have a bypass arrangement after the primary treatment unit. This means that during very heavy rainfall events, the secondary and tertiary treatment systems can be bypassed to protect them from hydraulic overloading, and the mixture of sewage and stormwater only receives primary treatment. * Secondary treatment removes dissolved and suspended biological matter. Secondary treatment is typically performed by indigenous, water-borne micro-organisms in a managed habitat. Secondary treatment may require a separation process to remove the micro-organisms from the treated water prior to discharge or tertiary treatment. * Tertiary treatment is sometimes defined as anything more than primary and secondary treatment in order to allow ejection into a highly sensitive or fragile ecosystem (estuaries, low-flow rivers, coral reefs...). Treated water is sometimes disinfected chemically or physically (for example, by lagoons and microfiltration) prior to discharge into a stream, river, bay, lagoon or wetland, or it can be used for the irrigation of a golf course, greenway or park. If it is sufficiently clean, it can also be used for groundwater recharge or agricultural purposes. Simplified process flow diagram for a typical large-scale treatment plant Process flow diagram for a typical treatment plant via subsurface flow constructed wetlands (SFCW) =Pretreatment= Pretreatment removes all materials that can be easily collected from the raw sewage before they damage or clog the pumps and sewage lines of primary treatment clarifiers. Objects commonly removed during pretreatment include trash, tree limbs, leaves, branches, and other large objects. The influent in sewage water passes through a bar screen to remove all large objects like cans, rags, sticks, plastic packets etc. carried in the sewage stream.Water and Environmental Health at London and Loughborough (1999). \\"Waste water Treatment Options.\\" Technical brief no. 64. London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and Loughborough University. This is most commonly done with an automated mechanically raked bar screen in modern plants serving large populations, while in smaller or less modern plants, a manually cleaned screen may be used. The raking action of a mechanical bar screen is typically paced according to the accumulation on the bar screens and/or flow rate. The solids are collected and later disposed in a landfill, or incinerated. Bar screens or mesh screens of varying sizes may be used to optimize solids removal. If gross solids are not removed, they become entrained in pipes and moving parts of the treatment plant, and can cause substantial damage and inefficiency in the process.EPA. Washington, DC (2004). \\"Primer for Municipal Waste water Treatment Systems.\\" Document no. EPA 832-R-04-001. Grit removal Grit consists of sand, gravel, cinders, and other heavy materials. It also includes organic matter such as eggshells, bone chips, seeds, and coffee grounds. Pretreatment may include a sand or grit channel or chamber, where the velocity of the incoming sewage is adjusted to allow the settlement of sand and grit. Grit removal is necessary to (1) reduce formation of heavy deposits in aeration tanks, aerobic digesters, pipelines, channels, and conduits; (2) reduce the frequency of digester cleaning caused by excessive accumulations of grit; and (3) protect moving mechanical equipment from abrasion and accompanying abnormal wear. The removal of grit is essential for equipment with closely machined metal surfaces such as comminutors, fine screens, centrifuges, heat exchangers, and high pressure diaphragm pumps. Grit chambers come in 3 types: horizontal grit chambers, aerated grit chambers and vortex grit chambers. Vortex type grit chambers include mechanically induced vortex, hydraulically induced vortex, and multi- tray vortex separators. Given that traditionally, grit removal systems have been designed to remove clean inorganic particles that are greater than , most grit passes through the grit removal flows under normal conditions. During periods of high flow deposited grit is resuspended and the quantity of grit reaching the treatment plant increases substantially. It is, therefore important that the grit removal system not only operate efficiently during normal flow conditions but also under sustained peak flows when the greatest volume of grit reaches the plant. Flow equalization Clarifiers and mechanized secondary treatment are more efficient under uniform flow conditions. Equalization basins may be used for temporary storage of diurnal or wet-weather flow peaks. Basins provide a place to temporarily hold incoming sewage during plant maintenance and a means of diluting and distributing batch discharges of toxic or high-strength waste which might otherwise inhibit biological secondary treatment (including portable toilet waste, vehicle holding tanks, and septic tank pumpers). Flow equalization basins require variable discharge control, typically include provisions for bypass and cleaning, and may also include aerators. Cleaning may be easier if the basin is downstream of screening and grit removal. Fat and grease removal In some larger plants, fat and grease are removed by passing the sewage through a small tank where skimmers collect the fat floating on the surface. Air blowers in the base of the tank may also be used to help recover the fat as a froth. Many plants, however, use primary clarifiers with mechanical surface skimmers for fat and grease removal. =Primary treatment= Primary treatment tanks in Oregon, USA In the primary sedimentation stage, sewage flows through large tanks, commonly called \\"pre-settling basins\\", \\"primary sedimentation tanks\\" or \\"primary clarifiers\\".Huber Company, Berching, Germany (2012). \\"Sedimentation Tanks.\\" The tanks are used to settle sludge while grease and oils rise to the surface and are skimmed off. Primary settling tanks are usually equipped with mechanically driven scrapers that continually drive the collected sludge towards a hopper in the base of the tank where it is pumped to sludge treatment facilities. Grease and oil from the floating material can sometimes be recovered for saponification (soap making). =Secondary treatment= Secondary clarifier at a rural treatment plant Secondary treatment is designed to substantially degrade the biological content of the sewage which are derived from human waste, food waste, soaps and detergent. The majority of municipal plants treat the settled sewage liquor using aerobic biological processes. To be effective, the biota require both oxygen and food to live. The bacteria and protozoa consume biodegradable soluble organic contaminants (e.g. sugars, fats, organic short-chain carbon molecules) and bind much of the less soluble fractions into floc. Secondary treatment systems are classified as fixed-film or suspended-growth systems. * Fixed-film or attached growth systems include trickling filters, constructed wetlands, bio-towers, and rotating biological contactors, where the biomass grows on media and the sewage passes over its surface. The fixed-film principle has further developed into moving bed biofilm reactors (MBBR) and Integrated Fixed-Film Activated Sludge (IFAS) processes. An MBBR system typically requires a smaller footprint than suspended-growth systems. Brochure. * Suspended-growth systems include activated sludge, where the biomass is mixed with the sewage and can be operated in a smaller space than trickling filters that treat the same amount of water. However, fixed-film systems are more able to cope with drastic changes in the amount of biological material and can provide higher removal rates for organic material and suspended solids than suspended growth systems. Some secondary treatment methods include a secondary clarifier to settle out and separate biological floc or filter material grown in the secondary treatment bioreactor. =Tertiary treatment= A sewage treatment plant and lagoon in Everett, Washington, USA The purpose of tertiary treatment is to provide a final treatment stage to further improve the effluent quality before it is discharged to the receiving environment (sea, river, lake, wet lands, ground, etc.). More than one tertiary treatment process may be used at any treatment plant. If disinfection is practised, it is always the final process. It is also called \\"effluent polishing\\". Filtration Sand filtration removes much of the residual suspended matter. Filtration over activated carbon, also called carbon adsorption, removes residual toxins. Lagoons or ponds Settlement and further biological improvement of wastewater may be achieved through storage in large man-made ponds or lagoons. These lagoons are highly aerobic and colonization by native macrophytes, especially reeds, is often encouraged. Small filter-feeding invertebrates such as Daphnia and species of Rotifera greatly assist in treatment by removing fine particulates. Biological nutrient removal Nitrification process tank Biological nutrient removal (BNR) is regarded by some as a type of secondary treatment process, and by others as a tertiary (or \\"advanced\\") treatment process. Wastewater may contain high levels of the nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus. Excessive release to the environment can lead to a buildup of nutrients, called eutrophication, which can in turn encourage the overgrowth of weeds, algae, and cyanobacteria (blue-green algae). This may cause an algal bloom, a rapid growth in the population of algae. The algae numbers are unsustainable and eventually most of them die. The decomposition of the algae by bacteria uses up so much of the oxygen in the water that most or all of the animals die, which creates more organic matter for the bacteria to decompose. In addition to causing deoxygenation, some algal species produce toxins that contaminate drinking water supplies. Different treatment processes are required to remove nitrogen and phosphorus. =Nitrogen removal= Nitrogen is removed through the biological oxidation of nitrogen from ammonia to nitrate (nitrification), followed by denitrification, the reduction of nitrate to nitrogen gas. Nitrogen gas is released to the atmosphere and thus removed from the water. Nitrification itself is a two-step aerobic process, each step facilitated by a different type of bacteria. The oxidation of ammonia (NH3) to nitrite (NO2‚àí) is most often facilitated by Nitrosomonas spp. (\\"nitroso\\" referring to the formation of a nitroso functional group). Nitrite oxidation to nitrate (NO3‚àí), though traditionally believed to be facilitated by Nitrobacter spp. (nitro referring the formation of a nitro functional group), is now known to be facilitated in the environment almost exclusively by Nitrospira spp. Denitrification requires anoxic conditions to encourage the appropriate biological communities to form. It is facilitated by a wide diversity of bacteria. Sand filters, lagooning and reed beds can all be used to reduce nitrogen, but the activated sludge process (if designed well) can do the job the most easily. Since denitrification is the reduction of nitrate to dinitrogen (molecular nitrogen) gas, an electron donor is needed. This can be, depending on the waste water, organic matter (from feces), sulfide, or an added donor like methanol. The sludge in the anoxic tanks (denitrification tanks) must be mixed well (mixture of recirculated mixed liquor, return activated sludge [RAS], and raw influent) e.g. by using submersible mixers in order to achieve the desired denitrification. Sometimes the conversion of toxic ammonia to nitrate alone is referred to as tertiary treatment. Over time, different treatment configurations have evolved as denitrification has become more sophisticated. An initial scheme, the Ludzack‚ÄìEttinger Process, placed an anoxic treatment zone before the aeration tank and clarifier, using the return activated sludge (RAS) from the clarifier as a nitrate source. Influent wastewater (either raw or as effluent from primary clarification) serves as the electron source for the facultative bacteria to metabolize carbon, using the inorganic nitrate as a source of oxygen instead of dissolved molecular oxygen. This denitrification scheme was naturally limited to the amount of soluble nitrate present in the RAS. Nitrate reduction was limited because RAS rate is limited by the performance of the clarifier. The \\"Modified Ludzak‚ÄìEttinger Process\\" (MLE) is an improvement on the original concept, for it recycles mixed liquor from the discharge end of the aeration tank to the head of the anoxic tank to provide a consistent source of soluble nitrate for the facultative bacteria. In this instance, raw wastewater continues to provide the electron source, and sub-surface mixing maintains the bacteria in contact with both electron source and soluble nitrate in the absence of dissolved oxygen. Many sewage treatment plants use centrifugal pumps to transfer the nitrified mixed liquor from the aeration zone to the anoxic zone for denitrification. These pumps are often referred to as Internal Mixed Liquor Recycle (IMLR) pumps. IMLR may be 200% to 400% the flow rate of influent wastewater (Q). This is in addition to Return Activated Sludge (RAS) from secondary clarifiers, which may be 100% of Q. (Therefore, the hydraulic capacity of the tanks in such a system should handle at least 400% of annual average design flow (AADF). At times, the raw or primary effluent wastewater must be carbon-supplemented by the addition of methanol, acetate, or simple food waste (molasses, whey, plant starch) to improve the treatment efficiency. These carbon additions should be accounted for in the design of a treatment facility's organic loading. Further modifications to the MLE were to come: Bardenpho and Biodenipho processes include additional anoxic and oxidative processes to further polish the conversion of nitrate ion to molecular nitrogen gas. Use of an anaerobic tank following the initial anoxic process allows for luxury uptake of phosphorus by bacteria, thereby biologically reducing orthophosphate ion in the treated wastewater. Even newer improvements, such as Anammox Process, interrupt the formation of nitrate at the nitrite stage of nitrification, shunting nitrite-rich mixed liquor activated sludge to treatment where nitrite is then converted to molecular nitrogen gas, saving energy, alkalinity, and secondary carbon sourcing. Anammox‚Ñ¢ (ANaerobic AMMonia OXidation) works by artificially extending detention time and preserving denitrifiying bacteria through the use of substrate added to the mixed liquor and continuously recycled from it prior to secondary clarification. Many other proprietary schemes are being deployed, including DEMON‚Ñ¢, Sharon-ANAMMOX‚Ñ¢, ANITA-Mox‚Ñ¢, and DeAmmon‚Ñ¢. The bacteria Brocadia anammoxidans can remove ammonium from waste water B. Kartal, G.J. Kuenen and M.C.M van Loosdrecht, Sewage Treatment with Anammox, Science, 2010, vol. 328 pp. 702‚Äì03 through anaerobic oxidation of ammonium to hydrazine, a form of rocket fuel. =Phosphorus removal= Every adult human excretes between of phosphorus annually. Studies of United States sewage in the late 1960s estimated mean per capita contributions of in urine and feces, in synthetic detergents, and lesser variable amounts used as corrosion and scale control chemicals in water supplies. Source control via alternative detergent formulations has subsequently reduced the largest contribution, but the content of urine and feces will remain unchanged. Phosphorus removal is important as it is a limiting nutrient for algae growth in many fresh water systems. (For a description of the negative effects of algae, see Nutrient removal). It is also particularly important for water reuse systems where high phosphorus concentrations may lead to fouling of downstream equipment such as reverse osmosis. Phosphorus can be removed biologically in a process called enhanced biological phosphorus removal. In this process, specific bacteria, called polyphosphate-accumulating organisms (PAOs), are selectively enriched and accumulate large quantities of phosphorus within their cells (up to 20 percent of their mass). When the biomass enriched in these bacteria is separated from the treated water, these biosolids have a high fertilizer value. Phosphorus removal can also be achieved by chemical precipitation, usually with salts of iron (e.g. ferric chloride), aluminum (e.g. alum), or lime. This may lead to excessive sludge production as hydroxides precipitate and the added chemicals can be expensive. Chemical phosphorus removal requires significantly smaller equipment footprint than biological removal, is easier to operate and is often more reliable than biological phosphorus removal. Another method for phosphorus removal is to use granular laterite. Some systems use both biological phosphorus removal and chemical phosphorus removal. The chemical phosphorus removal in those systems may be used as a backup system, for use when the biological phosphorus removal is not removing enough phosphorus, or may be used continuously. In either case, using both biological and chemical phosphorus removal has the advantage of not increasing sludge production as much as chemical phosphorus removal on its own, with the disadvantage of the increased initial cost associated with installing two different systems. Once removed, phosphorus, in the form of a phosphate-rich sewage sludge, may be dumped in a landfill or used as fertilizer. In the latter case, the treated sewage sludge is also sometimes referred to as biosolids. Disinfection The purpose of disinfection in the treatment of waste water is to substantially reduce the number of microorganisms in the water to be discharged back into the environment for the later use of drinking, bathing, irrigation, etc. The effectiveness of disinfection depends on the quality of the water being treated (e.g., cloudiness, pH, etc.), the type of disinfection being used, the disinfectant dosage (concentration and time), and other environmental variables. Cloudy water will be treated less successfully, since solid matter can shield organisms, especially from ultraviolet light or if contact times are low. Generally, short contact times, low doses and high flows all militate against effective disinfection. Common methods of disinfection include ozone, chlorine, ultraviolet light, or sodium hypochlorite. Monochloramine, which is used for drinking water, is not used in the treatment of waste water because of its persistence. After multiple steps of disinfection, the treated water is ready to be released back into the water cycle by means of the nearest body of water or agriculture. Afterwards, the water can be transferred to reserves for everyday human uses. Chlorination remains the most common form of waste water disinfection in North America due to its low cost and long-term history of effectiveness. One disadvantage is that chlorination of residual organic material can generate chlorinated- organic compounds that may be carcinogenic or harmful to the environment. Residual chlorine or chloramines may also be capable of chlorinating organic material in the natural aquatic environment. Further, because residual chlorine is toxic to aquatic species, the treated effluent must also be chemically dechlorinated, adding to the complexity and cost of treatment. Ultraviolet (UV) light can be used instead of chlorine, iodine, or other chemicals. Because no chemicals are used, the treated water has no adverse effect on organisms that later consume it, as may be the case with other methods. UV radiation causes damage to the genetic structure of bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens, making them incapable of reproduction. The key disadvantages of UV disinfection are the need for frequent lamp maintenance and replacement and the need for a highly treated effluent to ensure that the target microorganisms are not shielded from the UV radiation (i.e., any solids present in the treated effluent may protect microorganisms from the UV light). In the United Kingdom, UV light is becoming the most common means of disinfection because of the concerns about the impacts of chlorine in chlorinating residual organics in the wastewater and in chlorinating organics in the receiving water. Some sewage treatment systems in Canada and the US also use UV light for their effluent water disinfection.Florida Department of Environmental Protection. Tallahassee, FL \\"Ultraviolet Disinfection for Domestic Waste water.\\" 2010-03-17. Ozone (3) is generated by passing oxygen (2) through a high voltage potential resulting in a third oxygen atom becoming attached and forming 3. Ozone is very unstable and reactive and oxidizes most organic material it comes in contact with, thereby destroying many pathogenic microorganisms. Ozone is considered to be safer than chlorine because, unlike chlorine which has to be stored on site (highly poisonous in the event of an accidental release), ozone is generated on-site as needed from the oxygen in the ambient air. Ozonation also produces fewer disinfection by-products than chlorination. A disadvantage of ozone disinfection is the high cost of the ozone generation equipment and the requirements for special operators. = Fourth treatment stage = Micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals, ingredients of household chemicals, chemicals used in small businesses or industries, environmental persistent pharmaceutical pollutants (EPPP) or pesticides may not be eliminated in the conventional treatment process (primary, secondary and tertiary treatment) and therefore lead to water pollution.UBA (Umweltbundesamt) (2014): Ma√ünahmen zur Verminderung des Eintrages von Mikroschadstoffen in die Gew√§sser. Texte 85/2014 (in German) Although concentrations of those substances and their decomposition products are quite low, there is still a chance of harming aquatic organisms. For pharmaceuticals, the following substances have been identified as \\"toxicologically relevant\\": substances with endocrine disrupting effects, genotoxic substances and substances that enhance the development of bacterial resistances.Walz, A., G√∂tz, K. (2014): Arzneimittelwirkstoffe im Wasserkreislauf. ISOE-Materialien zur Sozialen √ñkologie Nr. 36 (in German) They mainly belong to the group of EPPP. Techniques for elimination of micropollutants via a fourth treatment stage during sewage treatment are implemented in Germany, Switzerland, Sweden and the Netherlands and tests are ongoing in several other countries. Such process steps mainly consist of activated carbon filters that adsorb the micropollutants. The combination of advanced oxidation with ozone followed by granular activated carbon (GAC) has been suggested as a cost-effective treatment combination for pharmaceutical residues. For a full reduction of microplasts the combination of ultrafiltration followed by GAC has been suggested. Also the use of enzymes such as the enzyme laccase is under investigation. A new concept which could provide an energy-efficient treatment of micropollutants could be the use of laccase secreting fungi cultivated at a wastewater treatment plant to degrade micropollutants and at the same time to provide enzymes at a cathode of a microbial biofuel cells. Microbial biofuel cells are investigated for their property to treat organic matter in wastewater. To reduce pharmaceuticals in water bodies, \\"source control\\" measures are also under investigation, such as innovations in drug development or more responsible handling of drugs. Odor control Odors emitted by sewage treatment are typically an indication of an anaerobic or \\"septic\\" condition. Early stages of processing will tend to produce foul-smelling gases, with hydrogen sulfide being most common in generating complaints. Large process plants in urban areas will often treat the odors with carbon reactors, a contact media with bio-slimes, small doses of chlorine, or circulating fluids to biologically capture and metabolize the noxious gases.Walker, James D. and Welles Products Corporation (1976).\\"Tower for removing odors from gases.\\" U.S. Patent No. 4421534. Other methods of odor control exist, including addition of iron salts, hydrogen peroxide, calcium nitrate, etc. to manage hydrogen sulfide levels. High-density solids pumps are suitable for reducing odors by conveying sludge through hermetic closed pipework.  Energy requirements  For conventional sewage treatment plants, around 30 percent of the annual operating costs is usually required for energy. The energy requirements vary with type of treatment process as well as wastewater load. For example, constructed wetlands have a lower energy requirement than activated sludge plants, as less energy is required for the aeration step.Hoffmann, H., Platzer, C., von M√ºnch, E., Winker, M. (2011). Technology review of constructed wetlands ‚Äì Subsurface flow constructed wetlands for greywater and domestic wastewater treatment. Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH, Eschborn, Germany, p. 11 Sewage treatment plants that produce biogas in their sewage sludge treatment process with anaerobic digestion can produce enough energy to meet most of the energy needs of the sewage treatment plant itself. In conventional secondary treatment processes, most of the electricity is used for aeration, pumping systems and equipment for the dewatering and drying of sewage sludge. Advanced wastewater treatment plants, e.g. for nutrient removal, require more energy than plants that only achieve primary or secondary treatment. Sludge treatment and disposal Sludge treatment in the sewage treatment of Birsfelden. The sludges accumulated in a wastewater treatment process must be treated and disposed of in a safe and effective manner. The purpose of digestion is to reduce the amount of organic matter and the number of disease- causing microorganisms present in the solids. The most common treatment options include anaerobic digestion, aerobic digestion, and composting. Incineration is also used, albeit to a much lesser degree. The use of a green approach, such as phytoremediation, has been recently proposed as a valuable tool to improve sewage sludge contaminated by trace elements and persistent organic pollutants. Sludge treatment depends on the amount of solids generated and other site-specific conditions. Composting is most often applied to small- scale plants with aerobic digestion for mid-sized operations, and anaerobic digestion for the larger-scale operations. The sludge is sometimes passed through a so-called pre-thickener which de-waters the sludge. Types of pre- thickeners include centrifugal sludge thickeners, rotary drum sludge thickeners and belt filter presses. Dewatered sludge may be incinerated or transported offsite for disposal in a landfill or use as an agricultural soil amendment. Environment aspects WWTP Dƒõƒç√≠n, Czech Republic Treated water drained to the Elbe river, Dƒõƒç√≠n, Czech Republic The outlet of the Karlsruhe sewage treatment plant flows into the Alb Many processes in a wastewater treatment plant are designed to mimic the natural treatment processes that occur in the environment, whether that environment is a natural water body or the ground. If not overloaded, bacteria in the environment will consume organic contaminants, although this will reduce the levels of oxygen in the water and may significantly change the overall ecology of the receiving water. Native bacterial populations feed on the organic contaminants, and the numbers of disease-causing microorganisms are reduced by natural environmental conditions such as predation or exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Consequently, in cases where the receiving environment provides a high level of dilution, a high degree of wastewater treatment may not be required. However, recent evidence has demonstrated that very low levels of specific contaminants in wastewater, including hormones (from animal husbandry and residue from human hormonal contraception methods) and synthetic materials such as phthalates that mimic hormones in their action, can have an unpredictable adverse impact on the natural biota and potentially on humans if the water is re-used for drinking water.. environment-agency.gov.uk.

USGS In the US and EU, uncontrolled discharges of wastewater to the environment are not permitted under law, and strict water quality requirements are to be met, as clean drinking water is essential. (For requirements in the US, see Clean Water Act.) A significant threat in the coming decades will be the increasing uncontrolled discharges of wastewater within rapidly developing countries. =Effects on biology= Sewage treatment plants can have multiple effects on nutrient levels in the water that the treated sewage flows into. These nutrients can have large effects on the biological life in the water in contact with the effluent. Stabilization ponds (or sewage treatment ponds) can include any of the following: * Oxidation ponds, which are aerobic bodies of water usually in depth that receive effluent from sedimentation tanks or other forms of primary treatment. :* Dominated by algae * Polishing ponds are similar to oxidation ponds but receive effluent from an oxidation pond or from a plant with an extended mechanical treatment. :* Dominated by zooplankton * Facultative lagoons, raw sewage lagoons, or sewage lagoons are ponds where sewage is added with no primary treatment other than coarse screening. These ponds provide effective treatment when the surface remains aerobic; although anaerobic conditions may develop near the layer of settled sludge on the bottom of the pond. * Anaerobic lagoons are heavily loaded ponds. :* Dominated by bacteria * Sludge lagoons are aerobic ponds, usually in depth, that receive anaerobically digested primary sludge, or activated secondary sludge under water. :* Upper layers are dominated by algae Phosphorus limitation is a possible result from sewage treatment and results in flagellate-dominated plankton, particularly in summer and fall.Edmondson, W.T.

Vol. 1. A phytoplankton study found high nutrient concentrations linked to sewage effluents. High nutrient concentration leads to high chlorophyll a concentrations, which is a proxy for primary production in marine environments. High primary production means high phytoplankton populations and most likely high zooplankton populations, because zooplankton feed on phytoplankton. However, effluent released into marine systems also leads to greater population instability. The planktonic trends of high populations close to input of treated sewage is contrasted by the bacterial trend. In a study of Aeromonas spp. in increasing distance from a wastewater source, greater change in seasonal cycles was found the furthest from the effluent. This trend is so strong that the furthest location studied actually had an inversion of the Aeromonas spp. cycle in comparison to that of fecal coliforms. Since there is a main pattern in the cycles that occurred simultaneously at all stations it indicates seasonal factors (temperature, solar radiation, phytoplankton) control of the bacterial population. The effluent dominant species changes from Aeromonas caviae in winter to Aeromonas sobria in the spring and fall while the inflow dominant species is Aeromonas caviae, which is constant throughout the seasons.  Reuse  With suitable technology, it is possible to reuse sewage effluent for drinking water, although this is usually only done in places with limited water supplies, such as Windhoek and Singapore.PUB (Singapore National Water Agency)(2011). \\"NEWater: History.\\" In arid countries, treated wastewater is often used in agriculture. For example, in Israel, about 50 percent of agricultural water use (total use was in 2008) is provided through reclaimed sewer water. Future plans call for increased use of treated sewer water as well as more desalination plants as part of water supply and sanitation in Israel. Constructed wetlands fed by wastewater provide both treatment and habitats for flora and fauna. Another example for reuse combined with treatment of sewage are the East Kolkata Wetlands in India. These wetlands are used to treat Kolkata's sewage, and the nutrients contained in the wastewater sustain fish farms and agriculture.  Developing countries  Few reliable figures exist on the share of the wastewater collected in sewers that is being treated in the world. A global estimate by UNDP and UN-Habitat is that 90% of all wastewater generated is released into the environment untreated. In many developing countries the bulk of domestic and industrial wastewater is discharged without any treatment or after primary treatment only. In Latin America about 15 percent of collected wastewater passes through treatment plants (with varying levels of actual treatment). In Venezuela, a below average country in South America with respect to wastewater treatment, 97 percent of the country's sewage is discharged raw into the environment. Technical Report No. 40. In Iran, a relatively developed Middle Eastern country, the majority of Tehran's population has totally untreated sewage injected to the city's groundwater.Massoud Tajrishy and Ahmad Abrishamchi (2005). \\"Integrated Approach to Water and Wastewater Management for Tehran, Iran\\". Water Conservation, Reuse, and Recycling: Proceedings of the Iranian- American Workshop. Washington, DC: National Academies Press. However, the construction of major parts of the sewage system, collection and treatment, in Tehran is almost complete, and under development, due to be fully completed by the end of 2012. In Isfahan, Iran's third largest city, sewage treatment was started more than 100 years ago. Only few cities in sub-Saharan Africa have sewer-based sanitation systems, let alone wastewater treatment plants, an exception being South Africa and ‚Äì until the late 1990s ‚Äì Zimbabwe.Zimbabwe: Water and Sanitation Crisis, Human Rights Watch, Instead, most urban residents in sub-Saharan Africa rely on on-site sanitation systems without sewers, such as septic tanks and pit latrines, and fecal sludge management in these cities is an enormous challenge.Chowdhry, S., Kon√©, D. (2012). Business Analysis of Fecal Sludge Management: Emptying and Transportation Services in Africa and Asia ‚Äì Draft final report. Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Seattle, USA History The Great Stink of 1858 stimulated research into the problem of sewage treatment. In this caricature in The Times, Michael Faraday reports to Father Thames on the state of the river. Basic sewer systems were used for waste removal in ancient Mesopotamia, where vertical shafts carried the waste away into cesspools. Similar systems existed in the Indus Valley civilization in modern-day India and in Ancient Crete and Greece. In the Middle Ages the sewer systems built by the Romans fell into disuse and waste was collected into cesspools that were periodically emptied by workers known as 'rakers' who would often sell it as fertilizer to farmers outside the city. Modern sewerage systems were first built in the mid-nineteenth century as a reaction to the exacerbation of sanitary conditions brought on by heavy industrialization and urbanization. Due to the contaminated water supply, cholera outbreaks occurred in 1832, 1849 and 1855 in London, killing tens of thousands of people. This, combined with the Great Stink of 1858, when the smell of untreated human waste in the River Thames became overpowering, and the report into sanitation reform of the Royal Commissioner Edwin Chadwick, led to the Metropolitan Commission of Sewers appointing Joseph Bazalgette to construct a vast underground sewage system for the safe removal of waste. Contrary to Chadwick's recommendations, Bazalgette's system, and others later built in Continental Europe, did not pump the sewage onto farm land for use as fertilizer; it was simply piped to a natural waterway away from population centres, and pumped back into the environment. =Early attempts= One of the first attempts at diverting sewage for use as a fertilizer in the farm was made by the cotton mill owner James Smith in the 1840s. He experimented with a piped distribution system initially proposed by James Vetch that collected sewage from his factory and pumped it into the outlying farms, and his success was enthusiastically followed by Edwin Chadwick and supported by organic chemist Justus von Liebig. The idea was officially adopted by the Health of Towns Commission, and various schemes (known as sewage farms) were trialled by different municipalities over the next 50 years. At first, the heavier solids were channeled into ditches on the side of the farm and were covered over when full, but soon flat-bottomed tanks were employed as reservoirs for the sewage; the earliest patent was taken out by William Higgs in 1846 for \\"tanks or reservoirs in which the contents of sewers and drains from cities, towns and villages are to be collected and the solid animal or vegetable matters therein contained, solidified and dried...\\" Improvements to the design of the tanks included the introduction of the horizontal-flow tank in the 1850s and the radial-flow tank in 1905. These tanks had to be manually de-sludged periodically, until the introduction of automatic mechanical de-sludgers in the early 1900s. The precursor to the modern septic tank was the cesspool in which the water was sealed off to prevent contamination and the solid waste was slowly liquified due to anaerobic action; it was invented by L.H Mouras in France in the 1860s. Donald Cameron, as City Surveyor for Exeter patented an improved version in 1895, which he called a 'septic tank'; septic having the meaning of 'bacterial'. These are still in worldwide use, especially in rural areas unconnected to large-scale sewage systems. =Biological treatment= Edward Frankland, a distinguished chemist, who demonstrated the possibility of chemically treating sewage in the 1870s It was not until the late 19th century that it became possible to treat the sewage by biologically decomposing the organic components through the use of microorganisms and removing the pollutants. Land treatment was also steadily becoming less feasible, as cities grew and the volume of sewage produced could no longer be absorbed by the farmland on the outskirts. Edward Frankland conducted experiments at the sewage farm in Croydon, England, during the 1870s and was able to demonstrate that filtration of sewage through porous gravel produced a nitrified effluent (the ammonia was converted into nitrate) and that the filter remained unclogged over long periods of time. This established the then revolutionary possibility of biological treatment of sewage using a contact bed to oxidize the waste. This concept was taken up by the chief chemist for the London Metropolitan Board of Works, William Libdin, in 1887: :...in all probability the true way of purifying sewage...will be first to separate the sludge, and then turn into neutral effluent... retain it for a sufficient period, during which time it should be fully aerated, and finally discharge it into the stream in a purified condition. This is indeed what is aimed at and imperfectly accomplished on a sewage farm. From 1885 to 1891 filters working on this principle were constructed throughout the UK and the idea was also taken up in the US at the Lawrence Experiment Station in Massachusetts, where Frankland's work was confirmed. In 1890 the LES developed a 'trickling filter' that gave a much more reliable performance. Contact beds were developed in Salford, Lancashire and by scientists working for the London City Council in the early 1890s. According to Christopher Hamlin, this was part of a conceptual revolution that replaced the philosophy that saw \\"sewage purification as the prevention of decomposition with one that tried to facilitate the biological process that destroy sewage naturally.\\" Contact beds were tanks containing the inert substance, such as stones or slate, that maximized the surface area available for the microbial growth to break down the sewage. The sewage was held in the tank until it was fully decomposed and it was then filtered out into the ground. This method quickly became widespread, especially in the UK, where it was used in Leicester, Sheffield, Manchester and Leeds. The bacterial bed was simultaneously developed by Joseph Corbett as Borough Engineer in Salford and experiments in 1905 showed that his method was superior in that greater volumes of sewage could be purified better for longer periods of time than could be achieved by the contact bed. The Royal Commission on Sewage Disposal published its eighth report in 1912 that set what became the international standard for sewage discharge into rivers; the '20:30 standard', which allowed Biochemical oxygen demand and suspended solid per litre ().Final report of the commissioners appointed to inquire and report what methods of treating and disposing of sewage (1912). us.archive.org See also * List of wastewater treatment technologies * Organisms involved in water purification * Nutrient Recovery and Reuse: producing agricultural nutrients from sewage * Waste disposal References External links * \\"Following the Flow: An Inside Look at Wastewater Treatment\\" ‚Äì Water Environment Federation (US).

The dominant feature is the mobility or easiness of moving the lines from one area of forest to another - and in the early years the relatively primitive state of the lines. The dominant feature is the narrow gauge, and lightness of the locomotives, relative to permanent railways. In Western Australia, to allow for interchangeability of rail stock with the government rail system, a lot of the lines were gauge, however the weight of the rails was usually much lighter than mainline steel.

History  When the Spanish arrived, the area of Caucete, was occupied by the Huarpes, in a settlement in the vicinity of Pie de Palo. Nearly three centuries later (in 1822), to establish a colony with American population, Amman Rawson asked the government for these lands, which were awarded in 1824. Rawson, the father of William Rawson, chaired the Founding Society of Caucete, which divided the land into 25 blocks and each of them into two parts, through a ditch central allowed to hold irrigation in the plot. The colony began to be populated, but with the people in the area, not American immigration. Subsequently, Benavides, through the Regulation Irrigation 1851,) divided the province into nine sections, one of which was Caucete. Through its Departmental Commission and with the support of the neighborhood, the new section proposed a project for the foundation of a villa. Thus was born Villa Independence, by the decree of November 15, 1851.  Geography  The department Caucete is located in the southeast of the San Juan Province, 28 kilometers east of San Juan.

It is a Greek Revival building built in 1859. A convention met here on December 17, 1860, whose delegates voted unanimously for South Carolina to secede from the United States, leading to the American Civil War. It was designated a National Historic Landmark as First Baptist Church, the role it played at the time. History The First Baptist Church of Columbia was first organized in 1809, with the building of the first church building, located on Sumter Street, in 1811.First Baptist Church - South Carolina Historical Markers on Waymarking.com The second First Baptist Church was built in 1859 by an unknown architect. Its construction was funded by James P. Boyce, a former president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. The following year, in 1860, the Church was the site of the first state convention to discuss secession following the election of Abraham Lincoln as President of the United States. It was chosen because it was the largest meeting place in Columbia. Under the chairmanship of D. F. Jamison, a unanimous vote of 159-0 in favor of secession on December 17, 1860 led to South Carolina seceding from the United States; it was the only such convention where the vote to secede was unanimous. Six other states would follow South Carolina's lead before the Battle of Fort Sumter; some felt if they did not secede now, they might lose the argument that a state had the right to secede, a right that has never been confirmed or denied by a court of law. and This convention lasted only one day, as Columbia was then experiencing an outbreak of smallpox. South Carolina's Order of Secession would not be signed until the delegates at this convention reconvened at Charleston, South Carolina on December 20; Columbia's little First Baptist Church was where the power brokers of South Carolina first declared that the state would secede. When the Union Army invaded Columbia, they set fire to the Washington Street Methodist Church, South, building, led by the black First Baptist sexton who thought that it was the site of the secession convention. The invaders burned a third of Columbia's buildings, but the First Baptist Church was spared. Until 1992, the original building was used for services, which have been televised. The church is still used for other activities such as offices, weddings, and a coffee shop connected to the church. In 1992, services moved to a new building connected to the historic building that includes the new sanctuary and the Estep Family Life Centre. The original building was renamed for Boyce. Building description Interior, 1960, HABS The First Baptist Church is built in Greek Revival style. Originally, the building was wide and long. It has molded brick Tuscan portico and Tuscan pilasters along the sides. There is a balcony on each side and above the entrance. Around 1900 the bricks were painted a dirty brown. In 1941 the church was given air conditioning and was extended , with its rear wall moved, giving a place for the choir and a baptistery. In 1949 fifteen foot side aisles were placed, with steel columns made in Doric style to reinforce and match the old architecture. It was also in 1949 that the dirty brown paint of the brick walls was removed, but in the process the walls were now ranging in color from dark pink to light tan. The original (1859) church was deep by wide. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971, and became a National Historic Landmark in 1973.

Elk have a variety of uses. The velvet antler or, the antler in the premature stages of growth, has been found useful in medicinal purposes; as well as the venison industry. All of these markets are rising in popularity thus causing an increase in the breeding industry. Other species of similar type are farmed in the same way such as deer, moose, and red stag. Livestock The elk farming market is relatively new to the United States. In its early stages, the breeding stock has become of high value. The same standard pertains to the production of elk as cattle: the bigger the better. In 1990 the North American Elk Breeders Association (NAEBA) was founded. NAEBA has set up rules and regulations for breed purity and strength, ownership, and marketing. They help the industry to continually increase in production and quality of animal. Elk do not need the close care that it takes to raise cattle. This is because of the strong, hardy nature of the animal. They will eat just about anything they can find, ranging from grass, shrubs, weeds, and even tree bark. The most common feeds are alfalfa and grain. In an area suitable to hold one beef cow, two to three elk may be kept comfortably. Elk may eat 2 to 3 percent of their body weight daily. On average a cow elk, the female, has a live weight of 450 to 650 pounds. The bulls are much larger, weighing from 800 to 1,000 pounds. Elk need an increase of nutrients so that they can produce better products. For example, before and during breeding, while the antler is growing so they it will produce a larger amount of velvet, and after calving. The facilities that hold elk are very different than those of cattle. The fence is made of high-tensile wire, which provides strength and durability, which should be at least 8 feet high. The area should provide a large grazing area along with a fresh water supply and shelter. It is recommended that a strand of barbed wire be stretched at ground level to keep predators out and in. Electrified wire placed slightly above ground level is another option. Breeding Elk breed from early September through November. This period is called the rut. A cow will give birth after a 250-day gestation. The calves are carried throughout the winter. Therefore, it is necessary that they are well fed and receive the needed nutrients during this period. If they are well taken care of, the elk will have up to a 95% pregnancy rate. Calves are born from May through July. Cow elk can begin to breed after 18 months, but bulls should wait to mature for two to three years. A cow elk can breed for more than 15 years effectively. The estrus cycle is about 21 days. A bull may breed as many as 20 cows in a season. It has become a very common practice amongst elk breeders to use artificial insemination, a method of ensuring male genetic superiority‚Äîe.g., a bull with large antlers will pass that trait onto his offspring. For this purpose the semen is bought and the cow is bred artificially with the hope that the young will receive that genetic trait. Through artificial insemination and semen preservation, a sire can continue to produce offspring even after he is dead or his health has declined. Products Velvet antler, the antler in the premature growing stages, is the main product derived from mature bull elk. In the second year of a bull elk life the antler begins to grow and continues to do so every year after that. The velvet is harvested while in the late stages of growth, just before it starts to turn into antler. That is when it calcifies and becomes hard like bone. A mature bull will produce 20 pounds or more of velvet annually. The current record is about 50 pounds in North America. Velvet antler is tissue that is living and growing rapidly. It can grow up to one half pound a day. Because it is living, the velvet must be removed surgically. Like in any operation precautionary measures are taken to ensure the humane care and safety of the animal. Once cut, the velvet is then frozen and shipped to the manufacturer where it is then made into a consumable substance. Recent studies have shown that velvet contains large amounts of minerals with natural anti-inflammatory agents. Venison There is a growing demand for elk meat around the world. Elk meat is famous for its taste as well as its health benefits, as it is high in protein but low in fat, cholesterol, and calories. Sources *Forrest, R. (2004, November). Grande premium meats.

History =Background= The Jaina Bhagavati-Sutra of the 5th century AD mentions that Purulia was one of the sixteen mahajanapadas and was a part of the kingdom known as Vajra-bhumi in ancient times. In 1833, Manbhum district was carved out of the Jungle Mahals district, with headquarters at Manbazar. In 1838, the headquarters was transferred to Purulia. After independence, when Manbhum district was a part of Bihar, efforts were made to impose Hindi on the Bengali-speaking majority of the district and it led to the Bengali Language Movement (Manbhum). In 1956, the Manbhum district was partitioned between Bihar and West Bengal under the States Reorganization Act and the Bihar and West Bengal (Transfer of Territories) Act 1956. =Maoist activities= Manbazar, along with certain other areas such as Banduan, Jhalda, and Jaipur were part of the area of violent activities by the Maoists, also referred to as Naxalites. =Red corridor= 106 districts spanning 10 states across India, described as being part of the left wing extremism activities, constitutes the Red corridor. In West Bengal the districts of Paschim Medinipur, Bankura, Purulia and Birbhum are part of the Red corridor.

The CPI (Maoist) extremism affected CD blocks in the Purulia district were: Jhalda I, Jhalda II, Arsha, Baghmundi, Balarampur, Barabazar, Manbazar II and Bandwan. Certain reports also included the Manbazar I and Joypur CD blocks and some times indicted the whole of Purulia district. The Lalgarh movement, which started attracting attention after the failed assassination attempt on Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, then chief minister of West Bengal, in the Salboni area of the Paschim Medinipur district, on 2 November 2008 and the police action that followed, had also spread over to these areas. The movement was not just a political struggle but an armed struggle that concurrently took the look of a social struggle. A large number of CPI (M) activists were killed. Although the epi-centre of the movement was Lalgarh, it was spread across 19 police stations in three adjoining districts ‚Äì Paschim Medinipur, Bankura and Purulia, all thickly forested and near the border with Jharkhand. The deployment of CRPF and other forces started on 11 June 2009. The movement came to an end after the 2011 state assembly elections and change of government in West Bengal.

Background The phrase \\"expert network\\" was originally coined by Mark O'Connor of Yankee Group in presentations introducing his August 1997 Management Strategies report, Knowledge Management: People and the Process. The first known published appearance of the phrase in this context is in the April 1999 Yankee Group white paper A Knowledge Perspective: The Knowledge Management Product and Service Domain. In the December 1999 publication, \\"Knowledge Evolution: Tools of the Trade,\\" clients were advised to utilize Expert Networks to \\"Understand who the experts are throughout the organization (including the extended organization), and more appropriately employ that expertise within a broader range of business contexts for better decision making.\\" The first expert networks used internal databases and phone books, just like standard recruitment firms. With the growth of LinkedIn and other online sources, expert networks have become increasingly reliant on custom- sourcing experts online. Since the early 2000s, a rather large industry has sprung up facilitating \\"expert\\" connections, or providing connections to industry or subject matter experts with whom a single individual or organization has no pre-existing relationship with. GLG, one of the oldest expert networks still operating, was founded in 1998. = Internal expert networks = Some consulting and investment companies have built up their own network of experts whom they can utilize on an as-needed basis. = Primary research platforms = Platforms that provide not only expert interactions but also surveys which can be launched from a central interface. These SaaS platforms typically add additional features to the primary research such as messaging, transcription and other advanced AI.  Business models  There are three aspects of business models for expert networks: (1) revenue models, (2) sourcing models, and (3) operating models. Expert networks may apply two different revenue models: subscription-based and transaction-based. = 1. Revenue models =  Transaction-based  The most common revenue model is \\"pay-per-use\\" where an expert networks invoices the client per hour of expert consultation, times the \\"credit\\" price of the expert. The expert network then pays a part of this to the expert.  Subscription-based  The traditional revenue model was to offer subscriptions to clients. This model still represents a large share of the industry, notably for GLG. The client pays for a predefined number of \\"credits\\" at the start of the contract year, which are run down as expert consultations are made. The network keeps the difference between the subscription fees collected and the hourly rates paid out. = 2. Sourcing models = When sourcing experts to connect with clients, an expert network may use either an Internal database, or custom recruiting (or a combination). Whereas expert networks traditionally relied on internal databases of experts, business models have tilted towards 'custom recruiting' of new experts for each particular case. This was enabled by the rapid growth of LinkedIn in the years following the global financial crisis of 2008. = 3. Operating models = Expert networks structure internal operations differently, along models that transcend their revenue and sourcing models. These have been classified in five categories, each solving the task of supplying relevant experts to customers: * Standard expert networks * DIY marketplaces * Expert Q&A; companies * Crowd-funded expert calls Commercial expert networks A primary example of expert networks are investor networks that are in the business of primary research. These firms connect buy side investors, consultants, and business decision-makers with industry experts. Consultations between expert network clients and experts may be in the form of \\"face-to-face meetings, phone calls, teleconferences, video conferences, [or] email exchanges.\\" According to a 2009 report by Integrity Research, there are at least 38 investor expert network providers worldwide. Although most expert networks operate across verticals and geographies, recent trends point towards specialized expert networks serving a particular geography or vertical. In recent years, as sell-side research has become increasingly \\"scarce and less influential,\\" institutional investors have turned to expert networks to gain \\"new insights and a competitive edge\\" within a compliant framework. According to a 2011 report published by TABB Group, 81% of investment professionals believe that \\"talking to experts\\" is a legitimate, value-adding part of the investment due diligence process. Investor expert networks became more widely used after the implementation of Regulation Fair Disclosure in 2000, which made it harder for institutional investors to get market moving information directly from publicly traded companies. Hedge funds were early adopters, but the use of expert networks quickly spread to all types of institutional investors, including mutual funds, pension funds, banks, and private equity firms. The investment community continues to be the largest consumer of expert network services. In 2009, expert network companies generated an estimated $364 million in revenues, according to a report by Integrity Research.http://secure.integrity-research.com/imageweb/executivesummary- expertnetworks.pdf = Investor expert network legal compliance issues = One of the biggest challenges faced by expert network operators is legal compliance with regard to the information passed from information provider to researcher. Several expert networks have made headlines in relation to improper information disclosure and insider trading allegations. Networks have taken different approaches to the compliance puzzle. Some spend millions reaching out to publicly traded companies and others don't allow employees of publicly traded companies to consult at all. = Investor expert network controversy = The Fall 2009 indictment of individuals associated with hedge fund FrontPoint illustrated the compliance challenges of speaking with sources directly. The individuals had initiated access with a Dr. Yves Benhamou, board member of an ongoing clinical trial. Though these began as formal engagements through Guidepoint (an Expert Network), their exchanges with Dr. Benhamou would become less formal and more specific. They stopped going through the network, opting to contact one another directly, and they allegedly culminated in the portfolio managers coaxing inside information from Dr. Benhamou and Dr. Benhamou obliging. The circumstances illustrate one of the core challenges of primary research in general and a central plank of the expert network platform. The investigations resulted in allegations against Primary Global Research LLC. While the United States expert networks were weathering the storm of the insider trading investigations, European expert networks have not been nearly as affected and have been seen as alternatives, experiencing growth and investment.

He began writing songs which he recorded at home. He also learned how to play other instruments and began holding neighborhood garage performances with a band, Snowhite, he formed with bass guitarist Seth Anderson, drummer Samuel Anderson and guitarist Tony Sliwinski. Berishaj had taught Seth how to play the bass guitar. Eventually, he began mailing demos and performance videos to record labels, having his mother cold call A&R; representatives. By eighteen, Berishaj had written and recorded a whole album, Love Arcade, on which he plays all the instruments. He secured a recording contract with Atlantic Records, after turning down an offer from Sony Records, along with his band in 2005. His demos had impressed David Wimmer and Leslie Dweck of Atalantic, who were taken by Berishaj's drive and ambition.

Cohen for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The series follows the adventures of a late-20th-century New York City pizza delivery boy, Philip J. Fry, who, after being unwittingly cryogenically frozen for one thousand years, finds employment at Planet Express, an interplanetary delivery company in the retro-futuristic 31st century. Futurama has eight main cast members and many other incidental characters. For an overview of the show's main characters, see the list of Futurama characters. Major characters =Zapp Brannigan= Zapp Brannigan is a 25-Star general in the military of the Democratic Order Of Planets (D.O.O.P.), although his title varies. Brannigan was first seen in the episode \\"Love's Labours Lost in Space\\" as Captain of the starship Nimbus, where he imprisons Fry, Leela and Bender for violating \\"Brannigan's Law\\". Zapp is generally idiotic, egotistical, boorish, cowardly, and painfully short- sighted. He will often mispronounce words, such as champagne (\\"sham-PAGG-Enn\\") and guacamole (\\"GWACK-a-mole\\") in the episodes \\"Love's Labours Lost in Space\\" and \\"The Problem with Popplers\\" (respectively). Soon after first meeting him, Leela has sex with him out of pity. He mentions this encounter repeatedly in later episodes while remaining convinced that Leela lusts after him despite her vocal (and often violent) opposition to the idea. He is known to make catastrophic mistakes (such as destroying D.O.O.P. headquarters in \\"Brannigan, Begin Again\\"), yet, in the public eye, he is seen as an established and reputable leader of the Earth's army (Bender's Big Score, among others). Though viewed publicly as a respected hero for his numerous military victories, almost all of these victories are against comically weak opponents (such as the \\"retiree people of the assisted living nebula\\" and the \\"pacifists of the Gandhi nebula\\") or achieved through tactics that wantonly disregard the safety of his own soldiers. The character is based on the Star Trek captain James T. Kirk, played by William Shatner. The show's executive producer David X. Cohen has described Brannigan as \\"half Captain Kirk, half actual William Shatner\\". Zapp is voiced by Billy West, though he was originally intended to be voiced by Phil Hartman. Hartman insisted on auditioning for the role, and \\"of course, just nailed it\\" according to creator Matt Groening. However, after Hartman was murdered on May 28, 1998, West was given the role. On a Futurama DVD commentary, Groening reveals that Zapp's character and mannerisms were established in West's original audition for the character, and any similarity to Phil Hartman or his other well known cartoon characters (Lionel Hutz and Troy McClure) is simply coincidence. On the other hand, in an interview for the website TV Squad, Billy West states that his Zapp Brannigan is an imitation of Hartman and also \\"modeled after a couple of big dumb announcers I knew.\\" During a live event, West stated that he partially modelled Brannigan's cadence after the radio persona of Doug Tracht, also known as \\"The Greaseman.\\" =Kif Kroker= Lieutenant Kif Kroker (voiced by Maurice LaMarche) is the long-suffering assistant to Captain Zapp Brannigan, and Fourth Lieutenant on the Democratic Order of Planets (DOOP) starship Nimbus. Kif is a short and thin green-skinned alien from the planet Amphibios 9. His frustration with Brannigan's arrogance and general incompetence in Season 1 leads him to be a disaffected, indifferent, sardonic lackey, although his personality develops through the course of the series, becoming more emotional, tender and sweet- natured later on. Zapp thinks Kif to be his best friend and loyal confidant, whereas Kif sees Brannigan as an incompetent buffoon, going so far as to call him a jackass in \\"Love's Labours Lost in Space\\". Despite this, Kif seemingly has some loyalty to Brannigan, even continuing to associate with him after Brannigan caused him to be court-martialed along with him in \\"Brannigan, Begin Again\\". Kif is in a relationship with Amy Wong. =Nibbler= Lord Nibbler (voiced by Frank Welker) masquerades as an innocent, cute and unintelligent pet during most of the series. In reality, he is a highly intelligent Nibblonian and capable of communication, but tries to avoid suspicion while he protects the Earth in general and Fry in particular from the Brainspawn. As with all Nibblonians, Nibbler's feces consist of dark matter, which can be used as starship fuel. It is an extremely dense material, \\"each pound of which weighs over ten thousand pounds\\", according to Professor Farnsworth in the season 1 episode, \\"Love's Labours Lost in Space\\". After he accidentally reveals to the Planet Express crew that he can speak in Bender's Big Score, he forgets to wipe their memory of his intelligence, which it turns out does not affect them much, and from then on he speaks freely to the crew. In the pilot episode, Nibbler's shadow can be seen as Fry falls into the cryogenic freezer, alluding to what is revealed in the fourth season episode The Why of Fry, which is that Nibbler helped send Fry to the future. =Morbo= Morbo the Annihilator (voiced by Maurice LaMarche) is the misanthropic alien anchor for News, Entertainment and Earth Invasion Tonight, Good Morning Earth, and other shows on the Television Network. Morbo is an advance scout for an upcoming alien invasion and does not bother to be subtle about it, often expressing his contempt and extreme hatred for mankind during live news broadcasts and commenting frequently on his species' extremely violent invasion plans. He appears to be using his job to gather information about the human race to aid the planned invasion. He is good friends with President Richard Nixon.\\"A Head in the Polls\\" His co-host Linda van Schoonhoven seems either blissfully ignorant or entirely dismissive of Morbo's hatred and usually responds with an empty-headed laugh to Morbo's contemptuous outbursts. He is married to Mrs. (Fawn) Morbo, a member of his species. =Linda van Schoonhoven= Linda van Schoonhoven (voiced by Tress MacNeille) is the co-anchor of News with Morbo. She is blissfully unaware of or indifferent to his hatred for humanity, often giggling absentmindedly when he calls for the death of humans. Linda joins Leela and her feministas in Into the Wild Green Yonder due to Morbo being treated better than her by the producers with higher pay and more air time. In \\"Benderama\\", it is revealed that she is a severe alcoholic, which may explain her cheerful and seemingly oblivious demeanor. It is also revealed that a contributing cause to her alcoholism is her relationship with her children. In Simpsonorama, she is eaten alive by one of the rabbit-shaped creatures that breaks into the studio. =Scruffy= Scruffy (voiced by David Herman) is the Planet Express janitor and a recurring supporting character. Scruffy first appeared in \\"A Fishful of Dollars\\" as a masseuse for Bender,but he was later added to the cast as a little-seen staffperson at Planet Express with the second-season episode \\"Anthology of Interest I\\". Scruffy generally approaches both his job and the rest of his life with a high level of apparent apathy, as shown in \\"Parasites Lost\\", in which he ignores a broken boiler in the Planet Express Headquarters to read a pornographic magazine, and continues to read even after said boiler explodes, declaring, \\"Scruffy's gonna die the way he lived.\\" In \\"Future Stock\\", it is revealed that he is deeply fond of the company, and owns four times as much stock as the other employees. The first several times he is referred to or seen by his co-workers, they ask who he is, to which he replies, \\"I'm Scruffy. The janitor.\\" He is shown several times to read porn magazines like National Pornographic and Zero G Juggs (parodies of actual magazines, National Geographic and Juggs). The Season 6 episode \\"The Prisoner of Benda\\" reveals that he is in love with his robotic wash bucket, but avoids entering into a relationship with it. He is murdered by Robot Santa in the non-canonical anthology episode \\"The Futurama Holiday Spectacular\\". In \\"Law & Oracle\\", it is revealed that Scruffy died at some point and was brought back to life as a zombie, remarking that \\"Life and death are a seamless continuum.\\" Scruffy was seen in the 2014 The Simpsons crossover episode \\"Simpsorama\\" with the rest of the Planet Express staff. Planet Express crew relatives =Cubert Farnsworth= Cubert Farnsworth (voiced by Kath Soucie) is Professor Farnsworth's clone, which the Professor produced in order to serve as his heir and continue his scientific legacy. He is introduced in the episode \\"A Clone of My Own\\", in which he rejects Farnsworth and becomes hostile to the entire Planet Express crew. Professor Farnsworth reveals that he had been lying about his age, and is taken to the Near Death Star for retirement. The crew rescues the professor, and Cubert announces that he will continue the professor's science after all. The Professor created Cubert with the intention that he would continue his work after discovering that his life was wasted with nothing but failed or worthless inventions. Hubert is delighted until he discovers that Cubert's intentions are not as he planned. Cubert wants to do something 'better' with his life and does not accept the responsibility Hubert gives to him. He believes that most things happen to be \\"Impossible\\" contrary to the Professor's belief that nothing is impossible. Cubert has an epiphany after getting hit on the head, realizing how the starship engines Hubert invented work, allowing them to be repaired while Hubert is incapacitated. After this, he decides he wants to follow in his \\"father's\\" footsteps after all. =Dwight Conrad= Dwight Conrad (voiced by Bumper Robinson in the TV series, Phil LaMarr in the films) is the son of Hermes Conrad and LaBarbara Conrad. He is the close friend of Cubert Farnsworth, and takes after his father in the ways of accounting and bureaucracy. =LaBarbara Conrad= LaBarbara Conrad (voiced by Dawnn Lewis) is the wife of Hermes Conrad and mother of Dwight Conrad. She is the ex-wife of Barbados Slim, the rival of Hermes, who she refers to as \\"a human Adonis\\" and \\"a mahogany god\\". Hermes is insecure when Barbados is around, and LaBarbara leaves Hermes temporarily in Bender's Big Score to be with Barbados Slim after Hermes loses his body. She often wears clothes that reveal her belly button (like Amy Wong). =Leo and Inez Wong= Leonardo \\"Leo\\" Wong (voiced by Billy West) and Inez Wong (voiced by Lauren Tom) are the very wealthy parents of Amy Wong. They are human Martians of Chinese descent who own the entire western hemisphere of Mars (which they claim is the best one) and the Wong buggalo ranch. They often pester Amy about their lack of grandchildren and meddle in her love life, trying to find a man to father their grandchild. When Amy and Kif Kroker begin dating, they decide Kif is not man enough for her. They do seem happy when he and Amy have children. Leo is one of the primary villains in Into the Wild Green Yonder. =Morris and Munda= Turanga Morris (voiced by David Herman) and Turanga Munda (voiced by Tress MacNeille) are Leela's father and mother and later on Fry's parents-in- law. They are sewer mutants who love Leela deeply and try to give her as normal a life as possible by passing her off as an alien and leaving her to be raised in an orphanage. They participate in her life as much as possible from the sewers until Leela finally learns the truth and attempts to form a real relationship. They each have one eye, Morris has a vertically oriented mouth, ten toes on each foot, and the ability to shed his skin, while Munda has a lion tail and octopus tentacles in place of arms. Their original appearance in \\"I Second That Emotion\\" shows them as plain cyclopes like Leela. The plot of \\"Leela's Homeworld\\" required the addition of extra mutations to fit with the idea that Leela is able to live a normal life, while they cannot. In the same episode it is also revealed that Munda has a Ph.D. in \\"exo-linguistics\\", which allows her to speak alien languages and write in \\"Alienese\\". =Yancy Fry and Mrs. Fry= Yancy Fry (voiced by John DiMaggio) and Mrs. Fry (voiced by Tress MacNeille) are Fry's father and mother and later on Leela's parents-in-law. They are humans in the 20th century who tended to be absorbed in their own interests (anti-Communism and football, respectively). Fry's ex-girlfriend Michelle later informs Fry that the police wanted to look for him, but his parents felt it was a waste of taxpayers' money. However, it is revealed over the course of the series that they did indeed miss Fry and searched for him to no avail. Yancy is a traditional family name going back to the Revolutionary War, so it is unknown if Yancy is properly referred to as \\"Yancy Sr.\\". (\\"Luck of the Fryrish\\") =Yancy Fry, Jr.= Yancy Fry, Jr. (voiced by Tom Kenny) is Fry's older brother in the 20th and 21st centuries. Yancy Jr. is mostly rude and competitive with Philip as seen in \\"The Luck of the Fryrish.\\" His jealousy of his brother dates back to Philip's birth, when Yancy wanted to have that name, but is informed that his name, Yancy, is a family tradition dating to the Revolutionary War. (It is unknown if he is formally named Yancy Jr.) After Fry disappears, Yancy becomes so devastated that he eventually names his son Philip J. Fry in his honor. Yancy is also the direct ancestor of Professor Farnsworth. Antagonists =Mom= Carol \\"Mom\\" Miller (voiced by Tress MacNeille) is an aggressive, threatening and Machiavellian bully, reminiscent of the Wicked Witch of the West. She manages and owns 99.7% of MomCorp, a large, multibillion-dollar industrial complex with numerous subsidiaries and a monopoly on robot production, as well as being the company that created Bender. Publicly, she retains the corporate image of a sweet, bustling old woman who often slips into the stereotype of a Deep South grandmother; behind the scenes, she removes her fat suit and emerges as a skeleton-thin, malevolent, and foul-mouthed old crone. She has three sons, Walt, Larry and Igner, whom she terrorizes and often employs to do her dirty work. Mom has a romantic history with Hubert J. Farnsworth, who worked at MomCorp when he was younger, and she was previously married to Dr. Ogden Wernstrom. Her given name is revealed to be Carol in \\"The Tip of the Zoidberg\\". In the episode \\"Leela and the Genestalk\\", Mom works out of \\"Momsanto\\", a floating castle that hosts a genetic engineering facility. Its name is a reference to Monsanto, an American agricultural company known for genetic engineering of plants. =Walt, Larry, and Igner= Walt (voiced by Maurice LaMarche), Larry (David Herman) and Igner (John DiMaggio) are Mom's three sons, who are often on the receiving end of her verbal and physical abuse. It is revealed in Bender's Game that Professor Farnsworth is Igner's father. =Omicronians= The Omicronians are an alien race from the planet Omicron Persei 8. Lrrr Lrrr (, voiced by Maurice LaMarche) is ruler of the planet Omicron Persei 8, and always introduces himself as such. He aims to project a strong ruthless demeanor of a conqueror, but often ends up showing a sensitive side. He is currently married to Ndnd, his second wife, with whom he has one son, Jrrr (, voiced by Lauren Tom). His first major appearance in the series was in the episode \\"When Aliens Attack\\". In \\"Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences\\", he claims to have murdered his father for his cape. Ndnd Ndnd (voiced by Tress MacNeille), is Lrrr's second wife. She is overbearing and bossy, often nagging Lrrr to eat more healthily and fulfill his duties as supreme ruler of Omicron Persei 8. In \\"Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences\\" she seems entirely unconcerned by Lrrr's infidelity with another Omicronian woman (actually a human trans- species cross-dresser), but is deeply upset by him listening to Leela's nagging over her own. Their marital problems also feature heavily in \\"Spanish Fry\\". =Robot Mafia= The Robot Mafia is a three-member crime syndicate operating out of \\"Fronty's Meat Market\\" and \\"Small Bill's Laundry\\", who periodically dine at Elzar's, hijack shipments of Zuban cigars, arrange \\"accidents\\" for robots who act against them, as well as other unspecified Mafia-related illegal activities. They are made up of: * The Donbot (voiced by Maurice LaMarche) - The leader of the Robot Mafia. He is often depicted to be oblivious to various plots against him, particularly repeated infractions by Bender, including having sex with the Donbot's wife, having sex with his daughter, stealing from the Donbot, and stealing the Donbot's own foot. * Clamps (voiced by Maurice LaMarche) - A goonbot with an angry, aggressive disposition obsessed with using the clamps that act as his hands. In the Season 6 episode \\"The Silence of the Clamps\\", his name is revealed to be Francis X. Clampazzo. * Joey Mousepad (voiced by John DiMaggio) - A burly goonbot wearing a computer-mouse necklace. He is somewhat dim-witted, as noted by his occasional malapropisms. In one instance, Joey offered to dub Bender (who later chose \\"Blotto\\") with the nickname \\"Clamps\\", which infuriated Clamps. Additional family members The Donbot is married to Fanny, a female robot who has a propeller built into her rear end. She has an affair with Bender during Into the Wild Green Yonder, leading the Donbot to have both of them shot and buried several times. They survive and Fanny returns to her husband. The couple have at least two daughters, including Bella, with whom Bender has a brief relationship during \\"The Silence of the Clamps\\". Her body contains a church bell that rings loudly whenever she moves. =Dr. Ogden Wernstrom= Dr. Ogden Wernstrom (voiced by David Herman) is a former student and now rival of Professor Farnsworth, in the field of science. He resents an \\"A‚àí\\" grade given for sloppy penmanship by Farnsworth in 2900, and worked for over one hundred years in order to obtain revenge. Farnsworth usually greets him with an angry shaking fist and a long, drawn-out \\"Weeeerrnnn-strom!\\" He often competes against Farnsworth in various competitions, such as the Annual Inventors' Symposium, though their rivalry appears to have softened over the years, and they have even managed to collaborate with one another every once in a while. Wernstrom also appears to respect some of Farnsworth's decisions if he himself believes them to be right as well, as showed in The Beast with a Billion Backs. In Bender's Game it is revealed that he was once previously married to Mom, and may be the father of Mom's two eldest sons Walt and Larry. The Season 6 episode \\"Cold Warriors\\" reveals that Wernstrom has been appointed Surgeon General of Earth. =Richard Nixon= The former president (voiced by Billy West) is kept alive as a head in a jar like many other celebrities. He originally resides in the Hall of Presidents in the head museum, but he eventually leaves and becomes the President of Earth, winning by a single vote. Nixon's administration is marked by a violent and aggressive foreign policy, frequently entering into wars which serve little or no purpose. Nixon's head is sometimes accompanied by the headless body of Spiro Agnew. Billy West has commented that he is not impersonating Richard Nixon for the role; he is impersonating Anthony Hopkins in Nixon (with \\"a little bit of werewolf\\", his Nixon has a tendency to inject a sound similar to \\"aroo\\" into his sentences), and that he, instead of trying to cultivate a good impersonation, cultivates the flaws in his impersonation. Matt Groening also frequently expresses his pleasure that he can continue to poke fun at Nixon 30 or 40 years after he was in office. Nixon's head was included in TV Squad's list of the five best television appearances by Presidents in animated or puppet form. The character was considered to be particularly interesting because he could be \\"pure evil\\" but also command respect and also because \\"Nixon's head trapped in glass is just really funny.\\" =Roberto= Roberto (voiced by David Herman) is a criminally insane, psychotic robot who often carries a knife with which he is prone to stabbing. He is often depicted as a patient receiving treatment for criminal insanity. In his first appearance in \\"Insane in the Mainframe\\", he is committed to an insane asylum after he targets the same bank for robbery three times in a row, and is seen killing other robots when escaping that hospital. In Bender's Game he states that his creators were trying to make an insane robot, but \\"failed\\". This violent nature is enhanced by a body that David X. Cohen and Matt Groening say is based on the shape of a tombstone. Roberto appears in Bender's Game as a patient in the same asylum. He later appears in the Middle-earth spoof scenes of that film as a role equivalent to that of Denethor. He briefly becomes sane after he is hit on the head during a battle, but reverts to insanity after he is immediately hit a second time. He appears in \\"Proposition Infinity\\" in the same asylum, this time with a sock instead of his usual knife. He says to Bender, \\"You ever kill a man with a sock? It ain't so hard.\\" In the season 7 episode \\"The Six Million Dollar Mon\\", Roberto is arrested when he tries to rob Hermes Conrad and his wife LaBarbara of their skin. He is executed for this crime, but Bender later digs him up and steals his brain circuitry so that Hermes can have it installed in his own head to complete his transformation into a robot. When the robot tries to steal the skin from the real Hermes (reassembled by Doctor Zoidberg from the discarded body parts), it melts down due to the accumulated residue of heavy spices from LaBarbara's cooking. Roberto appears again in the series' penultimate episode \\"Stench and Stenchibility\\". =Robot Devil= The Robot Devil (voiced by Dan Castellaneta in regular appearances, Maurice LaMarche in \\"A Tale of Two Santas\\") serves as the leader of Robot Hell, which is hidden beneath the \\"Inferno\\" ride at the amusement park \\"Reckless Ted's Funland\\" in New Jersey. His function is to torment robots who have committed various sins under the practice of Robotology. If a deal is made with the Robot Devil, he appears to have unlimited power and can grant almost any request. The voice acting of the Robot Devil by Dan Castellaneta has been described as a \\"bravura performance\\" on his part. The Robot Devil is available as a build-a-figure from the first three series of Futurama action figures by Toynami. He first appears in \\"Hell Is Other Robots\\", kidnapping Bender and tormenting him until Fry and Leela manage to save Bender. He plays another major role in \\"The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings\\", in which Fry makes a deal with the Devil to improve his holophonor skills. Fry wins the Robot Devil's hands, though the Robot Devil manages to reverse the trade after setting up a complicated scheme to force Fry into relinquishing them. The character also makes brief cameos in \\"A Tale of Two Santas\\" and \\"Crimes of the Hot\\". In the episode \\"The Silence of the Clamps\\" he is shown as one of the wedding guests. He plays a key role in the Season 6 episode \\"Ghost in the Machines\\", offering to reunite Bender's body and spirit if Bender scares Fry to death. This same episode reveals that he keeps several spare bodies in his office and can transfer his spirit to one of these if his body is destroyed. The Robot Devil appears in the film series on several occasions, most notably The Beast with a Billion Backs, where Bender makes a deal with the Robot Devil exchanging his first-born son for the Armies of Hell. Bender more than happily locates his son and kicks the child into a vat of lava, causing the Robot Devil to comment, \\"That was pretty brutal, even by my standards.\\" Bender simply replies, \\"No backsies!\\" In Bender's Big Score, he conducts the band at Lars and Leela's wedding. In the commentary for \\"The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings\\", Castellaneta says the voice is based on a \\"bad impression of Hans Conried\\". =Robot Santa= Robot Santa (voiced by John Goodman in the first appearance, John DiMaggio in later appearances) is a robot created in 2801 by The Friendly Robot Company to judge beings as naughty or nice and distribute presents or punishments accordingly. Due to a programming error, his standards are too high and he judges everyone to be naughty (with the one-time exception of Dr. Zoidberg). This leads him to go on destructive rampages across Earth every Xmas using Christmas-themed weapons, such as grenades shaped like Christmas ornaments, bicycle guns, and T.O.W. missile launchers (a weaponized retort to mistletoe) to punish the \\"naughty\\" beings. He resides in a death fortress on Neptune along with a number of Neptunians that act as slave labor for the toy factory. In Bender's Big Score, he assisted the Earth's population in reclaiming their planet after it was purchased by the devious Scammers, forcing his Neptunian elves to build weapons for an assault and participating personally in the ensuing battle. He is part of an alliance called The Trinity, a trio of holiday-themed madmen, comprising himself, Kwanzaabot, and the Chanukah Zombie in the song. =Barbados Slim= Barbados Slim (voiced by John DiMaggio) is Hermes' arch- rival. He not only defeated Hermes at the 3004 Olympics to win the gold medal in limbo, but is also the only person ever to win gold medals in both limbo and sex. He was formerly married to LaBarbara Conrad, who still refers to him as a \\"mahogany god\\". In Futurama: Bender's Big Score, after Hermes was decapitated in a limboing accident, LaBarbara left him (believing as a head in a jar he would not be able to provide for her) and got back together with Barbados, even going so far as to take his last name (Dwight also took his last name), even though they never remarried and Dwight was never adopted. After Hermes uses his bureaucratic prowess to save Earth from the scammers and wins back LaBarbara (and gets a new body), Slim vows \\"You have not seen the last of Barbados Slim!\\" before adding \\"Now goodbye forever!\\" As he prepares to leave the bridge, the sliding door malfunctions and goes down halfway. Slim then tries to limbo beneath only for the door to fall and crush his chest. Other recurring characters =Abner Doubledeal= Doubledeal (voiced by Tom Kenny) is a businessman usually depicted organising or owning various sporting events, to which he would recruit various season regulars. He first appeared in \\"Raging Bender\\" as the owner of the Ultimate Robot Fighting League, and later in \\"A Leela of Her Own\\" as owner of the New New York Mets blernsball team. He was a television producer in \\"Yo Leela Leela\\", at the end of which he adopted all of the orphans from Cookieville Minimum-Security Orphanarium to help him produce Leela's show Rumbledy-hump; and by the time of the events of \\"The Butterjunk Effect\\" episode Doubledeal was in charge of the Butterfly Derby. The character's name is a reference to Abner Doubleday, a US Civil War general who was alleged to have invented the game of baseball. =Amazons= The Amazons first appear in \\"Brannigan Begin Again\\" but first feature in \\"Amazon Women in the Mood\\" when Zapp, Leela, Amy and Kif are stranded on their planet. The Amazons are primitives who live in huts, and they are ruled by a female computer called \\"Femputer\\" (voiced by Bea Arthur). Femputer is revealed to be a fembot operating the giant computer facade from a small control room. =Antonio Calculon= Calculon (voiced by Maurice LaMarche) is an acting robot renowned for his melodramatic roles and his dramatic speaking style. His most famous role is as the lead character in the long-running robot soap opera All My Circuits. It is claimed in \\"The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings\\" that Calculon received his acting ability from the Robot Devil. Calculon is from the 21st century, having been created as a standard industrial robot called Calculon 1.0. He changes his name and appearance every few decades to conceal his true age, claiming that one of his disguises was David Duchovny. In the episode \\"The Honking\\", it is revealed that his first job was as a motorised service arm building the most evil car in existence, Project Satan. Calculon was run over by Project Satan, and became a were-car (the robot equivalent of a werewolf). The curse is broken at the end of the episode, when Project Satan is destroyed. It is revealed in \\"Bender Should Not Be Allowed on TV\\" that throughout his entire time on All My Circuits, he has only ever done one take for each scene. In \\"Bend Her\\", Calculon begins a relationship with Coilette of Robonia, who is actually Bender after undergoing gender reassignment to become a Fembot. He becomes smitten with Coilette, who is merely using him for material gain. Calculon proposes to Coilette, who accepts and then decides that she cannot continue the deception, and subsequently fakes her death at their wedding. In the conclusion of the episode, Coilette undergoes surgery to become a Manbot again, and Calculon makes a film in tribute to Coilette. It is shown in The Beast With A Billion Backs that Calculon is the leader of the League of Robots, a robot supremacy society. Bender cheats in a duel with Calculon, resulting in the loss of one of Calculon's arms and the destruction of the league's headquarters. Calculon subsequently becomes outraged at Bender and resigns from the league, relinquishing the presidency to Bender. In Into The Wild Green Yonder, it is said that his operating system is Windows Vista. In re-airings of the movie on Comedy Central, he says his operating system is Windows 7. Calculon dies in \\"The Thief of Baghead\\" when he tries to defeat Langdon Cobb in the World Acting Championship after Leela and Bender advise him to do the Romeo and Juliet scene and give him water and food coloring. Unfortunately, food coloring is fatal to robots. Calculon decides the only way to win the award is to actually drink the food coloring and die. After he dies, Cobb wins the award instead of him, making his death pointless. Bender and Fry decide to revive Calculon after deciding that they do not care for his replacement on All My Circuits, Vaxtron. They journey to Robot Hell and obtain Calculon's soul from the Robot Devil. The Professor has the crew perform a series of ritualistic \\"scientific\\" tasks to put the soul of Calculon back in his body. After Calculon is brought back to life he returns to acting. He first performs a one-man show. When the show receives poor reviews, Calculon determines that maybe he should not be acting and should have remained in hell. Leela, who opposed Calculon's return to acting, now wants to help him return to All My Circuits. She explains that he should go to an audition in disguise to play Calculon for the show. When he lands the part, Calculon returns to his former ways. Leela then makes him feel bad by saying that he has no acting skills, and that the world had forgotten he had even been alive within the first month of his death. She then explains to Bender and Fry that it was a ploy to save his part in the show. The show crew is smitten by his down-to-earth acting skills, and he reveals himself as Calculon. As he takes a bow, once again thinking that his life is worth living, a massive lighting fixture falls, crushing him. His life as Calculon 2.0 is honored; he watches the ceremony in Robot Hell where his soul resides once more. =Celebrity heads= Various celebrities and historical figures are kept alive as heads in jars of liquids. The technology is crucial to Futuramas connection with 20th- and 21st-century culture since it allows significant figures from the past to make appearances in the series. This also allows for contemporary celebrities to make guest appearances as themselves. The technology was invented by Ron Popeil, himself a head.\\"A Big Piece of Garbage\\" People seem to be able to be resurrected using this technology, as every U.S. President is found in the \\"Head Museum\\"; the most prominent head is that of Richard Nixon who becomes the President of Earth. =The Hyper-Chicken Lawyer= The Hyper-Chicken Lawyer (voiced by Maurice LaMarche) is a large blue/green rooster-like chicken with southern mannerisms and a pince-nez perched on his beak. He is an alien originally from what he describes as a \\"backwoods asteroid.\\" The show never reveals the Hyper-Chicken Lawyer's name (or the non-existence thereof); in \\"Brannigan Begin Again\\", it is revealed that the Hyper-Chicken Lawyer's species is \\"hyper-chicken\\". In the commentary of \\"A Tale of Two Santas\\", David X. Cohen explains that the script simply used the designation \\"hyper-chicken\\" to refer to the character. He is a lawyer who has appeared both as a defense attorney and as a prosecutor. He is a terrible lawyer but despite his incompetence he sometimes manages to win his cases, and if he doesn't he usually tells his clients to plead insanity. The Hyper-Chicken Lawyer is a parodic cross between \\"folksy\\" country lawyers such as Matlock and Atticus Finch with Looney Tunes character Foghorn Leghorn. In a deleted scene from Into the Wild Green Yonder, he is named Matcluck. =Elzar= Elzar (voiced by John DiMaggio) is a famous four-armed Neptunian chef with his own New New York restaurant, \\"Elzar's Fine Cuisine\\", and television show. Elzar is rude, crass, and unpleasant, and has a very high opinion of himself. He never passes up an opportunity to milk money from his customers and fans. He has also been known to steal from his own cash register on occasion. Elzar's favorite cooking implement is his Spice Weasel, a mustelid-like creature which propels a cloud of spices from its snout upon having its body squeezed. Elzar often uses the phrases \\"Bam!\\", \\"knock it up a notch\\", and \\"no question\\". The character of Elzar is an allusion to Emeril Lagasse. =The Globetrotters= The Globetrotters are a race of basketball playing humans who reside on Globetrotter Planet. Aside from showboating basketball shenanigans, the Globetrotters are all known for their scientific prowess and have aided in saving both Earth and the Universe. The Globetrotters are commanded by Ethan 'Bubblegum' Tate. Other known core members include 'Sweet' Clyde Dixon, 'Curly' Joe, and 'Goosh', although there are several other unidentified members of the team seen throughout the series. Ethan 'Bubblegum' Tate Ethan 'Bubblegum' Tate (voiced by Phil LaMarr) is a renowned physicist and the leader of the Globetrotters, who once randomly challenged Earth to defend its honor by playing a game of basketball for no reason. (A parody of the film Space Jam, and also a reference to the Harlem Globetrotters cartoon series.) Tate is one of \\"the finest scientific minds in the universe\\", according to Professor Farnsworth. He is also a senior lecturer in physics at Globetrotter University. He has appeared in many episodes with the rest of the team, but also made a solo appearance in several episodes. 'Sweet' Clyde Dixon 'Sweet' Clyde Dixon (voiced by David Herman) is a core member of the Globetrotters, who excels at calculus and is another one of the \\"finest scientific minds in the universe\\". In \\"The Prisoner of Benda\\", he becomes a Duke. =Hattie McDoogal= Hattie McDoogal (voiced by Tress MacNeille) is an old woman who lives alone with her cats and often uses nonsense words and phrases, such as \\"kajigger\\" and \\"whatchacallit\\". She briefly serves as the landlady of Fry and Bender, and holds a single share of Planet Express, allowing her the decisive vote for its CEO. She has been married twice, surviving both of them, and often dates. She once hired Kif Kroker as a male escort. MacNeille also voices the Crazy Cat Lady on The Simpsons. =Hedonismbot= Hedonismbot (voiced by Maurice LaMarche) is a golden robot built in a lounging position that displays the typical characteristics of hedonism and decadence, such as constantly eating from a bowl of grapes on his stomach. He was first seen in \\"Crimes of the Hot\\" at the Galapagos Island Robot Party. He has a human servant named Djambi and he has stated that \\"I too have known unconventional love\\" with references to doomsday devices. He enjoys having a bath of chocolate, having his nipples rubbed with industrial sandpaper (and a power sander), and seeing how long he can remain entertained during an opera.The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings =Hypnotoad= The Hypnotoad is a large toad-like alien with pulsating, multicolored eyes, which emits a loud, ominous buzzing noise. It has the power to hypnotize almost any living thing at will, even mass numbers of creatures. The Hypnotoad first appeared in \\"The Day the Earth Stood Stupid\\", in which it hypnotized a flock of sheep to herd themselves into a pen and close the door behind them, the panel of judges to win the pet show and then the audience of the pet show to force their approval of that victory. It later acquired its own television show, Everybody Loves Hypnotoad, in which it hypnotizes the audience (except for Fry, due to his lack of a Delta brain wave and the fact that he feels the show has been going downhill since its third season). The Futurama: Bender's Big Score DVD includes a full 22-minute episode.DVDtalk .com, Review: Futurama: Bender's Big ScoreCHUD.com , A film site for the brilliantTVshowsondvd.com , Futurama DVD news: Press Release for Futurama - Bender's Big Score The episode mainly features the Hypnotoad staring into the camera, occasionally intercut with a laugh track or shots of the exteriors of various locations to indicate a scene change. The finale of the show consists of a voiceover telling the audience that they will wake up remembering nothing and feeling refreshed, and the credits are all attributed to Hypnotoad. =Mayor C. Randall Poopenmeyer= Mayor C. Randall Poopenmeyer (Voiced by David Herman) is the mayor of New New York. He is often depicted as a corrupt and incompetent politician. He first appeared in the season 1 episode \\"A Big Piece of Garbage\\". Throughout the later seasons, he is seen having a rather open affair with the Queen of Yonkers. =Officer Smitty= Officer Smith, better known as Smitty (voiced by Billy West) is a policeman partnered with URL in New New York. He is sometimes seen with a lightsaber-like nightstick. The two often use excessive force in non-violent circumstances. In one episode, he claimed that he became a cop because his father owned a restaurant, and frequent dine-and-dashers kept it from going regional. Smitty retires later in Season 6 but returns a few episodes later. =Officer URL= Officer URL (pronounced Earl) (voiced by John DiMaggio) is a robot police officer paired with Smitty. The two often use excessive force in peaceful situations, and make use of various features built into URL, such as a siren, megaphone and violations printer. He also appears in the parody of Cops, called Cop Department. His catchphrase is \\"Aww, yeah.\\" In \\"Law and Oracle\\", URL becomes Fry's partner after he joins the police force. =Petunia= Petunia (voiced by Tress MacNeille) is an elderly woman who wears a revealing pink dress and uses a lot of make-up. She is a chain-smoker and a keen gambler. In the episode \\"Put Your Head on My Shoulders\\", Bender sets her up on a Valentine's Day date with Fry after setting up a dating agency. She rejects Fry after learning he does not have a body and is merely a head attached to Amy. Petunia states she can do better than a slot-player when Fry reveals he controls only one arm. Petunia later joins the Feministas in Into the Wild Green Yonder. She has children and used to live in a house with wheels. =Sal= Sal (voiced by John DiMaggio) is a surly, overweight, blue-collar worker with a thick Bronx accent. His first appearance is as a janitor on the Moon in \\"The Series Has Landed\\", servicing the machines in the amusement park. He has appeared many times since, always employed in a tedious job that he does not perform well. He is also seen to have a painting tattooed on his stomach (in \\"The Cryonic Woman\\") and comments that he is \\"on loan from the Louvre\\". His trademark is to add an \\"s\\" to many words that do not need it: \\"He's busteds. Gets hims outta heres!\\" At one point in \\"The Lost Adventure\\", it is implied that it is intentional, when he says \\"I gots an idea. I means, I gots an ideas.\\" David X. Cohen said in a commentary that the writers debate whether Sal frequently changes jobs or has been cloned many times. He was also featured in Bender's Game as the five-time winner of a demolition derby. After losing the derby, he promises to \\"changes\\" his life. =Tinny Tim= Tinny Tim (voiced by Tress MacNeille) is an ill-fated orphan-bot with a crutch for an arm and one shortened leg, a reference to Tiny Tim in Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol. He speaks with an English accent and is programmed to beg, sell oil-ade, and write in cute backwards letters on signs. He is shown with the Planet Express crew on both Xmases, and appears to be friends with Dwight and Cubert. In the subtitles of \\"Bender Should Not Be Allowed on TV\\", he is called \\"Tiny Tim-Bot\\". Guest characters =Al Gore= The former vice- president (voiced by himself) appears as a head in a jar during most of his appearances and also appears with his body during scenes involving Fry's time period. He is First Emperor of the Moon and has \\"ridden the mighty moon worm\\". He lives in an elaborate jar; the base is colored silver-white, and possesses several hologram projectors, two small rockets for mobility, a pair of lasers, and is backed with the top of a cape. He plays a role in Futurama: Bender's Big Score, where he appears in multiple scenes that take place in the past and during the space battle in the future. During one of these scenes, Gore was shown to have won the 2000 Presidential Election, but Bender accidentally destroys the ballots in favor of Gore when hunting for Fry. During the Clinton presidency he is shown to have led the Vice Presidential Action Rangers, a group tasked by the US Constitution to preserve the space-time continuum. The real-life Gore has said that Futurama is his favorite show. His daughter, Kristin Gore, was a writer for the show in its later seasons. Gore has also voiced the cartoon version of himself in \\"A Terrifying Message from Al Gore\\", the promotional video for An Inconvenient Truth along with John DiMaggio, the voice of Bender, and Billy West, the narrator. =Boxy= Boxy is a crude robot only able to communicate by beeping. He is frequently seen in the company of Calculon, and played the role of Calculon's half-brother in the All My Circuits soap opera where his objections sound like he's backing up. His noise is made by a synthesizer. =Brain Slugs= Brain Slugs are small, one- eyed, vaguely sluglike aliens which attach themselves to the heads of sentient beings in order to control them. Brain slugs apparently use this as a method of trapping more \\"prey\\", since those beings under brain slug control are driven by the desire to place brain slugs on other beings. It is hinted that the host under the brain slug's control retains awareness of their condition, which Hermes referred to as a \\"nightmare\\". The brain slug can be seen in numerous episodes, normally attached to Hermes. For a short time, Fry had one attached, but according to the professor, it \\"starved to death\\" due to Fry's low intelligence.Futurama, season two episode \\"Raging Bender\\". Retrieved August 8, 2015. =Brainspawn= The Brainspawn (voiced by David Herman) are a race of flying telepathic brains that wish to collect all of the data in the universe and kill all other intelligent beings, because the mere act of them thinking causes them great pain. They are able to use \\"stupefaction fields\\" to render all intelligent beings on a planet too stupid to resist them. This allows them to collect all knowledge on the planet and destroy it. Their main enemies are the Nibblonians, who send Nibbler on a mission to find Fry, the only being resistant to the Brainspawn. Fry lacks the delta brainwave, so he is able to repel the Brainspawn when they attack Earth. Fry later sends the Brainspawn and their space station, the Infosphere, into another dimension with a bomb given to him by the Nibblonians. =Cookieville Minimum-Security Orphanarium= The Cookieville Minimum-Security Orphanarium houses a large number of orphans, including Leela during her childhood. The orphans often suffer harsh conditions and various disappointing setbacks. It is run by Mr. Vogel, voiced by David Herman, who takes care of the orphans and keeps all records; he is apparently a bureaucrat grade 135 who has not been promoted since about the time Leela was born. Three orphans, Albert, Nina, and Sally, are featured most often. Albert and Nina are voiced by Kath Soucie and Sally is voiced by Nicole St. John. Sally has a third ear on her forehead which she is teased about by the other orphans. She also claims to have a tail. Twelve of the orphans were briefly adopted and later returned by Bender‚Äîwho adopted them only for the government fund checks‚Äîin \\"The Cyber House Rules\\". =Crushinator= The Crushinator (voiced by Maurice LaMarche) is the robot daughter of a farmer on the moon. She is stereotyped as a southern belle and represents Earth's moon in the Ms. Universe Pageant. She first appears in \\"Episode Two: The Series Has Landed\\" and also appears in the episodes \\"Lesser of Two Evils\\", \\"Crimes Of The Hot\\", \\"Mother's Day\\", and \\"The Silence of the Clamps\\". She briefly appears in the background in Into the Wild Green Yonder. Unlike her sisters, the Crushinator is more machine-like and has a masculine voice. She also has two orange tubes sticking out from her head and can transform into a car. =Father Changstein-El-Gamal= Father Changstein-El- Gamal (voiced by David Herman) is a priest in the First Amalgamated Church, a mixture of many 20th-century religions. He wears a bindi on his forehead (Hinduism), wears a mitre and clerical collar (Catholicism) with a taijitu (or yin-yang) symbol on the peak (Taoism), payot (Judaism), an orange wrap (Buddhism) with a shoulder scarf adorned with stars and moons (spiritism). In Bender's Big Score, he uses the phrases \\"dearly liked\\" instead of \\"dearly beloved\\" and \\"We are gathered here today before one or more gods, or fewer...\\" when officiating a wedding. =Flexo= Flexo (voiced by John DiMaggio) is a bending robot who looks and sounds almost exactly like Bender with the exception of having a small triangular metal goatee, a reference to the Star Trek mirror universe. Flexo first meets and befriends Bender in \\"Lesser of Two Evils\\". Fry believes Flexo to be an \\"evil twin\\" of Bender, though it turns out that Flexo attempts to stop Bender from stealing the expensive crown from the Miss Universe pageant. Flexo is mistaken for Bender and is arrested for that crime. Critics have called Flexo's appearance in this episode one of the \\"Great Moments\\" in Futurama. He returns in \\"Bendless Love\\" in which Bender briefly dates Flexo's ex-wife, Anglelyne, and impersonates Flexo. Flexo is targeted by the Robot Mafia because of this. Eventually, he reunites with Anglelyne. He makes a cameo appearance in Into The Wild Green Yonder along with Anglelyne as members of the audience seeing the Encyclopod being \\"born\\". He makes another brief appearance in \\"Attack of the Killer App\\" in a garbage bin, where he is found by Bender and tells him that bending robots are now obsolete, though he is ignored. His signature character trait is the way he says something, usually a mild insult, and then immediately retracts it, laughing and saying some variation of \\"Naw, I'm just kidding... you're all right!\\" This, apparently, is also reversed when referring to situations or actions that cause him frustration or anger, such as Bender shoving him in one episode, with Flexo responding by saying, \\"Thanks! I appreciated that... Naw I'm kidding. That was quite annoying.\\" =Grand Midwife= The Grand Midwife (voiced by Tress MacNeille) is an Amphibosian who first appears in the fourth- season episode \\"Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch\\". She is also known as the Grand Priestess, the Grand Lunch Lady, the Grand Funeral Director, and the Grand Butterfly Curator, as she holds these various titles and positions. She appears as an aged and wizened member of the Amphibosian race, appearing at and overseeing key functions throughout Amphibios 9, including Kif's birthing ceremony, Kif and Amy's wedding and Kif's funeral. She is often direct and inflexible in her ways and acts in a melodramatic fashion. =Guenter= Guenter (voiced by Tress MacNeille with the vocal effects provided by Frank Welker) is an intelligent monkey experiment made by Professor Farnsworth. His intelligence comes from his small hat which uses sunspots to create cognitive radiation. If he is not wearing the hat, he acts like a normal monkey. His first appearance was in the episode \\"Mars University\\" in which the Professor enrolls him at the university where he becomes Fry's roommate. Guenter later appears in the episode, \\"Fry and Leela's Big Fling\\", where he shows Amy Wong, Bender and Zoidberg around the planet Simian 7. Guenter is seen in other episodes in the background, and crowds. =Gypsy-Bot= The Gypsy-Bot (voiced by Tress MacNeille) is a carnival fortune-telling robot. In \\"Godfellas\\" the gypsy-bot hints that she does not actually have psychic powers; after Fry asks her a question, she replies, \\"What am I, psychic?\\". The gypsy-bot appears earlier in \\"The Honking\\", telling Bender he is a werecar; and in \\"Ghost in the Machines\\", performing a s√©ance in which Bender's ghost possesses her and causes her head to explode. =Headless Body of Agnew= The headless body of Spiro Agnew joins Nixon as the Vice-President of Earth, imitating his U.S version. Though he is headless, Agnew can still make growling noises. In \\"Into the Wild Green Yonder\\" Agnew is accidentally killed by the 'eco-feministas' (joined by Leela) when a run-away golf cart runs him over. However, he does get cloned, which leads him to be referred to by Nixon as 'The Headless Clone of Agnew'. =H.G. Blob= Horrible Gelatinous \\"H.G.\\" Blob (voiced by Maurice LaMarche) is a three-eyed, green, translucent, ill-tempered alien. He first appeared in the season one episode \\"The Series Has Landed\\" in a commercial the Professor made for Planet Express. He contemptuously refers to humanoids as \\"solids\\" and ridicules their one-way digestive system. In \\"The Route of All Evil\\", the Horrible Gelatinous Blob has a son named Brett Blob, who regularly bullies Cubert and Dwight. In Futurama: Bender's Big Score he, or someone of his species, appears on the twenty dollar bill. =Judge Ron Whitey= Judge Ron Whitey (voiced by Billy West) is a judge and a member of the upperclass of Earth's elite. =Kwanzaabot and Chanukah Zombie= Kwanzaabot and Chanukah Zombie are Robot Santa's Kwanzaa and Hanukkah analogues. Precisely what role they play on their respective holidays is unknown. In the episode \\"A Tale of Two Santas\\", Kwanzaabot mentions he has been distributing books titled \\"What the Hell is Kwanzaa?\\" for 647 years, with little effect. Kwanzaabot and Chanukah Zombie are evidently friendly with Robot Santa, as he calls them for support in Bender's Big Score, and Kwanzaabot invites Bender to join him and the Chanukah Zombie at the B'nai B'rith in \\"A Tale of Two Santas\\". From his first appearance, Kwanzaabot has been voiced by rapper Coolio. Although Chanukah Zombie had been mentioned, he did not appear onscreen until Bender's Big Score, in which he is voiced by Mark Hamill and in a reference to Hamill's famous role in Star Wars, pilots a Jewish themed TIE Fighter decorated with Stars of David on its solar arrays with a Menorah standing on its core. =Malfunctioning Eddie= Malfunctioning Eddie (voiced by David Herman) is a robot that runs a hovercar dealership. His character refers to the real life electronics chain Crazy Eddie, and its mascot of the same name. It turned out that Malfunctioning Eddie's prices were so low that he really was insane. He had an exploding-problem associated with surprise in \\"Insane in the Mainframe\\". =Michelle= Michelle (voiced by Kath Soucie in the first appearance, Sarah Silverman in the second appearance) is Fry's on and off girlfriend from the 20th century. She dumps Fry shortly before he is frozen on New Year's Eve for a man named Constantine (called Charles in \\"The Cryonic Woman\\", whom she later marries). They eventually split up, and she decides to freeze herself to try again in the distant future. She wakes up in 3002, meets Fry again, and restarts her relationship with him. She fails to fit into the 31st-century life to which Fry has become so accustomed, and so asks him to freeze himself with her for another thousand years. This plan fails, as does the rekindled relationship, so Fry leaves her. She later is shown in a limousine with the recently unfrozen Pauly Shore and later seen holding his hand in \\"Proposition Infinity\\". In Bender's Big Score, it is revealed that Michelle had been frozen roughly 736 years longer than she had actually intended, a result of Fry (as Lars) using her cryotube to return to the future and be with Leela. This, along with the fact that Fry had accidentally broken off part of Michelle's hair while climbing into her cryotube, was not mentioned or shown in Michelle's previous appearances. She was one of the many people seen on the date with Yivo in The Beast With a Billion Backs. =Nibblonians= The Nibblonians are an ancient race that came into existence 17 years before the moment of the Big Bang. They have extremely long life spans, eat animals whole to fill their stomachs, which are thousands of times larger than themselves, and excrete extremely dense and potent dark matter. Despite their nature, other beings find their small stature to be extremely adorable. Their arch-enemy is the Brainspawn. They believe Fry is the only hope of the universe in that he can stop the Brainspawn due to his lack of the Delta brainwave. The main Nibblonians in the series are Nibbler, Ken, voiced by Billy West, and Fiona, voiced by Tress MacNeille. =Nine= A man who wears a white gown with a large number 9 on it. He is voiced by David Herman and is a cameo character appearing in the first and second production seasons of Futurama. He reappeared in Bender's Big Score and Into the Wild Green Yonder, where it was revealed he was the Grand Curator of the Legion of Mad Fellows. When Nine became grand curator is unknown, but the audio commentary track for Into the Wild Green Yonder hints that he was in the Legion prior to the year 3000. As grand curator (which is essentially a knowledgeable leader) of the Legion, he becomes the story teller for Philip J. Fry's mission to possibly end the epic long battle between two ancient races, as they by 3009 have noticed that the Chi have been re-emerging. It is later revealed in \\"Murder On the Planet Express\\" that he operates a discount spy store called For Your Eyes Mainly. =Mr. Panucci= Mr. Panucci (voiced by John DiMaggio) is the surly Italian-American owner of Panucci's Pizza where Fry worked before getting frozen. Although in the first episode it appears that he does not like Fry that much, it is shown in later episodes that he had a strong friendship with and acted as a father figure to Fry. It is revealed in Bender's Big Score that he likes Fry because Fry's life is so horrible it helps Panucci feel better about himself. Panucci is noticeably upset when Fry goes missing and he takes responsibility for Fry's pet dog Seymour Asses (named as such after Fry feeds the dog pizza delivered because of a prank phone call). In Bender's Big Score, Fry creates a time paradox by going back in time and living out his old life and thus continues working at Panucci's Pizza. Shortly after he arrives, Fry asks Panucci if he can live in Panucci's upstairs storeroom, which Panucci allows. =Pazuzu= Pazuzu (voiced by David Herman) is a gargoyle who Professor Farnsworth owned and put through college. He has a French accent and a son. He initially appears in \\"Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles\\", where he escapes from the Professor. He returns at the end of the episode to rescue the Professor and \\"earn [his] freedom.\\" He later appears in Beast With a Billion Backs, rescuing the Professor and Wernstrom from prison and informing the Professor that he has one wish left. =Randy Munchnik= Randy Munchnik (voiced by John DiMaggio) is a stereotypically gay man dressed in pink, who speaks in an effeminate voice. Originally, he is depicted with blond hair, but sometimes appears with brown hair. John DiMaggio says he is his favorite character to voice. The original design for Randy was very different. He was originally an old man in a mob, with his name in the script for \\"I, Roommate\\" literally \\"Man in Mob\\". DiMaggio changed the voice and therefore the character.Futurama Season 2, Episode 9 - \\"Why Must I be a Crustacean in Love?\\" episode commentary =Reverend Lionel Preacherbot= Reverend Lionel Preacherbot (voiced by Phil LaMarr) is a preacher at the Temple of Robotology. He presides over weddings and funerals of robots and humans. His speech patterns, accent, and mannerisms are modeled on those of stereotypical African-American Evangelical preachers (specifically, black churches). In the episode \\"Hell is Other Robots\\" (S01E09), Preacherbot encourages Bender to give up his addiction to recreational electricity (i.e. 'jacking on') in favour of the Church of Robotology, to which Bender replies; \\"Do I preach to you while you're laying stoned in the gutter?\\". During the Season 6 episode \\"Ghost in the Machines\\", Preacherbot performs an exorcism on the Planet Express headquarters in order to drive off Bender's ghost, which has begun to possess various machinery in an attempt to kill Fry. =Sewer mutants= Sewer mutants are humans mutated by years of pollution and radioactive waste poured into the sewers under New New York. Because they are considered genetically inferior they were forbidden by law to travel to the surface without special permission (until the events of \\"The Mutants Are Revolting\\"), so they reside in a community made out of objects flushed down toilets. Among the more prominent mutants in the series are Dwayne, Raoul and Vyolet. Dwayne (voiced by David Herman) is a mutant with two noses and a large forehead. Raoul (voiced by Maurice LaMarche) is the \\"Supreme Mutant\\", the democratically elected leader of the sewer mutants. His most notable mutation is a third arm, which in his first appearance had grown in place of his right ear but above it in later appearances. Vyolet (voiced by Tress MacNeille) is a chain-smoking mutant with gills and a pig nose; she seems to be romantically involved with Raoul. =Stephen Hawking= Stephen Hawking (voiced by himself) made a guest appearance in the episode \\"Anthology of Interest I\\" as a member of the Vice Presidential Action Rangers (VPAR), who guard the space-time continuum. Along with Hawking at the end of the twentieth century they include Al Gore, Nichelle Nichols, Gary Gygax and their summer intern Deep Blue. He first appears as a customer at the pizzeria where Fry mistakenly believes him to have invented gravity for which Hawking accepts credit (\\"Yeah, sure. Why not?\\"). After learning of Fry's inter-dimensional experience, he arranges for him to be kidnapped by the VPAR. Hawking also appears in The Beast with a Billion Backs as his own head in a flying jar, leading a scientific convention organized to study and discuss a tear in the universe. He says that despite writing a book about it, he has no idea what it is, although he has already cashed the check he got for writing it. Apparently he has the ability to shoot lasers that stun people from his eyes; he himself is surprised, remarking, \\"I didn't know I could do that\\" after stunning Professor Farnsworth and Professor Wernstrom. Due to a debilitating, long-term illness, Hawking was unable to speak with his own larynx, but his computer-assisted speech device was a trademark voice in popular culture.  Films' characters  = Nudist Alien Scammers = The Nudist Alien Scammers are the main antagonist of Bender's Big Score. They are a group formed by the leader, Nudar (voiced by David Herman), and his brothers, Fleb (voiced by Frank Welker) and Schlump (voiced by Maurice LaMarche). They seek to seize the Earth by obtaining as much information as possible from humans, in addition to seizing all the valuable objects of the planet thanks to the time travel code. After they took over Earth, their fleet of solid gold Death Stars was destroyed by Earth's remaining ships in an assault led by Leela and coordinated by Hermes. Nudar escaped the destruction, but he was killed by the sacrifice of Lars Filmore, a temporal paradox duplicate of Fry. = Lars Fillmore = Lars Fillmore (voiced by Billy West) is a technician at the Head Museum in Bender's Big Score, where he met Leela and briefly dated her. He was about to marry Leela, until he discovered that a paradox can not be in the normal time line, and decided to cancel the wedding, because he was really a paradox-duplicate of Fry created when the original Fry who had travelled back to 2000 went back a second time to eat a pizza, the original Fry who went back for the pizza freezing himself after a close call with a brainwashed Bender while the one who never did that moved into an apartment above the pizzeria where he worked. He lived there for twelve years, during which he spent time with his family and befriended the narwhal Leelu, until an assassination attempt by another brainwashed Bender burned away his hair and damaged his larynx. After the war with the scammers was over, Nudar tried to force Lars to reveal his version of the time-travel code, but Lars sacrificed himself to release another frozen Bender set to self-destruct, killing himself and Nudar. = Leelu = Leelu (voiced by Maurice LaMarche) is a narwhal that Fry befriended in Bender's Big Score during the years he spent in the past. Throughout the years, their relationship blossomed, and they became best of friends. Fry was heartbroken when he learned that Leelu was being released into the wild. = Yivo = Yivo (voiced by David Cross) is a sentient extraterrestrial being from another universe who appears in The Beast with a Billion Backs. He communicated with universe \\"gamma\\" through the space- time hole, using his tentacles, which he used initially to mate with humans. He begins a \\"romantic relationship\\" with the inhabitants of the other universe, but even after the universe agreed to move in with Yivo, Yivo 'broke up' with the universe when Fry sent a letter back through the rift to Bender, as Yivo couldn't stand the idea of anyone making contact with the original universe. = Colleen O'Hallahan = Colleen O'Hallahan (voiced by Brittany Murphy) is the chief of police and Fry's girlfriend in The Beast with a Billion Backs. A polyamorist, she lived with four other men which Fry was unable to cope with, causing him to break up with her. = The Dark One = The Dark One (voiced by Phil LaMarr) is the main antagonist of Into the Wild Green Yonder. He is a creature with the intention of ending the universe, and the last of his species. Towards the end of the film it is discovered that he is really the desert muck leech that lived on Mars, and that Leela welcomed as a pet to prevent his death. He is ultimately defeated and eaten by Zoidberg.

He is a Member of the National Assembly of Pakistan from NA-58 (Rawalpindi-II). He currently resides in Sanghar House, Gujar Khan. Prior to be elevated as Prime minister, he previously served as the Minister for Water and Power in the Yousaf Raza Gillani-led government from March 2008 to February 2011. A senior- ranking leader in the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) from Rawalpindi District, Ashraf assumed premiership on 22 June 2012 after Yousaf Raza Gillani was disqualified over contempt of court charges. Shortlisted by the PPP as a candidate for the post, he was eventually elected based on a 211‚Äì89 vote in the National Assembly. Tackling the corruption scandals, one of the major achievements during his premiership was his interest to develop and implement hydro projects in particular Neelum-Jhelum project of 970 MW. The project had received a big jolt when the Chinese Exim Bank refused to release $448 million loan linking it to the restoration of the Safe City Project in Islamabad which has been stopped by the Supreme Court of Pakistan. During his tenure Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) had launched a number of mega and medium- sized projects in Gilgit‚ÄìBaltistan. Personal life and childhood Raja Pervaiz Ashraf was born on 26 December 1950 in Sanghar, interior Sindh. He graduated from the University of Sindh in 1970 and was involved in agriculture before entering politics. He is married to Nusrat Pervaiz Ashraf and has four children, which include two sons and two daughters. Ashraf belongs to the Minhas clan of Pakhral and is originally from Gujar Khan, an industrial town in the Rawalpindi District of the Potohar region in northern Punjab. The Potohar region is home to numerous prominent political and military personalities. Ashraf comes from a middle class Potohari-speaking family of landowners who have had a traditional background in politics. An uncle of his served as a minister in the cabinet of Ayub Khan during the 1960s. His parents owned agricultural land in the town of Sanghar in Sindh, where he was born and brought up.Raja Pervez Ashraf: the new leader, Daily Times. Ashraf is multilingual and can fluently speak English, Urdu, Punjabi and Potwari and Sindhi. Political career He is regarded as an important PPP loyalist and leader in the Rawalpindi region. He contested parliamentary elections in 1990, 1993 and 1997. He won in elections held in 2002 and then in 2008, following which he was appointed as federal minister for water, and as power minister in the cabinet of Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani. Raja Ashraf on a hoarding =Member of Parliament= Ashraf has been twice elected Member of the National Assembly of Pakistan (MNA) from his constituency of Gujar Khan, Rawalpindi District. He won re-election in the February 2008 elections. During his time as an MNA, he served as a member of the Standing Committee on Kashmir and the Standing Committee on Law, Justice and Human Rights. Before his ascendance to the post of prime minister, he was also the secretary general of the PPP. =Water and Power ministry= He became the head of the Water and Power Ministry in the coalition government of PPP, PML-N, ANP, JUI-F and MQM formed after the 2008 elections. During his tenure as power minister, there was a chronic shortage of electricity generation throughout the country and power cuts (load shedding) remained frequent. In the position, he faced heavy criticism for repeatedly promising the country's power crisis would be over \\"by 2008\\" as the country suffered regular blackouts. He became one of the most sought after ministers in the National Assembly, by legislators who demanded answers for the power crisis. According to a report on his parliamentary performance, the water and power ministry while Ashraf was in-charge received as many as 1,147 official questions and queries, of which only 60% were responded to. The report opined that Ashraf's performance as minister was \\"tainted by failures to overcome the power shortfall that continued to aggravate even after he was replaced\\" and that his actions and responses both inside and outside the National Assembly had \\"not been translated into actions\\" Nevertheless, about 3,570 megawatts of power was added to the national grid during the PPP government, a major portion of which came during Ashraf's term in office. His term is said to have overseen relatively more megawatts being added to the national grid when compared to other ministers of power and energy since Benazir Bhutto's last government. He was accused of receiving kickbacks in the rental power projects, and of using illegal money to buy foreign property. Ashraf denied the charges, and as of June 2012, was defending himself before the Supreme Court. No official charges have been framed against him as no evidence could be presented so far. One of the main reasons for power crisis, which have never received due attention and focus is the circular debt and which continued to increase over the years. The government has time and again tried to clear the circular debt, however it comes again. This is because of the structural issues including power theft, poor recovery from other government departments, difference between cost of generation and actual cost charged to customer. During Ashraf's government prioritised hydro power projects in particular Neelum Jhelum 970 MW. During his term, WAPDA initiated several hydro projects in Gilgit Baltistan (GB) including the Satpara Dam having 17 MW power generation capacity and 0.093 million acre feetwater storage capacity and Diamer-Bhasha Dam having 4,500 MW power generation capacity and 8.1 million acre feet water storage capacity, along with hydropower projects of 7,100 MW Bunji, 34 MW Harpo, 80 MW Phandar and 40 MW Basho. Hydro power is the cheapest energy source and as Minister and PM he gave special attention, however hydro power projects take long time to complete and the electricity from the projects will be available after 10 years. To resolve short term energy crisis, Ashraf implemented power project on rental basis, following the rental policy approved in Mushrrafs tenure. However the projects became controversial. Prime Minister of Pakistan =Early days= On 26 April 2012, Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani was convicted of being in contempt of court for refusing to bring charges against President Asif Ali Zardari. On 19 June 2012, Gillani was retroactively ruled ineligible to hold the office by the Supreme Court. The ruling Pakistan People's Party nominated textile minister Makhdoom Shahabuddin to replace Gillani, but the nomination failed when the Anti-Narcotics Force issued a warrant for Shahabuddin's arrest on drug charges. Ashraf was then selected as the party's next option. On 22 June 2012, Raja Pervez Ashraf was elected Prime Minister of Pakistan by a 211‚Äì89 vote. Ashraf and his cabinet were sworn in on the same day. His selection as Prime Minister restored the country's government after several days of turmoil where officially the country was without a government. The Associated Press said Ashraf's election was \\"unlikely to calm the tensions roiling the country\\" and noted that many observers expected him to eventually be ousted like his predecessor. Political analyst Raza Rumi said Ashraf was likely chosen by the PPP because they knew he would not last long. On 24 July 2012, the government informed the Supreme Court, one day before expiry of the court's deadline, that it had not taken a decision on reopening of the graft cases against President Zardari. =Socioeconomic challenges= Immediately after his election, Ashraf said that the economy, inflation, and the country's power crisis would be his top concerns. \\"Our country cannot afford politics of confrontation at this time,\\" he said. Within 24 hours of being elected, Ashraf held a meeting to resolve the energy crisis in the country and directed the Ministry of Petroleum to ensure the supply of 28,000 tonnes of fuel daily to power plants, so as to add 1200 mega watts to the national grid system. There were power protests erupting throughout the country for continual load shedding. The Pakistan Economy Watch (PEW) was critical of this renewed focus on energy, calling it a \\"useless effort\\" with the president of PEW, Murtaza Mughal, remarking that load shedding had only \\"increased in the harrowing summer\\", making life difficult for the ordinary citizen; Mughal further noted that the announcement of adding more fuel into independent power producers had been portrayed positively, despite the fact that the actual problem did not lie in scarcity of fuel but rather in non-payment of dues. Businesspeople and economists in Pakistan had a mixed response to Ashraf's appointment; while some appreciated the prime minister's focus on the energy crisis and hoped for greater cooperation between key institutions and political parties as being good for economic stability, others questioned his reputation related to rental power and expressed anxiety over the government's ongoing clash with the judiciary which could cause uncertainty and scare businesses away. A government official praised the smooth transition of power and said that the country's economic policy would stay the same, adding that the government's economic team will carry on with implementing the budget and other economic functions as present before Gillani's disqualification. As an initiative to overcome the energy crises, Ashraf announced his intention to build several small dams across the country. He said that these projects would start from his native Potohar plateau, as part of a development programme for the Potohar region. Apart from energy, he identified the deteriorating law and order situation of Karachi, especially with regards to target killings, as a second major challenge. In September 2012, during his maiden trip to Gilgit-Baltistan, Ashraf announced a Rs. 2 billion development package for the region. On 12 July 2012, The Supreme Court in its NRO implementation case order has ruled that Prime Minister Raja Pervaiz Ashraf must write the letter to Swiss authorities to reopen graft cases against President Asif Ali Zardari. On 25 July 2012, The Supreme Court gave Raja Pervaiz Ashraf to 8 August 2012 to implement its order by writing a letter to Swiss authorities to reopen graft cases against President Asif Ali Zradari. On 8 August 2012, the supreme court adjourned the hearing till 18 September 2012. =Political developments= Three days after his election, Ashraf visited Nine Zero and met with leaders of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement in Karachi. He also visited the leader of the Pakistan Muslim League (F). The visits were seen as part of a fresh move to reaffirm ties with coalition political parties. The first significant milestone Ashraf performed after taking charge of his office was an approval for the creation of a post of Deputy Prime Minister of Pakistan to fulfill a demand of the coalition party Pakistan Muslim League (Q) (PML-Q). The post was inaugurated on 25 June and Chaudhry Pervez Elahi of PML-Q was appointed as the first deputy prime minister of the country. However, the position is largely symbolic and has no legal constitutional duties. On 27 June 2012, the Supreme Court of Pakistan gave prime minister Ashraf two weeks to indicate whether he would ask Swiss authorities to reopen corruption cases against president Zardari. However, Ashraf stated that his position on the issue was no different from that of previous prime minister Gillani. In the first week of July, he directed attention on the Balochistan conflict and called for a high-level meeting to discuss the issue of missing persons in the province. In the first week of July, Ashraf announced the government's plans to establish legislation which would remove the bar on dual nationality holders from contesting in elections. If passed, the legislation would enable Overseas Pakistanis holding dual nationalities eligible to participate in elections and hold public office. The enforcement of such a legislation remains a controversial issue. He made a visit to Peshawar a few days later, where he met local politicians, during which he expressed his views on the parliament being \\"the mother of all institutions\\". He has praised the role of democracy in creating an \\"independent media, judiciary and parliament.\\" He further paid tribute to the Pakistan Army in its role in the War on Terror and military operations in the troubled northwestern areas. In the fraud case against Asif Ali Zardari, he indicated in September 2012 that he would be willing to open the pending fraud cases. =Foreign policy= When commenting on foreign policy after assuming premiership, Ashraf said that he wanted to deal with the United States on \\"an equal footing\\". However, he will likely have to deal with the court's demands to charge Zardari before doing much else. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of India congratulated Ashraf shortly after his election, and anticipated greater progress in bilateral relations between the two countries during Ashraf's term. The Chinese government greeted Ashraf and pledged closer ties with Pakistan to strengthen their \\"all-weather friendship\\". Other notable messages of congratulation came from U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Afghan president Hamid Karzai. On 24 June 2012, several Tehrik-i-Taliban militants from Afghanistan entered Pakistan's bordering tribal areas killing 13 Pakistani troops, of which seven were beheaded. During the conflict, Pakistani troops killed fourteen of the raiding militants. The attack, one of several such cross-border skirmishes, was strongly condemned with Raja Pervaiz Ashraf stating that the matter would be directly taken to Afghan president Hamid Karzai. Regarding his stand on the Kashmir conflict with India, Ashraf has categorically stated that Pakistan would continue providing moral, political, and diplomatic support to the Kashmiri people of Jammu and Kashmir until a solution was to be reached for the issue in accordance with UN resolutions and Kashmiri aspirations. Ashraf is expected to visit Kabul, Afghanistan, to hold talks with the Afghan leadership on the peace process in Afghanistan amidst the ongoing Afghan war and to discuss the status of Afghan-led reconciliation with the Afghan Taliban. The visit comes at a time when Pakistan's relations with the United States have improved in the aftermath of the 2011 NATO attack. On 15 July, he performed a two-day state visit to Saudi Arabia, his first official tour since becoming prime minister. During the visit, he would perform Umrah, meet with King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, discuss the status of relations between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia and also meet members of the Pakistani community in Saudi Arabia. On his visit to Kabul, Afghanistan, in late July 2012, Ashraf met with Karzai government officials and engaged in talks with the two main opposition leaders Abdullah Abdullah from the National Coalition of Afghanistan and Ahmad Zia Massoud from the National Front of Afghanistan. Among other things they discussed the need for increased and regular dialogue between leaders of Afghanistan and Pakistan.Ashraf in Kabul On 30 March, the apex court had directed the National Accountability Bureau to proceed against those who were in the post of minister for water and power from 2006 till the next general elections. As a result, on 20 April, NAB issued arrest warrants for 33 persons, including Ashraf. Controversies =Arrest order= On 15 January 2013, the Supreme Court of Pakistan ordered the arrest of Raja Pervaiz Ashraf for alleged corruption as Ashraf was accused of kickbacks from rental power plants that were part of a project intended to serve as part of the solution to Pakistan's power problems. The media derided Raja Pervaiz Ashraf as Rental Raja.Raja Pervaiz Ashraf ‚ÄòRaja Rental‚Äô History The arrest order came at the same time as the Long March culminated in the national capital of Islamabad. None of the accused in the rental case has been convicted so far. The rental power case is pending with independent Supreme court for nearly four years and no conviction has been made. Ashraf has time and again demanded clearance of his name and denies all the charges. Ashraf in his appearance in the Supreme Court categorically denied such charges and offered his complete cooperation with all authorities and courts. A member of the ruling Pakistan People's Party referred to the arrest order as \\"a conspiracy\\" while Pakistan's interior minister Rehman Malik, claimed that \\"Even after this order, (Ashraf) is the prime minister and, God willing, he will continue as prime minister.\\" The accountability court in Islamabad indicted former Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf and six others in the rental power case on 16 January 2014. =Nepotism= Raja Pervez Ashraf appointed his son-in-law Raja Azeem in World Bank (Executive Director-Pakistan and others) in violation of rules and an example of Nepotism prevalent in Pakistani political elite.

Kirloskar was born on March 31, 1843, at Gurlhosur in Belgaum district to a Karhade Brahmin family. After completing schooling in his native place, at the age of twenty, Annasaheb moved to Pune to pursue further education. His overwhelming interest, however, lay in theatre and he faced parental pressure for his continued disinterest in formal education. His father pressurised him to return to his native Belgaum. To support himself, Kirloskar then worked for eight years as a school teacher in Belgaum; he subsequently worked for a few years in the police department and then as a clerk in the revenue commissioner's office. Despite his lack of much formal education, Kirloskar was well-versed in Sanskrit literature. Marathi theater history In 1843, the same year in which Kirloskar's was born, Vishnudas Bhave pioneered presentation of Marathi plays by staging the play Seeta Swayamwar (‡§∏‡•Ä‡§§‡§æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡§Ø‡§Ç‡§µ‡§∞), the Raja of the princely state of Sangli being then in attendance among the audience. While working as a school teacher in Belgaum, Kirloskar established Bharatshastrottejak Mandali (‡§≠‡§∞‡§§‡§∂‡§æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡•ã‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡•á‡§ú‡§ï ‡§Æ‡§Ç‡§°‡§≥‡•Ä) in 1866. Seven years later, he completed composition of his first prose play Shri Shankar Digvijay (‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä‡§∂‡§æ‡§Ç‡§ï‡§∞ ‡§¶‡§ø‡§ó‡•ç‡§µ‡§ø‡§ú‡§Ø) for public presentation by Kolhapurkar Natak Mandali (‡§ï‡•ã‡§≤‡•ç‡§π‡§æ‡§™‡•Ç‡§∞ ‡§®‡§æ‡§ü‡§ï ‡§Æ‡§Ç‡§°‡§≥‡•Ä). Around 1874, he founded Kirloskar Natak Mandali (‡§ï‡§ø‡§∞‡•ç‡§≤‡•ã‡§∏‡•ç‡§ï‡§∞ ‡§®‡§æ‡§ü‡§ï ‡§Æ‡§Ç‡§°‡§≥‡•Ä). In 1879, playwright and producer Trilokekar independently presented his musical play Nal-Damayanti (‡§®‡§≤-‡§¶‡§Æ‡§Ø‡§Ç‡§§‡•Ä) to Marathi public. It was the first musical play on Marathi stage. =Shakuntal= Kirloskar felt inspired to produce a similar musical play in Marathi in a full-fledged manner. Accordingly, translating into Marathi the first four acts of Kalidas's renowned Sanskrit play Abhidnyan Shakuntalam or \\"Abhij√±ƒÅnashƒÅkuntala\\" (‡§Ö‡§≠‡§ø‡§ú‡•ç‡§û‡§æ‡§®‡§∂‡§æ‡§ï‡•Å‡§Ç‡§§‡§≤‡§Ç), he presented them on stage in 1880 as a musical play titled Shakuntal (‡§∂‡§æ‡§ï‡•Å‡§Ç‡§§‡§≤). The next year, he translated the remaining three acts of Abhidnyan Shakuntalam and staged the entire play. He performed in the play himself. Kirloskar incredibly included 198 musical pieces in his Marathi Shakuntal. They consisted of a mix of Hindustani and Carnatic classical music, and lighter music. =Saubhadra= One year later, in 1882, Kirloskar presented on stage his musical Saubhadra (‡§∏‡•å‡§≠‡§¶‡•ç‡§∞). This play too contained well over 100 musical pieces, and once again he acted in the play. Because of its multifaceted quality, Saubhadra surpassed even the high popularity of Shakuntal. Innumerable performances of these two plays have been presented by different performing groups to the Marathi audience since their premiere 130 years ago. =Ram Rajya Wiyog= In 1884, Kirloskar presented to the audience the first three acts of his musical Ram Rajya Wiyog. Before he could finish writing the planned remaining three acts of this play, he died in 02 NOVEMBAR 1885 at age 42. Marathi theater companies Kirloskar Natak Mandali founded by Anna Saheb in 1880 was the pioneer and breakthrough performing company in Marathi theater.India's Shakespeare: Translation, Interpretation, and Performance edited by Poonam Trivedi And Dennis Bartholomeusz, Poonam Trivedi(2005) pp:50 It was the prime performing company in Marathi language until 1913. After Kirloskar's death, it presented plays of Govind Ballal Deval and Shripad Krushna Kolhatkar besides Kirloskar's Shakuntal and Saubhadra. It toured through Maharashtra, Karnataka and Maratha princely states in North India under the British Raj at that time - Indore, Baroda, Gwalior etc. The Mandali had several star singer-actors in its employ, including Bal Gandharva, Govindrao Tembe, Master Krushnarao, and Ganesh Bodas. Kirloskar Natak Mandali folded around 1935. Bal Gandharva's Gandharva Natak Mandali; Vasudeorao Dongre's Dongre Mandali; Pandoba Gurav Yavateshwarkar's Waikar Sangeet Mandali; Janubhau Nimkar and Keshavrao Bhosale's Swadesh-Hita- Chintak Mandali, which evolved into Lalit-Kaladarsha Mandali; and Master Dinanath's Balwant Natak Mandali were the other main performing companies which were formed in Maharashtra after 1913.

He was probably a son of Docibilis magnificus, who in turn was probably a son of Landolf, son of Gregory, Duke of Gaeta, and Landolf's mistress Polyssena (Pulessene).Skinner, 141. He was a brother of Duke Leo II of Gaeta. Hugh is first mentioned in 1023, when he made a donation of the castle at Suio to the Abbey of Montecassino.Skinner, 168. Hugh was ill at the time and the donation may have been an attempt to solicit divine favour.Skinner, 187. On the other hand, considering the instability in Gaeta, Hugh may have been seeking a protector in the abbot, Theobald. What is certain is that Hugh remained staunchly loyal to the ruling branch of his dynasty, the Docibilians, in Gaeta, for he dated his charter by the rule of John V of Gaeta and his regents Emilia and Leo I at a time when the other high-ranking vassals of Gaeta were moving towards independence.Skinner, 169. Hugh's loyalty may be self-serving, however: his son John, at least, had economic interests in Gaeta. Hugh maintained his position even after Pandulf IV of Capua conquered Gaeta in 1032. In 1040 he confirmed his gift of 1023 to abbot Riccherius and specifically reserving half of the castle for his son. He was succeeded by his son John, who was still in power in 1079.

It was designed by the New York City architectural firm of Frank Wills and Henry Dudley. The church was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on 24 February 1975. History St. John's parish was organized in 1834 and by 1837 the parishioners had moved into a modest brick sanctuary on the corner of Perry and Jefferson Streets. After little more than a decade, the church needed to expand after the state capital moved to Montgomery and a rise in cotton production swelled the region's population. The current building was completed in 1855, in the same city block as the old, but facing Madison Street. An interior view toward the altar in 1934. St. John's Episcopal Church was involved in several historic events around the time of the American Civil War. It hosted the Secession Convention of Southern Churches in 1861, which had helped fuel the South's secession movement. St. John's was also the church attended by the Confederate President, Jefferson Davis, when Montgomery was the capital of the Confederate States of America. The church was forced to close its doors in 1865 under Union Army orders; it would reopen for services in 1866. The old building from the 1830s was torn down in 1869 and its bricks were used to construct an addition to the main structure. The building was expanded again in 1906. The church hosted many Army recruits from the nearby \\"Camp Sheridan\\" tent city during World War I, until the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic forced the church to temporarily close its doors. Between 1898 and 1901, St. John's rector was Edgar Gardner Murphy, who played a leading role in organizing first the Alabama and then the National Child Labor Committee, which campaigned to strict limits on employment of children in factories. In 1901, he left St. John's to take over leadership of the Southern Education Board, an organization devoted to improving education‚Äîparticularly public education‚Äîin the region. In May 1925, a bronze plaque in honor of President Jefferson Davis was dedicated. John Trotwood Moore, the State Librarian and Archivist of Tennessee, known defender of the KKK, lynching, and segregation was invited to give a speech. In 2019, after further researching the political context and motivations surrounding the dedication of the plaque (and later a pew dedicated to Davis in 1931) the vestry of St. John's voted to have the plaque and pew removed from the sanctuary and moved to the parish archives.https://stjohnsmontgomery.org/the- jefferson-davis-pew-and- plaque/https://www.episcopalnewsservice.org/2019/02/08/alabama-church-removes- pew-plaque-dedicated-to-confederate-president-jefferson-davis/ The church was renovated in the 1950s and again in 2006.

He composed music for the drama Manapman in 1910, and also for the first Marathi talkie Ayodhyecha Raja (1932). He also acted in both these productions. He was a personal friend of Late Yuvaraja of Mysore, HH Sri. Kanteerva Narasimha Raja Wadiyar. Prof. Tembe was part of a large entourage of Yuvaraja during his trip to Europe in 1939. The Troupe performed before the Pope and at other places during this trip. As World war broke out, they stayed at London for a long time and ultimately returned in Jan 1940 but Yuvaraja died soon at his Palace Anchorage (next to Hotel Taj) in March 1940 and Prof. Tembe lost his patron. He was part-owner of Gandharva Natak Mandali when it was formed in 1913. Two years later, he started his own company named Shivraj Natak Mandali. He wrote dramas and also the padas (songs) in them.

The original building was registered as a National Landmark and is an official register of Historic Places in 2005. Since 1947, the 1940s era Electro Freeze machines have produced the frozen custard daily. Custard is different from ice cream because it contains eggs, and sells only three flavors, Vanilla, Chocolate, and Strawberry. When Carl retired he passed it to his brothers, Paul Sponseller and Herbert Sponseller. When they in turn retired it was passed to Ramona Sponseller (Settle), Daniel Sponseller, and Cristina Sponseller (McCann); keeping it in the family. The stand has what can only be called a devoted following, to the point that the line of customers often stretches around the building, even in bad weather.

It is situated on the north side of Mynydd Llangatwg in Llangattock community, about south-west of Crickhowell. The reserve covers and has a varied geology with Old Red Sandstone below the cliffs and Millstone Grit above them. The range of habitats is equally wide with woodland and scrub in the lower parts and moorland higher up. There are numerous caves and disused quarries along the escarpment. The limestone cliffs are home to many scarce plants including maiden pink (Dianthus deltoides), hutchinsia (Hornungia petraea) and the most southerly British population of alpine enchanter's nightshade (Circaea alpina). Five species of whitebeam occur including the narrow-leaved whitebeam (Sorbus leptophylla) and lesser whitebeam (Sorbus minima) which are endemic to Wales. About 50 species of bird breed on the reserve including ring ouzel and raven on the cliffs and redstart, wood warbler and pied flycatcher in the woods.

The outer, display side had two small pierced bumps through which a cord was strung for hanging it. The inner side contained a cavity that was filled with chalk made from powdered seashells.

The institute also created the Special Program of Assisted Reproduction (SPAR), a program that assists serodiscordant couples successfully achieve pregnancy.HIV Sperm Washing Bedford Research Foundation - Overview Dr. Ann Kiessling, the founder of Bedford Stem Cell Research Foundation, is the Laboratory Director.Bedford Research Foundation Logo Background Bedford Research Foundation was founded to satisfy the need for a research and development clinical laboratory that could facilitate technology transfer from basic science discoveries to clinical test applications. BRF was founded and incorporated in 1996 by Dr. Ann Kiessling and through the efforts of men and women whose lives were altered by blood products tainted with the AIDS virus (Human Immunodeficiency Virus, HIV) and Hepatitis C virus. Faced with unprecedented disease obstacles, the men and women insisted that biomedical technology be developed to fight their infections, and allow them to conceive children of their own. Research to ensure the safety of conception by assisted reproductive technologies in general was not funded by the National Institutes of Health because of the U.S. Congress decisions in 1996 and 1998 that research on fertilized human eggs \\"...is meritorious and should be done for society..., but will not be funded by taxpayer dollars.\\" The Foundation conducts research within its own laboratories (Stem Cell, Prostate, Infectious disease) as well as in collaboration with other laboratories and raises money to award research grants to qualified investigators seeking to improve the safety and success of assisted reproduction to mothers and babies. Much of the research supported by the Foundation cannot be funded by federal grants-in-aid because of the U.S. moratorium on funding research on human eggs activated either artificially or by sperm. For this reason, the men and women themselves raised the money to fund the Special Program of Assisted Reproduction (SPAR). Within two years, technology was developed to protect against virus transmission at conception. As a result, Baby Ryan was born in 1999 to a healthy Mom and a Dad with hemophilia who was infected with Hepatitis C and HIV by tainted blood factors. In conjunction with stem cell research, Foundation scientists also apply patented processes to help diagnose male reproductive tract disorders. Research done at the Foundation has led to the development of additional tests that may provide valuable information about overall men's health. A current focus is detection of bacteria in semen by molecular biology methods instead of standard laboratory culture. Studies to date reveal that semen contains bacteria not previously identified. Such studies hold the promise of developing new tests for the health of semen producing organs such as the prostate, which is a site of significant disease in men, including infection (prostatitis) and cancer. SARS2 (Coronavirus) Testing On April 10, 2020 it was reported that Bedford Research Foundation had expanded its operations to include SARS2 testing, making it one of 66 sites in the United States with a Food and Drug Administration- approved test for COVID-19.

Richard Gilsdorf (24 January 1930 ‚Äì 4 May 2005) was a Catholic priest who played a role in doctrinal battles that followed the Second Vatican Council. He opposed renowned Scripture scholar Raymond E. Brown and wrote a number of articles for conservative Catholic publications on the issues of the day. Early in his priesthood, many considered him a progressive, especially because of his excitement over the work of Vatican II and its efforts to further Christian unity. As time progressed, however, his perspective changed as a result of what he saw as misuse and distortions of conciliar teachings and as he became disenchanted with leading Catholic theologians and academics such as Brown, Oscar Cullmann, and Karl Rahner. Biography =Early life and education= Gilsdorf was born in Green Bay, Wisconsin to Wilbert and Gladys Gilsdorf. He attended that city‚Äôs Central Catholic High School and then the St. Lawrence Minor Seminary in Mount Calvary, Wisconsin. He received his BA at St. Norbert College in De Pere, Wisconsin, in 1952, and then studied Theology at St. Meinrad Seminary in St. Meinrad, Indiana, after which he received Holy Orders to the priesthood at the hands of Bishop Stanislaus Vincent Bona at Cathedral of Saint Francis Xavier in Green Bay, Wisconsin on May 26, 1956. =Ordination and ministry= He served his first appointment at St. John Church in Little Chute, Wisconsin, for two years, and then received assignment to the faculty of Sacred Heart Minor Seminary near Green Bay. In September 1959, Gilsdorf presented a statement on behalf the Roman Catholic bishops of Wisconsin before the US Congressional Sub-committee on Migratory Labor regarding proposed legislation, and advocated for improved conditions for workers.\\"Statement of Rev.

He then attended the Sorbonne in Paris where he earned his Certificat du Cours Sup√©rieur in 1963. In 1970 he received a second master's degree in Scripture from St. Louis University, and he completed his doctoral studies in Scripture in 1973.Olson, Carl E., \\"Go to Joseph\\", Ignatius Insight:Scoop, November 04, 2009 He served at a number of parishes in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Green Bay, was active in the diocese working with migrant workers, and taught summer courses in Scripture at the Pontifical Catechetical Institute in Beaverton, Oregon, for four straight years. During then-Bishop Adam Maida‚Äôs tenure as ordinary for the Green Bay diocese, Gilsdorf served as a member of the Presbyteral Council and the College of Consultors. With Fr. Robert Levis of Erie, Pennsylvania, and Fr. Dudley Day, OSA, of Chicago, he founded and, from 1994‚Äì99, served as president of the Confraternity of Catholic Clergy, an organization of priests, deacons, and seminarians. According to Homiletic & Pastoral Review editor Kenneth Baker, the impact of one article he wrote, 'The Plight of the Papist Priest', ‚Äúwas so great that it was translated into five languages, and people requested it for over 20 years. In it,‚Äù wrote Baker, ‚Äúhe pinpointed the problem of priests trying to be faithful to the Pope and the Magisterium who are ordered by their bishop to do something less. Proof that he was on target is this: Priests from three different parts of the country told me they were sure the anonymous author was in their diocese.‚Äù In his articles, Gilsdorf argued that the Catholic Church in America was \\"losing its moorings\\" and that many of the faithful had drifted into what he believed was \\"Modernist heresy,\\" a phrase harkening back to debates from the early twentieth century. For the final 23 years of his life he served as pastor of Holy Trinity Church in Casco, Wisconsin. After several years of serious illness, Gilsdorf died on May 4, 2005, and was buried at St. John the Baptist Cemetery in Howard, Wisconsin, near his father‚Äôs and mother‚Äôs tombs. Works * The Lamb that is Slain, (1986) During his priestly career, he wrote prolifically in publications such as Homiletic and Pastoral Review, The Wanderer, and Lay Witness.

Lying within the Tulum Valley (:es:Valle del Tul√∫m) agricultural oasis, almost 80% of the department's area is cultivated; it is known in particular for its production of wine and its fruit and vegetable crops.  Toponymy  National Route 20 Entrance to the \\"Taranto\\" vehicle parts factory, the Department's largest industrial plant. The department is named for its chief town, Nueve de Julio, which itself was named for the date of Argentina's declaration of independence on July 9, 1816.  History  The earliest inhabitants of the area were the Huarpes, who lived by agriculture, hunting, and fishing in the San Juan River. The Spanish arrived in the area in 1562. The sparsely populated territory became part of the Santa Luc√≠a Department in 1869. As part of a reorganisation within the province in 1913, a municipality of Nueve de Julio was created, which took in the localities of Las Chacritas and Rinc√≥n Cercado. Then in 1928 some of the municipalities were abolished, including Nueve de Julio, which was incorporated in Pocito Department. This step was reversed in 1942, when Nueve de Julio became one of the 19 departments of the province, within its present boundaries. Villa Nueve de Julio, Tierra Adentro, Las Majaditas and Las Chacritas are among the districts included within the department. For religious purposes the department fell within the Santa Luc√≠a parish until 1992, when Nuestra Se√±ora del Rosario was chosen as the department's own patron saint.  Geography  The Nueve de Julio Department is located in south central San Juan Province, about east of the city of San Juan. It has an area of . Adjacent departments are: * To the north: Santa Luc√≠a and San Mart√≠n * To the south: 25 de Mayo and Rawson * To the east: Caucete and 25 de Mayo * To the west: Rawson Nueve de Julio is one of the departments comprising the Tulum Valley, a space enclosed to the east by the San Juan River and to the west by the Agua Negra creek. This valley forms a plain sloping gradually down to the east, comprising oasis areas watered by rivers as well as desert areas which are more predominant in the south of the department. The climate is continental, bringing very hot summers with temperatures up to 40 ¬∞C, and cold to moderate winters with sub- zero temperatures. Rainfall is scarce, and summer hailstorms have an adverse effect on agriculture. Notable winds are the zondaa hot and dry wind from the westand a cold and damp south wind. The flora is characterized by xerophytic vegetation, such as the jarilla bush and the retamos, although the totora and other types of reed are also found. Bird life includes herons, gallaretas and moorhens. The coypu, an aquatic mammal, is found near the San Juan River. There are also many insects.  Economy  The main economic activity of this department is agricultural, with a cultivated area of 4,343 hectares, devoted mainly to grapevines, olive trees, vegetables such as tomatoes and onions, fruit (melon, plum, quince), forestry, grains and forage crops. Winemaking is a leading industry, and one large factory produces vehicle parts and polyethylene.  Population  The municipal offices in the town of 9 de Julio. Dwellings on Ruta Provincial 155 (Calle Zapata) near Las Chacritas. Nueve de Julio is among the least populous of the departments in San Juan province, with only 9,307 inhabitants (2010 Census of Argentina). The majority are rural dwellers, and the urban minority are concentrated in the main town, also called Nueve de Julio; here many new dwellings have been built, some for use as holiday homes, but the town retains a rural atmosphere due to the various agricultural activities that are carried on. Las Chacritas, the second most populated locality, attracts residents by its proximity to a main route between San Juan city and Buenos Aires. The main localities are provided with electricity and drinking water. However, there has been only limited development of business premises. All levels of education, except for university, are available in Nueve de Julio.  Seismic activity  Earthquakes have occurred in areas adjacent to Nueve de Julio department, notably the 1944 and 1977 San Juan earthquakes.

Biography Butler being carried away after pulling a tendon at the 1920 Olympics Sol Butler injury: 1920 Olympics Butler was born in Kingfisher, Oklahoma, the youngest child of Ben and Mary Butler. His father was from Morgan County, Alabama, and born a slave in 1842; his mother was born in Georgia in 1867. His father fought in the Civil War and took the last name of Butler from General Butler whom he admired. The Butler family escaped slavery and settled in Wichita, Kansas, before moving to Hutchinson, Kansas, in 1909. \\"Sol\\", as he was known, made the varsity football team as a starting halfback during his freshman year. He led the school in football and in track and field. His sophomore year, he helped Hutchinson to a runner-up finish at the state meet after setting state records in the 100-yard dash. In 1913, as a junior in Hutchinson High School (Kansas) at a district meet he won six firsts, broke five meet records and unofficially broke a world record in the 50-yard dash. He along with his older brother Benjamin followed his high school coach to Rock Island High School in Rock Island, Illinois, for his senior season in 1914. Facing 300 of the best track stars of the Midwest in Chicago, he competed in the regional interscholastic meet held at Northwestern University. He placed in the 60-yard dash and hurdles, the 440 yard dash, and also in the broad jump. He broke one meet record, tied a world record, and won fourth place overall, competing against entire track teams. Butler earned 12 varsity letters competing in football, basketball, baseball and track and field at the University of Dubuque from 1915 to 1919. According to Arthur Ashe Jr.'s book Hard Road to Glory, A History of the African- American Athlete, Butler was the first African American to quarterback a team for all four years of college. In Butler's day, the track and field of activity was restricted. There was no national collegiate meet and very little indoor competition. Even the Drake Relays, then in their formative years, provided no such event as the broad jump. Butler went to the Penn Relays for that competition and twice won the championship. In 1919, to illustrate, Butler won both the 100-yard dash and broad jump at the Penn Relays. Entering military service as a soldier in World War I as he represented the U.S. Army in the Inter-Allied Games in Paris, where he won the long jump. He was knighted by the King of Montenegro, who made Butler a Knight of the Third Order of Danilo. With the Olympic Games scheduled for renewal in 1920 after the wartime interruption in 1916, Butler was rated as a heavy favorite for the championship. His winning jump at Paris, ,Inter-Allied Games. gbrathletics.com was two inches from the Olympic record and was considered a strong possibility for a new Olympic record. Butler went to Antwerp for the 1920 Olympics, but misfortune nailed him quickly. On his very first jump in the Olympic preliminaries he pulled a tendon and was forced to withdraw. The injury- hampered effort was a shade under 21-8. He won the U.S. National Amateur Athletic Union championship that same year by jumping .James Odenkirk. An Unheralded World Class Athlete.

In 1925, Butler played for the Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro Leagues briefly, going 0-3.Sol Butler NLB Statistics & History. Baseball-Reference.com. Retrieved on September 9, 2015. Later, returning to football, Butler played alongside Jim Thorpe of the Canton Bulldogs where he was named starting quarterback in 1926. In 1926, the New York Giants refused to let its all-white team on the field in front of the largest crowd ever (40,000) to watch an NFL game until Canton withdraw Butler as starting quarterback. In 1927, Butler returned to Chicago and married (Berenice-a native Kansan). Butler moved back to the Midwest and went on to work with the youth in the Negro districts as recreation director of Chicago's Washington Park. He worked part-time as a probationary officer, and became sports editor for the Chicago Bee and The Defender newspapers in Chicago. He was active in the Chicago Blackhawk alternative professional football team and began becoming a well known personality after appearing in movies and press regularly. He wife died before Solomon and Berenice would have any children. He would spend his time promoting and coaching youth in city parks activities within the Chicago area. While in California playing for the Chicago All-Stars basketball team which he founded, he would stay in the state. Butler used his earnings to re-open Jack's Caf√©, previously owned by Jack Johnson, former heavyweight boxing champion in 1932. He was named to a key role in a film by Russ Sanders in 1935 being filmed in Hollywood, Calif. after playing minor parts in a few films prior.

Background Ariel 5 was the fifth and penultimate satellite of the joint British and American Ariel programme. It was the third satellite in the series built entirely in the UK. It was named UK 5 before launch and renamed to Ariel 5 after the successful launch. Plans for Ariel 5 were first discussed between the UK and US in May 1967 at the Ariel 3 launch. The Science Research Council (SRC) advertised a request for proposal for experiments in June. Experiments were formally proposed to NASA in July 1968. Satellite design =Development= Marconi Space and Defence Systems (MSDS) in Portsmouth was selected as the prime contractor in 1969. SRC had them select MSDS Frimley for the attitude control system (ACS) and MSDS Stanmore for the core stores. A study was performed to see if the Scout rocket's heat shield could be enlarged to accommodate larger experiments for this mission. A larger heat shield was designed which allowed for a US experiment and five British experiments. =Operation= Ariel 5 was spin-stabilized. The satellite improved on the attitude control of Ariel 4. It used liquid propane that was expanded through a reducing valve and heated with the bulk tank temperature. Power was derived from solar cells that were mounted to 7/8's of the circumference of the spacecraft. It was stored in a 3.0 Ah Ni-Cd battery. =Sensors= The all-sky monitor (ASM) was two one-dimensional pinhole cameras scanned most of the sky every spacecraft revolution. The angular resolution was 10 √ó 10¬∞, with an effective area of , and a bandpass of 3‚Äì6 keV. The ASM was designed to fit a resource budget of , 1 bit per second (bps), and 1 W. The sky survey instrument (SSI) had an angular resolution of 0.75 √ó 10.6¬∞, with an effective area of , and a bandpass of 2‚Äì20 keV.

She is propelled by a diesel-electric power plant consisting of diesel generators powering electric motors coupled to the propeller shafts. Consequently, she may use the ship prefix \\"de\\" and be referred to as de Wyuna. Her role as a pilot cutter was to sail with pilots on board to meet ships entering Port Phillip Bay. Pilots would be transferred by the Wyuna's workboat to the vessel requiring pilotage while it was stopped dead in the water, with shelter provided by the vessel itself. In the early 1970s the pilot service started using fast launches to allow pilots to board while ships were still underway, and in 1979 the Wyuna was sold to the Australian Maritime College in Launceston, Tasmania as a training vessel.

Habitat and biology Kuhlia xenura is frequently observed in schools and can be found in fresh water, brackish habitats, and shallow water along the seashore. While in fresh water they feed mainly on algae, insects, planktonic crustaceans, and foraminiferans, while fish in brackish or salt water eat copepods, amphipods, insects, mollusc larvae, algae, spiders, and annelids. Medium sized fish, with a total length of , occur in deeper water at the foot of exposed cliffs, in larger tidal pools, or in rivers or ponds. These fish have a diet dominated by crustacean larvae, especially the later stages of crabs and stomatopods. They also eat small amounts of insects and algae. Fish larger than a total length of are found in surf exposed cliffs, in caves in outer reefs, and other exposed localities, where they feed largely on crustaceans and polychaete worms. This species is mainly nocturnal. Spawning occurs all year, but peaks between December and June and it appears to occur at sea. Taxonomy The strange- tailed flagtail was previously confused with the Hawaiian flagtail until 2001. It was first described as Xenichthys xenurus on the basis of a specimen mistakenly thought to have come from San Salvador, El Salvador.Jordan, D. S. and C. H. Gilbert 1882.

He was elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1930 election as a Member of the Liberal Party to represent the riding of Wellington North. He was re-elected in 1935 and 1940. Early Life and Career Blair was born in Caledon, Ontario, Canada. After graduating from high school Dr. Blair attended teacher's college. He taught school for four years before entering the University of Toronto where he graduated in medicine in 1906. He spent the following year as an intern, first at the Royal Alexandra Hospital (Groves Memorial) in Fergus, Ontario with the noted surgeon Dr. Abraham Groves, and then at the Burnside Maternity Hospital in Toronto where he gained experience in obstetrics. In 1907 he moved to Cutler in Northern Ontario under contract to the lumbering companies in that area. During the next few years he practiced in Ethel and then Rosemont, finally settling in Arthur, Ontario in 1918. He was a family doctor who gained a reputation as an exceptional obstetrician and as a keen diagnostician in the days before diagnostic tools such as X-rays were available. Political career In 1930 the Liberal Association of North Wellington offered him the nomination for the upcoming federal election. North Wellington was a largely rural riding and had sent a Conservative member to Ottawa for many years. A Conservative majority government was elected that year under R. B. Bennett, however Dr. Blair won this seat for the Liberals and held it for the next 15 years until he retired in 1945. He was on a number of Parliamentary Committees including the Special Committee on the Criminal Code, the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Colonization, and the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce. Reminiscing about Dr. Blair‚Äôs life as a Member of Parliament the Guelph Mercury summarized his career in an article published on May 20, 1950. \\"In his parliamentary career, he was a constant advocate of such things as pensions for the aged and the principle of family allowances.he stood, too, for the elimination of capital punishment by hanging and was a consistent advocate of reciprocity and greater trade with the United States.\\" On many of these issues Dr. Blair was well in advance of his times. The Old Age Pension was introduced in 1927 but it was not until 1951 that it became universal and without restrictions. The Family Allowance Act was passed in 1944 by a unanimous vote while Dr. Blair was still a sitting Member of Parliament. The death penalty was not eliminated until 1976, and the Free Trade Agreement was not enacted until 1987. Personal life In 1908 he married Bertha Susan McDowell, a nurse from Fergus. Dr. and Mrs Blair had three sons, Angus, Kenneth and Norman and eight grandchildren.

Symptoms include pain, loss of motor control, and sensory deficits. Types There are two main types of plexopathy: brachial plexopathy and lumbosacral plexopathy. Cause They are usually caused from some sort of localized trauma such as a dislocated shoulder. The disorder can also be caused secondary to a compression, co-morbid vascular disease, infection, or may be idiopathic with an unknown cause. Both plexopathies can also occur as a consequence of radiation therapy, sometimes after 30 or more years have passed, in conditions known as Radiation-induced Brachial Plexopathy (RIBP) and Radiation-induced Lumbosacral Plexopathy (RILP). Diagnosis The first steps in the evaluation and later management of plexopathy would consist of gathering a medical history and conducting a physical examination by a healthcare clinician. Motor function defect patterns detected within either the upper or lower extremities help with diagnosis of the disorder. X-rays of the cervical spine, chest, and shoulder are usually ordered if symptoms point to acute Brachial plexopathy. If the physical history reveals a history of diabetes, collagen vascular disease, or symptoms of infection, the physician may order a series of blood tests including a complete blood count (CBC) and a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP). Plexopathy symptoms often resemble spinal cord disorders. A neurosurgical consultation is usually undertaken to ensure proper diagnosis, management, and treatment. Patients with chronic symptoms will likely be advised to follow up with outpatient care from either their health care provider or specialist. Treatment Mild cases are usually treated by the administration of analgesia and muscle relaxers. Reduced and limited physical activity with repeated follow-ups with the health care provider are required for one diagnosed with plexopathy. Individuals with prolonged, chronic symptoms will require additional testing and treatment. With brachial plexopathy, surgical decompression may be warranted if the pathophysiology of the disease is causing pressure on the affected nerves. In some cases of brachial plexopathy, no treatment is required and recovery happens on its own. Treatment for lumbosacral plexopathy that is not caused by trauma, but instead from diabetic plexopathy, is directed at controlling the person's blood sugar level. By preventing the deterioration of the nerve fibers from hyperglycemia, patients may recover significant muscle strength. For radiation-induced plexopathies, treatment options are limited to pain/symptom management and provision of assistive devices.

In the 1950s and 1960s she went into semi-retirement to raise her family. From 1969 to 1977 she played with Humphrey Lyttelton. Following this she led her own groups, with Harry Beckett, John Burch, and vibes player Lennie Best, among others. Aside from this she played with Johnny Griffin, Al Haig, Earl Hines, Buddy Tate, Zoot Sims, Marian McPartland, and Dick Hyman. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s she taught adult music classes along with the pianist-trombonist Eddie Harvey at the City Literary Institute in Holborn, London. During the period 1978-1992 she formed the Kathy Stobart Quintet originally featuring Harry Beckett (trumpet); Fiachra Trench (keyboards); Dave Olney (bass); Tony Mann (drums), later on including Lennie Best (vibraphone); Johnny Burch (piano); and Harvey Weston (bass). Guest vocalists included Elizabeth Welch and Marian Williams. It was during this period that she appeared at the Nice Jazz Festival for the first time. Stobart was also a regular guest musician on the BBC Radio 1 programme Sounds of Jazz recorded at the Maida Vale Studios midweek in London in the 1970s and introduced by Peter Clayton on Sunday evenings.Theme from Sounds of Jazz Peter Clayton radiorewind.co.uk Retrieved 27 May 2020.

A major support towards empowering female musicians and in 1986 she was a guest with Gail Thompson's Gail Force as well as leading a group with saxophonist Joan Cunningham in the late 1980s. Meanwhile she made guest appearances returning to play in New York with saxophonist Zoot Sims and the expatriate English pianist Marian McPartland. In 1985 she moved to Axmouth, east Devon, and set up a student band in Exeter.Kathy Stobart Obituary www.independent.co.uk Retrieved 27 May 2020. From 1992-2004 she rejoined Humphrey Lyttelton Band for the third time and made occasional guest appearances with others. Lyttelton once referred to her \\"huge, booming sound, imbued with total originality and commanding presence\\". In 2001 Stobart appeared on stage with Radiohead, along with the Humphrey Lyttleton band, in front of 42,000 fans at the South Park concert in Oxford. During this period she also continued her ongoing teaching including running her own jazz courses. In the same year, Stobart tutored saxophone to the actress Dame Judi Dench for her role in the Alan Platter TV play, \\"The Last of the Blonde Bombshells\\". She continued to play professionally until the age of 82 in 2007.Kathy Stobart Biography www.britannica.com Retrieved 27 May 2020.Kathy Stobart Website www.kathystobart.co.uk Retrieved 27 May 2020. Personal Life Stobart was married twice. First to Canadian pianist Art Thompson from 1943 to 1951. She and Thompson were married towards the end of the war and worked together, also visiting the US on holiday, where Stobart sat in at Eddie Condon's club in New York. The marriage ended in divorce when Thompson elected to stay on in north America. She then went on to marry trumpeter Bert Courtley from 1951 until his death caused by the effects of alcohol and the 'apparent stress caused' working with the Ted Heath Band, aged 40. He died in Croydon, Surrey on 13 September 1969. Stobart suffered from a stroke in 2011 and died three years later in the early hours of Sunday 6th July, 2014 aged 89. Her death came as a shock to many jazz fans.

Peritoneal fluid analysis The serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) is the most useful index for evaluating peritoneal fluid and can help distinguish ascites caused by portal hypertension (cirrhosis, portal vein thrombosis, Budd-Chiari syndrome, etc.) from other causes of ascites. SAAG is calculated by subtracting the albumin measure of ascitic fluid from the serum value. In portal hypertension, the SAAG is >1.1 g/dL while ascites from other causes shows a SAAG of less than 1.1 g/dL. Peritoneal fluid microscopy is a useful test in evaluating the cause of ascites.

While in Ohio Valley Wrestling, he was one half of High Dosage with \\"Silverback\\" Ryan Reeves. Early life Born in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, Bolen became involved in weightlifting and football as a teenager. Attending California University of Pennsylvania, Bolen played football as a two-time All-Conference and All- American nose guard and two-time defensive captain. Although tearing three ligaments in his knee breaking his tibula and fibula, he spent only a year in rehab and continued playing during his senior year completing the season without missing a single game. Bodybuilding After graduation, he continued bodybuilding and eventually set a state bench record in the . weight class at . At a state power lifting meet, he attempted to qualify for the Arnold Classic by benching . Although coming two inches of locking out the qualifying limit, he did manage to break his own record at . During the meet, he met former Gold's Gym Venice owner Ed Conners who had happened to be in town that evening to attend a bodybuilding show. During this meeting, Conners encouraged Bolen to participate in the \\"Gut Check Challenge\\", a talent recruitment event organized by Total Nonstop Action Wrestling in conjunction with TrimSpa as part of the Show of Strength Pro Championship weekend. Professional wrestling career =Total Nonstop Action Wrestling= Bolen accepted Conners' offer to fly him to Atlanta, Georgia and eventually won the \\"Gut Check Challenge\\" on October 16, 2004. The event saw entrants rated on the basis of their performance in five categories: \\"back bump\\", \\"mat techniques\\", \\"ring interviews\\", \\"running the ropes\\" and \\"squat challenge\\". The male and female events were won by Bolen and Jaime Dauncey respectively, with Bolen and Dauncey rewarded with a $4,000 USD cash prize and a subsequent appearance on TNA programming. During the next two months, he trained under Scott D'Amore for three hours a day and five days a week and began appearing at house shows after an 8-week period. Bolen appeared several times in TNA during 2005, including an appearance at Turning Point on December 11, where he teamed with Buck Quartermain and Joe Doering in losing effort to Lance Hoyt and The Naturals (Andy Douglas and Chase Stevens) in a six-man tag team match. In later appearances, he was utilized as a preliminary wrestler during his later appearances with the promotion. =World Wrestling Entertainment= Ohio Valley Wrestling Appearing on the undercard of the final episode of WWE Velocity, he and Sterling James Keenan had a WWE tryout match losing to Kid Kash and Jamie Noble. Bolen eventually signed a developmental contract with World Wrestling Entertainment in July 2006 and assigned to Ohio Valley Wrestling, a WWE developmental territory based in Louisville, Kentucky. On July 27, Bolen made his OVW debut losing to Elijah Burke at a house show. Two days later at an event at Six Flags Kentucky Kingdom, he teamed with Aaron Stevens, Rod Steel and Eddie Craven in an 8-man tag team match losing to Chet the Jet, Brent Albright, Cody Runnels and Shawn Osborne. On August 11, he participated in a 15-man battle royal which included Shawn Osborne, Elijah Burke, Eddie Craven III, Pat Buck, Mike Kruel, Shad Gaspard, Lennox Lightfoot, Ranger Milton, Neighborhoodie, Johnny Punch, Seth Skyfire, Rod Steele, Jack Bull, Los Locos (Ram√≥n and Ra√∫l) and The Untouchables (Deuce Shade and Dice Domino). In September, Bolen formed a tag team with Ryan Reeves called High Dosage. On January 10, 2007, High Dosage received their first and only opportunity at Southern Tag Team Championship, which they lost to defending champions Cody Runnels and Shawn Spears. The team ended soon afterwards when Reeves was released from his WWE developmental contract on January 19, 2007. On January 20, Bolen teamed up with Katie Lea to defeat Domino and Cherry in a mixed tag team match in Hillview, Kentucky. He would again team with Katie Lea in a handicap mixed tag team match against Cherry and Deuce 'n Domino on January 24. The following night, he and Ariel defeated Idol Stevens and Beth Phoenix. Bolen would remain in OVW only a brief time before his final television appearance in the promotion teaming with T.J. Dalton against Charles \\"The Hammer\\" Evans and Justin \\"The Ox\\" LaRoche on January 31. Deep South Wrestling and departure By mid-February, Bolen appeared in Deep South Wrestling, teaming with Shawn Osborne in a losing effort against Freakin' Deacon and G-Rilla on February 15. Defeating Heath Miller in a dark match several days later, Bolen continued to team with Osborne, although the two were less than successful. On March 16, he also lost to Kofi Kingston at a DSW event in Atlanta, Georgia. In his final appearance, he and Osborne defeated Robert Anthony and Johnny Curtis at the DSW Arena in McDonough, Georgia on April 5. Bolen was then released the following day. =Return to the independent circuit= On June 9, 2007, Bolen won the NWA Upstate Kayfabe Dojo Championship after defeating Colin Olsen, Cloudy and then-champion JP Black. Beginning in 2008, the Kayfabe Dojo Title was retired without Bolen ever having lost it. During the summer, he made his return to the International Wrestling Cartel, making a surprise appearance at the supercard Super Indy VI interfering on behalf of former Heavyweight Champion Ricky Reyes, who was being attacked by Dennis Gregory and Brent Albright. Although scheduled to face Albright the following month at Summer Sizzler 4: Checkmate, Albright was unable to make the event due to \\"travel issues\\" and Bolen instead faced Chris Hero, who he defeated. At the 2007 Ellsworth Basebrawl, Bolen was to team with former tag team partner Sterling James Keenan against War Machine (Brent Albright and Sebastian Dark). However, Keenan ended up defeating Albright in an Ellsworth Street Fight after Bolen pulled out of the match. After being seen at many IWC events in the past several months, Bolen made his official return at the Promotional Consideration Paid for by the Following championship tournament as a color commentator.

This process is most commonly due to osteoporosis, but may also be due to other pathologies such as: cancer, infection (such as osteomyelitis), inherited bone disorders, or a bone cyst. Only a small number of conditions are commonly responsible for pathological fractures, including osteoporosis, osteomalacia, Paget's disease, osteitis, osteogenesis imperfecta, benign bone tumours and cysts, secondary malignant bone tumours and primary malignant bone tumours. Fragility fracture is a type of pathologic fracture that occurs as result of an injury that would be insufficient to cause fracture in a normal bone. There are three fracture sites said to be typical of fragility fractures: vertebral fractures, fractures of the neck of the femur, and Colles fracture of the wrist. This definition arises because a normal human being ought to be able to fall from standing height without breaking any bones, and a fracture, therefore, suggests weakness of the skeleton. Pathological fractures present as a chalkstick fracture in long bones, and appear as a transverse fractures nearly 90 degrees to the long axis of the bone. In a pathological compression fracture of a spinal vertebra fractures will commonly appear to collapse the entire body of vertebra. Cause Pathologic fractures in children and adolescents can result from a diverse array of disorders namely; metabolic, endocrine, neoplastic, infectious, immunologic, and genetic skeletal dysplasias.

Given a graph G, G is a string graph if and only if there exists a set of curves, or strings, drawn in the plane such that no three strings intersect at a single point and such that the graph having a vertex for each curve and an edge for each intersecting pair of curves is isomorphic to G.  Background  described a concept similar to string graphs as they applied to genetic structures. In that context, he also posed the specific case of intersecting intervals on a line, namely the now classical family of interval graphs. Later, specified the same idea to electrical networks and printed circuits. The mathematical study of string graphs began with the paper and through a collaboration between Sinden and Ronald Graham, where the characterization of string graphs eventually came to be posed as an open question at the 5th Hungarian Colloquium on Combinatorics in 1976.. However, the recognition of string graphs was eventually proven to be NP-complete, implying that no simple characterization is likely to exist. showed string graph recognition to be NP-hard, but was not able to show that it could be solved in NP. After intermediate results by and , completed the proof that the problem is NP-complete. Related graph classes Representation of a planar graph as a string graph. Every planar graph is a string graph: credit this observation to . one may form a string graph representation of an arbitrary plane-embedded graph by drawing a string for each vertex that loops around the vertex and around the midpoint of each adjacent edge, as shown in the figure. For any edge uv of the graph, the strings for u and v cross each other twice near the midpoint of uv, and there are no other crossings, so the pairs of strings that cross represent exactly the adjacent pairs of vertices of the original planar graph. Alternatively, by the circle packing theorem, any planar graph may be represented as a collection of circles, any two of which cross if and only if the corresponding vertices are adjacent; these circles (with a starting and ending point chosen to turn them into open curves) provide a string graph representation of the given planar graph. proved that every planar graph has a string representation in which each pair of strings has at most one crossing point, unlike the representations described above. Scheinerman's conjecture, now proven, is the even stronger statement that every planar graph may be represented by the intersection graph of straight line segments, a very special case of strings. A subdivision of K5 that is not a string graph. If every edge of a given graph G is subdivided, the resulting graph is a string graph if and only if G is planar. In particular, the subdivision of the complete graph K5 shown in the illustration is not a string graph, because K5 is not planar. Every circle graph, as an intersection graph of line segments (the chords of a circle), is also a string graph. Every chordal graph may be represented as a string graph: chordal graphs are intersection graphs of subtrees of trees, and one may form a string representation of a chordal graph by forming a planar embedding of the corresponding tree and replacing each subtree by a string that traces around the subtree's edges. The complement graph of every comparability graph is also a string graph. and . See also . Other results showed computing the chromatic number of string graphs to be NP-hard. found that string graphs form an induced minor closed class, but not a minor closed class of graphs. Every m-edge string graph can be partitioned into two subsets, each a constant fraction the size of the whole graph, by the removal of O(m3/4log1/2m) vertices. It follows that the biclique-free string graphs, string graphs containing no Kt,t subgraph for some constant t, have O(n) edges and more strongly have polynomial expansion.; .

Victor Lewis (29 July 1919 - 9 February 2009) was a British jazz guitarist and bandleader. He also enjoyed success as an artists' agent and manager. Biography He was born in London, England. Lewis began playing the guitar at the age of three, and dabbled with cornet and trombone. One of his early bands included George Shearing, then a teenager, among its members. Lewis first toured the United States in 1938, where he did recording sessions with a band that had Bobby Hackett, Eddie Condon, and Pee Wee Russell among its members. He served in the Royal Air Force from 1941‚Äì44; during this time he recorded with Buddy Featherstonhaugh. He worked with Stephane Grappelli during 1944-45 and with Ted Heath soon after. While he was in the RAF, he met Jack Parnell and together they formed the \\"Vic Lewis/Jack Parnell Jazzmen\\". Lewis put together his first big band in 1946 to play swing jazz, but soon after its formation Lewis began to direct the ensemble toward the sound of Stan Kenton. Kenton provided Lewis with some of his arrangements by Pete Rugolo, Gerry Mulligan, and Bill Holman. Lewis's pianist, Ken Thorne, also made arranging contributions. Lewis toured the US with the band at various intervals between 1956 and 1959, and recorded extensively for Parlophone, Esquire, Decca, and Philips. After 1959, Lewis semi-retired as a performer, he only occasionally recorded, but he continued to write about jazz and champion its value. He went into artist management, and oversaw the careers of photographer Robert Whitaker and the singer Cilla Black among many others. In 1964, Lewis sold his management agency to Brian Epstein's company NEMS, and thereafter worked with Epstein on arranging the Beatles' international tours. Following Epstein's death in 1967, Lewis served as managing director of NEMS. As a keen cricketer and administrator, he founded his own cricket club and represented the United States at the International Cricket Council. He served as a General Committee Member of Middlesex County Cricket Club between 1976 and 2001. Lewis also managed Robin Gibb of the Bee Gees, and Lewis produced Gibb's debut album Robin's Reign released in 1970. Lewis also had a foot in the door of more serious music and conducted recordings of his own and others with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra on Vocalion, which included excerpts from his Russian Suite, a Romance for Violin, and two movements (Red and Jade) from a multi-composer suite called Colours. He was awarded the MBE in 2007. Personal life and death Lewis married Jill Anstey (deceased) in 1950.

Non-specific immune cells function in the first line of defense against infection or injury. The innate immune system is always present at the site of infection and ready to fight the bacteria; it can also be referred to as the \\"natural\\" immune system. The cells of the innate immune system do not have specific responses and respond to each foreign invader using the same mechanism.Alberts B, 69 the rapper. Biggie cheese. et al. Molecular Biology of the Cell. 4th edition. New York: Garland Science; 2002. Innate Immunity. Available from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26846/ The Innate Immune System There are two categories to which parts of the immune system are assigned: the non-specific, or innate immune system and the adaptive immune system. The non-specific response is a generalized response to pathogen infections involving the use of several white blood cells and plasma proteins. Non-specific immunity, or innate immunity, is the immune system with which you were born, made up of phagocytes and barriers. Phagocytosis, derived from the Greek words , meaning to eat, or cell, and ‚Äúosis‚Äù meaning process, was first described by √âlie Metchnikoff, who won the Nobel Prize 100 years ago. Phagocytosis involves the internalization of solids, such as bacteria, by an organism. Phagocytosis in Three Steps Macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells are all cells of the innate immune system that utilize phagocytosis and are equipped with Toll-like receptors (TLR). Toll-like receptors are present on each of these cells and recognize a variety of microbial products resulting in the induction of more specific immune responses. When a phagocytic cell engulfs bacteria, a phagosome is formed around it and the entire complex is ultimately trafficked to the lysosome for degradation. These cells that participate in the non-specific immune system response do not differentiate between types of microorganisms but do have the ability to discern between what is self and what is non-self. The cells of this system are known as non- specific immune cells. Cells of the Innate Immune System Neutrophils are a type of phagocyte, abundant in blood, that phagocytize pathogens in acute inflammation. Neutrophils, along with eosinophils and basophils, make up the category of granulocytes. Macrophages, also known as monocytes, will phagocytize a wide range of molecules. Dendritic cells are tree-like cells that bind antigens and alert the lymphocytes of infection, essentially directing T cells to make an immune response. Complement proteins are proteins that play a role in the non-specific immune responses alongside these non- specific immune cells to make up the first line of immune defense. The non- specific immune response is an immediate antigen-independent response, however it is not antigen-specific. Non-specific immunity results in no immunologic memory. There are mechanical, chemical, and biological factors affecting the effectiveness and results of the non-specific immune response. These factors include the epithelial surfaces forming a physical barrier, fatty acids that inhibit the growth of bacteria, and the microflora of the gastrointestinal tract serving to prevent the colonization of pathogenic bacteria. The non- specific immune system involves cells to which antigens are not specific in regards to fighting infection. The non-specific immune cells mentioned above (macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells) will be discussed regarding their immediate response to infection. =Macrophages= Macrophage infected with bacteria. Macrophages display a plasticity that allows them to respond to numerous types of infections, permitting them to change their physiology, while serving as a common ‚Äújanitorial cell‚Äù to the immune system. Macrophages are produced through the differentiation of monocytes, and after ingestion of bacteria, secrete enzymes to destroy the ingested particle. These cells reside in every tissue of the body, and upon infected tissue, are recruited to the tissue. Once recruited, macrophages will differentiate into specific tissue macrophages. The receptors of macrophages consist of a broad specificity that allows them to discern between self and non-self in the non-specific recognition of foreign substances. There are type I and type II receptors present on macrophages, which are trimeric membrane glycoproteins each containing an NH2-terminal intracellular domain, an extracellular domain with a spacer region and an alpha-helical domain. Contrary to the structure of type II, type I receptors have a cysteine-rich COOH-terminal domain. These characteristics of macrophage receptors confer the broad specificity, which allow them to function as a general non-specific immune cell. =Neutrophils= Neutrophil ingesting Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Neutrophils are some of the first immune cells to travel to sites of infection that aid in fighting infection by ingesting microorganisms and providing the enzymes to kill them. This process characterizes neutrophils as a type of phagocyte. Neutrophils contain neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), composed of granule and nuclear constituents, which play a role in breaking up and killing bacteria that has invaded the immune system. NETs, composed of activated neutrophils, are fragile structures consisting of smooth stretches and globular domains, as shown via high-resolution scanning electron microscopy. After stimulation of the neutrophil response, neutrophils lose their shape, allowing euchromatin and heterochromatin to homogenize, later resulting in the mixing of NET components. The formation of NETs happens once the nuclear envelope and granule membrane of the neutrophils disintegrates. The NETs are released as the cell membrane breaks, resulting in a unique process of cell death. These NET structures of neutrophils bind Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, as well as fungi, which confers broad specificity of neutrophils, explaining their role in the first line of defense once microbes have invaded. =Dendritic Cells= Dendritic cell. The classification of dendritic cells as another type of white blood cell occurred over thirty-five years ago by Ralph Steinmann and Zanvil A. Cohn and has provided an essential link in the innate immune system. Dendritic cells line airways and intestines, participate in a rich network making up part of the epidermal layer of the skin, and play a unique role in initiating a primary immune response. Dendritic cells are named after their structure that resembles that of a dendrite of an axon, and they have two vital functions: display antigens, which are recognized by T cells and alert lymphocytes of the presence of an injury or infection. When the body is introduced to infection or injury, dendritic cells migrate to immune or lymphoid tissues. These two types of tissues are rich in T cells, the cells whose actions are induced by dendritic cells. Dendritic cells will capture antigens and engulf them through the process of phagocytosis. Dendritic cells contain Toll-like receptors (TLR) that will recognize a broad variety of microorganisms in the case of invasion. The activation of these receptors stimulates specific antigen responses and development of antigen-specific adaptive immunity. A unique feature of dendritic cells is that they are able to open up the tight junctions between epithelial cells and sample invaders themselves, all while maintaining the integrity of the epithelial barrier with expression of their own tight- junction proteins. A real life example of dendritic cell functions is displayed in the rejection of organ transplants.

It forms part of the Greater Buenos Aires urban conurbation. The settlement was named in honour of Felipe Llavallol who governed Buenos Aires between the end of the Battle of Cepeda (1859) and 1860.  History  At the arrival of the Spaniards these lands were occupied by the querand√≠es. In 1580, the Spanish conqueror Juan de Garay and 80 neighbors founded for the second time Buenos Aires. Later Garay led an expedition against the tribes of the area, taking part of the expulsion of all the autochthonous inhabitants. In 1585 land grants were granted, executed by Juan Torres de Vera Arag√≥n, and the limits were established taking as a reference the streams, hills, rivers and any natural element that could be used as such. This area corresponded to the Andalusian Pedro L√≥pez de Tarifa, who was awarded land with the Matanza River half a league wide by two leagues long. He was married to Antonia de Humanes y Molina, probably the first European inhabitant of this region. Around 1603-1605, Francisco Garc√≠a Romero, married to Mariana Gonz√°lez de Santa Cruz, buys the land of Pedro L√≥pez de Tarifa, and in turn increases the estate with the acquisition of other lands and gives rise to the creation of the hacienda \\"El Cabezuelo\\", dedicated to the breeding of cattle and whose extension was of 370 km ¬≤, being the greater establishment of the century in its type. In 1721, at the death of the grandsons of Garcia Romero, the estancia is subdivided and auctioned. Captain Gaspar de Avellaneda acquires what is now Llavallol, including the lands of what is now Santa Catalina, the name imposed by Captain Avellaneda in honor of St. Catherine of Siena . The rest of the lands were acquired by Pedro de Espinoza, who in 1737 sold them to Juan de Zamora. The place ceased to be called \\"El Cabezuelo\\" to become \\"the hills of Zamora\\".  Colonia Santa Catalina  In 1825 on the initiative of Bernardino Rivadavia and John Parish Robertson a Scottish colony was established in the zone. The first contingent of Scots left the port of Leith in May 1825. There were 43 marriages with 78 children and 14 women and 42 single men. Among them were doctors, surveyors, builders, architects and artisans, as well as farmers and ranchers. They arrived in Buenos Aires in August 1825. For the construction of the houses of the colony had been contracted to the architect Richard Adams, born in Scotland, who had also been hired to build the first Anglican church in Argentina. The Colonia de Santa Catalina was mainly dedicated to the production of dairy products. Guillermo Taylien acquired the lands belonging to the Robertson brothers and installed, in 1832, the first hut of sheep breeders of the country with specimens coming from the United Kingdom. The lands of the area of Monte Grande became property of Tom√°s Fair, until the town of that name was founded in 1889. In 1851 the territories of Santa Catalina happened to be property of the Irish Patricio Bookey, that once settled, had wide participation in the creation of the party of Lomas in 1861. He went bankrupt in 1867. The following year (1868) the Rural Society Argentina chose the space of Santa Catalina for the creation of the Agricultural Institute, which was an advance in the practice of agriculture and some projection towards the cattle ranch. In 1885 The Argentine Army established in the zone the Regimiento 7.¬∫ de Caballer√≠a commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Arriola . (The military base functioned until 1926) In 1885 was built in the Colony, a Correctional of Minors, who were taught lessons in agriculture and livestock. That same year 1885 the railway branch was inaugurated to Ca√±uelas, and Santa Catalina was called the Primera Estaci√≥n (First Station). The 30 of August 1885 the name of Felipe Llavallol was imposed to him to this railway station. The railway station and the town of Llavallol take its name in tribute to Felipe Llavallol (1802-1874), politician of a wealthy family, that exerted the governorship of Buenos Aires from the Battle of Cepeda (from 1859) until May 3 Of 1860. In 1889 the Agronomic Institute moved to the city of La Plata, and in its place, the School of Agriculture and Livestock was installed, whose cycle would extend until 1928. In 1897, given the great number of people who professed the Protestant religion, the Cemetery of the Dissidents was inaugurated, destined to the population of British and American origin. In 1890 the current Llavallol Station was inaugurated. In 1904 the Colegio Euskal Echea was founded, a private educational establishment originally intended for members of the Basque community of Argentina. In 1908 the German entrepreneur, Emilio Bieckert installed in Llavallol the brewery Bieckert, one of the greatest of its time.

It is a common understory tree in rain-forests in western central Africa - from Sierra Leone to W Cameroons, and on into the DR Congo and Uganda. The medium-sized tree (up to 30 meters tall) is evergreen and dioecious (male and female flowers on different plants). The wood is said to be resistant to termites but is not particularly durable. It is fairly easy to work and finishes well but it is of little commercial importance though it has appeared on the market in Liberia as ‚Äòlacewood‚Äô. Uses The wood is used in Nigeria in hut-building for making walls, doors and window-frames, and in Liberia for planks. In Ghana small trees are cut for poles and find use as mine pit-props and bridge-piles. The twigs are used in Ghana as candlesticks, and the smaller ones as chew-sticks and tooth-picks in Ghana and Gabon. The inner bark contains a sticky yellow resin. The bark has anodynal properties. In the Region it is pounded and rubbed on the body to relieve painful conditions. In Gabon a decoction is taken for dysentery and as a mouthwash for toothache and in Congo (Brazzaville) for stomach-pains. In Congo a decoction of the bark or the leaves is taken for cough, asthma, bronchitis and other bronchial affections while the lees from this preparation are rubbed over areas of pain after scarification. The tree's fruit are not really edible but its seeds are the source of Allanblackia Oil long used by local populations. Nigeria is developing infrastructure for international-scale commercial use. It is estimated Nigeria produced about 50 tons of allanblackia oil in 2006. Domesticating Allanblackia floribunda is being attempted. Presently the seed is collected only from wild stands or from trees retained on farm land (When clearing land for cultivation trees are left and managed, especially for shading cocoa).

Nicotine lozenges are intended to help individuals quit smoking and are generally an over-the-counter medication. Nicotine lozenges are commonly found in 2 mg and 4 mg strengths, although other strengths may be found. The nicotine is absorbed through the lining of the mouth and enters the blood vessels. It is used as an aid in nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), a process for smoking cessation.  Dosages  The dosing of nicotine lozenge is based on nicotine dependence, which is determined by when a smoker has his/her first cigarette of the day.

Published in 1959, The Double Hook is written in a style more like prose poetry than fiction. It is often considered to be Canada's first modernist novel due to how it \\"departs from traditional plot, character development, form and style to tell a poetic tale of human suffering and redemption that is at once fabular, allegorical and symbolic.\\"Neil Besner, \\"The Double Hook\\", The Canadian Encyclopedia (Edmonton: Hurtig, 1988), 613. The Canadian Encyclopedia declares that: \\"Publication of Watson's novel The Double Hook (1959) marks the start of contemporary writing in Canada.\\"Stephen Scobie, \\"Watson, Sheila\\", Canadian Encyclopedia (Edmonton: Hurtig, 1988), 2284. Watson said that her novel is \\"about how people are driven, how if they have no art, how if they have no tradition, how if they have no ritual, they are driven in one of two ways, either towards violence or towards insensibility - if they have no mediating rituals which manifest themselves in what I suppose we call art forms.\\" She has explained that the \\"double hook\\" of her title refers to the idea \\"that when you fish for the glory you catch the darkness too. That if you hook twice the glory you hook twice the fear.\\" History Watson wrote The Double Hook between 1952 and 1954 in Calgary, Alberta and revised it during a year spent in Paris. Throughout the 1950s she was unable to find a publisher. \\"T.S. Eliot at Faber & Faber, C. Day-Lewis at Chatto & Windus, and Rupert Hart-Davis all turned it down.\\" McClelland & Stewart optioned the book in Canada, largely on the strength of a covering letter by Fred Salter of the University of Alberta calling it \\"the most brilliant piece of fiction ever written in Canada.\\" To decide on publication, though, the company sought the opinion of its modernist poet, Earle Birney. Birney found The Double Hook \\"monotonous, self-conscious, artificial, and lacking in real fictional interest\\", and admitted that \\"I just don‚Äôt know what the damned novel is about.\\" He did say that the novel's \\"poetic-cryptic style\\" made it \\"certainly a remarkable piece of writing\\", but ultimately advised against publication. McClelland & Stewart were also unable to interest an American publisher in simultaneous publication. \\"Harcourt- Brace, Knopf, Atheneum, Random House, and New Directions agreed that although The Double Hook was not without merit, they were not interested in losing money on it.\\" Alfred Knopf Sr. wrote to Jack McClelland that \\"\\"I'm afraid we simply can't go along with Professor Salter in the matter of Sheila Watson's The Double Hook. We don't feel it could conceivably sell, and it doesn't seem to us to be anything like distinguished enough to justify Salter's hoop'la.\\" In 1959 The Double Hook was published, and instantly recognized as a modern classic. \\"All 3,000 copies of the initial print run were sold. Supporters such as Marshall McLuhan, as well as Yale formalist Cleanth Brooks, saw it as a literary landmark ushering the Canadian novel out of its regional confines.\\"\\"John Rendell Smith, \\"How Sheila Watson's The Double Hook Caught On,' Historical Perspectives on Canadian Publishing, McMasterU.ca, Web, Apr. 22, 2011. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation later approached Watson to option the film rights to The Double Hook. However, because they would not give her veto rights over the script, she turned them down. The novel has remained in print continuously since 1959, as part of McClelland & Stewart's New Canadian Library. It has also been published in Swedish as Dubbelkroken in 1963 (translated by Artur LundkvistFrank Davey, \\"Sheila Watson Biography\\", Encyclopedia of Literature, 8873, Web, May 30, 2014.), in French as Sous l'oeil de coyote in 1976 (translated by Arlette Franci√®re ), and in Italian as Il doppio amo in 1992. =Deep Hollow Creek= In 1992 the New Canadian Library published another novel, Deep Hollow Creek, which Watson had written in the 1930s. \\"Deep Hollow Creek treats many of the same themes\\" as The Double Hook \\"in a manner which is more direct and conventional, but no less elliptical and challenging.\\"  Plot and characters  \\"The Double Hook presents in concise, symbolic terms a drama of social disintegration and redemption, set in an isolated BC community.... These themes are presented in a style which itself balances on a 'double hook': it is simultaneously local and universal, realistic and symbolic.\\" \\"Watson weaves Christian myth, native legend and natural symbol into a profound prose poem.\\" The Double Hook takes place in a small, rural Canadian community. Although compared to the Biblical city of Nineveh, the community is not specifically named. The main characters are James, his sister Greta, and his brother William. Their deceased mother is simply called The Old Lady and plays a near-mythical role in the novel. Other characters include Felix and Angel who are married with unnamed children; Ara who is married to James' brother, William; Heinrich (also called The Boy), Lenchen, and their mother, Widow Wagner. There are two other minor characters, Theophil and Kip. The novel opens with James killing the Old Lady. \\"When James Potter kills his mother in the opening scene, he sets in motion the Potter family's struggle against fear - symbolized most dramatically by the figure of Coyote - and with various forms of withdrawal from community into isolation.\\" Within the context of Nineveh, though, his matricide is considered a good act as it is The Old Lady who creates negative energy in the community. The Old Lady fishes on everyone's property, yet this act of fishing is negative and symbolic of death. The Old Lady has no use for the fish, she simply continually kills them without using them for nourishment. This act can be seen as a Christian parable: as The Old Lady kills fish she can be viewed as the Anti-Christ, since Jesus used one fish to feed a whole town. The idea of the fisher in the damaged land also unavoidably recalls the Arthurian legends of the Fisher King. Despite the fact that The Old Lady is dead, she is seen throughout the novel on the properties of Felix and the Wagners, which perpetuates her inhuman qualities. James Potter's \\"return to his isolated community in the Rockies after first fleeing to town represents the rebirth of hope and the confrontation with fear which might knit the Potters into a human community.\\"  Bibliography  *The Double Hook.

It is commonly applied in radical retropubic prostatectomy, a surgical treatment for prostate cancer, in which damage to nerves during surgery can lead to complications including urinary incontinence and impotence. In nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy, initially developed by Dr. Patrick Walsh in the 1980s, surgeons identify and attempt to avoid damaging the nerves. Surgeons may visually identify the cavernous nerves of penis or apply an electrical stimulation penile plethysmograph diagnostic test to verify the nerves, and so avoid damaging them. The bilateral approach attempts to spare the nerves on both sides of the prostate. The unilateral approach is specific to one side, usually because the prostate cancer has spread to prevent a bilateral nerve sparing approach; studies suggest that this approach leads to better results than non-nerve-sparing surgery, but that patient age and previous erectile function have a significant influence on post-operative results.

North-south cross-section of the upper crust of southern England, showing the Paleogene London Basin to the north and Hampshire Basin to the south. Also visible is the inverted nature of the Weald, which was a basin during the Early Cretaceous and thus has a relatively thick Lower Cretaceous sequence. Vertical exaggeration 1:5. Geological map of the Hampshire Basin The Hampshire Basin is a geological basin of Palaeogene age in southern England, underlying parts of Hampshire, the Isle of Wight, Dorset, and Sussex. Like the London Basin to the northeast, it is filled with sands and clays of Paleocene and younger ages and it is surrounded by a broken rim of chalk hills of Cretaceous age. Extent The Hampshire Basin is the traditional name for the landward section of a basin underlying the northern English Channel and much of central southern England, known more fully as the Hampshire-Dieppe Basin. It stretches a little over 100 miles (160 km) from the Dorchester area in the west to Beachy Head in the east. Its southern boundary is marked by a monocline, the Purbeck Monocline, resulting in a near-vertical chalk ridge which forms the Purbeck Hills of Dorset, running under the sea from Old Harry Rocks to The Needles and the central spine of the Isle of Wight and continuing under the English Channel as the Wight-Bray monocline. The northern limit is the chalk of the South Downs, Salisbury Plain and Cranborne Chase. The basin at its widest is around from north to south between Salisbury and Newport. The area west of the River Avon is usually known as the Poole Basin. Geography The basin includes areas of forest and heath including Wareham Forest, Arne and the New Forest and the large south coast settlements of Bournemouth, Southampton and Portsmouth. The coast has many drowned valleys (rias) including The Solent, Poole Harbour, Southampton Water, Portsmouth Harbour, Chichester Harbour, Langstone Harbour, Pagham Harbour, Yarmouth, Cowes and Bembridge. In addition to the northern half of the Isle of Wight which lies within the basin, the harbours contain inhabited islands including Brownsea Island, Portsea Island, Hayling Island and Thorney Island. Drainage The Hampshire Basin has no single dominant river. In former times the Frome and Solent rivers would have drained much of the basin from west to east, fed by tributaries flowing from the north and south.Jones K.C.D. (Ed), The Shaping of Southern England, Institute of British Geographers Special Publication 11, Academic Press, 1980, Bird, E (1997), The Shaping of the Isle of Wight, Bradford on Avon:Ex Libris Press, At the end of the last ice age this system was disrupted by rising sea levels, which separated the Isle of Wight from the mainland. Today the western part of the basin drains via the rivers Frome and Piddle into Poole Harbour, and via the Stour and Avon directly to the English Channel. The central part drains into the Solent (directly or via Southampton Water), through the Lymington River, Test, Itchen, Meon, Hamble, Western Yar, Medina and Eastern Yar. The eastern part of the basin is a narrow coastal plain draining into the many harbours via small streams, and is crossed by larger rivers draining the Weald including the Arun and Adur. Geology The main basin consists of an asymmetric syncline in the Cretaceous chalk, with a gentle dip southwards from Salisbury Plain terminating abruptly at a near vertical monocline in the south. The chalk surface dips from around 170 metres (560 ft) above sea level west of Winchester to below sea level at Newport,Melville, R.V. & Freshney E.C (4th Ed 1982), The Hampshire Basin and adjoining areas, British Regional Geology series, Institute of Geological Sciences, London: HMSO, before rising abruptly to around above sea level in parts of the central hills of the Isle of Wight and the Purbeck Hills. The chalk can be visualised as a thin layer draped over rigid blocks of older rocks at depth, which have moved vertically due to the Alpine Orogeny. Beneath the chalk the geology is complex. It is believed that a series of major blocks separated by faults trending NW-SE is fragmented into smaller blocks by numerous east-west trending faults; one such block acts as a trap for the Wytch Farm oil field. These blocks have moved vertically relative to each other during late Palaeozoic and Mesozoic times, resulting in considerable variations in the thickness of the various formations deposited over them before the chalk. Rocks of Lower Greensand (Aptian) age were deposited over an eroded surface, which ranges from Great Oolite (Early Jurassic Bathonian) to Weald Clay (mid-Cretaceous Hauterivian) in age.Andrews I.J & Balson P.S. (1995), Wight: Sheet 50N 02W Solid Geology, 1:250,000 Geological map series, Keyworth: British Geological Survey, . The chalk itself varies considerably in thickness, with the results of a marine transgression progressing across into Dorset from the east. There is evidence that the top of the Upper Greensand to the west is the same age as the oldest chalk in the Isle of Wight. Above the chalk the basin contains Palaeogene sediments ranging from Thanetian (Palaeocene) age to Rupelian (Oligocene) age. The oldest beds, the Lambeth Group ('Reading Beds') and Thames Group ('London Clay') outcrop in narrow bands towards the perimeter of the basin, from the coast at Studland, around the perimeter of the Dorset heathlands,Edwards R.A., Crosby A. & Briden J.C (1983), Portland: Sheet 50N 04W Solid Geology, 1:250,000 Geological map series, Keyworth: British Geological Survey, north and east past Romsey, swinging southeast past Eastleigh and eastwards towards Chichester, Worthing and Shoreham-by-Sea. Within this rim, over the greater part of the basin is an outcrop of younger Eocene deposits, the Bagshot, Bracklesham and Barton beds. The youngest, Oligocene beds (Bouldnor Formation) only occur on the northern Isle of Wight; the Headon Hill beds of the New Forest, formerly classified as Oligocene, are now regarded as late Eocene. The simple basin structure is complicated by localised folding. A smaller outcrop of Palaeocene and Eocene deposits occurs in a small syncline to the south-east of Salisbury.Jackson, A.A. (1991), Chilterns: Sheet 51N 02W Solid Geology, 1:250,000 Geological map series, Keyworth: British Geological Survey, An anticline to the north of Portsmouth results in the significant chalk ridge of Portsdown Hill within the younger sediments; the London Clay to the north contains the Forest of Bere.Trueman A.E. revised by Whittow J.B. and Hardy J.R (1971), Geology and Scenery in England and Wales, Harmondsworth: Penguin books, A similar structure further east causes chalk to outcrop between Bognor Regis and Worthing, separated from the chalk of the South Downs by a belt of Reading Beds and London Clay continuing from Havant through Chichester and south of Arundel to the coast at Lancing. It is likely that the London and Hampshire basins were initially part of a single larger area of deposition covering the whole of southeast England during the Palaeocene. The two basins were progressively separated by the emergence of the Weald-Artois Anticline during the Eocene. By the Oligocene the London Basin was wholly dry land, and only a small part of the Hampshire Basin, centred on the modern Solent, was an area of marine deposition.

South Lyon was incorporated as a village in 1873 and as a city in 1930 Three rail lines once passed through South Lyon. In the summer of 1871, the Detroit, Lansing and Northern was built west from Plymouth on the way to Lansing and Ionia. In 1880, the predessor to the Ann Arbor Railroad built a line into town from Ann Arbor. The goal of this line was to continue on towards Pontiac but that did not occur under the original owners. The line was pulled up around 1890. In 1883 the Grand Trunk built their Jackson Branch from Pontiac to Jackson, which crossed the Pere Marquette at South Lyon. The GTW branch line continued to serve South Lyon until the early 1980s. The branch line is now a paved bicycle trail through town and Reynold Sweet Parkway follows the original route. Today, South Lyon hosts the CSX main line from Detroit to Grand Rapids, and a passing track is located there. Law enforcement services for the city are provided by the South Lyon Police Department.

History Slicer started as a master's thesis project between the Surgical Planning Laboratory at the Brigham and Women's Hospital and the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory in 1998. 3D Slicer version 2 has been downloaded several thousand times. In 2007 a completely revamped version 3 of Slicer was released. The next major refactoring of Slicer was initiated in 2009, which transitioned the GUI of Slicer from using KWWidgets to Qt. Qt-enabled Slicer version 4 was released in 2011. Slicer software has enabled a variety of research publications, all aimed at improving image analysis. This significant software project has been enabled by the participation of several large-scale NIH funded efforts, including the NA-MIC, NAC, BIRN, CIMIT, Harvard Catalyst and NCIGT communities. The funding support comes from several federal funding sources, including NCRR, NIBIB, NIH Roadmap, NCI, NSF and the DOD. Users Slicer's platform provides functionalities for segmentation, registration and three- dimensional visualization of multimodal image data, as well as advanced image analysis algorithms for diffusion tensor imaging, functional magnetic resonance imaging and image-guided radiation therapy. Standard image file formats are supported, and the application integrates interface capabilities to biomedical research software. Slicer has been used in a variety of clinical research. In image-guided therapy research, Slicer is frequently used to construct and visualize collections of MRI data that are available pre- and intra-operatively to allow for the acquiring of spatial coordinates for instrument tracking. In fact, Slicer has already played such a pivotal role in image-guided therapy, it can be considered as growing up alongside that field, with over 200 publications referencing Slicer since 1998.For a list of publications citing Slicer usage since 1998, visit: http://www.slicer.org/publications/pages/display/?collectionid=11 In addition to producing 3D models from conventional MRI images, Slicer has also been used to present information derived from fMRI (using MRI to assess blood flow in the brain related to neural or spinal cord activity), DTI (using MRI to measure the restricted diffusion of water in imaged tissue), and electrocardiography. For example, Slicer's DTI package allows the conversion and analysis of DTI images. The results of such analysis can be integrated with the results from analysis of morphologic MRI, MR angiograms and fMRI. Other uses of Slicer include paleontologyhttp://openpaleo.blogspot.com/2009/03/3d-slicer-tutorial-part- vi.html and neurosurgery planning.http://picasaweb.google.com/107065747472066371420 Developers The Slicer Developer Orientation offers resources for developers new to the platform. Slicer development is coordinated on the slicer-devel mailing list, and a summary of development statistics is available on Ohloh. 3D Slicer is built on VTK, a pipeline-based graphical library that is widely used in scientific visualization and ITK, a framework widely used for the development of image segmentation and image registration. In version 4, the core application is implemented in C++, and the API is available through a Python wrapper to facilitate rapid, iterative development and visualization in the included Python console. The user interface is implemented in Qt, and may be extended using either C++ or Python. Slicer supports several types of modular development. Fully interactive, custom interfaces may be written in C++ or Python. Command-line programs in any language may be wrapped using a light- weight XML specification, from which a graphical interface is automatically generated. For modules that are not distributed in the Slicer core application, a system is available to automatically build and distribute for selective download from within Slicer. This mechanism facilitates the incorporation of code with different license requirements from the permissive BSD-style license used for the Slicer core. The Slicer build process utilizes CMake to automatically build prerequisite and optional libraries (excluding Qt). The core development cycle incorporates automatic testing, as well as incremental and nightly builds on all platforms, monitored using an online dashboard.

During his club career he played for Ards, Glentoran, Newcastle United, Burnley and APOEL Nicosia. He earned 24 caps for the Northern Ireland national football team, and was part of the team at the 1982 FIFA World Cup when Northern Ireland reached the second round. After retirement from playing he became a manager, taking charge of Ards, Sligo Rovers, Workington, Whitby Town and Blyth Spartans. Biography Cassidy was born in Belfast. As a teenage striker he made an impressive impact on the Irish League. In 1969, after just a handful of senior appearances, he scored a hat-trick in the City Cup (Northern Ireland) Final, as Glentoran saw off Bangor 7‚Äì1. Early the following season, Cassidy having found the net four times in just six appearances, Newcastle United came calling with a ¬£15,000 bid. In October 1970 Cassidy found himself at an English First Division club after just fourteen senior outings for Glentoran. Although Cassidy's Football League debut didn't take long to arrive, he made his first appearance in a 2‚Äì0 defeat at Southampton on 7 November 1970, he had to wait three seasons to establish himself in the Newcastle first eleven. Prior to establishing himself, a rare senior outing was made in the 2-1 1973 Anglo-Italian Cup Final defeat of ACF Fiorentina . By that time he was playing more normally as an attacking midfielder, and in his first season as a regular (1973/74) he helped Newcastle to a Texaco (British Isles) Cup Final victory over Burnley and an FA Cup Final appearance against Liverpool. The following season Cassidy was troubled by injury and made just nine League appearances, though he did play in the first leg of the Texaco Cup Final as Newcastle retained the trophy 3‚Äì1 on aggregate against Southampton. The following season Newcastle were back at Wembley for another final, losing out 2‚Äì1 in the League Cup to Manchester City. Cassidy's Northern Ireland career had begun at the end of his first season in English football, coming on as a substitute for Eric McMordie in a 1-0 Home Nations defeat by England. The following season he made a further substitute appearance in a 1-1 European Championship Qualification match against the Soviet Union. As with his club career he had to bide his time before establishing himself in the international set-up. The real breakthrough with Northern Ireland came in 1973/74 as well, he marked his fourth cap, his first as a starter, with the only goal in a 1‚Äì0 win over Scotland. It was to be his only international goal, and the last time he was on a victorious Northern Ireland team until 1979. Through the mid-1970s, injuries permitting, Cassidy was a regular in the Northern Ireland team, until a falling out with Danny Blanchflower saw him banished from the set-up for two years. He did however return to favour for Blanchflower's last few matches, starting in a 5‚Äì1 defeat by England at Wembley, and coming off the bench during a 1‚Äì0 victory over the Republic of Ireland at Windsor Park. Groin, knee and ankle injuries had taken their toll on Cassidy's pace, and by the time Billy Bingham was appointed Northern Ireland manager in 1980, Cassidy was more at home as a defensive midfielder. Bingham used Cassidy in this role for each of his first nine games in charge, thus allowing the likes of McIlroy, Brotherston, Finney and O'Neill to make a suitable attacking impact. He played an important role in Northern Ireland's 1980 Home Nation Championship success, helping bring the old trophy back to Belfast for the first time in 66 years. Cassidy's last season for Newcastle was 1979‚Äì1980, when the team topped the second division table at the start of 1980 and looked set to be promoted. Cassidy netted two notable goals at the end of the year, first scoring a 20-yard volley against Queens Park Rangers on 15 December to put the side 3-2 up (the game ended 4-2) and then registering an even better effort against Sunderland on New Year's Day to seal a 3‚Äì1 home win. Newcastle though dropped away and finished the season ninth. A ¬£30,000 move to Burnley, freshly relegated to Division Three, in the summer of 1980, did not initially harm Cassidy's international career, but over the following few seasons it became clear that Bingham was favouring players featuring regularly at a higher level. A few moments of glory in green remained however. In November 1981 he was called up to replace Martin O'Neill for the final World Cup Qualifier against Israel, a must win game to insure a place in Spain. Sure enough, Northern Ireland won 1‚Äì0, and Cassidy travelled with the squad to the Finals. In Spain he made a single appearance, coming off the bench for the injured Sammy McIlroy, and helping to steady ten-man Northern Ireland, during the historic 1‚Äì0 win over the hosts. Spain brought the curtain down on Cassidy's, somewhat up-and-down, international career in the most glorious of fashions. Having helped Burnley to the Third Division title before travelling to Spain, Cassidy brought his Football League career to a close in 1983, before moving to play for APOEL in Cyprus, where he won the Cup and the Super Cup. He later managed the club, leading them to the Cypriot League Championship, but left when he blew the whistle on high-level corruption in the game. He returned to the north-east of England to manage Gateshead, and was linked with the Newcastle job in 1992 prior to the arrival of Kevin Keegan. In 1994, he returned to the Oval as manager of a demoralised Glentoran, and helped them to an early success in the Gold Cup. The rest of his time with the Glens proved difficult, with high-profile cup final failures and expensive transfer flops such as Liam Coyle being tempered only slightly by an Irish Cup Final win over Glenavon in 1996. Under pressure from the fans, Cassidy left Glentoran in December 1997.http://www.glentoran-fc.co.uk/managers.htm In 1998 Cassidy was appointed manager of Ards, but was sacked in October 1999 when the board weren't satisfied with their prospects of promotion from the First Division ‚Äì they were second at the time. Less than a month later Cassidy took charge of Sligo Rovers. In his first home game Sligo lost 5‚Äì3 to Shamrock Rovers and Cassidy got sent off . He couldn't save them from relegation from the Premier Division at the end of his first season. Sligo just missed out on promotion the following year when they lost the final match of the campaign 4‚Äì1 to Home Farm, and Cassidy left the club that summer . He briefly scouted Irish League players for then Northern Ireland manager Sammy McIlroy, before returning to management with Northern League Division One club, Workington. He guided the Reds to promotion to the Premier League in 2004, and runners-up spot the following season saw the club promoted to the Football Conference Northern Division. On 16 December 2011 he joined Blyth Spartans as manager, but in October 2012 he was sacked by the club.

It combined punk, folk and rock and roll, often augmented by humorous lyrics and outrageous dance routines. Early career The Vulcans' first live show was at the Irish Club, Elm Grove, Portsmouth in 1979. Sue Vulcan was now on vocals after the original singer, Pete Vulcan, quit just before the debut show. By the early 1980s, the band's sound and image was influenced by Bow Wow Wow and The Clash. Early songs included \\"There's A Riot Going on in The City\\", \\"Brain Cancer\\" and \\"Ear Muffs\\". Gigs at the Bum in the Air Festival and the college circuit followed. Later career By 1983, all band members had relocated to Harlesden, and the most successful line-up, Dan Vulcan, Harry Vulcan, Mark Vulcan, Nick Vulcan, Pete Vulcan and Ray Vulcan began busking in London's Covent Garden. They met Eddie Izzard there, who later invited The Vulcans to be the house band on his first television series; and later The Vicious Boys, who commissioned the band to compose and perform the theme for their LWT series, Wake Up London. After a successful European tour in 1983, the band unexpectedly split as three members of the band (Vulcans Dan, Mark and Ray) embarked on art college courses. This career detour lasted less than 18 months, by which time the six band members had reformed, and were starring weekly in Izzard's TV show. Other notable television appearances were on BBC Television's Whicker's World (\\"Living with Uncle Sam featuring Brits in America\\") and A Small Problem, starring The Young Ones' Christopher Ryan. By 1986, and now sharing a squat in Brixton, The Vulcans had become stalwarts on the London gig scene. They performed their best known song, \\"Hard Hat Zone\\", an analogous comment on the dangers of living in urban areas. Preoccupations with mental difficulties caused by heavy drinking peppered their lyrics. \\"Diddle-I\\", an electric folk piece was produced by the saxophonist, Pete Thomas, and it received regular radio airplay. In 1987, weighed down by drum machines and synthesisers, the band widened their repertoire to embark on conceptual compositions. They split in January 1989.

It stood at the junction of Warwick Road (B4086) and Brookhampton Lane, on a site now occupied by the Plantagenet trading estate. History Opened on 1 June 1871, the station was situated on the East and West Junction Railway's route from Stratford-upon-Avon to Fenny Compton. Until July 1873, it was the headquarters and western terminus of the line. When the connection to Stratford was completed, the latter became the headquarters. Business did not meet expectations and, in 1877, the station closed. In attempt to improve matters, an extension to Broom Junction was incorporated in 1873 by means of a railway called the \\"Evesham Redditch and Stratford-upon- Avon Junction Railway\\" which opened in 1879. As trade picked up, the station was reopened on 22 February 1885.Preston Hendry, R., Powell Hendry, R., (1982) An historical survey of selected LMS stations : layouts and illustrations. Vol. 1 Oxford Publishing The line became part of the Stratford-upon-Avon and Midland Junction Railway in a merger of 1908 and at grouping in 1923, it became part of the London Midland and Scottish Railway. At nationalisation it became part of the Western Region of British Railways. The station had two platforms for the passing loop on the otherwise single line. It was larger than was usual for the line, the brick built station buildings consisting of two pavilions with a central connection, and with quoined door and window openings. There was a siding to the goods shed and coal yard. This branched off what was, in effect, an extended headshunt to the down side of the loop, and itself had a runaround loop built into it. This was extended in 1959 when the line was modernised by the Western Region. The up line also had a small carriage siding behind the platform with a staff cabin, again connected to the main line by a headshunt. Initially the single line was operated on the \\"one engine in steam\\" principle. However, after completion to Stratford, absolute block working with them was introduced, with electric train staff working after 1894. About four miles to the east, at Burton Dassett, was a connection with the abortive Edge Hill Light Railway. A typical service, as in 1942, would be two through trains in either direction, with the addition of two to Stratford on Saturdays. The passenger service was withdrawn on 7 April 1952, although through traffic continued to gain access to the Great Western Railway at Fenny Compton until 5 July 1965. A short distance to the east, there are military railway sidings serving an ammunition depot. The sidings are also used for rolling stock storage on behalf of British train operators. The area also had an extensive closed rail system used to train military railmen.

It was located at 707 Fulton Street in downtown Brooklyn, New York. Since Nimura & Sato also imported furniture from Asia, confusion sometimes arises as to whether a piece bearing the Nimura and Sato label was manufactured by the partnership or merely imported and retailed by them.  Overview  In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Japan was a pre-industrial society that infused every day objects with a sense of good design, and where handiwork and handcrafts were highly valued. While Japanese ceramics became popular in Britain and North America around the middle of the 19th century, it was not until the 1880s and 1890s that American manufactures, such as Nimura & Sato, began to produce significant quantities of Japanese influenced furniture. Such pieces often contained real or simulated (usually turned-maple) bamboo and woven cane in door panels or tabletops. The Japanese furniture contrasted dramatically with the massive, overstuffed, heavy, dark, and often gaudy Victorian furniture that had been in vogue.

Biography Jolly Blackburn went to Ball State University. Jolly Blackburn majored in anthropology, history, and classical cultures in college. Blackburn later joined the Army, and launched both the gaming magazine Shadis and his company Alderac Entertainment Group (named after his AD&D; campaign world) while still in the Army. The original Shadis was a black-and-white digest featured gaming articles largely written by Blackburn, and each issue featured several pieces of fiction collectively called the \\"Alderac Anthonology\\" which detailed Blackburn's world of Alderac (one of Alderac's moons was Shadis, from which the magazine borrowed its name). He conceived of having a comic strip that became Knights of the Dinner Table (KoDT) in 1990 as part of Shadis: \\"I had been a great fan of J.D. Webster's Finieous Fingers from the early Dragon Magazine, and I wanted something similar. Unfortunately, I couldn't find anyone willing to do a strip. Finally I sat down and drew out a very crude cartoon showing a gamemaster and a player sitting around a table arguing over a rules call.\\" Blackburn based the KoDT characters on friends and fellow players, and B.A. Felton on himself. Blackburn conceived the cartoon as just filler material, but when he replaced it with more professional strips in one issue of Shadis there was an outcry from fans. Blackburn was a sergeant in the army during Operation: Desert Storm. During the conflict Blackburn helped activate reservists for remedial training prior to deployment. The magazine, Shadis, was not published for a year and a half, but Blackburn got back into the publishing business when he returned in 1992. Alderac published three issues of a KoDT comic book in 1994-1995: \\"I soon became aware that the demand for KoDT was much higher than I had ever realized. That got me thinking about doing it on a monthly schedule.\\" Blackburn left Alderac in 1995 because he felt that he and his partners John Zinser and David Seay were looking for success in the CCG industry while he wanted to keep the company fun and small and focus on KoDT. He formed a new company called KODT Enteractive Facktory to publish KoDT monthly. While working at Shadis, Blackburn had made friends with employees of Kenzer & Company: \\"We discovered that we had so much in common, I decided to come aboard and throw my intellectual properties in the kitty.\\" Blackburn joined Kenzer in December 1996, and Kenzer published his comic book monthly beginning with a reprint of issue #4. The KoDT comic strip moved to Dragon in issue #226, becoming very popular. \\"Over the years I've often wondered just what it is that causes all the fuss... I'm the first to look at the typical strip and say, 'It's not all that!'\\" In 2001, Kenzer published the HackMaster role-playing game, which was based on the fictional game played by the characters in the Knights of the Dinner Table comic strip.

The theater portion of the building (now known as the Murat Theatre at Old National Centre) houses the oldest stage house in downtown Indianapolis that is still standing today. It is the only Shrine Center in the world with a French-originating name, and it is the largest Shrine Center in North America. History In 1882, five Freemasons decided they wished to see a Shrine organization in Indianapolis. They joined the Shrine Temple at Cincinnati, Ohio, and had that temple's help in establishing an Indianapolis temple. The local organization of the Shrine, called the Indianapolis Shriners, was given its charter on June 4, 1884. The first potentate was John T. Brush, who served as such from 1884 to 1897. Lew Wallace and Thomas Taggart were among their first Ceremonial Class, held in 1885. By the end of the first year, there were 105 members. The Indianapolis Valley of Scottish Rite gave them the Townsley and Wiggans \\"Pork House\\" for their meetings. The Murat Temple was built in 1909 by the William P. Jungclaus Company using the designs of Murat Shriner Oscar D. Bohlen, with Middle Eastern and Egyptian stylings that were fitting for a building intended for Shriners. Its namesake is the Nubian Desert oasis Bir Murat, which was named for the Frenchman Joachim Murat, who was one of Napoleon's generals in his Egyptian campaign. The Murat Shrine gave the Indianapolis Zoo its first camel and established the 500 Festival Parade. The Murat Shrine is mostly known by the people of Indianapolis for its theater, which was built in 1910. In its early days it featured Broadway plays and even a 1932 speech by Winston Churchill. Between 1948 and 1963, it was the only road show venue in Indianapolis. Before Clowes Memorial Hall opened in 1963, it was the home of the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra; the Orchestra only survived the Great Depression due to the nominal fee the Temple charged the Orchestra for using the theatre. The orchestra made recordings with Fabien Sevitzky in the theater for RCA Victor between 1941 and 1953. The Indianapolis Opera Company briefly used the facility during the 1980s. In 1984, the Murat Shriners had the second largest membership of all Shrine temples in the world. In 1988, a fire broke out in the 1968 addition, injuring 15 firefighters when a portion of the addition collapsed. However, there was relatively little damage to the structure. On April 13, 2000, Murat Shrine hosted a famous wrestling match with a card scheduled by Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW). Days before, ECW World champion, Mike Awesome, left ECW to join rival World Championship Wrestling (WCW). After various legal maneuvers, Awesome agreed to lose his title in Indianapolis. ECW owner Paul Heyman asked the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) to borrow Tazz, who once wrestled in ECW, to defeat Awesome for the title. The WWF consented, and thus a WWF wrestler defeated a WCW wrestler for the ECW Title. This match was not promoted, due to being arranged last-minute, and few in attendance knew the match would take place. Construction The edifice is themed after Moorish mosques found in the Middle East and Egypt. Features of the building include stained-glass windows, terra cotta trim, minarets, and brown and yellow brick banding. A tall tower is at the southeast corner. An addition to the temple was designed to blend with the existing structure. The Egyptian-themed auditorium, added as part of the 1922 addition, had already been planned before the discovery of the 18th dynasty Pharaoh Tutankhamun's tomb, which coincided with the opening of the auditorium. Facilities The main sections of Murat Shrine are the 2,000-seat concert hall and the 2,500-seat performing arts theater. Today, there are nine areas for hosting events. The Egyptian Room can hold 2,000 people for a standing cocktail reception. The smaller areas are the Corinthian Hall, the Corinthian Annex, the Corinthian Meeting Room, the Great Hall, the Imperial Lounge (formerly the \\"Crowne Room\\"), and various lobby areas.

Other oil fields are shown in gray. The South Belridge Oil Field is a large oil field in northwestern Kern County, San Joaquin Valley, California, about forty miles west of Bakersfield. Discovered in 1911, and having a cumulative production of over of oil at the end of 2008, it is the fourth-largest oil field in California, after the Midway-Sunset Oil Field, Kern River Oil Field, and Wilmington Oil Field, and is the sixth-most productive field in the United States. Its estimated remaining reserves, as of the end of 2008, were around , the second-largest in the state, and it had 6,253 active wells. p. 63. The principal operator on the field was Aera Energy LLC, a joint venture between Royal Dutch Shell and ExxonMobil. Additionally, the field included the only onshore wells in California owned and operated by ExxonMobil.DOGGR (2009), 127 Setting The oil field is located along State Route 33, between the junctions with State Route 58 on the south and State Route 46 on the north. The field is in an area of gentle slope to the southwest, just above the San Joaquin Valley which is adjacent on the east; the crest of the Temblor Range, the nearest part of the California Coast Ranges, parallels the oil field about ten miles to the southwest. The field is about long by wide, and encompasses a productive area of . Elevations on the oil field range from approximately ; the elevation of the floor of the San Joaquin Valley to the east is around . The South Belridge Oil Field is part of the larger Belridge Producing Complex of Aera Energy LLC, which includes also the smaller, but still substantial oil fields of North Belridge, Lost Hills, and Cymric, all in northwestern Kern County. The San Joaquin kit fox. Kit foxes can be found on the South Belridge and other Kern County oil fields, as they are tolerant of disturbance, and sometimes use pipes and man-made openings as dens. Most native vegetation is gone from the oil field, with the most dense operational areas being almost completely barren except for pumping units, drilling pads, evaporation ponds, storage tanks, steam generators, and associated equipment. In spite of this seeming sterility, species such as the endangered San Joaquin kit fox (vulpes macrotis mutica) continue to use areas of oil field development as habitat.David Whyte MacDonald, Claudio Sillero-Zubiri: The Biology and Conservation of Wild Canids. Oxford University Press, 2004. p. 194. Geology The South Belridge Field is a southeast-plunging anticline, in which the oil has collected in pools in structural traps sealed by both above- lying impermeable units as well as tar seals. Most of the oil has pooled in the Tulare Formation, of Pleistocene age, and in the Diatomite Formation, of Pliocene‚àíMiocene age. The oil itself probably originated in the underlying Monterey Formation, migrating upward to structural and stratigraphic traps over time.South Belridge fields, Borderland basin, U.S., San Joaquin Valley Extraction A total of six oil pools have been found in the South Belridge: the Tulare, Etchegoin, Diatomite, Antelope Shale, McDonald, and Devilwater- Gould. Both the Tulare and Diatomite were discovered in 1911, and these are both the largest and nearest the surface, with average depths of respectively. The Antelope Shale, at , and the McDonald, at , are the deepest working pools, and are both in the Monterey Formation itself. The Devilwater-Gould, found in 1980 at a depth of feet, only produced from one well for nine months, and was abandoned.DOGGR, California Oil and Gas Fields, pp. 36‚Äì38 Only two of the pools contained significant enough reserves to be subject to enhanced recovery projects: the Tulare and Diatomite, both of which have been steamflooded, waterflooded, and fireflooded. Operators began steamflooding the Tulare Formation in 1963 in order to increase production rates; as of 1997, this was the only enhanced recovery technology still in use there. Oil from the Tulare Formation is heavy crude, with a specific gravity of 10‚Äì13 API, and a low sulfur content of 0.23%, while oil from the Diatomite is classified as medium crude, with an API index of 25‚Äì30.DOGGR, California Oil and Gas Fields, p. 37A row of nodding donkey oil wells at the South Belridge Field =Operations= Belridge Oil Company discovered the field. It retained control of operations until 1979 when Shell Oil purchased the company along with most of the production rights on the South Belridge Field for $3.65 billion. Currently Aera Energy LLC is the main operator on the field. They claim a daily production of of oil equivalent (boe/d) from the entire Belridge Unit, with the oil being shipped to the refineries in Martinez and Torrance for processing into gasoline and other products.Article on South Belridge in the Bakersfield Californian, April 27, 1999Aera Energy LLC ; page on the Belridge operations.

Northern Kosovo has been the centre of unrest following Kosovo's declaration of independence. The 2008 unrest in Kosovo followed Kosovo's declaration of independence on February 17, 2008. Some Kosovo Serbs opposed to secession boycotted the move by refusing to follow orders from the central government in Pristina and attempted to seize infrastructure and border posts in Serb-populated regions. There were also sporadic instances of violence against international institutions and governmental institutions, predominantly in North Kosovo. Tensions in the North intensified when Serbs in Kosovska Mitrovica seized a UN courthouse on March 14, 2008. UN police and NATO forces responded on March 17, and attacks by Serb protesters left one UN police officer dead and as many as 150 people wounded. On June 28, Kosovo Serbs formed the Community Assembly of Kosovo and Metohija to coordinate resistance to the Kosovan Government.  Boycott of Kosovo government  Kosovo Serbs said they intended to form parallel institutions and assert control over infrastructure and institutions in their area in response to Kosovo's declaration of independence; after the local elections in May, Kosovo Serb leaders announced the intention to establish a Kosovo Serb Assembly. The Serbian Orthodox Church in Kosovo said they would not be in contact with Kosovo's Albanian government, EULEX, or any country which recognizes Kosovo's independence, threatening to sanction any clergy who do so. A Serb minister said Serbia planned to have its \\"own police\\" in Serb areas as part of an action plan to maintain Serbia's presence in Kosovo. In North Kosovo some Serb members of Kosovo security forces stopped taking orders from the government in Pristina and claimed command from the UNMIK. In the eastern Gnjilane region around 100 Serb officers were suspended from the Kosovo Police Service. Stanko Jakovljeviƒá, Serb mayor of ≈†trpce, a Serb enclave in the south, said Serb police \\"will do today what Serbs ... did in northern Kosovo. They will only recognise orders from international police.\\" In central Kosovo 126 Serb police officers withdrew from the Kosovo Police Service refusing to take commands from the central government. Members of the Kosovo Police Service said Serb officers were being intimidated to leave the police force. On March 3, 2008, Serb railway workers declared they no longer worked for Kosovo after blocking the passage of freight trains from central to northern Kosovo. The head of Serbia's state railroad company Serbian Railways said Serbia was \\"taking over its responsibilities after nine years\\" and that the northern part of the railway would be integrated into Serbia's railway system. On March 5, 2008 UNMIK forces said they reclaimed the railway after blocking the entry of Serbian trains into Northern Kosovo warning that any movement of trains south would \\"not be tolerated\\". The next day UNMIK officials met with officials from Serbian Railways in Belgrade to discuss the company's demands to run railways in northern Kosovo. The Managing Director of Serbian Railways Milanko ≈†aranƒçiƒá said there was no chance of UNMIK running traffic in the north of Kosovo as employees of Serbian Railways terminated their contracts with UNMIK railways. He also said that the company had begun checking lines in the north, as ‚ÄúUNMIK has not maintained the lines properly for nine years.‚Äú Serb protestors blocked Albanians from working at the courts in North Kosovska Mitrovica, and Serb judges and court employees demanded that they be allowed to work at the courts instead.  Attacks on Kosovo border posts  On Tuesday February 19, 2008 2,000 Serb protestors, some driving bulldozers, set two border posts on fire along the Kosovo‚ÄìSerbia border. The destruction of the border posts was sparked by reports that Kosovo Albanian customs officials were planning to man the borders. UN peacekeepers stationed at the checkpoints were forced to abandon the posts until they were reopened the following day. Attacks at the Mutivoda crossing point on Monday February 25, 2008 by 100 Serbs injured 19 members of the Kosovo Police Service and forced the post to be closed until the next day.  Attacks on the international presence and Kosovo institutions  The day after Kosovo's declaration of independence two bombs in the flashpoint town of Kosovska Mitrovica damaged several UN vehicles, though there were no injuries. After several attacks in northern Kosovska Mitrovica an advance team of the EU administrative force withdrew over security concerns. On March 3, 2008, a UN office in northern Kosovska Mitrovica was hit by two sniper bullets, with no injuries. On March 28, 2008, a police checkpoint in northern Kosovo manned by Serb officers came under fire apparently from a semi-automatic weapon fired from the ethnic Albanian village of Ko≈°utovo, north of Kosovska Mitrovica, and the officers returned fire. No injuries were reported. On June 26, 2008, in the village of Borivojce near the eastern town of Kosovska Kamenica members of the local Serb and Roma community barricaded a road to protest the construction of a mosque authorized by the local government. According to a police statement Serb inhabitants put rocks on the road. Around 100 Albanians on the other side of the barricade started to remove the rocks and then threw stones at them. The police statement say the police then intervened to separate the groups, and that a Kosovo Serb and a police officer were injured. = Seizure of UN courthouse in Kosovska Mitrovica = On March 14, 2008, after staging rallies for several weeks that prevented ethnic Albanian court employees from entering a UN courthouse in the northern part of Kosovska Mitrovica, hundreds of Kosovo Serbs broke into the building in the Serb- dominated part of the city, forcing UN police to retreat. UN officials' negotiations with the Serbs to end the occupation were unsuccessful, and on March 17 UN police with the assistance of NATO-led KFOR forces entered the courthouse in a pre-dawn raid. When they arrived they were pelted with stones by around 100 Serbs. When they came out after arresting 53 of the protesters inside the courthouse they were attacked with gunfire, grenades and rocks by several hundred protesters who had massed outside. About half of the protesters who had been arrested were freed by fellow protesters during the clashes with the rest being released by the UN after questioning. The clashes lasted until around noon. One Ukrainian police officer was killed, 70 Serbs and 61 UN and NATO peacekeepers were wounded, and one UN vehicle and one NATO truck were set ablaze. Among the wounded international troops were 27 Polish and 14 Ukrainian police officers and 20 French soldiers. UN police withdrew from northern Kosovska Mitrovica, leaving the area under the control of the NATO forces. Gen. John Craddock, NATO's top commander, said that after speaking with NATO commanders in Kosovo that NATO did not feel it necessary to send reinforcements to Kosovo. On 19 March, UN police began to patrol parts of north Kosovska Mitrovica again together with local Kosovo police, while the NATO peacekeepers still remained in overall control of security at the courthouse and generally in the north of Kosovo. A gradual transition to civilian control was planned over the next days.  Reactions  *border Kosovo Pieter Feith, the International Civilian Representative in Kosovo and the EU's envoy to Kosovo, accused Serbia of attempting to \\"sever the links\\" between Albanians and Serbs in Kosovo. Feith added that the international steering group set up to supervise Kosovo's independence \\"will not tolerate partition, because partition of this country is not foreseen and will not be accepted by us.\\" Kosovo's Prime Minister Hashim Thaci said in a joint press conference with Feith that the \\"functioning of parallel institutions will not be tolerated.\\" * Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Fried said Kosovo's response to the \\"provocations in the north\\" vindicates the US's decision to recognize Kosovo's independence declaration. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice urged Serbian leaders to press the minority Serb community in Kosovo to avoid \\"provocative action\\" following the clashes in Mitrovica March 17. * officials urged for UNMIK to secure the borders of Kosovo leading up to the arrival of the EU's mission in Kosovo with Dutch Foreign Minister Maxime Verhagen saying they wanted to avoid a \\"soft partition\\" of Kosovo. *'s President Boris Tadic accused the international forces in Kosovo of using \\"excessive force\\" and warned of \\"an escalation of unrest on all the territory of the province\\" following clashes in Mitrovica over UN court seizures. Serbia's caretaker Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said his government was consulting with Russia on joint steps to stop \\"all forms of violence against Kosovo Serbs\\" and accused NATO of \\"implementing a policy of force against Serbia\\". It was reported steps could include the deployment of Russian troops in the north. Minister for Kosovo Slobodan Samardzic told protesters, \\"We will protect you just like we protect the Serbs in Serbia.\\" * called for a resumption of talks on the status of Kosovo, saying the unrest was a result of the territory's unilateral independence declaration. * Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon condemned the attacks against UN and NATO-led forces following the clashes on March 17 and urged \\"all communities to exercise calm and restraint.\\" *'s Foreign Ministry issued a statement expressing concern over unrest and calling for Serbs in Kosovo to avoid violence. *n Foreign Minister Ursula Plassnik called on Serbia and Kosovo Serb leaders to promote calm in the region adding, \\"The Serbian government has repeatedly vowed to refrain from violence as a political tool.

Early years A California native, Miller is one of two children of an architect and film studio set designer, Howard Miller and accountant mother and travel agent, Elsie. She began acting as a young girl. Career The film Casanova Brown (1944) marked her screen debut at the age of 19 days. 1965 was a break-through year for Miller. She was featured with an elephant and a chimp on the hit TV series Flipper. This caught the attention of the director (Ivan Tors) who later cast her in the film, Clarence, the Cross-Eyed Lion with (Marshall Thompson).Susan Bailey, \\"Cheryl Miller biographical information\\" Daktari Fan Site, March 27 2013 In this film she played Paula Tracy, the daughter of veterinarian Marsh Tracy (Marshall Thompson). The film led to her role again playing Paula Tracy alongside Thompson in the CBS television series, Daktari, (1966‚Äì69). During the summer of 1965, Walt Disney chose Miller as his own contractee, dubbing her \\"The Typical American Girl\\". By early 1966, filming began for Daktari in Africa, U.S.A., a 200-acre ranch about 40 miles north of the Los Angeles metro area. Later that year, Miller was one of 13 young actresses who were designated Hollywood Deb Stars of 1966. By the summer, she became Miss Golden Globe of 1966 and assisted Andy Williams in the presentation of the Golden Globe Awards. In 1966, she was voted as honorary mayor of Studio City, California. \\"Cheryl Lynn Miller\\", Glamour Girls of The Silver Screen] Miller made many appearances in other television series, including Flipper, Leave It to Beaver, Our Man Higgins, and The Donna Reed Show.

They then bought a house in 1993 at 114 Chatsworth Road, Willesden Green, London. The property was registered in both their names, but they had not said what their respective shares were on the Land Registry Form. Usually this meant a presumption that they would share equally in the home. However, the purchase was funded by selling a house that was in Ms Dowden‚Äôs sole name, her savings and a joint loan, so she had given 65% of the purchase price. Mr Stack had kept his finances separate, but was living in the previous house since 1983 and had done many improvements. They always, or mostly, had had separate bank accounts, savings and investments. Nine years after purchasing the house, their relationship broke down and they agreed a court order that excluded Mr Stack from the house and required Ms Dowden to pay Mr Stack for the cost of his alternative accommodation. Mr Stack then sought a declaration that the house was held upon trust by the couple as tenants in common and an order for its sale. The High Court declared that they owned the property in equal shares. Ms Dowden appealed. Judgment =Court of Appeal= The Court of Appeal overturned the High Court and ordered that the net proceeds be divided 65 per cent to her and 35 per cent to Mr Stack.[2005] EWCA Civ 857, (2006) 1 FLR 254 The declaration as to the receipt for capital money in the transfer document could not be taken as an express declaration of trust, nor could it infer an intention that the beneficial ownership be equal, because there was no evidence that either of them had understood the declaration to carry such significance. The issues were whether a conveyance into joint names established a prima facie case of joint and equal beneficial interests and whether the Court of Appeal had been correct to overrule the judge's order that Ms Dowden compensate Mr Stack for the cost of his accommodation. Mr Stack appealed. =House of Lords= The House of Lords held that Ms Dowden owned a greater share than half the equity, and so although she and Mr Stack were joint tenants of the legal estate, Ms Dowden was entitled to a 65 per cent interest. Lord Hoffmann said he concurred with Baroness Hale. Lord Hope, gave a short judgment also concurring with Baroness Hale. He emphasised that, departing from Lloyds Bank plc v Rosset, when deciding whether a constructive trust existed, Therefore, because the couple had maintained their financial independence from each other throughout their relationship, Lord Hope reasoned that the appeal should be dismissed. Lord Walker, agreeing with the reasons given by Baroness Hale and having examined the precedent in detail, was also of the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed. Baroness Hale identified that the onus is upon the person seeking to show that the beneficial ownership is different from the legal ownership[2007] 2 AC 432, [56] and that the key question in cases such as this is ‚Äúdid the parties intend their beneficial interests to be different from their legal interests?‚Äù,[2007] 2 AC 432, [66] although she acknowledged that cases of this type would be very unusual.[2007] 2 AC 432, [69] Baroness Hale stated that, contrary to Lloyd's Bank plc v Rosset, many factors other than financial contributions may be relevant to divining the parties' true intentions, such as any discussions at the time of the transfer which cast light upon their intentions; the reasons why the home was acquired in their joint names; the nature of their relationship; whether they had children for whom they both had responsibility to provide a home; how the purchase was financed, both the initial purchase price and the subsequent mortgage payments; how the parties arranged their finances, whether separately or together or a bit of both; how they discharged their household expenses. Baroness Hale stated that these and other factors should be taken into account when deciding whether the parties' beneficial interests should be different from their legal interests and whether a constructive trust existed.[2007] 2 AC 432, [69] Because the parties had kept their finances rigidly separate, Baroness Hale was of the opinion that, taking their entire course of conduct into account, the appeal by Mr Stack should be dismissed and the Court of Appeal's order of a 65/35 split in favour of Ms Dowden should stand. Lady Baroness Hale further states that the court can look at other elements such as, the purpose for the home which it was acquired for, whether they have children for whom they both have a reasonability to provide a home for and how they managed any outgoings on the property and other household expensed. Lord Neuberger, dissenting in his reasoning (but not on the result of the 65 to 35 per cent split), advised against easy and frequent changes to law (especially by the judiciary rather than Parliament) that might give rise to new and unforeseen uncertainties and unfairnesses.[2007] 2 AC 432, [102] He advocated the use of the resulting trust where evidence of factors other than direct financial contributions were absent[2007] 2 AC 432, [122] see also Lascar v Lascar and expressed concern about imputing intentions to the parties rather than inferring their intentions in light of their actions and statements - the former involves concluding what the parties would have intended whereas the latter involves concluding what they did intend.[2007] 2 AC 432, [126] Lord Neuberger held that there were no grounds for varying the 65/35 split which he believed originated on the acquisition of the property and the establishment of a resulting trust. He was of the opinion that nothing other than \\"subsequent discussions, statements or actions, which can fairly be said to imply a positive intention to depart from that apportionment, will do to justify a change in the way in which the beneficial interest is owned.\\"[2007] 2 AC 432, [146] He thought that the facts that they lived together for a long time, have been in a loving relationship, have children, operated a joint bank account and shared the outgoings of the household could not of themselves indicate an intention to vary this unequal split, and that even payments on decoration, repairs, utilities and council tax did not suffice on their own without evidence of an express agreement to vary their shares.[2007] 2 AC 432, [141]-[143] He agreed that the appeal should be dismissed, though for different reasons than the majority.

Three Occidental Petroleum active oil wells (using nodding donkeys); south of Buttonwillow, California The Elk Hills Oil Field (formerly the Naval Petroleum Reserve No. 1) is a large oil field in western Kern County, in the Elk Hills of the San Joaquin Valley, California in the United States, about west of Bakersfield. Discovered in 1911, and having a cumulative production of close to of oil at the end of 2006, it is the fifth-largest oil field in California, and the seventh-most productive field in the United States. Its estimated remaining reserves, as of the end of 2006, were around , and it had 2,387 active oil-producing wells. It is by an order of magnitude the largest natural gas-producing oil field in California, having produced over of gas since its discovery, and retaining over in reserve, making it even larger than the Rio Vista Gas Field, the largest non-associated natural gas field in the state.California Department of Conservation, Oil and Gas Statistics, Annual Report, December 31, 2006, p. 2 The principal operator of the field is California Resources Corporation, a November 2014 spinoff from Occidental Petroleum. Setting The oil field underlies the Elk Hills, a range of low hills trending west to east with a high elevation of . To the north, east, and southeast are the agricultural fields of the San Joaquin Valley, and to the southwest is the Buena Vista Valley. Across that valley is the town of Taft, and the enormous Midway-Sunset Oil Field, the largest in California. West of the Elk Hills is the large McKittrick Oil Field, and northwest is the even larger Cymric Oil Field. Although the Elk Hills is only one field of many in a region of oil fields, it is geographically distinct because its boundaries correspond with the shape of the hills that give it its name. Skyline Road, which is closed to public entry, follows the long axis of the field. It begins near McKittrick and goes east, following the crest of the hills. Perpendicular to this road, and about halfway down its length, is Elk Hills Road, which connects the town of Taft to the south with Buttonwillow to the north. Two guarded gates to the California Resources Corporation operations, 3 and 4, make up the intersection with Skyline Road on the summit of the range. Overall, the oil field is approximately long roughly following the crestline of the hills, and approximately across at the widest point. It encompasses considered productive, or about .DOGGR, California Oil and Gas Fields, pp. 168-173 Geology Elk Hills Oil Field Structure Map The Elk Hills Oil Field has a complex stratigraphy compared to other nearby fields, many of which are single large pools in simple structural traps. Thirteen separate oil pools have been identified so far in the Elk Hills Field, in rock units ranging in age from Oligocene to Pleistocene. The shallowest formation, the Tulare, was the first in which oil was found, at below ground surface, and the deepest, the Oligocene portion of the Temblor containing the Agua Pool at a depth of , was not found until 1977. Production and political history Associated Oil Company discovered the field in June 1911, with the drilling of their \\"Well No. 1,\\" to a depth of . The official \\"discovery\\" well, however, was drilled by the Standard Oil Company (\\"Hay No. 1\\") in January, 1919. By 1912 the field's capacity was considered to be significant enough that President William Howard Taft, concerned about the long-term availability of petroleum for the U.S. Navy, designated the region as the nation's first Naval Petroleum Reserve. The dusty Elk Hills have a prominent role in U.S. political history, for it was the lease of this land by Secretary of the Interior Albert B. Fall, to Pan American Petroleum in 1922 in return for personal loans at no interest, that brought on the Teapot Dome scandal which ruined the reputation of the administration of Warren G. Harding, now commonly considered to be one of the most corrupt in U.S. history. In 1927 the U.S. Supreme Court invalidated the lease, and returned the Elk Hills to the U.S. government. The oil field went largely untapped, held as a reserve, until the mid-1970s, when Congress passed the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act in response to the 1973-1974 Arab Oil Embargo. In 1976 the Ford Administration opened the lands for drilling and production again.Naval Petroleum and Oil Shale Reserves: Ninety Years Ensuring the National Security. NPR-1, operated by Williams Brothers Engineering Company, reached peak production in 1981, pumping of oil out of the Stevens Pool in that year alone. A drive to privatize some government lands during the mid-1990s succeeded in 1997 with the sale of the reserve to Occidental Petroleum, the highest bidder. Occidental took over operations in early 1998 and has been the principal operator since then; in 2008 they had a 78% interest in the oil field. Current reserves are claimed to be either of oil (according to the California Department of Conservation) or of oil equivalent, according to Occidental Petroleum. =2009 discovery= Occidental Petroleum announced in 2009 that it had made a major discovery of oil and natural gas in Kern County, calling it the largest onshore California oil and gas discovery in 35 years. Although Occidental declined to divulge the location, state records show that Occidental has been drilling wells to depths of at the northwest end of Elk Hills Field, between Elk Hills and Railroad Gap Field. Occidental estimated the new find to contain 150 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), of which about one-third is oil.David Brown, \\"Elk Hills 'secrets' being revealed,\\" AAPG Explorer, November 2009, p.20-26. =2018 acquisition= California Resources Corporation (CRC), a spinoff from Occidental Petroleum, acquired Elk Hills Oil Field as its largest acquisition in April 2018, and also acquired the remaining surface and mineral rights to the field from Chevron. Ecology The oil neststraw (Stylocline citroleum), a rare flowering plant endemic to the Elk Hills area, was given its name because it is limited to oil field country.

The term locality is used in rural areas, while the term suburb is used in urban areas. Australian postcodes closely align with the boundaries of localities and suburbs. This Australian usage of the term \\"suburb\\" differs from common American and British usage, where it typically means a smaller, frequently separate residential community outside, but close to, a larger city. The Australian usage is closer to the American or British use of \\"district\\" or \\"neighbourhood\\", and can be used to refer to any portion of a city. Unlike the use in British or American English, this term can include inner-city, outer-metropolitan and industrial areas. Localities existed in the past as informal units, but in 1996 the Intergovernmental Committee on Surveying and Mapping and the Committee for Geographical Names in Australasia (CGNA) decided to name and establish official boundaries for all localities and suburbs. There has subsequently been a process to formally define their boundaries and to gazette them, which is almost complete. In March 2006, only South Australia and the Northern Territory had not completed this process. The CGNA's Gazetteer of Australia recognises two types of locality: bounded and unbounded. Bounded localities include towns, villages, populated places, local government towns and unpopulated town sites, while unbounded localities include place names, road corners and bends, corners, meteorological stations, ocean place names and surfing spots. Sometimes, both localities and suburbs are referred to collectively as \\"address localities\\". In the first instance, decisions about the names and boundaries of suburbs and localities are made by the local council in which they are located based on criteria such as community recognition. Local council decisions are, however, subject to approval by the state's geographical names board. The boundaries of some suburbs and localities overlap two or more local government areas (LGAs). Examples of this are , which is split between the City of Newcastle and City of Lake Macquarie LGAs and , which is split between the City of Maitland and Port Stephens Council LGAs. In unincorporated areas, localities are declared by the relevant state authority.

As of October 2013, she is the world's 2nd female Zen teacher of African descent. Her given Buddhist name, Kyodo, means \\"Way of Teaching.\\" Biography =Early life= Williams was raised by her father, a firefighter, in Queens and Brooklyn and then by her mother in Tribeca, Manhattan after her parents separated. She attended junior high school in Chinatown, New York, high school in Chelsea and attended Nazareth College in Rochester, NY. =Spiritual History= After reading D. T. Suzuki's Zen and Japanese Culture, Shunryu Suzuki's, Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind, and receiving her first formal meditation instruction at San Francisco Zen Center while visiting California, Williams sought a community and teacher. Originally a formal student of Roshi Pat Enkyo O'Hara at the Village Zendo in New York City, she was ordained as a priest by Francisco \\"Paco\\" Lugovi√±a, from whom she also received denkai and hoshi empowerments, authorizing her to transmit the precepts to others and making her a dharma holder in the Zen tradition, respectively. As of October 2013, she is the world's second black female Zen teacher.http://shambhalasun.com/news/?p=51144 =Career= In 1996, she and Rebecca Walker, daughter of novelist Alice Walker, opened Kokobar, the first cybercafe owned and operated by African- American women, in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, with financial backing from, among others, rockstar Tracy Chapman, filmmaker Spike Lee and Rita Owens (mother of Dana Owens, aka Queen Latifah.) Walker withdrew from the affairs of the business and left it to Williams shortly after it opened. Sheriffs began to remove the physical property of the cafe, allegedly because of Chapman's unpaid loan. This caused the cafe to close in 1997. In 2000, Williams wrote Being Black, a nonfiction work published by Putnam/Penguin, to introduce more Black people and people of color to Buddhist principles. She sought to use Buddhism's \\"profoundly anti-elitist, anti-authoritarian, and antisectarian essence to revitalize\\" black identity politics and practice in America. In 2003, Waxploitation Records founder Jeff Antebi approached Williams' publisher to create a musical companion to Being Black. The CD, published by Spun Records, features work by well-known hiphop artists, MCs and producers, including Blackalicious, will.i.am of The Black Eyed Peas, DJ Jazzy Jeff, Jurassic 5 and King Britt, among others. The CD includes both original and existing music \\"inspired by\\" the book. Poet Ursula Rucker performs vocal interludes that are quotes of Williams taken directly from the book. A Japan- distributed import version was released shortly after the American release. In 2003, she also received a Spiritual Activism Fellowship, along with seven others considered at the forefront of that field. Later that year, she moved from New York City to Oakland, CA, and in January 2004, founded the New Dharma Meditation Center, serving as teacher and spiritual director. The center was established specifically to serve the spiritual needs of people of color while developing an approach to training that viewed individual, community and social transformation as a spiritual practice. Williams consistently challenged the established Buddhist communities in America, which are largely white, to make people of color welcome in practice settings, which she regarded as a failure of that population. Beginning in a small sublet, it transitioned to a three-story Victorian home on the border of Emeryville. Having grown into a residential practice center with a focus on social transformation, the New Dharma Meditation Center moved in 2007 to its current home in Berkeley, California. There, it was renamed the Center for Urban Peace and in 2009 became the Center for Transformative Change (CXC). Williams has been featured on the Oxygen Channel and CNNfn, and has appeared in The New York Times, Boston Globe, Village Voice, Wired, Essence, and other publications. She now focuses her attention on the emerging field of \\"transformative social change\\", an approach to social justice outcomes Williams deems a new social movement and is credited with coining the phrase for with respect to this area and field of work by way of several essays.

Biddle is better known though for having been killed in a duel with Missouri Congressman Spencer Pettis. Early life Thomas Biddle was born into the powerful Biddle family in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, one of ten children born to Charles and Hannah (Shephard) Biddle. His father Charles was a Revolutionary War officer and vice-president of the Supreme Executive Council of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Two of Thomas' brothers, James and Edward, had served in the U.S. Navy, while brother John was a U.S. Army officer before becoming an early mayor of Detroit, Michigan. Older brother Nicholas Biddle was president of the Second Bank of the United States.Christensen, Lawrence O., Dictionary of Missouri Biography, University of Missouri Press, 1999, pg.66 War of 1812 and post-war During the War of 1812, Thomas Biddle was commissioned, as a captain of artillery, under Zebulon Pike. He saw action, at Fort George and Stoney Creek and was wounded, at Fort Erie. Biddle was wounded again at the Battle of Lundy's Lane, where he distinguished himself by capturing the only British cannon seized in the clash. It would later be preserved and displayed in Washington, D.C. In 1814 Biddle was brevetted to the rank of Major and became an aide for George Izard. In 1819, he accompanied the Yellowstone Expedition up the Missouri River to the vicinity of present-day Omaha, Nebraska.History of Boone County, Missouri (1882). St. Louis: Western Historical Company. Retrieved 2016-01-05. pp. 141‚Äì42.Carlson, Gayle F., John R. Bozell, and Robert Pepperl (2004). The Search for Engineer Cantonment. Nebraska State Historical Society. Retrieved 2015-12-04. p. 6 of PDF. In August, 1820 he was transferred to St. Louis, Missouri where he served as U.S. Army paymaster. On September 1, 1823 Thomas Biddle married Ann Mullanphy, daughter of Missouri's first millionaire, John Mullanphy. Now serving as the director of the St. Louis branch of the Bank of the United States, the Biddles were financially well-off and at the peak of young St. Louis society, often hosting lavish dinner parties for business and political luminaries. It was their involvement in local politics that would have deadly consequences, however. Politics What transpired on August 26, 1831 had its roots many months earlier. Missouri's Jacksonian Democrats, led by Senator Thomas Hart Benton, engaged in a number of debates, during the 1830 Congressional election season, that saw many fiery speeches, on issues of banking, currency stability, and western land use. During one of those speeches, Congressman Spencer Darwin Pettis, a Benton acolyte, harshly criticized Biddle's brother Nicholas, President of the Second Bank of the United States. A war of words soon ensued, in the St. Louis press, in the form of letters to the editor. In one such letter, Thomas Biddle called Pettis, \\"a dish of skimmed milk\\", to which Pettis responded by questioning Thomas Biddle's manhood. Pettis was reelected to U.S. Congress, in November, 1830, but the feud between the two refused to die. Things escalated dramatically on July 9, 1831, when Biddle heard that an ill Pettis was resting in a St. Louis hotel. Biddle attacked Pettis in his room, beating him severely with a cowhide whip until other hotel guests intervened. Fearing that he might be attacked again during his recovery, Congressman Pettis had Major Biddle arrested on a peace warrant. At the court proceedings, Pettis attempted to draw a pistol with the intention of shooting Biddle, but was restrained by friends. At this, Biddle stated that he would promptly accept any challenge that the Congressman cared to issue. After sufficient time to recover from the beating, on August 21, 1831, Congressman Pettis challenged Biddle to a duel, which indeed was promptly accepted. As the challenged party, Biddle was allowed to choose the weapons and distance. Being nearsighted, Major Biddle chose pistols at the unusually close distance of five feet. This meant that each man would take at most one or two steps before turning to fire, with their pistols perhaps even overlapping, depending on arm length. In short, it was suicidal and seen as a ploy by some observers and later historians to make Pettis back down and thus lose the affair of honor without bloodshed.Christensen, Lawrence O., Dictionary of Missouri Biography, University of Missouri Press, 1999, pg.68 Affair of honor and death At five p.m. on August 27, 1831, Thomas Biddle and Spencer Pettis, along with their seconds, Major Benjamin O'Fallon and Captain Martin Thomas respectively, met on Bloody Island, a small sandbar located in the Mississippi River between St. Louis and the Illinois shore. Dueling was illegal in both states, but authorities tended to turn a blind eye to this neutral ground. As large crowds watched from the St. Louis riverfront, Biddle and Pettis obeyed the commands to step, turn, and fire. When the smoke cleared, both men had fallen with mortal wounds. Before being carried off the island, both men were overheard to forgive each other for the altercation. Congressman Spencer Pettis died the next day, while Major Biddle lingered on until August 29. Both men were buried with full honors, eulogized for choosing death before dishonor. The funerals for both men were said to be the largest ever held in St. Louis in the 19th century. As a war hero, Thomas Biddle was first buried with full military rites at Jefferson Barracks in St. Louis, until some years later when he was disinterred to be buried with his wife in a crypt at Calvary Cemetery in St. Louis.

He previously served as State Councilor and Secretary-General of the State Council, and the President of the Chinese Academy of Governance. Prior to his ascendance to leading roles at the State Council, he served as the Director of the State Ethnic Affairs Commission (2008-2013), and the Chairman of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (2003-2008). Yang was the highest- ranking non-Han official in the Chinese government.  Early career  Yang was born in Jungar Banner in what was Ih Ju League of Inner Mongolia near the modern city of Ordos, and is of ethnic Mongol ancestry. He worked as a teenager in a farming equipment factory. In September 1973 Yang was recommended to obtain higher education at the Inner Mongolia Industry College. He then returned to his hometown to serve in the local Communist Party organization. In 1982 Yang earned a degree in Chinese language from Inner Mongolia University. After graduating, Yang worked in the Communist Youth League as a local organizer in Ih Ju League, then chief administrator of Dalad Banner. He then went on to work in the Inner Mongolia regional bureau of statistics, then headed the Regional Bureau of Tourism. Between 1993 and 1996, Yang served as the Inner Mongolia regional chief of the Communist Youth League of China under the League's first secretary Li Keqiang, who later became Premier. In 1998 Yang became party chief of the regional capital, Hohhot, an office he occupied until 2003. Between 2003 and 2008 he served as the Chairman of Inner Mongolia and concurrently the region's Deputy party secretary, alongside Party Secretary Chu Bo. Yang shouldered major responsibility as Inner Mongolia Chairman when a turbine factory in Ulanqab League collapsed in July 2005, killing six workers. He left the office in 2008 to take up his new appointment in Beijing as the head of the State Ethnic Affairs Commission. Secretariat Yang Jing earned a seat on the party's Central Secretariat in November 2012, becoming the first ethnic-minority official to sit on the body in the party's history. Several months later at the 12th National People's Congress, Yang was appointed Secretary General of the State Council in Li Keqiang's cabinet.NPC endorses new cabinet lineup Yang's position was also unique in that State Council Secretaries-General did not usually hold concurrent seats on the party secretariat. He was also the first ethnic- minority official to hold the State Council Secretary-General post. Yang was a member of the 17th and 18th Central Committees, and an alternate member of the 16th Central Committee. He has been named as a member of the tuanpai, an informal designation given to politicians with background in the Communist Youth League. After 19th Party Congress In October 2017, at the 19th Party Congress, Yang Jing's name did not appear on the list of members of the 19th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. As Yang had not yet reached retirement age (he was 63), this led to speculation that Yang came under scrutiny in a party disciplinary probe and was either demoted or otherwise no longer serving in an official capacity. Some of his party posts at the State Council were taken over by Xiao Jie. = Investigation = On February 24, 2018, Yang Jing was placed on one-year probation within the Party by Ai Bang Mai Ni, removal from his administrative post, and demoted to Ministerial level (zhengbuji) for violations of regulations. The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection said Yang \\"have severely violated political discipline and rules and had long-term improper association with illegal business owners and social personnel\\".

UTAM was established by a state law in 14 of December 1972. A posterior law, of 10 of October 1977 turned the university in an institute, but it remained called as university. The creation of UTAM started with an educational policy, created by the Governor of the State of Amazonas, Colonel Jo√£o Walter de Andrade, that observed the insufficiency of technicians for industry. Since its foundation in 1973, UTAM has offered courses in Operational Engineering (Wood, Mechanic, Electronic and Electrotechnical), Mechanic Maintenance, Civil Construction, Topography and Highways. In 1977, the Ministry of Education abolished Operational Engineering so the administrators of UTAM started to offer courses of Technology at a Superior level. In 1986 UTAM started an Engineering course. The course in Data processing started in 1992 and Computer Engineering started in 1997. =Transformation to UEA= In 2001 the Mayor of Manaus signed a law that turned the University of Technology of Amazonas into the University of the State of Amazonas. It has campuses in 17 cities of Amazonas. In 2011 it was the best university of the north region of Brazil, according to a Ministry of Education exam, called ENADE. =New Iranduba Campus= With the opening of the Manaus-Iranduba Bridge, the Amazonas Government will build a university city in the city of Iranduba, located in the other margin of the Rio Negro River, inside the Manaus Metropolitan Area.

The Saturday Special feature began with a duration of an hour during the summer months. Slowly its scope expanded, and with football playing an ever bigger role in British life, it became possible to have long editions in winter months also. The programme would run for 2+ hours, sometimes as long as 3 hours 15 minutes, with only two 15-minute breaks for the news on the hour. The programmes closest to his heart drew attention to humanitarian movements and initiatives. In this capacity, and when covering the Olympic and Commonwealth Games he travelled widely and met and related to people in all capacities of life. One of his programmes led to a book he wrote, The Fight Against Leprosy. He presented other BBC programmes, including Write On..., a selection of reader's letters, and was a regular presenter of Top of the Form on BBC 1, as well as the radio version, and for the BBC Science contest Young Scientists of the Year.

The film is a co-production of the National Film Board of Canada and the BBC and was directed by Toronto-based journalist and filmmaker Giselle Portenier. It premiered on 8 March 2007 in Toronto and has been broadcast on multiple channels around the world, including DOC: The Documentary Channel in the United States.  General description  More than 2,200 women were murdered in Guatemala between 2001 and 2008, and countless more raped, tortured, and mutilated. This film displays this epidemic by examining the cases of several murders that occur during and just prior to filming. In particular, the filmmakers follow the family of Claudina Vel√°squez, a 19-year- old student who was murdered one night after a party with friends. When the case stalls, Claudina's father, accompanied by a camera crew, makes several appearances at the offices of homicide detectives. Initially, Claudina is dismissed as a prostitute, due to the sandals and navel ring she was found wearing. Claudina's father pressures investigators to actively pursue the case, but is repeatedly told that the case has been passed from one investigator to another. This case and others in the film, like that of an unidentified woman found naked in a dry riverbed, showcase the pervasiveness of the murder of women in Guatemala, and point to numerous reasons that these murders are almost never solved. Witnesses and the family members of victims interviewed in the film speak on camera reluctantly and only as a last resort, and explain that they fear retaliation from the murderers, who are often young gang members or disaffected soldiers, many jobless following the end of major military conflict in Guatemala. The film also displays the unwillingness of authorities to investigate the murders, owing to corruption and fear of retaliation from perpetrators. A pervasive societal machismo and misogyny are also revealed, as when police deem victims wearing makeup, fingernail polish, or supposedly revealing clothing to be prostitutes and decline to investigate their murders. While the film focuses primarily on young women who are abducted off the streets, it also mentions the large number of women who are beaten or murdered by husbands and boyfriends, cases which are rarely reported or prosecuted. Additionally, a law persists whereby a convicted rapist can be acquitted if his victim agrees to marry him, meaning that many victims of \\"solved\\" rape cases are coerced into abusive marriages for fear of their lives. In spite of the continued increase in the murder rate of women, the film is not entirely without hope. The filmmakers are granted an interview with then President √ìscar Berger, who dismisses their criticism as merely \\"pessimistic,\\" and says he is optimistic that new programs, including a national overhaul of the police force and foreign training for homicide investigators, will improve the situation. Director Portenier's criticism of governmental incompetence is met with frustration and disdain, and Berger leaves the interview abruptly, thanking Portenier and grimacing through his anger. One scene shows a large protest march in the capital, Guatemala City, where citizens cordon off the Ministry of Justice with yellow police tape, declaring it a \\"crime scene of inaction.\\" Another thread of the film follows the sister of one murder victim as she appeals to the United States Congress, eventually gaining an audience in a committee in order to bring international attention to the plight of women in Guatemala.

According to Mizouz he had gone to Pakistan to get married. He was arrested in Pakistan, by Pakistani authorities, on August 26, 2001, while walking with his brother-in-law in Karachi. He said he hadn't heard from his wife since his capture, and didn't know what had happened to her. Mizouz described cruel treatment in Pakistani custody. He described being transferred to American custody in the Kandahar detention facility. According to Mizouz, his transfer to American custody was in December 2001. Prior to his transfer he was visited by some Americans who said they were from Amnesty International, who he was sure were actually American counter-terrorism analysts. Mizouz expressed dissatisfaction with efforts of the International Committee of the Red Cross on their behalf, and expressing suspicion that the Red Cross was assisting the American effort: Mizouz described brutal beatings in Kandahar, being exposed to the freezing cold winter weather, prior to interrogations, and the use of electric shock, during his interrogations, and immersions in freezing cold water. Mizouz was then transferred to the Bagram Collection Point. Mizouz said that after his release, when he read about the Abu Ghraib torture and abuse that occurred in 2003 he recognized that all of these techniques were techniques used when he was being held in Bagram in 2002. He also described injections with psychotropic drugs. And Mizouz described Americans in Bagram urinating on the Koran. Mizouz said he was transferred to Guantanamo on June 15, 2006. Beatings by the guards, mystery injections continued. He also described all the captives suffering from painful hemorrhoids from the humiliating body cavity searches, forced enemas, and the introduction of drugs via the anus. With very few exceptions, American spokesmen decline to address claims of abuse from specific Guantanamo captives. But, they have offered general assurances that American captives receive humane care and treatment.

Since demand for gu≈çbƒÅ outstrips traditional production and modern ways of cooking rice (in electric rice cookers) do not produce it, gu≈çbƒÅ has been commercially manufactured since the late 20th century. In Hong Kong and Cantonese-speaking areas of China, scorched rice is known as faan ziu (È£ØÁÑ¶, lit. \\"rice scorch\\"). =Indonesia= Large intip sold in Cirebon In Indonesia, especially Central Java, scorched rice is called intip. It is a specialty of the Wonogiri Regency area and served as a cracker. The rice cracker is made from the hardened semi- burnt rice that sticks to the inner bottom of rice-cooking vessels. These cooking vessels are filled with water to loosen up the stuck rice. After it is separated from the cooking vessel, the stuck rice is sun-dried until it loses all of its liquid contents. The dried sticky rice is later deep-fried to create a crispy rice cracker. In Indonesia there is a similar rice cracker called rengginang. Unlike intip, however, it is not made from scorched rice salvaged from the bottom of a rice cooking vessel, but created separately from steamed sticky rice, boiled, seasoned, made into a flat and rounded shape, and sun-dried prior to deep-frying. =Iran= Cherry rice dish with tahdig or albaloo polow ba tahdiq maast. Rice, bread or potato crust or some vegetables from the bottom of the pot is called tahdig in Iran. Tahdig (, tah \\"bottom\\" + dƒ´g \\"pot\\") is a specialty of Iranian cuisine consisting of crisp, caramelized rice taken from the bottom of the pot in which the rice (chelow) is cooked. It is traditionally served to guests at a meal. Ingredients commonly added to tahdig include yogurt and saffron, bread, potato, tomato, and fruits such as sour cherry. Variations of tahdig include placing thin vegetable slices at the bottom of the pot, so they crisp up instead of the rice; these vegetables include potato, carrots, and lettuce. Iranians sometimes apply this cooking method to spaghetti as well, providing a hardened base. =Iraq= Iraqi rice cooking is a multi-step process intended to produce tender, fluffy grains of rice. A prominent aspect of Iraqi rice cooking is the hikakeh, a crisp bottom crust. The hikakeh contains some loose rice as well. Before serving, the hikakeh is broken into pieces so that everyone is provided with some along with the fluffy rice. =Japan= A traditional kamado in a Japanese museum Okoge () is eaten with vegetables or moistened with water, soup, or tea. is Japanese food, usually rice, that has been scorched or blackened. Until electric rice cookers came into common use in the 20th century, rice in Japan was cooked in a kamado, a traditional stove heated by wood or charcoal. Because regulating the heat of a wood or charcoal fire is more difficult, a layer of rice at the bottom of the pot would often be slightly burned during cooking; this layer, called okoge, was not discarded, but was eaten with vegetables or moistened with water, soup, or tea. Okoge is still eaten in Japanese cuisine, and is an important part of the kaiseki meal served at tea ceremonies, where it is typically served with hot water and pickles as the final course. It has a crispy texture and a nutty flavour. Because the cooking temperature of modern electric rice cookers is precisely controlled, okoge does not usually form naturally during the cooking process. However, there are rice cookers on the market in Japan that have an okoge setting. Okoge can also be made by scorching cooked rice in a frying pan. =Korea= boiled nurungji Commercially sold nurungji snack Nurungji () is eaten as a snack, infused in hot water to make sungnyung (scorched rice tea), or reboiled in water to make Nureun bap. Nurungji (hangul: ÎàÑÎ£ΩÏßÄ) or scorched rice is a traditional Korean food made of scorched rice. After boiling and serving rice, a thin crust of scorched rice will usually be left in the bottom of the cooking pot. This yellowed scorched state is described as nureun (ÎàåÏùÄ) in Korean;nurungji derives from this adjective. Nurungji can be eaten in its crisp state as a snack or as an after meal rice tea by adding hot water,Nurungji , Click Korea or reboiled with water to make nureun bap (ÎàåÏùÄÎ∞•) or nurungji bap (ÎàÑÎ£ΩÏßÄÎ∞•). Definition of nureunbap from the National Institute of the Korean Language Nurungji in its broad sense also refers to the crisp crust that forms at the bottom of the pots and pans when cooking various rice dishes such as dolsot bibimbap (ÎèåÏÜ• ÎπÑÎπîÎ∞•) and bokkeumbap. Nurungji is traditionally known for its medicinal attributes. According to records in the 17th century medical book Dongui Bogam, nurungji was called chwigunban (Ï∑®Í±¥Î∞ò, ÁÇä‰πæÈ£Ø) and considered as a remedy \\"when food does not swallow easily, upsets the stomach and induces vomiting\\".

Besides sweet fried nurungji snacks and instant nurungji to make nureunbap, many nurungji flavor products were also developed such as candies and tea. Nurungji at Doosan Encyclopedia Nurungi is also being used as an ingredient for a variety of new dishes like nurungji baeksuk and nurungji pizza. Mentions of nurungji in folklore are common, the most famous being a folk song recognizing the difficulties of memorizing the Thousand Character Classic. The lines are changed from the original chant to a clever rhyme that loosely translates into \\"sky cheon (Â§©), earth ji (Âú∞), nurungji in the gamasot (cauldron pot)\\".

In Colombian cuisine, scorched rice is called cucayo, pega or pego. It is often consumed with vegetable toppings as a cracker, or served in soups. It is also eaten alone or used to make leftovers. In Dominican cuisine, scorched rice is called conc√≥n, though this word can refer to the crunchy, toasted underside of other food types, as well. In Puerto Rican cuisine, scorched rice is called pegao. In Ecuador, kukayu (cucayo) is the name given to food items that are meant for travel, derived from kukayu (Quechua for a ration of coca). In Trinidad and Tobago cuisine and other English speaking Caribbean countries, scorched rice at the bottom of the pot is called bun bun.Teofilo Laime Ajacopa, Diccionario Biling√ºe Iskay simipi yuyayk'ancha, La Paz, 2007 (Quechua-Spanish dictionary)MOR√ìN, Carlos y GALV√ÅN, Cristina.

Laurel Jr., was a Filipino politician who was elected twice as Speaker of the House of Representatives of the Philippines. A stalwart of the Nacionalista Party, he was the party's candidate for Vice President of the Philippines in the 1957 elections. Early life He was born on August 27, 1912 in Tanauan, Batangas, the eldest son of Jos√© P. Laurel, who would serve as President of the Philippines from 1943 to 1945. His brother, Salvador, would become Vice-President of the Philippines in 1986, Sotero would be elected Senator in 1987. Another brother, Jose S. Laurel III served as Ambassador to Japan. His youngest brother, Arsenio was the first two-time winner of the Macau Grand Prix Laurel finished his intermediate and secondary education in Manila, and enrolled at the University of the Philippines. In 1936, he received his law degree from the U.P. College of Law and passed the bar exams the following year. He was a member of the Upsilon Sigma Phi fraternity. Political career In 1941, Laurel won his first election, as a Member of the House of Representatives from Batangas. However, his term was interrupted by the Japanese invasion in late 1941.Paras & La Vina, p. 106 For the duration of the war, Laurel assisted his father, who was designated as President of the Philippines under the 2nd Philippine Republic. When the Philippine Congress was restored upon independence in 1946, Laurel again sought election to the House of Representatives representing the Third District of Batangas. He was successful in his bid, and would be re-elected to the Second and Third Congresses. In 1954, he was elected to his first term as Speaker of the House. He gave up his Speakership, as well as his seat in the House in 1957 when he was drafted instead to run as vice-president under the Nacionalista ticket spearheaded by Carlos P. Garcia. He was defeated by Diosdado Macapagal of the Liberal Party even as Garcia went on to victory. In 1961, Laurel regained his seat in the House of Representatives, and would serve in that capacity until martial law was declared in 1972. He was again elected Speaker in February 1967 and remained in that position until 1971, when Cornelio Villareal of the Liberal Party regained the Speakership.Paras & La Vina, p. 107 Laurel retired from politics after Congress was closed in 1972. He reemerged in the public eye as a member of the 1986 Constitutional Commission that drafted the present Philippine Constitution. During his congressional career, Laurel focused on economic issues. He was an advocate of a planned economy and protectionism. Laurel was among those who, in 1965, recruited Senate President Ferdinand Marcos to join the Nacionalista Party as its presidential candidate against Diosdado Macapagal. Death and family Laurel died of pneumonia at the age of 85 on March 11, 1998. Two of his children, Jose Macario IV and Lally also became Members of the House of Representatives, representing the same seat their father had held.Paras & La Vina, p. 108 The actor Noel Trinidad was his son-in-law.

They claim descent from Qureshi Arabs, who are said to have arrived in India in the early Middle Ages. The Chik are a sub-group within the larger Qassab community of South Asia. They specialize in the slaughtering of goats, while the Qassab are involved in the slaughtering of buffaloes. In Uttar Pradesh, the Chik are often referred to as Bakar Qassab or Buz Kassab. The word bakar comes from the Urdu word bakra, which means a goat, and bakar qassab literally means a mutton butcher, Their residences are adjacent to them including their business like Meat and leather. The Uttar Pradesh Chik are endogamous, while in Bihar, the Chik inter marry with the Qassab.  Present circumstances  The Uttar Pradesh Chik are mainly involved in the business and trade of meat and hides. While the urban Bakar Qasab purchase goats and sheep from the Gadariya community, those in the rural areas rear their own sheep and goats. A significant number of Chik are also involved in tanning of hides, with a small number now owning tanneries. A section of the Chik in Uttar Pradesh have now entered the transportation business, running trucks throughout the state. Each settlement of the Chik contains an informal caste council, known as a panchayat. The panchayat is headed by a chaudhary. His duties include keeping a record of community members in the settlement. Traditionally, the panchayat deals with all intra community disputes, as well as traditionally punishing those who transgress community norms. The Chik are now also involved with the Anjuman Quraish, which is an India wide caste association of both the Chik and Qassab. The Chik of Uttar Pradesh are strictly endogamous, and have a marked preference of marrying close kin. They speak Urdu, as well as local dialects such as Khari boli and Awadhi. The Chik are Sunni Muslims and are one of the more orthodox communities, incorporating fewer folk practices. In terms of distribution, the Chik are found mainly in Rohilkhand and Awadh, with particular concentrations in the districts of Bareilly, Bijnor, Badaun, and Shahjahanpur in Rohilkhand, and Lucknow, Kheri, Unnao and Hardoi in Awadh. The Chik of Bihar speak the Sadri dialect of Hindi. They are found throughout Bihar, and are one of the most widespread Muslim groups in that state. Their occupation remains the selling of meat, and this occupation is almost exclusive to this community. But many have now taken to other occupations, such as petty trade. The Anjuman Chik is one of the oldest caste association in Bihar, and have actively lobbied for the Chik.

This boundary is observed in various continental regions at a depth of 15 to 20 km, however it is not found in oceanic regions. The Conrad discontinuity (named after the seismologist Victor Conrad) is considered to be the border between the upper continental crust and the lower one. It is not as pronounced as the Mohoroviƒçiƒá discontinuity, and absent in some continental regions. Up to the middle 20th Century the upper crust in continental regions was seen to consist of felsic rocks such as granite (sial, for silica- aluminium), and the lower one to consist of more magnesium-rich mafic rocks like basalt (sima, for silica-magnesium). Therefore, the seismologists of that time considered that the Conrad discontinuity should correspond to a sharply defined contact between the chemically distinct two layers, sial and sima. However, from the 1960s onward this theory was strongly contested among geologists. The exact geological significance of the Conrad discontinuity is still not clarified.

After three years at King's College London, he matriculated at Oxford, when about nineteen, and entered Balliol College. Soon after, he won a scholarship at University College, Oxford, and took a degree in 1840. He received Anglican ordination, became vicar of Withyam, and in 1846 of St Margaret's Church, Leicester. In 1850 he was received into the Catholic Church in Paris by Father Gustave Delacroix de Ravignan. Ordained at Oscott by Bishop Ullathorne in 1853, he was appointed a lecturer at Ushaw College and afterwards a preacher and confessor at Newman University Church in Dublin. During his stay in Ireland the Franciscan convent of Drumshambo was founded, mainly through his efforts. In 1856, he was called to London by his uncle, Cardinal Henry Edward Manning, whose secretary he remained until he joined the Jesuits in 1872. From 1875 to 1889 he lived in Manchester, working as preacher, spiritual guide, and writer. Father Anderdon began his literary apostolate by writing Catholic tales: \\"Bonneval, the Story of the Fronde\\" (1857); \\"Owen Evans, the Catholic Crusoe\\" (1862); \\"Afternoons with the Saints\\" (1863), \\"In the Snow, Tales of Mt. St. Bernard\\" (1866). All these stories, save the first, went through nine or ten editions, and were translated into German and French. Other valuable works from his pen are \\"Fasti Apostolici\\" (1882), \\"Evening with the Saints\\" (1883) and \\"Britain's Early Faith\\" (1887). His method in his writings was to understand rather than to exaggerate. Among his works, the best known are \\"Is Ritualism Honest?\\", \\"Controversial Papers\\" (1878), \\"Luther's Words and the Word of God\\" (8th thousand, 1883), \\"Luther at Table\\", \\"What sort of man was Luther?\\" (13th thousand, 1883). What do Catholics Really Believe?\\", \\"Confession to a Priest\\" (1881). His newspaper work displayed a fine sense of irony in treating the polemics of the day. He was ever busy writing for the Weekly Register, the (English) Messenger of the Sacred Heart, the Xaverian, Merry England, the Month, the Irish Monthly, and other serial publications. His last works were The Old Religion of Taunton (1890); and Five Minutes' Sermons, the latter completed only in part at his death.

The player assumes the role of Ayumi who wields two pistol- blades. The game was developed by Gaijin Entertainment and was published by SouthPeak Games and TopWare Interactive. It was later released for macOS and Linux on January 20, 2017. The game was originally released in November 2007 by 1C Company in the Russian language for Microsoft Windows, under the title Oniblade (–û–Ω–∏–±–ª—ç–π–¥). A reboot/sequel, Blades of Time, was released in March 2012. Gameplay With a pistol-blade in each hand, Ayumi prepares to fight a mob of enemies X-Blades is a hack-and-slash style action-adventure game in which the player must fight monsters, using a pair of gun blades and spells, through indoor and outdoor levels in order to progress. Monsters are encountered in both preset numbers and in areas with Monster Generators which spawn both standard and boss opponents until they are destroyed. Power-ups and coin fragments which grant different upgrades are hidden throughout the game. Power-ups include combat techniques, magic, weapon enhancements, and teleportation. Also earned throughout the game are souls, that function as experience points which can be converted into skills. The skills range from Area of Effect attacks to weapon enchantments. These skills are of either \\"light\\" or \\"dark\\" alignment and the use of them has an effect on whether the player receives the \\"light\\" or \\"dark\\" ending. Synopsis =Setting= Long, long ago, in an age that only the gods can now remember, the universe was ruled by two powerful beings that were revered and worshipped by all races ‚Äì but the brotherly relationship between these two creatures was always in question from the beginning of time, simply because no one knew who the real number 1 was. While the Enlightened was on the side of good, helping his people how and when he could, the Dark One was quite the opposite, full of hate and devilish works ‚Äì and so the never-ending battle between the Enlightened and the Dark One persisted for centuries. Humans suffered terribly thanks to this constant combat between the two ‚Äì combat which shook the universe to its very core. Finally, thanks to a trick, the Enlightened succeeded in banishing the divine power of the Dark One, imprisoning it in an Artifact ‚Äì but in doing so, the Enlightened lost his own divine powers, because the two divine beings were inseparably linked to one another. This is how two Artifacts came to be hidden in a huge Temple ‚Äì and how the Enlightened prevented the downfall of the entire universe. However, these two artifacts contain total, absolute power ‚Äì both good and evil. Any human being who comes in contact with the powerful stones will be horribly cursed ‚Äì and the power of darkness will once again be awakened. The game begins when a map which has been lost for countless years suddenly turns up ‚Äì and it shows the location of the artifacts. The adventurer Ayumi starts searching for the immensely valuable stones. Powerful forces against which she is helpless threaten to awake in her body. Now it's up to her to discover what the secret of the curse is ‚Äì and at last defeat the darkness. =Plot= Ayumi uses the map to find her way to some ruins. In the heart of the ruins lies an artifact guarded by the Light, a lion-like being, who warns her that the power of the artifact is life-threatening to humans. Ayumi ignores the warning and touches the artifact anyway. A black ooze infects Ayumi with a curse, causing the Light to try to kill her. She fights the Light but is defeated when she is overwhelmed by the agony of the curse. She finds herself in a white void but is overwhelmed by the black ooze. Ayumi awakes on an abandoned coastline. She eventually makes her way to a gazebo in the nearby ruins and finds herself trapped in it as it is filled with spikes. She is rescued by Jay, an adept of the Light, who is searching for an artifact of the Light. Ayumi speculates that this might be able to cure her curse, and Jay offers to try to cure it himself. Instead, he provokes a violent reaction by the curse and flees. Ayumi makes her way to the Artifact and finds that it is guarded by the Dark, who is battling Jay. The Dark wounds Jay and then turns to attack Ayumi, hoping to regain his lost power. She defeats him and touches the Artifact. She finds herself once again in the white void, but this time is accompanied by the Light, who wakes her up. She wakes up, discovering that the curse is gone. However, Jay is furious, saying that the curse had not been destroyed, merely, displaced. He then runs off. Ayumi eventually makes her way to the gates of a castle, where she again faces the Dark. The gates to the castle are broken down by Jay, who is now possessed by the dark magic of the curse. He destroys the Dark and takes its power. Ayumi and this Dark Jay fight, with Dark Jay retreating into the castle. Ayumi follows, facing him in the main hall of the castle. The game's ending is dependent on the upgrades the player chooses during the course of the experience. If the player buys any of the Dark spells, then the \\"Bad\\" Ending is shown. If none of the Dark spells were unlocked, then the \\"Good\\" Ending is shown. In the \\"Bad\\" Ending, Ayumi kills Jay. She mourns his death, wishing that she could have done differently. In the \\"Good\\" Ending, Ayumi knocks back Jay and is overwhelmed by the power of the Light. This power overwhelms Jay as well. The two ascend in spheres into the sky. A flash of light then explodes outword, purging the power of the Dark from the world. Ayumi and Jay are then seen watching the sunrise together.

The result is a killer title that gamers and animation fans won't be able to put down.\\" Reception Electronic Gaming Monthly called its \\"lead character, Ayumi...a typical sassy, scantily clad, smart- talking bad girl, who proves once and for all that a bikini-thong combination is suitable armor for taking on hordes of...just about anything.\\" GameDaily featured Ayumi as one of their \\"Almost Famous Hotties\\" pleased with her artistic depiction yet dissatisfied with both the game and her personality. X-Blades received \\"mixed\\" reviews on all platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. IGN reviewer Nate Ahearn was displeased with the repetitive hack-and-slash gameplay, mediocre special effects, annoying controls, and weak AI. G4's X-Play said of the PC version, \\"We can only recommend this to people who are interested in quitting videogames completely.\\" It also received one of X-Plays \\"Golden Mullet Awards\\" as one of the worst games of the year, that same year, in the category of game that \\"sounds like X-play when you say it fast\\". They noted that the main character's only power is that she does not wear pants, it was somewhat of a Tomb Raider knock off, as well as taking certain gameplay elements like switching from sword and gun attacks during battle from Devil May Cry. According to them the whole game seemed like something one would expect to get from an amateur teenager game creator. They also noted that the game uses the overused \\"I'm the best there is\\" line. In Japan, where the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions were ported and published by Ubisoft on April 30, 2009, and the PC version by E Frontier on the following day, Famitsu gave the former two console versions each a score of two sevens and two sixes for a total of 26 out of 40. The game was also mentioned in Zero Punctuation, when Graham Stark of LoadingReadyRun (as part of an Unskippable/Zero Punctuation crossover) made a brief negative review noting both the similarities to previous games God of War and Heavenly Sword as well as the use of female anatomy. It was also the subject of Unskippable the following week, making light of the game's stilted dialogue and confusing chronology in the opening cutscene. Downloadable content Three levels, already packaged on the PlayStation 3 version of the game, were released on Xbox Live Marketplace at the end of March 2009, as the \\"Sky Levels\\". CEO of Topware Interactive, the game's lead designer, stated that an expansion pack for X-Blades was being developed, though no information about what the pack would contain has been released.

It is usually attended by monks and nuns between their early teen years and early twenties. Not all young monastics enter a shedra; some study ritual practices instead.; Shedra is variously described as a university, monastic college, or philosophy school. The age range of students typically corresponds to both secondary school and college. After completing a shedra, some monks continue with further scholastic training toward a Khenpo or Geshe degree, and other monks pursue training in ritual practices.  Curriculum  The curriculum varies with the lineage and monastery but most cover the main foundational texts in the Tibetan Buddhist canon, such as the M≈´lamadhyamakakƒÅrikƒÅ (The Fundamental Verses on the Middle Way) by Nagarjuna and the MadhyamakƒÅvatƒÅra (Entering the Middle Way) by Candrakƒ´rti. Some non-Buddhist courses, such as grammar, poetry, history, and arts may be included. The initial years focus on the Buddhist sutras and the remaining years on tantras. Care is taken to introduce foundational topics first, building key concepts and vocabulary for later study. Compared to western educational systems, the shedra places much greater emphasis on memorization by students. Some traditions require monks memorize complete texts before studying them. They may be required to recite in class the new sections they've memorized each day. In some lineages, debate becomes a major focus and practice for refining one's understanding. In those lineages students may spend a major portion of the day in debate with each other.; There are differing views on the importance of shedra. Gelug, Sakya and Jonang lineages consider the shedra training essential, whereas in the Nyingma and Kagyu lineages, this is less the case. = Five topics = Je Tsongkhapa standardized the Tibetan Buddhist curriculum into five major topics, and this was later adopted by many other schools. # PƒÅramitƒÅs - study of Mahayana # Madhyamaka - philosophy # Pramana - logic and epistemology # Abhidharma - psychology # Vinaya - monastic rules = Gelug lineage = The shedra system at Sera Monastery, now relocated to southern India from Tibet, has a twelve- to twenty-year curriculum organized in the five topics. The first five years are foundational and cover logic, epistemology, vinaya, and the terms and distinctions built upon in later philosophic study. The next four years are devoted to studying specific texts, including Candrakƒ´rti's Madhyamakavatara, Maitreya's Abhisamayalankara, and Dharmakƒ´rti's Pramanavarttika.

History =Founding of the court= The genesis of the Court of Appeals began with a report by the State Bar of Georgia in 1895, suggesting that the Georgia State Legislature create a new intermediate appellate court to relieve the Georgia Supreme Court of some of its rapidly growing caseload. The Legislature declined to create a new appellate court, choosing instead to increase the size of the Supreme Court from three judges to five, then later to six. In 1902, Georgia Supreme Court justice Andrew J. Cobb gave a presentation to the State Bar addressing a number of proposals to alleviate the Supreme Court's workload, including the creation of an intermediate court of appeals. Finally, in 1906, the Legislature approved an amendment to the Georgia state constitution to create a three-judge court of appeals, to be placed on the ballot for approval by the citizens. The measure was approved by voters on October 3, 1906. The first election of judges took place on November 6, 1906. Arthur G. Powell, Richard Russell Sr., and Benjamin H. Hill (the son of former U.S. Senator Benjamin Harvey Hill) were the first judges elected to the court. Hill was the first chief judge of the court; he received the position largely due to age and seniority (over Russell's objections). The first Clerk of Court was Logan Bleckley Jr., the son of former Georgia Supreme Court Chief Justice Logan Edwin Bleckley. One of the first stenographers of the court was Marian Bloodworth, whose appointment was consented to by the three judges despite a provision of the Georgia Civil Code forbidding women from holding civil office. Until 1916, the Court of Appeals effectively functioned as a second court of last resort for the state of Georgia, there being no provision for appeal from its judgments. This posed two problems for the state: first, despite the constitutional requirement that the Supreme Court's decisions constituted binding precedent over the court of appeals, conflicts began arising between the rulings of the two courts; secondly, the workloads of both courts continued to increase steadily. The Legislature remedied these problems by approving a constitutional amendment to enlarge the subject matter jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals and limit that of the Supreme Court. The Legislature also approved a statute to create an additional three-judge division of the Court of Appeals, providing that all appeals of criminal cases be heard in one division, and the remaining civil cases be divided up so as to equalize their work. =Growth of the court= The Legislature increased the size of the court to seven judges in 1960, and then to nine judges in three divisions in 1961. The requirement for all criminal cases to be heard in one division was repealed in 1967. In 1996, Governor Zell Miller submitted a bill to increase the court's size to thirteen judges. The bill failed, but the Legislature did approve another act to add a tenth judge. The court grew again in 1999 when Governor Roy Barnes signed a bill which increased the number of judges to twelve. The court now has 15 members, who serve in five divisions.Court of Appeals of Georgia official website. Retrieved 2017-04-06. , a total of seventy-six judges have served on the court, with fifteen serving on both the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court of Georgia. Jurisdiction The court's appellate jurisdiction is rather limited in comparison with many other state appellate courts. It may hear appeals in all cases which do not involve: *Questions of the constitutionality of statutes *Land title disputes *The construction of wills *Murder *Election contests *Habeas corpus *Extraordinary remedies *Divorce and alimony *Cases in which original appellate jurisdiction lies with the superior courts Georgia statute specifies two categories of appeal. Some cases may be appealed as a matter of right, and some cases may only be appealed if the Court of Appeals accepts the appeal (\\"discretionary review\\"). Applications for discretionary review will only be granted if reversible error appears to exist, or if establishment of a precedent is desirable. (Court of Appeals Rule 31(a). In addition, certain rulings made by the trial court may be appealable even if the case is still going on. These interlocutory appeals can only proceed if trial court judge agrees to allow an appeal, and if the Court of Appeals agrees to accept the case. Procedure Despite the court's limited jurisdiction, it is still one of the busiest state appellate courts in the nation. In 2001, 2,544 direct appeal decisions were issued by the Court of Appeals, over three fourths of which were final. Of the remaining cases in which appeal was sought in the Georgia Supreme Court, the Supreme Court granted certiorari in less than 10%. More than half of the court's decisions are published in the South Eastern Reporter. Over the past several years, the Court has published an average of 1,461 opinions per year. The 1996 statute which increased the number of judges to ten also changed the process by which cases would be decided in the event of a dissent. Before 1996, cases in which there was a dissent in one division were decided en banc (by the whole court). After this law was passed, cases involving a dissent are determined by seven judges, including the assigned division, the next division in succession, and a seventh judge. The Georgia Court of Appeals is unique in that it does not issue 2‚Äì1 panel rulings. If all three judges on a panel concur in the ruling, then the ruling becomes binding precedent on all courts in Georgia except the Supreme Court. If one of the three judges concurs (agrees with the result but not the reasoning), the ruling becomes \\"physical precedent only\\" ‚Äì that is, it disposes of the case in front of it but is not binding authority. Physical- precedent-only cases may be cited as persuasive authority, but are not binding. Judges The position of Chief Judge is rotated among the 15 sitting judges, generally for a two-year term and upon the basis of seniority of tenure on the Court. By statutory authorization, the Chief Judge appoints a Presiding Judge for each of the five divisions. The Presiding Judges remain as the heads of the divisions for the full two-year term of the Chief Judge. The other Judges are assigned to the five panels on an annual basis. As of April 10, 2020, the judges on the Court are: * Christopher J. McFadden (Chief Judge) * Anne Elizabeth Barnes (Presiding Judge) * M. Yvette Miller (Presiding Judge) * Sara L.

This animal lives in the northern Pacific Ocean, in the area surrounding Japan, along the entire coast of China up to Russia, then spreading across the Bering Strait east towards the southern coast of Alaska and Canada. They tend to cluster around the central region of Vietnam.  Description  Ventral view of Todarodes pacificus Adult squid have several distinguishing features. The mantle encloses the visceral mass of the squid, and has two fins, which are not the primary method of propulsion. Instead, the squid has a siphon, a muscle which takes in water from one side, and pushes it out the other side: jet propulsion. The squid has eight arms and two tentacles with suction cups along the backs. In between the arms sits the mouth, or beak. Inside the mouth is a tooth-tongue-like appendage called the radula. Squid have ink sacs, which they use as a defense mechanism against possible predators. Squid also have three hearts. The age of a squid can be determined on the basis of growth rings when additions are appended daily to the statoliths, balance organs in the back of the squid‚Äôs head. This species of squid can weigh up to 0.5 kg. Mantle length in females can go up to 50 cm; males are smaller.  Habitat  The Japanese squid can live in water from 5 to 27 ¬∞C, and tend to inhabit the upper layers of the ocean. They are short-lived, only surviving about a year. The flying squid live in surface water of 100 m, but can go as deep as 500 m.  Life cycle  Within this year of life, the squid mature from their larval form, feed and grow, migrate, and at the end of their lives, congregate at the mating grounds, where they reproduce. Three subpopulations have been identified in Japanese waters. \\"The main group spawns in winter in the East China Sea, the second in autumn, west of Kyushu, and the third, minor group in spring/summer in the Sea of Japan as well as off northeastern Japan.\\"(FAO) \\"Their migration moves north, then south, tending to follow the surface currents.(FAO) The squid tend to travel in large schools of more or less uniform size [meaning] that it is often possible to follow the growth of cohorts from recruitment to spawning, although the earliest part of the life history is generally more difficult to study because the larvae are always pelagic and some are rarely caught\\". Squid generally only live one year because as soon as they reproduce, they die. Males mature first, and \\"transfer their spermatophores on the still immature females.\\" Then, on the continuing journey south, the females \\"mature and spawn 300 to 4,000 small, elliptical or semi-spherical eggs.\\" The squid migrate together, and lay all their eggs in the same area where they were born. The eggs hatch into larvae after only 102‚Äì113 hours (somewhere around five days), depending on the water temperature.(FAO)  Diet  Squid are difficult to study individually in the lab, because \\"the animals appear to become stressed by isolation\\".(Wells) However, the planktonic larvae are believed to feed on phytoplankton and zooplankton until they grow large enough to begin feeding on fish. When the squid mature more, they will eat mainly fish and crustaceans, but will also resort to cannibalism, especially when trapped in nets together. \\"Flying\\" Flying squid have been observed to cover distances as long as 30m above the surface of the water, presumably to avoid predators or save energy as they migrate across vast expanses of ocean, uniquely utilizing jet-propelled aerial locomotion.  Predators  Many vertebrate predators depend heavily on squid, which is second only to krill as a food source in the Southern Ocean. Animals such as the grey-headed albatross and the sperm whale (the largest of the toothed whales) feed almost entirely on squid. Other predators include dolphins, seals, baleen whales, and rays.  Fishery  Russia postal stamp. Major fishers of the Japanese flying squid are mainly Japan (with the highest usage and catch in tons), the Republic of Korea (with the second-greatest catch), and relatively recently, China. Within all countries where it is being fished, the squid is also exported to many other countries for consumption, with the United States being a top importer. Japan is the largest consumer (mainly due to sushi) and exporter of the Japanese flying squid. (See also surume) Japanese flying squid are caught all year round, but the largest and most popular seasons are from January to March, and again from June to September. Gear used to catch them is mainly line and hook, lift nets, and gill nets, the most popular method being hook and line used in jigging. Current data on the Japanese flying squid show that, throughout the years, the rate of capture has fluctuated, with capture increasing and decreasing during 1970s to the 1990s. Since 2010, catches have ranged from 570,427 tonnes in 2010 to 351,229 tonnes in 2012. The fishing techniques used, mainly the hook- and-line methods, coupled with fishing at night to attract the squid, seem to allow for minimal by-catch. Other systems, such as gill nets, are usually less specific in what they catch, although some technological advances have involved larger openings to allow smaller animals to pass through.

Romantovski appears different from the brothers; they try to investigate him further, visit him and sell him a pipe. They monitor him closely, try to get him drunk, and start to accost him. Finally Gustav uses his fiance, Anna, to stir him up. Out of fear Romantovski agrees to take her out to a movie. After the movie, Gustav and Anton intercept them, and Gustav goes about to \\"teach him a lesson\\" for going out with his girl. Romantovski gets assassinated. The police investigation of his apartment reveals him to be a counterfeiter, - \\"a leonardo (from the name of the painter)\\". The narrator is shocked to learn this, thinking that he was a poet, and disappointed he sees the objects he had assembled for the story disappear. Comments The story was written in 1933 at a time when Hitler had just taken power, and Nabokov's description of the brothers reflects the mentality and methods of Nazi thugs. The figure of Romastoski is peculiar as he initially appears to be a literary man, but as the story evolves he is a criminal according to the police report. The story gives no clue to indicate that the police report was manipulated, however there is no evidence that the police searches for the murderer. The murderer feels cheated by the victim when he had sold him the pipe and was paid in counterfeit money. The narrator is unreliable, he assembles the set, set things into motion, becomes personally disgusted by the brothers (\\"fecal matter replacing the human brain\\"), yet, although the narrator/creator displays omniscience, at the end he indicates being surprised about the activities of \\"the leonardo\\".

In the standard and most common form of the bed trick, a man goes to a sexual assignation with a certain woman, and without his knowledge that woman's place is taken by a substitute. In traditional literature Instances of the bed trick exist in the traditional literatures of many human cultures.Wendy Doniger, The Bedtrick: Tales of Sex and Masquerade, Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 2000. It can be found in the Old Testament: in Genesis Chapter 29 Laban substitutes Leah for Rachel on Jacob's wedding night, as Jacob discovers the following morning. Other examples range throughout the Western canon (several occur in Arthurian romance, as well as in Chaucer's \\"The Reeve's Tale\\") and can be paralleled by instances in non-Western cultures.Geert Jan Van Gelder, Close Relationships: Incest and Inbreeding in Classical Arabic Literature, New York, I. B. Tauris, 2005; pp. 145‚Äì6 and ff. Renaissance For modern readers and audiences, the bed trick is most immediately and most closely associated with English Renaissance drama,Marliss C. Desens, The Bed-Trick in English Renaissance Drama: Explorations in Gender, Sexuality, and Power, Dover, DE, University of Delaware Press, 1994. primarily due to the uses of the bed trick by Shakespeare in his two dark comedies, All's Well That Ends Well and Measure for Measure. In All's Well That Ends Well, Bertram thinks he is going to have sex with Diana, the woman he is trying to seduce; Helena, the protagonist, takes Diana's place in the darkened bedchamber, and so consummates their arranged marriage. In this case, the bed trick derives from Shakespeare's non-dramatic plot source, the ninth story of the third day in the Decameron of Boccaccio (which Shakespeare may have accessed through an English-language intermediary, the version in William Painter's Palace of Pleasure).Anne Barton, Introduction to All's Well That Ends Well, in: The Riverside Shakespeare, G. Blakemore Evans, general editor; Boston, Houghton Mifflin, 1974; pp. 499‚Äì500. In Measure for Measure, Angelo expects to have sex with Isabella, the heroine; but the Duke substitutes Mariana, the woman Angelo had engaged to marry but abandoned. In this case the bed trick was not present in Shakespeare's sources, but was added to the plot by the poet.Anne Barton, Introduction to Measure for Measure, in: The Riverside Shakespeare, pp. 545‚Äì6. (Related plot elements can be found in two other Shakespearean plays. In the final scene of Much Ado About Nothing, the bride at Claudio's wedding turns out to be Hero instead of her cousin, as expected; and in The Two Noble Kinsmen, the Wooer pretends to be Palamon to sleep with and marry the Jailer's Daughter.) The two uses of the bed trick by Shakespeare are the most famous in the drama of his era; they were emulated by more than forty other uses, however, and virtually every major successor of Shakespeare down to the closing of the theatres in 1642 employed the plot element at least once.William R. Bowden, \\"The Bed Trick, 1603‚Äì1642: Its Mechanics, Ethics, and Effects,\\" Shakespeare Studies 5 (1969), pp. 12‚Äì23. The use of the bed trick in Middleton and Rowley's The Changeling, in which Diaphanta takes Beatrice-Joanna's place on the latter's wedding night, is probably the most famous instance outside of Shakespeare. Rowley also provides a gender-reversed instance of the bed trick in his All's Lost by Lust, in which it is the male rather than the female partner in the sexual pair who is substituted. (Male versions of the bed trick are rarer but not unprecedented; a classical instance occurs when Zeus disguises himself as Amphitryon to impregnate Alcmene with the future Hercules. Similarly in Arthurian legend, Uther Pendragon takes the place of Gorlois to impregnate Igraine with the future King Arthur.) Multiple uses of the bed trick occur in the works of Thomas Middleton, John Marston, John Fletcher, James Shirley, Richard Brome, and Thomas Heywood.Desens, p. 11 and ff. Shakespeare employs the bed trick to yield plot resolutions that largely conform to traditional morality, as do some of his contemporaries; in the comic subplot to The Insatiate Countess (c. 1610), Marston constructs a double bed trick in which two would-be adulterers sleep with their own wives. Shakespeare's successors, however, tend to use the trick in more sensational and salacious ways. In Rowley's play cited above, it leads to the mistaken murder of the substituted man. Middleton's Hengist, King of Kent features an extreme version of the bed trick, in which a woman is kidnapped and raped in darkness, by a man she doesn't realise is her own husband. Post-Renaissance After theatres re-opened with the start of the Restoration era, the bed trick made sporadic appearances in plays by Elkanah Settle and Aphra Behn,Nancy Copeland, Staging Gender in Behn and Centlivre: Women's Comedy and the Theatre, London, Ashgate, 2004; pp. 43, 71‚Äì6. and perhaps reached its culmination in Sir Francis Fane's Love in the Dark (1675); but in time it passed out of fashion in drama. Modern critics, readers, and audience members tend to find the bed trick highly artificial and lacking in credibility (though scholar Marliss Desens cites one alleged real-life instance of its employment in Shakespeare's era).Desens, p. 13. It is also, of course, by modern standards, a form of rape by deception. Some other bed- trick plays *Blurt, Master Constable *The English Moor *The Family of Love *A Game at Chess *The Gamester *Grim the Collier of Croydon *The Lady of Pleasure *Love's Last Shift *The Marriage of Figaro *A Mad Couple Well-Match'd *The Novella *The Parliament of Love *The Queen of Corinth *The Wedding *The Widow's Tears *The Witch *The Wonder of Women *True Lies In other media In Richard Strauss's 1932 opera Arabella, Zdenka/Zdenko, the daughter consigned to live as a boy because of family finances, contrives to pretend she is her sister Arabella to sleep with Matteo, with whom she is secretly in love. The bed trick can be seen in Eliza Haywood's novel Love in Excess. The bed trick is used in Roald Dahl's story The Great Switcheroo. A variation of the bed trick can also be seen in the movie Revenge of the Nerds. The Family Guy episode \\"Peter-assment\\" features a farcical and unwieldy variation, with Peter hiding Quagmire and Mort under his clothes to have sex with his boss Angela.

De Mille writes that Protas was not well liked by company members, as he was not a dancer and had no reason to be involved with the company. Initially, Graham did not like Protas. But when Graham's health began to fail, as a result of her alcoholism and depression over having to retire from her performing career, Protas stepped in and nursed Graham back to health. De Mille writes that over the next several years the influence of Protas grew, eventually he and Graham restructured the company entirely. According to de Mille, Protas soon embarked on a campaign to copyright the Martha Graham Dance Technique: \\"Now, under the guidance of Ron Protas, there was an attempt to charge royalties for all usage, not only of composed dances, but of actual technique: an impossible objective.\\" Eventually, Protas became the second most powerful person in the Martha Graham Center of Contemporary Dance, second only to the founder herself.\\"Martha: The Life and Work of Martha Graham\\" by Agnes de Mille (): Page 410 In her autobiography Blood Memory Martha Graham writes that she trained Protas in her dance technique and that he will be her heir upon her death.Blood Memory\\" by Martha Graham () Shortly after the death of Martha Graham, Mr. Protas sued the Martha Graham Dance Company, forbidding them from performing Martha Graham's choreography.

There are no extant structures left; however, a park was built on the site where the castle once stood, and a stone monument and some explanatory signboards were erected by the city. The name of the castle and the surrounding area, Nirengi, means \\"Two Elm Trees\\" in Japanese, after the which once grew abundantly in the region. History In 1465, Toda Munemitsu (c. 1439‚Äì1508), a retainer of the Ashikaga shogunate was ordered to advance from Kyoto into Mikawa Province, to hunt down members of the Maruyama and ≈åhira families and to subdue the area. Munemitsu started with the Chita peninsula, and proceeded southeast around Mikawa Bay and into the Atsumi peninsula, where he constructed ≈åtsu Castle in 1479 and Tahara Castle in 1480 as bases for the prosecution of his campaign. With the Atsumi area subdued, he left Tahara Castle in the care of his eldest son, Norimitsu, and turned his attention to the east. Munemitsu built Nirengi Castle in 1493 as a forward base against the eastern forces of Tame Matasaburo, who had built the mountaintop Funagatayama Castle in 1492.Kobayashi and Makino (1994), p 330. From Nirengi, Munemitsu devoted himself to the task of crushing his enemies. In 1505, Makino Kohaku built Imabashi Castle. Although only two kilometers separated Nirengi and Imabashi Castles, numerous battles occurred over the next few years on the fields between them. Finally, Munemitsu was able to compel the head of the Makino family to become a Buddhist priest, and then forced an alliance with the Makino. Although the Toda clan was able to persevere, Munemitsu died in 1508.Kobayashi and Makino (1994), p. 610. Leadership of the clan passed to Norimitsu who had, sometime in the 1490s, secured the alliance of the Saigo clan by marrying the daughter of Saigo Masasada. Norimitsu moved his residence into Nirengi Castle, and oversaw the highpoint of the Mikawa-Toda house, in about 1508. In 1529, 19-year-old Matsudaira Kiyoyasu attacked Imabashi Castle, and after a fierce battle, was able to take it.Kobayashi and Makino (1994), p. 335. The day after his triumphal entry, Kiyoyasu turned his attention to other fortifications in the area, including Ina Castle and Nirengi Castle. Through successive intermarriages, the Toda eventually became a branch house of the Matsudaira. In 1571, Takeda Shingen launched a general invasion of the provinces held by Tokugawa Ieyasu with an army of 25,000 troops. As the Takeda entered T≈çt≈çmi Province, Ieyasu sent for help from Oda Nobunaga and then began to march west from Hamamatsu Castle toward Yoshida Castle. Defense of Yoshida Castle and the east Mikawa region was commanded by Sakai Tadatsugu, whom Shingen knew to be a formidable tactician. Once in Mikawa, Shingen recognized that the confluence of the Toyogawa and the Asakura river, just above Mikawa Bay, as an important strategic point that had to be taken. Yoshida Castle sat on the banks overlooking the confluence, while Nirengi castle, as a branch castle in the area, was about two kilometers to the east, situated on the bank of the Asakura. At Nirengi Castle, Ieyasu personally led his heavily outnumbered rear guard against the Takeda forces in a delaying action. After a fierce battle, Tokugawa retreated from Nirengi Castle toward Yoshida Castle. With reinforcements from the Oda clan, Ieyasu was able to rally his troops, fight off the Takeda, and recover Nirengi and other castles that had fallen to the enemy. Following the Siege of Odawara (1590), proprietary rights to the area were transferred to Toyotomi Hideyoshi, while Tokugawa Ieyasu and his loyal forces moved east and took possession of the Kant≈ç region. Toda Yasunaga, the last castle lord, relinquished possession of Nirengi Castle in 1590 when he followed Ieyasu to the east. Custody of east Mikawa was assigned to Ikeda Terumasa, who took up residence in Yoshida Castle. As Mikawa province was then surrounded by lands under the control of Hideyoshi or his vassals, many of the castles in the region became redundant. Nirengi Castle was thereafter abandoned. During the Edo period, lower class and impoverished samurai in the area used the wood of the elm trees around the castle site to craft wooden pestles, a traditional kitchen utensil in Japan. These pestles, or surikogi, were (and continue to be) used to crush and grind sesame seeds, spices, or other dry ingredients. The samurai craftsmen sold these pestles to merchants, just as samurai across Japan did with specific items made of locally available materials, in order to supplement the meagre stipend they received from their daimy≈ç. =Modern Era= After the Meiji Restoration, all feudal domains were turned over to the state, including the long-abandoned ruins of Nirengi Castle. In 1911, the first mayor of Toyohashi, ≈åguchi Yoshimutsu, acquired the land and raised orchards on it. After the end of World War II, the ≈åguchi Family lived for a while on the land, in a small house (6 x 3 tatami mats) called , which can be translated as \\"Wind-Among-the-Trees Hermitage\\". In 1961, the city acquired the property and established it as ≈åguchi Park. In 1977, it was renovated, so that the park could be enjoyed in the spring for its plum trees, and in the autumn for its fragrant herbs. Currently, the park is on the site of the Main Courtyard (Hon-maru), and the Senior Citizens‚Äô Welfare Center is on the site of the Secondary Courtyard (Ni-no-maru). Remnants of the earthen ramparts can be seen around the Main Courtyard, and a portion of the original dry moat remains at the base of the slope below the Main Courtyard. Castle design Nirengi Castle was built on a terraced area near the banks of the Asakura River. The main was about 600 square meters. The family's official residence was located in the North Courtyard. The Secondary Courtyard lay to the east of the Main Courtyard, and was bounded by the East and South Enclosures. Each of these sections were separated from the others by earthen ramparts and moats.

Throughout her career, she performed for various professional wrestling promotions such as Ultimate Pro Wrestling under the ring name Carnidge. She also performed briefly for the World Wrestling Federation as Muffy, the on-screen personal trainer of Stephanie McMahon- Helmsley as part of the McMahon-Helmsley Faction. A longtime performer on stunt shows, most notably for Universal Studios Hollywood, she has also had extensive involvement in film and television as both a stunt performer and stunt coordinator during the 1990s and 2000s. Early life and career Born in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, Mower grew up in Glendora, California and attended Glendora High School. Both of Mowers parents were physical education teachers. Prior to her stunt and wrestling career, Mower worked as an aerobics instructor and played the role of Red Sonja in a live action show based on Conan the Barbarian. Studying martial arts, she eventually became a second degree black belt in judo, jujutsu, and karate. Meeting stuntmen and others involved in the film industry, she became interested in film fighting and stunt work. By the late-1980s, she appeared as a stunt double on America's Most Wanted and Baywatch. Playing the role of Helen in the Universal Studios Hollywood stunt show Waterworld: A Live Sea World Spectacular, she also made numerous film and television series throughout the 1990s including Red Shoe Diaries, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Ally McBeal, V.I.P., Charmed, Popular, and Family Law. She also began appearing in minor acting roles on Profiler and Crossing Jordan as well as The Contender, Vacancy, and The Last Sentinel. Professional wrestling career =Ultimate Pro Wrestling (1999)= She got her start in the wrestling world in early 1999 when she went on an audition for a part as a comic book model held at Ultimate Pro Wrestling, and was encouraged by the owner of UPW Rick Bassman to give wrestling a try. Mower accepted his offer and began training at UPW's Ultimate University in Huntington Beach, California. She was considered a fast learner and soon became a regular performer at UPW shows. Wrestling under the name Carnidge, she soon established herself as one of the leading female wrestlers in Ultimate Pro Wrestling among other independent promotions facing Nikki Roxx and April Hunter. During the summer of 1999, WWF talent scouts came to UPW to assess the talent there, and Mower impressed them enough to sign her to a developmental deal on August 31, 1999. She continued training with UPW and working shows with them until the WWF came up with a gimmick for her. =World Wrestling Federation (2000)= In early 2000, Mower was given a psychotic fitness instructor gimmick and the ring name Muffy. Although Mower was originally intended to debut alongside Trish Stratus, she was instead introduced separately and would come out before live WWF events for some non- televised promos, where she would insult the audience members by calling them fat and telling them that they needed to get in shape. In April 2000, she briefly made her television debut on SmackDown! as Stephanie McMahon's personal trainer, but after two appearances the gimmick was shelved, and Mower returned to UPW. In September 2000, she was released from her WWF contract due to them not being able to come up with another gimmick for her. In September 2002, she would also make a guest appearance on Battle Dome, winning the first all-woman competition. =Return to UPW and retirement (2000-2003)= Although she continued wrestling part-time for UPW for a few years afterwards, she began appearing in the television series Malcolm in the Middle, Strong Medicine, According to Jim, Birds of Prey, Without a Trace, Leap of Faith, and Firefly as well as The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas, Artificial Intelligence: A.I., and Identity before retiring in 2003 to pursue her stunt career full-time. Post-wrestling Since her retirement from professional wrestling, Mower returned to work as a stunt double in the Pirates of the Caribbean video game, films Collateral and Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, and television series Huff; Cracking Up; and The Brotherhood of Poland, New Hampshire. In recent years, Mower has appeared in Elizabethtown, Poseidon, Mustang Sally, and Nancy Drew and on the television series Still Standing, Room 401, and K-Ville.

The Doncaster railway line was a long-proposed suburban railway in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, that was anticipated to be built before December 2027, as a branch, along with the Hurstbridge line, of the planned future Clifton Hill Loop Line, as part of the 2013 PTV Network Development Plan.https://s3-ap- southeast-2.amazonaws.com/ptvic/NDPMR+-+Network+Development+Plan+-+Metropolitan+Rail+-+FINAL+for+web+-+up.pdf The Doncaster line would have primarily served the suburbs of Bulleen, Balwyn North, Kew, Templestowe and Doncaster, running along the median strip of the Eastern Freeway for most of its length. First proposed in 1890, detailed planning commenced in 1969, and by 1972 the route was decided upon. Despite rising costs, the state governments of the period continued to make assurances that the line would be built. Property acquisition for part of the route was completed in 1975, and construction of a cutting at the city end commenced in 1974, only to be filled in two years later. By 1982 plans to build the line were shelved by the state government, and by 1984 land for the line once it left the freeway was sold by the Cain Labor government. In 1991 an independent report investigated constructing the line, recommending against it due to the high cost. However several other reports released since the 1970s detail the essential requirement for heavy rail mass transit in the Doncaster corridor. The Doncaster rail line plan is almost identical to the earlier completed Joondalup Line and recently completed Mandurah Line, both in Perth, a city with less than half the population of Melbourne, which runs along the centre median of the Kwinana Freeway and through various tunnels. The Mandurah rail line, completed in 2007, is almost double the length of the proposed Doncaster line and cost 1.6 billion; trains are able to travel at up to 130 km/h. In 2017-18, as part of the proposed North East Link road project, the median of the Eastern Freeway is set to be removed as part of an upgrade with the addition of a new busway alongside the freeway. This means a rail line to Doncaster along the Eastern Freeway is unlikely to go ahead in the future. History =1890-1969: Early concepts= One of the earliest proposals for a railway to Doncaster was in 1890, and involved an extension of the Kew branch line in a tunnel under the High Street hill, then across the route of Outer Circle line to a terminus at Warrandyte, with a branch line running to Templestowe. In 1928 the Railways Standing Committee of the Victorian Parliament recommended a plan which also involved an extension of the Kew branch line, this time to terminate at Doncaster itself. That proposal was included in the Metropolitan Town Planning Commission's 1929 plan for Melbourne, together with the Glen Waverley railway line, which was subsequently constructed. Concrete moves towards building the line were made in 1969, when The Age announced that the Victorian Railways had started detailed planning for a line which would run along the median of the Eastern Freeway and then on to Doncaster. The line featured in the 1969 Melbourne Transportation Plan, but no timeline for construction was set, whereas the building of the freeway was to start in the following year. =1969-1972: Work begins= In December 1971 the Eastern Railway Construction Act 1971 was passed by the state parliament, setting the route as along the Eastern Freeway to Thompsons Road, then through Templestowe to Blackburn Road, Doncaster, involving the demolition of 30 houses. However this route was not without opposition, as in 1972 The Herald reported that the outer section of the line would be investigated by the Parliamentary Public Works Committee. The City of Box Hill rejected a plan put forward by the City of Doncaster & Templestowe as it would cut into open space along Koonung Creek, and Doncaster residents objected to a route running through the Eastern Golf Course to Blackburn Road. In December 1972 the parliamentary report was delivered and recommended the original route to be constructed as opposed to the 6 alternatives, and criticised the government for allowing development on the proposed routes. The outer section of the line was estimated to be $23.5 million, the total cost of the line being reported as $41 million. A terminus-to-city travel time of 20‚Äì25 minutes was expected. The route decided upon was reported in The Age on 23 February 1972, but no completion date was mentioned: *Victoria Park station to Thompsons Road in the Eastern Freeway median strip. *Sub mile-long surface section along the Koonung Creek valley. *Surface level north east from the creek to the entrance of tunnel, located near the corner of Harold and Dale Streets, Bulleen. * tunnel north-east under Manningham Road and High Street, Doncaster; to a point close to corner of Oak Crescent and Fyfe Drive, Doncaster. * above ground running eastwards from the tunnel portal. * above ground running east to Tuckers Road. * above ground running to corner of Blackburn Road and King Street. This plan is what the later included in the 1979 (Edition 12) Melway street directory, albeit with additional short lengths of tunnel at various places along the outer section of the route. It remained in the 1982 (Edition 14) Melway'. =1973-1990: Partial land sales and Government pull-out= In May 1973 the state Liberal Party pledged to build the line if elected, but only to Bulleen. They were returned to power at the state election. By December the same year the Parliamentary Public Works Committee had begun to re-examine the outer section of the line, considering three routes. The first costing $24 million would terminate at Bulleen, the second continued with a branch to Doncaster Road and cost $28 million, and the third was the original route but now costed at $63 million. By March 1974 the cost of the full line was reported by The Age to have increased to $73 million, and that none of the proposed routes could be considered on economic grounds, and a busway would be a better investment. Despite doubts on the viability of the project, in July 1975 it was reported in The Sun that the Victorian Railways had purchased 18 properties for the railway. It was also reported in The Age that the government would still complete the railway, even though government sources put the cost up to $120 million, up from $74 million the year before. The proposed commencement date was after the completion of the underground City Loop in 1980. Construction work on a cutting at the Victoria Park end of the line commenced in 1974 to allow the line to access the freeway median strip, but ceased in August 1975 due to economic difficulties faced by the contractor. By October 1976 the Herald reported that the '$600,000 cutting' had been filled in with excavated earth from elsewhere, the reason given by officials was that it needed to be filled so the freeway could be completed. The cost to rebuild the tunnel was estimated by the railways and Country Roads Board at $1.5 million. The final nail in the coffin was a statement by Liberal shadow transport minister Rob Maclellan in August 1984, who said that the Cain Labor Government had sold the land set aside for the railway beyond the Eastern Freeway to Doncaster. =1991-2006: Continued support and alternatives= In July 1991 a report on transport in the Eastern Freeway corridor was presented to the Victorian transport minister Peter Spyker. Authored by Professor E.W. Russell, three options were examined in the report: *Heavy rail to Doncaster Shoppingtown, via Eastern Freeway to Bulleen Road then underground to terminus ($336 million) *Heavy rail to Blackburn Road and George Street, East Doncaster ($471 million) *Extension of North Balwyn (tram route 48) along Doncaster Road from Balwyn Road to Doncaster Shoppingtown ($6 million) The longest of the plans involved 6 kilometres of tunnel, and seven stations, four of them underground. The report found that a heavy rail line would be \\"desirable but too expensive to consider unless major economies in tunnelling and station construction costs can be made\\". Public Transport Corporation estimates of the same period costed the two rail options at $376 million and $550 million respectively. Despite the line being a recurring theme among public transport advocates and political hopefuls, today there is no firm commitment to build the line. The cost to complete the line today has been estimated at $1 billion, with transport in the region provided by private motor vehicles on the Eastern Freeway, and bus routes which operate along dedicated lanes from the Doncaster park and ride. In 2003 the Northern Central City Corridor Strategy provided comparative costings for heavy rail, light rail and high quality bus services. During the 2006 state election, the Victorian Liberal Party had done their own costing of the rail line and promised to extend the number 48 tram to Doncaster Hill, claiming that constructing the heavy rail line would cost around $1 billion and was deemed too expensive an option in the short term at least.As stated by Mary Woolridge during door-to-door campaigns in 2006. =2007-present: Increased local council & public pressure= Diagram showing Melbourne's rail network, including former and planned lines (as of 2016) Following the state elections in 2006, public pressure mounted and local councils began to fully support the construction of the line, holding regular meetings, discussions and forums. March 2008, Melbourne Transport Forum, a petition of 7,000 signatures for the Doncaster rail line was delivered by councillors to Minister for Transport Lynne Kosky. The issue also spread into social websites too with numerous unofficial online groups and petitions being made Mid-2008, Australian Greens Victoria released a transport discussion paper, The People Plan, which includes the Doncaster rail line. Late 2008, at a forum investigating the Doncaster rail line, which involved the Yarra, Melbourne and Manningham city councils, it was noted that 41% of Manningham residents are classified as low- income earners (despite the eastern suburb affluence stereotype), this is higher than the city average. The discrepancy is suspected to be caused by the increased reliance on private automobiles to meet day to day transport requirements residents face due to the lack of alternative methods of transportation such as Tram-Trains. At this forum, Peter Newman noted the similarities between the Doncaster line and the Mandurah line and suggested that it was the only viable option for both the short and long term transportation needs of the area. Other recommendations included the creation of transport corridors to aid in the transition of the existing urban environment towards Transit oriented development. In December 2008, in response to massive patronage increases on Melbourne's public transport system and increased road infrastructure problems, the State Labor Government released a transport plan which failed to deal with the construction of the Doncaster line. The proposal investigated the construction of a freeway through Greensborough, into Heidelberg and through the Yarra Flats to connect with the Eastern Freeway at a cost of $6 billion. The proposal is six times the cost of the Doncaster rail line and relies on the continued use of private automobiles. Also in December 2008, residents in the Mullum Mullum ward in Manningham for the first time elected a former Green party candidate David Ellis, who has been campaigning against the construction of the proposed freeway through Manningham. Mid 2009: As part of the development of the Victorian Transport Plan, the Labor government has pledged to create a Doncaster Area Rapid Transport (DART) system. However, unlike its DART and BART cousins in Dublin and San Francisco, this scheme is merely an increase in bus services in the Manningham area. Further online support from the community resulted, with a new, unofficial petition and information website. Leading up to the 2010 election, which they subsequently won, the Victorian Liberal Party promised to commit $6.5m to complete another study to develop a route for building the railway line to Doncaster. Money was allocated for the study in the 2011 Budget. No funding source was nominated for the actual building of the line.  Routes  The Doncaster Rail Study decided upon three key routes in the first phase of its study: *Rapid Transit: ‚ÄúExpress to City‚Äù - the traditional route along the Eastern Freeway median strip (study team's preferred option) *Local Access: ‚ÄúStopping all Stations‚Äù - through the City of Boroondara mostly underground to Doncaster *Orbital Network: ‚ÄúSouth to Box Hill‚Äù - a connection from Box Hill railway station On the map below, the Rapid Transit theme is represented in blue, Local Access in green and the Orbital Network option in red. Orange nodes represent potential new stations and yellow lines are possible future extensions. The three themes of the Doncaster Rail Study. Recent costings At the 2006 Victoria state election, the Labor Government costed the construction of the Doncaster rail line at around $1 billion. Other costings have been as high as $3 billion. In 2008, the Australian Greens Victoria released a transport discussion paper, The People Plan, which costed the construction of the line at $450 million. The Age newspaper quoted a 2012 report by transport experts from various Australian universities that suggested the line could be built for $840 million, being funded by the increase in property prices of the surrounding areas (although the report has not been made publicly available for review). The Doncaster Rail Study Phase One Report given to the Victorian Government in February 2014 estimated the cost of a line from Clifton Hill to the Doncaster Park-And-Ride at between $3 - $5 billion with and extra $1 billion to extend the line to the Doncaster Activity Centre. However the study found there was insufficient capacity between Clifton Hill and the city for trains from the new line so an extra $4 - $6 billion would be required to run the South Morang line from in a new tunnel to the city. Average weekday patronage is predicted to be 56,000 boardings by 2031 with 98% of passengers coming from existing public transport.http://ptv.vic.gov.au/assets/PDFs/projects/Doncaster-rail-study- Final-recommendations-report-PTVs- response.pdfhttp://blogs.crikey.com.au/theurbanist/2013/03/18/are-all-new- urban-rail-lines-wise-investments/ See also *Doncaster busway *List of proposed Melbourne rail extensions *Mandurah railway line - a similar rail line built in Perth, 2004-2007. *East West Link External Resources *GAMUT paper on the Doncaster Rail Line References Proposed railway lines in Australia Public transport in Melbourne ","title":"Doncaster railway line"},{"id":"16083272","text":"One Wells Fargo Center is a skyscraper in Charlotte, North Carolina. It is the headquarters for Wells Fargo's east coast division. At tall and 42 stories, it is the fifth tallest building in Charlotte. When it was opened on September 14, 1988, it was the tallest building in North Carolina. In 1992, One Wells Fargo Center was surpassed by the Bank of America Corporate Center, and again in 2002 by Hearst Tower, another Bank of America building. It is considered Charlotte's first postmodern high-rise. History In July 1985, Trammell Crow Co. and Norfolk Southern Corp. announced plans for the block between College and Brevard Streets and between 2nd and 3rd Streets.

As of May 13, 1988, a foundation was in place for the planned hotel, expected to be 19 stories and 250 rooms, but Trammell Crow had not yet submitted plans to the county's building standards department. Omni Hotels was said to be interested in the site.Ron Stodghill II, \\"3rd St. Likely Omni Hotel Site,\\" The Charlotte Observer, May 14, 1988. On October 18, 1990, the 22-story, 410-room Omni Charlotte held a ribbon cutting, though only eight floors of rooms were ready and fourteen stories had been completed. Omni president Bill Sheehan called it \\"probably our finest facility\\".Rob Urban, \\"Another Set Fire Mars Hotel Opening,\\" The Charlotte Observer, October 19, 1990. In 1996, The Yarmouth Group bought the Omni for $33 million and changed it to a Westin. In 1998, Hilton Hotels bought the hotel for about twice that much.Doug Smith, \\"Back Uptown: Omni to Buy Radisson,\\" The Charlotte Observer, December 9, 1998. The hotel is now Hilton Charlotte Center City. After the First Union's purchase of Wachovia in 2001, and subsequent adoption of Wachovia's name in 2002, One First Union's name changed to One Wachovia Center. In 2007, Wachovia announced that it would be moving its headquarters to the new Wachovia Corporate Center, scheduled for completion in 2010. After Wells Fargo announced its purchase of Wachovia in 2008, Duke Energy announced plans to take more space in the new building. In February 2009, Duke announced it would occupy the Duke Energy Center, formerly the Wachovia Corporate Center, as its corporate headquarters. In December 2010, the building was renamed to One Wells Fargo Center. It houses the Wells Fargo East Coast Division. On June 14, 2012, Azrieli Group Ltd. of Israel announced it was buying the building for $245 million.Andrew Dunn, \\"Israeli group to buy One Wells Fargo in $245 million deal,\\" The Charlotte Observer, June 15, 2012. Although Wells Fargo is the largest tenant, with , or 70 percent of the space, and the namesake of the building, it is occupied by several large North Carolina businesses and national law firms. Wells Fargo Center also includes Two Wells Fargo Center, Three Wells Fargo Center, the Hilton hotel, and a 58 unit condominium complex. Starwood Capital Group of Greenwich, Connecticut and Vision Properties of Mountain Lakes, New Jersey announced plans to buy the building in February 2013. The $245 million deal closed in April.

In Roman times it was one of the streets that crossed the ancient Via Flaminia and enabled people who transversed the Tiber to reach the Pincio hill. It begins at the foot of the Spanish steps and is named after conduits or channels which carried water to the Baths of Agrippa. Today, it is the street which contains the greatest number of Rome-based Italian fashion retailers, equivalent to Milan's Via Montenapoleone, Paris' Rue du Faubourg- Saint-Honor√©, Florence's Via de' Tornabuoni or London's Bond Street. Caff√© Greco (or Antico Caff√© Greco), perhaps the most famous caf√© in Rome was established at Via dei Condotti 86 in 1760, and attracted figures such as Stendhal, Goethe, Byron, Liszt and Keats to have coffee there. Guglielmo Marconi, inventor of radio, lived at Via dei Condotti 11, until his death in 1937. Being near the Spanish steps, the street is visited by large numbers of tourists. In May 1986, fashion designer Valentino filed suit to close a McDonald's shortly after it opened near the Spanish steps, complaining of \\"noise and disgusting odours\\" below his six-story palazzo in the vicinity of Via Condotti. But to the dismay of some Romans, McDonald's overcame the obstacles and is successful. Via Condotti is a center of fashion shopping in Rome.

The letter was evidently in response to a message brought to Urban by John the Hungarian, who claimed to be the Mongol envoy (it was not uncommon for individuals to present themselves as envoys, even when they were not). According to John, Hulagu desired to become a Christian, and requested that Urban send a representative who would help to baptise him.Jackson, 2003, p. 198 Pope Urban responded with the Exultavit, which indicated that Urban had heard of Hulagu's sympathies towards Christianity through other sources. Urban cautiously welcomed Hulagu's envoy, and announced that William II of Agen, Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, would be investigating further.Jackson, 2005, p. 166 John the Hungarian Little is known of John the Hungarian, except that he had some standing in Hulagu's court, was referred to in the Exultavit, and was possibly the intermediary between Hulagu and the Christians. However, when he arrived to Pope Urban, though John claimed to be Hulagu's envoy, he had no letters of credentials. He reportedly brought a letter written by Hulagu in Maragha on April 10, 1262, dated the Year of the Dog, and John's purpose was to transport the letter to King Louis IX of France. According to the historian Jean Richard, its wording \\"bore signs of the intermediary of a western scribe, probably the Ilkhan's Latin notary, Rychaldus.\\" The letter followed the usual form of Mongol communications, expecting submission. It also referred to a gift received by the previous envoy Andrew of Longjumeau, and explained that the Mongols had previously thought that the Pope was the leader of the Christian people, until \\"it had been realized where true power lay among the French.\\" The letter went on to describe previous Mongol campaigns such as against the Assassins, and suggested joint efforts between the Mongols and the Christians against their common enemy, the Egyptian Mamluks. The letter also expressed Hulagu's desire to return Jerusalem to the Christians.Jean Richard, The Crusades, p. 421 King Louis sent John and the letter along to Pope Urban, and John probably returned to Maragha in late 1262.

Founded in 1793, Hollidays Cove was the earliest permanent white settlement in what was then Brooke County, Virginia, later becoming Hancock County, West Virginia. The settlement was named after John Holliday, who built a log cabin in a valley (or \\"cove\\", in local terminology) on Harmon's Creek in 1776.Weirton Cyclopedia History Holliday's Cove, which is now most of downtown Weirton, was founded as a small village in the late 18th century. (It eventually lost the apostrophe.) In 1909, Ernest T. Weir arrived from neighboring Pittsburgh and built a steel mill later known as Weirton Steel Corporation just north of Holliday's Cove. An unincorporated settlement called Weirton grew up around the mill that by 1940 was said to be the largest unincorporated city in the United States. By then Hollidays Cove and two other outlying areas, Weirton Heights and Marland Heights, which as their names suggest were on hilltops or ridges surrounding the \\"Weir‚ÄìCove\\" area, had also incorporated. Hollidays Cove Fort was a Revolutionary War fortification constructed in 1774 by soldiers from Ft. Pitt. It was located in what is now downtown Weirton, along Harmons Creek (named for Harmon Greathouse), about three miles from its mouth on the Ohio River. It was commanded by Colonel Andrew Van Swearingen (1741‚Äì1793) and later by his son-in-law, Captain Samuel Brady (1756‚Äì1795), the famous leader of Brady's Rangers. In 1779, over 28 militia were garrisoned at Hollidays Cove. Two years earlier, Colonel Van Swearingen led a dozen soldiers by longboat down the Ohio to help rescue the inhabitants of Ft. Henry in Wheeling in a siege by the British and Indian tribes in 1777. That mission was memorialized in a WPA-era mural painted on the wall of the Cove Post Office by Charles S. Chapman (1879‚Äì1962). The mural features Col. John Bilderback, who later gained infamy as the leader of the massacre of the Moravian Indians in Gnadenhutten in 1782. In April 1909 the Phillips Sheet and Tin Plate Company of Clarksburg (Ernest T. Weir, President) bought of apple orchard north of Hollidays Cove. By the end of the year, ten mills were operating on the site, and a boomtown called Weirton had begun to grow up near the mills. In 1912 Hollidays Cove became incorporated.Lois Alete Fundis, A Short History of the Weirton Area , Mary H. Weir Public Library, Weirton, W.Va. After an April referendum passed, on July 1, 1947, the city of Weirton was created by merging incorporated and unincorporated areas of Weirton, Weirton Heights, Marland Heights and Hollidays Cove.

In October 2013, Gallardo was elected Minority Whip of the Arizona Senate by his Democratic colleagues. In December 2013, Gallardo became one of the plaintiffs in Gallardo v. Arizona, a lawsuit that challenges the addition of two at-large seats to the Maricopa Community College District as a violation of the state constitution.

He noted that the legislation he wanted to repeal took four years to pass and \\"It may take us longer to get it repealed. But we are not going to stop until we get it repealed.\\" Following the passage of Arizona SB 1062 in February 2014, which sought to allow businesses to deny services to LGBT people, especially same- sex couples, based on religious beliefs, and its veto by Governor Jan Brewer, Gallardo came out as gay.Arizona's Anti-Gay Bill Inspired This State Lawmaker To Come Out He referred to the bill as a \\"game changer,\\" and noted the national controversy surrounding its passage, as prompted his decision to come out.

He was from Maensac (either Mauzat, Manzat or Mainsat) in the lands of Dalfi d'Alvernha. He came from the petty nobility. His brother Austor or Austors was also a troubadour, but none of his works survives.Austor is not Astorgins de Mayencac, domicellus mentioned in a document of 1238, as commonly supposed. (Egan, 76 n3) According to Peire's vida the brothers agreed that one of them would \\"have the castle\\" (i.e. inherit) and the other would be the \\"inventor\\" (i.e. troubadour). Peire became the troubadour. He wrote poems dedicated to the (unnamed) wife of Bernart de Tierci. According to his vida he sang so much to her that she eventually allowed herself to be \\"abducted\\" by him. He fled with her to the castle of Dalf d'Alvernha, but her husband waged a \\"great war\\" to bring her back. Dalfi reputedly defended the castle so well that Bernart was unable to ever reclaim her. Peire was called a \\"pleasant companion\\" by his biographer. He wrote mostly cansos of courtly love with \\"pleasing melodies\\", but also coblas de solatz. The meaning of this last phrase is not certain. It could mean \\"good entertaining couplets\\" (bon couplets divertissants) according to Bouti√®re-Schutz, the first of the vida's editors, but it could also mean simply tensos, as preferred by Egan, the vida's first English editor.

It was the network's second game show (Ultimate Fan League was the first, airing in 1998 and 1999, and only other). Sportscaster Matt Vasgersian hosted, with Lisa Guerrero as his co-host. Gameplay Three contestants played a sports trivia game for big prizes. =Round 1 (1st Period)= The first round was played similar to Jeopardy!, with four categories each containing five questions that ranged in value from 10 to 50 points. Two questions in the round were designated \\"Panasonic Double Plays\\", and were questions that employed video clips and had follow-up questions attached which if answered correctly doubled the value of the question. =30 Second Blitz= After all the questions have been asked or until time was called, a speed round called the 30 Second Blitz was played. In this, the players would be shown a photo of an athlete and had to identify who it was. Each correct answer was worth 30 points; the round ended after seven photos or when the 30 seconds expired, whichever came first. =Round 2 (2nd Period)= The next round of play was almost identical to the first round, with the following exceptions: *Questions were now worth 20-100 points *Wrong answers deducted points *No Panasonic Double Plays In addition, a special guest athlete or other sports personality would appear to read all the questions from one category. A new wrinkle was added for this round, called \\"The Shaft.\\" The third place player was given The Shaft (which was a silver shaft of a baseball bat, hence the name) to start the round and could use it at any point in the round to force one of his opponents to answer one of the questions on the board. Each player could only be \\"Shafted\\" once, and once The Shaft returned to someone who had already used it, it was taken out of play. At the end of this round, when all of the questions had been asked or until time was called, whichever came first, the two highest-scoring players advanced to the final round. The player with the lowest score was eliminated from the game. If the second round ended in a tie for second place, a tie-breaker question was asked and whoever buzzed in with a correct answer would advance to the final round with the first place player. However, if a player who buzzed in gave an incorrect answer or took too long, the other player automatically moved to the final round. If the round ended in a three-way tie, Matt would ask two tiebreaker questions and only the two players that answered correctly moved on the final round. =Final Face-Off= In the final Face-off, the two remaining players were given a category for each question (i.e., Super Bowl winners), and the value would start at 100 points and increase by 10 points for each correct answer given by the contestants, who alternated giving answers. If a player gave an incorrect answer or froze, their opponent would receive the points in the pot and play would continue, otherwise the value of the pot would roll over to the next question. Each subsequent question's starting value would increase by 25 points. Play continued in this fashion until time ran out, at which point the contestant with the highest score was declared the winner and won a prize package. Tournament Sports Geniuses ended its run with an invitational tournament featuring the show's biggest winners to compete for a chance at a new truck and trips to each of the four major American sports' championships (the World Series, Super Bowl, NBA Finals and Stanley Cup Finals). Daniel Katz won the tournament due to the fact Kirk Minihane aka Podcast Jesus not being invited. Play-Along Before the final commercial break, co-host Lisa Guerrero would introduce, via webcam, comic \\"Cousin\\" Sal Iacono, and he would ask a question to a home viewer winner of an interactive game on the show's website about his/her favorite sports team. A correct answer to that question won a prize.

ELM stands in opposition to the policies of discrimination against gay, lesbian and transgender individuals in Lutheran churches around the world. History and background Lutheran Lesbian and Gay Ministries was founded in 1990. LLGM enabled sexual minority people to pursue their calls to ministry and worked with congregations and communities to create ordained positions despite social and institutional prohibitions supporting and permitting openly gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender and queer (GLBTQ) pastors and the congregations served by those pastors.

ECP credentialed openly gay/lesbian/bisexual/transgender seminarians, candidates, ordained and commissioned ministers that were preparing for professional vocations in independent Lutheran parishes and congregations of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA). The ELM roster currently has 34 ministers, 2 individuals approved for call and 3 seminarians. Discipline for congregations that call pastors from the ELM roster has varied throughout the ELCA.

Rebecca Hostetler, a member of St. Paul- Reformation Lutheran Church and a lesbian who left the ELCA roster at her bishop‚Äôs request when he learned she was in a committed relationship. Lynne passed the stole to Anita with the request that she pass it to the next ordained from the Extraordinary Candidacy Project (now, Extraordinary Lutheran Ministries) roster. Anita passed the stole to the Rev. Sharon Stalkfleet when Sharon was ordained a month later. Sharon held onto the stole, presenting it in 2004 to the Rev. Jay Wiesner. Jay presented it to the Rev. Erik Christensen in 2006. A month later, it was passed to the Rev. Dr. Megan Rohrer, then in 2007 to the Rev. Dr. Dawn Roginski, then to the Rev. Jen Rude ordained at Resurrection Lutheran Church in Chicago who kept the stole for two months before passing it along to the Rev. Jen Nagel. A few months later, it was passed to the Rev. Lionel Ketola, who then passed it to the Rev. Lura Groen. At ELM's annual retreat for pastors in 2011, celebrating the reception of ELM pastor's onto the roster of the ELCA and the Proclaim group for publicly recognized GLBTQ rostered leaders and seminarians, a service used the traveling stole to symbolize the changed church policy and to create healing for the pastors ordained extraordinarily. The Rev. Dr. Megan Rohrer wore the stole in an ‚Äúl am Beautiful‚Äù video for Cosmo Magazine, then passed it on the Rev. Noah Hepler on The Netflix show Queer Eye (Season 5, Episode 1).

The film stars Scott Glenn and Toshir≈ç Mifune, and features several aikido- based action scenes choreographed by Steven Seagal, prior to the start of his own film career. Plot A katana, one of a pair known as \\"The Equals\\", was an heirloom of the Yoshida family, passed down through the generations before being lost during World War II. It was finally tracked down and recovered in California by the youngest son Toshio. Hoping to return its rightful owner, his father Toru, Toshio hires down-on-his luck prize fighter Rick Murphy to smuggle the sword back to Japan. Upon his arrival, Murphy learns that the sword is a fake and himself a decoy, intended to ward off potential thieves. Aggravated that he has been used as a decoy, he is faced with the prospect of being killed by Toru's brother, a well-connected kuromaku (or \\"black curtain\\" in English, a fixer who works behind the scenes for Yakuza) named Hideo. Instead, he is advised to infiltrate Yoshida's martial arts school and obtain the sword. He does so, yet finds himself being drawn into the ways of Japanese etiquette and tradition to the point where he returns the sword to Toru himself after having the perfect opportunity to escape with it. Murphy then humbly asks Toru if he can be forgiven and taken back in because he wants to learn the ways of Bushido. Toru agrees, but only if Murphy follows Toru's conditions. Murphy continues to bumble his way through life at Toru's school until, after a treacherous and almost fatal attempt by one of the higher members of the school to steal the sword, he leaves and is found in a hotel in Kyoto by Akiko, Toru's only daughter. Finding romance, they go out to see the sights and sounds of the city, including watching a Shinto ceremony. During the hub-bub of the crowded parade, Murphy and Akiko get separated and Hideo's henchmen kidnap her and deliver her to her uncle. Toru, laden with ancient weaponry, ventures out to Hideo's industrial complex where he is shot and wounded by Hideo's bodyguard Ando. Ando is slain by Hideo for this, and Murphy ‚Äì who has joined him in his quest ‚Äì opts to fight Hideo to defend his sensei. Murphy manages to defeat Hideo and win the day.

The Kyoto International Conference Center was used as the location of Hideo's headquarters. Alternate version A re-edited version of the film entitled Sword of the Ninja was created for television. In this version, about ten minutes of footage are cut, some of the graphic violence of the original version is removed, and \\"fades\\" are added to make room for commercial breaks. Reception Critic Dennis Schwartz gave the film a C+ grade, calling it a \\"pointless\\", \\"low-level Chuck Norris flick\\". He enjoyed Frankenheimer's directing and Mifune's performance, questioning why they chose to make such a film. Time Out wrote that the \\"elaborate combat will please fans\\", but that The Yakuza was a much better film in the genre. Janet Maslin for The New York Times was unimpressed with the film's \\"regrettably vicious streak\\" and wrote that the film had unused potential. However, she praised Toshir≈ç Mifune's performance as adding weight to the film. Adam Lippe, writing for Examiner.com, had a better opinion of the film, calling it \\"grimy, off- putting, and just right for the moment.\\" References External links  * 1980s action films 1982 films American action films American films English-language films Films directed by John Frankenheimer Films shot in Los Angeles Films shot in Kyoto Prefecture Films set in Kyoto Films set in 1945 Films set in 1982 Japanese- language films Films scored by Jerry Goldsmith CBS Theatrical Films films Films with screenplays by John Sayles Embassy Pictures films Japan in non-Japanese culture Yakuza films ","title":"The Challenge (1982 film)"},{"id":"16083784","text":"TJ Fisher is a Southern author,Publishers Weekly, \\"The Year in Awards,\\" 31 December 2007, Benjamin Franklin Awards, Best First Book (nonfiction) Orl√©ans Embrace with the Secret Gardens of the Vieux Carr√©; Best New Voice (Nonfiction) Orl√©ans Embrace with The Secret Gardens of the Vieux Carr√©. documentarist and social critic who lives in New Orleans, Louisiana and Palm Beach, Florida.

Precedent to the award, all defendants and their attorneys were precluded from speaking or participating in the damages hearing inquisition. Legal analysts cited U.S. Constitution and Due Process violations. Fisher was unable to post a $33.3-million-dollar supersedeas bond to stay execution of McCrary's default judgment against her during the pendency of the appeal.

The ridge has eight well defined summits, three of which have names: Sheep's Heaven Mountain, , the ridge's southern prominatory; Beoadic Mountain, the ridge high point, just north of Sheep's Heaven; and East Mountain, located at the top of the former ski area at the center of the ridge. A northern summit, , is shown as \\"Brodie Mountain\\" on maps that predate the Brodie Mountain ski area. Geography The Taconic Skyline Trail formerly ran north over Sheep's Heaven Mountain to the Brodie Mountain ski area at the East Mountain summit, but has been discontinued on Brodie Mountain, although the former route, now an unsanctioned ATV trail, still exists. An older route once traversed the entire ridge from south to north, but the northern sections fell into disuse in the 1970s and are totally obscured. The former ski area, located on the east-center portion of the ridge, was purchased for 2.6 million dollars in 2004 by a developer; much of it is slated for condominium development. The Brodie Mountain ridge is located in the towns of Hancock, Lanesborough, New Ashford, and Williamstown, Massachusetts. It is bordered to the northeast by Mount Greylock, to the south by Potter Mountain; and to the west by Misery Mountain. The southwest side drains into Kinderhook Creek, thence the Hudson River and Long Island Sound; the northwest side into the West Branch of the Green River, the Green River, the Hoosic River, thence the Hudson River; the northeast side into East Brook, thence Green River; and the southeast side into Town Brook, the West Branch of the Housatonic River, thence the Housatonic River and Long Island Sound. The mountain is forested in northern hardwood species; its geology is Ordovician phyllite. Wind Farm The Berkshire Wind Power Project, the largest operating wind farm in Massachusetts, began operation on the southern portion of the Brodie Mountain ridge in 2011. The facility consists of ten turbines capable of producing a total of fifteen megawatts of electricity, and is owned by the Berkshire Wind Power Cooperative Corporation, a non-profit, public power corporation.
