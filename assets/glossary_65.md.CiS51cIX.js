The Riđani () was a tribe in Old Herzegovina (later annexed by the Principality of Montenegro) that existed since the late medieval period, first mentioned in 1335, until the mid-18th century. The Krivošije, Grahovo and Rudine brotherhoods claim descent from the Riđani.  Pre-Ottoman history  The first mention of Riđani was in a 1335 document. The territory where they lived was between the Zeta river in the Onogošt župa (county) and Ledenice near Risan and Klobuk. In the first half of the 15th century, the Riđani tribe populated the territory between the mountains of Konavle, Dračevica and Vrsinje (modern day Zupci). At that time, this territory belonged to the Duchy of Saint Sava. Their knez was Radivoj Sladojević. According to some legends, they populated the territory of Krivošije and Cerovo Ždrijelo near Grahovo. The earliest Ragusan sources about this tribe are early 15th-century records in which they are mentioned as Vlachi Rigiani. In 1429, the Ragusan senate invited them to take their livestock to Konavle mountains during the summer, for a certain fee. Riđani had their own knez in 1435. In a 1438 document, Đukan Milojević was mentioned as knez of Riđani. Riđani frequently invaded the region of Konavle and robbed it, so Ragusans complained to Stjepan Vukčić Kosača. A 1441 document tells of their attacks and robbing of Ragusan merchant convoys. One 1451 document indicate that Riđani populated the region between Risan, Kotor and Vrsinje. According to traditional belief, Riđani had been trying to migrate from their mountainous homeland to fertile lands of Grahovo (near Nikšić), facing resistance of its native people. Eventually, Riđani became one of three strong tribes in the region of Onogošt, besides Drobnjaci and Lužani. All three of them were governed by one ban. Ugren was among the most notable bans.  Ottoman era  After the Ottomans captured the region populated by Riđani it became known as the nahija of Riđani, with its seat in Grahovo. An Ottoman governor administered the nahija, while the tribe was governed by its vojvoda (of Drobnjaci and Banjani) or by their knez (of Riđani). In 1466 the subaşi of Riđani was Širmerd. In 1469 Riđani were one of the \\"Vlach\\" tribes that participated in the kidnapping of a young male and female population of Konavle and Herzegovina. They sold them to Ottoman subaşi, vojvodas, martoloses and Muslims in Trebinje who sold them as slaves. Riđani were registered in the first Ottoman defter (tax registry) of the Sanjak of Herzegovina, as part of the Novi kadiluk (modern-day Herceg Novi). One of the knezes of Riđani in the Ottoman period was Sinan, who was also chieftain of Banjani, and son-in-law of Ali Paša Hercegović. In 1597, envoys of Serbian Patriarch Jovan Kantul and vojvoda Grdan, chieftain of Nikšići and Riđani tribes, reported to Pope Clement VIII about the possibilities to raise an anti-Ottoman rebellion. In 1649 the tribes of Nikšići, Riđani and Drobnjaci rebelled against the Ottomans and captured Risan, handing it over to the Republic of Venice. In mid-17th century their chieftain was Radul of Riđani. Riđani distinguished themselves in the struggle against the Ottomans, particularly during the late 17th-century Morean War. Riđani slowly fled west to Herzegovina, especially after the Ottomans established Nikšić as their stronghold, while remnants of Riđani with newly immigrated Uskoks formed three tribal societies: Krivošije, Grahovo and Nikšićke Rudine.  Montenegro and legacy  In 1749 the Montenegrin tribal assembly (zbor), which was the supreme governing body of Montenegro, decided to accept Riđani as their own. After this event, the tribe ceased to exist, while its name is preserved in toponyms and folk tradition. Some modern-day Serbo-Croatian families (including the Merćep family) descends from the Riđani tribe. During the 19th century, some families of the Kuči tribe believed that they descend from Riđani. The fact that Riđani and Kuči had the same slava (patron saint feast day) was used as an argument for such position. This belief is refuted by some authors who believed that this belief was result of the attempt to tie Riđani tribe to Kuči. Riđani are mentioned in numerous songs of Serbian epic poetry. Anthropology Rhizon (marked 1) was one of three Illyrian fortresses on the hills overlooking Bay of Kotor. In historical sources Riđani were referred to as \\"Vlachs\\"; Serbian scholars emphasize that they were referred to as Vlachs not because they were of Vlach (Romance-speaking) origin, but due to their occupation, as herdsmen (\\"Vlachs\\" being a derogatory term). Some Serbian scholars refer to the Riđani as an \\"old Serbian tribe\\". Maja Parović Pešikan hypothesized that Riđani were originally from Rhizon (originally an Illyrian settlement near Risan). The oldest brotherhood of Riđani were the noble Riđanići. The larger brotherhoods of Riđani include the Krivošije.

Description The plant is small to medium size. Fresh green to brownish green when found in the muddy bottom. Transparent and richly branched. Plants are entirely ecorticate (i.e., without cortex). The main axis slender up to 1200 µm in diameter. The stipulodes (single cell organs present in one or more rows in the branchlets of Chara) occur in a single whorl and are well developed. Branchlets 6-10 in a whorl, straight and occasionally incurved; segments 4-6, the last one often reduced, with 1 or more small end cells forming tiny terminal corona. Bracteoles (leaf- like structures) slightly longer than the oospore. The species is monoecious and richly fertile oogonia are situated above the antheridia. The oospore is dark brown or black. Distribution The species have a cosmopolitan distribution between 65 deg. N and 35 deg. S. Ch. braunii has been placed on a “red” list of endangered algae in Poland in the category “indeterminate”, but probably simply because of poor investigation of the species in Poland.

Location Gallen Abbey is located on the south bank of the Brosna, about 1 km south of Ferbane. History Gallen Abbey was established in 492 by Saint Canoc, a son of Saint Brecan. Saint Canoc settled near modern-day Ferbane in 492, which at the time was in the territory of Delbhna Eathra. The Abbey was damaged in the 820s when Tnúthgal mac Donngaile, the king of Munster, invaded Delbna Eathra, the area in which the abbey was located. The monastery was later restored by Welsh monks, who turned it into a school. In 949, Cellachán Caisil, another king of Munster, invaded Delbna Eathra and nearly demolished the abbey. A stone church on the abbey grounds was destroyed in the attack, and today the oldest building at the site of the former abbey dates to the 11th century. Despite much resistance, the Irish Church was reformed in the 12th century, allowing Papal authority to be more fully exercised in Ireland. Religious orders were especially affected, as The Lateran Council of 1159 had urged the clergy of Cathedrals and Collegiate Churches to adopt some form of regular life, in particular the Rule of St. Augustine. Irish monks, including those at the Gallen Abbey, reluctantly conformed to the Catholic Church's demands, and gradually abandoned the Irish Church's Celtic traditions. Around this time, the Mac Coughlan family rose to power in the region that surrounded the abbey. The heads of the family usually combined the offices of ruler of the clan and Prior of the monastery. The Mac Coughlan family would continue to remain prominent in local politics until the 18th century. Despite the proclamation of the Plantations of Laois and Offaly in 1556, fierce guerilla warfare against British troops by the local citizens stalled English settlement of the area for fifty years. In 1571, George Bouchyer was to be granted control over the lands around the abbey. After several disputes over the ownership of the land, Sir Gerard Moore was granted the land in 1612 for an annual rent of £3-12-2. These lands consisted of the church, a cemetery, five cottages and two gardens in the town of Gallen, forty acres of farmland, and thirty acres of pastures and forests. The last family to own the abbey lands were the Armstrongs – a family of Scottish origin who had come to the region before 1745. In 1841, Andrew Armstrong was created a baronet, and it was from his grandson, Sir Andrew Harvey Armstrong, that the Sisters of Saint Joseph of Cluny purchased the property in 1923.

Early life  Jeanette was born in Florida, to parents who had emigrated from Colombia. When she was six, her parents divorced. Jeanette was raised Roman Catholic and attended South Miami High School. She met her future husband, Marco Rubio, at a neighborhood party when she was 17 and he was 19. After graduating from high school, she attended Miami Dade College. Before her marriage, she worked as a bank teller. In 1997, she became a member of the Miami Dolphins Cheerleaders. Her sister, Adriana Dousdebes, was also a cheerleader for the Dolphins. Jeanette was featured in the Miami Dolphins Cheerleaders' first swimsuit calendar. It was during her time as a cheerleader that Jeanette Dousdebes and Marco Rubio, who were only slightly acquainted in high school, met again and began to date. When the Rubios were first married, she enrolled in a course of study in fashion design at International Fine Arts College, but did not complete her studies, devoting herself, instead, to being a full-time mother of four children. Rubio has told the press that mothering four small children while married to a politician is very much \\"like being a single mom.\\" During her husband's service in the Florida legislature, Rubio lived with the children near Miami, traveling to Tallahassee to be with her husband as often as she could.  Political involvement  During the race for speaker, she was enlisted by her husband to manage the political action committees he used to support his travel and consultants, a decision he later described as a \\"disaster\\" as it resulted in confusion on financial transactions related to travel and expenses, due to \\"inexperience, sloppiness and a blur of paperwork\\" according to a report by the Tampa Bay Times. Unlike many spouses of presidential candidates, Rubio did not make campaign speeches. Rubio's campaign spotlighted her career as a Dolphins cheerleader in a television ad broadcast shortly before the Iowa caucuses, the New Hampshire primary, and the NFL playoffs. The Washington Post reported that Rubio is a part-time employee of the Norman Braman Family 2011 Charitable Foundation, which is also a financial backer of her husband Marco Rubio, and likely to commit as much as 10 million to pro-Rubio PACs. Charitable work Rubio volunteers for an organization called Kristi's House, which serves youth in the Miami area who have been abused or involved in human trafficking.  Personal life  Florida House Speaker Rubio, Miami, officially sworn into office by Judge R. Fred Lewis, with Jeanette and the three oldest children at his side, in 2006 The Rubios live in West Miami, Florida, close to Jeanette's three sisters. The Rubios had a Catholic wedding in 1998 at the Church of the Little Flower in Coral Gables, Florida and have four children: Daniella, Amanda, Dominick, and Anthony. Rubio and her family regularly attend both Roman Catholic Mass at Church of the Little Flower and Protestant worship services at Christ Fellowship, an Evangelical megachurch aligned with the Southern Baptist Convention. She hosts a weekly Bible study class in her home. Her three younger children attend a private Protestant Christian school while the eldest attends a Catholic high school.

Hilldale established its own parish council on 1 April 1999, having previously been a ward of Wrightington civil parish. Geography Hilldale is located in rural West Lancashire and is bordered by Bispham and Lathom to the west, Parbold to the south and Wrightington to the east; to the north are Mawdesley and Heskin in the borough of Chorley. The boundary with Lathom is formed by the River Douglas. The civil parish includes the hamlet of Andertons Mill, situated northeast of Hill Dale village. Hilldale is about southwest of Preston, the administrative centre of Lancashire, and northwest of London.

Of the 437 residents aged between 16 and 74, a total of 289 were regarded as economically active, with five being unemployed. Landmarks Hilldale has several listed buildings that are recorded on the National Heritage List for England, including Fairhurst Hall, an 18th-century brick house incorporating some older 16th century remains, a medieval stone cross base, and other farmhouses and farm buildings. In addition, West Lancashire Borough Council publishes its own \\"list of locally important buildings\\", which features a large brick villa on Robin Lane divided into two dwellings. There are two designated conservation areas that lie partially within Hilldale: the Lancaster Lane conservation area is largely in Parbold but extends into the southern part of Hilldale and includes the aforementioned Fairhurst Hall, while the Maltkiln Lane/Chorley Road conservation area straddles the boundary with Bispham. Hunters Hill, a former quarry to the east of Hill Dale village, has been converted into a countryside park and is maintained by the Borough Council. Transport There are no main roads in Hilldale; the B5246 road passes through the southern part of the parish, running southeast from Mere Brow to Parbold, where it terminates at its junction with the A5209 about to the south. The nearest motorway link is junction 27 of the M6, about to the southeast at Wrightington. Parbold railway station is located about to the south and provides services to Manchester (via Wigan) and Southport. Religious sites Parbold Evangelical Church The only place of worship within Hilldale is Parbold Evangelical Church on Chorley Road, which holds a morning and evening service every Sunday. The area of Hilldale is served by the Anglican parish churches of Christ Church in Parbold, and St James the Great Church in Wrightington.

Biography The main source for Shāriyah's life is the tenth-century Kitāb al-Aghānī of Abū ’l-Faraj al-Iṣfahānī.al-Iṣfahīnī, Abu l-Faraj, Kitāb al-aghānī, Dār al-Fikr, 21 parts and Index in 9 vols., equivalent to the edition Kairo 1322/1905–5. Shāriya seems to have been an illegitimate daughter of a Qurashī and was sold into slavery by a woman claiming to be her mother to the ‘Abbasid prince Ibrahīm ibn al-Mahdī, son of third Abbasid caliph, al-Mahdi (r. 775–785), and half-brother of the fifth caliph Harun al-Rashid (r. 786–809) and the poet and princess ‘Ulayya bint al- Mahdī. There was later some dispute about the sale, as Shāriyah's alleged mother tried to claim that she was freeborn, in an effort to cash in on her daughter's success; but Ibrahīm retained ownership of Shāriya until she was manumitted during the reign either of al-Muʿtaṣim (r. 833–842) or al-Wathiq. Her greatest success was at al-Wathiq's court.Agnes Imhof, \\"Traditio vel Aemulatio?

Works The most important attestation of Shāriyah's poetry and skill comes in the form of an account of a musical contest between her and her older rival ‘Arīb al-Ma’mūnīya (and their respective troupes of singing-girls) in Sāmarrā’, reported in Abū ’l-Faraj al-Iṣfahānī's Kitāb al-Aghānī. It probably took place in the reign of al-Mutawakkil (r. 847–861). The description is also an important attestation of the activities of female musicians in ‘Abbasid courtly life.Matthew S.

Montgomery (Leuven: Peeters, 2004), pp. 61–81 (p. 64). According to the account, \\"at that time, the refined and well-bred people were divided into two communities – one supported ‘Arīb (‘Arībiyya) and the other backed Shāriya (Shārawiyya).

The movement aspired to break the stereotypes and promote diversity around underrepresented groups, particularly (Women, POC, and LGBTQ+) within the engineering industry. Its primary tactic is the use of the hashtag #ILookLikeAnEngineer on social media sites such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, along with pictures of engineers or engineering students. The I Look Like an Engineer movement has sparked other similar movements that also seek to break stereotypes in their industry, such as I Look Like a Surgeon, I Look like a Professor and I Look Like a Civil Engineer.  OneLogin campaign  In the summer of 2015 OneLogin, a software company in San Francisco created a recruitment campaign aimed at attracting engineers to their home office in San Francisco. Four employees were invited to participate, including Anchalee. The ads were placed in the BART public transit stations and showed several OneLogin engineers sharing their experience working for the company. The ad featuring Anchalee went viral on several social media sites. A week after the launch of the campaign went viral, OneLogin posted an article on their blog that talked about the importance of diversity, inclusion, and innovation.  Movement beginnings  The OneLogin recruitment ad featuring Isis Anchalee went viral as her particular ad received comments stating the belief that she was a model and not an actual engineer. Anchalee took to social media where she posted a picture of herself holding a piece of paper describing her job and a caption with the hashtag, #ILookLikeanEngineer. In her post she stated her belief that it is important to raise awareness in tech diversity and break the stereotypes of what an engineer should look like. Her post started the hashtag trend and the hashtag was used 86,000 times by August 7, 2015. The hashtag has been used in approximately 50 countries. The hashtag is mainly used by women and LGBTQ engineers. Subsequently, Anchalee put up a now-defunct webpage to establish a safe platform for individuals to share their experiences related to diversity issues within tech fields.  Support  In an effort to make a lasting impact, Michelle Glauser (the spouse of Anchalee co-worker) began a fundraising campaign using Indiegogo to create billboards with pictures that people had shared on social media using the hashtag #ILookLikeanEngineer. The proceeds were used to put up more billboards to further the I Look Like an Engineer campaign and excess proceeds were used to fund organizations that teach programming to minorities. The fundraiser’s goal was to raise $3,500. The campaigned ended on September 5, 2015 with $47,285 raised. Concurrently, an #ILookLikeanEngineer community gathering organized by Michelle Glauser through Eventbrite as part of efforts to continue further the movement was hosted on August 13, 2015 in San Francisco, CA. During the gathering, photographers collected portraits of willing participants for the billboards and as an effort to document the event. The event was sponsored by Segment, Rackspace, OneLogin, and HackBright Academy. The event included networking, discussions and a Q&A; panel which included Isis Wenger, Alicia Morga, Wayne Sutton, Erica Baker, Leslie Miley, and Dom DeGuzman.  Significance  The struggles that women face in the field of engineering have a long-documented history. In the postwar era, female engineering students found themselves in a mixture of conflicting and positive situations that shaped not only their professional experiences but the field itself. Women faced backlash from not just male students and professors who objectified and viewed female engineers as potential girlfriends instead of fellow students, but also from women faculty or older female students who demanded that younger women endured the same struggles they did. The campus and corporate climate did not change until the mid-1970s when companies began to face civil rights pressure to be more inclusive of female engineers. However, even with these radical changes women continued to experience subtle and overt forms of discrimination in the workplace. During the 1970s, organizations like the Society of Women Engineers (founded in 1952) among others provided women with support and guidance both on college campuses and in the corporate world. Recognizing the challenges that women faced and continue to face in male-dominated fields raises awareness about the importance of diversity and intersectionality in the field of engineering and other tech fields. Social movements are taking place in online spaces more frequently as the community of users tends to be wider and more diverse. It is here where users can use their own personal experiences and public outcry to start global dialogues that can enact change.

Jacobus Schoemaker Doyer, or Schoenmaker Doijer (24 June 1792 in Krefeld - 9 June 1867 in Zutphen) was a Dutch painter, primarily of genre and historical scenes. Biography He was the son of a pastor. His brother Hendrik (1791-1866) became a publisher in Zwolle, where their parents moved when they were still very young.Brief biography @ Geschiedenis der Vaderlandsche Schilderkunst. There, he became close friends with the future Prime Minister Johan Rudolph Thorbecke, who stayed at their home in 1812 while his parents were away on family business. In 1814, he moved to Amsterdam and became a student of Mattheus Ignatius van Bree. Later, he worked with Jurriaan Andriessen, a decorative painter. He continued his studies in Antwerp, then established himself in Amsterdam. In 1823, he spent some time in Kassel and Dresden, studying Italian statuary. After 1829, he became a lecturer at the Koninklijke Academie voor Beeldende Kunsten, where his students included Christoffel Bisschop and Jacques Carabain. Profile at the Rijksbureau voor Kunsthistorische Documentatie website. In 1834, he created what are, perhaps, his most familiar works; a set of canvases honoring Jan van Speyk, a Dutch navy lieutenant who blew up his ship and himself, rather than surrender it to Belgian forces. Shortly after, on the recommendation of his friend, Thorbecke, he received a commission to produce a painting depicting the \\"Vrijwillige Jagers\\", a volunteer unit from Leiden University that distinguished itself during the Ten Days' Campaign against Belgian revolutionaries.

The fight took place on November 27, 2015 at Esprit Arena, Düsseldorf, Nordrhein- Westfalen, Germany. Fury was declared the winner by unanimous decision. This ended Klitschko's reign of nearly 10 years, the second longest in heavyweight history. Klitschko was entitled to a rematch per the fight contract. Despite this, Fury was stripped of the IBF heavyweight title for agreeing to the rematch instead of facing the IBF mandatory challenger, Vyacheslav Glazkov. Background In 2013, after he had defeated both Kevin Johnson and Steve Cunningham in world title eliminator fights, Tyson Fury repeated that he wanted to fight Wladimir Klitschko because he was the Number 1 in the division. He had previously called him out during video interviews, but believed that the Ukrainian would retire before facing him. Fury could have fought Kubrat Pulev for the mandatory slot to fight Klitschko in mid-2013, but chose to set up an all English showdown with David Haye because \\"it was a far bigger fight.\\" After originally being scheduled for 28 September 2013, Haye pulled out a week before the fight with a cut above his eye that he said happened during sparring. After the fight was rescheduled for 8 February 2014, Haye pulled out for a second time after he underwent surgery on his shoulder. However, many people including Fury believed that Haye, who had already pulled out of a fight with Manuel Charr before Fury, had perhaps lost some of his passion for the sport and didn't want to fight because he feared losing, and was unnerved by Fury's attempts to sell the fight with his trash talk. Haye also reportedly said that he wasn't going to give Fury a pay day, a decision that would later come back to haunt him when he eventually made his return to boxing. After Fury defeated Klitschko, he stated that he would never give Haye the chance to fight him again after he let him down twice and wasted his time and money. After nearly a year out of the ring as a result of the Haye saga, Fury knocked out Joey Abell in February 2014 and was then left to face Dereck Chisora for a second time, in his third world title eliminator bout. He emerged comfortably as the winner, with Chisora retiring from the fight after the tenth round. Fury then defeated Christian Hammer in February 2015, whilst maintaining that he wanted to fight Klitschko and even though promoters were now sure that they could make the fight happen, Fury himself still believed that it was unlikely to be made. Meanwhile, Klitschko had fought off several challengers to retain his world titles since his own victory over David Haye in 2011, which saw him win the WBA Super title, his fourth heavyweight belt out of the available five. His best victory since then had come over the then unbeaten Alexander Povetkin in 2013. Klitschko had been champion since he won the IBF and IBO belts for beating Chris Byrd in 2006. After defeating Bryant Jennings in April 2015, Klitschko acknowledged his next opponent should be Fury, saying that, \\"I believe that the fight with Tyson Fury will look different to this one because of the size difference – Fury is taller than me. He is definitely the guy who is ambitious and I think it is going to be exciting. I think that he is going to engage in the fight. There was not much engagement through Jennings today but I think the Fury fight will be exciting and I’m looking forward to it.\\" After the fight was finally announced in July 2015 and scheduled originally for 24 October, Fury said, ‘The heavyweight division has been dull for over a decade, I’m going to shake it up and bring back the sparkle.’ The late Emanuel Steward, who had been Klitschko's trainer up until his death in 2012 and had also worked with Fury, had described Fury as \\"the next dominant heavyweight champion\\" and \\"the heir to Klitschko's throne.\\" The 39 year old Klitschko would go into the fight with a record of 64-3 and unbeaten in 11 years since his defeat by Lamon Brewster in 2004, while the 27 year old Fury was unbeaten with a record of 24-0. Build-up The first press conference for the fight was held in Düsseldorf towards the end of July 2015, and Fury showed that despite this being the biggest fight of his career, his pre fight tactics wouldn't change. After Klitschko said that the fight was \\"nothing personal but business\\", Fury stated that it was personal because fighting is personal. He went on to launch a rant at Klitschko, calling him \\"boring\\" both in and out of the ring, and that he wanted to rid him and his jab and grab style out of the division. He also said that Klitschko, at 39 years of age, must be past his best and that he is no better than the great champions of the past, all of whom showed decline from Klitschko's age. He rounded off with a comical one liner when he said the one thing I do know for sure is, \\"this klit is getting licked.\\" Klitschko himself drew comparisons between Fury and David Haye, saying that like Haye, Fury would be undergoing therapy when he fought him and after he had beaten him Fury would learn a lesson and become a better person. Fury said that he was nothing like Haye and shouldn't be compared to him, because \\"I'm not an idiot\\" or a \\"fraud\\", he also branded Haye a \\"bitch\\" and a \\"pussy\\" because he twice pulled out of fights against him. In September, a second press conference was held in London and Fury upped the antics again, dressing up as the superhero Batman and flooring a villain in front of Klitschko in an attempt to unnerve him. Fury told Klitschko that he had dominated a weak era for heavyweights and that he had \\"reigned supreme over a load of bums\\". Fury also said that Klitschko could play the nice guy and the role model to try to get his television deals and sponsorships, \\"but quite frankly I don't care about all that stuff, all I care about is winning.\\" Klitschko continued his talk of therapy, saying that Fury needed help, before telling Fury he was a clown and that he would get him a job at a circus after the fight. Fury continued the mind games by getting up from his chair and kicking it aside, challenging Klitschko to call him a clown again and shouting that he would fight him now and appeared to have to be restrained. Despite all this, there was still a handshake from the pair after an intense face off, with both men wishing each other good luck. Fury later stated that he didn't actually mind being called a clown, and that his act was all part of the entertainment that boxing needed. The pair then met for a face to face interview 'The Gloves Are Off', and Klitschko stated that Fury tries to be a bully because inside he is weak and insecure, but Fury retorted that it was Klitschko who was insecure about Fury's unpredictable behaviour because he's a \\"control freak\\", who doesn't like it when he isn't in control of his opponent. Fury stated that Klitschko was the man standing in front of his entire future and he couldn't let the opportunity slip. He said, \\"the difference [between me and Klitschko] is that he's been made to look like that, everything he does is manufactured. Everything that I do is natural, off the cuff. Nobody tells me what to do, nobody sticks a key in my back and turns it. I do it myself. I wake up in the morning and do what I want to do, because I'm my own man. And when it comes to that night, I think the world will change because they'll have the most charismatic, the most colourful, the most controversial champion since Muhammad Ali. And that's what the world's been waiting for. If I'm not the man to fill those boots, they'll be waiting a hell of a lot time more. Because all I see is robots, people being turned and told what to say. So the world needs me to change the landscape of the division.\\" Fury also explained an infamous sauna incident at a Klitschko training camp in Austria in 2010, (the first time the pair had met) where according to Fury, \\"there were about 10 guys in the sauna, everyone started popping off around us and it came down to just me and Wlad in the sauna. In my mind I was mentally in a competition with him, he can deny it if he wants but I was prepared to die in that sauna, I stayed in for about 40 minutes, and he got out first.\\" Klitschko claimed that he could remember the training camp and the sauna but not any mental competition, after Fury described the incident as a \\"mental victory.\\" Klitschko said that he didn't know what Fury was talking about and that Fury, \\"built this in his own world and it didn't exist\\", but Fury replied \\"well you can say you don't know what I'm talking about, but we both know it did exist.\\" When discussing each other's boxing skills, Klitschko said that he thought Fury was a good counter puncher and moved well for a tall man. Meanwhile, Fury stated that although Klitschko had perfected a safe style and had immense power in right hand and left hook, he didn't know what he was in for because he was facing an opponent that was not only bigger than him but quicker, stating that he himself was blessed with unnatural speed and movement for a man of his size. When asked the question as to why the behaviour was so different to that of the press conference, Klitschko said \\"I'm not acting differently, Tyson acts differently because he's bipolar.\\" Fury then replied, \\"maybe I am bipolar, who knows, but there's a time for play and there's a time for seriousness. Wladimir is not stupid, he knows I'm serious.\\" Fury once again mentioned Klitschko's age, telling him that he couldn't compete with a younger athlete, while Klitschko responded by saying that \\"age is just a number\\". Fury actually agreed, but still stated that at 40 years old, you can't do what you could do at 25. When asked whether he had been studying Klitschko's previous defeats, Fury said that he hadn't been because those losses were a long time ago and Klitschko had matured as a fighter since then. Fury said that unlike Klitschko's previous opponents, he genuinely believed he could beat him. Despite previously telling Klitschko he was going to knock him out, Fury revealed that (unlike David Haye in his opinion) he wasn't looking for that one punch and wasn't going to make the same mistake, and told Klitschko to expect something new. Also, unlike Haye, Fury shook Klitschko's hand when it was offered. Fury had also said to Klitschko that all he wanted him to do was \\"turn up and fight\\", to which Klitschko replied \\"I will, I'm looking forward to it\\" but Fury still believed that he may pull out. Ironically, within a couple of days Klitschko did pull out with a calf injury, and the fight on 24 October was cancelled and rescheduled for 28 November. At the public training workout in Düsseldorf, Fury sang a version of \\"The Wind Beneath My Wings\\" to Klitschko and his team, which Klitschko said he enjoyed. However, the Fury camp were not happy with the gloves the Klitschko camp had chosen, and threatened to pull out of the fight if it was not sorted out. An inspection of the ring also ended with layers of padding foam being removed from under the canvas. Fight details and aftermath On fight night, a capacity crowd of 55,000 filled the Esprit Arena in Düsseldorf. Klitschko was the clear favourite with the bookies, with Fury the outsider at around 4/1. From the off, Fury kept constantly on the move boxing off the back foot and throwing many feints, beating Klitschko to the punch from range whilst not letting Klitschko set his feet to land his own shots. Klitschko himself was used to beating fighters that were usually smaller than himself from range and then clinching them on the inside. However, Klitschko was unable to adjust his style and continued to clinch Fury on the inside whilst Fury still attempted to punch, this meant that Fury was outpunching and outlanding Klitschko in all areas. Despite the fact that it was usually Klitschko on the offensive coming towards him, Fury made himself difficult to be hit with his head and body movement, also switching to a southpaw stance at times to confuse Klitschko. Due to both fighters style and defensive skill, there were very few punch combinations landed during the fight, when one punch was landed the next punches were nearly always evaded or missed. Some of the rounds were close but were decisive in Fury's favor due to his ring generalship and being more active than Klitschko who appeared flustered, this gave Fury what was more or less an insurmountable lead going into the later rounds. From the start Fury's tactics appeared to be to try and nullify Klitschko and make him feel uncomfortable, even putting both his hands behind his back several times during the fight. As a result of this, Klitschko was noticeably gun shy during the fight, particularly with his right hand, seemingly wary of being countered. Fury landed the best punch of the fight in the ninth round, after the pair had been holding Klitschko turned his back momentarily and when he turned to face Fury again he was caught with a left hook to the face, with Klitschko just managing to avoid some follow up punches. In the eleventh round, Fury landed another two big left hooks and Klitschko appeared to be hurt before referee Tony Weeks docked a point for a third punch that was behind the head having already warned Fury for rabbit punching, although again it was partly Klitschko's fault for turning his back as he had done several times throughout the fight, this meant the round was scored even instead of in Fury's favour. In the twelfth and final round Klitschko finally appeared to throw caution to the wind to land some punches of his own, but Fury did the same and traded punches with him and although most scored the final round for Klitschko, when the bell sounded most people felt that Fury had done more than enough. Two judges scored the bout 115–112, while the other scored it 116–111, all in favour of Fury which meant that he won by unanimous decision and became the new unified heavyweight champion. This put paid to any fears that there could be a controversial, disputed or an unfair decision. After the fight Fury apologised to Klitschko for some of his behaviour in the buildup, stating that he just wanted to be confident. Fury then celebrated by singing a version of Aerosmith's \\"I Don't Wanna Miss A Thing\\" to his wife Paris. In the post-fight press conference, Klitschko was asked whether his right hand was injured as he hadn't thrown it very often but he replied, \\"no it wasn't injured, but my right hand is supposed to land after my left, and I couldn't find the right distance to land the shots that I wanted.\\" Fury's trainer and uncle Peter Fury said, \\"this is what we've been working on in the gym for five months, to beat someone like Wladimir Klitschko you have to take boxing to a whole new level.\\" Klitschko congratulated Fury on winning the fight and Fury also gave credit to Klitschko for the shots he did land, saying that they both found each other awkward to land on. He then said \\"tonight was my night and God gave me the victory, so I hope to have many more defences of these titles. And if I could just say one thing, if I could be half as good a champion as Wladimir Klitschko, I'd be very very happy.\\" Broadcasting The fight was broadcast in countries across the world including by RTL in host country Germany, HBO in the United States and Sky Sports Box Office in the United Kingdom, where it saw over 500,000 pay per view buys. Viewing figures on HBO reached 1.714million. Cancelled rematch In December, Klitschko exercised his rematch clause, albeit without the IBF title at stake. This was due to Fury having to fight Klitschko as opposed to the IBF's mandatory challenger Vyacheslav Glazkov. Instead Glazkov fought Charles Martin for the vacant title. After months of negotiation, the Klitschko–Fury rematch was announced on 8 April 2016, with the fight scheduled to take place in the new champion's home town of Manchester at Manchester Arena on 9 July 2016. In the United Kingdom, the fight was to be shown live and exclusively on BoxNation. On 24 June 2016, Tyson Fury announced that the fight would be postponed due to an ankle sprain he received during training. He apologised to his fans and confirmed the fight would be rescheduled for a later date. On 7 July 2016, Fury announced that the rescheduled fight would take place on 29 October 2016 at Manchester Arena. It was confirmed officially on 7 September 2016. On 23 September 2016, Fury again postponed the fight after being declared \\"medically unfit\\". On 12 October Fury vacated the WBA \\"Super\\", WBO and IBO titles, citing problems with depression after testing positive for cocaine. After the fight was cancelled, Klitschko agreed to fight IBF champion Anthony Joshua for the vacant WBA and IBO titles as well as Joshua's IBF title. The pair fought at Wembley Stadium in London on April 29th 2017, with Joshua winning by TKO in the eleventh round. The vacant WBO title was fought for between WBO's number one ranked Joseph Parker and number three ranked Andy Ruiz on 10 December in Auckland New Zealand, with Parker winning by majority decision.

The memorial also honours U-Boat sailors from the Bundeswehr who have been killed in action since. The memorial site is an emblem of Heikendorf.  Monument  The monument was built on the former Möltenorter Schanze (Möltenort Fieldwork) in Heikendorf and dedicated on 8 June 1930. After suffering structural damage, it was rebuilt in 1938. It consists of a 15.3-metre-high pillar, at the top of which sits a 4.8-metre- high eagle (designed by Fritz Schmoll). Extensive rust penetration was discovered in the internal steel supporting structure of the eagle in 2000, rendering renovation work necessary. Since 12 July 2001, the original eagle with its galvanised, copper-coated iron skin has been replaced by a recast bronze version similar to it (designed by the firm Noack from Berlin). The eagle was removed again in March 2012 for necessary reinforcement work after the detection of signs of fatigue in the supporting structure. The planned date of its return – initially scheduled to be six weeks later – was subjected to repeated delays thereafter; eventually, on 25 April 2013, the eagle was able to reassume its position. The U-Boot war badge is affixed to the pillar; until 1945 its position had been occupied by a swastika. This was made unrecognizable by the filling-in of the spaces between its arms – even today, however, it can still be made out behind the badge.  Plaques  In an arched gallery area, the names of fallen German U-Boat men of the German Imperial Navy and the Kriegsmarine, along with those of soldiers who died serving in the German Navy, are displayed on 115 bronze plaques.

Schleh. Miguel Lillo studied at the National School of Tucumán, graduating in 1881, but could not afford to continue formal university studies. Career Lillo was passionately devoted to various scientific studies, especially those pertaining to nature. After his formal education, he continued working as an assistant pharmacist in the Physics and Chemistry laboratories of the National College. By 1883 he had amassed a collection of plants from his local area comprising 700 specimens. He went to the National University of Córdoba for guidance from Federico Kurtz and the brothers, Oscar and Adolfo Döring and from whom he gained an appreciation of classification. In 1888 he published an interesting essay on the plants of Tucumán. Shortly after he was appointed assistant and student of Friedrich Schickendantz, chemist and director of the Municipal Chemical office of Tucumán; a post to which Lillo succeeded in 1892. In 1905 he published ' (Fauna of Tucumán, Birds) containing their discoveries of new species; at that time already he had the largest collection of birds of his province. In 1914 the National University of La Plata awarded Lillo the title of Doctor Honoris Causa. After teaching chemistry and physics in the National School and the Normal school, from 1914 he lectured at the National University of Tucumán. He was appointed director of the Museum of Natural History at the University of Tucumán and member of the National Commission of Argentina flora. In 1918 he retired from teaching, but maintained the honorary position of director of the Museum of Natural History at the University of Tucumán. In December 1930, and shortly before his death, he donated all his property to the National University of Tucumán; this consisted of extensive grounds, a considerable sum of money, an extensive library and his zoological and herbarium collections consisting of more than 20,000 specimens of 6,000 different species. With this donation the National University of Tucumán established the Miguel Lillo Foundation in 1933. Miguel Lillo died in the city of San Miguel de Tucumán on May 4, 1931. Activities Miguel Lillo was an amateur naturalist: extremely shrewd and observant; erudite and gifted with an extraordinary scientific vocation. He specialised in botany, but also pursued other branches of science, including chemistry and zoology. He was dedicated to scientific research alternating with teaching. He made a notable contribution to the knowledge of the trees of Argentina and the botanical family of Compositae. He was also a keen ornithologist, a discipline in which he also became an authority. His interests extended beyond sciences to language, studying both classical literature and indigenous languages. He was a competent phytogeographer. Expeditions undertaken between 1885 and 1916 familiarised him with the province of Tucumán. He also toured much of Argentina, from Buenos Aires to the north, expeditions to the provinces of Córdoba and Santiago del Estero in 1885, to Cuyo between 1890 and 1891, Buenos Aires and Santa Fe from 1891 to 1902, to the province of Salta in 1894 and into Chile in 1895. Other expeditions included Formosa, Chaco and Mesopotamia, Argentina, including Martín García Island.

Biography Family Elisabeth Ann Waldo was born in Tacoma, Washington to Jane Althea Blodgett, a singer trained at the Boston Conservatory of Music, and Benjamin Franklin Waldo, a descendant of Ralph Waldo Emerson. She and her younger sister Janet, who was born slightly over seven months later on February 4, 1919 (died 2016), a film, television and voice actress (best known for work on The Jetsons and Josie and the Pussycats) were raised in Yakima. She married Carl Schaefer Dentzel (March 20, 1913 – August 21, 1980), son of Edward P. Dentzel, a councilman and mayor of Beverly Hills, and Mrs. Emma P. Dentzel, co-founder of the park system for Beverly Hills. He served as director of the Southwest Museum in Los Angeles, and with whom Waldo shared a love of Asian and Native American culture and artifacts. The couple had two sons, Dana and Paul. Early life and career Waldo grew up on her family's ranch at the edge of the Yakama Indian Reservation in Washington state. She started singing at age three and took up violin by age five. Russian-born violinist Jascha Heifetz heard her play and helped her attain a scholarship to the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia where she received her musical education. In 1940, conductor Leopold Stokowski invited Waldo to join the newly formed All-American Youth Orchestra. They toured South America in 1940 and then North America in 1941 before disbanding when the U.S. entered World War II. It was on these tours that Waldo's interest in musical archeology grew and she began collecting pre-Columbian instruments. After the All-American Youth Orchestra, Waldo made her home in Southern California where she played as a first violinist with the Los Angeles Philharmonic for one season. She returned to Latin America as a touring solo performer, playing in Panamá, Costa Rica, Colombia, Peru, Chile, Cuba, and Mexico before taking up residence in Mexico City where she was a regular on the newly networked national radio. While living there, she collaborated frequently with singer Agustín Lara and appeared in the 1945 film Song of Mexico as a violinist. She also struck up a friendship with muralist Diego Rivera with whom she shared an interest in pre- Columbian and Maya music. Rivera suggested that she develop her own system of hieroglyphic musical notation for working with pre-Columbian instruments in order to teach others how to play them. In 1954-55, Waldo played violin for the Peruvian-American soprano Yma Sumac. Sumac's music fused Andean folk songs with Caribbean rhythms, big band jazz and operatic singing, and her elaborate stage show fit the \\"exotic\\" tastes of patrons of venues in Hollywood and Las Vegas, while also meeting the standards of quality to appear in the most prestigious concert halls in North America and Europe. While displaying her talents as a soloist in the orchestra, Waldo regarded her work with Sumac's touring show as part of her research into Latin American music. Working with arrangers like Les Baxter and Billy May, Sumac helped define the music that would become known as exotica. Inspired by her time with Sumac, Waldo returned to Los Angeles and formed an ensemble that used instruments from Native North, South, and Meso-America to play her own original compositions. Recording and later career Waldo was among the first to bring many pre-Columbian instruments into a recording studio for her albums Maracatu (1959), Rites of the Pagan (1960) and Realm of the Incas (1961). Although based on her research in indigenous music, the albums were unlike field recordings of Native American music produced by ethnomusicologists at the time: they were made in the studio using the most advanced high fidelity and stereo recording techniques, and all of the compositions were by Waldo. For these reasons her records would later not be regarded as \\"world music\\" but as \\"new-age music\\" and then \\"exotica\\". Waldo began scoring film soundtracks in the early 1970s. During the 1980s she became interested in the music of China and formed an ensemble that helped introduce Chinese music and dance for the Los Angeles Unified School District. The group toured several times to China as part of a cultural exchange with several Chinese conservatories. While there, Waldo performed her \\"Concierto Indo-Americano\\" with the Xian Symphony Orchestra. In 1987, she founded the New Mission Theatre, a 150-seat venue for use by the Multi-Cultural Music and Art Foundation of Northridge on the north side of Los Angeles.

He was a model for sculptors Auguste Rodin and Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney. He was a member of The Fugitives. Early life Sidney Mttron Hirsch was born on January 3, 1884 in Nashville, Tennessee. His father was a wealthy merchant. He was raised as an Orthodox Jew. Hirsch was educated in public schools in Nashville and attended the Joseph W. Allen College in Carthage, Tennessee. He did not graduate from college. However, his half-sister Rose \\"Goldie\\" Hirsch married James Marshall Frank, a Professor of English at Vanderbilt University. Through his brother-in-law, he became acquainted with The Fugitives. Hirsch joined the United States Navy and served in the Philippines and China for two years. While in the Far East, he took up boxing and studied many forms of mysticism and esoterism, including Kabbalah (where his middle name came from), rosicrucianism, numerology, astrology and etymology. Once off duty, he traveled in Korea and India. Career Hirsch returned to Nashville but soon moved to Paris, France, where he became a model for the sculptor Auguste Rodin. He was introduced to Gertrude Stein and George William Russell, who encouraged him to look at the double meanings of words in literary texts. Meanwhile, he learned to read Latin, Ancient Greek and Hebrew. Additionally, he learned some \\"Babylonian, Syrian, Chaldean, Arabic, Sanskrit, and ancient Egyptian.\\" Hirsch moved to New York City, where he modeled for sculptress Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney. Additionally, Hirsch published short stories and art criticism in literary reviews. He wrote his first play, Potiphar's Wife, based on Potiphar. The play was never performed in New York due to differences between Hirsch and the producers. In April 1912, Hirsch visited Nashville briefly to give a lecture on the Trinity in art at the chapel of the Ward Seminary (now Belmont University). Hirsch returned permanently to Nashville, where he became a playwright and a member of The Fugitives. The group met at his sister's house near the Vanderbilt University campus, where Hirsch lived. Hirsch was elected their first president in 1923. As such, he was the one who started each meeting. Hirsch published The Fire Regained, a play about Greek mythology, in February 1912. It was performed at the May Festival of 1913 organized by the Nashville Art Association, outside The Parthenon in Centennial Park. Meanwhile, the play attracted nationwide attention, from as far as Washington, D.C. and Santa Cruz, California. The play was so successful that the United States Department of State considered organizing a performance at the Acropolis of Athens in Greece. However, the plan was abandoned in the wake of World War I. Hirsch published The Mysteries of Thanatos in 1914, but the play was unsuccessful. His next play, The Passion of Washington Square, received good reviews. It was performed in New York City and Chicago in 1915. Meanwhile, Hirsch was asked to write a vaudeville sketch for actress Phyllis Neilson-Terry. Death and legacy Hirsch died on April 7, 1962 in Nashville, Tennessee.

At the turn of the 20th-century Burlington had grown into a manufacturing town and a center for commercial travelers. with In order to remain a leading commercial city in the state, the businessmen in the community saw a need for a quality hotel. They banded together and raised the $350,000 required for construction of the Hotel Burlington to serve the city's business, convention and tourist needs. Davenport architects Seth E. Temple and Parke T. Burrows designed the Renaissance Revival structure. It opened on February 6, 1911, with 125 guest rooms on seven floors. All of the rooms had telephones and running water, and most of them had a private bath. An electric sign was placed on top of the building so that it was visible from the nearby train station. The hotel was so successful that the $100,000 east wing was added in 1923, and the top two floors were added in 1931 for about $300,000. In both instances the local businessmen funded the expansion. The hotel remained in operation with several different owners until 1980 when it went into receivership. The building was subsequently converted into an apartment building.

In April 1943 it was redeployed to the command of 5 AA Bde on the South Coast of England at short notice to combat the campaign of 'hit and run' attacks on coastal towns begun by the Luftwaffe in March. AA Command urgently required light AA (LAA) guns to deal with these fast-moving daylight attacks by fighter-bombers, and S/L units were retrained to operate twin Vickers 0.5-inch machine guns in this role.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 13 March 1943, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/83.Routledge, pp. 401–4. By now, AA Command was suffering a manpower crisis: it was required to release units and personnel to the field armies and was still short of LAA gun units, but it was over-provided with S/L units. The solution was to convert existing S/L units or to disband them and redistribute the personnel.Pile's despatch.Routledge, pp. 399–401. On 31 May 1943, RHQ and the three batteries of 71st (East Lancs) S/L Rgt were all reduced to cadres, with the men being sent to reinforce LAA units. On 14 March 1944 the regiment was considered to have lapsed into 'suspended animation'..Routledge, pp. 399 & 409. Postwar When the TA was reconstituted on 1 January 1947, 71st S/L Rgt was reformed at Rusholme, Manchester, as 606th (Mixed) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, RA (East Lancashire), ('Mixed' denoting that members of the Women's Royal Army Corps were integrated into the unit). It was under the command of Lt-Col C.W. Provis; RHQ and two batteries were at the drill hall at Norman Road, Rusholme, with an out-station at Flixton, six miles from Rusholme. A 3.7-inch HAA gun was installed in the drill hall for instructional purposes, and the regiment also had a cadet detachment at Norman Road. It formed part of 70 AA Bde (reformed from the former 44 AA Bde).Frederick, p. 1026.Litchfield, Appendix 5, p. 333.Farndale, Annex M, p. 340.592–638 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on.<67–106 AA Bdes at British Army 1945 on.Watson, TA 1947. When AA Command abolished on 10 March 1955, the regiment was amalgamated with other Manchester-based units to form 314 HAA Rgt, with 606 and 465 (Manchester Regiment) HAA Rgts together providing P (Manchester) Bty at Hulme, Manchester. The drill hall at Norman Road was taken over in June 1955 by 42 (East Lancashire) Signal Regiment, Royal Corps of Signals.

He is remembered as one of the best mufassirs in Albania. Life Dalliu was born in Tirana in 1878, in a middle class Moslem family, son of Mustafa Dalliu. He had two brothers, Hysni and Ali, both bearing titles hafiz and hadji. Ibrahim was an early childhood friend of Seremedin and Murat Toptani, with whom he kept close ties for the rest of hist life.Hafiz Ibrahim Dalliu, patriot dhe atdhetar (in Albanian) He studied theology in Istanbul. There he came in contact with the activists of the Central Committee for Defending Albanian Rights. He returned to Tirana where he started working as a teacher in 1901. At the same time he was a member of the local branch of the Bashkimi (Unity) Club, one of the many of that time throughout all Albanian populated areas. He participated in the Congress of Elbasan, during 2–9 September 1909, as part of the Tirana delegation. One of the Congress's main achievement was the establishment of the Normal School of Elbasan which would prepare teachers for supporting the spread of Albanian education. He was imprisoned by the Ottoman authorities during 1909-1911 due to his nationalist activity. On 26 November 1912, Dalliu was an active participant in the ceremony of raising the Albanian flag in Tirana, 2 days before the National Declaration of Independence. At the same time he drafted a letter-protest which was sent to the Serbian army approaching from the north. From April 25 to May 3, 1921, he took part in the Congress for National Unity in Vlora, together with Musa Maçi as representatives of the society \\"Lidhja Kombëtare\\" (National League), Qazim Mulleti of Tirana's society \\"Vllaznia- Zgjimi\\" (Brotherhood - Awakening), and Avni Rustemi for the society \\"Bashkimi\\" (Union). During the interbellum period, Dalliu focused on teaching, writing, and translation. He is remembered in Albanian as one of the few high rank clerics who were devoted to the national cause as well as to religion. He taught for many years at the Madrasa of Tirana and wrote many work and studies on Islam. He also wrote satirical poetry, and published the newspaper Dajti (Dajt). He was part of the National Assembly in 1943. \\\\- Republika e Shqipërisë KUVEND.

She represented the United States at the 1928 Summer Olympics in the 100 meters and at the 1936 Summer Olympics in the 80-meter hurdles. In 1932 she equaled the 80-meter hurdles world record, but fell at the Olympic Trials and missed the Olympics. Biography Anne Vrana was born in Schenectady, New York, to a Hungarian immigrant family. The family moved to California when she was young, and she took up running seriously as a student at Fremont High School in Los Angeles. She joined the Pasadena Athletic Club, which had a women's track and field team. At the 1927 AAU championships, her first significant meet, she placed second in the long jump and ran on the winning 4 × 110 yard relay team; she false started in the 100 meters, which she had considered her best event. In her early years Vrana copied Charley Paddock's jump finish in her races; she dropped the style later in her career. Vrana placed third in the 100 meters at the 1928 United States Olympic Trials, qualifying for the Summer Olympics in Amsterdam. At the Olympics she placed third in her heat and was eliminated. Vrana married Howard O'Brien, a fellow Fremont High track athlete, in 1930; subsequently, she competed as Anne O'Brien. O'Brien took up the 80-meter hurdles before the next Olympics, prompted by losses to local rival Evelyn Furtsch in flat races. In June 1932 she ran the hurdles in 11.8 at a regional tryout meet in Pasadena; the time equaled Marjorie Clark's world record from the previous year. O'Brien entered the 1932 Olympic Trials as the national leader in the 80-meter hurdles, ahead of the eventual Olympic top two Babe Didrikson and Evelyne Hall. In the Trials heats O'Brien fell at the fourth hurdle, failed to finish and was eliminated. Due to the cuts and abrasions she received in her fall she was given a tetanus shot, which made her ill; she was forced to withdraw from the semi-finals of her other event, the flat 100 meters. She was named to the American Olympic team as an alternate in the hurdles, but did not get the opportunity to compete. O'Brien gave birth to a daughter in 1934, but continued competing; she won the 80-meter hurdles at the 1936 Trials, qualifying for her second Olympic Games. At the Olympics in Berlin she placed second in her heat and fourth in her semi-final; she narrowly missed qualifying for the final. O'Brien's athletic career tapered off after 1936, though she continued competing in minor meets into her forties. She died in Tustin, California in July 2007, aged 95.

The tournament was played in four regional groups, where two teams advanced to the regional qualifying finals. The winners of these qualifiers advanced to the final knockout phase, which was held at Nuuk Stadium in Nuuk. It was won by Kissaviarsuk-33 who defeated Nanok in the final. Background The first federation to organise a national football championship in Greenland was the GIF (), a general sports federation that organised more than just football tournaments, founded on 3 September 1953 at a meeting attended by eleven clubs from Upernavik, Uummannaq, Qeqertarsuatsiaat, Qasigiannguit, Aasiaat, Sisimiut, Maniitsoq, Nuuk, Paamiut and Qaqortoq. The 1954–55 tournament was the first national football tournament and GIF continued to organise the competition, usually announced as Fodboldturneringen, Grønlandturneringen or Fodboldmesterskab i Grønland, until 1970. For the first decade of its existence, the tournament was held sporadically, with iterations often taking more than a year to complete. In 1971 a football specific federation, the Football Association of Greenland (Greenlandic: Kalaallit Nunaanni Isikkamik Arsaattartut Kattuffiat; ), was founded, and took over the organisation of the tournament. Format The first phase of the tournament split the teams into four geographic pools, with three of these pools containing two groups and the pool containing the most teams (North Greenland) being split into three groups. The group winners then played off directly to qualify for the final phase, with two of North Greenland's pool winners playing in a semi final before meeting Nanok, the other pool's winner and reigning champions in their geographic final. The final phase saw the four regional champions play in a knockout series, held in Nuuk in September, 1964.

The film proved to be controversial, with the Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs claiming it 'depicts and demonstrates the imagined tyranny which the Bulgarians experienced under 500 years of Turkish rule,' and 'whose crude and ugly depiction' would 'offend ... the feelings of our nation as well as instigate Bulgarian ideas against us.' The Ministry then demanded an explanation from the Bulgarian government as to why it had given permission for the circulation of such a film. The Bulgarian government defended the film and did not accept the Turkish view that the film was anti-Turkish, pointing out that 'since the imagined events in the film concerned the Ottoman period, [the film] could not be perceived as being against the new Turkish government and nation.'Boyar, Ebru (2007).

She spent a large portion of her career participating in efforts to inform the public about the environment in regards to synthetic chemicals such as pesticides. A talented artist and writer, Briggs would often use the combination of her understanding environmental hazards (such as pesticides) with her artistic skills to achieve her goals in regard to environmental education. After graduate school she moved to Baltimore to work for Glenn L. Martin Company as a mechanical arts illustrator and would later move on to work for the U.S Fish and Wildlife Service. She also worked as chief of the Bureau of Reclamation's graphics sections and drew diagrams for the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History. After Rachel Carson's passing in 1964 Briggs became the executive director of the Rachel Carson Council (without pay) between the years of 1970 and 1992. She served as an essential editor and illustrator of a number of Rachel Carson's works.  Early life and education  Shirley Briggs was born on May 12, 1918 in Iowa City, Iowa, the only child of Nellie and John Ely Briggs, a professor of political science at the University of Iowa. She graduated from University High School and later attended the University of Iowa for both her undergraduate and master's degrees.

This was where she met Rachel Carson and forged their friendship through mutual friend Katherine Howe. During her employment at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Briggs contributed illustrations and writing to several of Carson's publications, such as the “Chincoteaque: A National Wildlife Refuge” illustrated pamphlet, published in 1947. Both women were involved in the Audubon Naturalist Society, and they frequently traveled together on expeditions organized by the ANS and socialized through parties and get-togethers. A few of these included a trip during the fall of 1945 to Ocean City, a trip to Chincoteague, Virginia during 1944, camping during 1947 to Cobb Island in Virginia, and a trip to Seneca in 1947. On these trips, Briggs took a number of well-known photographs of Carson, and throughout their friendship, they also engaged in a letter correspondence. Later on, Briggs collaborated with Carson on research for the latter's book, Silent Spring. After Rachel Carson died in 1964, Shirley Briggs worked to preserve Carson's work in Silent Spring.

Over the last 15 years electricity price forecasts have become a fundamental input to energy companies’ decision-making mechanisms at the corporate level.  Background  Since the early 1990s, the process of deregulation and the introduction of competitive electricity markets have been reshaping the landscape of the traditionally monopolistic and government- controlled power sectors. Throughout Europe, North America and Australia, electricity is now traded under market rules using spot and derivative contracts. However, electricity is a very special commodity: it is economically non-storable and power system stability requires a constant balance between production and consumption. At the same time, electricity demand depends on weather (temperature, wind speed, precipitation, etc.) and the intensity of business and everyday activities (on-peak vs. off-peak hours, weekdays vs. weekends, holidays, etc.). These unique characteristics lead to price dynamics not observed in any other market, exhibiting daily, weekly and often annual seasonality and abrupt, short-lived and generally unanticipated price spikes. Extreme price volatility, which can be up to two orders of magnitude higher than that of any other commodity or financial asset, has forced market participants to hedge not only volume but also price risk. Price forecasts from a few hours to a few months ahead have become of particular interest to power portfolio managers. A power market company able to forecast the volatile wholesale prices with a reasonable level of accuracy can adjust its bidding strategy and its own production or consumption schedule in order to reduce the risk or maximize the profits in day-ahead trading. A ballpark estimate of savings from a 1% reduction in the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of short-term price forecasts is $300,000 per year for a utility with 1GW peak load.  Taxonomy of modeling approaches  A taxonomy of electricity price forecasting (EPF) and modeling approaches according to Weron (2014). A variety of methods and ideas have been tried for EPF over the last 15 years, with varying degrees of success. They can be broadly classified into six groups.  Multi-agent models  Multi-agent (multi-agent simulation', equilibrium, game theoretic) models simulate the operation of a system of heterogeneous agents (generating units, companies) interacting with each other, and build the price process by matching the demand and supply in the market. This class includes cost-based models (or production-cost models, PCM), equilibrium or game theoretic approaches (like the Nash-Cournot framework, supply function equilibrium - SFE, strategic production-cost models - SPCM) and agent-based models. Multi-agent models generally focus on qualitative issues rather than quantitative results. They may provide insights as to whether or not prices will be above marginal costs, and how this might influence the players’ outcomes. However, they pose problems if more quantitative conclusions have to be drawn, particularly if electricity prices have to be predicted with a high level of precision.  Fundamental models  Fundamental (structural) methods try to capture the basic physical and economic relationships which are present in the production and trading of electricity. The functional associations between fundamental drivers (loads, weather conditions, system parameters, etc.) are postulated, and the fundamental inputs are modeled and predicted independently, often via statistical, reduced-form or computational intelligence techniques. In general, two subclasses of fundamental models can be identified: parameter rich models and parsimonious structural models of supply and demand. Two major challenges arise in the practical implementation of fundamental models: data availability and incorporation of stochastic fluctuations of the fundamental drivers. In building the model, we make specific assumptions about physical and economic relationships in the marketplace, and therefore the price projections generated by the models are very sensitive to violations of these assumptions.  Reduced-form models  Reduced-form (quantitative, stochastic) models characterize the statistical properties of electricity prices over time, with the ultimate objective of derivatives valuation and risk management. Their main intention is not to provide accurate hourly price forecasts, but rather to replicate the main characteristics of daily electricity prices, like marginal distributions at future time points, price dynamics, and correlations between commodity prices. If the price process chosen is not appropriate for capturing the main properties of electricity prices, the results from the model are likely to be unreliable. However, if the model is too complex, the computational burden will prevent its use on- line in trading departments. Depending on the type of market under consideration, reduced-form models can be classified as: * Spot price models, which provide a parsimonious representation of the dynamics of spot prices. Their main drawback is the problem of pricing derivatives, i.e., the identification of the risk premium linking spot and forward prices. The two most popular subclasses include jump-diffusion and Markov regime-switching models. * Forward price models allow for the pricing of derivatives in a straightforward manner (but only of those written on the forward price of electricity). However, they too have their limitations; most importantly, the lack of data that can be used for calibration and the inability to derive the properties of spot prices from the analysis of forward curves.  Statistical models  Statistical (econometric, technical analysis) methods forecast the current price by using a mathematical combination of the previous prices and/or previous or current values of exogenous factors, typically consumption and production figures, or weather variables. The two most important categories are additive and multiplicative models. They differ in whether the predicted price is the sum (additive) of a number of components or the product (multiplicative) of a number of factors. The former are far more popular, but the two are closely related - a multiplicative model for prices can be transformed into an additive model for log-prices. Statistical models are attractive because some physical interpretation may be attached to their components, thus allowing engineers and system operators to understand their behavior. They are often criticized for their limited ability to model the (usually) nonlinear behavior of electricity prices and related fundamental variables. However, in practical applications, their performances are not worse than those of the non-linear computational intelligence methods (see below). For instance, in the load forecasting track of the Global Energy Forecasting Competition (GEFCom2012) attracting hundreds of participants worldwide, the top four winning entries used regression-type models. A taxonomy of the artificial neural network architectures that are most popular in EPF (see Weron, 2014). Input nodes are denoted by filled circles, output nodes by empty circles, and nodes in the hidden layer by empty circles with a dashed outline. The activation functions for RBF networks are radial basis functions, whereas multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) typically use piecewise linear or sigmoid activation functions (illustrated in circles). Statistical models constitute a very rich class which includes: * Similar-day and exponential smoothing methods. * Regression models. * Time series models without (AR, ARMA, ARIMA, Fractional ARIMA - FARIMA, Seasonal ARIMA - SARIMA, Threshold AR - TAR) and with exogenous variables (ARX, ARMAX, ARIMAX, SARIMAX, TARX). * Heteroskedastic time series models (GARCH, AR-GARCH).  Computational intelligence models  Computational intelligence (artificial intelligence-based, machine learning, non-parametric, non-linear statistical) techniques combine elements of learning, evolution and fuzziness to create approaches that are capable of adapting to complex dynamic systems, and may be regarded as \\"intelligent\\" in this sense. Artificial neural networks, fuzzy systems and support vector machines (SVM) are unquestionably the main classes of computational intelligence techniques in EPF. Their major strength is the ability to handle complexity and non-linearity. In general, computational intelligence methods are better at modeling these features of electricity prices than the statistical techniques (see above). At the same time, this flexibility is also their major weakness. The ability to adapt to nonlinear, spiky behaviors will not necessarily result in better point or probabilistic forecasts.  Hybrid models  Many of the modeling and price forecasting approaches considered in the literature are hybrid solutions, combining techniques from two or more of the groups listed above. Their classification is non-trivial, if possible at all. As an example of hybrid model AleaModel (AleaSoft) combines Neural Networks and Box Jenkins models.  Forecasting horizons  It is customary to talk about short-, medium- and long-term forecasting, but there is no consensus in the literature as to what the thresholds should actually be: * Short-term forecasting generally involves horizons from a few minutes up to a few days ahead, and is of prime importance in day-to-day market operations. * Medium-term forecasting, from a few days to a few months ahead, is generally preferred for balance sheet calculations, risk management and derivatives pricing. In many cases, especially in electricity price forecasting, evaluation is based not on the actual point forecasts, but on the distributions of prices over certain future time periods. As this type of modeling has a long-standing tradition in finance, an inflow of \\"finance solutions\\" is observed. * Long-term forecasting, with lead times measured in months, quarters or even years, concentrates on investment profitability analysis and planning, such as determining the future sites or fuel sources of power plants.  Future of electricity price forecasting  In his extensive review paper, Weron looks ahead and speculates on the directions EPF will or should take over the next decade or so:  Fundamental price drivers and input variables   Seasonality  A key point in electricity spot price modeling and forecasting is the appropriate treatment of seasonality. The electricity price exhibits seasonality at three levels: the daily and weekly, and to some extent - the annual. In short-term forecasting, the annual or long-term seasonality is usually ignored, but the daily and weekly patterns (including a separate treatment of holidays) are of prime importance. This, however, may not be the right approach. As Nowotarski and Weron have recently shown, decomposing a series of electricity prices into a long-term seasonal and a stochastic component, modeling them independently and combining their forecasts can bring - contrary to a common belief - an accuracy gain compared to an approach in which a given model is calibrated to the prices themselves. In mid-term forecasting, the daily patterns become less relevant and most EPF models work with average daily prices. However, the long-term trend-cycle component plays a crucial role. Its misspecification can introduce bias, which may lead to a bad estimate of the mean reversion level or of the price spike intensity and severity, and consequently, to underestimating the risk. Finally, in the long term, when the time horizon is measured in years, the daily, weekly and even annual seasonality may be ignored, and long-term trends dominate. Adequate treatment - both in-sample and out-of-sample - of seasonality has not been given enough attention in the literature so far.  Variable selection  Another crucial issue in electricity price forecasting is the appropriate choice of explanatory variables. Apart from historical electricity prices, the current spot price is dependent on a large set of fundamental drivers, including system loads, weather variables, fuel costs, the reserve margin (i.e., available generation minus/over predicted demand) and information about scheduled maintenance and forced outages. Although \\"pure price\\" models are sometimes used for EPF, in the most common day-ahead forecasting scenario most authors select a combination of these fundamental drivers, based on the heuristics and experience of the forecaster. Very rarely has an automated selection or shrinkage procedure been carried out in EPF, especially for a large set of initial explanatory variables. However, the machine learning literature provides viable tools that can be broadly classified into two categories: * Feature or subset selection, which involves identifying a subset of predictors that we believe to be influential, then fitting a model on the reduced set of variables. * Shrinkage (also known as regularization), that fits the full model with all predictors using an algorithm that shrinks the estimated coefficients towards zero, which can significantly reduce their variance. Depending on what type of shrinkage is performed, some of the coefficients may be shrunk to zero itself. As such, some shrinkage methods - like the lasso - de facto perform variable selection. Some of these techniques have been utilized in the context of EPF: * stepwise regression, including single step elimination, * Ridge regression, * lasso, * and elastic nets, but their use is not common. Further development and employment of methods for selecting the most effective input variables - from among the past electricity prices, as well as the past and predicted values of the fundamental drivers - is needed.  Spike forecasting and the reserve margin  When predicting spike occurrences or spot price volatility, one of the most influential fundamental variables is the reserve margin, also called surplus generation. It relates the available capacity (generation, supply), C_t, to the demand (load), D_t, at a given moment in time t. The traditional engineering notion of the reserve margin defines it as the difference between the two, i.e., RM = C_t - D_t, but many authors prefer to work with dimensionless ratios \\\\rho_t=D_t/C_t, R_t=C_t/D_t -1 or the so-called capacity utilization CU_t=1 - D_t/C_t. Its rare application in EPF can be justified only by the difficulty of obtaining good quality reserve margin data. Given that more and more system operators (see e.g. http://www.elexon.co.uk) are disclosing such information nowadays, reserve margin data should be playing a significant role in EPF in the near future.  Probabilistic forecasts  The use of prediction intervals (PI) and densities, or probabilistic forecasting, has become much more common over the past three decades, as practitioners have come to understand the limitations of point forecasts. Despite the bold move by the organizers of the Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2014 to require the participants to submit forecasts of the 99 percentiles of the predictive distribution (day- ahead in the price track) and not the point forecasts as in the 2012 edition, this does not seem to be a common case in EPF as yet. If PIs are computed at all, they usually are distribution-based (and approximated by the standard deviation of the model residuals) or empirical. The latter method resembles the estimation of the Value-at-Risk via historical simulation, and consists of computing sample quantiles of the empirical distribution of the one-step-ahead prediction errors. A new forecast combination (see below) technique has been introduced recently in the context of EPF. Quantile Regression Averaging (QRA) involves applying quantile regression to the point forecasts of a small number of individual forecasting models or experts, hence allows to leverage existing development of point forecasting.  Combining forecasts  Consensus forecasts, also known as combining forecasts, forecast averaging or model averaging (in econometrics and statistics) and committee machines, ensemble averaging or expert aggregation (in machine learning), are predictions of the future that are created by combining together several separate forecasts which have often been created using different methodologies. Despite their popularity in econometrics, averaged forecasts have not been used extensively in the context of electricity markets to date. There is some limited evidence on the adequacy of combining forecasts of electricity demand, but it was only very recently that combining was used in EPF and only for point forecasts. Combining probabilistic (i.e., interval and density) forecasts is much less popular, even in econometrics in general, mainly because of the increased complexity of the problem. Since Quantile Regression Averaging (QRA) allows to leverage existing development of point forecasting, it is particularly attractive from a practical point of view and may become a popular tool in EPF in the near future.  Multivariate factor models  The literature on forecasting daily electricity prices has concentrated largely on models that use only information at the aggregated (i.e., daily) level. On the other hand, the very rich body of literature on forecasting intra-day prices has used disaggregated data (i.e., hourly or half-hourly), but generally has not explored the complex dependence structure of the multivariate price series. If we want to explore the structure of intra-day electricity prices, we need to use dimension reduction methods; for instance, factor models with factors estimated as principal components (PC). Empirical evidence indicates that there are forecast improvements from incorporating disaggregated (i.e., hourly or zonal) data for predicting daily system prices, especially when the forecast horizon exceeds one week. With the increase of computational power, the real-time calibration of these complex models will become feasible and we may expect to see more EPF applications of the multivariate framework in the coming years.  A universal test ground  All major review publications conclude that there are problems with comparing the methods developed and used in the EPF literature. This is due mainly to the use of different datasets, different software implementations of the forecasting models and different error measures, but also to the lack of statistical rigor in many studies. This calls for a comprehensive, thorough study involving (i) the same datasets, (ii) the same robust error evaluation procedures, and (iii) statistical testing of the significance of one model's outperformance of another. To some extent, the Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2014 has addressed these issues. Yet more has to be done. A selection of the better- performing measures (weighted-MAE, seasonal MASE or RMSSE) should be used either exclusively or in conjunction with the more popular ones (MAPE, RMSE). The empirical results should be further tested for the significance of the differences in forecasting accuracies of the models.

Examples of gateway communities in the US include Jackson, Wyoming; Tusayan, Arizona; and Gardiner, Montana. These places provide services for guests of the adjacent attractions, such as gas, food, and lodging, and as a result rely upon these attractions to sustain their economy. Since they are neighbors, management actions taken by either the attraction or the community itself have direct impacts on one another. Shared social, economic and ecological impacts are some of the primary considerations. For example, increased seasonal tourist activity can put significant strain on the infrastructure of gateway communities. Economically, while tourism can be a boon, it can also price locals out of the community. Land prices close to Yellowstone National Park increased by 330% in the 15 years between 1981 and 1996. Near Grand Teton National Park in Idaho, many locals live in the more distant communities of Driggs and Victor rather than in Jackson. Ecological implications including those of watershed management, fire management in urban and wildland contexts, and noise and air pollution are concerns common to gateway communities and their neighboring attractions. Because of this shared responsibility, managing agencies often form partnerships with local municipal authorities.

He served for one year as Assistant Secretary of Agriculture of the United States, and has been described as \\"arguably the single, most influential figure involved in the early growth and development of plant pathology and the plant sciences generally in the USDA.\\" He served as president of the Botanical Society of America, was a charter member of the American Phytopathological Society, and was a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Early life and education Galloway was born October 16, 1863, in Millersburg, Missouri, the fourth child and only son of parents Robert McCauley Galloway and Jane Galloway (née McCray). His father was a Kentucky-born farmer and miler of Scotch-Irish descent, and his mother's family came from Maryland. At age 14 Beverly became a clerk in a Columbia, Missouri, drugstore and in 1878 became a registered pharmacist, practicing for two years. He entered the University of Missouri in 1882, where he was mentored by botanist Samuel M. Tracy, and graduated with a Bachelor of Agricultural Science degree in 1884. He worked in the University's horticulture department for two years after graduation, where he developed an interest in plant diseases. His 1887 paper Parasitic fungi of Missouri was the first systematic and economic mycological work conducted in the state. Career In 1887 Galloway was appointed as assistant in the Section of Mycology of the United States Department of Agriculture, becoming head of the Section the following year after the resignation of Frank Lamson-Scribner. As chief, Galloway expanded the research scope of the Section to include the chemical control of fungal diseases of a larger selection of crops, and made the Section more responsive to the needs of farmers and gardeners. In 1895 the Section of Mycology was renamed the Division of Vegetable Physiology and Pathology, with Galloway remaining chief. In 1913, he was appointed Assistant Secretary of Agriculture of the United States, serving for one year before accepting a deanship at New York State College of Agriculture, a college of Cornell University. He left Cornell in 1916 and returned to the USDA, where he served until his retirement in 1933. Over his career, Galloway served as president of the Botanical Society of America (1902), was a charter member of the American Phytopathological Society, and was elected a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He received honorary doctorates from the University of Missouri (1902) and the University of Maryland (1923). He was elected as member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Agriculture in 1899.Nordisk familjebok, Vol. 9 (1908), p. 641 Personal life and death Galloway married Agnes Stewart Rankin of Kansas City, Missouri, in 1888, with whom he had three children: Robert Rankin, Alexander Gordon, and Beverly Stewart.

In 1894 they moved out of the semi-detached houses which became part of Cranbrook Road on the Sulhamstead Estate, the houses they rented were knocked down much later and they became Stephen Fox House. In 1896 Manor Farm House was sold and it became Wilton Avenue. He was the first to introduce nasogastric feeding of the insane.

It was published in the UK in April 1986 and in the US in 1987. Conception Highsmith returned briefly from Europe to spend a few days researching the book's New York setting and walking the streets of the West Village. She explained: \\"I went to see what the bars are like now, for the geography, not the people; I had the people in my head.\\" Her parents lived on Grove Street and she lived for a summer as a teenager on Morton Street, which both figure prominently in the novel. According to one of Highsmith's biographers, Penzler Books had the novel set in type when Highsmith denied Otto Penzler the US publishing rights. Plot Jack Sutherland, a 30-year-old graphic artist, lives in Greenwich Village with his wife Natalia and their daughter. They are well off and enjoy a wide social network. Ralph Linderman, middle-aged, long divorced, and a loner, self-righteous and judgmental, lives nearby and works odd hours as a security guard. Their worlds intersect briefly when Ralph finds Jack's wallet in the street and returns it in person. A second intersection develops more slowly, at first without direct contact. Jack chats with a coffee shop waitress, Elsie Tyler, a pretty 20-year-old blond from a small town in upstate New York. Ralph has already noticed Elsie in the neighborhood and made a nuisance of himself warning her about the dangers of life in the city, the wrong friends who will introduce her to drugs, casual sex, and prostitution. Jack notices how Elsie waves off Ralph's counsel, and Ralph views Jack's friendship with Elsie as immoral behavior that is destroying her innocence. He sees, repeatedly yet almost accidentally as he walks his dog, Jack and Elsie (and sometimes Natalia or another female friend) coming or going from the Sutherlands' apartment at all hours, interprets their interactions in the most negative light, and writes Jack letters warning him against corrupting Elsie. The Sutherlands both draw Elsie into their circle of friends, get her invited to adult parties, and help launch her career as a fashion photography model. Ralph, by contrast, tries to monitor Elsie's social life by tracking her movements when she changes apartments. Elsie is exploring her sexuality and has a series of relationships with women, including Natalia. Jack and Ralph, and a number of other characters, each find her a striking figure, or love her, or develop an infatuation with their image of her. A sudden act of violence brings into focus all these contrasts. Warnings once dismissed appear prescient. Sophistication appears naive. Judgment and self- awareness prove not to be what the reader has been led to believe. Critical reception The reviewer for the New York Times described it as \\"a characteristic drama of interlocking destinies and insidious obsessions\\" in which \\"Miss Highsmith has added another memorable portrait to her gallery of near-pathological loners.\\" He called it \\"not quite as powerful as the very best of Miss Highsmith's other novels\\" yet \\"in some respects more humane\\" in balancing a set of comfortably positioned and socially fulfilled New Yorkers against one menacing psychological figure. He praised the development and integration of minor characters and subplots that \\"unfold as compellingly as the central drama\\". In the London Review of Books, Christopher Ricks praised the way Highsmith as a novelist straddles the borders of the crime genre and the \\"studies of alienation\\" of the best literature, as she places the character of Elsie \\"dead-set for success, garish and enslaved, in the world of glossy modelling and of lip-service to art, an underworld of unreality which comes on as the overworld\\". Terrence Rafferty, praising the novel at length in The New Yorker, considered the same question of genre and called Found in the Street \\"fiction too abandoned to care what it's called, literature or trash, that celebrates restlessness and volatility\\". He called it a \\"thriller' with \\"no thriller writer's gamesmanship ... none of the reassuring trickery of professional pulp; Highsmith's style is as blunt and straightforward as a strip-search\\". He writes: The Los Angeles Times enjoyed how the novel catches \\"the taste and texture of life in Manhattan ... [f]rom the exhilaration of discovering a previously overlooked Greek take-out restaurant to the feel of jogging through the empty, early-morning streets\\". Fiona Peters, in her study of Highsmith's writing, deems the violent act near the novels' close as \\"curiously out of place\\", but typical of the author's need to freeze her heroine in an ideal state, \\"surface without substantiality\\", rather than explore the life that awaits her in a world antagonistic to women. Like all of her work, Found in the Street proved more successful in Europe than in the US. Some 40,000 copies sold in Germany, just 4,000 in the US. In 2003, John Malkovich said he was working on a screen adaptation of the novel.

Such attempts of vicarious behavior has been noted by some analysts as having negative consequences. In actual circumstances wherein a parent tries to live out their accomplishment through their child even though the child seems uninterested, it has been labeled with common phrases such as chasing lost dreams.

It was presented to the City of London by King Henry V in return for having provided the king with 10,000 marks (£6,666) to fund a war in France in 1415, when his army captured Harfleur and then won the Battle of Agincourt. Description The sceptre measures long, with a long thin twisting rock crystal shaft in two parts mounted with gold and pearls. A gold crown with alternating fleur-de-lys and cross embellishments decorates one end, mounted with jewels including Afghan red spinel, Ceylon blue sapphires, and pearls from the Persian Gulf; within the circlet of the crown is a painting on parchment of the Royal Arms of England adopted in 1406, quartering three fleurs-de-lys for France with three lions for England. The crown may have been adapted from a religious sculpture of the Virgin Mary. The other end has a large glass boss. History The sceptre was probably made in Paris, c.1380–1420, and presented to the City of London between 1415 and 1421: it was depicted being held by the Lord Mayor of London in a painting of the coronation of Queen Catherine of Valois In February 1421. A rare object of medieval gold to have survived to the modern day, it was hidden during the Commonwealth and kept safe by the Lord Mayor Sir Thomas Bloodworth during the Great Fire of London in 1666. The glass boss was replaced by the jewellers Rundell, Bridge & Rundell in the 1830s. The sceptre is kept in the City's vaults, and usually only seen in public at the coronation of a monarch. It is one of the symbolic items – sceptre, sword, purse, seal – that are touched during the annual Silent Ceremony to install a new Lord Mayor each November, but remains in its protective box throughout. The sceptre went on public display for the first time in 2015, at the Guildhall Art Gallery.

Early years Albert Marc Chichery was born on 12 October 1888 in Le Blanc, Indre. He completed his secondary education at the Collège du Blanc, then began working for his parent's business. They ran a butcher's shop in Le Blanc. He was called up for military service, which he completed as an officer of the reserve. In World War I (1914–18) he served with the 135th infantry regiment. He rose to the rank of Lieutenant. After the war he founded a factory that made bicycles, with considerable success. Production rose to 25,000 annually in a factory with 150 employees. His business owned the \\"Dion-Bouton\\" brand. His \\"Dilecta\\" brand bicycles won all the major road races. Political career Chichery was elected to the municipal council, then to the general council of the Indre department. He was elected to the legislature on the second ballot in the general elections of 1–8 May 1932 for Le Blanc constituency. He sat with the Radical Republican and Radical Socialist group. He was reelected on the second ballot in May 1936. He became president of the Radical group in the chamber. He stated, \\"from the ideological point of view, Radical doctrine best embodies the Cartesian spirit of our country. ... In the words of President Herriot, Radicalism is the political applications of rationalism, that particularly French quality.\\" Chichery was not a strong Radical leader, and mainly served as the instrument of Édouard Daladier for managing the deputies. At the time of the Munich crisis, at the urging of Colonel André Laffargue, Chichery pressed Daladier to appoint Maxime Weygand head of the armed forces. During World War II (1939–45), when the Reynaud–Daladier cabinet was formed on 22 March 1940, Chichery told Reynaud, \\"The only thing left for you to do is resign.\\" On 5 June 1940 Chichery was named Minister of Commerce and Industry in the cabinet of Paul Reynaud in place of Léon Baréty, who had resigned on 18 May 1940. The Reynaud cabinet was dissolved on 16 June 1940, and Chichery was appointed Minister of Agriculture and Food Supply in the cabinet of Philippe Pétain, holding office until 12 July 1940. He succeeded Henri Queuille as Minister of Supplies and Paul Thellier as Minister of Agriculture. He was succeeded by Paul Caziot. At the Congress of Vichy Chichery voted to grant the constitutional powers requested by Pétain, and became a member of the National Council of the Vichy government. During the liberation of France Chichery was abducted from his property near Le Blanc on 15 August 1944 and killed in the nearby woods by a bullet through the neck.

The song's composition was originally credited to Al Johnson and Joe Ruffino, though Johnson now holds exclusive rights. It is now considered an iconic festive song of the New Orleans Carnival season. Background Al Johnson, sometimes referred to as Al \\"Carnival Time\\" Johnson, was the singer and pianist who performed \\"It's Carnival Time.\\" He was originally from New Orleans, Louisiana. After spending his early years in Houston, he returned to New Orleans at the age of ten settling in the Lower Ninth Ward. His father bought a piano for his sisters and a trombone for his brother which Johnson took interest, and learning the basic chord changes in different keys. His early musical influences included Sugar Boy Crawford, Fats Domino and Smiley Lewis, to name a few. In 1956, at seventeen, he recorded his first songs, \\"Ole Time Talkin\\" and \\"I've Done Wrong\\"\\" for Aladdin Records. Johnson subsequently signed with Ric records and recorded series of songs at Cosimo Matassa's New Orleans recording studio starting with \\"Lena\\" in 1958. In 1960 Johnson recorded \\"Carnival Time\\" for the label. The song was produced by Joe Ruffino, owner of the Ric label. Its composition was originally credited to both Johnson and Ruffino. Johnson was subsequently drafted into the army and was stationed at Fort Bliss, Texas. When he returned to New Orleans in late 1964, he found that Ruffino had died and that a protracted legal fight over royalties and rights to his music, among others, had left him with virtually nothing to show for his songs. Johnson continued to perform where he could, and was finally awarded full rights to his hit song in 1999. The song has become a local classic and has joined Professor Longhair’s \\"Go to the Mardi Gras\\" and \\"Big Chief\\", and The Hawketts \\"Mardi Gras Mambo\\" as one of the most played and requested songs of the New Orleans Mardi Gras.

As its subtitle notes, the book is intended as a form of sleep induction. It uses standard hypnosis techniques to get children to relax; it differs from most children's books in that among the text to be read there are also instructions on how to read the text out loud, including the placement of deliberate yawns. The book was originally written in Swedish, and was self-published, available via Amazon.com's print-on-demand service CreateSpace. It was later translated into six other languages, including English in 2014. After being released in English, it climbed up Amazon's bestseller charts, and in August 2015 it became the first self-published book to top the Amazon US chart. In September 2015, the book was acquired by Penguin Random House as part of a three-book deal. It is no longer available via print-on-demand. The book's plot consists of the title character, Roger the Rabbit (\\"Kalle Kanin\\" in the original Swedish), travelling with his mother to visit his Uncle Yawn; along the way they meet creatures including Sleepy Snail and the Heavy-Eyed Owl. The Rabbit Who Wants to Fall Asleep was parodied in 2016 by the book The Rabbit Who Wants to Go to Harvard by Diana Holquist and Christopher Eliopoulos, also published by Penguin Random House. The parody book also mocked American so-called helicopter parents. A sequel to the book, The Little Elephant Who Wants to Fall Asleep, written by Ehrlin and illustrated by Sydney Hanson, was published in 2016.

In his youth, he was a brave soldier to whom the Duke Robert gave more than one mark of esteem. Later, he was poorly paid for his services by Gislbert and began to look on the profession of arms with disgust.

Mars, under the command of Captain Count Van Bijland, was the only Dutch warship in the roadstead. Because she was grossly outnumbered and outgunned, she fired only two or three pro-forma shots. Two of the British ships shot at Mars and Van Bijland then answered with his cannons. Rodney reprimanded the captains responsible for this lack of discipline. Mars was captured with an entire convoy of merchant ships. British Royal Navy The Royal Navy commissioned Mars under Captain John Whitmore Chetwynd.

Hurwitz is known for her work on heat-resistant materials, aerogels, Space Shuttle Columbia Accident Investigation and Shuttle Return to Flight. Hurwitz studied at Harpur College -SUNY Binghamton, Syracuse University, and Case Western Reserve University. She has been and continues to be instrumental in the development of aerogels used at NASA and in developing and testing new aerospace materials.  Education  Born in New York City, Hurwitz attended Harpur College at SUNY Binghamton from 1963-1966 and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Chemistry. She worked as a chemist at a pharmaceutical company for a short time before returning to school at Syracuse University, where she received a Master's degree in Library Science at the School of Information Studies at Syracuse in 1968. While at Syracuse University, she was employed as an indexer at Upstate Medical Center on one of the first medical information retrieval systems based upon the National Library of Medicine's indexing system; her first published paper was on literature indexing. On completion of her M.S. in Library Science, she worked in a pharmaceutical company as a technical reference librarian. Hurwitz then went on to pursue her M.S (1976) and Ph.D. (1979) degrees in Macromolecular Science and Engineering at Case Western Reserve University’s School of Engineering in the Department of Macromolecular Science  Career  Frances Hurwitz was initially hired by NASA as a chemist in 1979 at the Glenn Research Center. She has now become a Senior Materials Research Engineer specializing in thermal protection systems and in aerogels based materials, creating new materials for aeronautics and space applications. Hurwitz is a member of the American Chemical Society, the American Ceramic Society and the Society of Women Engineers She served as Chief of the Polymers Branch of the Materials and Structures Division from February 2012 to February 2013. She was also a member of several Space Shuttle Return to Flight teams and has represented NASA on various Department of Defense Technical Advisory Committees. She currently works as Senior Materials Research Engineer at NASA Glenn Center.  Space Shuttle Columbia  On February 1, 2003, the Space Shuttle Columbia broke apart upon re-entry to Earth. Frances Hurwitz was a consultant to the Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB). Her efforts contributed to receipt of a NASA Team Achievement Award in 2003 for testing of materials to resolve failure mechanisms as part of the CAIB investigation. Since Return to Flight, she has continued research on thermal aging of space materials and has led research efforts in ceramic matrix composites, thermal protection systems, and lightweight aerogel materials.  Aerogels  Aerogels are composed of 99.8% air, or empty space. This solid matter is usually made by removing the liquid from Silica Gels, leaving behind just the molecular structure of Silicon Dioxide (SiO2). Hurwitz has, instead, researched producing aerogels with a different chemical composition so the properties of aerogels, like the temperature limits, would increase and allow space travel to be safer. She has helped create an Aluminosilicate aerogel, which caused the lower thermal conductivities of the aerogels to be able to withstand temperatures higher than 900. This allows this material to better insulate space shuttles and materials in space and in re-entry of the space objects, causing less damage to the shuttle itself and the people inside it. In the same research project, she experimented with aerogels by adding in Titanium to the Aluminosilicate gels, which allowed for bigger average pore sizes and higher pore volumes. She concluded that by adding Titanium to Aluminosilicate gels, the lower thermal conductivities can now go up to temperatures of 1,200 instead of the 900 limit of regular Silicon Dioxide gels. In addition, Hurwitz has conducted research that has shown a way to image aerogels with very small pores through the use of scanning electron microscopes. She and her team inserted nitrogen gas to neutralize negative charges in the gels which can then allow the SEM to be able to scan and successfully plot out the aerogel in detail with the pores shown, even pores as small as 3 nm in diameter  Current research  Since 2007, she has established techniques for fabricating composites for entry, descent, landing, and space power systems. She has also continued her work with aerogels at over 700. She is a technical advisor on materials for NASA programs including space power systems. Since 2012, she has been involved in research on insulation for inflatable decelerators for planetary and earth entry. The insulation used in the research is made of the aerogels that she has helped develop as they can withstand higher temperatures than others (see Previous Research section). These aerogels are also better to use because they are lighter than other materials which can resist the same amount of heat, causing the shuttle to be lighter than it would with the other materials and would make it easier to launch into space. These materials make it safer for re-entry since they are very good at heat insulation and can help reduce the risk of a shuttle burning up upon re-entry. She is currently exploring the shrinkage and toxicity of various Aluminosilicate gels that are being investigated.  Personal life  The first person in her family to go to college was her uncle, who received a B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering. Her parents did not go to college, but they did place a high value on education for their children. However, her parents had expectations of them to go to college, get a bachelor's degree and go straight into the workforce, which caused Hurwitz to put off going to graduate school. She eventually went back to school and completed master's degree. Frances Hurwitz has one sister who also graduated from SUNY Binghamton.Interview with Frances Hurwitz. Conducted on October 13, 2015. Frances married Leon Hurwitz in 1968. They moved to Cleveland, Ohio in 1969 when Leon accepted a position as an instructor in the Department of Political Science at Cleveland State University. Frances and Leon have 2 children, Elise J. Hurwitz (b. 1970) and Jonathan S. Hurwitz (b.1972), and four grandchildren.  Awards and honors  Frances Hurwitz has won over 20 NASA awards and the Society of Women Engineers Achievement Award.

He bought his first when he was 15. Three years later he was racing motorcycles in club events at Oakura and became one of the founding members of the New Plymouth Motor Cycle Club. Around this time he became a motorcycle mechanic. In 1951, Callender began a successful career as a midget car driver winning a number of events. He built his own three-quarter midget, number 62. After an accident in 1956, Callender stopped midget car racing, but continued sponsoring other drivers. He also began making go-karts under the Kalkart brand. In 1957, Callender imported a JBS 500 Formula 3 race car. He raced it in the New Zealand Grand Prix at Ardmore 1958 to 1961, as well as races Levin and Ohakea.Lovingly restored back to former glory, Rob Maetzig, Taranaki Daily News. Last updated 12:56 31 March 2012, retrieved 30 November 2015 Callender became president of the North Taranaki Motorcycle Club and held senior positions at the New Plymouth Speedway Club and the Auto Cycle Union. He ran events and also did announcing. In 1957, Callender started a motorcycle repair business called Callender Motorcycles. This in turn led to him making the Mountain Goat to meet the needs of the farming community. He also made hand controls for cars and wheel chairs to assist the disabled. Development In the early 1960s, Callender spotted a need for a motorbike specifically for use by farmers. He designed the Mountain Goat which was a small tough motorcycle that was designed to handle the rough off-road conditions on New Zealand farms. At that time farmers were primarily using horses, especially in the hill country. Those who were using motor bikes were converting imported British road bikes use on their farms. These bikes were generally heavy, high-geared, and impractical in the rough and rugged Taranaki hill country.Mountain Goat among farm bikes 3:24 PM Friday Jun 30, 2000, Mark Baker, New Zealand Herald, retrieved 30 November 2015 The specifications for the bike, developed in discussions with local farmers, were the ability to go at walking pace without slipping the clutch, have enough power to climb the steep hills, be rugged enough to withstand the rough farm tracks, and light enough to carry. The wheels needed to be discs because spoked wheels got caught in sticks and branches and the back tyre had to have enough traction to handle mud and grip hillsides. The prototype took two years to develop and in 1963 the bike was put on sale. It was powered by an 80 cc Suzuki motor with a four-speed gearbox, weighed 70 kg, unpainted, and had a low centre of gravity. The low gear enabled the bike to travel at walking pace and its top speed was 50 km/h. The rear tyre was from a rotary-hoe. Testing was carried out on the tracks around Mount Taranaki and up the mountain itself, although it never reached the summit. The prototype was used by Sir Edmund Hillary and Peter Mulgrew on their 1964 expedition to Nepal to build a schoolhouse in the Himalayas. Mulgrew had lost his feet to frostbite on Mount Makalu in 1961 and the bike was to enable him to move around independently as well as test the machine. Because the fuel tank was damaged in transit, he was only able to have limited use of it. It was Mulgrew who called the bike the Mountain Goat and that became its name. Production Production began in an old flour store in Devon Street, New Plymouth. The aim was to make 120 machines a year, but demand was higher after a flurry of articles in magazines and newspapers about the bike. Some were sold to Borneo and the New Hebrides. Problems soon arose with the government refusing to issue an import licence for the engines and brake hubs. While negotiations continued between Callender and the government, Callender sent a photo of the bike along with Hillary, Mulgrave, and himself to Suzuki in Japan. Suzuki turned the photo into a giant poster on their Tokyo Motor Show stand, along with a replica of the bike. In 1966, the government issued the import licence to allow enough parts to build the 120 bikes per year. By that time, Callender had decided to sell the business to Motor Components of Waitara. Motor Components planned to sell 1,000 bikes per year, but by then Suzuki had commenced production of its own specialised machine. They in turn were followed by the other major Japanese motor cycle manufacturers. Production at the Waitara plant stopped in the 1970s.Kiwi companies are poor making money, retrieved 30 November 2015 Callender sold his New Plymouth shop and moved to Auckland. He died in 1978 aged 50. In total, he sold about 120 Mountain Goats. In 2005, the original prototype was owned by his son Laurie.

The San Carlos Institute, also known as the San Carlos, is a Cuban heritage center and museum located at 516 Duval Street in Key West, Florida. The institute was founded in 1871 by members of the Cuban exile community with the goal of preserving and promoting the language, cultural values, and patriotic ideals of the Cuban people. Today, the San Carlos Institute is a multi-purpose facility that functions as a museum, library, school, conference center, theater, and art gallery for the Key West community. The institute maintains several permanent installations related to Cuban history and hosts a number of popular cultural and artistic events.  History  The San Carlos Institute was first established by members of the Cuban exile community who had taken refuge in Key West during the Ten Years' War (1868-1878). The effort was spearheaded by two prominent leaders of the exile community, Juan María Reyes and José Dolores Poyo, with the goal of creating a Cuban heritage and community center that would serve as host to cultural events, political meetings, and educational endeavors. Close- up view of San Carlos Institute's exterior architecture. On November 11, 1871, the San Carlos Institute officially opened its doors to the public at its original location on Anne Street. The growing institute was relocated to a larger facility on Fleming Street in 1884, but the building was severely damaged in a great fire that devastated much of the island of Key West in 1886. Under the guidance of Martín Herrera, a Cuban civic leader, the community went on to rebuild the San Carlos at its present location on Duval Street in 1890.  Cuban independence movement  The San Carlos Institute played a significant role in the Cuban independence movement as a meeting place where key figures of the movement could address the Cuban exile community of Key West, and one of its most notable speakers was the Cuban revolutionary José Martí. Beginning in January 1892, Martí made several trips to Key West to raise support, collect funding, and unite the divided exile community under the banner of a formal resistance movement against Spanish colonial rule. After several negotiation meetings with community leaders and the workers of local Cuban cigar factories, Martí called an assembly at the San Carlos Institute to announce the successful unification of the once- divided exile community behind the cause of Cuban independence. Martí's efforts in Key West and other exile communities in the United States would lead to the establishment of the Cuban Revolutionary Party (Partido Revolucionario Cubano, or PRC), a key step toward Cuba's victory in the Cuban War of Independence.  Deterioration and restoration  For over a century, the San Carlos Institute operated one of the first bilingual and racially integrated schools in the United States. Key West children of all races were invited to take classes taught in Spanish and English. In 1973, however, the San Carlos was forced to close all of its facilities, including the school, due to looming financial collapse and the deteriorating structural condition of the building. The building remained closed and in disrepair for nearly two decades. In 1981, the severely deteriorated San Carlos Institute was threatened with demolition after a sizable portion of the building's facade collapsed and injured a passing tourist. Faced with the reality of losing a historic Cuban-American landmark, the local Cuban community rallied to organize a state-wide effort to save the institute. With the helpful efforts of Florida's Hispanic Affairs Commission, the State of Florida agreed to aid in the restoration and preservation of the San Carlos Institute. The State provided $2.8 million in grants toward its restoration at the current Duval Street location. Miami attorney Rafael A. Peñalver, Jr. played a major role in the restoration project and the raising of financial support for the project. The San Carlos re-opened its doors in January 1992 with a three-day opening celebration. The Friends of Libraries U.S.A. later designated the San Carlos Institute as a Florida Literary Landmark and dedicated a plaque honoring José Martí's poetry, scholarship, and campaign for Cuban independence.  Exhibitions and events  The San Carlos Institute maintains several permanent exhibits that highlight the histories of Cuba and the Cuban-American community in Florida: * The Life and Works of José Martí: 1853 - 1895. This installation features a collection of photographs and documents that celebrate José Martí's life and contributions to the Cuban independence movement. * The Pichs Collection: Exploring Cuba's History through its Postal Stamps. This is an online exhibit and joint venture with the Smithsonian Institution's National Postal Museum that explores Cuba's postal history from 1830-1939. The project includes a second virtual exhibit titled \\"Cuba's Commercial Aviation History\\", which documents the history of commercial aviation between Cuba and the United States. * Portraits of Cuba's Presidents. This exhibit features a portrait collection of Cuba's constitutional presidents from 1902 to 1952. * History of the San Carlos Institute. This exhibit documents the history of the San Carlos Institute from its inaugural opening in 1871 to the opening year of the exhibit in 2008. The San Carlos also hosts and sponsors a number of cultural, historical, and artistic events throughout the year: * Key West Literary Seminar. Held each January, the Key West Literary Seminar offers a series of readings, writers workshops, and panel discussions with famous writers from around the world. Many of the seminar's main events take place in the San Carlos Institute's 375-seat theater. * Key West Film Festival.

He attained the rank of major general, and was notable for his command of the 39th Infantry Regiment in France during World War I, and his post-war command of the Army's tank school, 23rd Infantry Brigade, 5th Infantry Brigade, and 2nd Infantry Division. He closed his career as commander of Third Corps Area and interim commander of the First United States Army, positions in which he supervised training exercises designed to prepare units for overseas service as the Army began to expand at the start of World War II. Early life James Kelly Parsons was born in Rockford, Alabama on February 11, 1877. He was the son of Catherine \\"Kate\\" (Kelly) Parsons and Lewis E. Parsons (1846–1916), a lawyer who served as United States Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama. Parsons' grandfather, also named Lewis E. Parsons (1817–1895), was provisional Governor of Alabama after the American Civil War, and was elected to the United States Senate during the Reconstruction Era, but was not allowed to take his seat because Alabama had not yet attained full readmission to the Union. Parsons attended the schools of Birmingham, Alabama. In 1898 he was commissioned for the Spanish–American War as a first lieutenant in the 3rd Alabama Volunteer Infantry, a unit of African American soldiers and white officers. His regimental commander was Robert Lee Bullard, and Parsons' connection to Bullard helped Parsons receive a commission in the regular army and continue his military career. Early career Parsons remained in the United States Army after the war with Spain, receiving his commission as a second lieutenant in the 20th Infantry in 1899. He served in the Philippine Insurrection until 1901, when he was promoted to first lieutenant in the 28th Infantry, and later that year transferred back to the 20th Infantry. He graduated from the Infantry and Cavalry School in 1904. In 1908 he received promotion to captain, and his assignments at this rank included command of Company F, 20th Infantry Regiment in Hawaii. He was promoted to major in 1917. In the years before World War I Parsons served as mustering officer at Camp Glenn near Morehead City, North Carolina, and then as an observer and advisor with the New York National Guard. World War I At the start of World War I Parsons was promoted to temporary lieutenant colonel and then temporary colonel, and assigned to the staff of the American Expeditionary Forces in France. He later served as commander of the 39th Infantry Regiment, 4th Infantry Division. He was gassed during a German attack on October 11, 1918, and was relieved by Troy H. Middleton. In 1919 Parsons received the Distinguished Service Cross for heroism as commander of the 39th Infantry. In addition, he received the Army Distinguished Service Medal for his post-war command of the Embarkation Center at Saint-Nazaire, which processed American service members for their post-war return trips to the United States. Interbellum After the war Parsons returned to his permanent rank of major. He was promoted to permanent lieutenant colonel in 1920 and permanent colonel in 1923. His assignments included again serving as inspector and advisor for the New York National Guard, and serving on a board to recommend armory locations, training sites, and unit types and sizes for the Indiana National Guard. Parsons graduated from the United States Army Command and General Staff College in 1923, the United States Army War College in 1924, and the Naval War College in 1925. He received promotion to brigadier general in 1930 and major general in 1936. Note: The headline incorrectly indicates 9th Field Artillery. The body of the article correctly states that Parsons commanded the 9th Coast Artillery District. In 1930 and 1931 Parsons commanded the 9th Coast Artillery District in San Francisco. He was commander of the 23rd Infantry Brigade at Fort William McKinley, Philippines from 1931 to 1933, and the 5th Infantry Brigade at Vancouver Barracks, Washington from 1933 to 1936. Advocate of integration In the 1920s Parsons was recognized as a proponent of racial integration, in contrast to most of his professional colleagues. In 1924 the Army War College surveyed commissioned officers about whether and how to integrate Army units. At the time, African Americans served in segregated units, usually under white officers. Based on his experience in the Spanish–American War and his observations of African American soldiers during World War I, Parsons argued for desegregating army units and having each one incorporate a set percentage of black soldiers. In his view, black soldiers could be expected to perform capably if given the same training as whites, and incorporating them into units with whites would prevent them from being singled out for inferior duties like kitchen patrol and the loading and unloading of cargo. Parsons was convinced that African Americans could also serve as officers, although his point of view was that they would not be able to lead white soldiers effectively due to the prejudice of the times, but could instead aspire to command positions in the transportation and supply units that often contained large numbers of black soldiers in wartime. The army did not agree with Parsons' recommendations, and continued to allow African Americans to serve only in segregated units, and with few opportunities for assignment to leadership positions. Advocate of mechanization Parsons commanded the Army's tank school at Fort Meade, Maryland in 1925, and then again from 1929 to 1930. While at the tank school he developed plans for a mechanized army that were not adopted at the time, but which were similar to the designs for the armor and infantry divisions the United States Army fielded in World War II. World War II Parsons commanded the 2nd Infantry Division at Fort Sam Houston, Texas from 1936 to 1938, and from 1938 until 1940 he commanded the Third Corps Area with headquarters in Baltimore, Maryland. In 1938 he also served as interim commander of First United States Army. As corps area commander, Parsons oversaw the planning, execution and evaluation of exercises designed to assess the fitness of units, staffs and commanders as the army expanded and increased readiness at the start World War II. Development of new field jacket While in command of Third Corps Area, Parsons oversaw development and fielding of a new field jacket, the M-1941, which was used by the army throughout World War II. Parsons had launched the project after identifying a need to replace the wool coat then in use with an outer garment that was lightweight, water repellent, and windproof, and could incorporate a liner for warmth during the winter. Retirement In February 1941 Parsons reached the mandatory retirement age of 64 and concluded his military service. Parsons died aboard the ship RMS Caronia on November 8, 1960 while in port at Venice, Italy. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery, Section 1, Site 325-B. Family In 1904 Parsons married Volinda Lucy Henderson (1880–1957) in Columbus, Ohio. Volinda Parsons was the daughter of Charles G. Henderson and Ellen Beatty, the granddaughter of Union Army General John Beatty, and a 1904 graduate of Vassar College. James and Volinda Parsons had no children. Awards In addition to the Distinguished Service Cross and Army Distinguished Service Medal, Parsons also received the Purple Heart for wounds received while in command of the 39th Regiment during World War I.

He was educated at the Danville Academy and became involved in the coal industry at Pottsville within one or two years after graduating. From 1862 to 1881, he was involved in running a line of vessels at Havre De Grace shipping coal to the south and west. However, in 1881 he returned to Danville due to poor health and became involved in a number of local industries. He also was on the Board of Trustees of the Danville State Hospital beginning in 1883 and was its president beginning in 1886. Early life Boyd was born on April 23, 1826 on a homestead in Rush Township, in Northumberland County, Pennsylvania, from Danville. He was born to John C. Boyd (from Chester County) and Hannah (Montgomery) Boyd (daughter of General Daniel Montgomery), who married in 1820. Both of his parents were of Scotch-Irish descent. The Boyd family came to America from Ireland in the early 1700s. Daniel Montgomery Boyd was named after his maternal grandfather, who was also the namesake of Danville, and was the second of seven children. Boyd's education came mostly from the Danville Academy, which was founded by his great-grandfather. After graduating, Boyd spent one or two years at his home in the countryside. Career One or two years after graduating from the Danville Academy, Boyd relocated to Pottsville to get involved in the coal industry, where, according to J.H. Beers' 1915 Historical and Biographical Annals of Columbia and Montour Counties, Pennsylvania, he exhibited a \\"capacity for organization\\". He was involved in the opening and development of many mines in the Shamokin Coal Basin and, with his business partner, was one of the first to introduce improved coal breakers to the area. He also constructed railroads and worked as a relatively prominent mine operator. In 1850, he was one of the initial stockholders for the Trevorton, Mahanoy, and Susquehanna Railroad. In 1862, Boyd went to Havre de Grace, Maryland to establish a line of vessels to ship coal to the south and west. His company was known as Hilles, Boyd & Company. The operation proved to be highly lucrative. However, in 1881, he retired from this work due to poor health and returned to Danville. In Danville, once Boyd's health recovered, he became involved in a number of the borough's industries, becoming president of the First National Bank and the Danville Nail Company. He also became part of the Board of Trustees of the Danville State Hospital in July 1883. In October 1886, he became president of the Board of Trustees. He remained with the board until declining health forced him to resign. Personal life, death, and legacy Boyd married twice during his lifetime. His first wife was Caroline A. Bockius, daughter of Samuel Blockius of Germantown; they married in 1869. After her death in 1878, Boyd married Ida Cottrell, daughter of Joseph W. Cottrell of Columbia. This union produced two children: Daniel Montgomery and Elsie M. Boyd and his family were all members of the Presbyterian Church, and Boyd was a trustee of the church. He was a Republican throughout his entire life. Boyd built a house in Queen Anne style at 5 Bloom Street in Danville in the 1880s. He was living in this house as late as 1899, the year of his death. Boyd suffered from a serious attack of influenza in the winter of 1897/1898 and his health never fully recovered. He died on July 4, 1899 at the age of 73. According to J.H. Beers' Historical and Biographical Annals of Columbia and Montour Counties, Pennsylvania, Boyd was \\"one of the men to whom Montour County owes a debt of gratitude for his share in its development and prosperity\\". He provided aid in getting many of Danville's industries to a financially stable state and contributed to the social and business development of Danville. An 1899 book described him as a \\"liberal supporter financially of all worthy enterprises\\".

He was a member of the Imperial chapel ('Hofkapelle'), Vienna, and of the Tonkünstler-Societät, and vice-Pedell of the University of Vienna. He was born in Braunau, Bohemia (now Broumov, Czech Republic).Titze, Ludwig. Österreichisches Musiklexikon. Verlag der Österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften (2002–2015) Online edition. . Retrieved 30 November 2015. Possessor of a sympathetic and highly trained tenor voice, with a very pure style of execution, Titze was universally popular. He sang at the 'Concerts Spirituels' founded in 1821 by Franz Xaver Gebauer, and after Gebauer's early death in 1823 acted as choir-master, Karl Holz being leader, and Baron Eduard Lannoy conductor. Between 1822 and 1839 he appeared at 26 concerts of the Tonkünstler-Societät, singing the tenor solos in such works as Handel's Solomon, Athalia, Jephtha and Messiah, and Joseph Haydn's The Creation and The Seasons, associated in the latter with Josef Staudigl after 1833. From 1822 he also sang at innumerable concerts and soirées of the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde. His special claim to distinction, however, was his production of Schubert's songs at these soirées. He sang successively, Rastlose Liebe (29 January 1824,Deutsch, p. 97 and 1831); Erlkönig (1825); Der Einsame (1826); Nachthelle (1827); Norman's Gesang (March 8, 1827, accompanied by Schubert on the piano, and 1839); Gute Nacht (1828); Der blinde Knabe, and Drang in die Ferne (1829); Liebesbotschaft and Auf dem Strome (1832); An mein Herz Sehnsucht and Die Sterne (1833); besides taking his part in the quartets Geist der Liebe (1823 and 32); Die Nachtigall (1824); Der Gondelfahrer (1825); and the solo in the Song of Miriam (1832). At the single concert given by Schubert, March 26, 1828, he sang Auf dem Strome accompanied on the French horn by and on the piano by Schubert. These lists show that Schubert's works were not entirely neglected in Vienna during the composer's lifetime. His name appears in the programmes of the Gesellschaft soirées 88 times between 1821 and 1840. Titze is mentioned in an anecdote about the creation of Schubert's song Hark, hark! the lark.

EPR uses hypothermia, drugs, and fluids to \\"buy time\\" for resuscitative surgery. If successful, EPR may someday be deployed in the field so that paramedics can suspend and preserve patients for transport. EPR is similar to deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) in that hypothermia is induced. However, the purposes and procedures of EPR differ from DHCA. DHCA induces hypothermia to aid preplanned surgery, whereas EPR is an emergency procedure in cases where an emergency department patient is rapidly dying from blood loss and will not otherwise survive long enough for the patient's wounds to be stitched up. In EPR, blood is replaced by a saline solution, and the patient is cooled into a suspended state where metabolism is slowed and brain activity ceases. This gives the surgeon perhaps an hour to close the wounds before a warming and recirculation procedure is applied. Human trials began in the 2010s. The trial procedure involves rapidly inducing profound hypothermia (10 °C) with an aortic flush in trauma victims that have suffered cardiac arrest and failed standard resuscitative efforts.Kutcher, M. E., Forsythe, R. M., & Tisherman, S. A. (2016). \\"Emergency preservation and resuscitation for cardiac arrest from trauma\\". International Journal of Surger, 33, 209–212. History right Peter Safar, the \\"father of CPR\\", and Samuel Tisherman began researching EPR in Pittsburgh in the 1980s, publishing their first results in 1990. New Scientist credits the first demonstration of \\"swiftly replacing blood with salt water – cooling and effectively 'killing them' to save them\\" to trials on pigs by Peter Rhee and colleagues at the University of Arizona in 2000. Safar passed away in 2003; Tisherman continued animal experiments following Safar's death. Tisherman's research was aided by funding from the Department of Defense, which hopes to someday use EPR to treat soldiers in the field. Theory When a cardiac arrest patient arrives at an emergency department with gunshot or stab wounds, doctors have mere minutes to repair wounds and perform necessary resuscitative protocols. EPR is an experimental technique that attempts to improve the odds of survival by dropping the patient's temperature to approximately 10 °C, giving the doctor more time to find and stop the source of the bleeding before brain death occurs. Without oxygen, cells ordinarily can survive around two minutes at normal body temperatures; at EPR temperatures, metabolic rates slow down so that cells can survive for hours. In one EPR protocol, blood is replaced with a 10 °C saline solution using a catheter. The surgeon has perhaps an hour to repair the wound. A heart-lung bypass machine then restarts the blood flow. Next the patient is partially warmed up to about 34 °C, for 12 hours. In one experiment performed around 2006, 12 of 14 dogs survived EPR, whereas 0 of 7 dogs survived the CPR control group. EPR can utilize equipment like catheters and pumps found in any trauma center. In the future, advances in technology might allow a paramedic to use EPR in the field until a patient can be taken to hospital. Human trials Regulatory approval is complicated by the fact that victims of trauma and cardiac arrest are incapacitated and therefore unable to personally consent to experimental treatment; therefore stringent \\"community consent\\" guidelines must be fulfilled in order to gain approval for the experimental EPR operation. Where community consent is obtained, as of 2014, the procedure can only be performed on patients 18 to 65 years old who have a penetrating wound, go into cardiac arrest within five minutes of arrival, and fail to respond to ordinary resuscitation efforts. According to Tisherman, \\"The patient will probably have already lost about 50 percent of their blood and their chest will be open.\\" Their chance of survival without EPR is less than 7 percent: \\"When patients have bled so much that the heart stops, we know that we have very little chance of saving them.\\" Tisherman hopes EPR can double the non-EPR survival rate. Tisherman officially launched the round of human trials in April 2014 at the University of Pittsburgh, but was stymied by a lack of qualifying patients; he resumed human trials in Baltimore, which has a higher homicide rate, around 2016. In 2018, Tisherman estimated that results would be available within the next two years. Samuel Tisherman, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, is the leader of a team that has successfully put a human being in suspended animation. Describing the successful operation as \\"a little surreal,\\" Professor Tisherman in November 2019 told how he removed the patient's blood and replaced with ice-cold saline solution. The patient, technically dead at this point, was removed from the cooling system and taken to an operating theatre for a two-hour surgical procedure before having their blood restored and being warmed to the normal temperature of 37C. Prof Tisherman says he will be producing a full account of the procedure in a scientific paper in 2020.

It has a population of barely a thousand people, with about 80 houses. The Island subsequently became the residence place of many dignified families of Goa. It also houses three parochial churches and possesses a chapel of two images of Christ held in great veneration by the Catholics of the place. The ruins of a fort are evident in the northern part of the village.  History  It claimed its blessed status due to the confluence of three branches of the Mandovi that flowed by the village. The Hindus called this confluence the tirth (holy water), that washed away their sins after a dip in its waters. Naroa was also home to the Temple of Saptakoteshwar that was held in high reverence by the Hindu populace, not just the locals but from far and wide. Once a bustling place of pilgrimage, the village of Naroa now seems lost, its many secrets, on the verge of submerging into the waters of the Mandovi.  Churches and chapels   Chapel of Our Lady of Candelaria  Chapel of Our Lady of Candelaria, Naroa, Ilhas and its altar A prayer and catechism house was constructed in 1563, which was later transformed into a chapel. The Chapel was erected the following year. The sanctuary of the chapel of Our Lady of Candelaria is round and topped by a dome, which is a unique character found in only two other chapels in Goa.  Fortress Chapel  The Jesuit priest Moren de Souza writes about the history of the Naroa church in his book Tisvaddecheo Igorzo (Churches of Tiswadi): The Holy Spirit Chapel is actually dedicated to St. Thomas \\"During routine inspection, one Portuguese commander found the fortress of Naroa practically empty. It seemed that being a Sunday, the entire garrison had gone to a neighbouring church for Sunday services. To solve this problem, the officials decided to construct a church there. Accordingly, the king of Portugal wrote a letter dated 8th March 1546 to Dom Joao de Castro and instructed him to build a church at Naroa and dedicate it to St. Thomas the Apostle. A document dated in the year 1710 reveals that Diogo da Silveira, captain of the fort of Naroa built this church. Though the church is dedicated to the Holy Spirit, a statue of St Thomas adorns the main altar.\\"  Tarir's Riverside Cross  A cross, built right on the edge of the river Mandovi. This ward is called Tarir, where all the vodekar (boatmen) of the area reside. They would sing the litany of this cross by standing in their own canoes in the river. It was believed that if the cross ever got submerged, the water would enter their homes. So to protect them from this calamity they would conduct the litany.  Naroa Fort  The peaceful ferry wharf that connects Illhas to Bicholim was once a hostile border between the Portuguese and the kingdom of Bijapur. Hence a fortress was erected to guard this entry point in the 17th century. Situated in the Island of Divar, which is opposite the old city of Goa, Ilhas, the fort, was originally built by the Muslims. It was abandoned in 1834 and is now in ruins. Though the fortress is in ruins, an old garrison church adjacent to the fortress still serves the locals. Though the church is dedicated to the Holy Spirit, a statue of St Thomas adorns the main altar. The church contains many graves, perhaps of its gallant Captains who now sleep peacefully, as all hostilities are put to rest.

Background  The album came at the tail-end of the group's commercial success with their Top 40 debut, Ultimate Spinach, a direct product of the marketing campaign known as the Bosstown Sound. However, the Sound's advertising had begun to have an adverse effect on the Boston bands that spearheaded the movement, leading to Ultimate Spinach's popularity to go on the decline by the time the group initiated recording sessions. Lead vocalist, multi-instrumentalist, and songwriter Ian Bruce-Douglas, again, fronted Ultimate Spinach throughout the recording process. For the album, female vocalist Barbara Jean Hudson was reserved to backing vocals while guest singer Carol Lee Brit is featured on \\"Where You're At\\". However, sessions were plagued by acrimony and hostility between Bruce-Douglas and his bandmates over both the pressures of repeating the success from their first album, and the group's disappointing performance at the Fillmore West. As a consequence, much of the band's playing is more subdued and dispassionate, and, overall, lacks the striking keyboard solos found on Ultimate Spinach. Still, as described by music critic Gary Burns, Behold & See is, like its predecessor, a concept album \\"unified by the darkly utopian vision and domineering personality of Bruce-Douglas\\".  Reception  Reception on the album is generally mixed, with Richie Unterberger, writing for the Allmusic website, being critical on Bruce-Douglas's lyrics, saying they \\"are unintentional hippie parodies without any irony or humor, whether solemnly aspiring to a beatnik state or indicting the straight world\\". Peter Lovell, while reflecting on Ultimate Spinach's role in the Bosstown Sound, writes that despite the album's shortcomings \\"fans will find plenty to like and Douglas comes off well. He's got the songs and the trippy lyrics and his playing is equal to the first album. His ideas are strewn though the LP\\". In a positive review, Gary Burns contemplates that Behold & See deserved better reception from critics at the time of its release, and was disappointed by the alterations made on the album's reissue.  Releases  The album was released in August 1968, and stalled at number 198 on the Billboard 200. Shortly after Behold & See was distributed, Bruce- Douglas departed Ultimate Spinach, and essentially disbanded the group, although an almost entirely new lineup would release one final album in 1969. In 1995, Big Beat Records reissued Behold & See remastered on compact disc. The effort was spearheaded by the album's original record producer Alan Lorber, and designated as the \\"director's cut\\". It is 10 minutes shorter than the LP version, with the song \\"Visions of Your Reality\\" removed, the track listing altered, and \\"Fragmentary March of Green\\", \\"Jazz Thing\\", and \\"Mind Flowers\\" also being edited.

Her posthumous memoir, Fearless Purpose: Memoir of Emily Elizabeth Parsons, gives a rare glimpse of the American Civil War from a nurse's perspective as she describes her work tending to Union soldiers and managing the nursing staff at Benton Barracks Hospital in St. Louis, Missouri. Early years Parsons was born in Taunton, Massachusetts, on March 8, 1824, the eldest of seven children. Her father was Theophilus Parsons, a lawyer and supporter of Abraham Lincoln, and Dane Professor of Law at Harvard University. Her mother was Catherine Amory (Chandler) Parsons. She grew up in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where she graduated from Cambridge High School. During childhood, an accident left her blind in one eye and scarlet fever left her partially deaf. Because of an ankle injury she suffered as a young woman, she was unable to stand for prolonged periods of time.  Training in Massachusetts and work at Ft. Schuyler  Harper's Magazine Illustration of Civil War Nurses Before the American Civil War, military nursing in the United States was dominated by men and was not viewed as a good career for women. However, the massive amount of illness and casualties on both sides of the war brought women of all ages and economic classes to the sometimes makeshift hospitals that were set up during the war. When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Parsons, at the age of 37, expressed a desire to assist the Union army by working as a nurse. Her father tried to dissuade her, since he felt with all of her disabilities, she would not be very useful as a nurse and might put her own health in danger. Nonetheless, she began training as a volunteer at the Massachusetts General Hospital. After eighteen months, she was put in charge of a ward of fifty wounded Union soldiers at Fort Schuyler Military Hospital on Long Island in October 1862. For two months, she performed nursing duties at Ft. Schuyler, sending letters back home that would later be published posthumously as her memoir. In her letters, she tells of preparing men for amputations and sometimes death while snow and rain poured in through the slats of the hospital roof, and the wind rocked the building outside. When her father again expresses concern that she is too sick to continue the life of a military nurse, she reminds him that she, like her brother, has committed to a military life: \\"Remember that I am in the army just as Chauncy is and I must be held to work just as he is; you would never think of requesting that he not be sent on picket duty because it was hard work.\\"Fearless Purpose: Memoir of Emily Elizabeth Parsons, Little Brown and Company, 1880, p. 45 Despite her commitment, her health continued to deteriorate, and she had to take a break from her responsibilities and return home. St. Louis and the Battle of Vicksburg Interior of Red Rover Civil War hospital steamship published in Harper's Weekly While recuperating, Parsons wrote to Dorothea Dix, superintendent of Union nurses who had actively campaigned for the rights of women to become military nurses, offering her services wherever they might be needed. She also befriended writer and political activist Jessie Benton Fremont, who recommended Parsons to the Western Sanitary Commission at St. Louis, and in January, 1863, Parsons left Massachusetts for St. Louis, Missouri. When she arrived, the city was crowded with sick and wounded soldiers, and available buildings were quickly being converted to hospitals.Humphreys, Margaret, Intensely Human: The Health of the Black Soldier in the American Civil War, JHU Press, 2010 , p. 6 She was assigned to the Lawson Hospital. She was only at the Lawson Hospital for a few weeks, when she was reassigned to the hospital steamship City of Alton, which travelled down the Mississippi River during the Vicksburg campaign. At Vicksburg, Mississippi, four hundred invalid soldiers were brought on board the ship, most of them sick with fever, many of them past recovery, and returned as far as Memphis, Tennessee. Black men and women escaping slavery were also brought on board. From the steamship, Parsons again sent letters home, writing of the clouds of exploding shells being fired back and forth between the Union and Confederate armies. In one anecdote, she tells of a freed slave walking past with creaking boots, and how another freedman calls out to her, \\"Ah Jane, your boots cry out for freedom!\\".Parsons, p. 54 Many of the wounded soldiers died on the passage up the river. During this period, Parsons contracted malaria. From that point on, she had recurrent bouts of fever. At Memphis, after the sick and wounded had been transferred to the hospitals, an order was received from General Ulysses S. Grant to load the boat with active soldiers and return immediately to Vicksburg. Parsons, along with the other female nurses, returned to St. Louis. Benton Barracks Hospital in St. Louis 19th Century Illustration of Benton Barracks, St. Louis In St. Louis, Parsons was put in charge of the Benton Barracks Hospital, the largest hospital in the American West, with 2,000 patients. Wounded black and white soldiers were segregated, with the main amphitheater turned into the hospital for black troops. Parsons' letters describe both the conflict and the hope that the wounded black soldiers brought. \\"There is too much a feeling among many here that they must be treated like inferior beings,\\" she says, \\"They are only inferior from neglect, that is, I hope I can see my way clear to do my duty by them and all.” As supervising nurse, she also spoke with women of the Colored Ladies Aid Society who had to fight for the right to sit on the street cars that travelled to the wounded black soldiers' hospital and told her \\"things that would make your blood boil.\\" The hospital, she writes, is doing more than taking care of the bodies of the black soldiers, \\"it is bringing to the surface facts, and establishing precedents with the enemy. It is storming the citadel.\\"Parsons, p. 141 She also trained the inexperienced women, black and white, who arrived at the hospital to volunteer their services as nurses. Under her management, the hospital's death rate was significantly reduced. Towards the end of the Civil War, the hospital began to treat the black freedmen and refugees of all races who were then pouring into St. Louis from the South. Even while she was suffering bouts of malaria, Parsons continued to direct the nurses at the hospital from her sick-bed. Though her decline in health eventually caused her to return to Cambridge, she continued to send boxes of gardening seeds and clothing to the freedmen and refugees at Barracks Hospital, so they could begin a new life in Missouri. Founding of Cambridge Hospital After the war, Parsons returned to Cambridge, and devoted the next six years to raising money for a hospital there. In 1869, she obtained a charter for what was then called Cambridge Hospital, located in a rented house. The hospital was only open until 1872, when it was forced to close due to lack of funds. However, it was re-opened again in 1886 after Parson's death and the name was changed to Mt. Auburn Hospital. Death and legacy Parsons died of apoplexy, or stroke, in 1880. She is buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery. Her father published selected letters she wrote to her family as a memoir after her death, with an introduction. Her work has been cited along with writings by Clara Barton, Susie Taylor and Louisa May Alcott as one of the few memoirs available to researchers on the daily lives of the 3,000 women who served as military nurses during the American Civil War.Frank, Lisa, Women in the American Civil War, ABC-CLIO 2008Massey, Mary Elizabeth, Women in the Civil War University of Nebraska Press, 1966Harris, Nini, A Most Unsettled State, First Person Accounts of St. Louis during the Civil War, Ready Press, 2012 Mt.

On 17 October the protests grew to include citizens and spread to Masan on 18 and 19 October. President Park Chung-hee declared martial law on 18 October and referred 66 people to military court. On 20 October, Park invoked the Garrison Act. The army was mobilized, and 59 civilians were brought to military court. Background The 1978 National Assembly election was held in December and was influenced by the government. Nevertheless, the ruling Republican Party was defeated by the New Democratic Party. In August 1979, female workers of the YH Trading Company () performed a lockout at the headquarters of the New Democratic Party. Because of the lockout, the ruling Republican Party expelled Kim Young-sam from the National Assembly, leading to the resignation of all opposition party members from the National Assembly. Progress The protests history is as follows: * 3 May 1979 - A national convention of New Democratic Party occurred, the moderate party representative Yi Cheol-seung defected, Kim Young-sam was elected. * 11 August 1979 - YH case occurred. * 4 October 1979 - The ruling Republicans expelled Kim Young-sam from the National Assembly. * 16 October 1979 - Bu-Ma Democratic Protests occurred. * 17 October 1979 - Chungmu police substation, the Korea Broadcasting System, and the Busan tax office were destroyed.

In 1887 he was called to the University of Wisconsin, and for eleven years developed and maintained a vigorous department of botany in that institution. In 1898 he became professor of plant physiology at the University of Chicago, and completed twenty-eight years as a university professor. At Hanover College he met John Merle Coulter as his instructor in botany, and from that time they became intimately associated, first as joint editors of the Botanical Gazette, and later as colleagues in the same university. He became a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1884 and a fellow in 1885; was secretary of the botanical section in 1894, secretary of the council in 1895, general secretary in 1896, and vice-president (chairman) of the botanical section in 1898, giving his retiring address at Columbus in 1899 on “The progress and problems of plant physiology.” He was secretary of the Botanical Society of America from its organization in 1894 to 1898, and became its president in 1903, giving his retiring address at Philadelphia in 1904 on \\"The theory of respiration.\\" In 1905 he was a delegate from the botanical section of the American Association to the International Botanical Congress at Vienna. The term 'photosynthesis' was coined by him in 1893. In 1883 Barnes became co-editor of the Botanical Gazette, a position he held for 27 years. Barnes died in Chicago, on February 24, 1910, from injuries sustained in an accidental fall.

History of the MMAC and its Permanent Collection  The Montana Museum of Art & Culture was established shortly after the founding of the University of Montana in Missoula, Montana. The year was 1895 and the state's flagship university, established in 1893, had its first President, Oscar J. Craig, and fifty enrolled students. A request to the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History in Washington D.C. for some specimens to support academic disciplines at the new university resulted in the first recorded donation, consisting of minerals, sea invertebrates, fish, and plants. While objects of a scientific nature are no longer a part of the museum, the MMAC's Permanent Collection has grown to include close to 11,000 works of art and cultural artifacts. At the turn of the last century, collections continued to be acquired and were initially housed on the first floor of the new University Hall, designed by architect A.J. Gibson. Locations within the “Main Hall,” as it has come to be known, changed several times, due to growth of the University. In 1912, the museum space was abandoned altogether to make way for a Law Library and the collections remained dormant until the conclusion of World War I. In the early 1920s, the University of Montana and museum experienced another period of intense growth. The first major donations from the estates of A.J. and Maud Gibson, John Ellsworth Lewis, and famous western artist E.S. Paxson established the foundations of the Permanent Collection. As the original several hundred minerals and objects from the sea became a teaching collection for the sciences, the museum's holdings expanded to include a vast treasury of fine art, sculpture, ceramics, textiles, furniture, and other important works from various cultures, countries, and periods. In 1937, Art Digest and Newsweek magazines praised the museum, the latter calling it, “the first art museum in the Inland Northwest.” A pivotal moment came in 1948 with the receipt of two significant donations of fine art by collector Stella Louise Duncan and Montana artist Fra Dana. Other notable donations included: Alfred F. Penard's collection of Native American artifacts; Robert Lehman's collection of 16th century Italian majolica; New Deal-era prints from the General Services Administration in Washington, D.C.; Carolyn McGill's donation of 1,200 objects; Helen Cappadocia's textile and book collection; the Ben Steele Collection of P.O.W. drawings and paintings; and the recent acquisition of European paintings and sculptures belonging to Montana Senator and “Copper King” William A. Clark. The strength of this diverse collection lies in works by celebrated artists from the Rocky Mountain West, including Rudy Autio, Fra Dana, Edgar Paxson, Frederick Remington, and Joseph Henry Sharp. The American holdings also include artists William Merritt Chase, Fra Dana, Rockwell Kent, Robert Motherwell, and Andy Warhol, among others. The Permanent Collection also features Contemporary Native American art including works by Percy Bull Child, Jim Denomie, Gloria Emerson, Jay Laber, Erica Lord, Neil Parsons, and many others. The collection of historic and modern European works of art ranges from a Greek ceramic vase from around the 3rd century to works by contemporary artists. Of particular note are works of art from the Middle Ages to the 19th century, including paintings by masters such as Jean-Baptiste- Camille Corot, Honoré Daumier, Eugène Delacroix, Jean-Honoré Fragonard, Jean- François Millet, and prints by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Giovanni Battista Piranesi, and Rembrandt Van Rijn. Among significant European artists from the 20th century are: Peter Blake, Marc Chagall, Salvador Dalí, Alberto Giacometti, Käthe Kollwitz, Joan Miró, and Pablo Picasso. Collections of vintage clothing and theatrical costumes, furnishings lent to historic home museums across the state, a collection of Asian art, including Southeast Asian textiles, and public art sited across the University of Montana campus round out the MMAC's Permanent Collection. Long-term loans to the museum include a collection of New Deal era prints Courtesy of the U.S. General Services Administration in Washington D.C. and modernists paintings and drawings from the Henry Meloy Collection. The MMAC acquires new works for its Permanent Collection through donations and, occasionally, through purchase. There is a designated fund for acquiring art by students at the University of Montana. The Collections Committee guides the scope and growth of the Permanent Collection by reviewing works for acquisition. The MMAC's present location in the Meloy and Paxson Galleries was made possible by the completion of the PARTV Center in 1985. Two spaces for exhibition and storage were designated for what was then known as the “Museum of Fine Arts.” In 1995, under the leadership of Museum Director and Curator Maggie Mudd, the galleries and new storage spaces were retrofitted with security and climate control. In 2001, the museum was renamed the “Montana Museum of Art and Culture” and was designated one of three state museums, along with the Montana Historical Society in Helena and the Museum of the Rockies in Bozeman. Barbara Koostra became director in 2008. In 2019, University of Montana Art History & Criticism Professor Dr. H. Rafael Chacón was named Bruce and Suzanne Director of the MMAC. The MMAC is an integral resource for the University of Montana's academic programs and demonstrates the importance that the University of Montana places on interdisciplinary education and cross-cultural understanding as well as public service. By way of its exhibitions, collections, and educational programs, the MMAC creates stimulating opportunities that benefit faculty members and students from across campus and the statewide community. As a center of education and visual exploration, the MMAC offers the community interdisciplinary learning opportunities that promote an understanding of diverse cultures through its Permanent Collection, traveling exhibitions, educational programs including student internships, workshops, lectures, artist talks, and gallery tours. The MMAC serves both the UM and regional community, including K-12 schools and lifelong learners.

Joseph A. Baldwin; November 29, 1943 - December 31, 2018) was an educator and psychologist whose theory and research has been particularly influential in areas relating to African (Black) Psychology, cultural survival in the face of cultural oppression, and mental health. A former National President of the Association of Black Psychologists (ABPsi), Kambon has published well over 60 scholarly articles, and has written five books, including two textbooks that are frequently used in Psychology and Black Studies courses across the country. In many of his published works, Kambon takes an Africrentric approach to the study of African Americans, suggesting that while Black personalities are biogenetic in origin, they are still subject to environmental variables that, when alien (not African), can serve to inhibit and interfere with normal development of the Black personality. He has developed various tools, including the African Self- Consciousness Scale (ASCS), The Worldviews Scale (WVS), and the Cultural Misorientation Scale (CMS), in order to measure personality, mental health, and social variables that relate to and may characterize the Black experience in the context of Western culture. Kambon retired from his position as Department chair and professor in the Psychology Department at Florida A&M; University in 2014 following a successful 30-year career at the institution. Early life Kobi Kazembe Kambon (a.k.a. Joseph A. Baldwin) was born in Jasper, Alabama, November 29, 1943. His mother, Mable E. Guyton- Baldwin was a schoolteacher and community-civic leader who died in 1996 at the age of 92. His father, Andrew Baldwin Sr., was first a coal miner and then a Baptist minister who died in 1969 at the age of 76. Kambon is the 9th of 10 children, with four sisters and five brothers. He attended Walker County Training School for junior high school and high school, and attended Wilson Jr. College in Chicago. Kambon was briefly drafted in the army from 1965 to 1967. Kambon later transferred to DePaul University in Chicago in 1969, where he received his bachelor's degree in psychology. He then went on to acquire a Master of Arts degree in personality-abnormal psychology from Roosevelt University (1971), and a Ph.D. in personality and social psychology from the University of Colorado in Boulder (1975). Academic career Kambon is a retired professor of psychology from the Psychology Department at Florida A&M; University. During his 30-year career at Florida A&M;, Kambon held the role of Department Chair from 1985 to 1997, and also served as Coordinator of the Community Psychology Graduate Program. Kambon's emphasis on Africentric views shifted the Psychology Department as a whole towards a more African centered perspective, and Kambon is credited with inspiring a dramatic increase in Psychology graduates of African descent from Florida A&M;, making it one of the highest producing departments in the country in that respect. Kambon has written, developed and contributed to well over 60 scholarly publications, five of which are books. He is the author of two text books, titled African/Black Psychology in the American Context (1998) and The African Personality in America (1992), that have been used and praised by scholars and students at institutions across the country. Kambon has also developed various instruments and measures to assess Black personality and mental health variables. Major contributions African (Black) psychology: issues and synthesis In his widely cited article African (Black) Psychology: Issues and Synthesis, Kobi Kambon provides a general overview of his Africentric approach to studying the psychology of Black Americans. He argues that while most Black psychologists recognize the need for a Black psychology, some fail to consider that it might be an undertaking that is entirely separable from Western Psychology. Kambon suggests that to study Black psychology as contained within Western Psychology is to ignore African cultural and philosophical antecedents, thereby framing modern Black psychology as a set of mere reactions to Western culture and oppression. Kambon calls much of this work \\"Western psychology in blackface\\", referring to the psychologists involved as conceptually incarcerated thinkers, stuck within a Eurocentric framework of psychology. Kambon insists that it is reasonable to conceptualize an African (Black) Psychology as existing independently of Western Psychology based on the fact that African cultures existed, and even preceded Western cultures. Race, he argues, \\"constitutes the principal binding condition underlying the evolution of definitional systems which in their most basic fundamental nature have a 'racial component'.\\" Thus, African psychologies initially evolved within African definitional systems. A problem emerges, however, when an alien definitional system, or worldview, is foisted upon a people for whom the worldview was not designed, and within which they are negatively viewed. This, Kambon argues, is the context in which Black individuals are expected to exist and thrive, despite the fact that a European reality structure is a definitional system that does not give legitimacy to African social realities. Given this cultural and psychological \\"incarceration\\", Kambon advocates for a Black psychology that allows African Americans to consciously resist European reality structures in favor of an African worldview that affirms their existence, thereby restoring what Kambon calls \\"Africanity\\" to its centrality in the Natural Order. Mental health of African Americans In much of his work, Kobi Kambon evaluates African American mental health issues in terms of an Africentric approach to African (Black) psychology. In his article African Self Consciousness and the Mental Health of African Americans he touches on the prevalence of mental health disorders in African American populations, and suggests that Western oppressive forces are extremely potent in their effects on African American psychology. Thus, Kambon frames mental health concerns of African Americans as distortions of the African personality from its natural condition. In order to explain such distortions of Black personalities, Kambon coins the terms African self-extension orientation and African self-consciousness. The African self-extension orientation is defined by Kambon as the biogenetic basis for African personalities, which Kambon argues to be innately distinct from European personalities. The ultimate expression of the African self-extension orientation is mediated by what Kambon terms African self-consciousness, which is under conscious regulation and is therefore sensitive to environmental context. This is to say that the full expression of African personalities is contingent on the alignment of the African self-extension orientation with an appropriate African culture, or \\"African cosmology\\". Any other reality structure, under Kambon's model, will inevitably prevent African personalities from developing naturally. Kambon refers to this process of distortion as a differentiation between the African self-extension orientation and African self-consciousness. Thus, differentiation yields basic disorder in the Black personality, which threatens the state of African American mental health in the United States. Kambon proposes that interventions are warranted in alleviating the burden of mental health on African Americans. The suggested interventions should be aimed at reconciling African Self Consciousness with African self-extension orientation. Such interventions would provide African social and institutional structures that serve to support and reinforce African Self Consciousness, such as Africentric educational institutions, religious institutions, social activities and rituals. Legacy Kobi Kambon has had a tremendous influence on the field of African (Black) psychology, contributing much to conversations about how a Black psychology should be defined and studied in relation to White psychology and culture. Straying from what Jackson (1979) terms the reactive and inventive approaches to a study of Black people, Kambon chose to focus solely on the psychology of African Americans as something uniquely African, and therefore functionally independent from White Psychology. This framework empowers people of African descent to seek out and embrace African cultural histories and worldviews, which fundamentally oppose European worldviews and their associated psychologies, according to Kambon. Kambon's position on these issues is quite profound, in that it completely challenges the theoretical underpinnings of Western psychology, and calls into question its ability to say anything meaningful or useful about African (Black) psychology. An appreciation of Kambon's arguments therefore points to a research approach that is entirely different from that taken up by Western Psychologists. Kambon has centered his research on this approach, and Black psychologists around the country have certainly been influenced by his Africentric model as well. Other scholarly works   Baldwin, J.

Description It grows as a high shrub, with greyish branchlets covered with fine fur. The leaves are generally divided and up to long and wide. Flowering takes place in September, with the oval or globular flower heads appearing at the ends of stems. They are in diameter, with the individual cream-yellow flowers long. The flowers fall to reveal an oval 2.2 cm diameter cone that bears the seeds. The flowers are partly hairy, which distinguishes the species from I. anemonifolius and I petiolaris, which both have entirely hairless flowers. Taxonomy The species was first formally described by botanist Donald McGillivray in 1975 from material collected by him at Angourie in 1967. The species name is derived from the leaves' resemblance to a menorah. McGillivray noted its existence had been overlooked until 1966 due to its similarity to the widespread Isopogon anemonifolius. He held it to be related to Isopogon dawsonii. Distribution and habitat Isopogon mnoraifolius is found only in northeastern New South Wales in the vicinity of Grafton, where it occurs along the coast east from Angourie south to Minnie Water and the Coaldale district. It is found on clay or sand soils, in open heathland or on woodland margins. Its habitat is threatened by development. Cultivation Isopogon mnoraifolius has horticultural potential as a rockery plant or pot plant, although it flowers less than other isopogons. Good drainage is needed. It can be propagated readily by cuttings.

Taxonomy The first scientific collector of the species was Allan Cunningham, who described it as Isopogon petiolaris in his notes.

In 1891, German botanist Otto Kuntze published Revisio generum plantarum, his response to what he perceived as a lack of method in existing nomenclatural practice. Because Isopogon was based on Isopogon anemonifolius, and that species had already been placed by Richard Salisbury in the segregate genus Atylus in 1807, Kuntze revived the latter genus on the grounds of priority, and made the new combination Atylus petiolaris for this species. However, Kuntze's revisionary program was not accepted by the majority of botanists. Ultimately, the genus Isopogon was nomenclaturally conserved over Atylus by the International Botanical Congress of 1905.

It was named after its original builder, Judah Baker, who constructed the mill in 1791. Like many Cape Cod windmills, the windmill experienced several moves before moving to its current location at 89 River Street in Bass River, located within the Historic District of South Yarmouth. The windmill faces west to Bass River, adjacent to the waters of Nantucket Sound, and is located on an area with a small boardwalk and beach.  History  Judah Baker built his windmill in 1791 at Grand Cove in North Dennis, Massachusetts to grind corn. The original structure had a cone-shaped roof and two dormers, one dormer that was for the mast and power shaft, and the other dormer was for the tail pole. The windmill was then sold to Captain Freeman Crowell and moved to East Dennis, Massachusetts. In 1886, the windmill was then moved by Captain Braddock Matthews to South Yarmouth. Seth Baker bought the windmill from Captain Matthews in 1875. Seth operated the windmill until his death in 1891. Seth's son Joseph sold the mill in 1893 to William Stone. The mill no longer operated. A storm in 1916 damaged the mill. Charles Henry Davis assumed the guardianship of the mill and he moved it down the street to its present location. A deal was made in 1953 where the Town of Yarmouth took over the responsibility of the windmill.  Restoration  thumb Judah Baker Windmill was completely restored both in 1973 and 1999. The interior structure, the shake shingles, the cupola, the mast and the tail pole were all rebuilt, replaced and restored. The mill was authentically rebuilt and restored using hand-hewn lumber where possible. The interior has the original mechanical equipment that the wind powered and stones that ground the grain. In 2003, the exterior wooden shingles have been restored. Today the mill has been authentically rebuilt and restored and still contains the original mechanical equipment. The equipment dates back to its original building at over 224 years old. thumb  Management  Today the Judah Baker Windmill is managed by volunteers and the Town of Yarmouth. Tours of the windmill are given seasonally to the public.

The volcanoes are distributed in a string-like pattern clustered from North to South in the middle on the Tengchong basin and are characterized by post-collisional high-Potassium (K) calc-alkaline series eruptions. The TVF provides unique geographical and geological knowledge as understanding the geological processes of creation provides insight into aspects such as the history of volcanism during the Quaternary Era in the region and as well as compositional information of its source and crustal assimilants. The TVF can be visited in the Tengchong Volcanic Geothermal National Geological Park.\`  Geology   General overview and history  The volcanic field is located geographically in China but geologically more closely related to Southeast Asia's volcano zones. The TVF is a product of one of the most important events that transpired in the Cenozoic Era, the Indo- Asian continent-continent collision which occurred ca. 59 Ma. The result of the collision was the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau along with Asian continent acidification (the release of CO2 due to volcanic activity), global climate change, tectonism and volcanic activity associated with the TVF. Prior to continent collision during the Paleozoic, the Tengchong block was located along the Indian margin of the Gondwana. High resolution tomographic data revealed evidence for an eastward under thrusting of the Indian continental lithosphere into the asthenospheric mantle underneath the TVF. This indicates that prior to continent collision, the Tengchong block along with the Burma block overlaid the subducted Neo-Tethyan oceanic lithosphere. There are a total of 68 volcanoes all of which are pyroclastic cones and around 25 of these still bear recognizable craters and cones. In addition to the volcanoes, there are 58 hot springs in the TVF all derived from the Quaternary Era. The volcanoes in the TVF are typically concentrated in clusters along a string- like north-south pattern. Of the 68 volcanoes, there are three that are still considered active today based on their measured geothermal activity. These volcanoes are Maanshan (Saddle Peak), Heikonshan (Black Emptied Peak), and Dayinshan; Dayingshan being oldest of the three volcanoes and last erupted in CE1609 documented by Chinese geographer Xu Xiake (1587-1641). The crust averages thick in the TVF whereas to the North-South the crust is measured to be on average thick. The lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary is roughly deep in the TVF and deep in the surrounding regions.Fan, Q., Ma, M., King, D.T., Li, S., Zhao, Y., and Zou, H (2017), Genesis and open-system evolution of Quaternary magmas beneath southeastern margin of Tibet: Constraints from Sr- Nd-Pb-Hf isotope systematics, Lithos, 272-273, 279-290.  Petrology and petrogenesis  The TVF is predominantly composed of volcanic rocks that follow a high potassium calc-alkaline (HKCA) suite formed by post-collisional continent subduction of the Indian slab and regional extension (extensional tectonics). The rocks found in this region are basalt, dacite welded tuff, basaltic trachyandesite and trachyandesite.Jiang, C., Wan, J., Wang, Y., Wei, H., and Zhang, X (2006), Tectonic controls on the late Miocene-Holocene volcanic eruptions of the Tengchong volcanic field along the southeastern margin of the Tibetan plateau, Journal of Asian Earth Science, 2007, 275-389. These rocks where extruded out as lava flows and pyroclastic material. The origin of the rocks present in the TVF can be categorized into three eruption stages deduced by systematic K-Ar Dating.Daming, L., Qi, L., and Wenji, C (2000), Volcanic activities in the Tengchong volcanic field, Yunnan, China is Pliocene, Science Press, 3, 362-370. (1) Basalt and olivine basalt forming during the late Miocene to Pliocene (5.5-4.0Ma and 3.8-0.9Ma) (2) Acid rocks (silicic igneous rocks) forming in the Pleistocene (0.8-0.1Ma). (3) Basalt and intermediate-acid rocks form during the late Pleistocene to Holocene (0.1-0.01Ma).Jiang, C., Wan, J., Wang, Y., Wei, H., and Zhang, X (2006), Tectonic controls on the late Mioene-Holocene volcanic eruptions of the Tengchong volcanic field along the southeastern margin of the Tibetan plateau, Journal of Asian Earth Science, 2007, 275-389. The largest of rock distribution in the TVF is characterized by the rocks formed during the Pleistocene (2) indicating that volcanic activity was greatest during this phase. Andesitic lavas comprise the most recent volcanic rocks. The basement rocks are dominantly composed of Precambrian metamorphic rocks underlain by sedimentary and igneous rocks including limestones, sandstones, mudstones, and granitoids followed by volcanic-sedimentary sequences. As eruptions progressed with time, the MgO content in the volcanic rocks decreases whereas the K2O content increases. Chemical variations in HKCA suite exist due to derived petrological variations in the rocks. This includes partial melting of an enriched primitive mantle derived magma source by subducted clay-rich sediments which formed the trachybasalts (a volcanic rock with a composition between trachyte and basalt). Then followed by mantle-derived magmas forming the basaltic trachyandesites and trachyandesites originating from the lower crust by from a process called assimilation-factional crystallization (A process by which magma crystallizes with the addition of crustal material inside the magma chamber and/or the conduit of which the magma flows through).  Structure  The TVF is located near the intersection of several faults and thrusts. It rests on what is known as the Tengchong block which is simply a region that is an extension of the southern Tibetan Plateau. The Tengchong block is bounded by the Sagaing Shear Zone and the Tsangpo Suture located to the West, and the north–south trending strike-slip Jinsha-Red River Fault and the dextral strike-slip Gaoligong shear zone located to the East and the Ruili fault to the southeast. Within the TVF, the India-Asian continent collision created a fault system that consists of predominantly north–south trending strike-slip faults. The strike-slip fault system within the nuclei of the Tengchong block includes the major faults such as the Longchuanjinang Fault, the Binlanghinag Fault and Dayingjiang Fault.  Current geothermal activity  The Rehai Geothermal Field (RGF) is the largest and most active geothermal field in the TVF. A low-velocity zone indicated by seismic surveys and a highly conductive body recorded by magnetic surveys underlie recent volcanoes located in the RGF providing evidence of an active crustal magma chamber. In addition, the seismic data indicates that the magma chamber beneath the TVF is unstable which indicates a potential risk for future eruptions. Present-day hydrothermal activity best characterized by the hot springs in the TVF are fueled by heat generated from below the RGF.  Magma-derived CO2 emissions  The TVF is a contributor to global climate change. Emissions of CO2 have been calculated to be around 4.48 x 106ta-1 to 7.05 x 106ta-1 of total flux outgassing. These emissions have a measurable role in global climate change because of two main counter-acting reasons. The uplift of the TVF sequesters carbon because soil production is faster atop mountain ranges where soil removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by trapping atmospheric carbon dioxide in limestone. However, in contrast, syn-collisional volcanism, post- collisional volcanism, subduction zone metamorphism and present-day hydrothermal activity in the TVF results in augmented levels of global carbon by releasing it as atmospheric carbon dioxide.  Eruptions  5750 BCE This was the last confirmed large-scale eruption of the Tengchong volcanic field. It produced basaltic and andesitic lavas. 1609 CE A possible explosive eruption may have occurred at this time as well as an earthquake swarm, though reports are few and uncertain.  Tengchong Volcanic Geothermal National Geological Park  The Tengchong Volcanic Geothermal National Geological Park (腾冲地热火山国家公园) is a national park in China that features the Tengchong volcanic field and several of its other features. The park's main entrance is situated at the base of the three largest extinct volcanic cones (all of which are in close proximity with each other). The volcanoes are covered in vegetation and visitors can take hiking trails up to their summits. There is also a geologic museum situated near the main entrance. Another volcanic feature, the Rehai geothermal field, is the central tourist attraction of the park. It features hot springs, fumaroles, geysers, and extensive limestone terraces as well as hiking paths with views of the features.

She served as a parliamentary deputy and advocated broad social legislation benefiting mothers. Biography Teresa Noce was born in Turin, Italy on 29 July 1900 to an unmarried, working-class mother. She started working as a turner in the local Fiat Brevetti factory at the age of ten. By the age of 12, she was involved in the workers' union and joined demonstrations. As a journalist she wrote for Il Grido del Popolo (The People's Cry) and Ordine Nuove from 1914 to 1917. She protested when Italy entered World War I in 1915 and joined the Young Socialist movement in 1919. Following the rise of Mussolini and the Fascists, Noce left the Socialists, becoming a founding member of the Italian Communist Party (PCI) in 1921. After the Communist and Socialist parties were outlawed in 1925, she continued organizing workers illegally. During the 1920s, she oversaw the Communist Youth Federation and their periodical La voce della gioventù. She met PCI functionary Luigi Longo, whom she married in 1926. The two emigrated first to Moscow then to Paris. Noce organized a strike of rice workers in the Spring of 1934. She then fled to Paris and surfaced as a leading political figure among the Italian exile community. As editor of Il Grido del Popolo, Noce called for improved labor conditions for the working class and for abolition the Special Tribunals used to imprison anti-Fascists. She also led a campaign on behalf of imprisoned PCI leader Antonio Gramsci that resulted in mass demonstrations in Paris. She edited the anti-fascist periodical La voce della donne in 1934. In 1936, she travelled to Spain to see the Spanish Civil War. She penned several pamphlets reporting and appealing on behalf of the Spanish Republicans. After France surrendered to Nazi Germany in 1940, Noce remained there, organizing cells among the Italian exile community in Paris. She led an effective partisan unit as a member of the underground and adopted the nom de guerre Estella. Though she avoided arrest on a number of occasions, she was eventually arrested and deported to Ravensbrück, the German concentration camp for women. She was freed in the Spring of 1945 and returned to Italy. In 1947, Noce was elected as the general secretary of the Italian Federation of Textile Workers, becoming the first woman to lead a major Italian industrial trade union. She served until 1955, when she became the general secretary of the Trade Union International of Textile and Clothing Workers, and then as president of its successor, the Trade Union International of Textile, Leather and Fur Workers Unions. In Italy Noce was elected to the Central Committee of the PCI. She was then elected to the Italian Parliament and was appointed general secretary of the textile workers union, where she founded the publication La voce dei tessili. In 1951 she was one of two dissenting votes in the Communist leadership to against a proposal made by dictator Joseph Stalin. Noce was aligned with the Unione Donne Italiane (Italian Women's Union). She and other women of the Italian Parliament campaigned for comprehensive maternity legislation. They secured victory in 1950 with a law protecting working mothers, providing for children of infants and giving five months of paid leave for pregnant women. Noce died in Bologna on 22 January 1980.

He is a former WBO Latino Minimumweight and WBC Latino Light Flyweight champion. Professional career Tello made his professional debut in 2006. After a quick 6-1 start to his career, he fought veteran Edwin Diaz for his WBO Latino minimumweight title, and won by TKO on February 23, 2008 for his first belt. After four more wins, he received a shot at the interim WBO Minimumweight title, but lost (in lopsided fashion) to Mexican fighter Manuel Vargas in Hermosillo by UD on February 14, 2009. It was his first fight outside Panama. One year later, he received another world title shot when he fought Giovani Segura, again in Mexico, for his WBA Light Flyweight title. The bout, held on February 20, 2010, was stopped in Segura's favor in the third round after he landed several punishing uppercuts and hooks on the young Panamanian. Tello lost consecutive bouts to world title contender Carlos Melo in November 2010 and March 2011, both by decision. However, Tello followed this up by defeating fellow countrymen Carlos Ortega twice within a span of a 17 months. This earned him a third world title shot. He fought Alberto Rossel for the interim WBA Light Flyweight belt in Callao, Peru on March 16, 2013. During the later rounds of the fight, Tello came close to getting knocked down various times, but survived all 12 rounds. However, the judges scored the bout 118-115, 118-114 and 117-111, all in favor of the hometown favorite, Rossel. Tello won his second championship belt when he defeated Erick Flores (for the third time in his career) in Panama City on June 4, 2014 by fifth-round TKO to win the vacant WBC Latino Light Flyweight title. Flores abandoned the fight after an injury to his right shoulder. Tello traveled to Shanghai to fight Randy Petalcorin for the interim WBA Light Flyweight title. Tello was knocked down in the seventh round with a right hook. Tello rose up, but was knocked down again shortly thereafter by a left cross. After the second knockdown, referee Raul Caiz, Sr. stopped the fight and awarded Petalcorin with the belt.

She authored around 150 papers, many co-authored with her husband Warren Harmon Lewis. The Lewises developed a growth medium called the Locke-Lewis solution and jointly received the Gerhard Gold Medal from the Pathological Society of Philadelphia.  Early life and education  Margaret Adaline Reed was born in Kittanning, Pennsylvania, on November 9, 1881, to parents Joseph C. and Martha A. (Walker) Reed. From 1897 to 1901 she attended Goucher College (then known as Woman's College of Baltimore), where she earned an A.B. After graduation she studied at Bryn Mawr College, Columbia University, and the Universities of Zurich, Paris, and Berlin, but never earned a graduate degree. At Bryn Mawr and Columbia she researched regeneration in amphibians and crayfish, and assisted noted embryologist Thomas Hunt Morgan.  Career  Mammalian in vitro culture In 1908, Margaret Reed researched in Berlin in Max Hartmann’s lab where she performed probably the first in vitro mammalian cell culture with guinea pig bone marrow by explanting the bone marrow and placing it into a nutrient-rich agar produced by fellow lab researcher Rhoda Erdmann and incubating the sample. A few days after doing so, she found that some of the nuclei exhibited characteristics of mitosis. This discovery was revisited by Margaret Reed after she married Warren Lewis, in 1910. In their combined efforts, the Lewises found that cell proliferation with their media selection and methods seemed only to occur in tissues common to all organs, such as connective tissue and blood vessel endothelium. Since the Lewises main interest was microscopic cell structures, their objective was to create optically clear media, which led to the creation of the Locke-Lewis solution. This medium is composed of salt solutions supplemented with bouillon and dextrose. The tissue grown in this medium was prepared in a method that become known as the “Lewis Culture” where the tissue bits were put into a hanging drop on the underside of a thin glass slip. In the Locke-Lewis solution, the more robust cells, such as fibroblasts and macrophages, had a tendency to migrate out of the explant and flatten, making them easy to observe under high magnifications. Cell biology Lewis was among the first scientists to observe the dynamics of mitochondria in living cells. In 1915 Margaret and Warren Lewis published a comprehensive analysis of the shapes and movements of mitochondria in cultured cells. Lewis's pioneering time-lapse studies included observations of mitochondrial movement toward and away from the centrosome, mitochondrial fission, and mitochondrial fusion. In the same paper, Lewis presented perhaps the first descriptions of stress-induced mitochondrial fragmentation and mitophagy. Embryology Lewis and her husband helped develop and put into practice the first experimental systems for observing and understanding somatic cell physiology in complex organisms, which demonstrated that the behavior of these autonomous cells had a significant relationship to the development, infection, immunity, physiology and development of cancer for the organism. As a result, their work served to establish the importance of cellular behavior. As a result, this couple’s greatest impact on embryology and cell biology in the twentieth century was teaching later generations of biologists the basic factors involved in tissue culture based on what they had learned from their research. The Lewises saw a place for the findings on the cell related to embryology as well, and expressed this perspective to the president of the Carnegie Institution of Washington when they wrote to him that knowing the extent of a cell’s permanent individuality must be determined before it is possible to understand how they cooperate and are integrated into a tissue. This perspective is what gave Margaret and Warren Lewis their place in the Department of Embryology at the Carnegie Institution. With so many avenues opened by cell culture to explore, Margaret Lewis and her husband diverged in their area of study, with Margaret Lewis choosing to focus on microbiological problems, which involved close observations of chick embryo intestines reacting to typhoid bacilli in the medium in which it was grown. Through the tissue culture techniques the Lewises had developed, these studies showed that infections and diseases were cellular phenomena in that infection was observed in an isolated system but the events occurred in a way that would be observed in an organism as a whole. In her work with chick embryos, Margaret Lewis studied connective tissue formation within the tissues as well as outside of an environment where factors involved in coagulation are present. Lewis observed that the connective tissue fibrils resulted from the cytoplasmic transformations of the cells. In her studies of explanted tissue cultures, Lewis noted that the cells choose to migrate away from the tissue sample and divide as individual cells, resulting in loss of the tissue’s characteristic appearance. However, she also made the distinction that the cells do not become more embryonic like Champy and others claimed, but instead lose their differentiated appearance as a tissue. This spreading of the cells and lack of characteristic tissue form caused fibril development in many tissue cultures to be lacking; however, there were a few cultures where connective tissue fibers did develop, and their progression could be tracked. She observed that fibrils start as delicate lines in the exoplasm and become bundles that are passed between cells. Lewis also found no evidence of vacuoles forming fibrils as was believed to be the case by other researchers. Cancer In 1951, Lewis isolated a spontaneous epidermoid carcinoma in a mouse lung, which became known as a Lewis lung carcinoma. This carcinoma was one of the earliest tumors that could be transplanted and used to determine if a compound had potential as an anticancer agent. It has played a significant role in more recent tumor models used in metastatic and angiogenesis studies as it is a highly malignant carcinoma, producing tumors when it was transplanted and increasing metastatic growth after the subcutaneously implanted carcinoma is removed. Some of Margaret Reed Lewis’ research in the mechanics of cancer included myeloid infiltration and strangulation-induced atrophy of tumors in rats. In her study on myeloid infiltration, Lewis found that this phenomenon occurred in the adrenals but was not common to all subjects tested with tumors. However, tumor growth seemed to be associated with the progression of neutrophilia in peripheral blood and myeloid hyperplasia in certain organs. In the tumor atrophy paper, Margaret Lewis showed that tumor tissue inactivated in environments devoid of sufficient circulation and continued to stay in this arrested state when transplanted to other rats. This led to absorption and resistance to viable tumor implantation. Teaching Between 1901 and 1912, Lewis held several teaching positions. She was an assistant in zoology at Bryn Mawr College (1901–1902); a science teacher at Miss Chapin's School, lecturer in physiology at New York Medical College for Women (1904–1907); lecturer at Barnard College (1907–1909), and instructor of anatomy and physiology at the Johns Hopkins Hospital Training School for Nurses (1911–1912). Marriage In 1910 she married Warren Harmon Lewis, also a cell physiologist. The Lewises collaborated on many research projects over the years, including the discovery that macrophage cells derived from monocytes and were not separate cell types. Whether working on an independent or collaborative project, the couple worked alongside each other in lab and consulted with each other on their findings. Their children were Margaret Nast Lewis, who became a physicist, Warren R. Lewis, who worked as an engineer and atomic physicist, and Jessica H. Lewis, who was an associate research professor. Later life, legacy and death As a female scientist in the early twentieth century, Margaret Reed Lewis was not able to push her own achievements in her field of work, but she with her husband was able to further develop tissue culturing techniques and demonstrate how single cells impacted the organism as a whole. In 1915 Lewis joined the Carnegie Institution of Washington. In 1940 she was elected to the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia, and was an honorary life member of the Tissue Culture Society. Lewis with her husband was awarded a William Wood Gerhard Gold Medal by the Pathological Society of Philadelphia in 1958 because of their contributions to pathology. Lewis died on July 20, 1970, at the age of 88.

In a NoRMA architecture, the address space globally is not unique and the memory is not globally accessible by the processors.

The entire storage configuration is partitioned statically among the processors. The advantage of the NoRMA model is the ability to construct extremely large configurations, which is achieved by shifting the problem to the user configuration.

A 1996 history of the Association, in a 9-page section headed \\"The Bevan-Brown Era\\", describes him as outstanding for his \\"warmth of personality, breadth of educational background, quality and variety of professional experience\\" and his \\"major contribution to mental health, psychiatry and psychotherapy\\".Manchester, op. cit., p 10 Professor Wallace Ironside, then Professor of Psychological Medicine at Monash University, Melbourne, thought Bevan-Brown was \\"impressive\\" with \\"a Viking quality\\" to his appearance, but the Dean of Medicine at the University of Otago) warned him to steer clear of Bevan-Brown for the sake of his reputation: doctors thought Bevan-Brown \\"somewhat eccentric and perhaps a bit off the planet\\".Manchester, op. cit., p 114 Daily visiting of children in hospitals was an issue taken up by Bevan-Brown in 1950. It had been hospital policy to keep parents away for the days or weeks a child might need for treatment.Dobbie, op. cit. p 27 He argued that this was not just cruel but would cause psychological problems. The North Canterbury Hospital Board was unimpressed, the chief pediatrician at Christchurch Hospital putting an advertisement in the Christchurch Press headed 'Do Mothers Want to Kill their Children?' — the implication being that parents would take germs into the hospitals if they visited.Kedgely, op cit., p 170 The Sources of Love and Fear Bevan-Brown published two books.

In it she reports Helen Brew as saying The sources of Love and Fear spread \\"like a forest fire\\" and quickly went out of print, sending \\"shockwaves through the medical and psychological professions\\" which then dismissed him as a crank.Kedgely, op. cit., p. 177 The 1960 edition of The Sources of Love and Fear includes a review of the earlier editions by Grantly Dick Read [sic: no hyphen], calling it \\"a most acceptable book\\" whose value goes beyond the medical field into sociology, that should be studied by everyone concerned with the well-being of mother and child.Bevan- Brown, Sources (1960) p v11 Helen Deem of the Plunket Society declined to review the book, saying it would not be in the interests of the Plunket Society for her to do so, because some of its contentions, based on psychoanalysis, were highly controversial. Linda Bryder's history of the Plunket Society says it can't have helped that a contributor to the book said some of the advice of Plunket nurses filled her with \\"horror ... dismay and despair\\".Bryder, op.cit, p. 119 Psychiatrist Dr Ian McDougall commented in 1996 that the book now feels old fashioned and slightly preachy, but much in its basic messages is \\"consistent with contemporary attachment theory, object relations and self psychology\\" and it \\"contributed significantly to the changes we take for granted 50 years later\\".Manchester, op. cit., p 117 Central to Bevan-Brown's thinking was the importance of the sensuous mother- child breastfeeding relationship, going so far as to say that there were \\"risks attaching to the development of any baby who has the misfortune not to be breast-fed. [His emphasis]Bevan-Brown, Sources (1960), p 17 Freud had used the word \\"sexual\\" to describe the feelings experienced by both the mother and the infant in this \\"copulative\\" process, but he preferred to use the word \\"sensuous\\".Bevan-Brown, Sources (1960), p. 19 The Plunket Society would have none of that, supporting breastfeeding for the physical well-being it promoted which was conducive to sounder psychological well-being, \\"but would go no further towards psychological benefit\\".Bryder, op. cit., p 120 In the 1960 edition of The Sources of Love and Fear, Bevan-Brown added a preface saying Dr Wattie Whittlestone of the Ruakura Agricultural Research Centre in Hamilton, a world expert in lactation, had confirmed from his own experiments on mammals what Bevan-Brown had said about the emotional elements in breast- freeding.Bevan-Brown, Sources (1960), p ix Dr Whittlestone confirmed this at a memorial lecture for Bevan-Brown in 1967, saying physiology now shows that \\"suckling does, indeed, bring about physiological changes ... identical with those associated with love.\\"Dobbie, op. cit. p 89 Bevan-Brown's other book, Mental Health and Personality Disorder was a compilation of his essays and talks.Bevan-Brown, Mental Health, passim. Parents' Centres Following their own unhappy experiences with hospital birth, Helen Brew and Christine Cole founded the Natural Childbirth Association in Wellington in 1952, with Bevan- Brown as one of the \\"innovative thinkers\\" who advised them, but the negative reaction to that name made them quickly change it to Wellington Parents' Centre.https://nzhistory.govt.nz/women-together/parents-centres-new-zealand accessed February 9, 1019 Helen Brew had been still at high school when she heard Bevan-Brown lecture, and was \\"hugely impressed\\".Bell, op. cit., p 3 His teaching greatly influenced the philosophy and direction of Parents' Centres in dealing with growing disquiet among mothers concerned about hospital childbirth's effects on them and their children.Bell, op. cit., p 16 The first national Parents' Centres conference was held at the hall of the Andover Street clinic, with participants on mattresses, marae style.Dobbie, op. cit. p 35 \\"Rooming-in\\" - newborn babies sharing a room with their mothers from birth onward - was an issue that divided Bevan-Brown and the Parents' Centres from the medical profession when the Centres considered federating at their conference in 1957, and needed official recognition. Professor Harvey Carey of National Women's Hospital supported rooming-in, but not for psychological reasons: he did not think a baby suffered from anxiety when it is born because it did not yet have a fully developed consciousness; parts of the brain were not yet developed. Bevan-Brown challenged him, asking \\"Where in the nervous system do you localise love?\\"Dobbie, op. cit. p43 Helen Brew describes Bevan- Brown as having \\"a quality of innocent bewilderment\\" at the amount of resistance to so many obviously healthy, sane and reasonable things he advocated.Brew, Helen, Maurice Bevan-Brown: a tribute, Parents' Centre Bulletin, No.31, May 1967, pp. l3 She said Sir Truby King came to Christchurch to ask Bevan-Borwn to take over the Plunket Society.Brew, loc. cit. Linda Bryder comments that King had no authority to make such an offer and the council would probably not have agreed because Bevan-Brown had resigned from the NZBMA, and his role would have cut Plunket Society off from the medical establishment.Bryder, op cit. p. 119 Sue Kedgely calls the offer ironic, and if Bevan-Brown had taken over, the Plunket Society \\"would undoubtedly have taken a very different course\\".Kedgely, op. cit., p 170 [King died in 1938.] For many years Bevan-Brown maintained 30 acres (12.1 hectares) of native bush at Kowai (now Kowai Bush), 6 km north of Springfield. For this the New Zealand Forest and Bird Protection Society awarded him its Bledisloe Medal in 1961.Obituary, op cit. He was a keen mountaineer who reportedly climbed the Matterhorn \\"many times\\", and had a good bass voice. He was a heavy smoker.Manchester, op. cit., p 11 He died in Christchurch aged 80, survived by two daughters. Two younger brothers, Frederic Vivian Bevan-Brown and Robin E. Bevan-Brown, both also doctors, predeceased him. The Clinic for Medical Psychology closed after his death.Manchester, op. cit., p 12 His papers are held by the Cotter Medical History Trust.

The Forth Bridge opened in 1890 at the Queensferry crossing, and only local branch lines approached the location. The North British Railway built new main lines and upgraded some existing lines. The increase in passenger traffic resulted in serious congestion at Edinburgh Waverley, which was extended and modernised in the years following 1890. Background In 1842 the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway opened its main line. It was an immediate success, showing that longer distance railways could be commercially viable. The easy availability of money in the following years resulted in a considerable number of Scottish railway schemes being promoted, and many were authorised in the 1845 Parliamentary session. Among them were railways aspiring to reach northwards from the central belt.John Thomas revised J S Paterson, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: Volume 6, Scotland, the Lowlands and the Borders, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1984, The Scottish Central Railway obtained authorisation to build from the Edinburgh and Glasgow line near Castlecary, to Perth by way of Stirling. The SCR opened in 1848, and in time connected with other railways north and east of Perth.Peter Marshall, The Scottish Central Railway: Perth to Stirling, Oakwood Press, Usk, 1998, The Edinburgh and Northern Railway was authorised on the same day in 1845 as the SCR; its line was to run from Burntisland, in Fife on the northern shore of the Firth of Forth, and to reach both Perth and Dundee by an inland route. In fact Dundee was to be reached by ferry, although even at this early date there was talk of a major bridge across the Tay. The line ended at Ferry-Port-on-Craig for a ferry to Broughty. At the Edinburgh end too, a ferry journey was involved, across the Firth of Forth. In fact passengers leaving the centre of Edinburgh for Dundee first took a train on the Edinburgh, Leith and Newhaven Railway to Newhaven, and then a ferry to Burntisland, and the E&NR; train to Ferry-Port-on-Craig. Their journey concluded with another ferry crossing, and then a final train journey on the Dundee and Arbroath Railway from Broughty Ferry to Dundee. The Forth Bridge approachesAt first the E&NR; route, being considerably shorter, (and much quicker than the stage coach journey that was formerly the swiftest,) was considered the better route, but in time the inconvenience of the ferry crossings became a serious disadvantage. For goods and mineral traffic they were even worse, requiring the contents to be physically transshipped from goods wagon to ship and so on.John Thomas and David Turnock, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: Volume 15, North of Scotland, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1989, The successor railway to the E&NR;, the Edinburgh, Perth and Dundee Railway, installed train ferries for goods and mineral traffic: the wagons were transferred on to rails on the ferryboats, avoiding the transshipping, but this was still an imperfect arrangement. In time the multiplicity of Scottish railway companies coalesced: the Scottish Central Railway became part of the Caledonian Railway, and the Edinburgh, Perth and Dundee Railway became part of the North British Railway. Incidentally, Ferry-Port-on-Craig station became renamed Tay-Port, and later Tayport. The Caledonian Railway and the NBR became deadly rivals, each seeking to establish monopolistic primacy in areas they served, while at the same time seeking to penetrate the rival's territory. The Caledonian became dominant north of the Tay and in the central belt and to Carlisle, while the North British Railway had a near-monopoly in Fife, rich in mineral resources, and also from Edinburgh to Berwick where it connected with partner railways in England. The North British sought to extend northwards, and to create its own route beyond Dundee to Aberdeen, but the two ferry crossings, of the Forth and the Tay, were a major limitation in addition to the competitive tactics of the rival Caledonian Railway. Construction of bridges over both the bodies of water was long on the agenda for the NBR, but it was the Tay that was bridged first. The engineer Thomas Bouch designed and built the Tay Bridge, which opened in June 1878. This transformed the pattern of railway services in Fife, and new routes for passengers, especially residential and excursion journeys, and minerals, became heavily used. The NBR had been acquiring minor railway lines, and running powers on others, to further its aim of reaching Aberdeen by an independent route, and the Tay Bridge integrated with them.The NBR never achieved a completely independent route to Aberdeen, being reliant on running powers over the Caledonian Railway line from Kinnaber Junction (near Montrose) northwards, and on the joint Dundee and Arbroath Railway. The Tay Bridge fell in December 1879, taking a train down with it; 75 persons perished in the Tay Bridge disaster. Beyond the human cost, there was a huge financial cost to the North British Railway, which at once set about commissioning a second bridge. It opened on 20 June 1887. The Forth Bridge The scene was set for completion of the most daunting step: the construction of the Forth Bridge. The capital commitment required was too much for the North British alone, and a consortium of railway companies formed a nominally independent subsidiary, the Forth Bridge Railway Company. As well as the North British Railway, the Great Northern Railway, the North Eastern Railway and the Midland Railway participated in the funding of the structure. The bridge was formally opened on 4 March 1890. Reaching the bridge The bridge crossed the Firth of Forth at Queensferry. As a major element in long-distance railways, the bridge would require appropriate connecting main line railways. The Parliamentary authority of a bridge at Queensferry had been given in 1873, although that was for a dual suspension bridge designed by Bouch. Obviously that could not proceed; nonetheless from 1873 the North British Railway must have been planning how it would arrange routes to lead to a bridge at Queensferry. The present Forth Bridge was authorised by Parliament in 1882. Queensferry was the location of a historic ferry crossing, and the ferry was rail connected in 1877 to give Dunfermline a better connection to Edinburgh. On the southern shore there was a branch to Port Edgar (for the ferry) from Ratho, on the Edinburgh and Glasgow line. On the north side, the Dunfermline and Queensferry Railway ran via Inverkeithing to a terminal at North Queensferry. Both of these lines were built as local, slow-speed single-line branches; moreover they were close to sea level, while the track on the Forth Bridge was carried at 361 feet (110 m) above high water. In addition, the important Fife coast area had only an indirect route to Dunfermline. The Fife coalfield was producing huge quantities of coal, much of which was exported through the harbour of Burntisland, and a more direct connection was essential. The priorities, then, were to build a main line railway to current standards to take trains from Edinburgh over the Forth Bridge and onwards to Dundee and Perth respectively; to connect the existing (and still growing) mineral lines in Fife to the new route; and to connect Burntisland to the Dunfermline area. The North British Railway was slow to recognise these necessities. The new lines To achieve the required connections, there needed to be these new lines: * Saughton Junction to Dalmeny, connecting Edinburgh to the bridge; * the Dalmeny loop from Winchburgh to Dalmeny, connecting from Glasgow and Falkirk to the bridge; * a line from the northern approach to the bridge to Inverkeithing; * a line from Inverkeithing to Burntisland; * new line connecting Kinross and Perth directly, known later as the Glenfarg line; * spurs at Inverkeithing and Dunfermline; * a deviation passing Cowdenbeath and running to Kelty. In addition the Kinross-shire route was to be converted to double track and upgraded, becoming part of the modern main line; similarly the portion of the Dunfermline and Queensferry Railway on from Inverkeithing to Townhill Junction was to be doubled and modernised. South of the Forth On the south side of the Forth Bridge, the immediate approaches ran to a new Dalmeny station, necessary at a higher level than the former station on the Port Edgar line. That branch joined in at Dalmeny station, and at the south end of the station two new main lines diverged from the old Kirkliston line to Ratho. Striking south east was the new Edinburgh main line, which joined in to the Edinburgh and Glasgow line at Corstorphine; the junction was later named Saughton Junction. The line was six miles long. The other new main line ran south-west in a long curve to join the Edinburgh and Glasgow line in the direction of Falkirk and Glasgow line at Winchburgh; this line was four miles in length. The North British Railway came very late to the realisation that these lines were necessary; it was only in December 1887 the Company deposited plans for the two new lines. The Glasgow Herald described the work in progress in 1889, in a very long article, only a small part of which is reproduced here. The line from the present-day Saughton Junction (then at the old Corstorphine station) to Dalmeny was to give direct main line access from Edinburgh to the bridge: > The Corstorphine and Dalmeny Railway: This line, though not the shortest, > was, it is safe to say, one of the easiest of all the new railways > [connecting with the Forth Bridge] to construct ... Still a great deal of > work had to be done before the line could be formed... Starting at Dalmeny > Station, about three-quarters of a mile from the bridge... the railway > diverges to the south-east, and takes as straight a line as may be for > Corstorphine, where it joins the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway... The first > part goes through undulating country, so that some work had to be done. Here > occurs the heaviest cutting on the line, half a mile long, and through that > most intractable substance, boulder clay. The contractor had to face the > excavating of 300,000 cubic yards... Emerging from this the valley of the > River Almond is crossed and ... an embankment nearly a mile long and in some > places 50 feet high was found necessary... The river itself is spanned by a > viaduct 230 feet long, and consisting of a central girder of 140 feet, and > one at each end of 45 feet... Passing Turnhouse Farm--where the farmers are > petitioning the company to have a passenger and goods station--and under the > Linlithgow Road, the line rises by easy gradients [then] descending by a > gradient of 1 in 140, the Bathgate Road is next reached...

The miserable little wayside place is being > converted ... into a large handsome station... We have an \\"island\\" platform > about 500 feet long, flanked with lines of rails and side platforms. The > station at Dalmeny will be abolished, that at the south end of the Forth > Bridge taking its place... The cost of the undertaking, without the land, > will be near £60,000.Glasgow Herald, 2 October 1889 Trains would be able to run direct from Glasgow to the bridge, by way of Winchburgh, but that line was late: > The Winchburgh and Dalmeny Line: In point of time of commencement and of > present advancement this railway is much behind the others. As will be > remembered, Parliamentary powers for its construction were only obtained > during last session, and these were got after an opposition which at one > time threatened to be fatal to the bill... The new line will leave the > Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway near Winchburgh Station, and running > northwards ... will join the new railway from Corstorphine at Dalmeny, close > to the south end of the Forth Bridge... the length of the new railway is > only 4 1/2 miles...

The > contractor is erecting a steam-navvy at a cutting near Humbie quarry, and a > similar mechanical means of excavation is to be employed in another cutting > at Humbie Farm... It is expected the work will be finished by the end of > March next year [1890]... The construction of the railway will probably > cost, excluding the price of land, about £45,000. The Corstorphine and Winchburgh lines were to come together at Dalmeny, where the Forth Bridge Railway would take over:For a time the new station at Dalmeny was named \\"Forth Bridge\\"; it was renamed Dalmeny for Forth Bridge on 28 April 1890; from Thomas, The North British Railway, volume 2. > The South Approach to the Bridge: This stretch of about three-quarters of a > mile, from the junction of the Winchburgh and Corstorphine lines at Dalmeny > to the south end of the bridge, belongs to the Forth Bridge Company. It > contains one deep cutting of about 80,000 cubic yards, partly in rock, and a > considerable embankment leading on to the bridge. Begun in May last year > [1890], the work is almost finished, at a cost of less than £10,000. In > addition, Forth Bridge Station, as it will probably be called, is in course > of erection. Inverkeithing lines The northern Forth Bridge approaches involved difficult engineering; the Inverkeithing station was resited, and the Forth Bridge approach line ran to the west of the North Queensferry line, running then through a 386 yard tunnel beneath Inverkeithing town. It then followed a shelf above the Inner Bay of Inverkeithing, then turning south-east, crossing the North Queensferry line on Jamestown Viaduct. Climbing at 1 in 70 the line now ran through North Queensferry Tunnel, 569 yards, joining to the immediate approaches of the Forth Bridge just south of the new North Queensferry station. An extinct volcano was encountered in constructing the route; the exceptionally hard material making the formation of the cutting difficult. > This new line, like the half mile or so of railway between the south end of > the bridge and Dalmeny, is the property not of the North British but of the > Forth Bridge Railway Company. The two form what are called the approaches to > the bridge. The north approach, two miles in length, was commenced ... in > September 1887. Owing to the extremely irregular and rocky nature of the > ground, the work, considering the shortness of the route, has been > excessive. There are two tunnels, one under Inverkeithing 400 yards long, > and the other, which is shorter, close to the end of the great bridge. > Besides these, there is a very heavy cutting, and two very large > embankments... The total amount of excavation and embankments is about > 300,000 cubic yards. The cost, including land, which is here very cheap, > will be about £90,000. North from Inverkeithing, the route followed the Dunfermline and Queensferry Railway, but the track was doubled, and the inconveniently located Comely Park station was relocated closer to the town. The line joined the eastward route of the old Dunfermline branch of the Edinburgh, Perth and Dundee Railway at Townhill Junction. A south-to-west curve was laid, from Touch South Junction to Touch North Junction, enabling direct running from the Forth Bridge towards Alloa. > A fine new station has been erected at Comely Bank, which in future will be > the station from Dunfermline on the new route to the north. On the West side > of the line are waiting-rooms and the ticket office, in front of which is a > spacious platform covered over by a verandah supported on neat cast-iron > pillars carrying girders. On the opposite side is an \\"island\\" platform with > all necessary accommodation for passengers. A number of local trains are to > be run to Dunfermline, which owing to the facilities which the Forth Bridge > supplies, may now be considered a suburb of Edinburgh, and the object of > erecting the island platform is to keep local trains standing at the > platform out of the way of the expresses. At Inverkeithing Junction a new > station has been erected and arrangements of the most complete description > have been made for carrying on the traffic here. A short distance North of > the station is the junction, where trains passing over the Forth Bridge will > be switched on to the routes they are to follow.Dundee Advertiser: 30 May > 1890 A new line was built along the coast to Burntisland, turning sharply east at Inverkeithing and running through Aberdour, keeping tight to the coast from there to join the old terminus at Burntisland. The Fordell Railway was lowered at the point of intersection to give a good gradient to the new main line. > When the abortive scheme of Sir Thomas Bouch for bridging the Firth of Forth > was still in the realms of potential existence, the North British Railway > Company acquired powers for constructing this line. Work had just been > started and the track staked off, when the bridge was abandoned. Nothing > more was done till the present bridge had been considerably advanced... The > railway, which is 6 miles 1560 yards ... long, extends from Inverkeithing to > Burntisland. Leaving the Inverkeithing and Dunfermline route a little to the > north of Inverkeithing station, it immediately trends north-eastward. At > first it is some little distance inland, but keeps parallel to the coast. > [In the Fordell estate,] a colliery railway from pits on [the] Fordel (sic) > estate crosses, running down to St David's on the coast. The colliery line > had to be lowered for about three-quarters of a mile, and this had to be > done in such a way as not to interfere with the mineral traffic... The Inverkeithing to Burntisland line was opened to goods and mineral traffic on 16 April 1890, but it was not ready for passenger operation, which did not start until 2 June 1890. Passenger trains from Edinburgh to the Fife coast lines at Kirkcaldy and beyond would now have a through route, superseding the old Granton ferry passage. At Inverkeithing too, a triangular junction was being formed, with a north spur enabling through running from the West Fife mineral lines to Burntisland. The line opened from Inverkeithing to Burntisland for goods traffic on 24 April 1890,Edinburgh Evening News, 24 April 1890 but it was not yet ready for passengers. Kelty, Kinross and Glenfarg The North British wanted to incorporate Perth into its network. There were already the Kinross lines, built independently by the Fife and Kinross Railway and the Kinross-shire Railway. These had been built as country branch lines with a dominant mineral traffic at the southern end, and they were not laid out for main line running. The North British was upgrading them to double track and main line running standards. The entry to towards Kinross from the south was particularly tortuous, curving off the Dunfermline to Thornton line sharply at Lumphinnans. A new line was being built improving the access, from south of Cowdenbeath, with a new Cowdenbeath station on the new line, and running to Kelty. The descent from Cowdenbeath to Kelty had long been subjected to mining subsidence, and much work had to be done to prepare the line for main line standards. In fact in the following years much work was necessary to keep the line fit. > A new line, 2 3/4 miles in length has been constructed between Kelty and > Cowdenbeath. The Kelty Fork, as it is termed, shortens the route by about > two miles. From Cowdenbeath Junction to Townhill Junction, a distance of > about three miles, the main line between Thornton and Dunfermline (North) is > run upon. A doubling of the existing line between Townhill Junction and > Inverkeithing has been effected. The railway from Kelty to Mawcarse Junction had to be doubled and upgraded: > This section is 10 miles in length. Hitherto the single line of railway had > been of little importance in regard to the general traffic of the country, > as it had a mere local use. Trains and passengers were not numerous; but at > its south end there was some coal traffic in connection with Cowdenbeath. > Henceforth it will form a part of the great East Coast route from London to > the North... Bridges... are very numerous, both as regards roads crossing > over the railway and the line passing above roads and small streams. All > these bridges have had to be taken down, and new ones suitable to the > increased breadth of the railway substituted... A considerable part of the > undertaking has been the taking down of the little old stations, and the > erecting of new and more commodious and improved ones in their stead... At > Kelty, where the new line from Cowdenbeath joins, the station is a handsome > one, with a commodious island platform. At the northern end, a new connection to Perth had to be built; it had to be built through very difficult terrain and it was expensive to build. It was known as the Glenfarg Line, running between Mawcarse Junction, a few miles north of Kinross, and Bridge of Earn, near Hilton Junction on the line from Ladybank. The North British Railway already had running powers from Hilton Junction to Perth over the Caledonian Railway main line. The Glenfarg line descended to Bridge of Earn at 1 in 75 and involved two tunnels as well as a sinuous line. > This new line is also well advanced. The contractors ... began operations in > September, 1887. As the greater part of the land was not procured, however, > till between the following January and March, the works were not fairly > commenced till the spring of 1888. The line leaves the existing railway at > Mawcarse, a station some two miles north-east of Milnathort, and it extends > with a general northerly direction for ten miles to Bridge of Earn, where it > joins the railway from Newburgh and Ladybank to Perth. The first three miles > of the route, rising by a gradient of 1 in 100 from Mawcarse to Damhead, > gave some work, though not so much as corresponding sections farther north. > A neat passenger station is being erected at Damhead [Glenfarg].

It became necessary to pierce the ridge [of a spur of the > Ochil Hills] by a tunnel about 500 yards long... The cost of this railway, > with that of the small Cowdenbeath section previously referred to ... will > probably be about £220,000. The bridge opens The Forth Bridge was formally opened on 4 March 1890. However, the North British Railway had been slow in completing the approach railways, and they were not ready. Trains for the Forth Bridge from the south had to use the old single line from Ratho via Kirkliston. On the north side, none of the major improvements were complete, and the Burntisland line and the Glenfarg line were not ready. For the time being only the Dunfermline local passenger trains and some mineral trains used the bridge. Although for the time being no main line trains used the bridge, a number of excursions used it: > Yesterday [14 April 1890] the first passenger trains to cross the Forth > Bridge from Dundee to Edinburgh were run from the Tay Bridge station. The > North British Company offered special facilities to the public, and nearly > 2000 people applied for tickets. Although three specials had to be > despatched in addition to the ordinary trains, the officials were able to > overtake the extra work without the general traffic being interrupted. Seeing the bridge itself was the objective for many people: > Considerable disappointment was expressed by the excursionists on crossing > the Forth Bridge, as they could not from the carriage windows command a > proper view of the structure, and consequently a large number proceeded by > train, boat and brakes to South Queensferry during the day.Dundee > Advertiser, 15 April 1890 Full opening of the bridge and approach routes On 2 June 1890 the Forth Bridge and the new routes approaching it were ready for full operation, and the new timetable, taking advantage of the new route opportunities, was adopted. Now at last the dramatically shorter journey times could be implemented, and a considerable increase in train movements took place, handling an equally large increase in traffic. The opening of the Forth bridge marked a huge advance in the position of the North British Railway. The other partners in the Forth Bridge scheme, the GNR, the NER and the Midland Railway had laid out considerable quantities of cash to build the bridge, miles from their own territory, and now expected to benefit. However the first days of operation were beset with serious organisational problems, centring on the inadequacy of Waverley station in handling the increased volume of traffic and remarshalling it. In those days most passenger trains exchanged portions, or single coaches, with other trains, and there was not the track layout at Waverley to achieve it. > The connections with the Forth Bridge having now been completed, the North > British Railway Company ran the first of their new trains from Aberdeen to > the south on Monday. From Aberdeen to London there are no fewer than six > trains on weekdays and a mail on Sundays, leaving at 3.30 p.m. and reaching > King's Cross at 5.45 a.m. and St Pancras at 7.20 a.m... The first train left > Aberdeen on Monday punctually at 6.20 a.m. Two powerful engines were put on. > There were not many persons in the station at the time of departure, but the > train had a very good complement of passengers... This train is timed to > arrive in Edinburgh at 9.42 a.m., where passengers are allowed eighteen > minutes for refreshments. > The first train due at Aberdeen from the south at 8.55 a.m. came in fully > two minutes before the advertised time, and was fairly well filled. The > train due here at 10.50 a.m. was, however, not so well up to time, arriving > at 11.30. The next, due at 1.35 p.m., did not come in until 2.48 p.m.; while > the one due at 6 p.m. only arrived at 7.15 p.m. Perhaps the train that > excited the most interest was that which was due at 8.30 p.m., being the > first that had a direct connection from London.

Tunnel collapse The North British Railway had more bad publicity coming. On 17 August 1890 there was a partial collapse in Winchburgh tunnel, on the Edinburgh and Glasgow main line; although the work was quickly repaired it caused disruption for some time. It reopened for single line working only on 5 September 1890.Dundee Advertiser, 6 September 1890 Waverley station The primary problem was the marshalling of train portions at Waverley, and passing the trains over the double track either side of the station. At that time many long distance trains combined and divided, giving through carriages from many remote places which had to be exchanged to other trains. Moreover even local trains conveyed individual vehicles, especially luggage and perishable vans, that had to be transferred to long-distance trains. The North British belatedly set about improving and expanding Waverley station. This was not easy because of the constrained location in a high amenity area, and hostility to railway encroachment was at a high level. Nonetheless, on 5 July 1891Smith and Anderson say 5 July 1890. the North British obtained Parliamentary powers to quadruple the line from Corstorphine (that is, Saughton Junction) in the west to Waverley, and from Waverley to Abbeyhill in the east. This involved duplicating the three tunnel sections. In addition Waverley station itself was much expanded, and when the work was completed in 1900 it covered 23 acres and had nineteen platforms. North Bridge was reconstructed and incorporated into the station structure; one-third of the cost was borne by the North British Railway, and the whole scheme at Waverley cost £1.5 million. The station was architecturally magnificent, although the baroque stone and joinery work in the booking hall was somewhat oppressive, and the pedestrian access from the street was still narrow and bleak. The North British set about building a hotel too; it opened on 15 October 1902. Smith and Anderson describe it: > There was accommodation for 400, including spacious bachelor suites let by > the year for \\"gentlemen residing in the city\\". Ground floor public rooms > included the Palm Lounge, Ballroom, Coffee Lounge, Supper Room and Reading > Room. All were elaborately decorated with mahogany panelling, silk wall > hangings, plaster friezes and Renaissance ceilings. As a landmark it was > superb and on a clear day the tower could be seen from the Forth Bridge > approaches with Arthur's Seat as a backdrop. It also complemented the > monuments of Calton Hill perfectly when viewed along Princes Street.W A C > Smith and Paul Anderson, Edinburgh's Railways, Irwell Press, Caernarfon, > 1995, The present day In 1890 there was bitter competition between the North British Railway and the Caledonian Railway, for the traffic northwards from central Scotland. When the railways of Great Britain were nationalised in 1948, they were brought under unified management, and the loss of traffic to road-based alternatives caused an examination of what were then duplicate routes. Naturally the Forth and Tay bridges continued in use, and the North British Railway route between them became the main line to Aberdeen, at the expense of the Caledonian Railway route via Strathmore. However the North British Railway route from Edinburgh to Perth via Cowdenbeath, Kinross and Glenfarg was closed, the Caledonian line via Falkirk and Stirling becoming the sole route. The end of the supremacy of the West Fife coalfield led to the collapse of the mineral railways serving it, and the spur connection towards the former Stirling and Dunfermline Railway and The West of Fife Mineral Railway closed. Accordingly the lines from Saughton Junction to the Forth Bridge, and the western connection from Winchburgh to Dalmeny remain (2015) in use, although the latter has a very limited usage. From the Forth Bridge through Inverkeithing to Burntisland is part of the main line from Edinburgh to Dundee. The route from Inverkeithing to Dunfermline and Cowdenbeath remains in use. The principal traffic is stopping passenger trains, which continue on the old Edinburgh, Perth and Dundee Railway route as far as a new station named Glenrothes.

Gallart was host of a Mega-TV television show named 'Descarao Por La Noche' (2017). Later on Gallart and Danilo Beauchamp merge to create a comedic sketch called Los HP (2019–present). Gallart has also been performing as the fill-in co-host of Mega TV's La Comay after Hector Travieso resigned from the show. No official word yet on Gallart taking over the role permanently, but he has been on La Comay since 2019. Biography Roque José Gallart Ortiz is the son of Roque José Gallart, Sr., himself a well-known radio announcer. Roque, Jr. would visit his dad's radio station and stay there until a school bus picked him up as a little kid. Roque, Jr. became interested in radio work during this era in his life. In 1995, at age 16, he was hired by the radio station where his father worked, 95X, in the Puerto Rican city of Bayamon. He studied communications at Universidad del Sagrado Corazon in Santurce. Acting Rocky the Kid became a well known radio host in Puerto Rico over the years, and his fame allowed him to branch out into other areas of the show business world, starting in 2010, when he participated in \\"Que Despelote! La pelicula\\", playing himself along fellow radio personalities, actors and friends Tony Banana and Billy Fourquet. He then re-joined Fourquet in a 2011 comedy film named \\"Que Joyitas!\\", where he again played a version of himself. In 2013, Gallart again played himself in Que Joyitas! II, in which he was featured in the movie's poster. The three movies that Gallart has been in have been released in local cinemas in Puerto Rico, and Que Joyitas! has been shown in the United States television on Cine Latino. Lo Sé Todo Following a severe boycott by sponsors of Kobbo Santarrosa's gossip show, SuperXclusivo, WAPA America took that show off the air, and then hired six people, including Pedro Juan Figueroa, Sylvia Hernandez, Topy Mamery and Gallart, to host a new television show named \\"Lo Se Todo\\" in 2013. \\"Lo Se Todo\\" became a successful and highly rated show in Puerto Rican television, but internal turmoil plagued the show almost from the beginning. During 2014, Gallart once played a Black character in the show, with monkey sounds played in the background. As a consequence, the network received several calls from complaining viewers, which led to Gallart issuing a public apology in which he stated his intention was never to offend anyone based on race, religion, birthplace or sexual preference, and a network producer to be fired. Early in 2015, Gallart decided to leave \\"Lo Se Todo\\" after his radio employer, SBS, told him he would not be allowed to work with them and at WAPA-America consecutively. Offered a contract by WAPA-America on 6 December 2014, Gallart did not sign it, deciding instead to keep working on radio. The contract offer by WAPA-America came only 4 days after Mamery, who had also left \\"Lo Se Todo\\" and whom Gallart had befriended, died of a heart attack. Following the news of his friend's death, Gallart cried on live television. In April 2015, Gallart declared on his radio show that \\"Lo se Todo\\" television personnel were victims of workplace harassment by show producer Niria Ruiz, also mentioning Joe Ramos in his comment, calling Pedro Juan Figueroa a hypocrite and traitor who never took the other hosts side against \\"Lo Se Todo\\" producers during arguments, affirming that Frankie Jay, another of the show's hosts, did so, and describing working conditions at \\"Lo Se Todo\\" as a \\"living hell\\". As a consequence of those statements, on 31 August 2015, WAPA-America sued Gallart for the amount of $2,000,000 dollars, accusing him of defamation. Move to Mega-TV On 9 March 2015, Gallart began a new television show on Mega-TV, a Hispanic channel in the United States. The show, named \\"Descarao' Por La Noche\\" was seen in Puerto Rico and various cities in the United States, including Phoenix, New York City, LA and San Francisco, Houston, Miami and Chicago, among others. Personal Gallart is married to \\"Lo Se Todo\\" host Jessica Serrano. Their first daughter as a couple, Emma Catalina Gallart Serrano, was born on 14 November 2015. He also has a son, Ricky, from an earlier relationship, and a step-daughter, Carolina. Gallart was arrested and briefly jailed in November 2013 by Puerto Rican police after allegedly sending threatening messages to a former girlfriend. He was released almost immediately when a judge found no cause against him.

E. Asher, Christopher Moseley, Atlas of the World's Languages, Routledge, 2009. See the map on pages 200-201. The town is situated on the south bank of the Yangtze river between Nanjing and Changzhou. It is thus at the intersection of China's Mandarin and Wu speaking regions. About 2.7 million Chinese live in the area where the Zhenjiang dialect is predominant.Da Yuan-yi, \\"A Review on the Dialect in the Transitional Belt in Zhenjiang,\\" Journal of Jiangsu University, July 2003. In ancient times, Zhenjiang spoke Wu. Today, Wu is the language of nearby Changzhou, as well as Shanghai and Zhejiang Province. Mandarin speakers from the North have been immigrating to Zhenjiang since the fourth century, gradually changing the character of the local dialect. In modern times, the city speaks a dialect that is transitional between the Eastern Mandarin of Nanjing, located just west of the city, and the Taihu dialect of Wu spoken in Changzhou, which is just east of the city. Zhenjiang dialect is comprehensible to Nanjing residents, but not to Changzhou residents. The issue of tones in the Zhenjiang dialect has been a topic scholarly study. Nanjing residents use the four tones of Mandarin, while Changzhou residents use seven or eight tones.Campbell, James, \\"Tones in Wu Dialects.\\" According to a study by Qiu Chunan, Zhenjiang dialect has five citation tones: Tone1 (42) (a sharp fall from pitch 4 to pitch 2, or yinping), Tone2 (35) (a rising tone or yangping), Tone3 (32) (slight falling tone or shang), Tone4 (55) (high even or qu), and Tone5 (5) (checked tone or ru).Qiu, Chunan. \\"Sandhi Patterns of Zhenjiang Dialect\\", Speech Prosody, 2012. Qiu's study used residents who had grown up in the Daxi Road area, where the standard form of the dialect is said to be spoken. The checked tone was a feature of Chinese spoken in the Middle Ages, but it is not part of Mandarin. Applying the theory of government phonology to the issue, Bao Zhiming noted that non-even tones become even when they appear before the high even, or 55, tone.Bao, Zhiming, “On the nature of tone”, Unpublished Ph.

Given a set of resources and a set of agents, the goal is to divide the resources among the agents in a way that is both Pareto efficient (PE) and envy-free (EF). The goal was first defined by David Schmeidler and Menahem Yaari.David Schmeidler and Menahem Yaari (1971). \\"Fair allocations\\". Mimeo. Later, the existence of such allocations has been proved under various conditions.  Existence of PEEF allocations  We assume that each agent has a preference-relation on the set of all bundles of commodities. The preferences are complete, transitive, and closed. Equivalently, each preference relation can be represented by a continuous utility function.  Weakly-convex preferences  Theorem 1 (Varian): If the preferences of all agents are convex and strongly monotone, then PEEF allocations exist. Proof: The proof relies on the existence of a competitive equilibrium with equal incomes. Assume that all resources in an economy are divided equally between the agents. I.e, if the total endowment of the economy is E, then each agent i\\\\in 1,\\\\dots,n: receives an initial endowment E_i = E/n. Since the preferences are convex, the Arrow–Debreu model implies that a competitive equilibrium exists. I.e, there is a price vector P and a partition X such that: * (CE) All agents maximize their utilities given their budget. I.e, if P\\\\cdot Y \\\\leq P\\\\cdot X_i then Y \\\\preceq_i X_i. * (EI) All agents have the same income in the equilibrium prices: for all i,j: P\\\\cdot X_i = P\\\\cdot X_j. Such an allocation is always EF. Proof: by the (EI) condition, for every i,j: P\\\\cdot X_j \\\\leq P\\\\cdot X_i. Hence, by the (CE) condition, X_j \\\\preceq_i X_i. Since the preferences are monotonic, any such allocation is also PE, since monotonicity implies local nonsatiation. See fundamental theorems of welfare economics.  Examples  All examples involve an economy with two goods, x and y, and two agents, Alice and Bob. In all examples, the utilities are weakly-convex and continuous. A. Many PEEF allocations: The total endowment is (4,4). Alice and Bob have linear utilities, representing substitute goods: :u_A(x,y)=2x+y, :u_B(x,y)=x+2y. Note that the utilities are weakly-convex and strongly-monotone. Many PEEF allocations exist. If Alice receives at least 3 units of x, then her utility is 6 and she does not envy Bob. Similarly, if Bob receives at least 3 units of y, he does not envy Alice. So the allocation [(3,0);(1,4)] is PEEF with utilities (6,9). Similarly, the allocations [(4,0);(0,4)] and [(4,0.5);(0,3.5)] are PEEF. On the other hand, the allocation [(0,0);(4,4)] is PE but not EF (Alice envies Bob); the allocation [(2,2);(2,2)] is EF but not PE (the utilities are (6,6) but they can be improved e.g. to (8,8)). B. Essentially-single PEEF allocation: The total endowment is (4,2). Alice and Bob have Leontief utilities, representing complementary goods: :u_A(x,y)=u_B(x,y)=\\\\min(x,y). Note that the utilities are weakly-convex and only weakly-monotone. Still A PEEF allocation exists. The equal allocation [(2,1);(2,1)] is PEEF with utility vector (1,1). EF is obvious (every equal allocation is EF). Regarding PE, note that both agents now want only y, so the only way to increase the utility of an agent is to take some y from the other agent, but this decreases the utility of the other agent. While there are other PEEF allocations, e.g. [(1.5,1);(2.5,1)], all have the same utility vector of (1,1), since it is not possible to give both agents more than 1.Note that a similar economy appears in the 1974 paper as an example that a PEEF allocation does not exist. This is probably a typo - the \\"min\\" should be \\"max\\", as in example C below. See this economics stack-exchange thread.  Topological conditions on the space of efficient allocations  PEEF allocations exist even when agents' preferences are not convex. There are several sufficient conditions that are related to the shape of the set of allocations corresponding to a specific efficient utility profile. GIven a utility-vector u, define A(u) = the set of all allocations for which the utility-profile is u. The following successively more general theorems were proved by different authors: Theorem 2 (Varian): Suppose all agents' preferences are strongly monotone. If, for every Weakly Pareto Efficient utility-profile u, the set A(u) is a singleton (i.e, there are no two WPE allocations such that all agents are indifferent between them), then PEEF allocations exist. The proof uses the Knaster–Kuratowski–Mazurkiewicz lemma. Note: The conditions in Theorem 1 and in Theorem 2 are independent - none of them implies the other. However, strict-convexity of preferences implies both of them. It is obvious that strict-convexity implies weak-convexity (theorem 1). To see that it implies the condition of theorem 2, suppose there are two different allocations x,y with the same utility profile u. Define z = x/2+y/2. By strict convexity, all agents strictly prefer z to x and to y. Hence, x and y cannot be weakly-PE. Theorem 3 (Svensson): If all agents' preferences are strongly monotone, and for every PE utility-profile u, the set A(u) is convex, then PEEF allocations exist. The proof uses the Kakutani fixed-point theorem. Note: if all agents' preferences are convex (as in theorem 1), then A(u) is obviously convex too. Moreover, if A(u) is singleton (as in theorem 2) then it is obviously convex too. Hence, Svensson's theorem is more general than both Varian's theorems. Theorem 4 (Diamantaras): If all agents' preferences are strongly monotone, and for every PE utility-profile u, the set A(u) is a contractible space (can be continuously shrunk to a point within that space), then PEEF allocations exist. The proof uses a fixed-point theorem by Eilenberg and Montgomery. Note: Every convex set is contractible, so Diamantaras' theorem is more general than the previous three.  Sigma-optimality  Svensson proved another sufficient condition for the existence of PEEF allocations. Again all preferences are represented by continuous utility functions. Moreover, all utility functions are continuously differentiable in the interior of the consumption space. The main concept is sigma-optimality. Suppose we create, for each agent, k copies with identical preferences. Let X be an allocation in the original economy. Let Xk be an allocation in the k-replicated economy where all copies of the same agent receive the same bundle as the original agent in X. The allocation X is called sigma-optimal if for every k, the allocation Xk is Pareto-optimal. Lemma: An allocation is sigma-optimal, if-and-only-if it is a competitive equilibrium. Theorem 5 (Svensson): if all Pareto-optimal allocations are sigma-optimal, then PEEF allocations exist.  Increasing marginal returns  PEEF allocations might fail to exist even when all preferences are convex, if there is production and the technology has increasing-marginal-returns. Proposition 6 (Vohra): There exist economies in which all preferences are continuous strongly-monotone and convex, the only source of non-convexity in the technology is due to fixed costs, and there exists no PEEF allocation. Thus, the presence of increasing returns introduces a fundamental conflict between efficiency and fairness. However, envy-freeness can be weakened in the following way. An allocation X is defined as essentially envy-free (EEF) if, for every agent i, there is a feasible allocation Yi with the same utility profile (all agents are indifferent between X and Yi) in which agent i does not envy anyone. Obviously, every EF allocation is EEF, since we can take Yi to be X for all i. Theorem 7 (Vohra): Suppose all agents' preferences are strongly monotone, and represented by continuous utility functions. Then, Pareto-efficient EEF allocations exist.  Non-existence of PEEF allocations   Non-convex preferences  PEEF allocations might fail to exist even without production, when the preferences are non-convex. As an example, suppose the total endowment is (4,2), and Alice and Bob have identical concave utilities: :u_A(x,y)=u_B(x,y)=\\\\max(x,y). The equal allocation [(2,1);(2,1)] is EF with utility vector (2,2). Moreover, every EF allocation must give both agents equal utility (since they have the same utility function) and this utility can be at most 2. However, no such allocation is PE, since it is Pareto-dominated by the allocation [(4,0);(0,2)] whose utility vector is (4,2). Non-existence remains even if we weaken envy-freeness to no domination -- no agent gets more of each good than another agent. Proposition 8 (Maniquet): There exist 2-good 3-agent division economies with strictly monotonic, continuous and even differentiable preferences, where there is domination at every Pareto efficient allocation.  Finding a PEEF allocation  For two agents, the adjusted winner procedure is a simple procedure that finds a PEEF allocation with two additional properties: the allocation is also equitable, and at most a single good is shared between the two agents. For three or more agents with linear utilities, any Nash-optimal allocation is PEEF. A Nash-optimal allocation is an allocation that maximizes the product of the utilities of the agents, or equivalently, the sum of logarithms of utilities. Finding such an allocation is a convex optimization problem: \\\\text{maximize} \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\log(u_i(X_i)) ~~~\\\\text{such that}~~~ (X_1,\\\\ldots,X_n) ~~~\\\\text{is a partition}~~~. and thus it can be found efficiently. The fact that any Nash- optimal allocation is PEEF is true even in the more general setting of fair cake-cutting. Proof: Consider an infinitesimal piece of cake, Z. For each agent i, the infinitesimal contribution of Z to \\\\log(u_i(X_i))is u_i(Z)\\\\cdot {d \\\\log(u_i(X_i))\\\\over d (u_i(X_i))} = {u_i(Z) \\\\over u_i(X_i)}. Therefore, the Nash-optimal rule gives each such piece Z to an agent j for which this expression is largest: \\\\forall j\\\\in[n]: Z\\\\subseteq X_j \\\\iff \\\\forall i\\\\in[n]: {u_j(Z)\\\\over u_j(X_j)} \\\\geq {u_i(Z)\\\\over u_i(X_i)} Summing over all infinitesimal subsets of Xj, we get: \\\\forall i,j\\\\in[n]: {u_j(X_j )\\\\over u_j(X_j )} \\\\geq {u_i(X_j)\\\\over u_i(X_i)} This implies the definition of envy-free allocation: \\\\forall i,j\\\\in[n]: {u_i(X_i)} \\\\geq {u_i(X_j)}  See also  *Weller's theorem - on the existence of PEEF allocations in cake-cutting. * More related theorems by Hal Varian can be found in. * Theorems about PEEF allocations in economies with production can be found in.

Biography Henry Last, his grandfather, was from Debenham in Suffolk and jumped ship to settle in South Australia. His wife was Mary Ann Bowden who had Cornish roots. They later settled in Adelaide. Henry's eldest surviving son, John Last, worked at an Adelaide stationer and bookseller. John and his wife had 3 children, Raymond and two younger sisters, all being diligent and studious. Raymond first attended North Adelaide Primary School, from where he went on to the Adelaide Boys’ High School, where another scholar and classmate was Mark Oliphant, who went on to become an eminent physicist and later, Governor of South Australia. Assisted by a State Bursary, he enrolled at the University of Adelaide, and though underage, obtained permission to start the medical course. A brilliant trio headed the Medical School — John Burton Cleland in Pathology, Thorburn Brailsford Robertson in Physiology, and Frederic Wood Jones in Anatomy. Last was top student in all but the final year, and graduated MB BS in 1924. In June 1939 Last and his second wife Margret, who had been Matron at Booleroo Centre District Hospital, set off for England in order to become a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons. With the start of World War Two in September 1939 they began work at the Emergency Medical Service at the North London Fever Hospital at Winchmore Hill, later to become an annexe of the Royal London Hospital. Here Last worked under Henry Souttar. As a member of the Australian Army Medical Corps Last was turned down by the British Army, so he was obliged to return to Australia to enlist there. MV Napier Star was torpedoed in the Irish Sea on 18 December 1940 (see List of shipwrecks in December 1940#18 December), only 28 of 99 people surviving, among which were Raymond and Margret Last. Raymond Last wrote an account of the event. They joined the British Red Cross Society and Last led a surgical team, his wife Margret being principal nurse, that formed part of the British forces sent to end the Italian occupation of Abyssinia. Last spent three years there, becoming personal physician to the Emperor Haile Selassie and his family. The closing year of the War saw Last heading a medical unit in Borneo, providing medical care for the civilian population. When Last returned to London and the Royal College of Surgeons, the Professor of Anatomy was Frederic Wood Jones, who had tutored Last in Adelaide, and inspired an enduring interest in comparative anatomy. After some years as anatomy demonstrator and curator, Last was appointed Professor of Applied Anatomy in 1950. His textbook, 'Anatomy Regional and Applied', was first published in 1954 and heralded a new generation of anatomy texts providing a more concise option to 'Gray's Anatomy' or Cunningham's 'Textbook of Anatomy'. It became known for its readability and interest, as it presented medical and surgical anatomy in a practical light, rather than as a colourless academic exercise. The Last's Anatomy (9th Edition) is the recommended text by the Australasian college of Surgeons. https://www.surgeons.org/-/media/Project/RACS/surgeons- org/files/exams/gsse/2019-07-19_lst_complete_reading_list_2020.pdf?rev=a470daa3b8bf438493964f8d0f3a588d&hash;=5CB77FB8A65D19058849C31239392EA1. His own drawings were used as illustrations. Last became first Warden of the Nuffield College of Surgical Sciences, the residence for medical students. On his retiring a common room was named in his honour. From 1970-87 he held the chair of Visiting Professor in the Department of Anatomy at the University of California, Los Angeles. This appointment enabled his spending winter breaks in Adelaide, where he gave lectures and demonstrations in the dissecting room of the Adelaide Medical School, often making use of his superb chalk diagrams. The Lasts chose Malta as a final place of retirement, partly because of its tax laws and partly because of his circle of friends, which included expatriate English people, local Maltese and a sprinkling of surgeons. Failing vision limited his drawing skills; and he suffered from senile gait syndrome, necessitating assistance when standing or walking. Margret died in January 1989, and Last stayed on in Malta. He had two sons, John and Peter, by his first wife, both graduating in medicine from Adelaide University. He had no share in their upbringing.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary- professor-r-j-last-1478497.html References English anatomists English surgeons Australian surgeons 1903 births 1993 deaths 20th-century surgeons ","title":"Raymond Jack Last"},{"id":"48688424","text":"Darchhawna is an Indian writer of Hindi literature and historian from the Northeast Indian state of Mizoram.

Once strict laws have, over time, eased to take into account high rates of teen pregnancy, women who lack the means or will to raise children, and the consequences of illegal abortion. \\"Chapter 3: Offence Of Abortion\\" of the Thai Criminal Code addresses the crime of abortion and levies a penalties of up to three years imprisonment and up to 6,000 baht in fines for a woman found guilty of undergoing an illegal abortion. Exceptions are made in the case of rape or other extenuating circumstances. A court decision in early 2020, however, declared a portion of the abortion statutes unconstitutional and ordered that they be rewritten by 13 February 2021, a move that increased public debate on the topic. Legal status The legal status of abortion in Thailand is governed by the Thai Criminal Code. Abortion is illegal except in certain in circumstances. By the letter, the law allows termination of a pregnancy by physicians only (1) when abortion is necessary due to the health of the pregnant woman, or (2) if the pregnancy was the result of rape. Abortions performed outside of these circumstances are punishable by up to three years in jail (as well as fines) for the woman and up to five years for the performer (up to seven years if it was performed against the will of the woman). In 1989, during the rise of the AIDS epidemic, the Medical Council issued a consultation to the Council of State on whether the law could be interpreted to allow abortion in HIV-positive cases in which the child, if born, could not be expected to enjoy an acceptable quality of life. The Council of State replied that this was impermissible, since the law allowed only consideration for the health of the mother, and not the child. Later, the interpretation of health was debated, and the Medical Council issued a regulation in 2005 in which it explicitly interpreted both physical and mental health as possible factors necessitating abortion. This has been widely interpreted to include women who are emotionally distressed at the prospect of having children they cannot raise. The regulation restricts clinics like those operated by the Planned Parenthood Association of Thailand to provide abortions to women only in their first trimester of pregnancy. Those seeking to end second-trimester pregnancies must do so at a hospital. Abortions are prohibited after 28 weeks. The Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) regulates medical abortions. Termination of a foetus that is fewer than nine weeks from gestation is permitted if some or all of the following criteria are met: (1) medical necessity, (2) legal necessity (e.g., rape), (3) female is under 15 years of age (and unmarried), (4) the foetus is at risk of severe abnormalities or genetic disorders. In December 2014, two drugs that induce miscarriage—Mifepristone and Misoprostol—were approved for ending pregnancies in a hospital setting. The drugs must be prescribed by doctors at approved hospitals or clinics. Women who self-medicate to terminate pregnancies on their own are liable for punishment under the law. In a decision published on 19 February 2020, the Constitutional Court of Thailand ruled that Thailand's current abortion law is unconstitutional. Under Section 301 of the Criminal Code which deals with abortion, women who seek an abortion face up to three years imprisonment and a fine of up to 60,000 baht, or both. The Constitutional Court ruled that Section 301 violates Sections 27 and 28 of the 2017 Constitution of Thailand (also known as the \\"charter\\") which mandates equal rights for men and women, as well as the right and liberty to everyone to his or her life and person. The court ordered that Section 301 be nullified within 360 days of its ruling, i.e., no later than 13 February 2021. Section 305 of the anti-abortion law, allowing for legal abortion when the pregnancy involves rape or endangers a mother's physical health, was judged to be not in violation of the charter. The Constitutional Court ordered the amendment of both Sections 301 and 305 to accord with Thailand's current realities. How the two sections will amended is unclear. By citing sections on equality between men and women, the court's ruling can be interpreted as meaning a man who causes a pregnancy should receive the same punishment the woman seeking to terminate that pregnancy. Abortion statistics Teen pregnancies in Thailand account for as much as 15% of total pregnancies, well above the World Health Organization's 10% median. Data from the Thai Department of Health showed that 72,566 teens aged 10-19 years old gave birth in 2018, or 199 such babies being born per day. Of the total, 9% gave birth to their second child. In the 10–14 age group, 2,385 young girls, down from 2,559 in 2017, gave birth, seven cases a day. According to the Thai National Health Security Office, over 300,000 women have sought medical treatment at state hospitals for incomplete abortions from 2009–2019. Nearly 100,000 of them suffered complications and infections. More than 20 of them died each year. The casualties mount even though safe, WHO-approved abortion pills, legal in more than 60 countries, have been available for over a decade. Teens rarely visit abortion clinics, possibly because parental consent is required, or possibly because they cannot afford the cost, between 4,000–5,000 baht. Clinics, like state hospitals, charge women for abortion services, except for rape victims or economically disadvantaged women. Health department data suggest that most women seek abortions for social and economic reasons. Quantifying the number of abortions performed is difficult as numbers are not made public. A 2012 report published by state hospitals does not differentiate between elective abortion, abortion for health reasons, or miscarriage. \\"...there has never been any official report on the ratio of induced abortions to the number of abortions overall in Thailand,...\\" the paper said. The director of Thailand's Bureau of Reproductive Health notes that there is no centralized database for abortion numbers in Thailand. Private clinics, citing confidentiality, do not provide data to his department. Illegal abortions are impossible to track. \\"No one in this country knows the overall number of abortions,\\" he said. The lack of national data means that his bureau resorts to conducting a yearly survey called the \\"Abortion Surveillance Report\\". It compiles cases of abortion from a number of provinces to gauge the background and motivations of those who seek abortions. Public opinion Acceptance of abortion by the Thai public has lagged behind the gradual easing of abortion laws. Buddhism is the faith of 98% of the Thai populace, and nearly all the exclusively male Buddhist hierarchy view abortion as a transgression that will haunt the \\"sinner\\". In a UNICEF study, those interviewed observe that abortion is not accepted culturally. Although medical abortion is available if specific criteria are met, social taboos stigmatize those seeking an abortion. Adolescents say their family members disapprove of abortion and that public health services staff frequently oppose abortion and denigrate women who inquire about it. Patients under age 18 must have parental approval to access health care services. Adolescents emphasize the barrier that the requirement for parental consent creates. Most teens do not want their parents to know they are using reproductive health services. Parental consent is an obstacle to both general services such as birth control counseling as well as legal abortion services. Some of those interviewed describe a lack of privacy in hospitals as a barrier to accessing services. Youth responses also show that adolescents lack trust in service providers. They fear providers will not keep information confidential and are particularly anxious that providers will share information with family and other community members. This fear is heightened in smaller, close-knit rural communities. Even in cases in which abortion is legal, interviewees reported that a large percentage of physicians are not willing to perform abortions or prescribe medication for medical abortion due to their beliefs or social pressures.

Their actions drew substantial media commentary due to the ongoing media reports of en masse barbarity that the Islamic State forces were engaging in, and raised questions as to why people of European extraction would be drawn to such an entity. Background Selimovic and Kesinovic were born in Austria to Bosniak immigrants who had fled the Bosnian War in the 1990s. Both girls were residents with their families in stable homes in Vienna, and are believed to have become interested in the Islamic State after watching its broadcast propaganda on the Internet, and through their attendance at a mosque in Vienna.'Teenage Austrian poster girl for the Islamic State killed by the group for trying to escape', 'Daily Telegraph', 30 November 2015. Departure to join the Islamic State In April 2014, the pair left their homes in Vienna illicitly, without telling their families of their intentions, leaving a note for their parents stating: \\"Don't look for us. We will serve Allah and we will die for him.\\" They then travelled via Turkey to Syria, entering it through its Northern border, wherein they entered Islamic State controlled territory. The pair later posted photographs from Islamic State territory on social media websites for Jihadist propaganda, wearing burqas and brandishing machine guns. Information obtained by the French news magazine Paris Match shortly afterwards disclosed that the two girls had been married to two Chechen Jihadists, and that they had expressed fears of imprisonment back in Austria for their activities on social media as Islamic State propagandists should they return home. Purported deaths Selimovic and Kesinovic were subsequently reported to be seeking a means of returning to Austria around October 2014, though other media reports stated that Selimovic had been killed around September 2014 at the age of 16 during fighting in Syria. In late 2015, it was reported by the Middle East bureau of The Daily Telegraph newspaper that Kesinovic had been beaten to death with a hammer towards the end of 2014, after being caught by Islamic State forces whilst trying to escape from sex slavery in the city of Raqqa. She was 17 years old. Recent reports from Austrian media, however, state that the girls are still alive and that their return to Austria may result in imprisonment of up to 15 years.

ISIS besieged the airbase for two years, deploying heavy weapons and armored vehicles like suicide tank VBIEDs. ISIS negotiators called up officers on the phone and urged them to surrender and shelled the base with leaflets promising safe passage, but no one defected. Twice ISIS breached the perimeter of the airbase, even reaching as far as the hardened aircraft shelters where the defenders lived, but could not capture it. Colonel Suheil al-Hassan and his Tiger Forces finally broke the siege on November 10, 2015 as part of the Kuweires offensive. Only 300 of 1,100 soldiers survived the siege.

History  The current town hall was built to a design by the French architect Charles Garnier. Garnier, who had left Paris because of Paris Commune (1871), was looking for a land in Bordighera to build his future house. In 1871 he proposed the municipality to buy the land where only school of the city stayed. The offer of 6,000 pounds was very generous, it would have allowed the construction of a new school for which Garnier provided the plans. The project included a classical building that integrates well with the old town of Bordighera that lies behind. The new schools foresaw not only a new section for boys replacing the previous one, but also a girls' section and one for small children. The project is to be considered truly innovative for its time and the municipality accepted the proposal. During the works, which were not followed by Garnier, there were numerous technical problems and delays in deliveries. It was only in 1878 that part of the building was finally terminated. Meanwhile, the population grew and the city decided to build a new school that was opened later in 1886. With the transfer of the school, the municipality decided to use the building as its headquarters. The facade was carved with the coat of arms of the city, a rampant lion that leans against a Pine seafarer. Inside the town hall you can admire numerous paintings from various artists who stayed in Bordighera, including: Pompeo Mariani, Giuseppe Ferdinando Piana, Giuseppe Balbo, Friederich von Kleudgen, etc.  The gardens  The true gardens of the town hall are between the building designed by Charles Garnier and the Cape Esplanade. These gardens, although of small size, can boast two great Ficus macrophylla centenarians and many varieties of exotic plants (agaves, palm trees, cactus, etc.) which can also be seen in many Bordighera gardens. On 17 January 1954, the city placed a bust in honour of Ludwig Winter, its illustrious adopted citizen, as an honour to the man who had done so much to bring prestige to the city and to the Riviera. This is sometimes confusing. Some mistakenly call these gardens also \\"Winter Gardens\\", but the real Winter Gardens are at 6 Ludovico Winter Street in Bordighera. At the foot of the old town hall of Bordighera, there is a large wooden area that is called in various ways: the gardens of the Cape or, more commonly, Cape Pineta. The gardens are vast, and full of very old trees such as pines, olive trees, palm trees and a variety of other species, but very old specimens of Araucaria heterophylla stand out. In the pine forest there is also a bust in honour of the painter Mosè Bianchi, who often came to Bordighera to spend time with his grandson Pompeo Mariani. Also in the Cape Pineta, but a bit lower, there is a monument in honour of Charles Garnier. On May 15, 2015 the renovation of the Marabutto was terminated. It is an ancient powder keg that is currently in the Cape Pineta. The name is due to the shape of the small building that recalls the graves of Muslim holy men (a cube topped by a dome), whose name is precisely marabutto. Near the Marabutto, you can see three old cannons so much loved by the locals that they were given names: Butafoegu, Tiralogni et Cacastrasse.  Trivia  When the city had to choose its coat of arms, a dispute broke out with the neighbouring city of Sanremo. Bordighera, which was nicknamed \\"Queen of the Palms\\", wanted to see represented the palm on his coat of arms, but the bigger rival city had already a similar one, so Bordighera had to settle for a pine. Behind the municipal building is one of four Ficus Magnolioides recognised by the State Forestry. The monumental tree has an estimated age of 100 years, with a height of 18 meters and a diameter of the stem of 1040 cm.

D'Auri was born in Rome. He moved to Los Angeles in 1967, where he began playing in flamenco clubs. In 1976, he recorded with fusion group Caldera, releasing an album of the same name. In 1980, he met Stephen Hill, who produced his first album Nuevos Caminos, re- released in 1984 as Passion Play. He collaborated with Japanese fusion artist Keiko Matsui in the late 1980s, and features on two of her albums. Later album releases include Flamenco Mystico (1992) and Flamenco: Passion & Soul (1997). He gained a reputation performing in restaurants and clubs in Los Angeles. He died from cancer at the age of 70.  Biography  Gino D'Auri was born in Rome in 1937, with a Gypsy heritage. As a teenager he showed promise as a classical guitarist and began performing in recitals around Italy and won some local guitar competitions. He had a change of musical direction however when he saw the movie Sombrero which featured the famous flamenco dancer José Greco. D'Auri reported to have been \\"traumatized by his dancing and the music of flamenco guitarist Gerónimo Villarino\\". He saw the movie several times in order to absorb the music and replicate what he had heard. In the following years he began studying flamenco music in Italy and Spain and began touring with several dance companies. In 1967, at the age of 30, he moved to Los Angeles and began playing regularly in Los Angeles and Santa Monica flamenco clubs like the Matador. In the late 1960s his idol, Greco, approached him after a performance and asked him to join the José Greco Dance company. They performed together during the early 1970s and Greco became a mentor to D'Auri. During the late 1970s D'Auri was performing at the Lares and El Cid and was said to be on stage nearly every night of the week. In 1976, he recorded with Caldera, a Latin band that combined jazz, funk, rock and Latin music on their self-titled debut album. In 1980 Stephen Hill, presenter for the radio show Hearts of Space, met D'Auri and was asked to produce D'Auri's first album Nuevos Caminos (translated as New Paths) on harpist Georgia Kelly's label Heru Records. In 1984, the album was remastered and re-released as Passion Play under the record label Sonic Atmosphere. In the late 1980s, D'Auri also played guitar on two albums by Japanese new age world fusion artist Keiko Matsui. In the 1990s D'Auri recorded two further solo albums Flamenco Mystico and Flamenco: Passion & Soul with some tracks accompanied by cello and percussion. His last recorded solo album was Flamenco Passion in 2003. D'Auri died of cancer at the age of 70 at his Los Angeles home on 26 January 2007. D'Auri, who was married twice, is survived by wife Dahad of 30 years. He has been reported playing music on the stage of El Cid in Southern California even after his death.  Musical Influences & Style  While D'Auri was primarily a flamenco guitarist he was also influenced by other styles such as classical, Latin and various world music. Some of his songs contain middle eastern and Indian musical textures with dark droning bass overtones and hypnotic percussion. His albums were released under record labels usually associated with new age and ambient music. On his first album Passion Play, D'Auri created a unique sound by amplifying a Japanese Takamine guitar with a built in pick up and shaping the sound through a digital reverb unit. D'Auri also utilized improvisation in his playing and valued emotional expression over the striving for perfection. \\"Striving for perfection gets in the way of the feeling,\\" he says. \\"When you improvise you can't allow yourself to think about anything but the feeling of the moment.

He has produced and localized a number of iconic video games such as Spelunker, Lode Runner, Moon Patrol, Kung-Fu Master and R-Type Dimensions. He is the co-founder and executive producer at Tozai, inc, based in Bellevue, Washington. Although Tsumura's Japanese given name is Kenji, he adopted the nickname Scott shortly before moving to America at the suggestion of a friend. The name resonated with Tsumura due to his deep admiration for Scottish historical novelist, playwright and poet, Walter Scott. He became a US citizen in 2005.  Career   Early career  After graduating from college, Tsumura started working as a bartender at Kobe Club. Since then, he's had seventeen or eighteen career changes, working in sales, plumbing, civil engineering, apparel, architecture, wholesale, trading, driving and painting. Tsumura moved twelve times and lived in various places all around Japan, including Kobe, Osaka, Nagoya and Tokyo.ファミコンゲーム『スペランカー』の生みの親・スコット津村氏講演会参加レポート (ツカウエイゴ), 2014年4月20日  Irem  Ten years after graduation, Tsumura got a job in the slot machine industry. At the time, a German slot machine called 'Rotamint' was very popular. It had been converted to work with Japanese 100-yen coins and was said to be bringing in more than 1.5 million yen a month.スコット津村氏による「型破りExecutive Producerによるゲームプロデュース裏話」講演会＆交流会開催！会場は大爆笑の渦！ (Seattle IT Japanese Professionals), 2014年4月29日 A year later, the Businesses Affecting Public Morals Regulation Law was revised and it became illegal to use real money with slot machines, and the use of tokens was enforced. Rotamint machines were soon replaced by video games. Tsumura's acquaintance, Kenzo Tsujimoto, realized that this development might be a potential boon for the video game industry and founded a game company called IPM (which later became Irem, before splitting into Apies and Irem Software Engineering). Tsumura joined IPM and oversaw the distribution of video game cabinets before he launched a global sales department. Tsumura remained at Irem when NANAO (Now EIZO) acquired Irem in 1980 as well as when Tsujimoto left the company to found Capcom in 1983. As the head of arcade game development, Tsumura produced a number of games, such as Moon Patrol, 10-Yard Fight, MotoRace USA and Kung- Fu Master. When the Family Computer (NES) was introduced, Tsumura started developing game software for the home console market. In 1984, Tsumura obtained the rights from Brøderbund for Lode Runner, which was released for arcade systems that July. Tsumura licensed Spelunker in June 1985 and released the Nintendo Entertainment System port six months later. He also helped produce the TurboGrafx-16 version of R-Type, which was their first port of an arcade game which requires advanced graphic quality and speed of data processing to video game consoles. The NES was released on October 18, 1985 with 17 launch titles including Kung-Fu Master and 10-Yard Fight, which Nintendo licensed from IREM.  U.S.  In May 1988, based on an idea by Doug Carlston, the CEO of Broderbund, Tsumura moved to the U.S. to establish a joint venture located in San Francisco called, Kyodai Software Marketing, with 13 Japanese PC game companies. Tsumura only planned on staying in the US for about a year to get Kyodai Software Marketing up and running. However, by 1989, Nintendo and Sega home consoles were soaring, and so, in order to capitalize on this trend, Tsumura and Henk Rogers, CEO of the Japanese video game studio BPS, decided to found its Seattle branch. It was Bullet-Proof Software that licensed Tetris, which Alexey Pajitnov had developed in the Soviet Union, releasing a Game Boy version. Later, Tsumura and Sheila Boughten, then Bullet-Proof Software's Vice President of marketing (now President of Tozai, Inc.) helped Pajitnov and his family immigrate to the U.S., offering him a development position at Bullet-Proof Software US. When Tsumura visited Pajitnov in Russia after the Soviet Union collapsed, the economy was so turbulent and Tsumura endured a few dangerous situations, including a near-mugging. In 1993, Bullet-Proof Software was acquired by Spectrum HoloByte (later MicroProse), based in San Francisco. After spending two years traveling between San Francisco and Seattle, Tsumura finally left Spectrum HoloByte. He co-founded a consulting firm Tozai, Inc. together with Sheila Boughten and a development studio, Big Bang Software, in Seattle in 1996. The former became Tozai, Inc. / Tozai Games (a Game publisher) and the latter was merged into Nintendo.ファミコン版「スペランカー」制作者による裏話がここに。 Minoru Arakawa, the first CEO of Nintendo of America, asked Tsumura to help him found an internal American development studio. The result was Nintendo Software Technology. For 4 years Tsumura ran NST as COO/President. He then left NST and founded and/or managed a few of other companies and studios, such as Amaze Entertainment (Black Ship Studio), Kemco US and MTO US, before returning to Tozai Inc. Tozai Inc. (Tozai Games), a consulting firm from 1996 to 2007, consulted to many companies, such as Mitsui & Co., NEC Interchannel, Bandai, Eidos, MicroProse and Hasbro, were now developing their own games. Tsumura and Boughten oversaw Tozai Games' acquisition of the intellectual property rights to Lode Runner and Spelunker, and co-founded Tozai Games with Takuya Banno. Tsumura then produced titles such as the Xbox Live Arcade version/Xbox One of Lode Runner, Lode Runner X/Lode Runner Classic for smartphones and Spelunker HD (PlayStation 3), Spelunker Collection (PlayStation 3) and Spelunker World (PlayStation 4).

He believes that Lode Runner originated the idea of a built-in level editor. Tsumura was especially attracted to the unique underground adventure theme of Spelunker. He made the Family Computer Disk System version extremely challenging so that players could learn to strategize and feel a sense of accomplishment as they play. As he puts it, \\"Home video games at that time didn't have much incentive to compel players to try again, whereas arcade games had to make players feel incentivized to rise to the challenge within the first few minutes.\\" Tsumura responds to Tetris because he feels it is a profound game, yet so simple that anyone can play. What's more, he thinks there can't be an in-depth conversation about the history of video games without mentioning Tetris. Releasing games is like selling fun for Tsumura. Even after changing careers so many times in his young adulthood, he ended up spending almost 40 years in the video game industry. He believes that Spelunker, Lode Runner and Tetris changed his life forever.  Related people  * Kenzo Tsujimoto (Founder of Irem and Capcom) gave Tsumura his first opportunity to get involved in the video game industry and showed him everything about the business. Tsujimoto was CEO of IPM, which later became known as Irem. Irem was acquired by NANAO (Now EIZO) in 1980. Tsujimoto had founded I.R.M in 1979 but stayed at Irem and created an arcade development studio before he left the company and founded Capcom in 1983. * Shigeru Saito (Founder of Tose) was part of the development team of the NES version of Spelunker and has continued to work with Tsumura in game development since then. Because of their good relationship, Tsumura would sometimes allow Irem developers to assist with projects at Tose. * Doug Carlston (Lawyer and Founder of Brøderbund) helped Tsumura immigrate to the U.S. Brøderbund is known for the video game titles Lode Runner, Spelunker, Myst, Prince of Persia, Where in Time Is Carmen Sandiego? and The Print Shop. * Henk Rogers (Founder of BPS Japan) gave Tsumura not only the opportunity to live in the U.S. permanently but also to get involved with the world-famous game, Tetris. * Alexey Pajitnov (Developer of Tetris) – Tsumura established the US office of Bullet-Proof Software, the licensee of Tetris for Game Boy, and then helped Pajitnov move to the U.S., offering him a position at Bullet- Proof Software US. * Minoru Arakawa (Founder of Nintendo of America) asked Tsumura to establish Nintendo of America's own in-house game development studio, Nintendo Software Technology. Arakawa's efforts not only made the Nintendo brand more widely known in the world but also contributed to the rise of the video game industry.  Photography  Tsumura's hobby is taking snapshots of people, catching them in unguarded moments. He also enjoys landscape photography. He loves rangefinder cameras, especially Leica, frequently posting his latest photos and essays from 2011 to 2016 on his blog, The Wind from Seattle, which is sponsored by Yodobashi Camera. In April 2013, Tsumura held his first solo photography exhibition, \\"With the Wind – Scott Tsumura Photo Exhibit\\" at Yodobashi Camera's Gallery Instance in Tokyo. His first book, With the Wind, which was based on his blog, The Wind from Seattle, was published on November 20th, 2017. The hard copies were quickly sold out. His personal photo blog, shot & shot is updated frequently. The blog's title was inspired by his rifle shooting experience; according to Tsumura both marksmanship and photography have targets that require a similar degree of precision. Tsumura ranked second in Osaka in rifle marksmanship and thirteenth overall in Japan. Tsumura also loves jazz and classical music, especially romantic music from the 19th century to early 20th century. His photography takes inspiration from the evocative emotional range present in great classical music. His favorite scores are Symphony No. 3 (Saint-Saëns), Symphony No. 8 (Dvořák) and Symphony No. 2 (Brahms).  Notes  In 2002, he was awarded an honorary Bachelor of Science from DigiPen Institute of Technology for the guidance he offered to students. Tsumura married his college sweetheart in 1966 and has a son and two daughters, as well as a grandson and two granddaughters.  References   External links  * Tozai, Inc.

The descendants of those who made aliyah in 1930s, the wave of emigrants after World War II or after the fall of communism, with their children and grandchildren born in Israel, represent about 10% of the population. According to the Association of Romanian Journalists Abroad, about 400,000 Romanian Jews live in Israel. Most of them have higher education, occupying important positions in various sectors and making a great contribution to the economic, social and cultural development of Israel. They have established several kibbutzim, moshavim and towns (Kiryat Bialik, Kiryat Tiv'on, Rosh Pinna, Zikhron Ya'akov). Between 1882 and 1884, Romanian Jews in Israel already established nine localities.  History  Mass emigration to Israel ensued (see Bricha and Aliyah). According to Sachar, for the first two post-war years, tens of thousands of Romanian Jews left for Israel; the Romanian government did not try to stop them, especially due to its desire to reduce its historically suspect and now impoverished Jewish minority. Afterwards, Jewish emigration began to encounter obstacles. In 1948, the year of Israeli independence, Zionism came under renewed suspicion, and the government began a campaign of liquidation against Zionist funds and training farms. However, emigration was not completely banned; Romanian Foreign Minister Ana Pauker, herself a Jew with a father and brother in Israel, negotiated an agreement with Israeli ambassador Reuven Rubin, a Romanian immigrant to Israel, under which the Romanian government would allow 4,000 Jews a month to emigrate to Israel; this decision was at least partially influenced by a large Jewish Agency bribe to the Romanian government. This agreement applied mainly to ruined businessmen and other economically \\"redundant\\" Jews. Around this time, Israel also secured another agreement with the Romanian government, under which Romania issued 100,000 exit visas for Jews and Israel supplied Romania with oil drills and pipes to aid the struggling Romanian oil industry. By December 1951, about 115,000 Romanian Jews had emigrated to Israel.Sachar, Howard M.:Israel and Europe: An Appraisal in History Throughout the period of Communist rule, Romania allowed limited numbers of Jews to emigrate to Israel, in exchange for much-needed Israeli economic aid. By 1965, Israel was funding agricultural and industrial projects throughout Romania, and in exchange, Romania allowed limited numbers of Jews to emigrate to Israel. When Nicolae Ceaușescu came to power in 1965, he initially ended the trade in deference to the Eastern bloc's Arab allies. However, by 1969, he decided to exchange Jews for cash from Israel. Ceaușescu wanted economic independence from the Soviet Union, which was content to keep Romania a backwater and as nothing more than a supplier of raw materials, but to fund economic projects, he needed hard cash. As a result, from then until the Ceaușescu regime fell in 1989, about 1,500 Jews a year were granted exit visas to Israel in exchange for a payment of cash for every Jew allowed to leave, in addition to other Israeli aid. The exact payments were determined by the age, education, profession, employment, and family status of the emigrant. Israel paid a minimum of $2,000 per head for every emigrant, and paid prices in the range of $25,000 for doctors or scientists. In addition to these payments, Israel also secured loans for Romania and paid off the interest itself, and supplied the Romanian Army with military equipment. As a result of aliyah, the Romanian-Jewish community was gradually depleted. By 1987, just 23,000 Jews were left in Romania, half of whom were over 65 years old. Relations with Romanian culture Romanian Jews in Israel have strong relations with Romanian culture. Moreover, there is an intense activity among writers of Romanian language. In Israel exist 11 associations of writers in foreign languages, including the Association of Israeli Writers of Romanian Language ().

Ukraine cabinet The main priority of the Ministry of Regional Development, Construction and Housing is the conduction of reforms on decentralization and energy efficiency. During the year of implementing these reforms, a significant breakthrough was made, including the adopting of a number of legislative acts, introduction of new programs and their funding. Also, the Ministry is responsible for the construction reform and introduction of market relations in the housing sector to provide consumers with quality services. Hennadiy Zubko headed the government commission on investigating the MH17 catastrophe and the special commission on investigating causes of the crash of the ship \\"Ivolha\\". He also took care of issues of infrastructure restoration in Svatove affected by fires at the rocket and artillery weapon warehouses. In addition, he created an expert group to assess the damage caused by an emergency situation. Decentralization Decentralization reform implemented under the leadership of Hennadiy Zubko involves changes in education, health, social policy, public administration, local authorities, development of urban infrastructure, as well as energy efficiency measures. In December 2014, the Budget and Tax Codes were amended, and fiscal decentralization took place in Ukraine. Thanks to these changes, local budgets in 2015 became surplus. Fiscal decentralization has allowed for the provision of more than USD 24 billion to local budgets. Using the State Regional Development Fund, the government financed 784 projects of infrastructure and provided them with USD 2.7 billion. On 1 September 2015 the Law of Ukraine No.320-VIII \\"On Amendments to Certain Legislative Acts of Ukraine on Decentralization of Powers in the field of Architectural Control and Improvement of Town Planning Legislation\\" came into force. It reforms the system of state architectural control and transmits the respective functions and powers from the national to the local level. After adopting on 2 February 2015 the Law of Ukraine \\"On voluntary association of local communities\\", 6,300 territorial communities initiated their association. 159 associated communities took part in local elections on 25 October 2015. They elected their heads and local authorities. Since 2016, they should receive direct budgetary relations with the central budget. In 2016, it is planned to give UAH 1.4 billion from the State Budget for subsidies to support joint local communities, meeting the long-term plans. The Ministry of Regional Development has developed criteria for assessing implementation of the state policy of regional state administrations: 27 indicators at 6 directions on a quarterly basis and 64 indicators at 12 directions each year. The Ministry has also developed an Action Plan on implementing during 2015-2017 the National Strategy of Regional Development for the period until 2020, which was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers. The document should resolve such problems as the uniformity of territorial development, eliminate inter-regional socio-economic disparities, and stimulate economic activity and employment of residents of territorial communities. The government has provided contributions to the State Fund for Regional Development in the amount of UAH 2.9 billion for the support of 844 development area investment projects. The international community assists the Regional Development Ministry in conducting decentralization. In particular, the EU planned to allocate EUR 90 million for implementing the decentralization reform. 78% of the necessary laws for decentralization have already been adopted, and the other 22% are awaiting amendments to the Constitution. The future of the reform depends on approval of these amendments by the Ukrainian MPs. Energy Efficiency On 3 September 2014, the Cabinet of Ministers approved the Action Plan for the implementation of the European Parliament and the Council of the EU Directive 2009/28/EU \\"On promoting the use of energy produced from the renewable energy sources\\". On 1 October 2014, the Cabinet of Ministers also approved the National Action Plan on Renewable Energy for the period until 2020 and Action Plan for its implementation. Implementing the plan will increase the share of energy produced from alternative fuel from 4.5% in 2013 to 11% in 2020. On 28 September 2015, the Governmental Committee approved the draft Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine \\"On National Action Plan on energy efficiency for the period until 2020\\". The Law of Ukraine \\"On energy efficiency of buildings\\", which provides energy efficiency of buildings in accordance with the EU requirements, was drafted as well. \\"Urban Infrastructure\\" project was launched for the allocation of $140 million. The project was aimed at implementing measures to improve energy efficiency, reduce water losses and settle the day-night water supply in several cities. Under the initiative of the Regional Development Ministry, the state now compensates for part of the energy efficiency loans and continued to do this in 2016. 48 programs were adopted, providing for the compensation of loan interests under the energy efficiency measures. 13 programs are of regional character, 16 are for districts and 19 are for cities. As of 9 November 2015, since the start of the State Program on Energy Efficiency for the reimbursement of \\"warm\\" loans, UAH 111.7 million was transferred from the state budget. About 60,000 families participated in the program. Banks issued energy-efficient loans worth UAH 950.9 million. The concept of the Energy Efficiency Fund - S2I was drafted to be launched in 2016. Today the share of renewable sources in the total energy balance of Ukraine is 3.45%. The reform program envisaged by the government will increase it to 30% by 2030. Construction Reform The Ministry of Regional Development, led by Hennadiy Zubko, drafted a Decree \\"On the reallocation of governmental expenditures for the Ministry of Regional Development, Construction and Housing in 2015\\". It provided for the allocation of UAH 10.6 million to the budget for affordable housing.

(2015) It allows for the noninvasive examination of the brain's cellular and molecular structure. It can also be applied as a means to diagnose and monitor intracranial pressure, for example as incorporated into continuous brain monitoring devices. ACG uses molecular acoustics,Molekularakustik - Eine Einführung in die Zusammenhänge zwischen Ultraschall und Molekülstruktur in Flüssigkeiten und Gasen, Werner Schaaffs (1963) in audible and ultrasound frequency ranges, to monitor changes. It may use microphones, accelerometers, and multifrequency ultrasonic transducers. It does not use any radiation and is completely free of any side effects. ACG also facilitates blood flow analysis as well as the detection of obstructions in cerebral blood flow (from cerebral embolism) or bleeding (from cerebral hemorrhage). Passive and active acoustocerebrography Passive acoustocerebrography All brain tissue is influenced by blood circulating in the brain's vascular system. With each heartbeat, blood circulates in the skull, following a recurring pattern according to the oscillation produced. This oscillation's effect, in turn, depends on the brain's size, form, structure and its vascular system. Thus, every heartbeat stimulates minuscule motion in the brain tissue as well as cerebrospinal fluid and therefore produces minimal changes in intracranial pressure. These changes can be monitored and measured in the skull. Today, mostly passive sensors like accelerometers are used to identify these signals correctly.Cranial Accelerometry Can Detect Cerebral Vasospasm Caused by Subarachnoid Hemorrhage, Smith et al. (2015) Sometimes highly sensitive microphones are utilized. Acoustic recordings from experimental saccular aneurysms in dogs, Sekhar et al. (1990) Detection and Analysis of Cranial Bruit, Kosugi et al. (1987) With a digital signal, it becomes possible to study the patterns of the blood flow moving inside the skull. These patterns form unique signatures that can be analyzed with specially designed algorithms, identifying them either as an inconspicuous, “normal” pattern or as a pattern showing an “abnormal” behavior. Active acoustocerebrography In active ACG applications, a multi-frequency ultrasonic signal is used to detect and classify adverse changes at the cellular or molecular level.On ultrasound classification of stroke risk factors from randomly chosen respondents using non-invasive multispectral ultrasonic brain measurements and adaptive profiles, Wrobel et al. (2015) In addition to all of the advantages that passive ACG provides, with active ACG it is possible to conduct a spectral analysis of the acoustic signals received. These spectrum analyses not only display changes in the brain's vascular system, but also those in its cellular and molecular structures. One common application of active ACG is the Transcranial Doppler test. More recently, its color version (TCCD) has been deployed. These ultrasonic procedures measure blood flow velocity within the brain's blood vessels. They are used to diagnose embolisms, stenoses and vascular constrictions, for example, in the aftermath of a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Fields of application In contrast with applications that provide only momentary images, such as MRI and CT, the results of ACG procedures can be obtained continuously, thus facilitating effortless and non-invasive real-time monitoring. This can be especially helpful during the acute phase directly after a stroke or a traumatic brain injury. The measured data is mathematically processed continuously and displayed on a monitoring device. The computer-aided analysis of the signals enables the physician/nursing staff to precisely interpret the results immediately after device setup. Furthermore, ACG allows for preventive detection of pathological changes in brain tissue.

The hall was in the premises of Thurston & Co. Ltd which relocated to Leicester Square in 1901. The building was bombed in 1940 and reopened under a new name, Leicester Square Hall, and new management in 1947. The venue closed in 1955 and the building was demolished to make way for an extension to Fanum House. The Hall was used for many important billiards and snooker matches, including 12 World Snooker Championship finals between 1930 and 1953. It was also the venue of the first World Snooker Championship match in November 1926. The hall was sometimes referred to as \\"Thurston's Grand Hall\\". There was also a \\"Minor Hall\\" in the same building. Opening Billiards - Walter Lindrum v Tom Newman In 1900 Thurston & Co. Ltd. were forced to relocate from their premises at 16 Catherine Street because it was in the way of a new street from Holborn to the Strand. They moved to 45-46 Leicester Square and built new premises there, including a \\"match room\\" which became known as \\"Thurston's Hall\\".http://www.snookerheritage.co.uk/company-histories/thurston-co/ The first important event hosted at the new venue was the Billiards Association American tournament. This was a round-robin handicap event featuring 8 professionals and ran from 7 to 12 October 1901. The event resulted in a tie between William Peall and Harry Stevenson, with 6 wins out of 7. There was a play-off on the Monday. Peall received 100 start but Stevenson won 500–395. Bombing On 16 October 1940, during The Blitz, the Leicester Square premises were destroyed by a parachute mine which demolished the south-western corner of the square. Only two minor injuries were reported. The building was housing an \\"exhibition of billiards antiquities\\" at the time and many of the items were destroyed. The last major event at the hall was the English Amateur Billiards Championship which was won, on 5 April, by Kingsley Kennerley for the fourth successive time. A \\"summer\\" professional snooker tournament was started on 15 April but was abandoned in May. Reopening The hall reopened under new management as the Leicester Square Hall in October 1947. Joe Davis and Sidney Smith played an exhibition match from 6 to 11 October. Davis, conceding 10 points per frame, won 38–33. This was followed by the final of the 1947 World Snooker Championship between Walter Donaldson and Fred Davis. The match was over 145 frames and was played from 13 to 25 October. Donaldson won the match 82–63, having taken a winning lead of 73–49 on the previous afternoon. Fred Davis made a 135 clearance in frame 86, just one short of the championship record. Closure The last competitive match at the hall was played from 13 to 15 January 1955 between Joe Davis and his brother, Fred. This was the final match of the 1954/55 News of the World Tournament. Joe won the match 19–18 but the tournament was won by Jackie Rea, Joe finishing in second place. Joe made a 137 clearance on the final day. Joe Davis compiled the first officially recognised maximum break at Leicester Square Hall on Saturday 22 January 1955 in a match against 68-year-old fellow Englishman Willie Smith. The match between Davis and Smith was played as part of a series of events marking the closure of Leicester Square Hall. The Billiards Association and Control Council initially refused to accept the break since the match was not played under their rules. At the time the professionals played using a rule (now standard) whereby after a foul a player could compel the offender to play the next stroke. It was only at a meeting on 20 March 1957 that they recognised the break. Davis was presented with a certificate to commemorate the event. From 17 to 22 January Joe Davis played Willie Smith at both billiards and snooker. In the snooker match Smith received 28 points in each frame but, despite this handicap, Davis won the match by 23 frames to 13. The final match was a snooker contest, played on level terms, between Joe and Fred Davis from 24 to 29 January. The contents were auctioned off on 2 February with the match table on which Davis had made his maximum break being sold for 270 guineas.

His father died in 1854, appointing his mother and his uncle General Charles Ash Windham as his guardians, but his uncle was often away on duty and his mother remarried to a much younger man and abandoned Felbrigg to live with him. Windham was educated at private schools from the age of eight, from one of which he was ejected for foul language, before entering Eton College in 1853.

This income would have increased in 1869 when he would have become entitled to the rents from the Hanworth estates.

It is the second part of a three-episode story arc which began with the previous episode \\"Sponsored Content\\" and concludes with the following episode \\"PC Principal Final Justice\\" that together serve as the season finale. It premiered on Comedy Central on December 2, 2015. Like the previous episode, this episode continues to parody the abundance of online advertising while continuing its season-long lampoon of political correctness. Plot After Kyle is called to the principal's office, he finds Mr. Mackey there instead who tells him that PC Principal has lost his mind, with him and his fellow fraternity members going on a hunger strike and that Jimmy and Leslie have both gone missing. Meanwhile, Jimmy explains about how ads have evolved over time, becoming smarter and taking human form, in which Leslie is one of them. Randy and his family are eating dinner when Randy proposes that the family move out of South Park because it \\"sucks\\" now without elaborating. After dinner, Randy explains to Sharon that ever since South Park's revitalization, it has become too expensive to live in and he has taken out a second mortgage on the house to help pay for the expenses. Back at the news base, Jimmy is talking to the newsmen about how he has become attracted to Leslie, despite her being an ad. The newsmen tell him that an ad's purpose is to entice and manipulate people. Jimmy suggests posting the story to the school's newspaper, but is rebuffed as the newsmen tell him to just figure out what the ads are planning. At South Park Elementary, Stan runs up to Kyle with a school newspaper clipping stating that Principal has sent Jimmy and Leslie on a Disney Cruise for good behavior, but the boys know better as Jimmy was in charge of the school newspaper before being replaced by Nathan. They go to the school newsroom to get answers but are left with nothing after Nathan starts acting stupid to throw them off- course as he directly communicates with the ads on his computer. Mr. Garrison, Caitlyn Jenner and Principal Victoria arrive at the Whole Foods Market with disguises on and Mr. Garrison is shocked about the state of his town. Back at the news base, Jimmy's attempts to interrogate Leslie fail, leaving him to start accepting her, with the head newsman convinced that he is now \\"thinking with his dick\\". At Cartman's house, Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Kenny and Butters search through news articles trying to solve the case, but end up at various stores after getting distracted by ads. This leads to some tension between Kyle and Stan who strongly believe the other is causing the distraction on purpose to avoid finding out the truth. Randy is ambushed by Garrison, Jenner and Victoria, who then knock him out after they discover a 'PC' tattoo on his rump. Back at the base, Leslie tells Jimmy that Principal is the enemy and then places an ad on the newsmen's monitor so they can not see them. While isolated from the newsmen, Leslie asks Jimmy to help her escape. At a motel, Randy wakes up tied to a chair being interrogated by the trio, who explain that the political correctness movement is not only happening in the United States, but internationally as well with PC Principal being the cause of it all, and Randy vows to kill him if this is true. Jimmy and Leslie attempt to escape, but are caught by the newsmen with the leader asking Officer Barbrady to kill them both, but Barbrady, not wanting to kill or injure anyone else, aids Jimmy and Leslie in their escape despite accidentally shooting a newsman in the shoulder. At the school, mutual suspicion between Kyle and Stan leads to the two to start arguing and then turning into a physical confrontation. At the school newsroom, Jimmy and Leslie confront Nathan about his lies, but Leslie betrays Jimmy and brutally assaults him, revealing the fact that Nathan is one of the agents of Leslie and the other ads and proving the newsmen were correct in their warnings to Jimmy not to trust Leslie. At the fraternity house, Randy, Garrison, Jenner and Victoria discover the place abandoned before discovering a computer that Principal used to see the ad featuring him and Leslie. They come to the conclusion that Principal may be trying to help, but they get distracted after looking through the computer and end up at a store just as the boys did earlier. Leslie goes to Kyle's house to ask for his help and last four digits of his Social Security number, and they leave together. Critical reception IGN's Max Nicholson gave the episode a 7.2 out of 10 and stated that the episode \\"was a little sluggish, especially in terms of the main plot. While Jimmy and Leslie's storyline made some headway on that front, the boys came up empty-handed in their investigation – although their sudden transitions to consumerist hotspots were really funny.\\" Writing for The A.V. Club, Dan Caffrey rated the episode a B and stated in his review: \\"it's a chapter of the increasingly epic season 19 that relies almost entirely on cryptic intentions, shifting allegiances, and general confusion among the characters as they try to unravel who’s really behind the recent madness around town\\".

Work on the tunnel did not commence until 1969. With the opening of the tunnel in 1978, the Paeroa - Katikati section of the East Coast Main Trunk was closed. The line to Paeroa was then part of the Thames Branch, which closed north of Waitoa in 1991.

He conducted research in areas of personality, race, social issues, and consumer psychology.  Early life and education  James Arthur Bayton was born on April 5, 1912 in Whitestone, Virginia to George and Helen Bayton.Hicks, L., & Roberts, A. (1991). In Memoriam: James A. Bayton (1912-1990). Journal of Black Psychology, 17(2), 51-51. His father, a physician, had graduated from the medical school at Howard University.Guthrie, R. (1998). Even the Rat was White: A historical view of psychology (2nd ed.). Boston: Allyn and Bacon. Bayton graduated from Temple University's high school in 1931 and subsequently matriculated at Howard University as a Chemistry major. Bayton began his undergraduate career planning to go into medicine, however, taking psychology courses taught by Francis Sumner, Max Meenes, and Frederick Watts sparked Bayton's interest in the behavioral sciences. During his undergraduate career, Bayton was a member of the Omega Psi Phi fraternity. Bayton graduated from Howard in 1935 with a B.A in psychology and began his M.S. studies at Howard. After graduating from the M.S. program, Bayton began further graduate study at Columbia University, where he was taught by R. S. Woodworth and A. T. Poffenberger. When Bayton's father died, Bayton moved back to Philadelphia in order to be closer to his family. He transferred to the University of Pennsylvania and continued his graduate studies under psychologists such as L. Witmer, S. W. Fernberger, M. G. Preston, and M. Viteles. While conducting his doctorate studies, Bayton was offered a teaching position at Virginia State College. Partly due to the financial devastation of the Great Depression, Bayton delayed his graduate studies and became an associate professor of psychology from 1939 to 1943. During this time he published several papers, and was finally awarded his Ph.D. in psychology in 1943.  Career  From 1943-1945, during World War II, Bayton worked as a social service analyst for the U.S Department of Agriculture. Afterward, he became a professor of psychology at Southern University in Louisiana. He taught at Morgan State College in Maryland in 1946 and returned to Howard University as a professor in 1947, where he worked for the remainder of his life. He was the head of the Psychology Department from 1966–1970, as well as a graduate research professor from 1982-1988.Ross, S., & Hicks, L. (1991). James A. Bayton (1912-1990): Obituary. American Psychologist, 46(12), 1345-1345. From 1948-1953, Bayton also worked part-time in the U.S Department of Agriculture conducting research on consumer behavior. While working at the USDA, Bayton headed a psychological research program focused on policy development and program evaluation, as well as survey programs. While working as a professor at Howard, Bayton also served as the vice president of National Analysts, Inc. from 1953–1962 and 1966–1967, the vice president of Universal Marketing Research, Inc. from 1962–1966, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution from 1967–1968, and a staff psychologist at Chilton Research Services from 1968-1976. Working in these positions, he contributed to over 70 corporate sponsored projects. He conducted survey and marking research and focused his work on consumer psychology. He conducted research for Dupont, IMB, Armstrong Cork, Chrysler, Eli Lilly, Curtis Publishing, Johnson and Johnson, Schick, Pet Milk, American Dairy Association, Federal Reserve Board, Smith Kline, Rench, Procter & Gamble, and the Office of Navel Research. He also was a member of the Research Advisory Committee, Social Security Administration, the United States Department of Health Education and Welfare, and the Advisory Committee on Agricultural Science in theDepartment of Agriculture. He was also the chairman of a committee designed to evaluate equal employment opportunity policies in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Bayton was an expert witness for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in several cases of school desegregation and job discrimination. He also served as an expert witness for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. He played an important role in cases of the desegregation of Arlington and Roanoke schools after the \\"massive resistance\\" to desegregation headed by U.S Senator Harry F. Byrd, Sr. He also led desegregation sessions for government agriculture extension systems. Continuing in this line of work, Bayton assessed urban police complaint boards, summer youth programs, community relations, and civil rights commissions in relational to desegregation policies. Throughout his career, Bayton directed over 50 government-sponsored projects. Bayton was a fellow of the American Psychological Association, the American Marketing Association, and the National Academy of Public Administration.

Generally, the upper-class was characterized as \\"intelligent, ambitious, industrious, neat, and progressive\\", while the lower-class was considered to be \\"ignorant, lazy, loud, and physically dirty.\\" The only race difference noted was that White subjects characterized Blacks as musical and ostentatious regardless of class. Overall, the assignment of stereotypes varied more due to class than race. In other words, there were more differences between upper-class and lower class stereotypes than stereotypes between different races of the same class. Bayton suggested race differences in stereotyping tasks were partially the product of assumed class differences.Bayton, J., Mcalister, L., & Hamer, J. (1956). Race- Class Stereotypes. The Journal of Negro Education, 25(1), 75-78 In another study conducted by Bayton regarding race and class, 80 Black and 74 White college students were asked to assign traits (chosen from a list of 80 adjectives) to describe the Black lower class, the Black middle class, the White lower class, and the White middle class. The students were asked to choose five or fewer traits for each group and rate the traits on a scale from -5 to +5. Both Whites and Blacks assigned more advantageous traits to the middle as opposed to the lower class (though the effect was larger for White subjects).Bayton, J., & Smedley, J. (1978). Evaluative Race-Class Stereotypes by Race and Perceived Class of Subjects. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 36(5), 530-535. In his study, \\"Negro perception of Negro and white personality traits,\\" Bayton had the Guilford-Zimmermann Temperament Survey administered to 240 Black students at Howard University. The subjects were prompted to answer in the way that they thought the \\"average Negro male\\", \\"average Negro female\\", \\"average White male\\", or \\"average White female\\" would respond. The survey addressed aspects of temperament such as emotional stability, thoughtfulness, and sociability. The results indicated better personality adjustment when the participants were asked to answer as if they were White. Bayton theorized that this tendency to associate positive temperament with Whites may have resulted from an inclination to \\"idealize the aggressor\\" and \\"incorporate his negative views\\" towards views of the minority group.Bayton, J., Austin, L., & Burke, K. (1965). Negro perception of Negro and white personality traits. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 1(3), 250-253. Bayton was prominent amongst the psychologists of his time in his efforts to advance minority group participation in professional psychology. In his article, \\"Minority groups and careers in psychology\\" he reported on the National Institute of Mental Health conference in 1969. The major topic discussed at this conference was the issue of how to produce more Black and minority Ph.D.s in psychology. Bayton addressed the need for an increased number of minority psychologists in the field in order to develop psychological programs focused on the needs of minority groups. He also referenced the importance of equal opportunity in the field. He reviewed the obstacles to increasing the number of minority psychologists in the field, such as the perception amongst students that psychology is a risky or nontraditional route for a minority member to pursue professionally. He claimed that these students had to be shown that possibilities exist in psychology for minority students, perhaps through the use of brochures or films to be circulated at various institutions. While graduate programs were attempting to recruit Black students in psychology, Bayton suggested that undergraduate psychology programs needed to increase their efforts to attract Black students to the field. He also addressed the issue of quality of education and lack of resources at primarily black institutions. Bayton suggested an attempt to gain federal and private funding for black students at predominately black colleges in order to ensure competent faculty and adequate resources. He proposed requesting funding to create summer programs for undergraduates that could aid in exposure to psychology for minority students at schools lacking psychology programs. He also emphasized the need to continue holding conferences of this nature in the future.Bayton, J., Roberts, S., & Williams, R. (1970). Minority groups and careers in psychology. American Psychologist, 25(6), 504-510. In another paper, \\"Reflections and Suggestions for Further Study Concerning the Higher Education of Negroes,\\" Bayton reported on another conference that took place in April, 1967. He addressed similar issues regarding how to improve the state of affairs for Black students in higher education.Bayton, J., Lewis, H. & The Journal of Negro Education Editorial Committee. (1967). Reflections and Suggestions for Further Study Concerning the Higher Education of Negroes. The Journal of Negro Education, 286-294. Throughout his career, Bayton conducted significant research in the area of consumer behavior. His paper, \\"Motivation, Cognition, Learning—Basic Factors in Consumer Behavior,\\" drew attention to the role of psychological theories as lenses for research in consumer behavior. While he acknowledged that marketing at the time addressed psychological theories of motivation, he claimed that theories of cognition and learning were neglected in consumer behavior research. Bayton explained the importance of cognitive processes in consumer behavior, for one, by explaining what determines whether or not we remember a particular product. In addressing theories of learning, Bayton outlined the role of reinforcement in determining whether a consumer will purchase a good repeatedly and explained the formation of consumer habits as a lessening of conscious decision-making while making a purchase.Bayton, J. (1958). Motivation, Cognition, Learning: Basic Factors in Consumer Behavior. Journal of Marketing, 22(3), 282-289. Other research contributions made by Bayton pertained to sex differences in decision making, issues of race in military settings, Blacks' decision making in dialysis, Black attitudes regarding kidney transplantation, and Blacks' blood donation and organ and tissue transplantation.  Legacy  Bayton's research interests were widespread. He furthered psychological research in areas of personality, race, social issues, and consumer psychology. His research was generally of an applied nature, and thus, his efforts helped increase the scope and depth of applied work in the field of psychology. In particular, several studies conducted by Bayton foreshadowed the emergence of system-justification theory, which addresses the tendency to support the status-quo or the \\"system,\\" even when the \\"system\\" may not be beneficial to an individual or group. In particular, the idea of out-group favoritism (a subset of system-justification theory), or viewing a high-status group positively and one's own low-status group more negatively, emerges in Bayton's research.Jost, J., (2001). \\"Outgroup favoritism and the theory of system justification: A paradigm for investigating the effects of socioeconomic success on stereotype content.\\". Cognitive social psychology: The Princeton symposium on the legacy and future of social cognition: 89–102. In his study, \\"Negro perception of Negro and white personality traits,\\" he found that Black participants perceived Whites as having more positive temperaments than Blacks. He theorized that this bias resulted from a tendency to \\"idealize the aggressor\\" and \\"incorporate his negative views\\" into participants' views of their minority group. In other words, out-group favoritism emerged in this study, and the participants appeared to support a racial hierarchy, or \\"system,\\" that was not beneficial to these subjects. Additionally, in another of Bayton's studies, \\"Evaluative Race-Class Stereotypes by Race and Perceived Class of Subjects,\\" subjects assigned more advantageous traits to the middle as opposed to the lower class regardless of their own class. This study also illustrates a tendency for people to justify the \\"system\\", or in other words, support the American ideal of a social meritocracy whether or not this \\"system\\" is truly just or beneficial to them. Additionally, Bayton made important efforts throughout his career to increase the number of minorities in psychology and improve educational opportunities for Black people. According to Sherman Ross and Leslie H. Hicks of Howard University, Bayton was \\"always responsive to students and colleagues\\" and was \\"never too busy or uninterested.\\" They also described him as a \\"model professor and researcher.\\"  Publications  * Ph.D. thesis \\"Interrelations between levels of aspiration, performance, and estimates of past performances\\"  Journal of Farm Economics  * \\"Discussion: New Techniques in Consumer Preference Research\\" * \\"Contributions of Psychology to the Microeconomic Analysis of Consumer Demand for Food\\"  Journal of Applied Psychology  * \\"Men and women executives and processes related to decision accuracy\\" * \\"Self-concept and Blacks' assessment of Black leading roles in motion pictures and television\\" * \\"Method of single stimulus determinations of taste preferences\\" * \\"Comparative and single stimulus methods in determining taste preferences\\"  Journal of Marketing  * \\"Motivation, Cognition, Learning: Basic Factors in Consumer Behavior\\"  The Journal of Negro Education  * \\"An Exploratory Study of the Role of the Negro Press\\" * \\"The Guidance Dilemma: With Special Reference to the Guidance of Negro Youth\\" * \\"Race-Class Stereotypes\\" * \\"Book Review: Desegregation Resistance and Readiness\\" * \\"The Psychology of Racial Morale\\" * \\"Reflections and Suggestions for Further Study Concerning the Higher Education of Negroes\\" * \\"Racio-National Stereotypes Held by Negroes\\" * \\"Book Review: The Education of Black Philadelphia\\" * \\"Personality Needs, Social Status, and Preferences for an \\"Ideal Woman\\" in Black and White College Males\\"  Growth & Change  * \\"Research is the Answer\\"  Journal of Research in Personality  * \\"Validity of Adler's active-constructive, active-destructive, passive- constructive, and passive-destructive typology\\"  Journal of Psychology  * \\"Categories of Attitudes Toward Behavior and the Attitude-Behavior Relationship\\" * \\"Correlations Between Levels of Aspiration\\" * \\"Personality and Prejudice\\" * \\"Persons, Situations, Subjective Expected Utilities, and Assertive Behavioral Intentions\\"  Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology  * \\"Validity of two scoring systems for measuring cognitive development with the Rorschach\\"  Journal of General Psychology * \\"Duration of Success Background and the Effect of Failure Upon Performance\\"  Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology * \\"Personality dynamics during success-failure sequences\\"  Journal of Personality and Social Psychology * \\"Evaluative Race—Class Stereotypes by Race and Perceived Class of Subjects\\" * \\"Negro perception of Negro and white personality traits\\"  American Psychologist * \\"Minority Groups and Careers in Psychology\\" * \\"Francis Sumner, Max Meenes, and the training of Black psychologists\\" * \\"Opportunities for Negroes in psychology\\"  Books  * (1941 and 1945?)

Quirino Page 74Muzikland 30 June 2006 Mona Fong – Mona Fong Meets Carding Cruz Affiliations In the late 50s Diamond obtained a franchise from US Mercury and release many singles – mainly Patti Page The Diamonds and The Crew Cuts and together with US Decca issues on their Echo label they dominated the Hong Kong Charts and even more so when they obtained a Coral agreement and Teresa Brewer, The McGuire Sisters and later Buddy Holly and The Crickets also had huge success. ABC then allowed releases and Paul Anka became a real favourite of the Chinese teenagers and nearly all his singles at that time charted. Strange results from the HK Hit Parade of 1959 saw good sales for titles which hardly listed anywhere else – The Crew Cuts 'Be My Only Love' challenged the Diamonds Little Darlin' and Anka's Late Last Night was a huge success – not many singles were pressed by Diamond due to capacity problems so Airplay on Radio Hong Kong, Commercial Radio Hong Kong, Rediffusion and Radio Sai Wan (RAF Station Radio) were compiled for chart listings. Dot and Roulette pressings were added later and one Mercury release had little to do with the US but charted as the Yee Tin Tong Mandolin Band playing Caio Caio Bambina b/w Oh Marie. It was, for some time available on YouTube but has since disappeared. Although Ren Da Silva owned the company it was his daughter who was the leading light in the singles world and to her must go much of the credit for bringing US and UK music of the late 1950s to the young Chinese students of the time. This 1950s period has been largely neglected but those who were in Hong Kong with the British military will remember the breakthrough Miss Da Silva achieved. In the early 1960s, Diamond was the only record pressing in the area at the time. It handled Mercury Record Corporation product on a licensing agreement basis. Taking a trip to the U.S., managing director da Silva visited the Chicago Mercury headquarters in August 1961 to discuss expansion in the area for manufacturing plant and distribution facilities. He also was in the U.S. to meet with Willem Langenberg the head of Philips group to discuss the coordination of a three way arrangement that would involve Mercury, Philips and Diamond.Billboard Music Week 14 August 1961 Page 4 Mercury Preps Strong Far East Distribution Artists Rock bands In the mid-1960s the label started taking on guitar driven bands such as Philip Chan and the Astronotes, Danny Diaz and the Checkmates, Teddy Robin and the Playboys, and The Anders Nelsson group.

The country offers a variety of habitats for wildlife including the coast, offshore islands, mangrove areas, mudflats, salt pans, sand and gravel plains, sand dunes, mountain slopes, wadis and rocky summits. Because the terrain is so varied, it supports a greater number of species of plants and animals than might have been expected in this relatively small country. Geography Hatta, in the region of the Western Hajar Mountains The United Arab Emirates occupy a corner of Arabia bounded by Saudi Arabia to the west and south, Oman to the east, the Gulf of Oman and Oman to the northeast and the Persian Gulf to the north. The northern coast stretches for about along the southern shore of the Persian Gulf and largely consists of salt pans that extend inland. There are numerous offshore islands, the ownership of some of which is disputed with neighbouring states. To the south is the Rub' al Khali desert, an enormous expanse of billowing sand dunes. Two large oases in the east are the Liwa Oasis, near the undefined border with Saudi Arabia, and Al-Buraimi Oasis, which includes Al Ain on the UAE side of the border with Oman. To the east, the land rises and becomes mountainous, this being the northwestern end of Al Hajar Mountains, of which Jebel Hafeet near Al-Ain may be considered an outlier, and which include the Ru'us al-Jibal (literally \\"Heads of the Mountains\\") in the Musandam Peninsula. Beyond these, the coast on the Gulf of Oman is rugged. In the southeast of the country, near the border with Oman, there is a man-made lake, Lake Zakher, formed as a result of the release of waste water from the desalination plants on which the UAE relies for its freshwater supplies. The lake has formed as the groundwater rose, and many birds now visit the lake. Flora Acacia tortilis in a mountainous landscape in Fujairah A wide range of plants is associated with the many types of habitat in the United Arab Emirates. One of these types is the sabkha, an area in which salty water has flooded the land shallowly and later evaporated, leaving crusty salt pans. These occur on the western part of the Gulf Coast but also among dunes inland. The plants found on their edges are salt-tolerant members of Salicornioideae and Zygophyllum. At inland sites Zygophyllum qatarense predominates along with grasses such as Aeluropus lagopoides and Panicum turgidum. Sandy plains further east along the coast from the sabkha region have occasional dwarf tamarisk trees and such plants as Salsola imbricata and Zygophyllum mandavillei, and in coastal lagoons, and in creeks further east, the white mangrove is plentiful. Mangroves are also found in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, particularly in a national park to the east of the island of Abu Dhabi. Cornulaca monacantha Plants of the gravel plains further east again include Cornulaca monacantha, Crotalaria persica, Calotropis procera and Taverniera spartea, and the parasitic desert hyacinth and the desert thumb. As the land rises up towards the mountains, the mesquite tree, an invasive species from Central America, has become established. The plains around Ras al-Khaimah in the northeast of the country, between the mountains and the sea, are the most heavily cultivated part of the country. The mountains have a cooler, more temperate climate and here there is an abundance of Alpine flowers among the rocks, on slopes and in cracks, fissures and wadis. Jabal Hafeet and the nearby Wadi Tarabat are home to rare flora unique to the region, such as Acridocarpus orientalis. Fauna Over four hundred species of bird have been recorded in the United Arab Emirates, with about ninety species breeding regularly in the country while the balance are winter visitors, migrants or vagrants. The country is on the crossroads of two major migratory routes, one between the Palaearctic and Africa, the other between the Near East and the Indian subcontinent, and the migrants make use of the many types of habitat available. The sooty falcon breeds in the UAE About 250,000 waders visit the Gulf shores and mudflats at peak migration time; these include the grey plover, the greater and lesser sand plovers, the crab plover, the Kentish plover and the broad-billed sandpiper. The coast, and particularly offshore islands are used by many seabirds. About twenty to thirty percent of the world's Socotra cormorants, about 200,000 birds, breed in the United Arab Emirates, but they are under threat from fishermen who fear for their livelihoods. Sooty gulls breed here, as do red-billed tropicbirds as well as several species of tern; white-cheeked, bridled and lesser crested tern.

Twelve species of wheatear have been recorded in the country as well as warblers, babblers, rollers, bulbuls, the desert lark and many others. The sooty falcon overwinters in Madagascar and breeds in the United Arab Emirates. Other than this, there are only a small number of raptor species; Bonelli's eagle, barbary falcon, short-toed snake eagle, long-legged buzzard and lappet-faced vulture. An Arabian wolf in Al Ain Many of the large mammals found in the Arabian Peninsula were well-adapted to desert life in the harsh terrain, but were wiped out by human hunting in the last hundred years or so. Hunting is now banned in the United Arab Emirates, but feral goats and donkeys are plentiful and graze indiscriminately, lessening the chance for the native gazelles to recover from their reduced population sizes. Large terrestrial mammals still found in the United Arab Emirates include the Arabian tahr, the Arabian oryx, the sand gazelle and the mountain gazelle. Carnivores include the Arabian wolf, the striped hyena, the red fox, the Blanford's fox, the Rüppell's fox, the Asiatic caracal, the Arabian wildcat, the sand cat and formerly the Arabian leopard. Other mammals include the Cape hare, the Brandt's hedgehog, the desert hedgehog and the long-eared hedgehog. Blanford's fox The Egyptian fruit bat is found here during most of the year, but moves around according to the availability of fruit. Insectivorous bats include the sac-winged bat, the mouse-tailed bat and the leaf-nosed bat. Small rodents include the lesser Egyptian jerboa, the Cheesman's gerbil and the Balochistan gerbil. Rather larger rodents are the Libyan jird and the Sundevall's jird which both favour desert habitats. The Cairo spiny mouse was found in the mountains for the first time in 1995. Over 54 species of terrestrial reptiles have been recorded in the UAE. These include a large number of lizards, found in all environments from desert, to city, to mountain-top, and a single species of worm lizard. There are thirteen species of terrestrial snake, some of the largest being the sand boa, the saw-scaled viper and the horned viper, and four species of sea snake as well as green sea turtles present in the Persian Gulf. The Ru'us al-Jibal have a gecko of the genus Ptyodactylus named after them. There are two species of amphibian in the United Arab Emirates, the Arabian toad and the Dhofar toad; the former is more commonly seen as the Dhofar toad is nocturnal. Sharjah's Breeding Centre for Endangered Arabian Wildlife (BCEAW) was established on 1998 and originally built for breeding the threatened wildlife but then has turned to become a center for the research and preservation of the indigenous plants and animals of the region.Breeding Centre for Endangered Arabian Wildlife. Environment and Protected Areas Authority, (Sharjah). In February 2019, the Environment Agency Abu Dhabi recorded the sighting of an Arabian caracal in Jebel Hafeet National Park in the region of Al-Ain, the first such sighting in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi since 1984. The houbara is protected in the United Arab Emirates. In February 2019, 50 birds were released into the desert in Al-Ain Region in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, to help conserve the birds and increase their number in the wild.

It is made of andesite stone, depicting a giant with a terrifying face. The style is that of a dvarapala. Based on the style, it is suggested that it was made in the 10th century. Physical features The face and other ornaments also suggest that it is a representation of a female butå.ogre, demon, or giant This is unusual since most dvarapala statues show male characteristics. Arca Totok Kerot is 3 meters tall. The hair is matted, covering the upper part of the back. A kind of tiara with a glimpse of skull is seen above the forehead covering the ears. The eyes are protruding, creating a terrifying effect, as if it were angry. Like many other dvarapala statues, it kneels on one knee. The left knee touches the ground while the right knee is erected, on which the right hand is laid. The left hand is missing, so it is unknown if it originally held a gådå (mace) like other dvarapala statues. All hands and legs are wearing binggêl (bracelets). The nipples are clearly shown on the breast, another indication that it is female. It wears a necklace of skulls, usually worn by worshipers of Durga or Shiva. A girdle is encircling its waist, on which some kind of skirt is hanging. Discovery and excavation The statue was discovered in 1981. In 2013, due to an imminent plan by the local government to enlarge the road near Arca Totok Kerot, an excavation was hastily carried out searching for other archaeological remains.http://surabaya.tribunnews.com/2013/02/17/tak-ada- temuan-benda-purbakala-di-totok-kerot The excavation was conducted by the East Java Hall of Cultural Heritage Preservation (Balai Pelestarian Cagar Budaya Jawa Timur). The possibility was considered because dvarapala statues were usually placed to guard a temple complex or other important sites. The excavation took place for six days. The team dug an average 1.5 meters into the surrounding ground, in some points even 4 meters. However, no other archaeological remains were found. Eventually, the excavation was terminated and the cavities were filled. The road in front of the statue was then enlarged. Folklore related to the statue Tales were abound surrounding the statue. Some were already documented and many others were still transmitted orally. Some tales related the statue to the legendary character Calon Arang, but such connection was refuted by Timoer (1981). Others were connected to the legendary king Jayabaya (Santosa, 2005). See also * Totok Kerot * Kediri Regency * Candi of Indonesia Notes References * Timoer, Soenarto (1981).

As president of the Judicial Yuan, he administered China's court system from 1932 to 1948. He ran in the presidential election of 1948 as the token opponent of Chiang Kai-shek. He was also known by his courtesy name Juesheng (Chueh-sheng). Life and career Ju was born in Huangzhou in Hubei Province on November 8, 1876. He joined the Tongmenghui, a revolutionary party founded by Sun Yat-sen, while studying law at Nihon University in Japan in 1907. Later, he worked for Chinese-language newspapers in Rangoon and Singapore. He returned to China to work for an anti-Qing revolutionary faction in Hubei. In 1912, he was briefly vice minister of the interior in the Provisional Government in Nanjing with Sun as president. He was commander of the Woosung Forts north of Shanghai during the Second Revolution in July 1913. In 1916, he led an uprising against Yuan Shikai in Shandong and briefly captured the city of Weixian. In 1921, Sun appointed him interior minister for the Nationalist administration in Guangzhou. Ju was a founding member of the Western Hills Group, formed after Sun died in 1925. This group opposed communist influence in the KMT. Ju was appointed president of the Judicial Yuan by Chiang in 1932. This was one of the five branches of government in the KMT system. In the presidential election of April 20, 1948, Ju was persuaded to oppose Chiang's candidacy and received 10 percent of the vote in the National Assembly, with Chiang elected overwhelmingly.Chief Juan-Keef, The Government and Politics of China, 1912–1949, 1970, Stanford University Press, p. 303. The vote was 2,430 to 269. After he resigned as president of the Judicial Yuan on July 1, 1948, Ju was appointed to the Control Yuan, an auditing board.

Prečista Krajinska () is the name for the ruins of a church located in the region of Skadarska Krajina, southern Montenegro. It was the second burial site of Jovan Vladimir, the ruler of Duklja (ca. 1000–1016), after his widow Kosara renewed it and transferred his remains from Prespa. The relics drew many devotees to the church, which became a center of pilgrimage. Kosara was interred in the church, at the feet of her husband, on her request. In around 1215—when Krajina was under the rule of Serbian Grand Prince Stefan Nemanjić—the relics were presumably removed from this church and transported to Dyrrhachium by the troops of Michael I, the despot of Epirus. At that time Despot Michael had briefly captured from Serbia the city of Skadar, which is only about east of the church. The monastery was mentioned in 1417 in a Cetinje manuscript. The Balšić family reconstructed the monastery in the 15th century. The monastery became the seat of a Catholic bishopric, as part of the Catholic-Venetian expansion. The bishop, who was employed in an Orthodox region, saw resistance in the area from the Serbian Orthodox.

Directed by Mario Nalpas and Henri Étiévant and set in the West Indies, the film tells the story of a native girl named Papitou (Baker) who falls in love with a French man named André Berval (Pierre Batcheff). Plot The film is set in a fictional colony called Monte Puebla. Monte Puebla incorporates many colonial stereotypes, with the name suggesting that it could be a Spanish colony, the grass skirts and roofs suggesting a Polynesian influence, and the clothing being a jumble of multiple cultures.Guterl, Matthew Pratt. “Josephine Baker's Colonial Pastiche”. Black Camera 1.2 (2010): 25–37. The story begins when a rich Parisian man named Marquis Sévéro wishes to divorce his wife and marry his goddaughter, Denise, but Denise is in love with an engineer named André Berval. In order to get rid of Berval, Marquis Sévéro sends him to the West Indies as a prospector, promising that he can marry Denise once he returns. After arriving in the West Indies, Berval meets a woman named Papitou. Papitou quickly falls in love with him, unaware of the fact that he is planning on marrying Denise upon his return to Paris. When Berval leaves the West Indies to return home Papitou follows him, despite the fact that he has a fiancé. Once she arrives in Paris, Papitou accepts that Berval loves only Denise, and finds her true calling as a music hall performer.

Identical apart from their engines, they flew in mid-1930. Design In 1929 Dyle and Bacalan were reformed as Société Aérienne Bordelaise (SAB) who continued to work on its predecessor's designs, distinguished by their DB numbering as well as on their own, which had AB numbers. The DB-80 originated with Dyle and Bacalan but was not flown until 1930, built by SAB. It was Dyle and Bacalan's last design and a small aircraft by their standards but maintained their all-metal tradition. The DB-80 was aimed at the airmail market and was a single-engine, high-wing aircraft giving easy access by two port-side doors to a well-lit cabin with two passenger seats and to a separate mail compartment behind them. The pilot sat ahead of the passengers under the wing leading edge. Two differently engined versions were built: the DB-80 had a Hispano-Suiza 6P six-cylinder, upright water-cooled inline and the DB-81 a Lorraine 5Pc five-cylinder radial engine. The latter was mounted on a hinged frame for easy servicing. The Hispano engined had a Lamblin radiator on the fuselage underside. The fuselage was built around four longerons, with rectangular frames and covered in longitudinally ribbed duralumin. Its underside was smoothly bellied, its upper side flat. In plan its taper was delayed until aft of the cabin. Its empennage was conventional, with a straight-tapered, blunt-topped fin and unbalanced rudder, the latter cut away at its base to allow for movement of the one-piece elevator mounted on a triangular tailplane at mid-fuselage height. Like the fuselage, all the tail surfaces were covered with ribbed duralumin. The DB-80 had a fixed, tailwheel undercarriage with track of . The mainwheels were independently mounted and fitted with brakes. Each axle was mounted at the lower vertex of a triangular box acting as a cantilever leg, with its upper side hinged from the fuselage longerons. The strengthened forward edge of the structure extended above the hinge and connected to an elastic block housed in a reinforced transverse beam which passed under the cockpit, incorporating shock absorbers. The DB-80's high, cantilever wing was unusual both in its construction and high aspect ratio of 9. In plan it was straight tapered on both edges but with semi- elliptical tips curved particularly on the trailing edges, where its ailerons were full span and broad. The wing was built around three spars, rather than the traditional one or two, and the detail of their caps or flanges, rather than the shape of the longitudinal braces or ribs, determined the airfoil profile. A similar but not identical wing structure was used on the Dyle et Bacalan DB-20. Development In late March 1930 the DB-80's test flights were awaiting better weather; a month later tests were underway but the first flight did not take place until 27 June 1930. The Lorraine powered DB-81 flew in August, after which testing of the pair continued successfully though interrupted by SAB test pilot Charles Deschamps' absence at Villacoublay for official trials of the DB-20. In October the DB-80 was re-engined with a Lorraine and renamed DB-81. There is no record of any further examples being built nor of measured performance figures. Variants ;DB-80: Hispano-Suiza 6P upright six cylinder, water-cooled inline engine. Re-engined with Lorraine in October 1930, becoming second DB-81.

Altogether 100 numbers were issued every two weeks, at the first and fifteenth day of each Maliye-month respectively, totaling 20 pages. The page format more or less equaling the German DIN-size A3 as well as new printing techniques like the three-color printing with countless photographs and illustrations make the journal especially remarkable. The examples inspiring this journal in its design as well as its content were French magazines like Figaro Salon or L'Illustration. The journal aimed at propagating spiritual as well as technical progress and at covering a wide range of topics with articles on political and social sciences as well as jurisprudence right up to pieces from the fields of natural sciences, technology and philosophy. Furthermore, female readers were informed on parenting, women’s rights and their role in society. Pages on the latest historical events were part of the journal as were articles on sports and fine arts. Pieces on music were of special importance, they were mostly accounted for by the editor himself, writing under the pseudonym Bedi Mensi. Entertainment pages featured Ottoman as well as English and American stories and novels. In addition to that, several plays and poems of known writers were printed. Numerous contests involved the readers in the production of the journal and were meant to stimulate cultural life.

The station is the host of the ZM network, and is owned and operated by New Zealand Media and Entertainment. Several stations have been set up since 2002 to carry ZM programmes from Auckland with local advertisements — ZM Gisborne in 2002, ZM Wanganui in 2004, ZM South Canterbury in September 2004, ZM Wairarapa in 2010, ZM Taupo in 2013, ZM Queenstown in 2014 and ZM Wanaka in May 2016. History ZM was first started by the government-owned Radio New Zealand as three separate AM radio stations in Auckland (1ZM), Wellington (2ZM) and Christchurch (3ZM) in 1973; however, all these stations had been on air under different identities in earlier decades. The Auckland 1ZM station changed format to Classic Hits in 1987 and went on to become they first Classic Hits branded station creating a 10-year absence of the ZM brand in Auckland. Wellington and Christchurch ZM stations carried on as two separate local stations, switching to FM and spawning their own regional networks. In July 1996 the New Zealand Government sold off the commercial arm of Radio New Zealand, which included, among other things, the ZM stations. The new owner was The Radio Network, a subsidiary of APN News & Media and Clear Channel Communications, which operated as a division of the Australian Radio Network. ZM made a return to the Auckland market in February 1997 as a local station broadcasting on 91.0 MHz as 91ZM. This move was made by The Radio Network after purchasing stations in Auckland and the Waikato previously owned by Prospect Media. TRN closed Auckland station The Breeze on 91 and replaced this station with 91ZM. In Waikato The Breeze on 89.8 was closed and replaced with a network feed of Auckland's 91ZM branded as 89.8ZM. The Waikato station did contain its own local breakfast show between 1998 and 1999. In 2000 ZM was consolidated into a single network feed with all programming on the networked ZM stations now originating from the 91ZM Auckland station. Between 2001 and 2014 the ZM breakfast show presented by Pauline Gillespie and Grant Kereama was networked from Wellington to a nationwide audience including Auckland. In recent years the 10 am – 3 pm the announcer produced a localised show for Auckland with local voice breaks for Auckland listeners and then a generic voice break for the rest of New Zealand. As of 2013 all ZM stations contain the same content.

It is a station of the ZM network, and is owned and operated by New Zealand Media and Entertainment. History ZM was first started in the Northland town of Whangarei in 1995 by Radio New Zealand broadcasting on 93.1 MHz as 93ZM. At the time local ZM stations were operating in Wellington as 91ZM Wellington and Christchurch as 91ZM Christchurch. A ZM station did previously exist in Auckland as 1ZM but this station became the very first Classic Hits station in 1987. In July 1996 the New Zealand Government sold off the commercial arm of Radio New Zealand, which included, among other things, the ZM stations. The new owner was The Radio Network, a subsidiary of APN News & Media and Clear Channel Communications, which operated as a division of the Australian Radio Network. In 1997 new owner The Radio Network began expanding the ZM brand to other markets, a new local station was established in Auckland as 91ZM Auckland (creating a return to the Auckland market). Networked ZM stations were also introduced from 1996 onwards. In 1997 93ZM became a network station with programming originating from the 91ZM Auckland studios and Auckland announcers producing pre-recorded local voice breaks to a Whangarei audience, some announcers from 93ZM were relocated to Auckland. The breakfast show on 93ZM originally remained local but in 1998 announcers Jaala Dyer and Sandy Antipas were moved to Hamilton to produce a local breakfast for 89.8ZM Waikato with the show networked back to Whangarei. In 2000 ZM switched to a single network feed and the Waikato-based breakfast show was discontinued. From 2000 onwards 93ZM heard the same Auckland based announcers but the local voice breaks were dropped in favour of single nationwide voicebreaks in all markets. At this point the announcers simply called the station ZM. In 2005 93ZM moved from 93.1 to 93.2 MHz and in 2006 93ZM traded places on the Northland radio dial with Radio Hauraki 93ZM shifted to 95.1 MHz and Hauraki took over ZM's vacated 93.2 MHz frequency. On air the station was now known as 95.1ZM. In 2010 ZM in Whangarei moved to 94.8 MHz as part of the government move to re-align radio frequencies around New Zealand.

It extended from a junction at Roseworthy on the Morgan railway line through Hamley Bridge, Riverton, initially to Tarlee, then extended in stages to Peterborough. History The Burra Burra railway was initially proposed as early as 1850, before any other railways north from Port Adelaide. Before anything was done about this, the Gawler railway line was built in 1857, and extended to Kapunda in 1860 (and eventually to Morgan in 1878, see Morgan railway line). The first stage of the broad gauge Burra line from a junction at Roseworthy to Forresters (now Tarlee) opened on 3 July 1869. It extended to Manoora on 21 February 1870, Burra on 29 August 1870, Hallett on 10 March 1878 and Terowie on 14 December 1880. Terowie was a break of gauge station with the line continuing north to Peterborough as a narrow gauge line, opening on 11 May 1881. On 12 January 1970, this 22.9-kilometre section was converted to broad gauge, thus making Peterborough the break of gauge point with the narrow gauge Peterborough to Quorn and standard gauge Port Pirie to Broken Hill lines. Regular Australian National passenger services ceased in December 1986, with the line north of Hallett closed on 26 July 1988, followed by the Burra to Hallet section on 14 November 1990.Minutes 30 March 2011 Heritage Advisory Committee, Regional Council of Goyder The line north of Burra was removed in 1992/93. The last passenger train was a SteamRanger train hauled by steam locomotive 621 on 19 September 1992.

History The earliest part of the narrow gauge Hamley Bridge-Gladstone line opened from Balaklava to Blyth on 14 March 1876 as part of the Port Wakefield line. On 15 January 1880, the line opened from Hamley Bridge to Balaklava. It was extended north from Blyth to Gladstone on 2 July 1894 where it joined the Port Pirie- Cockburn and Wilmington lines. The line was gauge converted to on 1 August 1927. The line from Gulnare to Gladstone closed on 11 May 1988, followed by the Balaklava to Gulnare section on 29 March 1989. The section track between Balaklava and Gladstone was removed in late 1989, and the 10 km section between Halbury and Balaklava has now been converted into the Shamus Liptrot Cycling Trail. As Balaklava railway station was originally on the Port Wakefield to Blyth line, before the railway from Hamley Bridge was built, and the new line entered the town from the south-east, trains using the route between Gladstone and Adelaide needed to change direction at Balaklava, as both the north and south lines entered the station from the east, with Port Wakefield being to the west. The \\"Western System\\" included the railway from Hamley Bridge to Gladstone, along with the lines from Balaklava through Port Wakefield, Kadina and Wallaroo, and the line from Kadina through Snowtown to Brinkworth.

Because it is run entirely by volunteers the vast majority of this annual turnover is spent directly on its East Africa operations. Education Partnerships Africa accounts submission - The Charity Commission History The charity began life in 1990 as The Kisii Project. In the early 1990s a group of Cambridge University students began teaching in a school in the Kisii area of Western Kenya.Education Partnerships Africa History video By 1995, Kisii Project had been incorporated into Link Africa (now Link Community Development)Link Community Development - History and extended to another two schools in the region. A few years later, the focus of the project was switched to resource investment to ensure sustainability. In 2002 the project expanded to Oxford University and started sending 20 Project Workers a year to work in 10 schools in Kisii. The two university projects combined as a registered charity under the name The Kenya Project, which was later changed to Kenya Education Partnerships. From 2009 the charity began a period of expansion of its UK operations to a number of London universities, starting by recruiting Project Workers from University College London; the project went on to accept applications from all universities in London. In 2008, violence following the disputed 2007 elections in Kenya made it unsafe for volunteers to be sent to Kenya so the charity moved its operations to Uganda for one summer. In 2010 it expanded to working in Kakamega, also in Western Kenya, and in 2013 it permanently expanded its operations to Mbarara in Uganda.\\"Volunteering in Uganda With Education Partnerships Africa\\", London School of Economics Careers References   External links *EPAfrica official website Educational charities based in the United Kingdom Foreign charities operating in Kenya Foreign charities operating in Uganda ","title":"Education Partnerships Africa"},{"id":"48689466","text":"Christian Manrique Christian Manrique Valdor (born 1975 in Santander, Spain) is a Spanish civil engineer and the CEO and founder of Soulware Global Development.

It was used as an independent school for girls until 2016.  History  The earliest certain documentary reference to Lavant House dates from 1762–3. Architectural analysis of the building, its photographic depictions and an eighteenth- century watercolour suggest that it was built between 1707 and 1725. Richard Budgen's map of Sussex (1723–24) shows two houses considered worthy of note in the manor of West Lavant, of which one is undoubtedly West Lavant Farm (built 1711), while the other is believed to be Lavant House.  Sir John Miller  Its first definite owner was Sir John Miller, 4th baronet, whose family had been prominent in Chichester first as justices of the peace and mayors then becoming members of parliament from the later 17th century. Sir John had enclosed the park at West Lavant by 1740, after which he may have lived in the first incarnation of Lavant House (the central section of the present building). The Duke of Newcastle's brother, Henry Pelham, wrote to the Duke saying, \\"you know my thoughts on Sir John, he is as friendly and honest as the day is long\\". This has to be balanced with the fact that the 2nd Duke of Richmond could relate to the Duke of Newcastle that Sir John had stated that he did not care a fart for his father-in-law, Dr. Combs. Sir John is believed to be depicted as a lesser figure in a 1759 painting by George Stubbs showing the 3rd Duke of Richmond out hunting (this hangs in the front hall at Goodwood House). He died in 1772 and his relict Dame Susanna remained at Lavant House until her death in 1788 when the house was put on the market by her eldest son, Sir Thomas Miller, who had by then moved to live in Hampshire.The European Magazine, and London Review, volume 14 (1788), p. 79.  Third Duke of Richmond  In 1791 the house was bought by the 3rd Duke of Richmond, who let it to Lord Bathurst. In 1798 the Duke started work on the house. Apparently this was when the house was reoriented to face north (maps show the drive originally approaching from the south). He appears to have died (in 1806) while the project was underway. The next inhabitant was Henriette Ann Le Clerc, thought to have been the Duke’s illegitimate daughter. It was in Henriette's bedroom in Richmond House in London where in 1791 the fire started which destroyed that building.The events are recorded in the Annual Register of 1791 Henriette was brought from France by his sister, Lady Louisa Conolly, in 1778 at age 5 to live at her Goodwood estate. His will named her the first beneficiary, receiving life tenure of West Lavant House and Park and other lands and farms. She married Colonel (later General) John Dorrien on 28 March 1808. John and Henriette’s only child, Charles (the traditional Lennox family name), was born in Lavant in January 1809. Following John’s death in 1825, Henriette ran her estate, which she mentions in a series of letters to the 5th Duke.Goodwood archive at the West Sussex Record Office. She remained much of the time at Lavant. Forty years after she had moved into Lavant House, the Agricultural Gazette announced her death on 6 January 1846. The house then returned to the Goodwood Estate and was rented to a series of tenants.  Twentieth century  In 1907 the house was sold to Mr Morrison and family. He was probably responsible for the dining room decoration. The house was then sold to Major Henry Frederic Low and family. In 1921 his widow sold it to Major Julian Day and Isabella. She then sold the building to the independent Lavant House School, a member of the Girls' Schools Association. The school closed in the summer of 2016.

He was Minister of Interior, Public Works and Housing during the Mauricio Macri's administration. He is the son of Octavio Frigerio, an agricultural engineer and politician, and Sisi Adam, expert on psychophysical re-education and body language. In 2011 he was elected Legislator of the City of Buenos Aires for Republican Proposal. Between 2013 and 2015 he served as President of the Bank of the City of Buenos Aires. His grandfather was Rogelio Julio Frigerio, an important journalist and politician, who was a founding member of both Intransigent Radical Civic Union (Spanish: Unión Cívica Radical Intransigente, UCRI) and Integration and Development Movement (Spanish: Movimiento de Integración y Desarrollo, MID). He was also the Secretary of Socio-economic Relations at Arturo Frondizi´s administration (1958-1962). He is considered to be one of the most important people in the history of Argentina's political thought: he was the main driving force behind the theory of developmentalism in this country. As his grandfather, Rogelio Frigerio supports developmentalism, and is one of the main figures of the Integration and Development Movement. Training and education Rogelio Frigerio received his secondary studies at Goethe Schule school and holds a degree in Business Administration from the University of Buenos Aires with a major in Planning and Economic Development (1994). In 1985, when he was only 15 years old, Frigerio decided to take part in the Integration and Development Movement (MID) activities as a prelude to his future political career. Throughout his life he had two great educational influences from his parents: a strong political tradition, and a commitment to dialogue and to consider all the issues as a whole (holistic vision). Politics His career in the public sector began during the government of President Carlos Menem, in 1998 - at the age of 28 - was appointed for a year Secretary of Economic Programming of Roque Fernández, the Minister of Economy of the Argentine Nation during the second presidency of Menem between 1995 and 1999. In 1996 he was Undersecretary of Regional Programming.1 Between 1997 and 1999 he served as president of the Trust Fund for Provincial Development. From 1996 to 2000, he was Director of Postgraduate Business Policy at the University of Salvador1 and holder of the Permanent Forum of Budget Directorates. He founded and directed until 2011 the consultant Economy & Regions. He is also president of Federar (Foundation for Economic and Regional Development Studies in Argentina). He was the head of the Argentine Association for the Evaluation of Projects and the Studies Foundation for the Economic and Regional Development of Argentina. It was also Advisor of the OKITA Foundation and co-founder and president of the Argentine Evaluation Association. In 2011 he was elected Legislator of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires by the Republican Proposal (PRO), and chaired the Budget, Finance, Tax Administration and Taxation Commission of the Legislature of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. He became President of Bank of the City of Buenos Aires in 2013. Mauricio Macri, elected President of Argentina in 2015, nominated him to be his Minister of Interior Affairs, Public Works and Housing. Minister of Interior, Public Works and Housing An infrastructure plan was launched that carried out more than 5,800 works; the incorporation of more than 800 thousand people to the drinking water network and 1.5 million to the sewer network; the doubling of the installed capacity for the treatment of sewage liquids with the completion of 20 treatment plants and the commissioning of 20 more; the completion of 140 works to prevent flooding and protect more than 1.4 million people and 3 million productive hectares; the urbanization of 100 vulnerable neighborhoods; a 600% increase in investment in habitat improvement; the granting of more than 130,000 mortgage loans; the realization of 303 works in electrical networks throughout the country. Among the most relevant works, the Matanza Riachuelo System stands out, which will benefit more than 4.5 million residents of the Metropolitan Area and will have demanded an investment of 1,200 million dollars, financed by the World Bank. At the same time, an agenda focused on strengthening and improving transparency indices was promoted. For the first time, bidding documents for public works began to be published online, which had an impact on greater participation of companies and, consequently, on the lowering of the costs of the works. Also, a new objective, public and transparent allocation system for social housing called SiGeBe was developed. A national and federal registry with unified criteria for the selection of beneficiaries with which different levels of the State and NGOs can validate the demand for housing and future awards that are made throughout the country. The Ministry of Interior, Public Works and Housing, began a process to provide autonomy to the provinces by restoring resources and moving towards the strengthening of subnational governments. In that sense, Frigerio reached essential agreements in order to implement regulations to promote a new resource distribution scheme to strengthen federalism. Along these lines, he promoted the signing of the Fiscal Consensus that reimbursed to 22 provinces the 15% of Co-participation that the Nation had withheld since 1992. Also, the increase in direct transfers of resources to the provinces that passed 40% of the federal collection in 2015 to 49.8% in 2019. This helped the fiscal situation improve significantly: by 2015 only eight provinces showed a positive financial result. Three years later, 18 provinces exhibited surpluses. From an institutional point of view, an agenda focused on increasing levels of transparency, electoral equity and strengthening institutions was defined. In that sense, progress was made in the adoption of fundamental laws such as: Law on Access to Public Information; Law on the financing of political parties; Mandatory Presidential Debate Law; Parity Law on lists; Presidential Transition Law (half penalty) and Interest Management Regulation Law (half penalty). The approval of decrees to increase the democratization of political representation was promoted, such as Presidential Decree 259/2019 that eliminated the possibility of the so-called “collecting lists”. Frigerio participated and presented the Argentine position in the following conferences: United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development Habitat III; 58th Annual Meeting of the Board of Governors of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and the 32nd Annual Meeting of the Board of Governors of the Inter-American Investment Corporation (IIC); Business Forum “Intelligent Integration with the World: Promoting Regional Economies and Infrastructure Investment”; III Ibero-American Forum of Mayors, within the framework of the Annual Meeting of the Board of Governors of the IDB; High Level Meeting “Integrity for good governance in Latin America and the Caribbean: from commitments to actions (OECD); China-Latin America and Caribbean Investment Exchange (CLACIE) Meeting, Beijing, China; XXII China-LAC Business Summit, Zhuhai.

Origin As the international situation deteriorated in the late 1930s, the threat of air raids on the UK led to the rapid expansion in numbers of anti-aircraft (AA) units manned by members of the part-time TA. Formed on 1 November 1938, 72nd (Middlesex) was the third of a new group of three TA searchlight regiments raised by the Royal Artillery (previous TA S/L units had all been part of the Royal Engineers and/or converted from infantry battalions).Brigstock.

Shortly afterwards, the regiment moved to Twickenham.

World War II 90 cm Projector Anti-Aircraft, displayed at Fort Nelson, Portsmouth Anti-Aircraft Command mobilised in August 1939, ahead of the declaration of war on 3 September, and the regiment took its place in 47th AA Brigade, part of 5th AA Division tasked with defending Southampton.AA Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files.Routledge, Table LVIII, p. 376; Table LX, p. 378. Southampton was a regular target for raids by the German Luftwaffe during the Battle of Britain in the summer of 1940, but by November 1940 the regiment had transferred to 40 AA Bde in 2nd AA Division in the Midlands. It had the responsibility for covering RAF airfields in the East Midlands and continued in that role throughout the Blitz of 1940–41.2 AA Division at RA 39–35.

The regiment supplied a cadre of experienced officers and men to 237th S/L Training Rgt at Holywood, County Down, where it provided the basis for a new 560 S/L Bty formed on 13 February 1941.

On 1 January 1944, 466 S/L Bty was joined by a troop of 554 S/L Bty from 82nd S/L Rgt. However, as the threat of attack by the weakened Luftwaffe waned, AA Command was being forced to release manpower for the planned invasion of Normandy (Operation Overlord). All Home Defence searchlight regiments were reduced from February 1944, and 72nd S/L Rgt lost 501 S/L Bty, which completed disbandment on 24 March.Routledge, p. 409. Then the War Office warned in June that AA Command would have to release manpower to provide reinforcements to 21st Army Group fighting in North West Europe. The run-down began in September 1944, and the regiment and its three batteries were at Reepham, Norfolk, when they were ordered to begin entering 'suspended animation' on 25 September, with their personnel being posted away.Routledge, pp. 420–1. In fact, on 1 January 1945, the regiment was at Hatfield Militia Camp near Doncaster under the command of 32 AA Bde, where it was joined by 80th and 82nd S/L Rgts. All three were reduced to battery strength and consolidated under the command of RHQ 72nd S/L Rgt. The other ranks of 82nd became 466 S/L Bty of 72nd S/L Rgt, while the officers and staff continued as RHQ 82nd S/L Rgt, which became a holding unit at Southampton for surplus (older or unfit) men from S/L regiments that were being converted into RA infantry regiments.82 S/L Rgt War Diary 1945, TNA file WO 166/16822.

The steamer was built as an extreme shallow-draft vessel, to permit it to reach points on the upper Willamette river such as Corvallis, Harrisburg and Eugene, Oregon during summer months when water levels in the river were generally low. The vessel was also known for having been washed up on a county road in Oregon during a flood in 1890. Nomenclature The steamer was named by the president of the Oregon Pacific Railroad, C.L. Hogg, for the Three Sisters mountains in the central Cascades Mountains of Oregon. Construction Three Sisters was built in 1886 at Portland, Oregon by the Oregon Development Company, which was a branch of the Oregon Pacific Railroad Company. On June 29, 1886, the steamer was to have been inspected by William M. Hoag, general manager of the Oregon Pacific Railroad, and Wallis Nash. The steamer had been recently completed, and if it was found to meet contract requirements, would be accepted into the company’s service. As built in 1886, Three Sisters was 120.7 feet long, measured over the hull, exclusive of the extension over the stern, called the fantail, on which the sternwheel was mounted. The width or beam of the vessel was 30.2 feet, exclusive of the guards, and the depth of hold was 4.4 feet. Overall size of the vessel was 320.79 gross and 292.29 registered tons. The draft while “light” (without cargo) was just 13 inches. Cargo capacity of the Three Sisters was about 180 tons of sacked wheat. Three Sisters was equipped with two horizontally mounted steam engines, each with a bore of 12 inches and a stroke of 4 feet. These engines of Three Sisters generated 144 nominal horsepower. Fuel consumption was about one-twelfth of a cord of wood for every mile run. The official merchant vessel registry number was 145,423. Three Sisters was equipped with a steam-powered capstan built by Providence Steam Windlass Company. Operations Advertisement for excursions to Yaquina Bay, carried in part by Three Sisters, July 20, 1887 Three Sisters began running on the upper Willamette River under Capt. J.L Smith. Capt. William Penn Short (1852-1938) was later placed in command for three years, and was succeeded by James D. Miller. In 1895 Capt. Robert Young was master, and Thomas J. Hardy (1840-1930) had been engineer for several years. Three Sisters was part of a three-boat fleet belonging to the Oregon Pacific. The other steamers were the Wm. M. Hoag, 454.44 gross tons, built in Portland in 1887, and N.S. Bentley, 431.42 gross tons, built in Portland in 1886. In August 1886 Three Sisters was engaged in transporting railroad construction material for the Oregon Pacific Railroad. Low water in the upper Willamette River forced the N.S. Bentley off the route, and its place was taken by Three Sisters, running on a schedule of departing Albany, Oregon on Mondays and Thursdays at 1:00 p.m. for Portland. Three Sisters would then depart Portland for Albany on Wednesdays and Saturdays at 7:00 a.m., arriving in Albany on Thursdays and Saturdays at 12 noon. In July 1887, the Oregon Pacific Railroad was advertising excursions, on a route including the steamboat Three Sisters, to Yaquina Bay, then undergoing development as a resort area. Three Sisters would depart every Wednesday at 7:00 a.m. from the Morrison Street wharf, for Albany and intermediate points. Round-trip tickets, good until September 20, 1887, cost $6, and included meals on the steamer. E. Oldendorff & Co. was the ticketing agent. In March 1888, Three Sisters participated in an attempt to raise the sunken steamer N.S. Bentley. Reconstruction In 1888, the hull of Three Sisters was lengthened by 20 feet. After the reconstruction, the measurements for the vessel following the reconstruction were length of 140.7 feet (exclusive of fantail), beam of 30.2, and depth of hold of 4.4 feet. The boat was hauled out at a shipyard in Portland on July 28, 1888. Captain W. P. Short expected the work to be complete in three weeks. Post reconstruction, the gross tonnage (a measure of volume, not weight) was 358.33 and register tonnage was 327.33. The plan was to cut the hull in two and insert a twenty-foot long section. The work was done at the Willamette Shipbuilding Company, in East Portland. Upon reconstruction, the draft was expected to be 14 inches, about 6 inches less than before the rebuild, although whether this was in a loaded or light condition is not clear. W.P. Short stated that the steamer would have the lightest draft of any boat on the river, and he thought the vessel could operate year-round on the Willamette. According to one report, there was to be no alteration of the boiler, engines, and machinery. However, according to another report, a new steel stern-wheel shaft was being brought in from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and a new stern-wheel was being made. In 1889, the steamer was reported to be able carry 140 tons of freight when loaded. Another report stated that after the reconstruction, the steamer could carry 125 to 200 tons of freight. In 1888, the rebuilt Three Sisters was reported to draw only 13 inches of water, presumably this was while unloaded. Three Sisters was reported to have been the vessel with the least draft of any boat running on the Willamette in 1889, and was especially well suited to carrying on trade during the summer months, when water in the river was generally at its lowest. On January 18, 1889, the ownership of the steamers Three Sisters and N.S. Bentley was transferred from the Oregon Development Company to the Oregon Pacific Railroad Company, at a total valuation of $33,265.42. On August 13, 1899, the steamer somehow smashed into a free bathhouse in Portland, doing damage of $400 to the bathhouse. Stranded in flood Oregon City during the 1890 flood. In early February, 1890, Three Sisters was stranded just upriver from Oregon City. On Wednesday, February 5, 1890, the river measured three feet higher than the great flood of 1862. The breakwater at the boat basin just above Willamette Falls was washed away. To save Three Sisters, which was at Oregon City at the time, up river from the falls, it was necessary to pull the vessel into the bank as closely as possible. The next day, Thursday, February 6, the water level feet off sharply, by three feet, leaving the steamer stranded out of the water on the road between Oregon City and Canemah, Oregon. During the flood of 1890, the water level of the Willamette rose to 51.3 feet below the falls at Oregon City.. Three Sisters, under Captain W.P. Short, had left Corvallis, where it was raining fast, with orders to stop at Wheatland, a small town downriver from Salem, and load the last shipment of wheat, 2500 sacks, for Oregon City. When the boat reached Canemah, a little upriver from Oregon City, Captain Short tied the vessel up and went himself into Oregon City, where he wired the company’s manager, F.W. Bowen, in Corvallis, saying that he could take Three Sisters into the boat basin but he doubted whether he could get the steamer out. Bowen’s response to Short was: \\"Get that load of wheat into the basin. If you cannot get out, lay there until the water falls. The water rose 8 feet in the first night after the steamer was brought into the boat basin. All sorts of debris were being washed downriver, including buildings, warehouses, big trees, and even a sawmill. Short was familiar with the banks around the boat basin, and he feared the flood erode them and cause boulders to fall down upon the steamer. Short, with mate Albert Sass (d.1935) and engineer Thomas J. Hardy took steps to save the steamer. They lashed the boat up to the shore outside of the boat basin, on the east side of the river, where a road, submerged by then, ran between Oregon City and Canemah. Short pumped water ballast into the hull so the vessel would settle evening once the waters receded. The crew kept 120 pounds of steam pressure in the boiler, just in case the nine lines running to shore, and attached to railroad tracks, trees, and rocks, proved insufficient to hold the steamer. If that occurred, their only option would have been to go over the falls. The boat was also in danger during this time from floating rafts of sawlogs which came a foot from the hull. After about a week, the waters receded, and Three Sisters came to rest on the road, completely out of the water. Captain Bert Hatch, on the steamer Wm. M. Hoag, with Capt. George Raabe in command, brought up some house moving equipment from Salem, and with jacks and blocking tackle, Three Sisters was raised two or three feet. Blocking was put under the boat, and the vessel was left there to await refloating efforts. Three Sisters was still out of the water on February 21, 1890, when bids were being taken to launch the vessel back into the river. The contract to relaunch the steamer was secured by H.L. “Bert” Hatch, of Salem, Oregon. The plan, as of March 8, 1890, was to raise the steamer about three feet up from the ground on blocks until the boat basin at Oregon City, which was damaged in the flood, could be repaired, then launch the vessel into the basin. Three Sisters was out of the water for over three months. When the repairs to the boat basin were finally complete, the Oregon Pacific Railroad sent ship carpenters to the site from Yaquina Bay, with large timbers to construct a boat way under the steamer. The vessel was finally relaunched on July 6, and was then taken upriver to Corvallis. Operations 1890-1896 Steamers Three Sisters (front) and Wm. M. Hoag (rear), at Corvallis, Oregon, circa 1892. In January 1892, the assets of the Oregon Pacific railway, including the steamer Three Sisters, were sold to satisfy the claims of the company’s bondholders. In 1892 and 1893, the Oregon Pacific Railroad had fallen behind in paying the crew of its steamboats, including those of Three Sisters and Wm. M. Hoag. In April 1895, fourteen crew members filed suit in the U.S.District Court seeking to impose a maritime lien, called a libel on Three Sisters, for unpaid wages in 1892 and 1893 totaling $754.86. River traffic was heavy in early 1893. On a round trip in May 1893 Three Sisters handled 131 passengers and 200 tons of freight. To reach Harrisburg and Eugene, Oregon in the during the low water of the summer of 1893, the upper cabins of Three Sisters were stripped from the vessel, thus decreasing the draft of the vessel by three inches. The steamer reached Harrisburg on August 14, 1893, carrying 16 tons of freight from Corvallis. This was considered a feat of navigation in the low water season. Three Sisters was expected to take 60 to 75 tons of freight, consisting mainly of sacks of wheat, downriver from Harrisburg. As of July 1893 Three Sisters was insured for $13,000. In March 1896, when the government snagboat Corvallis had sunk in the Willamette River, at the mouth of Meeks Slough, Three Sisters was hired to attempt to drag the Corvallis to a position where the snagboat could be raised. Dismantled In April 1896, it was reported that “the jig is up with the old steamer Three Sisters.” During a recent high water period on the Willamette, Three Sisters had been hauled out on the riverbank downstream from Corvallis, and as of April 21, 1896, the plan was to dismantle the steamer. The hull was reported to have become so decayed and leaky that the owners decided that the steamer would no longer be of use. By May 4, 1896, the work of dismantling the steamer was nearly complete. The lighter machinery had been removed and stored in an old warehouse near the O.C.& E depot at Corvallis. The boiler, the stern-wheel shaft, and other heavy pieces were left where they had been removed, and it was planned to build a temporary structure over them.

She was also the mother of the grand couturier Christian Dior and the French Resistance member Catherine Dior.  Biography  Madeleine Martin was the daughter of a lawyer from Angers and Juliette Surosne, originally from the department of Calvados, France. Monsieur Martin died young and Madeleine was brought up by her mother. In 1898, at the age of nineteen, she married Maurice Dior who was twenty six years old. The couple moved to the center of Granville in the department of Manche, where Maurice Dior had grown up. They had five children: Raymond in 1899, Christian in 1905, Jacqueline in 1909, Bernard in 1910, and Ginette, known as Catherine, in 1917. In 1905, to satisfy Madeleine, who did not like the house in the center of town, the Dior family purchased a property that was still in Granville but on the edge of a cliff, facing the sea. This windswept villa was called Les Rhumbs, named after the thirty-two divisions of the wind rose. It had a large piece of adjoining land which Madeleine Dior transformed into a southern-style garden, overcoming the hostility of the winds blowing in from the sea to grow delicate plants. In 1910, taking advantage of the revenue from Maurice Dior's company which was enjoying great success, the family moved to Rue Richard Wagner in Paris, since renamed Rue Albéric Magnard. Madeleine Dior excelled as the lady of the house and a woman of taste, decorating the apartment in the Louis XVI-Passy style fashionable at the time. She surpassed herself when holding dinners served by butlers in white gloves, and her bouquets were much admired by her guests. In 1914, the family decided to take refuge from the war and returned to live in the Granville villa, which had been their holiday home since 1910. Like all society ladies in the region, Madeleine Dior participated in the war effort. In his autobiography, Christian Dior remembers this period when women were occupied \\"with making shredded cloth bandages, hospitals, letters from the front and recreation sessions for the injured.\\" The family returned to live in Paris in 1918, not far from the apartment where they had lived before the war. In 1930, Bernard, the second youngest of the family, was affected by a serious nervous disorder. Madeleine Dior, doubtless worn down by what was happening to her son, died the following year. Jacques Bonjean, a gallery owner and friend of Christian Dior, described her as an \\"...elegant and slender woman, sometimes distant, always graceful.\\"  The Les Rhumbs garden in Granville  Throughout her life, Madeleine Dior lived out her passion for flowers through the transformation of the windswept land surrounding her villa in Granville into a beautiful English-style garden. First she had a veranda added to the façade of the house, which sheltered a winter garden, and planted a small wood of umbrella pines to protect her plants from the wind. This was a bold choice of tree for the Normandy coast. She also had windbreak walls put up to protect the property, and finally she had a greenhouse built where the plants were overwintered. On the advice of Christian Dior, the greenhouse was replaced in 1925 by a pergola and pool; a rose garden was planted nearby a short while later. The creation of the garden became a two-person job, which created a bond between Madeleine Dior and her son: the latter organized it by positioning the features, while she took care of the planting. The result was a complex planting scheme that sheltered the most fragile flowers from the wind: \\"Madeleine Dior's planting formed curtains of shielding greenery, so that the second was more precious and the third consisted of plants that it would have been impossible to grow here: geraniums, roses, jasmine... All these protective screens created layers, structures and motif effects,\\" explains the garden's current landscape gardener. James de Coquet, journalist for Le Figaro, remembered being amazed by his visit to Les Rhumbs in 1929: \\"I complimented Madame Dior on her beautiful garden. I told her she must have an excellent gardener.\\"Talk by James de Coquet during his visit to Granville in 1976, Musée Christian Dior archives, Granville. In 1997, the villa, which had been purchased by the town of Granville in 1932, became the Musée Christian Dior. The garden, Madeleine Dior's life work, is one of the few \\"artistic gardens\\" of the early 20th century to have been preserved. For student landscape gardners, it is also an exceptional subject of study.  Influence on the work of Christian Dior  Madeleine Dior was particularly close to her son Christian, the future couturier: in the eyes of her other children, he was her \\"favorite\\" and he followed her everywhere, from her Granville garden to Orêve, her favorite Parisian florist, and the dressmaker Rosine Perrault. Madeleine Dior was a close follower of fashion, as demonstrated by a Roaring Twenties dress that she designed, which is exhibited in the Granville museum. The couturier remembered his mother when, years after her death, on the eve of his first runway show, he was looking at the façade of the House that bore his name on Avenue Montaigne and exclaimed: \\"If Mother had lived, I would never have dared.\\" In the same way that we sense the presence of Charles Baudelaire's mother, Caroline, in his work and the influence of Jeanne, Marcel Proust's mother, in his, Madame Dior had a profound effect on her son's entire career. Regarding the Granville house, Christian Dior wrote: \\"I have the tenderest, most magical memories of it. Not only that; my life, my style, owe nearly everything to its location and architecture,\\" and \\"...(it) was pebbledashed in a very soft pink, blended with gray gravel, and these two colors have remained my favorite shades in couture.\\" But it was above all his mother's garden that made a deep impression on the couturier. Having spent his childhood learning the names of flowers and their descriptions from horticulture catalogs, Christian Dior drew inspiration from them to create the silhouettes that would lead to his success in 1947 with the Corolle line. The decor of the Diors' apartment in La Muette, Paris, was also imprinted on the couturier's imagination: reference is made to it in the Louis XVI style which inspired the interiors of the Dior boutiques. Finally, it was Madeleine Dior's look that the couturier remembered when he invented the famous New Look with its nipped in waist, pronounced hips and emphasized bust recalling the feminine silhouettes of the Belle Époque. Long after the couturier's death, the House of Dior continues to pay tribute to this muse, as in the Fall-Winter 2005 runway show, where a Belle Époque-inspired dress was named \\"Madeleine\\".

Foundation It was announced by Bill Gates at COP21 on 30 November 2015, on stage with President Obama, President Hollande and Prime Minister Modi. At the launch, 24 countries committed to double their respective clean energy research and development over the five years to 2020. For the US Department of Energy, this translates into an additional $4 billion by the end of 2020. The countries include the five most populous (as at 2015): China, India, the United States, Indonesia, and Brazil. All 20 launch partner countries represent 75 percent of the world's CO2 emissions from electricity, and over 80 percent of the world's clean energy R&D; investment. Its link to private sector investment is via the Breakthrough Energy Coalition group of private investors, also spearheaded by Bill Gates and which formed in parallel at COP21. Criticism Several of Mission Innovation's aims are compatible with those of Global Apollo Programme, announced earlier in 2015. What Mission Innovation's lacks in comparison, at least at launch, is a clear, dated, target; and a committee to co-ordinate research efforts across the globe and to identify successful opportunities. Technology focus The initiative is open in its focus and will, according to Gates, \\"pursue literally dozens and dozens of paths\\". Several example technologies were mentioned at the launch of the initiative: biofuel, carbon capture and storage, airborne wind turbines, nuclear fission and nuclear fusion.

Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, the temple is located in the Tirupattur - Karaikudi Road, around from Karaikudi. There are three caves located on the western side of the lower rock, that has rock-cut shrines from the Pandyan Empire from the 8th century. The caves have the earliest sculptural representation of Dvarapalas, the guardian deities, for any South Indian temple. The temple has a five-tiered gateway tower, the gopuram in the hill, leading to a pillared hall and the sanctum. The temple is open from 6:00 am – 11:00 am and 4 - 8:00 pm. Four daily rituals and many yearly festivals are held at the temple, of which Panguni Uthiram festival celebrated during the Tamil month of Panguni (March - April) and Thaipoosam during Thai (January - February) being the most prominent. The temple is maintained and administered by the Kunnakudi Thiruvannamalai Mutt Adikam, while the rock-cut caves are maintained as a protected monument by the Archaeological Survey of India. Legend The place was originally called Kundrakudi as it was located in a hill (Kundram means hill in Tamil), which with the period of time became Kunnakudi. It is also called by other names like Mayuragiri, Mayilmalai, Arasavaram and Krishanagaram as the hill resembles the shape of a peacock. As per Hindu legend, sage Agasthya is believed to have worshipped Murugan at this place. As per another legend, Sooran, the demon king infuriated peacock, the sacred vehicle of Murugan. He told the bird that Garuda, the sacred vehicle of Vishnu and Swan, the sacred vehicle of Saraswati could travel faster than it. The peacock swallowed Garuda and the swan in anger. Vishnu prayed to Muruga to retrieve his vehicle back from the peacock, who readily acceded to the request. The peacock, realising its mistake, prayed Muruga by doing penance at this place. Architecture Festival image of the deity depicted with six heads The temple is located in Kundrakudi, in the outskirts of Karaikudi in Sivaganga district in Tamil Nadu on the road from Tirupattur to Karaikudi. The hill has a height of and occupies an area of . The temple has a five tiered rajagopuram, the gateway tower raising to a height of , which pierces the granite wall surrounding the temple. The sanctum faces East and the image of the presiding deity Murugan is sported with the images of his consort Valli and Deivasana, each of whom are seen sitting on a peacock. There are shrines of other deities around the sanctum in the precinct. There are three caves in the western side of the lower hill, with rock-cut images dedicated to Shiva in each of them. The first two caves have intricate rock-cut sculptures and Dvarapalas on either side of the sanctum, while the third one is plain. There are various sculpted images of Vishnu, Durga, Lingodbhava, Harihara. The image of Dvarapalas in the caves, on either sides of the sanctum, with each leaning in the direction facing the sanctum, are found to be the earliest representation of the images. These are not found in Pallava architecture, which precedes the Pandyas. The caves are considered one of the major specimens of rock-cut architecture of the Pandyas, counted along with Vettuvan Koil, Thirumalaipuram and Thiruparankundram. Culture View of the temple from downstairs The temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. The temple rituals are performed four times a day: Kalasandhi at 6:00 a.m., Uchikala poojai at 11:00 a.m., Sayarakshai at 6:00 p.m., and Arthajama Pooja at 7:45 p.m. Each ritual has three steps: alangaram (decoration), neivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for the presiding deities. There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple. The temple is open from 6:30 am – 12:00 pm and 5 - 8:30 pm on all days except during festive occasions when it has extended timings. The major festivals of the temple include the Panguni Uthiram festival celebrated during the Tamil month of Panguni (March - April) and Thaipoosam during Thai (January - February). The other festivals include Kantha Sashti, Vaikasi Visagam, Aavani Moolam and Paal Perukku Vizha. Like other Murugan temples during the festivals, hundreds of devotees carry pots of milk and Kavadi around the streets of the temple.

History  The Hotel obtained a liquor licence on 13 March 1851. The original proprietor was Robert Radford. The Hotel was named after Mr Radford's home town of Exeter in England. Radford had moved to Adelaide from Tasmania in 1850. A Mr Glover opposed the application for a licence (it appears Mr Glover was another publican), but the licence was granted in any event. The Hotel originally provided, apart from food and drink, lodgings for travellers, and a stables. The Supreme Court of South Australia case of Wayland v Taylor concerns a dispute between a contractor and a sub-contractor for building work done in relation to the Hotel in 1851. On 19 May 1851 a meeting of residents of the north-east corner of Adelaide took place at the Hotel, to consider proposals for a road from the city through the Parklands to Kensington and Norwood. In July 1851, a number of concerts were given at the Hotel by a group known as the 'Ohio Serenaders'. Thus began a long history of the Hotel hosting a wide range of musicians. On 1 September 1851 Rebecca Cludans, a little girl, was convicted for obtaining gin from Laura Radford, who worked at the Hotel, by pretending she was acquiring it on an errand for an adult. This was not the only crime that occurred at the Hotel at this time. Also in September 1851, a forger and lunatic, Henry Baker, was found drinking at the Hotel by a policeman, and subsequently arrested. On 14 December in the same year, the publican Mr Radford accepted a watch from an August von Nontzen, a \\"burly German\\", who was leaving the colony, as payment for his debts to Mr Radford. It transpired von Nontzen had stolen the watch from a young lady, Jean Morton. On 7 May 1852, a grand ball was given at the Hotel to celebrate the safe return to Adelaide of the ship, the 'Escort'. It appears at around this time, Radford abandoned the Hotel to dig for gold in Victoria. However, the Hotel continued operation in his name in his absence, with the liquor licence being renewed on 22 May 1852, despite a late application having been made. It was submitted by Mr Radford to the licensing court that the Hotel had been \\"always well-conducted\\". In December 1852, an employee of the Hotel, Mary Conolly, was caught stealing several bottles from the Hotel, as well as a lodger's purse. Perhaps this had an effect on Radford, for on 13 December 1852, Radford gave up the licence to the Exeter Hotel to a James Clark. In January 1853, Clark had already got into trouble at his new establishment. A Matthew Wilks accused him of assault. Wilks claimed he had merely complained his pint was not up to the measure, and this provoked Clark to strike him. However, a witness told a different story - Clark had refused Wilks entry on the grounds he was a man of bad character, and that Wilks had then claimed to be owed money by Clark for some vegetables he had sold him, and refused to go away until he was paid. Clark tried to remove Wilks from the Hotel, and Wilks struck out at Clark, who then retaliated. The Court decided that, either way, Clark had assaulted Wilks, and fined him 10 shillings and costs. On 12 June 1854, the licence was transferred by Clark to Rawson Ewart. Ewart had only been ten months in the Colony, and had previously worked as a draper. Ewart encountered trouble before long. On 2 December 1854, a William Stevens was found in Mount Gambier and arrested for obtaining money under false pretences from Mr Ewart. In April 1855, there was a robbery of valuables of a lodger perpetrated by a Charles Walker. On 28 October 1855, there was a small fire at the Hotel, but no-one was harmed. The establishment appears to have been well-regarded at the time, with respectable people meeting there, including a social breakfast of the Congregational Union on 17 April 1856. In 1888, the original building was demolished and the current building was built. It was thought this decision was made so the Hotel could better compete with the rival Tavistock Hotel, which inhabited a grand building (which building was ultimately demolished to construct Frome Street). In 1929, the building was substantially refurbished to appear largely as it does today, with its distinctive green-tile facade. In 2001, the Hotel received listing as a local heritage place by the City of Adelaide.

The Faber Book of French Cinema. London: Faber & Faber, 2011. p.44. It was formed by a group of White Russian exiles who had been forced to flee following the 1917 Russian Revolution and subsequent Russian Civil War. Initially the firm's personnel consisted mainly of Russian exiles, but over time French actors and directors were employed by the company. Its operations continued until the late 1930s. History Faced with increasingly difficult working conditions in Russia after the revolution of 1917, the film producer Joseph Ermolieff decided to move his operations to Paris where he had connections with the Pathé company. Arriving in 1920 with a group of close associates, Ermolieff took over a studio in Montreuil-sous-Bois in the eastern suburbs of Paris and began making films through his company Ermolieff-Cinéma. His co-founder of the company was Alexandre Kamenka, another Russian exile, and when in 1922 Ermolieff moved to Germany, Kamenka, together with his colleagues Noë Bloch and Maurice Hache, took over the company and re- established it as the Société des Films Albatros. He also set up a distribution company called Les Films Armor in order to control the distribution of his own films.Richard Abel, French Cinema: the First Wave, 1915-1929. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1984. p. 45. Various explanations have been given for the choice of the name Albatros: the name of a boat which brought some of the émigrés from Russia; a symbol of White Russia; an incident with an albatros on the journey. As well as adopting the image of the albatros as its symbol, the company took the motto \\"Debout dans la tempête\\" (\\"upright in the storm\\").\\"Le cinéma russe en exil: l'aventure des Films Albatros\\": online exhibition at Cinémathèque française (2009). [Retrieved 26 December 2015. In French.] Among the group of Russian artists who stayed to work with Albatros were the directors Victor Tourjansky and Alexandre Volkoff, the art director Alexandre Lochakoff, the costume designer Boris Bilinsky, and the actors Ivan Mosjoukine, Nathalie Lissenko, Nicolas Koline, and Nicolas Rimsky.The French Cinema Book, edited by Michael Temple and Michael Witt. London: British Film Institute, 2004. p. 31. Although this Russian company initially favoured Russian themes, Kamenka quickly realised the need for greater integration with French film production, and they turned increasingly to French subjects. In 1924 a number of Kamenka's Russian associates left Albatros, and Kamenka offered opportunities to several innovative French film-makers including Jean Epstein, Jacques Feyder, Marcel L'Herbier and René Clair. Kamenka's production policy combined prestige projects with openly commercial films,Dictionnaire du cinéma français, sous la direction de Jean-Loup Passek. Paris: Larousse, 1987. p. 253. and his consistent record made him the most successful French producer during the 1920s, according to Charles Spaak, who came to the company as a script-writer in 1928.Richard Abel, French Cinema: the First Wave, 1915-1929. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1984. p. 24. Kamenka successfully achieved international distribution for many of his films (even in Soviet Russia with which his company had so little political sympathyClaude Beylie, Une histoire du cinéma français. Paris: Larousse, 2005. p. 96.) and from 1927 he entered into co-production arrangements with production companies in other European countries, driven by growing financial difficulties in the French film industry. The arrival of sound pictures posed a serious difficulty for Albatros which had hitherto relied considerably upon Russian actors, especially Mosjoukine whose accent precluded a successful transition into the talking era. The company's output diminished in the 1930s, but it achieved one further artistic success of note when Jean Renoir joined them for his 1936 adaptation of Gorki's Les Bas-fonds.

The meeting was originally scheduled for 26–27 June 2020 preceded by various fora between the 22nd and 25th of June, but has been postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A new date has not been announced. The summit is scheduled to be held in Rwanda. The meeting was originally expected to be held in Malaysia but the decision of former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak not to attend CHOGM 2018 due to political uncertainty at home meant that he was unable to formally propose Malaysia as host. It was announced that Commonwealth leaders had accepted Rwanda's offer to host the meeting instead of Fiji which had also made an offer. It will be the first Commonwealth Summit held in a country that is not a former British colony or dominion or the United Kingdom itself. The position of Commonwealth Chair-in-Office, held by the government leader of the CHOGM host country, will be transferred at the summit from the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom to the President of Rwanda, who will hold the post until the 27th CHOGM to be held in Samoa and which was initially scheduled for 2022. The theme for the meeting is ‘Delivering A Common Future: Connecting, Innovating, Transforming’. Five sub- themes have been identified for discussion: Governance and Rule of Law, ICT & Innovation, Youth, Environment and Trade. Leaders are expected to discuss ways the contemporary Commonwealth can transform societies, in accordance with Commonwealth Charter values of democracy, multilateralism, sustainable development, and empowerment of women and youth. There is expected to be an attempt by the United Kingdom to deny Patricia Scotland a second term as Commonwealth Secretary-General. The UK is expected to nominate Kenyan diplomat Amina Mohamed for the position, instead. On 21 April 2020 it was announced by Rwandan president Paul Kagame and Patricia Scotland that CHOGM 2020 has been postponed until at least 2021 as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. The rescheduled event is still to be held in Kigali.

The parish was founded in 1860 to serve the city's large French-Canadian and French-American communities. On July 1, 2008, St. Andres was merged into the newly formed Good Shepherd Parish. The parish complex of four buildings, including the church, rectory, convent, and school, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015, at which time most of it stood vacant. Description and history The buildings of St. Andre's are located near the junction of Bacon and Sullivan Streets, south of Biddeford's central business district. The parish property extends along most of a city block bounded by Bacon, Sullivan, and High Streets, ending short of properties that front on Water Street. The church, a Romanesque Revival brick structure completed in 1910 to a design by the Boston firm of Chickering & O'Connell, stands at the corner of Bacon and High, with the rectory to its left, at the corner of Bacon and Sullivan. The rectory is a fine example of Second Empire architecture, although it is an extremely late example of this style, having been built in 1900. Arrayed on Sullivan Street behind the rectory are the Colonial Revival convent (built 1916 and enlarged in 1930), and the former school (built in the 1920s), with a large parking area occupying much of the remainder of the property.Beard, Christine (2015). NRHP nomination for St. Andre's Parish; available by request from the Maine Historic Preservation Commission St. Andre's was founded as Biddeford's third Catholic church, after St. Mary's and St. Joseph's. St. Mary's was founded in 1855 to support a large immigrant Irish community, and St. Joseph's was established in 1860 to support the growing French-Canadian immigrant population. The latter population continued to grow, and had by the 1890s outgrown its facilities. St. Andre's was founded in 1899, and was located in the heart of what was then a French Canadian neighborhood, with Rev. Louis Bergeron as its priest. The basement of the church was built in 1900, and services were held there until the church building was completed in 1910. The school operated until the early 1990s, and was converted into housing in 1998. The church continued to serve the Good Shepherd Parish community until it was formally closed with a final mass on New Year's Eve, 2010.

History Sooklek was first popularized as the titular role in the cartoon series Prince Chantarakob (จันทโครพ) and eventually became a public personality as creator Prayoon used the character in his satirical cartoons. His name means \\"happy, good fellow\\". When Field Marshall Thanom Kittikachorn gave out an order for Prayoon to stop his political cartoons in 1968, Sooklek was drawn with lips sewn together. Another warning from the government brought about change in Sooklek as the sewn lips were replaced by a big mustache. Sooklek regained his mouth with the ouster of Thanom in 1973.

It is often held as the final round of the French Rally Championship. It began in 1950. Famous participants include WRC champion, Sébastien Loeb (the 2000, 2009 and 2014 winner), the four-time Formula One champion Alain Prost, 1994 WRC champion Didier Auriol (the 1987 and 1988 winner), Freddy Loix, Craig Breen, Jari-Matti Latvala (the 2011 winner), Dany Snobeck (the 1982 and 2008 winner), 2010 24 Hours of Le Mans winner Romain Dumas, François Chatriot (the 1985, 1986 and 1989 winner), Renault F1 driver and 2008 Canadian Grand Prix winner Robert Kubica, and Julien Maurin (the 2013 winner). Jari-Matti Latvala was the first non- Frenchman and thus foreign driver to win the rally, and it was also his first win on asphalt. As well as part of the French Rally Championship, the Rallye du Var was part of the European Rally Championship calendar from 1984 to 2001. Recent years 2008 Dany Snobeck, who had last won the Rallye du Var 26 years before, took his second victory in the event and beat out much younger drivers, such as the 25-year-old, Jean-Sébastien Vigion who finished second. The World Rally Champion, Sébastien Loeb, returned for this event and was third. Both of Snobeck's previous challengers, Eric Brunson and Pieter Tsjoen had retired so Snobeck was sure to win from the get-go. 2009 Sébastien Loeb who recently won the 2009 World Rally Championship won here again in the title-winning Citroën C4 WRC, but this time co-driven by his wife, Séverine Loeb, for his regular co-driver Daniel Elena was driving a separate entry. The podium finishers were Stéphane Sarrazin and Patrick Henry. The Belgian Pieter Tsjoen, who crashed out of last year's rally, led for one stage in his Ford Focus RS WRC. 2016 In 2016, the 62nd running of this event, Hyundai WRC driver Kevin Abbring and co-driver Sebastian Marshall in a Hyundai i20 WRC won this event, and was the second driver who is not French to win Rallye du Var, after Latvala's victory in 2011. Second place went to Yoann Bonato. In third was Sylvain Michel. David Salanon, the winner of last year's rally, suffered bad luck when he had an accident on special stage 10, Pignans, whilst leading, and this allowed Dutchman Abbring to win. 2017 In 2017, Frenchman David Salanon won the event for the second time, this time partnered with Jérôme Degout, with Sylvain Michel and Yohan Rossel completing the podium. Sébastien Loeb returned to the event, driving his recently refurbished Formula 2 Peugeot 306 Maxi.

The Karakhan Manifesto was a statement of Soviet policy toward China dated 25 July 1919. It was issued by Lev Karakhan, deputy commissioner for foreign affairs for Soviet Russia. The manifesto offered to relinquish various rights Russia had obtained by treaty in China, including extraterritoriality, economic concessions, and Russia's share of the Boxer indemnity.Gao, James, Z., Historical Dictionary of Modern China (1800–1949). \\"Karakhan Manifesto\\". The Scarecrow Press, (2009). These and similar treaties had been denounced by Chinese nationalists as \\"unequal.\\" The manifesto created a favorable impression of Russia and Marxism among Chinese. It was often contrasted with the Treaty of Versailles (1919), which granted Shandong to Japan.M Sinha, \\"The Karakhan Manifesto,\\" China Report, November 1972 vol. 8 no. 6 53. The manifesto was prompted by the Bolshevik advance into Siberia, which created a need to establish a relationship with China.Whiting, Allen S., \\"The Soviet Offer to China of 1919\\", The Journal of Asian Studies, August 1951, pp. 355–364, The Bolsheviks saw the Chinese as one of \\"the oppressed peoples of the East\\" and therefore a potential ally against the imperialist powers. The manifesto is addressed to, \\"the Chinese people and the Governments of North and South China.\\" Because both Russia and China were in a state of civil war at this time, diplomatic exchanges were often delayed. Although the document was published in Moscow in August 1919, it was not formally presented to Chinese diplomats until February 1920. The version presented at this time includes the passage, \\"the Soviet Government returns to the Chinese people, without any compensation, the Chinese Eastern Railway.\\"Uldricks, Teddy J. \\"Karakhan Declaration.\\" Encyclopedia of Russian History. 2004. Encyclopedia.com. Six months later, Karakhan personally handed the Chinese a second version of the manifesto, one that did not include this remarkable offer. In fact, the Soviet authorities denied ever having made it. The railway offer had been included by \\"mistake,\\" they explained. The Soviets may have hoped the offer of the railway would generate an enthusiastic response in Beijing, leading to a Sino-Soviet alliance against Japan. The warlords in Beijing, closely tied to Japan, responded hesitantly. When the hoped-for alliance proved unattainable, the Russians withdrew their offer. In any event, traditional Russian interests and rights in China, including control of the Chinese Eastern Railway, were reaffirmed in a series of secret agreements made in 1924–1925.Elleman, Bruce, \\"The Soviet Union's Secret Diplomacy Concerning the Chinese Eastern Railway, 1924–1925,\\" The Journal of Asian Studies, May 1994, pp. 459–486, The manifesto came at a crucial time in the development of Chinese communism.

The presiding deity is revered in the 7th century Tamil Saiva canonical work, the Tevaram, written by Tamil saint poets known as the Nayanmars and classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam. The temple is closely associated with Sundarar, the saivite saint of the 8th century, who started composing his Tirumurai starting with \\"Pitha Piraisudi\\" verse in this temple. Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, the present structure of the temple is believed to have been built during the Cholas period in the 10th century. The temple has received gracious endowments from the Chola queen Sembiyan Mahadevi. Shiva is worshipped as Kripapureeswarar and his consort Parvathi as Mangalambigai. A granite wall surrounds the temple, enclosing all its shrines. The temple has a five-tiered rajagopuram, the gateway tower. The temple is open from 6am - 11 am and 4-8:00 pm on all days except during festival days when it is open the full day. Four daily rituals and many yearly festivals are held at the temple, of which the Aadi star day celebrated during the Tamil month of Aaadi (June - July) for Sundarar and Panguni Uthiram festival during Panguni (March - April) with a float festival being the most prominent. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Legend Image of the 100 pillared hall outside the main tower As per Hindu legend, the sages in Tharukavanam were very proud of their achievements and started doing a penance to destroy Shiva. Shiva absorbed all the evils from the penance and realising their mistake, the sages started their worship to Shiva. Shiva blessed them with their wishes and came to be known as Krupapureeswarar, the \\"God who would bestow wishes of the devotees\\". As per another legend, Sundarar, the famous Saivite saint and Nayanmar, was stopped by an old man from marrying at Thirukovilur. He showed a document indicating Sundarar was indebted to the old man for serving him for a lifetime. Sundarar called him Pitha, a lunatic. The village elders after analysing the document, asked Sundarar to follow the old man. Sundarar followed the old mand and served him in his household. It was later revealed to him that Shiva appeared as the old man to test his servitude. Sundarar felt guilty of accusing Shiva, but Shiva revealed to him in a divine voice that he enjoyed the verse and requested him to sing verses starting with \\"Pitha\\". Sundarar started singing his Tirumurai with \\"Pitha Piraisudi\\" verse in this temple and later would go on to become one of the four most venerated saints of Saiva literature. Architecture The exact year of building could not be ascertained from the inscriptions, but the inscriptions found in the Visalur temple indicate benevolent gifts to the temple from Raja Raja Chola I (984-1015 CE) and his successors. Based on the inscriptions, researchers point out that the temple had gardens, which were supposed to have both floral plants and fruit bearing trees. The temple has received gracious endowments from the Chola queen Sembiyan Mahadevi and is believed to have established various sculptures. Kripapureeswar temple is located in Thiruvennainallur, a village located from Villupuram on the Panruti- Thirukovilur road. The temple has a seven-tiered rajagopuram, the gateway tower that pierces the rectangular wall that houses all the shrines. The sanctum houses the image of Kripapureeswarar in the form of Lingam, an iconic form of Shiva. There is an Ardha Mandap and a Mukha mandap, pillared halls leading to the sanctum. The first precinct has the images of Vinayakar, Murugan, Durga, Dakshinamurthy and Chandikeswara. The hall where the case was fought between the old man and Sundarar is believed to be the Panchyat Mandap located on the right side of the entrance. Culture The shrine of Amman located parallel to the Shiva shrine The temple follows Saivite tradition. The temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. The temple rituals are performed four times a day: Kalasanthi at 6:00 a.m., Uchikalam at 11:00 a.m., Sayarakshai at 5:00 p.m., and Sayarakshai between 7:45 \\\\- 8:00 p.m. Each ritual has three steps: alangaram (decoration), neivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for both Kripapureeswarar and Mangalambigai. There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple. The temple is open from 6am - 12 pm and 4-8:30 pm. Aadi star day celebrated during the Tamil month of Aaadi (June - July) as Sundarar's birthday and Panguni Uthiram festival during Panguni (March - April) with a float festival being the most prominent festivals. There are other common festivals like Shivaratri, Vinayaga Chaturthi, Vijayadasami and Karthigai Deepam celebrated in the temple. Sundarar, an 8th-century Tamil Saivite poet, venerated Kripapureeswarar in ten verses in Tevaram, compiled as the Seventh Tirumurai. As the temple is revered in Tevaram, it is classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam, one of the 275 temples that find mention in the Saiva canon. Appar is believed to have visited the temple during the series of visits from Thingalur to Thirukovilur and Pennadam. In modern times, the temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. See also * Marundeeswarar Temple, T.

This document certifies that the person holding is a seaman as per the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watch keeping for Seafarers (STCW), 1978, as amended from time to time. Seaman Book is one of the compulsory document for applying crew transit visas. The record of employment on board of a merchant ship (sea service) is recorded in a Seaman Service Book. Different countries issue to their seafarers the similar service book with different names i.e. Seaman Record Book, Seaman Discharge Book etc. In Pakistan Government Shipping Office issue this book under section 120 of Merchant Shipping Ordinance, 2001. It is mandatory for all seafarers serving on board ship, whether they are on the Minimum Safe Manning Certificate or not, to hold a \\"Seaman Service Book and Seaman Identity Document\\" (SID). Affairs of seamen in Pakistan The Government Shipping Office looks after the affairs of seafarers under the Merchant Shipping Policy of Pakistan which covers the following subject of merchant navy of Pakistan: * Registration and facilitation of Pakistani Seamen * Issue of Seaman Service Book (SSB) and issue of Seafarers’ Identity Document (SID) * Engagement of Seamen on Ships and Discharge of seamen from ships (Sign-on and Sign-off) * Maintains record of service of seamen Issuance of SSB Pakistan's merchant marine policy for jobs on vessel set in 2001, speaks as follows: To obtain employment on board a seagoing vessel every citizen of Pakistan is entitled to acquire a Seaman Service Book (SSB) in accordance with the provision of Merchant Shipping Ordinance 2001 subject to fulfilling the requirements as prescribed under the Rules issued from time to time, by the Government of Pakistan. No seaman can be engaged at any port of Pakistan, except service on coasting ships, unless the seafarer is bonafide holder of the SSB. In case of foreign crew/merchant navy officers he must in possession of equivalent document e.g. equivalent discharge book issued by his own country. This is a prescribed certificate of identification with basic particulars and qualifications of the seaman duly registered with the Government Shipping Office. It is issued on Government sanctioned Form No. 20 by the Shipping Master under the provisions of Sections 120-138 of Merchant Shipping Ordinance, 2001. It is issued under a standard operative procedure (SOP), generally SSB contains the minimum information as given below: *(1) Name of seafarer, *(2) Identification Mark *(3) Nationality and Sex *(4) SSB No and Computerized National Identity Card *(5) Date of Birth and Place of Birth *(6) Date of Issue SID No. *(7) Date of Expiry *(8) Signature of issuing authority (Shipping Master) Other pages of SSB contain columns for Seaman engagement and discharge record, promotion/advancement, company listing, summary of previous voyages, visa endorsement, official entries by the concerned issuing office etc. SSB is issued from National Database Registration Authority (NADRA) after following prescribed procedure and deposit of fee. The (SSB) is also liable to be cancelled, suspended or confiscated if a seaman is found to be involved in contravention of any local law.http://shippingoffice.gov.pk/Annexure%20A.html retrieved 30-11-2015 In Pakistan one of the sources of getting SSB in the category of ship's ratings/crew is conduct of courses from private sector institutions which are commonly known as GP or GP-III courses. SSB holders in the country Prior to 1990 Pakistan government was practicing the policy for issuance of CDC (now SSB) only to a certain number per year in order to ensure the availability of job to each and every seamen holding CDC under roster system. Earlier, there was just one government-owned institute, namely Pakistan Marine Academy, however, after promulgation of Merchant Shipping Ordinance (2001) institutes in private sector have allowed to offer training to seamen for issuance of SSB according to their qualification and out of 10 approved institutes, five are actively conducting their business of training and education in accordance with STCW Convention. This has increased number of SSB holders in Pakistan in access of demand. About 40% of Pakistani seafarers are jobless for a long time. However, Government Shipping Office discloses that there are about 8,000 officers and 10,500 ratings duly registered as seamen. Out of this total number of registered seamen about 30% are employed on national as well as foreign ships. The employment on foreign ships is about 85% of the total seamen engaged in this field.

General The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union article 169 enables the EU to follow the ordinary legislative procedure to protect consumers \\"health, safety and economic interests\\" and promote rights to \\"information, education and to organise themselves in order to safeguard their interests\\".TFEU art 169 All member states may grant higher protection, and a \\"high level of consumer protection\\" is regarded as a fundamental right.TFEU art 169(3) and the CFREU art 38 . Consumers are entitled to a legislative \\"charter of rights\\" to safe and healthy products, fair terms, proper information free from misleading advertising and marketing, and rights of cancellation. Beyond these general principles, and outside specific sectors, there are four main Directives: the Product Liability Directive 1985, Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Directive 1993, Unfair Commercial Practices Directive 2005 and the Consumer Rights Directive 2011, requiring information and cancellation rights for consumers. As a whole, the law is designed to ensure that consumers in the EU are entitled to the same minimum rights wherever they make their transactional decisions, and largely follows inspiration from theories of consumer protection developed in California and the Consumer Bill of Rights proclaimed by John F. Kennedy in May 1962. The European Court of Justice has continually affirmed the importance of ensuring more consumer rights than in commercial contracts, both because of information asymmetry, and inequality of bargaining power.See Banco Español de Crédito SA v Camino (2012) Case C-618/10, [39] and Océano Grupo Editorial and Salvat Editores (2000) C-240/98 to C-244/98 and [2000] ECR I-4941, [25] unequal bargaining power, consumers are entitled to a legislative \\"charter of rights\\" to safe and healthy products, fair terms, proper information free from misleading advertising and marketing, and rights of cancellation. The Product Liability Directive 1985 was the first consumer protection measure. It creates strict enterprise liability for all producers and retailers for any harm to consumers from products, as a way to promote basic standards of health and safety.Product Liability Directive 1985 85/374/EEC, recital 1 and 6 Any producer, or supplier if the ultimate producer is insolvent, of a product is strictly liable to compensate a consumer for any damage caused by a defective product.PLD 1985 arts 1 and 3 A \\"defect\\" is anything which falls below what a consumer is entitled to expect, and this essentially means that products should be safe for their purpose. A narrow defensive is available if a producer can show that a defect could not be known by any scientific method, thought this has never been successfully invoked, because it is generally thought a profit making enterprise should not be able to externalise the risks of its activities. The Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Directive 1993 was the second main measure.UTCCD 1993 93/13/EC and see H Collins, 'Good Faith in European Contract Law' (1994) 14 OJLS 229 Under article 3(1) a term is unfair, and not binding, if it is not \\"individually negotiatedand \\"if, contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties' rights and obligations arising under the contract, to the detriment of the consumer\\". The Court of Justice has continually affirmed that the Directive, as recital 16 states, \\"is based on the idea that the consumer is in a weak position vis-à-vis the seller or supplier, as regards both his bargaining power and his level of knowledge\\".Banco Español de Crédito SA v Camino (2012) Case C-618/10 Terms which are very skewed, are to be conclusively regarded as contrary to \\"good faith\\" and therefore unfair.See further, for the history behind the parallel in German contract law, BGB §307 Münchener Kommentar zum Bürgerlichen Gesetzbuch §307 Rn 32 For example, in RWE AG v Verbraucherzentrale NRW eV, clauses in gas supply contracts enabling the German utiliies company RWE to vary unilaterally prices were advised by the European Court of Justice to be insufficiently transparent, and therefore unfair.RWE AG v Verbraucherzentrale NRW eV (2013) C-92/11 In Brusse v Jahani BV(2013) C-488/11 the Court of Justice of the European Union advised that clauses in a tenancy contract requiring tenants pay €25 per day were likely unfair, and would have to be entirely void without replacement, if they were not substituted with more precise mandatory terms in national legislation. In Aziz v Caixa d'Estalvis de Catalunya, following the financial crisis of 2007–2008, the European Court of Justice advised that even terms regarding repossession of homes in Spain had to be assessed for fairness by national courts.(2013) Case C-415/11 In Kušionová v SMART Capital a.s., the Court of Justice of the European Union held that consumer law was to be interpreted in the light of fundamental rights, including the right to housing, in the event that a home could be repossessed.(2014) Case C-34/13 Because consumer law operates through Directives, national courts have the final say on applying the general principles set out by the European Court of Justice's case law. *Unfair Commercial Practices Directive 2005/29/EC *Consumer Rights Directive 2011/83/EU *Payment Services Directive 2007/64/EC *Late Payments Directive 2011/7/EU History *Second Bill of Rights *Consumer Bill of Rights *Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union article 169, on consumer protection The European Commission announced plans in April 2018 to strengthen consumer law and the coordination of consumer rights enforcement by national authorities.European Commission, New Deal for Consumers, 11 April 2018 Human rights *European Convention on Human Rights *Charter of Fundamental Rights, guarantee a high level of consumer protection Product safety *Product Liability Directive 85/374/EEC Fair contract terms Unfair terms *Unfair Consumer Contract Terms Directive 93/13/EC Information and withdrawal *Consumer Rights Directive 2011/83/EUThis amended Directive 93/13/EEC and Directive 1999/44/EC and Directive 85/577/EEC and Directive 97/7/EC *Gebr.

The oil on canvas is thought to have been painted between the years 1632-1633. Produced at the height of his fame, Anthony van Dyck served as \\"principal Paynter in order to their Majesties\\" in the court of Charles I of England whilst working on this self-portrait. The symbolism behind the sunflower and gold chain have been a point of contention amongst various art historians. His successful ventures in the southern part of the Netherlands and Italy propelled him into a career as court painter and made him a favourite of King Charles I and his court. Van Dyck's devotion for capturing the likeness of his models gave him authority over the world of portraiture long after his death in 1641. With such a long and storied career in art, his portrait technique evolved into what is referred to as his Late English period as seen in Self-Portrait with a Sunflower. This work is now in the private collection of the Duke of Westminster, housed at Eaton Hall in Cheshire.  Description  The portrait features the artist Anthony van Dyck looking over his shoulder at the viewer. His gaze centres on the viewer, as if calmly startled by the presence of an onlooker. His right hand is poised to touch the bottom petals of a yellow sunflower. His left index finger and thumb hold a gold chain that extends across his right shoulder and down his posterior side. This is a visual trick of calling attention to the chain and the message it portrays. This chain is understood to be a gift the artist received from his patron, Charles I. The gold chain holds a medal with the king's likeness on it, but is concealed by the artist's right arm sleeve. He is portrayed to be outdoors in nature, as seen by the clouds in the background. He is clothed in a richly-dyed pink overcoat with a white shirt visible on his collar, shirt cuffs, and a slender slit on his back. The light source is radiating from the bottom left corner, illuminating the outer petals of the sunflower. This gives the visual effect of the sunflower \\"shining\\" on Anthony van Dyck's face in approval, a common interpretation of the sunflower.  Background   Van Dyck in the Court of Charles I  King Charles I was notoriously famous for his patronage of the arts, and during the early 1600s, extended his collection of artwork extensively with the addition of works once owned by the Duke of Mantua. During the height of his rule, Charles had amassed a great collection of works totalling an estimated 1,750 paintings, some of which were created by Van Dyck. Shortly after his coronation in 1626, the King sought to create a fleet of Baroque artists, including Peter Paul Rubens and Orazio Gentileschi, to work and live in England. The Dutch artist Daniël Mytens was Charles' official court painter before Van Dyck's arrival to England, yet lacked the skills in order to depict Charles as regally as he wished. Van Dyck was soon sought after for his work following a submission of a self-portrait to court officials, along with a religious work created for the Queen, Henrietta Maria of France. He was asked to come to England in April of 1632, was knighted for his work and loyalty to the crown later in July, and subsequently became a favourite of Charles. He received a quiet house of his own along with a handsome pension of £200 annually. It is estimated that Van Dyck created over 40 portraits of King Charles alone, along with various other paintings of the royal family together. These works were commonly sent to other monarchs and functioned as diplomatic gifts. In England, Van Dyck was able to develop his style more extensively and live well within his means as an artist.  Provenance  The painting belongs to the private collection of the Duke of Westminster. It is currently housed in the country house of Eaton Hall, located in Cheshire, England. Since the work belongs to a private collection, it currently is not and has not been on public display for quite some time. The current title holder of Duke and over-seer of Eaton Hall is Hugh Grosvenor, 7th Duke of Westminster. The young billionaire aristocrat has a net worth of nearly £9 billion, making him the world's richest man under 30 years of age. In 2013, he was named the godfather of Prince George of Cambridge. Self-Portrait with a Sunflower finds great company amongst the collection the Grosvenors have amassed throughout the centuries; some other notable names in their private collection include Rembrandt, Thomas Gainsborough, and Claude Lorrain. The Duke has been known to loan works out for a handful of exhibits, but Van Dyck's self-portrait has not been publicly displayed in over a decade. A spokesperson for the Duke made a comment in 2007 that no private appointments to view any work in the collection will be taken. The painting was shown in the exhibition Charles I: King and Collector in the Royal Academy of Arts from 27 January to 15 April 2018.Desmond Shawe-Taylor and Per Rumberg (Editors): Charles I: King and Collector (Exhibition catalogue). Royal Academy of Arts, 2018, p. 233.'Charles I - King and Collector'. in: arthistorynews.com, January 26 2018, Retrieved 2019-12-06.  Interpretation   Sunflower  Historians and scholars have hotly debated the symbolism behind the sunflower. The concept of the language of flowers and deriving symbolism from flora had not yet gained the popularity that it would later have in literature, art, poetry, and more; yet it is important to note that a plethora of flowers were associated with certain traits and characteristics even in the Baroque era. Many believe that the sunflower in general is symbolic of devotion and fidelity. The first form of evidence to suggest this theory comes from 17th century English emblem books, in which the sunflower represents loyalty. Many of these emblem books were published and made available in Van Dyck's home city, Antwerp. Although he did not state personally that this devotion is specifically to the Crown, it has been interpreted that this portrait is a declaration of loyalty only to Charles I. Presiding as court painter to the king of England was an honour that Van Dyck revelled in, as well as an accomplishment that any artist would be proud to be employed as. Historians are quick to acknowledge that the golden chain Van Dyck has draped across his right shoulder is one that was gifted to the artist by his patron, along with the fact that the work was created during the height of his career whilst residing in the court of the monarch. The sunflower and its position are believed to be facing him, in indication that the monarchy looks upon him in approval. Yet it is not unanimously agreed that there is direct correlation between the artist and the patron specifically. Anthony van Dyck created a work likely between 1635 to 1650 that depicted his dear friend Sir Kenelm Digby, an English astrologer, natural philosopher, and royal courtier. The oil on canvas is titled Sir Kenelm Digby with a sunflower. A testament to the friendship between the two men would be the several portraits Van Dyck painted to honour the late Venetia Stanley, Digby's wife. He also completed a family portrait of the Digby couple and their two young children between 1632–33, the same years he worked on his sunflower self-portrait. The sunflower in Kenelm Digby's portrait would not make sense to function as the same symbolic nod to the crown. It would be more accurate for the sunflower to symbolise devotion and allegiance here, for Digby served the Crown as an unofficial naval consultant in the mid 1620s, as well as fought in a duel in 1641 in defence of the King and his namesake. Those in favour of this particular theory also state that Van Dyck's personal nature did not lend itself to be boastful about his dependency on another, even if that person was the King of England. Later, in the early 1640s, the portrait would be used during the English Civil War as a loosely defined propaganda piece, persuading citizens to join arms for a royalist allegiance, and successfully did so in uniting the war-torn kingdom. This is evidence to prove that if the sunflower were to be a symbol only of Van Dyck's fidelity to his patron, the portrait would not have favoured as well with a wide audience looking for inspiration and relatable meaning in an artwork.  Gold Chain  Famously, the chain Anthony van Dyck dons in the portrait is a token of Charles I's appreciation for his artistic work. Van Dyck had only been in England for a little over a year before a warrant was issued from court officials for the medal of 'One Hundred and Ten Pounds value' be given to him. Historians believe the chain and medal were designed by Nicolas Briot. Oftentimes, gifts such as these were worked into the commission price an artist were to be paid following the completion of a work. Not only was the token of appreciation a nod to the work Van Dyck had accomplished during his first year as court painter, but also a royal decree of his status in England. When comparing the artist's other self- portraits, especially those he made while he was pupil under Peter Paul Rubens, the way he portrays simple, functional chains differs vastly to the outwardly candid adornment he sports in Self-Portrait with a Sunflower. The touching of the chain is symbolic of his deep and active involvement in his duties, yet he restrains from making that the centre of the self-portrait by balancing the chain imagery with the sunflower.  Van Dyck or Vandyke Beard  Anthony van Dyck was well known for his many attempts of capturing his own likeness on canvas. As such, viewers were exposed to his unique style through his artwork. Van Dyck was capable of influencing 17th century Englishmen into adopting his mannerisms and outward appearance. He was known for wearing his facial hair in a particular way, and would later popularise the look by painting his various models with the same beard. The style known as the Van Dyck beard came to consist of a moustache and goatee with the hair on the cheeks completely shaven. The moustache could be curled at the tips and include or exclude a soul patch depending on personal preference. The look was thought to have a regal and stately appearance, and King Charles I himself often liked to be depicted wearing the facial hair style in his portraits. Because Charles I was seen so often sporting the Van Dyck beard, it is also referred to as the \\"Charlie\\". The trend slowly died out before practically disappearing from fashion during the English Restoration under the rule of King Charles II. In Self-Portrait with a Sunflower, Van Dyck is sporting a classic \\"Vandyke\\"; his chin goatee consists of a tapered end, and his moustache tips are curled and pointed upward. His upper lip is nearly hidden by the thick, dark hair of his moustache whilst remaining cleanly trimmed, indicative of the pride he has in the growth of his hair and his appearance.  Copies There is a copy of the painting, which was also painted by van Dyck, in the property of the foundation of the Friedenstein Palace in Gotha (Germany).

Built about 1811, it is a reminder of the modest industrial enterprises once conducted in the area using the water power it provided, and is one of the state's few surviving crib dams. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. Description and history The dam is located in far western Guilford, upstream of the Green River Covered Bridge, which spans the Green River at the junction of Green River Road with Jacksonville Stage Road. The dam is about long, with a maximum height of , and spans the river in a semicircle open to the downstream side. The material of the dam mostly logs and rubble, with plank facing. The abutments of the dam are now a combination of stone and concrete, the wing wall on the east side extending downstream toward the bridge, where it formed part of the foundation of a now-destroyed mill. The earliest recorded documentation of a dam on this site dates to 1811, when Jonah Cutting is known to have a paper and linseed oil mill operating at the site. Some of the materials of the present dam may well date to this period. By 1856 the mill is only documented as being used for paper production. In 1869 a major flood apparently damaged the mill beyond repair, and it may also have damaged the dam; it washed out the bridge then standing just downstream. In 1871 Henry Stowe erected a lumber and grist mill on the site, which operated until 1918, when it was destroyed by fire. The dam has since then been maintained by private owners, forming a picturesque part of the small Green River village and a reminder of its modest industrial past. This iconic slice of Vermont is owned, maintained and preserved by the Green River Village Preservation Trust - a 501 (c) (3) non-profit. Along with the Green River Timber crib dam and millpond, the Green River Village Preservation Trust, also owns maintains and preserves the church and village green in the heart of the Green River Village.

In 2014 he was appointed General Coordinator of the Public Media System of the City of Buenos Aires, which includes the radios AM 1110 (the city radio) and FM 2x4, the city channel, the Cultural Agenda and La Agenda, a magazine of ideas and culture in the city founded during his term. In the October elections of 2015, he was elected as Parlasur representative for the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, after leading the ballot in PRO. After taking office as President of the Nation, on 10 December 2015 Mauricio Macri appointed Avelluto as Minister for Culture of the Nation.  Administration as head of the Ministry of Culture  On 10 December 2015, he took office as Minister for Culture of the Nation. Innovation, creativity, federalism and consensus among the Argentinian people stand out as the main focus points in his administration. has three subsecretaries: Culture and Creativity (Enrique Avogadro), Cultural Cooperation (Iván Petrella) and Cultural Heritage (Marcelo Panozzo). Regarding the direction of his administration, Avelluto said in an interview with the newspaper La Capital de Rosario: \\"I have the challenge of proving that I can make cultural politics without propaganda and without asking the artists who they vote for, or what their partisan and ideological sympathies are. The relevance of the artists is in their work and in their talent. There is no greater value. The state must open the field to those who agree with the government and those who do not, that is the challenge when it comes to making public policies.\\" He added: \\"Our vision poses a much more luminous, open, plural and diverse scenario to several orientations of the world, that enrich one another. There are no good guys and bad guys facing each other in unresolved conflicts, we are looking for a more open process of collective construction.\\" In an interview for the digital newspaper Infobae, he pointed out that his administration \\"aims at generational renewal\\". The Ministry's Secretariat for the Strategic Coordination of National Thought was dissolved. Avelluto pointed out that “the notion of the existence of a 'national thought' is very typical of the 20th century: the idea that there is a thought of ours that is in confrontation with another way of thinking. To us there are many forms of thought and all are produced, consumed, generated, intervened by Argentines.\\" Avelluto conserved the autonomous functioning of different institutions (National Library, National Arts Fund, National Theater Institute, INCAA, National Commission of Public Libraries, national museums, permanent companies, etc.). Where appropriate he appointed recognized specialists, such as Leandro de Sagastizábal and Alejandro Tantanian, as heads. Avelluto also announced the appointment of Alberto Manguel, the internationally recognized author, as director of the National Library.  The legacy bequeathed  In June 2015 the government presented the Report El estado del Estado (The state of the State), which sought to carry out \\"a diagnosis of the National State in December 2015 and identify the pending challenges, which sometimes coincide with mistakes or excesses of the immediately previous administration, but often show long-standing Argentinian frustrations, sometimes even decades old.\\" In the section on the situation inherited at the Ministry, the Report stated that \\"the main characteristics of the Ministry of Culture were disorder and administrative inefficiency. This was verified, for example, with the existence of unpaid debts for 156 million pesos. Another central aspect was the excessive hiring of personnel in the last year of the previous administration, in which the central management of the ministry went from 3,000 to 4,064 employees only in 2015, among different employment categories. Several dozens of these hirings were made in the last hours before the change of government.”  First months of his term as minister  From the beginning of the term Pablo Avelluto was incorporated to the Cabinet for Human Development of the government, in charge of monitoring and generating measures to alleviate sensitive social situations. In addition to his specific role as Minister for Culture, he acted as a spokesperson for the administration of President Mauricio Macri, which was reflected in his frequent participation in interviews and radio and television programs. Avelluto also played a prominent role in the organization of the celebrations for the Independence Bicentennial about which it was pointed out that they were \\"the beginning of our third century together and the opportunity to, beyond our differences, show what unites us.\\" On the part of the Ministry of Culture, the celebrations included the renewal of the Historic House of Independence, the organization of the most important traveling exhibition in the history of the National Museum of Fine Arts and the launch of the Current Art Laboratories in Tucumán and of the Days of Art and Thought in the Bicentennial House of the City of Buenos Aires as well as commemorative activities in all national museums.

It was active from 1870 to 1919. History The MWSA was founded in 1870 by suffrage activists Julia Ward Howe, Lucy Stone, Henry Browne Blackwell, and others. It was affiliated initially with the national American Woman Suffrage Association, which had been founded the previous year, and later became a chapter of the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). One of its own affiliates was the Cambridge Political Equality Association. The MWSA lobbied for women to get the vote and the right to be officials of civic organizations such as school boards, educated people about women's rights, organized public demonstrations such as rallies and parades, and coordinated with suffrage associations in other states. Among the people active in the MWSA were physician Martha Ripley, social activist Angelina Grimké, reformer Ednah Dow Littlehale Cheney, and suffragist Susan Walker Fitzgerald. In 1892, the recent merger of several national suffrage associations and other factors prompted Alice Stone Blackwell and Ellen Battelle Dietrick to write a new constitution for the MWSA that would expand its capacities and funding base (e.g. by making it possible for the MWSA to receive bequests). The new MWSA was incorporated in December of that year. A decade later, in 1901, it merged with a smaller Massachusetts suffrage organization, the National Suffrage Association of Massachusetts. By 1915, the MWSA had over 58,000 members. Others involved with the organization included Margaret Foley, Sarah E. Wall , and Jennie Maria Arms Sheldon. During her senior year at Radcliffe College, Maud Wood Park was invited to speak at their annual dinner. Between 1904 and 1915, the MWSA was headquartered at 6 Marlborough Street in Boston's Back Bay, afterwards the headquarters of the Women's Municipal League of Boston and then the home of physician Louis Agassiz Shaw, Jr. In 1920, after the passage of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution gave women the vote, the MWSA became the Massachusetts League of Women Voters. Records pertaining to the history of the MWSA are held by Radcliffe College's Schlesinger Library.

Distribution and habitat Orphulella speciosa occurs east of the Rocky Mountain region all the way to the Coast of the Atlantic. It also occurs in the southern region of Canada and in the northern region of Mexico. O. speciosa inhabits areas of tallgrass and mixed grass prairies, often preferring areas of shorter grass that are interspersed throughout the prairie plant matrix, including grasses that have been grazed upon by larger animals. At the southern end of the range (e.g., in Texas), adult O. speciosa are most abundant during August to October, with fewer adults present from May to December. In the northern extent of its range (e.g., New England) adult O. speciosa are most abundant during the months of July and August. Identification Orphulella speciosa has a very slanted face. The margins of the vertex of the head (the top of the head, located between the eyes) are less raised. The foveola (a small dent in the integument) is not distinct. The pronotal disks are found at the top of the first thoracic segment and are almost equivalent in width in the front and back. The principal sulcus on the pronotum, which is a ridge that cuts the middle of the outer integument, cuts the prenatal disk a little past the middle. The tegmina (the leathery, slender forewings extend to the end of the hind femora, and curve in towards the apex. The males' hind femora often vary in size from 1.5 mm to 3mm from the end of the femora. O. speciosa are sexually dimorphic; the females are much larger than the males. Female body sizes range from 16-21.5 mm with antennae that are 5-6mm long, tegmina that are 9-16mm long, and hind femora that are 9.5–12 mm long. Males range from 13-14mm in total length with antennae 4.5-6.5mm in length, tegmina, 101–13 mm in length, and hind femora are 8.5–10 mm in length. On lower end of the lateral lobes (the vertical sides of the pronotum of the males, there is a pale curved line. O. speciosa individuals exhibit much variation in color, especially combinations of green and brown. Females are often light green with a dark coloration on the vertex of the head. Females are occasionally brown and have a line on the sides of the pronotum. O. speciosa looks very similar to a related species in the same genus, O. pelidna. These two species can be identified from one another by looking at the fastigium (the part of the head that is located in between the eyes of the grasshoppers and their size. O.speciosa has a small median ridge on the fastigium and is much smaller than O. pelidna. O. pelidna has a semicircular indentation that is set farther back than on O. speciosa, and O. pelidna has a lateral carinae that is incised twice. Nymphal development Like all grasshoppers, nymphs of O. speciosa have incomplete metamorphosis: their nymphs are born looking similar to the adults, and they go through five instar stages (4 different molting events) until they reach the adult stage. First and second instars have patterns of green on their heads; however, the antennae are terminally expanded (they grow from the head outwards) . Second instars have antennae that are flat and are pointed at the end. The hind femora of the first and second instars appear tan and they have a green thorax. Instars II to V have filiform, or threadlike, antennae. Third and fourth instars have tan, brown, green, and gray body color patterns, and their hind femora appear fuscous (brownish-gray) .

He was Chairman of Royal Dutch Shell of Argentina for fifteen years and served as Minister of Energy during the Mauricio Macri's administration. Biography Aranguren was born in the Entre Ríos Province, and became a chemical engineer at the University of Buenos Aires. Royal Dutch Shell He joined Shell Argentina in 1979, and became a director from 1997 to 2015. He opposed the administration of president Nestor and Cristina Kirchner and won several cases against the state for the state-controlled prices. Minister of Energy He was appointed Minister of Energy by Mauricio Macri in 2015. Aranguren arranged the removal of state subsidies to electricity, gas, and water distribution, which caused a huge increase in the taxes for those services. Those increases were met by protests in numerous cities by people bearing banners, bugles, and noise- making cacerolazos. The government justified it as a required step to reduce the huge fiscal deficit, and pointed that the subsidy system had almost ruined the whole energy distribution system. Macri explained this at the State of the State report, and Aranguren at an audience at the Congress. Several courts nulled the tax increase, as it had been ordered with a previous audience with customers to explain it, as required by law. The Supreme Court ratified the temporary halt to the tax increase, but only for residential customers. The customer audiences were celebrated in September. Although he resigned to Shell to work as a minister of Energy, he still kept shares for $16.3 million from the company. There was a controversy over it, as some of his rulings benefited Shell, and he may have had a conflict of interest in it. Aranguren considered that there was no conflict of interest, but sold his shares anyway, as suggested by the anticorruption office. He considered that government transparency had to clear for the Argentine society. On 5 November 2017, the Paradise Papers, a set of confidential electronic documents relating to offshore investment, revealed that Aranguren have managed two offshore companies, Shell Western Supply and Trading Limited and Sol Antilles y Guianas Limited, both subsidiaries of Royal Dutch Shell.

Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, the present structure of the temple is believed to have been built during the Kongu Cholas period in the 10th century. Shiva is worshipped as Thirumuruganatheeswarar and his consort Parvathi as Avudainayagi. The presiding deity is revered in the 7th century Tamil Saiva canonical work, the Tevaram, written by Tamil saint poets known as the Nayanmars and classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam. A granite wall surrounds the temple, enclosing all its shrines. The temple does not have a rajagopuram, the gateway tower, a common feature in South Indian temples. The temple is open from 5:30 am – 12:45 pm and 3:30 - 8:15 pm on all days. Four daily rituals and many yearly festivals are held at the temple, of which the Brahmotsavam celebrated during the Tamil month of Maasi (February - March) for Sundarar and Mahashivaratri festival being the most prominent. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Legend The name of the village is derived from the lord Murugan who himself is supposed to have installed and worshipped lord Shiva in the temple at this place. Murugan killed the demon king Surapadma at the behest of the Devas. He incurred Brahmahatti Dosha for slaying the demon into two pieces. Muruga is believed to have dug a spring with his Vel, the spear and worshipped Shiva at this place. Since Muruga worshipped his father Shiva, the presiding deity came to be known as Muruganathaswamy. thumb Sundarar is a famous Saivite saint and Nayanmar belonging to the 8th century. He has revered many Shiva temples in South India in his verses compiled as the Seventh Thirumurai. As per Hindu legend, while arriving at this place, he took rest in a Vinayaka temple. He presumably forgot to get thoughts about Shiva and to test his devotion, Shiva sent his Bhutaganas to steal all his possessions. Sundarar prayed to Vinayaka in the temple who showed him to proceed towards the East. Sundarar, in his anger, sang about Shiva blaming him of not protecting his possessions. Shiva graced him with his presence at this place and restored all his possessions. Architecture Shrines of Shiva and Parvathi inside the temple The temple is believed to have been built by the Kongu Cholars, with 68 recorded inscriptions from the king Vikrama Chola I seen on the walls of the sanctum and around the precinct. Thirumuruganatheeswarar temple is located in Thirumuruganpoondi, a village located from Tiruppur on the Tiruppur- Avinasi road. The temple is constructed in Dravidian style of architecture. It is classified as Kokkudi Koil, a temple built in a place surrounding flower garden. As per the inscriptions, the temple was surrounded by Kokkudi, a type of flower plant. The temple does not have rajagopuram as in other South Indian temples. All the shrines are housed in a rectangular enclosure measuring . The sanctum houses the image of Thirumuruganatheeswarar in the form of Lingam, an iconic form of Shiva facing West. There is an Ardha Mandap and a Mukha mandap, pillared halls leading to the sanctum. There is a shrine of Muruga facing South, towards the Shiva shrine. Since Muruga is believed to have used his weapon, the Vel, to dig the spring, he is seen without his weapon in the shrine, nor his vehicle peacock. The first precinct has the images of Vinayakar, Durga, Dakshinamurthy and Chandikeswara. The shrine of Avudainayagi is seen in the first precinct facing west. There are sculptural depictions of Sundarar on the walls showing him in three different emotions of anger, humiliation and happiness. There is a hall of Nataraja called Adavallan Sabha. There are three temple tanks associated with the temple - Shanmugha Theertham, Gnana Theertham and Brahmatheertham. There are images of Kalabhairavar and Lingothbhavar, which are considered architectural specimens of the Kongu Cholars. Culture Image of six faced Muruganathswamy The temple follows Saivite tradition. The temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. The temple rituals are performed four times a day: Ushakalam at 6:00 a.m., Kalasanthi at 8:00 a.m., Uchikalam at 12:00 p.m., and Sayaratchai at 5:00 p.m. Each ritual has three steps: alangaram (decoration), neivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for both Thirumuruganatheeswarar and Avudainayagi. There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple. The temple is open from 5:30 am – 12:45 pm and 3:30 - 8:15 pm. Brahmotsavam celebrated during the Tamil month of Maasi (February - March) for Sundarar and Mahashivaratri festival being the most prominent. There are other common festivals like Thaipoosam, Annabhishekam, Kanthasashti and Karthigai Deepam celebrated in the temple. Sundarar, an 8th-century Tamil Saivite poet, venerated Thirumuruganatheeswarar in ten verses in Tevaram, compiled as the Seventh Tirumurai. As the temple is revered in Tevaram, it is classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam, one of the 275 temples that find mention in the Saiva canon. Out of the 275 temples that are revered by the three saints, Sundarar has exclusively visited 25 temples with this temple counting as one of them. Of the five thandavams performed by Shiva in different places, this place is counted as the one where he performed the Brahma Thandavam In modern times, the temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu.

In the late Ming and Qing dynasties, it was a standard text read by the daughters of aristocratic families.Zhang Mingqi, \\"The Four Books for Women: Ancient Chinese Texts for the Education of Women\\", B. C. Asian Review, volume 1, 1987. The four books had circulated separately and were combined by the publishing house Duowen Tang in 1624. The four books are Admonitions for Women (NǚjièIn Chinese, «女誡».) by Ban Zhao, Women's Analects (Nǚ lúnyǔIn Chinese, «女論語».) by Song Ruoshen and Song Ruozhao, Domestic Lessons (NèixùnIn Chinese, «内训».) by Empress Xu, and Sketch of a Model for Women (Nüfan jieluIn Chinese, «女范捷录».) by Lady Liu.Liu, Wenjia, \\"Female Same-sex Desire and Women's Agency in Feng shuangfei,\\" Intersections: Gender and Sexuality in Asia and the Pacific, Issue 35, July 2014. In Admonitions, Ban Zhou, China's foremost female scholar, expounds on general principles and philosophical points. In Women's Analects, the Songs illustrate these principles with practical examples relevant to everyday life.Wang, Robin, Images of Women in Chinese Thought and Culture: Writings from the Pre-Qin Period Through the Song Dynasty, \\"The Analects for Women\\", pp. 327-340. Hackett Publishing, 2003. In Model for Women, Lady Liu retells the inspiring tales of various women in Chinese history. There are example of every kind of famous women from every period. Aside from Ban Zhao, there is also Liang Hongyu, who beat war drums in battle to encourage her husband, a Song dynasty general. Scholarship and sacrifice for nation and family are extolled. Ban Zhao's book was the most widely read of the four. She wrote that a woman should practice \\"reverent submission\\", respect for the three obediences and four virtues, and \\"set her husband on a par with Heaven.\\" Ban Zhao compared marriage to the Dao, with the husband as the yin and the wife as the yang. This is a more romantic view of marriage than anything found in Confucius. Ban Zhao's life story was more inspiring than her writing.Ko, Dorothy, Teachers of the Inner Chambers: Women and Culture in Seventeenth- century China, Stanford University Press, 1994, pp. 54-55. She was a Han dynasty scholar who not only tutored an empress, but also completed an official history begun by her brother. Reformers in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries often cited her to make the case for female education. The Four Books explicitly argues for such education. \\"There were no wise and chaste women who were not created through education,\\" as Domestic Lessons puts it. Regardless of content, the Four Books were designed to teach women to read, a controversial and progressive idea at the time. All four books were written by accomplished women, a point many editions underline by including biographical sketches and drawings of the authors in scholarly regalia. The \\"four books\\" of the title alludes to the four books of Neo-Confucianism compiled by Zhu Xi. This was a textbook used by those studying for the Imperial Examinations. Female learning is thus promoted as a realm on the same level as male learning. \\"The is no doubt that women read both the Four Books for Women and the Four Books they were not supposed to read,\\" according to modern scholar Dorothy Ko.

It occurs in all species of animals except the porifera (sponges) and placozoans. Types of NSCs include neuroepithelial cells (NECs), radial glial cells (RGCs), basal progenitors (BPs), intermediate neuronal precursors (INPs), subventricular zone astrocytes, and subgranular zone radial astrocytes, among others. Neurogenesis is most active during embryonic development and is responsible for producing all the various types of neurons of the organism, but it continues throughout adult life in a variety of organisms. Once born, neurons do not divide (see mitosis), and many will live the lifespan of the animal.  Neurogenesis in mammals  Developmental neurogenesis During embryonic development, the mammalian central nervous system (CNS; brain and spinal cord) is derived from the neural tube, which contains NSCs that will later generate neurons. However, neurogenesis doesn't begin until a sufficient population of NSCs has been achieved. These early stem cells are called neuroepithelial cells (NEC)s, but soon take on a highly elongated radial morphology and are then known as radial glial cells (RGC)s. RGCs are the primary stem cells of the mammalian CNS, and reside in the embryonic ventricular zone, which lies adjacent to the central fluid-filled cavity (ventricular system) of the neural tube. Following RGC proliferation, neurogenesis involves a final cell division of the parent RGC, which produces one of two possible outcomes. First, this may generate a subclass of neuronal progenitors called intermediate neuronal precursors (INP)s, which will divide one or more times to produce neurons. Alternatively, daughter neurons may be produced directly. Neurons do not immediately form neural circuits through the growth of axons and dendrites. Instead, newborn neurons must first migrate long distances to their final destinations, maturing and finally generating neural circuitry. For example, neurons born in the ventricular zone migrate radially to the cortical plate, which is where neurons accumulate to form the cerebral cortex. Thus, the generation of neurons occurs in a specific tissue compartment or 'neurogenic niche' occupied by their parent stem cells. The rate of neurogenesis and the type of neuron generated (broadly, excitatory or inhibitory) are principally determined by molecular and genetic factors. These factors notably include the Notch signaling pathway, and many genes have been linked to Notch pathway regulation. The genes and mechanisms involved in regulating neurogenesis are the subject of intensive research in academic, pharmaceutical, and government settings worldwide. The amount of time required to generate all the neurons of the CNS varies widely across mammals, and brain neurogenesis is not always complete by the time of birth. For example, mice undergo cortical neurogenesis from about embryonic day (post-conceptional day) (E)11 to E17, and are born at about E19.5. Ferrets are born at E42, although their period of cortical neurogenesis does not end until a few days after birth. In contrast, neurogenesis in humans generally begins around gestational week (GW) 10 and ends around GW 25 with birth about GW 38-40. Epigenetic modification As embryonic development of the mammalian brain unfolds, neural progenitor and stem cells switch from proliferative divisions to differentiative divisions. This progression leads to the generation of neurons and glia that populate cortical layers. Epigenetic modifications play a key role in regulating gene expression in the cellular differentiation of neural stem cells. Epigenetic modifications include DNA cytosine methylation to form 5-methylcytosine and 5-methylcytosine demethylation. These modifications are critical for cell fate determination in the developing and adult mammalian brain. DNA cytosine methylation is catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). Methylcytosine demethylation is catalyzed in several stages by TET enzymes that carry out oxidative reactions (e.g. 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine) and enzymes of the DNA base excision repair (BER) pathway. Adult neurogenesis Neurogenesis can be a complex process in some mammals. In rodents for example, neurons in the central nervous system arise from three types of neural stem and progenitor cells: neuroepithelial cells, radial glial cells and basal progenitors, which go through three main divisions: symmetric proliferative division; asymmetric neurogenic division; and symmetric neurogenic division. Out of all the three cell types, neuroepithelial cells that pass through neurogenic divisions have a much more extended cell cycle than those that go through proliferative divisions, such as the radial glial cells and basal progenitors. In the human, adult neurogenesis has been shown to occur at low levels compared with development, and in only two regions of the brain: the adult subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles, and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Subventricular zone In many mammals, including rodents, the olfactory bulb is a brain region containing cells that detect smell, featuring integration of adult-born neurons, which migrate from the SVZ of the striatum to the olfactory bulb through the rostral migratory stream (RMS). The migrating neuroblasts in the olfactory bulb become interneurons that help the brain communicate with these sensory cells. The majority of those interneurons are inhibitory granule cells, but a small number are periglomerular cells. In the adult SVZ, the primary neural stem cells are SVZ astrocytes rather than RGCs. Most of these adult neural stem cells lie dormant in the adult, but in response to certain signals, these dormant cells, or B cells, go through a series of stages, first producing proliferating cells, or C cells. The C cells then produce neuroblasts, or A cells, that will become neurons. Hippocampus Significant neurogenesis also occurs during adulthood in the hippocampus of many mammals, from rodents to some primates, although its existence in adult humans is debated. The hippocampus plays a crucial role in the formation of new declarative memories, and it has been theorized that the reason human infants cannot form declarative memories is because they are still undergoing extensive neurogenesis in the hippocampus and their memory-generating circuits are immature. Many environmental factors, such as exercise, stress, and antidepressants have been reported to change the rate of neurogenesis within the hippocampus of rodents. Some evidence indicates postnatal neurogenesis in the human hippocampus decreases sharply in newborns for the first year or two after birth, dropping to \\"undetectable levels in adults.\\"  Neurogenesis in other organisms  Neurogenesis has been best characterized in model organisms such as the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Neurogenesis in these organisms occur in the medulla cortex region of their optic lobes. These organisms can represent a model for the genetic analysis of adult neurogenesis and brain regeneration. There has been research that discuss how the study of “damage- responsive progenitor cells” in Drosophila can help to identify regenerative neurogenesis and how to find new ways to increase brain rebuilding. Recently, a study was made to show how “low-level adult neurogenesis” has been identified in Drosophila, specifically in the medulla cortex region, in which neural precursors could increase the production of new neurons, making neurogenesis occur. In Drosophila, Notch signaling was first described, controlling a cell-to-cell signaling process called lateral inhibition, in which neurons are selectively generated from epithelial cells. In some vertebrates, regenerative neurogenesis has also been shown to occur. Other findings There is evidence that new neurons are produced in the dentate gyrus of the adult mammalian hippocampus, the brain region important for learning, motivation, memory, and emotion. A study reported that newly made cells in the adult mouse hippocampus can display passive membrane properties, action potentials and synaptic inputs similar to the ones found in mature dentate granule cells. These findings suggested that these newly made cells can mature into more practical and useful neurons in the adult mammalian brain.

The expanded operation has 30 offices worldwide serving 100 markets and employs around 1,500 people. Company history Dormer Tools (1913–2013) Dormer Tools was founded on 4 September 1913 by Mr H.A. Dormer and Mr L. Robertson as The Sheffield Twist Drill Co. Ltd on the corner of Solferino Street and Cemetery Road in Sheffield, England, with a workforce of around 20 people. On 5 June 1916, while serving with the diplomatic service as Deputy Director of Production at the Ministry of Munitions, Robertson was killed aboard along with Field Marshall Lord Kitchener, Secretary of State for War. The Dormer brand trademark – originally used as a brand name for the company's twist drills – was registered in 1924. In time, the Dormer name was so well known globally that it would become the official company name (see 1975). In the early 1950s the company became the first drill manufacturer in Europe to introduce the steam temper treatment to its products.Power & Works Engineering, volumes 47–48, 1952 In 1975 SKF acquired the companyThe Engineer, volume 241, 1975 and, in the process, became the world's largest manufacturer of High-Speed Steel cutting tools. In 1992 Dormer was acquired by the Sandvik group. In 2007 Dormer merged with Precision Twist Drill and Union Butterfield in US, Canada and Mexico. Pramet Tools (1951–2013) Pramet's roots date to 1933 when the Stellwag company began production of cemented carbide and natural diamond tools.
