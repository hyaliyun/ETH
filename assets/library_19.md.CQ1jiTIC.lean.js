Raised for service during the New Guinea campaign, the squadron existed between October 1942 and November 1943, and undertook a variety of support roles including search and rescue, transportation, reconnaissance and casualty evacuation. Upon disbandment, it was used to raise two new communications units. History Raised on 1 October 1942 at Port Moresby, the unit operated for around a year, serving in the New Guinea campaign. The unit was initially formed as a single flight, before being expanded to a full squadron in November 1942, under the command of Squadron Leader Jerry Pentland,RAAF Historical Section, Units of the Royal Australian Air Force, p. 186 a World War I veteran, who was considered the oldest pilot in the RAAF at the time, but who had extensive experience operating in New Guinea. At this time it was designated the \\"Rescue and Communication Squadron\\", although it was also sometimes referred to as \\"No. 1 Rescue and Communication Squadron\\". The squadron was based at various locations around New Guinea, including Goodenough Island, and mainland airfields such as Vailala, Kerma, Amau, Dobodura, Gurney and Garaina. Crews often operated from remote airfield, isolated for many months. They operated across a very wide area, dropping supplies to Australian troops around Milne Bay; evacuating civilians from remote areas in the northern highlands; evacuating wounded soldiers from locations as far afield as Buin as well as along the Kokoda Track; and rescuing downed Australian and US airmen. Tasked with many roles, including personnel and freight transportation; aerial survey; photographic reconnaissance; casualty evacuation; and search and rescue operations, the squadron operated a wide variety of aircraft, including de Havilland Tiger Moths, De Havilland Dragons, de Havilland Fox Moths, de Havilland Dragon Rapides and Avro Ansons. It was also responsible for \\"transmitting and relaying messages over the Owen Stanley Ranges\\", and for carrying out airfield suitability assessments as the Allies sought out sites for airfield construction and expansion to support ground operations in New Guinea. In the search and rescue role, the squadron also used several flying boats, consisting of Supermarine Walruses, Dornier Do 24s and Consolidated PBY Catalinas. Many of the aircraft allocated to the squadron were obsolescent, but operating at low level they proved quite versatile and effective in evading Japanese aircraft, taking advantage of the low-take off and landing speeds to land in small clearings that other aircraft could not have utilised. The squadron's Walrus aircraft were also able to put down on narrow rivers where the larger Catalinas were unable to land. Several aircraft were lost during the squadron's operations. On 21 October 1942, the squadron lost one aircraft to an accident shortly after take-off from Garalina, which killed its two crew members. Another aircraft was lost on 11 September 1943 during search and rescue operations to find the crew of a Bristol Beaufighter that had ditched off New Britain.Odgers, Air War Against Japan, pp. 78‚Äì79 A Walrus was also lost when it came under heavy machine gun and small arms fire while attempting a rescue close to shore. Three members of the squadron were involved in rescuing crewmembers of a US Martin B-26 Marauder that crashed at Hood Point on 10 January 1943. Squadron Leader Walter Pye assumed command in June 1943, taking over from Pentland. The squadron continued operations until it was disbanded in November 1943, at which time it was split to form two new units: No. 8 and No. 9 Communications Units. The squadron was credited with rescuing more than 200 personnel.

Ramelson was the first British representative to greet the People‚Äôs Republic of China after its establishment in 1949. Ramelson wrote The Petticoat Rebellion: a century of struggle for women's rights concerning the suffrage movement published in 1967.  Biography  Marian Jessop was born in 1908 in Leeds, to parents Thomas Austin Jessop, an engine fitter, and Ethel Jessop, n√©e Wilson. Her father was a socialist and trade unionist, and served as a Leeds city councillor and was lord mayor in 1956. He supported women's suffrage, and his activism influenced Ramelson in her own political views. She joined the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1932, and was active in the Leeds Communist Party. This followed an already long involvement in trade union activities and membership of the Labour Party, and she joined CPGB after her father's experience of long spells of unemployment; hardening her resolve to end capitalism. She served as vice-president of the local trades council in 1934 to 1935, and at this time was also secretary of Leeds May Day committee. In 1935 she attended the International Lenin School in Moscow, an official training school for key political workers operated by the Communist International, in the final British enrollment. Following the two year course, she became the Party's first woman district organizer, for West Riding. In 1938 she was promoted to the party‚Äôs central committee. Ramelson's career in the Party was inhibited because of gender politics; she was displaced as Yorkshire district secretary by a younger, less experienced man, Mick Bennett, and in 1943 lost her place on the central committee, with the role later given to her husband Bert. It was in the Communist Party that she met her husband Bert Ramelson, to whom she gave guidance and support when he was a new member, and the couple married in 1939. Ramelson was the first British representative to greet the new People‚Äôs Republic of China in Beijing, which has been established in 1949 by the Chinese Communist Party following the Chinese Civil War, and officially recognised by Britain in 1950. She arrived in China in December 1949 for an Asian Women's conference. In 1950 she described China in the Daily Worker; \\"China is free. That fact lights up the East as a blazing sun\\". After meeting her at communist historians' gatherings, the historian Eric Hobsbawm described Ramelson as \\"marvellous and remarkable\\". Ramelson is the author of The Petticoat Rebellion: a century of struggle for women's rights, a socialist, feminist history of the suffrage movement published in 1967. She died in 1967 from cancer, following a long illness.

The book ‚ÄúInequality, Grievances, and Civil War‚Äù, which was published by Cederman together with Kristian Skrede Gleditsch and Halvard Buhaug in 2013 with Cambridge University Press, won four prizes, including the International Studies Association Best Book Award, the American Political Science Association Conflict Processes Best Book Award, the Conflict Research Society Book of the Year Award (co-winner) and the Network of European Peace Scientists Medal for the best publication in peace sciences. Cederman was twice granted the Heinz Eulau Award for the best article in the American Political Science Review in 2011 for the co-authored article ‚ÄúHorizontal Inequalities and Ethno-Nationalist Civil War: A Global Comparison‚Äù, and in 2001 for the article ‚ÄúBack to Kant: Reinterpreting the Democratic Peace as a Collective Learning Process.‚Äù The GROWup Project, which serves as the main outlet for data generated by Cederman's research group, was honoured as the ‚Äúbest data contribution to the study of any and all forms of political conflict‚Äù by the American Political Science Association, which awarded it with the J. David Singer Data Innovation Award in 2015. In 2018, Cederman was awarded the Marcel Benoist Swiss Science Prize for his work on political peace-building and the inclusion of ethnic minorities. Grants Cederman was and is the principal investigator in several research projects with funding from the Swiss National Science Foundation and the Swiss Network for International Studies. In 2018, he was also awarded a European Research Council (ERC) advanced grant of 2.5 million euro for a research project on nationalist state transformation and conflict. Data Since 2003, Cederman and his research group have been collecting evidence on ethnic groups and their participation in conflict processes. Going beyond analysing data at the country-level, the effort has concentrated on disaggregating the unit under study, overcoming some of the inherent limitations by obtaining revealing information at different levels of aggregation. This immense data collection undertaking culminated in the widely used Ethnic Power Relations (EPR) Dataset Family. This identifies all politically relevant ethnic groups and their level of access to state power for all countries in the world from 1946‚Äì2017, as well as provides geo-spatial information through polygons that describe the location of these groups on a digital map, their involvement in conflicts, their linguistic, religious and racial cleavages, and their presence in refugee flows. Using advanced technologies such as satellite imaging (e.g. topography, emission of light at night as a proxy for economic development, etc.) and interlinking their own data with other datasets, Cederman's research group has derived new and critical statistical information at the country, administrative division, and ethnic group levels. The resulting information and indicators are made accessible in a user-friendly manner via the GROWup - Geographical Research On War, Unified Platform.

The tribe's main centre is (Ain Al Dhawahir) Alain, and the village, then town (now city). They have long had a strong alliance with the Ruling family of Abu Dhabi, Al Nahyan within the confederation of Bani Yas.  Alain and early history  The tribe's traditional area of influence is the Oasis of Alain, where at the turn of the 20th century, they owned most of the cultivated land and property with the exception of Buraimi village itself. Numbering 4,500, the tribe consists of three subsections: the Daramikah, who populated Hili, and Qattara; the Jawabir in Al Ain and the Bani Saad who lived in Jimi. Staying in the villages for the summer date season, in winter the community would move throughout the Trucial States. They kept large flocks of sheep, herded camels and traded in charcoal, which they burned. The fertile woodlands of the oasis, irrigated by a highly effective falaj system, supported this wood-burning industry. The early history of the Dhawahir seems to suggest they originally came from the south and populated Dhahirah in Alain. A later wave of settlers, the Na'im, have long had an uneasy relationship with the Dhawahir and the two tribes were frequently in dispute.  Conflict with Muscat and Sharjah  A number of interests jostled for influence over the Dhawahir and Na'im of Alain, including the Sultan of Muscat, the Wahhabis (who had made a number of incursions) and Sheikh Sultan bin Saqr of Sharjah, who had established a number of forts in the oasis. Sheikh Tahnun bin Shakhbut Al Nahyan commanded the loyalty of many of the Bedouin families in the area ('You will be aware that Dhahirah belongs to us' he told the British in 1839) and established his primacy there when, in 1824, an agreement was forced on Sharjah in which Sheikh Sultan bin Saqr Al Qasimi recognised Tahnun's claim to Buraimi, and then demolished the forts he had built there. The Dhawahir and Manasir in Alain were close and Sheikh Khalifa bin Shakbut Al Nahyan acceded to an agreement in 1840, in which he took full responsibility for the Bani Yas, Manasir and, for the first time, the Dhawahir. Khalifa enjoyed their support as fighting men as he did most of the tribes of the interior. His popularity with the tribes was also enjoyed by his son, Sheikh Saeed bin Tahnun Al Nahyan, when facing incursions by the Wahhabis. Following one such incident, Saeed moved on Buraimi, capturing his two forts back from the Wahhabis with the help of both the Dhawahir and Awamir. He then pulled together the Bani Qitab, Ghafalah, Awamir and Bani Yas in Khatam and placed the Manasir and Mazari in Dhafrah to block the relieving Wahhabi army under Sa'ad bin Mutlaq. By 1850, Saeed's great tribal association had cleared Burami Oasis of Wahhabi forces. He subsequently accepted a stipend from the Sultan of Muscat for the defence of Buraimi. The strong and longstanding alliance between the Bani Yas and the Dhawahir was relatively unusual, with most of the tribes of the interior keen to assert their independence. The Na'im, for instance, enjoyed an often truculent relationship with the Sultan of Muscat.  Uprising against Zayed  It was not always smooth sailing, however. Sheikh Zayed bin Khalifah Al Nahyan, known as 'Zayed the Great', was a strong and charismatic leader and increased his hold on Alain by buying date groves and water rights, predominantly from the Dhawahir. It soon became obvious that this policy was changing the pattern of ownership throughout the oasis and the Dhawahir rebelled. Determined to press ahead with his scheme, he reconciled with the Na'im and then went to war with the Dhawahir in 1877. After a month-long conflict, Zayed prevailed and took two Dhawahir Sheikhs hostage to guarantee the good behaviour of the tribe. In 1891 he once again marched on the oasis, with the support of Dubai, and a force of 30 horsemen and 300 camel riders quelled the opposition and took the Dhawahir's main settlement 'Ain Dhawahir (now simply known as 'Al Ain'). He built a fort there to underline his dominion over the oasis and established a wali, appointing a member of the Dhawahir as his headman. Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Hilal Al Dhahiri lived in Jimi and was a loyal and effective representative.

It stars Qu Chuxiao, Li Guangjie, Ng Man-tat, Zhao Jinmai, Wu Jing and Qu Jingjing. Set in the far future, The Wandering Earth follows a group of astronauts and rescue workers guiding the Earth away from an expanding Sun, while attempting to prevent a collision with Jupiter. The film was theatrically released in China on 5 February 2019 (Chinese New Year's Day), by China Film Group Corporation, followed by North America and Australia on 8 February 2019. The film grossed worldwide. It is China's third highest- grossing film of all time and the third highest-grossing non-English film to date. It has received generally positive reviews from critics, with The Hollywood Reporter describing it as \\"China's first full-scale interstellar spectacular.\\" Netflix has acquired the film's global streaming rights. The film was available to stream by Netflix in various countries outside of China on 30 April 2019.  Plot  In the year 2061, the aging Sun is about to turn into a red giant and threaten to engulf the Earth's orbit within 300 years, forcing the nations of the world to consolidate into the United Earth Government to initiate a project to migrate the earth out of the Solar System to the Alpha Centauri system 4.2 light-years away, in order to preserve further human civilization. Enormous planetary thrusters running on fusion power, known as the Earth Engines, are built across the planet to propel the Earth. Human population is reduced severely due to catastrophic tsunamis that occur after the Earth's rotation is made to stop, and later as the planet moves away from the Sun, much of the surface is frozen, forcing the remaining humans to live in vast underground cities built adjacent to the engines. At the beginning of the film, the Chinese astronaut Liu Peiqiang promises to his 4-year-old son Liu Qi of his eventual return, before going to his mission to a pathfinder space station that will help navigate the Earth on its interstellar journey, and entrusts the guardianship of his son over to his father-in-law Han Zi'ang. 17 years later, Liu Peiqiang's space mission is finally about to end and he will soon return to Earth after the Chinese New Year. On Earth, a now-adult Liu Qi takes his adopted teenage sister Han Duoduo on an unauthorized trip to the surface in a heavy transport vehicle by obtaining fake IDs from criminal gangs and stealing their grandfather Han Zi'ang's trucker clearance pass. They are arrested at a checkpoint, meet a fellow prisoner named Tim, and are joined by Han Zi'ang after the his unsuccessful attempt to bribe the prison warden into releasing them. As Earth passes by Jupiter to make use of gravity assist, a \\"gravitational spike\\" causes devastating earthquakes that disable many thrusters across the globe and pull the Earth dangerously close to the gas giant. The four escape from prison amidst the chaos and attempt to make their way out in Han Zi'ang's truck, but the truck is requisitioned for an emergency mission by the military rescue team CN171-11 led by Wang Lei. They are to transport a Lighter Core (a fusion engine component) to restart the Earth Engine in Hangzhou. In the frozen wreckages of Shanghai, they lose their vehicle, and while transporting the component up the ruins of the Shanghai Tower, one of the soldiers is killed and Han Zi'ang is trapped and frozen to death. With news that the Hangzhou Engine was fully compromised and the city was completely destroyed by magma, the group is downcast. However they later find a crashed cargo plane with an intact vehicle, where the surviving onboard engineer, Li Yiyi, convinces them to transport another Lighter Core to repair the equatorial Torque Engine in Sulawesi. In space, Liu Peiqiang discovers that MOSS, the artificial intelligence commanding the space station, has directed it to escape rather than to assist the humans on Earth. He breaks out of forced hibernation and attempts to stop the space station along with Russian cosmonaut Makarov, who is killed by the spacecraft's automated security measures. Liu Peiqiang arrives in the control room, but his clearances are revoked due to his acts of insubordination and he can do little to override the escape process. Liu Qi's group arrive at Sulawesi to find that the planetary engine was already fully restored. Globally, most of the planetary thrusters have been repaired as well. However, the gravitational pull from Jupiter is too great and Earth continues to move toward it, approaching the planet's Roche limit. Liu Qi, inspired by recollections of his father's explanation of the thrusters' mechanics as a child, proposes to ignite Jupiter's abundant hydrogen atmosphere to blow Earth away. Li Yiyi proposes to hack and concentrate the Sulawesi Engine's power to fire a plasma beam tall enough to ignite Jupiter. The group overcome various challenges, such as renewed aftershock tremors that injure several members, and are able to mostly reconfigure the engine to carry out the plan, however they are not able to push the firing pin of the engine to ignite it. Liu Peiqiang is contacted by Han Duoduo, and is able to persuade the United Earth Government to use its communication channels to call assistance for the party at Sulawesi, even though MOSS reveals that the attempted solution was already proposed by other scientists and has no chance of success based on probability calculations. Other rescue and repair parties arrive and the engine is fired up, but it falls short of being able to ignite the Jovian hydrogen. Liu Peiqiang proposes flying the space station into the plasma jet and detonating the space station's fuel to ignite Jupiter's hydrogen; MOSS disagrees as the station is the back up plan should the Wandering Earth project fail. After disabling MOSS using a fire started with a bottle of vodka that Makarov smuggled on board, Liu Peiqiang manually overrides the control and apologizes to his son over failing his promise to return, before piloting the space station into the plasma jet and sacrificing himself as the ignition succeeds. Earth is saved from destruction and continues towards the destination star system. Three years later, Liu Qi is now a formal construction crew and a respected hero figure. As the film ends, Liu Qi recounts and envisions the stages of Earth's migration, a process taking 2,500 years and 100 generations to complete, still bound with uncertainty, in a hopeful tone.

He spent the following years studying the genre to direct a science fiction film.  Pre-production  In order to establish a rigorous setting, Gwo invited four scientists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) to act as consultants. The film's three thousand concept maps and more than eight thousand sub- mirrors were created by a conceptual art team of three hundred people over a period of 15 months.  Filming  Spacesuit used in the film Principal photography started on 26 May 2017, in Qingdao, a seaside city on north China's Shandong province, and wrapped on 27 September 2017. Weta Workshop made the film's spacesuits, exoskeletons and weaponry. Wu Jing was asked by Frant Gwo to play a cameo role in the film, but was later cast in a leading role. When he was told that the production had run into financial trouble, he gave up his remuneration and invested in the film to help it continue, for which he was given special thanks in the credits of the film. Due to the financial difficulties, there was a limited remuneration budget, and the salary for the lead actor Qu Chuxiao was around 100,000 yuan (US$15,000).  Post-production  The visual effects of the film were made by Base FX, Bottleship VFX, Dexter Studios, Macrograph, More VFX, Pixomondo and Black Nomad. Liu Cixin, the author of the original novella, said to state broadcaster China Central Television, \\"Chinese studios have no interest to invest in sci-fi films. US sci-fi film audiences have trust but this trust between audiences and China's sci-fi movies doesn't exist yet and this is the main difference between Chinese and US sci-fi films.\\" He said \\"It is a challenge because this trust must build between producers, investors, and the audience until people have faith in a Chinese sci-fi movie.\\"  Music  The film's music was composed by Roc Chen (),Mtime.com.Full Credits of The Wandering Earth. Retrieved 2019-03-03 and Liu Tao () as an additional composer. The film's music was performed by the British Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and conducted by Roc Chen at the Abbey Road Studios.  Release  On 25 December 2018, the first official trailer for the film was released at the China Aerospace Museum in Beijing along with a teaser poster. On 30 January 2019, Beijing-based distributor China Media Capital (CMC Pictures) announced that it has secured the international rights and is planning a sizable North American release on 8 February. The company will open the film in 22 cities in the U.S. and three in Canada, as well as throughout Australia and New Zealand. On 20 February 2019, it was announced that Netflix acquired the distribution rights to stream the film internationally. The film was expected to be available to stream globally on Netflix, outside of China, on 30 April 2019, however the film was later promoted on the Netflix Facebook page as being released on 6 May 2019.  Reception   Box office  The Wandering Earth released over the Chinese New Year holiday season, and earned more than (¬£232million) in six days, setting a new record for a Chinese film. It also set the record for the highest-grossing Chinese film on IMAX. Second weekend box office dropped 53%, on par with all other currently playing films post Chinese holiday season, as expected. The film's total gross in China stands at . Internationally, it topped the worldwide box office with a three- day opening weekend gross of $172,718,000, and had a six-day opening gross of $289,090,290. The film has grossed $693,371,204 in China, $5,875,487 in the United States and Canada, and $1,575,366 in other territories, for a worldwide total of $700,822,057.  Critical response  On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 69% based on 36 reviews, with an average rating of 6.04/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \\"The Wandering Earths story won't win many points for originality, but this sci-fi epic earns its thrills with exciting set pieces and dazzling special effects.\\" On Metacritic the film has an average score of 57 out of 100, based on reviews from 8 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". The film received a generally positive reception in China. Several state-run media publications have given the film a positive review. Specifically, Zhong Sheng, in the People's Daily, writes that the film is \\"not superheroes saving the world but mankind changing their destiny together.\\" On Douban, during the initial release, the movie had a 8.5 rating; then suddenly fell to 7.9 as of the early morning of February 23 in China. It was reported some reviewers were offered money for posting negative reviews on the rating platform. Douban banned nearly 50 users for violating guidelines and thousands of comments were removed. The rating finally stabilized at 7.9. Some commenters, specifically on Douban, who gave the film negative reviews were accused to be in bad faith or trolling, but the accusations are disputed. Tasha Robinson of The Verge describes the film as \\"rich, gorgeous, and goofy\\". Travis Johnson, of Flicks.com.au gave the film four out of five stars and, whilst criticizing the film for its lack of character development, praised the visuals and called it the best science fiction film of 2019. Ben Kenigsberg in The New York Times wrote that the film is \\"as awash in murky computer imagery, stupefying exposition and manipulative sentimentality as the average Hollywood tentpole\\", but that it proved that the Chinese film industry \\"can hold its own at the multiplex.\\" Simon Abrams of RogerEbert.com gave the film three and a half stars out of the four, saying that the experience was \\"visually dynamic, emotionally engaging.\\"  Accolades  Li Guangjie won the Golden Angel for Best Actor in a Supporting Role at the 15th Chinese American Film Festival in Los Angeles.

She was ordained by the independent Grundtvigian cleric Niels Dael in 1940 in Havrebjerg. S√∏rensen is also remembered for her extensive work as a nurse, foster mother and family carer in Southern Jutland. Biography Born on 12 July 1882 in Varde Municipality in the west of Jutland, Maren S√∏rensen was the daughter of the farmer Jacob S√∏rensen (1842‚Äì1921) and Ane Cathrine Nielsen (1849‚Äì1900). From the age of four, she was brought up by her paternal grandparents. Her grandfather Elias S. Han was a devout Methodist who cast aspersions on those who did not conform to his beliefs. When she was 10, she returned to live with her mother, resolving to serve God with a more joyful Christian attitude. The years she spent caring for her ailing mother inspired her to become a nurse. She first attended Janderup high school, before continuing her education at Sankt Lukas Stiftelsen and the Blegdam Hospital in Copenhagen. After spending three years as a nurse in Str√∏by, Stevns, she went on a course at Liselund's Grundtvigian school founded by Niels Dael. Deeply influenced by both Dael and Laurids Bertelsen Poulsen who had ties to religious developments in Southern Jutland, for the next 11 years she became a travelling nurse in the T√∏nder district and, from 1912, in Flensburg. Settling in Holb√∏l, she founded the Danish Nursing Association in Flensburg (Dansk Sygeplejeforening i Flensborg). When the First World War began in 1914, she volunteered for war service, caring for people of various nationalities, especially French and Russian prisoners of war. In 1920, she took charge of the newly built children's home in Vilstrup near Haderslev where she remained for the next 26 years, caring for more than 8,000 frail children from Southern Jutland during the summer months. She nevertheless spent the winters back in Southern Jutland caring for the Danish- speaking population just south of the border. In 1930, she built a community centre in Valsb√∏l which, in addition to rooms for sewing and carpentry, housed a prayer room and her own living quarters. Funded by private gifts and supported by national associations, it was opened by Dael over a three-day event which attracted 800 people. Although she was not entitled to become a priest under Danish regulations, she acted as a cleric, conducting services and carrying out other religious duties. Nevertheless, in 1940 she was ordained by Niels Dael in the independent Lutheran church in Havrebjerg. She was therefore not ordained into the National Church of Denmark or Danske Folkekirke which first admitted women priests in 1947. Owing to the difficulties arising from the Second World War, she was unable to work in Southern Jutland but returned to Valsb√∏l after the hostilities had ended. In 1948, when the Church of Denmark appointed a Danish priest in Valsb√∏l, S√∏rensen returned to Vilstrup. In 1952, she was honoured with the Order of the Dannebrog. Maren S√∏rensen died in Haderslev on 4 July 1957 and is buried in L√∏nborg Cemetery near Tarm in the west of Jutland.

He rose through the ranks, becoming a Deputy Minister for Agriculture and, more briefly, a member of the powerful ruling party Central Committee. He was even listed as a candidate for politburo membership. In 1963 he was stripped of his functions and his party membership was withdrawn after it was determined that he had been lying about his membership of the Waffen-SS during the Nazi period. Life Karl-Heinz Bartsch was born in L√∂blau (Lublewo), a suburb in the Danziger H√∂he region, near the German northern coast. His father was a farm-estate manager. Karl-Heinz attended school in Danzig, successfully completing his school career in 1940/41 at the city's \\"Horst-Wessel-Gymnasium\\" (secondary school). He was a Hitler Youth member. On leaving school he enrolled in a land management traineeship on the Schwikow estate, while also working as a farm labourer. The country had by this time been at war for a year and a half, and in April 1941 he volunteered to join the Waffen-SS. He was accepted and sent for a five-month training with the so-called \\"Death- head\\" 3rd SS Tank Division. He later joined the \\"G√∂tz von Berlichingen\\" SS Division. In Autumn/Fall 1942 he was posted to France. In June 1943 he was sent to the Russian front where he took part in and survived the Battle of Kursk. He was nevertheless wounded in August 1943 and was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class. Between August 1943 and January 1944 he was recuperating in a military hospital at Weiden in der Oberpfalz. He then rejoined the \\"G√∂tz von Berlichingen\\" division, now promoted to the rank of Unterscharf√ºhrer (loosely \\"junior squadron leader\\"), and was sent back to France. War ended in May 1945, and that same month Bartsch was captured and held as a Prisoner of war by the Americans. During May/June 1945 he was held in a large \\"Displaced persons' camp\\" at Saalfelden (near Salzburg) in Austria. 1944 and 1945 saw industrial- scale ethnic cleansing in the eastern part of Germany. Following frontier changes mandated by the Soviet Union and her allies Poland had moved and Danzig had become Gda≈Ñsk, so that when Bartsch was released in June 1945 there could be no question of going home. Instead he made his way to Saxony-Anhalt in the central part of Germany which was now being administered as the Soviet occupation zone. The slaughter of war had left a desperate shortage of working age labour, and during 1945/46 Karl-Heinz Bartsch worked as a farm labourer on the Lutzfeld estate. Passing his Abitur back in 1940/41 would, under peacetime conditions, have opened the way to university-level education, and in 1946, with the war over, he enrolled at the Martin Luther University in Halle. He emerged in 1949 with a degree in Agriculture. By the time he graduated with his first degree Bartsch had already, in February 1949, joined the Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschland\\" / SED). Formed less that three years earlier, the SED was by this time well on the way to becoming the ruling party in the territory that would be relaunched, in October 1949, as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic (East Germany). Towards the end of 1949 he became an \\"Aspirantur\\" (post-graduate student) at the University of Rostock Institute for Animal Research, which he combined with work as a research assistant at the nearby Dummerstorf Research Establishment (renamed in 1952 as the \\"Institut f√ºr Tierzuchtforschung Dummerstorf\\"). He received his doctorate in agriculture in 1951 in return for a comparative study (published in book form few years later) of four different dairy cattle breeds in North-west Europe. In 1952 Bartsch was appointed to take charge (as \\"business leader\\" / \\"Betriebsleiter\\") of VEG Clausberg, till recently a large landed estate and now, following the land reforms of the late 1940s, a large agricultural co-operative in the countryside to the west of Erfurt, in the south of the country. Under the highly centralised Leninist constitutional system being rolled out across East Germany, structural links between industry - including farming - and the ruling party were very close: between 1954 and 1960 Bartsch was a member of the party's district leadership team (\\"Bezirksleitung\\") for the Erfurt region. Between 1958 and 1960 he was also a department head and chairman of the faculty council at the National Academy of Agricultural Sciences. During this time he undertook research and published a record of his investigations and findings on \\"cross-breeding and performance testing of native Thuringian \\"Frankenrind\\" cattle\\" (\\"Umz√ºchtung und Leistungspr√ºfung des bodenst√§ndigen th√ºringischen Frankenrinds\\"). It was during this period, in 1959, that he was a recipient of the Patriotic Order of Merit in silver. Between 1960 and 1962 Bartsch served as deputy chief of the Agriculture department of the party Central Committee. In 1961 he received his habilitation (higher academic degree) from the University of Rostock, a qualification which would have opened the way to a full-time university career, though in his case his academic work continued to run in parallel with his political responsibilities. Between 1961 and the start of 1963 he served as Director of the Institute for Animal Research and Domestic Animal Genetics at the Agriculture Faculty at Berlin University (\\"Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin\\") where at the start of 1963 he was also appointed to a professorship. Between 1962 and the start of 1963 he also served as East Germany's Deputy Minister for Agriculture, Farm records and Forestry. At the sixth SED party congress, on 21 January 1963 Karl-Heinz Bartsch was himself (s)elected as a member of the party Central Committee. Central Committee membership had by now grown to 121. Nevertheless, the fact that Bartsch, still aged only 39, was at the same time elected as a candidate for membership of the Central Committee's inner caucus, the Politburo, indicates that within the nation's power structure his career trajectory was still strongly on the up. Indeed, on 21 January 1963 he took part in a closed meeting of the politburo. The next month, between 7 and 9 February 1963, he served as chairman of the newly created \\"Agriculture Council\\" of the Council of Ministers to which he had also now been appointed. The appointment led to him being described by one (unsympathetic western) commentator as the boss of East Germany's \\"newly founded Supreme Agricultural Authority\\" (\\"neugegr√ºndeten obersten Landwirtschaftsbeh√∂rde\\"). At this point reports appeared in the Berliner Zeitung, a West Berlin daily newspaper, that in the 1940s Karl-Heinz Bartsch had spent four years as a member of the Waffen-SS. The Ministry for State Security regional administration in Neubrandenburg was able immediately to confirm details of his National Socialist past. His fall from political power was as sudden as his rise three weeks earlier. On or before 9 February 1963 his exclusion from the Central Committee and from the Politburo was confirmed to Politburo members. Reports appeared in western media at the same time that he had been excluded from the Central Committee of the SED and released from his position as a deputy minister \\"because he had concealed his membership of the Waffen-SS and thereby greatly damaged the party\\". East German politicians and media frequently berated the West German political establishment for alleged insufficient diligence applied to \\"denazification\\" in the later 1940s, and the case of Karl-Heinz Bartsch provided a welcome opportunity for western media to return one more time to the counter-attack, with (at least) one commentator reporting that eighteen years after the National Socialist r√©gime had been destroyed, 51 of the 400 members of the East German parliament (\\"Volkstag\\") were still former Nazi Party members. The article referred to here concluded with the reassuring thought that under these circumstances there was no reason for Comrade Bartsch to give up all hope that he might one day be \\"rehabilitated\\". There was a well worn path to be followed for East German politicians who found themselves suddenly disgraced and excluded from office: Karl-Heinz Barstch played his part, with a carefully drafted statement of remorse: \\"Unfortunately I did not have he courage, when I joined the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (1949), nor subsequently, to come clean about my membership of the Waffen-SS\\". He also took the opportunity to refute reports that he had been a \\" Waffen-SS veteran\\" (\\"Alter K√§mpfer\\"), pointing out that when he had volunteered to join the organisation he had been aged just 18. Nevertheless, by a resolution of the National Party Control Commission dated 28 March 1963 his party membership was revoked because he had \\"concealed his membership of the Waffen-SS and given a false presentation of the facts about his past. Between April 1963 and February 1965 Bartsch worked as head of animal breeding at VEG Gro√ü Vielen (Waren), another agricultural co-operative that had originated as a large private estate. He then moved to Woldegk where between 1965 and 1981 he was director for animal husbandry at the agriculture co-operative. He was also in charge of the research centre for animal production there. On 3 December 1972 Karl-Heinz Bartsch applied to be readmitted to the party, but on 2 March 1973 word came through that his application had been rejected by the National Party Control Commission, apparently at the insistence of the Control Commission chairman, Erich M√ºckenberger. According to one normally reliable source, between 1967 and 1989 Karl-Heinz Bartsch was registered with the Ministry for State Security as an informant (\\"Inoffizieller Mitarbeiter\\" / IM). He was identified in the Stasi files by the cover-name \\"Eckart\\", and was of particular interest to the authorities because he provided \\"material\\" about Western European scientists and academics. Between 1981 and his retirement in 1988 Bartsch served as Agricultural Production Cooperative Chairman at a Cattle Research Establishment. After his retirement from that post he continued to teach at the Agricultural Engineering College in Neubrandenburg.

Miller (18?? ‚Äì after 1906) was an American editor and publisher of missionary periodicals. She was also the author of History of the Woman's Foreign Missionary Society of the Methodist Protestant Church, 1896. Miller's name appeared as missionary editor of the woman's department in the Methodist Recorder, published in Pittsburgh, and since 1885, as editor and publisher at the Woman's Missionary Record, organ of the Woman's Foreign Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church (WFMS; organized in 1879). She was the first editor of the Woman's Missionary Record, serving in that role for ten years. Miller served as corresponding secretary of the society for six years, represented the society in a number of the annual conferences of the church, in two general conferences, and in 1888, was a delegate to the World's Missionary Conference in London, England. Early years and education Mary A. Miller (n√©e Davis) was born in Allegheny, Pennsylvania, in the late nineteenth century. She was the second daughter of David Davis. Until the age of seventeen, she studied in the schools of her native city, her higher education being received in the Allegheny College for Young Ladies, in the same town. Career Choosing the profession of teacher, she taught for five years, until she married William Miller, of Allegheny. Her first public literary work was done in 1858, being poems and short stories, the latter of which were continued with more or less intermission, under a pen name, until 1874, when the death of her husband and the business cares consequently caused an interruption. Her natural timidity, in her early efforts, caused her frequently to change her pen name, so that it often occurred in the household that her stories were read without a suspicion of the author's presence. Her first literary work over her own name was in 1878, being a series of letters descriptive of a western trip from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to Montana by rail and stage, from Montana to Utah, and from Utah to New Mexico. Miller was a founding member of the WFMS of the Methodist Protestant Church, having been appointed to sign its Charter, along with Mrs. John Scott, Mrs. Susan E. Anderson, Mrs. J. H. Claney, and Mrs. James I. Bennett. During the Second Annual Meeting of the WFMS, held in Pittsburgh, 1881, Miller was elected editor of the \\"Methodist Recorder\\", which place she filled until the Society's official organ was started, when she became its editor. That organ, Woman's Missionary Record, was a monthly, at the price of a year. During the Third Annual Meeting, held in Cambridge, Ohio, 1882 Miller stated that in her opinion, \\"The Society's wish to be independent of the Board of Missions was that it might be able to push its work abroad with more rapidity than the policy of the Board seemed to favor.\\" At the Fifth Annual Meeting, held in Springfield, Ohio, 1884, Miller was one of three women appointed to represent the Society at the General Conference. At the Eighth Annual Meeting, Held in Ohio, Illinois, 1887, Miller and Mrs. J. E. Palmer were elected to represent the WFMS at the next session of the General Conference. At the Ninth Annual Meeting, held in Washington, D.C. , 1888, it was announced that the Society had been represented by Miller at the first Ecumenical Conference of Foreign Missions of World's Missionary Convention which met in Exeter Hall London with Miller bearing her own expenses that she might be present at this meeting and thus gain new inspiration, and likewise, place the work of the Society along with more veteran organizations. The Sixteenth Annual Session was held in 1895 at the Lafayette Ave. Methodist Protestant Church, in Baltimore, Maryland, at which, Miller, editor of the \\"Missionary Record\\", presented her resignation as she was leaving Pittsburgh to make her home in Kansas City, Kansas. She wrote the history of the WFMS in 1896, having compiled the history of the first sixteen years of the organization. In 1907, she accompanied Marietta Louise Gibson Stephens and Julia Hickey to Japan to visit the mission stations of that country.

It is a type II Seyfert galaxy and thus has an active galactic nucleus. NGC 612 has been identified as an extremely rare example of a non-elliptical radio galaxy, hosting one of the nearest powerful FR-II radio sources.  Observation history  The object was discovered by British astronomer John Herschel on 29 November, 1837. John Louis Emil Dreyer, compiler of the first New General Catalogue of Nebulae and Clusters of Stars, described NGC 612 as a \\"faint, very small, round, 12th magnitude star to the west.\\"  Physical characteristics  NGC 612 has a fairly well-developed luminous disc seen almost edge-on and features a strong dust ring. The galaxy is surrounded by an enormous disc of cool neutral hydrogen gas with a mass of M‚òâ distributed in a 140 kpc wide structure along the galactic disc and dust lane of NGC 612. The majority of the gas is relatively settled in regular rotation with a velocity of 8900 km/s. A faint bridge, spanning 400 kpc, exists between NGC 612 and the gas-rich barred spiral galaxy NGC 619, indicating that an interaction between both galaxies occurred at some point. Current or past interaction, such as a merger event, is currently the most likely trigger of NGC 612's radio source. The galaxy has an unusually young star population, with populations throughout the galactic disc having an age of ~0.04 - 0.1 Gyr.

He has been the Archbishop of Kinshasa since his appointment on 1 November 2018. He has been a bishop since 2004 and before becoming Archbishop of Kinshasa was Bishop of Bokungu-Ikela from 2004 to 2016, Apostolic Administrator of Kole from 2008 to 2015, Apostolic Administrator of Mbandaka-Bikoro in 2016 and Archbishop there from 2016 to 2018, Apostolic Administrator of Bokungu-Ikela from 2016 to 2018, and Coadjutor Archbishop of Kinshasa in 2018. He served as a parish priest and as a professor before his episcopal career and since being a bishop has been a leading voice among his conferees for national peace. He is also a professed member of the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin. Pope Francis raised him to the rank of cardinal on 5 October 2019. Education and priesthood Fridolin Ambongo Besungu was born in Boto on 24 January 1960 and prepared for the priesthood by studying philosophy in Bwamanda and theology from 1984 to 1988 at the Saint Eug√®ne de Mazenod Institute. He also entered the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin where he made his initial vows in 1981 and his perpetual profession in 1987. He later obtained a degree in moral theological studies from the Alphonsian Academy in Rome. Ambongo was ordained to the priesthood on 14 August 1988 following the completion of his education. He worked as a parish priest in Bobito from 1988 until 1989 and then as a professor at the Catholic Faculties of Kinshasa. He taught moral theology at the Mazenod Institute from 1995 to 2005. He also served as both the major superior and the vice-provincial for his order for the vice-province of the Congo. Bishop Pope John Paul II appointed him Bishop of Bokungu-Ikela on 22 November 2004. He received his episcopal consecration on 6 March 2005 from Joseph Kumuondala Mbimba with the co- consecrators Giovanni d'Aniello and Cardinal Fr√©d√©ric Etsou-Nzabi-Bamungwabi in an open-air Mass in front of the Bokungu Cathedral. On 30 October 2008 Pope Benedict XVI named him apostolic administrator for Kole, a post he held until 9 August 2015. He made his first \\"ad limina\\" visit to Francis on 12 September 2014. Archbishop Pope Francis first named him apostolic administrator for Mbandaka-Bikoro on 5 March 2016 and then Archbishop of that see on 12 November, while retaining responsibility for Bokungu-Ikela as Apostolic Administrator. He was installed in his new see on 11 December 2016. In 2016‚Äì18 he decried the repeated attempts of Congo President Joseph Kabila to push back the election in the Congo believing that it sets an alarming precedent and demonstrates the President's unwillingness to relinquish power. He defended those Catholics who organized pro-democratic demonstrations that drew violent responses from police forces. After these violent clashes he signed a statement on behalf of the bishops stating that the prelates \\"deplored the attack on human life\\" while offering their condolences to the families of \\"innocent victims\\" killed in the clashes. The statement further called for a \\"serious and objective investigation\\" to determine those responsible for the extreme violence. Ambongo opposes Kabila's candidacy for another term as president. Ambongo later led a mission of bishops to Lusaka, Zambia, to meet with Zambian President Edgar Lungu to urge him to support holding peaceful elections in the D.R.C. in December 2018. In their message to Lungu, the bishops urged support for a \\"credible, transparent, inclusive and peaceful election\\" to solve \\"the socio-political crisis\\" plaguing the nation. Ambongo also celebrated a Mass in Zambia on 9 September 2018 urging Zambians never to lose peace in their nation. On 30 May 2018, Ambongo issued a statement in Mbdanka-Bikoro announcing that there would be a suspension of those sacraments that require physical contact to administer due to an outbreak of Ebola in the area. He said that \\"this is to prevent the spread of Ebola hemorrhagic fever\\". He also advised giving the sign of peace verbally rather than physically. Ambongo condemns the exploitation of natural resources and believes that renewables will help alleviate the impact of climate change in the world. In a 4 March 2015 interview in Rome, Ambongu said that \\"the future is this renewable energy, namely solar panels\\" in order to reduce climate change, highlighting solar panels as an effort to shift gradually to renewables. He continued that \\"we, as the Church, are not opposed to the exploration of natural resources\\", though asserted that such exploration needed to be both legal and transparent. Ambongo also collaborated with Cardinal Christoph Schonborn to secure a meeting between the German and Congo environmental ministers to discuss what the countries could do to improve the quality of the environment in their respective nations. In March 2015 he reported that he has received death threats: \\"I am a person in danger in Congo\\". With a nervous laugh he told a French radio outlet: \\"I am in danger. This is true\\". In June 2016 he was elected Vice-President of the Episcopal Conference of the Congo (CENCO). On 6 February 2018, Pope Francis appointed Ambongo the coadjutor for the Kinshasa archdiocese, to succeed Cardinal Laurent Monsengwo Pasinya upon his resignation. He was presented to the archdiocese as coadjutor on 11 March 2018. He became Archbishop when Francis accepted Pasinya's resignation on 1 November 2018. He was installed there on 25 November 2018. On 5 October 2019, Pope Francis made him Cardinal Priest of San Gabriele Arcangelo all'Acqua Traversa. He was made a member of the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life on 21 February 2020. On 15 October 2020, Pope Francis appointed him to the Council of Cardinal Advisers.

On September 25, 2013, a 138-kV main feeder cable from Con Edison that provided electricity to an AC catenary-powered segment of the New Haven Line failed, causing electric train service over the line to halt between Mount Vernon, New York and Harrison, New York. Background Metro-North Railroad's New Haven Line operates from New Haven, Connecticut, to Grand Central Terminal in New York City. The New Haven Line's ridership, at 125,000 weekday and 39 million annual passengers, ranks as the busiest rail line in the United States. In early September 2013, construction was underway at Metro-North Railroad's Mount Vernon station for replacement of existing power transformers with new transformers that would enable regenerative braking capability on the New Haven Line between the Mount Vernon station and the Harrison station. The New York Power Authority was assisting Metro-North Railroad with oversight of the construction, which was being performed by contractors. Con Edison controlled power supply to the Metro-North Railroad station. Power failure The other redundant feeder cable that supplied power to that segment was out-of-service due to a planned electric equipment upgrade at the Metro-North station. There was no formal contingency plan in place between Con Edison and Metro-North in case of the failure. An attempt to draw power from a Connecticut substation in Cos Cob failed to provide enough power to supply full service on the line, and was instead used to rescue stranded trains. Metro-North used diesel locomotives and alternative bus service to carry passengers until full service was restored after 12 days of disruption. Con Edison initially provided this short-notice power by modifying available electric transformers and other equipment to Metro-North's unique power-consumption needs in an adjacent temporary location. Following the service disruptions, U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal from Connecticut held a hearing on October 28, 2013, to find out what happened during the disruption.https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-113shrg87089/html/CHRG-113shrg87089.htm Findings and effects In November 2014, the New York Public Service Commission released a public Executive Summary detailing findings from an investigation into the event. The outage was caused by liquid nitrogen, which was being used to control dielectric fluid flow in the out-of-service feeder, freezing the dielectric fluid in the adjacent live feeder supplying the sole power to the station. Con Edison had performed this type of freeze operation around 18 times a year, and had never experienced this type of failure before. The Cos Cob link is now able to provide full service power if needed. The monitoring of the use of liquid nitrogen in underground transmission feeders has been modified. There was a short term interest in examining n-1-1 power supply contingencies to various municipal power consumers following the incident.NYSPSC case no. 13-E-0529 References Category:Metro-North Railroad Category:Consolidated Edison Category:September 2013 events in the United States Category:2013 in New York (state) Category:Accidents and incidents involving Metro-North Railroad ","title":"September 2013 New Haven Line power outage"},{"id":"58936177","text":"Major-General John Primrose Douglas (22 February 1908 ‚Äì 4 September 1975), was Honorary Surgeon to the Queen.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. History Herman Frieseke and his brother Julius worked in the Owosso brickyards of Charles Shattuck and in the late 1860s purchased the operation. Their yard was a success, and in 1870 Herman could afford to construct a family home. In 1874, his son Frederick Frieseke was born in this house. Frederick showed an aptitude for art at a young age, and his parents sent him to the Art Institute of Chicago after finishing elementary school. He later moved to Paris, studied under Whistler, and was awarded the Chevalier of the Legion of Honor, the highest honor bestowed upon artists by the French state. Frieseke died in 1939 in Paris. Description The Frieseke house is a two- story, three-bay brick Italianate structure. It has rounded arch windows with soldier brick voussoirs, brackets along the cornice, and a low hipped roof.

Many of her discoveries have concerned telomerase, the RNA-containing enzyme that completes the ends of chromosomes. She works at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California.  Early life and education  Victoria Lundblad was born in the Bay Area of California to a biochemist and a school teacher. Vicki Lundblad was involved in science experiments as early as junior high school, testing whether skin emitted substances that repelled mosquitoes. She then took up playing the cello and threw herself into music studies; arriving at University of California, Berkeley, she meant to major in mathematics and music. She narrowed it down to Mathematics, but later added Biology. She pursued graduate education in biology at Harvard University, where she became Nancy Kleckner's first graduate student. At Harvard, she was excited by a lecture by Jack Szostak, Nobel laureate in 2016, about his work on telomeres with Elizabeth Blackburn. She began a postdoctoral fellowship in 1983, working with Jack Szostak on yeast with a defective telomerase that underwent early senescence. She continued her study of telomeres as a postdoctoral fellow in Elizabeth Blackburn's laboratory. In 1991, she joined the Genetics Department at Baylor College of Medicine. In 2004, she moved to the Salk Institute.  Research career  In 1989, Lundblad identified a gene named EST1 (\\"ever shorter telomeres\\") in which telomeres are lost, and found that EST1 encoded a regulatory subunit of telomerase. Later, collaborating with Nobel laureate Tom Cech, she discovered the catalytic subunit of telomerase and identified it as a reverse transcriptase with associated RNA. In 2017, three women full professors at the Salk Institute filed gender discrimination suits against the institute, pointing out that research funding was not distributed fairly, that only 13% of the research staff were women, and that of the five smallest laboratory spaces, four were assigned to women, among other problems. Salk Institute responded that Lundblad was \\"consistently ranking below her peers in producing high quality research and attracting\\" grant support and that each of the three professors ranked in \\"the bottom quartile of her peers\\". Scientific colleagues across the country objected to this characterization of Lundblad, including Nobel laureate Carol Greider, whose work also concerns telomerase, and who said Lundblad was \\"one of the few icons in the field,\\" and that \\"for me to read in a press release that she's somehow in the bottom quartile rang really poorly to me.\\" In August, 2018, Lundblad settled the lawsuit out of court with undisclosed remedies offered by the institute. In 2014 she was elected to the American Academy of Microbiology ‚Äî one of 16 women out of the 88 new fellows that year.https://www.wiareport.com/2014/08/american-academy- of-microbiology-names-16-women-as-fellows/#comment-100725  Honors and awards  * 1997 DeBakey Excellence in Research Award from Baylor College of Medicine * 2008 Pearl Mester Greengard Prize from Rockefeller University. * 2015 National Academy of Sciences in Medical Genetics, Hematology, and Oncology  Selected works  Nugent CI, Hughes TR, Lue NF, Lundblad V.(1996) \\"Cdc13p: a single-strand telomeric DNA-binding protein with a dual role in yeast telomere maintenance.\\" Science 274(5285):249-52.

With an wheelbase, Pure Hell was initially powered by a Chevrolet small-block engine V8, mounted high in the chassis, at a steep angle, to improve traction. Driver Don Petrich was replaced in 1965 by Dale Emery. The car was popular for match racing and became notorious for refusing to run in a straight line (thanks in part to its short wheelbase), wheelstanding, and running off the strip entirely. In a 1994 interview, Emery remarked, ‚ÄúWhen it locked up at half- track, it was anybody‚Äôs guess which way it would go.‚Äù On one occasion, at Fremont Raceway, the car landed upside-down in a flooded ditch after an improperly fastened steering wheel came off the steering column. After Pure Hell was outfitted with a hemi and better clutch in 1968, the car was entered in a showdown event between Funny Cars and Altereds at OCIR; Emery won the event. A week later, he recorded a pass, on his way to winning the Hot Rod Magazine Championship Drag Races at Riverside (and bettering Borsch's pass of the year before), a speed no Altered would surpass that season.

It is directed by Zaveri and produced by T-Series and Emmay Entertainment. Marjaavaan stars Sidharth Malhotra, Tara Sutaria, Riteish Deshmukh, and Rakul Preet Singh. It was described by co-producer Bhushan Kumar as a violent and dramatic love story. The music of Marjaavaan was released under T-Series and became a chartbuster with songs like \\"Tum Hi Aana\\", \\"Thodi Jagah\\" and the item number \\"Ek Toh Kam Zindagani\\". It was distributed by Pen India Limited. After change of release date three times, Marjaavaan finally premiered worldwide in theatres on 15 November 2019 and took mixed to negative reviews from film critics. It emerged as an average grosser at the box office. Plot Raghu is a loyal goon to the local thug Narayan Anna who controls the water mafia in Mumbai. Anna's dependence on Raghu doesn't sit well with Vishnu (Anna's son), whose complexes arise from more than just his short stature, as he is only three feet tall. When Raghu falls for Zoya, a mute musically- inclined Kashmiri girl who teaches children music, Vishnu jumps at the opportunity to use it to discredit his father's most favorite goon. Vishnu kidnaps Gaitonde (one of his father's enemies) and tells a kid Zoya had selected for her music festival to shoot him. Zoya sees this and flees but Vishnu is already alerted of her presence. Vishnu tells his father that there was an eyewitness to Gaitonde's murder and that witness is Zoya, so Anna orders Raghu to kill Zoya, not knowing that Raghu loves her. Raghu finds Zoya and tries to run away from Vishnu and his father but Vishnu catches them and orders Raghu, Zoya, and all the kids to be killed. Vishnu's father tells Raghu he and the kids will be safe if he kills only Zoya, as she is the eyewitness to Gaitonde's murder. Zoya tells Raghu to kill her so that he and the kids remain safe. Zoya gives Raghu the gun, places her thumb over his, pulls the tigger and dies in his arms. The police arrest a traumatized Raghu for Zoya's murder. In jail, Raghu becomes depressed and broken. Zoya is buried by the children, Raghu's friends and her friends. Vishnu tries to get Raghu killed in jail, knowing if he is released, he will take revenge. However, Raghu beats up the goons Vishnu hired. Vishnu then cuts off Raghu's friend Mazar's leg because Mazar kicked him. When Vishnu's father tells him that Raghu will be sentenced to life, Vishnu helps Raghu get out by bribing the proofs, planning to kill Raghu upon his release. However, when Raghu returns, Vishnu sees that Raghu is not the same after Zoya's death. His father tells him that Raghu died the day he killed Zoya. Vishnu tries various ways to bring Raghu back to his old ways but fails.Raghu had completely changed and all his old habits had changed. Vishnu's father catches him and warns him against this but Vishnu angrily kills his father and sends goons to kill Raghu. However, Raghu kills them all and buries them. He visits Zoya's grave and vows revenge on Vishnu; he is joined by his friends in this mission. On the day of Dussera, when Vishnu comes to burn Ravana's idol, Raghu arrives and starts beating all the goons. Vishnu pierces an arrow into Raghu's heart but Raghu burns him. While dying, Raghu sees Zoya's soul and dies peacefully, surrounded by friends and family. The police arrive and the inspector tells the Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) that Raghu died. The ACP replies that Raghu returned to his life, which was with Zoya.

Military Service Lafleur volunteered to serve in the U.S. Army prior to World War II and was serving as a chaplain in the Army Air Corps at Clark Field, the Corps‚Äô post in the Philippines when war broke out. He refused evacuation to safety and stayed with the soldiers under his care. He was captured in May 1942 and spent two years in several Japanese prisoner of war camps ministering to his fellow captives. In September of 1944, he and 750 other U.S. military personnel were placed on a ship to take them to the Japanese homeland.

As a Prisoner of War after 1 January 1942, Chaplain LaFleur constructed a chapel at the prison camp to minister to men of all faiths. He continuously advocated for food and medicine for the prisoners often intervening on their behalf, resulting in beatings at the hands of his captors.

One made the longest distance glider flight in Europe in 1938, gathering prizes for aircraft and pilot. Design and development Forward view Podlaska Wytw√≥rnia Samolot√≥w, generally known by its initials PWS, expanded into glider design and manufacture in 1936. Their first example, the PWS 101, was designed by Wac≈Çaw Czerwi≈Ñski who was a specialist glider designer, most recently of the 1934 CW 7 and CW 8. The PWS 101 was flown for the first time in the spring of 1937. The single-seat PWS-101 was an all wood sailplane with a high aspect ratio, mid-mounted, gull wing. The inner 40% part of the span had a dihedral of about 8¬∞ but the remainder had little. In plan the wings were straight-tapered, mostly on the trailing edge. Its two parts were each built around a single spar which formed the rear of a plywood D-box including the leading edge. The innermost 25% of the span was further reinforced with ply covering and the rest of the surface was fabric-covered. Divided ailerons occupied more than half the trailing edges. A DFS type air brake, mounted on the spar at about one-third span, could be extended both above and below the wing. SP-1088 just after a bungee launch Its fuselage was a ply-covered, oval section semi-monocoque structure with an enclosed, multi-transparency cockpit above the leading edges of the wing roots. Some of the production PWS-101s had water ballast tanks. The fuselage tapered smoothly aft to a conventional empennage with a straight-tapered tailplane mounted on top and a curved fin, both ply-covered. The control surfaces were fabric-covered; the rudder was large and rounded and the elevators were semi-elliptical and assisted with inboard Flettner tabs. The PWS-101 landed on a sprung skid. Operational history After completing its flight trials In the early summer of 1937 two PWS-101s joined a Polish team competing at the annual Rh√∂n glider international contest, held in July on the Wasserkuppe. The Germans judged the PWS-101 the best foreign aircraft present and one set a new Polish distance record of but they only achieved 10th and 20th places. 3/4 front view Production began shortly after the contest, with two series of five completed before the German invasion in September 1939. They did well in the national contests of 1937 and 1938 and two came first and second in the ISTUS International Contest held in Lw√≥w in May 1939. An outstanding flight between Bezmiechowa to Wilno, piloted by Tadeusz G√≥ra in May 1938, set a new Polish record of and was the greatest distance flown by a glider in Europe that year.

It has a typical apparent visual magnitude of 15.5 during the quiescent phase, but becomes brighter (up to a magnitude of 11.0) during outbursts recurring with a mean cycle length of 330 days, thus is classified as a dwarf nova of the SS Cygni type. System The system of DX Andromedae consists of a white dwarf accreting matter from a donor star through an accretion disk. The system shows a spectral type at quiescence of K1 V (plus emission lines), but the donor is considered to be a hydrogen- deficient star that has evolved off the main sequence and is overfilling its roche lobe. The donor star dominates the visible spectrum during the quiescent phase. The spectral classification of DX Andromedae as a whole is classified as peculiar of the U Geminorum type. The spectrum of the donor star is itself peculiar; enhanced absorption lines of CaI and CrI have been observed. Variability The outburst of dwarf novae are thought to arise from a thermal instability of the disk, that increases mass flow and temperature and hence the luminosity increases. In DX Andromedae different outbursts don't reach the same peak luminosity and don't occur at a regular rate, but they retain the same shape in the decaying part. It seems that the peak luminosity is correlated to the length of the preceding cycle, and the more luminous is the outburst, the faster the luminosity peak is reached. These trends can be explained by matter accumulating in the disk; more matter is accumulated in the disk during a longer cycle, and it can power a stronger outburst.

Early life Johann Friedrich Nette was born on 5 July 1673 in Bernau bei Berlin, the son of the Prussian court organ builder, also named Johann Nette. From 1685 to 1700, the Nettes lived in Dresden, where Johann Friedrich attended the Kreuzschule and then the University of Wittenberg until 1695. After that point, little is known about Nette's life until the War of the Spanish Succession. Career In 1706, Nette, at the time an engineer captain, was stationed at Balingen under the command of a Major General Sternberg. Sternberg recommended Nette to his brother-in-law Georg Friedrich von Forstner, who happened to be a friend of and Hofmarschall to Eberhard Louis, Duke of W√ºrttemberg. Nette replaced the incumbent court architect in 1707, and with that appointment was charged with the design and construction of a retreat for the Duke north of Stuttgart. Nette began work on this residence, Ludwigsburg Palace, in 1707, though it was slow thanks to the still-ongoing War of the Spanish Succession. In 1709, the Duke instructed Nette to attach two wings to the existing structure to create a three-wing palace. Despite the war, Nette traveled to Prague in 1708 and 1709 to study Bohemian Baroque architecture and recruit artisans for Ludwigsburg. On 9 December 1714, Nette died suddenly of a stroke near Nancy, in France.

Cantat received his PhD under the supervision of √âtienne Ghys in 1999 at the √âcole normale sup√©rieure de Lyon. Cantat is a professor at the University of Rennes 1. He is also a directeur de recherche of CNRS at ENS Paris. His research deals with complex dynamics and dynamics of automorphisms of algebraic surfaces. He examined the algebraic structure of Cremona groups (i.e. groups of birational automorphisms of n-dimensional projective spaces over a field k) and showed with St√©phane Lamy that for an algebraically closed field k and for dimension n=2 the Cremona group Cr(\\\\mathbb{P}^n(k)) is not a simple group. In particular, if k is the field of complex numbers and n=2, the Cremona group contains an infinite non-countable family of different normal subgroups. In 2018, Cantat was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Rio de Janeiro.

History According to a story passed down at the temple and recorded in part in the (Hu√°ny«î T≈çngzh√¨) written in 1455 and the late Qing (JiƒÅngxi√† Xi√†nzh√¨), in the year AD 208, as Guan Yu passed through the area, his troops and their horses were thirsty. In a fit of anger, Guan Yu thrust his sword into a rock (, zhu√≥dƒÅo). This opened up a spring which provided water for his troops and their horses to drink. Zhuodaoquan Temple takes its name from this story. Their horses were kept at nearby Mount Mafang (, \\"Horse Stable Mountain\\") on the present-day campus of the Wuhan University of Technology. The temple was built during the Song Dynasty. It was originally named Yuquan Temple (). It was destroyed and rebuilt many times over the course of the Ming Dynasty. It was rebuilt again during the reign of the Kangxi Emperor. During the Taiping Rebellion in the 1850s, Zhuodaoquan Temple was destroyed. It was rebuilt in 1858 after the recapturing of Wuchang by Qing forces. In 1876, 1,000 trees were planted around the temple. In 1916, the temple was renovated in the style of Siheyuan and included statues of Liu Bei, Guan Yu, and Zhang Fei. The temple was used as a headquarters for military operations during the Northern Expedition. In 1956, the temple was repaired by the Wuhan City government. In 1959, the temple was recognized as an important cultural heritage site. The temple and statues were damaged during the Cultural Revolution. The temple was reopened in 1988. In 2010, Hongshan District refurbished and restored the temple increasing the overall area of the temple. The well connecting to the Zhuodao Spring was restored.

The history and activities of the IoAAS are recorded by the Borthwick Institute for Archives, University of York, who also hold much documentary material, see External Links below. The Institute's activities were also recorded in the Vice Chancellor's Annual Reports to the University Court, typically. The Institute took a broad view of the nature of architecture that extended to management, building science, design problems in specialized building types, building economics, architectural history, conservation, landscape and townscape. Its target audience was the architectural and allied professions.333x333px The Institute was constituted well before the University, being established by the York Academic Trust. It had its origins in a summer school for architectural students first held in 1949, followed by the holding of short residential courses for architects and other related disciplines. In 1961 the Institute was incorporated into the newly established University of York, moving into the King‚Äôs Manor, York in 1966. Early proposals to establish an undergraduate school fell through, and the Institute remained a post-graduate establishment. Through the University period the IoAAS had four Directors: Professor Patrick Nuttgens 1962 to 1968 Professor Robert Macleod 1969 to 1974 Professor Douglass Wise 1975 to 1992 Professor John Worthington 1992 to 1997 The Assistant Director for most of this period was Stuart Sutcliffe. The Institute was widely supported by over thirty leading institutions, such as the RIBA (Royal Institute of British Architects), the RICS (Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors) and the DoE (UK Department of the Environment). The IoAAS was closed in 1997, following a decline in demand especially for its short course programme, which in turn led to financial shortfalls.  Sections of the IoAAS  The Institute was made up of a number of component parts: Short Course Programme The IoAAS was perhaps best known in the architectural world for its series of short courses on all aspects of architectural work, including project management, building conservation, fire safety, design principles, maintenance etc. (See illustration above and reference ). Although not called this in its day, the Institute in effect provided a substantial CPD (Continuing Professional Development) programme. Conservation Studies A one year 'Diploma Course in Conservation Studies' was established. The first course was held in 1972, under the direction of the Radcliffe Lecturer in Conservation, Dr Derek Linstrum. He was succeeded by Peter Burman from 1990 to 2002, (from 1997 under the direction of the Department of Archaeology.) The course was later upgraded to an MA. Most leading UK architectural conservation specialists of the time lectured on the course. It grew to be one of the most respected such courses in the UK and indeed attracted many international students. Notable alumni included figures such as Fran√ßois LeBlanc, Director of the ICOMOS Secretariat (1979 - 1983). Research Section The section was created to complement the IoAAS‚Äôs established educational role, under the direction of Dr Jeremy Taylor. As such, most of the research projects were centred on recognised activities of the Institute, such as the use of existing town housing stock, accommodation for undergraduates, the design of learning spaces and indeed evaluation of the need and provision of mid-career education. A typical report was 'Living over the shop: a guide to the provision of housing above shops in town centres, 1st report' (1990) written by Ann Petherick. Details of all reports can be found by searching the University of York Library, see External Links below. Design Unit This architectural practice was established to complement especially the IoAAS‚Äôs short course programme. The Chief Architect was David Crease. In the early years in particular, it carried out a number of commissions for the University, including housing for the University's Heslington campus. As it had to be self-funding, later it became a more commercially orientated practice, with an emphasis on housing. A speciality became the design of GP‚Äôs Surgeries. Parks and Gardens Following earlier research work on investigating the criteria for listing and conserving historic parks and gardens by Peter Goodchild, the ‚ÄòCentre for the Conservation of Historic Parks and Gardens‚Äô was established in 1982. The Centre made an active contribution to the first official ‚ÄòRegister of Historic Parks and Gardens in England‚Äô which was published by English Heritage in 1984. From 1987, the Centre (later known as the Landscape Unit) focused on providing short mid-career courses and running the Historic Landscape Option in the MA in Conservation Studies. It also sponsored conferences and continued to promote the recording of historic parks and gardens and this, in due course, gave rise to the ‚ÄòParks and Gardens UK Database‚Äô. Photogrammetric Unit This Unit was part of the IoAAS from 1976 to 1991, under the direction of Ross W A Dallas. While largely a ‚Äòproduction‚Äô unit producing surveys for DAMHB (Directorate of Ancient Monuments and Historic Buildings) and its successor English Heritage, it also played an important role in the development, use and promotion of the technique of photogrammetry for producing elevation drawings of historic buildings in the UK. Architectural Library From the days of the York Academic Trust, a substantial library of books, journals and AV materials relating to all aspects of architecture was established . This became part of the University‚Äôs main Library, while being housed in the King‚Äôs Manor and essentially servicing the requirements of the various students and sections of the IoAAS.  Publications of the Institute  The IoAAS produced many substantial reports on various architectural themes, many sponsored by Government departments such as the Dept of the Environment. The major reports were mostly produced by the Research Section and latterly as well by the Conservation Studies department. These Reports are listed in the University of York Library Catalogue, where full details of titles, authors, sponsors etc can be found. As well, many other minor publications are listed here.

A three-term member of the Virginia House of Delegates, Bland was known for helping to forge an alliance between African-American Republicans and the Readjuster Party.  Early life  Bland was born into slavery, probably in Dinwiddie County, Virginia, to Frederick Bland and Nancy Yates Bland. After the Civil War, the family moved to Petersburg, Virginia, where Frederick Bland worked as a shoemaker and preacher. Bland learned the shoemaker's trade from his father, and attended a local night school organized by Northerners for African Americans. He married Nancy Jones of Petersburg on December 18, 1872; two years later, they moved to City Point, Virginia, where he worked as a shoemaker. The couple had nine children.  Political career  Bland became involved in local politics in the 1870s. At a mass meeting of black Republicans in 1879, Bland gave a speech advocating an alliance with the Readjuster party led by William Mahone. With the support of the Readjusters, Bland was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates that year, defeating incumbent Robert E. Bland to represent Prince George and Surry Counties. He served on the Committee on Executive Expenditures and the Committee on Schools and Colleges, and was a delegate to the Virginia Republican Party convention in 1880. After being re-elected in 1881, he served on the Committee on Agriculture and Mining, the Committee on Claims, and the Committee on Retrenchment and Economy. During that session, black Republicans passed legislation to create a state college and an insane asylum for Virginia's African Americans and increase funding for black public schools. Their success was followed by white backlash; in 1883, Conservatives launched a white supremacy campaign which helped them regain a majority in the Virginia General Assembly. Bland was nevertheless re-elected that year and served on the Committee on Propositions and Grievances, the Committee on Enrolled Bills, and the Committee on Officers and Offices at the Capitol. After serving his third term, he yielded his seat to Republican William Faulcon but remained active in local politics.  Later years  Bland spent the rest of his life in Prince George County. He worked as a teacher, minister, shoemaker, and keeper of the Jordan Point Lighthouse, near City Point, Virginia. Around 1900, he moved to a farm, where he died of nephritis on February 13, 1927. He was buried at Providence Cemetery (now People's Memorial Cemetery) in Petersburg, Virginia. In 2012, Virginia state senator Jennifer McClellan introduced a bill (VA HJR64) to \\"Recognize and celebrate the outstanding service of the African American men elected to the Virginia General Assembly during Reconstruction, on the occasion of the Sesquicentennial of the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 2013.\\" The bill recognized Bland along with Samuel P. Bolling, Daniel M. Norton, and other notable African-American legislators. In 1954, the Edward D. Bland Courts housing project in Hopewell, Virginia, was named in his honor. Bland's descendants include civil rights leader Ben Jealous, his great- great-grandson.

Playing his club cricket for Phoenix, Reddy made his debut for Ireland in a minor match against The Catamarans in 1929, before playing a minor match against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in 1930. In 1931, he made his debut in first-class cricket for Ireland against Scotland at College Park. He played in the same fixture the following year at Greenock. A gap of four years followed before his next appearances in first-class cricket, when he played three matches against Scotland, the touring Indians, and the MCC. He played two more first-class matches, in 1937 against the English Minor Counties cricket team, and in 1939 against Scotland. He scored 202 runs in his seven first-class matches, at an average of 16.83, with a high score of 50 not out. This score, which was his only first-class half century, came against Scotland in 1932. Outside of cricket, he worked as an insurance company executive. He died at Dublin in December 1991.

France suffered heavily during World War I in terms of lives lost, disabled veterans and ruined agricultural and industrial areas occupied by Germany as well as heavy borrowing from the United States, Britain, and the French people. However, postwar reconstruction was rapid, and the long history of political warfare along religious lines was finally ended. Parisian culture was world-famous in the 1920s, with expatriate artists, musicians and writers from across the globe contributing their cosmopolitanism, such as jazz music, and the French empire was in flourishing condition, especially in North Africa, and in Subsaharan Africa. Although the official goal was complete assimilation, few colonial subjects were actually assimilated. Major concerns were forcing Germany to pay for the war damage by reparations payments and guaranteeing that Germany, with its much larger population, would never be a military threat in the future. Efforts to set up military alliances worked poorly. Relations remained very tense with Germany until 1924, when they stabilized thanks to large American bank loans. However, after 1929 the German economy was very badly hit by the Great Depression, and its political scene descended into chaos and violence. The Nazis under Hitler took control in early 1933 and aggressively rearmed. Paris was bitterly divided between pacifism and rearmament, so it supported London's efforts to appease Hitler. French domestic politics became increasingly chaotic and grim after 1932, moving back and forth between right and left, without clear goals in mind. The economy finally succumbed to the Great Depression by 1932 and did not recover. The popular mood turned very sour and focused its wrath on the corruption and scandals in high government places. There was a growing threat of politicized right-wing violence in the streets of Paris, but the numerous right-wing groupings were unable to forge a political coalition. On the left, the Popular Front pulled together Radicals (a centrist group), socialists and communists. The coalition stayed in power for 13 months from 1936 to 1937. After massive labor union strikes, it passed a series of reforms designed to help the working classes. The reforms were mostly failures, and the disheartened Popular Front collapsed on foreign policy issues. War came when Hitler's Germany stunningly reached a d√©tente with Stalin's Soviet Union in August 1939, and both countries invaded Poland In September 1939. France and Britain had pledged to defend Poland and so declared war on Germany.  Wartime losses France suffered severe human and economic damage during the war. The human losses included 1.3 million men killed, or 10.5 percent of the available Frenchmen, compared to 9.8 percent for Germany and 5.1 percent for Great Britain. In addition, 1.1 million veteran men were severely wounded and often incapacitated. Many hundreds of thousands of civilians had died in the \\"Spanish\\" flu, which struck as the war was ending. The population was further weakened by missing births, amounting to about 1.4 million while the menfolk were at war. In monetary terms, economist Alfred Sauvy estimated a loss of 55 billion francs (in 1913 value), or 15 months worth of national income that could never be restored. The harsh German occupation had wreaked special havoc on 13,000 square miles in northeastern France. In addition to the smashed up battlefields, the region's railways, bridges, mines, factories, commercial offices and private housing were all massively affected. Germans pillaged the factories and farms, removing machines and tools as well as 840,000 head of cattle, 400,000 horses 900,000 sheep and 330,000 hogs. The government promised to make it good again, committing 20 billion francs. The plan was to have Germany repay everything by reparations. Repairs and rebuilding were quick and highly successful.Philippe Bernard and Henri Dubief, The Decline of the Third Republic, 1914‚Äì1938 (1988) pp. 78‚Äì82.Frank Lee Benns, Europe since 1914 (8th ed. 1965) pp 303-4. Economic and social growth The interwar total population grew very slowly, from 38.8 million in 1921 to 41.2 million in 1936. Educationally, there was steady improvement, and secondary enrollment grew from 158,000 in 1921 to 248,000 in 1936. University enrollment grew from 51,000 to 72,000. In a typical year, there were from 300 to 1200 strikes taking place, jumping to 17,000 in 1936, with the number of strikers soaring from 240,000 in 1929 to 2.4 million in 1936. As in other industrial countries, exports grew rapidly in the 1920s and plunged greatly in the 1930s. The gross domestic product was quite stable in the 1930s, as France successfully resisted the worldwide Great Depression. Industrial production recovered prewar levels by 1924 and declined only by 10 percent during the depression. Throughout the interwar period, steel and coal were strong, and motor vehicles became the major new industrial sector of increased importance during the 1920s.Thelma Liesner, One Hundred Years of Economic Statistics (Facts on File, 1989), pp. 177‚Äì200. Labour movement Labour unions had supported the war effort and grew rapidly until 1919. The general strike and railway strikes of 1920 were a total failure; 25,000 railwaymen active in the unions were later fired, the companies blacklisted union leaders and trade union membership plunged. In 1921, the General Confederation of Labour (CGT) split permanently, with more extreme elements forming the Conf√©d√©ration g√©n√©rale du travail unitaire (CGTU) It enlisted the syndicalists who wanted direct union ownership and control of the factories by and for the benefit of the workers. It soon lost the spirit of revolutionary syndicalism and came under the close control of the Communist Party, which in turn was controlled by the Profintern, the Red Trade Union International, based in the Kremlin.Alexander Werth and D. W. Brogan, The Twilight of France, 1933-1940 (2nd ed. 1942) p. 102. In the 1920s and the 1930s, the Paris Metal Union became the test bed for communist unionism at the plant level. The model spread to all communist unions as the party shifted from winning votes at general elections to control of factory cells. A small number of disciplined party members controlled the cells, which then controlled the entire union at the factory. The strategy was a success and was essential to very rapid growth in the 1930s.Michael Torigian, \\"From guinea pig to prototype: Communist Labour policy in the Paris metal industry, 1922-35,\\" Journal of Contemporary History (1997) 32#4 pp. 465‚Äì81. Union membership doubled during the war and peaked at 2,000,000 for 1919 out of some 8,000,000 industrial workers, or about 25 per cent. After the plunge in 1921, membership slowly grew to 1,500,000 in 1930, or 19% of the 8 million employed that year. The heaviest losses came in metal factories, textile mills, and construction. The greatest density was in printing, where 40% were members. Blue-collar government workers were increasingly unionized by 1930, especially the railways and trams.D. J. Saposs, Labour Movement in Post-War France (1931) pp. 117‚Äì25. online Great Depression Evolution of gross domestic product in several countries between 1929 and 1939 The Great Depression affected France from 1931 to 1939 but was milder than other industrial countriesHenry Laufenburger, \\"France and the Depression,\\" International Affairs (1936) 15#2 pp. 202‚Äì224 While the 1920s economy grew very fast at 4.4% per year, the increase in the 1930s was only 0.6%.Jean-Pierre Dormois, The French Economy in the Twentieth Century (2004) p. 31 The depression was relatively mild at first since unemployment peaked under 5%, the fall in production was at most 20% below the 1929 output and there was no banking crisis.Paul Beaudry and Franck Portier, \\"The French Depression in the 1930s,\\" Review of Economic Dynamics (2002) 5:73‚Äì99 The depression had some effects on the local economy, which can partly explain the 6 February 1934 crisis and especially the formation of the Popular Front, led by the leader of the socialist SFIO, leader, L√©on Blum, who won the 1936 elections. The sour economic mood after 1932 heightened French exclusionism and xenophobia, which caused protectionism against importing foreign goods and allowing in foreign workers. Asylum-seekers were not welcome, including thousands of Jews trying to flee Nazi Germany after 1933. Hostility to foreign workers was connected to the lack of a legal framework for the effective treatment of refugees.Greg Burgess, \\"France and the German refugee crisis of 1933.\\" French History 16.2 (2002): 203‚Äì229. The middle classes resented Jews in France and showed anger at competition for jobs or business. That fed anti-Semitism, which was more than a symbolic protest against the republic or communism. By the end of 1933, France began to expel refugee Jews, and right-wing movements escalated their rhetorical anti- Semitism.Vicki Caron, \\"The Antisemitic revival in France in the 1930s: the socioeconomic dimension reconsidered.\\" Journal of Modern History 70.1 (1998): 24‚Äì73. online Social and cultural trends Religion Almost all of the population used church services primarily to mark important life events, such as baptism, marriage and funerals. Otherwise, religiosity was steadily declining and already varied enormously across France. The largest groupings the devout Catholics, the passive Catholics, the anticlerical secularists, and small minorities of Protestants and Jews.W. D. Halls, Politics, Society and Christianity in Vichy France (1992) pp. 3‚Äì38 Online Pope Benedict XV (1914‚Äì1922) ended Pope Pius X's harsh anti-modernist crusade and returned to the tolerant policies of Pope Leo XIII. That enabled the French modernizers, such as Christian Democrat Marc Sangnier, who had led the liberal Sillon until the Church pressured him into shutting it down, to be restored to the Church's good graces.Gear√≥id Barry, \\"Rehabilitating a Radical Catholic: Pope Benedict XV and Marc Sangnier, 1914‚Äì1922.\\" Journal of Ecclesiastical History 60.3 (2009): 514‚Äì533. The new spirit from Rome enabled a permanent end to the rancorous prewar battles between secularism on one hand and Church on the other. It had climaxed in a major victory for the anticlerical Republicans in the 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State, which disestablished the Catholic Church and took legal control of all its buildings and lands.Jean-Marie Mayeur and Madeleine Reb√©rioux, The Third Republic from its Origins to the Great War, 1871‚Äì1914 (1984) pp. 227‚Äì44. Reconciliation was enabled by the wartime dedication of so many Catholics fighting and dying for the nation and so most allegations of disloyalty disappeared. More immediately, the conservatives secured a large majority in the Chamber of Deputies In the 1919 elections, and Aristide Briand took the opportunity for reconciliation. In 1920, 80 members of Parliament joined the delegation to Rome for the canonization of Joan of Arc. Formal diplomatic relations were reestablished in January 1921. In December 1923 the government set up diocesan associations under control of bishops for the administration of church property that had been seized two decades earlier. In January 1924, the pope approved, and the church was reestablished in the dominant position in French society.J. de Fabr√®gues, J. \\"The Re-establishment of Relations between France and the Vatican in 1921.\\" Journal of Contemporary History 2.4 (1967): 163‚Äì182. The Catholics set up numerous local organizations, especially youth groups, to try to combat falling activism among the remaining church members. In 1919, the Church established a union, French Confederation of Christian Workers (CFTC), to bargain with employers and act as a political force. It was in competition with socialist and communist labor unions. However, only a few industrial workers were unionized until the 1930s. Expatriate culture Expatriate writers, artists, composers and would-be intellectuals from around the world flocked to Paris for study, entertainment, connections and production of artistry in a highly-supportive environment.Arlen J. Hansen, Expatriate Paris: A Cultural and Literary Guide to Paris of the 1920s (2014) Many Americans came to escape the commercialism back home. Led by Gertrude Stein, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, E. E. Cummings, William Faulkner and Katherine Anne Porter, they formed a lively colony that sought out new experiences and soon had a large impact on culture back home.Brooke L. Blower, Becoming Americans in Paris: Transatlantic politics and culture between the World Wars (2011) A new factor was the arrival of hundreds of university students stretching their experiences through one of several junior year abroad programs that began about 1923. They lived with French families and took classes at French universities under the close supervision of their American professor for which they earned a full year's academic credit.Whitney Walton, \\"Internationalism and the junior year abroad: American students in France in the 1920s and 1930s.\\" Diplomatic History 29.2 (2005): 255‚Äì278. Many musicians came to study with Nadia Boulanger. Black Paris Aim√© C√©saire, a poet from Martinique, was a representative leader of the emerging black community of Paris in the 1920s and 1930s. He was a founder of the n√©gritude movement, a racial identity movement for a community that included blacks from the French West Indies, the US and French Africa.Tyler Stovall, \\"Aim√© C√©saire and the making of black Paris.\\" French Politics, Culture & Society 27#3 (2009): 44‚Äì46. Other prominent leaders included L√©opold S√©dar Senghor (elected in 1960 as the first president of independent Senegal) and L√©on Damas of French Guiana. The intellectuals disavowed colonialism and argued for the importance of a Pan-African racial identity worldwide. writers generally used a realist literary style and often used Marxist rhetoric reshaped to the black radical tradition.Gary Wilder, The French Imperial Nation-State: Negritude & Colonial Humanism Between the Two World Wars (2005). Blacks from the US made a dramatic impact by introducing New Orleans-style jazz.Tyler Stovall, Paris noir: African Americans in the city of light (1996). American music had a major impact since the avant-garde welcomed what they called \\"wild sound\\" of rhythmic explosions that unleashed gyrations upon the dance floor. However, white French musicians based in dance halls softened the harsh and shocking US style and made it very popular.Jeffrey H. Jackson, \\"Music‚ÄêHalls and the Assimilation of Jazz in 1920s Paris.\\" Journal of Popular Culture 34#2 (2000): 69‚Äì82. Foreign policy French foreign and security policy after 1919 used traditional alliance strategies to weaken the German potential to threaten France and to force the Germans devised by France in the strict Treaty of Versailles. The main diplomatic strategy came after the French army demanded the formations of alliances against Germany. After resistance, Germany finally complied, aided by American money, and France took a more conciliatory policy by 1924 in response to pressure from Britain and the United States and the French realization that its potential allies in Eastern Europe were weak and unwilling to co-ordinate.Peter Jackson, \\"France and the problems of security and international disarmament after the first world war.\\" Journal of Strategic Studies 29#2 (2006): 247‚Äì280.Nicole Jordan, \\"The Reorientation of French Diplomacy in the mid-1920s: the Role of Jacques Seydoux.\\" English Historical Review 117.473 (2002): 867‚Äì888. Establishing military alliances with the United States or Britain proved to be impossible and one with the Soviets in 1935 was politically suspect and was not implemented. The alliances with Poland and Czechoslovakia proved to be weak ties and collapsed in the face of German threats in 1938 in 1939.Piotr Stefan Wandycz, The Twilight of French Eastern Alliances, 1926-1936: French- Czechoslovak-Polish Relations from Locarno to the Remilitarization of the Rhineland (1988) ch 1 online 1920s France was part of the Allied force that occupied the Rhineland following the armistice. Foch supported Poland in the Greater Poland Uprising and in the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War and France also joined Spain during the Rif War. From 1925 until his death in 1932, Aristide Briand, as prime minister during five short intervals, directed French foreign policy by using his diplomatic skills and sense of timing to forge friendly relations with Weimar Germany as the basis of a genuine peace within the framework of the League of Nations. He realised France could not contain the much larger Germany by itself or secure effective support from Britain or the League.Eugen Weber, The Hollow Years: France in the 1930s (1996) p. 125 In January 1923, after Germany refused to ship enough coal as part of its reparations, France and Belgium occupied the industrial region of the Ruhr. Germany responded with passive resistance, which included printing vast amounts of marks to pay for the occupation, which caused runaway inflation. That heavily damaged the German middle class, whose savings became worthless, but also damaged the French franc. The intervention was a failure, and in the summer of 1924, France accepted the American solution to the reparations issues, as expressed in the Dawes Plan. It had American banks make long-term loans to Germany, which used the money to pay reparations.Conan Fischer, The Ruhr Crisis 1923-1924 (2003). The United States demanded repayment of the war loans although the terms were slightly softened in 1926. All loans, payments and reparations were suspended in 1931, and everything was finally resolved in 1951.Adamthwaite, Grandeur and Misery pp. 29‚Äì30, 48.Philip A. Grant Jr. and Martin Schmidt, \\"France and the American War Debt Controversy, 1919-1929\\" Proceedings of the Western Society for French History (1981), Vol. 9, pp. 372‚Äì382. In the 1920s, France built the Maginot Line, an elaborate system of static border defences that was designed to stop any German invasion. However, it did not extend into Belgium, and Germany attacked there in 1940 and went around the French defenses. Military alliances were signed with weak powers in 1920‚Äì21, called the \\"Little Entente\\".William Allcorn, The Maginot Line 1928‚Äì45 (2012). Politics Parties The Republican-Radical and Radical- Socialist Party, usually called the Radical Party, (1901‚Äì1940), was the 20th- century version of the radical political movement founded by Leon Gambetta in the 1870s. It attracted 20‚Äì25% of deputies elected in the interwar years and had a middle-class base. The \\"radicalism\\" meant opposition to royalism and support for anticlerical measures to weaken the role of Catholic Church in education and supported its disestablishment. Its program was otherwise vaguely in favor of liberty, social progress, and peace, and its structure was always much thinner than rival parties on the right (such as the Democratic Republican Alliance) and the left (socialists and communists). Party organizations at the departmental level were largely independent of Paris. National conventions were attended by only a third of the delegates, and there was no official party newspaper. It split into moderate and leftist wings, represented respectively by √âdouard Herriot (1872‚Äì1957) and √âdouard Daladier (1884‚Äì1970). \\"Socialist\\" in its title was misleading, and the party had little support among workers or labor unions. Its middle position made it a frequent partner in coalition governments, and its leaders increasingly focused on holding office and providing patronage to their followers. Other major leaders included Georges Clemenceau (1841‚Äì1929), Joseph Caillaux (1863‚Äì1944), and Aristide Briand (1862‚Äì1932).Peter J. Larmour, The French Radical Party in the 1930s (1964).Mildred Schlesinger, \\"The Development of the Radical Party in the Third Republic: The New Radical Movement, 1926-32\\" Journal of Modern History 46#3 (1974), pp. 476‚Äì501 online 1920s Domestic politics in the 1920s were a product of unresolved problems left by the war and peace, especially the economics of reconstruction and how to make Germany pay for it all. The great planners were Raymond Poincar√©, Alexandre Millerand and Aristide Briand. France had paid for the war with very heavy borrowing at home and from Britain and the United States. Heavy inflation resulted, and in 1922, Poincar√© became Prime Minister. He justified his strong anti-German policies: :Germany's population was increasing, her industries were intact, she had no factories to reconstruct, she had no flooded mines. Her resources were intact, above and below ground.... [i]n fifteen or twenty years Germany would be mistress of Europe. In front of her would be France with a population scarcely increased.√âtienne Mantoux, The Carthaginian Peace, or The Economic Consequences of Mr. Keynes (1946), p. 23. Poincar√© used German reparations to maintain the franc at a tenth of its prewar value and to pay for the reconstruction of the devastated areas. Since Germany refused to pay nearly as much as Paris demanded, Poincar√© reluctantly sent the French army to occupy the Ruhr industrial area (1922) to force a showdown. The British strongly objected, arguing that it \\"would only impair German recovery, topple the German government, [and] lead to internal anarchy and Bolshevism, without achieving the financial goals of the French.\\" The Germans practiced passive resistance by flooding the economy with paper money that damaged both the German and French economies. The standoff was solved by American dollars in the Dawes Plan. New York banks lent money to Germany for reparations to France, which then used the same dollars to repay the Americans. Throughout the early postwar period, Poincar√©'s political base was the conservative nationalist parliament elected in 1920. However, at the next election (1924), a coalition of Radical Socialists and Socialists called the \\"Cartel des gauches\\" (\\"Cartel of the Lefts\\") won a majority, and Herriot of the Radical Socialist Party became prime minister. He was disillusioned by the imperialist thrust of the Versailles Treat, and sought a stable international peace in rapprochement with the Soviet Union to block the rising German revanchist movement, especially after Hitler's rise in January 1933.Alexander Werth, Which Way France (1937) pp. 21‚Äì38 online 1930s Conservatism and fascism The two major far-right parties were the French Social Party (Parti social fran√ßais, PSF), originally the Fiery Cross (Croix de feu) and the French Popular Party (Parti populaire fran√ßais, PPF). The PSF was much larger, reaching as many as a million members, and grew increasingly conservative. The PPF was much smaller, with perhaps 50,000 members, and became more fascist. The chief impact for both movements was to bring together their enemies on the left and center into the Popular Front.Sean Kennedy, \\"The End of Immunity? Recent Work on the Far Right in Interwar France.\\" Historical Reflections/R√©flexions Historiques 34.2 (2008): 25-45. The Croix de Feu was originally an elite veterans' organization that Fran√ßois de La Rocque took over in 1929 and made a political movement. The Croix-de-Feu was dissolved in June 1936 by the Popular Front government, and de La Rocque quickly formed the new Parti social fran√ßais. Both organizations were authoritarian and conservative, hostile to democracy and devoted to the defence of property, the family, and the nation against the threat of decay or leftist revolution. The motto of PSF was \\"travail, famille, patrie\\" (\\"work, family, fatherland\\"). Its base was in urban areas, especially Paris, the industrial North, and Algeria. Most members were young (born after 1890) and middle-class, and it had few blue collar or farm workers. The PSF grew rapidly in the late 1930s, with more members than the communists and socialists combined. It reached out to include more workers and rural elements. De La Rocque was a charismatic leader but a poor politician with vague ideas. His movement opposed the far-right Vichy regime and its leaders were arrested and the PSF vanished. It was never invited to join a governing coalition. Whether or not it was \\"fascist\\" is debated by scholars. Many resemblances existed but not the key fascist promise of the creation of a revolutionary \\"new fascist man\\". Instead, its goal was to return to the past and to rely upon the old traditional values of Church and Army.Sean Kennedy, Reconciling France Against Democracy: The Croix-de-Feu and the Parti Social Fran√ßais, 1927-45 (2007).John Bingham, \\"Defining French fascism, finding fascists in France.\\" Canadian Journal of History 29.3 (1994): 525‚Äì544. Non-conformists of the 1930s The non-conformists of the 1930s were intellectuals seeking new solutions to face the political, economic and social crisis. The movement revolved around Emmanuel Mounier's personalism. They attempted to find a \\"third (communitarian) alternative\\" between socialism and capitalism and opposed both liberalism and fascism. Three main currents were active: *The review Esprit, founded in 1931 by Mounier and was the main mouthpiece of personalism. *The Ordre nouveau (New Order) group, created by Alexandre Marc and influenced by Robert Aron and Arnaud Dandieu's works. Jean Coutrot became during the Popular Front vice-president of the Committee of Scientific Organisation of Labour of the Minister Charles Spinasse and participated in the technical reunions of Ordre nouveau. *The Jeune Droite (\\"Young Right\\") gathered young intellectuals who had broken with the far-right Action Fran√ßaise, including Jean de Fabr√®gues, Jean-Pierre Maxence, Thierry Maulnier, and Maurice Blanchot. The young intellectuals (most were about 25 years old) all considered that France was confronted by a \\"civilisation crisis\\" and, despite their differences, opposed what Mounier called the \\"established disorder\\" (le d√©sordre √©tabli); he meant capitalism, individualism, economic liberalism and materialism. They aimed at creating the conditions of a \\"spiritual revolution\\" that would simultaneously transform Man and things. They called for a \\"New Order\\", which would be beyond individualism and collectivism and oriented towards a \\"federalist\\", \\"communautary and personalist\\" organisation of social relations.Hellman, Communitarian Third Way. The non-conformists were influenced both by socialism, in particular by Proudhonism and by Social Catholicism, which permeated Esprit and the Jeune Droite. They inherited from both currents a form of scepticism towards politics, which explains some stances towards anti-statism and renewed interest in social and economical transformations. The movement paid attention to civil society and distrusted the state. It favored \\"intermediate bodies\\", especially the family and the village. After the February 6, 1934 riots, the non-conformists split several ways. Bertrand de Jouvenel made the link between the non-conformists and the supporters of planisme, a new economical theory invented by the Belgian Henri de Man as well as with the technocratic Groupe X-Crise. They influenced both Vichy's R√©volution nationale and the Resistance (Combat, D√©fense de la France, Organisation civile et militaire etc.)Daniel Knegt, Fascism, Liberalism and Europeanism in the Political Thought of Bertrand de Jouvenel and Alfred Fabre-Luce (Amsterdam University Press, 2018.) Popular Front: 1936‚Äì1937 As the Great Depression finally hit France hard in 1932, the popular mood became hostile. A series of cabinets was wholly ineffective, and anger at the mounting unemployment caused xenophobia, borders being closed and a startling growth in anti-Semitism. Distrust of the entire political system grew rapidly, especially during the dramatic Stavisky Affair. a massive financial fraud that involving many deputies and top government officials. The promise of democracy seemed a failure in France and many other countries as they turned toward authoritarian rule, a trend that began by Lenin in Russia in 1918 and Mussolini in Italy in 1922 and continued in Spain, Portugal, Poland, the Baltic countries, the Balkans, Japan, Latin America and, most horrifying of all, by Hitler in Nazi Germany in January 1933. It now threatened France after the scandal's exposure brought huge mobs into the streets of Paris. All night on February 6 and 7, 1934,attacks took place against the police defending Parliament from physical assault, mostly by right-wing attackers. The police killed 15 demonstrators and halted their advance.Geoffrey Warner, \\"The Stavisky Affair and the Riots of February 6th 1934.\\" History Today (1958): 377‚Äì85. Journalist Alexander Werth argues: :At that time the Croix de Feu, the Royalists, the Solidarit√© and the Jeunesses Patriotes had no more than a few thousand active members between them, and that they would have been incapable of a real armed uprising. What they reckoned on was the support of the Paris public as a whole; and the most that they could reasonably have aimed at was the resignation of the Daladier Government. When this happened, on February 7, Colonel de la Rocque announced that 'the first objective had been attained.'Alexander Werth and D. W. Brogan, The Twilight of France, 1933-1940 (1942) p. 16 online PCF = Communists; SFIO = Socialists The 6 February outrage shocked centrists and leftists, which had been feuding ceaselessly for decades. On February 12 by a huge leftist counterdemonstration in which communist workers spontaneously joined with the Radical Socialists and Socialists against what seemed to them to be a serious fascist threat. Centrists and leftists slowly began to assemble an unprecedented three-way coalition, with socialists being the largest party, followed by the Radicals and then the French Communist Party. Stalin had recently ordered that all Communist parties to stop fighting the socialists and to combine an antifascist popular front, and it was carried out in France. The Communists supported the government but refused to take any cabinet seats.Joel Colton, L√©on Blum (1966) pp. 92‚Äì126. The 3 May 1936 French legislative election and confirmed the political upheaval. Conservative forces were decimated and socialist L√©on Blum, as leader of the largest coalition party, SFIO, became the prime minister. A massive wave of strikes occurred in which 2 million workers shut down French industry and paralyzed the forces of business and conservatism. That inspired the coalition government to hurriedly pass multiple packages of new programs designed for the benefit of the working-class.Colton, L√©on Blum (1966) pp. 160‚Äì97. The key provisions included immediate wage increases of 12 percent, general collective bargaining with unions, a 40-hour week, paid vacations, compulsory arbitration of labor disputes and the nationalisation of the Bank of France and some key munitions plants. The conservative opposition was dissolved, most notably the Croix des Feu, but it reorganised quickly as a political party. The left had assumed such reforms would liberate the workers and also the entire economy, but the economy did not respond well. Prices rose, and inflation negated the wage increases and hurt the middle class by sharply cutting into their savings accounts. Industrial production did not increase, and militant workers made sure that even if demand was very strong, factories which shut down after 40 hours. Unemployment remained high, the government deficit soared and the government was forced to devalue the franc. Blum had never been accustomed to working with coalition partners, and his coalition started coming apart until it completely collapsed in June 1937 after 380 days in office. While the working class praised and were always nostalgic about the Popular Front, the middle class was outraged and felt betrayed.Gordon Wright, France in Modern Times (1995) pp 360‚Äì369.Colton, L√©on Blum (1966) pp 126‚Äì273. Appeasement and war: 1938‚Äì1939 Appeasement was increasingly adopted as Germany grew stronger after 1933 since France suffered a stagnant economy, unrest in its colonies and bitter internal political fighting. Martin Thomas believed that appeasement was neither a coherent diplomatic strategy nor a copy of British policy.Martin Thomas, \\"Appeasement in the Late Third Republic,\\" Diplomacy and Statecraft 19#3 (2008): 566‚Äì607. France appeased Italy over Ethiopia for fear of an alliance between Italy and Germany.Reynolds M.

When Hitler sent troops into the Rhineland, an area of Germany in which no troops were allowed, neither Paris nor London risked war and so nothing was done.Stephen A. Schuker, \\"France and the Remilitarization of the Rhineland, 1936,\\" French Historical Studies 14.3 (1986): 299‚Äì338. The Blum government joined Britain in establishing an arms embargo during the Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì39). Blum rejected support for the Spanish Republicans because his opponents threatened to spread the civil war to the deeply-divided France. As the Republicans faltered in Spain, Blum secretly supplied the cause with arms, funds and sanctuaries. Financial support and military co-operation with Poland also occurred. The government nationalized arms suppliers and dramatically increased its program of rearming the French military in a last- minute catch up with the Germans.Larkin, France since the Popular Front, (1988) pp. 45‚Äì62 France sought peace, even in the face of Hitler's escalating demands, by appeasing Germany, in co-operation with Britain. √âdouard Daladier refused to go to war against Germany and Italy without British support when Neville Chamberlain tried to save peace by the Munich Agreement in 1938.Maurice Larkin, France since the Popular Front: Government and People, 1936‚Äì1986 (1988) pp 63-81 France's military alliance with Czechoslovakia was sacrificed at Hitler's demand when France and Britain agreed to his terms at Munich.Nicole Jordan, \\"L√©on Blum and Czechoslovakia, 1936‚Äì1938.\\" French History 5#1 (1991): 48‚Äì73.Martin Thomas, \\"France and the Czechoslovak crisis,\\" Diplomacy and Statecraft 10.23 (1999): 122‚Äì159. Overseas empire The interwar French Empire French census statistics from 1931 show an imperial population, outside of France itself, of 64.3 million people living on 11.9 million square kilometres. Of the total population, 39.1 million lived in Africa, 24.5 million lived in Asia and 700,000 lived in the Caribbeans or islands in the South Pacific. The largest colonies were Indochina with 21.5 million (in five separate colonies), Algeria with 6.6 million, Morocco with 5.4 million and West Africa with 14.6 million in nine colonies. The total included 1.9 million Europeans and 350,000 \\"assimilated\\" natives.Herbert Ingram Priestley, France overseas: a study of modern imperialism (1938) pp. 440‚Äì41. A hallmark of the French colonial project from the late 19th century until the Second World war was the civilising mission (mission civilisatrice). Its principle was that it was France's duty to bring civilisation to benighted peoples. As such, colonial officials undertook a policy of Franco- Europeanisation in French colonies, most notably French West Africa and Madagascar. Catholicism was a major factor in the civilising mission, and many missionaries were sent and often operated schools and hospitals.Elizabeth Foster, Faith in Empire: Religion, Politics, and Colonial Rule in French Senegal, 1880‚Äì1940 (2013) During the 19th century, French citizenship, along with the right to elect a deputy to the French Chamber of Deputies, was granted to the four old colonies of Guadeloupe, Martinique, Guyanne, and R√©union as well as to the residents of the \\"Four Communes\\" in Senegal. Typically, the elected deputies were white Frenchmen, but there were some blacks, such as the Senegalese Blaise Diagne, who was elected in 1914.Spencer Segalla, The Moroccan Soul: French Education, Colonial Ethnology, and Muslim Resistance, 1912‚Äì1956. 2009) Elsewhere, in the largest and most populous colonies, a strict separation between \\"sujets fran√ßais\\" (natives) and \\"citoyens fran√ßais\\" (males of European extraction), with different rights and duties, was maintained until 1946. French colonial law held that the granting of French citizenship to natives was a privilege, not a right. Two 1912 decrees dealing with French West Africa and French Equatorial Africa enumerated the conditions that a native had to meet to be granted French citizenship (they included speaking and writing French, earning a decent living and displaying good moral standards). For the 116 years from 1830 to 1946, only between 3000 and 6000 native Algerians were granted French citizenship. Well under 10 percent of the Algerian population was of European descent, and there were more Spanish and Italians than those who migrated from Metropolitan France. The Europeans controlled virtually the entire Algerian economy and political system, and few Muslims progressed out of poverty. In French West Africa, outside of the Four Communes, there were 2,500 \\"citoyens indig√®nes\\" out of a total population of 15 million. French conservatives had been denouncing the assimilationist policies as products of a dangerous liberal fantasy. In the Protectorate of Morocco, the French administration attempted to use urban planning and colonial education to prevent cultural mixing and to uphold the traditional society upon which the French depended for collaboration but with only mixed results. After the Second World War, the segregationist approach modeled in Morocco had been discredited by its connections to Vichyism, and assimilationism enjoyed a brief renaissance. Critics of French colonialism gained an international audience in the 1920s and often used documentary reportage and access to agencies such as the League of Nations and the International Labour Organization to make their protests heard. The main criticism was the high level of violence and suffering among the natives. Major critics included Albert Londres, F√©licien Challaye, and Paul Monet, whose books and articles were widely read.J.P.

She was featured on the cover of Life magazine's February 17, 1941, issue, and a nationally distributed newspaper columnist described her as a debutante who \\"fought a draw with Brenda Frazier for the glamour girl championship of New York society.\\"  Early years  Born in New York City, Wright was the daughter of stockbroker William May Wright and singer, actress, and newspaper columnist Cobina Wright Sr. The mother, born Elaine Cobb, created the unusual first name as a variation on her maiden name. Wright grew up in an environment with servants, a yacht, and more on a Long Island estate‚Äîall of which was wiped out by the Great Depression. The mother's plans for the daughter's future led to the parents' divorce, with the father describing as \\"prostitution\\" the mother's \\"grooming [of Cobina Jr.] for a film career capped by a spectacular marriage.\\" Wright was selected as Miss Manhattan in competition at the 1939 New York World's Fair, and in 1941, Life magazine described her as \\"a young New Yorker of excellent family but limited means ...\\"  Career  Although Wright's mother pushed her toward a career in entertainment, achieving success proved to be a challenge. In 1941, newspaper columnist Adela Rogers St. Johns wrote: \\"I believe that Cobina Wright Jr. had a tougher time getting where she is than almost any other girl in Hollywood. I believe that she faced tougher times and more obstacles and had less help than most girls ... everyone assumed that she had no talent.\\" That situation changed, however, after Wright began performing in vaudeville. By the time she began making films for 20th Century Fox, people were calling her \\"the good luck girl\\". Early in her career, Wright was a singer, initially performing in hotels because her mother would not let her sing in nightclubs. She appeared on Broadway in Lorelei (1938). By 1938, Wright had signed a film contract with 20th Century Fox. Her films included Small Town Deb (1941), Murder Among Friends (1941), Moon Over Miami (1941), Accent on Love (1941), Charlie Chan in Rio (1941), Week-End in Havana (1941), Right to the Heart (1942), Footlight Serenade (1942), and Something to Shout About (1943). Caricature on radio The second season of The Pepsodent Show, an NBC radio program that starred Bob Hope, introduced two female characters, Brenda and Cobina. Richard Zoglin, in his book Hope: Entertainer of the Century, described the pair as \\"two shrill- voiced, man-hungry society girls ... the first incarnation of a favorite Hope comedy foil: the homely, sex-starved spinster, obsessed with landing a man.\\" The characters were parodies of Wright and her friend, debutante Brenda Frazier. Wright took offense and sued, resulting in the dropping of the characters from the program. Lawrence J. Quirk, in his book Bob Hope: The Road Well Traveled, commented, \\"The irony in this was that Hope had only chosen the names of Frazier and Wright because in reality they were cultured beauties‚Äîthe exact opposites of the Brenda and Cobina on the show. In a way, it was a reverse compliment ...\\" Afterward, Wright became \\"a regular guest\\" on the program.  Personal life  In 1938, Wright was romantically linked with Prince Philip of Greece, who later married Elizabeth II of England. The two met in Venice in the year they both turned 17 and enjoyed activities together there for three weeks, after which they spent a week in England \\"dining, dancing, and walking London‚Äôs streets, hand in hand.\\" In November 1941, Wright married Palmer Beaudette, who came from \\"a wealthy automobile family\\" in Michigan. Two years later, she left show business to devote her time to raising a family. Beaudette died in 1968. By that time, Wright had become an alcoholic‚Äîa condition that was aggravated when she found that \\"she was left all but penniless\\" because Beaudette's part of his father's estate reverted to his family after his death. Over time, she dealt successfully with her alcoholism and did volunteer work to help others who were recovering from it. Her efforts included serving on the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence. Death Wright died on September 1, 2011, at age 90.

Early life and family Born near Doncaster, Yorkshire, Sanderson was the son of Thomas Anderson of Armthorpe and Sarah n√©e Cromack, daughter of John Cromack. In 1833, he married Charlotte Matilda Manners-Sutton, daughter of Charles Manners-Sutton, 1st Viscount Canterbury, and they had at least 10 children ‚Äî six sons, and four daughters, including: * Richard Manners Sanderson (1835‚Äì1885) * Thomas Sanderson, 1st Baron Sanderson (1841‚Äì1923) * Percy Sanderson (1842-1919) * Charlotte Louisa Gertrude Sanderson (1843-1929) * Algernon Robert Sanderson (1844‚Äì1863) * Lucy Fanny Mary Sanderson (c1846-1932) * Edward Manners Sanderson (1847-1932) * Matilda Amy Frances Sanderson (c1852-1931) Business career Early in his adult life, Sanderson became a clerk in London bill-broking firm Richardson, Overend, and Company, where the quaker Samuel Gurney was a partner‚Äîwhich some historians suggest means Sanderson may also have a quaker upbringing. By 1827, Sanderson was operating as a bill broker but at his own business, dominating the London market in the later years of that decade alongside Gurney's business, then renamed Overend, Gurney and Company‚Äîboth at Lombard Street in London. In 1837, Sanderson moved his business to King William Street, London; in 1847, that business then had to suspend payment, before being able to trade again in early 1848. Just two weeks after his death in 1857, the business‚Äîthen known as Sanderson, Sandeman and Company‚Äîfailed with debts of ¬£5,299,006. Member of parliament Sanderson first became Member of Parliament (MP) for Colchester at a by- election in 1829‚Äîheld due to the resignation of Sir George Smyth, 6th Baronet. Having cultivated anti-Catholic and Tory relationships, he was put forward by the Colchester corporation to replace Smyth, a fellow Tory. A \\"token challenge\\" was put forward to counter Sanderson's bid for the seat, but he won the seat, declaring a desire to promote \\"the education of the poor\\" and to \\"put an end to the traffic in human blood\\". Having taken his seat on 28 April 1829, one of his first votes was to block the Radical (MP) Daniel O'Connell from taking his seat in the House of Commons at Clare without taking the Oath of Supremacy. At a dinner in July of the same year, he lamented that \\"nothing of great importance\\" had taken place in the House, but he was prepared to \\"stand forward in support of those principles which he had publicly avowed\\". In 1830, he voted with the government against transferring the electorate of East Retford into the soon-to-be-created constituency of Birmingham; against enfranchising Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester; and against Lord Blandford's parliamentary reform scheme. Despite this, he is not recorded as having spoken during this period, although he petitioned for the abolition of the death penalty for forgery, then voting in that manner in June 1830. As the 1830 general election approached, Sanderson sought to retain the seat but was forced to pull out at a late stage when his agent was spotted in an act of bribery. At the general election a year later, he again sought to represent the seat, gaining corporation backing, in a bid to prevent the return of reformers. Yet his canvassing was received poorly, with an angry mob forcing his carriage into a pond. Nevertheless, he attended the hustings, promising to accept \\"the necessity of parliamentary reform\\", an extension of the franchise to \\"large and populous places\\", but still rejected the need to disenfranchise other seats. Regardless, Sanderson polled third and was not elected. However, Sanderson returned to the seat a year later, at the 1832 general election, securing the most votes, and held it for another 15 years until 1847, when he was ranked third in the poll, losing the election. Within this period, he opposed the Maynooth Grant and repealing the Corn Laws, and married the Commons Speaker's daughter. Death Sanderson died in 1857 at Hazlewood in Hertfordshire leaving, via his will, ¬£3,000 to his wife, Charlotte, and dividing the rest of his property among his children.

It was there where the previously \\"unknown\\" original Russian band music by V. Barsegian and Vladimir Malgin was introduced. Nine years later, at , HMNB Portsmouth, the Royal Marines Band performed a Russian music program under the baton of Commander Karabanov. In 2007, in recognition of his service and talent, the Ministry of Defense promoted Karabanov to the post of Artistic Director and commanding officer of the Central Navy Band of Russia, which is the highest musical position in the Russian Navy.

In 1971, with her colleague Paul Murdin, she identified the powerful X-ray source Cygnus X-1 as the first clear candidate for a black hole. Career She attended the University of Adelaide and continued studies as one of the first students at the graduate school of Mount Stromlo Observatory, outside Canberra where she was strongly influenced by the American astronomers Bart Bok and Priscilla Fairfield Bok. She gained a Ph.D. in 1967 on the subject of southern planetary nebulae while working with the Swedish astronomer Bengt Westerlund. She moved to the University of Wisconsin before taking up a position at the Royal Greenwich Observatory at Herstmonceux Castle, firstly as a Scientific Officer then Principal Scientific Officer. She worked with Richard Woolley, the Astronomer Royal, and then Paul Murdin, with whom she had been elected to the Royal Astronomical Society at the same time in 1963. Turtle and Murdin were careful about the language of the paper they submitted to the journal Nature describing their discovery, titled Cygnus X-1 ‚Äî a Spectroscopic Binary with a Heavy Companion? with the final words, \\"...it might be a black hole.\\" Their boss, Woolley, was more conservative as an astronomer and their cautiousness was mirrored by work colleagues, though other astronomers (notably Charles Thomas Bolton) agreed with them. Her work in Sussex led directly to a posting at the South African Astronomical Observatory, where Woolley became director from 1972, and then the new 3.9-metre Anglo-Australian Telescope in a commissioning role before becoming staff astronomer there. In 1978, she found her final employment at University of New South Wales in the Physics faculty; in November that year she married Tony Turtle. While at the University, she was the driving force for the Automated Patrol Telescope at the Siding Spring Observatory, introduced a fourth-year course for astronomers, served on or chaired many committees and promoted astronomy very actively through the International Astronomical Union and the Astronomical Society of Australia. She died after a long illness at her home in Paddington, Sydney. Legacy The Bok Prize, awarded annually to undergraduates for excellence in research, was introduced largely at Turtle's instigation, and is sponsored by Astronomical Society of Australia and the Australian Academy of Science.

It was the final resting place for many of Portsmouth's prominent residents including the Wentworth family, the Vaughan family, the Rogers, and the Lears. It is the oldest known surviving cemetery in Portsmouth, and one of the oldest in the state. It has about 125 gravestones. Previously neglected, it is now well maintained by the Mayor's Committee and the city. The cemetery plot was on a point of land that directly overlooked the Piscataqua River in earlier times. History John Jackson headstone Captain John Pickering II agreed to let the town have half an acre \\"upon the neck of land on which he liveth, where the people have been wont to be buried, which land shall be impropriated forever unto the use of a burying place.\\" The earliest legible gravestone is dated 1684. There are ghost stories related about the cemetery. Putative hauntings are part of tourist appeal. It is believed that the area was used as a cemetery prior to its formal dedication. However, because Pickering retained use of the site for cattle grazing, many earlier stones were destroyed or damaged. The cemetery has many fine examples of gravestone carvings by talented and noted New England carvers. Because of its extended use, there are many examples illustrating the fashionable evolution of headstone symbolism, iconography, imagery and monumental inscription. Elizabeth Elatson (d. 1704‚Äì05), a house fire victim, is buried there. The report in The Boston News- Letter was the first published account of a house fire in America. It is one of six cemeteries owned and maintained by the City of Portsmouth, which is working under a comprehensive maintenance and restoration program. It is supported via the Historic Cemeteries Trust Fund. Location It is located on the south side of Mechanic Street opposite Prescott Park, between Marcy Street and the Peirce Island Bridge. The area around it was once a center of coastal trade and warehouses. Tours of the graveyard are offered by local author Roxie Zwicker. Yankee Magazine named it to the top five \\"best cemetery tours in New England\\" in 2017.

An active member of the Danish Women's Society, she was frequently invited to preach at the organization's events. As a result of legislation introduced by the Church Minister Carl Hermansen in 1947, the following year, together with Johanne Andersen and Edith Brenneche Petersen, she was ordained by Bishop Hans √òllgaard in Odense Cathedral. Denmark thus became the first country in the world to have women priests. Vermehren then served as a priest in Copenhagen's Women's Prison until she retired in 1964. Biography Born on 27 October 1894 in Copenhagen, Ruth Vermehren was the daughter of the painter Gustav Vermehren (1863‚Äì1931) and Louise Borchsenius (1862‚Äì1954). She was brought up in a cultural environment. Her father was an artist and her grandfather was the celebrated portrait painter Frederik Vermehren. From an early age, she was interested in religion, deciding to become a priest when she was preparing to be confirmed. After matriculating form N. Zahle's School in 1914, she began to study theology but soon had to abandon her studies for lack of funds. After working for a time as a secretary in Denmark's Christian Association (Danmarks Kristelige Studenterforbund), she returned to her studies in 1923, qualifying in 1927. She devoted her future to the prisoners in Copenhagen's women's jails, initially without pay but from 1929 acting as a paid substitute for the priest when he was on holiday. She held services in the prison church but was unable to conduct communion. From 1921, backed by women's organizations, she campaigned for women's ordination but to no avail. She frequently preached at the events arranged by the Danish Women's Society. In 1944, 16 female theologians called on the Danish bishops to allow Vermehren to be ordained. After an initial refusal, in 1947 the Church Minister Carl Hermansen put forward legislation authorizing women to become priests. In 1948, Vermehren was ordained by the bishop of Funen, Hans √òllgaard, together with Johanne Andersen and Edith Brenneche Petersen. Thereafter she worked as the resident priest in Copenhagen's Women's Prison from 1949 to 1964. On her retirement, she was honoured with the Order of the Dannebrog. Ruth Vermehren died in Copenhagen on 6 May 1983. She is buried in Hellerup Cemetery.

The ministers ceased to be separate officials, responsible to the emperor, each only for their actions and orders. Earlier, in 1861, there was a body with the same name, chaired by the emperor, along with the Committee of Ministers.

Informally, the Council began to function since October 1857, and its first meeting was held on December 31, 1857. The Council of Ministers was established for the \\"exclusive consideration in the Supreme presence of His Majesty\\" of cases requiring \\"general consideration,\\" that is, belonging to several branches of government at the same time. The Council of Ministers consisted of ministers and equivalent to them the chief administrative departments, the chairman of the State Council and the chairman of the Committee of Ministers, as well as other senior officials for the special purpose of the emperor. The Council was chaired by the emperor himself, who could introduce any questions for his consideration. All affairs were reported to the Council by the ministers by affiliation, and the clerical work was entrusted to the business manager of the Committee of Ministers. The Council of Ministers did not have its own office. At all meetings of the Council, the Secretary of State was present to present information on legislative matters from the affairs of the State Council. Meetings of the Council of Ministers were not regular and were appointed each time by the emperor. The Council considered: ‚Äútypes and assumptions for the design and improvement of various parts entrusted to each Ministry and General Directorate‚Äù, ‚Äúinformation on the progress of work on the design and improvement ...‚Äù, initial legislative assumptions followed by submission to the State Council, measures , requiring the general assistance of different departments, but not subject to consideration in other higher state institutions, information about the most important orders for each department, requiring ‚Äúcommon co expressions \\", the conclusions of the commissions created by the Emperor for the consideration of reports of ministries and main departments. Since 1863, the number of cases submitted to the Council has sharply decreased, it gathered less and less, and after December 23, 1882, the meetings stopped altogether.\\"The Boris Yeltsin Presidential Library\\": 150 years ago the Council of Ministers was established in Russia Second period November 1, 1905 in accordance with the decree of Nicholas II \\"On measures to strengthen unity in the activities of ministries and main departments\\", the activities of the Council of Ministers were resumed. All ministries and main administrations were declared parts of the unified state administration. The creation of the Council of Ministers in 1857‚Äì1861 did not lead to the emergence of a governing body capable of eliminating fragmentation and inconsistency in the actions of ministers and to ensure at least a relative unity of the activities of central government institutions. Since all power was concentrated in the hands of the Emperor, matters were decided mainly through the submission at the highest discretion of reports generally objectively incompatible with the principle of collegiality in management. In 1905, in connection with the formation of the State Duma, the Council of Ministers was transformed. The reformed Council was entrusted with \\"directing and combining the actions of the chief heads of departments in subjects, both legislation and higher state administration\\". The Council included the ministers of internal affairs, finance, justice, commerce and industry, means of communication, public education, military, maritime, imperial court and inheritances, foreign affairs, chief governor of land management and agriculture, the state controller and the chief procurator of the Synod. The heads of other departments participated in the meetings of the Council only in the consideration of cases directly related to the competence of their departments. The chairman of the Council of Ministers was not the emperor himself, as was previously the case, but the person appointed by him from among the ministers. The office work of the Council of Ministers was conducted by its permanent office (in the 19th century, the office of the Council of Ministers was led by the office of the Committee of Ministers), headed by the head of the Council's affairs. Meetings of the Council began to be held regularly, several times a week and recorded in special journals. The terms of reference of the Council of Ministers included: the direction of legislative work and preliminary consideration of the assumptions of ministries, departments, special meetings, committees and commissions on legislative issues submitted to the State Duma and the State Council, discussion of the ministerial proposals on the general ministerial structure and on the replacement of the main posts of higher and local government, consideration by the special orders of the emperor of affairs of state defense and foreign policy, as well as cases of the Ministry of the Imperial Court and the inheritance. In addition, the Council of Ministers had significant rights in the field of state budget and credit. No general measure of control could be taken by the heads of departments other than the Council of Ministers, but the affairs of the state defense and foreign policy, as well as the affairs of the Ministry of the Imperial Court and the inheritances were removed from the Council‚Äôs jurisdiction ‚Äì they were submitted to the Council of Ministers only for special reasons. the orders of the emperor or the heads of these departments. Outside the competence of the Council of Ministers was also the auditing activities of the State Audit Office, the Office of His Imperial Majesty, and the Office of His Own Imperial Majesty's for the institutions of Empress Mary. In connection with the abolition of the Committee of Ministers in 1906, most of the functions left to the Committee passed to the Council of Ministers (introduction, extension and termination of the provisions on enhanced and emergency protection, designation of localities for the placement of exiles, strengthening the staff of the gendarmerie, the police, supervision of urban and local government, the establishment of companies, etc.). Later, in 1909, the so-called Small Council of Ministers was formed to consider these ‚Äúcommittee cases‚Äù. The Council of Ministers ceased operations on March 12, 1917 during the February Revolution. The functions of the Council of Ministers as the highest body of government passed to the Provisional Government, which was formed on March 15, 1917. It is worth noting that, along with the abdication of the throne, Emperor Nicholas II signed a decree appointing George Lvov Chairman of the Council of Ministers (March 15, 1917), but the Provisional Government in its declaration indicated that power was taken from the Provisional Committee of the State Duma, leaving the decree of Nicholas without attention.\\"The Boris Yeltsin Presidential Library\\": Council of Ministers of the Russian Empire Reformed References Sources ;Sources *Hard Days (Secret Meetings of the Council of Ministers July 16 ‚Äì September 2, 1915) // Archive of the Russian Revolution. ‚Äì Berlin, 1926. *Paul Ignatieff.

He clearly thought a lot of his efforts in Portugal as he had the activity recorded alongside his personal campaign history.

Currently under construction, it is set to become the world's tallest statue of the Virgin Mary at . History The construction of a statue of the Virgin Mary and pilgrimage site at the Montemaria development in Batangas City was originally planned and pursued by the Mary Mother of the Poor Foundation (MMP) led by Catholic priest Fernando Suarez. Suarez got the idea of developing a pilgrimage site from Hermilando Mandanas, a local politician and acquaintance whom he met in 2006, where the priest could perform his faith healing work. Mandanas' company, Abacore Capital Holdings, Inc., donated the five-hectare land in Barangay Pagkilatan where the statue and the proposed pilgrimage site would stand, which would later be called Montemaria. Initially progress for the project was made in 2009 after Suarez's foundation was able to raise . But in the following year, the project was later put on hold after Suarez moved to Cavite, where San Miguel Corporation offered him a 33-hectare land in the town of Alfonso where he could set up a bigger pilgrimage site. Cited as the one responsible for building a statue of the Virgin Mary at Montemaria, Mandanas continued to project and established the Montemaria Asia Pilgrims Inc. (MAPI) to help him manage the project's development. The property where the statue would stand was later set for donation to MAPI but such plans were canceled and the land was donated to the Archdiocese of Lipa instead. At the time, the statue which had its face and hands already complete, became known as the \\"Mary Mother of All Asia\\". Construction work for the statue began in 2014 and is expected to be completed in 2021 marking the 500th anniversary of the introduction of Christianity in the Philippines. Design The Mother of All Asia statue was designed by sculptor Eduardo Castrillo and is made of concrete and steel.

It is located in the Sillery district () of the Sainte-Foy- Sillery-Cap-Rouge borough () of Quebec City, Quebec, Canada. The cemetery was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 2007. The impetus for the creation of the cemetery was the need for the provision of an Anglican burying ground for Quebec City's primarily English language speaking, Anglican community, in the mid‚Äì1800s. The cemetery is located at the corner of Saint- Louis Road () and c√¥te de Sillery (formerly c√¥te de l'√âglise), on of land overlooking the Saint Lawrence River, in the southeastern direction. More than people are buried at Mount Hermon. Mount Hermon Cemetery draws distinction as being the first garden cemetery () established in Canada. Mount Hermon, and other garden cemeteries formed in North America, took inspiration from cimeti√®re du P√®re-Lachaise of Paris. A memorial was dedicated to the victims of the sinking of the shipwrecked Empress of Ireland, in 1914, and other memorials were erected at later dates on the cemetery's grounds. The major loss of lives aboard the shipwrecked Empress of Ireland had significant impact upon Mount Hermon, along with its neighboring cemetery on chemin Saint-Louis: Saint-Patrick's Cemetery, which also relocated from the city of Quebec, in 1879. Both of the cemeteries took on responsibility for a significant amount of the ship's passengers whom perished aboard or at sea. Separately, on the Mount Hermon grounds is the Treggett Bell, which was presented in gratitude to the Treggett family, who had members from four different generations of its family serve as Mount Hermon's Superintendents, encompassing the years 1865‚Äì2014. In addition, the cemetery contains sections dedicated for individuals of Greek (), Chinese (), and Cambodian () descent. The main entrance is accessed at 1801 Saint-Louis Road, at the northern end of the cemetery. There is a pedestrian entrance located at the southwestern portion of the cemetery, accessed at the northern terminus of avenue des Voiliers, one-block east of c√¥te de Sillery. The cemetery grounds contain both paved and gravel roads.  Origins  Albumen print of entrance, October 1858‚Äì1880, by Samuel McLaughlin. In the spring of 1847, a group of Protestant businessmen, shipbuilders, merchants, and clergy convened a public meeting to determine the possibility of buying land for a rural cemetery. Quebec City's original Anglican cemetery, located adjacent to Saint Matthew's Church on Saint John Street () had reached its capacity and city officials requested that a new Protestant cemetery be established outside of the city limits. With aid from the lumber merchant John Gilmour, a prominent member of the local Protestant community, as well as a member of first municipal council of Sillery, the Quebec Protestant Cemetery Association was formed on February 11, 1848. Its first president was George O'Kill Stuart, Jr., and its main objective was to collect the funds necessary to purchase land and establish a cemetery on it. Other founding members included the philanthropist Jeffery Hale and the physician Dr. James Douglas, the later whom served as a member of the cemetery's first board of directors in 1848. On June 14, 1848, Christopher Ferguson, 42-years of age, who was the master of the brig Transit, died of erysipelas. He became the first person to be buried in the nascent cemetery and the first person to be recorded in the cemetery's burial register. The only other details recorded were that he was a member of the Church of England and that the officiating clergyman was the Rev. J. Cornwall. The legislation (12 Vict., chap. 191) which legally incorporated the new cemetery was adopted by the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada on May 30, 1849. It was at that time that the new cemetery was officially given the name of Mount Hermon. The membership of the association's first board of directors was noted for being an example of ecumenical cooperation in the overwhelmingly Roman Catholic majority city and province of Quebec. Between June 1848 and December 1883, out of burials, close to half of the decedents were members of the Anglican Church (), followed by members of the Presbyterian Church (), and the Methodist Church (583).  Cemetery design  \\"Design for proposed entrance lodge and gates for the grounds of the Quebec Cemetery,\\" Edward Staveley, September 6, 1848, Quebec City An American civil and military engineer, David Bates Douglass, designed the layout of Mount Hermon, in 1848. Douglass, who garnered acclamations for his 1838‚Äì1839 design of Green-Wood Cemetery, as a landscape of \\"bucolic serenity\\" in Brooklyn, New York, modeled both Albany Rural Cemetery (1845‚Äî1846), located on the outskirts of Albany, New York, and Mount Hermon Cemetery, after Green-Wood. All three of Douglass' cemeteries were designed from the philosophical perspective of the architect Sir Christopher Wren, who in the year 1711, began to argue for cemeteries to be located in pastoral settings, away from crowded and disease-plagued cities. The three David Bates Douglass designed garden cemetery landscapes all have achieved historic and cultural landmark statuses: in addition to Mount Hermon's designation as a National Historic Site of Canada, his Green-Wood Cemetery was designated a United States National Historic Landmark in 2006, and his Albany Rural Cemetery was placed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Quebec City architect Edward Staveley (1795‚Äì1872) designed the cemetery's Gothic Revival entrance lodge and gates in a set of plans which were signed and dated on September 6, 1848, in the city of Quebec. On August 24, 1849, Staveley completed a design plan for a burial vault at Mount Hermon for the family of the Hon. Henry Black. At the time of its establishment, Mount Hermon was the first cemetery to be located in a rural area, outside of Quebec City's legal jurisdiction, in addition to being Canada's first garden cemetery. On July 10, 1859, the Roman Catholic Notre- Dame-de-Belmont Cemetery (), located in the adjacent, historic area of Sainte- Foy, was blessed and its first burial took place two days later. This was the second garden cemetery to be created in a rural environment outside of the city limits of Quebec.  Historic recognition and status  \\"Park-like space for public use\\" On June 8, 2007, Mount Hermon Cemetery was officially recognized as a National Historic Site of Canada. Additionally, the cemetery is located on the Sillery Heritage Site, which was designated as a historic district in 1964. On April 24, 2009, Parks Canada listed Mount Hermon Cemetery on the Canadian Register of Historic Places (Canada's Historic Places), which it administers. Amongst other attributes, the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada noted the heritage value of the blending of art with nature, including Celtic crosses, neoclassical monuments, obelisks, globes, and the cemetery's Gothic-Revival style lodge, all in a layout that was \\"park-like space for public use.\\" The site's multitude of tree species, winding pathways, and prominent viewpoints of the Saint Lawrence River were noted, as well. In 2011, the Mount Hermon Cemetery Association undertook restoration work to the outside of the cemetery's entrance lodge, which contains the Superintendent's office and residence. The work included the replacement of the lodge's asphalt shingle roof with a cedar shingle one and the addition of a wood staircase for a secondary entrance, as well as restorative measures performed on the cemetery's mass grave () for the anonymous victims from the Empress of Ireland. On November 5, 2015, the remains of 204 unknown people, originally buried at the Saint Matthew's Church graveyard on Saint John Street in Quebec City, were interred at Mount Hermon Cemetery. The skeletal remains were discovered by city archeologists while performing restoration work at the former location, during 1999‚Äì2000. The 204 individuals were buried at Saint Matthew‚Äôs between 1772 and 1860. A ceremony was held at Mount Hermon on September 8, 2016, to mark the 150th anniversary of Jeffery Hale Hospital (). At the ceremony, new engravings on the Hale family monument, along with a bench, were unveiled.  War graves  The War Graves Photographic Project, a volunteer initiative which has recorded the graves or memorial listings of every Commonwealth service member death since World War I, has indexed the details regarding 170 servicemembers buried at Mount Hermon, including photographs of their headstones. Hard or digital copies of the photographs may be requested from the non-profit organization, along with a donation. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission identified 68 individuals buried at Mount Hermon Cemetery whom it determined were casualties from World Wars I and II. Of those burials, 49 are of servicemembers whom were killed in active duty during the first World War; 14 from WWII, one of whom is an unidentified Canadian airman. In addition, there are three American war graves, as well as one interned Austrian civilian's grave. The Commonwealth burials located in Section G are buried in Plot 1368.

The small Terramone depression, situated between the Cappelle dei Marsi and Magliano de' Marsi territories, is part of the area. The plateau is mostly for agricultural use.  Origin of the name  The origin of the name is not clear. According to one hypothesis, it would be related to Pales, a deity of Roman mythology, protecting shepherds, flocks and livestock. In ancient times the plains were also called \\"Valentine Camps\\" ()..  History  Thanks to numerous archaeological finds, it was ascertained that, in the Roman age, after the foundation of the colony of Alba Fucens, the whole area underwent a centuriation and the various pieces of land that had been so delimited were granted to Latin settlers. A few years after the first draining of Fucino operated by Emperor Claudius, through the building of the tunnels of the same name between 41 and 52 AD, the Palentine Plains were provided with an aqueduct to serve country villas and facilitate farming activities.  Battle of Tagliacozzo  In 1268 the Battle of Tagliacozzo was fought in this location, which saw Conradin of Hohenstaufen's defeat, causing the fall of the House of Swabia from the Sicilian throne and Charles I of Anjou's supremacy in the Italian territory.

Pestonjee Bomanjee (1851‚Äì1938) was a painter trained in the academic realist style of the Bombay School of Art. Biography Bomanji was educated at Elphinstone High School, Bombay. He joined the newly opened J. J. School of Art, Mumbai when he was only thirteen, and studied under the principal John Griffiths. Initially, he wanted to be a sculptor and trained under John Lockwood Kipling. In 1872, Griffiths appointed him as a draughtsman on the team sent by the School to copy the paintings at the Ajanta Caves. He headed the team in 1880.. In 1894, he became one of the first Indian teachers at the J.J. School and later also served briefly as its first Indian vice-principal. A brief apprenticeship under the painter Valentine Cameron Prinsep in 1877 drew him towards portraiture. He established a successful practice portraying members of the wealthy Parsi community to which he belonged. His approach was realistic and unglamourized. Described as 'realistic and warty' by the Times of India, his portraits and other paintings were also compared to the work of Dutch realists. Bomanji's Parsi heritage is reflected in the depictions of daily and religious life seen in works such as Feeding the Parrot and The Parsi Fire Ceremony. He exhibited at shows around the country. His Parsi Tiger Slayer was deemed the best work by a 'native artist' at the 1889 exhibition of the Bombay Art Society. He won the Governor's Gold Medal at Chennai, Pune and Kolkata, as well as a cash prize of Rs 500 at the 1883 International Exhibition at Kolkata for his Parsi Lady Sewing.

Smith purchased his freedom for $50 in 1818.  Business endeavors  After purchasing his freedom Smith had big plans ahead of him and in the same year of 1816 Smith opened up his own Lumber business in Columbia, Pennsylvania.

Opened in 1888 and run by the city council, it provides a venue for association football and bowls as well as a children's play area and landscaped areas for walking. The park is home to the Peace Tree, an oak planted in 1919 to commemorate the end of the First World War, which was voted Northern Ireland's Tree of the Year for 2015. The European War Memorial honouring those from all sides killed during the First World War was unveiled in the park in 2014.  Description  The park lies in the Woodvale district of Belfast adjacent to Woodvale Road and Ballygomartin Road. The park is a current holder of a Green Flag Award. Woodvale park has full size association football pitches, 7-a-side football pitches, a bowls green and pavilion, a children's playground, a toddlers play area, an outdoor exercise area, a community garden and allotments. Its landscape features a bandstand, landscaped flower beds and shrubberies. It has several trails said to be popular with walkers. The park opens at 7.30 a.m. each day and some of the grounds are lit.  History  The park was originally the site of Woodvale House, which was located in southern portion of the grounds adjacent to Woodvale Road. The house and grounds were sold to the Belfast Corporation by Reverend Glover in 1888. The corporation planned to open the park to the public under the name \\"Shankhill Park\\", but this was changed to \\"Woodvale Park\\" shortly before it opened. The park opened to the public on 18 August 1888. It was scheduled to be opened by local dignitaries at 3pm. There was a delay in the representatives arriving and at 3.35pm a park ranger unlocked the gates and opened the park to a large waiting crowd. The park originally featured a pond that was used for ice skating in the winter. This was filled in at some point after the Second World War and the children's play area constructed on the site. The park underwent a ¬£2 million refurbishment that was completed in August 2013. A formal reopening was to have been carried out by the Sinn F√©in Lord Mayor of Belfast M√°irt√≠n √ì Muilleoir. During the ceremony he came under attack by loyalist members of the crowd. √ì Muilleoir sought refuge in a nearby shed and remained there for 20 minutes whilst his police escort organised an escape. Three men later appeared in court charged with disorder over the incident. The park's bandstand was granted protection as a listed structure in March 2016. That October a statue was unveiled in the park to commemorate Shankill's contribution to boxing history. In 2017 the council, in conjunction with the Northern Ireland Housing Executive opened elf-themed children's trails within the park. An accompanying puzzle booklet was also produced. In July 2018 the park hosted the first Woodvale Festival, a free event featuring pop music, fairground amusements and traditional local dancing and music. In September 2018 a sculpted metal bench was placed in the park as a memorial to those lost to suicide and to encourage people to talk about their mental health.  War memorial  An oak tree (Quercus robur), known as the Peace Tree, was planted in the park on Empire Day 1919 to remember those killed during the First World War. It became a focal point for veterans in the local area. A similar tree was planted at the same time in Falls Park but died of natural causes. Discussions have taken place recently between local politicians with a view to replacing the tree. The Woodvale Park tree was later forgotten until its rediscovery during preparations for the 90th anniversary of start of the Battle of the Somme in 2006. At this time the original railing around the tree, which had been lost, was replaced. The tree and its planting ceremony are recounted in Robert Scott's work A Breath of Fresh Air, The Story of Belfast Parks. The Peace Tree was voted Northern Ireland's Tree of the Year for 2015. It was nominated for the European Tree of the Year competition of 2016 and came 13th out of 15 trees with 628 votes. A memorial for the First World War was unveiled in the park in October 2014, near to the Peace Tree. Known as the European War Memorial, it commemorates the dead from all sides, including Germany, and was said to be unique in this respect. The memorial is a 6.5 tonne chunk of granite cut with six sides to resemble a stone from Giant's Causeway. The unveiling ceremony was conducted by the Lord Lieutenant of Belfast, Fionnuala Jay-O'Boyle and was attended by senior unionist politicians.

This project aims at solving the mystery of their origin and the early stages of the universe itself. The proposal, formulated by an international group of researchers, calls for an array of 200,000 receivers to be placed on mountain ranges around the world. Overview The GRAND detector would search for neutrinos, exotic particles emitted by some and the black holes in the center of galaxies. These neutrinos could help astronomers find the source of other energetic particles called ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. When neutrinos reach Earth, they often collide with particles either in the air or on the ground, creating showers of secondary particles. These secondary particles can be picked up by the radio antennas, which lets researchers calculate the trajectory of the initial neutrinos and trace them back to their source. The concept was first published in 2017. The giant radio detector array would comprise 200,000 low-cost antennas in groups of 10,000 spread out over nearly 200,000 km2 (80,000 square miles) at different locations around the world. This would make it the largest detector in the world. Construction, installation and networking the 200,000 antennae, would cost approximately $226 million, excluding the price for renting the land and manpower.GRAND - Home site: FAQ. Principle The strategy of GRAND is to detect the radio emission coming from particle showers that develop in the terrestrial atmosphere as a result of the interaction of ultra-high energy (UHE) cosmic rays, gamma rays, and neutrinos. Astrophysical tau neutrinos () can be detected through extensive air showers (EAS) induced by tau () decays in the atmosphere. The short-lived tau decays in the atmosphere generates an EAS that emits measurable electromagnetic emissions up to frequencies of hundreds of MHz. The antennae are foreseen to operate in the 60-200 MHz band to avoid the short-wave background noise at lower frequencies. Each individual antenna is a simple Bow-tie design, featuring 3 perpendicular bows with an additional vertical arm to sample all three polarization directions. Each antenna is mounted on a single 5-meter-tall pole, and each antenna in the grid is spaced at 1 km within a square grid. If the full array of 200,000 antennae is build, GRAND would reach an all-flavor sensitivity of 4 x10‚àí10 GeV cm‚àí2 s‚àí1 sr‚àí1 above 5 x1017 eV. Because of its sub-degree angular resolution, GRAND will also search for point sources of UHE neutrinos, steady and transient, potentially starting UHE neutrino astronomy, allowing for the discovery and follow-up of large numbers of radio transients, fast radio bursts, giant radio pulses, and for precise studies of the epoch of reionization. The researchers estimate that GRAND could allow not just the detection of neutrinos, but could also allow a differentiation of the source types, such as galaxy clusters with central sources, fast-spinning newborn pulsars, active galactic nuclei, and afterglows of gamma-ray bursts. Status Simulation and experimental work is ongoing on technological development and background rejection strategies. Phase one is called GRANDProto35, that includes 35 antennas and 24 scintillators, deployed in the Tian Shan mountains in China. If a pulse is observed simultaneously in the signals from three or more scintillators, the signals are recorded. As of October 2018, GRANDProto35 is in commissioning phase. So far, the system achieves 100% detection efficiency for trigger rates up to 20 kHz. The following step is planned for 2020, and its is a dedicated setup called GRANDProto300 within an area of 300 km2. The baseline layout is a square grid with a 1 km inter-antenna spacing, just as for later stages. Because GRANDProto300 will not be large enough to detect cosmogenic neutrinos, the viability will be tested using instead extensive air showers initiated by very inclined cosmic rays, thus providing an opportunity to do cosmic-ray science. The site would be hosted at the Chinese provinces of XinJiang, Inner Mongolia, Yunnan, and Gansu. If funded, the later phases would build GRAND10k in 2025, and finally GRAND200k (200,000 receivers) in the 2030s.

She was the founder of the and wrote numerous books and articles on reading and writing didactics, pedagogy, educational policy, and children's stories. Biography Marta Mata's connection with the world of education originated with her mother, √Ängels Garriga, who was a pedagogue, teacher, and writer trained in the Summer Schools before the Civil War, and in the Commonwealth of Catalonia, with Pompeu Fabra, , , Rosa Sensat, , and . Her father was Josep Mata Virgili (1886‚Äì1934), an industrial technician, who died in a work accident in Madrid when Marta was 8 years old. She went to kindergarten and elementary schools of the Barcelona City School Board, where her mother worked. In 1937 she began high school at the . In 1939 her teachers and professors were dismissed or dispersed because of the Civil War. She finished high school in 1943 at the Verdaguer Institute, and began her studies in Natural Sciences at the University of Barcelona, but before finishing the first year she was forced to interrupt her studies due to tuberculosis. In 1944 she moved to Saifores (Banyeres), to the family house Cal Mata, an inheritance from her father. There she spent a long convalescence and, once restored to health, began to work in children's education following guidance from her mother who, because of a paralysis, had also retired to the country. Mother and daughter resided at Cal Mata until 1965. In Saifores she started her university studies again and enrolled at the University of Barcelona's Faculty of Philosophy and Letters. She obtained a licentiate in Pedagogy in 1957 and continued with doctorate courses. Pedagogical renovation In Saifores, Mata also began her collaboration with the first groups of teachers involved in the pedagogical renovation movement that promoted Spanish education during the Second Republic, and with the resurgence of schools that proposed a renewal of education in Catalan. She also contacted the pedagogues Alexandre Gal√≠, Artur Martorell, and Jordi Rubi√≥, of whom she considered herself a disciple. In 1959 she traveled to Geneva for the first time and contacted the International Bureau of Education, where she met the pedagogue . She also began working as a pedagogical consultant for the Catalan publishers Nova Terra and La Galera, and the recently created children's magazine Cavall Fort. She worked on some publications of the National Institute of Spanish Books and publishers Teide and Vicens Vives. In the summer of 1964 she lived for a month on Israel's Dvir kibbutz, where she learned its educational system. In 1965 she moved her residence to Barcelona. Facing the impossibility of freely creating professorship training centers during the Francoist regime, together with a team of teachers of diverse schools and the support of parents of the alumni of these schools, she clandestinely created the with the objectives of training teachers and building a democratic, active, public, and quality school. The project extended into the so-called Summer Schools, with an important footprint inside and outside of Catalonia. From 1965 to 1975 Mata strengthened her relationship with groups of teachers working on pedagogical renovation in Spain and Portugal, and established contacts with university professors and institutions in France, England, the USSR, Chile, and Italy, while specializing in teaching in language contact situations, and in the didactics of written language and Catalan and Spanish phonology. From the Rosa Sensat school she promoted the creation of the magazine Perspectiva Escolar in 1974, and in 1975 promoted the declaration of the 10th Summer School: Por una nueva Escuela P√∫blica (For a New Public School). During 1982 and 1983 she participated in the organization and realization of the 1st Congress of Pedagogical Renovation Movements, sponsored by the Ministry of Education. In 1984 she created the √Ängels Garriga de Mata Foundation, now called the Marta Mata Garriga Foundation, an entity whose objective is the development of a dynamic conception of the school and the establishment of relations between the worlds of culture, work, entertainment, and civics. The Foundation has a library specialized in education, and archives of Mata's documents. Political career The death of Francisco Franco opened the door to greater political involvement for Marta Mata, who joined Socialist Convergence of Catalonia (CSC) in 1976, directed by Joan Revent√≥s, which became part of the Socialist Party of Catalonia‚ÄìCongress and, two years later, the Socialists' Party of Catalonia (PSC). In the general elections of 1977 she was elected deputy for the district of Barcelona for the socialist coalition, and was part of the Constituent Legislature. In these years she combined the work of deputy with that of the Rosa Sensat school. From this legislature, Marta highlighted the fact that \\"the new legislation contemplates the participation of parents, teachers, and students in the school, and new capabilities for Catalonia.\\" In 1979 she was reelected, and also held a seat in the 1st Legislature until 1980, when she was elected Deputy to the Parliament of Catalonia for the district of Tarragona. From 1983 to 1984 she was a Senator representing the Parliament of Catalonia, and was one of the socialist rapporteurs, together with Jos√© Eduardo Gonz√°lez Navas, of the first Law on Linguistic Normalization of Catalan in 1983. From 1984 to 1988 she returned to the Parliament of Catalonia for the constituency of Barcelona. From 1987 to 1995 she was Councilor for Education of the City Council of Barcelona, where she promoted the Educating Cities movement. From 1987 to 1991, she was also responsible for the Education Department of the Barcelona Provincial Council. From 1993 to 1996 she was again Senator for the district of Barcelona. Mata was vice president of the from its founding in 1986 until June 2002, when she resigned in protest at the way in which the Popular Party Government passed the (LOCE), noting that it \\"would not allow its debate in depth.\\" She was also a member of the Catalan School Council as a representative of the Federation of Municipalities from 1987 to 1995, and President of the Municipal School Council of Barcelona (which had been established during her tenure as Councilor for Education) by delegation of its mayor from 1990 to 1995. She left politics in 1996 after her official retirement. She then dealt with putting her writings in order and preparing some publications. She also collaborated on various educational projects, including the coordination of the program \\"El Forum en la escuela\\" within the framework of the Barcelona 2004 Forum. In May 2004, she returned to the State School Council as President at the request of the then Socialist Minister Mar√≠a Jes√∫s San Segundo, a responsibility she held until her death on 27 June 2006. When she died, the then President of the Generalitat of Catalonia and personal friend of Mata, Pasqual Maragall, remembered her as the person who \\"pushed the pedagogical tradition to its maximum splendor\\".

Early life and family Smyth was the son of Sir Robert Smyth, 5th Baronet of Berechurch and spinster Charlotte Sophia Delaval Blake. Educated first in Paris, he was admitted to Trinity Hall, Cambridge in 1802, and inherited his father's Berechurch estate in 2005‚Äîwhich he extended and rebuilt, making him popular and respected in the local Colchester area‚Äîand the Baronetcy of Upton. In 1815, he married Eva Elmore, daughter of George Elmore of Penton, near Andover in Hampshire, and they had at least one child, Charlotte (1813‚Äì1845), who was illegitimate. Political career While refurbishing his estate, Smyth became popular and a leading figure in the local anti-Catholic Tory Blue party, which dominated local politics. In 1821, he chaired the meeting which saw the creation of the Loyal Colchester Association, which aimed to \\"counteract the diffusion of loyal and seditious principles\\" and, in the same year, at an anniversary dinner for the Colchester True Blue or Pitt Club, which he was active in, he congratulated members for \\"the increased ascendancy which True Blue principles were gaining every day\\". This helped Smyth towards his first successful bid for parliament, culminating in his successful election as Member of Parliament (MP) for Colchester at the 1826 general election, when he stood to replace the retiring ministerialists, James Beckford Wildman and Henry Baring. At the hustings for the election, he declared himself \\"an admirer of the king ; a firm supporter of the church and state; and that to the utmost of his ability, he would walk in the footsteps of the immortal Mr. Pitt \\". In consequence of a pact with the Radical, Daniel Whittle Harvey, the pair were returned unopposed. Smyth's father had also been an MP for the constituency between 1780 and April 1784, and July 1784 and 1788, as well as for Cardigan between 1774 and 1775. In parliament, Smyth presented two petitions against Catholic relief; the first from Colchester archdeaconry and residents, and the second from the corporation, both in March 1827. He then voted accordingly on a bill in the same month. Other votes included voting in favour of the duke of Clarence's annuity bill and against the corn bill, both in 1827. However, he gradually grew apart from the government's views, telling a dinner of the True Blue Club in November 1827 \\"there might be some difficulty as to the course which he should pursue, but... he would not take a seat with the Whigs, nor with those who had come round to the True Blues for the sake of place\\". In particular, he was a \\"diehard opponent\\" Catholic emancipation, \\"dividing doggedly against it\\" and presenting a petition to the House of Commons to \\"guard the country from the danger to which it was exposed from the machinations of men who were avowedly hostile to the church establishment\\" if the Test Acts were repealed. He presented further anti-Catholic petitions and, in November 1828, urged the formation of a local Brunswick Club, of which he became its first president. At the local mayoral election in the same month, he \\"avowed himself a staunch supporter of the Protestant cause\\" and suggested that ministers looked \\"favourably\\" on the club and its supporters. Ultimately, however, he resigned his parliamentary seat in 1829 \\"in disgust\\" at the Wellington‚ÄìPeel ministry's concession of Catholic emancipation, by accepting the office of Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds. At a dinner celebrating the return of his replacement, Richard Sanderson, another True Blue, he said he was \\"disgusted with the House of Commons\\", saying emancipation would be \\"the ruin of Old England\\". Nevertheless, he remained prominent in Colchester politics, although he admitted he was \\"wholly ignorant\\" of the currency question relating to beer and malt taxes, but hoped the ministry would alleviate the tax burden and \\"discount the radical nostrum of a property tax\\". He made similar points when standing for election at Essex at a by-election in 1830, where he professed himself a \\"Tory of the old school\\". At that year's general election, he stood again for Colchester but withdrew from the race, which had six candidates, before the poll. At a by-election in 1831 he supported Sir William Curtis, 2nd Baronet, a Tory, in his unsuccessful bid for the seat, and at the general election of the same month, he was a prominent supporter of Richard Sanderson, who was again seeking election. Smyth returned to the seat at the 1835 general election, then holding it until 1850 when he again resigned, due to \\"age and infirmities\\", accepting the office of Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds. During this period, he was an opponent of the Maynooth Grant and repeal of the corn laws. Death Smyth died at his home in Berechurch in 1852, leaving no legitimate issue, with his estate being passed to the children of his illegitimate daughter, Charlotte, who had married Thomas White of Wetherfield, Essex. He was remembered as a \\"fine specimen of the old English gentleman\\", while the baronetcy became extinct.

The play, printed in 1769 but dated 1770, was a stage failure when it premiered in 15 January 1774. Action The action takes places in a hall of the palace of Cirta at the time if the Second Punic War. Sophonisbe, daughter of Asdrubal (Hasdrubal) is married to king Siphax (Syphax) of Numidia. Her former fianc√© Massinisse (Massinissa) defeats and kills Siphax with the help of the Romans and wants to marry Sophonisbe; Scipion (Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus) however wants her sent to Rome. Massinisse therefore kills both Sophonisbe and himself.Vgl. Siegfried Detemple: Sophonisbe, in: Voltaire: Die Werke. Katalog zum 300. Geburtstag. Reichert, Wiesbaden 1994, pp.220f. Literary sources The material for the plot derives from accounts by Titus Livius, Polybius and Appian, which had already been adapted into stage plays by a number of writers including Gian Giorgio Trissino (1514), Jean Mairet (1629), Pierre Corneille (1663) and Nathaniel Lee (1675). Analysis of the dramatic structure and the verse indicates that Voltaire drew on a number of earlier version of the story while crafting his own. Contemporary reception Voltaire succeeded in having the play premiered at the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise in 15 January 1774 but there were only four performances before it was taken off the stage. The failure of both this and his other play Don P√®dre, roi de Castille depressed him, and he took a break from writing tragedies until 1777, when he wrote Ir√®ne and Agathocle.Theodore Besterman: Exil (1773‚Äì1775), in: Voltaire, Winkler, M√ºnchen, 1971, p.441 Printed edition Voltaire had arranged the printing of the work in late 1769 with the widow Duchesne in Paris. Publication followed at the end of that year, carrying the date 1770. The work was published with the title Sophonisbe, Trag√©die de Mairet, repar√©e √† neuf, Veuve Duchesne, Paris, 1770. Voltaire added an explanatory preface in which he claimed that Mairet's work had been adapted by a certain Jean-Baptiste Lantin, who had died fifty years previously, but this is certainly spurious. It may be that Voltaire was uncertain about how the theatre-going public would respond to the play, and wished to distance himself to some degree from his own creation.

Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal condemned the killings. Mamata Banerjee, the Chief Minister of West Bengal condemned the killings and pointed towards the NRC process as the trigger behind the killings. ULFA (Independent) denied any involvement in the massacre.  Background  As early as in 2016, ULFA warned Bengali Hindu individuals and organizations not to support the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill. On 13 October, the ULFA (Independent) detonated a low intensity bomb in Guwahati to warn the Bengali Hindu organizations protesting the exclusion of names of Bengali Hindu refugees from the NRC. It claimed that the Bengali Hindu organizations were working against the interests of the indigenous Assamese people and conspiring against Assam. A week before the incident, Assam Police received intelligence input about attacks in Bengali inhabited areas. On 25 November the pro-talk faction of the ULFA leadership stated that the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2016 must be stopped from being passed at the Parliament. If it gets passed, he threatened to turn Assam into a 1983-like situation where the Bengali people would be massacred again.  Killings  In the evening of 1 November 2018, six or seven Bengali Hindu youths were relaxing at a shop and playing ludo in the Kherbari village. Around 8-30 PM IST five or six unidentified gunmen arrived at the spot and rounded up the youths. They were taken to the banks of the Brahmaputra river, about six kilometers from the Dhola-Sadiya bridge. The gunmen forced the youths to sit on a line. At around 8:55 PM IST the gunmen opened fire on the youths from a point blank range. Five out of the seven people died on the spot. The two critically injured survivors were rushed to the hospital.

Wallace Professor of Genetics. He is also affiliated with the Yale Cancer Center and the Yale Stem Cell Center. Giraldez specializes in understanding how a newly-fertilized egg transforms into a highly-functioning, complex animal. This is a critical period in embryonic development and many of the pathways and molecules that drive this transformation are shared across animal species. Giraldez uses zebrafish as a model system, because it can be easily manipulated and visualized, and because the genetic tools to unlock its secrets are very sophisticated. When an egg is fertilized, it must shut down the maternal signals that maintain its identity and activate a new program to become a healthy zygote, which in turn can develop into a fully-fledged adult. Giraldez has contributed to characterizing the shift that occurs after the embryo interprets and shuts down the maternal program and activates the developmental program contained in its own genome. Giraldez‚Äôs work has wide implications for understanding developmental genetics in humans and other species, advancing RNA biology, and exploring the activation of embryonic cells in health and disease. He has been named a Howard Hughes Faculty Scholar and a Pew Scholar in Biomedical Sciences. In addition, he has received the Blavatnik Award for Young Scientists (National Finalist), the Vilcek Prize for Creative Promise in Biomedical Science and the John Kendrew Young Scientist Award from the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL).  Early life and education  Born in 1975 in Jerez de la Frontera, Spain, Giraldez attended high school at La Salle Buen Pastor, in Jerez de la Frontera, Spain. He followed on with studies in Chemistry and Molecular Biology at the University of Cadiz and the University Autonoma of Madrid. As an undergraduate, he worked with Gin√©s Morata at the Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa (CBMSO) in Madrid. Giraldez completed his PhD with Stephen Cohen at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL, Heidelberg, 1998-2002), followed by postdoctoral studies with Alexander Schier at the Skirball Institute (NYU) and Harvard (2003-2006).  Career  He established his laboratory at Yale in 2007, became Director of Graduate Studies in 2012, and left that position to become Chair the Genetics Department in 2017, where he is now the Fergus F. Wallace Professor of Genetics. Research Giraldez began his career at the Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa (CBMSO) in Madrid, working on the development of Drosophila under the mentorship of Gin√©s Morata. He then moved to the EMBL to study the mechanisms of development of the Drosophila wing under the mentorship of Stephen Cohen. Giraldez identified the gene Notum, so called because it caused duplication of the notum region upon overexpression in the wing primordium.HSPG modification by the secreted enzyme Notum shapes the Wingless morphogen gradient. Gir√°ldez AJ, Copley RR, Cohen SM. Dev Cell. 2002 May;2(5):667-76. He discovered that Notum encodes a secreted inhibitor that reduces the local concentration of an important developmental signaling molecule known as Wingless. During his postdoctoral career at the Skirball Institute (NYU) and Harvard with Alexander Schier, Giraldez investigated the role of microRNAs and the microRNA processing machinery Dicer in vertebrate embryonic development. Giraldez‚Äôs studies of mRNA and embryonic microRNAs led to fundamental insights into the mechanisms by which a maternal cell transitions to a self-regulating zygote, a process known as the maternal-to- zygotic transition (MZT). During MZT, zygotic genome activation regulates maternal mRNAs, but the molecular effectors of this regulation were a mystery. Giraldez and collaborators identified a conserved microRNA, miR-430 which represses, deadenylates, and clears ‚âà20% of maternal mRNAs2. MiR-430 is a large microRNA family that is conserved in other vertebrates: miR-427 in Xenopus and miR-290-295/302 in mouse and humans. This work, which was reported in the journal Science in 2005 and 2006, revealed the importance of miRNAs generally in different aspects of embryonic development and revealed a novel mechanism of miRNA-mediated regulation known as deadenylation.Zebrafish MiR-430 promotes deadenylation and clearance of maternal mRNAs.

Career  Born in Lima, Peru, she emigrated with her family to Los Angeles as a child, where she began her musical studies as a recipient of a scholarship from the Friends of Jazz Inc. In 2011, she won the Gold Medal at the International Competition of Choral Singing in Spittal, Austria, as part of the Fullerton Chamber Singers Vocal Group. In 2013, she began her Bachelor's Degree in Music Performance at California State University, where she was awarded a scholarship by the Ella Fitzgerald Foundation. She graduated summa cum laude two years ahead of time with the highest honors awarded by the university. In 2014 she received a DownBeat Music Award as part of Pacific Standard Time vocal group (she received this award again in 2015 and 2016). In 2015 she moved to New York and began a Master's Degree in Music Performance at State University of New York, once again as a scholar of the Ella Fitzgerald Foundation (the first student in the history of this institution to receive this scholarship twice). In the same year, she recorded the first album of the duo project Renato Diz Maria Quintanilla at Daniel Concert Hall in Los Angeles, with multi Estonian Music Awards winning engineer Jos√© Diogo Neves, entitled \\"Distance Chemistry\\", released on New York-based label W&J; Productions. In 2016 \\"Distance Chemistry\\" was released at Rockwood Music Hall, with a sold-out box office. Inspired by Renato Diz Maria Quintanilla's unique musical approach, film director Pedro Marnoto Pereira invited them to create a short film inspired by their original composition \\"Conversation II\\" (meanwhile released online with thousands of views worldwide), since its release \\"Distance Chemistry\\" has sold thousands of copies and is currently in its third edition. Later that year, Renato Diz Maria Quintanilla invited indigenous Taiwanese percussionist Sayun Chang to create their new work. Collectively they composed several chamber pieces inspired by the stories of aboriginal tribes and Taiwanese traditions, this work culminated in an album recording at Tedesco Studios entitled \\"Breathing Taiwan\\" (on W&J; Productions). In 2017 she was the recipient of the Thayer Fellowship in Arts for Excellence, Creativity and Talent (this exclusive award is given to only 3 individuals amongst 500,000 students from all Colleges of State University Of New York), she also received the Purchase College Outstanding Graduate Student Award and graduated Summa Cum Laude, with the highest honors personally given by the university's president and New York State Senator Chuck Schumer. During her time at SUNY she had the opportunity to represent Ella Fitzgerald in centennial performances with the Purchase Jazz Orchestra at the Blue Note Jazz Club and Jazz at Lincoln Center. After graduating, she was invited to teach at the State University of New York in the department of Vocal Jazz, an activity that she currently holds parallel to her concert career. In the same year she co- wrote and recorded the soundtrack for the documentary \\"Vozes na N√©voa\\" along with Renato Diz, directed by Pedro Marnoto Pereira. Also, her duo with Renato Diz was commissioned to create a special work honoring the History of Portugal by ARTE Institute, Caixa Geral de Dep√≥sitos and Funda√ß√£o Luso Americana. This creation entitled \\"Portugal: Sonic Paths and Possibilities\\" contained compositions and original arrangements that explore the deepest origins of Portugal and its influence and ramifications throughout Africa, South America and Asia. After its world premiere at Joe's Pub, they were invited by Instituto Cam√µes to present this creation at the Festival Portugal International de Montreal in Canada. In June 2018 she performed with Renato Diz trio at one of the most iconic festivals in the world, the Summerstage, in Central Park, where names such as Sonic Youth, Joni Mitchell, Sting, Stevie Wonder and Bobby McFerrin also performed in previous years.

The negotiations that gave rise to the Treaty of Tordesillas took place there, through which Spain and Portugal shared the New World, giving rise to Ibero-America. History On October 12, 1492, Columbus arrived in the New World. To defend Castilian sovereignty over the territories newly found by Columbus, Isabella and Ferdinand sought help from Pope Alexander VI (Rodrigo Borgia), who had been elected in August 1492 and with whom they had a long list of mutual favors. The Pope issued four bulls, known as Alexandrian Bulls. In them he established that the lands and seas to the west of the meridian located 100 leagues west of the Azores and Cape Verde belonged to the crown of Castile. Excommunication was decreed for all those who crossed that meridian without authorization from the kings of Castile. The prerogatives derived from the Alexandrian Bulls, especially from the last Inter Caetera, very favorable to the Castilians, did not satisfy Juan II of Portugal, who was excluded from the Americas, since the line of demarcation traced by papal design relegated him to the African coasts, leaving the New World for the king and queen of Castile and Aragon. The Catholic Monarchs and the Lusitanian monarch then negotiated a bilateral treaty. Diplomatic delegations met for several months in Tordesillas, in the current province of Valladolid. According to the Portuguese chronicler Garc√≠a de Resende, the Portuguese ambassadors received secret reports from Lisbon on what would be the negotiating position of the Castilians with direct instructions from King Juan.Rumeu de Armas, Antonio (1985). Nueva luz sobre las Capitulaciones de Santa Fe. Madrid: CSIC. p. 126. . Finally, the delegates of both monarchies reached an agreement that was reflected in a treaty, signed on June 7, 1494, today called the Treaty of Tordesillas. Buildings View of the houses; on the right you can see the tower of the Church Museum of San Antol√≠n. The oldest palace dates from the end of the 15th century. Its fa√ßade conserves the coat of arms of Catholic kings. The other palace was built in the middle of the 17th century and was the residence of a wealthy family. Both were subjected to a major restoration in 1994, on the occasion of the 500th anniversary of the Treaty. Two years later they were declared assets of cultural interest.

He is the city‚Äôs third African-American mayor. Early life and education Lucas was born in Kansas City, Missouri, the son of Quincy Bennett Johnson. His mother describes his childhood as one of living in two worlds. He earned a scholarship to attend The Barstow School, a private school far removed from the harsh economic realities of Kansas City's east side. \\"He saw we were struggling,\\" Johnson says. \\"One time we lived in a hotel, and it was horrible. Quinton would go in the bathroom to study.\\" Determined to overcome poverty, Lucas devoted himself to school, dedicating himself to academics and sports. He became one of the Barstow School's most exceptional athletes, was elected student body president twice, and was one of the top students in his class, but he experienced a conflict of identity as the hopes of his mentors and his ambitions pushed him further from his roots. In this time he found himself forming lifelong relationships with the school's janitors and felt reluctant about leaving Kansas City upon graduation. Encouraged by his college counselor, Lucas accepted an offer to study at Washington University. Lucas found his niche in political science and studied abroad in South Africa. Living in Cape Town, he closely studied the politics and culture of apartheid. This experience challenged Lucas' assumptions about inequality but more importantly shaped the way Lucas would approach democracy, consensus-building, and relationships in extremely divided environments. He attended law school at Cornell, where he was encouraged by a professor to assist in Curtis Osborne's appeal for clemency. Though the appeal failed, Lucas found the legal experience to be transformative. Quinton Lucas joined the University of Kansas faculty of Law in 2012 where he taught Contracts and Administrative Law. Political career In 2015, Lucas won a city council seat representing the Third-District-at-Large, gaining more than 70% of the vote. His message was concerned with bridging the gaps between east and west in a divided city. When asked what was the greatest challenge facing Kansas City, Lucas said, \\"How do we get people from jobs in my part of the city, the east side of Kansas City, off into other parts of the city or even to Kansas?\\" Housing policy became a primary focus once Lucas was situated on City Council. His housing policy aimed to ensure housing availability for Kansas City families is geared toward the symmetrical development of new housing supply along with the renovation of existing properties. Lucas played a decisive role in shaping a 2018 ordinance that defined affordable rent as equaling 30% or less of the city's median income, what was then $1,100 a month. In an interview with the Kansas City Business Journal, Lucas explained that while he realized \\"that $1,000 a month is still pretty high for a lot of people, but what we‚Äôre trying to do is say that we will not give incentives based on affordability standards for units that are north of that figure.‚Äù He is currently Chair of the City Council Housing Committee. Quinton also serves on committees related to Planning, Zoning, and Economic Development; the Airport; Transportation and Infrastructure; Neighborhoods and Public Safety. During discussions surrounding the finance and development of a new airport in August 2017, Quinton Lucas emerged as a firm advocate for transparency, disagreeing with Mayor Sly James. ‚ÄúMy concern is I continue to believe we overuse closed sessions,‚Äù Quinton Lucas, told The Kansas City Star. ‚ÄúI think the spirit of the Sunshine Law is not for council to deliberate on myriad issues on public policy in secret.‚Äù. In January 2018 Lucas proposed a five point targeted strategy for reducing crime: (1) fund social workers in each police patrol division, (2) deploy officers to economically distressed areas and not just entertainment districts, (3) recruit diverse candidates for the police force, (4) challenge the necessity of incarcerating citizens for municipal offenses, and (5) appeal to the state of Missouri to adequately fund Kansas City's criminal justice system to lighten the load of public defender cases and improve overall pay.. In October 2018 police in Lawrence, Kansas \\"got a call of an unconscious man at 8th and Massachusetts. [Officers] found Lucas asleep in his car.\\" He \\"was booked for misdemeanor driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs ... and released on a $750 bond\\", even though he was reportedly asleep, not driving. In the 2019 mayoral election, Lucas was elected Mayor of Kansas City, Missouri after receiving approximately 59% of the vote. In late August of 2020, citizens filed the necessary paperwork for a recall, and are currently gaining signatures in an attempt to remove Lucas from office. These petitioners are of the opinion that Lucas' response to COVID-19 and his mask regulations are harming the city's small businesses, and are a serious overreach of power. Personal life Quinton Lucas lives in the historic 18th and Vine district. Lucas is a noted super-fan of the Kansas City Chiefs. The New York Times found that he takes exceptionally detailed notes on the performances of Kansas City sports teams.

Like most positional games, it is described by a set of positions/points/elements (X) and a family of subsets (\\\\mathcal{F}), which are called here the losing-sets. It is played by two players, called Avoider and Enforcer, who take turns picking elements until all elements are taken. Avoider wins if he manages to avoid taking a losing set; Enforcer wins if he manages to make Avoider take a losing set. The board for the game of Sim, an Avoider-Enforcer game A classic example of such a game is Sim. There, the positions are all the edges of the complete graph on 6 vertices. Players take turns to shade a line in their color, and lose when they form a full triangle of their own color: the losing sets are all the triangles.  Comparison to Maker-Breaker games  The winning condition of an Avoider-Enforcer game is exactly the opposite of the winning condition of the Maker-Breaker game on the same \\\\mathcal{F}. Thus, the Avoider-Enforcer game is the Mis√®re game variant of the Maker-Breaker game. However, there are counter- intuitive differences between these game-types. For example, consider the biased version of the games, in which the first player takes p elements each turn and the second player takes q elements each turn (in the standard version p=1 and q=1). Maker-Breaker games are bias-monotonic: taking more elements is always an advantage. Formally, if Maker wins the (p:q) Maker-Breaker game, then he also wins the (p+1:q) game and the (p:q-1) game. Avoider-Enforcer games are not bias-monotonic: taking more elements is not always a disadvantage. For example, consider a very simple Avoider-Enforcer game where the losing sets are {w,x} and {y,z}. Then, Avoider wins the (1:1) game, Enforcer wins the (1:2) game and Avoider wins the (2:2) game. There is a monotone variant of the (p:q) Avoider-Enforcer game-rules, in which Avoider has to pick at least p elements each turn and Enforcer has to pick at least q elements each turn; this variant is bias-monotonic.  Partial avoidance  Similarly to Maker-Breaker games, Avoider-Enforcer games too have fractional generalizations. Suppose Avoider needs to avoid taking at least a fraction t of the elements in any winning-set (i.e., take at most 1-t of the elements in any set), and Enforcer needs to prevent this, i.e., Enforcer needs to take less than a fraction t of the elements in some winning-set. Define the constant: c_t := (2t)^t \\\\cdot (2-2t)^{1-t} = 2 \\\\cdot t^t \\\\cdot (1-t)^{1-t}(in the standard variant, t=1, c_t\\\\to 2). * If \\\\sum_{E\\\\in \\\\mathcal{F}} {c_t}^{-|E|} < 1, and the total number of elements is even, then Avoider has a winning strategy when playing first.

His use of art to lobby for workers‚Äô rights has fostered numerous controversies. While his passionate and opinionated support for working people has led to the destruction and censoring of his works all over the globe, his approach has been described as ‚Äúideally suited to the postmodern and post-state socialist era, when everything rebellious must be created anew and when ‚Äòculture' along with ‚Äòlabor‚Äô are urgently needed to salvage a world from eco-disaster, perpetual war, and the plundering of human possibility.‚Äù  Early life  Alewitz was born January 14, 1951, in Cleveland, Ohio, to parents who were active in unions and progressive causes. At the age of four, the family moved to Wilmington, Delaware. There Alewitz grew up in a segregated post-war housing development surrounded by working-class Irish and Italian families. Alewitz moved back to Cleveland when he was a teenager, and after graduating from Cleveland Heights High School in 1968, he enrolled at Kent State University. While at Kent State he served as a founder and Chairman of the Kent Student Mobilization Committee Against the War in Vietnam (SMC). He was also a columnist for the Daily Kent Stater and was the socialist candidate for student body president at the time of the Kent State shootings in 1970.  Kent State shootings  On April 30, 1970, U.S. President Richard Nixon, having recently pledged to withdraw 150,000 troops from Vietnam, instead went on television and announced the expansion of American war efforts into Cambodia. At Kent State, as occurred on many college campuses across the country, Nixon‚Äôs announcement inspired passionate student protest and clashes with authorities. Ohio Governor James Rhodes sent National Guardsmen to occupy the Kent State campus and restore order, but on May 4, during a student-run anti-war rally, several of the guardsmen fired on protesting students, killing four and wounding nine others. Alewitz was an eyewitness to the shootings, with some of his close friends counted among the victims. In the immediate wake of the tragedy, Alewitz fled campus to avoid arrest but was soon detained by a group of ‚Äúvigilantes‚Äù who pursued the Kent State protestors. Police arrived and arrested Alewitz, who was then barred from returning to the university. After leaving Kent State, Alewitz became a leader of the national student strike that followed the shootings and traveled to Washington, DC, to address a crowd of over 100,000 people at a mass anti-war demonstration on May 9, 1970. Alewitz later served as National Chairman of the Committee of Kent State Massacre Eyewitnesses and was subpoenaed to testify before the Presidential Commission on Campus Unrest (Scranton Commission) where he spoke extensively about the shootings.  Anti-war activity  Following the tragedy at Kent State, Alewitz moved to Austin, Texas, where he became a leader of the Austin Student Mobilization Committee and the Texas statewide anti-war coalition. His involvement in student outreach to active-duty GIs there led to him being barred from local military bases and placed on the Attorney General‚Äôs list of ‚Äúsubversives.‚Äù  Labor and socialist activist  Alewitz joined the Young Socialist Alliance in 1968 and the Socialist Workers Party in 1970. He was active with the group in Texas, Los Angeles, Cleveland, New Orleans, Virginia, Boston and Newark, New Jersey. He served as a member of the SWP until his expulsion in 1987, but remained active in the socialist, anti- war, and labor movements. During his professional career, Alewitz worked at a variety of jobs, including as a track laborer, railroad clerk, production machinist, and sign painter. His various occupations included membership in such organizations as the Brotherhood of Railroad Clerks, the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way, International Union of Electrical Workers, Brotherhood of Painters and Allied Trades, United Scenic Artists, and the American Association of University Professors.  Artist and muralist  Alewitz has traveled throughout the world creating public art on themes of peace and justice. Some of his earlier works included a mural at the Massachusetts College of Art depicting murdered teen Elijah Pate, the seven-story ‚ÄúPathfinder Mural‚Äù in New York‚Äôs Greenwich Village, and a mural promoting international worker solidarity at the Southern California Library for Social Studies and Research. His international works include murals commissioned in Baghdad, Chernobyl, Mexico, Nicaragua, Northern Ireland, Israel, the Occupied Territories, and numerous other locations. In 1999, Alewitz was named a Millennium Artist by the White House Millennium Council, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the Mid-Atlantic Arts Foundation. As a result, he was chosen to execute a highly publicized series of murals painted in Maryland about Harriet Tubman and the Underground Railroad. The central mural, which depicted Tubman carrying a musket, was ultimately rejected by the Associated Black Charities (for whom it was intended) for its controversial association with gun violence. Alewitz has also organized cultural initiatives for unions and progressive organizations such as the United Mine Workers; Jobs with Justice; Teamsters; Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers Union; and the United Farm Workers. He taught labor history at Rutgers University, where he was Artist-in-Residence for the NJ Industrial Union Council. From 2000 to 2016, Alewitz was a professor at Central Connecticut State University where he directed a community-based mural painting and street art program. He was the organizer of several annual New Britain International Mural Slams and responsible for establishing a collection of more than one hundred murals at the university.  Red Square  In 2014, Alewitz was commissioned to paint a mural for the Puffin Gallery of Social Activism at the Museum of the City of New York. The museum refused to install the work due to its political content. Following the censorship of the Puffin mural, Alewitz established his home in New London, Connecticut, at Red Square, a private studio, gallery, and museum of his agitprop art. Mike Alewitz has spoken and written extensively on political and cultural topics and is the co-author (with Paul Buhle) of Insurgent Images: The Agitprop Murals of Mike Alewitz. His art has also been the subject of documentary films, including 2005‚Äôs Breaking Walls, which followed Alewitz on a trip to the Middle East and examined the ways in which his murals have shaped conversations about the role of art in society.

Initially playing his club cricket for Woodvale in Northern Ireland, before switching to Dublin University, Warke made his debut in first-class cricket for Ireland against Scotland at Perth in 1950. Over the next decade, he would play regular first-class cricket for Ireland. He played his final first-class match against Scotland at Cork in 1961, by which point he had played in seventeen first- class matches for Ireland. A broad shouldered, strongly built and powerful batsman, he scored 450 runs across his seventeen first-class matches, averaging 13.96, with a highest score of 120. This score, which was his only first-class century (and the only time he passed fifty), came against Scotland in 1954. He also took seven wickets with his medium pace, though he never took more than one wicket in an innings. After qualifying as a doctor, he remained in Dublin to work as a junior doctor, where he played his club cricket for Leinster. A talented rugby union player, he played for Dublin University and Lansdowne while studying in Dublin, and later earned caps for Ulster and Leinster. He trialled for the Irish national team in 1954/55. He died at Belfast in January 1989. His son, Stephen, played cricket for Ireland in the 1980s and 1990s.

Like most positional games, it is described by a set of positions/points/elements (X) and a family of subsets (\\\\mathcal{F}), which are usually called the winning- sets. It is played by two players who take turns picking elements until all elements are taken. While in the standard game each player picks one element per turn, in the biased game each player takes a different number of elements. More formally, for every two positive integers p and q, a (p:q)-positional game is a game in which the first player picks p elements per turn and the second player picks q elements per turn. The main question of interest regarding biased positional games is what is their threshold bias - what is the bias in which the winning-power switches from one player to the other player.  Example  As an example, consider the triangle game. In this game, the elements are all edges of a complete graph on n vertices, and the winning- sets are all triangles (=cliques on 3 vertices). Suppose we play it as a Maker-Breaker game, i.e., the goal of Maker (the first player) is to take a triangle and the goal of Breaker (the second triangle) is to prevent Maker from taking a triangle. Using a simple case-analysis, it can be proved that Maker has a winning strategy whenever n is at least 6. Therefore, it is interesting to ask whether this advantaged can be biased by letting Breaker pick more than 1 element per turn. Indeed, it is possible to prove that: * For every q \\\\leq 0.5 \\\\sqrt{n}, Maker wins the (1:q) triangle game on n vertices. * For every q \\\\geq 2 \\\\sqrt{n}, Breaker wins the (1:q) triangle game on n vertices.  A winning condition for Breaker  In an unbiased Maker-Breaker game, the Erdos-Selfridge theorem gives a winning condition for Breaker. This condition can be generalized to biased games as follows: * If \\\\sum_{E\\\\in \\\\mathcal{F}} (1+q)^{-|E|/p} < 1, then Breaker has a winning-strategy in the (p:q) game when playing first. * If \\\\sum_{E\\\\in \\\\mathcal{F}} (1+q)^{-|E|/p} < {1\\\\over 1+q}, then Breaker has a winning-strategy in the (p:q) game even when playing second. The strategy uses a potential function which generalized the function of Erdos-Selfridge. The potential of a (non-broken) winning-set E with |Euntaken elements is defined as (1+q)^{-|E|/p}. If Maker wins the game then there exists a set E with |E|=0, so its potential is 1; therefore, to prove that Breaker wins, it is sufficient to prove that the final potential- sum is less than 1. Indeed, by assumption, the potential-sum at Breaker's first turn is less than 1; and if Breaker always picks an element that maximizes the potential-drop, it is possible to show that the potential-sum always weakly decreases. When each winning-set has k elements, for some fixed k, Breaker's winning condition simplifies to: |\\\\mathcal{F}< (q+1)^{k/p} (when playing first) or |\\\\mathcal{F}< (q+1)^{k/p-1}(when playing second). This condition is tight: there are k-uniform set-families with |\\\\mathcal{F}= (q+1)^{k/p-1}sets where Maker wins.  A winning condition for Maker  In an unbiased Maker-Breaker game, a theorem by Beck gives a winning condition for Maker. It uses the pair-degree of the hypergraph - denoted by d_2. This condition can be generalized to biased games as follows: If \\\\sum_{E\\\\in \\\\mathcal{F}} {p+q\\\\over p}^{-|E|} > {p^2 q^2 \\\\over (p+q)^3}\\\\cdot d_2 \\\\cdot |X|, then Maker has a winning-strategy in the (p:q) game when playing first.  A winning condition for Avoider  In a biased Avoider-Enforcer game, the following conditions guarantee that Avoider has a winning strategy: *If \\\\sum_{E\\\\in \\\\mathcal{F}} (1+1/p)^{p-|E|} < 1, then Avoider wins the (p:q) game when playing first, under both the strict and the monotonic ruleset. This is almost tight: there is an infinite family of (p:q) games in which this expression is slightly larger than 1 and Enforcer wins. In particular, in the unbiased game the condition becomes \\\\sum_{E\\\\in \\\\mathcal{F}} 2^{1-|E|} < 1. If the graph is k-uniform, the condition becomes |\\\\mathcal{F}< (1+1/p)^{k-1}. It is remarkable that this condition does not depend on q at all. *If each winning-set has at most k elements, and \\\\sum_{E\\\\in \\\\mathcal{F}} \\\\left(1+{q\\\\over p k}\\\\right)^{p-|E|} < 1, then Avoider wins (p:q) game when playing first.

Devoid of any images, the film was an early work of Lettrist cinema. Description The image track of Hurlements en faveur de Sade contains no actual images, only solid white or solid black frames. It follows the sound track such that when there is speech the screen is white, and when there is silence the screen is black. The sound track uses text d√©tourned from Isidore Isou's book Esth√©tique du cin√©ma, John Ford's film Rio Grande, work by James Joyce, and the French Civil Code. The time between speeches becomes increasingly long throughout the film, and it ends with a 24-minute sequence of silence and darkness. Production Debord wrote the original script for Hurlements en faveur de Sade during the winter of 1951‚Äì1952. His notes outlined a combination of original scenes and found footage. Debord planned to use newsreel footage, images of himself and other Lettrists, painted film stock, and sequences of solid black. For the film's soundtrack, his notes included Lettrist poetry, text by Guillaume Apollinaire, and music by Antonio Vivaldi. In April 1952 Debord published his original scenario in Ion magazine along with a preface titled \\"Prol√©gom√®nes √† tout cin√©ma futur\\" (English: \\"Prolegomena to Any Future Cinema\\"). Debord abandoned most of his original plan for the film and instead used no images at all. He used speeches delivered by himself, Gil J Wolman, Isidore Isou, , and Barbara Rosenthal.

It commemorates \\"the contribution of British and Commonwealth military and civilian servicemen and women in the two World Wars and later conflicts\\". The service has its origins in the 1920s and has changed little in format since. To open the ceremony, a selection of national airs and solemn music representing each of the nations of the United Kingdom are played by massed bands and pipes. A short religious service is held with a two-minute silence commencing when Big Ben chimes at 11 O'Clock. Following this, wreaths are laid by the Queen and members of the royal family, senior politicians representing their respective political parties and High commissioners from the Commonwealth of Nations.

The ceremony has been broadcast nationally by the BBC on radio since 1928 and was first broadcast by the BBC Television Service in 1937. Origins The unveiling ceremony on 11 November 1920 The Cenotaph has its origin in a temporary wood and plaster structure designed by Edwin Lutyens for a peace parade following the end of the First World War. Lutyens was inspired by the Greek idea of a cenotaph kenotaphion (Œ∫ŒµŒΩœåœÇ kenos, meaning \\"empty\\", and œÑŒ¨œÜŒøœÇ taphos, \\"tomb\\"), as representative for a tomb elsewhere or in a place unknown. For some time after the parade, the base of the memorial was covered with flowers and wreaths by members of the public. Pressure mounted to retain it, and the British War Cabinet decided on 30 July 1919 that a permanent memorial should replace the wooden version and be designated Britain's official national war memorial. Lutyens's permanent structure was built from Portland stone between 1919 and 1920 by Holland, Hannen & Cubitts as a \\"replica exact in every detail in permanent material of present temporary structure\\". The memorial was unveiled by King George V on 11 November 1920, the second anniversary of the Armistice with Germany which ended the First World War. The unveiling ceremony was part of a larger procession bringing the Unknown Warrior to be laid to rest in his tomb nearby in Westminster Abbey. The funeral procession route passed the Cenotaph, where the waiting King laid a wreath on the Unknown Warrior's gun-carriage before proceeding to unveil the memorial which was draped in large Union Flags.Hornby, Martin (7 July 2008).

Retrieved 25 July 2011-07-25 from http://www.westernfrontassociation.com/great-war-people/memorials/400-burial- unkown.html. During the Second World War, the National Service and other commemorations were moved from Armistice Day itself to the preceding Sunday as an emergency measure, to minimise any loss of wartime production. In 1945, 11 November fell on a Sunday but in 1946, following a national debate, the government announced that the Cenotaph ceremony would henceforward on take place on Remembrance Sunday.  Order of service  The ceremony begins at precisely 10:36 a.m. with a programme of music known as \\"the Traditional Music\\", a sequence beginning with \\"Rule Britannia!\\" which has remained largely unchanged since 1930. This comprises a selection of National Airs and solemn music representing the four nations of the United Kingdom performed by the massed bands of the Household Division interposed Pipes and Drums from the Highlanders 4th Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland. The massed band represents the four nations; the Band of the Grenadier Guards, Band of the Coldstream Guards, Band of the Scots Guards and the Band of the Irish Guards. As the band plays \\"Dido's Lament\\" by Henry Purcell, the clergy led by a cross bearer and the choir of the Chapel Royal process. The service is led by the Dean of the Chapels Royal, usually the Bishop of London. During Solemn Melody by Henry Walford Davies, politicians, high commissioners and religious leaders from many faiths assemble. The parade stands to attention in silence as the Royal Family emerge. As Big Ben strikes 11 a.m., the King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery fire a single shot salute from First World War-era guns on Horse Guards Parade. Two minutes' silence is then observed. The silence represents the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month in 1918, when the guns of Europe fell silent. This silence is ended by Gunners of the Royal Horse Artillery firing a gun salute, then Royal Marines buglers sound The Last Post. The wreath-laying ceremony on 14 November 2010 The first wreath is traditionally laid on behalf of the nation by the Queen. Since 2017, her representative, the Prince of Wales, lays the first wreath on her behalf as the Queen watches from an overlooking balcony. On two occasions foreign heads of state have laid wreaths on behalf of their people. In 2015, Willem-Alexander, King of the Netherlands, placed a wreath in commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the British liberation of the Netherlands in World War II.King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima Join Royals For Remembrance Sunday At the 2018 service, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, President of Germany, at the invitation of the Queen on the advice of her government, next laid a wreath on behalf of the German people, marking the first time a representative of that country has done so. Wreaths are then laid by senior members of the royal family. After the Queen, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh's wreath is laid next; since 2017 this has been delegated to an equerry owing to his advanced age. The Prince of Wales then lays a wreath on his own account, and further wreaths are laid by the Duke of Cambridge, the Duke of Sussex, the Duke of York and the Earl of Wessex; then by the Princess Royal, the Duke of Kent and (in 2018) Prince Michael of Kent. Other members of the Royal Family watch the ceremony from the Foreign Office balcony. The Massed Band plays \\"Beethoven Funeral March No.1\\" by Johann Heinrich Walch as wreaths laid by the Prime Minister (and other Commonwealth leaders if they are present), the Leader of the Opposition, then leaders of major political parties; the Speaker of the House of Commons and the Lord Speaker; the Foreign Secretary; the Home Secretary (in 2019); Commonwealth High Commissioners, and the ambassadors of Ireland (since 2014) and Nepal (since 2019); representatives from the Royal Navy, Army and Royal Air Force; the Merchant Navy and fishing fleets; and finally, the civilian emergency services. A short religious service of remembrance is then conducted by the Bishop of London in their capacity as Dean of the Chapel Royal. The hymn O God Our Help In Ages Past is sung, led by the massed bands and the Choir of the Chapel Royal. The whole assembly recites Lord's Prayer before the Bishop completes the service. The Rouse is then played by the buglers, followed by the national anthem, God Save the Queen being sung by all. The Queen bows to the Cenotaph while the Prince of Wales and the other members of the Royal Family salute it and royal party depart. After the ceremony, as the bands play, a huge parade of veterans, organised by the Royal British Legion, marches past the Cenotaph. Members of the Reserve Forces and cadet organisations join in with the marching, alongside volunteers from St John Ambulance, paramedics from the London Ambulance Service, and conflict veterans from World War II, Korea, the Falklands, the Persian Gulf, Kosovo, Bosnia, Northern Ireland, Iraq, other past conflicts and the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan. The last three then known British-resident veterans of World War I, Bill Stone, Henry Allingham and Harry Patch, attended the 2008 ceremony but all died in 2009. After the service, there is a parade of veterans, who also lay wreaths at the foot of the Cenotaph as they pass, and a salute is taken by a member of the Royal Family at Horse Guards Parade in front of the Guards Memorial. Each contingent salutes the Cenotaph as they pass and many wreaths are handed over to be laid at its base. They salute the Cenotaph (meaning \\"empty tomb\\" in Greek) as they are paying tribute to all those it represents, to all those who died and who lie buried elsewhere. As the veterans march back to Horse Guards Parade a member of the Royal Family takes their salute in front of the Guards Memorial. Professor Jeffrey Richards notes that the format of the ceremony was \\"more or less finalized by 1921\\" although before the Second World War, the wreath- laying by the monarch and dignitaries took place before 11 o'clock.Jeffrey Richards, Imperialism and Music: Britain 1876‚Äì1953, Manchester University Press 2001, (pp. 155‚Äì156) Traditional music Each year, the programme of music at the National Ceremony remains the same, following a programme finalised in 1930, and is known as \\"the Traditional Music\\": { |- ! scope=colName ! scope=colComposer ! scope=colDate ! scope=colNotes ! scope=colSample text |- ! scope=row\\"Rule, Britannia!\\" Thomas Arne 1740 Patriotic song, originating from the poem \\"Rule, Britannia\\" by James Thomson.

Broadcasts Group of wreaths laid during the Remembrance Sunday ceremony in London BBC Radio has broadcast the service on the BBC National Programme and its successors, the BBC Home Service and BBC Radio 4, every year since November 1928, except during World War II. John Reith had wished to broadcast the service for many years, and upon the formation of the British Broadcasting Corporation in 1927 was involved with negotiations with the Home Office, but these broke down and it was only permitted the following year in 1928. Adrian Gregory notes that the paradox of broadcasting two minute's silence was not lost on the BBC's sound engineers, who had to ensure that there was enough ambient sound (the \\"strange hush\\") to capture the solemnity of the moment. The ceremony was first broadcast by BBC Television in 1937 and again in 1938. Three EMI Super-Emitron cameras first used for the earliest outside broadcast of the Coronation Procession of King George VI in May 1937 were used, relayed via the BBC's Mobile Control Room scanner van, which two days earlier had also broadcast the Lord Mayor's Show for the first time. The BBC Television Service was suspended at the outbreak of World War II and the broadcast resumed in November 1946 when George VI unveiled the addition of the dates of that conflict (1939‚ÄîMCMXXXIX; and 1945‚ÄîMCMXLV) to the Cenotaph. It has been televised every year since, making the broadcast one of the longest-running live broadcasts in the world. In the post-war period, Wynford Vaughan-Thomas and latterly Richard Dimbleby were commentators. Tom Fleming commentated annually between 1966 and 1988. David Dimbleby, the eldest son of Richard Dimbleby, has commentated on the event since 1989.

As an angel investor he has invested in technology companies such as Houzz, Twilio, Warby Parker and Zocdoc. Background and early career Fluhr was born into a business- oriented family; his grandfather, Michael Kosof, owned a women's clothing store in Manhattan which he passed on to Fluhr's mother. His father was an engineering executive at AT&T.; Fluhr caught the entrepreneurial spirit as a boy, buying candy in large boxes from a wholesale distributor, and making a profit on it. Fluhr graduated with a dual degree in engineering and finance at the University of Pennsylvania. He won the Joseph Wharton Award for Young Leadership, presented by the Wharton Club of New York. After attending college he worked at the Blackstone Group in New York and then at Thomas Weisel Partners in San Francisco. Career While at Stanford Graduate School of Business, Fluhr entered the annual business plan competition with Eric Baker (later of Viagogo). Fluhr and Baker devised the idea of a website named \\"NeedATicket.com\\", where the public could buy and sell tickets for sporting events and concerts. The idea was so promising that Fluhr and Baker co-founded StubHub in March 2000 and then Fluhr dropped out of Stanford after his first year. Fluhr and Baker sought out investors in the music and sports industries and by August 2000 had raised $600,000 of seed capital for the new company. In 2003, StubHub started placing ads on Google Inc.'s search service. By 2006, StubHub had nearly 200 employees, had sold about $200 million worth of tickets, and had sponsorship agreements with 17 professional and college sports teams. Fluhr sold StubHub in 2007 to eBay for $310 million. In late 2011, Fluhr launched Spreecast, a social video platform which brings people together for face-face conversation. Spreecast integrated with social networks such as Facebook and Twitter. The company closed their website on July 14, 2016. Fluhr is a general partner of Craft.

Early life Tuckfield was the eldest son of Roger Tuckfield of Raddon Court, Devon, and his wife Margaret Davie, daughter of William Davie, barrister, of Dura, Devon. He succeeded his father to Raddon Court on his death in 1687. He matriculated at Exeter College, Oxford on 8 August 1700, aged 15. In 1702 his guardian, Sir William Davie, 4th Baronet, purchased the manor of Ashburton for him. Davie, a Whig and a patron of local Dissenters, died in 1707 before conveying it to Tuckfield, and so Tuckfield had to obtain an Act of Parliament early in 1708 to vest this and other estates in himself. Career Tuckfield was elected Member of Parliament for Ashburton at a hard-fought by-election on 21 January 1708, and again at the subsequent 1708 general election. Like his uncle, he was noted as a Whig, and voted in favour of naturalizing the Palatines in 1709, and for the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell in 1710. He was returned in 1710, but was unseated on petition on 17 March 1711. He regained his seat at the 1713 general election and voted on 18 March 1714 against the motion leading to the expulsion of Richard Steele. He was returned unopposed for Ashburton at the general election of 1715 as a Whig and voted for the repeal of the Occasional Conformity and Schism Acts in 1719. He was returned unopposed again in 1722 and was elected in contests in 1727 and 1734. Over these years he kept a low profile and there are no recorded votes by him. Death and legacy Tuckfield died unmarried on 26 March 1739. He left Ashburton to his sister Margaret, the wife of John Harris, on whose death in 1754 it was inherited by her daughter, by her first husband, Margaret Rolle, 15th Baroness Clinton, the wife of Robert Walpole, 2nd Earl of Orford. Raddon went to his cousin John Tuckfield. References .

She was active worker in the Woman's Missionary Association of her church, the United Brethren in Christ, and delivered lectures for the Women's Missionary Society. In 1880, she was one of the two delegates sent by the Association to the World's Missionary Conference in London, UK. She became the longest-serving president of the Association. Early years and education Lillian (\\"Lillie\\") A. Resler was born in Mount Pleasant, Pennsylvania, May 15, 1851. She was the first of seven children born to Rev. and Mrs. Jacob B. Resler. A brother was named John I.L. Ressler. Rev. Resler (d. 1891) was minister of the United Brethren in Christ church of that city. He, with only a small salary, moved to Westerville, Ohio, to give his children the benefit of Otterbein University, as soon as Keister was ready to enter, which was in 1866. She was graduated with the class of 1872. Career After completing her education, she became a school teacher. On August 19, 1875, at Westerville, she married Rev. George Keister (b. 1847), professor of Hebrew and Church History in United Theological Seminary, Dayton, Ohio, from 1875. They had no children. The early death, in August 1880, of her husband opened the way to her broader usefulness in church work. The church of her choice, the United Brethren in Christ, organized the Woman's Missionary Association in 1875, of which she was corresponding secretary for the first year. The work of the society grew and, in 1881, it called for the full-time of one woman as its corresponding secretary and to establish and edit its organ, the Woman's Evangel. Keister was the available woman well-qualified for the responsible position. She was unanimously elected, holding the position in 1875-76 and 1881‚Äì1893. Besides the work on the paper, much of her time was spent giving public addresses. Keister traveled a lot. One year, she traveled in association work over in the United States. Twice, she went on short trips abroad, first in 1884, when the illness of her sister studying in Germany called her there, and again in 1888, when she was one of two delegates sent by the Woman's Missionary Association to the World's Missionary Conference in London. Later years On June 14, 1893, she married William P. Harford (1834-1910). Keister served as President of the Omaha Woman's Club, Omaha, Nebraska. Between 1905 and 1927, she was president of the Woman's Missionary Association. From 1927 till her death, she served as the Association's honorary president. In 1921, with Alice Estella Bell, she published History of the Women's Missionary Association of the United Brethren in Christ. Death and legacy Keister died in 1935. The dedication and renaming of the First United Brethren Church of Omaha, Nebraska, at Nineteenth and Lothrop Streets, occurred December 5, 1909, the new name being \\"The Lillian Resler Harford Memorial United Brethren Church of Omaha\\". The Harford School for Girls (HSG), Moyamba, Sierra Leone is named in her honor.

Geologic History, Stratigraphy & Tectonics Israel is underlain by igneous and metamorphic crystalline basement rocks of the Arabian Craton formed during the Precambrian, although in places these rocks remain poorly studied. Precambrian rocks are only exposed in southern parts of the country, such as amphibolite at Makhtesh Gadol. Other Precambrian units include the Taba Gneiss, Roded and Elat schist, gneiss and migmatite, syenite, Duhayla Granodiorite, Darba Tonalite, Abu Saq'a Schist, Abu Barqa Metasedimens, Saramuj Conglomerate, Sammaniya Microgranite, Yutum Granite, Quani Diorite, Elat Conglomerate, rhyolite, gabbro and other basic rocks. Mantle-derived basalt magma ascended through rocks in the Timna Valley in southern Israel, providing the heat to form alkali granite, alkali rhyolite dikes and layered serptinized gabbro in the core of Har Timna. Paleozoic (541-251 million years ago) The Burj Dolomite Shale formation, which includes sandstone, dolomite and mudstone and the Umm Ishrin Sandstone formation both date to the Cambrian and appear in the stratigraphic record of central Israel. The region has little evidence of mid-Paleozoic rocks and sandstone, limestone, clay and gypsum represent most of the sequence from the Permian and Triassic. By contrast, southern Israel has Ordovician age rocks in the Disi Sandstone Formation. Other Paleozoic rock units such as the Yam Suf Group sandstone, conglomerate, mudstone, dolomite and limestone, Amudei Shelomo and Timna formations and Shehoret and Netafim formations (all from the Cambrian) also appear only in the south. Mesozoic (251-66 million years ago) Limestone up to 193 meters thick marks the Upper Jurassic in central Israel, followed by the basalt Tayasir volcanic rocks, the 120 meter Kurnub Group sandstone, limestone and clay, and 670 meters Nabi Sa'id, Ein el Esad, Hidra, Rama and Kefira formation marl, chalk, sandstone and limestone from the early Cretaceous. Basalt and basanite are both exposed from the Cretaceous in the north. Limestone, dolomite, chalk and marl formed during Turonian and Santonian times, chalk and chert during the Campanian. The Mishash Formation of the same age contains similar rocks, 86 meters thick, but also phosphorite. The Hatrurim Formation, or \\"Mottled Zone,\\" encompasses metamorphosed Maastrichtian through Miocene rocks. In places the Mesozoic was a time of microgabbro and diabase intrusion. Cenozoic (66 million years ago- present) Chalk, marl and clay of the Mount Scopus Group formed from the Senonian into the Paleocene, in the Cenozoic. Paleogene times saw the deposition of the 150 meter Adulam Formation chert and chalk, 350 meter limestone of the Timrat, Meroz and Yizre'el formations, 100 meter Maresha Formation chalk and the similar Avedat Group and Bet Guvrin Formation‚Äîall in the Eocene. The 40 meter Lakhish Formation limestone, 230 meter, sandstone, mudstone siltstone and conglomerate of the Hordos and Umm Sabun formations and the 50 meter Ziqlaq Formation limestone deposited in the Miocene. Intermediate basalt erupted during the same time period. Pliocene rocks include 30 meters of marl in the Yafo Formation and marl, conglomerate and sandstone 20 meters thick in the Bira, Gesher and Pleshet formations. Conglomerate and volcanic rocks mark the transition to the Quaternary. During the last 2.5 million years, sandstone, mudstone, oolitic limestone, conglomerate, gypsum and aragonite varves were deposited as well as travertine, calcareous sandstone, red sand loam and alluvium. Recent sands and alluvium dominates most river valleys and coastal areas, while conglomerate, gravel and playa deposits are more common in the south. Basalt and basanite continued to erupt in the north. Natural resource geology *Salt: Salt is an essential commodity and has been used in the past as an important currency. Mount Sodom was used for salt mining in prehistoric times, and archeological excavations uncovered installations for the loading of salt from the Roman period. In the modern era, salt production plants were built in Atlit, Eilat and mainly in the Dead Sea. The salt is produced by the process of solar evaporation in ponds and seawater desalination. *Potash: Potassium chloride is a rich fertilizer for agricultural crops and is produced in the south of the Dead Sea. During the production process, bromine-rich solutions remained in the evaporation pools - used in medicine, industry and cosmetics - but its production ceased after it was discovered that this substance emitted ozone gas into the atmosphere. *Phosphates: Phosphate deposits have been discovered since 1950 in several areas in the south of the country, mainly in the craters in the Negev and near Arad. *Copper: Copper is mined from shafts in the Timna Valley *Magnesium - A high concentration of magnesium with high purity made Israel one of the most important sources of its production. Magnesium is used in construction, in pharmaceuticals and as a food ingredient for animals. *Manganese: Manganese ore was discovered found in the Timna Valley, but not in economical quantities *Iron : There are few concentrations of iron ore in the Galilee, Beit Netofa Valley, at the foot of Mount Tabor and several sites in the Negev, but these remain unexploited.

Biography Although Mike Wilson was born in the United States, most of his childhood and adolescence were spent in South America. When he was three years old, he arrived in Chile with his American father and Argentine mother; at seven they moved to Asunci√≥n, Paraguay, and finally settled in Buenos Aires, where Wilson would attend some primary school and receive all of his secondary education. The family returned to the United States after his father became a diplomat during the presidency of Jimmy Carter, and Wilson entered Cornell University in New York, where he studied Hispanic Literature and met Edmundo Paz Sold√°n. He returned to Chile in 2005 after receiving his doctorate, and obtained a position as professor of English Literature at the Catholic University. Since then he has resided in that country. He published the novel Nachtr√≥polis in 2003. Wilson defined it as \\"an alternate history set in the 40s in a version of Buenos Aires overflown by German Zeppelins and under a Per√≥n government controlled by the Reich.\\" Five years later El p√∫gil was released, a text in which \\"the references range from the work and life of Roberto Arlt to the aesthetics of Blade Runner, and from the classic trans- Andean comic book The Eternaut to the voice of Orson Welles reading The War of the Worlds.\\" His 2009 post-apocalyptic novel Zombie tells the story of some teenagers who have survived the destruction of La Avellana, a neighborhood that could well be Santiago's La Dehesa, with a \\"devastating panorama of once perfect houses with perfect courtyards for perfect families.\\" The boys who survive, \\"abandoned to their fate, end up behaving like zombies addicted to methamphetamine.\\" Wilson with the writers Diego Z√∫√±iga and Jorge Baradit at the GAM, April 2015 On the eve of publishing his second novel, Wilson was signed by Guillermo Schavelzon's agency, which meant moving from the small publisher Forja to Alfaguara, who released his third novel, Rockabilly (2011). Journalist Alberto Rojas described it as \\"a terrifying trip to those places away from the big American cities that Wilson knows well, where men and women live in search of their broken dreams, in the midst of nights that seem never to end.\\" In Letras Libres, wrote that \\"the best of contemporary Latin American narrative is brewing away from the center and near the periphery,\\" and that a good example of this thesis are these two novels by \\"Wilson, rara avis that has decided to return to the bustle of the downtown ‚Äì read literary ‚Äì establishment to face the apparent suburban stillness with a look full of concern, and I say and emphasize 'apparent', because in the powerful suburban diptych composed of Zombie and Rockabilly [...] that peace goes on to reveal a substratum of contained violence that ends up emerging in unsuspected and openly disturbing ways.\\" FILSA 2015 His fifth novel, Le√±ador (2013), marked a turn in several ways. \\"I was interested in the possibility of writing without narrating, without the necessary action that everyone expects,\\" explained Wilson, who said that this would be the last work of fiction he would publish. The author \\"resigned to a position of privilege in the national literary medium,\\" and ended his link with agent Guillermo Schavelzon and Alfaguara to publish his novel with a small Chilean label, Orjikh. In addition, he shut down his blog and his Facebook account; his name does not appear on the cover of the book. As the critic and writer Patricio Jara said, \\"a peaceful and silent retreat, just like the retirement of the woodcutter\\" who stars in the novel. Jos√© Promis, meanwhile, explained that, \\"to carry out his desacralizador y rupturista project, Mike Wilson has drawn on elements characteristic of popular culture, peripheral culture during the golden age of the great continental narratives.\\" After publishing Le√±ador, Wilson declared that he had abandoned fiction, and his next book, Wittgenstein y el sentido t√°cito de las cosas (2014) seemed to confirm this decision; however, he later returned to narrative. In 2016 he wrote Scout, \\"a story quite traditional in its narrative,\\" which he published in fanzine format. Early the following year he released √Årtico: una lista with Fiordo, a small Buenos Aires publishing house that had reissued Le√±ador. The text ‚Äì which in his words \\"is an inventory of impressions, a nouvelle in verse, a long poem, a list\\" ‚Äì was written in 2015 in Ushuaia, on a trip to Argentine Patagonia. \\"At the time I wrote, Le√±ador, I did not want anything to do with narrative. I needed to get away and I did not want to continue publishing fiction; it was what I honestly felt at that moment and I still think a little,\\" said Wilson about his return to fiction, recognizing that he \\"cheated\\" after that novel when writing Scout. He explains this act as, \\"a way of not being on the official circuit, the same as publishing in Argentina. That distance calms me down, now I publish again, but √Årtico is not a conventional narrative. I enjoy writing ‚Äì it makes me well, it is necessary ‚Äì but the process that comes after, not so much; working with publishers and promotion in the media are not situations in which I feel very comfortable.\\" Works At FILSA 2015 * Nachtr√≥polis, novel, Editorial Ambros√≠a, Buenos Aires, 2003 * El p√∫gil, novel, Editorial Forja, Santiago, 2008 * Zombie, novel, Alfaguara, Santiago, 2009 * Rockabilly, novel, Alfaguara, Santiago, 2011 * Where Is My Mind?

Seen in various forms, often by night, many are old, similar to ogres and witches, sometimes with walrus teeth. Supposed to live in caverns, under the beach and under the sea, the ' has power over the forces of nature and can change its shape. It is mainly known as a malevolent figure, largely because of √âmile Souvestre's story La Groac'h de l'√Æle du Lok, in which the fairy seduces men, changes them into fish and serves them as meals to her guests, on one of the Gl√©nan Islands. Other tales present them as old solitary fairies who can overwhelm with gifts the humans who visit them. Several place- names of Lower Brittany are connected with the ', especially the names of some megaliths in C√¥tes-d'Armor, as well as the island of Groix in Morbihan and the lighthouse of La Vieille. The origin of those fairies that belong to the archetype of \\"the crone\\" is to be found in the ancient female divinities demonized by Christianity. The influence of Breton writers in the 19th century brought them closer to the classical fairy figure. The ' has several times appeared in recent literary works, such as Nicolas Br√©hal's La P√¢leur et le Sang (1983).  Etymology  According to Philippe Le Stum, originally ' seems to have been the Breton word for fairies in general. It evolved to mean an old creature of deceptive beauty. It is often spelled \\"'\\", the final consonant being pronounced like the German ch. One of the possible plurals is '. According to Joseph Rio the assimilation of the ' with the fairy is more the result of the influence of √âmile Souvestre's tale, and commentaries on it, than a belief deriving from the popular traditions of Lower Brittany: \\"The Groac'h of Lok Island\\", a story intended for literate audiences, uses a writing technique based on the interchangeable use of the words \\"fairy\\" and \\"'\\". Anatole Le Braz comments on this name that \\"' is used in good and bad senses by turns. It can mean an old witch or simply an old woman.\\"  Characteristics  The ' are the fairies most often encountered in Brittany, generally in forests and near springs: they are essentially the fairies of Breton wells. Likewise, a certain number of \\"sea fairies\\" bear the name of ', sometimes interchangeably with those of \\"morgen\\" or \\"siren\\". speaks (1825) of a malicious creature that he was frightened of as a child, reputed to inhabit wells in which it drowned those children that fell in. It is possible that Souvestre drew the evil characteristics of \\"his\\" ' from Mah√©, and indeed he admits in his notes a certain reinvention of tradition.  Appearance  The ' sometimes displays long teeth like those of a walrus. Because of their multiform character, the ' are hard to define. One of them is said to frequent the neighborhood of Kerodi, but the descriptions vary: an old woman bent and leaning on a crutch, or a richly dressed princess, accompanied by korrigans. Often the descriptions insist on its likeness to an old woman; Fran√ßoise Morvan mentions the name \\"beetle-fairy\\". She notes cases where the ' have exceptionally long \\"walrus\\" teeth, which may be the length of a finger or may even drag along the ground, though in other cases they have no such teeth, or at any rate nothing is said of them. Sometimes they are hunchbacked. The storyteller Pierre Dubois describes them as shapeshifters capable of taking on the most flattering or the most repugnant appearance: swans or wrinkled, peering hobgoblins. He attributes green teeth to them, or more rarely red, as well as \\"a coat of scales\\". For Morvan, the variety of these descriptions is a result of two phenomena. On the one hand, it is possible that these fairies change their appearance as they age, to become like warty frogs. On the other hand, a Russian tradition reported by Andrei Sinyavsky has the fairies go through cycles of rejuvenation and ageing according to the cycles of the moon: a similar tradition may have existed in Brittany.  Attributes and character  Pierre Dubois compares the ' to an ogress or a \\"water-witch\\". relates it rather to undines, Richard Ely and Am√©lie Tsaag Valren to witches, √âdouard Brasey describes it as a \\"lake fairy\\". Be that as it may, the ' is one of the most powerful fairies in Breton waters. In its aquatic habitat, as on land, it has power over the elements. The ' of Lanascol Castle could shake the dead autumn leaves and turn them to gold, or bend the trees and make the ponds ripple as it passed. Although it is mostly known by negative representations, the ' is not necessarily bad. It may politely receive humans in its lair and offer treasure, magical objects (most often in threes), and cures. Like many other fairies, it also takes care of laundry and spinning. They are overbearing, but generally full of good intentions. Most often, the ' are described as being solitary in their retreats under the sea, in a rock or in the sands, but some stories tell of an entirely female family life. They do not abandon their children or leave changelings. Sometimes they are accompanied by a green water horse and a pikeman. They are more inconstant and more sensitive than other Breton fairies, taking offence easily. In Finist√®re, ' reveal to miners the existence of silver-bearing lead.  Stories and collected legends  Several collections report a ' in one or another place in Brittany. Souvestre evokes one of these fairies, likened to a naiad, in a well in Vannes: this legend seems to have been quite popular in its day, and could have the same sources as the tale of the fairy of the well. It belongs to the theme of \\"spinners by the fountain\\" in the Aarne-Thompson classification. A story collected by Anatole Le Braz makes one of these fairies the personification of the plague: an old man from Plestin finds a ' who asks for his help in crossing a river. He carries it, but it becomes more and more heavy, so that he sets it back down it where he found it, thereby preventing an epidemic of plague in the Lannion district. Fran√ßois-Marie Luzel also brings together several traditions around the ', that people would shun them as they would Ankou. Some are known to have the power of changing into foals, or again to haunt the forest of Coat-ann-noz (the wood of the night). The duke's pond in Vannes would house a ', a former princess who threw herself into the water to flee a too importunate lover, and who would sometimes be seen combing her long blonde hair with a golden comb.  La Groac'h de l'√éle du Lok  Houarn in the s magic boat. Engraving after , from Contes et l√©gendes de Basse-Bretagne (1891). The most famous story evoking a ' is La Groac'h de l'√éle du Lok, collected, written and arranged by √âmile Souvestre for his book Le Foyer breton (1844). Houarn Pogamm and Bellah Postik, orphan cousins, grow up together in Lannilis and fall in love, but they are poor, so Houarn leaves to seek his fortune. Bellah gives him a little bell and a knife, but keeps a third magic object for herself, a wand. Houarn arrives at Pont- Aven and hears about the groac'h of , a fairy who inhabits a lake on the largest of the Gl√©nan Islands, reputed to be as rich as all the kings on earth put together. Houarn goes to the island of Lok and gets into an enchanted boat in the shape of a swan, which takes him underwater to the home of the groac'h. This beautiful woman asks him what he wants, and Houarn replies that he is looking for the wherewithal to buy a little cow and a lean hog. The fairy offers him some enchanted wine to drink and asks him to marry her. He accepts, but when he sees the groac'h catch and fry fish which moan in the pan he begins to be afraid and regrets his decision. The groac'h gives him the dish of fried fish and goes away to look for wine. Houarn draws his knife, whose blade dispels enchantments. All the fish stand up and become little men. They are victims of the groac'h, who agreed to marry her before being metamorphosed and served as dinner to the other suitors. Houarn tries to escape but the groac'h comes back and throws at him the steel net she wears on her belt, which turns him into a frog. The bell that he carries on his neck rings, and Bellah hears it at Lannilis. She takes hold of her magic wand, which turns itself into a fast pony, then into a bird to cross the sea. At the top of a rock, Bellah finds a little black korandon, the groac'h's husband, and he tells her of the fairy's vulnerable point. The korandon offers Bellah men's clothes to disguise herself in. She goes to the groac'h, who is very happy to receive such a beautiful boy and yields to the request of Bellah, who would like to catch her fish with the steel net. Bellah throws the net on the fairy, cursing her thus: \\"Become in body what you are in heart!\\". The groac'h changes into a hideous creature, the queen of mushrooms, and is thrown into a well. The metamorphosed men and the korandon are saved, and Bellah and Houarn take the treasures of the fairy, marry and live happily ever after. For the scholar Joseph Rio this tale is important documentary evidence on the character of the groac'h. Souvestre explained why he chose to place it on the island of Lok by the multiplicity of versions of the storytellers which do so. La Groac'h de l'√Æle du Lok was even more of a success in Germany than it had been in Brittany. Heinrich Bode published it under the title of Die Wasserhexe in 1847,Blanchard, Nelly \\"Le succ√®s d‚Äô√âmile Souvestre dans le monde germanophone\\", in and it was republished in 1989 and 1993.Blanchard, Nelly \\"Le succ√®s d‚Äô√âmile Souvestre dans le monde germanophone\\", in The story was likewise translated into English (The Groac'h of the Isle) and published in The Lilac Fairy Book in 1910. Between 1880 and 1920 it served as study material for British students learning French.Le Disez, Jean-Yves \\"Souvestre tel qu‚Äôil sera en anglais, ou la prolif√©ration m√©tatextuelle de l‚Äô≈ìuvre dans le monde anglophone\\", in  The Groac'h of the Spring  This tale, collected by Joseph Frison around 1914, tells of a young girl who goes one night to a spring to help her mother. She discovers that a ' lives there. The fairy tells her never to come back by night, otherwise she will never see her mother again. The mother falls ill, and the girl returns to draw some water in the night in spite of the prohibition. The ' catches the girl and keeps her in its cave, which has every possible comfort. Although she is separated from her family the girl is happy there. A young ' comes to guard her while the ' of the spring is away visiting one of its sisters. She dies while with her sister, having first sent a message to the young ': the girl is free to leave if she wishes. Knowing that the home of the ' is much more comfortable than her own, the girl asks for a key so that she can enter or leave at her own convenience. The young ' has her wait for one month, while the elder sister dies. She then gives her two keys, with instructions never to stay outside after sunset. The little girl meets one of her family while out walking, but resolves to return early to keep her promise. Later she meets a very handsome young man, whom she leaves, promising to come back the next day. The ' advises her to marry him, assuring her that this will lift the prohibition on her returning after sunset. She follows this advice and lives happily ever after with her new husband.  The Fairy of the Well /  According to this recent story (collected by Th√©ophile Le Gra√´t in 1975), a widower with a daughter marries a black-skinned woman who has a daughter, also black. The new bride treats her stepdaughter very badly, and demands she spin all day long. One day, when near a well, the girl encounters an old walrus-toothed fairy who offers her new clothes, heals her fingers, goes to her place and offers to share its house with her. She eagerly moves in and is very happy there. When eventually she announces that she wants to leave, the fairy gives her a magic stone. She goes back to her stepmother's home where, with her new clothes, no- one recognizes her. With the fairy stone she can get everything she wants. The black girl becomes jealous and throws herself down the well in the hope of getting the same gifts, but the fairy only gives her a thistle. The black girl wishes for the greatest prince in the world to appear so that he can ask for her hand in marriage, but it is the Devil who appears and carries her away. In the end the good girl returns to her home in the well, and sometimes she can be heard singing.Th√©ophile Le Gra√´t, 1975. Cited by  The Sea Fairies / '  This tale takes place on the island of Groagez (the \\"island of women\\" or the \\"fairy island\\"), which Paul S√©billot describes as being the home of an old woman who is a spinner and a witch; it is in Tr√©gor, one kilometer from Port- Blanc. According to this tale, collected by G. Le Calvez at the end of the 19th century, a ', \\"sea fairy\\", lives in a hollow rock on the island. A woman happens to pass by, and comes across the old fairy spinning with her distaff. The ' invites the woman to approach it and gives her its distaff, instructing her that it will bring her her fortune, but that she must tell no-one about it. The woman goes home and quickly becomes rich thanks to the distaff, the thread of which never runs out and is much finer in quality than all others. But the temptation to speak about it becomes too great for her. The moment she reveals that the distaff comes from a fairy all the money she has earned from it disappears.  The Fairy of Lanascol / '  This story was collected by Anatole Le Braz, who makes reference to the belief in fairies among people of his acquaintance living near his friend Walter Evans-Wentz. A ruined manor house called Lanascol Castle is said to have housed a fairy known as '. One day, the landowners put up for sale a part of the estate where they no longer live. A notary from Plouaret conducts the auction, during which prices go up very high. Suddenly, a gentle yet imperious female voice makes a bid raising the price by a thousand francs. All the attendants look to see who spoke, but there is no woman in the room. The notary then asks loudly who bid, and the female voice answers '. Everyone flees. Since then, according to Le Braz, the estate has never found a buyer.  Localities, place-names and religious practices  The Grand Menhir, called ', at Locmariaquer Many place-names in Lower Brittany are attributed to a '. The Grand Menhir, called ', at Locmariaquer probably owes its name to an amalgamation of the Breton word for \\"cave\\", ', with the word '. Pierre Saintyves cites from the same commune a \\"table of the old woman\\", a dolmen called '. At Ma√´l-Pestivien three stones two meters high placed next to each other in the village of Kermorvan, are known by the name of Ty-ar-Groac'h, or \\"the house of the fairy\\". In 1868, an eight-meter menhir called ' was destroyed in Plourac'h. In Cavan, the tomb of the \\"groac'h Ah√®s\\", or \\"'\\", has become attributed not to the ' but to the giant . There is a Tombeau de la Groac'h Rouge (Tomb of the Red ') in Prat, attributed to a \\"red fairy\\" that brought the stones in her apron. This megalith is however almost destroyed. According to Souvestre and the Celtomaniac (1853), the island of Groix got its name (in Breton) from the ', described by them as \\"druidesses\\" now seen as old women or witches. For the writer Claire de Marnier this tradition, which makes the islanders sons of witches, is a \\"remarkable belief\\" peculiar to \\"the Breton soul\\".This etymology connecting Groix and the ' is only one possibility among several others. See Fr√©d√©ric Le Tallec, \\"√Ä propos de l'√©tymologie de Groix\\" in La Chaloupe de l'√Æle, the journal of the island of Groix, 1984. The rock of Croac'h Coz, or \\"the island of the old fairy\\", in the commune of Plougrescant, was the home of an old ' who would engage in spinning from time to time. S√©billot relates that the fishermen of Loguivy (in Ploubazlanec) once feared to pass near the cave named Toul ar Groac'h, \\"fairy hole\\", and preferred to spend the night under their beached boats until the next tide, rather than risk angering the fairy. Similarly, Anatole Le Braz cites Barr-ann-Heol near Penv√©nan, as a dangerous place where a ' keeps watch, ready to seize benighted travellers at a crossroads.. In Ushant many place-names refer to it, including the Pointe de la Groac'h and the lighthouse of La Vieille, in reference, according to Georges Gu√©nin, to \\"a kind of witch\\". Some traces of possible religious invocation of these fairies are known. says that the sick once came to rub the pre-Christian statue called Groac'h er goard (or Groac'h ar Goard ) so as to be healed. The seven-foot-tall granite statue known as the Venus of Quinipily represents a naked woman of \\"indecent form\\" and could be a remnant of the worship of Venus or Isis.  Analysis  The ' is close to the archetypal character of \\"the Crone\\" (here, a representation of Baba Yaga). According to Marc Gontard, the ' demonstrates the demonization of ancient goddesses under the influence of Christianity: it was changed to a witch just as other divinities became lost girls and mermaids. Its palace under the waves is a typical motif of fairy tales and folk-stories, which is also found in, for example, the texts of the Arthurian legend, Irish folklore and several Hispanic tales. Pierre Dubois likens the ' to many maleficent water-fairies, like Peg Powler, Jenny Greenteeth, the ' and the green ogresses of Cosges, who drag people underwater to devour them. Joseph Rio included it in a global evolution of Breton fairies between 1820 and 1850, so that from small, dark- skinned, wrinkled creatures close to the korrigans, in the texts of the scholars of the time they more and more often become pretty women of normal size, probably to compete with the Germanic fairies. The ' has been likened to the enigmatic and archetypal character of \\"the Crone\\", studied by various folklorists. This name, in French ', is often applied to megaliths. Edain McCoy equates the ' with ', citing especially the regular translation of the word as \\"witch\\". She adds that several Breton tales present this creature in a negative way, while none draw a flattering portrait.  In literature  A ' appears in the novel La P√¢leur et le Sang published by Nicolas Br√©hal in 1983. This horrible witch, feared by the fishermen, lays a curse on the Bowley family. A \\"mystical and fantastic\\" novel, La P√¢leur et le Sang includes the ' among the mysterious and almost diabolical forces that assail the island of Vindilis. This old woman is portrayed as having \\"magical and evil powers\\", and as threatening with reprisals those characters who offend her. Her murder is one of the causes of the misfortunes that hit the island. A ' also appears in Absinthes & D√©mons, a collection of short stories by Amber Dubois published in 2012. In Jean Teul√©'s novel Fleur de tonnerre (2013), ' is a nickname given to H√©l√®ne J√©gado when she is a little girl, in Plouhinec.

It won an honorary Coretta Scott King Award in 2009.  Synopsis  Through a series of poems, Weatherford outlines the evolution from Eleanora Fagan to renowned singer Billie Holiday. Told from Billie's own perspective, she muses on the first 25 years of her life. Most poems are titled after actual Billie Holiday songs. The book starts with poems about her young life. Detailing events like her father's abandonment, her tomboyish attitude, and her time spent in an orphanage with nuns. It continues into her adolescence with poems about her first gig singing jazz, deciding to change her name, and her many relationships with men. Weatherford's book ends with Holiday's rising fame and the tension of racism in the United States. The last poem illustrates Holiday's memorable performance at the Caf√© Society, singing the song \\"Strange Fruit.\\" At the end of the book, there are pages giving information for further reading and biographies of others mentioned in the poems.  Background  In the book's afterword, Weatherford talks about her childhood listening to jazz music with her father. As a teenager, she started listening to more popular music at the time until she watched the film Lady Sings the Blues in 1972. From then on, she was listening to and collecting Holiday's music all the time. Weatherford related to much of Holiday's life: a shared hometown of Baltimore, a difficult love life, and navigating the realities of racism. Before writing the poems, the author would listen to early Billie Holiday songs for weeks. For the factual parts of the story, Weatherford referenced oral histories and Holiday's autobiography. She hoped the book would inspire readers to learn more about the singer, as well as cross over to an adult audience. Weatherford has written several other books about jazz musicians. Floyd Cooper created the illustrations in the book using an eraser to make subtractive shapes in paint. He also used other mediums on top that were oil based, all put on with a drybrush technique.  Reception  Critics reviewed Becoming Billie Holiday very favorably. In a starred Kirkus review, they praise both Weatherford's \\"remarkable tribute\\" as well as illustrator Floyd Cooper's beautiful images. Another Kirkus reviewer was impressed with the rich writing of the poems, and felt it was a perfect tribute to such a celebrated singer. Booklist noted that Weatherford's book was \\"proud, and clear-toned.\\" A starred review in the School Library Journal points out the perfect background soundtrack in the novel, praising Weatherford's choice to use song titles as poem titles. The reviewer comments on the author's way of capturing Holiday's \\"jazzy, candid voice so adroitly that at times the poems seem like the could have been lifted...from Holiday's autobiography...\\" She continues to marvel at Cooper's images that invoke real emotions paired with the words. The book was awarded the honorary Coretta Scott King Award in 2009.

Family Born in Stepney, London, Somes was the youngest son of Samuel Somes (1758‚Äì1816) and Sarah n√©e Green. In 1811, he married Mary Ann Daplyn, daughter of Thomas Daplyn of Stepney, and they had one surviving daughter. However, after her death in 1835, he remarried to Maria Saxton in 1837. Saxton was the daughter of Charles Saxton and sister of Charles Waring Saxton, an early migrant to New Zealand, and Somes' lawyer, Edward Saxton. Maritime career Somes' early life saw him apprenticed to his father as a lighterman and then, at the age of 15, sent to sea, working in the coal and coastal trades. At age 21, he became a captain of one of his father's ships, then remaining at sea until 1816 and developing his knowledge of worldwide shipping and navigation. Upon his father's death in 1818, the firm was extremely prosperous and he became a partner with his elder brother, Samuel, continuing to run the business in a financially successful way, even during difficult post-war years. By the time of his brother's death, Somes was operating as owner, sailmaker and chandler, as well as a charterer, especially for the East India Company. In the 1830s, under Somes' sole ownership, the firm became one of the largest in Britain, and Somes took advantage of the breakup of the East India Company's fleet to purchase a number of its best ships, including the Lowther Castle and Earl of Balcarres. The firm's ships sailed mostly to the East Indies but also began to operate newly in Australasia, including whaling. They also travelled to Africa, The Americas, and the Baltic, but less often. By 1842, Somes' fleet spanned to at least 40 ships, and he was the largest private shipowner in the world‚Äîsometimes chartering ships to the government to transport convicts, stores, and troops. As a consequence of his career, Somes developed an interest in the British colonies, investing in the Western Australia Company and the North American Colonisation Society of Ireland. Mostly, however, he invested in the New Zealand Company, which he joined when it refounded in 1838, and then sold to it its first ship, the Tory ‚Äî which was sent to New Zealand in 1839 with a shipload of settlers, but without governmental permission. He then became a governor of the company in 1840, in which role he spearheaded an aggressive campaign to secure government recognition for the company, gaining financial concessions but no central role in the country's colonisation. Somes was well known at the London Stock Exchange, an originator of the Lloyds Register of Shipping in 1834, and active within the General Shipowners' Society. He was frequently called to give evidence to government inquiries. In his later years, however, allies of his believed he would betray the company, which was close to collapse upon his death in 1845. Member of parliament After unsuccessfully contesting Great Yarmouth at the 1841 general election, Somes was elected Member of Parliament for Dartmouth at a by-election in 1844‚Äîcaused by the death of Sir John Henry Seale, 1st Baronet. Entering parliament required him to transfer ownership of his ships to his nephews, or he would have been disqualified as a government contractor. Somes held the seat for just six months until his death in 1845. Death Somes died on 25 June 1845 at his home on Mile End Road, London, and was then buried in the family vault of St Dunstan's in Stepney on 2 July. He had an estimated wealth of ¬£434,000.

Carboniferous rocks from the Paleozoic appear in the north, in the vicinity of Hakem and El-Gharb. Mesozoic (251-66 million years ago) In the Mesozoic, an ophiolite zone with serptenized peridotite, diabase, spilite, pillow lava, tuff, argillite and radiolarite formed in the north and is present in northern Latakia close to the Turkish border. Mesozoic rocks tend to be more numerous in the region, such as Jurassic limestone, marl, anhydrite and gypsum common in the west. Basalt at the base marks the beginning of the Cretaceous, ascending into clay, limestone, sandstone and dolomite from the Turonian and Cenomanian. Campanian are marked by detrital limestone with flint interbeds and chalk, while chalky limestone and marl are characteristic of the Maastrichtian. Cenozoic (66 million years ago- present) At the beginning of the Cenozoic, chalk, limestone, marl and clay deposition continued through the Paleocene and Eocene. The Oligocene brought a shift to sandstone and limestone. In the early Miocene, conglomerates became more common and quartz sands of continental origin appeared in the Palmyrides mountain belt. Some basalts erupted during the Helvetian. The Tortonian has limestone, marl and conglomerate in the northwest and similar units plus clay, salt, and gypsum in the Al-Furat Basin.

The Moore Memorial Public Library in Texas City, Texas, is named after her. Early life and early days in Texas City Born as Sepha Helen Edmunds, she was the daughter of mechanical engineer J. H. Edmunds. She was born in Black River Falls, Wisconsin, on January 3, 1881. She worked as a nurse in Kansas City, married a railroad man whom she had treated there, and moved with him to Texas City, Texas in late 1905. She continued to work as a nurse in Texas City, providing the town's only medical care until 1907, when a doctor moved to the town. She also founded a reading room, a precursor to the town library, in 1914, and became founder and first president of the Texas City Red Cross in 1916. Her Red Cross unit helped supply bandages to American soldiers in Europe. Suffrage and activism Moore helped campaign for women's right to vote in Texas, working for a 1915 constitutional amendment that failed to pass. She became an officer in the Texas Equal Suffrage Association, which became the Texas League of Women Voters in 1919 after the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution giving women the right to vote nationally. In 1923, she became president of the Texas League of Women Voters. In the US presidential elections of 1924 and 1928 she was one of Texas's delegates to the national conventions, She was a supporter of Miriam A. Ferguson as Texas governor, in part because of Ferguson's anti-Ku Klux Klan position and in part for her progressive social politics. She also supported the 1928 presidential campaign of Al Smith. Legislature She was elected to the Texas House of Representatives in 1928, 1930, and 1934, in the 17th district. She writes \\"I decided to run for the legislature in 1929 because I thought a woman could pass some good laws.\\" Her defeat in the 1932 primary was caused in part by miscommunications regarding alcohol prohibition, and in the 1934 campaign she was victorious after taking a stand against prohibition. As a legislator she worked to establish a state mental hospital and remove the mentally ill from the jails, to improve the state hospital and orphanage systems, to found the state board of education, to outlaw child labor, and to reduce working hours for women from 54 hours per week to 48 hours. Legacy Her residence, the Col. Hugh B. and Helen Moore House in Texas City, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

His mother and elder brother died when he was young and he became heir apparent to the Viscountcy. He was subject to the high expectations of his father. He was educated at Eton College in 1698 and was admitted at Inner Temple in 1701 and matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford on 3 November 1702. In 1706, he travelled abroad in Italy, and that year attended Padua University. In 1710, he was called to the bar. Harcourt was elected as Member of Parliament for Wallingford at the 1710 general election. He was abroad, probably for his health for most of the first half of 1713 and missed the campaign for the 1713 general election. His father had put him forward for Oxfordshire, Oxford University where he was awarded MA at Oxford in the previous year, Wallingford and Abingdon. He was only returned for Abingdon where he was unopposed. He was defeated at the 1715 general election. Harcourt remained in poor health and took the waters in Wales and abroad. He died in Paris on 1 July 1720, apparently from liver damage through drinking too much burgundy and champagne and was buried at Stanton Harcourt. Family and issue On 21 July 1709, Harcourt married Elizabeth Evelyn (died 1760), daughter of John Evelyn of Wootton, Surrey, and sister of his Eton schoolfriend, Sir John Evelyn, 1st Baronet. He left one surviving son and two surviving daughters. His son succeeded as 2nd Viscount in 1727 and in 1749 was created Earl Harcourt. One daughter, Martha, married George Venables-Vernon, 1st Baron Vernon.

He was sold as a child to Japanese envoys in 1496, but came back to Ming China in 1509 and 1523 as an envoy of the Hosokawa clan. In the latter mission to China, he became embroiled in the Ningbo Incident where the rival mission sent by the ≈åuchi clan attacked him and plundered the cities of Ningbo and Shaoxing. Song Suqing was judged to have caused the incident and was thrown in jail where he died. Early life: the 1496 mission Song Suqing was born in Yin County (ÈÑûÁ∏£; present-day Yinzhou, Zhejiang) with the name Zhu Gao (Êú±Á∏û). Because his father had died, he stayed with his uncle Zhu Cheng (Êú±ÊæÑ), who worked as a lacquerware merchant. To support himself, Zhu Gao learned to sing and performed on the streets as a child. In 1496, he caught the attention of T≈çshigor≈ç (ÊπØÂõõ‰∫îÈÉé), a Japanese dealer who came with that year's tributary mission. At the time, the Japanese could only trade with China through the Chinese tributary system, where foreign envoys would present tribute to the Ming emperor in return for gifts from the emperor. Additionally, once the Japanese envoys landed at Ningbo, their designated port, they would have the opportunity to engage in trade with the local merchants in a controlled environment. This was how T≈çshigor≈ç chanced upon Zhu Gao in Yin County, near Ningbo, where he was impressed by the boy's voice and charms and started a close relationship with him. T≈çshigor≈ç then entrusted Zhu Gao and his uncle to sell his merchandise of Japanese swords and fans in return for Chinese lacquerware. For some reason Zhu Cheng could not uphold his end of the deal by the time the Japanese envoys were scheduled to return to Japan. By all accounts the Japanese goods were successfully sold, but the money from the transaction was squandered (either by himself or by another middleman) and Zhu Cheng could not fulfill the order of lacquerware. To prevent the Japanese from going to the authorities, Zhu Cheng settled the matter with T≈çshigor≈ç by handing over his nephew Zhu Gao as an indemnity. The boy was taken to Japan. Rise to fame: the 1509 mission In Japan, Zhu Gao became known as Song Suqing. The Chinese source Shuyu Zhouzi Lu (ÊÆäÂüüÂë®Âí®ÈåÑ) says the new name comes from the fact that his surname Zhu Êú± was written like the character Song ÂÆã, while \\"Suqing\\" Á¥†Âçø shares the meaning of his name \\"Gao\\" Á∏û, which means \\"plain white silk\\". The Japanese source Sanetaka-k≈ç ki (ÂÆüÈöÜÂÖ¨Ë®ò) records that Zhu Gao considered \\"Suqing\\" his courtesy name, and this was what he identified himself by. Since disembarking the Japanese envoy ship in the port city of Sakai, Song Suqing became somewhat of a celebrity for his talent in song and poetry. Despite not knowing how to speak Japanese at first, he was able to communicate with the locals in writing, since Japan and China shared the same written language at the time. He was recruited into the service of the Hosokawa clan and was especially close with the daimy≈ç Hosokawa Masamoto and the sh≈çgun Ashikaga Yoshizumi. He was even granted a position in the Ministry of the Imperial Household (Âè∏Ëæ≤Âçø) and gained access into the imperial court in Kyoto. Chinese sources say that he was so respected that he was given the hand of \\"the daughter of the king\\", but since Japan did not have a king and Japanese sources did not corroborate this account, it is unclear whom he married. He had ten sons, amongst them one variously called Song Dongzhan (ÂÆãÊù±Áûª) or Song Yi (ÂÆã‰∏Ä) who eventually followed his father's footsteps as an envoy. The Hosokawa was one of two clans who had the privilege to represent the Ashikaga sh≈çgun to trade in China. In 1508, the other clan with this privilege, the ≈åuchi, helped the exiled sh≈çgun Ashikaga Yoshitane reclaim his position from Ashikaga Yoshizumi, who was supported by the Hosokawa. As a result, the ≈åuchi was rewarded with the right to send two ships to China and the Hosokawa only one. The Hosokawa, unhappy about this arrangement, pre-empted the official mission by making Song Suqing the head envoy of an unofficial mission to China ahead of schedule. From Sakai, Song Suqing's ship sailed south around the ≈åuchi controlled waters and reached Ningbo in 1509, two years ahead of the legitimate ≈åuchi mission led by Ry≈çan Keigo. As the Hosokawa mission made its way to the capital Beijing, Song Suqing's uncle Zhu Cheng recognized him but did not dare make himself known. Instead, he followed the mission to Suzhou, where he boarded Song Suqing's ship and reunited with his nephew. At this point it became known to the Ming officials that the Japanese head envoy was in fact a Chinese deserter, now liable for the death penalty since the maritime prohibition laws at the time banned Chinese people from going overseas under pain of death. Song Suqing bribed the powerful eunuch Liu Jin with a thousand ounces of gold in Beijing and he was exonerated: the official mitigating reasons being his position as the head envoy of a foreign country, and that he had confessed to his crimes. Song Suqing's mission did not have the proper memorial to the throne like an official mission, and consisted of only one ship out of the allotted 3, so the Chinese Ministry of Rites only rewarded the mission only one-third of the usual silver. Despite this, Song Suqing personally received favour from the Zhengde Emperor, and he was granted a robe with the flying-fish pattern (È£õÈ≠öÊúç)‚Äîa robe indicating high rank‚Äîa practice unprecedented for foreign envoys. When the official ≈åuchi mission led by Ry≈çan Keigo finally arrived in October 1511, the Chinese considered Song Suqing's 1509 mission to have fulfilled Japan's quota of tributary missions for the decade. Even if Ry≈çan Keigo's mission was considered to be part of the same mission as Song Suqing's, Ry≈çan Keigo brought three ships which exceeded the allotted three since Song Suqing had already brought one in 1509. Thus the official ≈åuchi mission was not as successful as the Hosokawa mission led by Song Suqing, and a dissatisfied Ry≈çan Keigo threatened a revival of Japanese piracy if the Chinese did not make concessions on trade. However, Ry≈çan Keigo managed to bring back the official tallies of the Zhengde emperor to the ≈åuchi, with which the ≈åuchi could prove the legitimacy of their future missions. Downfall: the 1523 mission Encouraged by the success of the 1509 mission, the Hosokawa sent Song Suqing on another mission to Ming China in 1523, with the monk Rank≈ç Zuisa (È∏ûÂ≤°Á´Ø‰Ωê) as the head envoy. This time, however, they arrived in Ningbo a few days after the ≈åuchi delegation, who also carried the most up-to-date Zhengde tallies. Song Suqing and Rank≈ç Zuisa only had the outdated tallies of the Hongzhi Emperor, but they managed to get preferable treatment after Song Suqing bribed the head eunuch of the Office of Shipping Trade (Â∏ÇËà∂Âè∏), Lai En (Ë≥¥ÊÅ©). The Hosokawa ship was allowed to unload first, and Rank≈ç Zuisa was given the seat of honour at a welcoming banquet. Enraged, the ≈åuchi delegation led by Kend≈ç S≈çsetsu (Ë¨ôÈÅìÂÆóË®≠) went up in arms. They killed Rank≈ç Zuisa, burned the Hosokawa ship, and chased Song Suqing to the walls of Shaoxing. Failing to find Song Suqing there, the ≈åuchi band burned and plundered their way back to Ningbo, kidnapped a Chinese official, and made off to sea on commandeered ships. Song Suqing was arrested by Chinese officials for his part in the disturbance. (Both his patrons of 1509 mission, Liu Jin and the Zhengde Emperor, were dead by this time.) Song Suqing claimed that the ≈åuchi had stolen their tallies, leaving them no choice but to use the outdated tallies. The Ministry of Rites deemed Song Suqing's words untrustworthy, but recommended that since Song Suqing had been pardoned by the previous emperor, he should be allowed to return to Japan and have the sh≈çgun sort out the matter of tallies. The recommendation was tentatively approved by the Jiajing Emperor, but members of the Censorate objected, saying Song Suqing's crimes were too grave to be pardoned. An investigation was hence opened by the Censorate, and in 1525 a verdict was reached: Song Suqing was sentenced to death along with two ≈åuchi envoys that the Chinese managed to catch, but they all languished and died in prison in Hangzhou by spring of that year. The sh≈çgun, not knowing the fate of Song Suqing, repeatedly made requests that he be returned to Japan, continuing as late as 1540. Cultural legacy Song Suqing's story, or at least his name, left its mark in Japanese literature and theatre. The Japanese Confucian writer Tsuga Teish≈ç (ÈÉΩË≥ÄÂ∫≠Èêò; 1718-1794) wrote a fictionalized account of Song Suqing's life in his Shigeshige ya wa (ÁπÅÈáéË©±), putting emphasis on the tragedy befalling the man stuck between two worlds. In the story, Song Suqing has to abandon his wife and children to go to Japan, and although he gains fame and fortune in Japan, he finds his children living in extreme poverty in China. Finally, he is executed by the Ming dynasty for the crimes of his Japanese associates. In the kabuki play Sanmon Gosan no Kiri, Song Suqing's name is invoked by the character of S≈ç Sokei (ÂÆãËòáÂçø; a homonym of Song Suqing in Japanese). The kabuki version of S≈ç Sokei is ordered by the emperor of China to take over Japan, but is killed by Mashiba Hisayoshi (ÁúüÊü¥‰πÖÂêâ; kabuki alias for Toyotomi Hideyoshi). His orphaned son, the notorious outlaw Ishikawa Goemon, vows to avenge him.

However, the national Labour Party learned that he had signed an ILP document, pledging to vote against Labour Party policy in certain matters. After lengthy deliberation, it refused to approve his candidacy, making Irwin the first independent ILP candidate in many years. He took 33.3% of the vote and a distant second place, which both parties considered a disappointing result. Irwin's candidacy marked a new stage in the split of the ILP from the Labour Party, which was finalised in 1932.

He identified the first clear candidate for a black hole, Cygnus X-1, with his colleague Louise Webster. He studied Mathematics and Physics at the universities of Oxford and Rochester. In 1962, he took an eight-week summer residential course supporting researchers at the Royal Greenwich Observatory in Herstmonceux and at the end was offered a post by the Astronomer Royal, Richard Woolley. He left to study a PhD at Rochester and returned to the RGO in 1970 as a research fellow. During his three-year contract there, he wondered what he could contribute to find out about the provenance of powerful cosmic x-ray sources that had recently been detected, particularly Cygnus X-1. After he had made unsuccessful searches for light variations and unusual spectra among the hundreds of stars within the area of positional uncertainty of the X-ray source, a radio star was found that was coincident with a star HDE226868. He decided, with Louise Webster, to investigate whether the star was a binary star, possibly with one of the pair being the X-ray source as well as a radio source, but not being visible. They measured the Doppler shift to find that HDE226868 was a binary star with an orbit of 5.6 days orbiting an invisible partner, presumably the source of the X-rays, and which they calculated to be certainly more than 2.5 and probably more than six solar masses. Such a star cannot be a white dwarf or neutron star and they assumed this body to be a black hole. With the Australian Louise Webster, he submitted a paper with \\"modest\\" language to Nature, only mentioning the term ‚Äúblack hole‚Äù in the final sentence. Woolley was quite conservative in his views on astronomy, regarding black holes as \\"fanciful\\" (also famously dismissing worthwhile space exploration as \\"utter bilge\\"). Astronomer Charles Thomas Bolton then published a paper with a similar conclusion and more astronomers followed suit. The discovery helped Murdin to secure his future employment. He and Webster were amongst the first staff astronomers at the Anglo-Australian Telescope and he continued in his vein of discovery using similar techniques. He returned to the Royal Greenwich Observatory and worked on developing the UK-Netherlands observatory at La Palma, which became the Isaac Newton Group of Telescopes. He was its first head of operations until 1987. He was the director of the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh from 1991‚Äì93. Then he joined the Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council, planning and developing the UK's space research policy. He was President of the European Astronomical Society and Treasurer of the Royal Astronomical Society (to which he'd first been elected as a Junior Member at the age of 17 in 1959, moving to Fellow in April 1963), during which time membership increased, its public outreach programme was established and its journal became the most prominent worldwide. He presided over or chaired various committees of the International Astronomical Union (IAU). He has authored and edited academic and popular books on astronomy and has written for many journals and newspapers, and well as having appeared regularly on television and radio programmes.

Summary A Dutch entrepreneur, Mark Hendricks, hires the crew of the Crimean salvage ship Besso to steal a load of uranium from a black market dealer. They accomplish this by detonating a charge underwater ahead of the target ship, releasing a cloud of poison gas that suffocates the crew of the ship carrying the uranium. He aims to try and sell it to the Iranians in return for 12 missiles, which he will give to the Ukrainian government to use to fight the Russians. He hates the Russians because his wife was killed when the Russians shot down a commercial airliner in the skies of Ukraine. Dirk Pitt responds to a mayday call from the ship. When he arrives, the ship is blown up by the thugs. With the help of Europol agent Ana, the uranium is recovered safely. Hendricks then hires the crew of the Besso to set off 20 tons of explosives in waters near the Russian naval base in Sevastopol. They hijack the NUMA ship Macedonia to make the attempt look like it had been attempted by the Americans, so as to start a war between the two powers. The attempt fails when Dirk Pitt stops the ship. Next, the crew of the Besso finds an old Russian bomber wreck in the Black Sea, a Tupolev Tu-4 carrying an intact RDS-5 atomic bomb. In the meantime, Dirk and his friend Giordino find the wreck of the Ottoman frigate Fethiye with the preserved body of an airman snagged on the wreck by his parachute. They find evidence that the bomber's payload has recently been removed. This, along with a raid on the Besso's base that finds a cargo door matching the downed bomber, puts them on the trail of Hendricks' plot. Hendricks once again hires the crew of the Besso after upgrading the bomb, this time instructing them to launch an attack on America, making it look like the Russians had done it, to start a war between Russia and America. Dirk and Giordino find the barge carrying the bomb in Chesapeake Bay; they realize that Hendricks wants to sink the bomb in the bay and then detonate it, releasing a cloud of poison gas over Baltimore. Their helicopter is shot down, but they are rescued by the USS Constellation, a preserved Civil War era sloop-of-war. The volunteers on the ship use shells from the display cases on the ship to fire on the barge with a 20-pounder Parrott rifle on the stern rail at point-blank range. The Constellation is almost destroyed by multiple grenades fired from an RPG. Pitt and Giordino board the barge with swords and defeat the surviving terrorists. After his attack fails, Hendricks tries one last ploy to harm Russia. Hendricks made his fortune by creating military drones. During a demonstration for the Russian President, he fires a missile at the President, pretending that it is part of the demonstration. His last words before he and the president are blown to pieces are ‚ÄúMr. President, I am about to kill you in the same manner you killed my family in the skies over Ukraine.‚Äù References to real history and current science in the book The USS Constellation (1854) is a real ship-of-line that served in the American Civil War. It was the last sail-only warship built for the United States Navy and is preserved on Chesapeake Bay. The Tupolev Tu-4 was a real aircraft, and the RDS-5 atomic bomb did exist. The Ottoman frigate Fethiye may have existed, and there was a large ship-of-line called the Fethiye built in 1827. A mention of the General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper military drone is made by Hendricks when he is demonstrating a drone to a Russian general. The drone that Hendriks is marketing, the Peregrine, has various technologies such as a hydrogen fuel cell, solar panels, and radar-absorbent material that exist today, although they have never been used in a drone.

It was carried out in two stages, between September and November 1944, by units of the Wehrmacht and Allgemeine SS. The operations aim was to counter the Allied Operation Loyton, to disrupt the local French resistance, the Maquis, to destroy local villages in order to prevent them serving as shelter for Allied forces in the upcoming winter and to deport all men of fighting age in the area to Germany as forced labour. The operation led to the destruction of 7,500 buildings, the execution of 39 captured SAS soldiers as part of Hitler's Commando Order, saw almost 1,500 French civilians killed in the fighting or executed and close to 14,000 French civilians deported to concentration camps or as forced labour. Of the almost 3,800 civilians deported to concentration camps, two thirds died there. After the war, a number of German Wehrmacht and SS officials were tried and convicted for their involvement. The operation shares its name with another German offensive in eastern France during World War I which was also titled Waldfest. Etymology Waldfest is a compound word, made up of the German words Wald (forest) and Fest (fest, feast). Background Western Front in 1944 Following the successful Allied Invasion of Normandy on 6 June 1944 and before the Liberation of Paris on 26 August, German forces in the Vosges mountains were ordered to establish a defensive position west of the ridge line of the mountains, titled the Schutzwall West (Protective Wall West). Up to 30,000 Hitler Youth members from Germany were brought in to help with the construction of the fortified line. Planned as a massive fortification stretching from southern Belgium to the Swiss border, in practice little of it was completed because of a lack of resources, but also because of harassment of the work groups by the Maquis. The German plan was to destroy all villages in front of this protective wall to eliminate any shelter for Allied forces in the upcoming winter. The local population was to be evacuated and the male population aged between 15 and 60 was to be deported to Germany as forced labour. This policy of scorched earth had previously been predominately applied in eastern Europe but not on the Western front. An order from Wilhelm Keitel, Chief of the German Armed Forces High Command, from 8 July 1944 stated that all able-bodied civilians that were in any way involved or suspected to be involved with local resistance were to be taken to transit camps and deported to Germany as forced labour. A subsequent order by Hermann Balck, commander of the Army Group G, from 2 November 1944 stated that all German forces in the Vosges mountains were to withdraw to the pre-determined defensive line. The area west of it was to be destroyed and any assets like livestock and food evacuated. The local population was to be either deported, as ordered by Keitel, or concentrated in one part of the village. These parts were to be selected so that they could be taken under artillery fire while the remaining parts of villages were to be destroyed. All bridges were to be rendered unusable, and enemy forces should not be able to find any habitable building during the cold winter season. The region east of the ridge line of the Vosges mountains had become part of Germany after 1940, as it had been from 1870 to 1918, and was, at the time, predominantly German-speaking. Virtually no active resistance existed in the eastern part while, in the western part, it greatly increased in mid-1944. Operation Waldfest Organisation Operation Waldfest was carried out in two parts, Waldfest 1 and Waldfest 2. The importance of Waldfest can be seen in the fact that Heinrich Himmler himself took part in a conference at G√©rardmer on 6 September 1944 to ensure that the German border in the west was defended at all costs. Wehrmacht responsibility for Waldfest lay with the Generals Erich von Kirchbach and Hermann Balck. For the Gestapo and SS, Carl Oberg, SS and police leader for France (originally based at Nancy but relocated to Fraize in mid- September), Friedrich Stuhr, SS and police leader in Alsace, and Erich Isselhorst, Commander of the Sicherheitspolizei in Baden and Alsace. The main base for the operation was Schirmeck, location of the ', and commanded by Karl Buck. Schirmeck was a subcamp of the Natzweiler-Struthof concentration camp. The German Wehrmacht and SS units were supported by French collaborators and French militia. Execution Waldfest 1 began in September 1944, under the command of Isselhorst and his deputy, Wilhelm Schneider, and was organised from Strassburg, after the Wehrmacht had been unable to defeat the local resistance movement. Isselhorst's efforts were successful and the SAS agents in the region, part of Operation Loyton, were either captured or killed. The first stage of the operation lasted from 1 to 30 September 1944. The operation was carried out by small Einsatzkommandos, varying in strength from 30 to 100 men, which were supported by Wehrmacht Jagdkommandos (Hunting commandos) under Generalmajor Franz Vaterrodt, based in Strasbourg. Waldfest 2, the second stage of the operation, lasted from 1 October to November 1944. It targeted the local resistance, the Groupe Mobile d'Alsace‚Äì GMA, but also the civilian population and towns and villages. The Vall√©e du , which had already been targeted in the first phase on 24 September, when 424 civilians were deported to concentration camps, of which 362 were killed, was hit a second time on 5 and 6 October. This time, 392 young men were arrested and deported, of which 246 perished. A third attack, the most violent, on the valley took place on 8 November. This time, almost 8,000 civilians were deported as forced labour, also some could be freed on the way by the approaching French Army. The events in the Vall√©e du Rabodeau led Charles de Gaulle to name it \\"The Valley of Tears\\" after liberation. Operation Waldfest came to a definite hold when the region was liberated by the 100th US Infantry Division in late November 1944, as part of VI Corps and Operation Dogface. Outcome Murder of captured SAS soldiers Isselhorst ordered the execution of the captured British SAS members, as well as a number of French civilians, three French priests and four US airmen. The prisoners were taken over the Rhine river on trucks to Gaggenau on 21 November 1944. The leader of the execution commando, Karl Beck, thought it unwise to leave mass graves of shot allied soldiers in an area so close to the front line. The prisoners were initially kept in a local jail, but then on or shortly after 25 November, taken to a local forest and shot in the head in a bomb crater. One prisoner attempted to escape, but was also killed. French civilian population Operation Waldfest saw 376 civilians executed and 110 Maquis fighters killed in action. A further 1,000 civilians died in bombardments. It saw 3,762 civilians deported to concentration camps, of which two thirds were killed. Over 11,000 civilians from the Vosges mountains were deported to Germany as forced labour, either directly or as part of the Service du travail obligatoire. In post-war France they were not awarded the status as deported as they did not meet the criteria of having been held in prisons or concentration camps. Only in the 1970s were the deported awarded the title of \\"Patriot deported to Germany\\" (). Germany only started compensating these victims from April 2000 onward, by which time few were still alive, and then only under very strict criteria. Waldfest also saw the destruction of over 7,500 buildings in the region. Saint-Di√©-des-Vosges, were 2,000 houses were destroyed, burned for five days after having been set alight on 14 November and was liberated by the US Army on 23 November. It was the most-destroyed city of eastern France during the war. Post-war After the end of the war, Major Eric Barkworth of the 2nd Special Air Service Regiment was tasked with establishing what had happened to the missing captured SAS members. His efforts resulted in the prosecution and conviction of some of the culprits. For the murder of the SAS parachutists, Erich Isselhorst, Karl Oberg and Wilhelm Schneider were sentenced to death by a British military tribunal in Wuppertal in June 1946, with Isselhorst handed over to the French. General Willy Seeger, in charge of an involved reserve Wehrmacht division in Alsace at the time, was sentenced to three years in jail and Helmut Schlierbach to ten years for their role while a sixth accused, Julius Gehrum, was found not guilty of the charge and released. though he was later sentenced to death by the French in May 1947 (p 379 - \\"The Nazi Hunters\\" - Damien Lewis - 2015). Isselhorst was once more sentenced to death in May 1947, now by a French military tribunal, and executed in Strasbourg on 23 February 1948. Schneider was executed by the British at Hameln on 23 January 1947 while Oberg was pardoned. Karl Buck, commander of the Schirmeck camp, was sentenced to death by both a British and a French military court, had his sentenced commuted to life and was released in 1955. He was charged on seven more occasions in West Germany but never convicted and died a free man in 1977. Hermann Balck was sentenced by a French military court in Colmar to 20 years of hard labour for his role in the scorched earth operations but never extradited. Hans-Dietrich Ernst, involved in the deportation of the Jews of Angers, was also part of Waldfest and sentenced to death in absentia on three occasions by France, but never extradited.

He discovered the nonlinear optical crystals BBO, LBO and KBBF, which have important uses in areas including superconductor research, semiconductor photolithography, and the medical industry. He was an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and a fellow of The World Academy of Sciences. He was awarded the TWAS Prize in Chemistry, the State Technological Invention Award (First Class), and the Laudise Prize.  Biography  Chen was born on 18 February 1937 in Fenghua, Zhejiang, China. He studied at Shenyang No. 2 High School, and was accepted by the Department of Physics of Peking University in August 1956. After graduating in 1962, he entered the Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter in Fuzhou on the recommendation of Hu Ning, and studied under physical chemist Lu Jiaxi for three years. In 1965, Chen chose nonlinear optical materials as his research direction and spent the next two years calculating the nonlinear optical coefficients of many crystals. In the late 1970s and the 1980s, Chen and his team discovered the new nonlinear optical crystals BaB2O4 (BBO) and LiB3O5 (LBO). In 1988, Chen and his team began searching for optical compounds that could produce shorter ultraviolet wavelengths. After researching hundreds of compounds, they discovered potassium beryllium fluoroborate (KBBF), a nonlinear optical crystal which is capable of generating light within a very narrow bandwidth, with wavelengths of less than 200 nanometers. The crystal is important in superconductor research and can allow the replacement of excimer laser with solid-state ones in photolithography used in the semiconductor and the medical industries. Until at least 2009, Chen's laboratory at the Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter was the only place in the world that could produce KBBF. In 2013, Chen and his colleague invented the DUV-DPL device (deep ultraviolet diode-pumped solid-state laser), with a wavelength of only 177.3 nm. Chen died on 31 October 2018 in Beijing, at the age of 81. Honors and recognition Chen was elected a fellow of The World Academy of Sciences in 1990 and an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2003. Chen was awarded the 1987 TWAS Prize in Chemistry, \\"for his outstanding contribution to the development of new nonlinear optical materials, the formulation of a quantum chemical theory that guides the search for such materials and the discovery of beta barium borate and lithium triborate\\". He won a Special Prize of the Science and Technology Progress Award of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1986 for his discovery of BBO and the State Technological Invention Award (First Class) in 1991 for LBO. In 2013, he was awarded the Laudise Prize by the International Organization for Crystal Growth.

Currently, in the Roviana Lagoon, the larger tribal polities are the chief districts of Saikile and Kalikoqu. The Kalikoqu originally lived in the eastern side of Nusa Roviana in the western Roviana Lagoon. The Kalikoqu had their own property rights of land and sea by intermarrying each other to share kinship relationships. However, the British colonized there in the late 19th century, and British military destroyed their traditional societies. All the tribes moved to the inner lagoon and became fused as a new enclave called Kalikoqu (P. 8).  History  There were distinct tribes Taghosaghe, Lio Zuzuloqo, Vuragare, and Koloi people who inhabited the Roviana Lagoon and the coast of the New Georgia mainland in the nineteenth century. In September 1891 the British naval warship HMS Royalist punished villages following a murder of a Uki Island trader Fred Howard; the sailors shot some of the men who were believed to be the leaders, set fire to the villages and destroyed canoes. The tribal groups moved east, toward the Roviana Lagoon. Afterwards, British administrators, missionaries, and traders have exchanged European objects, such as food, weapons, and ornaments with islanders to promote political powers and networks of both the British and Roviana chiefs. Also, islanders have exchanged shell valuables, such as rings, called poata with the European. Additionally, another newly emerged Saikile tribe was comprised by Nusa Roviana settlers, Roviana-Kazukuru, Kalena Bay, Hoava, Hoeze, Taghosaghe, and Marovo people that inhabited the eastern side of the Roviana Lagoon until the late nineteenth century. Church missions are another important factors altering the traditional beliefs and the tenure pragmatics of Saikile and Kalikoqu people in Roviana. Roviana inhabitants mostly believe in the Christian Fellowship Church (CFC) that was established in 1961 as the first independent church of the Solomon Islands. This plays a role in an indigenous religious secessionist movement and became mixed with traditional beliefs. The church runs its own schools and works on projects to exploit logging and cocoa plantations.  Society  For a long time, these groups shared kinship and established the rules of each chief through tribal intermarriage between the inland groups of Kazukuru, Taghosaghe, Lio Zuzuloqo and Hoava with the coastal groups of Vuragare and Koloi. In pre-colonial time, tribal movements of the Roviana polity empowered chiefs called bangara and gave them great authority over land and sea territories. The chief could have direct ‚Äúownership‚Äù of these territories by means of entitlements for resource. To avoid future conflicts, the chief made a responsible for shared land and sea with trusteeship called kinopu. Each of his three grandchildren was apportioned an entitlement domain in order to exploit forested land, the reefs, and islands. Today, in spite of the loss of the intermarriage to exchange lineages for identifying each tribe, the Kalikoque and Saikle polities still have socio-political dominance over land and sea in New Georgia Island and the lagoon barrier islands. These two systems historically remain the centralization of chiefly power and the composition of the Roviana kinship system. The Roviana kinship system still connects individuals to multiple kin groups in order to allow the advantages of land and sea entitlements. The significant portions of people between land and sea territories entrusts chiefs with trusteeship or kinopu. This enables fishers to have chiefly access to different sea territories and join with competing groups to utilize their tenure rights for territorial extension. Moreover, the CFC church also can persuade chiefs to barter with the church for valuable objects, such as shell rings, by controlling its members in terms of resource management (1999, p. 437). This prevailing exchange system causes chiefs to monopolize economic and political power.

Clara Holmes Hapgood Nash (January 15, 1839 ‚Äì March 18, 1921) was an American lawyer who was the first woman admitted to the bar in New England (Maine). Family and education Born Clara Holmes Hapgood in Fitchburg, Massachusetts, she was the fifth of eight children of John and Mary Ann Hosmer Hapgood. On her mother's side she was related to the sculptor Harriet Hosmer, while on her father's side she was related to Henry Durant, the founding president of the University of California. In 1846 the family moved to Acton, the hometown of both of Clara's parents. Due to ill health, her early schooling was frequently interrupted, but she eventually graduated from the State Normal School in Framingham, after which she became a teacher in the towns of Acton, Marlborough, and Danvers. She also edited a pro- temperance publication, The Crystal Font. In 1869, she married Frederick Cushing Nash, a Maine lawyer who taught for a time in the nearby South Acton school district. They had a son, Frederick Hapgood Nash. Career Not long after her marriage, Nash began to study the law in her husband's office (a normal form of legal apprenticeship at the time). In 1871, she became a justice of the peace, and in October 1872, she was admitted to the bar of the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine, thereby becoming the first woman admitted to the bar in New England as well as one of the earliest women lawyers anywhere in the United States. Her achievement was widely reported in newspapers throughout the country. Nash formed a partnership with her husband, and they practiced together in Maine. In 1873, she appeared in court for the first time and made the opening remarks in a jury trial. That same year, she led a petition drive in favor of women's suffrage. Nash and her husband later moved back to Massachusetts, where Nash could no longer practice law because Massachusetts did not yet admit women to the bar. Instead, she served as the first librarian of the Citizens‚Äô Library in West Acton and continued to be very active in the temperance movement. She served as president of the local affiliate of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union for over two decades. Nash also wrote poetry, especially poems about family and occasional verse for birthdays and anniversaries. In 1909, she published a volume of poetry with Cambridge University Press entitled Verses. One of her poems, \\"Mother\\", was set to the music of Elmer Samuel Hosmer. Around 1915, Nash and her husband moved from Acton to Newton. Frederick died in February 1921 and Clara followed him in March. They are buried together in Mount Hope Cemetery.

All efforts to lighten her and get her off failed and as the water receded she was revealed to be lying on the Waldram Flats. A party of French soldiers approached and opened fire with small arms, wounding a seaman on Decoy. Decoy returned fire with her guns and with small arms and drove them off. Efforts to prop her up to await the next tide failed and she fell on her side. A larger party of soldiers arrived under a flag of truce and offered good terms of surrender so Pearce struck.

The battle was fought during a succession crisis following the death of Jai Singh II, which left Jaipur without effective leadership.  History   Background  Jai Singh II, Maharajah of Jaipur and head of the powerful Kachawa caste, was a major geopolitical force in his lifetime.Sir Jadunath Sarkar (1994). A History of Jaipur 1503‚Äì1938. Orient Longman. . As a prominent figure within the Mughal Empire, Jai allied himself with several other powerful rajas; he was particularly close to Suraj Mal, Maharajah of Bharatpur, who considered Jai to be like a father. When Jai died on 21 September 1743, his 25-year-old son Ishwari Singh replaced him as Maharajah. However, Madho Singh, another of Jai's sons from a different marriage, disagreed with his brother's accession to the throne and subsequent ruling of Jaipur; in 1747, he rose in revolt against his brother. Madho's revolt was defeated at the Battle of Rajamahal, but the claimant escaped and began to gather forces to assist him in ousting his brother. Just over a year after his first invasion had failed, Madho Singh again invaded Jaipur. Unlike his previous invasion, Malhar Rao personally led the complete might of his army during his second invasion. He also built up a strong alliance of powers who opposed his brother; Malhar Rao, a rival to the late Jai Singh, joined Madho Singh's efforts to overthrow his brother, feeling he could benefit from Jaipur's weakness. Ummed Singh, the vanquished Raja of Bundi also joined, as he was eager to win back his kingdom. Madho's army also contained a large host of Maratha, Afghan and tribal mercenaries, soldiers from the Maratha Holkar clan, Hada Rajputs from Bundi and several Kachawa nobles who defected. This alliance marched against Jaipur in August 1748. Malhar Rao took the lead and captured several strategic Forts and towns of the Jaipur Kingdom. In Jaipur city, Ishwari amassed his forces for battle; Ishwari Singh, unlike his father and brother, initially had no allies. He made an attempt in desperation to ask SuraJ Mal - a longtime ally of his late father - for aid, and Surajmal readily accepted, personally led his army of 10,000 men to Jaipur city. Though heavily outnumbered, the two defenders hoped to attack Madho's army before all of his forces had consolidated.  Battle  The two armies engaged each-other around the town of Bagru on 20 August 1748. The fighting lasted for 6 days; for much of the battle, a rainstorm blanketed the area. The first day resulted in heavy losses for both armies before the rain halted the fighting. On the second day, Suraj personally led his forces in a fierce counterattack that routed the Maratha contingent of Modho's army; however, the Marathas were able to spike many Jaipur cannons before they were forced back. While the two armies fought at Bagru, 5000 men from Madho's army captured a Jaipur supply convoy and blocked the road between Bagru and Jaipur city. With their supplies and line of retreat cut off, Ishwari and Suraj retreated into Bagru's fort, ending the battle. Having lost the battle, Ishwari chose to sue for peace. Rather than negotiate with the enemy army as a whole, he offered terms to each individual commander. He bribed an ally of the Holkars to arrange for the Holkar forces to withdraw, and agreed to give his brother control over five parganas. He bribed the Maratha soldiers (and allowed them to keep the wealth they had looted), and agreed to surrender the town of Bundi to Ummed Singh. In return for his concessions, Ishwari was allowed to return to Jaipur city and continue his rule.  Aftermath  While Suraj Mal's actions during the battle at Bagru won him praise for his martial skill, the defeat humiliated Ishwari. The Jaipur raj descended into a state of paranoia, resulting in him arresting and executing a number of his officials. He attempted to regain his lost prestige by helping the nearby Kingdom of Marwar against the invading Mughal army, he won a minor victory at the Battle of Raona against the Mughal general Salabat Khan, but was soon bogged down in a stalemate and forced to withdraw. He also accrued a large debt with the Marathas, who's soldiers he employed as mercenaries. When he failed to repay these debts, the Marathas invaded Jaipur. Ishwari Singh locked himself in his room for many days and refused to come out. The ministers of Jaipur urged Ishwari Singh to give them orders, but faced with his enemies approaching his capital, Ishwari committed suicide on 12 December 1750, resulting in Madho Singh becoming the Maharajah of Jaipur.

New Mexico and Colorado, 141-orig, ___ U.S. ___ (2018), was a Supreme Court case argued and decided during the 2017 term of the Supreme Court of the United States. The case involved an interstate dispute regarding New Mexico's compliance with the Rio Grande Compact of 1938, an agreement which established a plan for equitable apportionment of the water in the Rio Grande Basin among the states of Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas. The Court considered the question of whether the US federal government had a legal right to join litigation against New Mexico; the Court ruled that the federal government was within its rights when it did so.  Background   The Rio Grande Compact  The interstate agreement that the case centered around, the Rio Grande Compact, arose from multiple concerns regarding apportionment of water during the early 20th century. According to the terms of the Convention Between the United States and Mexico for the Equitable Distribution of the Waters of the Rio Grande for Irrigation Purposes, a treaty that the United States signed with Mexico in 1906, the U.S. must supply Mexico with at least 60,000 acre- feet of water from the Rio Grande each year. As part of its efforts to develop the arid American West through the Newlands Reclamation Act and the Rio Grande Project, the federal government began construction of the Elephant Butte Reservoir in New Mexico to reserve a large amount of water for transference to Mexican officials; the reservoir was completed in 1916 and soon found additional use supplying farmers in New Mexico and Texas with water for irrigation of their crops. However, a lack of regulation regarding water apportionment between the states caused tension between Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas, leading them to sign the Rio Grande Compact in March 1938, which committed all three states to equal division of the Rio Grande's water supplies above a point in Fort Quitman, Texas.  Interstate Conflict  In early 2014, the state of Texas sued New Mexico, formally accusing it of allowing the water reserves of the Rio Grande to be discreetly channeled away for use within New Mexico and of depriving Texas of its equal share in the river's resources. Asserting that the violation was an injury to the general interests of the United States, the federal government followed suit and filed a complaint against New Mexico the same year, which raised the question of whether the federal government had the legal right to intervene in matters regarding the relevant type of interstate compact. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case on October 10, 2017, despite a Special Master's recommendation that the Court reject a hearing of the federal government's complaints on the grounds that the Rio Grande Compact and subsequent federal legislation did not grant the federal government enforcement powers related to the Compact.  Question presented  The key question of the case was \\"May the United States properly intervene in an action involving a dispute over a compact between states?\\"  Ruling  The case was argued before the Supreme Court on January 8, 2018, and decided on March 5 of the same year. Justice Neil Gorsuch delivered the Court's unanimous opinion, holding that the federal government has the right to join suits in matters related to interstate compacts provided that the compacts at hand are directly related to the operations and obligations of the federal government. The opinion cites the precedent set in Maryland v. Louisiana (1981) that the United States sometimes has the right to intervene in interstate compacts and clarifies this right by adding that, for intervention to be allowed, the dispute must be clearly related to \\"distinctively federal interests\\".  Rationale  The Court ruled that adherence to the Rio Grande Compact is of direct relevance to the interests of the federal government for three distinct reasons: # The terms of the Rio Grande Compact are fundamentally linked to the operations of the Rio Grande Project, a federal program. # The federal government is significantly involved in the functions of the Compact and the coordination of its details. # The federal government relies upon the proper operation of the Compact in order to fulfill its treaty commitments to the government of Mexico. The Court also noted that it had been assisted toward its decision by a fourth consideration: the fact that the federal government joined an existing complaint filed by the State of Texas, one of the parties to the Rio Grande Compact, and that Texas had not objected to the federal government's intervention. Since these first three factors demonstrate the Rio Grande Compact's relation to \\"distinctively federal interests\\" and since the fourth demonstrates that federal intervention occurred with the tacit consent of Texas, the case's original petitioner, the Court ruled that the federal government did have the right to intervene and join Texas as a plaintiff against New Mexico.  Legacy  Notably, the justices chose not to rule on the issue of whether the federal government has the right to initiate a unique suit regarding proper adherence to interstate compact law. Because of this, the question of whether the federal government can legally intervene in interstate compact law by initiating its own suit (without any existing suits filed by states and/or without the consent of the states involved in the relevant compact) remains unanswered. Moreover, the Court chose not to rule on New Mexico's compliance with the Rio Grande Compact during this case, so the issue of water apportionment in the Elephant Butte Reservoir will remain unresolved until such time that the Court chooses to address the question in a future case. However, the Court's subsequent ruling in Florida v. Georgia (2018), a case involving water distribution between the states of Georgia and Florida, established a lower standard of proof in which Florida must only prove \\"harm\\" from unequal apportionment for its case to be considered. If the Court continues to apply it for apportionment cases in the future, which is likely according to the assessment of Todd Votteler, the head of Collaborative Water Resolution LLC, this new standard will almost certainly prove advantageous to Texas in its ongoing case against New Mexico.

In 1871, Winsey graduated from Harvard Medical School, where he was taught by Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.; he would return to East Baltimore and establish his medical practice in his home. On November 2, 1872, Winsey married Anastasia Jakes. They had two children - Herbert, born in 1875, and Bertha, born in 1878. On April 2, 1882, Winsey was admitted to the Medical and Chirurgical Faculty of Maryland, becoming the first African American to do so. Four doctors resigned from the faculty in protest. Earlier in the year, he was denied admittance to the Baltimore Medical and Surgical Society, as some members objected to Winsey's admittance, one in particular stating that \\"his Southern birth prevented him from recognizing a negro practitioner.\\" In addition to private practice, Winsey was an instructor at Provident Hospital and a physician at the Industrial Home for Colored Girls at Melvale in Baltimore. Winsey died on July 6, 1919 at the age of 71.

The holotype specimen was discovered in the Jiufotang Formation near Lingyuan, western Liaoning province, and was catalogued as IVPP V18687. The nearly complete, articulated specimen is preserved on a slab and has impressions of pennaceous feathers. Only parts of the sternum, the left hand, and right foot are missing. In 2015, it became the basis of the new genus and species Parapengornis eurycaudatus, named by the Chinese palaeontologists Han Hu, Jingmai K. O‚ÄôConnor, and Zhonghe Zhou. The generic name consists of the Latin word para and the name of the related genus Pengornis, indicating their close relationship. The name Pengornis is itself derived from \\"Peng\\", a mythological bird from Chinese folklore, and ornis, which means bird in Greek. The specific name is derived from the Latin words eury, meaning broad, and caudatus, meaning tail, in reference to the broad and expanded pygostyle (the last fused vertebrae of a bird's tail). A nearly complete specimen formerly assigned to Pengornis was also reassigned to Parapengornis by these authors. Skull and teeth compared to those of other pengornithids Parapengornis was a large pengornithid, distinguished from its relatives by a combination of features such as the many slender, constricted teeth with pointed and recurved apices, with short cervical (neck) vetrebrae at the front, but those further back elongated, a broad pygostyle, and a Y-shaped furcula (wishbone). Hu and colleagues found physical similarities between Parapengornis and scansorial (tree-dwelling) birds such as woodpeckers, and suggested it could have been specialised for climbing vertically and clinging (which had not been previously suggested for early birds, and would add to the diversity of ecological niches occupied by enantiornithines). They also suggested that the pennaceous feathers dominated by rhacis and the shape of the pygostyle may have had a significance for their function. In 2017, Wang Wei and O‚ÄôConnor argued against the earlier hypothesis that Parapengornis was woodpecker-like, and found the pygostyle similar to those of other pengornithids, and that the tail feathers could not have worked as a prop. They instead found the tail feathers similar to those of arboreal birds such as the paradise-flycatchers. In 2017, Nikita V. Zelenkov criticised the idea that Parapengornis was especially adapted for climbing trees.

The region has extensive oil and gas resources and was deformed during the last several million years by more distant tectonic events. Geologic history, stratigraphy and tectonics Atop the crystalline and igneous metamorphic basement rock of the Arabian Shield, Huqf Group clastics, carbonates and evaporites are the oldest sedimentary rocks in the UAE. Throughout the Paleozoic, the region experienced mainly clastic deposition. Carbonates are rare, except from the Cambrian, early-middle Devonian and early-middle Carboniferous. Jebel Dhanna in Abu Dhabi and the offshore islands of Dalma, Arzana, Zirkouh and Das have some of the oldest surface exposures: dolomite, shale and volcanic rocks brought to the surface by salt tectonics. The Hercynian orogeny affected the Middle East Craton in the Late Carboniferous, driving erosion and warping. Clastics deposited on the unconformity left by the erosion through the Permian, principally sandstone, siltstone, anhydrite and dolomite. Mesozoic (251-66 million years ago) With the formation of the supercontinent Pangea, the area became more arid in the Permian into the Triassic. Shallow water carbonates and evaporites belonging to the Khuff Formation deposited during a marine transgression, with microcrystalline dolomite, limestone and anhydrite up to thick and recording five marine regressions. With the westward uplifting of the region, it was succeeded by the Sudair Formation (dolomite, argillaceous limestone, shale and anhydrite) and the Gulailh and Jilh formations (offshore and on-shore in Abu Dhabi respectively). A full scale marine regression is recorded in the clastic lacustrine sandstones and limestones of the Minjur Formation. A very large carbonate platform took shape during a major marine transgression in the Jurassic, leaving behind the Hamlah Formation greywacke and mudstone from the early Jurassic, the middle Jurassic Araej Formation and the oolite dominated Asab Formation in the east. In the 1960s and 1970s, oil companies described the Thamama Group. The early Cretaceous is marked by the fossil-bearing Shuaiba Formation, which contains breccia and mollusk-rich limestone as well as ammonite fossils. The Middle Cretaceous Wasia Group, including the Nahr Umr, Salbikh and Mishrif formations occurs between Abu Dhabi and Qatar and deposited during a time of moderate uplift and erosion. As a result, the Nahr Umr Formation contains glauconite sands, shale, small phosphates and some limestone. However, a marine transgression took place by the time of the Mauddud Member deposition. The thick limestone sequence of the Mishrif Formation deposited in the Shilaif Basin, with a thickness of in the west offshore and in the Umm Addalkh field. The packstone, greywacke and limestone contains abundant rudist fossils. The Aruma Group marks two successive transgression-regression events in the late Cretaceous, with the Laffan Formation argillaceous limestone and the Halul Formation calcareous shale and lime-mudstone from the first event and the marl-shale-mudstone Fiqa Formation and greywacke-dolomite Simsima Formation from the second event. Cenozoic (66 million years ago-present) A disconformity appeared with a drop in sea level in the Cenozoic. In the Paleogene, the Qatar Arch was comparatively stable and Abu Dhabi was at the edge of the Rub al Khali and Pabdeh-Gurpi (centered in the North Emirates) basins. The Hasa Group includes Umm Er Radhuma, Rus and Dammam formations. The Pabdeh Formation is largely offshore and contains of shale and argillaceous limestone. The Umm Er Radhuma Formation ranges from 1150 feet in the northwest to 2300 in the east with limestone, dolomite, argillite, sabkha cycles, shale and anhydrite. Evaporite formed in the early Eocene leaving the 200 to 840 foot Rus Formation which also includes minor argillaceous limestones. A return to lower salinity and shallow marine conditions in the Middle Eocene deposited the nummulitic carbonates of the Dammam Formation, as well as dolomite and subordinate shales. Uplift and erosion affected the region into the Oligocene. The partially dolomite, and fossiliferous limestone dominated Asmari Formation emplaced in the far east, followed by the Gachsaran Formation from the early Miocene, with anhydrite and dolomite, ascending to dolomite, limestone, anhydrite, shale, marl and other carbonates. The Gachsaran depocenter was located in onshore Abu Dhabi. During the late Miocene and into the Pliocene, the Alpine Orogeny which uplifted the Alps and the Himalayas affected the region, uplifting the Omani and Zagros Mountains and driving significant erosion. Muds, sabkha deposits, windblown sand, conglomerate limestone, beach gravel and silt are all defining sediments of the past 2.5 million years of the Quaternary.

It was designed by Spain and Cosh and built 1914. It is also known as Dawnay Day House. The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  The track that would become Essex Street had been established by 1807, when it was shown on James Meehan's survey. The intersection of Essex and Gloucester Streets, just beyond what is now Accountants House, was reputedly known as Gallows Hill due to its view into Sydney's first gaol complex. It appears that there were some structures on the building's site on the corner of Harrington and Essex Streets at that time. Robert Russell's survey of Section No. 63 prepared during the 1830s shows a number of claimants for the northern end of the block between Essex Street, Gloucester Street, Church Hill (Charlotte Place, later Grosvenor Street) and Harrington Street. The claimants included Edward Hunt, Marianne Dickens (or Mary Ann Dicken), Anne Whitaker, George and Edmund Chapman and John Kingdon Cleave. Use as Hogan's stables The outlines of the buildings are shown on Russell's survey and include the building on the corner of Essex and Harrington Street later used as Hogan's stables. The 1858 Metropolitan Sewerage & Drainage Board (MWSDB) also shows Hogan's Stables. It is possible that the stables were the building shown on the 1830s survey however no buildings are shown on the 1847 plan of Cleave's grant. The 1882 rate books describe the building as being a brick stable with an iron roof. Hogan may also have lived on the premises, as later rate books note a residence, possibly a converted shed. The 1888 Metropolitan Detail series plan shows the layout of the stables and the yard, the entrance to which was from Harrington Street. Additional detail is recorded on Percy Dove's 1880s plans which indicates that the stables were a single storey building with a passageway to the rear (north) that led to Frog Hollow (just behind the site). Sheds lined the southern and the western side of the yard. Following the outbreak of bubonic plague in December 1900 an extensive \\"cleansing\\" of the perceived \\"slum\\" areas was undertaken and the entire area from Millers Point, where the outbreak occurred, as far south as Charlotte Place (Grosvenor Street) was resumed by the state, under the Public Works Act. The immediate waterfront and part of Millers Point was resumed and vested in the Sydney Harbour Trust. The remainder of the resumed lands became known as the Observatory Hill Resumed Lands. The resumption plans record that the stables on the corner of Essex Street were the property of Edmund Compton Batt, Andrew Edmund Jacques and John Mitchell Purves (1847-1915). Purves was the founder of Batt, Rodd and Purves Auctioneers and Estate Agents of 88 Pitt Street. He was Mayor of North Sydney and represented Clarence in the Legislative Assembly from 1880‚Äì1887. The irregular allotments at the intersection with Essex Street were regularised and 20 new lots created, each with a street frontage. A survey was undertaken in April 1905 and the first \\"auction sale of the Observatory Hill lands\\" occurred on 4 December 1905. Occupancy by G. E. Crane and Sons The property with stables was tenanted until the end of the decade when it was purchased by G. E. Crane and Sons. No photographic record of the demolition of the stables has been located. Documents for a warehouse building were submitted to Council and approved in July 1913. Minor modifications to the building were submitted to Council by architects Spain and Cosh later that year. The building which was erected comprises a load- bearing brick walled structure framed internally with timber posts and beams and with timber floor framing. It consisted of five floors and a flat roof. In 1934 the fabric was modified by the addition of a lift and motor house. In February 1950 the architectural firm of Crane and Scott submitted their drawings, executed for G. E. Crane and Sons Ltd, to convert the warehouse to an office building. This necessitated the construction of a new lift, fire isolated stair, lobby spaces and toilet facilities. Externally a new entry and terracotta tiling were incorporated into the Harrington Street facade. The lift installed in 1934, on the northern side of the building, appears to have been removed. Acquisition by the Australian Society of Accountants An application to install an awning over the Harrington Street entrance was made in March 1952 by the firm of A. W. Edwards. The building was purchased by the Australian Society of Accountants at about this time, and some parts of the building were subsequently tenanted, minor modifications resulted from this. Apart from modifications to internal partitions, subsequent alterations took place in 1962 when the Australian Society of Accountants installed new partitioning on several levels and installed a system of mechanical ventilation. A new entry and surround were also added, providing access from Essex Street to the first floor. Resumption by the NSW Government As a result of the establishment of the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority in January 1970, early offers were made to purchase the building, then notification of resumption was given by the Authority in November of that year. After a short period of dispute, the Australian Society of Accountants vacated the premises in October 1971. The building remained tenanted and minor repair work was carried out. New bitumen coated asbestos roofing, guttering and some downpipes were renewed in 1978. In the 1980s a proposal was put forward to demolish both 117-119 Harrington Street and 120 Gloucester St as well as Bushells Building and create a park, contingent to high rise development on adjacent sites, but this never went ahead. In December 2003 the NSW Heritage Council approved a development application for the upgrading of the building and its combination with the adjoining building at 120 Gloucester St. The proposal was prepared by the architect, John Graham & Associates. These plans were used as a basis to attract expressions of interest for the conservation and adaptive re-use of the building to be funded by the future developer/occupant of the building in return for a long lease to the building. In June 2004 title to the building was transferred from the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority to the Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority. In 2005 a revised development application was lodged by HEG Holdings Pty Ltd which was prepared by architects, Noosphere Ideas Pty Ltd. Whilst combining the buildings at 120 Gloucester and 117-119 Harrington Streets, the revised proposal deleted the already approved new top floor to 117-119 Harrington Street and substituted a two-storey, lightweight penthouse of unambiguously modern design. The 1950 lift shaft and stairs were retained in their original location within 117-119 Harrington Street. In addition the roof top laundry and chimneys were also lost along with the roof structure. The parapet along the east side of the building adjoining 117-119 Harrington Street was demolished so that the terrace area of the penthouse at 117-119 Harrington Street could be extended over part of the roof area of 120 Gloucester Street. This work was carried out in 2006. Sub-lease to Downay Day In 2005 a 99-year lease was signed with HEG Holdings Pty Ltd who developed the building project and in 2006 the lease was transferred to the current lessee, Downay Day Walden. 117-119 Harrington Street is now known as Dawnay Day House and is the Australian headquarters of the Dawnay Day group. In addition to containing the offices of Dawnay Day Walden, the combined building of 117-119 Harrington Street and 120 Gloucester Street contains the offices of various tenants which are accessed from the four entrances to the combined buildings. The four entrances are located at 117-119 Harrington Street, 7 Essex Street, 5 Essex Street and 120 Gloucester Street.  Description  The building is adjoined to the west by the Housing Board building, 120 Gloucester Street, and neighboured by the Bushells building to the immediate south. The building is a typical example of the Federation Warehouse style. Located on a street corner, the site rises from east to west. The building comprises a ground floor, four upper levels, and a flat trafficable roof. External walls are of load-bearing face brick, laid English bond, framed internally with timber posts and beams with timber floor framing. The Harrington Street facade is symmetrical and is divided into three bays. The original timber frame, double-hung windows are painted and, above the first floor, are set within the recessed wall portions of the two side bays. The window heads are arched. This detailing and window arrangement is also evident on the Essex Street elevation. The exterior of the building is in good condition and retains much of the original integrity and fabric. The interior of the building is also in good condition and retains of a significant portion of original fabric and integrity.  Modifications and dates  * 1934A lift and motor room were installed. * 1950A new lift, reinforced concrete with fire door, stair, lobby spaces and toilet facilities were constructed.

Geologic History, Stratigraphy & Tectonics Some of the oldest rocks exposed at the surface in Jordan are situated in the southern Wadi al 'Arabah and date to the Proterozoic. Precambrian basement rock intrusions in the south include aplite, diorite, gabbro and granodiorite. From east to west, the number of dikes in Precambrian rocks increases. Paleozoic (541-251 million years ago) East of the Jordan River Valley, the land surface eroded to a nearly flat peneplain and many Proterozoic sediments were eroded. Before Cambrian sediments began to accumulate quartz porphyry lavas erupted to the surface. Tectonic conditions favored the preservation of Proterozoic sediments in the Wadi al'Arabah as Cambrian sandstones began to form. The continental, marine and calcareous sandstones accumulated as the Tethys Ocean transgressed the region, followed by a late Cambrian marine regression marked by a return to more terrestrial sandstones. During the Ordovician a new transgression flooded more of the land surface, leading to argillite deposition and marine conditions persisted through most of the Silurian except for a mid-Silurian interruption of red-brown sandstones. Nearshore and continental conditions persisted through the Carboniferous, recorded by calcareous and continental sandstones. Mesozoic (251-66 million years ago) The Tethys Ocean transgressed the landscape in the Triassic, leaving a new sequence of sedimentary rocks with a disconformity with underlying Paleozoic rocks. Sea levels dropped in the Late Triassic and then rose in the Jurassic. Volcanism and uplift came in advance of early Cretaceous deposition. A major marine transgression reach the current Jordan River. Marl and siliceous rocks deposited during continued transgression in the Albian, Turonian, Santonian, Campanian and Maastrichtian, while continental deposition took place in the Nubo-Arabian Shield in the southeast. The Sirhan Basin, Al Jafr Basin and Al Azraq Wadi all accumulated significant sediment thicknesses. Chert and phosphorite layers are common from the period. Cenozoic (66 million years ago-present) At the beginning of the Cenozoic, through the Paleocene and Eocene, similar deposition to the Cretaceous took place, including bituminous limestone and marl. Rifting began in the Oligocene, forming the Jordan Rift Valley. The resulting depression was probably occupied by a sequence of lakes or shallow marine environments. From the Miocene through the Pliocene, a marine environment that may have been a branch of the Mediterranean reached the Red Sea through the Rift Valley, reaching basalt flows in Djebel ed Drouz. Up to four kilometers of evaporites formed into the early Pleistocene.

The holotype specimen was discovered in the Liushu Formation near the Zhuangkeji Township in Guanghe County, Gansu Province. The specimen consists of an almost complete skeleton of a young adult (perhaps a male, since it appears to have had a spur), though part of the skull and the neck vertebrae were reconstructed in plaster before the specimen was acquired by the Hezheng Paleozoological Museum. The specimen also preserves an elongated, coiled trachea (or windpipe), the oldest known bird fossil with such a structure. The specimen was made the basis of the new genus and species Panraogallus hezhengensis by the Chinese palaeontologist Zhihen Li and colleagues in 2018. The generic name is the pinyin of the Chinese characters for \\"coiling\\" and Latin for \\"chicken\\", which refers to the elongated trachea; \\"coiled chicken\\" in full. The specific name refers to the Hezheng area, where abundant specimens of this bird have been found. Thoracic region of the holotype, with diagram below showing the tracheal loop in red, and comparison with those of modern birds on the right Within Phasianidae, Panraogallus was found to be most closely related to the extant genus Perdix and members of the subfamilies Phasianinae, Tetraoninae, and Meleagridinae. The elongation of the trachea is related to vocal modification, and has happened independently many times among birds, while Panraogallus is the first known pheasant with such an adaptation. The trachea of Panraogallus appears to have coiled twice outside its chest, and may have coiled back towards the chest, before going up to the chest cavity again where it attached to the lungs. The presence of this feature in Panraogallus indicates it has evolved more than one time independently within Galliformes, and does not appear to correlate with whether a galliform bird lived in open or closed habitat. Two extant phasianids are known with an elongated trachea, the western capercaillie and the rock ptarmigan. The evolution of a tracheal loop has been proposed to help with \\"size exaggeration\\", where smaller birds can produce bigger sounds for signalling and communication. The coiled trachea of Panraogallus was possibly longer than its body, and it probably produced sounds with a lower frequency and with reduced harmonics, compared to pheasants of a similar size. Previously, other functions have been proposed for the presence of an elongated trachea, such as thermoregulation, but these are considered unlikely today. Since some features of the fossil are associated with sexual dimorphism, both the morphology and mechanism for vocalisation in Panraogallus may have evolved through Sexual selection. The avifauna known from the Miocene deposits of Gansu Province also includes an extinct kestrel, an ostrich, and Old World vultures. Other animals include rhinoceroses and three-toed horses.

Its origins are unclear, however it traces to the Ancient Greeks. The idea of political obligation is philosophical, focusing on the morality of laws, rather than justice. Discussion of political obligation grew during the era of social contract theory, in which Thomas Hobbes and John Locke were crucial in explaining the idea and its importance. Political obligation is distinct from legal obligation.  History  The idea of political obligation was renewed by Thomas Hill Green around the late 1800s. Green discussed the idea as \\"obedience to the law.\\" A more detailed look at the term can be traced to Socrates and Plato. Dudley Knowles considered the topic in his book Political Obligation: A Critical Introduction.  Socrates  The earliest understanding of political obligation can be traced back to the teachings of Socrates. One account recalls his imprisonment and death sentence for \\"corrupting the morals of the youth\\". Instead of escaping, he chose to stay and accept his punishment, as he found it morally wrong to evade his punishment. In Crito, Socrates describes the struggle man has with the rule of law and the connection it has with political obligation.  Divinity and morality  One claim is that the obligations of an individual to society is divinely ordained. Christianity has been a catalyst in this thinking. This requires acceptance of the existence of the divine and the linkage between the divine and the political realms are clear.  Social contract  Hobbes believed that society needed authority in order to thrive. More specifically, he saw it as a fight among humans to wield power. Hobbes accepted the idea of political obligation, stating that government and laws were needed to thrive as a society. Hobbes and Locke agreed on the idea of individual freedom. They both saw that this freedom was limited and accompanied by an obligation to obey the law.

Very little improvement has been made since the end of the Laotian Civil War in 1975, especially compared to peer nations such as Thailand. By 2015, 76% of Laotians nationwide were estimated to have access to ‚Äúimproved‚Äù water (water not taken directly from natural flows), while 71% were estimated to have access to ‚Äúimproved‚Äù sanitation (access to a sewage system more advanced than simple latrine).Ensure access to water and sanitation for all http://www.la.one.un.org/sdgs/sdg-6-water-and-sanitation Map of Mekong River‚Äìit covers a wide area of Laos and nearby regionThe Mekong River provides an important source of water for rice production in LaosTheun Hinboun Dam Wall. Dams like these provide a renewable energy source for Laos, but can negatively impact the Mekong River ecosystem National-average numbers for sanitation obscure some important internal variation between city and rural. Most Laotians get their water from surface flows close to their dwellings, so infrastructure is minimal. Outside of the cities, women and small children are often tasked with carrying drinking water by hand from rural collection sites, which impacts educational attainment, economic growth, and rural quality of life.Water, Sanitation & Hygiene and Climate Change Resilience https://www.unicef.org/laos/wash In the capital, Vientiane, aging sewage systems work poorly and are overdue for infrastructural improvement. Moreover, there is an ongoing gap between rural and town dwellers, with 60% fewer rural people having access to sanitation, and 38% fewer having access to drinking water. An estimated 23% of Laotians nationwide still habitually defecate on open ground,http://www.la.one.un.org/sdgs/sdg-6-water-and-sanitation allowing their waste to wash into rivers and canals. This persistent reality affects agriculture and natural ecosystems as well as human health.  Access to Water  According to the World Bank data conducted in 2014, Laos has met the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) targets on water and sanitation regarding UNICEF/WHO Joint Monitoring Program. However, as of today, there are approximately 1.9 million Lao population could not access to improved water supply and 2.4 million people without access to improved sanitation due to a large inequalities access between areas that are close to good roads and remote inaccessible locations. Poor sanitation can affect people's health and national economic development. Annually, poor sanitation and hygiene problem cause three million disease cases in Lao, 6.000 premature deaths and the children in rural areas suffer from poor sanitation is very high at 49 percent in 2011 making 193 million dollar national economic loss per year, equal to 5.6% of GDP. In Laos, there are major incidences of dysentery and diarrhea caused partly by deficient sanitation, improper water supply, and the absence of adequate wastewater treatment facilities as a result of the rapid increase in urban population. Laos people who can get access to sanitation in rural areas account for only 36 percent in 2004. The government in Laos adopted the Millennium Development as prepared collaborative by the United Nations, World Bank and International Mutual Fund to promote water supply and sanitation for its people to access safe drinking and basic sanitation.  Water resources   Mekong River  The Mekong River plays an important role in the economy of Laos. The Mekong River basin covers nearly 90 per cent of Laos country and drains toward Vietnam. The capacity of Mekong River's basin to sustain food security and water availability in the Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR) is largely hindered by competing economic, ecological, and political interests. In Laos, the government encourages hydro-power investment, which increases pressure on water and sea animal threats. The development of electricity in Laos and export to neighbouring countries are essential for government revenues to reduce poverty. Although hydro-power does not pollute water or air directly, hydro-power reservoir and dam can impact the change in environment, land use, and natural habitats. There are potential environmental consequences of damming water, creating gigantic reservoirs, flooding the entire area, blocking the natural course of the river and constructing power lines. For example, the structure of dam and reservoir interfere fishing migration and alter water temperature and river's flow; as a result. It may injure the life of sea animals and animals on land. Mekong River and the lives of people People use Mekong River stream directly for drinking, cooking, bathing and washing. However, as the population increases, watercourses that are used simultaneously for water disposal and water supply cause health issues like diarrhea and typhoid. Meanwhile, locals stated that before the upstream dams were built, they could safely drink the Mekong River water. However, after the Xayaburi Dam in Laos was built, the water quality became contaminated. The water quality in Laos become even worse when a new dam was built in Don Sahong, less than 2 kilometers from the town, causing the population get diarrhoea and inhale with bad air quality. Besides, fisheries contribute about 13 percent of Laos national GDP per year. Most population live near the Mekong river found dead fish floating in polluted water in the area between the Don Sahong Dam and Preah Rumkel (Cambodia) which made their only source of water for drinking, cooking, fishing and everyday chores as disaster.  Water Quality  There is a high chance of getting malaria for those who live around the water which is surrounded by mosquitoes. Through the Millennium Development program, some progresses have been achieved over the past decade in improving healthy system in Laos. The number of health facilities increased by 75 percents, mortality from malaria reduced by 60 percent in rural areas. However, Lao population has been meet healthy living standard. In some rural areas, people are lacked of safe drinking water, chemical runoff, sewage and limited access to health services. For example, malnutrition, non-hygienic lifestyle, poverty are caused by inadequate public health services. Although Lao is one of the dominant renewable water resource in Asia, 25 percent of urban dwellers and 40 percent of rural Lao population are lacked access to safe drinking water. In certain location, villagers have to walk up to 2 kilometer to get access to water. The environmental quality can essentially affect well-being and quality of live. Poor air quality is associated with premature death, cancer, and long term harm to respiratory and cardiovascular system. Furthermore, environmental health encounters from household air pollution appear to be significantly disproportionate which affect the poor population in Lao PDR. Most than 95 percents of Lao population use coal and wood for everyday cooking which can cause indoor air pollution and health issues with a life expectancy of 56 years in 2008. Recognizing this potential environmental health issue, the government starts pay close attention to poverty embraces important environment service such as access to safe water and sanitation. Drinking water sources that are contaminated with harmful chemicals and human waste can cause diseases in children such as gastrointestinal illness, and developmental affects such as learning disorders and cancer. UNICEF works in Lao PDR to help ensure children and families in homes and schools have access to clean water and sanitation facilities. Many rural communities are unaware of appropriate sanitation and hygiene practices. Approximately 24% of the population practice open defecation, and only 28% of children's faces are disposed of safely. Hazardous chemicals that include heavy metals such as chromium, copper, zinc and persistent organic pollutants such as furans, dioxins and poly-chlorinated phenytoin are widely banned while Lao population are not fully aware of its catastrophic effects. As the population in Lao keeps growing, heavy mental contamination from industrial activities increases which lead to a concern toward rudimentary metal smelting facilities in the country and mining activities. Therefore, the surface water quality in downstream of mining and industrial activities become a potential problem for Laos well being. The quality of Mekong River can be assessed by diverse chemical and physical parameter. For example, poly cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is one of the essential types of persistent pollutants of toxicity from natural resources of water and sediment. According to Environmental Quality Standards, the environmental distribution of PAHs in tropic Asia become a concern of this region as the grow of industrialization and urbanization due to a frequent rain inherent to tropic Asia in which facilitate the transfer of leaked petroleum from land to rivers and coastal water. In most urban areas in Lao PDR, the pollutants from private properties wash into drains. Little, dirt and rubber compounds from metal, glass and plastic from properties contribute to sediments and nutrients. The major problems associate toward national goal in the Lao water and sanitation involve the absence of national programs to scale up rural hygiene education, inefficient annual budget allocation in rural areas, and weak sector monitoring for rural water supply as well as sanitation. Therefore, in order to improve water and sanitation target for 2020, the Implementation of Water Supply Sector Investment Plan and the National Plan of Action for Rural Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene; capital investment is notably needed to finance the operations.

The son of Charles Clark of Princeland, he was born in Scotland at Coupar Angus, Perthshire, to Marjory, n√©e Barclay. His great uncle, advocate and judge William Nairne (Lord Dunsinane), provided his early education at Dunsinnan House in Collace, and he studied law to become appointed a life long public notary. He arrived at Fremantle, Western Australia aboard the ship Eliza in March 1831 and began to practice law there. Clark was involved in a violent dispute with George French Johnson (1799‚Äì1832), the latter being accused of \\"clandestine transactions\\". After a verbal altercation on the street the two met to duel at Richmond House on the morning of the seventeenth of August, 1832, and Johnson was killed in the first duel recorded in the state; Clark was tried and cleared of the charge of manslaughter that followed. Johnson had previously been engaged with Clark in a brief publishing venture known as The Inquisitor, their former partnership being the source of the dispute. He later began to draw on his experience in journalism to begin publishing in the new colony, his brief work Report of the Late Trial for Libel!!! Clarke versus MacFaul (Fremantle, 1835), has been noted by academic Geoffrey Bolton and others as the first publication in Western Australia. The text concerns a court settlement in favour of a Captain Clark, of the vessel Skerne, whose seamanship had been questioned in the pages of the Perth Gazette. A letter of apology was refused by Clark and the court's determination found the publication was slanderous in their comments on the captain and the proprietor Charles Macfaull was ordered to pay ¬£21 in damages.Steve Howell and Jane Jones, Our Prized Possessions - Rarities Revealed : An Exhibition of WA Stories and Treasure (30 June to 26 August 2007). The work was produced on a Ruthven printing press that had been delivered to the colony in 1831, from Tasmania; the printer was W. T. Graham of Fremantle. This book was followed by his contributions to another newspaper, Swan River Guardian, and he eventually assumed editorial control of that publication between 1836 and 1838. The Guardian was a competitor to the Perth Gazette, joining the alternatives that were a politically influential feature of the new colony's print media. Clark's paper was often directed at the political elite, the acting governor Frederick Irwin, Peter Broun and George Fletcher Moore; his criticism of James Stirling was later tempered to a view that he was a good man misled by others. The ex-catholic cum missionary Louis Giustiniani, who returned from a tour of York decrying the treatment of the indigenous inhabitants he had been appointed to Christianise, entered into an alliance with Clark to denounce the governor and gentry at Perth in his Swan River Guardian. After a series of violent acts or reprisals, the popular sentiments of the colonists was challenged by Clark in an editorial that suggested the outcome of any war was the certain destruction of one or the other of the parties and ought to be dreaded by both. Clark sought to present himself as people's champion, so was strident in his criticism of what he portrayed as an aristocratic elite. In reporting the meeting of the Western Australian Agricultural Society, he proposed the organisation of tradesmen and employees in response to the elites, \\"labourers, mechanics etc., ought to form a Society of their own for the protection of mutual rights, and send quarterly reports to the Secretary of State ‚Ä¶\\". The Guardian ended in 1838, unable to operate without a loss, and his next attempt to establish an alternative to the Gazette was the Political Register; this was also unable to provide the ¬£200 that the state had recently enacted, purportedly to provide surety if charges of libel were won by a plaintiff. Clark's family was also suffering loss at this time; his son, Charles, aged four years and five months, died 7 May 1838, following the death of his sister, Anne Catharine, 8 April of the same year, falling short of her second birthday. A land grant of 4600 acres was given to Clark and a Mr. C. Spyers at Wadjemup (Rottnest Island), west of Fremantle, and in the district around inland York to the east of the settlers' establishment at Perth, Western Australia. He attempted to start the societies first suggested in the pages of the Guardian before its demise; these were founded as the \\"Shephards' Club\\" and \\"Mutual Protection Society\\" to address established grievances with employers, but did not appear to continue beyond 1843. He journeyed to explore the southern regions between King George Sound (Albany) and Kojonup during the period 1840 to 1842. He was helped in this work by sealers and whalers in the region who provided him with boats, provisions and information.Ross Anderson, \\"The role of sealers, whalers and Aboriginal people in the exploration of Western Australia's southern ocean frontier,\\" The Great Circle, 40 (2) November 2018, pp.19-20. Clark left for Tasmania at the end of 1848, where no warranted official was available for his recognition as a public notary and he instead resumed a career in journalism at the colony. The uncertain report of his death on 15 February 1854 was not recorded by the Registrar-General's Department. His death notice in the Hobart newspaper The Courier gave his birthplace as \\"Coupar Angus\\", as formerly at the Colonist and his place of death as H. M. General Hospital of Hobart town on the 19th of February, 1854. Amongst the recognition of his works and contributions, aside from the contemporary notability of his firsts in publishing and duelling, he is noted by Dominic Serventy and Hubert Whittell in the seminal work Birds of Western Australia (1948, et seq) as having published observations on birds of Southwest Australia and the first list of its avifauna. His poetry has occasionally been selected for anthologies of historic prose or republished in Australian newspapers.

The team changed their name to Apex Motorsport and debuted the Bentley EXP Speed 8 in and finished with one car on the race podium. A fourth-place finish followed in before Apex joined with Joest Racing, who had been running Audi's continued Le Mans program, to campaign two cars in 2003 at the 12 Hours of Sebring as well as Le Mans. Third and fourth places were earned at Sebring, while Team Bentley scored a one-two finish at Le Mans, with Tom Kristensen, Rinaldo Capello, and Guy Smith driving the winning car. Bentley's program ended after the Le Mans victory, and Apex Motorsport was left without any Volkswagen Group programs and remained stagnant for two years. The team's assets were put up for auction in 2006 to no avail. Lloyd, along with racing driver and entrepreneur Harry Handkammer, approached Jaguar Cars to develop a Group GT3 sportscar program. Built around the Jaguar XKR, Apex and Jaguar agreed to build cars for the team as well as cars to be sold to customers to justify the cost of the program. The team first raced the cars late in the 2007 season for the international FIA GT3 European Championship and British GT Championship. While developing the Jaguars in March 2008, Lloyd and team member Christopher Allarton, along with racing driver David Leslie were en route to Nogaro Circuit for testing when their aircraft crashed near Biggin Hill. All three, plus two pilots, were killed in the crash. Despite the loss for the team, they continued their FIA GT3 campaign for the season, and pushed with further development of the car in 2009. However the project came to an early close in 2009 after no cars had been sold to customers and the team was dissolved by 2014.

It belonged to the Odobenidae family, which is today only represented by the walrus, but was much more diverse in the past, containing at least 16 genera. Unlike the modern walrus, Archaeodobenus did not have tusks but instead had canines of moderate size, and looked more like a sea lion.  Discovery  The first known specimen was collected in 1977 from the Ichibangawa Formation in Tobetsu Town on the island of Hokkaido. The specimen consists of a partial skull, vertebrae, and limb bones, and was made the holotype specimen of the new genus and species A. akamatsui by the Japanese palaeontologists Yoshihiro Tanaka and Naoki Kohno in 2015. The generic name consists of archaio-, the Greek word for ancient, and the generic name of the walrus, Odobenus; in full, \\"ancient walrus.\\" The specific name honors Morio Akamatsu, a curator of the Hokkaido Museum. The holotype specimen appears to have been a young adult male of about 3 metres (10 ft) in length, which would have weighed around 473 kg (1,042 lb). This is intermediate between the size of the Steller sea lion and the South American sea lion. Its canines were 86.3 mm (3.4 in) long, compared to modern walrus tusks, which can grow to up to 1 m (3 ft 3 in) long. Archaeodobenus can be distinguished from Pseudotaria by features such as the shape and size of the occipital condyle (which connects with the first neck vertebra at the back of the skull), the foramen magnum (the opening through which the spinal chord passes into the cranium), the mastoid process (where various muscles attach to the back of the skull), and some features in the postcranial skeleton.restoration of a pair  Classification  The diversity of odobenids increased during the Late Miocene and Pliocene (about 12.5 million to 10.5 million years ago), perhaps linked to marine regression and transgression, which could have geographically isolated their ancestors. Archaeodobenus was the contemporary of the odobenid Pseudotaria from the same formation, which it may have diverged from in the western North Pacific during the Late Miocene. Archaeodobenus appears to have been closer related to later odobenids such as Imagotaria, Pontolis, the subfamily Odobeninae, whereas Pseudotaria seems to have been more basal.

The attacks have been attributed to the Glenanne gang which was a coalition of right-wing Loyalist paramilitaries and subversive members of the British security forces.Former Policeman blows the whistle on murderous Glenanne Gang in new documentary The Irish News, 15 June 2018 Background Since late 1975 there had been a number of deadly sectarian attacks carried out by both Irish Republican and Loyalist paramilitaries in County Armagh. On 15 December, 17 year old Catholic civilian Ronald Trainor, a member of the Irish Republican Socialist Party (believed to be the political wing of the Irish National Liberation Army), was killed by the UVF in Portadown. On the 19 December 1975 the Loyalist Red Hand Commando claimed responsibility for killing three Catholic civilians in a pub in Silverbridge, County Armagh. On the 31 December the Irish National Liberation Army using the covername \\"Armagh People's Republican Army\\" killed three Protestant civilians when they bombed a pub near Portadown. At the start of January Loyalists gunmen killed six Catholic civilians in a double attack in County Armagh. The next day a group calling itself the South Armagh Republican Action Force killed 10 Protestant civilian workmen in what became known as the Kingsmill massacre. Attacks Locals claimed that the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) had been patrolling the village for a number of nights beforehand, but were absent the night of the attacks. On the night of the 15 May 1976 at around 10:50 pm the Eagles Bar in Charlemont in Armagh was sprayed with gunfire from a Sten submachine gun, four people had been hit and injured in the attack. Probably more would have been injured but the owner of the bar placed security shutters on the windows in case of an attack. One of those who was injured was Fred McLoughlin (47) who died two weeks later in hospital from his injuries. Almost instantly after the gunfire had stopped a loud bang was heard, this was the bomb that had gone off at Clancy's bar only a short distance away.Anne Cadwallader - Lethal Allies: British Collusion In Ireland pp.173 The bomb had been placed at the front of the pubs door by the UVF unit and exploded right after the attack on the other pub had ended. The force of the blast brought the ceiling crashing down on the people inside the pub. Three people were killed in this bomb attack including Sean O'Hagan (22), Robert McCullough (41) and the pubs owner Felix \\"Vincy\\" Clancy (54) the pubs owner who had only just returned from the Eagle Bar a few minutes earlier. About 15 people had been injured in the attack, some of them seriously.Anne Cadwallader - Lethal Allies: British Collusion In Ireland pp.174 Aftermath A member of the British Territorial Army Gerald Beattie and British UDR soldier David Kane were convicted of the shooting at the Eagle's Bar, and a RUC reservist Joseph Lutton for the bombing at Clancy's Bar, although Lutton named Beattie and Kane as having also taken part in the bombing at Clancy's they were given no further time on to their sentences or even interviewed about the bombing.Anne Cadwallader - Lethal Allies: British Collusion In Ireland pp.178-179 Two days after the Charlemont attacks the Republican Action Force claimed responsibility for killing Protestant civilians Robert and Thomas Dobson in Moy, County Tyrone, apparently in retaliation for the 15 May pub attacks.Anne Cadwallader - Lethal Allies: British Collusion In Ireland pp.14 See also *Donnelly's Bar and Kay's Tavern attacks *Reavey and O'Dowd killings *Castleblayney bombing *Hillcrest Bar bombing *Glenanne gang *Loughinisland massacre *Timeline of Ulster Volunteer Force actions References Category:Explosions in 1976 Category:Royal Ulster Constabulary Category:The Troubles in County Armagh Category:1976 crimes in the United Kingdom Category:1976 in Northern Ireland Category:Improvised explosive device bombings in Northern Ireland Category:Terrorist incidents in the United Kingdom in 1976 Category:Mass murder in 1976 Category:Terrorist incidents in Northern Ireland Category:Deaths by firearm in Northern Ireland Category:People killed by security forces during The Troubles (Northern Ireland) Category:People killed by the Ulster Volunteer Force Category:Police misconduct in Northern Ireland Category:Spree shootings in Northern Ireland Category:May 1976 events in the United Kingdom Category:Attacks on bars in the United Kingdom Category:1970s mass shootings in Europe ","title":"Charlemont pub attacks"},{"id":"58943031","text":"Ross F.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Milwaukee's fire department began in 1837 as a small volunteer fire company. Its equipment consisted of buckets, axes and some ladders, all kept in a shed in the central business district. In 1839 the company acquired its first \\"fire engine,\\" which amounted to a hand-operated pump mounted on a wagon pulled to fires by men on foot. They named that first engine Neptune. With In 1845 the company bought a larger hand-pump with 300 feet of hose. Over the years the city's fire-fighting system continued to develop, dividing the city into fire districts in the 1850s, buying larger pumps which could reach the upper floors of five story buildings in the 1860s and adding horses to pull those pumps, and shifting from volunteer fire fighters to paid firemen starting in the 1860s. In 1869, a system of fire alarm boxes was installed throughout the city, connected by sixty miles of telegraph lines. The first full-time paid firemen came in 1874, while Henry Lippert was fire chief. Lippert was an immigrant from Weimar, Germany who had worked his way up through the volunteer fire department. In 1876 the city built Chemical Engine House No. 1, which would be named the Chief Lippert Station, in a growing new neighborhood north of the downtown. The neighborhood consisted largely of tightly-packed houses built of wood, so a fire station was needed, but municipal water lines had not yet reached the neighborhood. Homes were fed by private wells which were inadequate to supply a water pumper, so instead, the new station was built to house a \\"chemical fire engine,\\" which could douse a fire with chemicals similar to a modern fire extinguisher. The 1876 building was a two-story, cream brick building with a hip roof. It was designed by Milwaukee architect Thomas N. Philpot in Italianate style, with broad wooden eaves and a pedimented gable at the front. The decorative brickwork suggests pilasters, and the windows have round-arched tops. The wooden corner tower was probably added around 1883, originally seven stories tall, a watch tower from which firemen could look out over the surrounding city for smoke. By 1883, water mains had reached throughout the neighborhood, so the chemical engine was no longer needed. It was replaced at the Lippert Station with a steam- powered fire engine pulled by horses. In 1908 a two-story cream brick block was added at the rear of the building to house horses and a hayloft. It was designed by Sebastian Brand, a fire fighter in the Milwaukee department who had immigrated from Germany. Motorized trucks entered the Milwaukee fire department in 1915, but didn't replace the horses at the Lippert station until 1927. In the 1930s the seven-story watch-tower was no longer needed, given the ability of people to call in fires on telephones, and most of the 50-year-old wooden tower was torn off, reducing it to the three stories that remain today. In 1948 the Lippert station was no longer needed as a fire station. The building served as a branch library starting in 1951. Starting in 1972 it housed offices of the Model Cities Program. In 1977 it became the headquarters of the Inner City Arts Council, which painted the mural on the building's west side in 1984. Today the Chief Lippert station is Milwaukee's oldest well- preserved fire station, one of the first carefully designed as a fire station with living quarters for the crew, rather than a simple shed to house equipment. It is also the only remaining Italianate public building from an era when Milwaukee's city hall was Italianate, along with other firehouses and schools.

Administered by a federal council based in the Australian Capital Territory, the society has state and regional branches in all states of Australia, except New South Wales, which split from the organisation in 1968. The society has published a quarterly journal, Sabretache, continuously since mid-1958. History Formed on 17 May 1957 in Melbourne, the society was originally known as the \\"Military Collectors Society\\". This name was changed in July 1959 to the \\"Military Research and Collectors Society of Australia\\", before being changed to its current name in April 1964. These changes reflected the evolution of the society's focus from modelling, uniforms, badges and other collectables towards military history more broadly. The society's first president was Robert Powell, with Alfred Festberg as Secretary and Barry Videon as Treasurer and editor of the society journal. In 1961, the society began expanding, with the New South Wales branch being established at Punchbowl. This was followed by an Australian Capital Territory (ACT) branch in 1963, a Victorian branch in 1965, and a South Australian branch in 1966. In 1968, two more branches were added in Western Australia and Geelong. The final branches were added in Albury‚ÄìWodonga in 1977 and Tasmania in 2011. Of these, though, several have closed: the New South Wales branch split away from the society in 1968, forming the Military Historical Society of New South Wales, while the Albury‚ÄìWodonga branch closed in 2012 due to declining membership, and the Geelong branch closed in 2016, with some members forming the Geelong Military Reenactment Group. In 2009, the Victorian branch relocated from Toorak Bowling Club, to the Oakleigh-Carnegie Returned and Services League Club. The society currently aims to encourage \\"study and research in military history, customs, traditions, dress, arms, equipment ‚Ä¶ the promotion of public interest and knowledge in these subjects, and the preservation of historical military objects with particular reference to the armed forces of Australia\\". Now administered from Garran, in the Australian Capital Territory, it is governed by a constitution and has a federal council consisting of a president, vice president, treasurer and secretary, and as of March 2017 had 311 members across Australia. While many members of the society are ex-service personnel, membership is open to anyone interested in military history, and members range in age \\"from their 20s to their 80s\\". Each regional or state branch also has a president, secretary and treasurer, and hold regular meetings throughout the year. National conferences are biennial, and are hosted by a regional or state branch on rotation. The 2014 conference was held in Maryborough, Queensland, and included presentations looking at the history of HMS Bounty, in association with the Museum of Tropical Queensland. The University of South Australia's Narratives of War research group worked with the society's South Australian branch to plan the 2017 conference. The activities of the ACT branch have been covered in The Canberra Times since the branch was established. The branch held annual exhibitions throughout this period, which included displays of medals, uniforms, badges, captured war materials, and firearms. In 1988, the branch hosted a talk by Professor Syd Wise focusing on American Civil War battlefields. A symposium was also held the same year, focusing on Australian military history between 1788 and 1988. In June 2000, the branch hosted the society's the biennial conference, focusing on the Boer War, over three days at the Canberra Returned and Services League Club. As well as presentations from several historians, the conference included displays of weapons and uniforms, and a tour of the Australian War Memorial and other memorials along Anzac Parade. Presidents and patrons Nigel Webster is the current president, and the society's current patron is retired Lieutenant General Peter Leahy, who succeeded retired Air Marshal Barry Gration. Past presidents include: Rohan Goyan, Robert Powell, Barry Videon, Alfred Festberg, Warren Perry, John Lyons, Neville Foldi, John Frewen, Ian Barnes, Ian Teague, Hans Zwillenberg, Tan Roberts, Roger Lee, and Robert Morrison. Journal The society is funded by an annual membership subscription, and publishes the quarterly journal Sabretache, subtitled The Journal and Proceedings of the Military Historical Society of Australia.

Biography  Nikolai Kozlenya was born in 1971 in the town of Bolotnoye into a family of railroad workers. Shortly after his birth, his family moved to the city of Tayga, Kemerovo Oblast. He graduated from the local school and entered the railway college, where he was a well-performing student and headman of his study group. After graduation, Kozlenya went to serve in the army, where he was subjected to bullying by his drunken seniors. According to the investigator who examined the case later on, it was these factors which caused a change in Kozlenya's psyche. While in the army, he tried to slice open his vein, but the suicide attempt failed. After this, Kozlenya was commissioned.–î–æ–∫—É–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π —Ñ–∏–ª—å–º –∏–∑ —Ü–∏–∫–ª–∞ ¬´–ö—Ä–∏–º–∏–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω–∞—è –†–æ—Å—Å–∏—è¬ª ‚Äî ¬´–í–µ–∑–∏ –º–µ–Ω—è, –∏–∑–≤–æ–∑—á–∏–∫!¬ª After returning home, Kozlenya worked for several years as a platelayer, where he was regarded as a good worker. After that, he entered the Siberian State Transport University, from which, after studying there for some time, he eventually left. He then tried to start his own business, but quickly went bankrupt. An investigator into the case later told:  Murders  The first attempted murder Kozlenya made was in November 1998 in Tomsk when he, having walked in a restaurant, found out that he did not have enough money to pay the bill. Leaving his jacket as a pledge, he left the restaurant and stopped a private driver. Having successfully stopped him, Kozlenya pulled out a knife and tried to kill the driver, wounding him in the neck. The man actively resisted and managed to survive, and the criminal escaped, leaving the knife and never taking his jacket from the restaurant. His identity was fairly quickly established and put on the federal wanted list. Having decided to engage in criminal industry, Kozlenya returned to Novosibirsk and bought a sawed-off shotgun from Tula. After that, he rented a garage (later he changed garages several times) and started committing crimes. All crimes committed by Kozlenya were done in the same way: he would hide the sawn-off shotgun in a sports bag and then stopped drivers without bargaining, agreeing to the offered prices, and then would sit in the back of the seat. Kozlenya then called the address, not far from the rented garage. Having reached the place, Kozlenya would shoot the driver in the head, then put his corpse to the right passenger seat. The following six murders Kozlenya committed with the help of his underage partner, Bobovich, who distracted the drivers while the killer took out his weapon. Kozlenya threatened her, forcing her to flirt with buyers of spare parts, so that they were more compliant. The car from the first murder Kozlenya disposed of in a random yard, then disassembled it for parts and sold them afterwards. The next three murders he committed using one car, which he eventually took away from his garage and burned. One of these murders was committed precisely in order to take possession of the car, and then burn it.  Arrest, trial and sentence  In early 2001, Kozlenya decided to flee from Novosibirsk, but was soon detained in Chelyabinsk. Bobovich was also detained, but the court subsequently acquitted her. Kozlenya confessed to the 7 murders, but during the investigation he pretended to be insane several times, and also tried to convince the authorities he was innocent. In December 2002, the court sentenced Nikolai Kozlenya to life imprisonment in a special regime colony. He is still serving his sentence to this day.

The game is parameterized by two integers n > k. The game-board is the set of all edges of a complete graph on n vertices. The winning-sets are all the cliques on k vertices. There are several variants of this game: * In the strong positional variant of the game, the first player who holds a k-clique wins. If no one wins, it is a draw. * In the Maker-Breaker variant , the first player (Maker) wins if he manages to hold a k-clique, otherwise the second player (Breaker) wins. There are no draws. * In the Avoider-Enforcer variant, the first player (Avoider) wins if he manages to not hold a k-clique, otherwise the second player (Enforcer) wins. There are no draws. A special case of this variant is Sim. The clique game (in its strong-positional variant) was first presented by Paul Erd≈ës and John Selfridge, who attributed it to Simmons. They called it the Ramsey game, since it is closely related to Ramsey's theorem (see below).  Winning conditions  Ramsey's theorem implies that, whenever we color a graph with 2 colors, there is at least one monochromatic clique. Moreover, for every integer k, there exists an integer R(k,k) such that, in every graph with n \\\\geq R_2(k,k) vertices, any 2-coloring contains a monochromatic clique of size at least k. This means that, if n \\\\geq R_2(k,k), the clique game can never end in a draw. a Strategy-stealing argument implies that the first player can always force at least a draw; therefore, if n \\\\geq R_2(k,k), Maker wins. By substituting known bounds for the Ramsey number we get that Maker wins whenever k \\\\leq {\\\\log_2 n\\\\over 2}. On the other hand, the Erdos-Selfridge theorem implies that Breaker wins whenever k \\\\geq {2 \\\\log_2 n}. Beck improved these bounds as follows: * Maker wins whenever k \\\\leq 2 \\\\log_2 n - 2\\\\log_2\\\\log_2 n + 2\\\\log_2 e - 10/3 + o(1); * Breaker wins whenever k \\\\geq 2 \\\\log_2 n - 2\\\\log_2\\\\log_2 n + 2\\\\log_2 e - 1 + o(1).  Ramsey game on higher- order hypergraphs  Instead of playing on complete graphs, the clique game can also be played on complete hypergraphs of higher orders. For example, in the clique game on triplets, the game-board is the set of triplets of integers 1,...,n (so its size is {n \\\\choose 3} ), and winning-sets are all sets of triplets of k integers (so the size of any winning-set in it is {k \\\\choose 3}). By Ramsey's theorem on triples, if n \\\\geq R_3(k,k), Maker wins. The currently known upper bound on R_3(k,k) is very large, 2^{k^2/6} < R_3(k,k) < 2^{2^{4k-10}}. In contrast, Beck proves that 2^{k^2/6} < R^*_3(k,k) < k^4 2^{k^3/6}, where R^*_3(k,k) is the smallest integer such that Maker has a winning strategy. In particular, if k^4 2^{k^3/6} < n then the game is Maker's win.  References  Category:Positional games ","title":"Clique game"},{"id":"58943886","text":"Lacrampe is a French surname.

The game is parameterized by two integers n > k. The game- board is the set {1,...,n}. The winning-sets are all the arithmetic progressions of length k. In a Maker-Breaker game variant, the first player (Maker) wins by occupying a k-length arithmetic progression, otherwise the second player (Breaker) wins. The game is also called the van der Waerden game, named after Van der Waerden's theorem. It says that, for any k, there exists some integer W(2,k) such that, if the integers {1, ..., W(2,k)} are partitioned arbitrarily into two sets, then at least one set contains an arithmetic progression of length k. This means that, if n \\\\geq W(2,k), then Maker has a winning strategy. Unfortunately, this claim is not constructive - it does not show a specific strategy for Maker.

History Taichu Prefectural Hall during the Japanese rule of Taiwan The building was originally constructed in 1913 during the Japanese rule of Taiwan as the Taichu Prefectural Hall () which housed the city hall of Taich≈´ Prefecture. The last of four expansions was completed in 1934. It was then used as the office of Environmental Protection Bureau of Taichung City Government. The building was designated as a historic building in 2002 and as a city-designated historic building in 2006. In November 2017, the Bureau of Cultural Affairs requested the city government to assign the national heritage status to the former city hall. The application for national heritage status was formally submitted by the Taichung City Government in April 2018. The Taichung Prefectural Hall was officially designated a national historic monument in January 2019. In 2018, it was decided to transform the building into the Taichung Prefectural Hall Park which was expected to be completed by 2021. The project was part of the efforts to revitalize the historic district of Taichung by the Ministry of Culture. The project was estimated to cost NT$1.05 billion and an additional budget of NT$1.2 billion was set for the establishment of an archive for local art history and photography development. Developmental oversight of the center was led by National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts. Lu Shiow-yen announced in February 2020 that her mayoral administration was withdrawing from the agreement with NTMoFA, and that Taichung Prefectural Hall would not become a second exhibition hall for the museum. Architecture The building of the art center was constructed with Baroque architectural style with mansard roof. It was designed by Japanese architect . It has a street corner style configuration with the main entrance at the corner. The two sides of the building extended like wings. Events The building has been part of the annual Taichung Light Festival, organized by the Cultural Affairs Bureau of the city government. It also used to house other events, such as seminars.

He demonstrated that immunoglobulins and white blood cells interact directly with pathogens to protect the body from infection, and is considered a pioneer in the research of gene regulation.  Early life  Cohn was born in New York City in 1922. Although both of his parents worked in law, he chose to study physics at the City College of New York. After graduating in 1940, he entered the graduate school of Columbia University and earned his master's degree in chemistry. During World War II, Cohn was drafted into the United States Army and served in a medical research unit in the Pacific Theater. After the end of the war, he was sent to Hiroshima, Japan in 1945 to study the after-effects of the atomic bombing of the city. He also diagnosed patients affected by a major diphtheria epidemic in the country. After being discharged from the army in 1946, he attended New York University and earned his Ph.D. in biochemistry in 1949, with a specialization in immunoglobulins.  Career  From 1949 Cohn worked in Paris, France at the Pasteur Institute, conducting research on genes and cells with the French scientist Jacques Monod, who later won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. From 1955 to 1958, Cohn served as professor of microbiology at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri. In 1959, he moved to Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, where he was professor of biochemistry. Cohn's reputation as a leading researcher in molecular biology attracted the attention of Jonas Salk, who was planning to build the Salk Institute for Biological Studies. They struck a friendship as Cohn drove Salk around the San Francisco Bay Area looking at potential sites. In 1961, when Salk decided to build his institute in La Jolla in Southern California, he invited Cohn and Renato Dulbecco to serve as co- founders, which they both accepted despite the risks involved in joining a new venture which was still short of money. Cohn's wife, biologist Suzanne Bourgeois, also joined them. Cohn studied the immune system at the Salk Institute for the next 57 years. He demonstrated that immunoglobulins and white blood cells react directly to pathogens to protect the body from infection, and developed computer models to predict the immune system's response to infections.  Personal life  Cohn married Ruby Burman, a theater scholar and authority on Samuel Beckett, in 1946. They divorced in 1961. He later married again, to biologist Suzanne Bourgeois. Cohn died in San Diego, California on October 23, 2018, at the age of 96.  Honors and recognition  Some of the honors and awards Cohn had received: * (1956) * Honorary Member of the Scandinavian Society for Immunology (1978) * Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1980) * Sandoz Prize in Basic Immunology (1995)  References  Category:1922 births Category:2018 deaths Category:20th-century American biologists Category:American immunologists Category:City College of New York alumni Category:Columbia University alumni Category:New York University alumni Category:Washington University School of Medicine faculty Category:Stanford University faculty Category:Pasteur Institute Category:Scientists from New York City Category:Military personnel from New York City Category:American army personnel of World War II Category:American biochemists Category:American microbiologists Category:Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences ","title":"Melvin Cohn"},{"id":"58944101","text":"Hinduism in Vietnam is mainly observed by the ethnic Cham people.

As time passed by, the canal started to get polluted due to the urban development and industrialization of Taichung in the 1980s. However since 2014, the Taichung City Government initiated a 17-month project to revitalize the canal, which included works to improve the canal flood mitigation capability, improve the water quality and create a water-friendly environment for the area along the canal. Polluted water is diverted to a nearby Zhonghua water treatment plant to be processed before being released back to the waterway. A 610-meter long walking path was also designed along the canal. The project cost about NT$850 million. The canal was then reopened to the public on 10 February 2018. In the same month, the canal was featured at an exhibition in Taichung, which was promoted as a canal with a trademark, the first of its kind in Taiwan.

Beggan was first called up to play inter-county football for Monaghan in 2011 by Eamon McEneaney. Whilst playing county football, he gained a reputation as a goalkeeper with a long kick and was able to score points from inside his own half. Later he was designated as Monaghan's free kick taker. Keen to practice his free kicks, in 2018 he disguised himself as a member of the backroom team in order to get more practice time with Queen's University Belfast's minors team in Northern Ireland. Between 2011 and 2018, he had scored 0-43 points, the joint highest for a goalkeeper. Beggan's style of play has been viewed as an evolution of the goalkeeper position being more involved in attacking and scoring moves as ten years prior to 2019, there had been no points scored by any goalkeeper in All-Ireland competition. In 2018, he was named as an All-Ireland All-Star, despite missing a last minute scoring attempt against Tyrone in the 2018 All- Ireland Senior Football Championship semi-finals.

Described from the beginning of his career as both a tenor and a bass, he created roles in several operas, including Fileno in Michelangelo Rossi's Erminia sul Giordano and Orlando in Luigi Rossi's Il palazzo incantato. Life and career Ceccarelli was born in Bevagna. His father Pannonio was a meat carver. His grandfather Alfonso was a notorious doctor and genealogist who was executed in 1581 for falsifying documents. The first record of his activity in Rome is from 1620 when he was listed as a choir member at the church of Santo Spirito in Sassia. In 1622 he entered the Collegium Germanicum. He remained resident there for a year, but continued to sing in the choir of Sant'Apollinare, the Collegium's church, on multiple occasions up to 1645. During his time with the choir he trained with Giacomo Carissimi who trained several other prominent Roman singers, including Giuseppe Bianchi and the castrato Giovannino. Ceccarelli was also considered an outstanding interpreter of Carissimi's motets which they often performed together. Ceccarelli was appointed to the Sistine Chapel Choir in January 1628. He later served as the choir's chamberlain (camerlengo) in 1630 and its secretary (puntatore) in 1647. He was appointed maestro di cappella in 1652. In addition to his activities with the Papal choir, Ceccarelli sang in the festivities in Parma celebrating the marriage of Margherita de' Medici and Odoardo Farnese in 1628 as well as at the court of Ferdinando II in 1635 and at the church of San Luigi dei Francesi on several occasions between 1631 and 1653. He also sang in five operas performed in Rome between 1633 and 1645. Ceccarelli's La miracolosa imagine della Madonna delle Gratie published in 1647 From the earliest years of his career Ceccarelli was described in some records as a tenor and in others a bass. The musicologist Alberto Iesu√® has speculated that his true voice type was probably a bass and that he sang tenor parts in falsetto. However, in Tenor: History of a Voice, John Potter refers to a type of voice with an extended register which he calls \\"tenor-bass\\" and notes that several other virtuoso singers of the 17th century who were described as tenors by their contemporaries could also sing in the bass register. A similar view on the existence of this voice type has been expressed by Rodolfo Celletti. Ceccarelli retired from the Sistine Choir in 1658. He spent his later years as a prominent member of the Confraternity of the Most Holy Crucifix and served as maestro di cappella of its associated church, San Marcello, until 1667. He died on 7 March 1668. His funeral was held two days later at Santa Maria Maddalena. In his will, he left most of his money and possessions to the confraternity. According to his entry in the Gro√ües S√§ngerlexikon, Ceccarelli had become a priest in 1641. In his 1710 history of the Sistine Chapel Choir, Andrea Adami refers to him as \\"Rev. Odoardo Ceccarelli\\". Compositions and writings Ceccarelli composed several pieces of music, including a lyric drama in Latin for four sopranos and chorus, an idyll in Italian for five voices, and a cantata for soprano and bass, Ecco il re del cielo immenso. However, the only extant score is Ecco il re del cielo immenso, which is held in the Biblioteca Casanatense. In 1634, at the request of Pope Urban VIII, he began work with Sante Naldini, Stefano Landi, and Gregorio Allegri to adapt the vocal music of older breviaries and to improve and annotate the texts of Palestrina's vocal music. The result of their work, Hymni Sacri in Breviario Romano, was published in 1644. Described by Adami, Liberati, and F√©tis as an erudite man of letters and an excellent writer of poetic texts for music in both Latin and Italian, Ceccarelli also authored two prose works on images of the Virgin Mary in Rome, both published in 1647. La miracolosa imagine della Madonna delle Gratie depinta da S. Luca describes an image of Mary in Santa Maria della Consolazione purportedly painted by Saint Luke and the miracles associated with it. Breve racconto della manifestatione della devotissima imagine della santissima Vergine describes the restoration of a fresco depicting Mary in the portico of Sant'Apollinare which survived the Sack of Rome in 1527 because the priests had it plastered over to hide it from the invaders.

Biography  Alexander Murylev was born in 1971 in the family of an officer of the Soviet Army. Before coming of age, he lived with his family in East Germany, where his father held a high position in the counterintelligence headquarters of the Group of Soviet Forces.Documentary film from the series \\"Criminal Russia\\" - 'The Case of Murylev: Death for an apartment' Returning to the USSR, Murylev enrolled into a medical school. After graduating from it, he went to the army, where he served as a feldsher in a military hospital. After demobilization, Murylev tried to enroll in the MSU Faculty of Journalism, but was unsuccessful. After that, he got a job as a freelance correspondent in a number of Moscow print media. One time he was given a task by the editorial which led him one of the metropolitan casinos, where the young man got addicted to gambling. He began to spend all his free time in gambling houses, and once he lost a very large sum of money. Due to this, he began to commit crimes.  Murders  Murylev was well versed in the issues of privatization and housing sales, to which his journalistic work contributed a lot. So, in one of the newspapers, shortly before this, an article published by Murylev titled \\"Small privatization - a great swimming\\" was followed up by \\"And what about the big one?\\", which raised the issue of privatization of real estate in Moscow. Murylev knew that he law was passed in hurry, and for the sale of someone's apartment only one document was enough - a power of attorney could dispose of it. Murylev carefully investigated the places where marginal personalities gathered, in particular, single alcoholics. He treated his victims to alcohol, and, having made sure they had no close relatives, he offered to sell or exchange with the surcharge of their apartment. Having heard the sums, huge for them, they agreed and made out powers of attorney on Murylev. After that, Murylev killed them, always using different methods. He always checked the pulse of his victims, until he was convinced that they were dead. He committed his first murder in July 1993, when he shot a man named Zheleztsov with a harpoon. Murylev then disposed of the body in the Moskva River, where it was later found on July 30. The body could not be identified and was cremated, but a year later, Zheleztsov's brother identified the corpse from his wristwatch, which was preserved by the authorities. In the same month, Murylev committed two more murders - those of a man named Troshin and his mistress Vinokurova. The double murder was committed at Troshin's apartment, with Murylev wrapping up the bodies in a blanket, calling a taxi, going to another area and subsequently disposing of the corpses by throwing them down a manhole. The bodies were discovered a year later, only thanks to Murylev's testimonies. The following murder, that of a man named Sidorov, was done in Murylev's own apartment, where he killed the man with a cleaver. In September 1993, Murylev tried to persuade a certain Alexander Ershov to issue a power of attorney for him to sell the apartment. Ershov refused, and appealed to the police. A week later, he was killed by Murylev, who took him out of town and shot him with a TT pistol. Soon after, Murylev killed a mother and daughter named Petukhovi, who suffered from alcoholism. Their bodies were thrown into the manhole, where they were soon discovered. The next day, Murylev brought to the same place a man named Bulanenkov, who was in a state of intoxication, putting him on the edge of the manhole and waited until the man fell down and drowned. In the spring of 1994, Murylev began to actively engage in apartment sales, for which he used the services of official real estate companies. During the inspection of one of these apartments, an agent of one company was arrested, who mentioned Murylev. Two days later, Murylev was detained at the Belorussky railway station in Moscow.  Trial and sentence  Murylev soon confessed to the murders of 8 people, describing in detail his crimes to the investigators. At one of the interrogations, he told the investigator that he was \\"Yeltsin's Sanitary\\", helping clear Russia from marginal elements. Some of the bodies were found only after the killer testified.

The dramatic rise and fall of the Philippine economy during this period saw the economy peak at nearly 9% in 1973 and 1976, then nosediving to a two-year recession in 1984 and 1985, which saw the country's economy contracting by 7.3%. The 21-year period of Philippine economic history during Ferdinand Marcos‚Äô regime ‚Äì from his election in 1965 until he was ousted by the People Power Revolution in 1986 ‚Äì was a period of significant economic highs and lows.http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/money/content/172779/martial-law-costly- lessons-in-economic-development/story/ The early part of Ferdinand Marcos' administration continued the rising growth rate which characterized the previous administrations of the Third Philippine Republic, peaking at nearly 9 percent in 1973 and 1976. However, Marcos' later years in power saw the worst recession in Philippine history, with the economy contracting by 7.3% in 1984 and 1985. The dramatic rise and fall of the Philippine economy during this period is attributed to the Marcos administration's heavy dependence on foreign loans, its policy of establishing monopolies under Marcos cronies which resulted in significant income inequality, corruption by government officials, and the capital flight which has historically been attributed to the Marcos family's economic plunder.  Background: Economy of the Philippines before 1965  Ferdinand Marcos with Fernando Lopez, whom he would later tap as vice president during his first presidential campaign. Before Marcos first became President in 1965, the Philippines was already the second largest economy in Asia, behind only Japan at a time when the entirety of Asia was still recovering from the ravages of World War II. The country's GDP was higher than that of South Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, and Singapore from 1950-1960. During the 1960's up to the declaration of Martial Law, the Philippine economy was primarily agricultural with 60% of the labor force working in 1957 and 1964. Following an economic strategy of import substitution industrialization, the Philippine economy before Marcos was characterized by growing industrial production in sectors including textiles, clothing, metalworks, machinery and petroleum products. New, high-yielding crop varieties new irrigation and mechanization techniques brought growth to the Agriculture sector. International collaboration for new agricultural technologies was pursued, most notably with the International Rice Research Institute was founded in 1960 under the administration of Carlos P. Garcia. However, many sectors of the Philippine economy were controlled by the traditional elite, who had become powerful during the Spanish and American occupations of the Philippines and had since become major players in Philippine politics. Within this sociopolitical climate, Ferdinand Marcos, the scion of a political clan from Northern Luzon, was able to deftly portray himself as an outsider, using his finely honed oratorical skills to promise what one historian would describe as \\"dazzling visions of rapid growth, impending development, and the alleviation of poverty.\\" By picking Fernando Lopez as his running mate, gaining early support from the Iglesia ni Cristo voting bloc, and drawing on the propaganda value of his beauty queen wife Imelda, who charmed the rich vote rich provinces of her native Visayas, Marcos won the 1965 Philippine presidential election against incumbent Diosdado Macapagal and independent challenger Raul Manglapus.  Economic strategies during Marcos' first term (1965‚Äì1969)  Marcos had built his campaign on the promise that his administration would change the face of the Philippine economy and government. Marcos had inherited an economy which was growing at a steady pace, but he managed to give the impression of even quicker results by drawing on foreign loans to fund projects. He also attracted a new breed of economic managers to work under his administration. These highly educated soon became known as Marcos‚Äô \\"technocrats.\\" With these technocrats in the public sector, Marcos sought to also reshape the private sector by taking advantage of the then-highly regulated economy to favor a select group of businessmen and industrialists who were loyal to him. This marked the beginning of what would later be called \\"crony capitalism,\\" and would later be regarded as the replacement of one set of elites with another. But the short-term gains of his loan-fueled policies kept Marcos popular with the public throughout most of his first term. This popularity lasted until the very end of his campaign for reelection, where excessive campaign spending led to a balance of payments crisis as the country ushered in the 1970s.  Buildup of economic control  Upon assuming the presidency in 1965, Marcos immediately embarked on a set of political maneuvers designed to undermine the economic power and political influence of the Philippines‚Äô traditional elite, and replace them with individuals loyal to him. With strategic appointments and the systematic use of what would later be called \\"behest loans\\" he elevated the influence of a select group of industrialists and entrepreneurs such as Roberto Benedicto who was put in charge of the then-government-owned Philippine National Bank, and Rodolfo Cuenca, whose Cuenca Construction Company was expanded into what became the Construction and Development Corporation of the Philippines in 1966. These were the first among the group that would later be referred to as Marcos‚Äô \\"cronies.\\" In an effort to undermine the power of local feudal lords, Marcos appointed young technocrat Ernesto Maceda to the newly created Presidential Arm on Community Development, which would conduct development projects directly in Philippine barrios, instead of going through local politicians. Some of Marcos‚Äô most prominent early appointments earned him praise however, for bringing in a \\"new breed\\" of economic managers. Marcos‚Äô campaign promises proved very attractive to a new generation of \\"technocrats\\" - highly trained specialists and economic managers. Among these \\"technocrats\\" were Vicente Paterno, Rafael Salas, Alejandro Melchor, Onofre D. Corpuz, Cesar Virata, and Gerardo Sicat, who became the intellectual core of Marcos‚Äô cabinet.  Omnibus Tax Law of 1969  One major economic achievement of the first Marcos administration arose from placing tax reform in its legislative agenda. Because landlords dominated the legislature, no new tax initiatives since midway into the term of Carlos P. Garcia, in 1959. The Macapagal administration had gone by with no new tax laws passed at all. As a result, by the end of the 1960s, 70 to 75% of the country‚Äôs tax revenues were being derived only from indirect taxes. This success came towards the end of Marcos‚Äô first term, however, and even then, the new revenues it brought in were insufficient for Marcos‚Äô government spending plans, which were central to his campaign for reelection. As a result, the Marcos administration relied heavily on foreign assistance throughout his first term, with the number of projects ramping up as he neared the end of his first term in 1969.  Deficit spending and foreign loans in Marcos‚Äô first presidential term  Wooden sculpture titled \\"utang na labas\\", depicting foreign debt of the Marcos era, displayed at the lobby of the Bantayog ng mga Bayani during a routine cleaning on 15 November 2018. In a bid to become the first Philippine president to be elected to a second term, Marcos initiated a program of rapid modernization to back up his 1969 campaign theme, \\"performance.\\" The government‚Äôs spending deficit in the first Marcos administration from 1965 to 1969 was 70% higher than that of the Macapagal administration from 1961 to 1965. In order to do this, Marcos relied heavily on foreign loans, and economists would later point to the period of fiscal policy from 1966 to 1970 as the root of problems that would bring about problems of the Philippine economy in the late 1970s, the 1980s, and beyond. Marcos had quantified his promise of \\"performance\\" as \\"Rice ,Roads, and Schoolbuildings,\\" and he used loans to fulfill those promises. Loans mostly funded the construction of 1,201 km new asphalt roads where the more fiscally conservative Macapagal administration had only managed to build 70; 2,124 km of gravel roads were built where the Macapagal government had managed only 118; and 15,831 lineal meters of bridges where Macapagal had only built 651. This loan-driven spending also allowed Marcos to construct 38, 705 permanent schoolbuildings and 58,745 prefabricated schoolbuildings in his first three years, while the Macapagal administration had only managed to build 400 classrooms in its four years. Marcos had the fortune of benefitting from his predecessors‚Äô investments in the area of rice production. The International Rice Research Institute had been conceived in Garcia‚Äôs term, and during Macapagal‚Äôs term, work on the development of a new rice variety, IR8, began. This higher yield variety was introduced during Marcos‚Äô term as \\"Miracle Rice\\" and produced a boom rice production so large that the Philippines was able to export US$5.9 Million worth of rice in 1968.  Edifice complex  Marcos‚Äô first term also saw the practice of using publicly funded construction projects as political and election propaganda. Usually attributed to First Lady Imelda Marcos, these grandiosely designed projects were eventually called part of her \\"Edifice complex\\".  The 1969 reelection campaign and the balance of payments crisis of 1970  Imelda, during a visit of US President Richard Nixon and his wife Pat in 1969, before the end of Marcos' first term. The Philippine economy under Ferdinand Marcos faced its first major economic crisis because of a ramp-up on loan-funded government spending leading up to Ferdinand Marcos‚Äô 1969 reelection campaign. Leaning even more on foreign aid funds to assure his re-election to a second term, Marcos launched US$50 million worth in infrastructure projects in 1969 to create to create an impression of progress for the electorate. This campaign spending spree was so massive that it caused a balance of payments crisis, so the government was compelled to seek a debt rescheduling plan with the International Monetary Fund. The IMF mandated stabilization plan which accompanied the agreement included numerous macroeconomic interventions, including a shift away from the Philippines‚Äô historical economic strategy of import substitution industrialization and towards export-oriented industrialization; and the allowing the Philippine Peso to float and devalue. The inflationary effect these interventions had on the local economy brought about the social unrest which was the rationalization for the proclamation of martial law in 1972.  Economic strategies during Marcos' second term (1969‚Äì1972)  The second term of the presidency of Ferdinand Marcos began in 1969. The social impact of the 1969‚Äì1970 balance of payments crisis quickly led to social unrest ‚Äì so much so that Marcos went from winning the elections by a landslide in November 1969 to dodging effigies by protesters just two months later, in January 1970. Despite the crisis, the administration continued its strategy of using foreign loans to funded industrialization projects, encouraged by low interest rates in international capital markets. Philippine external debt was at $4.1 billion in 1975, but doubled to $8.2 billion in only two years.  Social unrest  The social impact of the 1969‚Äì1970 balance of payments crisis was rapid, as was its effect on Marcos‚Äô popularity. The election was held on 11 November 1969 and Marcos won handily over his opponent Serging Osme√±a. Marcos was inaugurated to his second presidential term on 30 December 1969, and by the time he gave his Fifth State of the Nation Address (the first of his second term) on 26 January 1970, he was already beset by multi-sectoral protests which included the \\"radicals\\" of the left and the \\"moderates\\" being civil libertarians and some segments of the religious sector. Marcos increasingly blamed this social unrest to the machinations of the still-new Communist Party of the Philippines, which had just been born the year before, splitting from the dying Partido Komunisa ng Pilipinas., and its armed wing, the New People‚Äôs Army (CPP-NPA). Neither the Philippine National Security Council nor the Philippine National Security Council which shaped US involvement in Philippine security affairs at the time considered the CPP-NPA a major threat, but Marcos continued to use it as a bogeyman, harkening Filipinos to images of the bloody Huk encounters of the 1950s, and courting the Johnson administration's political support in light of the U.S.' recent entry into the Vietnam war. Marcos‚Äô mythicization of the CPP led to its rapid growth in the early 1970s, and Marcos went even further by using the CPP as part of his rationalization for martial law in 1972.  Petrodollar-loan fueled spending Although the Philippines was facing an economic crisis of the early 1970s, the Marcos administration continued its strategy of building loan-funded infrastructure and industrial projects because the international capital markets were then flooded with \\"petrodollars\\". Oil producing countries had been making so much profit that they were eager to put their money in countries they considered \\"investment havens\\". Philippine external debt was at $4.1 billion in 1975, but doubled to $8.2 billion in only two years. Loans with low interest rates fueled by these petrodollars funded the 11 major industrial projects Marcos announced in his 1970 State of the Nation Address, as well as roads, bridges, dams, irrigation systems, communications infrastructure, power plants, and electrical transmission facilities. By 1982, the Philippines‚Äô debt had ballooned to $24.4 billion.  Buildup to martial law The political and economic unrest of the early 1970s continued throughout the three and a half years of Marcos‚Äô second term, just as rumors proliferated that he would try to remain in power beyond the two terms allowed him by the 1935 Constitution of the Philippines. Factory workers and transport groups protested against low wages and unfair labor practices. Students, disenchanted with Marcos, joined the labor workers in the streets. Marcos‚Äô move to create a new Philippine Constitution by pushing for the creation of the 1971 Philippine Constitutional Convention lent credence to the belief that Marcos wanted to stay in power, especially when delegate Eduardo Quintero implicated Imelda Marcos in a payoff scheme for delegates who voted against the \\"Block Marcos\\" amendments which would disallow Marcos from running again. When a political rally of the Liberal Party at Plaza Miranda to announce its slate for the Philippine Senate election of 1971 was bombed with grenades, Marcos accused the Communist Party of the Philippines and temporarily suspended the Writ of Habeas Corpus in a supposed bid to apprehend the assailants. Although the actual instigator of the bombing remains the subject of historical debate, it prompted a series of large protests by Civil Libertarians, led by Senator Jose Diokno, which would last until martial law was proclaimed in 1972. The Plaza Miranda bombing would soon be followed by 20 more in the 1972 Manila bombings, which caused significant property damage but only forty casualties in one instance. Only one assailant was arrested for these bombings ‚Äì a bomb expert previously connected with the Philippine Constabulary. Marcos continued to blame communist guerillas for the attacks, and they became part of the justification for the declaration of martial law in September 1972.  The Philippine economy under martial law (1972‚Äì1981)  \\"FM Declares Martial Law\\"‚Äîthe headline of 24 September 1972 Sunday issue of the Philippines Daily Express - the only newspaper allowed to circulate in the first few days after the declaration of Martial Law. Marcos declared martial law in September 1972, and because he packaged it as a way of introducing stability in light of the social unrest that had been going on since the 1970 balance of payments crisis, the business community mostly supported the move at first. The economy continued to grow because of an international boom in the demand for key Philippine export commodities, especially sugar and coconut. This international commodities boom led to record GNP growth in the country 1974 and 1976, despite the economic headaches brought about by the 1973 Oil Crisis. By the late 1970s, however, the international commodities boom began to slow down, and the petro-dollar glut which had fueled low interest rates led international financing institutions began tightening credit, forcing the government to resort to short term loans with higher interest rates just to service its debts and to import goods. The Philippines‚Äô debt went up to more than 200 percent of exports in the period from 1978 to 1991, so more than half the value of the country‚Äôs exports went to debt servicing, rather than imports. Marcos‚Äô debt fueled spending, which had grown significantly during the first few years after the declaration of martial law, had funded projects which did not produce economic returns. Some of these projects were simply not yet needed at the time, while some were showcase projects which did not address the more urgent need for basic primary services. But the failure of most of the martial law era projects has been attributed to the incompetence and/or corruption of the Marcos cronies that had been put in monopolistic control over them. Corruption contributed to significant capital flight, and even Marcos‚Äô immediate family were accused of participating in the plunder of the Philippine economy, with some estimates placing their \\"unexplained wealth\\" at US$10 Billion. The country was hit hard by the second global oil crisis of the decade, in 1979. And when the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates in the early 1980s, the Philippines‚Äô debt ballooned rapidly, pushing the Philippine economy towards an economic nosedive by 1983.  Achieving control of the economy  At 7:15 PM on 23 September 1972, Marcos went on air to announce that he had proclaimed martial law throughout the Philippines. The Military had begun rounding up journalists, political leaders, key opposition figures, and even some delegates to the constitutional convention ‚Äì anyone who could pose a challenge to Marcos' control of the government and the economy. Then Defense Secretary and later became Minister Juan Ponce Enrile, who was in charge of the arrests, later recounted that they had to \\"emasculate the leaders\\" to achieve total control of the country. Although he originally justified it on the basis of supposed threats to the national government, Marcos soon framed the declaration of Martial Law in 1972 as an effort to create a \\"New Society\\", promising economic growth and making it more acceptable to the business and international community while allowing Marcos even more control over the Philippine economy. As Dohner and Intal explain in their 1989 book on the economic history of Southeast Asia: Martial law allowed Marcos to immediately take control of privately controlled public utilities such as MERALCO, PLDT, and the three then-existing Philippine airline services, and media entities, including 7 Television Stations, 16 National Daily Newspapers, 11 Weekly Magazines, 66 Community Newspapers, and 292 radio stations.  Expansion of crony capitalism Because martial law gave Marcos extraordinary legislative as well as executive powers, he was eventually able to expand the influence of his cronies, who quickly establish monopolies within the Philippine economy, in a strategy for economic control which would eventually come to be called \\"crony capitalism\\". Using presidential decrees and letters of instruction, he enabled Juan Ponce Enrile to control the logging industry, Danding Cojuangco to control the Coconut farming industry, Roberto Benedicto to dominate the sugar industry, Antonio Floirendo to control the Banana farming industry, and so on.  Global commodities boom and debt-driven GDP growth  The Philippines' exports income had begun growing in the early 1970s due to an increased global demand for raw materials, including coconut and sugar, and the increase in global market prices for these commodities coincided with the declaration of martial law, allowing GDP growth to peak at nearly 9 percent in the years immediately after the declaration ‚Äì in 1973 and 1976. This \\"commodities boom\\" continued throughout most of the 1970s, only slowing down towards the early 1980s when it left the Philippine economy vulnerable to the instability of the international capital market. Manufactured exports became a significant growth area, growing at twice the rate of the agricultural exports which had been the Philippines‚Äô traditional export products. The Marcos administration continued its strategy of relying on international loans to fund the projects that would support the booming economy, prompting later economists to label this a period of \\"debt driven\\" growth.  Export-oriented industrialization and labor policy  The austerity package required by IMF in the government‚Äôs deal to solve the 1969‚Äì1970 balance of payments crisis was supposed to be implemented during Marcos‚Äô second term, but the shift from the Philippines‚Äô historical policy of import substitution industrialization and towards export-oriented industrialization began being implemented in earnest in the months immediately prior and after martial law. The first signs of a major shift came with the creation of an export processing zones in Mariveles, Bataan and later, similar zones in Mactan, Baguio and Cavite. Marcos cracked down on labor protests, with the implementation of a \\"no-union, no-strike\\" policy.  1973 oil crisis  The Philippine economy took a big hit during the 1973 oil crisis, but the commodities boom kept the economy afloat.  Corruption and downturn (1977‚Äì1981)  By the late 70s, however, the sugar and coconut commodities boom began to slow down, and the weaknesses of the Philippine economy under martial law began to be exposed. This period also saw the end of the petro-dollar glut which had fueled low interest rates, and international financing institutions began tightening credit, forcing the government to resort to short term loans with higher interest rates just to service its debts and to import goods. The Philippines‚Äô debt went up to more than 200 percent of exports in the period from 1978 to 1991, so more than half the value of the country‚Äôs exports went to debt servicing, rather than imports. By contrast, Thailand and Korea, which did not borrow heavily despite the low interest rates of the early 70s, fared better in the long-run.  Crony capitalism, corruption, and capital flight  Many of the projects undertaken by the cronies did not produce economic returns, partly because of corruption, and partly because the cronies had been selected primarily because of their loyalty to Marcos, rather than any kind of proven business acumen. In addition, some of these projects were simply not yet needed at the time, while some were showcase projects which did not address the more urgent need for basic primary services. Marcos used government-owned financial institutions such as the Philippine National Bank to bail out many these crony-owned firms, compounding the country‚Äôs economic difficulties. The late 1970s also saw the rise of capital flight linked to corruption, as funds funneled from government projects were stashed in overseas bank accounts in Switzerland, the US, and the Netherlands Antilles among others. Marcos‚Äô immediate family ‚Äì particularly Imelda, Imee, and Bongbong ‚Äì would later be accused of participating in the plunder of the Philippine economy, with some estimates placing their \\"unexplained wealth\\" at US$10 Billion.  1979 oil crisis  The Philippines was hit hard by the second global oil crisis of the decade, in 1979. The country had weathered the first global oil crisis, in 1973, but by 1979 the commodities boom which had propped up its economy in the early 1970s had died down, leaving the Philippines much more vulnerable \\\\- so much so that in the third quarter of 1981, the Philippine economy followed the course of the US economy when it went into recession.  Economic nosedive and Marcos ouster (1981‚Äì1986)  The Philippine economic nosedive of 1983 traces its roots to debt-driven growth, mostly during Marcos' second term and during the earliest years of martial law. By 1982, the Philippines‚Äô debt was at $24.4 billion, but it had not seen much in terms of returns because of corruption and the poor management of the crony-monopolized sectors of the economy. In the third quarter of 1981, disaster for the Philippines came when the US economy went into recession, forcing the Reagan administration to increase interest rates. \\"Third world\\" countries like the Philippines and many of the nations of Latin America were highly debt dependent, and the size of their debt made debt servicing very difficult. The Philippines‚Äô exports could not keep up with the country‚Äôs debt, and the economy went into decline in 1981. This economic decline and a succession crisis brought about by Marcos' failing health convinced Marcos' political nemesis, Benigno Aquino Jr., to try to come back from exile to try and reason with Marcos to change his policies. But Aquino was gunned down at the airport before he could even touch Philippine soil. The already-declining Philippine economy suffered further as investors went to Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand instead of the Philippines. 1984 and 1985 saw the worst recession in Philippine history, with the economy contracting bt 7.3% for two successive years. With Marcos' health going into steady decline, he gradually lost the support of his cabinet, of the Military, and by some of his closest allies. He was finally ousted by the People Power Revolution that culminated from 22 to 25 February 1986.

History The church was designed by Edward Monson, Jr. in a neo-Gothic style, and is built of red brick with stone dressings; it has a steeply-pitched slate roof. The foundation stone was laid on 18 October 1887 and the church was opened in 1888. It is now the main landmark of the Acton Green Conservation Area. It is described by Nikolaus Pevsner as a \\"large raw red basilica on the edge of the green\\", though the conservation area character appraisal by Ealing Council notes \\"its imposing architecture\\", and that \\"The view of the church from the Green is unfortunately obscured by the temporary church hall and club buildings (the latter in green painted corrugated iron).\\" The nearby vicarage uses the same red brick and stone window surrounds and mullions. Dedication stone to Saint Alban the martyr, laid by E. Montague Nelson, J.P., on 18 October 1887. It records that Rev. George Henley Manbey was the vicar-designate, that Edward Monson, Jr. was the architect, and that Joseph Dorey was the builder. Three of the stained glass windows are by F. Hamilton Jackson, including Jesus and the Doctors, dedicated by Blanche Rose Harper in 1888. The green corrugated iron building to the south of the church seems to be a \\"tin tabernacle\\", placed there for use in mission services run by All Saints, South Acton until 1938. It is now used by \\"The Caterpillar\\" Montessori nursery school. On 15 January 1909, The Chiswick Times reported that Miss Gladys Cowper of Fairlawn Court, Acton Green, and Captain Guy Maxwell Shipway, son of Colonel Shipway of Grove House, Chiswick, were married in the church. The theologian and author W. O. E. Oesterley was vicar in the 1920s. The congregation declined and in 2007 the church was closed. In 2011, developers applied for permission to convert the church into 10 flats and a detached house. The application was opposed, and in 2013 a public inquiry was held. The planning inspector rejected the application on the grounds that a local community facility for which there was a continued demand would be lost. The church returned to active use in 2014 as part of the Christ Church W4 alongside Christ Church, Turnham Green, after standing empty for seven years. The building was restored with solar panels on the roof, a new heating system, nest boxes for swifts, and new kitchen and toilets. On 4 October 2016 the Bishop of London, Richard Chartres, rededicated the renovated church.

Before being elected to the office, Halim had spent two years as a legislator and ten years as the mayor of Tangerang. Halim was born in Tangerang and completed his higher education in the University of Indonesia. His career started out as a local bureaucrat, before eventually becoming Tangerang's city secretary prior to his election as mayor in 2003. Background Wahidin Halim was born in Pinang, Tangerang, then part of West Java province, on 14 August 1954. The third child of nine, his father was an elementary school teacher. After completing his high school in Tangerang, he earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Indonesia on 1978. He later gained a masters from Satyagama University and a doctorate from Padjadjaran University. He is married to Niniek Nur'aini and has three children. Career Early in his career, while he was still in his 20s, he was elected as a village chief. Around 1980, following a local government reform, village chiefs officially became state employees and Wahidin entered bureaucracy, becoming the \\"lurah\\" (administrative village chief) of his home village. He became head of the city's taxation office by 1988, and head of the development office in 1991, before moving to the Tangerang Regency government where he worked for five years as subdistrict head and department chief. He returned to Tangerang as city secretary in 2003. Mayor of Tangerang In 2003, Halim was voted as the mayor of Tangerang by the city council, winning over two other candidates by a significant margin. In 2005, during his first term, the city's government released a law prohibiting prostitution. He was approached by the Prosperous Justice Party to run as governor of Banten in the 2007 gubernatorial election, but eventually declined. He ran for reelection in 2008, during Tangerang's first direct mayoral election. Running with Arief Rachadiono Wismansyah in the three-candidate race, Halim won over 80 percent of the votes to secure a second term for himself. During his tenure as mayor, he established a \\"green village\\" program, planting trees in order to mitigate pollution generated by factories. He also criticized then-governor Ratu Atut Chosiyah, saying that the provincial government did not understand the issues encountered by people living close to Jakarta. Halim ran as a gubernatorial candidate in 2011, towards the expiry of his second term, but lost to Ratu Atut. In 2013, Halim was removed from his post as the head of Demokrat in Banten, which he held since October 2011, as he opposed the party's candidate for the Mayor of Tangerang succeeding him. Instead, Halim supported his younger brother and Golkar nominee Abdul Syukur, although Demokrat's candidate Arief Rachadiono Wismansyah eventually won. An academician from Syarif Hidayatullah State Islamic University Jakarta remarked that under Halim's tenure, various metrics such as investments, local government revenues and spending and the human development index all improved, but the poverty rate increased. Legislator Following the expiry of his second term, Halim ran under Demokrat as a legislative candidate in the 2014 election to the People's Representative Council, representing Tangerang. He was successful and gained the most votes in the electoral district, with 84,025 votes - exceeding the total votes for the rest of his party. Governor of Banten In 2017. Halim ran in Banten's gubernatorial election against incumbent Rano Karno, resigning from his DPR post to do so. Running with Andika Hazrumy, the pair won with 50.95 percent of the votes. A lawsuit to the Constitutional Court was overthrown, and the pair was sworn in on 12 May 2017. Rumors circulated in 2018 that Halim was to join Joko Widodo's campaign team for the 2019 presidential election, and was included in its advisers list, but Demokrat (which endorsed Prabowo Subianto) denied his inclusion.
