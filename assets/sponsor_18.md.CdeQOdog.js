Formally established as a school at the University of Pennsylvania in 1914, Penn GSE has historically had research strengths in teaching and learning, the cultural contexts of education, language education, quantitative research methods, and practitioner inquiry. Pam Grossman is the current dean of Penn GSE; she succeeded Andrew C. Porter in 2015. History From its earliest days, the University of Pennsylvania has prepared teachers to lead the schools of the country. This was a primary purpose of Benjamin Franklin's Public Academy of Philadelphia, and it has continued to influence the work of the University throughout its history. Education classes were first held at Penn in 1893, and a professorship in education was created two years later in 1895. The full-fledged school of education was established as a separate school within the university in 1914, initially conferring only Bachelor of Science in Education degrees. The school of education conferred its first Bachelor of Science in Education degrees in 1915 on three men and three women. The school quickly embraced the necessity of research on education practices, and instituted Master of Science in Education and Doctor of Education degree programs in 1930 and 1943, respectively. Since then, Penn GSE has grown to include Master of Philosophy in Education, Doctor of Education, and Doctor of Philosophy in Education programs and house several departments, centers, and initiatives. Facilities When the school was founded, its offices and classrooms were located in College Hall, one of the first buildings of Penn's West Philadelphia campus. Its library was located in Fisher-Bennett Hall but was soon merged into Van Pelt Library. In 1940, GSE moved to Eisenlohr Hall, located a few blocks west on Walnut Street. Penn acquired additional space in the rowhouse next door, which was known as the Eisenlohr Annex Building. Penn GSE moved into the Education Building, where it still is today, in 1966. Currently, Eisenlohr Hall serves as the President's house and the Eisenlohr Annex is home to Penn's creative writing center. Academics Penn GSE offers 20 different master's degrees in programs ranging from Higher Education to Counseling and Mental Health Services. It also offers 15 doctorate degrees, in both education and philosophy. Research Penn GSE offers a wide variety of degree programs in education research and practice. Students prepare to become educational leaders, aspiring to have careers in urban and international education, school leadership, education research, higher education administration, school psychology, and more. There are currently six academic divisions at Penn GSE: Human Development and Quantitative Methods; Literacy, Culture, and International Education; Education Policy; Educational Linguistics; Higher Education; and Teaching, Learning, and Leadership. Urban education is one of Penn GSE's central research interests. GSE partners with several schools in its West Philadelphia neighborhood, including the Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander Penn Partnership School and others. They also engage in professional development for local educators as well as in applied research, developing programs like KIDS and EPIC. In 2001, Penn GSE launched a series of executive degree programs for education professionals and entrepreneurial activities that serve non-traditional students. These programs have grown to include the Executive Program in Education Entrepreneurship; Executive Program in School and Mental Health Counseling; Executive Doctorate in Higher Education Management; School Leadership Program (Principal Certification); Penn Chief Learning Officer Program; Medical Education Program; Mid-Career Doctoral Program in Educational Leadership and Urban Residency Teaching Program. In 2010, Penn GSE launched the Milken-Penn GSE Education Business Plan Competition, a competition that encourages entrepreneurship and innovation in education. Penn GSE also works internationally, engaging in multinational research projects, partnerships, study abroad programs, and consulting projects.

In appearance very similar to the Minolta XE using the same electronics, the camera incorporated a Leica developed shutter and modifications to the metering system offering Leica's traditional facility of selective metering in addition to integrated (centre weighted) metering. It was the first Leica SLR camera to offer automatic exposure.

This experiment was implemented during 1981-82 by Lawrence W. Sherman, Director of Research at the Police Foundation, and by the Minneapolis Police Department with funding support from the National Institute of Justice. Among a pool of domestic violence offenders for whom there was probable cause to make an arrest, the study design called for officers to randomly select one third of the offenders for arrest, one third would be counseled and one third would be separated from their domestic partner. The results of the study, showing a deterrent effect for arrest, had a \\"virtually unprecedented impact in changing then-current police practices.\\" Subsequently, numerous states and law enforcement agencies enacted policies for mandatory arrest, without warrant, for domestic violence cases in which the responding police officer had probable cause that a crime had occurred. Background Domestic violence historically has been viewed as a private family matter that need not involve government or criminal justice intervention. Before the early 1970s, police in the United States favored a \\"hands-off\\" approach to domestic violence calls, with arrest only used as a last resort. At the time, domestic violence cases were typically classified as misdemeanor assault cases. During the 1970s, many U.S. jurisdictions did not authorize the police to make arrests in any misdemeanor assault, whether it involved a domestic partner or not, unless the assault occurred in the officer's presence. A 1978 court order in New York City mandated that arrests only be made in cases of serious violence, thus officers instead made effort to mediate family disputes. In the early 1970s, clinical psychologists argued that police should make an effort to mediate disputes. Statistics on incidence of domestic violence, published in the late 1970s, helped raise public awareness of the problem and increase activism. A study published in 1976 by the Police Foundation found that the police had intervened at least once in the previous two years in 85 percent of spouse homicides. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, feminists and battered women's advocacy groups were calling on police to take domestic violence more seriously and change intervention strategies. In some instances, these groups took legal action against police departments, including in Oakland, California and New York City, to get them to make arrests in domestic violence cases. They claimed that police assigned low priority to domestic disturbance calls.Straus (1980), and references below, \\"Criticism of police response\\" In 1978, the National Academy of Sciences published a report, Deterrence and Incapacitation: Estimating the Effects of Criminal Sanctions on Crime Rates, which called for more rigorous assessments of policies and practices based on social control theories and use of deterrence for crime control. Based on the Academy's recommendations, the National Institute of Justice began funding studies of the deterrent effects of criminal sanctions and, in 1980, one of the sponsored studies was the Minneapolis Domestic Violence Experiment. The study Methodology The Minneapolis Domestic Violence Experiment looked at effectiveness of methods used by police to reduce domestic violence. Cases used in the study were misdemeanor assault calls, which make up the bulk of domestic violence calls for service. Both the victim and offender needed to still be present when the police arrived, in order to be included in the study. 51 patrol officers in the Minneapolis Police Department participated in the study. Each was asked to use one of three approaches for handling domestic violence calls, in cases where officers had probable cause to believe an assault had occurred: # Send the abuser away for eight hours. # Advice and mediation of disputes. # Make an arrest. Interviews were conducted during a 6-month follow-up period, with both victims and offenders, as well as official records consulted to determine whether or not re-offending had occurred. The study lasted approximately 17 months and included 330 cases. Findings Arrest was found to be the most effective police response. The study found that the offenders assigned to be arrested had lower rates of re-offending than offenders assigned to counseling or temporarily sent away. (19% for arrest 37% for advise and 34% for Send) Policy response The results of the study received a great deal of attention from the news media, including The New York Times and prime-time news coverage on television. Many U.S. police departments responded to the study, adopting a mandatory arrest policy for spousal violence cases with probable cause. New York City Police Department Commissioner Benjamin Ward quickly issued a new mandate for officers to make arrests, after reading the results of the study in a Police Foundation report. Ward stated his belief that \\"arresting violent members of a household would be more effective in protecting other family members and help safeguard police officers called in to stop the highly charged quarrels. I thought it was about time to put policemen out of the counseling business and into what they really are best at, which is making arrests, then let the judge decide.\\" With this mandate, Ward also included cohabitants and same-sex couples in the police definition of family. The Houston and Dallas Police Departments were also quick to change their approach to domestic disturbance calls, and make more arrests. Within a year, the number of police departments using arrest as a strategy in domestic violence cases jumped from 10 to 31%, and to 46% by 1986. Numerous other police departments had partially changed their approach to domestic violence cases. In 1984, the U.S. Attorney General's Task Force on Family Violence report drew heavily upon the Minneapolis study, in recommending that domestic violence be handled with a criminal justice approach. Within eight years, 15 states and the District of Columbia enacted new domestic violence laws that required the arrest of violent domestic offenders. By 2005, 23 states and the District of Columbia had enacted mandatory arrest for domestic assault, without warrant, given that the officer has probable cause and regardless of whether or not the officer witnessed the crime. The Minneapolis study also influenced policy in other countries, including New Zealand, which adopted a pro-arrest policy for domestic violence cases. Mandatory arrest policies Mandatory arrest laws were implemented in the U.S. during the 1980s and 1990s due, in great part, to the impact of the Minneapolis Experiment. The Violence Against Women Act of 1994 added to the volume of legislation in the 1990s pertaining to mandatory arrest laws, affecting those states that lacked such laws themselves.Violence Against Women Act of 1994, , \\"The Library of Congress\\", 1994 The laws \\"require the police to make arrests in domestic violence cases when there was probable cause to do so, regardless of the wishes of the victim.\\" Clute, Penelope D., ‚ÄúKnow the Law: Domestic Violence Mandatory Arrest‚Äù Before the laws were put into effect, police officers were required to witness the abuse occurring first hand prior to making an arrest. Currently, 23 states use mandatory arrest policies. National Institute of Justice, ‚ÄúTable 1: States With Mandatory Arrest‚Äù Other states leave the decision to arrest to the discretion of the responding officers. History of mandatory arrest policy in the U.S. Prior to the implementation of mandatory arrest policies in the United States, police often were not able to arrest individuals suspected of domestic violence. In an article from the California Law Review titled \\"Domestic Violence as a Crime Against the State,\\" Machaela Hoctor explained that \\"when officers did respond to a domestic violence call, they usually attempted to mediate the dispute. This \\"mediation\\" consisted of a variety of approaches, including attempts by officers to convince the parties to reconcile immediately at the scene or to use formal alternative dispute resolution programs.\\"Hoctor, Machaela, ‚ÄúDomestic Violence as a Crime Against the State‚Äù, \\"California Law Review\\", May 1997 The debate over mandatory arrest is still underway, as many people believe it has negative effects on the assailant, victim, and their family members including but not limited to the breakdown of the family, the economic deprivation of the victim, the trauma associated with separation of families, and the lack of childcare in situations of dual arrest. Sometimes when police respond, they arrest both parties involved in a domestic violence situation. As described by Margaret Martin in the Journal of Family Violence, \\"The practice of dual arrest, the arrest of two parties, usually a man and a woman engaged in a 'domestic dispute,' has arisen in localities which employ presumptive and mandatory arrest\\". Police are more likely to arrest both parties if the primary aggressor is female National Institute of Justice, ‚ÄúDomestic Violence Cases: What Research Shows about Arrest and Dual Arrest Rates‚Äù, \\"Office of Justice Programs\\" However, not every domestic violence situation results in dual arrest. Police Officers are trained to deduce who the primary aggressor is in a domestic violence dispute, leading to the arrest of the assailant and not the victim. Circumstances for arrest Some states will arrest simply based on probable cause to believe an act of domestic violence has been committed, while others do not allow for an arrest after a specific amount of time following the incident. For example, in Alaska the police cannot make an arrest if the abuse occurred more than 12 hours prior to notification Police are specifically trained to assess the situation and decide whether they have the required probable cause to make an arrest. For instance, Wisconsin has a list of requirements that must be met before an officer can arrest a suspect. These include the age of the suspect(s), their relationship to the victim(s), and whether the act could be considered an intentional assault. The officer must also be able to identify the \\"predominant aggressor\\" Wisconsin Coalition Against Domestic Violence, ‚ÄúMandatory Arrest Checklist‚Äù, Published 1989, Updated 2008, Sec. 968.075, Wis. Stats Modern arrests Research has consistently reported an increase in the use of arrest for domestic violence in the United States. One large (but not necessarily representative) study of over 650,000 incidents drawn from 2,819 jurisdictions in 19 states during the year 2000 found that in the 197,064 incidents when victims and offenders were intimate partners, police made one or more arrests in 48.0 percent of incidents, and dual arrests in 1.9 percent of incidents National Institute of Justice, 1: Arrests by Victim- Offender Relationship: Intimate Partners‚Äù, \\"Office of Justice Programs\\" In regards to same-sex relationships, the arrest rates for domestic violence were the same as those for heterosexual couples. For all intimate partner relationships, offenders were more likely to be arrested if the incident of violence was a serious aggravated assault. The NIJ also reported that \\"arrest occurred more frequently in cases involving intimate partners if the offender was white\\" and \\"cases involving intimate partners and acquaintances were more likely to result in arrest if the offender was 21 or older\\". The increased use of arrest has led to concerns about increases in arrests of women or arrests of two or more persons (dual arrests) in the same incident. Criticism The Minneapolis study was criticized for its methods and its conclusions. The follow-up period of six months may have been too short to capture the episodic and cyclical patterns that can occur with domestic violence. Also, Minneapolis may have been unusual, in that they kept arrestees overnight in jail, whereas in other jurisdictions arrestees might be sent home much quicker. While the Minneapolis design had many methodological strengths, randomized experiments look at the average causal effects for the group as a whole. Conclusions may be made that apply to most individuals in the group, but not all individuals, with some possibly experiencing negative effects of the intervention. In some cases, arrest may provoke the abuser and increase the possibility of more retributive violence. The Minneapolis Experiment was based on deterrence theory, which includes the assumption that the offender is making rational decisions. In the case of domestic violence (and many other offenses), offenders often show little rational behavior. In addition, the Minneapolis Experiment did not measure whether being arrested increased the offenders' fear of future sanctions, a crucial element in deterrence theory. Replication Beginning in 1986, the National Institute of Justice sponsored six replications of the Minneapolis Domestic Violence Experiment. While each site was an independent study, NIJ required that each study had to 1) use an experimental design (i.e., random assignment), 2) address domestic violence incidents that come to the attention of the police, 3) use arrest as one of the treatments, and 4) measure repeat offending using official police records and interviews with victims. The study sites included police departments in Omaha, Nebraska, Charlotte, North Carolina, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Miami-Dade County, Florida, and Colorado Springs, Colorado. Pdf. In Metro-Dade, 907 cases were used, compared to 1,200 cases in Milwaukee and over 1,600 cases in Colorado Springs. A study initiated in Atlanta was never completed. Although these five studies have been described as replications of the Minneapolis experiment, they each varied considerably from that study and from each other in methods and measures. Pdf. The initial findings from the five completed replications were reported independently beginning in 1990.(5 articles) * Pdf.   The original authors' findings about the crime control effects of arrest varied depending upon the site studied, the measures of repeat offending used, and which alternative treatments were compared to arrest. Each replication reported multiple findings with some results favoring arrest, some showing no differences and some showing that arrest was associated with more repeat offending. None of the replications reported effects as strong as those reported for the Minneapolis Experiment. Two articles synthesizing the findings from these studies report a crime control effect for the use of arrest for domestic violence. First, a meta-analysis of the published findings based on official police records from the Minneapolis and the SARP experiments reported a deterrent effect for arrest. Second, a re-analysis that applied consistent measures and methods to the archived data from the five replications reported that arrest was associated with as much as a 25% reduction in repeat offending and that those results were consistent across all five sites.

Plants grow 20 to 30 cm tall, growing from a horizontally orientated rhizome, flowering mid spring to early summer. The flowers have white sepals that are 12‚Äì20 mm long. This species much resembles Anemonoides quinquefolia, of which it was formerly considered a subspecies, except that it is larger growing. After flowering fruits called achenes are formed in a small cluster, each achene is 3.5‚Äì5 mm long, lacks wings and has a straight or partly curved beak that is 1‚Äì1.5 mm long. Both the Latin and common names reference the leaf shape, which is thinner and with distinctive serration when compared to A. quinquefolia. It is native to the eastern United States in North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia. Anemone lancifolia is normally found growing in rich damp soils in woods.

These car models use passenger door designs other than the standard design, which is hinged at the front edge of the door, and swings away from the car horizontally and towards the front of the car. List of non-standard door designs The main types of non-standard door designs are: * Butterfly butterfly doors move via hinges along the A-pillar, on an axis not aligned vertically or horizontally to the vehicle or ground. A special type of butterfly door is a single door at the front of the car with the steering wheel attached. * Canopy roof, windshield, and sides are one unit that moves upward, forward, or sideways to provide access. * Gullwing (also called \\"falcon-wing\\") hinged to the roof at the top horizontal edge of the door, and open upward on a horizontal axis. Gullwing doors with a second hinge between door and moving roof panel are called falcon wing doors. Similar to a Gull Wing door the Falcon wing door is a double hinged rear door on the Tesla Model X. The primary hinge is located along the midline of the roof, the second hinge is above the side window. This configuration has the advantage of allowing unobstructed access to the rear seats whilst also enabling the doors to open in a tight space because the door can initially open upwards before spreading outwards with a gap as small as 8-inches to adjacent vehicles. * Scissors rotate vertically at a fixed hinge at the front of the door, and open by rotating on a horizontal axis, perpendicular to the vehicle's length. Scissor doors that also move outward while rotating are called dihedral synchro-helix actuation doors. * Sliding mounted to or suspended from a track, and open by sliding horizontally alongside or into the vehicle sidewall, or open by sliding vertically into the vehicle sidewall or floor. Sliding doors that disappear into the floor horizontally are called rolling doors. * Suicide hinged on the rear end of the door-frame, and open horizontally towards the rear. * Swan opens outward like either a conventional door or a suicide door, but on an axis slightly tilted from vertical, or via articulation in the hinge to angle upward for better ground clearance Some custom limousines have enlarged doors.

Currivan (March 6, 1920 ‚Äì May 16, 1956) was an American football end. He was born and raised in Mansfield, Massachusetts and graduated from Mansfield High School in 1938. He then attended and graduated from Boston College in 1942. Fleet of foot and sure of hand, this All-American end's pass- catching and running abilities were key factors in boosting the Eagles to national rankings and berths in the 1941 Sugar Bowl and 1943 Orange Bowl. A stalwart defensive end as well, he was a major and versatile contributor to this great era of Boston College gridiron success. He played seven seasons in the National Football League (NFL) for the Chicago Cardinals (1943), the Boston Yanks (1945‚Äì1948), and the Los Angeles Rams (1948‚Äì1949). Currivan also played for \\"Card-Pitt\\" in 1944, a team that was the result of a temporary merger between the Cardinals and the Pittsburgh Steelers. The teams' merger was result of the manning shortages experienced league-wide due to World War II. Currivan married Catherine (Rockett) Currivan in 1946. He had two children, John Joseph in 1948 and Nancy Anne, in 1953. He died suddenly on May 16, 1956 of a cerebral hemorrhage while playing golf at Oyster Harbors Golf Club in Osterville, Massachusetts at age 36. Due to his outstanding athletic abilities he was inducted into the Boston College Varsity Club Athletic Hall of Fame 14 years after his death in 1970.

Multipole expansion The DMA method was devised by Prof. Anthony Stone of Cambridge University to describe the charge distribution of a molecule in terms of a multipole expansion around a number of centers. The idea of using a multi-center multipole expansion was earlier proposed by Robert Rein. Typically, the centers correspond to the atoms constituting the molecule, though this is not a requirement. A multipole series, consisting of a charge, dipole, quadrupole and higher terms is located at each center. Importantly, the radius of convergence of this multipole series is sufficiently small that the relevant series will be convergent when describing two molecules in van der Waals contact. The DMA series are derived from ab initio or density functional theory calculations using Gaussian basis sets. If the molecular orbitals are written as linear combinations of atomic basis functions the electron density takes the form of a sum of products of the basis functions, called density matrix elements. Boys (1950) showed that the product of two spherical Gaussian functions, centered at different points, can be expressed as a single Gaussian at an intermediate point known as the overlap center. If a basis of Gaussian functions is used, the product of two s functions is spherically symmetric and can be represented completely just by a point charge at the ‚Äòoverlap center‚Äô of the two Gaussian functions. The product of an s orbital and a p orbital has only charge and dipole components, and the product of two p functions has charge, dipole and quadrupole components. If the overlap center is not at an atom, one can move the origin of the multipole expansion to the nearest distributed multipole site, re- expressing the series to account for the change of origin. The multipole expansion will no longer terminate, but the higher terms will be small. One may take the sites wherever one chooses, but they will usually be at the atoms. For small molecules one may wish to use additional sites at the centers of bonds; for larger molecules one may use a single site to describe a group of atoms such as a methyl group. The DMA procedure is exact and very fast, but for modern large basis sets with diffuse basis functions it has to be modified somewhat. When the basis functions have exponents that are small, the product function extends over several atoms, and it is better to calculate the distributed multipoles by numerical quadrature over a grid of points. The grid can be defined so that each point is associated with a particular site, and the multipoles for each site are obtained by quadrature over the points belonging to that site. This description then includes at each site: *Charges, describing electronegativity effects in a chemically intuitive way; *Dipoles, arising from overlap of s and p orbitals and describing lone pairs and other atomic distortions; *Quadrupoles, arising from the overlap of p orbitals, and associated with pi bonds, for example; *Octopoles and hexadecapoles can be included if very high accuracy is required. The DMA describes the potential at points outside the molecule with an accuracy which is essentially that of the wavefunction, so that its use entails no loss of precision. The DMA description gives the electrostatic energy of interaction between two molecules. It does not account for charge overlap effects and hence excludes the penetration energy. Comparison to other methods DMA is inherently much more accurate than the commonly used partial charge methodologies for calculating intermolecular interaction energies, since it captures anisotropy of the atom-atom contributions to electrostatic interaction. It may therefore seem surprising that it has not been more widely used in molecular simulation. Possible reasons for this are: *Its non-inclusion in popular simulation codes; *The need to keep track of the orientation of a local axis system for each molecule; *The conformation-dependence of the DMA. As a consequence of its accuracy, the DMA captures features of the molecular charge distribution that depend strongly on molecular conformation. Thus, in a DMA-based simulation, the multipoles would have to be recalculated whenever a molecule underwent a conformational change. Applications DMA has found extensive use in crystal structure prediction for small organic molecules, where significant progress can often be made while using rigid molecular structures. It has also been used to develop force fields for molecular simulations, such as the AMOEBA force field.

For those students who desired to go on to high school before the opening of the high school in 1940, the board of education provided their tuition to Glenwood High School or to Portsmouth High School. \\"There were buses to transport students to and from school, but there was no cafeteria, therefore, students brought their lunches.\\" The first graduating class in 1940 was nicknamed the \\"Dirty Dozen\\" because there were twelve students that walked across the stage for the first time as Clay graduates. The district began with four buildings‚Äîone high school and three elementary schools. There were two buildings in Rubyville‚Äîthe current elementary building, which served as the high school from 1940‚Äì1956, and an elementary building (originally Sumers, later renamed Long Run School), which is now a local church. The district also had an elementary building in Eden Park, which still stands but is no longer used by the district, and one in Rosemount (Scioto Trail School), which was located on the current site of JW Village Market. In 1956, the Rubyville building (built in 1939) became the elementary building. With a bond issue to raise $325,000 (along with matching funds for a total cost of nearly $600,000) a new high school building, which opened its doors on February 1, 1956, was built on Clay High Street. Mr. Carl Bandy was the Executive Head of the Clay (Rural) Local School District when the high school was built in 1955. At that time, the enrollment of the district was 719. One year later, it was 915. During the period of peak employment at the Atomic Plant in Piketon (now U.S.E.C.), the enrollment was 1100. A new elementary building was then built in Rosemount (Rosemount Primary, built in 1964). The district currently uses a new PK-12 building constructed in 2010. In 1964 the Rosemount building was constructed, and a band room and junior high wing were added to the high school. In 1998 an additional \\"wing\\" was built on to the high school structure. Additional upgrades and renovations have occurred to all three buildings over the years including improvements to the high school gym, new science laboratories, renovations to all the restroom facilities, new roofs, and air conditioning for all three buildings. The enrollment for the district is currently 700. Photo gallery Image:RubyvilleGNUtn.jpg|Rubyville Elementary (served as Clay High School from 1940 to 1956).

At least 41 people were killed during the raid.  Details  The Chiricahua Apache raiding party was led by Victorio during his 1879‚Äì1880 guerrilla action. The party first attacked a silver mine near the present day town of Cooney, in the Mogollon Mountains on April 28, 1880. At the mining camp, they killed three. They then caught up to three men fleeing the area, one of whom was Sergeant Cooney, killing them all. Following the initial attack, the Apaches went on to kill another thirty-five people in the area, mainly sheepherders and their families. Victorio and his men left the region when U.S. Army troopers from Fort Bayard arrived.(nd) \\"The 'Alma Massacre' at Alma, New Mexico\\" from the WPA Writers Project, archived 7 October 2008 by Internet Archive  Memorials  There have been two memorials erected to commemorate the events.

He attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Class of 1953, where he was a member of the Chi Phi Fraternity.

In 1957, he was selected to the Pro Bowl and won seven of the eight games he started, leading the Browns to the Eastern Conference title. His performance that year was stellar. When compared to all other passers that have attempted 100 passes in a single season, O'Connell has the highest Passing Yards per Attempt average ever, a staggering 11.17. This is a great achievement when considering that in the 90+ years of NFL football, only three other quarterbacks have managed to attain a Passing Yards per Attempt average of over 10.0 for a season. His passer rating that year was 93.3, the fourth best in the decade of the 1950s.

Early life Pedro Juan Soto was born in Cata√±o, Puerto Rico, and went to primary and secondary school in Bayam√≥n. At the age of eighteen, he moved to New York City and attended Long Island University. He initially studied to become a doctor, but after being influenced by the works of Ernest Hemingway, he decided to dedicate his life to the study of literature. After graduating from Long Island with a Bachelor of Arts degree, he served in the United States Army for a year, and then went to Columbia University to obtain a Master of Arts degree. It is around this time that Soto began to publish his first works, Garabatos and Los inocentes, for which he won awards. He also published stories in Revista Asomante, a Hispanic magazine. Return to Puerto Rico In 1955, Soto moved back to Puerto Rico, where he continued to write novels and short stories, as well as a few dramas, and he later became a professor at the University of Puerto Rico. Among Soto's most famous works are Spiks, which deals with the struggles he and many other Puerto Ricans faced in New York, and Usma√≠l, a story set in the Puerto Rican island of Vieques in the early 20th century.

It is near to the holy Sangam, or confluence, where the rivers Ganges, Yamuna and the legendary Sarasvati meet. Kumbh Mela is near to this place. This temple is peculiar in that there is no statue of any deity in this temple, rather, there is a wooden carriage or 'doli' which is worshipped. The origin of the name, Alopi (disappeared) Bagh lies in the Hindu belief that after the death of his wife Sati, the grieving Shiva travelled through skies with her dead body. Vishnu, to relieve him from this agony, threw his Chakra at the corpse, resulting in the fall of various parts of the body at various places in India, which were sanctified by the touch of the Goddess' body parts and hence were thereby deemed holy places for pilgrimage. The last part fell at this location thereby named as \\"Alopi\\" (where disappearance was concluded)and the holiest of all. However, this claim is debatable since there is only one Shakti peeth in Allahabad which is Lalita Devi temple where fingers of Sati are supposed to have fallen. Another more credible version is found in oral history traditions narrated by old inhabitants of the area. It dates back to the time when the entire region was covered by dense forests infested with dreaded dacoits. A marriage procession happened to pass through the forest. Marriage processions, in medieval times, used to be the most vulnerable targets of robbers as they used to return loaded with gold and other riches received as gifts. While deep into the jungle, the marriage party found itself surrounded by robbers. After killing all the men and looting the wealth the robbers turned to the 'doli' or carriage of the bride. When they unveiled the carriage they found there was no one inside. The bride had magically disappeared. The word went around, history became legend and legend became myth. A temple came up at the site where this incident occurred and locals started worshiping the bride as \\"Alopi Devi\\" or the 'virgin goddess who had disappeared'. Alopi Devi continues to be worshiped by thousands of people living in the region who share every festival, marriage, birth and death with their guarding deity.. Though it was always a prominent temple in the neighborhood, its reach and following has seen a significant rise since the 1990s leading to large-scale renovation of the surrounding area. Modern history As per some historical evidences, Great Maratha Warrior Shreenath Mahadji Shinde had developed the Sangam place during his stay at Allahabad in 1772 AD. Maharani Bayzabai Scindia has done some works for renovation of Sangam ghats and temples at Allahabad.

He began piano lessons at four and taught himself ukulele and guitar when he was seven. At age eight, he started to write songs influenced by early rock musicians such as Little Richard, The Everly Brothers, and Elvis Presley. His two brothers formed a band in which he which performed these tunes and other rock songs from the 1950s. When he was thirteen, he started to play bassoon and became very interested in both classical music and jazz. By this time, Douglas had definitely decided on a career in music. His heroes in jazz were Bill Evans, Miles Davis, and John Coltrane, and he wrote his first jazz tunes at fourteen. He received an \\"Associate of the Royal Conservatory of Toronto\\" diploma in classical piano at age seventeen. From 1962‚Äì66, Douglas attended the University of Toronto and obtained a BA in music education. During this time, he became very interested in 20th-century classical music, and started composing pieces influenced by Anton Webern, Elliott Carter, and Igor Stravinsky, as well as such contemporary jazz artists as Paul Bley and Gary Peacock. He played fourth bassoon in the Toronto Symphony, and often played jazz piano gigs on weekends. Douglas was awarded a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship in 1966, and attended Yale University from 1966‚Äì69. There he met clarinetist Richard Stoltzman, and they have been touring and recording ever since. In 1967, Douglas played three concerti with the Toronto Symphony.

These were influenced by African, Indian, and Brazilian music, as well as contemporary classical music, jazz, and funk (particularly the 70s funk of Miles Davis and Herbie Hancock). They have been used in many schools around North America, and he performs at least one of them in all his concerts. Douglas also started to write short tonal and modal lyrical pieces for his students. These eventually became part of his concert repertoire, and he has recorded many of them. He also recorded, in 1976, three RCA albums of classical chamber music with pianist Peter Serkin and Tashi. In 1977, he moved to Boulder, Colorado to teach at the Naropa Institute.

A baccalaureate service (or, baccalaureate Mass in the case of institutions affiliated with the Catholic Church and its religious institutes) is a celebration that honors a graduating senior class from a college or high school or eighth grade. The event is typically a Christianity-based interdenominational service, though it may also be of a strictly Catholic nature. The service is held within a couple weeks of the graduation/commencement ceremony, perhaps on a Sunday before, the day preceding, or immediately preceding the graduation. Speakers selected tend to be community leaders, faculty members, students, or local religious leaders, and may be elected by the graduating class. Speeches are often intermixed with musical performances, drama, and worship. A modern-day Baccalaureate address generally lasts less than half an hour. In ancient times they could last as long as four hours. History A claim much repeated is that \\"the baccalaureate service is believed to have originated at the University of Oxford in 1432 when each bachelor was required to deliver a sermon in Latin as part of his academic requirements.\\" However, it was \\"examinatory sermons\\" that were required of all Oxford bachelors before their \\"inception\\" or commencement; these were mentioned in a 1311 statute. The American baccalaureate service is an outgrowth of the baccalaureate sermon. The earliest known in America is at the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) in 1760. Because of United States Supreme Court rulings such as Lee v. Weisman (1992) regarding the separation of church and state at public school graduation ceremonies, baccalaureate services are usually not official, school-sponsored events at American public schools. However, many have student-initiated services at private facilities not paid for with government funds, and as such are fully permitted by law. School-sponsored baccalaureate services for American public schools, on school grounds, occur rarely. The term baccalaureate may also be applied to similar, graduation-related events at some American high schools, such as presentations of awards and scholarships.

Biography Childhood and youth Oleg Borisov was born Albert Ivanovich Borisov on 8 November 1929 in Privolzhsk, Ivanovo Oblast, Russia, Soviet Union. His given name was Albert, which was chosen by his mother in honor of the Belgian prince Albert, who visited Moscow in 1929. His parents were agricultural professionals. His mother, Nadezhda Andreevna, was an agricultural engineer, and also played as an amateur actress at a local drama. His father, Ivan Borisov, was a wounded World War II veteran, who worked as director of Privolzhsk Agricultural Technical School. Becoming an actor Young Oleg Borisov was fond of acting and theatre, he was known as a good impersonator and comedian among his classmates at school. However, during the Second World War young Oleg Borisov was a tractor driver at a collective farm near Moscow. At the same time he was involved in amateur acting at his school drama class. After World War II Borisov graduated from a secondary school and applied to study at the Moscow Art Theatre (MKhAT). He passed a series of professional tests and was admitted to the Moscow Art Theatre School of Acting in 1947. While a student Borisov was regarded for his talent as a comedian. In 1951, Borisov graduated from the MKhAT School of Acting, and joined the troupe of the Lesya Ukrainka National Academic Theater of Russian Drama in Kiev. In 1954 he married Alla Romanovna (n√©e Latynskaya), the daughter of director of the Lesya Ukrainka Theatre. Their son, Yury Borisov, was born in 1956. Leningrad In 1964, director Georgi Tovstonogov invited Oleg Borisov to join the troupe of the Bolshoi Drama Theatre (BDT). From 1964‚Äì1983 Borisov was a permanent member of the troupe at BDT in Leningrad (St. Petersburg). There his stage partners were Tatyana Doronina, Lyudmila Makarova, Kirill Lavrov, Vladislav Strzhelchik, Innokenti Smoktunovsky, Yefim Kopelyan, Oleg Basilashvili, Yevgeni Lebedev, Pavel Luspekayev, Sergei Yursky, Vsevolod Kuznetsov, Nikolai Trofimov, and other notable Russian actors. Borisov played memorable roles in several productions, such as, Grigori Melekhov in And Quiet Flows the Don by Mikhail Sholokhov, Prince Harry in King Henry IV (1969 adaptation) by Shakespeare, and Siply in Optimistic Tragedy by Vsevolod Vishnevskiy. At that time he was also invited by director Lev Dodin to perform the leading role in Krotkaya (aka \\"A Gentle Creature\\") an adaptation of the eponymous short story by Fyodor Dostoyevsky. Film career In 1955, Borisov made his film debut at the Dovzhenko Film Studio in Kiev, Ukraine; he played a cameo role in film Mother (1955) by director Mark Donskoy. Eventually Oleg Borisov ascended to fame in the Soviet and Russian cinema, as he continued his film career in collaboration with such directors as Eldar Ryazanov, Andrei Tarkovsky, Aleksandr Muratov, Aleksei German, Viktor Tregubovich, Vladimir Bortko, Aleksandr Gordon, Vladimir Vengerov, and Vadim Abdrashitov, among other film directors. His best known roles in film were such works as Gudionov in Sluga by Vadim Abdrashitov, and Naoum Kheifitz in Luna Park by Pavel Lungin. Personality For several years Borisov was suffering from restrictions in the Soviet film industry, because he did not comply with the ridiculous rules of political obedience. The main reason was that Borisov never wanted to be a member of the Soviet Communist party. His personal revolt against the system resulted in several years of his underemployment: the system allowed him to play only little roles, making him almost invisible for a few years, a humiliation which he endured with dignity. Only director Vadim Abdrashitov was brave enough to break the Soviet censorship rules. He cast Borisov for the leading roles in his films The Train Has Stopped (1982) and Planet Parade (1984). Oleg Borisov was a stellar example of a rare, beautiful, and disobedient talent. He had to be untamed and free of any control in order to play his best roles. Borisov was at the peak of his stage and film career by the end of the 1970s, when suddenly he was dismissed by a film director for his disagreement about the movements of his character. In the Soviet reality that caused an impact on his work in film and on stage. He had no support from Communist Party, because he never wanted to be a member. Borisov chose his individual freedom at a high cost. He never was a slave of the Soviet system, and the system never let him have his freedom. Moscow Borisov suffered from professional restrictions, that were imposed on him, which caused him a serious stress with medical complications. Only a few of his colleagues were capable to understand his case. At that critical time Oleg Yefremov called Borisov in 1982, and invited him to work with the Moscow Art Theatre. From 1983-1990 Borisov was a member of the troupe with the Moscow Art Theatre. There his stage partners were Anastasiya Vertinskaya, Yevgeniy Yevstigneyev, Andrey Myagkov, and other notable Russian actors. At the same time Borisov made stage works at the Moscow Central Theatre of the Soviet Army, such as, his acclaimed portrayal of the Emperor Pavel I in the eponymous play by Dmitri Merezhkovsky. During the course of his acting career Borisov shared the views of Konstantin Stanislavski and Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko who believed that stage acting is a superior form of art. Borisov confessed that he had greater satisfaction from his stage works, than from any film. Recognition During many years Oleg Borisov suffered from a severe stress caused by political pressures on his acting career. He opposed the official system and contracted a stress-related blood disorder, a rare form of leukemia, which was misdiagnosed by the Soviet medical system. Borisov knew that his disease was incurable. However, his private conversations with actors-friends were sparkled with his wit and wisdom, and someone told him to write a book, which he did. He was writing notes for almost 20 years, which were published posthumously by his son, director . Oleg Borisov was designated People's Artist of the USSR (1978) and received the USSR State Prize (1978) for his stage works. In 1990 Borisov won Volpi Cup at the Venice Film Festival. He played over 70 roles in film and television. He also directed stage productions and led several popular radio shows. In 1992 Oleg Borisov made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem together with his wife. He died of complications from a blood disorder on 28 April 1994 in Moscow, Russia.

Designed by Frank Wright and opened in 1958 it was the first major ride to be built at the Pleasure Beach since World War II. The ride was subsequently modified in the 1960s by the Velare Brothers (the originators of Sky Wheels and Space Wheels). The top circuit preceding the switchbacks, containing a big drop and a shallower dip, was added making the ride about longer at 1,266 ft. Apparently, this change was inspired by a similar alteration of the Velare's Wild Mouse at Nu-Pike in Long Beach, California.Wild Mouse Rides: History Wild Mouse historic Plaque Ride Layout & Experience The Wild Mouse was by far the smallest of the \\"adult\\" coasters at the pleasure beach. The ride itself was packed into more-or-less a cube, bar one turn which pops out over the busy footpath below. Unlike most versions of this type of ride, passengers sat one in front of the other, in tandem. From the station, two 90 degree turns lead to the lift hill. Halfway up this, the car passed underneath another part of the track, so close that it was quite easily possible to reach up and touch it. At the top came the first of many 90¬∞ \\"near miss\\" turns, as the car would nearly plough straight into the turret of the nearby Ghost Train. Trim brakes were present just before the next turn, which lead to the first drop; however, these were rarely used. Even if the brakes were working, the car launched itself into the steep first drop, with the proximity of the structure giving a real feeling of speed. Following this drop, the ride went through a traditional zig-zag section, common to all Wild Mice, where the car darts forward and backward, gathering speed as it goes. These turns (as with almost all on this ride) were particularly tight, with the car wheels noticeably lifting from the track. Following this were two more very sharp 90¬∞ turns, followed immediately by two steep drops, one after the other and, both well hidden amongst the structure. These were followed by the aforementioned turnaround out of the structure over the heads of the queue pen (possibly designed to give the impression that the car has \\"burst\\" out of the ride). This lead the car heading straight towards the lift hill, only for a violent right-left chicane to throw the car aside at the last moment. This is immediately followed by a last hidden dip, throwing riders into the air, immediately followed by another 90¬∞ \\"near-miss\\" turn resulting in extremely high lateral G-Forces of 1.8 g. One final turn brought the car back toward the station.  Refurbishment  The ride was closed in November 2007, and it re- opened in time for Summer 2008. This was due to a complete refurbishment of the ride, including replacing all wood and repainting the entire structure. Magnetic brakes were installed on the final brake-run of the ride during the 2016‚Äì17 winter closed season, eliminating the need for manually operated brakes (as was previously the case with the friction brakes). The ride re- opened in April 2017 following installation and testing of the new brakes, however experienced more frequent technical issues during the rest of its operational life than it had done previously. It didn't see out the season closing in August 2017 with it being stated as Closed for Maintenance, and there was truth in this as more parts had been ordered for further modernization. However,sadly after nearly six decades in operation, the Wild Mouse was torn down over the 2017‚Äì18 closed season with no prior announcement made. Indeed, the ride was cited as being \\"closed for maintenance\\" on the park's official website even after the removal had taken place. After the knowledge of the ride's removal became public, the management of Blackpool Pleasure Beach released a statement in January 2018 confirming the permanent removal of the ride from the park: \\"After very careful consideration and planning, our current winter work programme has seen the permanent closure and dismantling of the Wild Mouse and the removal of the facade of the former Trauma Towers attractions.\\"Wild Mouse removal picture origin The Site has been left empty since its removal with a wooden fence being built to go around it.

He became a sought after and noted preacher and took as his preaching inspiration Saint Bernardine of Siena and also was a strong proponent of popular devotions that he worked to spread. His beatification was celebrated under Pope Innocent XI in 1685 after the pontiff confirmed the local and popular \\"cultus\\" to the late Franciscan while the cause reopened centuries later; Pope Benedict XVI confirmed his heroic virtue and named him as Venerable in 2006 and canonized him as a saint mere months later on 3 June 2007 in Saint Peter's Square upon the confirmation of a 1943 miracle attributed to his intercession. Life Szymon was born in Poland around 1437 to the poor and pious Grzegorz and Anna in the small town of Lipnica Murowana. He moved to the capital of Krak√≥w in order to pursue his education at the Jagiellonian college in 1454 while it was around this time that a sermon that John Capistran preached led him to consider a path to the priesthood; he joined the Order of Friars Minor as a result of this. He received a bachelor's degree in 1457. In 1457 he requested to be received into the order along with ten other fellow students at the order's convent of Saint Bernard in Stradom. The novice master Christoper of Varese oversaw his religious formation; the seminarian was later ordained as a priest around 1460. He had made his vows in 1458. The new priest was first stationed at the Franciscan convent in Tarn√≥w and later at Stradom where he became noted as a powerful preacher and for spreading popular devotions such as the Name of Jesus; his inspiration for his preaching was Bernardine of Siena and he went to Aquila on 17 May 1472 to participate in the solemn transfer of the saint's remains. Szymon later travelled to Pavia in 1478 for the order's General Chapter and fulfilled his wish of visiting the tombs of Simon Peter and Paul the Apostle as well as going on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. Szymon often observed long fasts and scourged himself as a penitential practice as was wearing a penitential girdle - on feasts related to the Mother of God he would add a second girdle in order to win her special favor. He died in mid-1482 a week after contracting the plague which he got after tending to the ill during the epidemic of the plague. He died with his gaze fixated on the Crucifix close to him. Sainthood The beatification for the late Franciscan came to fruition under Pope Innocent XI on 24 February 1685 in which the pontiff confirmed that there existed a spontaneous and enduring local \\"cultus\\" - or popular veneration - and therefore beatified him. The cause then remained inactive for several centuries despite best efforts to reopen it until Pope Pius XII requested its reopening in a decree for the cause's resumption on 25 June 1948. It remained further inactive for several decades afterwards until a diocesan process was opened in 2000 and concluded in a special Mass on 19 September 2000 that Cardinal Franciszek Macharski presided over. The Congregation for the Causes of Saints later validated this process on 25 October 2002 and received the official Positio in 2003 for assessment. The historians met to discuss the cause and approved it on 2 March 2004 as did the board of theologians on 12 October 2004 and the cardinal and bishop members of the C.C.S. on 11 January 2005. The late Franciscan's life of heroic virtue received the confirmation of Pope Benedict XVI on 19 December 2005 who declared him to be Venerable. The process for the investigation of the miracle needed for him to be sainted was investigated - the 1943 cure of a woman - and received the validation of the C.C.S. on 7 November 2003 before receiving that of the medical board on 14 April 2005.

It satirises the Falklands War. The book presents the story of the war in the format of a picture book for young children. It is written in a simple style with large, brightly coloured illustrations. Neither the Falkland Islands, the belligerent countries, nor their leaders are named in the text. Instead, the British prime minister Margaret Thatcher and the Argentine dictator General Leopoldo Galtieri are presented as a pair of metal monsters who send men to fight over a \\"sad little island\\" populated by a few shepherds who eat nothing but mutton. The old woman (who is \\"not real [but] made of Iron\\") derives from Thatcher's nickname \\"the Iron Lady\\", while the General (who is \\"not real [but] made of Tin Pots\\") derives from the slang term \\"tin-pot general\\" or \\"tin-pot dictator\\", meaning a petty authoritarian type. The book mentions several ways in which soldiers (who were \\"all real men, made of flesh and blood ... not made of Tin Pots or Iron\\") were killed or maimed; the pictures accompanying these parts of the text are monochrome pencil sketches, as opposed to the full-colour caricatures in the rest of the book. Following the victory by the soldiers of the Old Iron Woman, there are various celebrations, to which the maimed are not invited in case their appearance spoils the fun (a reference to actual occurrences at Falklands War memorial events). The refusal of either side to admit responsibility for civilian casualties is satirised with the statement that three of the islanders were killed, but that \\"nobody was to blame\\".

Hombre was canceled along with the bankruptcy of Commodore International. History In 1993, Commodore International ceased the development of the AAA chipset when they concluded conventional PC clones would have similar performance shortly after the AAA machines would be released. In the place of AAA, Commodore began to design a new 64-bit 3D graphics chipset based on Hewlett-Packard's PA-RISC architecture to serve as the new basis of the Amiga personal computer series. It was codenamed Hombre (pronounced \\"√≥mbre\\" which means man in Spanish) and was developed in conjunction with Hewlett-Packard over an estimated eighteen-month period. Backward compatibility Hombre does not support any planar mode, nor any emulation for the legacy Amiga chipset or Motorola 680x0 CPU registers, so it was completely incompatible with former Amiga models. According to Hombre designer Dr. Ed Hepler, Commodore intended to produce an AGA Amiga upon a single chip to solve the backward compatibility issues. This single chip would include Motorola MC680x0 core, plus the AGA chipset. The chip could be integrated in Hombre based computers for backward compatibility with AGA software. Design Hombre is based around two chips: a System Controller chip and a Display Controller chip. The System Controller chip was designed by Dr. Ed Hepler, well known as the designer of the AAA Andrea chip. The chip is similar in principle to the chip bus controller found in Agnus, Alice, and Andrea of the Amiga chipsets. The chip features the following: * A 100+ MHz PA-7150 SIMD microprocessor * An advanced DMA engine and blitter with 3D texture mapping and Gouraud shading * 16-bit resolution sound processor with eight voices The Display Controller Chip was designed by Tim McDonald, also known as the designer of the AAA Monica chip. It is similar in principle to the Denise, Lisa, and Monica chips found on original Amigas. In addition, the chipset also supported future official or third party upgrades through extension for an external PA-RISC processor. These chips and some other circuitry would be part of a PCI card, through the ReTargetable Graphics system. There were plans to port the AmigaOS Exec kernel to low-end systems, but this was not possible due to financial troubles facing Commodore at that time. Therefore, a licensed OpenGL library was to be used for the low-end entertainment system. The original plan for the Hombre-based computer system was to have Windows NT compatibility, with native AmigaOS recompiled for the new big-endian CPU to run legacy 68k Amiga software through emulation. Commodore chose the PA-7150 microprocessor over the MIPS R3000 microprocessor and first generation embedded PowerPC microprocessors, mainly because these low-cost microprocessors were unqualified to run Windows NT. This wasn't the case for the 64-bit MIPS R4200, but it was rejected for its high price at the time. Features Hombre was designed as a clean break from traditional Amiga chipset architecture with no planar graphics mode support. Commodore also decided to drop support for the original Amiga eight sprites because sprites had become less attractive to developers compared with fast blitters. Despite lack of compatibility, Hombre introduced modern technologies including these: * a fill rate of 30 million 3D rendered pixels per second (similar to Sony's PlayStation performance) * 16-bit chunky graphic modes (to reduce costs, Commodore abandoned 256 color mode with Color LUT registers) * 32-bit chunky with 8-bit alpha channel * 1280 √ó 1024 pixel progressive resolution with a 24-bit color palette * one sprite with a 24-bit color palette, used for the mouse pointer * four playfields at 16-bit graphics mode each * 3D texture mapping engine * Gouraud shading * Z-buffering * YUV compatibility with JPEG support * Standard TV and HDTV compatibility * 64-bit internal data bus and registers The chipset could be sold either as a high end PCI graphics card with minimal peripherals ASICs and 64-bit DRAM, or as a lower cost CD-ROM based game system (CD64) using cheap 32-bit DRAM. It could also be used for set-top box embedded systems. According to Dr. Ed Hepler, Hombre was to be fabricated in 3-level metal CMOS with the help of Hewlett-Packard. HP had fabricated the AGA Lisa chip and collaborated in the design of the AAA chipset. Commodore was planning to adopt the Acutiator architecture designed by Dave Haynie for Hombre before it filed bankruptcy and went out of business.

Fizeau interferometer A Fizeau interferometerLawson, Peter R. \\"Principles of Long Baseline Stellar Interferometry.\\" Course notes from the 1999 Michelson Summer School, held August 15‚Äì19, 1999. Edited by Peter R. Lawson. Published by National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, 2000. is an interferometric arrangement whereby two reflecting surfaces are placed facing each other. As seen in Fig 1, the rear-surface reflected light from the transparent first reflector is combined with front-surface reflected light from the second reflector to form interference fringes. The term Fizeau interferometer also refers to an interferometric arrangement used by Hippolyte Fizeau in a famous 1851 experiment that seemingly supported the partial ether- drag hypothesis of Augustin Jean Fresnel, but which ultimately played an instrumental role in bringing about a crisis in physics that led to Einstein's development of the theory of special relativity. See Fizeau experiment. Applications Fizeau interferometers are commonly used for measuring the shape of an optical surface: Typically, a fabricated lens or mirror is compared to a reference piece having the desired shape. In Fig. 1, the Fizeau interferometer is shown as it might be set up to test an optical flat. A precisely figured reference flat is placed on top of the flat being tested, separated by narrow spacers. The reference flat is slightly beveled (only a fraction of a degree of beveling is necessary) to prevent the rear surface of the flat from producing interference fringes. A collimated beam of monochromatic light illuminates the two flats, and a beam splitter allows the fringes to be viewed on-axis. The reference piece is sometimes realized by a diffractive optical element (computer-generated hologram or CGH), as this can be manufactured by high accuracy lithographic methods. Fig. 2 illustrates the use of CGHs in testing. Unlike the figure, actual CGHs have line spacing on the order of 1 to 10 ¬µm. When laser light is passed through the CGH, the zero- order diffracted beam experiences no wavefront modification. The wavefront of the first-order diffracted beam, however, is modified to match the desired shape of the test surface. In the illustrated Fizeau interferometer test setup, the zero-order diffracted beam is directed towards the spherical reference surface, and the first-order diffracted beam is directed towards the test surface in such a way that the two reflected beams combine to form interference fringes. Figure 2. Optical testing with a Fizeau interferometer and a computer generated hologram Fizeau interferometers are also used in fiber optic sensors for measuring pressure, temperature, strain, etc. Fizeau's ether-drag experiment Significance Figure 3. Fizeau interferometer for measuring the effect of water movement upon the speed of light. In 1851, Fizeau used an entirely different form of interferometer to measure the effect of movement of a medium upon the speed of light, as seen in Fig. 3\\\\. According to the theories prevailing at the time, light traveling through a moving medium would be dragged along by the medium, so the measured speed of the light would be a simple sum of its speed through the medium plus the speed of the medium. Fizeau indeed detected a dragging effect, but the magnitude of the effect that he observed was far lower than expected. His results seemingly supported the partial ether-drag hypothesis of Fresnel, a situation that was disconcerting to most physicists. Over half a century passed before a satisfactory explanation of Fizeau's unexpected measurement was developed with the advent of Einstein's theory of special relativity. Experimental setup Light reflected from the tilted beam splitter is made parallel using a lens and split by slits into two beams, which traverse a tube carrying water moving with velocity v. Each beam travels a different leg of the tube, is reflected at the mirror at left, and returns through the opposite leg of the tube. Thus, both beams travel the same path, but one in the direction of flow of the water, and the other opposing the flow. The two beams are recombined at the detector, forming an interference pattern that depends upon any difference in time traveling the two paths. The interference pattern can be analyzed to determine the speed of light traveling along each leg of the tube.

She appeared from 2007 to 2009. Character's history Lexi first appears, hanging around Home Farm. Rodney Blackstock (Patrick Mower) asks her to leave but she tells him she is related to the family. While he goes to check, she climbs into the house via the kitchen window, and when she is found, Carrie Nicholls (Linda Lusardi) says Lexi is her younger sister. Lexi stays in Emmerdale, and Carrie insists she get a job. Lexi soon starts at The Woolpack as a barmaid. While Carrie and Lexi's relationship is difficult, Lexi is close to Carrie's daughter, Scarlett (Kelsey-Beth Crossley), and makes friends with Chas Dingle (Lucy Pargeter). Eli Dingle (Joseph Gilgun) discovers that Lexi was previously in prison in Mexico. After leaving \\"The Woolpack\\", she gets a job at Eric's factory, and in late 2008, is appointed supervisor, over many more experienced and long- serving employees, causing resentment from other workers but they come round eventually. In September 2007, Lexi, Chas and Debbie Dingle (Charley Webb) steal a necklace worth ¬£50,000 from a jewellery auction at Home Farm. Lexi cuts the power and, in the dark, Debbie snatches the necklace and hides it in her jacket. They plan to get Eric Pollard (Chris Chittell) to sell it and split the money four ways. However, Debbie is unhappy with this, so she and Eric plan to tell Chas and Lexi that the necklace was a fake and quietly sell it later, splitting the money between themselves. However, Lexi hears Debbie and Pollard discussing this and they fight but the necklace is lost down a drain. Horrified, Carrie asks Lexi what has happened to her since their mother died and Lexi tells her that she knows Carrie is her real mother. Carrie gave birth to her when she was 14 and her parents adopted baby Lexi. Lexi wanted Carrie to acknowledge that they were mother and daughter but Carrie refused. She did, however, tell Lexi that her father's name was Barry and was three years older than her. Carrie had been impressed with him because he had a car but wasn't in love with him. Disappointed, Lexi leaves the village for a while. On her return, Lexi starts sleeping with Ross Kirk (Samuel Anderson), unaware that he is also sleeping with Chas. Carl realises and tells Lexi who, furious, tells Chas. Chas sees that Lexi is interested in Carl King (Tom Lister) and warns her to stay away from him but Lexi ignores her and sleeps with Carl, in the hope he would make her Scarlett's trustee at King & Sons. Matthew becomes trustee and when Chas finds out about Lexi and Carl, she wants nothing more to do with them. When Carl goes to work with Donald De Souza (Michael Jayston), Matthew King (Matt Healy) blackmails Lexi to spy on Carl; threatening to tell Scarlett that she had worked as a lap dancer if she refused. Chas realises what Lexi is planning and warns Carl but he hires her anyway. They soon get back together and as she falls in love with Carl, Lexi is increasingly reluctant to work for Matthew. Carl discovers Matthew using the proposals he was working on and blames Jimmy King (Nick Miles). After punching Jimmy, he and Donald tell Carl the truth. Carl makes up with his brothers and Lexi loses her job. Although Carl is angry, they soon made up. When Lexi returns from Carrie's wedding in Thailand, she tells Carl that Carrie told her that he murdered his father Tom King (Ken Farrington). The revelation makes Carl feel he has to stay with Lexi, instead of ending things with her for Anna De Souza (Emma Davies). By December 2008, Lexi is involved with many King family activities and is living with them. After Matthew's death and the company going bust, they move into Mill Cottage. These changes make the family want to make a new start, and Scarlett wants to join her mother in Canada but Lexi persuades them to stay until the New Year, and later decide not to leave the area. After a brief engagement, Lexi and Carl marry on 31 March 2009. The wedding almost does not happen, when Carl does not appear. Unknown to Lexi, he had been trying to persuade his former love, Chas, to be with him again. She refuses, so he goes ahead with the wedding. In April, Lexi tells Carl that she wants a baby and he unwillingly agrees. In June, Lexi discovers that she is pregnant but only days later, discovers her pregnancy is ectopic. A few days later, she learns that her remaining fallopian tube is badly damaged and is unlikely to conceive naturally. He recommended she and Carl try IVF treatment. Around the same time, Lexi lost her job when the factory closed. Carl refuses to go ahead with the IVF, finally admitting that he does not want more children. He suggests they separate if she wants children that badly but she decides Carl means more to her than a family of her own. However, on 13 August, Lexi and Carl finally confront each other on the hospital roof days after Nicola King (Nicola Wheeler) gave birth to her and Jimmy's daughter, Angelica. Carl admits he never loved her and only married her because she knew he killed his father. She then decides to leave the village. Reception In 2009 Ruth Deller of entertainment website Lowculture praised Lexi's exit storyline branding it as heartbreaking, being her favourite storyline of the time, also stating: \\"Another character bowing out this month, but this time doing so in heartbreaking style. Sally Oliver‚Äôs portrayal of Lexi going through an ectopic pregnancy was fantastic, and the explosion of Lexi and Carl‚Äôs relationship provided a very emotional and well- written departure.

The series started airing on May 2007, and was filmed in Mexico City under the direction of producers Rodolfo de Anda and Alexis Ayala. It aired its third and final season Mondays on Canal 5 at 10:00pm and on cable TV channel Galavisi√≥n Tuesdays at 21:30pm. The character of El Pantera was created in the 1970s by the writer Daniel Mu√±oz and artist Juan Alba for Mundo Vid. A novel called El Pantera, or La Noche del Pantera was written by Mu√±oz in the 1990s, followed by El Misterio de la Amenaza Negra.  Plot  Gervasio Robles Villa, son of a white man and a Oaxacan Indian woman, is imprisoned for assassinating his fianc√©e, a crime that he did not commit. During the time he was in jail, he learned Wushu from a mysterious man called \\"El Indio\\" (a Native American convicted for tax evasion). The Main General of the police, Porfirio Ayala, convinced of Villa's innocence, decides to release him and return him the life he was taken from. Nevertheless, this act of kindness is conditional. Gervasio will be able to remain free under one condition: he must work secretly with the police and to catch criminals who inhabit the city. Now, El Pantera must find himself, recover his life and discover what his destiny is, to be known as ‚ÄúThe Panther‚Äù. Once in the city he meets a beautiful woman named Lola. Despite the fact that Lola has a past that not every woman would be proud of El Pantera falls in love with her. In the 2nd Season, El Pantera must confront a new truth, that his girlfriend Rosaura was not killed, but faked her death in order to ascend to the title of \\"Reina del Narco\\" loosely translated as \\"Queen of the Drugtrade\\", as daughter of \\"El Rubio Barrios\\" she was in charge of running the Gulf Drug Cartel. El Pantera then must fight against Police, the Mexican Army, the Pacific Cartel, Korean Mafias and the DEA to save the woman he still loves from torture, death, and even her own ambition.

The plaza is flanked by important buildings, among them the former Tribunals Palace, now seat of the Faculty of Law of the National University of Rosario and of the Dr. √Ångel Gallardo Provincial Natural Sciences Museum, and the former headquarters of the Santa Fe Provincial Police, now a delegation of the provincial government and host to a small museum of the last dictatorship (Centro Popular de la Memoria). History The land where the plaza is located was donated by Marcos Paz in 1857, and was much larger than at present (extending several blocks to the south). Its purpose was to serve as a marketplace, where cargo wagons that came and went between Rosario and other cities farther away from the littoral would stop to load and unload. When the railway system was established, in 1871, the municipal government projected to build a square, which was referred to as Plaza San Mart√≠n already in 1884, while it was still an empty lot. In 1888, the municipality gave up most of the land for the construction of the Tribunals, leaving the terrain with its current dimensions.

Smith is best known for playing Robert Sugden from 1989 until 2001, when he was axed and replaced by Karl Davies. In September 2001, Smith sued Yorkshire Television for unfair dismissal from his part as Robert. The axing was due to the producers' intentions to feature Robert in more adult plots, therefore requiring an older actor for the part. The recasting took place while Robert was off-screen visiting his grandmother, Annie Sugden, in Spain after learning his adoptive brother Andy was responsible for starting the barn fire that killed his stepmother. Smith currently works as a producer on the acclaimed talk show Talking Dead. Personal life Smith lives in Los Angeles, California. He supports Bradford City AFC. His parents own Love Bites, a sandwich wholesaler based in Bradford.

Boys' father was a farrier in the Royal Field Artillery. 'Jim' Boys left school aged 14, and in 1937 he enlisted in the 2nd Battalion, Coldstream Guards and transferred to the 3rd Battalion when that Battalion was posted overseas.

Boys Archive website Medal researcher On his return to the United Kingdom Boys became a Prison Officer at HM Prison Wandsworth where he was in charge of a workshop manned by the prisoners which produced equipment for the armed services. He became interested in collecting medals during the 1950s, and he became an early member of the Orders and Medals Research Society. Boys took early retirement from the Prison Service in 1968, and then worked for a number of years for the Ministry of Defence, inspecting the manufacture of military equipment. Eventually his interest in medals lead him to begin collecting material concerning the men of the Light Brigade who had taken part in the famous Charge of the Light Brigade in 1854. Boys was tireless in the pursuit of information, and wherever possible he traced the life of every man of the Light Brigade from his birth through to his death, and in a number of cases traced their relatives to the present day to gain as much information as possible. The lives of many of these men are only recorded in the accounts he created. For more than forty years Boys gathered information from a huge range of sources, including official records from the War Office, India Office, the Public Record Office, contemporary newspapers, census returns, church records, Registries of Births, Deaths and Marriages, and many local and national libraries. He corresponded with descendants and wider-family members, modern- day regiments, and other organisations and individuals throughout the world, including the noted Charge of the Light Brigade historian Canon William Lummis, seeking and exchanging information, photographs and transcripts of letters and other published and unpublished documents. As a result of his research, Jim Boys accumulated a substantial collection of contemporary material ‚Äì photographs, paintings and other images, letters and autobiographies (including accounts of the Charge never previously published). To these he added modern photographs of medals, memorials and gravestones, most of which he took himself. He also owned a private collection of Crimean War medals awarded to 'Chargers'. The result is widely regarded among many historians as being the most complete and authoritative record of the lives of men of the Light Brigade, and their families, in existence. He lived for many years in Wandsworth with his wife Nitza Asnay Boys and his son Philip.

It is situated along the river Hollandse IJssel and has over 4000 inhabitants. Ouderkerk aan den IJssel, together with Lageweg and IJssellaan, was a separate municipality until 1 January 1985 when the municipalities in the Krimpenerwaard were reorganized and it was merged with Gouderak to form the municipality Ouderkerk. Of these, Ouderkerk aan den IJssel is the largest population centre and the location of the town hall. History The town is named for its \\"old church\\", which was a prominent landmark for centuries on the horizon for ships travelling along the IJssel river. There is an indication that a little church may have been present here in the 10th century. This would be remarkable since the Krimpenerwaard would have been a swamp at that time except for some minor hills. As the Krimpenerwaard has dried up and the river dikes along the river have been raised, the church has \\"sunk\\" much lower in the landscape today than in former centuries, which was the reason for raising the tower in the 19th century. The oldest official reference to the village is from 1263 when it was called Oudekerke. Though several Roman coins from the fourth century have been found, this does not confirm the presence of a Roman settlement. But it is probable that there was an older village here called IJsele until the 12th century. Remains of a tuff stone church foundation from that same century have been found. Henry de Nassau, Lord Overkirk, an army leader during the Spanish War of Succession, is buried in the main church.

At that time, the Fed argued that rising and variable inflation since 1965 was largely attributable to non-monetary forces such as the power of labor unions and oil price shocks, and had little to do with rapid money growth. Based on the principles of monetarism developed earlier by Milton Friedman, the SOMC blamed the Great Inflation squarely on Federal Reserve policies that featured excessive money growth. The SOMC's principal message that persistent inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon has been widely accepted by central bankers and economists. That framework still forms the basis for the Committee's comments on and criticisms of Federal Reserve policy actions and strategy. Over time, the SOMC has broadened its focus to include issues relating to policies on international trade, exchange rates, and taxes, as well as the regulation of the U.S. banking and financial systems. The SOMC continues to meet twice per year and maintains an active website that includes an archive of the SOMC's position papers and \\"Core Beliefs\\" statement as well as papers of its members. Since 2009, the SOMC has operated in partnership with E21: Economic Policies for the 21st Century. Founding and early history Allan Meltzer has described the circumstances that led him, together with Karl Brunner, to organize the Shadow Open Market Committee, and has also chronicled the SOMC‚Äôs early history.Allan H. Meltzer. \\"The Shadow Open Market Committee: Origins and Operations\\" Journal of Financial Services Research vol.18 (December 2000): pp.119-128. When, in 1971, President Richard Nixon adopted wage and price controls in an attempt to reverse the acceleration of inflation, which by then had risen above 4 percent, Brunner and Meltzer wished to form a group of \\"like-minded economists\\" to argue against the effectiveness of wage and price controls as a tool for ending inflation and in favor of a gradual reduction in money growth as a preferred alternative. Together with William Wolman, Brunner and Meltzer chose the name \\"Shadow Open Market Committee,\\" as a reference to both the Federal Open Market Committee, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy making arm, and the Shadow Cabinet as the group of ministers chosen from the opposition party within the U.K. Parliamentary system.Meltzer (2000) p.121. The original SOMC featured twelve members, equal to the number of voting members of the Federal Open Market Committee, chosen from academic institutions, financial institutions, and nonfinancial businesses. Beginning on September 14, 1973, the group met semi-annually in New York City. John Allan of the New York Times described the first SOMC meeting and policy statement.John H. Allan. \\"Monetarists Huddle, Send Central Bankers a Play.\\" New York Times (17 September 1973), pp. 49, 52. The Committee urged the Fed to abandon its efforts to fine tune the economy, and focus instead on reducing the rate of money growth from 6 ¬Ω to 5 ¬Ω percent per year, as an initial step towards working inflation down to more acceptable levels. In 1988, the SOMC moved its meeting location from New York to Washington. Changes in membership gradually occurred, with some former SOMC members leaving to accept high- ranking positions at the Federal Reserve. In this sense, Meltzer points out, the SOMC has functioned somewhat like the U.K. Shadow Cabinet, with its members rotating periodically into official policymaking positions. Original SOMC member Robert Rasche served as Executive Vice President and Policy Advisor at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis from January 1999 until his retirement in June 2011. Beryl Sprinkel, another original SOMC member, became Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in 1985. SOMC member Jerry Jordan served as a member of the Council of Economic Advisors in 1981 and 1982 and as President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland from 1992 through 2003. Lee Hoskins served as President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland from 1987 through 1991; William Poole as President of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis from 1998 through 2008; and Charles Plosser as President and of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia from 2006 through 2015. Anna Schwartz was the longest-serving member of the Shadow Open Market Committee. One of the 12 original members in 1973, Schwartz continued to attend and participate actively in SOMC meetings through 2010. Subsequent and recent developments In 2009, the SOMC moved the site of its bi-annual meetings back to New York City. At its November 2014 meeting, the Committee presented a statement of \\"Core Beliefs,\\" intended to \\"help promote its vision and relevance in an era of increasingly complex central banking.\\"Shadow Open Market Committee. The SOMC and Its Core Beliefs\\" Position Paper. 3 November 2014. The SOMC Core Beliefs relate to the conduct of monetary policy and to the Federal Reserve's role as lender of last resort. They are as follows: # The SOMC takes for granted that U.S. monetary policy will be conducted by the Fed over the foreseeable future. # It is essential that the central bank be independent from the fiscal authorities and accountable to the legislature. In particular, the central bank should eschew policies that allocate credit. # Price stability is the best contribution that monetary policy can make to overall macroeconomic performance and for this reason should be the primary objective of the central bank. \\"Price stability\\" should be defined to insure that the inflation rate, on average, is not above 2 percent per year. # Monetary policy should be conducted in a rule-like manner and be somewhat countercyclical with respect to output and employment, as long as price stability over the long run is not compromised. We expect the central bank to announce the policy rule that it follows so that it can be monitored and held accountable. # To provide financial stability, the central bank should promote strong capital buffers. # The SOMC expects the central bank will serve as a lender of last resort. In this role, the central bank should state its lender of last resort policy rules clearly in advance. Such activities should be limited to occasional, temporary, well-collateralized lending to solvent, supervised depository institutions at an appropriate interest rate premium. More expansive lending should be agreed and indemnified in advance by the fiscal authorities. # The SOMC believes that, by following these basic principles, the Fed would create the monetary and financial framework that best facilitates the efficient functioning of free- market, prosperity-creating, institutions in the U.S. economy.

Banner. Plot summary The story begins on X Street in Washington, D.C., where the New Zealand legation is located. Caroll Lockyear walks out of the legation at 11:29. The secretary, Gertrude Wagner, writes down an appointment that Lockyear has for next week with Mr. Gosling. On her desk is a sealed envelope containing something heavy that is inscribed, Deliver to Mr. Kermit Gosling, at 11:30 a.m. sharp. As Lockyear leaves, Gertrude walks past Captain Cozzens and Alvin Odel, whose job it is to watch Gosling's office. Gertrude opens the door, and three shots ring out. Gosling has three bullet holes in him, and he is dying. Odel and Cozzens run in, asking \\"Where is the gun?\\" Gertrude opens the envelope on her desk, and a wisp of smoke comes out. The gun that killed Gosling had been sitting on Gertrude's desk in a sealed envelope since it was delivered earlier that morning. Senator Banner is at The Idle Hour Club when a letter calls him to the legation to lend his investigative talents. The gun is revealed to be a Russian Tokarev. Banner investigates, and discovers the envelope was delivered at 10 a.m. by a 10-year-old kid who didn't say whether it had been given to him by a man or a woman. The envelope was untouched until it was taken to Gosling's room. Gertrude is stalked by Odel, who is convinced she is the killer. Gertrude tries to convince him that she is not the killer but Odel believes it is her, because she is from East Germany. Gertrude leaves, but before she does, she slips Odel a piece of paper with two circles on it; a small one inside a big one. Gertrude leaves, and meets up with the real killer, on X Street, who shoots her to death. A patrolman finds Gertrude's body. The gun that shot her is revealed to be an American .38. Odel shows Banner the drawing of a circle within a circle. Banner rushes McKitrick and the group to the legation, where he is waiting. As they arrive, Banner gives everyone the answer. They search the legation, looking for a recording tape, which is found in a light socket. Banner has them arrest Caroll Lockyear. Banner reveals that Gertrude was being forced to help Lockyear with his murder plot. Lockyear was a Communist agent, and Gertrude's mother and father were stuck in East Germany. Lockyear claimed he could get them out, but threatened to have them killed unless she helped him. Using a tape recorder, Lockyear recorded three minutes of silence, then fired three shots with the Tokarev, then recorded more silence. The day he killed Gosling, Lockyear arranged for the delivery of an envelope containing a toy gun to Gertrude's desk. He then went to the legation with a briefcase that had an identical empty envelope in it, and a silenced Tokarev. He stalled Gosling until a time as close to 11:30 as possible, then shot him and started the tape recording. Lockyear sealed the gun into the empty envelope. As Lockyear left, he put his briefcase on Gertrude's desk, holding the envelope against it. He picked the other envelope on Gertrude's desk up and replaced it with the envelope holding the real gun. After the shots on the tape recording were heard, when everyone was examining Gosling's body, Gertrude shut off the tape recorder. She had drawn the two circles to draw attention to a reel of recording tape. Lockyear killed her, thinking she had already destroyed the tape.

The zoo was opened in Cornwall on Whit Monday, 26 May 1969 by the local council (Newquay Urban District Council, later Restormel District Council). It was privately owned by Mike Thomas and Roger Martin from 1993 until 2003. In August 2003 Stewart Muir became the new Director and the zoo became part of the Whitley Wildlife Conservation Trust, alongside Paignton Zoo and Living Coasts. The zoo is part of a registered charity, and was awarded various South West and Cornwall 'Visitor Attraction of The Year' and 'Sustainable Tourism' awards for excellence in 2006, 2007 and 2008. Newquay Zoo is now run as part of the Wild Planet Trust, the new name for the Whitley Wildlife Conservation Trust.  Cooperative links and awards  The zoo has been recognised for providing sustainable tourism and was one of the first few British zoos to gain an ISO 14001 certificate for its environmental management systems along with a recent Gold award for GTBS Green Tourism Business Scheme. The zoo works within the BIAZA and EAZA zoo networks in Britain and Europe but has other ex-situ conservation links overseas. A recent Cornwall Sustainable Tourism award and BIAZA award for sustainability projects recognised an interactive map of Newquay promoting self-guided walking tours around the town and Newquay area, featuring its history, heritage, wildlife and public transport links.  The Zoo today  Newquay Zoo is Cornwall's largest zoo and now covers over of land, as well as housing over 130 species. The original zoo was around . An expansion of opened as an African Savanna area from Easter 2009 followed by a central new Philippines area housing endangered fishing cat, Visayan warty pig and Philippine spotted deer.

Newquay Zoo meerkat The zoo is home to part of an international breeding programme for some endangered species such as Owston's palm civet and red-fronted macaw for which an overseas in-situ conservation support programme of funding and skills exchange exists, along with support for the unau sloth project and pacarana in South America, pangolin and small carnivore conservation programme in South East Asia. The World Land Trust BIAZA zoo reserve in South America is also supported through the wild spaces scheme. The EAZA Campaign is supported annually. Recent overseas project information can be found for each project on the zoo website. Increasingly animal species held at the zoo are listed as threatened or endangered species on the Red Data lists produced by the IUCN.  Tropical house  The zoo has an immersive tropical house exhibit which houses rainforest plants and animals including a sloth, tropical birds, reptiles and insects.  Developments since 2009  An additional paddock enclosure area of several acres (formerly a disused school playing field) was added to form the African Savanna area for mixed Hoofstock including Chapman's Zebra, Nyala and Black Wildebeest. This small 2009 expansion created the opportunity to reuse the old mixed African Plains exhibit, redeveloped into the Philippines area replaced the , now featuring enclosures for endangered Philippine endemic island animals such as Philippine Spotted Deer and Visayan Warty Pig along with Asian Fishing Cat. In 2016 a new walkthrough aviary Gems of the Jungle was created for endangered Southeast Asian song birds. This new aviary replaced a former 1969 cat house turned aviary and the role of the now demolished 1969 Walkthrough Aviary, modelled on the Snowden Aviary at London Zoo.  Other interesting features  Animal encounters and feeding time talks are also available throughout the year. A Tarzan Trail activity adventure trail, Children's Play Area and the Dragon Maze (hedge maze designed by mazemaker Adrian Fisher in 1983) are provided for children's entertainment.  Cooperative projects  Newquay Zoo works with other organisations on events and educational projects such as the Charles Darwin bicentenary year events in 2009. It partnered Falmouth Art Gallery in hosting Cornish artists including John Dyer to produce material for four 2009 exhibitions at Falmouth, the port where Charles Darwin left at the end of his voyage in 1836. Some material was lent from the growing Newquay Zoo Archive of zoo historical material for these exhibitions and displays at Falmouth and Newquay Zoo.  Education projects  Since 2000 Newquay Zoo has provided teaching input and practical opportunities for FE and HE students enrolled at the adjacent Newquay Centre for Applied Zoology Cornwall College Newquay on zoological conservation, education and media courses. The campus is based next to Newquay Zoo. This unusual and innovative partnership project was recognised by a BIAZA zoo education award in 2003 and 2016.

Carol J. Oja has written that, \\"with the 'Tonight' quintet, Bernstein once again created a masterpiece of ensemble, one that rivals the best of such moments in European opera.\\" Her remark echoes the earlier view of Will Crutchfield. In his review of the 1984 studio performance of West Side Story, which was conducted by Bernstein himself, Crutchfield wrote that the release of the recording \\"is above all an occasion for celebrating one of the great operas of our century. ... This idea is hotly resisted, but the best argument for it is here on the records in the music itself. I can see no reason why the 'Tonight' ensemble should not be compared to the quartet from Rigoletto.\\" Based on the duet between Maria and Tony earlier in the musical, \\"Tonight\\", the five parts of the quintet are sung by the Jets, the Sharks, Tony, Maria, and Anita. The song begins with the parts sung in turn, and then overlapping and building to the final line, \\"Tonight,\\" sung by the ensemble with multiple harmonies. The Jets and the Sharks are rival gangs anticipating the \\"rumble\\" which will settle a territorial feud that has been brewing between them for some time now. Both groups are confident that the fight will end in their favor. The song is used to show anticipation to the coming night, which will end up being the climactic part of the play. Anita sings of her anticipation for her boyfriend, Bernardo, the leader of the Sharks, to return after the rumble. She knows that he is usually riled up after a fight like this and she looks forward to having some intimate time together and \\"getting her kicks.\\" In the 1961 film version of West Side Story, Anita sings \\"He'll walk in hot and tired, poor dear / No matter if he's tired, as long as he's here\\" rather than \\"He'll walk in hot and tired, so what / No matter if he's tired, as long as he's hot.\\" Tony, a member of the Jets, has fallen in love with Maria, Bernardo's sister. At Maria's request, he plans to go to the rumble and stop the fight. Maria and Tony sing about their eagerness to see each other after Tony returns; they believe that after Tony stops the fight, the tension surrounding their forbidden love will finally vanish and the night will be \\"endless.\\" They are frustrated by the seemingly slow place of the present day while they are anticipating the coming night. The dramatically contrasting elements in this scene and their corresponding presentation in music have been compared to the trio \\"Cosa sento!\\" from Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro.\\"Operatic Elements in Leonard Bernstein's score for West Side Story\\", Bachelor of Music (Composition) paper by Samuel Pender-Bayne, Sydney Conservatorium of Music, June 2011 Part of the song was parodied in a promo to the 2005 WWE Royal Rumble event where the Superstars from Raw and Smackdown gather for a rumble until Vince McMahon wakes up from the dream sequence and says that's not the rumble he had in mind.

Boris Babochkin was one of the first internationally recognized stars of the Soviet-Russian cinema. He rose to fame with the title role in the classic film Chapaev (1934) and later, in the 1950s, he played a sharp anti-communist character on stage in Moscow, for which he was censored by the Soviet Communist Party.–¢–µ–∞—Ç—Ä–∞–ª—å–Ω–∞—è —ç–Ω—Ü–∏–∫–ª–æ–ø–µ–¥–∏—è (–ø–æ–¥ —Ä–µ–¥. –°. –°. –ú–æ–∫—É–ª—å—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ) Biography Life on the Volga Babochkin was born on 18 January 1904, in Saratov on the Volga river in Russia. His father, Andrei Babochkin, came from a family of Russian merchants and traders. The father had owned a successful trade business in the city of Saratov on Volga, then sold his business and worked for a railroad. The Babochkins lived in Krasny Kut, a small station near Saratov. His mother, a school teacher, was fond of Russian classical literature, and young Babochkin was brought up in an intellectually stimulating environment. Young Boris Babochkin and his brother were fond of acting and were involved in amateur theatre productions in Saratov. At age 14 Boris joined the Red Army and served for one year in the same front on Volga and the Urals with the legendary commander Chapayev, whom he would later portray, although they never met. Early career In 1920 Babochkin entered a local drama school in Saratov, but he soon dropped out and moved to Moscow to pursue an acting career. At first he enrolled in the well-known drama school of Michael Chekhov affiliated with the Moscow Art Theatre. There Babochkin studied with Michael Chekhov for a few months. He admired Chekhov, but eventually their personalities clashed. In 1921, he left Chekhov's school to join \\"Molodye Mastera\\" studio, under Illarion Pevtsov, a well-connected figure in Soviet film and theatre. There, with his elder brother Vitaly Babochkin, Boris worked his first professional season on stage. In the following six years he played seasonal gigs on stage with various troupes in Moscow and Saratov, then in Samarkand and Bishkek in Central Asia, and then in Voronezh, Mogilev in Belarus, and Berdichev in Ukraine. Leningrad From 1927 to 1940 Babochkin lived and worked in Leningrad. He married a young ballerina, Ekaterina Georgieva, and they became involved in the city's cultural life. Babochkin continued his studies of theatre and film, and made his film acting debut at Lenfilm Studio in 1927. In 1934 he played the leading role in Chapaev, a classic film that brought him global fame and local jealousy. During the 1930s he played leading roles at the Leningrad State Puskin Drama Theater and at the Bolshoi Drama Theater under director Aleksei Dikiy. In 1937, when Dikiy was arrested and imprisoned in the Gulag camps, Babochkin was hurt and suffered an emotional crisis. However, he survived the first wave of Stalin's Great Purge. In 1937 Babochkin stepped in as artistic director of the Bolshoi Drama Theater (BDT) in Leningrad and worked in that position until 1940. Moscow In 1940 Babochkin was summoned by the Soviet leadership and moved back to Moscow, a move that he later described as the biggest mistake in his life. During World War II he made several trips to Leningrad, besieged by the Nazis, where he supported the defenders of Leningrad under the Siege and helped lift their spirits with his performances, while they were struggling to survive. After the war he started a teaching career at the Moscow State Film Institute (VGIK). In 1952 Babochkin became artistic director of the Moscow Drama Theater named after Pushkin. There he invited his old director Aleksei Dikiy to direct Shadows, a play by Saltykov-Shchedrin. In Shadows Babochkin played one of his best roles ever ‚Äî Klaverov, a corrupt career politician, resembling a typical Soviet bureaucrat. For this role Babochkin was viciously attacked in the main Soviet newspaper Pravda. His critic was none other than Ekaterina Furtseva, who was then Mayor of Moscow and later was made Minister of Culture of the Soviet Union. Furtseva used all her official power to destroy Babochkin. She banned the play and restricted the world-famous actor, known as Chapayev, from public performances. Furtseva personally ordered that all film studios and drama companies of the USSR should refuse him any jobs, keeping him practically unemployed for three years until he was finally forced to apologize to the Communist Party. Official Soviet censorship, which was under the control of Furtseva, spared no effort in taming the famous actor and manipulating his star power. After that, Babochkin's acting career was restricted to playing only positive, exemplary Soviet characters. Later career Babochkin's acting career was suppressed until the death of his high-ranking Communist opponent Furtseva. The rare exception was his last role in The Flight of Mr. McKinley (1975) for which he was awarded the State Prize of the USSR. From 1955 until his death in 1975, Babochkin was a permanent member of the troupe at the Maly Theatre in Moscow. From 1946 to 1975 he also taught an acting class at State Film Institute (VGIK), where he became a professor in 1966. In his acting career spanning over 55 years, Babochkin played over 200 roles on stage and 25 roles in movies and on television, but his role as Chapayev in the eponymous 1934 film remained the unsurpassed highlight of his film career. Recognition Boris Babochkin was the youngest actor designated People's Artist of Russia (1935). He was awarded the Stalin Prize (twice: in 1941 and 1951) and State Prize of USSR (1977, posthumously). He also received numerous awards and decorations in recognition of his best known film role as Chapaev. Personal life Babochkin was married to Ekaterina Mikhailovna Babochkina (n√©e Georgieva), and the couple had two daughters, Natalia and Tatiana. Outside of his acting career, Babochkin taught a class at Moscow Film School (VGIK); he also wrote numerous articles and critical works about film and theatre. In 1968 he published his autobiography In theatre and film which became a bestseller in the USSR.

Synthesising Italian thought in criminal law since Beccaria, it also had significant influence abroad. As a young politician, Carrara at first followed Mazzini, but came closer to more moderate liberal groups in the 1840s. He helped arrange the accession of Lucca to Tuscany, as he regarded it as a first small step towards national unity. Additionally, he had been totally disgusted from the five sentences to death by guillotine which Charles II, Duke of Parma had allowed in 1845. Not by chance, just to solemnize the annexation of Lucca, Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany abolished the death penalty in his state, as suggested for by Carrara and by some other jurists. After Italian unification, Carrara was elected to Parliament in 1863, 1865 and 1867. There, he was an influential member of the commission preparing the Criminal Code of Italy, the \\"Zanardelli Code\\" completed in 1889. Named a senator in 1879, Carrara died at Lucca, where many of his manuscripts remain.

Ljungby was instituted in 1829 as a k√∂ping, or market town, and did not become a municipality of its own when the first local government acts took effect in 1863, but retained part of the surrounding rural municipality of the same name. In 1936 Ljungby got the title stad, Swedish for Town or City. Since 1971 Ljungby is the seat of Ljungby Municipality. Much of the town center was destroyed in the city fire of 1953. At the time of the rebuilding, the modern style used, characterized by among other Hotel Terazza, still remains controversial locally.  History  Bronze statue by John Lundqvist depicting Astrad and G√∂trad, the first known inhabitants of Ljungby. Tellushuset is one of the few historical buildings that wasn't destroyed in the 1953 fire. The former city center, that existed before the fire, was built in a similar style. international style. The first known inhabitant of the area that is today's Ljungby was Astrad, as can be read on the runestone Repl√∂sastenen from the 11th century located a couple of kilometers from the city center. The runestone says: \\"G√∂trad made this stone after Astrad, the foremost of kinsmen and yeomen (Swedish:odalm√§n) who in Finnveden formerly lived\\". In 1952 a statue by John Lundqvist was erected near the main plaza depicting Astrad and G√∂trad. But there were other people living around Ljungby long before Astrad and G√∂trad as evident by the numerous burial mounds in the area. One of the largest burial mounds lies close to the water tower and is named Kungsh√∂gen. The largest burial is however H√∂ga r√∂r that lies some kilometers south of Ljungby on the slope of the Lagan river valley. In the 12th century the first stone church was built with the formation of the parish Ljungby socken. Ljungby had for a long time been the crossroad where the two important north-south and east-west trade routes met. Because of this a hostelry was built adjacent to the Laganstigen in the 14th century by royal decree. In 1828 Ljungby only consisted by five farms. It was in the beginning of the 19th century the need for a city in Sunnerbo hundred was raised. Ljungby competed with the village Berga, where bishop Henrik had obtained permission to found a city. As Ljungby was considered to be located more central in the hundred and had better road connections, the choice fell on the latter option. According to a royal letter from October 15, 1828 Ljungby was made a frik√∂ping with regulations on March 28, 1829 according to three sources, and on January 1, 1830 according to another. Ljungby was founded mostly on property that was donated by M√§rta Ljungberg, operator of Ljungby's hostelry. A town plan with perpendicular roads was used as base when the town's buildings was planned. The city plan would later be split with the arrival of the railroad. In 1878 the railroad between Vislanda and Bolmen, via Ljungby, was opened. The railroad would later be linked with Karlshamn‚ÄìVislanda‚ÄìBolmens railroad (KVBJ) and Halmstad‚ÄìBolmen Railroad (HBJ). In 1899 the north-south stretch Sk√•ne‚ÄìSm√•lands Railroad (SSJ) was opened. During the 20th century the town expanded with the help of the workshop and wood industry. The first population boom started at the end of the 1940s and culminated in the 1960s. Luckily this coincided with the increased need of work by the growing industry in the urban area with the need of work decreasing in the rural areas. The growth was also supported by the labor immigration that began in the post-war period. The town centre fire of 1953 During the night between 4 and 5 July 1953 a fire started at Gustaf Svenssons Bilverkstad (English: Gustaf Svensson's Garage) by the street Eskilsgatan at block Stj√§rnan. The garage was a wooden building with cans of petrol and oil on the floor. First on site was Ljungby fire department, no more than five minutes after the alarm, and could confirm that the fire had started at the garage. Once the fire had taken hold it continued to spread eastward towards the other wooden buildings in block Stj√§rnan. The fire department had hoped that the street F√∂reningsgatan would work as a fire road, but the wind brought with it sparks and flames, and soon stood parts of block Kometen also ablaze. Next to block Kometen, by the street Kungsgatan, lied Ljungby's Telegraph and Telephone Station, who tried to protect themself behind suspended soaked cloths. The nightstaff could not handle the increased traffic pressure the fire had brought with it and had to call in additional staff, who also had to evacuate archives and machines from the building. The Telegraph and Telephone Station survived the fire after the firefighters managed to extinguished it with foam. In an attempt to gain control over the fire Ljungby called on reinforcement from Hamneda, Angelstad, Ryssby, V√§xj√∂, √Ñlmhult, and Str√∂msn√§sbruk. Police from V√§xj√∂ were also called in to support Ljungby's police force with directing traffic and to prevent people from entering the scene of fire. Due to an error the fire department from Lagan were not summoned. The fire departments' efforts were weakened as only one of the pumps at Ljungby water plant was in operation. The activation of the second pump was delayed as the regular mechanic was on vacation and the subsitiunual mechanic had troubles getting the machinery started. Despite the activation of both pumps at the water plant there were still not enough water to put out the fires. The fire departments had to activate the river pump by Lagan River and pump in untreated raw water into Ljungby's water supply. A wagon with water pipes from the civil defence were also requisitioned. The pipes were laid from the river all the way to the city centre and gave water to five fire hoses. It is said that the pipe ended at the square basin by the statue of Astrad and G√∂trad. At most; nine motor pumps were used with a total capacity of per minute and fire hoses were pulled out and used. Aftermath During the days after the fire it was concluded that floor space had been destroyed and that twenty buildings had been affected by the fire; whereof 28 residential flats, 24 business flats, 12 workshops, and 9 warehouses. Most of the buildings where from the days when Ljungby was just a market town, built before 1936. Thirty families became homeless and 96 people became unemployed. It was estimated that a value of three million kronor had been destroyed by the fire. No person was killed, but seven firefighters had to visit Ljungby hospital; six of them could leave shortly thereafter and one had to stay. As untreated raw water had been pumped in into Ljungby's water supply network from the Lagan River the Health Department issued a request for everyone to boil their water before using it. This was particularly important as there was a high risk that sewage water had entered the water supply and as the deadly salmonella outbreak The Alvesta Epidemic had recently reached its peak. There were rumours that looting had occurred during the fire. However, no reports were received and according to police and firefighters on site all went well, apart for some drunk people who disturbed. There were plans to build huts on the square so that the affected businesses could continue their trade while rebuilding. But many business continued their trade at other temporary premises, which was noticed as only 15 out of the 96 unemployed reported to the Employment Service the following days. The reconstruction of the city centre consisted of buildings and a piazza in a more modern international style. This style is particularly evident in the seven-storey hotel Terraza which replaced the four-story hotel Stadshotellet. The plan was to demolish Stadshotellet in the spring of 1961, but instead it burned down on December 18, 1960.  Administration  Ljungby became a frik√∂ping (or chipping in English) October 15, 1828, with the regulations decided on March 28, 1829. On January 31, 1879 Ljungby chipping's rules and regulations, building bylaws, and the fire charter was issued. On February 10, 1893, it was decided that the health care charter would also apply in the chipping. 1900 the concept municipalsamh√§lle was introduced into Sweden's legislation and Ljungby chipping was transformed into Ljungby k√∂ping municipalsamh√§lle. This was due to the fact that at least one of the town's charters was applied to the area and didn't belong to a stadskommun (approx. town municipality) or k√∂pingskommun (approx. chipping municipality). On July 3, 1902 a special arrangement Charter was issued for Ljungby k√∂ping municipalsamh√§lle. On October 7, 1921 the area of Ljungby municipalsamh√§lle was increased from 0.98 km¬≤ (0.37 mi¬≤) to 3.50 km¬≤ (1.35 mi¬≤). Ljungby was, and is, the \\"church village\\" of Ljungby parish and belonged to Ljungby rural municipality after 1862 Swedish municipal reform. On January 1, 1936 Ljungby parish and rural municipality was reformed into Ljungby stad. This was in accordance to a decision made on September 20, 1935 that gave ljungby the title \\"stad\\" (English: town or city). With 1971 Swedish municipal reforms Ljungby stad and the rural municipality was ascended into Ljungby municipality with Ljungby being the central locality.

The town is also pierced by the scenic route Riksettan. Ljungby has a small airport, Ljungby-Feringe airport, without regular services about 13 kilometers to the northeast. The airport is owned by Feringe Flygklubb and is mostly used by sports planes, gliders, and parachutists. The closest airport with passenger traffic is V√§xj√∂ Sm√•land Airport. There were earlier railroad connections in four directions with narrow-gauge railways towards Halmstad and Vislanda, and standard gauge towards V√§rnamo and Markaryd. These lines are now defunct and the tracks have been removed. Most of the railway embankments have been converted into bicycle paths. The northerly embankment connects Ljungby and Lagan with a 10 kilometer asphalted bicycle path where it connects with the bicycle route Sverigeleden. The west-eastern embankment is part of the 250 kilometer long bike trail Banvallsleden. Business and education Sm√•l√§nningen's head office in central Ljungby.

Once a company logging town, occupied roughly between 1923 and 1938, it lies in northern Colorado near the Wyoming border. Old Roach was built by the Otto Lumber Company for the purpose of railroad logging, or tie hacking. Railroad ties were needed to build and maintain the growing railroad network in the American west, and tie hacks were the loggers who cut the timber and shaped it into railroad ties. Old Roach was an extensive company town which had homes as well as a post office, a store, and a school. It was inhabited from the early 1920s to the 1930s when it was dismantled from the National Forest lands where it was located. All that remains today in this ghost town are a few foundations, and the remains of a wooden flume and splash dam located along nearby Stuck Creek. The splash dam and flume were used to regulate water flows needed to float the new railroad ties down to the Big Laramie River during the annual spring tie drive. The ties were collected in Laramie, Wyoming where the Union Pacific Railroad was located. Old Roach is located on the Roosevelt National Forest. Archaeological exploration of Old Roach is currently being conducted by the U.S. Forest Service through the Passport in Time (PIT) program. The town site was examined and surveyed by Forest Service archaeologists and PIT volunteers in the summer of 2006. The splash dam and Stuck Creek flume were also surveyed and artifacts noted. In 2007, archaeologists expanded the survey to include the search for the remains of Forrester Camp, a satellite logging camp operated by the Otto Lumber Company. This camp was found located about 5 miles southeast of Old Roach. The 2008 field survey resulted in the finding of another satellite logging camp known as \\"Camp 3\\" located about 3 miles west of Old Roach. Another satellite camp known as East Beaver Creek was located and recorded during the 2009 field survey. East Beaver Camp is about five miles northwest of Old Roach. Several other satellite camps of the Otto Lumber company remain in the forest and hope to be located and recorded in future years.

The fullscale aircraft, named DP-2, was designed to travel at high subsonic speeds with a greater range than its rotary-wing equivalent, and to allow troops to rappel from the aft cargo ramp. The development of the 53% scale DP-1 aircraft was originally funded in the early 1990s as a backup to the V-22 Osprey program, which was undergoing significant technical and political challenges. During the construction of the test aircraft, program management changed the requirements, and mandated that the vehicle be tested as a UAV. This change added significant cost and time to the project, but in September 2007, the DP-1 autonomous prototype achieved sustained, controlled tethered hovers of 45 seconds at the Gillespie Field test site. On June 13, 2007, the U.S. House Committee on Science and Technology held a hearing about the fate of the DP-2. In August 2007, funding was finally cut, after a total of $63 million spent over nearly two decades.

Biography Beginning Sarlanga He was born in Tigre, Buenos Aires Province in 1916. He started playing football in local clubs Defensor and Sportivo Delta, and then joined Tigre where he played in the youth divisions until his debut in Primera Divisi√≥n in 1935 vs. Independiente. He played with Tigre for two seasons, until 1937 when he joined Ferro Carril Oeste, where he formed a powerful group of forwards along with Bernardo Gandulla, Ra√∫l Emeal, Juan J. Maril and Luis Brognia. Sarlanga's elegant playing style soon caught the attention of fans and media, also remarking his skills as playmaker. In Ferro Sarlanga scored a total of 47 goals. As of present days, Sarlanga ranks 12th. amongst Ferro's 12 all-time topscorers. Boca Juniors Sarlanga was traded Boca Juniors in 1940, making his debut on August 18 in a match vs. Tigre (Boca won by 3‚Äì2), achieving a league title that same year. With the addition of Ferro's former partners Emeal and Gandulla, Boca would dispute the first places with Club Atl√©tico River Plate's La M√°quina during the 1940s. Sarlanga was part of the attacking line along with Mario Boy√©, P√≠o Corcuera, Severino Varela and S√°nchez. That team was highly praised and still remembered as one of Boca Juniors' best teams ever. Sarlanga was topscorer for the team for 4 consecutive seasons from 1940 to 1943. On April 6, 1941, Sarlanga scored 6 goals in the 7‚Äì2 victory over Atlanta. In the last match against Ferro, Sarlanga scored 2 goals, giving Boca Juniors the victory that allowed the team to crown champion of the season. In 1940 Sarlanga joined Boca Juniors, with which he won 3 league titles and 4 national cups. Sarlanga left the club in 1948, joining Gimnasia y Esgrima (LP) where he played until his retirement in 1950 at 34 years old.Jaime Sarlanga bio on F√∫tbol Factory (Archive) In 1955 Sarlanga became Boca Juniors manager, replacing other historic player, Ernesto Lazzatti.

The index was launched in June 2005 and is the first comprehensive global local Emerging Markets index. As Emerging Market governments look increasingly toward their domestic market for sources of finance, investors are looking more closely at local markets in search for higher yield and greater diversification. As external debt spreads compress and opportunities seem more appealing in local rates, the likely combination of increasing demand and supply will pave the way for deeper and broader local markets, which the GBI-EM will attempt to capture. The launch of the GBI-EM was followed by the Diversified versions for GBI-EM and GBI-EM BROAD in January 2006. The GBI-EM GLOBAL, launched in November 2006, is the latest addition to the GBI-EM family of indices, providing a readily investable version of the GBI-EM BROAD by excluding China and India. The GBI-EM indices is composed of only those countries from the GBI universe that meet criteria for an Emerging Market, resulting in 18 countries from four regions. The regional sub-division of the indices consists of Asia, Europe, Latin America, and Middle East/Africa.  Index suite  GBI-EM Broad GBI-EM Broad is the all-encompassing index. It includes all eligible countries regardless of capital controls and/or regulatory and tax hurdles for foreign investors. As of November 2013 the following 18 emerging market economies were part of the GBI-EM Broad index: Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Romania, Russia, South Africa, Thailand, and Turkey. JP Morgan announced that Nigeria will be phased out of the index over a 2 month period effective September 30, 2015. Nigeria was placed on Index Watch in January following a series of administrative measures by the Central Bank of Nigeria that impeded the ability of foreign investors to access the FX market. GBI-EM Global GBI-EM Global is an investable benchmark that includes only those countries that are directly accessible by most of the international investor base. The GBI-EM GLOBAL excludes countries with explicit capital controls, but does not factor in regulatory/tax hurdles in assessing eligibility. Specifically, it includes all GBI-EM countries, as well as the Brazil NTN-F, LTN, and the Colombia local TES tasa fija bond. Classified as the most investable of all three indices, the GBI-EM GLOBAL is effectively the GBI-EM Broad excluding China and India. Although the following restriction may exist, it will not result in country exclusion: Registration of the foreign investor with the local supervisory authorities or notification of transactions is not considered a significant restriction. GBI-EM GBI-EM, referred to as the replicable or narrow series, is the most restrictive series. It limits inclusion to only those countries that are readily accessible and where no impediments exist for foreign investors. As of November 2013 the GBI-EM is effectively the GBI-EM Global excluding Indonesia and Thailand (or the GBI-EM Broad excluding China, India, Indonesia, and Thailand).

Molecular drive operates independently of natural selection and genetic drift. The best-known such process is the concerted evolution of genes present in many tandem copies, such as those for ribosomal RNAs or silk moth egg shell chorion proteins, in sexually reproducing species. The concept has been proposed to extend to the diversification of multigene families. The mechanisms involved include gene conversion, unequal crossing-over, transposition, slippage replication and RNA-mediated exchanges. Because mutations changing the sequence of one copy are less common than deletions, duplications and replacement of one copy by another, the copies gradually come to resemble each other much more than they would if they had been evolving independently. Concerted evolution can be unbiased, in which case every version has an equal probability of being the one that replaces the others. However, if the molecular events have any bias favouring one version of the sequence over others, that version will dominate the process and eventually replace the others. The name 'molecular drive' reflects the similarity of the process with what was originally the better- known process of meiotic drive. Molecular drive can also act in bacteria, where parasexual processes such as natural transformation cause DNA turnover.  TRAM  According to Dover, TRAM is a genetic system that has features of non-mendelian inheritance Turnover, copy number and functional Redundancy And Modulatory. To date all regulatory regions (promoters) and genes that have been examined in detail at the molecular level, have TRAM characteristics.

Life  Anton Romako was born in Atzgersdorf (now a district of Liesing, Vienna), as an illegitimate son of factory owner Josef Lepper and his Czech housemaid Elisabeth Maria Anna Romako (Rhomako, Romakho, n√©e '). He studied painting at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna (1847‚Äì49) but his teacher, Ferdinand Georg Waldm√ºller, considered him talentless. Later, he studied in Munich (1849) under Wilhelm Kaulbach, and subsequently in Venice, Rome and London. In the early 1850s he studied privately in Vienna under Carl Rahl, whose style Romako adopted. In 1854 he began travels to Italy and Spain and in 1857 settled in Rome as the favourite portrait, genre, and landscape painter for the local colony of foreigners. In 1862 Romako married Sophie K√∂bel, the daughter of architect Karl K√∂bel, and the pair had five children before Sophie left Romako in 1875 for her lover. In 1876 Romako returned to Vienna but failed to re- establish himself against the style represented by Hans Makart and increasingly relied on the charity of such wealthy patrons as Count Kuefstein. He made study trips to Hungary, Italy and France, and during the years 1882 to 1884 he alternated between Paris and Geneva. Two daughters, Mathilde and Mary, committed suicide in 1887; Romako never recovered from the shock. His last years were spent living in neglect near Vienna, where he died in poverty in 1889. Romako was buried at the Central cemetery in Vienna. In 1953 a street in Atzgersdorf was named after the painter: Romakogasse. Anton Romako's painting The Battle of Lissa was selected as a motive for a recent commemorative coin: the 20 euro S.M.S. Erzherzog Ferdinand Max minted on September 15, 2004. His brother, Josef von Romako, was a Naval Architect-Inspector of Austro-Hungarian Navy. Works Romako painted a large number of landscape scenes (for example from the Bad Gastein), influenced by the Barbizon school, but is known mostly for his portraits and historical scenes. His early works display the influence of Biedermeier realism, while the late works are painted in a nervous expressionist style which disturbed his contemporaries. More than a decade passed before his works were reconsidered and appreciated. Nowadays Romako is seen as one of the most interesting and trailblazing artists of the \\"Ringstra√üenepoche\\" era. He was impressed by the young Oscar Kokoschka and had a great influence on his work. Many paintings of Anton Romako are shown in the Belvedere gallery in Vienna. His famous portrait of empress Elisabeth, showing her eccentric personality, was generally rejected at the time. His best-known work, the portrait of Admiral Wilhelm von Tegetthoff during the naval Battle of Lissa, shows the admiral and a few sailors without the usual heroism at the moment when his ship Ferdinand Max is going to ram an Italian flagship.

River Commerce Beginning in 1642, Souppes became a stop on the water route between Orl√©ans and Paris. In 1604 Henry IV of France had begun a canal project to connect Orleans with the capital. Boats and barges were able to travel from Orl√©ans to Montargis on the Loire River the Canal of Briare, but then had to be hauled, pulled by horses, up the Loing River as far as the Seine. To eliminate this difficult leg of the journey, the Loing Canal, parallel to the river, was built by the Royal Marine Regiment. It was completed in 1724 under Louis XV. The port of Souppes, on the canal, became an important shipping point for local products to Paris. Souppes in the French Revolution The local priest of Souppes, Anne Alexander Marie Thibault, played a small but notable role in the French Revolution. He was elected to represent the clergy of the region at the meeting of the Estates-General of 1789. He was very active in the meeting, and, although he was not actually present for the tennis court oath which began the Revolution, Jacques-Louis David included his portrait in the famous painting of the event. The residents of the town did not suffer greatly from the Terror, but the Revolution had a dramatic effect on the town. The church was turned into a granary from 1793 to 1795. The church of Boulay was stripped of its decoration and shut, and the Abbey was closed and sold as a national property. The Abbey church was torn down, and the other buildings were turned into a paper factory. File:Le Serment du Jeu de paume.jpg|The cur√© or local priest of Souppes was a delegate to the Estates-General of 1789, and was included in the famous painting of the event by Jacques-Louis David, though he was not actually present. 19th and 20th century - the stone of Souppes The first industry established in Souppes was a mill and workshop for making steel, built by the river in 1773. The workshop is gone, but the channel of water used for the mill can still be seen. A refinery for making sugar out of sugar beets was opened in 1873, and, rebuilt and modernized, is still in operation. The main industry of Souppes in the 19th century was the quarrying of creamy white building stones for the buildings and monuments of Paris. The layer of white stone crosses the Souppes Valley from east to west, and the local stone had been used for centuries; the presence of a quarry at l'Endurcy is recorded in 1750. With the completion of the canal linking Souppes with the Seine and with Paris, providing building stone for Paris buildings and monuments became a major activity of the town. The Arc de Triomphe was built of stone from the quarry at Chateau-Landon, south of Souppes. The stone for the statue of Saint Genevieve and the Pont de la Tournelle (1928) on which it stands both came from the quarry of Souppes. All of the quarries of the valley were engaged in providing stone for the Basilica of Sacr√© Coeur on Montmartre at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century. The quarries were a major industry until the 1950s. Two quarries are still active.

Souppes in the Second World War Souppes played a small but important part in the liberation of France during the Second World War. in August 1944, the U.S. Third Army, led By General George Patton, had circled around the German lines in Normandy and was racing toward the gap between Paris and Orleans. Orleans was liberated on August 16, the lower Seine was crossed at Mantes on the 19th, and on August 19 General Eisenhower gave orders for the Third Army to reach the upper Seine River south of Paris. On the same day, an uprising by the French resistance began in Paris. The objective of the 4th Armored Division was to cross the Loing River at Montargis, fifteen miles south of Souppes. and get as far as town of Sens, on the Yonne River. However, Hitler had given orders to strongly defend the town of Montargis. When the 4th Division reached Montargis, they found the Germans were there in force and that the bridges over the Loing had been destroyed. A U.S. reconnaissance team discovered that the bridge over the Loing at Souppes had been damaged but was still usable. The 4th Division and the 137th Infantry regiment of the 35th Division crossed the bridge on August 21 and sped to Sens, where they took the Germans completely by surprise. German officers in parade uniform were strolling in the park. By the 24th the Third Army had reached the upper Seine and established four bridgeheads on the other side. On June 25 U.S. and Free French forces entered the center of Paris, and the German forces in the city surrendered.Martin Blumenson, The U.S. Army in World War II - European Theater of Operations- Breakout and Pursuit (1961), Center of Military History, U.S. Army, Washington DC (Online Edition).  Floods  The widespread flooding of Ile-de-France in June 2016 was devastating for Souppes. The town center was inundated with water, waist- deep in places, forcing roughly 800 residents to flee and forcing closure of many businesses. Almost a year later, in May 2017, many shops remained closed. A group of flood victims instigated a claim for damages against the organization that operates the canal system in France, the VNF, accusing it of mismanagement of the Canals du Loing and de Briare, and failure to protect Souppes and other towns along the Loing.

She became known in the broadcast industry in the 1980s for her age and sexual discrimination lawsuit against a television station that had demoted her from news anchor to reporter.  Early life  Craft was born on December 18, 1944 in Canton, Ohio.CHRISTINE CRAFT: REPORTER OR SYMBOL OR BOTH?United States Public Records, 1970-2009 (California, 1986-2000) Her parents were Willard A. Craft, a high school administrator and Christine A. Leininger, an actress.Chris Craft's Big Wave After graduating from college with a degree in English in 1966, she spent time as a classroom teacher and competitive surfer in the Santa Barbara area.  TV career  In 1974, Craft took a position as a weather reporter at KSBW- TV in Salinas, California. While working for KSBW, she served in a variety of reporting roles, including news reporting and sports. She then moved from KSBW to the CBS affiliate, KPIX-TV, in San Francisco where she continued working as an \\"all around\\" reporter. In 1977, CBS hired Craft to do the weekly segment, \\"Women in Sports\\", for the CBS Sports Spectacular. As part of her on-air reporting, she was required by CBS to undergo a make-over which included having her hair bleached platinum blonde; Craft later stated that she hated the experience. After a year at CBS, Craft returned to California where she again worked in several news positions, including a stint as co-anchor for Santa Barbara's ABC affiliate, KEYT-TV. Craft continued with KEYT for several years before moving to Kansas City to work for the then-Metromedia-owned ABC affiliate, KMBC-TV. Craft claims that unbeknownst to her, a media consulting company produced a tape of her and had it shopped around to several stations throughout the country, including KMBC. As a result of this exposure, executives at KMBC requested Craft come to Kansas City for an interview; following the interview, she was hired. Craft states that at the time of her hiring she told the station management she \\"showed signs of her age and experience\\", and after the experience with CBS, was not willing to once again be \\"made over\\".  Lawsuit  In January 1981 Craft became co-anchor with Scott Feldman on the 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. newscast on KMBC-TV. Following the addition of Craft to the news program, the station's newscasts went from third to first in the ratings. Eight months into her two-year contract, Craft was removed from the anchor position in August 1981 after a focus group had determined she was \\"too old, too unattractive and wouldn't defer to men.\\" At that time there was only one woman over the age of forty anchoring a newscast at a network affiliate in the United States. Craft refused to accept the demotion, and went public with her disagreement with the station through an interview in a local newspaper. She left KMBC and returned to doing television in Santa Barbara. While working in Santa Barbara, Craft filed a Title VII lawsuit against Metromedia, and in 1983, a federal jury in Kansas City awarded her $500,000 in damages. A federal judge overturned the award and ordered a second trial, this time in Joplin, Missouri. The second jury also awarded her $500,000. Metromedia appealed and the 8th Circuit Court subsequently overturned the decision. Craft's appeal of that decision to the United States Supreme Court was denied, although Supreme Court Judge Sandra Day O'Connor did write in favor of hearing the case. Several employment-law references include her case as an example of Title VII discrimination lawsuits.  Authorship, law school and talk-radio  In 1986, she published her semi-autobiographical book, \\"Too Old, Too Ugly, Not Deferential to Men\\". Craft continued doing television, anchoring the news at KRBK in Sacramento where she was also managing editor and went on to do television programs for San Francisco's KQED. Craft then went to law school, graduating in 1995 from the University of the Pacific's McGeorge School of Law, passing the California Bar exam that same year. It was during her studies in law school when Craft first started working in talk-radio, hosting a program at KFBK, in Sacramento.  Current life  In the Fall of 2007, Craft left her hosting duties at KSAC in Sacramento after a failure to reach a new contract agreement with the station manager. Currently, Craft is a fill-in talk radio host at KGO in San Francisco and practices worker's compensation and employment law at the law offices of Farrell, Fraulob and Brown in Sacramento. She also performs work in the animal abuse field pro-bono and argues for stronger statutes against such crimes. She has lectured at colleges, universities and law schools about Title VII litigation (the Civil Rights Act of 1964) and her media experiences. Her story was featured in an exhibit at the Newseum, an interactive museum of news and journalism located in Washington, D.C.

The film was awarded the C√©sar Award for Best Editing, and was nominated for Best Film, Best Actor and Best Writing.  Plot  Pierre Losseray is a surgeon at the public hospital in a small provincial town in France (Clermont-Ferrand). He has recently suffered a heart attack but has returned to work. He is appreciated by his patients, and is being harassed by Old Br√©z√©, the owner of a nearby medical clinic, who is losing clients and cannot stand competition. In league with his sons and son-in-law, Br√©z√© uses insinuations close to blackmail. Losseray also learns about the story of Doctor Jean-Pierre Berg, another surgeon with a very different lifestyle from Losseray, who was similarly hassled by the same man fifteen years before. He becomes obsessed with it as he discovers what it was about. Berg had killed his three children, his wife and finally himself, apparently when under such pressure; however the real reason of why he did that remains unclear : he had much charisma, a Boston University diploma, an excellent reputation, a charming wife, and was even about to launch his own private clinic. Losseray, though being constantly bugged by Br√©z√©, gets information - sometimes contradictory - by bits and pieces, becomes more and more obsessed with it and the Br√©z√© clan, and finally understands what really happened. He eventually shares the same fate as Berg. Seemingly without concern, the Br√©z√© clan continue with their nefarious activities. A major role is held by Mathy, a psychiatrist who happens to know, because of his social relations, all the clues about the former story, but gives them reluctantly because he wants to be in good terms with everybody.

Yorke worked as a medium for many years from Forest Gate, east London. She was prosecuted by police in 1944 because of claims she was defrauding the public by exploiting wartime fears. During s√©ances with Yorke, undercover police were told to ask about non-existent family members. Yorke provided elaborate details on them which she claimed had been provided by her spirit guide such as telling an officer that his non-existent brother had been burned alive on a bombing mission. Yorke‚Äôs alleged spirit guide was a Zulu and she also frequently claimed to summon Queen Victoria. She was witnessed terrifying a hysterical woman who said she had seen the spirit of her dead brother, by warning her that her husband might also be killed. Yorke predicted that the Second World War would end in October 1944. She was arrested in July 1944. At her trial in September at London's Central Criminal Court, she was found guilty on seven counts against the Witchcraft Act of 1735. Yorke was fined ¬£5 and placed on good behaviour for three years, promising she would hold no more s√©ances. The light sentence was due to her age of 72. Yorke's case demonstrated that, following the earlier trial of Helen Duncan, the Director of Public Prosecutions had decided that the Witchcraft Act was still useful in dealing with cases involving mediums. Although the Act was used as a threat in several subsequent cases, the last in 1950, this was the last in which someone was actually convicted under it.

Other authorities place it in the genus Pulsatilla. Individuals are tall, from caudices, with three to six leaves at the base of the plant that are 3-foliolate, each leaflet pinnatifid to dissected in shape. Leaf petioles are long. Leaves have villous hairs and their margins are pinnatifid or dissected. Plants flower briefly mid-spring to mid-summer, usually soon after the ground is exposed by melting snow. The flowers are composed of five to seven sepals (sometimes called tepals), normally white or soft purple, also mixed white and blueish purple, one flower per stem. The sepals are long and wide. Flowers have 150‚Äì200 stamens. The fruit occurs in heads rounded to subcylindric in shape, with pedicels long. The achenes are ellipsoid in shape, not winged, covered with villous hairs, with beaks curved that reflex as they age and long, feather-like. Generally, the fruit persists into fall. Native to far western North America including British Columbia to California and Montana, it is found growing in gravelly soils on slopes and in moist meadows. Chemistry Western pasqueflower likely contains ranunculin and protoanemonin, an irritant glycoside and its aglycone, as these are seen in most members of this genus and the plant's latex is irritating. It can be fatal to domestic animals, particularly to sheep, and should thus not be eaten by humans. Traditional medicine The fresh stems and seeds of the plant are used traditionally in North America as analgesics, anxiolytics, and sedatives.

DeVecchio worked for the FBI during the Mafia wars in New York during the 1980s and 1990s, eventually rising to head of the FBI squad responsible for surveillance of the Colombo crime family. He was also responsible for handling Gregory Scarpa, a Colombo capo who had secretly been an FBI informant since the 1960s.Raab, Selwyn. The Five Families: The Rise, Decline & Resurgence of America's Most Powerful Mafia Empire. New York: St. Martins Press, 2005. Connection to Gregory Scarpa racketeering trial After Scarpa pleaded guilty to racketeering charges in 1993, former Colombo consigliere Carmine Sessa, who had recently turned informer, tipped off prosecutors about Scarpa's unusual relationship with DeVecchio. Eventually, prosecutors uncovered circumstantial evidence that DeVecchio had leaked confidential information to Scarpa on numerous occasions. Reportedly, DeVecchio had told Scarpa about several former Colombo members who had turned informer. He was suspected of alerting Scarpa that he was being bugged, and that his son was about to be arrested for drug trafficking. Evidence allegedly surfaced that DeVecchio had given Scarpa tips on how to track down soldiers backing Victor Orena's effort to take over the Colombo family during the Third Colombo War (1991‚Äì93); Scarpa sided with longtime boss Carmine Persico. DeVecchio is believed to be the first FBI agent accused of helping a mobster commit crimes and cover them up. The FBI conducted a two-year internal probe, but ultimately decided not to press charges against DeVecchio. Nonetheless, his reputation was affected, and he retired in 1996. Although DeVecchio was cleared of wrongdoing by his superiors, 19 soldiers from the Orena faction had their convictions reversed or charges thrown out after their lawyers contended DeVecchio's actions cast doubt on the evidence against them. The lawyers contended that DeVecchio actively helped Scarpa hunt down and kill opponents, thus making many of the deaths caused by their clients acts of self-defense. They contended DeVecchio had manufactured evidence. In 2006, Brooklyn district attorney Charles Hynes indicted DeVecchio on charges that he'd helped Scarpa kill four people in the 1980s and early 1990s through supplying confidential FBI information about them. The case was based almost entirely on the testimony of Scarpa's longtime girlfriend, Linda Schiro. However, the case imploded in the fall of 2007 when Tom Robbins of The Village Voice came forward with an interview he and mob expert Jerry Capeci had conducted with Schiro in 1997, in which Schiro denied that DeVecchio had been involved in most of the murders. Robbins and Capeci had interviewed Schiro for a book they had initially planned to write, and had promised Schiro that her revelations would not appear in a news article or be attributed to her. However, Robbins said, the prospect of DeVecchio facing life in prison trumped any promises they had made to Schiro. This forced prosecutors to move for a dismissal of charges against DeVecchio, which was granted on 1 November 2007. A retired judge was appointed special prosecutor in 2008 to examine whether Scarpa's former girlfriend, Linda Schiro, had committed perjury but his report concluded that her interview tape wasn't enough to prove perjury.

It is located on the shores of the Binnenbedijkte Maas (Lake Binnenmaas), about 14 km south of the city of Rotterdam, in the municipality of Hoeksche Waard.Wet samenvoeging gemeenten Binnenmaas, Cromstrijen, Korendijk, Oud-Beijerland en Strijen, 11 July 2018, accessed at overheid.nl It was the only village in the former municipality Binnenmaas not built next to a dyke. The main street of Mijnsheerenland is the Raadhuislaan. This street used to be dominated by farmhouses, but in recent years many of them were demolished and replaced by modern homes as Mijnsheerenland became preferred by upmarket house buyers.  History  After the St. Elizabeth's flood the former land of Schobbe en Everocken was re-dyked in 1437-1438 by the knight Lodewijk Praet of Moerkerken; therefore, the village is often called Mijnsheerenland van Moerkerken. The name of the village (meaning My Lord's Land in English) doesn't have a religious background but states the factual situation of the land belonging to its Lord, Praet of Moerkerken.  Sights  Laurentius church Lake Binnenmaas Hof van Moerkerken Next to the centre of the village lies the Hof van Moerkerken, a medieval buitenplaats on which an 18th-century mansion is located. The Hof van Moerkerken was where the Lord of the Manor lived. The Dutch writer Frederik van Eeden lived on the Hof van Moerkerken in the 19th century. His famous novel Van de koele meren des doods was written there, and it was the filming location for the 1982 Dutch movie based on the novel. The Hof is privately owned and therefore not accessible to the public; its garden, however, is open to the public on Open Monument Day. Hof van Moerkerken, Doehits. Laurentius Church The Laurentius Church is a gothic church built in 1445, and is located in the middle of the village. The gothic architectural style is unusual for the Hoeksche Waard. Windmills There are two windmills in the village area: the grist mill De Goede Hoop (somewhat hidden within the village), and the post mill Oostmolen outside the core village of Mijnsheerenland. The latter is a drainage mill, and was used until 1948 for draining water from the Moerkerken polder. Lake Binnenmaas Lake Binnenmaas is a lake to the south of Mijnsheerenland, providing a small beach and a yachting club located near the village.

It is eaten whole, with both the seeds and the pod, while still unripe.  Names  The common name snow pea seems to be a misnomer as the planting season of this pea is no earlier than that of other peas. Another common name Chinese pea is probably related to its prominence in Chinese dishes served in the West. Its French name is pois mangetout (\\"eat-all pea\\") but this can apply both to snow peas and to snap peas. Snow peas and snap peas both belong to Macrocarpon Group, a cultivar group based on the variety Pisum sativum var. macrocarpum Ser. named in 1825. It was described as having very compressed non-leathery edible pods in the original publication. The scientific name Pisum sativum var. saccharatum Ser. is often misused for snow peas. The variety under this name was described as having sub-leathery and compressed-terete pods and a French name of petit pois. The description is inconsistent with the appearance of snow peas, and therefore botanists have replace this name with Pisum sativum var. macrocarpum. Austrian scientist and monk Gregor Mendel used peas which he called Pisum saccharatum in his famous experiments demonstrating the heritable nature of specific traits, and this Latin name might not refer to the same varieties identified with modern snow peas.  As food  Snow peas, along with sugar snap peas and unlike field and garden peas, are notable for having edible pods that lack inedible fiber (in the form of \\"parchment\\", a fibrous layer found in the inner pod rich in lignin) in the pod walls. Snow peas have the thinner walls of the two edible pod variants. Two recessive genes known as p and v are responsible for this trait. p is responsible for reducing the schlerenchymatous membrane on the inner pod wall, while v reduces pod wall thickness (n is a gene that thickens pod walls in snap peas). The stems and leaves of the immature plant are used as a vegetable in Chinese cooking, stir-fried with garlic and sometimes combined with crab or other shellfish.  As nitrogen fixers  As with most legumes, snow peas host beneficial bacteria, rhizobia, in their root nodules, which fix nitrogen in the soil‚Äîthis is called a mutualistic relationship‚Äîand are therefore a useful companion plant, especially useful to grow intercropped with green, leafy vegetables that benefit from high nitrogen content in their soil.  Cultivation and storage  Snow peas can be grown in open fields during cool seasons and can thus be cultivated during winter and spring seasons. Storage of the pea with films of polymethylpentene at a temperature of 5 ¬∞C and a concentration of oxygen and carbon dioxide of 5 kPa augments the shelf life, internal and external characteristics of the plant. Cultivars Below is a list of several snow pea cultivars currently available, ordered by days to maturity.

After harvesting, the grapes are disposed in especially designed bottles, filled with water and a charcoal piece, and stored over a period of several months in wine caves or cellars built inside the local houses. This technique allows the grapes to be sold after the Christmas season even as late as Easter with perfectly naturally preserved fruits. This tradition has been extremely popular in from 19th century to World War II, and was destinated to rich tables in Paris (grapes were sold at Fauchon) and beyond (the Russian Csar court was also delivered).

The name refers to the condition used to designate normal peacetime military readiness under the DEFCON system, but which is commonly misused in popular fiction to indicate a state of emergency. The game was originally announced under the title Incoming. The main lobby of the Admin block. Tyron corporate logo can be seen on the right. Storyline As a \\"cyberneer\\" working for the fictional Tyron Corporation, the player is tasked with installing an automated defence software at the deep space mining installation named MRP-6F, a large compound located around the top of a crater in which mining operations take place. Its purpose is to defend the mining installation from hostile attack. For this purpose the installation houses six powerful defence turrets installed around the crater, as well as a myriad of support systems for power generation and munitions stores for those armaments. Shortly after his/her arrival at MRP-6F the installation is attacked by an unknown enemy force. The player must face enemy fighters as well as invaders searching the base. The overall goal is to escape the installation with evidence of what has transpired. Facing an enemy intruder in the munitions storage. Gameplay The game is reminiscent of the System Shock series in terms of gameplay. The player must explore the base to find items which is needed to establish a line of defence and ultimately escape the installation. This involves fighting off the invading enemies by deploying the defence turrets effectively and using the installation's computer terminals (called \\"VOS terminals\\") to hinder the intruder's advance. The computer terminals in the game offer an unusual wide range of interaction. Players can use them to remotely control the defence turrets, load ammunition and inspect the turrets for damage and deploy combat droids within the installation's perimeters.

The game also allows the player to fight the invaders by shooting them, but this is discouraged by the fact that new enemies arrive with each passing wave of attacking ships. Also, destroying an enemy greatly degrades the air quality in the immediate area. The computer might even seal doors to polluted areas, sometimes trapping the player. The player can dissolve the pollution by opening doors to adjacent areas, and the pollution levels can be monitored in the VOS terminal's environmental module.'

The installation consists of two major towers with seven floors each (the administrative and domestic blocks), three hangars, a service level, six turrets and a control room. All these are linked by a subway-train like transportation system named \\"LIMO\\". Several elevator systems also connect the different levels. This complex layout enables players to avoid enemies by choosing an alternate route to their destination. Reception Reviewing the PlayStation version, Bro' Buzz of GamePro summarised Defcon 5 as \\"tough, slow, and epic.\\" While he remarked that the first-person shooting is very mundane in both gameplay and graphics, and that the game in general would not appeal to impatient gamers, he highly recommended it to strategy enthusiasts due to its innovative VOS interface, well-animated cinematic sequences, and steep, intelligent challenge. Maximum strenuously objected to the game's intellectual pace, arguing that the game's FMV intro leads the player to expect much more shooting action than the game delivers. IGN gave it a 7/10, praising the suspenseful plot, enjoyable action, and realistic, immersive details put into the gameplay.(21 November 1996). PlayStation version review, IGN. Next Generation emphatically agreed on all IGN's points, particularly the last, remarking that \\"What really elevates this above its 'like Doom, but' brethren are the little things, none of which, on their own, are that remarkable, but which, taken together, add up to serious fun.\\" Reviewing the Saturn version, the four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly criticised the pixelation in the graphics but praised the game's story-driven approach, well-designed controls, and combination of puzzle solving, strategy, and action. Sega Saturn Magazine, however, panned the Saturn version, citing poor graphics, a lack of clear objectives, and an overabundance of time spent walking from one place to another. They concluded \\"This isn't even a poor rip-off of Doom.\\" GamePros Johnny Ballgame acknowledged the game's originality but ultimately felt that the slow, intellectual pacing was not enjoyable: \\"You spend most of the time wandering around empty corridors, and after a while you wish the aliens would board the ship so you'd have something to do.\\" Compatibility Defcon5 has been listed as \\"supported\\" on the DOSBOX website since version 0.61 of the emulator software. The fact that it uses CD audio can however be a problem.

Born in Staples Road, Loughton, Essex, the youngest of four daughters, she was raised in Bognor Regis, a seaside resort in West Sussex, England, where she attended a convent school. She left school aged 15 to pursue a career in hairdressing. Harmer's first experience in the aviation industry was five years later when she left hairdressing to become an air traffic controller at London Gatwick Airport. When she took on the job of air traffic controller Harmer decided to study for A Levels with the intention of doing a law degree. She obtained A levels in Geography, English Law, Constitutional Law and Politics. She also began flying lessons, gained her Private Pilot Licence (PPL) and became an instructor at Goodwood Flying School. Harmer studied for two years to gain a Commercial Pilot Licence (CPL), which she obtained in May 1982. She then made over 100 applications before securing a job as pilot at Genair, a small commuter airline based at Humberside Airport. In March 1984, Harmer joined British Caledonian and flew BAC One-Elevens for three years. She then started flying the long haul McDonnell Douglas DC-10. In 1987, British Caledonian merged with British Airways, the airline operating Concorde in the UK. At that time, British Airways employed over 3000 pilots, but only 60 of them were women and no woman had ever piloted Concorde. Harmer was chosen to undergo the intensive six- month conversion course for Concorde in 1992. On 25 March 1993 Harmer became the first qualified female Concorde pilot and later that year made her first Concorde flight as First Officer to New York City's John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK). Jacqueline Auriol was the first woman to fly Concorde as a test pilot. By the time Concorde was withdrawn from service in October 2003, Harmer had served 10 years as a pilot flying regular scheduled services. In 2001, an Air France pilot, B√©atrice Vialle, had become the second of only two women to fly Concorde on regular routes by making some 35 trips between Paris and New York before the service was withdrawn. After Concorde, Harmer converted to the Boeing 777 until taking voluntary redundancy in 2009. Harmer's interests were not all in the air as she was a qualified commercial yachtmaster, often taking part in international events commanding fellow Concorde crew members and winning several races. She also created a Mediterranean-styled garden at her home in Felpham, West Sussex overlooking the English Channel. Harmer intended to take part in a transatlantic event in 2013 in her yacht Archambault 35 but succumbed to cancer. She died at St. Wilfrid's Hospice, Chichester, aged 57.

Originally developed by IBM Research, STEM is a framework and development tool designed to help scientists create and use spatial and temporal models of infectious disease. STEM uses a component software architecture based on the OSGi standard. The Eclipse Equinox platform is a reference implementation of that standard. By using a component software architecture, all of the components or elements required for a disease model, including the code and the data are available as software building blocks that can be independently exchanged, extended, reused, or replaced. These building blocks or plug-ins are called eclipse \\"plug-ins\\" or \\"extensions\\". STEM plug- ins contain denominator data for administrative regions of interest. The regions are indexed by standard (ISO3166) codes. STEM currently includes a large number of plug-ins for the 244 countries and dependent areas defined by the Geographic Coding Standard maintained by the International Organization for Standardization. These plug-ins contain global data including geographic data, population data, demographics, and basic models of disease. The disease models distributed with STEM include epidemiological compartment models. Other plug-ins describe relationships between regions including nearest-neighbor or adjacency relationships as well as information about transportation, such as connections by roads and a model of air transportation. Relationships between regions can then be included in models of how a disease spreads from place to place. To accomplish this, STEM represents the world as a \\"graph\\". The nodes in the graph correspond to places or regions, and the edges in the graph describe relationships or connections between regions. Both the nodes and the edges can be labeled or \\"decorated\\" with a variety of denominator data and models. This graphical representation is implemented using the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF). Since a model can be built up using separate subgraphs, STEM enables model composition. Predefined subgraphs defining different countries can be assembled with a drag and drop interface. New disease vectors can simply be added to existing models by augmenting the model with a new set of edges. The architecture also supports collaboration as users can not only create new models and compose new scenarios but also exchange these models and scenarios as reusable components and thereby build on each other's work. As an open source project, users are encouraged to create their own plug-ins (both data and models) and, if appropriate, to contribute their work back to the project.

With the success of Dikiy's directorship Habima became established as a national Jewish theatre, and Dikiy gained an international reputation as an innovative director. Repressions In 1931, back in Moscow, Dikiy started his own theater-studio in Moscow and also taught an acting class. In 1934 Dikiy collaborated with Dmitri Shostakovich on production of the opera Katerina Izmailova (a.k.a. Lady Makbeth of Mtsensk District). Dikiy's production of Katerina Izmailova had over 100 performances in Leningrad and Moscow, and was considered a highlight of his directing career. However, in 1936, Joseph Stalin saw the opera and severely criticized the work of both Dmitri Shostakovich and Dikiy. After Stalin's criticisms both Shostakovich and Dikiy suffered from serious troubles in their lives and careers. Leningrad In 1936, Dikiy was ordered out of Moscow, then he was appointed the director of the Bolshoi Drama Theater (BDT) in Leningrad. There he began his lifelong collaboration and friendship with actor Boris Babochkin. At that time many Russian intellectuals were terrorized by purges and repressions, known as the \\"Great Terror\\" under the dictatorship of Joseph Stalin. In 1937 Aleksei Dikiy was arrested on false accusations of anti-Soviet activity. In reality he was a victim of behind-the-scenes manipulations against him by other jealous actors. Dikiy was sentenced and exiled to a Gulag prison-camp in Siberia, where he spent four years until his release in 1941. Comeback Dikiy was not allowed to return to work either in Leningrad or in Moscow, instead he lived and worked in the Siberian city of Omsk for several years during the Second World War. In 1944 Dikiy was cast in the title role as Prince Kutuzov in a Soviet propaganda film Kutuzov (1944), which was also known outside of Russia as 1812. For that role Dikiy was awarded the Stalin Prize and was allowed to work in Moscow as a theater director. His most important works as director were Blokha by Nikolai Leskov and Teni (Shadows) by Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin. Stalin After serving time in one of Stalin's Gulag prison-camps in Siberia, Aleksei Dikiy was cast to portray Joseph Stalin in several propaganda films. Stalin approved Dikiy for the role. Stalin became interested in the brilliant actor, after he saw the film Kutuzov (1944). Then Stalin saw Dikiy's performance in the role as Stalin, and sent his security officers to get Dikiy delivered to Kremlin for a brief meeting. Stalin had a drink and told Dikiy that his imprisonment was a must, and that everyone in the country must undergo such experience in exile and prison- camps. Later Dikiy told his students that he played the role of Joseph Stalin as a dangerous, scary, power-hungry dictator. Stalin liked the image of himself made by Dikiy in films. Recognition Stalin was moved by Dikiy's talent and awarded the actor with the Stalin Prize five times, in 1946, 1947, 1949 twice, and 1950. \\"I am playing not a human, but a granite monument\\" said Dikiy, alluding to Stalin.–î–∏–∫–∏–π –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–µ–π –î–µ–Ω–∏—Å–æ–≤–∏—á Dikiy was designated People's Artist of the USSR (1949). He was nominated for 'Best Actor' and received a special mention at the 1947 Venice Film Festival for the title role in Admiral Nakhimov. More repressions In 1953 Dikiy directed his last stage production, the play Teni (Shadows), by Saltykov-Shchedrin. Under Dikiy's direction his friend and partner Boris Babochkin played one of his best roles ever - Klaverov, a corrupt career politician, alluding to a typical Soviet bureaucrat. For that work Babochkin was viciously attacked in the official Soviet newspaper Pravda by Ekaterina Furtseva, who was then a Mayor of Moscow and later was made Minister of Culture of the Soviet Union. Furtseva became enraged with Dikiy and Babochkin's satirical portrayal of the Soviet bureaucracy with allusions to the Soviet leadership. She banned the play, and censored both Babochkin and Dikiy from public performances and kept them virtually unemployed for three years until Babochkin was finally forced to repent to the Communist Party. Death Dikiy suffered from many traumatic experiences in his life. The last blow was being a powerless witness of censorship and public humiliation of his friend Boris Babochkin. Official attacks by the Soviet Communist Party caused Dikiy a severe emotional trauma, which led to alcoholism, depression and other health problems. Aleksei Dikiy died of a heart failure on October 1, 1955, in Moscow, and was laid to rest in Novodevichy Monastery Cemetery in Moscow.

The game came with an audio cassette with different recordings and an anonymous note signed by \\"Saduj\\" (Judas in reverse). Plot In the game, which is set in 1996, the President of the United States is attending an anti-terror summit in Europe with ten Western European leaders. Terrorists attack the summit, knocking out the attendees and security personnel with sleeping gas. The terrorists then kidnap the president and the other leaders and hold them hostage. The terrorists leave an audiotape behind, stating that they are Islamic and make numerous demands in exchange for safe release of the hostages. The player assumes the role of the special investigator, who must find the President and the rest of the hostages. The investigator works from his computer terminal, which has access to dossiers of many different individuals such as known terrorists and members of the Cabinet. The investigator also has eight special agents, whom he can send out to interview people or find out information. The agents' reports are then stored on the computer. The audiotape that comes with the game contains news reports, recorded messages by the President of the United States and the President of France while in captivity, intercepted telephone calls, an interview with the First Lady, and intercepts of Morse code messages. The game includes tools to decipher Morse code messages and other coded clues. If the player learned where a hostage or hostages were being held, he could send a special strike team to a particular address. The strike team would then report its findings, which could include other clues. The computer terminal also has two secret files, one by the CIA and one by the National Security Council, that could not be accessed without prior authorization. The player, however, could attempt to hack into the files. Resolution As the game went on, it was clear that there was a much wider conspiracy going on. The player had to figure it out. As a game, The President Is Missing never ended. The game includes a note telling the player that once they unraveled the game's complex plot, they are to write a report and summarize all of the evidence and send it to Cosmi. In turn, the company would respond to the player. Reception Computer Gaming World applauded The President Is Missings premise, plot, and graphics, but criticized its execution. The magazine concluded, \\"the game has simply too much dead-time to be truly exciting or for players to maintain their initial enthusiasm.\\" References External links *Images of The President Is Missing package, manual and screenshots from C64Sets.com * Category:1988 video games Category:Crime investigation simulators Category:Video games set in 1996 Category:Alternate history video games Category:Commodore 64 games Category:Commodore 64-only games Category:Cosmi games Category:Video games scored by Barry Leitch Category:Video games developed in the United States ","title":"The President Is Missing (video game)"},{"id":"11738240","title":"The Right Stuff (album)"},{"id":"11738241","text":"The Service Book and Hymnal (SBH) was used by most of the Lutheran church bodies in the United States that today compose the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) prior to the publishing of the Lutheran Book of Worship (LBW) of 1978.

He was born in Well, in Yorkshire. Little is known of his early life, but according to Challoner's Memoirs of Missionary Priests, he became an Anglican priest, but later converted to Catholicism.Challoner, Richard. Memoirs of Missionary Priests, [1741]. New edition revised by John Hungerford Pollen. London. Burns Oates and Washbourne, 1924, p. 132. He was imprisoned in York as a Catholic recusant; on being released, he went to Douai College, where he was admitted on 19 May 1577. The date of his ordination is unknown; the College, at this time, was preparing for its move to Rheims, and record keeping was affected.Connelly, Roland. The Eighty-five Martyrs. Essex. McCrimmons Publishing Company, 1987, p. 38. But it is known that the ordination took place in Brussels within four months of his admission to the seminary, and that on 17 September, Simpson set out for England to work as a missionary priest. He carried out his ministry in Lancashire and Derbyshire. According to Challoner, Simpson was arrested and banished in 1585, but returned quickly to England. While travelling in the Peak District, in January 1588, he met a stranger who pretended so successfully to be a Catholic, that Simpson revealed his priesthood. The man denounced him at the next town, and he was arrested.Sweeney, Garrett. A Pilgrim's Guide to Padley. Diocese of Nottingham, 1978, p. 9. He was imprisoned in Derby, and was condemned to death for treason at the Lenten Assizes. However, he was reprieved until the Summer Assizes. Traditional accounts of Simpson's life state that the stay of execution was granted because he had given some indication that he would conform and attend an Anglican service, or hear a sermon. There is no record that he actually did so. According to Connelly, his surrender was not complete, and did not satisfy the judge, since he was not released but merely remanded for a second trial.Connelly, p. 39. Sweeney offers an alternative explanation for his reprieve. He points out that the execution of priests stopped for ten months in September 1587, the last one being that of George Douglas at York on 9 September. They were resumed ten months later, with the execution of Richard Simpson and his companions. Sweeney suggests that Elizabeth and her government, on hearing news of the preparations that Philip of Spain was making for his enterprise, may have decided to halt the persecution of Catholics to remove one of his complaints. By July 1588, the Armada was on its way, and there was no longer any motive for sparing priests. Simpson and his companions were the first of thirty-two priests martyred that year. In Derby Gaol, before his second trial, Richard Simpson met with two other priests, Nicholas Garlick and Robert Ludlam. Traditional accounts indicate that they brought the wavering priest back to the Catholic faith. Whether his reprieve was because of an agreement to attend a Protestant service or because of a temporary ban on executing priests, it is certain that at his second trial, on 23 July, Simpson firmly declared himself a Catholic and was condemned to death with his two companions. The sentence was to be carried out the next day, at St Mary's Bridge, in Derbyshire. Henry Garnet, cited in Sweeney, recounts that the priests spent their last night in the same cell as a woman condemned to death for murder, and that in the course of the night, they reconciled her to the Catholic faith, and she was hanged with them the next day.Sweeney, p. 10 On 24 July 1588, the three priests were drawn on hurdles to the place of execution, where they were hanged, drawn, and quartered. Simpson was apparently to have been executed first, but reports state that Garlick hastened to the ladder before him and kissed it, going up first, either because, as suggested by Anthony Champney,Anthony Champney. History of the Reign of Queen Elizabeth, quoted in Challoner, p. 131. Simpson was showing some signs of fear, or, as suggested by Challoner,Challoner, p. 131. Garlick suspected that there was a danger that his companion's courage might fail him. Simpson was next to die, and an eyewitness, quoted in Challoner, said that he \\"suffered with great constancy, though not with such (remarkable) signs of joy and alacrity as the other two.\\" When his body was cut down for quartering, he was found to be wearing a hairshirt. Another eyewitness, quoted in Hayward,Hayward, F.M. Padley Chapel and Padley Martyrs. Derby. Bemrose and Sons, 1903. 2nd edition 1905, p. 35. says: > What he said to his executioner I cannot hear, but embracing the ladder he > kissed the steps. When he was in quartering, the people cried out, 'A devil, > a devil', because he had on him a shirt of hair; but the wiser sort said he > wore it because he had fallen. A poem by an anonymous writer, who seems to have been present at the executions, and is quoted in Challoner, describes the executions as follows: > When Garlick did the ladder kiss, And Sympson after hie, Methought that > there St. Andrew was Desirous for to die. When Ludlam look√®d smilingly, And > joyful did remain, It seemed St. Stephen was standing by, For to be stoned > again. And what if Sympson seemed to yield, For doubt and dread to die; He > rose again, and won the field And died most constantly. His watching, > fasting, shirt of hair; His speech, his death, and all, Do record give, do > witness bear, He wailed his former fall. Richard Simpson and his two companions were declared venerable in 1888, and were among the eighty-five martyrs of England and Wales beatified by Pope John Paul II on 22 November 1987.

Born in Belfast, he left school at the age of fourteen and for seven years worked as a painter and decorator, mostly in London. From an early age he was interested in art, cinema, and theatre. About 1936 he started out as an artist. His Connemara landscapes provided the viewer with context, portraits of the characters who worked the land, atmosphere and idiosyncratic colour interpretations. Aged 18, Dillon went to London, initially working as a decorator. With the outbreak of the Second World War, he returned to Belfast. Over the next five years he developed as a painter in Dublin and Belfast. His works during this period were more than simple depictions of the life and people around him, they were reactions and interactions in paint. In 1942, his first solo exhibition was opened by his friend and fellow artist, Mainie Jellett at The Country Shop, St. Stephen's Green, Dublin. \\"Father, Forgive Them Their Sins\\" featured depicting his concerns about the new war that had broken out. Despite a growing reputation, he had to return to London in 1944 to work on demolition gangs to restore his finances. In the late 1940s and during the 1950s, Dillon found himself favouring the town of Roundstone, Connemara. In 1958, he had the double honour of representing Ireland at the Guggenheim International, and Great Britain at the Pittsburg International Exhibition. He travelled widely in Europe and taught for brief periods in the London art schools. Last years In 1967, Dillon suffered a stroke and spent six weeks in hospital, from this time his work changed direction. A notion of imminent death sent his work almost into another world, a realm of dreams and paintings intimating his death. In 1968 he was back in Dublin, where he helped to design sets and costumes for Se√°n O'Casey's play \\"Juno and the Paycock\\". He continued to paint and also to make tapestries, sitting at his Singer sewing machine. In 1969, Dillon pulled his artworks from the Belfast leg of the Irish Exhibition of Living Art in purported protest during the Troubles against the \\"arrogance of the Unionist mob\\", as he put it in a letter to The Irish Times, 20 August 1969. Michael Longley retorted in a further letter, \\"Belfast needed creativity, it needed people like Gerard Dillon\\". During his last years, Dillon was invited to be involved in a children's art workshop in the National Gallery of Ireland. Dillon died of a second stroke on 14 June 1971 at the age of 55; his grave, as requested, is unmarked in Belfast's Milltown Cemetery.

It is also known in Mexico as Volc√°n Tacina. Geography The volcano is located within the Tacan√° municipality of the San Marcos Department in Guatemala; and within the Cacahoat√°n and Uni√≥n Ju√°rez Municipalities of Chiapas state in Mexico. Its last known eruption was registered in 1986 ‚Äî a small phreatic eruption in May ‚Äî but it is still considered as dangerous to more than 250,000 people residing in the area. Map of the Central America volcanic arc, with captions showing the location of several volcanoes. Tacan√° is the first large volcano, at the top of the row of captioned volcanoes on this image. Tacan√° is the first of hundreds of volcanoes in a km row, arranged NW to SE, parallel to the Pacific Ocean coast of Central America, known as the Central America Volcanic Arc, formed by an active subduction zone along the western boundary of the Caribbean Plate. The agricultural valley at its NNE foothills is covered with thick deposits of lahars. From its headwaters in Guatemala, the valley drains through Mexico to the Pacific Ocean. Consequently, mudflows from future eruptions could be dangerous to those in their path in both countries. Volcanology Tacan√° is a stratovolcano (composite volcano) that is surrounded by deeply dissected plutonic and metamorphic terrain. It has a wide caldera, with its elongated summit dominated by several lava domes and three large calderas breached to the South. Mild phreatic eruptions of Tacan√° took place in historical times. Its most powerful known explosive activity, which included pyroclastic flows, occurred at about 70 AD (¬± 100 years). That large explosion has resulted in Tacan√° being classified with a volcanic explosivity index of 4 by the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History's Global Volcanism Program. Forest on the slope of Volc√°n Tacan√°. Biosphere Reserve Tacan√° is part of the Central American Core volcanic chain, which contains fragile ecosystems and rich biodiversity of cultural, scientific, economic and biological relevance, particularly in the high mountain ecosystem. Its landscapes and volcanic edifice present geophysical features of great scientific and aesthetic value. Consequently, it has been included in UNESCO's World Network of Biosphere Reserves of the Man and Biosphere Program (MAB). Visitor access The summit of Tacan√° can be reached in about 10 hours. There are two approaches to the mountain. One is from Finca Navidad, South of the volcano, passing through Tojqui√°n Grande, on the Guatemalan side, and moving parallel to the border with Mexico. The second route is from the Mexican side, from El Carmen, Talism√°n bridge, Cacahoat√°n, and Uni√≥n Ju√°rez by vehicle, and from there on foot. This route passes into Guatemala and has been described as one of the most interesting hikes in Central America, leading up winding paths through lush rainforests, subsistence farming villages, up ancient magma flows, and rock-filled temperate forests before reaching the top of the lowest caldera. From there the final stretch to the summit provides panoramic views high above the clouds as the tree line gradually diminishes with altitude. Several major volcanos within the Central American Volcanic Arch including Tajumulco are visible from the summit.

Fr√©mont. Although the exact date of his arrival in California is not known, it probably predated the arrival of any other Surveyor General; he was most likely a resident of California prior to the Gold Rush. Brewster was elected Surveyor of Sonoma County, and his 1854 map of Santa Rosa was the first map recorded in that county. Know-Nothings In the early 1850s, the Whig party collapsed and a new political party emerged. This party called itself the American Party and its candidates were elected overwhelmingly in the 1855 California state election. General John A. Brewster was elected as a member of the American Party. Although popular in its day, the American party's platform opposing the election of Roman Catholics and \\"foreigners\\" was controversial. The American Party came to be known as the \\"Know Nothing Party\\", because when asked about its platform, the members said: \\"I know nothing\\". Wagon roads By the mid-1850s, the public cry for developed wagon roads became so insistent that two routes over the Sierra Nevada mountains were proposed. In August 1856, Brewster led a reconnaissance party to Downieville, Sierra County, in order to examine one of these alternative routes over the Sierras. On the eastern side of Sierra County, they In October 1856, he led a second expedition through Calaveras County. In his Annual Report of 1856, Brewster recommended funding the survey and construction of 6 major routes into California, as well as the building of other roads, and a railroad for commerce and transportation. Official problems General Brewster inherited a legacy of problems with his office. General Brewster discovered that surveys of Swamp and Overflowed lands by the United States Deputy Surveyors differed, in some cases by several million acres, from the amounts recommended by the California Surveyor General to be donated to the State. Like General Marlette before him, Brewster noted significant errors in surveys of county boundaries, calling for alterations in the boundaries of several counties to avoid ambiguity, since, \\"in some instances it is impossible to determine the lines at all.\\" \\"The existing official map of the State is a broad burlesque upon the topography of California ... and (it) should be replaced at once by a map conforming to the true character of the country.\\" It is not known if Brewster ever completed a new, official map.  Family life  After his term as Surveyor General, Brewster traveled east to marry Julia E. Kaene, a native of Canada, on November 1, 1858, in Buffalo, New York. The General and his wife returned to California and made their home in Sonoma. General Brewster mustered into the 63rd Indiana Volunteers, US (Union) Army during the American Civil War. He penned the following to his infant daughter during his service: Brewster survived the Civil War, and died in California at the age of 62. He is interred in Cypress Lawn Memorial Park, Colma, California.

Polish planners wanted to reinforce it with elements of the Prusy Army, which after the Battle of Radom had retreated from German encirclement, and managed to cross the Vistula. These elements, however, were of little military value, and were ordered to concentrate near Chelm. Instead, Lublin Army received 39th Reserve Infantry Division and improvised Sandomierz Group. Operational history Lublin Army came into contact with the enemy on September 8, near Gora Kalwaria and Deblin. After the first clash, the Germans concentrated their efforts on eliminating the remnants of Prusy Army. On September 12, the Wehrmacht advanced in the area of Annopol and Solec nad Wisla. Under its pressure, Polish forces retreated towards Krasnik, where they merged with Krakow Army, and together fought in the Battle of Tomaszow Lubelski (September 17‚Äì20). Organization The Army was commanded by general Tadeusz Piskor; his chief of staff was colonel Jan Zawisza.

Fictional character biography Towshend Horgan Along with Ape-Man, Bird-Man, and Frog-Man, Towshend Horgan was recruited by a man named the Organizer to form the Ani-Men. Horgan had what was described as \\"feline agility\\". The Organizer was secretly Abner Jonas, a candidate for mayor of New York City, who sent the Ani-Men on missions to undermine the current administration. Daredevil defeated them and the Ani-Men and Organizer all went to prison.Iron Man #10-11 Later, Ape-Man, Bird-Man, and Cat-Man formed a team called the \\"Unholy Three\\" with the Exterminator, and fought Daredevil again.Daredevil #39-41 The Unholy Three, as a team of independent thieves, fought Daredevil and Spider-Man and were defeated.Marvel Team-Up #25 Ape-Man, Bird-Man, and Cat-Man later rejoined the Ani-Men, and the Ani-Men went to work for Count Nefaria. Nefaria's scientists submitted the unwitting Ani-Men to processes that gave them superhuman powers and animal-like forms. The Ani-Men invaded the Cheyenne Mountain missile base for Count Nefaria, and fought the X-Men.X-Men #94-95 The Ani-Men lost their superhuman powers and reverted to normal. Count Nefaria sent the four original Ani-Men to kill Tony Stark, however the Spymaster detonated a bomb with which he had intended to kill Stark, and the resulting explosion killed the Ani-Men instead.Iron Man #115-116 Sebastian Patane After the deaths of the original Ani-Men, the Death-Stalker recruited a new team of Ani-Men, with a new Ape-Man, Bird-Man, and Cat-Man.

He was an athletic man with considerable agility and reflexes, and extraordinary acrobatic skills. While employed by the Exterminator, Horgan wielded a \\"time- displacement ray\\" (\\"T-ray\\") gun that fired a ray which projected its victim into a limbo-like inter-dimensional void. The gun could thus \\"displace\\" a victim for a limited period of time, such as 30 minutes. A ray blast of sufficient intensity could exile a victim to the inter-dimensional void permanently. Horgan was later subjected to an unknown mutagenic process administered by Count Nefaria's scientists which temporarily gave him superhuman agility and razor-sharp claws that were actually part of his body. Patane possessed the same abilities as the first Cat-Man, including cat-like claws on his costume and extraordinary acrobatic skills.

He became infamous for a memoir WN 62 ‚Äì Erinnerungen an Omaha Beach Normandie, 6. Juni 1944, published in 2000. This book is noted for the authors' claim that as a machine gunner, Severloh inflicted over 1,000 and maybe over 2,000 casualties to the American soldiers landing on Omaha Beach on D-Day. Subsequent to the book being published, some have referred to Severloh as \\"The Beast of Omaha.\\" However, Severloh's claim is not viewed as credible by either US or German historians. Total US casualties (killed, wounded, and missing) from all sources along the five-mile length of Omaha Beach on D-Day are estimated at about 2,400, though some sources cite variably list between 9,000 and 25,000 casualties.  Early life  Severloh was born into a farming family in Metzingen in the L√ºneburg Heath area of North Germany, close to the small city of Celle.  Service in the Wehrmacht  Conscripted into the Wehrmacht on July 23, 1942, at the age of 19, Severloh was assigned to the 19th Light Artillery Replacement Division in Hanover. He was then transferred to France in August to join the 3rd Battery of the 321st Artillery Regiment, where he trained as a dispatch rider. In December 1942, he was sent to the Eastern Front and assigned to the rear of his division to drive sleighs. As punishment for making dissenting remarks, he was forced to perform physical exertions which left him with permanent health problems and necessitated six-month convalescence in hospital. After this, he went on leave to his family's farm to help gather the harvest. In October 1943, Severloh was sent for non- commissioned officer training in Brunswick, but was recalled after less than a month to rejoin his unit which had been reclassified as the 352nd Infantry Division and was stationed in Normandy.  Omaha Beach  Omaha Beach extends for 5 miles (8 km) from east of Sainte-Honorine-des-Pertes to west of Vierville-sur-Mer. The beach defences at Omaha consisted of 8 concrete bunkers containing 75 mm or greater artillery, 35 pillboxes, 18 anti-tank guns, six mortar pits, 35 Nebelwerfer (multi-barrel rocket launchers), 85 machine gun nests, 6 tank turrets and supporting infantry. Infantry deployments on the Beach consisted of five companies concentrated at 15 strongpoints called Widerstandsnester (Resistance Nests), numbered WN-60 in the east to WN-74 in the west. Severloh was part of WN-62, the largest strongpoint defending Omaha Beach. The American plan of attack divided Omaha Beach into ten sectors, codenamed Able, Baker, Charlie, Dog Green, Dog White, Dog Red, Easy Green, Easy Red, Fox Green and Fox Red. WN-62 at the eastern side of Omaha Beach overlooked both Easy Red and Fox Green sectors.  Widerstandsnest 62  View out of a foxhole from WN-62 WN-62 was 332 meters long by 324 meters wide and between 12 and 50 meters above the beach, depending on the distance from the shore, with a good overview of the beach area. The foxhole Severloh fired from () was 170 meters from the sea wall and around 450 meters from the landing area of the first wave of Higgins Boats. On D-Day (June 6, 1944) WN-62 was manned by 27 members of the 716th Infantry Division and 13 members of Severloh's 352nd Division, whose task was to direct fire of the 10.5 cm artillery batteries located 5 kilometres inland at Houtteville.(Full list of WN-62 personnel ) Defences included two type H669 concrete casemates, one empty and the other with a 75mm artillery piece, a 50mm anti-tank gun, two 50mm mortars, a twin-barrelled MG 34 7.92mm machine gun on an anti-aircraft mount and two prewar Polish machine guns. Another 50 mm anti-tank gun covered the rear, and the perimeter was ringed by barbed wire and anti personnel mines. Severloh was assigned to a Senior Lieutenant Bernhard Frerking as an orderly. While Frerking coordinated the artillery fire of the battery at Houtteville from a bunker, Severloh says he manned a MG 42 machine gun, and fired on approaching American troops with the machine gun and two Karabiner 98k rifles; while a sergeant whom he did not know, kept him supplied with ammunition from a nearby ammo bunker until 15:30. He claimed to have fired over 13,500 rounds with the machine gun and 400 with the rifles. Interviewed in 2004, he said: \\"It was definitely at least 1,000 men, most likely more than 2,000. But I do not know how many men I shot. It was awful. Thinking about it makes me want to throw up.\\" Surrender and captivity Severloh retreated to the nearby village of Colleville-sur-Mer, with Kurt Warnecke also from the 352nd and Franz Gockel from the 716th, where he surrendered the next day. His commanding officer, Lt. Frerking and most of the other defenders of WN-62 were killed at their posts by American troops. Top Casement of WN-62, with the memorial honoring 5th Engineer Brigade Severloh was first sent as a prisoner of war to Boston, United States. In December 1946, he was transferred to Bedfordshire, England as forced labor working on road construction. Severloh was returned to Germany in March 1947 after his father wrote to the British military authorities saying he was needed to work back on the farm.  Later life and death  Severloh's story became known for the first time in 1960, when his testimony was used in Paul Carell's book Sie kommen! Die Invasion der Amerikaner und Briten in der Normandie 1944. In the 1960s an American military chaplain, David Silva, who had been wounded by three bullets in the chest on Omaha Beach, was contacted by Severloh - who had found his name in the Cornelius Ryan book The Longest Day. They later met several times, including at the 2005 reunion of Allied Forces in Normandy. On 5 June 2004 RTL showed a two-hour documentary in co-production with CBC Radio: \\"Mortal enemies of Omaha Beach ‚Äì the story of an unusual friendship,\\" by the filmmaker Alexander Czogalla. On the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the landing in Normandy, a one-hour documentary was broadcast on June 6, 1984, by the American broadcaster ABC. As part of the research, Heinrich Severloh gave a four-hour interview. In 2000, Severloh's memoir, WN 62 ‚Äì Erinnerungen an Omaha Beach Normandie, 6. Juni 1944, ghostwritten by Helmut Konrad von Keusgen was published. Severloh died 14 January 2006 in Lachendorf near his home village of Metzingen, aged 82 years, 6 months and 22 days. Skepticism Total US casualties (killed, wounded, or missing) at Omaha Beach on D-Day have been variously estimated between 9,000 and over 25,000.

Assigned to commander western sea frontier, PCS 1465 patrolled and trained off the west coast until late in December 1944. Sailing to Pearl Harbor she underwent conversion to an underwater location vessel and consequently 10 January 1945 was armed and redesignated Minah (AMc 204). Following an appropriate training period she departed 7 July in company with other coastal minesweepers for Okinawa. While steaming beyond Saipan on the last leg of her voyage hostilities ceased. Peace focused attention on the need to clear harbor areas for the restoration of commerce and in Japan to gain access for the occupation forces. Operating until 8 September around the Okinawa area, Minah then sailed to Japan and assisted in clearing mines from Sasebo Harbor. Later steaming into Pusan, Korea, 5 October, she supervised Japanese minesweeping operations. While on this duty AMc-204 rescued the crew of a Japanese destroyer which struck a mine and sank and also employed her divers in checking previously sunken ships. Additional underwater location assignments were performed at Kure Harbor before departing Korean waters 15 January 1946. En route to the United States Minah sailed via Bikini Atoll where from 8 to 25 March she helped prepare the area for the atomic testing of Operation Crossroads. Arriving San Pedro, California, 15 May she was soon assigned to the Commander Mine Force, Atlantic Fleet, and transferred her base of operations to Charleston, South Carolina, by 21 July. Demobilization policies curtailed the ship‚Äôs movements until April 1947 when she undertook a series of BuShips projects in the Norfolk and Yorktown areas. The following 4 years were spent assisting the Naval Mine Countermeasure Station at Panama City, Florida. Redesignated AMCU-14 on 7 March 1952 Minah proceeded to New York Navy Yard in April, one of 31 minesweepers to be converted. Local operations out of Little Creek, Virginia, and Key West, Florida, preceded a final redesignation of MHC-14 on 7 February 1955. She engaged in projects of the Operational Development Force and saw service within the 6th Naval District before she decommissioned in Florida, September 1959. Briefly berthed with Atlantic Reserve Fleet, her name was stricken from the Navy list 1 November 1959. She was sold to William J. Kleb and removed from Naval custody 8 September 1960.

President George W. Bush and First Lady Laura Bush are in attendance. Harolyn Blackwell (born November 23, 1955) is an American lyric coloratura soprano who has performed in many of the world's finest opera houses, concert halls, and theaters in operas, oratorios, recitals, and Broadway musicals. Initially known for her work within musical theater during the early 1980s, Blackwell moved into the field of opera and by 1987 had established herself as an artist within the soubrette repertoire in many major opera houses both in the United States and in Europe. Feeling that she was being \\"type cast\\" into one particular kind of role, Blackwell strove to establish herself within the lyric coloratura repertoire beginning in the mid-1990s. With the aid of such companies as Seattle Opera, Blackwell successfully made this move and is now an interpreter of such roles as Lucia in Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor and Olympia in Offenbach's Les contes d'Hoffman. She has also periodically returned to musical theater performances throughout her career in staged productions, concert work, and recitals. Blackwell is known for her interpretations and recordings of the works of Leonard Bernstein.  Early life and education  Harolyn Blackwell was born in Washington, D.C. on November 23, 1955, the eldest of five children.Harolyn Blackwell Internet Movie Database Both of her parents were teachers and active participants in the Civil Rights Movement. Her father, Harold Blackwell (for whom she was named), was also a redevelopment specialist with the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development in Washington, D.C. for many years, and her mother taught physical education and health at the University of the District of Columbia. Blackwell first became interested in music through the influence of her fourth grade teacher, Nancy Notargiacomo, who eventually became her voice and piano teacher when she was 10. She also credits her high school choral director for encouraging her to pursue a music career. In a 2003 interview Blackwell recalled, \\"I did not come from a musical family. I had a fourth grade teacher that introduced me to music and I sang at the Catholic church. In high school I started doing musicals ‚àí The Sound of Music, Brigadoon, Oliver!, and so forth. I thought maybe this would be what I would pursue after high school, although even in my senior year in high school I had doubts. I wanted to go into history or fashion design. But, I had a wonderful choral director who said 'no, your calling is music,' and she convinced me.\\"US Opera Web 2003 Interview Blackwell attended Catholic University where she majored in vocal music education and also spent time in activities and classes related to the University's drama and musical theater programs. Blackwell said, \\"I wasn't quite sure whether I wanted to pursue classical or musical theater. I knew that whichever I chose, I wanted to have a classical training. It was important to me to have the technical expertise as well as also the theory and understanding of classical music. Catholic University was the best of both possible worlds, because they had a very strong drama department as well as a very good music department. They were next door, so I spent quite a bit of time going back and forth between the drama department and the music department.\\" After graduating with her undergraduate degree in 1977, Blackwell taught music in two parochial schools while simultaneously continuing her vocal studies on the graduate level at Catholic University. She graduated with a Masters in Vocal Performance in 1980.Catholic University Public Affairs Early career In 1979, while preparing a recital program for her master's degree, Blackwell auditioned for the Broadway revival of West Side Story. Impressed with her audition, Leonard Bernstein hand picked her for the role of Francisca (formerly named Consuela in the original 1957 production) and the understudy for Maria in the 1980 revival.Harolyn Blackwell Internet Broadway Database As Francisca, Blackwell sang the song Somewhere from the orchestra pit during the final scene of the musical.Harolyn Blackwell Official Website For the next two-and-a-half years she toured with the show, gaining skills no operatic training could have provided. Blackwell said, \\"I learned about characterization, how you went about becoming that person\\", she said. \\"I learned stamina, how to do eight shows a week. And I learned to make the stage my home, where I felt 100 percent comfortable.\\" At the show's premiere, critics remarked how similar Blackwell sounded to opera singer Reri Grist who originated the role of Consuela. Coincidentally, Blackwell met and befriended Grist in 1985 when she coached Blackwell for her European debut as Oscar in Verdi's Un ballo in maschera with the Hamburg State Opera. She repeated that role the following year at the Lyric Opera of Chicago. In 1981, Blackwell auditioned for and was accepted into both the Houston Grand Opera and Lyric Opera of Chicago young artist programs. Having to choose between the two, Blackwell decided to go to Chicago. After singing with the company in small parts for a year, Blackwell left the program and moved back to New York to study vocal technique more intensely with Shirlee Emmons. She went on to win the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions in 1983. Up to this point Blackwell was still uncertain as to whether she would continue pursuing an opera career or go back to musical theater. With winning the Met Auditions, however, her career path became decidedly reoriented towards opera. \\"It fit so naturally\\", she explains of the then new foray into opera, \\"it was as if I'd put on a pair of old shoes.\\" Following her win, Blackwell continued in her apprenticeship at the Lyric Opera of Chicago for a year.Melba Newsome, 'Harolyn Blackwell: coming full circle ‚Äî Black singer moved from Broadway musicals to opera', American Visions, Dec‚ÄìJan, 1996 In 1987 she made her Metropolitan Opera debut as Poussette in Manon.Metropolitan Opera Database Since then Blackwell's career has flourished. She has appeared several more times with the Metropolitan Opera in productions such as Un ballo in maschera, Le nozze di Figaro, Die Fledermaus, and Werther among others.LA Phil Presents About the Performer ‚Äî Harolyn Blackwell In 1989 Blackwell performed and recorded the role of Clara in a critically acclaimed production of Gershwin's Porgy and Bess with the Glyndebourne Festival Opera. The recording won a Grammy Award and Blackwell performed the aria \\"Summertime\\" at the 1990 Grammy Awards. That performance was praised highly and raised Blackwell's profile as an opera singer to watch.Program Notes, National Academies Concert February 13, 2005 In 1991, Blackwell made her debut with the San Francisco Opera as Zerlina in Mozart's Don Giovanni.San Francisco Opera Archives That same year she gave a highly praised performance as Oscar in Verdi's Un ballo in maschera with the Metropolitan Opera opposite Luciano Pavarotti. The performance was video taped and subsequently aired on PBS' Great Performances. Blackwell appeared on Great Performances again in 1993 in the concert Sondheim ‚Äî A Celebration at Carnegie Hall where she performed music from Stephen Sondheim's Sweeney Todd. The concert has subsequently been released on DVD and CD. Throughout the early 1990s, Blackwell remained active in performances with opera companies throughout the United States and Europe. Most notably, in 1994 Blackwell replaced Kathleen Battle as Marie in La fille du r√©giment at the Metropolitan Opera for the entire run when Battle was fired from the production for unprofessional conduct. This has inevitably caused critics to compare the two singers, and indeed both women have played many of the same roles and share a similar vocal quality. In a 2003 interview Blackwell said, \\"Kathleen has been very supportive and very good to me over my career. Mattiwilda Dobbs, Reri Grist and Kathy were basically the predecessors for me and I really am grateful to those women, especially with my particular fach. I mean, singing A√Øda or Leonora is one thing, but the lyric repertory roles are not star vehicles. It just doesn't happen and I think these women have really helped in that respect.\\" Later career In the mid-1990s, Blackwell moved away from the soubrette repertoire and began to sing almost exclusively lyric coloratura roles. Instrumental in boosting her profile within this repertoire was Seattle Opera under the direction of Speight Jenkins. Blackwell first worked with the company in 1990 in the role of Marie in La fille du r√©giment. Impressed with her voice, the company rehired Blackwell periodically throughout the 1990s and 2000s giving her opportunities to sing new repertoire such as the title roles in Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor and Delibes' Lakm√©. She has also sung Norina in Donizetti's Don Pasquale, Gilda in Verdi's Rigoletto, and Olympia in Les contes d'Hoffman with the company among other roles. Positive reviews from these performances led to Blackwell's engagement during the late 1990s and 2000s in similar repertoire with many other companies to great acclaim including Teatro Col√≥n de Buenos Aires, Op√©ra de Nice, Florida Grand Opera, Tulsa Opera, and the Netherlands Opera. In 1997 Blackwell returned to Broadway to star as Cunegonde in Bernstein's Candide. Although Blackwell earned rave reviews for her singing, the production as a whole was not well received. Most critics blamed the productions flaws on Hal Prince's interpretation and direction that caused a lack of overall focus within the show. Others have blamed the problems on inherent flaws within the musical's book. Blackwell can be heard on the recording of the 1997 revival.Stephen Sondheim Official Website Blackwell had also previously recorded several other works by Bernstein the year before on her solo album Blackwell Sings Bernstein that was released on the RCA label. The album features a guest performance by Vanessa L. Williams as Anita in selections from West Side Story. Blackwell has also performed in many acclaimed concert series and given many lauded recitals over the years. She has performed at London's Wigmore Hall, Carnegie Hall's Weill Recital Hall, The San Francisco Performance Series at the Herbst Theatre, the Morgan Library, the Kennedy Center, and the Ambassador Foundation Performing Arts Series in Los Angeles. In 2002-2003 she toured the United States giving concerts with Florence Quivar. She has also performed for several notable figures. In 1999 Blackwell was invited to perform at the Vatican for Pope John Paul II's 80th birthday. In 2006, she performed a concert in honor of the Dance Theatre of Harlem at the White House with President George W. Bush and Laura Bush in attendance.White House Press Release Other major national and international opera companies and festivals that Blackwell has performed with include: the Washington National Opera, Canadian Opera Company, Aix-en-Provence Festival, Opera Orchestra of New York, and New York City's Mostly Mozart Festival among others.National Endowment for the Arts Press Release Also an accomplished singer of the concert repertoire, she has performed with the Pittsburgh Symphony, the Cincinnati Symphony, the Dallas Symphony, the Seattle Symphony, the New York Philharmonic,Columbia Artists Management the Munich Philharmonic, the Oslo Philharmonic, the New Jersey Symphony, the NHK Symphony Orchestra, the Boston Pops and the London Symphony Orchestra.

She recalls about her years spent teaching in the late 1970s, \\"I taught at two parochial schools, one in Washington, D.C., and the other in Bethesda, Maryland, and I had to fight for my children to be able to go down to the Kennedy Center to see an opera. I got the English teacher, the history teacher and the art teacher to come together and work on this project where we all talked about the music, the art, the history and the literature from the period.\\" This interest in education continued into her opera career. For many years, Blackwell participated in a program called the \\"Affiliate Artists\\" where she went into the community and talked to people one-on-one to educate them about and inspire interest in opera. Blackwell says, \\"We don't have audience participation anymore, partly because of being raised on television. We have become an audience that receives entertainment in a passive way. I think in order to participate you have to have knowledge and knowledge means you have to take the time to sit down and educate. When you are able to communicate with people and show them you're just another human being with a gift, it makes all the difference. My gift happens to be singing. When you go to an opera you see so many people, but you don't have an opportunity to have that one-on-one contact and that's what was so great about that program.\\" In 2002, Blackwell's work as an educator took on a more official form when she became an adjunct faculty member at the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore. She taught master classes at the school for four years. Blackwell has also been invited as a guest instructor at several universities and conservatories throughout the United States.Peabody Conservatory She currently teaches on the voice faculties of Manhattan School of Music, Barnard College and New York University. Personal life Blackwell has been married to businessman Peter Greer since 1991. A Catholic, she has stated about her voice that \\"God had given me this gift. I want to use it well.\\" Vocal appreciation and criticism At the beginning of her career, Blackwell played mostly soubrette roles and has since moved more into the lyric coloratura soprano repertoire. Blackwell has commented that she felt opera houses were initially uncertain as to how to cast her because of her musical theater background. She said, \\"They saw me in the lighter repertoire and my voice teacher and I saw me in the lyric repertoire.\\" In addition, her small frame and 5'1\\" stature in combination with girlish looks made her a perfect physical casting choice for soubrette roles. It wasn't until Blackwell studied in Busseto with Carlo Bergonzi, Renata Tebaldi, and Sylvia Barrachi in the late 1980s that she finally was given direction into the lyric coloratura repertoire. Blackwell recalls, \\"At the end of the program Mrs. Barrachi and Renata Tebaldi sat down with me and told me what roles I should sing if I wanted to have a major career. Having those two women take the time to talk to me made a big difference. I have always been the type of individual that takes all the information and then makes the decision that's appropriate for me. I can be very stubborn. I really do have to credit those two women for saving me.\\" However, it took some time before Blackwell felt her voice was ready to tackle these coloratura roles. She has remarked that her own voice has gone through periods of change. \\"Your voice changes so much; it changes at 17 or 18, and again in your mid-20s and in your 30s. A voice is constantly changing and evolving.\\" Critics have particularly noted a shift in Blackwell's voice in the mid-1990s, commenting on its fuller sound. In 1995 the Seattle Post Intelligencer said of Blackwell, \\"Her lyric soprano has grown in size. Always flexible, the voice is now richer and fuller.\\" This change in her voice tracks with her move into more mature repertoire in the mid to late 1990s. Blackwell has received consistent positive praise throughout her career. About her New York City recital debut at Carnegie Hall in 1987 noted music critic Will Crutchfield wrote, \\"The voice is first rate: a small, clean high soprano that goes from high to low and loud to soft with rare unity and poise. It is beautiful in quality and she has the special ability to take it down to the very tiniest pianissimo with complete control. Her linguistic grasp was secure, and her intonation likewise... Miss Blackwell's personality on the stage is warm and likable, and in one of Roland Hayes's spiritual arrangements she showed an unexpected comic gift.\\" In 1994, the New York Times said, \\"Her performances at the Met since her 1987 debut as Pousette in \\"Manon\\" have won consistent praise, both for the purity and suppleness of her voice and for her poised, persuasive acting.\\" A 2000 article in the Seattle Post Intelligencer in review of her performance of the title role in Lucia di Lammermoor said, \\"Vocally and dramatically, this is a role that is perfectly suited to Blackwell; the voice is the right size, the right timbre and has the right flexibility for this coloratura challenge. Agile and clear, her soprano soars and floats like an eagle on an updraft. The two big E-flats in the Mad Scene were right on target.\\" In 2001 Opera News said, \\"Harolyn Blackwell sang beautifully, with crisp, unfussy diction... She sang with a satisfying lyricism, and her \\"Summertime\\" was mesmerizing.\\"OPERA NEWS, February 2001 A 2005 Seattle Times article said in their review of her portrayal of Olympia in Les contes d'Hoffman, \\"Another scene-stealer was Harolyn Blackwell, who brought down the house with her perfect coloratura fireworks.\\" Awards Ms. Blackwell is a recipient of numerous awards and honors, one of which provided her the opportunity to study in Italy with Renata Tebaldi and Carlo Bergonzi. Early on in her career she won Baltimore Opera's Puccini Foundation Award, was a winner of the WGN-Illinois Opera Guild \\"Audition of the Air\\", was awarded two Career Grants from the Richard Tucker Music Foundation, and the Alumna of the Year Award from Catholic University. More recently, Siena College bestowed upon her an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters and she was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from George Washington University.

Originally a fur trader for the Hudson's Bay Company, he eventually settled in Prairie du Chien, in what became Wisconsin. He had two families, including three children with a Ho-Chunk woman of mixed-race ancestry. After the War of 1812, Brisbois became a baker. Still a trader at heart, he noted the lack of stability in early government currency, and encouraged the use of bread (from his bakery) as a unit of exchange. History Michel [aka Michael] Brisebois was born to a French-Canadian family in Yamaska, Quebec, Canada, in 1759. He attended school in Quebec. Soon turning to the fur trade along the upper Mississippi River, he worked out of Mackinac (1778) for the British-owned Hudson's Bay Company. In 1781 he moved his operations to Prairie du Chien where, with other French-Canadian traders, he founded the first permanent European settlement. Although sympathizing with the British in the struggle for control of the Northwest Territory after the United States achieved independence, he accepted a commission in the Illinois Territorial Militia (1809). During the War of 1812, Brisbois furnished supplies to both the American and British forces but maintained a pro-British attitude. Arrested for treason at the close of the war, he was sent to St. Louis, Missouri, for trial but was acquitted. After the war, Brisbois became a baker in Prairie du Chien. Still a trader at heart, he noted the lack of stability in early government currency, and encouraged the use of bread (from his bakery) as a unit of exchange. In 1819 Brisbois was appointed associate justice for Crawford County by US Governor Lewis Cass of Michigan Territory. Later he was elected or appointed to other local offices in the Prairie du Chien area. Marriage and family In 1785 Brisbois had married a Winnebago (Ho-Chunk) woman, in what may have been an informal or \\"country marriage\\" typical in that period between traders and Native American women. (She was reputedly the natural, or illegitimate M√©tis daughter of Charles Gautier de Verville and a native woman). Dousman had three mixed-race children with her. In Canada the M√©tis have been recognized as an ethnic group that has the status of a First Nation. The children were named Ang√©lique, Michel, and Antoine, and were raised primarily by their mother, who lived in a settlement with Ho-Chunk relatives. The Ho-Chunk have a matrilineal kinship system, in which they consider children born to the mother's people. Later Brisbois married formally on August 8, 1796, in Mackinaw City, Michigan, to Domitilde (Madeleine) Gautier de Verville, a legitimate daughter of Charles Gautier de Verville. They had a son Bernard Walter Brisbois, born in Prairie du Chien in 1808. The senior Brisbois died in Prairie du Chien on April 1, 1837. Brisbois House (I) : For Brisbois House (II), see Bernard Brisbois House Built in 1815, the Michel Brisbois House served as a trading post and warehouse of the American Fur Company. In the 1850s the house was demolished. By 1923, the Bernard Brisbois House was mistakenly believed to be the Michel Brisbois House, and was thus considered to be one of the oldest European- American buildings in the State of Wisconsin. But research by the Wisconsin Historical Society determined that this structure was a home built by Joseph Rolette as part of a separation contract negotiated in 1836 for his estranged wife Jane Fisher Rolette. She was said to be a relative of Michel Brisbois. She married again in 1844 after Rolette's death, to Hercules L. Dousman, at one time her late husband's partner. At that time, she transferred title of the house to her cousin Bernard Walter Brisbois.

In 1962 she was commissioned into Republic of China Navy service. Service history United States Navy LST-735 was laid down on 30 January 1944 at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania by the Dravo Corporation of Neville Island; launched on 11 March 1944; sponsored by Mrs. G. W. Fearnside; and commissioned on 26 April 1944 at New Orleans, Louisiana with Lieutenant Theodore F. Aldous in command. During World War II, LST-735 was assigned to the Asiatic-Pacific theater and participated in the following operations: capture and occupation of Saipan (August 1944); Lingayen Gulf landing (January 1945); Zambales-Subic Bay (January 1945); and the assault and occupation of Okinawa Gunto (March through June 1945). LST-735 was decommissioned in March 1946 and reactivated on 3 November 1950 when she performed service during the Korean War and after with Commander Mine Forces, Pacific. Assigned as a minesweeper support ship in July 1951, she made a Korean War deployment in 1952-53 and had additional Western Pacific tours in 1953-54 and 1955‚Äì56. Renamed USS Dukes County (LST-735) 1 July 1955. LST-735 earned four battle stars for World War II service and three for Korean service. Republic of China Navy The ship was subsequently decommissioned (date unknown) and leased to the Republic of China (Taiwan) in May 1957 and again renamed Chung Hai (LST-219). She was outfitted in January 1962 as an amphibious command ship and renamed Kao Hsiung (AGC-1, later LCC-1). Struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 November 1974, she was sold to Taiwan. Kao Hsiung later underwent refurbishment along with the rest of the ROCN's fleet of tank landing ships and is still serving with the ROC Navy and was visited in March 2012 by Fleet Master Chief John Minyard of Pacific Fleet Command. He reported that she is in outstanding condition and is battle ready. In 2016 she was selected to host as Mark 41 Vertical Launching System test bed for Taiwan. In November 2019 it was reported that she had been decommissioned and was being used as a test ship for the Hsun Lien naval combat system project and had been fitted with a large phased array radar system and the Mark 41 Vertical Launching System.

It was to have been used to test and confirm systems used in the company's commercial space station efforts during the early 2010s, and if successful, would have formed the first piece of the proposed commercial space station. While Sundancer had been under construction at the Bigelow plant in North Las Vegas, Nevada, the company announced in July 2011 that Sundancer had been removed from their station evolution path, and that the B330 would become the first production module. Spacecraft history and future Upon its original announcement, Sundancer was intended to be the fourth module orbited by Bigelow Aerospace. In August 2007, however, it was announced that due to rising space launch costs and the level of success of the first two Bigelow modules launched, the third development module, Galaxy, would not be put into space and the Sundancer program would be accelerated. The life support and other advanced systems intended for space testing on Galaxy, and potentially the spacecraft itself, would still be built and used for ground testing. Sundancer was intended for launch aboard the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, but a launch date has been continually pushed back. In 2007, it was reported that Sundancer would be in orbit by 2010, with such a date confirmed by SpaceX. By March 2008 this launch slot had slipped to 2011, by 2010 had again slipped to 2014, and by July 2011 the Sundancer had been cancelled such that the B330 would become the first production module. Sundancer was to spend its first six to nine months on- orbit in a checkout configuration to test systems, followed by manned shakedown missions when transport vehicles become available. If these manned missions prove successful, Bigelow plans to use Sundancer as the starting point of the first commercial space complex. The company intends to launch a combined propulsion bus and central node to dock with Sundancer, followed by two full-size B330 modules which would connect to the central node. This station would potentially be followed by several more similar stations. , it was estimated that a one-week trip to the complex would be priced at US$7.9 million. Systems and configuration Sundancer will be equipped with full life support systems, attitude control, orbital maneuvering systems, and will be capable of reboost and deorbit burns. Like the Genesis pathfinders, Sundancer will launch with its outer surface compacted around its central core, with air expanding it to its full size after entering orbit. After expansion, the module will measure in length and in diameter, with of habitable interior volume. Unlike previous Bigelow craft, it will feature three observation windows, and will be equipped with a Soyuz-type docking system on one end of the craft and a NASA-developed International Low Impact Docking System on the other. Sundancers propulsion system will initially be used to boost the module into a high orbit for long duration testing and will later lower it back into an orbit reachable by manned spacecraft. The module utilizes a redundant propulsion design for its attitude control and de-orbit systems, with each propulsion system featuring a different form of propellant. Aerojet provided the hypergolic Aft Propulsion System (APS), with Andrews Space building the APS electronic controllers. Dynetics, formerly Orion Propulsion, created the Forward Propulsion System (FPS), which uses hydrogen and oxygen by-products from the Sundancer life support system. Bigelow Aerospace is also considering an option to include lights on the exterior of the spacecraft, potentially visible from Earth, which would be a furtherance of the projection system currently flying aboard Genesis II. Robert Bigelow noted in an interview that \\"if you have some blue and green and amber-colored lighting going on, you would have something that really has a lot of blink to it.\\" Launch vehicle Due to the added size and mass of Sundancer over previous modules, the craft will require a medium-lift launch vehicle to take it into orbit. SpaceX has been contracted to provide a Falcon 9 vehicle for a launch in 2014. Bigelow has also entered discussion with Lockheed Martin regarding the possible use of the Atlas V as a launch vehicle for manned space capsules, which would be required to deliver crew, tourists and materiel to the new habitat. , no commercial spacecraft exists to deliver humans into orbit, effectively leaving Sundancer as \\"a destination waiting for a means to get there\\". SpaceX is in the process of human-rating the Falcon 9 vehicle and its Dragon crew capsule for carrying privately contracted and NASA passengers into earth orbit, and Boeing is working with Bigelow Aerospace to develop the CST-100 crew capsule for NASA's Commercial Crew Development (CCDev) program.

Kendrick was born in Houston, Texas but attended high school in Mount Vernon, Washington. While growing up, he was greatly influenced by his father, from whom he developed his composure when pitching. Upon graduation, Kendrick turned down a scholarship to play college football, instead signing a contract to begin his pro baseball career with the Phillies. After a slow ascent through Minor League Baseball (MiLB), he made his MLB debut in , and was a member of the starting rotation of the 2008 World Series Championship team. Subsequently, Kendrick was demoted to the minors to develop secondary pitches. From to , his role on the big-league squad frequently fluctuated; however, he was considered by many writers to be an underrated pitcher. Nevertheless, Kendrick drew the ire of Phillies fans who were tired of his inconsistency. After a successful campaign, he firmly implanted himself in the Phillies' starting rotation before the season. Kendrick's pitching style was characterized by his poise on the mound that allowed him to \\"go with the flow\\" of the game. He predominantly threw a sinker, and mixed in some secondary pitches in which he lacked confidence. Kendrick is married to 3-time Survivor contestant Stephenie LaGrossa, has three children, and lives in Snohomish County, Washington. Early life Born in Houston, Texas, Kendrick was a three-sport standout in football, basketball, and baseball at Mount Vernon High School in Mount Vernon, Washington. Throughout his adolescent athletic career, it was Kendrick's father Maury from whom Kendrick drew guidance and direction, particularly on how to conduct oneself during a game. Maury advised Kendrick to show as little emotion as possible when pitching, and is the one from whom Kendrick draws his composure while pitching. Kendrick and his father discuss pitching before and after every one of Kendrick's starts, which Maury watches from Seattle, Washington, and in 2013, Maury was part of the Phillies' Father's Day celebration, a celebration of his guidance of Kendrick. Professional career Philadelphia Phillies Minor leagues: 2003‚Äì2006 The Philadelphia Phillies drafted Kendrick in the seventh round (205th overall) of the 2003 Major League Baseball Draft, which caused him to reject a football scholarship offer to Washington State University. Kendrick began his career in the lower levels of the minor league system, and struggled mightily. A feature article in Phillies magazine noted, Early in Kendrick's career, many within the organization questioned his work ethic and maturity, which they thought may have contributed to his underachievement. In 2006, however, the Phillies \\"patience was ... rewarded\\"; pitching for the Lakewood BlueClaws for the third consecutive season, he earned Phillies Minor League Pitcher of the Month accolades for May, thus warranting a promotion to the Clearwater Threshers. In 20 starts with Clearwater, Kendrick posted a 3.53 ERA, among the best in the Florida State League. This performance as well as the fact that he spent significant time working out and focusing on mechanical improvement allayed the previous fears of poor work ethic. Ultimately, 2007 would be Kendrick's last in the low levels of the Phillies' minor leagues, as he began the season with the Double-A (AA) Reading Phillies, and finished it with the big league club. Breaking through: 2007‚Äì2009 Kendrick during the 2008 regular season Despite several options at Triple-A (AAA), when Freddy Garc√≠a got hurt, Pat Gillick promoted Kendrick to the major leagues, which drew skepticism, as Kendrick was just 22 years old, and had not pitched particularly well for Reading. However, according to Steve Noworyta, Phillies assistant director of player development, Kendrick's \\"mound presence and his maturity\\", as well as the fact that \\"nothing really seemed to bother him\\" contributed to his promotion. His MLB debut came on June 13 against the Chicago White Sox at Citizens Bank Park. He pitched six innings and gave up three runs, receiving a no-decision in an 8‚Äì4 Phillies' victory. He pitched the second game of the 2007 National League Division Series against the Colorado Rockies, which the Phillies lost, en route to being swept in the series. He finished the season with a 10‚Äì4 win‚Äìloss record and a 3.87 ERA in 121 MLB innings pitched. He came in fifth place, ultimately losing to Ryan Braun, in 2007 National League Rookie of the Year Award voting. Before the 2008 season, Kendrick was a victim of an \\"elaborate practical joke\\" executed by Brett Myers that had Kendrick convinced he had been traded away to Japan. During the season, Kendrick's performance slipped; he posted a 5.49 ERA in 30 starts. Despite his relative ineffectiveness, the Phillies won the 2008 World Series, and though he was left off the postseason roster, Kendrick received a World Series ring and co-authored a diary from the series. Phillies pitching coach Rich Dubee attributed the decline to hitters discerning that Kendrick threw predominantly a sinker, and almost always in the strike zone, thus fostering predictability for hitters. As such, he spent the majority of the 2009 season in the minor leagues, working on developing his change up, which proved to be an arduous process. Ultimately, after learning a new grip from Justin Lehr, he had a eureka moment during a bullpen session in 2009; he developed the pitch, and made it back to the major leagues \\"for good\\" near the conclusion of the season. An undefined role: 2010‚Äì2012 The Phillies acquired Roy Halladay prior to the 2010 season, and during spring training, Kendrick sought the mentorship of Halladay, whom he aspired to emulate during his high school career. Halladay willingly obliged, and teammates endearingly referred to Kendrick as \\"Little Roy\\" due to the amount of time he spent working with Halladay. Despite initially losing a competition for the fifth spot in the Phillies starting rotation during spring training to Jamie Moyer, an injury to Joe Blanton thrust Kendrick into the fifth spot in the Phillies rotation, the fourth consecutive year during which he had held that role for at least a short time. After a decent first half of the 2010 season (at the end of June, he had a 4‚Äì4 record with a 3.23 ERA). Kendrick was briefly demoted to the Lehigh Valley IronPigs (AAA), but did not make any starts there, as Moyer's season ended due to injury, causing Kendrick's recall. Overall, he earned 11 wins, which tied a career high, and started 31 games, which set a new career high, while, in total, posting an 11‚Äì10 record with a 4.73 ERA in 180 innings pitched. Pat Gallen, editor in chief of Phillies Nation, opined that Kendrick's performance indicated he would never exceed being an average, \\"run-of-the-mill starting pitcher\\", who would never exceed that role. At the conclusion of the season, Kendrick and the Phillies avoided salary arbitration by agreeing to a one-year, contract. Kendrick's inconsistency continued in 2011, when he \\"flip-flopped between the rotation and the bullpen all season\\", performing as a spot starter and long reliever. His starts came during injuries to Blanton and Roy Oswalt, the latter of whom was a member of the \\"phour aces\\" that comprised the front-end of the Phillies' starting rotation (Oswalt, Cliff Lee, Roy Halladay, and Cole Hamels). When making those spot starts, he was able to \\"keep the team in the game\\". During the season, he improved against left-handed hitters, performed strongly against divisional opponents, and posted a career-best 3.22 ERA. Overall, he totaled 34 appearances, 15 of which were starts, and recorded an 8‚Äì6 record in 114 innings pitched. Again eligible for arbitration, this year, he signed a one-year, pact with Philadelphia. Once again, Kendrick was not a member of the opening day starting rotation, as Blanton and Vance Worley rounded out the final two spots after Hamels, Halladay, and Lee. However, once again, he joined the rotation due to injury, this season to Worley. He was a member of the rotation from the end of April to the beginning of July, in a relief role until the beginning of August, and then in the rotation for the remainder of the season. Ultimately, Kendrick started 25 games of a career-high 37 appearances. He was especially strong after the all-star game, posting a 3.15 ERA and nine wins, the latter of which was tied for first in the National League. He also continued his success against NL East teams, posting a 3.25 ERA against them. Though he had much success, he remained inconsistent, playing \\"the role Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde personified\\" ‚Äì in 17 of his starts, he allowed two or fewer earned runs, and posted a combined 1.73 ERA in those starts, while in the eight starts during which he surrendered more than two earned runs, he posted a 10.40 ERA. Middle-of-the-rotation starter: 2013‚Äì14 Milwaukee Brewers on April 8, 2014 Thanks to his strong finish in 2012, Kendrick entered spring training assured of a spot in the Phillies' Opening Day starting rotation for the first time in five years and spent his first full season exclusively a member of the major league starting rotation. His 2013 season took the opposite trajectory of his 2012 campaign; he held a 4‚Äì1 record with a 2.47 ERA in his first eight starts, while he posted a 6‚Äì12 record with a 5.65 ERA in his final 22 starts. Some suggested that because Kendrick is a contact pitcher (i.e., he focuses on getting outs via batters hitting the ball rather than striking out), his career-worst batting average on balls in play indicated horrendous defense was the primary reason for his downturn, not necessarily poor pitching. However, both were likely contributing factors. On September 18, he was scratched from his scheduled start due to right rotator cuff tendinitis, which may have contributed to his poor pitching down the stretch. It was the first time in Kendrick's career he missed a start due to injury. He had initially planned on making his next start, but the Phillies announced on September 20 that Kendrick had been shut down for the remainder of the season after receiving a second opinion on the injury. The team placed him on the disabled list for his first career stint and Zach Miner took his spot in the rotation. Overall, he posted 10‚Äì13 with a 4.70 ERA in 182 innings pitched. At the conclusion of the 2013 season, there was suggestion that the Phillies should re-sign Kendrick insofar as he would serve as a useful player to trade around the trade deadline for a prospect or two, as durable, mediocre starters are always in demand around that time. Contradictorily, one scout suggested that because he throws strikes with great frequency and has a propensity to induce groundballs, he would be a strong value option for the Phillies. Ultimately, the Phillies agreed with the latter, and signed him to a one-year, contract in the final year before he is eligible to be a free agent. Kendrick preposterously struggled all season in the first inning, entering his final home start of the season with a 9.31 ERA in the first inning. Overall, he pitched a career-high 199 innings, but posted a 4.61 ERA, second-worst among qualifying NL starting pitchers. The prevailing consensus was that despite a sentimental attachment to Philadelphia, generally being liked by Phillies' fans, and solid contributions to the back of the Phillies' rotation since arriving in the major leagues, he was unlikely to return to Philadelphia for 2015, but would be a \\"smart pickup\\" by a contending team. Colorado Rockies Kendrick signed a one-year deal with the Colorado Rockies on February 4, 2015. He was later named the Rockies' opening-day starter for the 2015 season. For the season, he was 7-13 with a 6.32 ERA, and shared the major league lead in home runs given up with 33. Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim On December 31, 2015, Kendrick signed a minor league contract with the Atlanta Braves. In addition, Kendrick received a non-roster invite to spring training. He was released on March 12, 2016. He signed with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, and spent the 2016 season with the Salt Lake Bees of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League. Boston Red Sox On January 18, 2017, Kendrick signed a minor league contract with the Boston Red Sox. He received a non-roster invite to spring training, and was later placed on the Major League roster. Kendrick started two games for the Red Sox in May, accruing a 0‚Äì2 record and 12.96 ERA. The 2017 season also saw him starting 18 games for the Triple-A Pawtucket Red Sox. Kendrick was outrighted on June 22, and elected free agency on October 2. Kendrick elected retirement but after sitting out the 2018 season, he became a guest instructor at Phillies‚Äô 2019 Spring Training. Pitching style Kendrick pitches from a deliberate, slightly deceptive delivery; here he is in a game in September 2013 When Kendrick was first promoted to the major leagues, he relied almost exclusively on a sinker, but as he became more predictable, he had to adjust by adding pitches, including the changeup, cutter, and curveball that now comprise his repertoire. He throws from a slightly deceptive, deliberate windup, and his sinker ranges anywhere from to . He lacks requisite confidence in his secondary pitches, however, which contributes to batters being able to consistently make solid contact against him. Although they have improved throughout his career, Kendrick has had poor peripheral statistics, including WAR, FIP and BABIP. Because he manages to stay competitive on the mound and do his job, most assert that the poor peripheral statistics do not matter for him. When pitching, he maintains constant equanimity and seeks to avoid showing emotion, a trait he learned from his father and has embodied since playing Little League Baseball. He credits his composure as the reason he is able to consistently \\"go with the flow\\", and avoid being flustered, even in adverse situations. Personal life In 2009, Kendrick became engaged to three-time Survivor contestant Stephenie LaGrossa. They were married at the Silverado Resort in Napa, California, on November 13, 2010. Kendrick and LaGrossa had their first child, a daughter named Sophia Marguerite on September 3, 2011, and their second child, a son named Kyle Jr., on July 30, 2013. In March 2011, his home was burglarized; among the stolen items was his World Series ring. Subsequently, the ring was found in a swampy area of Bothell, Washington, by Snohomish County Sheriff's deputies. His pitching intro music is \\"Radioactive\\" by Imagine Dragons. Among his hobbies are golf and fantasy football.

History Ambrose University is the product of similar educational journeys begun in the second half of the twentieth century. The Christian and Missionary Alliance established the Canadian Bible Institute in Regina, Saskatchewan in 1941. It was established under the founding leadership of Gordon Skitch, superintendent of the Western Canadian District of the Christian and Missionary Alliance (C&MA;), Willis Brooks, pastor of the Regina Alliance Tabernacle and well-known radio pastor, and George Blackett, who had served as the principal of Winnipeg Bible Institute and became the first principal, then president, of the Institute. In 1949, it was recognized by Saskatchewan and renamed Western Canadian Bible Institute (WCBI). It was renamed again in 1957 as the Canadian Bible College (CBC) of the Christian and Missionary Alliance (C&MA;) and, in the 1960s, became associated with the University of Regina. Canadian Theological College (CTC) was established in 1970 as a graduate sister school to CBC, and was renamed Canadian Theological Seminary (CTS) in 1982. Similarly but independently, the Calgary Bible Institute was first established in 1921 in the basement of the Calgary First Church of the Nazarene. In 1927, the school relocated to Red Deer, where it became known as Alberta School of Evangelism, and then Northern Bible College (NBC) with the construction of a new campus. In 1940, it was renamed again as Canadian Nazarene College (CNC) as it began offering theology degrees. In 1960, CNC moved to Winnipeg and was established as the official Canadian university college for the Church of the Nazarene. Dr. Riley Coulter, President of CNC, determined that Manitoba would not accredit private institutions of higher education in the liberal arts and sciences. CNC thus moved back to its first home, Calgary, in 1995, became an accredited university college in 1999, and changed its name to Nazarene University College (NUC). Dr. George Durance, President of CBC/CTS, came to similar realizations regarding the accreditation status of his school in Saskatchewan and, in 2000, CBC/CTS made a similar decision. In 2003, CBC/CTS officially relocated to join NUC on the same campus, received accreditation in 2004, and changed its name to Alliance University College (AUC). AUC and NUC maintained a close relationship and were often referred to as Alliance University College-Nazarene University College (AUC-NUC), though the two granted degrees independently until 2007. In 2007, Alliance University College and Nazarene University College became a single entity, known as Ambrose University College, in honour of Ambrose. A new campus opened in west Calgary in November 2008. In 2012 Gordon T. Smith was named president. In 2014, Premier and Minister of Innovation and Advanced Education Dave Hancock approved the change of name to Ambrose University, dropping the word \\"College\\" to better reflect the nature of the institution. Ambrose University is an affiliate of the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities. Affiliation Ambrose is the official Canadian school of both the Church of the Nazarene and The Christian and Missionary Alliance. It is one of 10 colleges and universities affiliated with the Church of the Nazarene in North America and one of 8 colleges and universities affiliated with The Christian and Missionary Alliance. In terms of its affiliation with the Nazarene church, AUC (formerly Canadian Nazarene University College) is the college for the Canada Region.Nazarene Educational Regions Academics Ambrose University provides undergraduate education and graduate level education for pastoral ministry, as well as undergraduate level education in select liberal arts and science degrees. Their mission is to \\"produce graduates who are consciously and actively Christian in all aspects of life,\\" and to \\"serve the church by providing excellent preparation for pastoral ministry.\\"The Vision Ambrose is accredited by the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada to offer its Seminary degrees. Ambrose is also accredited by the Association for Biblical Higher Education to offer undergraduate ministry and theology degrees, and by the Province of Alberta as pertains to its authority in the conferring of Bachelor of Arts degrees in selected disciplines.

It causes bakanae disease in rice seedlings. Rice infected with Bakane Disease Another name is foolish seedling disease. It gets that name because the seeds can be infected, leading to disparate outcomes for the plant. There are not many diseases that initiate similar symptoms as bakanae.  Hosts and symptoms  Gibberella fujikuroi is most widely known for its disease producing capabilities in rice, but barley, millet, sugarcane and maize are also susceptible.Hsuan HM, Salleh B, Zakaria L. Molecular Identification of Fusarium Species inGibberella fujikuroi Species Complex from Rice, Sugarcane and Maize from Peninsular Malaysia. International Journal of Molecular Sciences. 2011;12(10):6722-6732. doi:10.3390/ijms12106722. In all infected plants, similar symptoms have been found, though rice has been most predominantly studied. The most telltale symptom of Bakanae is the tall, spindly look of the plant. This is a result of the gibberellins, or growth hormones, the fungus secretes.Zbornik Matice srpske za prirodne nauke / Proc. Natl. Sci, Matica Srpska Novi Sad, ¬• 116, 175‚Äî182, 2009 Infected plants are easy to pick out, then, as they often rise above the rest of the healthy plants with regularly secreted growth hormones. However, it is also possible that stunting may occur, along with Chlorosis of the leaves of the plant, root lesions, or empty grains of plants grown to maturity.  Disease cycle  Gibberella fujikuroi is a polycyclic ascomycete. Thus, it is possible to, at the right stage of the lifecycle of the pathogen, see perithecia or conidia under the microscope.BAKANAE OF RICE - AN EMERGING DISEASE IN ASIA A. K. Gupta, I. S. Solanki, B. M. Bashyal, Y. Singh and K. Srivastava The pathogen overwinters in perithecia and will infect through soil in seeds that are not pre-infected. Infected seed is also a source of inoculum; conidia will germinate when planted. Infected seeds are the main way the disease is propagated. Symptoms can be observed during growing season.  Environment  Bakanae is observed in all rice growing areas of the world. Thus, the pathogen thrives in the same growing conditions as rice. Rice requires a warm, wet growing season. Fields may even be flooded. The disease is known to be able to spread through water. Additionally, infected spores can be spread during harvesting. Thus, it is important to quarantine the infected seeds.  Management  There have been many management solutions put forth, with the most important and widely used being the use of treated seeds. Growers should confer with the source of their seeds and as a second measure, check the weight of the seeds they receive. Lightweight seeds are typically infected.H. Saremi, A. Ammarellou, A. Marefat and S.M. Okhovvat, 2008. Binam a Rice Cultivar, Resistant for Root Rot Disease on Rice Caused by Fusarium moniliforme in Northwest, Iran. International Journal of Botany, 4: 383-389. Seeds can also be treated to prevent pathogen activation. There are two options that have been found to be successful: hot water baths and chlorine treatments. However, one cannot be sure that the pathogen will be fully neutralized when subjected to these conditions. Resistance in rice has also been studied. Specifically, the Binam cultivar has been found to be the most resistant to the disease, thus producing the largest yield in experiments when the disease was purposefully induced. Other varieties have shown partial resistance, but none as strong as Binam. One new option that is under investigation for management potential is treating the seeds with silver nanoparticles. The particles are a known antifungal that are not toxic to humans.Young-Ki jo et al. Crop Environment Research Division, National Institute of Crop Science, Rural Development Administration, Suwon, Republic of Korea In one study, treatment with the particles reduced the incidence of the disease significantly.  Importance  In rice crops, this disease has made a staggering economic impact. Losses have been specifically high in Asian countries, namely India, Thailand, and Japan.https://www.cropscience.bayer.com/en/crop-compendium/pests-diseases- weeds/diseases/gibberella-fujikuroi Specifically, Basmati rice has been a main target for Gibberella fujikuroi. At times, growers have lost up to 50% of their crop. However, rates of disease are not often so high and only occur during epidemic years. Luckily, attempts at management have found success in the past and new treatments are continually researched. Growers can be confident that they will find an option to deal with this disease if it is present in their crop, if not initially, then hopefully by the next growing season.  Pathogenesis  The pathogen induces excessive gibberellin production in the plant, resulting in the rapid growth of the hosts. The amount of Gibberellin is important in determining the extent of the disease. Another interaction between the plant and pathogen is the sporulation of mycelium at the lower levels of the plant - white fungal masses can be observed. Conidia, the secondary inoculum, are the end result of these spore masses.

Despite her old age, she worked hard to raise Hagop, his younger sister, and brother. A few years later Hagop was placed in a youth shelter maintained by the Armenian Relief Society. He became a student at the then newly found school, Karen Yeppe, where he proved to be a bright and eager learner. After completing his secondary education, he enrolled in the local French Lycee where he received his Baccalaureate Part II in the field of Philosophy. In 1960, Hagop settled in the United States, in San Francisco, California. There he attended San Francisco State University where he earned a BS (1964) followed by an MA (1969) in International World Trade. The focus for his thesis was the European Common Market. On April 19, 1969, Hagop married Anais Bohjelian, originally from Alexandria, Egypt, who was living and studying in the U.S. In 1972 Hagop relocated to New York City to resume his education. In 1975 he received his second MA in Middle East History from New York University. Five years later, in 1980, he earned his Ph.D. from Columbia University in Ottoman History.

Peak demand is typically characterized as annual, daily or seasonal and has the unit of power. Peak demand, peak load or on-peak are terms used in energy demand management describing a period in which electrical power is expected to be provided for a sustained period at a significantly higher than average supply level. Peak demand fluctuations may occur on daily, monthly, seasonal and yearly cycles. For an electric utility company, the actual point of peak demand is a single half-hour or hourly period which represents the highest point of customer consumption of electricity. At this time there is a combination of office, domestic demand and at some times of the year, the fall of darkness. Some utilities will charge customers based on their individual peak demand. The highest demand during each month or even a single 15 to 30 minute period of highest use in the previous year may be used to calculate charges. The renewable energy transition will include considerations for peak demand. Economic growth of the state is inversely associated with peak load.  Demand Tariff  Electricity network is built to deal with the highest possible peak demand otherwise blackout may happen. In Australia, demand tariff has three components: peak demand charge, energy charge and daily connection charge. For example, for large customers (commercial,industrial or mixed of commercial/residential), the peak demand charge is based on the highest 30 minutes electricity consumption in a month; the energy charge is based on a month electricity consumption. This type of demand tariff is gradually introduced to residential households and will be rolled out by 2020 in Queensland Australia. How to manage electricity bills under demand tariff can be challenging. The key solutions involve improving building efficiency and managing the operational settings of large power appliances.L. Liu, W. Miller, and G. Ledwich. (2017) Solutions for reducing electricity costs for communal facilities. Australian Ageing Agenda. 39-40. Available: https://www.australianageingagenda.com.au/2017/10/27/solutions-reducing- facility-electricity-costs/  When is the peak electricity demand? It depends on the demography, the economy, the weather, the climate, the season, the day of the week and other factors. For example, in industrialised regions of China or Germany, the peak demands mostly occur in day time, while solar photovoltaic system can help reduce it. However, in more service based economy such as Australia, the daily peak demands often occur in the late afternoon to early evening time (e.g. 4pm to 8pm). Residential and commercial electricity demand contributes a lot to this type of network peak demand.L. Liu, M. Shafiei, G. Ledwich, W. Miller, and G. Nourbakhsh, \\"Correlation Study of Residential Community Demand with High PV Penetration,\\" Australasian Universities Power Engineering Conference, p. 6  Off-peak  Peak demand is considered to be the opposite to off-peak hours when power demand is usually low. There are off-peak time-of-use rates. Sometimes, there are 3 time-of-use zones: peak, shoulder and offpeak. Shoulder is often the time between peak and offpeak in weekdays. Weekends are often just peak and offpeak in terms of managing electricity loads for the network. Response Typical daily consumption of electrical power in Germany The maximum demand dictates the size of generators, transmission lines, transformers and circuit breakers for utilities even if that amount lasts just one hour per year. Natural gas fueled power generators must all have adequately sized pipelines. Power generation which is able to be rapidly ramped up for peak demand often uses more expensive fuels, is less efficient and has higher marginal carbon emissions. Peak demand may exceed the maximum supply levels that the electrical power industry can generate, resulting in power outages and load shedding. This often occurs during heat waves when use of air conditioners and powered fans raises the rate of energy consumption significantly. During a shortage authorities may request the public to curtail their energy use and shift it to a non-peak period. Power stations Power stations specifically constructed for providing power to electrical grids for peak demand are called peaking power plants or 'peakers'. In general, Natural gas fueled power stations can be fired up rapidly and are therefore often utilized at peak demand times. Combined cycle power plants can frequently provide power for peak demand, as well as run efficiently for baseload power. Hydroelectric power and pumped storage type dams such as Carters Dam in the U.S. state of Georgia help to meet peak demand as well. The chances that a wind farm will be unable to meet peak demand are greater than for a fossil-fueled power station, due to the ability to store liquid fuels for use during peak demand. Solar power's peak output often naturally coincides with daytime peaks of usage due to air conditioning.

Between 2011 and 2015 she was the social policies director in the Directorate for Employment and Social affairs for the European Commissionin charge of social policies,poverty eradication ,pensions,health and social protection. Before that she was director for communication and representations in the EC's communication directorate for more than 500 networks across the European Union and from 1987 till 1997 she wss head of unit for human development in the European Commissions department for development. Career Fransen started her career as a physician in Africa during the 1970s and 1980s (mainly in Mozambique, Kenya and Rwanda), with a particular interest in sexually transmitted infections. In several African countries she developed new initiatives and ensured implementation through international cooperation and strategic planning. In 1987, the European Commission hired Fransen as a consultant from the Institute of Tropical Medicine Antwerp to survey blood transfusion and HIV seropositive rates in Uganda. This led the European Commission in 1987 to help Uganda set up a safe blood supply, and then to create the AIDS Task Force, an international foundation of which Fransen was the founding executive director. In 2000, giving evidence to the UK House of Commons International Development Committee, Jeff O' Malley, the founding director of the International HIV/AIDS Alliance, referred to Fransen as \\"the EC's HIV/AIDS expert\\". In 1993 she joined the European Commission as the Head of the Health, AIDS and Population Sector. Glenys Kinnock MEP noted that, following Fransen's appointment to the EC in 1987, spending on the EC's Health, HIV/AIDS and population programmes \\"had increased from 1 per cent of EC aid in 1986 to more than 8 per cent in 1998\\". Fransen was in charge of negotiating tiered pricing for pharmaceutical products for developing countries; by 2002, however, she saw the debate on tiered pricing as becoming too difficult and too legalistic, and believed that more needed to be done to ensure access to medicines at cheaper prices in developing countries than in the West. During this period, she was also guest editor for the World Bank's policy research department. In 2001 she became head of the social and human development unit at the EC's Directorate-General for International Cooperation and Development, in charge of social protection, employment, health, education and gender. She was a founding board member and board vice-chair of the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM), representing the European Commission and several EU member states from 2000 to 2007, where she helped create a large public/private partnership and performance-based fund, which approved around $7 billion in grants over four years.

It is part of Yare Broads and Marshes Site of Special Scientific Interest Situated north of the village of Surlingham and south of the River Yare, it comprises 68 acres (28 hectares) of mixed wetland habitat including shallow open water, dykes, reed and sedge fen, and small areas of willow carr, as well as deciduous woodland on the southern margin of the reserve. A footpath of about 1¬º miles circumnavigates the reserve from Surlingham Church, down and along the river Yare and a hide overlooks a shallow pool within the reserve. There is a no fishing policy on the river bank within the reserve. Dogs are allowed but should be kept under control. Notable amongst the breeding birds are gadwall, shovellers, and reed, sedge, grasshopper and Cetti's warblers. Marsh harriers are regular visitors and occasionally breed. Migrants include Jack snipe and green sandpiper, and winter visitors include hen harriers and bearded tits. The reserve also supports several species of dragonfly, and a variety of butterflies, various other insects and invertebrates, and many species of wild flower, orchid, and particularly aquatic plants. Purchased in 1984 as a potential habitat for marsh harriers and bitterns, the reserve is now managed mostly for its fen plant communities and the invertebrates which feed off them. Water levels are managed by the use of a sluice gate. A small number of highland cattle summer graze on the fen to improve habitat quality and to assist with the removal of scrub from the fen.

Eventually, parishes and dioceses would be organized worldwide, often after an intermediate phase as an apostolic prefecture or apostolic vicariate. Catholic mission has predominantly been carried out by the Latin Church in practice. In the Roman Curia, missionary work is organised by the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples. History New Testament times The New Testament missionary outreach of the Christian church from the time of St Paul was extensive throughout the Roman Empire. Middle Ages During the Middle Ages Christian monasteries and missionaries such as Saint Patrick and Adalbert of Prague propagated learning and religion beyond the boundaries of the old Roman Empire. In the seventh century Gregory the Great sent missionaries, including Augustine of Canterbury, into England. The Hiberno-Scottish mission began in 563. In the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries, Franciscans such as William of Rubruck, John of Montecorvino, and Giovanni ed' Magnolia were sent as missionaries to the Near and Far East. Their travels took them as far as China in an attempt to convert the advancing Mongols, especially the Great Khans of the Mongol Empire. (Also see Catholic Church in China.) Age of Discovery During the Age of Discovery, the Roman Catholic Church established a number of missions in the Americas and other colonies through the Augustinians, Franciscans, and Dominicans in order to spread Christianity in the New World and to convert the indigenous peoples of the Americas and other indigenous people. At the same time, missionaries such as Francis Xavier as well as other Jesuits, Augustinians, Franciscans, and Dominicans were moving into Asia and the Far East. The Portuguese sent missions into Africa. These are some of the most well-known missions in history. In the empires ruled by both Portugal and Spain, religion was an integral part of the state and evangelization was seen as having both secular and spiritual benefits. Wherever these powers attempted to expand their territories or influence, missionaries would soon follow. By the Treaty of Tordesillas, the two powers divided the world between them into exclusive spheres of influence, trade, and colonization. The Roman Catholic world order was challenged by the Netherlands and England. Theoretically, it was repudiated by Grotius's Mare Liberum. Portugal's and Spain's colonial policies were also challenged by the Roman Catholic Church itself. The Vatican founded the Congregatio de Propaganda Fide in 1622 and attempted to separate the churches from the influence of the Iberian kingdoms. While missions in areas ruled by Spanish and Portuguese, and to a lesser extent, the French, are associated with cultural imperialism and oppression, and often operated under the sponsorship and consent of colonial governments, those in other portions of the world (notably Matteo Ricci's Jesuit mission to China, and the work of other Jesuit missionaries in the Nagasaki region in Japan) were focused on the conversion of individuals within existing social and political structures, and often operated without the consent of local government. India Early missionaries John of Monte Corvino was a Franciscan sent to China to become prelate of Peking in around 1307. He traveled from Persia and moved down by sea to India in 1291, to the Madras region or \\"Country of St. Thomas\\". There he preached for thirteen months and baptized about one hundred people. From there Monte Corvino wrote home, in December 1291 (or 1292), giving one of the earliest noteworthy accounts of the Coromandel coast furnished by any Western European. Traveling by sea from Mailapur, he reached China in 1294, appearing in the capital \\"Cambaliech\\" (now Beijing).Odoric of Pordenone (Nendeln, Liechtenstein, 1967), Henry Yule, trans. Cathy and the Way Thither vol. II, p. 142. Friar Odoric of Pordenone arrived in India in 1321. He visited Malabar, touching at Pandarani (20 m. north of Calicut) at Cranganore and at Kulam or Quilon, proceeding thence, apparently, to Ceylon and to the shrine of St Thomas at Maylapur near Madras. He writes that he had found the place where Thomas was buried. The French Dominican missionary Father Jordanus Catalani followed in 1321‚Äì22. He reported to Rome, apparently from somewhere on the west coast of India, that he had given Christian burial to four martyred monks. Jordanus is known for his 1329 Mirabilia describing the marvels of the East: he furnished the best account of Indian regions and the Christians, the products, climate, manners, customs, fauna and flori given by any European in the Middle Ages ‚Äì superior even to Marco Polo‚Äôs. In 1347, Giovanni de Marignolli visited the shrine of St Thomas near the modern Madras, and then proceeded to what he calls the kingdom of Saba and identifies with the Sheba of Scripture, but which seems from various particulars to have been Java. Taking ship again for Malabar on his way to Europe, he encountered great storms. Another prominent Indian traveler was Joseph, priest over Cranganore. He journeyed to Babylon in 1490 and then sailed to Europe and visited Portugal, Rome, and Venice before returning to India. He helped to write a book about his travels entitled The Travels of Joseph the Indian which was widely disseminated across Europe. Arrival of the Portuguese The introduction of Catholicism in India begins from the first decade of 1500, with the arrival of the Portuguese missionaries there. In the 16th century, the proselytization of Asia was linked to the Portuguese colonial policy.

Reprint edition, 4 vols., (October 2004),Lawbook Exchange, written on 8 January 1455 by Pope Nicholas V to King Afonso V of Portugal, the patronage for the propagation of the Christian faith (see \\"Padroado\\") in Asia was given to the Portuguese, who were rewarded with the right of conquest. The missionaries of the different orders (Franciscans, Dominicans, Jesuits, Augustinians, etc.) flocked out with the conquerors, and began at once to build churches along the coastal districts wherever the Portuguese power made itself felt. The history of Portuguese missionaries in India starts with the neo-apostles who reached Kappad near Kozhikode on 20 May 1498 along with Vasco da Gama,Factfile: Roman Catholics around the world on BBC news. which represented less than 2% of the total populationMegan Galbraith Catholic Church of India Responds with Leadership Field note on Glocal Health Council website. and was the largest Christian church within India. He was seeking to form anti-Islamic alliances with pre-existing Christian nations. The lucrative spice trade attracted the Portuguese crown.Vasco da Gama collection on University of Michigan During the second expedition under Captain Pedro √Ålvares Cabral, the Portuguese fleet consisted of 13 ships and 18 priests anchored at Cochin on 26 November 1500. Cabral soon won the goodwill of the Raja of Cochin who allowed four priests to do apostolic work among the early Christian communities scattered in and around Cochin. Thus missionaries established a Portuguese mission in 1500. Dom Francisco de Almeida, the first Portuguese Viceroy, got permission from the Kochi Raja to build two church edifices ‚Äì Santa Cruz Basilica (1505) and St. Francis Church (1506) using stones and mortar which were unheard of at that time, as local prejudices were against such a structure except for a royal palace or a temple. In the beginning of the 16th century, the whole of the East was under the jurisdiction of the Archdiocese of Lisbon. On 12 June 1514, Cochin and Goa became two prominent mission stations under the newly created Diocese of Funchal in Madeira, in the Atlantic. In 1534 Pope Paul III by the Bull Quequem Reputamus raised Funchal to an archdiocese with Goa as its suffragan, placing the whole of India under the diocese of Goa. This created an episcopal see ‚Äì suffragan to Funchal, with a jurisdiction extending potentially over all past and future conquests from the Cape of Good Hope to China. After four decades of prosperous trading, the missionaries started the proselytization around 1540 and the newly founded Society of Jesus arrived in Goa. The Portuguese colonial government supported the mission and the baptized Christians were given incentives like rice donations and good positions in their colonies. Hence, these Christians were dubbed Rice Christians, and might have continued in their old religious practices. At the same time many New Christians from Portugal migrated to India as a result of the inquisition in Portugal. Many of them were suspected of being Crypto-Jews, converted Jews who were secretly practicing their old religion, and were considered a threat to the solidarity of Christian belief. Saint Francis Xavier, in a 1545 letter to John III of Portugal, requested the Goan Inquisition,Paul Axelrod, Michelle A. Fuerch Flight of the Deities: Hindu Resistance in Portuguese Goa Modern Asian Studies, Vol. 30, No. 2 (May, 1996), pp. 387‚Äì421 which is considered a blot on the history of Roman Catholic Christianity in India, both by Christians and non-Christians alike. In 1557 Goa was made an independent archbishopric, with suffragan sees at Cochin and Malacca. The whole of the East was under the jurisdiction of Goa and its boundaries extended to almost half of the world: from the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, to Burma, China, and Japan in East Asia. In 1576 the suffragan See of Macao (China) was added, and in 1588 that of Funai in Japan. In 1597 the death of the last metropolitan bishop, Archdeacon Abraham of the Saint Thomas Christians, an ancient body formerly part of the Church of the EastFrykenberg, p. 93.Wilmshurst, EOCE, 343 gave the then Archbishop of Goa Menezes an opportunity to bring the native church under the authority of the Roman Catholic Church. He was able to secure the submission of Archdeacon George, the highest remaining representative of the native church hierarchy. Menezes convened the Synod of Diamper between 20 and 26 June 1599,Synod of Diamper on Synod of Diamper Church website. which introduced a number of reforms to the church and brought it fully into the Latin Rite of the Catholic Church. Following the Synod, Menezes consecrated Jesuit Francis Ros as Archbishop of the Archdiocese of Angamal√© for the Saint Thomas Christians ‚Äì another suffragan see to Archdiocese of Goa ‚Äì and Latinisation of St Thomas Christians started. Most eventually accepted the Catholic faith but some switched to West Syrian rite. The Saint Thomas Christians were pressured to acknowledge the authority of the Pope. Resentment of these measures led to some part of the community to join the Archdeacon Thomas in swearing never to submit to the Portuguese or to accept Communion with Rome, in the Coonan Cross Oath in 1653. The Diocese of Angamaly was transferred to Diocese of Craganore in 1605, and in 1606 a sixth suffragan see to Goa was established at San Thome, Mylapore, near the modern Madras. The suffragan sees added later to Goa were the prelacy of Mozambique in 1612 and Peking and Nanking in China in 1690. Missionary work progressed on a large scale and with great success along the western coasts, chiefly at Chaul, Bombay, Salsette, Bassein, Damao, and Diu, as well as on the eastern coasts at San Thome of Mylapore as far as Bengal. In the southern districts the Jesuit mission in Madura was the most famous. It extended to the Krishna River, with a number of outlying stations beyond it. The mission of Cochin on the Malabar Coast was also one of the most fruitful. Several missions were also established in the interior northwards, e.g., that of Agra and Lahore in 1570 and that of Tibet in 1624. Still, even with these efforts, the greater part even of the coast line was by no means fully worked, and many vast tracts of the interior northwards were practically untouched. With the decline of Portuguese power other colonial powers ‚Äì the Dutch and British and Christian organisations ‚Äì gained influence. Japan Portuguese shipping arrived in Japan in 1543Ruiz-de-Medina, Father Juan G., Documentos de Japon, Rome 1990, 1995) and Catholic missionary activities in Japan began in earnest around 1549, performed in the main by Portuguese-sponsored Jesuits until Spanish- sponsored mendicant orders such as the Franciscans and Dominicans gained access to Japan. Of the 95 Jesuits who worked in Japan up to 1600, 57 were Portuguese, 20 were Spaniards and 18 Italian.Ruiz-de-Medina, Father Juan G., Cultural Interactions in the Orient 30 years before Matteo Ricci. Catholic Uni. of Portugal, 1993. Jesuit Fathers Francisco Xavier,Catholic Encyclopedia, 1909 on St. Francis XavierSaint Francis Xavier on Catholic Forum Cosme de Torres, and John Fernandes were the first to arrive at Kagoshima with hopes of bringing Christianity and Catholicism to Japan. Spain and Portugal disputed the attribution of Japan. Since neither could colonize it, the exclusive right to propagate Christianity in Japan meant the exclusive right to trade with Japan. Portuguese-sponsored Jesuits under Alessandro Valignano took the lead in proselytizing in Japan over the objection of the Spaniards. This fait accompli was approved in Pope Gregory XIII's papal bull of 1575, which decided that Japan belonged to the Portuguese diocese of Macau. In 1588 the diocese of Funai (Nagasaki) was founded under Portuguese protection. In rivalry with the Jesuits, Spanish-sponsored mendicant orders entered Japan via Manila. While criticizing Jesuit activities, they actively lobbied the Pope. Their campaigns resulted in Pope Clement VIII's decree of 1600 which allowed Spanish friars to enter Japan via the Portuguese Indies, and Pope Paul V's decree of 1608 which abolished the restrictions on the route. The Portuguese accused Spanish Jesuits of working for their homeland instead of their patron. frontispiece of Athanasius Kircher's 1667 China Illustrata, depicting Francis Xavier and Ignatius of Loyola adoring the monogram of Christ in Heaven while Johann Adam Schall von Bell and Matteo Ricci labor on the Jesuit China missions below. China The history of the missions of the Society of Jesus or Jesuits in Ming and Qing China stands as one of the notable events in the early history of relations between China and the Western world, as well as a prominent example of relations between two cultures and belief systems in the pre-modern age. The missionary efforts and other work of the Jesuits in 16th, 17th, and 18th century played a significant role in introducing European science and culture to China. Their work laid much of the foundation for much of Christian culture in Chinese society today. Members of the Jesuit delegation to China were perhaps the most influential Christian missionaries in that country between the earliest period of the religion up until the 19th century, when significant numbers of Catholic and Protestant missions developed. A map of the 200-odd Jesuit churches and missions established across China . Confucius, Philosopher of the Chinese, or, Chinese Knowledge Explained in Latin, an introduction to Chinese history and philosophy published at Paris in 1687 by a team of Jesuits working under Philippe Couplet. Charles Maigrot's 1693 Mandate, which reopened the Chinese Rites controversy Despite earlier evangelization under the Tang and Yuan, by the 16th century there is no reliable evidence for any practicing Christians remaining in China. The Portuguese explorer Jorge √Ålvares reached Guangdong in 1513, establishing direct maritime connection between China and Europe; within six years of the Jesuit's 1540 founding, two Chinese boys were enrolled in their college in Goa, India. One of them, known by his baptismal name Antonio, travelled with the Jesuit founder StFrancis Xavier when he tried to begin missionary work in China in the early 1550s. Unable to receive permission to enter the country, however, Xavier died on Shangchuan Island off the coast of Guangdong in 1552. With the Portuguese establishing an enclave on Zhongshan Island's Macau Peninsula, Jesuits established a base nearby on Green Island (now the SAR's \\"Ilha Verde\\" neighborhood). Alessandro Valignano, the new regional manager (\\"visitor\\") of the order, came to Macau in 1578‚Äì1579 and established St. Paul's College to begin training future missionaries in the language and culture of the Chinese. He requested assistance from the orders' members in Goa in bringing over suitably talented linguists to staff the college and begin the mission in earnest. In 1582, Jesuits once again initiated mission work inside China, introducing Western science, mathematics, astronomy, and cartography. Missionaries such as Matteo Ricci and Johann Adam Schall von Bell wrote Chinese catechisms. and made influential converts like Xu Guangqi, establishing Christian settlements throughout the country and becoming close to the imperial court, particularly its Ministry of Rites, which oversaw official astronomy and astrology. \\"Jesuits were accepted in late Ming court circles as foreign literati, regarded as impressive especially for their knowledge of astronomy, calendar-making, mathematics, hydraulics, and geography.\\"Patricia Buckley Ebrey, The Cambridge Illustrated History of China. Cambridge, New York and Melbourne: Cambridge University Press, 1996. . p. 212. By 1610, more than two thousand Chinese from all levels of society had converted. Clark has summarized as follows: > \\"When all is said and done, one must recognize gladly that the Jesuits made > a shining contribution to mission outreach and policy in China. They made no > fatal compromises, and where they skirted this in their guarded > accommodation to the Chinese reverence for ancestors, their major thrust was > both Christian and wise. They succeeded in rendering Christianity at least > respectable and even credible to the sophisticated Chinese, no mean > accomplishment.\\"George H. Dunne, Generation of Giants, pp. 86‚Äì88. This influence worked in both directions: Ricci and others including Michele Ruggieri, Philippe Couplet, and Fran√ßois No√´l undertook a century-long effort in translating the Chinese classics into Latin and spreading knowledge of Chinese culture and history in Europe, influencing its developing Enlightenment.John Parker, Windows into China: the Jesuits and their books, 1580-1730. Boston: Trustees of the Public Library of the City of Boston, 1978. p.25. John Hobson, The Eastern origins of Western Civilization, pp. 194-195. The introduction of the Franciscans and other orders of missionaries, however, led to a long-running controversy over Chinese customs and names for God. The Jesuits, the secularized mandarins, and eventually the Kangxi Emperor himself maintained that Chinese veneration of ancestors and Confucius were respectful but nonreligious rituals compatible with Christian doctrine; other orders pointed to the beliefs of the common people of China to show that it was impermissible idolatry and that the common Chinese names for God confused the Creator with His creation. Acting on the complaint of the Bishop of Fujian,.. finally ended the dispute with a decisive ban in 1704;. his legate Charles- Thomas Maillard De Tournon issued summary and automatic excommunication of any Christian permitting Confucian rituals as soon as word reached him in 1707.. By that time, however, Tournon and Bishop Maigrot had displayed such extreme ignorance in questioning before the throne that the Kangxi Emperor mandated the expulsion of Christian missionaries unable to abide by the terms of Ricci's Chinese catechism... Tournon's policies, confirmed by Clement's 1715 bull Ex Illa Die..., led to the swift collapse of all of the missions across China, with the last Jesuits‚Äîobliged to maintain allegiance to the papal rulings‚Äîfinally being expelled after 1721.. Although Catholic mission work began again following the opening up of the country after the First Opium War in the 1830s, it was not until 1939 that the church revisited its stance on Chinese customs. Pope Pius XII's initial move towards greater leniency was subsequently confirmed and expanded by Vatican II. Maya There are records of Franciscan activity on the Americas as early as 1519. Throughout the early 16th century the mission movement spread from the Caribbean to Mexico, Central America, parts of South America, and the Southwest United States.Habig 1945:342 The goal of the Franciscan missions was to spread the Christian faith to the people of the New World through \\"word and example\\".Clendinnen 1982 Spreading Christianity to the newly discovered continent was a top priority, but only one piece of the Spanish colonization system. The influence of the Franciscans, considering that missionaries are sometimes seen as tools of imperialism,Grahm 1998: 28 enabled other objectives to be reached, such as the extension of Spanish language, culture, and political control to the New World. A goal was to change the agricultural or nomadic Indian into a model of the Spanish people and society. Basically, the aim was for urbanization. The missions achieved this by ‚Äúoffering gifts and persuasion‚Ä¶and safety from enemies.‚Äù This protection also offered security for the Spanish military operation, since there would be theoretically less warring if the natives were pacified. Thus the missionaries assisted with another aim of the colonizers.Lee 1990:44 California Mission San Juan Capistrano in April 2005. At left is the fa√ßade of the first adobe church with its added espada√±a; behind the campanario or \\"bell wall\\" is the \\"Sacred Garden,\\" in what is reputed as the \\"Loveliest of the Franciscan Ruins.\\" habits, in contrast to the brown cassocks that are typically worn today.Kelsey, p. 18 Between 1769 and 1823, Spanish members of the Franciscan Order established and operated 21 missions in California to convert the Native Americans. This was the first major effort by Europeans to colonize the Pacific Coast region and gave Spain a valuable toehold on this frontier. The settlers introduced European livestock, fruits, vegetables, and industry but Spanish occupation also brought negative consequences to the native populations. Today the missions are among the state's oldest structures and most-visited historic monuments; many of them also remain in operation as Catholic churches. New Mexico The missions in New Mexico were established by Franciscan friars to convert the local Pueblo, Navajo, and Apaches. The first permanent settlement was Mission San Gabriel in 1598 near what is now known as the San Juan Pueblo. Contemporary missions Catholic missionary work has undergone profound change since the Second Vatican Council.Dignitatis Humanae, 7 December 1965 It has prioritized social justice issues and striven to avoid the dangers of cultural imperialism or economic exploitation that had often accompanied religious conversion. Christian missionaries recognize that working for justice is a constitutive part of preaching the GospelJustice in the World, (1971). World Synod of Catholic Bishops, #6. and usually observe the principles of inculturation in their missionary work. Before Vatican II \\"baptism of desire\\" and salvation outside the Catholic Church were allowed very little scope. With the Council's emphasis on individual conscience,Acts 10:34f; 1Tim 2:4; Lumen Gentium, 1:16; Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1260. baptism is seen not only as the Ordinary means of salvation but as a vocation call for Christians to spread the good news of God's love to all peoples by their practice of true charity, that is universal and inclusive of all God's children.Rom 2:2‚Äì16; Mt 25:31ff The Church on mission through its various religious and lay associations is today much more involved in an option for the poor and integral human development than in proselytizing. In 2016 Pope Francis formed a Department for Promoting Integral Human Development in the Roman Curia to oversee numerous Catholic outreach programs fostered directly by the Vatican. Not that such missions are new; Caritas Internationalis is a confederation of Catholic relief, development, and social service organisations that date back since just after Pope Leo XIII's social encyclical Rerum novarum in 1893. And today Jesuit missions, as in Africa and India, are more involved in educating and further assisting the poorest rural populations, such as the Dalits and Adivasi in India, then in direct conversion efforts. This is true also in China where proselytizing was forbidden but many Christians assisted with language studies. The present practice in Asia and Africa is detailed in the articles on hundreds of educational institutions and development centres that the Jesuits administer. Much the same can be said of other Catholic lay and religious groups and their contemporary missions.

Designed by Catalan artist Jaume Plensa and executed by Krueck and Sexton Architects, it opened in July 2004. The fountain is composed of a black granite reflecting pool placed between a pair of glass brick towers. The towers are tall, and they use light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to display digital videos on their inward faces. Construction and design of the Crown Fountain cost $17 million. The water operates from May to October, intermittently cascading down the two towers and spouting through a nozzle on each tower's front face. Residents and critics have praised the fountain for its artistic and entertainment features. It highlights Plensa's themes of dualism, light, and water, extending the use of video technology from his prior works. Its use of water is unique among Chicago's many fountains, in that it promotes physical interaction between the public and the water. Both the fountain and Millennium Park are highly accessible because of their universal design. Crown Fountain has been one of the most controversial of all the Millennium Park features. Before it was even built, some were concerned that the sculpture's height violated the aesthetic tradition of the park. After construction, surveillance cameras were installed atop the fountain, which led to a public outcry (and their quick removal). However, the fountain has survived its contentious beginnings to find its way into Chicago pop culture. It is a popular subject for photographers and a common gathering place. While some of the videos displayed are of scenery, most attention has focused on its video clips of local residents. The fountain is a public play area and offers people an escape from summer heat, allowing children to frolic in the fountain's water. Concept and design Grant Park, which is between Lake Michigan and the central business district, is commonly called \\"Chicago's Front Yard\\". Its northwest corner had been Illinois Central rail yards and parking lots until 1997, when it was made available for development by the city as Millennium Park. Millennium Park was conceived in 1998 as the capstone of Grant Park, to celebrate the new millennium and to feature world-renowned architects, artists, designers, landscape architects, and urban planners. As of 2007, Millennium Park trails only Navy Pier as a Chicago tourist attraction. The fountain is centrally located in Chicago: it is east of Michigan Avenue and its Historic Michigan Boulevard District, north of Monroe Street and the Art Institute of Chicago; and south of Madison Street. Looking north from the fountain, viewers see some of the tallest buildings in the United States (Aon Center, Two Prudential Plaza, and One Prudential Plaza). Selection of artist In December 1999, Lester Crown and his family agreed to sponsor a water feature in Millennium Park. Unlike other park feature sponsors, the Crowns acted independently of Millennium Park officials; they conducted independent surveys of water technologies, held their own informal design contest, and stayed active in the design and engineering of the project.Gilfoyle, pp. 278‚Äì280. The Crowns were open-minded about the choice of artist; wanting a modern work, they solicited proposals from a list of prospective artists and architects. Jaume Plensa researched the traditions and history of fountains and studied anthropomorphism in fountain imagery. Some of his early ideas for the project referenced Buckingham Fountain, but these were soon abandoned.Gilfoyle, p. 288. His presentation to the Crown family started with a slide show of fountains from the Middle Ages through the 20th century. Plensa focused on the philosophical meanings associated with fountains, their history, use and art.Gilfoyle, p. 287. His presentation included computer animation of facial expressions. The other finalists were Maya Lin, who presented a low-height horizontal form, and Robert Venturi, who presented a fountain that would have been tall. In January 2000, Plensa won the commission to design the fountain over Lin and Venturi.Gilfoyle, p. 280. The installation is a video sculpture, commissioned to operate thirty years. Artistic design theme.|alt=View of the fountain shows glass brick towers from rooftop nearby. alt=Tourists silhouette themselves against the fountain's lighting at night. Prior to Crown Fountain, Plensa's dominant theme had been dualism,Gilfoyle, p. 282. which he had expanded to artworks in which the viewers are outside, and the visible subjects of the art are inside containers and hollow spaces. In the 1990s, he completed several outdoor sculptures in which he explored the use of light (The Star of David (1998) at Stockholm's Raoul Wallenberg Square, Bridge of Light (1998) in Jerusalem), and LED technology, video, and computer design (Gl√§serne Seele & Mr. Net in Brandenburg (1999‚Äì2000)).Gilfoyle, p. 283. In his public art, Plensa challenged himself to involve the viewer with his art, which led to his conception of the Crown Fountain. His objective was to create a socially relevant, interactive fountain for the 21st century.Gilfoyle, p. 285. Since water is the focus of a fountain, and since Chicago, and especially Millennium Park, is so greatly affected by the nearby waterfront, Plensa sought to create an eternal water work to complement the local natural inspirations. Because of the colder winters common to the climate of Chicago, Plensa created a fountain that would remain vibrant when the water was inactive in the wintertime, so the fountain is an experience of light themes and the use of video technology. Plensa explores dualism with Crown Fountain, where he has two randomly selected faces \\"conversing\\" with each other. Plensa feels that by using faces, he can represent the diversity of the city both in ethnicity and in age. The artist intends to portray the sociocultural evolution of the city by updating the collection of images. His representation has become a part of the city's pop culture; the first few episodes of the first season of Prison Break featured shots of the fountain. Plensa feels that the challenge in the creation of successful work of public art is to integrate the viewer into an interactive relationship with the art. The fountain is known for encouraging its visitors to splash and slide in the reflecting pool, jostle for position under the water spout and place themselves under the cascade. This interactivity was to some degree accidental. Although the city planned for some interactivity, the transformation of the fountain into a water park for kids within hours of opening surprised Plensa. Now, when the National Weather Service issues summer heat advisories and the Governor of Illinois declares state office buildings as official daytime cooling centers, the national press points to Crown Fountain as a respite for inhabitants of the Chicago metropolitan area. Video production Approximately 75 ethnic, social, and religious Chicago organizations were asked to provide candidates whose faces would be photographed for integration into the fountain. The subjects were chosen from local schools, churches and community groups, and filming began in 2001 at the downtown campus of the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC). The SAIC students filmed their subjects with a $100,000 high- definition HDW-F900 video camera, the same model used in the production of the three Star Wars prequels. About 20 SAIC students took part in what became an informal master's course in public art for the project.Sharoff, p. 85 Faculty from Columbia College Chicago was also involved in the production of the video. The high-definition equipment was used because of the scale of the project. Because the image proportions were like a movie screen with a width far exceeding its height, the camera was turned on its side during filming. Each face appears on the sculpture for a total of 5 minutes using various parts of individual 80-second videos. A 40-second section is played at one- third speed forward and backward, running for a total of 4 minutes. Then, there is a subsequent segment, where the mouth is puckering, that is stretched to 15 seconds. This is followed by a section, in which the water appears to spout from the open mouth, that is stretched to last for 30 seconds. Finally, there is a smile after the completion of the water spouting from the mouth, that is slowed to extend for 15 seconds. Of the original 1,051 subjects filmed, 960 videos were determined to be usable for the project. Originally, the set of images was presumed to be the beginning of a work in progress, but as of 2009 no additional videos are planned. To achieve the effect in which water appears to be flowing from subjects' mouths, each video has a segment where the subject's lips are puckered, which is then timed to correspond to the spouting water, reminiscent of gargoyle fountains. Each face is cropped so that no hair and usually no ears are visible. Since there is no tripod designed for cameras turned on their sides, an adjustable barber/dentist's chair was used to minimize the need for the movement of the state-of-the-art camera during filming. Nonetheless, in some case, digital manipulation was necessary to properly simulate puckering in the exact proper location on the video. Many of the faces had to be stretched in order to get the mouths properly positioned. Additionally, each video was color-corrected for brightness, contrast and color saturation. Both the playback equipment and the final videos had to be further adjusted to account for sunlight during viewing. Construction and engineering The Crown family, for whom the fountain is named, donated $10 million of the $17 million construction and design cost. The Goodman family, known for funding the Goodman Theatre, was also a large contributor; the entire $17 million cost was provided by private donations. The initial proposed cost for the fountain had been $15 million. After two architectural firms refused the contract to make Plensa's design a reality, the firm Krueck and Sexton Architects accepted. Public art was a departure from Krueck & Sexton's residential and corporate office-dominated portfolio, which includes buildings like the Spertus Institute. Collaboration between the artist, architectural team, and consultants proved to be crucial to the success of the project. The fountain's black granite reflecting pool measures and has an approximate water depth of . It displays videos on two LED screens, each encapsulated in a glass brick tower measuring . The firm designed a special stainless steel T-frame both to bear the load of the walls, which are high, and to withstand lateral wind forces. The frame holds all the glass blocks and transfers the load to the base in a zigzag pattern. Rods measuring in diameter anchor to the structure and project into the frame for lateral stability, while triangular corner brackets add support. After several dozen glass manufacturing firms were interviewed, L. E. Smith Glass Company emerged as the company to produce 22,500 glass blocks near the upper limit of the size of press glass formed from hand-poured molten glass and cast iron molds.Sharoff, 75 The process used sand and soda ash heated to a temperature of and \\"gathered\\" with a large clay ball resembling a honey dipper. Rather than use a standard plunger to ensure the glass that sagged off the rod spread to the corners of the mold, they relied on gravity. The full mold was annealed (reheated in an oven to ) and cooled.Sharoff, 76 Over the course of four months of production,Sharoff, p. 79 about 350 blocks were produced per day. The glass was custom-made at a factory in Mount Pleasant, Pennsylvania, and shipped to the structural glass panel manufacturer in Melbourne, Florida. The panels were then shipped by truck to Chicago. The glass is white glass, rather than the usual green glass that results from iron impurities. This has the tradeoff of increased image clarity, but greater dirt visibility. Each block is with glass thin enough to avoid image distortion. On each block, one of the six faces is polished, and the other five surfaces are textured. The structure for the blocks was a challenge. At first, the design team had considered switching to plastic blocks, until the team found Circle Redmont Inc., a prefabricated glass panel company in Melbourne, Florida which specializes in structural glass panel systems. Circle Redmont came up with the plan of turning grates on their sides to be used as building elements. The individual grids are tall and either or wide with cell capacity of an average of 250 blocks. Each tower is composed of 44 grids stacked and welded. The combination of the refraction of the glass and the thinness of the metal make the grid virtually invisible. The fountain uses per hour, 97% of which is recycled back into the system.Sharoff, p. 86 Getting the water to the spout took ingenuity. Although consideration was given to omitting a LED tile, it was determined that the images would then look as though they were each missing a tooth. Instead, one tile in each tower is recessed about to allow the installation of clear tubing for the water nozzle. The water regularly spills over the fountain and down the sides of the towers and intermittently spouts from the nozzle. Two essential custom fittings contribute to the artistic vision of the fountain: a custom glass block at the upper edge for guiding the water's descent while remaining unobtrusive, and a plastic nozzle fitted to the stainless steel frame to control the rate of water flow and reduce liability to the city for any injuries sustained by the fountain's interactive participants. The interactive participants are usually children playing in the stream from the water spout or under the cascade. The risk that the spouting water would knock people down made the design both a legal and a physical challenge. The fountains use over one million LEDs.Gilfoyle, p. 277. The inner surface of each tower uses 147 smaller screens with a total of 264,480 LED points (each with two red, one blue and two green LEDs).Sharoff, p. 82 The physical demands of LED screens, in particular the red, green, and blue long- life light bulbs and the requisite circuitry, created three major challenges: supporting the physical structure, combating heat buildup, and optimizing perceptibility of the display. Plensa had used LED fixtures on previous projects, and thus had some experience with these issues. The LED structure is not supported as a single wall (which would be high), but rather as several segments that are noticeable as visible horizontal bands every few feet: these show where the LED equipment is supported. The heat generated is handled by fans that cool the air at the bottom, that then works its way through the chimney-like tower. Perceptibility was determined to be optimal with LED lights behind the glass. LEDs were chosen because they were viewed as the lowest maintenance option of the possible color changing fixtures. LEDs fit into an electrical circuit, causing illumination by the movement of electrons in the semiconductor material and making a filament unnecessary, so the bulbs never burn out and do not get too hot. Fins were added to the screens to keep direct sunlight from hitting the LEDs. Color Kinetics (now part of Philips Solid-State Lighting Solutions, which is now called Philips Color Kinetics) ColorBlast 12 LEDs fixtures are used to illuminate the tower structures and glass in an attempt to meet Plensa's objective that the towers have a light and translucent appearance, with their internal structures reflecting light from behind the glass surface. The electronics were designed to be adaptable to the time of day, weather and season and to meet the desired century-long longevity and dependability objectives set by the design team in response to the thirty-year directive. The pool used pavers that weigh . The pavers were rested on screw jack pedestals in order to be leveled and shimmed. The pavers had to be perfectly leveled for the water to work correctly because the fountain incorporates numerous sensors to regulate the flow and level of the water. During construction the underground parking garage remained open.Sharoff, p. 70 An additional challenge was designing the structure to facilitate interior access for ongoing maintenance and repairs, while accommodating two levels of underground parking underneath. The challenge was solved by combining a T-bar grid to absorb weight with about 150 \\"outriggers\\", or \\"tiebacks\\", inserted through the video wall to support the glass blocks and absorb wind loads. This design allows for the removal of individual glass blocks for cleaning or repair without disruption to the display. The filtered air inside the towers helps minimize the need for cleaning. Crown Fountain's design not only included interior access for technical repairs, but also incorporated exemplary, non-discriminatory, barrier-free accessibility, because its interactivity is not limited to the able-bodied. The force of the water accounts for the entire range of possible interactive visitors. Dedication and operation alt=night time view of large illuminated physical structure. Unveiling Construction of the video sculpture was completed for testing without the fountain's water features on May 18, 2004. Originally, Plensa had planned to have each face appear for 13 minutes, and this continued to be the targeted duration when the testing of the sculpture occurred. Eventually, professors at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago convinced him to use only five-minute videos. Plensa's design of Crown Fountain was unveiled to the public on July 16‚Äì18, during the 2004 grand opening celebrations for Millennium Park. At the time of the unveiling, Crown Fountain, like the nearby Cloud Gate, was incomplete because only 300 of the videos had been refined for public display. It was officially dedicated on July 24, 2004 as part of a special private fundraising party that raised $3 million for the Millennium Park Conservancy fund. Operation The control center for the synchronization of images, water flow, and lighting color and intensity is beneath one of the towers, in a room that covers . The room houses high-definition video servers and equipment temperature sensors. Hard drives contain all the individual electronic computer files of the face videos. Generally, the computer programs automatically perform tasks such as determining when the face will pucker and, if weather conditions permit, when to turn the water on and off. Using low- rather than high-resolution images was both less expensive and created a better display for the average viewer. A Barco show controller selects the sequence of faces one at a time and determines a random tower lighting selection of one of eight LED colors programmed into an Electronic Theatre Controls (ETC) Emphasis control system. At night, the ETC system controls spotlights that illuminate the cascading water and that are dimmed by special wet-use location ground fault circuit interrupters. The control room covers an area equal to 26 parking spaces in the underground parking garage, which costs the city $100,000 annually in terms of the opportunity cost of lost revenue (in 2004 dollars). Maintenance issues for the fountain range from kids removing the adhesive between the bricks to pipes in need of maintenance. , annual upkeep costs were approximately $400,000. Typically, the fountain's water features function between mid-spring and mid-fall, but the images remain on the screen year- round. Video sculpture The front face of each tower is animated with a continuous, dynamic exhibit of lights and electronic images. Although the screens on the towers periodically display clips of landscapes such as waterfalls, most intriguing are the display of faces of Chicago residents. About 1,000 faces of Chicagoans are shown in a random rotation, the order determined using a Barco show controller. Each face is displayed for five minutes, with a brief period between each of these videos during which the sculpture is unlit. As a result, no more than 12 faces appear per hour during the summer. However, during the winter a version without the final one minute of puckering is shown, so the video segments then are only four minutes each. The video pattern also includes a three-minute water scene every half-hour and a 30-second fade-to-black every 15 minutes. If all the faces were shown consecutively, instead of randomly, they would each appear about once every eight days. A June 2007 article in the Chicago Sun-Times reported that many of the subjects who had their images digitized for the project had yet to either see their own images or hear of anyone who had seen them. alt=The fountain during a periodic fade to black The spouting water from the faces of the towers appears to be flowing from the displayed subject's mouth from a nozzle located in the center of each interior face above the reflecting pool. Images are shown daily year-round, while the water feature only operates from May 1 to approximately October 31, weather permitting. The park is open to the public daily from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. Each tower is illuminated from within on three sides by approximately 70 color-changing Color Kinetics LED lighting fixtures per tower, while the fourth side features opposing Barco LED display screens. At night, some of the videos are replaced by images of nature or solid colors. Also at night, the other three sides of the fountain display changing colors. The outer Color Kinetics surfaces randomly display the translucent glow of one of eight colors along with each of the inner opposing faces. As a video sculpture with a variety of cascade and water spout fountain modes, the sculpture is a fluid, dynamic evolving artwork. Fountain Crown Fountain has both slits and a grate for drainage (pictured above right) to drain the of water per minute. When the videos are not on the front of the tower, water cascades down each of the facades. The water is filtered, pumped and recirculated through the fountain. Dual pump rooms below each tower draw water from a reservoir beneath the reflecting pool. There are 12 mechanical pumps that are regulated from a control room in the underground parking garage beneath the south tower of the fountain. The water in the reflecting pool has a depth of about . Controversies Before the fountain was completed in 2004, Art Institute of Chicago president James Wood felt the columns would be too tall and other community leaders felt that the height and scale of the project stemmed from a \\"pissing contest\\" with other park feature artists.Gilfoyle, pp. 290‚Äì291. Grant Park has been protected since 1836 by \\"forever open, clear and free\\" legislation that has been affirmed by four previous Illinois Supreme Court rulings. Aaron Montgomery Ward twice sued the city of Chicago in the 1890s to force it to remove buildings and structures from Grant Park, and to keep it from building new ones. As a result, the city has what are termed the Montgomery Ward height restrictions on buildings and structures in Grant Park. However, Crown Fountain and Jay Pritzker Pavilion, which stands tall, were exempt from the height restriction because they were classified as works of art and not buildings or structures.Gilfoyle, p. 181 In November 2006, Crown Fountain became the focus of a public controversy when the city added surveillance cameras atop each tower. Purchased through a $52 million Department of Homeland Security grant to the Chicago area, the cameras were part of a surveillance system augmenting eight other cameras covering all of Millennium Park. The city said the cameras, similar to those used throughout the city at high-crime areas and traffic intersections, were intended to remain on the towers for several months until permanent, less intrusive replacements were secured. City officials had consulted the architects who collaborated with Plensa on the tower designs, but Plensa himself had not been notified. Public reaction was negative, as bloggers and the artistic community decried the cameras on the towers as inappropriate and a blight. The city said that the cameras were largely for security reasons, but also partly to help park officials monitor burnt-out lights. The Chicago Tribune quickly published an article concerning the cameras as well as the public reaction, and the cameras were removed the next day. Plensa supported their removal. Updating In 2014, the hardware and software behind the fountain's operation were replaced. At the time there were plans to replace LED lighting with incandescent bulbs on each of the non-video display surfaces and to replace the video surface LEDs. Plensa, who maintained control of the video faces for the first two years of the fountain's operation, understands that future generations may wish to update the faces used in the rotation of videos to reflect changes in humanity going forward. In 2014, an additional 1000 faces were anticipated for 2016. Critical reception Crown Fountain, Trevi Fountain, and Buckingham Fountain, as well as natural water features such as Old Faithful, are examples of the ability of water to attract people and hold their attention. Crown Fountain has more interactivity than other Chicago fountains, such as Buckingham Fountain and Lorado Taft's Fountain of the Great Lakes and Fountain of Time (all but the last are in Grant Park). These other Chicago fountains are traditional in that they discourage viewer touching; Buckingham Fountain is surrounded by a fence, and Taft's fountains are surrounded by moats. In contrast, Crown Fountain provides an open invitation to play in the fountain's water.Gilfoyle, p. 291. Crown Fountain's inviting interactivity is likened to the nearby jungle gym-like Chicago Picasso. U.S. News & World Report describes the fountain as an exemplary feature of the city's numerous urban parks. Chicago Tribune architecture critic Blair Kamin, who is pleased with the sculptures' verticalness, says the fountain helps appropriately depict the modern 21st-century urban park. The Chicago Sun-Times describes the fountain as \\"eye-catching, crowd-friendly ... high-tech [and] ... contemporary\\". The New York Times calls the fountain an \\"extraordinary art object\\". Frommer's describes the fountain as public art at its best. The beauty of the fountain is, as the San Francisco Chronicle explains, that it is high-concept art for all to enjoy. The Financial Times refers to the fountain as a \\"techno-fountain\\". The fountain is praised for its technical features by industry magazines and has won various awards. The project won the 2006 Bombay Sapphire prize for its design work with glass. Critical reviews were not unanimous in their praise. One Chicago Tribune critic was not impressed with JumboTron-like art, although he conceded the participatory element reminded him in a positive way of the jungle gym element of the Chicago Picasso. The fountain is featured on the cover of Philip Jodidio's 2005 book, Architecture: Art. Although Plensa is considered to be a conceptual artist, according to Jodidio, Plensa created a work whose architectural aspects are paramount. Its location juxtaposed with the Historic Michigan Boulevard District's skywall highlights these aspects. Jodidio considers the work to be a modernization of the gargoyle theme, and feels that the scale of the enlarged faces humanize the work and challenges the architecture. The towers are an integral part of the skyline that have achieved rare permanence for contemporary art.Jodidio, p. 162 See also * Crystal Fountains * List of public art in Chicago Notes References  * External links *City of Chicago Millennium Park *Millennium Park map *City of Chicago Loop Community Map *Photos of controversial surveillance cameras in initial critical blogpost *Crown Fountain archives at Chicago Tribune Category:Millennium Park Category:Outdoor sculptures in Chicago Category:2004 sculptures Category:American contemporary art Category:Contemporary works of art Category:Fountains in Illinois Category:Glass architecture Category:Glass works of art Category:Interactive art Category:Video art Category:Buildings and structures celebrating the third millennium Category:Buildings and structures completed in 2004 Category:Buildings and structures in Chicago Category:Sculptures by Jaume Plensa Category:2004 establishments in Illinois ","title":"Crown Fountain"},{"id":"11739189","text":"USS Adroit (AM-82/PC-1586) was an acquired by the United States Navy for the task of removing mines that had been placed in the water to prevent the safe passage of ships. Adroit was laid down on 31 July 1941 at Portland, Oregon, by the Commercial Iron Works; launched on 21 February 1942; and placed in commission on 28 July 1942, Lt. E. G. Benis in command. Pacific Ocean operations Following her commissioning, the minesweeper moved to San Francisco, for final fitting out and shakedown training. She left the west coast on 23 November and shaped a course for Hawaii. Adroit reached Pearl Harbor on 6 December and spent two weeks undergoing voyage repairs. She set sail on the 21st for Noumea, New Caledonia. Upon her arrival there, the ship began operations with Destroyer Squadron 12 on antisubmarine patrols off Noum√©a. Guadalcanal operations In mid-April, Adroit sailed to Espiritu Santo to undergo repairs. This work was completed in June, and she got underway on the 18th with a convoy for Guadalcanal. On 2 July, the minesweeper headed back to Noum√©a and operated there until the 26th, escorting ships entering and leaving the harbor. On the last day of July, Adroit arrived back at Guadalcanal and assumed station on a patrol screen. Her sound gear broke on 2 August, forcing her to anchor off Lunga Point until repairs could be made. The minesweeper got underway again on the 22nd, headed for New Caledonia, made intermediate stops at Espiritu Santo and Efate, and reached Noumea on 10 September. She then resumed harbor escort duties. In mid-October, Adroit sailed to Guadalcanal to join forces scheduled to invade the Treasury Islands. The vessel arrived off Bougainville on 26 October and began her prelanding sweeps. The assault began on the 27th and, during November, she escorted three more convoys from Guadalcanal to support the assault on the Treasury Islands. Adroit began operations from Guadalcanal on 23 November as a \\"ready ship\\" on screening and convoy duty and on hunter-killer operations. In this role, she escorted convoys to Espiritu Santo and Efate, New Hebrides; Noumea, New Caledonia; Auckland, New Zealand; Tarawa, Gilbert Islands; and Manus, Admiralty Islands. Reclassified as a submarine chaser On 1 June 1944, the ship was reclassified as a submarine chaser and redesignated PC-1586 and her name, Adroit, was cancelled. In mid-December, she moved to Ulithi where she served as a harbor patrol vessel. On 28 March 1945, she left Ulithi and proceeded to Saipan, where she arrived four days later. During the rest of her wartime service, PC-1586 operated on escort duty between Saipan and Iwo Jima. She made three round-trip voyages between these islands before shaping a course for Pearl Harbor on 30 July. End-of-War deactivation PC-1586 reached Hawaiian waters on 15 August and remained in port for approximately two weeks before sailing on to the west coast. She touched at San Francisco, on 15 September and began preparing for deactivation. PC-1586 was decommissioned on 14 December 1945, and her name was struck from the Navy list on 8 January 1946. She was transferred to the Maritime Commission on 18 March 1948 for disposal. Awards Adroit earned one battle star for her World War II service.

It was a contemporary hit radio station known as \\"The Fox\\" and was owned by Sunnie Silverman. Silverman sold the station to Bruce Mittman, owner of WICE in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, that December. WWFX was taken over in 1991 by Union Financial Services. The station was sold to Group H Radio on March 17, 1993. Group H announced on September 18, 1996 that it would sell WWFX to Star Broadcasting, a company owned by Mark Osborne and Natalie Knox (current owners of WNSX) that already owned WKSQ and WLKE (now WBFE). To minimize playlist overlap with WKSQ, on September 20, Star changed the station's format to country music as \\"The Bear.\\" The first song was \\"Gone Country\\" by Alan Jackson. The change gave rival WQCB its first competition since WYOU-FM became modern rock station WWBX a year earlier.

It is theorized to play a role in explaining type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance. It was named for Philip Randle, who described it in 1963. Cycle The Randle cycle is a biochemical mechanism involving the competition between glucose and fatty acids for their oxidation and uptake in muscle and adipose tissue. The cycle controls fuel selection and adapts the substrate supply and demand in normal tissues. This cycle adds a nutrient- mediated fine tuning on top of the more coarse hormonal control on fuel metabolism. This adaptation to nutrient availability applies to the interaction between adipose tissue and muscle. Hormones that control adipose tissue lipolysis affect circulating concentrations of fatty acids, these in turn control the fuel selection in muscle. Mechanisms involved in the Randle Cycle include allosteric control, reversible phosphorylation and the expression of key enzymes. The energy balance from meals composed of differing macronutrient composition is identical, but the glucose and fat balances that contribute to the overall energy balance change reciprocally with meal composition. Overview of the Randle Cycle. Glucose is Spared and Rerouted Fasted State When fasting, the activation of lipolysis provides fatty acids as the preferred fuel source for respiration. In the liver Œ≤-oxidation of fatty acids fulfills the local energy needs and may lead to ketogenesis (creating ketone bodies out of fatty acids.) The ketone bodies are then used to meet the demands of tissues other than the liver. The inhibition of glucose oxidation causes fatty acids and ketone bodies to contribute to a glucose- sparing effect, which is an essential survival mechanism for the brain during times of starvation. This inhibition of glucose oxidation at the level of pyruvate dehydrogenase preserves pyruvate and lactate, both of which are gluconeogenic precursors. Fed State The glucose fatty acid cycle is also observed in the fed state after a high-fat meal or during exercise. This is when plasma concentrations of fatty acids or ketone bodies are increased. The glucose that is not oxidized is then rerouted to glycogen. This rerouting to glycogen explains the rapid resynthesis of muscle glycogen after exercise as well as the increased glycogen content in muscles found in starvation or diabetes. This mechanism replenishes the intermediates of the citric acid cycle. Inhibition of Glycolytic Pathway The impairment of glucose metabolism by fatty acid oxidation is mediated by the short-term inhibition of several glycolytic processes. The extent of inhibition increases along the glycolytic pathway, being most severe at the level of pyruvate dehydrogenase and less severe at the level of glucose uptake and 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK-1). This sequence occurs because of the initial event, triggered by fatty acid oxidation, is an increase in the mitochondrial ratios of [acetyl- CoA]/[CoA] and [NADH]/[NAD+]. These both serve to inhibit pyruvate dehydrogenase activity. It has been proposed that these changes lead to an accumulation of cytosolic citrate, which in turn inhibits PFK-1, followed by an increase in glucose 6-phosphate, which eventually inhibits hexokinase. Inhibition of Glucose by Fatty Acid Oxidation Hemodynamic Stress Hemodynamic stress overrides fatty acid inhibition of glucose metabolism. During this time there is a decrease in substrate supply and an increase in the substrate demand. This leads to an activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) as the AMP concentration rises in intracellular fluids and the ATP concentration decreases. The stress-induced activation of AMPK provides an immediate metabolic adaption and protects the heart from ischemic stress. Fatty Acid Oxidation Inhibition by Malonyl-CoA Malonyl-CoA signals glucose utilization and it controls the entry and oxidation of long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) in the mitochondria. Circulating glucose in the liver stimulates its uptake. Glucose oxidation produces citrate which can be converted to malonyl- CoA by acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Malonyl-CoA inhibits the carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) that controls the entry and oxidation of LCFA. The glucose-derived malonyl-CoA prevents the oxidation of fatty acids and favors fatty acid esterification. Inhibition of Fatty Acid oxidization by Glucose Cytosolic events controlling fatty acid oxidation Malonyl-CoA concentration The concentration of malonyl-CoA depends on the balance between acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MCD). AMP- activated protein kinase (AMPK) is reported to phosphorylate and inactivate liver ACC. This in turn decreases malonyl-CoA concentrations which stimulates fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis by glucagon in the liver. AMPK phosphorylates and inactivates ACC in the liver and other tissues. Integration of AMPK and ACC in the glucose-fatty acid cycle Inhibition of fatty acid oxidation requires that ACC is active. Both AMPK and MCD are inactive and glucose uptake is stimulated. The LCFAs are then rerouted to esterification. These conditions exist in tissues rich in oxygen, in which AMPK is inactive and glucose inactivates the AMPK (researched in skeletal muscle). The inhibition of MCD suppresses the oxidation of fatty acids and stimulates glucose oxidation. In a study on MCD deficient mice there was no difference in the oxidation of fatty acids and glucose in the heart under aerobic conditions. It is theorized that the overexpression of fatty acids being used makes up for the lack of MCD. Fatty Acid Uptake Long chain fatty acid uptake is mediated by several transporters, including FAT (fatty acid translocase)/CD36. CD36 deletion rescues lipotoxic cardiomyopathy. FAT/CD36 may be controlled by insulin and AMPK. Increased transport coupled to the formation of the CoA derivatives and the resulting AMPK activation should ensure efficient fatty acid uptake and metabolism. Mitochondrial Events Controlling Fuel Selection Fatty acids are preferentially oxidized because of the inactivation of PDH by fatty acid oxidation inhibiting glucose oxidation. This suggests that mitochondrial metabolism may control fuel selection. Cellular respiration is stimulated by fatty acids and this relates to an increase in the mitochondrial NADH to NAD+ ratio, suggesting that energy provision overtakes energy consumption. Switching from glucose to fatty acid oxidation leads to a bigger proportion of electrons being transported to complex 2 rather than complex 1 of the respiratory chain. This difference leads to a less efficient oxidative phosphorylation. By oxidizing fatty acids, mitochondria increase their respiration while increasing the production of ROS. Fatty Acids and Insulin Fatty acids may act directly upon the pancreatic Œ≤-cell to regulate glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. This effect is biphasic. Initially fatty acids potentiate the effects of glucose. After prolonged exposure to high fatty acid concentrations this changes to an inhibition. Randle suggested that the term fatty acid syndrome would be appropriate to apply to the biochemical syndrome resulting from the high concentration of fatty acids and the relationship to abnormalities of carbohydrate metabolism, including starvation, diabetes and Cushing‚Äôs syndrome.

Synopsis After Darren learns that Darius is his nephew, he refuses to kill the boy. While Harkat and Debbie help Evra take his dead son Shancus to the Cirque du Freak, Darren, Vancha, Alice, Evanna and Darius return to Darren's family home. He reveals his survival to Annie, tells her of his life since his presumed death, and that Darius will have to kill when he drinks blood. To save Darius, Darren rebloods him, only to learn that the Cirque du Freak has been surrounded by police. After bidding goodbye to his family, Darren decides that Steve has set another trap, and heads for the Circus to kill his nemesis. While the vampirites engage the police outside, Darren and Vancha enter and fight the vampaneze with the help of the Cirque du Freak. When the battle turns in the vampires' favour, Steve and Gannen flee, pursued by Darren and Vancha to a bridge. Darren's weakness from his purge and Darius' reblooding leaves them at a disadvantage, until Vancha is wounded. Gannen is knocked out cold by R. V., who has realized the insanity of his master following the death of the innocent Shancus Von. He is subsequently killed by Steve. Finally Darren and Steve duel alone, and although Steve badly wounds Darren during a fit from the reblooding, he is surprised and knocked down, before being stabbed in the heart. Mr. Tiny then congratulates Darren, telling him to accept his destiny as the Lord of the Shadows. When Evanna points out that Darren will never consort with him willingly, Tiny reveals that Darren and Steve are his children, created to plunge the world back into war and conflict. While Evanna is outraged, Darren realizes that he can avert this fate if he is dead, and taunts Steve into stabbing him. Both fall into the river and succumb to their injuries. Darren's soul then enters the Lake of Souls. He almost goes mad until he is rescued by Evanna. She explains that Darren has been trapped for millennia and they are now in the far future, in which dragons rule the Earth; humanity's fate is uncertain. This is only one of many possible futures; in the present, the War of the Scars is still being waged, although Harkat, Vancha and Gannen Harst are striving for peace. This outcome is repugnant to Mr. Tiny; Evanna explains that their father engineered vampires and vampaneze to end humanity's steps towards peace. Since Darren's sacrifice, Mr. Tiny has tried to persuade Evanna to conceive the child of a vampire or vampaneze to throw the races into renewed conflict. Evanna eventually agreed on the condition that Darren be released; she believed that Darren did not deserve his fate, and was a victim of Mr. Tiny's scheming. However, Evanna, inspired by Darren's rejection of his destiny, has double- crossed their father; she is pregnant with twins, one from Vancha and the other from Gannen Harst, and has also allowed the bloodlines to mix, so the children will be able to breed with vampires and vampaneze, and will eventually erase all division between the two clans. Darren and Evanna then arrive at Mr. Tiny's home, where Darren is painfully converted into a Little Person to escape the Lake of Souls. As per the deal between father and daughter, Darren is sent back to the night he first saw the Cirque du Freak, and scares his younger self away, ensuring the boy will never become a vampire. The person who will take Darren's place will not be responsible for their actions, and will be free to enter Paradise. However, Evanna has one last weapon - she gives Darren the diaries he has been keeping for most of his life, updated to include his history since his death. Darren gives these to Mr Tall, with instructions to eventually pass them to the man he will become. The stories will be written and released when the vampires and vampaneze are nearing a truce, and will reveal to the world at large how they have been manipulated, ensuring lasting peace. With his work done, Darren retreats to the top of the theatre, quietly watching his body unravel, before his spirit heads to Paradise.

Controversy surrounds the current efforts to redevelop the site, particularly the issue of the disposal of mercury-contaminated sediments and soils. The property consists of two main portions: the plant site itself and the so-called Aerated Stabilization Basin (ASB), part of the plant's wastewater treatment system. The ASB is a large lagoon enclosed by an earthen breakwater built atop former tidelands across the Whatcom waterway from the plant site. The waterfront has served as an industrial center since the late nineteenth century. In the areas currently slated for redevelopment, salmon canning gave way to pulp and paper production in the early twentieth century. In 1963 the Georgia Pacific company purchased the Puget Sound Pulp and Timber Company and operated a pulp mill on the central downtown waterfront until 2001. In 1965 Georgia Pacific built a Chlor-Alkali facility that operated until 1999. A tissue mill existed on the same site from 1926 and ceased operations December 21, 2007. While the siting of an industrial and chemical operation on the waterfront fell increasingly out of favor over the years, the plant was a significant source of family-wage employment for residents of the city. Portions of the waterfront are heavily contaminated due to the area's historical industrial uses. The environmental problems stem primarily from G-P's operation of the chlor-alkali plant to manufacture chlorine and other chemicals. The process released many tons of mercury into the Whatcom Creek waterway. Some areas of the upland portions of the site are also contaminated with significant concentrations of mercury. By contrast, the ASB‚Äîthe only area scheduled for the removal of toxins‚Äîis clean. Other areas of the waterfront are contaminated as a result of the historic use as a municipal waste landfill, which served as a disposal ground for the waste while creating additional dry land. Redevelopment In June 2006, Georgia Pacific sold the property (valued at US$37 million) to the Port of Bellingham for $10 in exchange for assuming responsibility for the environmental cleanup of the property. The company retained a lease on the portion of the property occupied by the tissue mill operation until it closed down. The city and port have entered into a partnership to jointly clean up and redevelop the property, which is to be branded \\"The Waterfront District.\\" A general plan for the city's waterfront was developed several years ago by the Waterfront Futures Group, and the new Waterfront Advisory Group has been convening to develop a more detailed plan focused on this particular site. Marina controversy One source of controversy is the conflict between the port's long-standing plans to convert the ASB into a pleasure-boat marina and advocacy groups' interest in using the ASB to facilitate a more comprehensive cleanup of the contaminated sediments in the waterway. Several citizens watchdog groups have formed in response to this controversy, including the Bellingham Bay Foundation in 2005. ReSources is another organization in Bellingham that has focused on the cleanup of Bellingham Bay in general and has advocated for the full removal of all mercury contamination present in the nearshore areas of Bellingham Bay. During the summer of 2006, the Bellingham Bay Foundation formed People for a Healthy Bay over a concern that many of the areas slated for development contained high mercury levels (as high as 12,500ppm) in the soil under the former Chlor-Alkali facility. People for a Healthy Bay launched an initiative that would have required the City of Bellingham to advocate for removal of mercury to the highest practical level. Despite 6400 signatures gathered in 20 days and overwhelming public support for the initiative, the City successfully sued to keep the initiative off the ballot. The initiative reflected polling data performed by the Foundation that the citizens of Bellingham care most that their waterfront is clean and safe. Meanwhile the port has continued to move forward with plan incorporating a marina in the ASB. Current status The Consent Decree for the Whatcom Waterway and ASB has been signed by the Washington State Department of Ecology, The Department of Natural Resources, the City of Bellingham, the Port of Bellingham, and many other agencies. The City of Bellingham and Port of Bellingham were scheduled to develop the final EIS and Master Plan for the upland, but citing objections to the City of Bellingham's street grid, the City's reluctance to sign a Planned Action Ordinance, among many other issues, the Port has retreated from the process. The City remains hopeful that the Port will return to the process. The City of Bellingham issues the permit for the marina.

White, the fourth book in the series The Once and Future King. Written in 1940, it was first published in 1958 in the collected edition. It deals with the last weeks of Arthur's reign, his dealings with his son Mordred's revolts, Guenever and Lancelot's demise, and his perception of right and wrong. Plot The story begins with Mordred and Agravaine, both discontented. Mordred hates his father, King Arthur, and Agravaine hates Sir Lancelot. Their views are not shared by Gawaine, Gareth, or Gaheris. The relationship of Lancelot and Guinevere has gone on for some time, and everyone in the court knows of it. No one, however, publicly speaks of it, as the law would require Lancelot to be killed and Guinevere to be burned at the stake. In order to wreak their revenge Mordred and Agravaine decide to go to the king and charge the Queen with adultery. Troubled by this, King Arthur agrees to leave on a hunting trip to give the knights a chance to catch the Queen with Lancelot, although he does say that if they are caught, he hopes that Lancelot will be able to kill all witnesses and adds that if the two fail in backing their claims, he will see to it that they are pursued by the law themselves. At the same time Arthur confesses to Guinevere and Lancelot a terrible secret: when Mordred was born, Arthur had been told by many people that the child would be evil, as a result of the incest. Pressured, the king commanded all babies born in the approximate month that Mordred would be born to be placed on a boat, which was then sunk. Mordred managed to survive, however, and Arthur lived with the guilt of causing the death of the other babies. The king leaves to go hunting and Lancelot prepares to sneak over to Guinevere's room. Before he can leave, Gareth visits him, and warns him of Mordred's and Agravaine's plot. Lancelot receives Gareth warmly, but does not take the threat seriously as he does not believe that Arthur would entertain such an idea. He leaves for the Queen's room without weapons or armour, assuring Gareth that they will all laugh together when the king returns. In Guinevere's room, Lancelot laughingly tells her of Gareth's warning. Unlike him, however, the Queen takes the threat seriously and tries to convince him to leave before they are caught. A group of knights attempts to break into Guinevere's room. Lancelot manages to kill one of them, later revealed to have been Agravaine, and takes his weapon and armour to defeat the rest. Mordred escapes to tell Arthur of the Queen's faithlessness. Lancelot is forced to flee Camelot, but promises to return to rescue Guinevere. Though Arthur is unwilling to kill his wife, he is obliged to obey his own laws and prepares for her execution. Mordred faces scorn and anger from his half-brothers, who are furious with him for turning in the Queen and accuse him of being a coward for running away from his fight with Lancelot. Arthur later explains to them that Mordred survived because Lancelot was unwilling to kill Arthur's son. When Mordred learns that Lancelot will return to prevent Guinevere's execution he demands that Arthur put more guards in the town. While Gawaine refuses to take part in the events, Gareth and Gaheris are stationed as additional guards. Just as Guinevere is about to be burned, Lancelot rides in and rescues her. Much to Gawaine's horror, it is discovered that in his haste to reach the Queen, Lancelot has killed Gareth and Gaheris before he could recognize them. Guinevere and Lancelot flee to France, and request forgiveness from the Pope. It is granted and Guinevere is permitted to return to Camelot. Lancelot remains in France, where Arthur is forced to fight him for honour. After spending several mornings taunting Lancelot as a traitor and a coward, Gawaine receives a blow to the head that gravely injures him. In Camelot, Mordred is left to rule in Arthur's stead. He corners Guinevere, and tells her that he intends to overthrow Arthur and take her as his wife, as revenge for Arthur sleeping with Mordred's mother. Guinevere manages to send a message to Arthur. Gawaine dies. Arthur then returns to England to stop Mordred. On the eve of battle, in a state of semi- consciousness, Arthur remembers Merlyn's lessons. To make sure that his legacy lives on, even if he dies in the battle, he explains his ideas to a young serving boy, Tom of Warwick, who is Thomas Malory of Warwickshire. He tells the boy that his idea of peace was like a candle in the wind, which he kept alight only with an effort. The book ends with Arthur sending Tom away to safety and becoming ready to face the coming battle \\"with a peaceful heart\\". Arthur acknowledges that he will perhaps come again to try to create another perfect Round Table, and remembers the times he spent with Merlyn. (In The Book of Merlyn this is when Merlyn appears and takes Arthur away for a debate on war and humanity.) Either Arthur dies in battle, or he is set adrift to Avalon, where his wounds may be healed so that he may rule again.

She attended Blue Springs High School in Blue Springs, Missouri. The Real World: San Diego MTV's promotional materials described Abernathy as someone who \\"likes to shock people with her appearance, date bad boys, party all night and dreams of being an artist.\\" She was known for her taste in punk rock music and her fondness for Hello Kitty.

During her time on The Real World, she showed many symptoms of the genetic disorder, such as difficulty breathing and immune-system impairment. Her disease was a significant part of her storyline on the show. Of those living with cystic fibrosis, fewer than 50% live to the age of 37. One of Abernathy's sayings was \\"Tomorrow is a privilege, so live today like tomorrow isn't happening.\\" Abernathy left the show before the end of the season due to conflict with her roommates and the strain of separation from her boyfriend. After The Real World After leaving the show in early 2004, Abernathy spent her time working at numerous retail outlets in Kansas City, working tattoo conventions with the Art Intensity Network, getting more tattoos, and spending time with her loved ones. She also appeared on the cover of the May 2005 issue of Prick, a tattoo magazine.Liquor, Clint (May 2005).\\"Frankie, From MTV's Real World San Diego\\" . Prick.

As with Zamora's struggle with AIDS, Abernathy is credited by MTV.com with helping to raise national awareness of cystic fibrosis and putting a face on the disease. Abernathy's housemate Jacquese Smith, with whom she was the closest, was particularly devastated by her death and by having not kept in touch with her, as was fellow housemate Jamie Chung.

It is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily. Function The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family of receptors. It is expressed on the surface of most cell types, including cells of epithelial and myeloid lineages, but not on T and B lymphocytes. The protein specifically binds the lymphotoxin membrane form (a complex of lymphotoxin-alpha and lymphtoxin-beta). The encoded protein and its ligand play a role in the development and organization of lymphoid tissue and transformed cells. Activation of the encoded protein can trigger apoptosis. Not only does the LTBR help trigger apoptosis, it can lead to the release of the cytokine interleukin 8. Overexpression of LTBR in HEK293 cells increases IL-8 promoter activity and leads to IL-8 release. LTBR is also essential for development and organization of the secondary lymphoid organs and chemokine release. Structure The Ramachandran plots show that 64.6% of all residues were in a favored region. This structure was found using X-ray diffraction. The resolution is 3.50 angstroms. The alpha and beta angles are 90 degrees while the gamma angle is 120 degrees. Interactions Lymphotoxin beta receptor has been shown to interact with Diablo homolog and TRAF3.

July 22, 2011. http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/441/when-patents-attack Education and career T. John Ward was born in 1943 in Bonham, Texas. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1964 from Texas Tech University and a Bachelor of Laws in 1967 from the Baylor Law School. He was in private practice as a malpractice and product liability lawyer from 1968 through 1999. Federal judicial service Ward was nominated to the district by President Bill Clinton on January 26, 1999, confirmed by the United States Senate on July 13, 1999, received his commission on July 15, 1999 and joined the bench in September 1999. His service terminated on October 1, 2011 due to retirement. Civic activities Ward served on the board of trustees of the Good Shepherd Medical Center from 1987 to 1991 and 1994 to 1999, and was on the board of directors of the Good Shepherd Foundation from 1986 to 1988 and 1994 to 1997. He was on the advisory board of the East Texas Literacy Council from 1987 to 1991. Honors In 2004, Ward was honored by Baylor Law School as its Baylor Lawyer of the Year, an award given annually to an outstanding alumnus who has brought honor and distinction to Baylor Law School and the legal profession. In 2009, Ward was named the Trial Judge of the Year by the Texas Chapter of the American Board of Trial Advocates. Patent infringement cases Ward has been described as a \\"plain-talking Texan\\" who maintains a \\"folksy demeanor\\" and a \\"fiery temper\\". He enjoys patent cases, citing their intellectual challenge. Ward was credited as having a solid knowledge of patent law and a dedication to efficiency. Attorney Willem Schurrman has described Ward as being well-prepared and well-versed in the cases he hears. He became interested in patent law while defending Hyundai Electronics against a lawsuit by Texas Instruments. Hyundai lost and Texas Instruments was awarded $25.2 million in 1999. Since Ward initially joined the Eastern District of Texas, the district has seen a tenfold increase in cases since 1999. There were 14 patent cases in 1999, 32 in 2002, 155 in 2005, and 234 in 2006. And, in 2013, 1,495 patent cases were filed.Nazer, Daniel. Deep Dive: Why We Need Venue Reform to Restore Fairness to Patent Litigation. Electronic Frontier Foundation. August 17, 2015. https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/08/deep-dive- why-we-need-venue-reform-restore-fairness-patent-litigation The Eastern District of Texas is one of eight with more than 100 new patent filings each year. Ward heard more than 160 patent cases in his first seven years on the bench. He had been handling 90% of the patent cases in Marshall, but later was reduced to 60%. Patent cases presented before Ward were more frequently won by the patent holder plaintiff than the defense. One source claims that patent holders win 88% of the time in Ward's court, compared to an average of 68% nationwide. Another source claims that patent cases in Marshall are won by patent holders 78% of the time versus 59% nationwide. And a third source claims that in 90% of cases patent holders win jury verdicts. Between taking the bench in 1999 and June 2006, Ward was overturned in only one patent case. Ward believes the problem of patent trolls is overstated and that his record of being overturned only once supports this view. Ward has been described as pushing cases through quickly. His court had been described as a \\"rocket docket\\" for its speed. To speed things up, Ward adopted a set of rules covering both litigation and trial activities. Ward's rules were based on rules from the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. His litigation rules included early disclosure of positions, establishment of firm case deadlines, and sanctions for parties abusing the discovery process. Attorney Alan Fisch says that the \\"jurisdiction has a tailored set of rules for patent cases that streamline certain of the pretrial proceedings ‚Äî generally this benefits both plaintiff and defendant.\\" Lawyers who do not move quickly enough are sanctioned. Ward credits his rules and resulting speed with causing the increase in patent suits filed in the district. Fast cases reduce expenses for financially strapped plaintiff patent holders. Attorney Henry Bunsow claims that the fast cases can \\"cut legal fees in half.\\" His trial rules included strict timetables and the use of a chess clock to time opening and closing arguments. Each side in a case might receive between 9 and 15 hours for evidence, compared to other courts where it might take a month or more. Defendants have incentive to settle rather than risk larger expenses. There are claims that the juries in Marshall are plaintiff- friendly. There is disagreement about the court's patent-friendliness. Charles Baker and Daniel Perez, attorneys who have both defended against patent suits in Ward's court, describe the court as \\"fair.\\" Ward has described the district as historically \\"plaintiffs-oriented,\\" and has described the Marshall jury pool as \\"defenders of property rights\\" and \\"friendly to patent owners' interests.\\" Some claim that plaintiffs often have an advantage because they hire Marshall lawyers more likely to know the jurors and benefit from that information. T. John \\"Johnny\\" Ward, Jr. T. John Ward's son, T. John \\"Johnny\\" Ward, Jr. is an attorney who is frequently called on to litigate patent cases in the Eastern District of Texas.

It is located in northern Henrico County along U.S. Route 1 near the intersection of Interstate 295. VCC is the closest mall to many parts of the Richmond region, such as Mechanicsville, Ashland, and the city of Richmond's North Side. Its anchor stores are J. C. Penney, Burlington Coat Factory, and American Family Fitness, with two vacant anchors last occupied by Sears and Macy's. Simon Property Group owned the mall until 2014, when it was split off to Washington Prime Group. In January 2017, the mall was sold again to Kohan Retail Investment Group. History When VCC first opened, it siphoned off a significant amount of business from 3 other area malls: Azalea Mall, Fairfield Commons (formerly Eastgate Mall) and Willow Lawn. In the case of Azalea Mall, it took enough business away to relegate that mall to \\"dead mall\\" status and Azalea Mall was subsequently closed and demolished. It took the Sears anchor away from Fairfield Commons and sent it almost to the same point. That mall closed in 2015 for redevelopment into a smaller open-air mall. It also took the JC Penney anchor away from Willow Lawn and led Willow Lawn to eventually reposition itself as more of a community shopping center than a regional shopping destination. Stores Among the mall's original anchor stores were Proffitt's and Leggett, a division of Belk. These stores both became Dillard's in 1997 and 1998, respectively. In 2011, Dillard's closed the former Proffitt's store, which became a Burlington Coat Factory, and downgraded the former Leggett to an outlet store before closing it later in 2011. The former Leggett is now occupied by American Family Fitness. As part of a nationwide closing of 36 stores, Macy's has closed its former Hecht's store at Virginia Center Commons in spring 2016.

The Henrico County Board of Supervisors unanimously voted on Tuesday evening to enter negotiations with The Rebkee Company for design, construction and operation of the proposed indoor sports facility and convocation center. ‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôre seeing is that by not having a facility of this type we‚Äôre leaving opportunities on the table,‚Äù said Neil Luther, Director of Henrico County Recreation & Parks. \\"We know by virtue of our relationships on the outside market, that very easily the groups that produce these indoor tournaments would love the opportunity to come here because of all the factors that make Henrico a great place to visit.‚Äù Sports tourism is a major economic driver for the county. In 2018, $54 million was pumped into the economy thanks to more than 170 tournaments held at county parks and sports complexes. More than 180 tournaments were expected in 2019. [ Sports tourism brings in $54 million for Henrico economy ] However, officials believe the county‚Äôs lack of an indoor facility could be costing it $33 million in unattainable revenue. ‚ÄúWe could easily put 30-35 weekends a year into this new facility,‚Äù Luther said. \\"It‚Äôs a tremendous uptick in economic generation that the county would be looking at.‚Äù  References  https://www.nbc12.com/2019/11/12/indoor-sports-complex- convention-center-could-replace-virginia-center-commons/  External links  * Virginia Center Commons Category:Shopping malls in Richmond, Virginia Category:Buildings and structures in Henrico County, Virginia Category:Tourist attractions in Henrico County, Virginia Category:Shopping malls established in 1991 Category:1991 establishments in Virginia ","title":"Virginia Center Commons"},{"id":"11739904","text":"Nares Land or Naresland is an island in far northern Greenland.

'followers of the mad path') were a socio-religious order that emerged in the late 18th century CE in the Mymensingh region of Bengal (now located in Bangladesh). Adherents of a syncretic mixture of Hinduism, Sufism and Animism, the order sought to uphold religious principles and the rights of landless peasants in Bengal; under the leadership of Tipu Shah, the movement soon evolved into a popular, armed struggle against British Raj and the zamindar (landlord) system. It was crushed with the help of the army in 1833. It is a semi religious sect having influence in the northern districts of Bengal. History The Pagal Panthis was a religious movement that emerged in the northern Mymensingh and Sherpur District area of the province of Bengal. In contrast to the rest of Bengal, the region was inhabited mainly by tribal peoples such as the Garos, Hajangs, Dalus, Hudis and Rajvangshies, who were mainly adherents of Animism and tribal faiths. The region enjoyed considerable religious harmony and served as a base for religious reform movements such as the Pagal Panthis, an order founded by Karim Shah and other disciples of the Muslim fakir Majnu Shah, the leader of the Madariya Sufi order. After the death of Karim Shah in 1813, the order was led by his son Tipu Shah. Chandi Bibi, the wife of Karim Shah and Tipu Shah's mother also held an influential position in the community, known as Pir-Mata (Saint-Mother). Philosophy The philosophy and teachings of Karim Shah were a syncretism of Sufism, Hindu philosophy and local customs, traditions and beliefs. The religious order gained popularity amongst the native peoples and brought together a diverse collection of tribes, Muslims, Hindus and Animists. The order preached monotheism, human equality, non-violence and encouraged the people to overcome social and religious differences and avoid conflicts and dogma. Karim Shah and his followers addressed each other as \\"Bhaisaheb\\" (brother) to promote equality and brotherhood. Karim Shah himself was popularly believed to possess spiritual powers enabling him to foretell events, cure diseases and heal people. The movement was shunned and criticised by Bengali Muslim society and its leaders, who condemned religious syncretism and referred to the order as Pagal Panthis ‚Äì literally the followers of a \\"mad faith.\\" However, the order gained widespread popularity amongst peasant masses. Under Tipu Shah, the order extended the philosophy to demand equal socio-economic rights for the peasants of the region. Tipu Shah proclaimed that no unilateral ownership of land could be allowed, as God had created humans as equals, thus granting every human an equal right to the lands. Those who forced peasants to pay taxes and oppressed them lost the moral right to rule over others. Ruling in the name of Allah, Tipu Shah enforced religious laws and encouraged tax resistance. Peasant rebellions The patron-saint of the Pagal Panthis, Majnu Shah, had been famous for encouraging revolts against the British East India Company, which had gained control over Bengal and later much of India. Under Tipu Shah, the order focused on organising peasants in rebellions against oppressive taxes and laws imposed by the zamindars (landlords) and the British. The region had been devastated by war between British forces and Burma. To meet the costs of war, severe taxation was imposed on the region's peasants by the Company and the landlords. Forcible collections and usurpation of property increased peasant discontent and disorder. The Pagal Panthis sought to protect and defend peasants from the militias of the landlords and the Company's armed forces. Basing his forces in a mud-fort near Sherpur, Tipu Shah proclaimed his rule in the name of Allah and assumed the religious and political leadership of the community. The people of the region stopped paying taxes to the British and followed Tipu Shah's rulings. Although Tipu Shah and his aides were arrested in 1833 and tried, the government subsequently met many of the peasant demands, including lowering the rent rate and other taxes. Compromises and agreements between the landlords, the Company and the peasants helped restore peace and order in the northern Mymensingh region. After Tipu Shah's death in 1852, the order came under the leadership of Janku and Dobraj Pathor, who organised another peasant resistance movement against the landlords and British authorities. An armed group of Pagal Panthis under the leadership of the Pathors stormed into Sherpur town, looted government offices and overpowered the officials, landlords and police, forcing them to flee to Mymensingh. Declaring themselves rulers of the town and surrounding areas, the rebels held control for almost two years. Negotiations and compromises between the rebels and the British helped forge peace and further concessions to the cause of the peasants.

OurGrid was mainly developed at the Federal University of Campina Grande (Brazil), which has run an OurGrid instance named \\"OurGrid\\" since December 2004. Anyone can freely and easily join it to gain access to large amount of computational power and run parallel applications. This computational power is provided by the idle resources of all participants, and is shared in a way that makes those who contribute more get more when they need. Currently, the platform can be used to run any application whose tasks (i.e. parts that run on a single machine) do not communicate among themselves during execution, like most simulations, data mining and searching. Inside OurGrid OurGrid 4.0 Main Components Figure 1.1 OurGrid Main Components Figure 1.1 OurGrid Main Components * OurGrid Broker The OurGrid Broker (originally called MyGrid) is the scheduling component of the OurGrid solution. A machine running the Broker is called the home machine, which is the central point of a grid. During the processing of jobs, it acts as the grid coordinator, scheduling the execution of tasks and doing all the necessary data transfer to and from grid machines. Due to its central role, grid configuration and management, as well as job specification, is done on the home machine. The Broker is OurGrid's user frontend. It provides support to describe, execute, and monitor jobs. Job processing is done by machines running OurGrid Workers. During the execution of a job, the Broker gets Workers on-demand from its associated Peer. It is the Broker's role to schedule the tasks to run on the Workers and to deploy and retrieve all data to/from Workers before and after the execution of tasks. * Peers An OurGrid Peer runs on a machine called the peer machine. The main role of a Peer is to organize and provide worker machines that belong to the same administrative domain. From the user's perspective, a Peer is a Worker provider, i.e., a network service that dynamically provides Workers for task execution. From an administrative point of view, a Peer determines how and which machines can be used as workers. * Workers The OurGrid Worker component runs on each machine that will be available for task execution. The Worker provides necessary access functionality to the home machine. It also provides some basic support for instrumentation and fault handling. Furthermore, combined with the OurGrid Peer, it allows for the use of machines in private networks. In practice, any computer connected to the Internet can be used as a worker machine, even if it lies in a different administrative domain or behind a firewall. In Figure 1.1, administrative domains, possibly using their own intranets, are illustrated as rectangles containing Workers. Network of Favours To encourage resource contribution to the network, OurGrid uses a resource allocation mechanism called Network of Favours. The Network of Favours is an autonomous reputation scheme that rewards Peers that contribute more. This way, there is an incentive for each Peer to contribute as much as possible to the system. The OurGrid Community is a peer-to-peer resource sharing system focused on providing resources to BoT applications. The central mission of OurGrid Community is that the sharing be done using the network of favours model. In this model, each Peer offers access to its idle resources to the community. In return, when there is work that exceeds local capacity, a Peer expects to gain access to the idle resources of other participants. The system aims to allow users of BoT applications to easily obtain access and use the community's computational resources, dynamically forming an on-demand, large-scale, grid. Each Peer in the community is an entity that owns a number of resources and occasionally needs more computing power than these resources can provide. Whenever a Peer needs more power, it requests resources to the community. Whenever it has idle resources, it allocates them to one of the requesters. As there are no guarantees about the quality of service obtained from the idle resources donated to the community, not all applications are suitable for OurGrid.

HD 2039 does not have a common, colloquial name that is characteristic of stars like Sirius, Procyon, and Aldebaran. Characteristics HD 2039 is a stable G-type star, meaning it shines with white light that can be seen in the Sun. In terms of mass, the star exhibits almost identical properties. HD 2039 exhibits a radius approximately 40 percent larger than the Sun's. The star is slightly hotter than the Sun; while HD 2039 has a temperature of 5935 K, the Sun's surface temperature lies nearly 200 kelvins lower at 5778 K. HD 2039 is unusually metal-rich, which has attracted the attention of astrophysicists. Distance and visibility The star's magnitude as observed from Earth is 9; this signifies that the body is not visible with the naked eye, but can be seen with a telescope. HD 2039 lies roughly 280 light years from the Sun, which is about as far from the Sun as the second brightest star in the night sky, Canopus. Planetary system In 2002, a planet was found by the Anglo-Australian Planet Search team to be orbiting the star in a very eccentric orbit. It has a minimum mass more than four times that of Jupiter and has an orbital period of over three years. The planet orbits its star at a distance of approximately two AU away; the planet Earth, in comparison, orbits at a distance of one AU away from the Sun. HD 2039 b's discovery was reported quietly; no press release was provided by the observatory that discovered the star's planet, and no formal announcement of the planet's existence was made. The entity was the 100th exoplanet to have been verified by the scientific community.

The North-South Transnational Corridor will run up to in Kazakhstan, in Turkmenistan and in Iran. Work in Turkmenistan commenced in Bereket in December 2007 and in Kazakhstan in July 2009. A section between Bereket and Buzhan in Turkmenistan is being financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). A memorandum of understanding was signed between ADB and the Turkmenistan government in February 2010, for a $350m loan as a special fund for technical assistance. The project loan was for the installation of signalling and communication equipment on the ongoing railway line, procurement of equipment and maintenance facilities, consulting, and for the management and supervision of construction. The project also received a loan of $371.2m from the Islamic Development Bank in July 2010. In May 2013, a Bereket ‚Äì Uzen section of the North-South Railway Corridor was completed. In February 2014, long section between Bereket and Etrek was completed. Currently railway stations along the new railway are being constructed. The Kazakhstan- Turkmenistan-Iran railway link will be officially inaugurated in October 2014. Bereket city (Kazandzhik) is strategically important railway intersection of the Trans-Caspian Railway (Caspian Sea, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and eastern Kazakhstan) and North-South Transnational Railway. The city has a large locomotive repair depot and a modern passenger railway station.

They were core members of the Mississippi Sheiks, who first recorded it in 1930. Vinson claimed to have composed the song one morning after playing at a white dance in Greenwood, Mississippi.Cary Ginell, Milton Brown and the Founding of Western Swing, University of Illinois Press, 1994, p. 284 - It became a popular crossover hit for the band, and was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2008.2008 Grammy Hall of Fame List \\"Sitting on Top of the World\\" has become a standard of traditional American music. The song has been widely recorded in a variety of different styles ‚Äì folk, blues, country, bluegrass, rock ‚Äì often with considerable variations and/or additions to the original verses. The lyrics of the original song convey a stoic optimism in the face of emotional setbacks, and the song has been described as a \\"simple, elegant distillation of the Blues\\". In 2018, it was selected for preservation in the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or artistically significant.\\" Antecedents The title line of \\"Sitting on Top of the World\\" is similar to a well-known popular song of the 1920s, \\"I'm Sitting on Top of the World\\", written by Ray Henderson, Sam Lewis and Joe Young (popularised by Al Jolson in 1926). However the two songs are distinct, both musically and lyrically. Similarities have also been noted between \\"Sitting on Top of the World\\" and an earlier song by Leroy Carr and Scrapper Blackwell, \\"You Got To Reap What You Sow\\" (1929) or that the melody is from an unidentified song by Tampa Red.Tampa Red also recorded \\"You Got to Reap What You Sow\\" in 1929. In May 1930, Charlie Patton recorded a version of the song (with altered lyrics) called \\"Some Summer Day\\"‚ÄòSome Summer Day ‚Äì Version 2‚Äô , The Bluegrass Messengers web-site. During the next few years renditions of \\"Sitting on Top of the World\\" were recorded by a number of artists: the Two Poor Boys, Doc Watson, Big Bill Broonzy, Sam Collins, Milton Brown and His Musical Brownies, and Bob Wills & His Texas Playboys. After Milton Brown recorded it for Bluebird Records the song became a staple in the repertoire of western swing bands. Structure Lyrically \\"Sitting Top of the World\\" has a simple structure consisting of a series of rhyming couplets, each followed by the two-line chorus. The structural economy of the song seems to be conducive to creative invention, giving the song a dynamic flexibility exemplified by the numerous and diverse versions that exist. Harmonically the song differs from a standard 12 bar blues, and though the original has a clearly bluesy harmonic feeling, including blue notes in the melody, there is some disagreement about whether it is really a blues. \\"Sitting Top of the World\\" is a strophic nine-bar blues. Bar nine provides rhythmic separation between stanzas, the end of one stanza and the relatively large pickup at the beginning of the next.The Musical Frameworks of Five Blues Schemes. Nicholas Stoia. Ph. D. Thesis/dissertation. City University of New York. 2008. pages 155, 159,160 Lyrics The numerous versions of \\"Sitting Top of the World\\" recorded since 1930 have been characterized by variations to the original lyrics, as recorded by the Mississippi Sheiks in 1930. \\"Sittin' on Top of the World\\", recorded by Howlin' Wolf in 1957 (and published under his birth name Chester Burnett), is a well-known and widely used version of this song. This was the version recorded by Cream in 1968. Howlin' Wolf shortened the song to just three verses. The first and third verses are similar to the second and fifth verses of the Mississippi Sheiks' song. The middle verse of Howlin' Wolf's version ‚Äì \\"Worked all the summer, worked all the fall / Had to take Christmas, in my overalls\\" ‚Äì was an addition to the 1930 original, but had previously appeared in a version recorded by Ray Charles in 1949. The 'peaches' verse has a long history in popular music. It appears as the chorus of an unpublished song composed by Irving Berlin in May 1914: \\"If you don't want my peaches / You'd better stop shaking my tree\\". The song \\"Mamma's Got the Blues\\", written by Clarence Williams and S. Martin and recorded by Bessie Smith in 1923, has the line: \\"If you don't like my peaches then let my orchard be\\". In her version of \\"St. Louis Blues\\", Ella Fitzgerald sang, \\"If you don't like my peaches, why do you shake my tree? / Stay out of my orchard, and let my peach tree be\\". In 1929 Blind Lemon Jefferson recorded \\"Peach Orchard Mama\\" (\\"... you swore nobody'd pick your fruit but me / I found three kid men shaking down your peaches free\\"). In later years lines using similar imagery were used in \\"Matchbox\\" by Carl Perkins and Jerry Lee Lewis; \\"The Joker\\" by the Steve Miller Band; an early version of \\"Pipeliner Blues\\" by Moon Mullican; and, most directly, \\"If You Don't Want My Peaches, Don't Shake My Tree\\" by Fox. Ahmet Ertegun was able to convince Miller to pay him US$50,000, claiming authorship of the line in his song \\"Lovey Dovey\\". This verse and its ubiquitous usage is an example of the tradition of floating lyrics (also called 'maverick stanzas') in folk-music tradition. 'Floating lyrics' have been described as \\"lines that have circulated so long in folk communities that tradition-steeped singers call them instantly to mind and rearrange them constantly, and often unconsciously, to suit their personal and community aesthetics\\".Carl Lindahl, 'Thrills and Miracles: Legends of Lloyd Chandler', Journal of Folklore Research, Bloomington: May-Dec 2004, Vol. 41, Issue 2/3, pp. 133-72.

The population in 2011 was 1,038,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica (INE), Census 2011 results according to the 2013 administrative division of Portugal in an area of 50.72 km¬≤. Known for its beaches and ties to the ocean, the name Porto Covo likely translates as port of the covos, the term covo referring to a fishing net, used for capturing lobsters and crabs. History island of Pessegueiro one of the first centres of activity in the region, leading back to the Carthaginian and Roman trade and commerce The Forte da Ilha de Dentro along the beach of Pessegueiro The earliest record of human settlement in the area of Porto Covo dates to the Carthaginian trading along the coast. By the time of the conquest of Hispania by Rome, the island of Pessegueiro hosted a small fish processing centre (from archaeological excavation of salt tanks linked to this industry). The parish of Porto Covo, by the middle of the 18th century, was nothing more than a small coastal settlement around a beach and small cove. Its small dimensions was reflected in the number of homes, which numbered only four by 1780. On the island of Pessegueiro, King Phillip II of Spain hoped to found a maritime port to support his claim to the territory and defend against marauding pirates. At that time an artificial rock barrier was constructed to connect the island of Pessegueiro to the coastline. Two forts were constructed on the island, supporting small garrisons to watch over the coast, but today in ruins. Still in the 18th century, the community of Porto Covo began to become an anchorage for the small fishing boats and small businesses. Yet, even these activities were limited, due to the climatic and ocean conditions which limited the port's accessibility. During these periods, it was difficult entering the cove and, in periods when storms came from the southwest, it was not safe attempting landfall on the island of Pessegueiro. The area began to occupy an important role after the capitalist Jacinto Fernandes Bandeira, a member of a merchant classes of the capital appeared around the late part of the 18th century. Born on 28 April 1745, he came from a poor family in Viana do Castelo, working for family in the capital, succeeding and becoming wealthy under the government of the Marquess de Pombal: in 1768, at the age of 23, his was a member of the Inquisition; in 1774, he was made a knight in the Order of Christ; and in 1792, he was a secretary, deputy and, later, inspector in the Junta de Com√©rico (Commission for Commerce). He began using the stylized Bandeira to his name, after being born along the Rua da Bandeira in Viana do Castelo. With his career in ascendancy, Jacinto Fernandes began collecting aristocratic titles, such as the Loyal Knight of the Royal House (), in 1794. He obtained the right to use the name Senhor de Porto Covo after 13 June 1796, for \\"his activity to promote the establishment and settlement of Porto Covo, to benefit agriculture, fishing and promotion of the Corte, in addition to diverse commissions in which he held with satisfaction\\". He realized his project to establish a permanent settlement in Porto Covo, by producing two plans (now archived in the National Archive of Torre do Tombo.The two plans: a map of the planned configuration of Porto Covo for residential and agricultural use (showing the then existent settlement) from between 1789 and 1794; and a second plan by the architect Henrique Guilherme de Oliveira (son of architect Joaquim de Oliveira) from 1789. The first map identified the land under cultivation, urban area and plan for growth, with the island of Pessegueiro and coastal fort identified. The representation shows urban area close to the beach/cove, laid down as a series of parallel and perdendicular streets, with two squares (Pra√ßa do Poleirinho and Pra√ßa do Mercado), a hospital alongside the church, with other buildings logically planned-out, including residences, farms, coal warehouses, hospedes, municipal hall and jail, tax office and fishing suppliers. Jacinto Fernandes became the alcalde of Vila Nova de Milfontes on 14 November 1802 and later the council to the Royal Finances. He was given the title of Baron of Porto Covo on 15 August 1805. While he lived Jacinto Fernandes Bandeira strove to grow the community, a fact that did not influence his successors, following his death on 30 May 1806. A bachelor, he left his enormous fortune to his two nephews, children of his sister, Maria Josefa Cristina Bandeira. It was the eldest nephew, Jacinto Fernandes da Costa Bandeira, that inherited the majority from his uncle, succeeding his uncle as the alcalde of Vila Nova de Milfontes, and second Baron of Porto Covo on 26 February 1822. For his contribution to the Crown, he went as far as Minister for Finances and President of the Bank of Lisbon, eventually achieving the title of Viscount of Porto Covo da Bandeira on 15 September 1843. By this time, Porto Covo had little more than 20 residences: little more than the original nucleus left behind on the death of the first Baron. Porto Covo never really achieved an important place along the Alentejo coast. The area on which it was located remained unsettled; the area between Sines and the River Mira were likely destinations for fishermen and traders then the village. Fishing tended to remain archaic and never really commercialized by its population. Demographically, by 1940, Porto Covo had little more than 55 residences, comprising 246 inhabitants. After 1980 the numbers had grown significantly: 194 residences, comprising 539 inhabitants. Its growth was, in some part, achieved through the development of the Sines Industrial Complex and container port. Porto Covo became a civil parish on 31 December 1984, that included the island of Pessegueiro. Geography The Atlantic Ocean, as seen from Porto Covo The port of Porto Covo, view from the East The civil parish of Porto Covo has of area, and today includes 1400 inhabitants (based on 2008 census). A coastal parish, it is located about south of the municipal seat Sines, but comprises an interior catchment that extends seven kilometres into the interior. While it is fronted to its north by the civil parish of Sines, it is surrounded to the west by the civil parish of Cercal (in the municipality of Santiago do Cac√©m) and south by the civil parish of Vila Nova de Milfontes (in the municipality of Odemira). Its northern frontier extends from the beach of Vieirinha into the interior, until reaching the IC4 motorway (each of Brejos do Morgave) and extending south to the village of Sonega. Its eastern border with Cercal meanders along the foothills until southeast of Herdade da Cabe√ßa da Cabra, before the border joins that of the civil parish of Vila de Milfontes meandering west (following the Ribeira da Azenha) reaching the coast 1.5 kilometres south of the island of Pessegueiro. The space includes, apart from the town of Porto Covo, several other localities, including: Barradinha, Brejos do Morgave, Caeiro, Cabe√ßa da Cabra, Camarneira, Casa Nova, Fonte do Muro, Fonte Nova, Foros da Pouca Farinha, Herdade de Cabe√ßa da Cabra, Monte das Pias and Vale Travesso. The area is part of the Southwest Alentejo and Vicentine Coast Natural Park consisting of protected landscapes and habitats for migratory and endemic species. The original projects for the community never materialized in the plans of Henrique Guilherme de Oliveira. Rather than a seaside settlement, the architect laid-down the settlement further to the interior, mindful of the farmers distance from their lands. The square, although simple, developed from the original plans of the Pombaline-era architects that favoured a visible square grid and squares, the repetition in the facades, the volume and rhythm of the groups of buildings (including the placement of the structures, such as the church). Economy Although characterized as a \\"small fishing community\\", its move towards the tourist market has driven its growth since the 1990s. Influenced by its white, fine sand beaches, natural rock-cliff shores, secluded coves and warm temperatures (water temperatures reaching a minimum 15 ¬∞C), the local economy absorves a constant number of summer visitors and foreign vacationers. During the summer the population increases ten-fold with visitors, who occupy vacation homes, rented apartments and campgrounds, helped by the classification of many of its beaches as Blue Flag beaches, including the popular Praia do Espingardeiro, Praia Pequena and Praia dos Buizinhos. In front of the island of Pessegueiro is one of the more popular beaches, attracting windsurfers, boaters and sport fishermen to the waters off the coast. Alongside the beach of Pessegueiro is the 17th-century fortress, partially destroyed by the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. On the island of Pessegueiro, which inspired the contemporary musician Rui Veloso to pen a composition, is another 17th-century fortress, the ruins of a Roman porto and 15th-century chapel. These have also attracted visitors, as boats regularly visit the island for visits, or fishing around its waters.

She married Thomas Quiney, a vintner of Stratford-upon-Avon. The circumstances of the marriage, including Quiney's misconduct, may have prompted the rewriting of Shakespeare's will. Thomas was struck out, while Judith's inheritance was attached with provisions to safeguard it from her husband. The bulk of Shakespeare's estate was left, in an elaborate fee tail, to his elder daughter Susanna and her male heirs. Judith and Thomas Quiney had three children. By the time of Judith Quiney's death, she had outlived her children by many years. She has been depicted in several works of fiction as part of an attempt to piece together unknown portions of her father's life.  Birth and early life  Judith Shakespeare's \\"pigtail\\" mark (a cursive \\"J\\" facing down). The given name and surname were added by a law clerk. Judith Shakespeare was the daughter of William Shakespeare and Anne Hathaway. She was the younger sister of Susanna and the twin sister of Hamnet. Hamnet, however, died at the age of eleven.Chambers, E. K. William Shakespeare: A Study of Facts and Problems. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1930, 2 vols. I: 18.Schoenbaum, S. William Shakespeare: A Compact Documentary Life. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1977, p. 94.

The twins were named after a husband and wife, Hamnet and Judith Sadler, who were friends of the parents. Hamnet Sadler was a baker in Stratford. Unlike her father and her husband, Judith Shakespeare was probably illiterate. In 1611, she witnessed the deed of sale of a house for ¬£131 () to William Mountford, a wheelwright of Stratford, from Elizabeth Quiney, her future mother-in-law, and Elizabeth's eldest son Adrian. Judith signed twice with a mark instead of her name.Schoenbaum, S. Shakespeare's Lives. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1970, p. 28.  Marriage  Holy Trinity Church, Stratford upon Avon, where Judith was married. View from the opposite bank of the River Avon. On 10 February 1616, Judith Shakespeare married Thomas Quiney, a vintner of Stratford, in Holy Trinity Church. The assistant vicar, Richard Watts, who later married Quiney's sister Mary, probably officiated. The wedding took place during the pre-Lenten season of Shrovetide, which was a prohibitive time for marriages. In 1616, the period in which marriages were banned without dispensation from the church, including Ash Wednesday and Lent, started on 23 January, Septuagesima Sunday and ended on 7 April, the Sunday after Easter. Hence the marriage required a special licence issued by the Bishop of Worcester, which the couple had failed to obtain. Presumably they had posted the required banns in church, since Walter Wright of Stratford was cited for marrying without banns or licence: but this was not considered sufficient.Schoenbaum 1977, p. 292. The infraction was a minor one apparently caused by the minister, as three other couples were also wed that February. Quiney was nevertheless summoned by Walter Nixon to appear before the Consistory court in Worcester. (This same Walter Nixon was later involved in a Star Chamber case and was found guilty of forging signatures and taking bribes). Quiney failed to appear by the required date. The register recorded the judgement, which was excommunication, on or about 12 March 1616. It is unknown if Judith was also excommunicated, but in any case the punishment did not last long. In November of the same year they were back in church for the baptism of their firstborn child.Schoenbaum 1977, 293. The marriage did not begin well. Quiney had recently impregnated another woman, Margaret Wheeler, who died in childbirth along with her child; both were buried on 15 March 1616. A few days later, on 26 March, Quiney appeared before the Bawdy Court, which dealt, among other things, with \\"whoredom and uncleanliness.\\" Confessing in open court to \\"carnal copulation\\" with Margaret Wheeler, he submitted himself for correction and was sentenced to open penance \\"in a white sheet (according to custom)\\" before the Congregation on three Sundays. He also had to admit to his crime, this time wearing ordinary clothes, before the Minister of Bishopton in Warwickshire. The first part of the sentence was remitted, essentially letting him off with a five-shilling fine to be given to the parish's poor. As Bishopton had no church, but only a chapel, he was spared any public humiliation.Schoenbaum 1977, pp. 293‚Äì94.  Chapel Lane, Atwood's and The Cage  Where the Quineys lived after their marriage is unknown: but Judith owned her father's cottage on Chapel Lane, Stratford; while Thomas had held, since 1611, the lease on a tavern called \\"Atwood's\\" on High Street. The cottage later passed from Judith to her sister as part of the settlement in their father's will. In July 1616 Thomas swapped houses with his brother-in-law, William Chandler, moving his vintner's shop to the upper half of a house at the corner of High Street and Bridge Street.Schoenbaum 1977, p. 294. This house was known as \\"The Cage\\" and is the house traditionally associated with Judith Quiney. In the 20th century The Cage was for a time a Wimpy Bar before being turned into the Stratford Information Office.Schoenbaum 1977, p. 5. The Cage provides further insight into why Shakespeare would not have trusted Judith's husband. Around 1630 Quiney tried to sell the lease on the house but was prevented by his kinsmen. In 1633, to protect the interests of Judith and the children, the lease was signed over to the trust of John Hall, Susanna's husband, Thomas Nash, the husband of Judith's niece, and Richard Watts, vicar of nearby Harbury, who was Quiney's brother-in-law and who had officiated at Thomas and Judith's wedding. Eventually, in November 1652, the lease to The Cage ended up in the hands of Thomas' eldest brother, Richard Quiney, a grocer in London.Schoenbaum 1977, p. 295.  William Shakespeare's last will and testament  Nash's House, standing adjacent to the site of New Place The inauspicious beginnings of Judith's marriage, in spite of her husband and his family being otherwise unexceptional, has led to speculation that this was the cause for William Shakespeare's hastily altered last will and testament. He first summoned his lawyer, Francis Collins, in January 1616. On 25 March he made further alterations, probably because he was dying and because of his concerns about Quiney.Schoenbaum 1977, p. 297. In the first bequest of the will there had been a provision \\"vnto my sonne in L[aw]\\"; but \\"sonne in L[aw]\\" was then struck out, with Judith's name inserted in its stead.Chambers 1930, II: pp. 169‚Äì80. To this daughter he bequeathed ¬£100 () \\"in discharge of her marriage porcion\\"; another ¬£50 (¬£ in ) if she were to relinquish the Chapel Lane cottage; and, if she or any of her children were still alive at the end of three years following the date of the will, a further ¬£150 (¬£ in ), of which she was to receive the interest but not the principal. This money was explicitly denied to Thomas Quiney unless he were to bestow on Judith lands of equal value. In a separate bequest, Judith was given \\"my broad silver gilt bole.\\" Finally, for the bulk of his estate, which included his main house, New Place, his two houses on Henley Street and various lands in and around Stratford, Shakespeare had set up an entail. His estate was bequeathed, in descending order of choice, to the following: 1) his daughter, Susanna Hall; 2) upon Susanna's death, \\"to the first sonne of her bodie lawfullie yssueing & to the heires Males of the bodie of the saied first Sonne lawfullie yssueing\\"; 3) to Susanna's second son and his male heirs; 4) to Susanna's third son and his male heirs; 5) to Susanna's \\"ffourth ... ffyfth sixte & Seaventh sonnes\\" and their male heirs; 6) to Elizabeth Hall, Susanna and John Hall's firstborn, and her male heirs; 7) to Judith and her male heirs; or 8) to whatever heirs the law would normally recognise. This elaborate entail is usually taken to indicate that Thomas Quiney was not to be entrusted with Shakespeare's inheritance, although some have speculated that it might simply indicate that Susanna was the favoured child.  Children  Judith and Thomas Quiney had three children: # Shakespeare (baptised 23 November 1616 ‚Äì buried 8 May 1617) # Richard (baptised 9 February 1618 ‚Äì buried 6 February 1639) # Thomas (baptised 23 January 1620 ‚Äì buried 28 January 1639) Shakespeare was named for his grandfather. Richard's name was common among the Quineys: his paternal grandfather and an uncle were named Richard.Chambers 1930, II: 8, 11.Chambers 1930, II: 104. Shakespeare Quiney died at six months of age. Richard and Thomas Quiney were buried within one month of each other, 21 and 19 years old respectively. The cause of death of her two elder sons is not known for certain. The deaths of all of Judith's children resulted in new legal consequences. The entail on her father's inheritance led Susanna, along with her daughter and son-in-law, to make a settlement using a rather elaborate legal device for the inheritance of her own branch of the family. Legal wrangling continued for another thirteen years, until 1652.Chambers 1930, II: 179‚Äì80.  Death  Judith Quiney died by 9 February 1662, the day of her burial and a week after her 77th birthday. She outlived her last surviving child by 23 years.Schoenbaum 1977, p. 318.Chambers1930, p. 13. She was buried in the grounds of Holy Trinity Church, but the exact location of her grave is unknown. Of her husband, the records show little of his later years. It has been speculated that he may have died in 1662 or 1663, when the parish burial records are incomplete, or that he may have left Stratford-upon-Avon. He is known to have had a nephew, living in London, who by this time was holding the lease to The Cage.  Literary references  Judith unwisely allows a young man to have a preliminary look at her father's manuscript of The Tempest, a scene from William Black's Judith Shakespeare, illustrated by Edwin Austin Abbey Judith is portrayed in William Black's Judith Shakespeare: Her Love Affairs and Other Adventures, published serially in Harper's Magazine in 1884. She is one of the main characters in Edward Bond's 1973 play Bingo, which portrays the last years of her father, in retirement in Stratford on Avon. She also appears in one of the final stories in Neil Gaiman's graphic novel, The Sandman. Gaiman compared Judith with the character Miranda from Shakespeare's The Tempest.Gaiman, Neil, et al. The Wake. New York: DC Comics, 1997. She is the subject of the 2003 novel My Father Had a Daughter: Judith Shakespeare's Tale by Grace Tiffany.Schaal, Carol. in Notre Dame Magazine Online , University of Notre Dame, 12 July 2004. Archived article accessed 9 August 2007. The radio play Judith Shakespeare by Nan Woodhouse portrays her as \\"a loner, yearning to be a part of her playwright father's life\\". She travels to London to join him and has a troubling affair with a young aristocrat.Radio 4 Extra: Judith Shakespeare \\"Shakespeare's Daughter\\" is the title of a short story by Mary Burke that was short-listed for a 2007 Hennessy/Sunday Tribune Irish Writer prize. In A Room of One's Own, Virginia Woolf created a character, \\"Judith Shakespeare\\", although she is supposed to be Shakespeare's sister rather than his daughter. Besides the similar names and setting, there is no other direct connection between Judith, Shakespeare's daughter, and Woolf's creation, and in fact Shakespeare's sister was named Joan. In Woolf's story Shakespeare's sister is denied the education of her brother despite her obvious talent. When her father tries to marry her off, she runs away to join a theatre company but is ultimately rejected because of her gender. She becomes pregnant, is abandoned by her partner, and commits suicide. Woolf's Judith was created in an attempt to fill a historical gap. Woolf was making a point about the struggle that a female poet and playwright would have had in the Elizabethan age. Woolf speculated as to why there were so few talented women from that time. \\"What I find deplorable,\\" she observed, \\"is that nothing is known about women before the eighteenth century.\\"Ezell, Margaret J.

Early life Le Couteur was born at Kyneton, Victoria, the only son of George, a pharmaceutical chemist, and his wife Fanny. Both parents were Methodist and Australian born. He was educated at Middle Park State School and Warrnambool Academy before serving a pharmacy apprenticeship. Academic career In 1903 he entered the University of Melbourne to study arts and in 1904 he won a Queen's College residential scholarship. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1906 and was a triple blue in cricket, football and lawn tennis. After beginning a medical degree in 1907 Le Couteur won the Victorian Rhodes Scholarship for 1908 and, with a Melbourne Master of Arts, proceeded to University College, Oxford. He won an Oxford cricket blue and in 1911 a place in Wisden for making 160 runs and taking 11 wickets for 69 against Cambridge. He played regularly for Gentlemen versus Players and wrote magazines on the psychology of cricket. He was also a member of the Oxford String Quartette. Le Couteur then studied experimental psychology at the University of Bonn, Germany until early 1913 when he was appointed lecturer in mental and moral philosophy in the newly established University of Western Australia. In that year he married Emma, the musically gifted daughter of Edward Sugden. Headmaster In 1918 Le Couteur was appointed headmaster of Methodist Ladies' College, Melbourne. The position proved difficult, as control of the school was shared with the foundation president, who was a bulwark against reform. For ten years Le Couteur served on various university committees and school councils and captained the Hawthorn-East Melbourne Cricket Club. Unsuccessful in applications for the headship of Sydney Grammar School in 1921 and the mastership of Queen's in 1927, he became headmaster of Hale School in 1929. In 1931 he was appointed headmaster of Newington College succeeding the Rev Dr Charles Prescott. Le Couteur's term at Newington covered the difficult Depression and war years, yet saw a remarkable increase in pupils and the opening of a preparatory school, Wyvern House, in 1938. With his wife Le Couteur developed the school's musical life. On retirement in 1948 he maintained an interest in the Fairbridge Farm School movement. He died in Gunnedah, New South Wales, and was survived by his wife, two daughters and three sons. See also * List of Victoria first-class cricketers References * A. G.

The game features firefighters in realistic situations saving civilians in burning buildings, mining incidents, and industrial accidents. It was released on the Wii Virtual Console in Japan on March 1, 2011, in the PAL region on April 29, 2011, and in North America on August 25, 2011. Gameplay The player-controlled character fights a fire. The Ignition Factor is a 2D adventure where the player controls a firefighter through emergency situations in differing locations. Each level consists of multiple rooms, areas, or building floors where players can possibly explore, extinguish fires, and rescue people. Most levels dictate a specific number of people that must be saved within a set time limit for the mission to be considered a success. Fire spreads throughout an area automatically, and the player can be injured when touching a patch of fire on screen. The player can also be harmed by falling through holes in the floor. The player has various tools of firefighting at their disposal. Before a level begins, the player may choose the primary and secondary equipment with which they wish to begin the level. Only one of each type of equipment can be equipped at once. Primary equipment consists of an oxygen mask and tank and three types of fire extinguishers that correspond to the different types of fires that can be encountered in the game; regular, chemical, and electrical. These fires and their extinguishers are red-orange, green, and blue, respectively. As these are used, a counter goes from 99 to 0. The counter of the regular extinguisher rapidly increases back to 99 after a brief period of inactivity, while the oxygen tank and mask and the other extinguishers can only go back to 99 after being resupplied by allies in the level. Secondary equipment consists of a firefighter's axe, a rope for crossing gaps, a metal pole to reveal holes by checking for weak places in the floor, plastic explosives to blow through debris and certain wall sections, and CO2 bombs to extinguish large areas of fire. Only five plastic explosives and CO2 bombs can be carried at one time and can be replenished by an ally on the map. Controls The direction pad is used to direct the character on screen. Pressing the pad twice in one direction causes the character to sprint. Though the character can walk diagonally, he can not run diagonally. The character can jump with the use of the B button and can kick in jammed doors with the X button. The Y and A buttons are used to initiate the actions of the primary equipment and the secondary equipment that are equipped respectively. The use of the Start button pauses the game and brings up the inventory screen while the select button pauses the game and brings up the map screen. The character is only capable of carrying five items (including the required red extinguisher/oxygen tank and mask) before their weight begins to affect his actions. While carrying five or six items, he is incapable of running or kicking but he will still walk at his normal speed. If he carries seven or more items not only can he not run or kick, his walking speed is drastically reduced. Failing a mission occurs when the player either dies or runs out of time. The player is then shown a screen that displays the number of chances left (the game's term for continues) and is given the choice to try again, quit, or enter a password. The game allows the player a total of three chances. If the player chooses the try again, one chance is consumed and the player is returned to the level select screen and allowed to select a different level or retry the same level. If all chances are used, the game is over. Reception After its American debut in 1995,Nintendo Power, volume 69 (page 112). The Ignition Factor has received varying levels of critical response. Electronic Gaming Monthlys four reviewers gave it their \\"Game of the Month\\" award, commenting that the game is an excellent test of the player's wits, the graphics are impressive, and the numerous ways to solve each problem ensures that every playthrough is unique. GamePro gave it a far more mixed review, criticizing that the graphics are average, the voice is annoying, and the controls are very touchy. They nonetheless concluded that \\"The Ignition Factor is a relatively fun strategy game.\\" Next Generation was still more critical, faulting the game chiefly for its lack of originality: \\"At first glance, the fire-fighting angle promises a new game play experience, but the title is a repackaged version of older games like Capcom's Commando and Sega's Alien Syndrome. ... The action is good, but stages are repetitive, and mostly just rearrange the placement of hostages without adding any significantly new gameplay.\\" Next Generation reviewed the game a second time, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"The game is fast and furious, but it's over fairly quick, too. A few more levels might have put this over the edge.\\" See also * The Firemen - SNES game where the player controls Pete, the fire fighter References External links *Fire Fighting at Jaleco Category:1994 video games Category:Jaleco games Category:Super Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Virtual Console games Category:Virtual Console games for Wii U Category:Video games about firefighting ","title":"The Ignition Factor"},{"id":"11740284","text":"The Type CQ is a licensed Chinese variant of the M16 rifle manufactured by Norinco. According to the Norinco website, the rifle is officially known as CQ 5.56.https://web.archive.org/web/20070912175726/http://www.norincoequipment.cn/detail_product_English.jsp?productid=492&cssid;=1 It can be distinguished from other AR-15 and M-16 pattern rifles by its long, revolver-like pistol grip, somewhat rounded handguards, and the unique shape of its stock. History The CQ was first introduced in the early 1980s. This weapon is chambered for 5.56√ó45mm NATO cartridges and it was intended for export sales.Modern Firearms' CQ-311 Page. Like Chinese copies of the US M14 Rifle the CQ never saw wide Military use. However semi-auto sporter copies have made much success in civilian sales. Retrieved August 10, 2007. Two variants of the CQ rifle are made: the CQ 5.56, also known as the CQ-311 or CQ M-311, the select-fire variant for Military/LE sales; and the CQ M311-1, the semiautomatic version for the civilian market. Later, a carbine variant has been introduced, called the CQ 5.56mm Type A. The Semi-auto sporter have been successful in the civilian market, the Canadian one in particular. The CQ was never adopted by the Chinese military or even unofficially distributed within Chinese troops. Other military uses of the Type CQ assault rifle have been reported within guerrilla and insurgent movements in the South-East Asian area. Differences Though it has the same look as the M16 rifle, there are some modifications to various parts. The most immediately recognizable distinguishing features that tell the Type CQ apart from an M16 rifle are its distinctive handguard and stock, curved pistol grip, and hooded front sight. The Type CQ rifle, in both its Military/LE and Civilian variants, has a 1:12 rifling pitch which allows it to properly stabilize the M193 \\"Ball\\" variant of the 5.56mm ammunition or the Type CJ Chinese clone, as well as any .223 Remington commercial cartridge variant that can be stabilized by the 1:12 pitch rifling barrel (normally Varmint or other simple sporter cartridges, up to a maximum bullet weight of 55 Grains). The M193 \\"Ball\\" 5.56mm cartridge was never a NATO standard until the adoption of this weapon system by other nations. Type CQ is chambered in \\"5.56√ó45mm NATO\\", but it will not properly stabilize the NATO standard 5.56mm ammunition (the SS109, M855 in US service), which requires a 1:9 or 1:7 pitch rifling barrel due to a bullet weight of 62 Grains.

Type CQ assault rifle Also known as the CQ 5'56, the CQ-311 or the CQ M-311, this is the select-fire assault rifle version intended for military and police use. It is a gas- operated, rotating-bolt full-automatic firearm that feeds from factory-made 20- or 30-round magazines (STANAG magazine clones), firing the M193 \\"Ball\\" 5.56√ó45mm NATO cartridge (manufactured in China by Norinco as the Type CJ cartridge). The Type CQ rifle has a three-position fire selector: Safe, Single Shot, and Full-Automatic fire. The weapon sports a 508mm (19.9 inches) barrel with a 1:12 rifling twist. The main differences within this weapon and the original American-made M16 are in the shape of some metal and plastic parts (namely the stock, the grip, the handguard, and the flash suppressor), and in the type of metal the rifle is made of. While the American AR-15/M16 rifles are built in T70-74 aluminum, the Chinese Type CQ is built in T60-60 aluminum, used to allow the process of metal injection molding to be used instead of forging. According to the manufacturer's website, the Type CQ assault rifle can be equipped with an under-carried grenade launcher. Norinco manufactures several models of grenade launchers in different calibers, generally clones of the American M203 (known as the LG2-I and LG2-II) or to the Russian GP-25/GP-30 (known as the LG-1, seen mated to the QBZ-95 assault rifle), and a wide array of anti-riot underbarrel launchers. However, seen the lack on the Type CQ assault rifle of a quick-attachment/detachment design hand guard as instead present on the American M16A2 assault rifle and M4 carbine, the installation of an underbarrel grenade launcher on the Type CQ assault rifle requires partial replacement of the handguard.Chinese 40mm LG2-I grenade launcher underslung on Norinco Type CQ assault rifle . Retrieved April 27, 2008. Type CQ semi-automatic rifle Also known as the CQ 311-1 or the CQ M311-1, this rifle is the civilian version of the above-mentioned Military model. Nothing changes from the select-fire version, except that the CQ M311-1 rifle is not capable of fully automatic fire, and that the most recently manufactured models shift from the distinctive Type CQ curved pistol grip and hooded front sight to more standard parts, similar to the ones found on other AR-15 rifles. It is manufactured with a semi-automatic only trigger group, and the selector switch only has two positions, for Safety and Fire. The 1:12 barrel rifling allows the rifle to properly shoot and stabilize light .223 Remington commercial cartridges (55 grains & under) and the military surplus 5.56√ó45mm M193 \\"Ball\\" ammunition widely available on the market. The CQ M311-1 was first available in the North American market in 1987, when only 500 units were sold before the import was halted; reasons for this halt are stated to be several by many sources: the restrictions applied in the United States since 1989 (an import ban signed by George H. W. Bush on 41 types of military-style firearms in the aftermath of the Stockton massacre), a copyright infringement lawsuit from Colt against Norinco or an agreement between the two companies; however none of these assumptions can be supported by official confirms. The CQ M311-1 semiautomatic rifle is today available in Canada, while any further import into the United States still remains impossible due to restrictions that apply since 1986 and after other pieces of legislation passed in the 1990s and in the early 2000s. The gun is also available in Europe (particularly Italy), where it is sold with a 10-rounds detachable clear plastic magazine manufactured in the United States by DPMS Panther Arms (this because the Norinco CQ M311-1 rifles and the DPMS Panther Arms products are imported in Italy by the company NUOVA JAGER srl).Norinco Type CQ M-311 semi- automatic rifle equipped with 5-rounds translucent plastic magazine manufactured in the United States by DPMS Panther Arms.

He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Pittsburgh Pirates, Washington Nationals, Milwaukee Brewers, and Cleveland Indians, in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) for the Yokohama DeNA BayStars, and in the KBO League for the Hanwha Eagles. Morgan has mainly played center field during his MLB career. In his youth Morgan played ice hockey, reaching the Major Junior level with the Regina Pats of the Western Hockey League in 1999-2000\\\\. Following that season, Morgan turned his focus exclusively to baseball and was drafted by the Pirates in the 33rd round of the 2002 MLB draft. Early life Morgan was born in San Francisco. When he was seven years old, he became interested in playing ice hockey after watching the ice hockey tournament at the 1988 Winter Olympics on television. When Morgan was 16, after playing in numerous tournaments across the United States and Canada, he was recruited by the Vernon Vipers of the British Columbia Hockey League (BCHL). Although Morgan did not make the Vipers' team after participating in its training camp, he played two games with the team during the 1996‚Äì97 season as an affiliate player in which he recorded ten penalty minutes. He spent the remainder of the 1996‚Äì97 season with the North Okanagan Knights of the Kootenay International Junior Hockey League. The following season, he played for the Nelson Leafs of the Rocky Mountain Junior Hockey League. During the 1998‚Äì99 season, Morgan again played for a new team, this time for the Delta Ice Hawks of the Pacific International Junior Hockey League. The following season, Morgan made the transition from the junior \\"B\\" Ice Hawks to the major junior Regina Pats of the Western Hockey League (WHL). In seven games with the Pats during the 1999‚Äì2000 WHL season, Morgan scored two goals and recorded twenty penalty minutes. Both of his goals were scored in his first career WHL game, after which he was named the first star of the game. Following his seven games with the Pats, Morgan was released and joined the Prince George Spruce Kings of the BCHL for three games in which he scored one assist and fifteen penalty minutes.  Baseball career   Pittsburgh Pirates  The Pittsburgh Pirates selected Morgan in the 33rd round of the 2002 Major League Baseball draft. Morgan batting for the Pittsburgh Pirates in 2009 On September 1, 2007, Morgan made his major league debut for the Pirates against the Milwaukee Brewers as a late-season call-up. On September 14, 2007, Morgan made a catch in Minute Maid Park's center field that proved the difference in a 4‚Äì3 Pirates win.

Article. Retrieved August 31, 2009. After a poor start to the season, he was optioned to the Triple-A affiliate Indianapolis Indians. Morgan made several appearances for the Pirates, but spent most of his season in Indianapolis until a productive September call up to the parent club. Morgan overcame an unimpressive spring training in 2009 to claim the job of starting left fielder. Building on his positive second half of 2008, he proved himself to be a fan favorite, often referring to left field as \\"Morgantown\\". Although he stole 42 bases in 2009 (second in the league to Michael Bourn), he was caught 17 times‚Äîtied for the most in the majors.  Washington Nationals On June 30, 2009, Morgan was traded to the Washington Nationals along with pitcher Sean Burnett in exchange for outfielder Lastings Milledge and pitcher Joel Hanrahan. On August 27, he fractured his hand sliding into third base, and was placed on the 15-day disabled list the following day\\"Nationals place CF Nyjer Morgan on 15-day DL, select contract INF Pete Orr from Triple-A Syracuse.\\" August 28, 2009. Article. Retrieved August 31, 2009. Morgan with the Washington Nationals in 2009 In a May 22, 2010, game against the Baltimore Orioles, Morgan, playing center field, jumped for a fly ball hit by Adam Jones which hit his glove and caromed away. Morgan thought he had knocked the ball over the fence for a home run, and reacted by angrily throwing his glove to the ground and walking away. Left fielder Josh Willingham retrieved the ball and threw it towards home plate, but not in time to prevent Jones from achieving an inside-the-park home run. As he left the field at the end of the inning, Morgan heard a chorus of boos from the crowd. On July 22, 2010, Morgan became the first Nationals player to steal three bases in one game. For the 2010 season, he was third in the league in steals (34), and led the league in the number of times caught stealing (17). On August 25, 2010, Morgan was given a seven-game suspension for allegedly throwing a ball at a fan during a game against the Philadelphia Phillies at Citizens Bank Park; Morgan appealed the suspension. On August 31, Morgan ran into Marlins catcher Brett Hayes; the collision separated Hayes' shoulder. The next day, Morgan was hit by a pitch in the 4th inning, by Florida Marlins pitcher Chris Volstad. Later that night, Volstad threw a ball that went behind Morgan. Incensed by the pitch, Morgan charged the mound, taking a swing at Volstad before being clotheslined by Marlins first-baseman Gaby S√°nchez, leading to a bench clearing fight. MLB suspended Morgan for eight games and fined him an undisclosed amount. The suspension from the September 1 brawl was upheld on appeal, and Morgan started serving his eight-game suspension on September 17. The league also gave him a $15,000 fine in addition to the eight game suspension. The incident came just days after Morgan ran into St. Louis Cardinals backup catcher Bryan Anderson in spite of the fact that the Cardinals catcher didn't have the ball and had stepped away from the plate.  Milwaukee Brewers Morgan batting for the Milwaukee Brewers in 2011 On March 27, 2011, Morgan was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers in exchange for prospect Cutter Dykstra (son of baseball player Lenny Dykstra). Morgan fractured his middle finger in the 8th inning on a sacrifice bunt against Jonny Venters. After two separate stints on the disabled list, he joined Carlos G√≥mez in a platoon in center field with G√≥mez in the lineup versus left-handed pitchers and Morgan in the lineup versus righties. On June 8 against the New York Mets, Morgan recorded his first walk-off hit with a double down the right field line at Miller Park to win the game 7‚Äì6. After the game, Morgan said that he did not know it was a walk-off until he saw his teammates running out onto the field. In 2011, he batted .304 and was third in the NL in hit by pitch (14) and sacrifice hits (15). On October 7, Morgan had a series-clinching walk-off base hit in the 10th inning of Game 5 of the NLDS against the Arizona Diamondbacks. The Brewers won the game 3‚Äì2, giving the Brewers their first playoff series win since 1982. Morgan was widely criticized for twice yelling out obscenities on live TV immediately after the Brewers won the National League Division Series on October 7, 2011. On January 16, 2012, Morgan signed a one-year, $2.35 million deal during his first run- through of arbitration eligibility. In the 2012 season, Morgan batted .239 in 122 games, with 12 stolen bases (and five times caught stealing). The Brewers did not offer Morgan a major-league contract for the 2013 season, and he refused an assignment to the Brewers' Class AAA minor league team, the Nashville Sounds. Yokohama DeNA BayStars In January 2013, Morgan signed a contract to play for the Yokohama DeNA BayStars of the Central League in Nippon Professional Baseball. He batted .294 with 11 home runs in 108 games for the BayStars. Cleveland Indians On January 14, 2014, Morgan announced that he had signed a minor league contract with an invitation to Spring training with the Cleveland Indians. Due to Michael Bourn starting the season on the disabled list, Morgan earned a spot on the 25-man roster and started the 2014 season as the starting center fielder and leadoff hitter. On August 5, 2014, he was released. Hanwha Eagles In December 2014, he signed with the Hanwha Eagles of Korea Baseball Organization on a one-year $700,000 contract. Pericos de Puebla In December 2015, he signed with the Pericos de Puebla of the Mexican League. During the 2016 season he hit for an average of .306 while stealing 22 bases and showing surprising power with 11 home runs as he played Leftfield/Centerfield and leadoff the batting order as he played in 101 of the team's 110 regular season games. He was named to the Mexican League All-Star team and was brilliant both in the field and at the plate during the playoffs that resulted in the first League Championship for Puebla in 30 years. Acereros de Monclova On February 21, 2017, Morgan, along with Chad Gaudin, Daric Barton, Manny Rodriguez, Rodolfo Amador, and Willy Taveras, were traded to the Acereros de Monclova in exchange for RHP Joaqu√≠n Lara.  Personal life  Morgan frequently refers to himself as \\"Tony Plush\\", which he says is his \\"name on the field\\" or his \\"gentleman's name.\\" Under his nickname, Morgan will occasionally make a hand signal to look like a \\"T\\" after reaching base. In 2011, he created his own Twitter account, where he published wacky pictures such as himself dressed as a cowboy. With over 80,000 followers, he often tweeted after games using his catchphrase \\"AAAAAHHHH GOTTA GO!\\" Morgan has one daughter, Niah, who was born in Regina, Saskatchewan during his tenure with the Western Hockey League's Regina Pats. Morgan relinquished custody of Niah in order to pursue his athletic career. In 2017, Morgan had a son. In 2018, Morgan threw the first pitch of the NLDS at Miller Park on his son's first birthday. On February 1, 2012, Morgan had the opportunity to join an on-ice practice with the San Jose Sharks of the National Hockey League. He said that it was \\"dream come true\\", and he received high praise from All-Star player Joe Thornton, who controversially said that Morgan was \\"actually a pretty good skater.\\"  References  External links , or Retrosheet *Yahoo!

He was a younger son of Aonghus M√≥r mac Domhnaill, Lord of Islay. After the latter's apparent death, the chiefship of the kindred was assumed by Aonghus √ìg's elder brother, Alasdair √ìg Mac Domhnaill. Most of the documentation regarding Aonghus √ìg's career concerns his support of Edward I, King of England against supporters of John, King of Scotland. The latter's principal adherents on the western seaboard of Scotland were Clann Dubhghaill, regional rivals of Clann Domhnaill. Although there is much uncertainty concerning the Clann Domhnaill chiefship at this period in history, at some point after Alasdair √ìg's apparent death at the hands of Clann Dubhghaill in 1299, Aonghus √ìg seems to have taken up the chiefship as Lord of Islay. Pressure from Clann Domhnaill and other supporters of the English Crown evidently compelled Clann Dubhghaill into coming onside with the English in the first years of the fourteenth century. However, when Robert Bruce VII, Earl of Carrick murdered the Scottish claimant John Comyn III, Lord of Badenoch in 1306, and subsequently made himself King of Scotland (as Robert I), Clann Domhnaill seems to have switched their allegiance to Robert I in an effort to gain leverage against Clann Dubhghaill. Members of Clann Domhnaill almost certainly harboured the latter in 1306, when he was doggedly pursued by adherents of the English Crown. Following Robert I's successful consolidation of the Scottish kingship, Aonghus √ìg and other members of his kindred were rewarded with extensive grants of territories formerly held by their regional opponents. According to the late fourteenth-century Bruce, Aonghus √ìg participated in the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314, Robert I's greatest victory over the English. It is uncertain when Aonghus √ìg died. It could have been before or after the death of an unknown member of the clan at the Battle of Faughart in 1318‚Äîa man who seems to have held the chiefship at the time. Certainly, E√≥in Mac Domhnaill‚ÄîAonghus √ìg's lawful son by √Åine N√≠ Chath√°in‚Äîheld the chiefship by the 1330s, and became the first member of Clann Domhnaill to rule as Lord of the Isles.

When Alexander III, King of Scotland died in 1286, his acknowledged heir was his granddaughter, Margaret. Although this Norwegian girl was accepted by the magnates of the realm, and betrothed to the heir of Edward I, King of England, she perished on her journey to Scotland, and her death triggered a succession crisis.McDonald (1997) p. 160. The leading claimants to kingship were John Balliol, Lord of Galloway and Robert Bruce V, Lord of Annandale. By common consent, Edward I was invited to arbitrate the dispute. In 1292, John Balliol's claims were accepted, and he was duly inaugurated as King of Scotland.Stell (2005); McDonald (1997) p. 160. Unfortunately for this king, his ambitious English counterpart systematically undermined his royal authority, and John's reign lasted only about four years.Stell (2005); McDonald (1997) pp. 160‚Äì161. In 1296, after John ratified a military treaty with France, and refused to hand over Scottish castles to Edward I's control, the English marched north and crushed the Scots at Dunbar. Edward I's forces proceeded forward virtually unopposed, whereupon Scotland fell under English control.Stell (2005). arms of the Lord of Argyll depicted in the fourteenth-century Balliol Roll.Woodcock; Flower; Chalmers et al.

Although the former was crowned King of Scots (as King Robert I) by March, the English Crown immediately struck back, defeating his forces in June. By September, Robert I was a fugitive, and seems to have escaped into the Hebrides.Barrow (2008); McDonald (1997) pp. 170‚Äì174. There is no certain record of Aonghus √ìg between 1301 and 1306.McDonald (1997) p. 171. According to the highly reliable fourteenth- century Bruce, Aonghus √ìg played an instrumental part in Robert I's survival. Specifically, this source relates that, after Robert I was defeated at Methven and Dalry in the summer of 1306, the king fled into the mountains and made for the coast of Kintyre, where he was protected by Aonghus √ìg himself.McNamee (2012b) ch. 1 ¬∂ 31; McDonald (2006) p. 78; Duncan (2007) pp. 142‚Äì147 bk. 3; McDonald (1997) pp. 171‚Äì174; Mackenzie (1909) pp. 52‚Äì54 bk. 3; Eyre-Todd (1907) p. 50 bk. 3.

In fact, in the immediate aftermath of John Comyn III's murder, Robert I secured control of several western fortresses (including that of Dunaverty), seemingly in an effort to keep a lane open for military assistance from Ireland or the Hebrides.Penman, M (2014) p. 92; Caldwell, DH (2012) p. 284; McNamee (2012b) ch. 1 ¬∂ 23; Duncan (1992) p. 136; Document 5/3/0 (n.d.).

According to the Bruce, Robert I stayed at the castle for three days before fleeing to Rathlin Island.Penman, MA (2014) pp. 68‚Äì69; McNamee (2012a) ch. 5; McNamee (2012b) ch. 2 ¬∂ 4; Young; Stead (2010) p. 90; Duncan (2007) pp. 144‚Äì145, 144‚Äì145 n. 677; McDonald (1997) p. 173; Duffy (1993) p. 180. There is reason to suspect that this account instead masks an historical incident in which the king fled from Kintyre to a Clann Domhnaill castle on Islay‚Äîperhaps Dunyvaig Castle‚Äîthe next northernmost island.Penman, MA (2014) pp. 68‚Äì69; McNamee (2012a) ch. 5; McNamee (2012b) ch. 2 ¬∂ 4; Duncan (2007) pp. 144 n. 659‚Äì78, 145 n. 680, 148 n. 725‚Äì62; Duffy (2002); McDonald (1997) p. 173 n. 49. If the account of Rathlin given by the Bruce actually refers to Islay, it is still uncertain if Aonghus √ìg played any part in the king's salvation. In any case, contemporary sources reveal that Dunaverty Castle succumbed to an English-backed siege in September.McNamee (2012b) chs. introduction ¬∂ 2, 1 ¬∂ 31; Strickland (2008) p. 100; Prestwich (1988) p. 507; Reid, NH (1984) p. 292; List of Diplomatic Documents (1963) p. 209; Bain (1888) p. 488 ¬ß 5; Bain (1884) p. 491 ¬ß¬ß 1833, 1834; Simpson; Galbraith (n.d.) pp. 195 ¬ß 457, 196 ¬ß 465.

The catalyst behind Clann Domhnaill's shift of allegiance from Edward I to Robert I likely lies in local Hebridean politics rather than Scottish patriotism.McDonald (2006) p. 78; Brown (2004) pp. 261‚Äì262; Roberts (1999) p. 131; McDonald (1997) pp. 171‚Äì172. Whilst Edward I's destruction of the Balliol regime in 1296 resulted in Clann Dubhghaill finding itself out of favour with the English regime, Clann Domhnaill seems to have sided with the English Crown in an effort to earn royal support in its localised power struggle with Clann Dubhghaill.McNamee (2012a) ch. 2; Young; Stead (2010) p. 42. To the leading clans on the western seaboard, internecine rivalries appear to have been more of a concern than the greater war over the Scottish Crown.Brown (2004) p. 260. Aonghus √ìg's documented service to the English Crown in the years after Alasdair √ìg's apparent death was almost certainly undertaken in the context of pursuing his kindred's struggle against Clann Dubhghaill. Pressure from Clann Domhnaill and other supporters of the English Crown evidently compelled Clann Dubhghaill into coming onside with the English in the first years of the fourteenth century.Penman, M (2014) p. 72; Watson (2013) ch. 4; McNamee (2012a) ch. 2; Brown (2004) pp. 260‚Äì261; McDonald (1997) p. 171. Whilst Robert I's subsequent murder of John Comyn III undoubtedly galvanised Clann Dubhghaill's new-found alignment with Edward I, it also precipitated Clann Domhnaill's realignment of support from the English Crown to the Bruce cause.McNamee (2012a) chs. 2, 5; McNamee (2012b) ch. 2 ¬∂ 4; Grant (2006) p. 371; Barrow (2005) pp. 211, 378; Brown (2004) pp. 261‚Äì262; Oram (2004) p. 123; McDonald (1997) pp. 171‚Äì172; Lamont (1981) p. 163.

Rewarded service to the Scottish Crown, and a contested chiefship Birch (1905) p. 135 pl. 20. After seizing the throne for himself, this embattled king appears to have partly owed his survival to efforts of Clann Domhnaill and Clann Ruaidhr√≠. In 1307, at about the time of Edward I's death in July, Robert I mounted a remarkable return to power, first striking into Carrick in about February.Young; Stead (2010) pp. 92‚Äì93; Barrow (2008); Barrow (2005) pp. 220‚Äì224; McDonald (1997) pp. 174‚Äì175. By 1309, Robert I's opponents had been largely overcome, and he held his first parliament as king.Barrow (2008). Clann Domhnaill clearly benefited from their support of the Bruce cause. Although no royal charters associated with the kindred exist from this period, there are seventeenth-century charter indices that note several undated royal grants.Penman, MA (2014) p. 66. For instance, Aonghus √ìg was granted the former Comyn lordship of Lochaber and the adjacent regions of Ardnamurchan, Morvern, Duror, and Glencoe;MacDonald, IG (2014) p. 48 n. 136; Penman, M (2014) p. 102; Petre, JS (2014) p. 272; Penman, MA (2014) p. 66; Daniels (2013) p. 25; McNamee (2012a) ch. 10 ¬∂ 25; Boardman, S (2006) pp. 45, 54 n. 52; Barrow (2005) p. 378; Brown (2004) p. 263; Munro, RW; Munro, J (2004); Oram (2004) p. 124; Duffy (2002b) p. 62; Murray (2002) p. 223; McDonald (1997) p. 184, 184 n. 104; Duffy (1993) p. 207 n. 77; Munro; Munro (1986) p. 282 n. 6; Lamont (1981) p. 168; Thomson (1912) p. 512 ¬ß¬ß 56‚Äì58. whilst a certain Alasdair of the Isles received the former Clann Dubhghaill islands of Mull and Tiree.Penman, M (2014) p. 102; Penman, MA (2014) pp. 67‚Äì68; Boardman, S (2006) p. 45; Barrow (2005) p. 378; Brown (2004) p. 263; Murray (2002) p. 224; McDonald (1997) p. 184; Duffy (1993) p. 207 n. 77; Duffy (1991) p. 312; Lamont (1981) p. 168; Steer; Bannerman; Collins (1977) p. 203; Thomson (1912) p. 553 ¬ß 653. Although the indices fail to note any Clann Domhnaill grants concerning Islay and Kintyre it is not inconceivable that the kindred received grants of these territories as well.McNamee (2012a) ch. 10; Barrow (2005) p. 378. Later in the fourteenth century, Aonghus √ìg's son, E√≥in Mac Domhnaill, was granted the territories of Ardnamurchan, Colonsay, Gigha, Glencoe, Jura, Kintyre, Knapdale, Lewis, Lochaber, Morvern, Mull, and Skye. It is possible that the basis for many of these grants laid in the clan's military support of the Bruce cause, and stemmed from concessions gained from the embattled king in about 1306.Penman, MA (2014) pp. 66‚Äì67; Thomson (1912) pp. 482 ¬ß 114; 561 ¬ß 752; Bain (1887) pp. 213‚Äì214 ¬ß 1182; Robertson (1798) p. 48 ¬ß 1. If this was indeed the case, the fact that Robert I later granted a significant portion of these territories (Lochaber, Kintyre, Skye, and lands in Argyll) to other magnates suggests that his conceivable concessions to Clann Domhnaill may have been undertaken with some reluctance.Penman, MA (2014) pp. 66‚Äì67. There is reason to suspect that the Clann Domhnaill chiefship was contested during this period.Duncan (2007) p. 148 n. 725‚Äì62; Penman, MA (2014) pp. 67‚Äì68. For example, the royal grants to Aonghus √ìg and Alasdair of the Isles‚Äîa man whose identity is uncertain‚Äîcould be evidence that these two were competitors.Penman, M (2014) p. 102; Penman, MA (2014) pp. 67‚Äì68.

Furthermore, the Bruce states that when Robert I fled to Dunaverty Castle in 1306 he was fearful of treason during his stay.Penman, M (2014) pp. 102‚Äì103; Penman, MA (2014) p. 68; McNamee (2012a) ch. 5 ¬∂¬∂ 25‚Äì31; McNamee (2012b) ch. 1 ¬∂ 31; Duncan (2007) p. 144‚Äì145 bk. 3; Mackenzie (1909) p. 53 bk. 3; Eyre-Todd (1907) p. 50 bk. 3. One possibility is that this statement preserves a record of the king's vulnerability to competing regional factions. Although the Bruce specifies that the Clann Domhnaill dynast to whom the king owed his salvation was Aonghus √ìg, there is reason to question this claim. If Robert I indeed found protection at a Clann Domhnaill fortress‚Äîlike Dunyvaig Castle‚Äîthe attestations of Domhnall of Islay could indicate that it was he who assisted the king. The Bruce was certainly influenced by later political realities,Penman, MA (2014) pp. 68, 69 n. 21; Cornell (2009) p. xi; Boardman, S (2007) pp. 105‚Äì106, 105 nn. 65, 66; Duncan (2007) p. 148 n. 725‚Äì62; Boardman, S (2006) p. 49 n. 6. and was composed during the reign of Robert II, King of Scotland (reigned 1371‚Äì1390), the father-in-law of E√≥in Mac Domhnaill.Penman, MA (2014) p. 69 n. 21. The fact that this son of Aonghus √ìg ruled as chief when the poem was composed could account for the remarkably favourable light in which Aonghus √ìg is portrayed.Penman, MA (2014) pp. 68, 69 n. 21; Duncan (2007) p. 148 n. 725‚Äì62. If the account of Rathlin Island given by the Bruce actually refers to Islay and Dunyvaig Castle, the description of the island's reluctant inhabitants being forced to assist the king could indicate that he did not trust the Clann Domhnaill lord. Furthermore, the claim that Aonghus √ìg was Lord of Kintyre during this period could stem from the fact that, by the time the Bruce was composed, E√≥in Mac Domhnaill was married to a daughter of the Robert II, and had gained this contested lordship by way of her tocher.Penman, M (2014) p. 102; Penman, MA (2014) p. 66; Boardman, S (2007) p. 105 n. 65; Duncan (2007) pp. 144‚Äì145 bk. 3; Mackenzie (1909) p. 53 bk. 3; Eyre-Todd (1907) p. 50 bk. 3. Seemingly in 1310, whilst in the service of the English Crown, Aonghus √ìg inquired of Edward II, King of England as to whether Alasdair Mac Dubhghaill was within the king's peace, and entreated the king on behalf of several unnamed members of Clann Ruaidhr√≠‚Äîmen were then aiding Aonghus √ìg's English-aligned forces‚Äîto grant these Clann Ruaidhr√≠ clansmen feu of their ancestral lands.Cochran-Yu (2015) p. 59; Cameron (2014) p. 153; Nicholls (2007) p. 92; Barrow (2005) pp. 217, 450 n. 104; McDonald (1997) pp. 167, 169, 190‚Äì191; Duffy (1993) pp. 202‚Äì203, 203 n. 49, 206; Watson (1991) pp. 256, 271; Munro; Munro (1986) p. 281 n. 6; Lamont (1981) pp. 161, 164; Barrow (1973) p. 381; List of Diplomatic Documents (1963) p. 197; Reid, WS (1960) pp. 10‚Äì11; Bain (1884) p. 320 ¬ß 1254; Stevenson, J (1870) p. 436 ¬ß 615; Document 3/31/0 (n.d.c). An indication of the military might at Clann Dubhghaill's disposal may be Aonghus √ìg's expressed opinion that, if he were able to join forces with Alasdair Mac Dubhghaill, Edward II would have nothing to fear from his enemies.Watson (1991) p. 256; List of Diplomatic Documents (1963) p. 197; Bain (1884) p. 320 ¬ß 1254; Stevenson, J (1870) p. 436 ¬ß 615; Document 3/31/0 (n.d.c). The fact that Aonghus √ìg styled himself \\"of Islay\\" in his letter could be evidence that he was indeed acting as chief at this point.McDonald (1997) p. 169. Another letter‚Äîthis one from Hugh to Edward II‚Äîreveals that Hugh, E√≥in Mac Suibhne, and Aonghus √ìg himself, were engaged in maritime operations on behalf of the English Crown, and were enquiring of the king about the status of Alasdair Mac Dubhghaill.Nicholls (2007) p. 92; Barrow (2005) pp. 76, 217; McDonald (1997) p. 167; Duffy (1993) pp. 202‚Äì203, 203 n. 49; Argyll: An Inventory of the Monuments (1992) p. 258; Watson (1991) pp. 256, 271; List of Diplomatic Documents (1963) p. 197; Reid, WS (1960) pp. 10‚Äì11; Bain (1884) p. 320 ¬ß 1253; Stevenson, J (1870) p. 435 ¬ß 614; Document 3/90/11 (n.d.). Participation in the Battle of Bannockburn An imaginative nineteenth-century depiction of Aonghus √ìg at the Battle of Bannockburn.MacDonald; MacDonald (1896) pp. 96‚Äì97. In about October/November 1313, Robert I declared that his opponents had one year to come into his peace or suffer permanent disinheritance. Seemingly in consequence of this declaration, Edward II announced a massive invasion of Scotland.McNamee (2012b) ch. 2 ¬∂ 61, 2 n. 136; Young; Stead (2010) p. 124; Duncan (1992) pp. 149‚Äì150. On 23‚Äì24 June, the English and Scottish royal armies clashed near Stirling at what became known as the Battle of Bannockburn. Although there are numerous accounts of the battle, one of the most important sources is the Bruce,Gledhill (2015). which specifies that the Scottish army was divided into several battalions. According to this source, the king's battalion was composed of men from Carrick, Argyll, Kintyre, the Hebrides, and the Scottish Lowlands.MacGregor (2018); Gledhill (2015); Penman, M (2014) p. 140; Penman, MA (2014) p. 69; McNamee (2012b) ch. 2 n. 28; Brown (2008) p. 118; Duncan (2007) pp. 421‚Äì423 bk. 11; Barrow (2005) p. 275; McDonald (1997) p. 183; Mackenzie (1909) p. 201 bk. 11; Eyre-Todd (1907) p. 191 bk. 11. Although the size of the opposing armies is uncertain,Gledhill (2015); King (2015). the Scottish force was undoubtedly smaller than that of English, and may well have numbered somewhere between five thousandMcNamee (2012b) ch. 2 ¬∂ 63; Young; Stead (2010) p. 129. and ten thousand.Gledhill (2015); Barrow (2008); Barrow (2005) p. 273. The battle resulted in one of the worst military defeats suffered by the English.King (2015). Amongst the Hebridean contingent, the Bruce notes Aonghus √ìg himself.Brown (2008) p. 118; Boardman, S (2007) p. 105; Duncan (2007) p. 421 bk. 11; McDonald (1997) pp. 183‚Äì184; Mackenzie (1909) p. 201 bk. 11; Eyre-Todd (1907) p. 191 bk. 11. According to this source, the king's battalion played a significant part in the conflict: for although it had hung back during the onset of hostilities, the battalion engaged the English at critical point in the fray.Duncan (2007) pp. 486‚Äì487 bk. 13; Barrow (2005) pp. 297‚Äì298, 478 n. 132; McDonald (1997) p. 183; Mackenzie (1909) pp. 229‚Äì231 bk. 13; Eyre-Todd (1907) pp. 219‚Äì220 bk. 13. In any event, just as with the episode at Dunaverty, John Barbour's association of Aonghus √ìg with Bannockburn could well be influenced by later political realities.Boardman, S (2007) p. 105, 105 n. 66. However, John Barbour's account is recognised as highly accurate, and there is no evidence giving a reason to question the point. Clann Domhnaill's part in the Bruce campaign in Ireland The arms of the Earl of Carrick depicted in Balliol Roll.Woodcock; Flower; Chalmers et al. (2014) p. 381; Grant (2013) p. 36, 36 n. 225; McAndrew (2006) pp. 55, 138; The Balliol Roll (n.d.). Aonghus √ìg‚Äîor at least a close relative‚Äîmay have played a part in the Scottish Crown's later campaigning against the Anglo-Irish in Ireland.Brown (2008) p. 153; Penman, MA (2014) p. 71; Brown (2004) p. 265. In 1315, Robert I's younger brother, Edward Bruce, Earl of Carrick, launched an invasion of Ireland and claimed the high-kingship of Ireland. For three years, the Scots and their Irish allies campaigned on the island against the Anglo- Irish and their allies.Duncan (2010); Young; Stead (2010) pp. 144, 146‚Äì147; Brown (2008) pp. 143‚Äì153; Duffy (2005); Brown (2004) pp. 264‚Äì265; Frame (1998) pp. 71‚Äì98; Lydon (1992) pp. 3‚Äì5. Although every other pitched-battle between the Scots and the Anglo-Irish resulted in a Scottish victory,Lydon (1992) p. 3. the utter catastrophe at the Battle of Faughart cost Edward his life and brought an end to the Bruce regime in Ireland.Duncan (2010); Duffy (2005). According to the sixteenth-century Annals of Loch C√©, a certain \\"'\\" and a \\"'\\" were slain in the onslaught.Hill (2014) pp. 219‚Äì220; Annals of Loch C√© (2008) ¬ß 1318.7; Annals of Loch C√© (2005) ¬ß 1318.7; Barrow (2005) p. 488 n. 104; Caldwell, DH (2004) p. 72; McDonald (1997) p. 191. This source is mirrored by several other Irish annals including the fifteenth - to sixteenth-century Annals of Connacht,Penman, MA (2014) p. 71; Ann√°la Connacht (2011a) ¬ß 1318.8; Ann√°la Connacht (2011b) ¬ß 1318.8; McLeod (2002) p. 31; Campbell of Airds (2000) p. 77; Davies (2000) p. 175 n. 14; Duffy (1998) p. 79; Dundalk (n.d.); Mac Domhnaill, King of Argyll (n.d.); The Annals of Connacht, p. 253 (n.d.). the seventeenth-century Annals of the Four Masters,Annals of the Four Masters (2013a) ¬ß 1318.5; Annals of the Four Masters (2013b) ¬ß 1318.5; McLeod (2002) p. 31; Duffy (1998) pp. 79, 102. the fifteenth- to sixteenth-century Annals of Ulster,Penman, MA (2014) p. 71; Annala Uladh (2005) ¬ß 1315.5; Barrow (2005) pp. 466 n. 15, 488 n. 104; Boardman, SI (2004); Sellar (2000) p. 217 n. 155; Annala Uladh (2003) ¬ß 1315.5; McLeod (2002) p. 31; Roberts (1999) p. 181; Bannerman (1998) p. 25; Duffy (1998) p. 79; Lydon (1992) p. 5; Lamont (1981) p. 166; Steer; Bannerman; Collins (1977) p. 203; Duncan; Brown (1956‚Äì1957) p. 205 n. 9; Dundalk (n.d.); Mac Ruaidhri, King of the Hebrides (n.d.); AU, 1315 (n.d.). and the seventeenth-century Annals of Clonmacnoise.Barrow (2005) p. 488 n. 104; McLeod (2002) p. 31, 31 n. 24; Murphy (1896) p. 281. The precise identities of these men are unknown for certain, although they could well have been the heads of Clann Ruaidhr√≠ and Clann Domhnaill.Duffy (2002b) pp. 61, 194 n. 64; McQueen (2002) p. 287 n. 18; Duffy (1991) p. 312; Steer; Bannerman; Collins (1977) p. 203. Whilst the slain member of Clann Ruaidhr√≠ seems to have been Ruaidhr√≠,Hill (2014) p. 219; Daniels (2013) p. 94; Boardman, S (2006) pp. 45‚Äì46; Barrow (2005) p. 488 n. 104; Brown (2004) p. 265; Boardman, SI (2004); Caldwell, DH (2004) p. 72; Duffy (2002b) pp. 61, 194 n. 64; Roberts (1999) pp. 144, 181; Steer; Bannerman; Collins (1977) p. 203. the identity of the Clann Domhnaill dynast is much less certain. He could have been Alasdair √ìg (if this man was not the one who had been killed in 1299),Penman, MA (2014) pp. 65 n. 7, 70‚Äì71; Duffy (2002b) p. 194 n. 64; Duffy (1991) p. 312, 312 n. 52. or perhaps a son of Alasdair √ìg.Cameron (2014) p. 153; Penman, MA (2014) p. 71. Another possibility is that he was Aonghus √ìg himself, or perhaps a son of his.Penman, MA (2014) p. 71; McNamee (2012a) ch. genealogical tables tab. 6; Barrow (2005) p. 466 n. 15; Roberts (1999) p. 181; Duffy (1991) p. 312 n. 52; McDonald (1997) pp. 186‚Äì187; Steer; Bannerman; Collins (1977) p. 203. An after-effect of the continued support of Clann Domhnaill and Clann Ruaidhr√≠ to the Bruce cause was the destruction of their regional rivals like Clann Dubhghaill.Brown; Boardman (2005) pp. 73‚Äì74; Munro, RW; Munro, J (2004). In fact, the albeit exaggerated title \\"King of Argyll\\" accorded to the slain Clann Domhnaill dynast in many of these annal-entries exemplifies the catastrophic effect that the rise of the Bruce regime had on its opponents like Clann Dubhghaill.McNamee (2012a) ch. 8; McNamee (2012b) ch. 5 ¬∂ 63; Campbell of Airds (2000) p. 77; Duffy (1993) p. 207. By the mid-part of the century, Clann Domhnaill, under the leadership of Aonghus √ìg's succeeding son, was undoubtedly the most powerful branch of Clann Somhairle. Death and descendants Laing, D (1878) pl. 50; Sir David Lindsay's Armorial (n.d.). A son of Aonghus √ìg was the first member of Clann Domhnaill to bear the title Lord of the Isles. Aonghus √ìg seems to have died at some point after the Battle of Bannockburn‚Äînotwithstanding the Hebridean tradition preserved by the eighteenth-century Book of Clanranald and the Sleat History that dates his death to about 1300.McDonald (1997) p. 186; Macphail (1914) p. 17; Macbain; Kennedy (1894) pp. 158‚Äì159. According to the latter source, Aonghus √ìg was laid to rest on Iona.Argyll: An Inventory of the Monuments (1982) p. 250 ¬ß 12; Macphail (1914) p. 17. One possibility is that he died between 1314 and 1318.McNamee (2012a) ch. genealogical tables tab. 6; Munro, RW; Munro, J (2004); Roberts (1999) p. 181; McDonald (1997) p. 186; Steer; Bannerman; Collins (1977) p. 203. This could well have been the case if the slain Clann Domhnaill chieftain at Faughart was indeed his son and successor.McDonald (1997) p. 186; Steer; Bannerman; Collins (1977) p. 203. On the other hand, it is not impossible that Aonghus √ìg lived as late as about 1330, after which the Clann Domhnaill lordship seems to have taken up by his son, E√≥in Mac Domhnaill.Daniels (2013) p. 25. The political situation in the Hebrides is murky between this man's accession and the disaster at Faughart,McDonald (1997) pp. 187‚Äì188. and it is possible that an after-effect of this defeat was a period of Clann Ruaidhr√≠ dominance in the region.McDonald (1997) p. 188; Steer; Bannerman; Collins (1977) p. 203. In 1325, a certain \\"'\\", Ruaidhr√≠ of Islay, suffered the forfeiture of his possessions by Robert I.Penman, M (2014) pp. 259‚Äì260, 391 n. 166; Penman, MA (2014) pp. 74‚Äì75, 74‚Äì75 n. 42; Petre, JS (2014) p. 272; Barrow (2005) p. 389; Brown (2004) p. 267 n. 18; McQueen (2002) p. 287; Murray (2002) p. 224; Roberts (1999) p. 181; McDonald (1997) p. 187; Steer; Bannerman; Collins (1977) p. 203, 203 n. 12; Duncan; Brown (1956‚Äì1957) p. 205 n. 9; Thomson, JM (1912) p. 557 ¬ß 699; The Acts of the Parliaments of Scotland (1844) p. 483; RPS, A1325/2 (n.d.a); RPS, A1325/2 (n.d.b).

If Ruaidhr√≠ of Islay was indeed a member of Clann Domhnaill, and a son of Alasdair √ìg, his expulsion may have marked the downfall of Alasdair √ìg's descendants‚ÄîClann Alasdair‚Äîand may account for the fact that this branch of Clann Domhnaill failed to hold power in Hebrides after this date. As such, Ruaidhr√≠ of Islay's expulsion could well mark the date upon which Clann Alasdair relocated overseas.Petre, JS (2014) pp. 272‚Äì273; Murray (2002) p. 224;. The eclipse of Alasdair √ìg's line‚Äîthe senior branch of Clann Domhnaill‚Äîmay explain the rise of Aonghus √ìg's line. If Ruaidhr√≠ of Islay indeed represented the line of Alasdair √ìg, his forfeiture evidently paved the way for the rise of E√≥in Mac Domhnaill.Petre, JS (2014) pp. 272‚Äì273; Murray (2002) p. 224. In fact, before the end of Robert I's reign, this son of Aonghus √ìg appears to have administered Islay on behalf of the Scottish Crown,Murray (2002) p. 225; Munro; Munro (1986) p. 286. and eventually came to be the firstOram (2014) p. 3; Petre, JS (2014) p. 272; Stevenson, K (2014) p. 73; Caldwell, D (2008) pp. 49‚Äì50; Munro, RW; Munro, J (2004).

If Aonghus √ìg was still alive in 1325, he would have witnessed Robert I's apparent show of force into Argyll within the same year. Although Aonghus √ìg's tenure as chief is remarkable in regard to his close support of the Bruce cause, the later career of E√≥in Mac Domhnaill saw a conspicuous cooling of relations with the Bruce regime‚Äîa distancing which may well have contributed to the latter's adoption of the title \\"Lord of the Isles\\".Penman, M (2014) p. 261. A grave-slab sometimes thought to be that of Aonghus √ìg, but may be that of a later like-named man.McDonald (1997) p. 187; Argyll: An Inventory of the Monuments (1982) p. 224 ¬ß 150; Steer; Bannerman; Collins (1977) p. 110; McKean (1906) p. 33; MacDonald; MacDonald (1896) pp. 102‚Äì103.

According to the Sleat History, √Åine N√≠ Chath√°in's tocher consisted of one hundred and forty men from each surname that dwelt in the territory of her father, C√∫ Maighe na nGall √ì Cath√°in.Kingston (2004) p. 47, 47 nn. 89‚Äì90; MacGregor (2000) pp. 15‚Äì16; Bannerman (1986) p. 10; Steer; Bannerman; Collins (1977) p. 203, 203 n. 3; Macphail (1914) p. 20. The Book of Clanranald numbers the men at eighty.McLeod (2005) p. 43; Kingston (2004) p. 47, 47 nn. 89‚Äì90; MacGregor (2000) pp. 15‚Äì16; √ì Mainn√≠n (1999) p. 28 n. 95; Steer; Bannerman; Collins (1977) p. 203, 203 n. 3; Macbain; Kennedy (1894) pp. 158‚Äì159. The U√≠ Cath√°in of Ciannachta were a major branch of the U√≠ N√©ill kindred,Kingston (2004) p. 47, 47 n. 89. and the ' or \\"train of followers\\" that is said to have accompanied √Åine N√≠ Chath√°in is the most remarkable retinue to have arrived through a marriage from Ireland in Scottish tradition.Sellar (1990). In any case, this tocher appears similar to an historical one dating almost a century earlier, when a Clann Ruaidhr√≠ bride brought over one hundred and sixty warriors to her Irish husband.Sellar (2000) p. 206. The tradition of the Clann Domhnaill‚ÄìU√≠ Cath√°in union is corroborated by the record of an English safe-conduct instrument granted to √Åine N√≠ Chath√°in, identified as the mother of E√≥in Mac Domhnaill in 1338.Kingston (2004) p. 47 n. 90; MacGregor (2000) p. 15; Bannerman (1986) p. 10; Steer; Bannerman; Collins (1977) p. 203; Rotuli Scoti√¶' (1814) p. 534. At a later date, √Åine N√≠ Chath√°in appears to have remarried a member of Clann Aodha Buidhe,Brown (2004) p. 272 n. 27; Kingston (2004) p. 47 n. 90. a branch of the √ì N√©ill kindred.Byrne (2008) p. 18; Brown (2004) p. 272 n. 27. Aonghus √ìg and √Åine N√≠ Chath√°in were the parents of E√≥in Mac Domhnaill.Daniels (2013) p. 90; Brown (2004) p. 272 n. 27. Another child of the couple may be the √Åine Nic Domhnaill noted in the Clann Lachlainn pedigree preserved by the fifteenth- century manuscript National Library of Scotland Advocates' 72.1.1 (MS 1467). This source reveals that this woman was the wife Lachlann √ìg Mac Lachlainn, and mother of his son, E√≥in Mac Lachlainn.Munro; Munro (1986) p. 282 n. 7; Sellar (1971) p. 31; Black; Black (n.d.). Whatever the case, a certain daughter of Aonghus √ìg was M√°ire, a woman who married William III, Earl of Ross.Caldwell, D (2008) pp. 52‚Äì53; Munro, R; Munro, J (2008); Munro, RW; Munro, J (2004); Munro (1986) pp. xxxiii, 60 fig. 5.1, 62; Munro (1981) p. 27; Cokayne; White (1949) p. 146; Bliss (1897) p. 85.

Although the parentage of Alasdair of the Isles is uncertain, one possibility is that he was another son of Aonghus √ìg.Penman, M (2014) p. 102; Penman, MA (2014) pp. 67‚Äì68; Boardman, S (2006) p. 45; Murray (2002) p. 224; McDonald (1997) p. 184; Duffy (1991) p. 312 n. 52; Lamont (1981) pp. 168‚Äì169; Steer; Bannerman; Collins (1977) p. 203. Domhnall of Islay could have also been his son.Penman, M (2014) p. 358 n. 67; Penman, MA (2014) p. 68 n. 18; McDonald (1997) pp. 187‚Äì188. According to the seventeenth-century Macintosh History, an ancestor of Clann Mhic an T√≥isigh named Fearchar married a daughter of Aonghus √ìg named \\"'\\". As Fearchar died in 1274, it suggests this source has confused Aonghus √ìg and Aonghus M√≥r.Cathcart (2006) p. 14, 14 n. 32; Clark (1900) p. 164. According to the Sleat History, an illegitimate daughter of Aonghus M√≥r was the mother of an early chiefly ancestor of Clann Mhic an T√≥isigh. The father of this ancestor is stated to have fled to Aonghus M√≥r whilst on the run for committing manslaughter. Having fathered a son with Aonghus M√≥r's daughter, the man is stated to have campaigned with Edward Bruce in Ireland where he was slain.

Virginia (1967). Their life and marriage has been the subject of several songs and three movies, including the 2016 film Loving. The Lovings were an interracial married couple who were criminally charged under a Virginia statute banning such marriages. With the help of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), they filed suit to overturn the law. In 1967, the Supreme Court ruled in their favor, striking down the Virginia statute and all state anti-miscegenation laws as unconstitutional violations of the Fourteenth Amendment.Loving v. Virginia Beginning in 2013, the case was cited as precedent in U.S. federal court decisions holding restrictions on same-sex marriage in the United States unconstitutional, including in the 2015 Supreme Court decision Obergefell v. Hodges.  Early life and marriage  Mildred Jeter was the daughter of Musial (Byrd) Jeter and Theoliver Jeter. She was born and raised in the town of Central Point in Caroline County, Virginia. She was known as a quiet and humble woman. Mildred identified herself as Indian-Rappahannock, but was also reported as being of Cherokee, Portuguese, and African American ancestry. During the trial, it seemed clear that she identified herself as black, especially as far as her lawyer was concerned. However, upon her arrest, the police report identifies her as \\"Indian\\". A possible contributing factor is that it was seen at the time of her arrest as advantageous to be \\"anything but black\\". There was an ingrained history in the state of the denial of African ancestry. Additionally, the frequent racial mixing in their community could have contributed to this fluid racial identity. Overall though she is often referred to as a mix of Native American and African American. Richard Loving was the son of Lola (Allen) Loving and Twillie Loving. He was also born and raised in Central Point, where he was a construction worker. He was white and his grandfather, T. P. Farmer, fought for the Confederacy in the Civil War. The ancestor Lewis Loving was marked in the 1830 census as owning seven slaves. Caroline County adhered to strict Jim Crow segregation laws, but Central Point had been a visible mixed-race community since the 19th century. Richard's father worked for one of the wealthiest black men in the county for 25 years. Richard's closest companions were black, including those he drag- raced with and Mildred's older brothers. \\"There's just a few people that live in this community,\\" Richard said. \\"A few white and a few colored. And as I grew up, and as they grew up, we all helped one another. It was all, as I say, mixed together to start with and just kept goin' that way.\\" The couple met when Mildred was 11 and Richard was 17. He was a family friend, and years later they began dating. When Mildred was 18 she became pregnant and Richard moved into the Jeter household. They decided to marry in June 1958 and traveled to Washington, D.C. to do so. At the time, interracial marriage was banned in Virginia by the Racial Integrity Act of 1924. Mildred later stated that when they married, she did not realize their marriage was illegal in Virginia but she later believed her husband had known it. After their marriage, the Lovings' returned home to Central Point. They were arrested at night by the county sheriff who had received an anonymous tip, and charged with \\"cohabiting as man and wife, against the peace and dignity of the Commonwealth.\\" They pled guilty and were convicted by the Caroline County Circuit Court on January 6, 1959. They were sentenced to one year in prison, suspended for 25 years on the condition that they leave the state. They moved to the District of Columbia. In 1964, frustrated by their inability to travel together to visit their families in Virginia, and by social isolation and financial difficulties in Washington, they filed suit to vacate the judgment against them and allow them to return home.  Supreme Court case  In 1964, Mildred Loving wrote in protest to Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy. Kennedy referred her to the American Civil Liberties Union. The ACLU filed a motion on the Lovings' behalf to vacate the judgment and set aside the sentence, on the grounds that the statutes violated the Fourteenth Amendment. This began a series of lawsuits which ultimately reached the United States Supreme Court. On October 28, 1964, when their motion still had not been decided, the Lovings began a class action suit in United States district court. On January 22, 1965, the district court allowed the Lovings to present their constitutional claims to the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals. Virginia Supreme Court Justice Harry L. Carrico (later Chief Justice) wrote the court's opinion upholding the constitutionality of the anti-miscegenation statutes and affirmed the criminal convictions. The Lovings and ACLU appealed the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court. The Lovings did not attend the oral arguments in Washington, but their lawyer, Bernard S. Cohen, conveyed a message from Richard Loving to the court: \\"[T]ell the Court I love my wife, and it is just unfair that I can't live with her in Virginia.\\" Also quoted in The case, Loving v. Virginia, was decided unanimously in the Lovings' favor on June 12, 1967. The Court overturned their convictions, dismissing Virginia's argument that the law was not discriminatory because it applied equally to and provided identical penalties for both white and black persons. The Supreme Court ruled that the anti-miscegenation statute violated both the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Lovings returned to Virginia after the Supreme Court decision.  Later life and Writing  The Lovings had three children: Donald, Peggy, and Sidney Loving. After the Supreme Court case was resolved in 1967, the couple moved back to Central Point, where Richard built them a house. Mildred said she considered her marriage and the court decision to be God's work. She supported everyone's right to marry whomever he or she wished. In 1965, while the case was pending, she told the Washington Evening Star, \\"We loved each other and got married. We are not marrying the state. The law should allow a person to marry anyone he wants.\\" On June 12, 2007, Mildred issued a statement on the 40th anniversary of the Loving v. Virginia Supreme Court decision. Her statement concluded: Deaths On June 29, 1975, a drunk driver struck the Lovings's car in Caroline County, Virginia. Richard was killed in the accident, at age 41; Mildred lost her right eye. Mildred died of pneumonia on May 2, 2008, in Milford, Virginia, at age 68. Her daughter, Peggy Fortune, said, \\"I want [people] to remember her as being strong and brave, yet humble‚Äîand believ[ing] in love.\\" The final sentence in Mildred Loving's obituary in the New York Times notes her statement to commemorate the 40th anniversary of Loving v. Virginia: \\"A modest homemaker, Loving never thought she had done anything extraordinary. 'It wasn't my doing,' Loving told the Associated Press in a rare interview [in 2007]. 'It was God's work.'\\" Legacy * Mr. & Mrs. Loving (1996), a film starring Lela Rochon, Timothy Hutton and Ruby Dee, written and directed by Richard Friedenberg. It aired on the Showtime network.

Before being designated Secondary State Highway 1G (SSH 1G) in 1937, the current roadway that is now SR 538 was a county road through farmland for 26 years. SSH 1G traveled between (PSH 1), also known as US 99, and until 1964, when the current designation of SR 538 was created. US 99 was bypassed by I-5 after 1966 and became Riverside Drive. The roundabout at SR 9 was constructed in 2007 while the Riverside Drive intersection was widened in 2009. Route description State Route 538 (SR 538) begins at the (I-5) interchange in northern Mount Vernon located south of the Skagit River. The roadway, which handled a daily average of 27,000 motorists at the interchange in 2008, is named College Way and travels east through a commercial zone, passing Riverside Drive, the former route of (US 99), and crossing a set of rail tracks used by BNSF Railway. Transitioning from a commercial to residential area, the Mount Vernon campus of the Skagit Valley College, located on the north side of the highway, is passed and eventually SR 538 leaves Mount Vernon city limits. The road turns southeast and ends at a roundabout with within Mount Vernon's urban growth boundary. History Originating as a county road by 1911, SR 538 was designated Secondary State Highway 1G (SSH 1G) in 1937. SSH 1G ran from (PSH 1), co-signed as (US 99), to . During the 1964 highway renumbering, SR 538 was created to replace SSH 1G, PSH 1 and US 99 were replaced with (I-5) and replaced SSH 1A. I-5 was not built until after 1966 and the western terminus of SR 538 was still US 99. Between early June and late July 2007, the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) constructed a roundabout at the SR 9 and Schopf Lane intersection, the first in Skagit County. The new roundabout reduced the length of SR 538 by . In early 2009, between I-5 and 18th Street, WSDOT repaved the highway and expanded the Riverside Drive intersection. Cemex Pacific Holdings was awarded the contract for repaving the road on January 20 and construction began with the closure of the Riverside Drive intersection on 31 May. The closure, which was delayed from 3 May, lasted until June 4. Actual repaving happened in late June of that year. A city-led project to widen the section of College Way that passes under I-5 at the western terminus of SR 538 began construction in December 2018 and was completed in 2020. The street was expanded to six lanes, including dedicated left turn lanes and two through lanes that are separated from the rest of traffic by the columns of the underpass.

Most commonly, these are gin-based, although there are some varieties based on other spirits such as vodka. The base gin is flavoured with various herbs, spices, fruits, and botanicals as well as its strength reduced. Fruit cups are typically marketed for the summer months, served with fruit as a cocktail garnish to the drink and to improve the flavour; recommendations include apple, orange, strawberry, lemon, lime, cucumber, mint, and borage leaves. Varieties A selection of different bottled fruit cups Pimm's Fruit Cup Pimm's No. 1 is a gin-based drink invented by James Pimm, at 25% ABV. Pimm's numbers 2-6 were based on Scotch Whisky, Brandy, Rum, Rye whiskey, and Vodka, respectively. As of 2012, only Pimm's No. 1, Pimm's Winter Cup (a variant of No. 3), and Pimm's No. 6 (renamed simply Pimm's 'Vodka Cup') still survive. Plymouth Fruit Cup Launched in 2003 and produced by the makers of Plymouth Gin, it is one of the strongest fruit cups at 30% ABV, which Plymouth says gives it a fuller flavour. It is the result of the base of Plymouth Gin being mixed with fruit liqueurs, vermouths, aromatic bitters and citrus extracts.

His works were considered ardent displays of nationalism and philosophy in the period of the Bengal renaissance. His novel \\"Anguriya Binimoy\\" (1857) was the first historical novel written in Bengal. Whereas the Young Bengal movement was more concerned with the dynamics of social change, their younger contemporaries, a group, to which Bhudev Mukhopdahyay belonged, also came out from the same college with western education, and joined the quest for literary achievements.

In 1848, he joined Calcutta Madrasa as English teacher. In 1856, he was selected for the post of Principal of Hooghly Normal School through a competitive examination for which his former class-mate Michael Madhusudan Dutt was also a candidate.Sengupta, Subodh Chandra and Bose, Anjali (editors), 1976/1998, Sansad Bangali Charitabhidhan (Biographical dictionary) Vol I, , p. 380, Later career In 1862 he was appointed Assistant Inspector of Schools.

Recognizing his services, Mukhopadhyay was awarded the CIE (Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire) in 1877 by the British. In 1882 he was appointed as Director of Public Instruction and was also nominated to the Lt.-Governor's Council and the Education Commission later that year. Mukhopadhyay retired from public service in 1883. He was also involved with several educational journals including Shiksadarpan O Sangbadsar and the Education Gazette, which he edited. This involvement lasted from 1868 until his retirement. His sense of nationalism was so strong that the English principal of Presidency College once noted, \\"Bhudev with his CIE and 1500 a month is still anti-British.\\" Writings Mukhopadhyay was a renowned writer and thinker and combined nationalism with rationalism in his works. He strived to reform Hindu customs and family laws to synergize with modern times. He had an immense knowledge of Sanskrit, as evidenced by his numerous essays, and critiques of Sanskrit literature. He wrote several books for young people, historical novels and fused many different philosophies into characters he portrayed.

The AOS also published a scientific journal, Lindleyana: The Scientific Journal of the American Orchid Society from 1986 to 2002. The journal's title commemorated John Lindley the father of orchidology and \\"the first taxonomist on a world scale.\\" Lindleyana was hailed as the first real scientific journal when the first issue was published. It was called an excellent journal that \\"satisfies a long-felt need\\". With membership one receives a copy of the society's book Your First Orchid and the Orchid Source Directory. The book Ultimate Orchid was written by Thomas Sheenan in association with the AOS and the Smithsonian Institution. Paul H. Allen was a long time publication consultant for the AOS. Judging orchids The organization trains and credentials judges for orchid shows. To become an AOS Accredited Judge takes seven years of study and practice. There are 30 AOS judging centers throughout the United States. It also sanctions judging events and gives awards for outstanding examples of orchids. One such award is the Highly Commendable Certificate for orchid hybrids granting the designation HCC/AOS. The highest level award is the First Class Certificate (FCC/AOS). Plants submitted for judging must meet established cultural, botanical or horticultural criteria. The qualities judges assess include color vibrancy, splash petals, spots and different-colored lips. Other scoring criteria include flower form, color of flower, size of flower, substance and texture as well as stem and arrangement of blooms. The awards are a prestigious accomplishment for hobbyists and can result in higher prices for commercial growers. Certain awards can make a particular type of orchid extremely valuable meaning thousands of dollars in increased profit for the grower. Fuchs holds the record for most awards at over 800. History The American Orchid Society was formed in 1921 in Boston, Massachusetts at the Massachusetts Horticultural Society. At the first meeting a group of 35 men and one woman set goals of organizing orchid shows in various cities, establishing a plant register, and selecting a group of experienced growers to judge plants and recognize the ones with superior quality. The first president of the American Orchid Society was Albert Burrage. The image for the seal of the society and its Gold Medal of Achievement was designed that year by Blanche Ames. It features a Native American (modeled on the artist's son) looking at a branch of orchid blooms. The medal was first awarded to Blanche Ames and her husband Oakes Ames in 1924. The society had 18,000 members in 1976 and there were 250 affiliated local orchid societies. In 1981 the AOS offered a $50,000 prize for the creation of an artificial orchid hybrid. In July 1984 the AOS moved its headquarters and orchid collection from Harvard University to the property of Lewis C. and Varina Vaughn in West Palm Beach, Florida. It was located at 600 S. Olive Ave and was valued at $1 million. The City of West Palm Beach designated the orchid as its official flower and adopted the nickname \\"The Orchid City\\". The collection was accessible to the public until 1988, when Lewis Vaughn died and the estate came under city codes prohibiting operation of a business in the residential neighborhood. Vaughn willed his property to the society and a special use permit allowed the AOS to occupy the 6 acre (2.4 ha) estate. The permit was so restrictive visiting members could not even tour the grounds. The local neighborhood association opposed the operation of the facility and for the next 13 years the headquarters were not open to the public. The organization's website was launched in 1996. It is considered one of the best sources for information about orchids. The American Orchid Society was listed in \\"The Horticulture 100\\" a \\"list of the best American gardening books, horticultural societies, perennials, shrubs, and trees\\" by Horticulture magazine. From 2001 to 2012 the society operated the American Orchid Society Visitors Center and Botanical Garden at Morikami Park in Delray Beach, Florida contiguous with the Morikami Museum and Japanese Gardens. New location Facing financial struggles due to decreasing membership and donations and losses in its investments the AOS partnered with the Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden and moved its facilities to the Fairchild campus in Coral Gables, Florida. Membership in 2001 was 29,000 in 2011 it was 10,000. With a $500,000 shortfall in its $2.5 million budget a decision was made to close the gardens, but supporters and local orchid societies raised funds to keep the gardens open and volunteers arranged to care for the plants. Society treasurer said, \\"When we moved to our home in Delray Beach, we thought it was our destiny. It wasn‚Äôt long before we found out we were not the best overseers of a public garden or that we should be in the retail business... We lost sight of the main thing ‚Äî our members, conservation, education and research.\\" To commemorate its 95th anniversary in 2016 the AOS recreated a series of orchid advertising images from the 1940s. In 2017 the Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden and the American Orchid Society presented an exhibit of historic and contemporary art inspired by orchids, \\"Orchids Through the Artists' Eyes\\". Awards and medals Flower quality awards The AOS grants three levels of awards for flower quality based on a 100 point scale. *Highly Commended Certificate (HCC/AOS) - 75 to 79 points *Award of Merit (AM/AOS) - 80 to 89 points *First Class Certificate (FCC/AOS) - 90 to 100 points Other awards for plants *Judges Commendation (JC) - possessing distinctive characteristics but cannot be scored customarily *Award of Distinction (AD) - for a worthy new direction in breeding *Award of Quality (AQ) - one in a group of at least twelve that are an improvement over former type *Certificate of Botanical Recognition (CBR) - a rare and unusual species with educational value (must pass taxonomic verification) *Certificate of Horticultural Merit (CHM) - possessing characteristics that contribute to the horticulture of orchids Awards for exhibitors *Certificate of Cultural Merit (CCM) - robust well flowered specimen in care of exhibitor for at least 12 months prior, score of 80 to 89 points *Certificate of Cultural Excellence (CCE) - robust well flowered specimen in care of exhibitor for at least 12 months prior, score of 90 to 100 points Annual awards Medals The AOS also issues medals and awards for service to the society, work in orchid culture and the research of orchids. *Gold Medal of Achievement - highest recognition for distinguished contributions *Silver Medal of Achievement - for a single project (prior to 1972 this was a plant or exhibit award) *Achievement Award - for contributions to any aspect of orchidology including philanthropy and public relations *Certificate of Meritorious Achievement in Orchid Education *The Thomas Sheehan Award for Outstanding Service by an AOS Volunteer *Ambassador Award - for lifelong service to the organization *President's Award *AOS Fellow - elected by the Board of Trustees *AOS Award for Excellence in Hybridizing *Distinguished Affiliated Societies Service Award  Images  File:Orchid on display at American Orchid Society, Delray Beach.jpg Phalaenopsis File:Extremely rare orchid at American Orchid Society.JPG Non-orchid companion plant File:Purple orchids at Am Orchid Society, Delray Bch.JPGVandaceous orchid File:Orchids at American Orchid Society, Delray Beach.JPGVandaceous orchid  References  Notes Citations Further reading   External links   The Orchid Photo Page a large gallery of orchid photos by Greg Allikas with many AOS award photos Category:Horticultural organizations based in the United States Category:Orchid organizations Category:Nonprofit hobbyist organizations based in the United States Category:1921 establishments in Massachusetts Category:Organizations established in 1921 Category:Botany in North America ","title":"American Orchid Society"},{"id":"11740600","text":"Robert Hale) The Sixth Wife is a 1953 historical novel by noted novelist Jean Plaidy. It recounts the tale of Catherine Parr, the sixth wife of Henry VIII, King of England. The novel covers the life of Catherine as Queen, and her fearful feeling of being replaced in the King's eyes. Though the novel conveys Catherine's life, several other characters' lives are foreshadowed as well. Catherine's family play a key role including her sister Anne Parr Herbert, her stepdaughter Elizabeth, niece Jane Grey, doomed friend Anne Askew, rivals Thomas Wriothesley, Stephen Gardiner, Henry Howard, Anne Stanhope, Mary Howard Fitzroy the Dowager Duchess of Richmond and former romantic interest Thomas Seymour. The novel unfolds over a period of five years, recounting Catherine's rise as Queen Consort to her death as Dowager Queen. Historical inaccuracies Though the novel is a work of fiction, it contains minor historical inaccuracies regarding the Six Wives of Henry VIII. It states that Anne Boleyn suffered four miscarriages during her marriage to the King yet there were three that were historically confirmed. Also Henry, while reflecting upon his wives, recalls that he married Jane Seymour quickly because she was pregnant and she lost the child shortly after the wedding, something which is entirely fictional. Catherine Howard is also recalled to have lost a child. There is only small historical evidence to suggest that Catherine may have become pregnant during her short term as Queen, but she may have suffered a false pregnancy before beginning her menstrual cycle and not having a miscarriage as stated in the novel.

In 2015, the school was rated \\"Met Standard\\" by the Texas Education Agency. thumbnail  History  Once part of Rylie, this unincorporated land was annexed to Dallas in the late '50s and developed into a community most noted for its high school, H. Grady Spruce, which opened in 1963. Spruce replaced Rylie High School (which was turned into a junior high school and later a middle school in 1972). The school is named for Henry Grady Spruce, a native of Omen, Texas, who earned degrees from Southern Methodist University and the University of Chicago. He devoted much of his 35-year YMCA career to youth, including 25 years as director of the Dallas YMCA's Camp Crockett (now Camp Grady Spruce) near Granbury and the Park Cities YMCA. When it opened, Spruce's student body reflected the community and was predominately Caucasian (white and with some black students and other ethnic groups). Beginning in 1973, Spruce was selected to take part in busing. Black students became a majority in the early 1980s as the demographics of the Pleasant Grove area changed. Starting in the 1990s, Hispanics became the majority. From 1963‚Äì1998, the mascot of Spruce High School was the \\"Mighty Fighting Apaches\\". In 1998, the \\"Apache\\" mascot was changed to the Timberwolves. On June 26, 2008, the Dallas ISD board voted to move all 10th and 11th graders from Spruce High School and released all staff from their contracts. As a result, Spruce disbanded all athletic teams during the 2008‚Äì2009 school year; thus, seniors who participated in athletics were eligible to transfer to other DISD schools.

The object of prisons originally, both among the Hebrews and the Romans, was merely the safe-keeping of a criminal, real or pretended, until his trial. The ecclesiastical idea of imprisonment, however, is that confinement be made use of both as a punishment and as affording an opportunity for reformation and reflection. Clerical punishment This method of punishment was anciently applied even to clerics. Thus, Boniface VIII (cap. \\"Quamvis\\", iii, \\"De poen.\\", in 6) decrees: The Church adopted the extreme punishment of perpetual imprisonment because, by the canons, the execution of offenders, whether clerical or lay, could not be ordered by ecclesiastical judges. It was quite common in ancient times to imprison in monasteries, for the purpose of doing penance, those clerics who had been convicted of grave crimes (c. vii, dist. 50). The \\"Corpus Juris\\", however, says (c. \\"Super His\\", viii, \\"De poen.\\") that incarceration does not of itself inflict the stigma of infamy on a cleric, as is evident from a papal pronouncement on the complaint of a cleric who had been committed to prison because he vacillated in giving testimony. The reply recorded is that imprisonment does not ipso facto carry with it any note of infamy. Monastic prisons As to monastic prisons for members of religious orders, we find them recorded in decrees dealing with the incorrigibility of those who have lost the spirit of their vocation. Thus, by command of Urban VIII, the Congregation of the Council (21 September 1624) decreed: The crimes in question must be such as by natural or civil law would merit the punishment of death or imprisonment for life (Reiffenstuel, \\"Jus Can. univ.\\", no. 228). Innocent XII reduced the year required by the above-mentioned decree to six months (Decree \\"Instantibus\\", 2). A decree of the Sacred Congregation of the Council (13 November 1632) declares that a religious is not to be judged incorrigible because he flees from imprisonment, unless, after being punished three times, he should make a fourth escape. As the civil laws do not, at present, permit of incarceration by private authority, the Congregation on the Discipline of Regulars has decreed (22 January 1886) that trials for incorrigibility, preceding dismissal, should be carried out by summary, not formal, process, and that for each case recourse should be had to Rome. A vestige of the monastic imprisonment (which, of course, nowadays depends only on moral force) is found in the decree of Leo XIII (4 November 1892), in which he declares that religious who have been ordained and wish to leave their order cannot, under pain of perpetual suspension, depart from the cloister (exire ex clausura) until they have been adopted by a bishop.

The building was obtained by the university in a lease-purchase agreement in 1984 and reverted to the full university ownership ten years later. Today, Bellefield Hall is a facility that is home to a variety of University offices and services. For the University's Department of Music, it houses rehearsal spaces, classrooms, graduate student offices, and the William R. Robinson Digital Recording Studio. A recently renovated 676-seat auditorium holds many of the Department of Music's recitals and concerts. Bellefield Hall also houses a sports gym, fitness center, and indoor swimming pool. The second floor fitness center was renovated and expanded in 2005. A classroom specifically designed for African-drumming music was constructed in 2008.Kimberly K. Barlow & Peter Hart, What's New?

Events Bellefield Hall has hosted a number of notable events throughout its history, including concerts by the aforementioned musicians. In addition, on April 3, 2008, Republican Presidential candidate Congressman Ron Paul was invited to speak at the University of Pittsburgh. He was the first 2008 presidential candidate to speak on Pitt campus (the second being Barack Obama) during the 2007-2008 academic year and the only Republican candidate to do so.

Biography Mary FitzRoy (formerly Lady Mary Howard) was the second daughter of Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk: a member of the ambitious Howard Family. At the time of her birth, her father was the second- most senior noble in the English peerage; her maternal grandfather Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham, the most senior. After Buckingham's execution in 1521, her father was one of only two dukes in the Kingdom, (the other being Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk). This changed in 1525, when Henry VIII elevated Henry FitzRoy, his six-year-old illegitimate son by Elizabeth Blount, to the Dukedom of Richmond and Somerset. When in 1529 Thomas Wolsey, who was charged with FitzRoy's care, fell from grace the mantle passed to Thomas Howard. At the same time the idea arose, allegedly from either the King or Anne Boleyn, that FitzRoy should marry Howard's daughter. Four years later, in November 1533, negotiations were completed and Howard, now aged fourteen or fifteen, and FitzRoy, himself just fifteen, were married. Through her father, she was first cousin to both Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard, as well as second cousin to Jane Seymour. Henry FitzRoy, Duke of Richmond The match was a triumph for the Boleyn family as the Duchess was a former member of Queen Anne's household, and a staunch advocate of reform. It was also a very advantageous match for the Duchess as with no legitimate male heir to the throne, the Duke was seen at the time as a likely future king. However, the marriage was not to last as FitzRoy died of consumption within three years. He had barely turned seventeen. Fearful that too much sexual activity had hastened his elder brother Arthur's death, the King had ordered the couple not to consummate their marriage. As a result, the Duchess was not allowed to keep many of the lands which would normally have been her entitlement as widow: the King insisted without the consummation, it was not a true marriage. She remained at court, closely associated with the King's niece, Margaret Douglas, and one of his mistresses, Mary Shelton. Together they were the main contributors to the Devonshire Manuscript, a collection of poetry from themselves and court poets. The duchess is thought to be the owner or holder of the manuscript; it is not known how much she contributed, however she is thought to have copied in one of her brother's poems \\"O Happy Dames.\\" In 1539, Douglas and the Duchess were appointed to meet Anne of Cleves at Calais.Nichols, John Gough, ed., The Chronicle of Calais, Camden Society (1846), 170 When Catherine Howard fell from grace, the Duchess and her entire family were arrested and briefly imprisoned in the Tower of London. In both 1538 and 1546 her father petitioned for her to be married to Thomas Seymour. The King gave his approval for the match, but her brother, Henry, Earl of Surrey, objected strongly, as did the Duchess herself; and the marriage did not take place. Surrey then suggested that the Duchess should seduce the aged King, her father-in-law, and become his mistress, to \\"wield as much influence on him as Madame d'Etampes doth about the French King\\". The Duchess, outraged, said she would \\"cut her own throat\\" rather than \\"consent to such villainy\\". She and her brother fell out, and she later laid testimony against Surrey that helped lead to his trial and execution for treason. The Duchess never remarried and her presence at court dwindled not long after Henry VIII died in January 1547. She, knowing how merciless her family was about power, and perhaps not wanting to be involved in another scandal, possibly chose to stay out of their plans in order to live a quiet life. She died in late 1557, during the reign of her half-sister-in-law, Queen Mary I. Further reading * Beverley A.

Sessions Fictional portrayals Though the Duchess has not been portrayed in any film or television program thus far, she has appeared in many books of noted historical fiction, most notably The Secrets of the Tudor Court by Darcey Bonnette which features Mary as the main character, and The Sixth Wife, in which she is a rival of Catherine Parr, and is used by her brother Surrey to try to become a \\"seventh wife\\" of the King despite her protests. As in history's account, her character mainly falls into the background toward the end of the novel after the king has died. She is also featured in Queen's Gambit, a novel about Catherine Parr and is featured as one of Catherine's rivals. Mary was also the main character and story- teller in Brazen by Katherine Longshore, and was mentioned by her cousin Catherine Howard in Gilt, also by Longshore.

Status and operation Canonical erection is the approval of the proper ecclesiastical authority which gives the organization a legal existence. Archconfraternities do not erect confraternities; they merely aggregate them. It ordinarily belongs to the bishop of the diocese to erect confraternities.Donnelly, Francis. \\"Archconfraternity.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 1. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 30 Dec. 2014 In the case, however, of many confraternities and archconfraternities, the power of erection is vested in the heads of certain religious orders. Sometimes the privileges of these heads of orders are imparted to bishops. The vicar-general may not erect confraternities unless he has been expressly delegated for the purpose by his bishop. Aggregation, or affiliation, as it is also called, may be made by those only who have received from the Holy See express powers for that purpose. They must make use of a prescribed formula. In the same church only one confraternity of the same name and purpose may be aggregated. The consent of the bishop must be given in writing. In the case of religious orders aggregating their own confraternities in their own churches, the consent of the bishop given for the erection of the house or church of the order is sufficient. The bishop must approve, but may modify the practices and regulations of the confraternity to be aggregated, except those to which the indulgences have been expressly attached. Only those indulgences are imparted by aggregation which have been conceded with that provision. Only the general process of conducting the aggregation is given. If it pertains to the bishop to erect the confraternity, then the pastor of a church or the superior of a religious house petitions him for canonical erection,. If the erection pertains to the head of a religious order, then the bishop's consent to the aggregation is required. Examples Examples of archconfraternities include the following. * Archconfraternity of the Holy Family * Archconfraternity of the Most Precious Blood * Archconfraternity of the Misericordia * Archconfraternity of St. Stephen * Archconfraternity of Holy Agony * Archconfraternity of the Gonfalone * Archconfraternity of the Holy FaceHoly Face * Confraternity of the Rosary * Sodality of the Blessed Virgin * Archconfraternity of the Divine Child Jesus * Archconfraternity of Our Lady of Consolation * Archconfraternity of the Cord of Saint Francis * Archconfraternity of the Cord of Saint Joseph * Confraternity of Christian Doctrine * Bona Mors Confraternity * Archconfraternity of the Scapular of St. Michael * Archconfraternity of Christian Mothers Notes Further reading * B√©ringer, Franz.

W. Pabst and starring Leni Riefenstahl, Gustav Diessl, Ernst Petersen, and World War I flying ace Ernst Udet. Written by Arnold Fanck and Ladislaus Vajda, the film is about a man who loses his wife in an avalanche while climbing the Piz Pal√º mountain, and spends the next few years searching the mountain alone for her body. Four years later he meets a young couple who agree to accompany him on his next climb. The White Hell of Pitz Palu was filmed on location in the Bernina Range in Graub√ºnden, Switzerland. The 1929 theatrical release starred Kurt Gerron, who was Jewish, as a night club guest. The film was edited to remove scenes featuring Gerron, and it was rereleased as a 90-minute German-language sound film in 1935. It was remade in 1950. Plot Dr. Johannes Krafft (Gustav Diessl) and his bride Maria are spending their honeymoon mountain climbing in the Bernina Alps in southeast Switzerland. While climbing the north face of Piz Pal√º in the strong f√∂hn winds, the loving couple's guide Christian (Christian Klucker) warns Krafft not to be cocky in this dangerous environment, but the doctor dismisses the warning. Just then a violent avalanche descends on the couple, the safety rope breaks, and Maria is swept down into a deep crevice in the Piz Pal√º glacier. Despite his wife's initial cries for help, Krafft is unable to reach her in her icy grave. Krafft spends the next years wandering the mountain alone like a ghost, looking for the body of his lost bride. Four years later, a young couple‚ÄîMaria Maioni (Leni Riefenstahl) and her fianc√© Hans Brandt (Ernst Petersen)‚Äîarrive at the Diavolezza-H√ºtte (2977 m) preparing to climb Piz Pal√º. Recently engaged and very much in love, the couple settle in to their remote mountain hut. Their friend, Udet, piloting a biplane, uses a small parachute to deliver a bottle of champagne to the couple. While paging through the Diavolezza-H√ºtte log, Maria notices an entry for 6 October 1925 written by Dr. Johannes Krafft. The entry notes that Maria Krafft died by accident in the Piz Pal√º glacier. Just then, Krafft arrives at the mountain hut on one of his solitary excursions. Maria offers the lonely man tea, and soon the three become acquainted. The local guide, Christian, arrives and mentions that a group of students from Z√ºrich will be arriving the next day to climb the north face. Disturbed by the news, Krafft prepares to set out once again on his own. After Christian tells Maria that Krafft tried climbing the north face twice and failed because he was alone, she asks Hans if they should let him make the climb alone. The next morning, as Krafft prepares to leave, Hans approaches and offers to accompany the doctor, who accepts. Later when Maria discovers that Hans left with Krafft for the north face, she skis after the men, catches up with them, and insists that they take her along. Despite the memory of his wife's terrible fate on the mountain, Krafft reluctantly agrees. Together they set off across the pristine snow for the Piz Pal√º north face. As they ascend the icy mountain, a slightly jealous Hans (the three had innocently shared a bed the night before) insists on taking the lead. While traversing a difficult stretch, he is swept away by an avalanche. Krafft climbs down and rescues the injured Hans, moving him to a precarious ledge near an avalanche shute. Maria bandages Hans' injured scalp, and the three consider their predicament‚Äîtrapped on the narrow ledge with no means of escape. Moreover, while rescuing Hans, Dr. Krafft broke one of his legs, which he then splints up. Despite Krafft's desperate calls for help, there is no one near enough to rescue them. They find a small ice cave which provides some shelter during the night for Maria and Hans, while Krafft stands outside with his lantern signaling for help, his ice pick used as a crutch. Meanwhile, Christian returns to the hut and discovers Hans' log entry. Concerned for their safety in the coming storm, the mountain guide sets off after them, but soon is turned back by the blizzard conditions. He returns to the valley and enlists the help of his fellow villagers. Soon a rescue team snakes its way up the mountain with pitch torches and stretchers. They make their way through the night, illuminated by the magical light of the torches. The next day they reach the summit and attempt to rope down to the stranded party, but they are unsuccessful. Later that night, the three can barely survive the freezing cold and wind. Delirious with fever, Hans tries to jump to his death. When Krafft moves to prevent him, Hans attempts to kill the doctor, who is not as strong with only one working leg. Krafft is saved when Maria ties up her crazed fianc√©. The next morning, after learning of the stranded party, Ernst Udet the aviator takes off in his aircraft in search of Krafft, Maria, and Hans. When he locates them, he makes several unsuccessful attempts to parachute supplies down to them. Before leaving, he manages to show Christian their exact location on the mountain. With no help in sight, however, Krafft takes off his jacket and wraps it around Hans to prevent the young man from freezing to death. Krafft then crawls away to an isolated ice ledge and waits to die. Christian finally rappels down to them and discovers a note Krafft left for him indicating that he did his best to save the two young people. He asks his old friend to leave him where he is‚Äîthat he was always \\"good friends with the ice\\". During his attempt to bring Maria and Hans back to safety, an avalanche nearly kills them. Later they arrive back at the village, where Maria and Hans are nursed back to health by having snow rubbed over their bare skin. When Maria awakens from the trauma, she learns that Krafft perished in the ice, on the same mountain that once took his wife. Cast Production The film was shot from January to June 1929 in the Bernina Range in the Alps. Work was divided between the two directors. Arnold Fanck was responsible for the location shots in the mountains, G. W. Pabst was responsible for the indoor shots and was advising Fanck in matters of dramaturgy. The set design was by Ern≈ë Metzner, the cinematography by Fanck's long-time collaborators Sepp Allgeier, Richard Angst and Hans Schneeberger. Fanck would continue to work with actors Leni Riefenstahl and Ernst Udet in the films Storm over Mont Blanc (1930) and S.O.S. Eisberg (1933). Distribution Piz Pal√º as seen from Diavolezza On 11 October 1929 the film premiered in Vienna. In Germany the film had its premiere in the same year on 1 November in Stuttgart. The official German premiere was on 15 November 1929 in Berlin. In the first four weeks the film was seen by more than 100,000 people at the UFA Palast in Berlin, at this time Germany's largest and most important movie theater. In 1930 a sound film version in English was released internationally. In 1935 a German sound film version with a film score by Giuseppe Becce was produced. The film was shortened to 90 minutes. With the Nazis in power since 1933, all nightclub scenes with the Jewish actor Kurt Gerron, who was murdered in Auschwitz concentration camp in 1944, were cut from this release. A remake was produced in 1950 under the title F√∂hn by Rolf Hansen, starring Hans Albers and Liselotte Pulver. The original version of Die wei√üe H√∂lle vom Piz Pal√º was lost until 1996. The film was restored in 1997 by the German Federal Film Archive. According to a prologue for the restored version, it was made from an extant nitrate print, as opposed to a negative print which is considered to be lost. The original film score by Willy Schmidt-Gentner is still lost. Critical response The White Hell of Piz Palu was well received, both critically and commercially. The film premiered in Vienna and Hamburg to critical praise. At the film's opening in Berlin's Ufa Palast am Zoo on 15 November 1929, the film became the second-highest box-office hit of the year in Germany. The film was equally well received at its United States premier at New York's Roxy Theater in September 1930. In his review for The New York Times, Mordaunt Hall praised the film for its \\"beautifully photographed sequences\\". Hall concluded: Author and film critic Leonard Maltin awarded the film three and a half out of four stars, praising the film's cinematography, and direction. The film is considered Fanck's most successful film and Riefenstahl's best acting performance. It also became the second biggest box office hit of the year in Germany. The film's poster is shown in the 2009 Quentin Tarantino film, Inglourious Basterds, as Shoshanna (Melanie Laurent) is taking down the marquee lettering from her theatre, and the film is later being referenced in the Tavern-Rendezvous scene.

Cartoon. AKA Cartoon Network was a slot in the Cartoon Network UK weekday evening schedule from 1999 to 2000, between 7 and 9pm on weekday evenings. The slot consisted of repeated shows such as Space Ghost Coast to Coast, Tom and Jerry, Looney Tunes and Cow and Chicken. In addition, the slot included an original show called Cult Toons, broadcast only on Friday evenings. 'AKA' Stings and Cult Toons material would consist of Hanna-Barbera owned footage, prominently from the 1960s and 1970s (such as Wacky Races, The Perils of Penelope Pitstop, The Banana Splits (including Arabian Knights and Danger Island), Hong Kong Phooey, Help!... It's the Hair Bear Bunch!, Harlem Globetrotters). More contemporary material included Cow and Chicken and Dexter's Laboratory.  Cult Toons  Cult Toons (also referred to by Exceeda as 'AKA Cult Toons') was a series of 30-minute slot experimental alternate comedy VJ (video jockey) videos, directed by Xavier Perkins and Brett Foraker. The inclusion of seemingly irrelevant and obscure clips from films and cartoons gave the show a very surreal and non sequitur quality. For example, common features of the re-edited cartoons would include repeated footage (when a character would say \\"You can say that again\\" the previous line would often be repeated), freezing the footage (usually after a line such as \\"Hold everything!\\" or \\"Stop!\\"), overdubbing voices (including randomly replacing lines with the theme music to The Godzilla Power Hour), and repeating a line or sound effect and adding drum beats and record scratches over it, turning it into a brief hip-hop song. The start of an episode of The Gary Coleman Show would often feature halfway through the show, edited so that lead character Andy LeBeau would suddenly explode a few seconds in. It would then end abruptly over a 'Technical Difficulties' caption, with a dramatic music sting. Another example, suddenly cutting to a clip of a martial arts film if a character got angry. In addition, in an episode featuring the Super Furry Animals, the opening titles of Help!... It's the Hair Bear Bunch! were edited so that all mentions of \\"bears\\" were replaced with themselves saying \\"furry animals\\". Prominent material however would be live-action films ranging from blaxploitation to Bruce Lee, as well as footage of celebrity interviews and turntable DJs created especially for the show. The show would also feature clips from interviews with a range of special guests and promoted talents, particularly in the second series. Some special guests on the show included Rio Ferdinand, Super Furry Animals, Cast, Kele Le Roc, London Towers, Keith Duffy, Catatonia, Gay Dad, 21st Century Girls, Rick Witter, Courduroy, WCW Nitro Girls, Regular Fries, The Jungle Brothers, Trev Sinclair, Reef, Zach Shaw, A and Waikiki. Tom Guest worked extensively on the show as a music producer. He later worked on a variety of products, including Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon commercials and idents in the early 2000s, a number of The Simpsons promotions for Channel 4, and background music for Pro Pinball:Big Race USA and MTV Base.Tom Guest's personal portfolio, 2010 At the start of each episode, the featured cartoon and special guest would be announced by \\"MC Jacket Potato\\" (or Jackie P. for short), who was depicted by an edited likeness of Dexter from Dexter's Laboratory, made to appear with a dark skintone, a yellow outfit, and an afro haircut. The end credits of each episode would reveal the programme's UK origin by sampling a clip of Velma Dinkley from an episode of Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! saying \\"Made only in England!\\", interrupted after each word by record scratches and clips.

He was involved in experimental research, particularly of acute pancreatitis, plastic surgery, head and neck oncology, the intestinal tract, and the treatment of leukaemia with x-rays.  Early life and education  Senn was born in Sevelen, Switzerland and emigrated to the United States with his family in 1852 when he was eight years old, settling in Ashford, Wisconsin. He graduated from the Chicago Medical College in 1868.  Career  259x259pxSenn spent the first few years after graduating as practitioner and resident physician at the Cook County Hospital in Chicago, later becoming attending physician in a Milwaukee hospital. cancerous tumors authored by Senn In 1877, he left for the University of Munich for postgraduate study, graduating in 1878 with a second M.D. In 1878, he joined the faculty of Rush Medical College in Chicago as Professor of Surgery. In 1884, he was appointed as Professor of Surgery at the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Chicago. Around 1886, Senn successfully tested the diagnosis of gastrointestinal perforation by inflation with hydrogen gas. Senn used a rubber balloon connected to a rubber tube inserted in his anus to pump of hydrogen gas into his intestinal tract. An assistant sealed the tube by squeezing the anus against it. The hydrogen was inserted by squeezing the balloon while monitoring the pressure on a manometer. Senn had previously carried out this experiment on dogs to the point of rupturing the intestine.James E. Pilcher, \\"Senn on the diagnosis of gastro-intestinal perforation by the rectal insuffation of hydrogen\\", Annals of Surgery, vol. 8, iss. 3, pp. 190‚Äì204, September 1888.

It is technically not a number but rather an alphanumeric identifier consisting of 7 characters, with three letters and four numbers. It is often referred to as the NHI, although care must be taken when using this abbreviated term, because the NHI can also refer to the national collection of health care user demographic data (of which the NHI Number is the unique identifier). The NHI Number, as part of the NHI was established in 1993.New Zealand Health Information Service. National Health Index (NHI). Retrieved 13 June 2007. Usage Primarily the NHI is used to identify individuals uniquely within the New Zealand health system,New Zealand Health Information ServiceNHI Number. Retrieved 13 June 2007. especially in electronic systems. An example of this is its use to alert health care providers using the Medical Warnings System (MWS) of risks associated with medical decision-making for specific patients. Format An NHI number has a specific format. It is 7 characters in length and contains a check digit. This format consists of 3 alphabetic characters being in the range of A-Z, excluding I and O, and 4 numeric characters being in the range 0-9. The 4th numeric character is the check digit. The assignment of the first 6 characters is arbitrary and bears no relationship to the individual to whom it is assigned. The NHI Number is most often represented with the alphabetic characters upper case. NHI Numbers are often referred to as being valid or invalid. Any NHI Number that does not fit the correct format or that has an incorrect check digit is referred to as invalid. Usually reference to an NHI Number being valid or not does not indicate that it is correctly associated with the right individual. As the identifier is arbitrary there is no way to do this based solely on the identifier itself. By 2025 the NHI system will have exhausted all of the NHI numbers that are available. In 2019 a revised standard introduced a new format of 3 alphabetic characters being in the range of A-Z, excluding I and O, 2 numeric characters being in the range 0-9, one alphabetic character in the range of A-Z, excluding I and O followed by a check alphabetic character in the range of A-Z, excluding I and O. The new format will be available for allocation July 2022. The two formats will co- exist indefinitely, and all administrative and clinical systems will need to support them both. All NHI numbers starting with Z are reserved for test purposes. Duplicates When it has been identified that an individual has been assigned more than one NHI Number, one is deemed to be the primary identifier. This is usually done by ranking all assigned numbers in alpha- numeric order and choosing the first one as the primary. All other NHI Numbers for the individual within the NHI are then linked to the primary one. Check digit There are two variants of the check digit algorithm to allow for the current NHI number format having a numeric check digit while the new format has an alphabetic check character. For the new format, each alphabetic character is given a numeric value equal to its ordinal position within a version of the alphabet that omits the letters I and O. The ordinal range is 1‚Äì24. This gives A=1 and Z=24, for example. Each numeric character is used with its face value 0‚Äì9 in the calculation. Each character‚Äôs equivalent numeric value is then multiplied by its reverse ordinal position within the NHI number. The first value is multiplied by 7, the second by 6, the third by 5, the fourth by 4, the fifth by 3 and the sixth by 2. The sum of the six products is calculated. The calculated sum modulo 24 is subtracted from 24 to give an index number. If the index number is zero, then the NHI number is invalid and cannot be used. For the old format, the NHI Number contains a check digit. The algorithm for generating the digit is described below: Each alpha character is given a numeric representation equivalent to its ordinal position within the alphabet, starting at A through to Z. The letters I and O are omitted making the ordinal range 1 - 24. Each alpha character's numeric representation is multiplied by the inverse of its ordinal position within the NHI Number. The first value is multiplied by 7, the second by 6 and so on. The first 3 numeric characters are multiplied by the inverse of their ordinal position also. The sum of these multiplications modulus 11 subtracted from 11 is taken as the check digit (a result of 10 is translated to 0). This scheme is similar to the ISBN check digit scheme.

World War II Pacific Theatre operations Advent served on escort and patrol duty in the South and West Pacific throughout World War II. From 2 May until 8 October 1943, she operated out of Noumea, New Caledonia, on convoy screening duty. Her ports of call included Espiritu Santo; Sydney, Australia; Tongatapu; Efate, New Hebrides; and Guadalcanal. The ship changed her base of operations to Guadalcanal in mid-October 1943. She made numerous runs to Espiritu Santo; the Treasury Islands; Noumea; Efate; Bougainville, Solomon Islands; Sydney; and Ulithi. On 1 June 1944, the name Advent was dropped, and the ship was designated as submarine chaser USS PC-1587. Between late August and mid-October 1944, PC-1587 was based at Espiritu Santo. The highlight of her service during this period was her rescue on 11 October of the crew of a downed PBY aircraft. During November, the patrol craft operated from Guadalcanal; and, on 4 December, she shifted to Ulithi. By April 1945, PC-1587 had completed five convoy runs to Kossol Roads, Palau Islands, and one to Guam.  Return to Stateside  In April, PC-1587 assumed patrol duty at Saipan. The ship also escorted convoys to Iwo Jima, the Bonin Islands, Guam, and Tinian. On 17 October, she set a course for the California coast, sailing via Eniwetok and Pearl Harbor. She dropped anchor in San Francisco Bay on 13 November 1945.  Post-war deactivation  Preparations for her deactivation were begun soon after reaching the west coast, and PC-1587 was decommissioned on 22 January 1946. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 25 February 1946, and she was transferred to the Maritime Commission on 18 March 1948 for disposal.

This station received its original construction permit from the Federal Communications Commission on December 4, 1990. The new station was assigned the call letters WLNE-FM by the FCC on December 21, 1990. WLNE-FM received its license to cover from the FCC on February 1, 1991. From its origins in the early 1990s, the station was created and owned by Al Stroh and the now-defunct Montgomery Broadcast Properties. This frequency began as WLNE- FM (\\"We're Light N Easy\\") with beautiful music and standards in 1991. Later, 96.1 moved towards Lite AC as \\"Lite FM 96\\". In March 1995, the station switched to the popular \\"Arrow\\" (All Rock and Roll Oldies) format and changed the calls to WRWO. The station dropped oldies in 1997 and became known as \\"Kiss 96\\" with an urban contemporary format. The station debuted another new format in late 1998, this time all 1980s music with the slogan \\"The 80's Channel, Kiss 96.1\\". In June 1999, the call letters officially changed to WQKS-FM to match the \\"Kiss\\" branding. WQKS-FM made yet another format tweak in early 2000 into \\"Rockin' hits of the 80's, 90's and 70's\\" with the slogan \\"Alice 96.1\\".

Biography With the Second World War nearing its end, Br√ºsewitz joined the Wehrmacht in 1944 as a fifteen-year-old, was captured by the Red Army and became a prisoner of war. He worked as a shoemaker after the war and converted to christianity in 1954 under the influence of his family then attended a Lutheran seminary from 1964 until 1969 in Erfurt. In 1970 he was ordained in the Evangelical Lutheran Church at Rippicha in the district of Zeitz. He was critical of the East German Communist regime imposed by the Soviet Union after the war and symbolic acts of protest, including the installation of a cross of neon lamps at his church, brought him to the attention of the authorities. The leadership of his church sided with the state, rather than its priest, and asked, in 1976, for Br√ºsewitz to be moved to another rectorate. This was the immediate trigger for his suicidal protest in a public market in front of the church in Zeitz. The fire was quickly doused by officials from the Ministry for State security, but Br√ºsewitz died four days later from his burns. On the day of his protest he carried pamphlets accusing the communists of repression which read; \\"Funkspruch an alle: Die Kirche in der DDR klagt den Kommunismus an! Wegen Unterdr√ºckung in Schulen an Kindern und Jugendlichen\\" (\\"A Radio message to everyone: The church in the GDR accuses communism! Because of the suppression of children at school\\"). In his suicide note he wrote of a \\"feigned deep peace, which had also intruded Christianity\\" in East Germany while in truth there was \\"a mighty war between light and darkness\\"(\\"zwischen Licht und Finsternis ein m√§chtiger Krieg\\"). Br√ºsewitz died of his severe burns on August 22, 1976 in a hospital in Halle D√∂lau. His self-sacrifice brought support from both his parishioners and figures in the church and led to a reappraisal within the church hierarchy of its relationship with the Communist dictatorship. The Protestant Church now sees Br√ºsewitz's protest as an early step towards the mass popular protests which led to the collapse of East Germany in 1989. The Communist authorities initially attempted to suppress news of the event then, when news leaked and public support for his action grew, they branded him a psychopath. On August 31 Neues Deutschland, the official newspaper of the ruling Socialist Unity Party (SED), printed an article entitled \\"Du sollst nicht falsch Zeugnis reden\\" \\"You shall not bear false witness\\" which asserted that self-immolation was the action of a sick, crazy man. A similar article appeared in Neue Zeit, the newspaper of the East German Christian Democratic Union. The Protestant church of the ecclesiastical province of Saxony commemorated his sacrifice twenty years later in 1996, six years after the reunification of Germany. Bishop Dehmke called his death an \\"act of desperation\\" in protest against the repressive nature of the communist regime and the collaboration of church members who had grown too close to the state. To mark the 30th anniversary of his death, Neues Deutschland wrote an apology for the article they had carried at the time, admitting that the piece had been \\"slanderous\\" and written, not by journalists, but in one of the many offices of the central committee of the SED. In addition they published some of the thousands of critical letters to the editor they had received but not printed in 1976.Warum dieser Hass? Reaktionen auf einen Artikel im ND. Neues Deutschland vom 12. August 2006, S. 24 In the Federal Republic of Germany, the Paneuropa-Union established a Br√ºsewitz-Center to document the repression of opposition within the former East Germany.

It runs east‚Äìwest for near the Canadian border, connecting SR 539 near Lynden to Everson and a junction with SR 9 in Nooksack. The Lynden‚ÄìEverson highway was built in the 1880s as a wagon road, with onward connections to Nooksack via a ferry over the Nooksack River that was later replaced with a bridge. It was paved by the Whatcom County government in the 1930s and incorporated into the state highway system in 1951 as a branch of Secondary State Highway 1A. During the 1964 state highway renumbering, the branch became SR 544\\\\. The Nooksack River bridge between Everson and Nooksack was replaced in 1994 after a major flood damaged the old structure. Route description Main Street (SR 544) in Everson SR 544 begins at a roundabout with SR 539 (the Guide Meridian) on the south side of Wiser Lake near Lynden. The highway travels east on Pole Road through farmland and passes a housing subdivision near the Raspberry Ridge Golf Course. SR 544 continues due east along Fourmile Creek and turns north at a junction with Everson Goshen Road near several gravel pits and the Nooksack Indian Reservation. After passing several industrial businesses, the highway turns northeast to enter Everson and turns north onto Mead Avenue near the city's elementary school. SR 544 then turns east once again at Kale Street and continues northeast onto Everson Road as it crosses the Nooksack River alongside a section of the Bay to Baker Trail. The highway travels east through downtown Everson on Main Street, passing several businesses, the city hall, and a branch of the Whatcom County Library System. SR 544 continues across a small patch of farmland to neighboring Nooksack, where it becomes Columbia Street and runs for several blocks on the southern outskirts of the town. SR 544 terminates at a junction with SR 9, which uses a block Columbia Street to cross over the BNSF Railway's Sumas Subdivision before continuing north towards Sumas and south towards Sedro-Woolley. SR 544 is maintained by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT), which conducts an annual survey on state highways to measure traffic volume in terms of average annual daily traffic. Average traffic volumes on the highway in 2016 ranged from a minimum of 6,700 vehicles at the SR 539 roundabout to a maximum of 9,800 vehicles on the Nooksack River Bridge. The entire length of SR 544 is also served by Whatcom Transportation Authority bus route 71X, which connects Bellingham to Everson, Nooksack, and Sumas. History The route from Bellingham to Everson was originally part of the Whatcom Trail, used by the indigenous Nooksack people and later prospectors during the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush in the 1850s and 1860s. The Bellingham and Northern Railway was later built in the 1880s along the route from Bellingham to Everson and Sumas and included a crossing of the Nooksack River west of Everson. The Everson bridge was later joined by a road bridge that was constructed a decade later to replace a ferry on a major wagon road. The east‚Äìwest road connecting Everson and Nooksack to the Guide Meridian was paved in the early 1930s by the county government. The Everson road was designated as a branch of Secondary State Highway 1A (SSH 1A) by the state legislature in 1951. SR 544 was created during the 1964 renumbering to replace the Everson branch, while the rest of SSH 1A became SR 9. After suffering damage during a major flood in November 1990, the original truss bridge over the Nooksack River was replaced with a longer span, which opened in 1994. The entire highway was repaved by WSDOT in summer 2005, requiring the three-month closure of sections near Everson. The project cost $2.6 million to complete and was delayed by the discovery of gasoline-contaminated soil under Everson's Main Street.

They share similar features, such as 5 floors (16 apartments per floor at 255 and 20 at 248). The apartments range in size from 400 to 2500 square feet (various units between the first and second floors of both buildings are duplexes). Approximately 400 tenants live in the two buildings. The building used to have a reputation for hosting raucous all-night \\"loft parties.\\" Given this, and the preponderance of twenty-something recent college graduates living in the two buildings, the buildings had at one point been given the nickname \\"Art Dorm.\\" With aging young-professional residents and extensive construction underway at both buildings, this reputation is changing. History The building was constructed in 1936City of New York, Office of the President of the Borough of Brooklyn, Department of Buildings, Certificate of Occupancy, October 6, 1936 and served as a factory space manufacturing various textiles and garments including a pioneer in light fixture manufacturingArtcraft Fluorescent Lighting Corporation until 1998, when it was converted into residential lofts. On July 4, 2005, at approximately 11 AM, at 255 McKibbin Street, apartment number 222 (304 in the new numbering) exploded, causing major structural, smoke, and water damage to surrounding units. The explosion is thought to have been caused by the combustion of wood sealant vapor. Apartment 222 had recently been vacated, and was being refurbished by the building's management; the wood floor had been coated with sealant, and left unattended to saturate. When sealant vapor reached the pilot light of the unit's stove (which had not been turned off), it exploded. The windows and metal window frames in 222 were ripped out of the building's brick walls. On July 19, 2011, FBI agents raided 255 McKibbin Apt 510 looking for members of vigilante group Anonymous. Former residents from rock band Broken Glow were mentioned in a New York Post article as possible suspects, though no further action was taken against the musicians.  Owners and Management  255 McKibbin is owned by Bamboo Hills Corporation. Bamboo Hills and Zupup / Zumck Realty are owned by Moshe Shmuel Zupnick, a prominent leader of the Satmar Hasidic community. 255 is managed by Matty Stuhl. 248 is managed by Carnegie Management. Notable spaces Until late 2012, 255 was home to LEGroom, a loft event space. Currently, The Chocolate Factory theater and visual art organization throws biweekly events.New York City Board of Standards and Appeals, agenda item 234-04-BZ234-04-BZ Cafe at 248 McKibbin Potion Cafe was in the middle of 248 McKibbin. Open 6 days a week (closed on Wednesdays), the cafe had a wide variety of food and beverages. On Mondays, there was an open-microphone night attended by many local singer-songwriters, hip hop artists, poets, with performers from all over the world appearing. Potion Cafe has recently reopened and the collective is hosted regularly by \\"The G\\" until its closure, but the core members have continued to host the open mic at The Tea Factory Lofts and the cafe is now open 7 days a week (175 Stockholm Street). The progressive-rock band of the same name resides in upstate New York. the unit previously holding the Potion Cafe has been undergoing construction. In February 2013, a sign was posted advertising another business, two4eight, will take over the spot. two4eight is operating a bakery and coffee shop in the location 7 days a week. In early 2014 two4eight has closed. The owners of Lit Lounge will be opening a cafe / bar as well as an event space. The cafe is slated to open March 16th. On March 16, 2014, Currant Cafe was opened. Loft law only the 4th and 5th floors of 255 Mckibbin have a certificate of occupancy valid for residential occupancy. The remaining floors have been submitted for inclusion in the 2010 Loft Law. This process was initiated by the building management. In February 2012 most residents of the 1st (technical basement) 2nd and third floors of 255 Mckibbin received copies of the Narrative Statement outlined in the Loft Law. On July 9, 2012 the Loft Board revoked registration for units 101, 102, 103, 109 and 110 due to those units being located in the basement. In media *Several scenes from the Spirit Award nominated film Quiet City were shot at 255 McKibbin, during the fall of 2006. *In 2005, writing/director/actor John Cameron Mitchell flyered the buildings in hopes of shooting a critical scene of his Shortbus film at the lofts in which two characters spot each other from across an alley or street. A more appropriate location in two Williamsburg, Brooklyn lofts was eventually chosen. *An article on the front page of The New York Times on May 7, 2008 described the 248 and 255 McKibbin buildings and their free-wheeling atmosphere extensively. *248 Mckibbin's Apt 1G or known from 2004-2010 as \\"the G\\" was featured on Fox Japan where one of the residents was in a documentary.

Originally a , Blake developed into a utility player and played first grade matches in all the backline positions, as well as at and lock. He represented New South Wales on one occasion. Blake has held coaching positions with the Wallabies, Western Force, Manly RUFC and Leicester Tigers. Early life Blake was born in London, England, but moved to Sydney with his family at an early age. While attending Christian Brothers College in Manly, Blake played for the Australian Schoolboys team in 1981. Phil Blake is the younger brother of former Manly, Canberra and South Sydney player Michael Blake. Playing career Manly Blake made his d√©but for the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles in Round 12 of the 1982 season, coming off the bench for the Sea Eagles in their 20-19 win over Eastern Suburbs at Brookvale Oval. Blake played 14 games in his rookie year, playing five-eighth, centre and halfback. He scored 9 tries in 1982, and was a try scorer for Manly in their 21-8 loss to defending premiers Parramatta in the 1982 Grand Final. Blake won the Dally M Rookie of the Year award. Blake's good form continued in 1983, cementing his position as the club's first choice halfback. He broke the Sea Eagles club record for the most tries scored in a season with 27 the top try scorer in the league. Blake's 27 tries were scored from just 23 games played and as of the end of the 2018 season, this is still the Manly club record for most tries in a premiership season. Manly won through to the 1983 Grand Final, again against Parramatta, and for the second time in two seasons. After playing 21 of his 23 games at halfback in 1983, he played there only 10 times in 1984, spending most of his time at centre as Fulton tried to cover his defensive lapses. This also allowed Fulton to play others (such as halfback Des Hasler who had joined the club from Penrith) in their preferred positions. After scoring 27 tries in 23 games in 1983, Blake scored only 11 tries from 23 games in 1984. Blake broke his arm during the opening round of the 1985 season against Penrith. He returned to the field in Round 9 against Canberra, but was again used in various backline positions and only scored 3 tries in 11 games. During the 1985/86 off-season Phil Blake traveled to England and played for Warrington, he played left-, i.e. number 4, (replaced by interchange/substitute Mark Forster) in Warrington's 8-34 defeat by Wigan in the 1985 Lancashire County Cup Final during the 1985‚Äì86 season at Knowsley Road, St. Helens, on Sunday 13 October 1985, In the 1986 NSWRL season, Blake was again the league's top try scorer with 13, sharing the mark with Balmain's Great Britain international import Garry Schofield and despite having that statistic, for the second time in a Kangaroo Tour year, he was overlooked for selection on the 1986 Kangaroo tour. However, after four seasons under Fulton, he was unwanted by Manly and following the season signed to play for the South Sydney Rabbitohs from 1987. Souths Blake joined Rabbitohs and went on to play four seasons for the club. Returning to his schoolboy position of , Blake was instrumental in Souths winning the minor premiership in 1989. He returned to England to play for Wigan for the 1988/89 season. After returning from England, Blake, and Souths went from being minor premiers in 1989 to finishing with the wooden spoon in 1990, the biggest slide from grace in the competition's history. Nomad After three seasons at Souths, Blake joined the North Sydney Bears for 1991, however despite the Bears reaching the finals for the first time since 1982, he only played eleven games for the club and moved again at the end of the year, joining the Canberra Raiders. Blake moved again at the end of the 1992 season, joining the St. George Dragons. He came off the reserves bench for the Dragons in the 1993 Grand Final who lost their second Grand Final in two seasons to the Brisbane Broncos. It was Blake's 3rd Grand Final loss in his 3rd attempt after having lost the 1982 and 1983 Grand Finals with Manly. In 1995 he joined the new Auckland Warriors franchise, and was in their inaugural run-on side. He played three seasons for the club, his longest spell at one club since the Rabbitohs. Phil Blake, who played in the Warrior's first game against the Broncos at Auckland's Mount Smart Stadium before 29,220 fans, scored the new club's first ever try in the game's 21st minute after a dash down the left wing by Whetu Taewa. Blake, as always there in support, had an easy 10m run to the line. Despite this the Warriors went down narrowly to the two time premiership winners 25-22. Representative career Despite narrowly missing out on a Kangaroos jersey in 1982 and again in 1986, Blake never established himself at representative level. In 1988, he played for City, and in 1989 he came off the bench in a State of Origin match for New South Wales, but that was the extent of his representative career. Along with Ian Roberts, he is to date one of two British-born players to play State of Origin. In 1988, Blake was selected at fullback for an Australian select side called the President's XIII to play the touring Great Britain Lions. On a wet and muddy day at the Seiffert Oval in Canberra, the President's XIII defeated the Lions 24‚Äì18.Presidents XIII vs Great Britain 1988 Retirement Blake trained with the Manly team at the start of the 1998 season before announcing his retirement.

It is located the junction of the Quesnel and Cariboo Rivers and is 60 km southeast of Quesnel and only 11 km northwest of Likely. History Quesnel Forks was founded in 1860 and was a major supply center for the Cariboo Gold Rush. Between 1860 and 1862 it catered to 2,000 or more transient miners annually and a resident population of approximately 100. When gold was discovered on Antler, Lightning and Williams Creek, on the north side of the Snowshoe Plateau, prospectors and packers continued to use the route via Quesnel Forks until a decent trail system was established via the Quesnel and the Cottonwood rivers. The Quesnel Forks Bridge (initially a toll bridge) provided the only access to the village and the mining regions of Keithley Creek and the Snowshoe Plateau until the 1920s. However, when the Cariboo Wagon Road was completed in 1865, Quesnel Forks was bypassed and Barkerville became the major center of gold mining activity. By the mid-1870s most of the population had left, but a small, stable group of Chinese miners and merchants remained in Quesnel Forks which supported a widely dispersed mining community. Many of these people came from the Four Counties region of Kwangtung Province, South China. Following completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway through Ashcroft in 1885 their population increased when discharged Chinese railroad labourers sought to make a living from gold mining. They were supported by a branch of the Chee Kung Tong Association who erected a two-storey building in the village. During that period the region contained the third largest group of Chinese residents after Victoria and Nanaimo. The CPR also facilitated a hydraulic mining boom in the Cariboo, delivering large mining equipment such as water canon and metal for pipes to Ashcroft. From there, ox teams and stage coaches transported equipment and mining speculators up the Cariboo Road to The Forks. The Bullion Pit mine nearby produced $1,233,936 (1900 dollar value) over eleven years and attracted large numbers of itinerant men who placed heavy demands on the resources of the village. The horse trail to the Cariboo Road was widened into a wagon road and the Quesnel Forks Bridge strengthened to accommodate heavy wagons in 1895. In that same year a new jail was built at the rear of the Government Agent's house (shown at the head of the bridge in the above photo which should be dated 1899) and the land around these buildings kept vacant in case of fire. The town was not abandoned until the 1950s. Modern day Today, visitors to Quesnel Forks can explore the restored pioneer buildings and historic cemetery. Historical research and work projects began in the 1990s under the leadership of the Likely Cemetery Society and teacher/historian David Falconer. The cemetery area was cleared and secured, graves identified with headboards, and the Chee Kung Tong house stabilized with the assistance of local residents. Thanks to people like Brian Giesbrecht and his crew who have been restoring the old buildings to save them from a slow death into the soil, and from the river which is slowly eating away at the banks of the ghost town (half the town has been swept into the river over the past 8 years). Television Quesnel Forks was featured on the historical television series Gold Trails and Ghost Towns, season 1, episode 8.

Born in Gloucester, Massachusetts,http://www.meredithfh.com/webcast/25810 he died on November 9, 2014 in Carbondale, Illinois while undergoing treatment for cancer.http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-siu-chancellor-dies- met-20141110-story.html He is author or co-author of more than 60 publications in peer-reviewed journals, as well as several textbooks, monographs, and technical reports. With more than 130 conference papers to his credit, his work has been presented nationwide in the United States, as well as in parts of Europe, where he has been a visiting professor at the University of Cologne (Germany) and lectured in Finland. Sarvela earned a bachelor's degree in psychology in 1981, a master's degree in educational psychology in 1983 and a doctorate in health education in 1984, all from the University of Michigan. He began his professional career as a program evaluator for Ford Aerospace and Communications Corporation (1984‚Äì86), primarily doing classified work for the National Security Agency. In 1986 he joined the faculty of SIUC‚Äôs highly regarded Department of Health Education, where he was widely regarded as the replacement for recently departed Robert S. Gold. Many saw him as being potentially a ‚Äúyoung Bob Gold‚Äù. He was promoted to the rank of associate professor in 1989 and to full professor in 1992. Collaborating with Elena Sliepcevich and David Duncan, his publications from the early 1980s largely focused on the study of risk taking and risk reduction related to alcohol and other drug use in youth. Many of the studies during this early stage of his career were conducted in rural settings, thus providing a catalyst for his later work in the SIU-C Center for Rural Health and Social Service Development. Throughout his career many of his publications have been concerned with instrument development, needs assessment, program evaluation, and the creation of responsive interventions and curricula. His research blended the rural setting; the multiple health-related problems of that setting; and the challenging issues of measurement and evaluation. During the 1996-1997 academic year, Dr Sarvela was an American Council on Education (ACE) Fellow at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. This experience afforded him an opportunity to enhance his skills in educational leadership, strategic planning, and systems operations. Aspects of this experience became two chapters (\\"Needs Assessment and Strategic Planning\\"; \\"Assessing Program Costs and Effects\\") in the book Health Education Evaluation and Measurement - A Practitioner's Perspective, 2nd edition, which he co-authored with Dr Robert J McDermott in 1999. This fellowship also contributed to his movement into administration first as Director of the Center for Rural Health and Social Service Development. He became chairman of the Department of Health Care Professions in 1999. In 2002, he was appointed to the position of Dean of the College of Applied Sciences and Arts. References * McDermott, R. J.

Rutledge's musical style is often compared to that of American alt-country singer Ryan Adams. His influences, both of the literary and music world, include Leonard Cohen, Hank Williams, Richard Brautigan and E. E. Cummings. In 2006, Justin Rutledge was named Toronto singer-songwriter of the year by NOW magazine. Rutledge has toured Canada, the UK, the United States and Europe, and has played shows with Kathleen Edwards, Jim Cuddy, Blue Rodeo, Hawksley Workman, Luke Doucet and Dolly Parton.\\"Justin Rutledge singing softly\\". Toronto Sun, October 5, 2006. His critically acclaimed lyrics are sometimes linked by music writers to his time as a university English major; he was editor-in-chief of a University of Toronto literary journal.  History   Early life  Rutledge was born and grew up in the Junction neighbourhood in Toronto, a working class community centered around an intersection of four railway lines. He was raised in an Irish-Catholic family and grew up with aspirations of becoming a writer. To that end he studied English literature, with a major in modern poetry, at the University of Toronto. He dropped out after three years of school as his musical career got in the way. Rutledge told Maclean's in an interview that his backup plan would be to finish his university studies in English \\"if this music thing doesn't work.\\"\\"One to watch: Justin Rutledge\\" . Maclean's, February 10, 2005.  No Never Alone (2004‚Äì2005) No Never Alone is Rutledge's first album. To pay for the recording he worked as a bartender. Rutledge has remarked that \\"I would often do a studio session during the day, and then head straight to work until 4 or 5 in the morning\\". The album earned Rutledge considerable praise, particularly in the UK, where he was compared to Ryan Adams by Comes With a Smile, who also proclaimed that \\"A major new talent has landed\\".Sheriff, Tom. Justin Rutledge Review. Comes With a Smile Vol. 14 Additional UK praise came from Uncut magazine, who referred to Rutledge as \\"a master of gothic understatement\\", and NME describing the album as \\"an incredible breakthrough\\". It was only receiving this attention in the UK that No Never Alone was released in Rutledge's native Canada. Justin Rutledge performing at Vancouver's St. James Community Square.  The Devil on a Bench in Stanley Park (2006‚Äì2007)  Rutledge's second album, The Devil on a Bench in Stanley Park was released through Six Shooter Records on October 6, 2006. Devil on a Bench is actually Rutledge's second attempt at a second album; he spent a year recording his first attempt, tentatively titled In the Fall, before he scrapped it. He was unsatisfied with the album, and has explained, \\"I thought a second album should have just a bit more of an assured sense about it. A second step forward should be a step up the ladder as opposed to just asserting your presence. You‚Äôre not just saying, ‚Äòhey, I‚Äôm still here. You‚Äôre saying, ‚Äòhey I‚Äôm here and I‚Äôve challenged myself and I‚Äôve hopefully done something that I haven't done already.‚Äô To challenge himself and create the album he wanted, Rutledge wrote a new batch of songs and recorded them in eight days with his band, opting for a more live recording style. The Devil on a Bench in Stanley Park was nominated for a Juno Award in the category \\"Roots & Traditional Album of the Year: Solo\\" and received the Galaxie Rising Star Award at the Edmonton Folk Music Festival.  Man Descending (2008)  Rutledge's third album, Man Descending was released on April 8, 2008, through Six Shooter Records. The album is named after a 1982 collection of short stories by Guy Vanderhaeghe, also called Man Descending. Rutledge was inspired by a line from Vanderhaeghe's book, \\"A man descending is propelled by inertia; the only initiative left him is whether or not he decides to enjoy the passing scene.\\" He says of the line, \\"It really resonated with me. As I continued to read the stories, I realized that all these characters in the book were dealing with the same kind of static or inertia in their lives. I kind of took little threads and wove them into songs.\\" The album features guest performances by Ron Sexsmith, Jenn Grant, Catherine MacLellan, Hawksley Workman, Melissa McClelland, Joey Wright and Jim Bryson. Man Descending was longlisted for the Polaris Music Prize. Other praise for Man Descending in 2008 included the No. 5 spot on Exclaim!'s Wood, Wires & Whiskey top 10 and a nomination for Contemporary Album of the Year at the Canadian Folk Music Awards. According to an interview, \\"Compared to 2006‚Äôs The Devil on a Bench in Stanley Park, Rutledge feels Man Descending is a much more patient, intimate and mature album, despite recording it in just three days.\\"\\"Justin Rutledge Ascends\\". Exclaim!, May 2008. The songs \\"Alberta Breeze\\" and \\"San Sebastian\\" were written for In the Fall, the album that Rutledge scrapped in 2006, and were rerecorded for Man Descending. In 2009 Rutledge took part in an interactive documentary series called City Sonic. The series, which featured 20 Toronto artists, had him reflecting on his time performing at the Cameron House.  The Early Widows (2010)  The Early Widows is Rutledge's fourth album, released May 4, 2010, on Six Shooter Records. Rutledge wrote several songs with a single character in mind from author Michael Ondaatje's novel Divisadero\\"Exclusive: Toronto Singer-Songwriter Justin Rutledge Teams Up with Michael Ondaatje for Upcoming Stage Production, Begins Work on Fourth Album\\".

The album was produced by Canadian singer-songwriter Hawksley Workman (also credited as a musician on the album) and also features Canadian singer-songwriter Oh Susanna and an additional co-writer credit to Nashville singer-songwriter Darrell Scott.  Valleyheart (2013)  Valleyheart is Rutledge's fifth album, released February 2013 on his new label Outside Music. It is produced by Justin Rutledge himself. Early Winters Rutledge is also a member of the band Early Winters, a collaboration with Canadian musician/producer Dan Burns, American musician Zac Rae and British singer-songwriter Carina Round.

Silver mining in the United States began on a major scale with the discovery of the Comstock Lode in Nevada in 1858. The industry suffered greatly from the demonetization of silver in 1873 by the Coinage Act of 1873, known pejoratively as the \\"Crime of 73\\", but silver mining continues today. United States mines produced 1,170 tons of silver in 2014, 17% of the silver it used. 63% of consumption was imported, from Mexico, Canada, Peru and Chile, and the remainder was derived from recycling. Three US mines had silver as their primary product, and 39 mines reported silver as a byproduct of gold and base metals production. Alaska was the country's leading silver-producing State, followed by Nevada and Idaho. Interest in silver mining increased in recent years because of an increased price for the metal: the average silver price increased from $4.39 per troy ounce for the year 2001, to $13.45 per troy ounce for 2007.\\"Mining review,\\" Mining Engineering, May 2007, p.37-47. In 2011, silver prices rose to almost $49 per troy ounce in April before dropping to around $34 per troy ounce in late June. In March 2016, the silver price was around $15 per troy ounce.https://www.bullionvault.com/gold-price- chart.do?modal=truehttp://www.bullionspotprice.com/silver retrieved 20110625 By state  Alaska  In 2015, Alaska was the nation's leading silver- producing state. Two Alaska mines were significant silver producers. The Greens Creek mine, owned by Hecla Mining, produced 8,452,153 troy ounces of silver. Teck Resources' Red Dog mine, the world's largest source of zinc, in 2014 produced 7.56 million troy ounces of silver as a byproduct of lead and zinc production. Arizona More than 80% of the state's silver was a byproduct of copper mining; other silver came as a byproduct of lead, zinc, and gold mining.Melissa Keane and A. E. Rogge (1992) Gold & Silver Mining in Arizona 1848-1945, Arizona State Historic Preservation Office, p.14. The most productive silver district in Arizona that was mined primarily for silver was Tombstone in Cochise County, discovered in 1877. In 2006, all the silver mined in Arizona came as a byproduct of copper mining. California Most of the silver produced in California has been a byproduct of mining other metals, such as copper (Copperopolis), tungsten (Pine Creek mine in Inyo County), or gold (Randsburg).H.K. Stager (1966) Silver, in Mineral Resources of California, California Division of Mines and Geology, Bulletin 191, p.381-385. However, there have been mines where silver was the principal product. Panamint City, California Silver mines at Panamint in Inyo County produced silver from 1873 until the town was destroyed by a flash flood in 1876.Robert M. Norris and Robert W. Webb (1990) Geology of California, New York: Wiley, p.212. The Cerro Gordo Mines in Inyo County started producing lead and silver in 1860. Ore bodies were replacements and fissure fillings in Paleozoic limestone. In the 20th century zinc became the principal product.Robert M. Norris and Robert W. Webb (1990) Geology of California, New York: Wiley, p.211. Silver was discovered at Calico in San Bernardino County in 1881, and mining was prosecuted strongly there until 1896.Robert M. Norris and Robert W. Webb (1990) Geology of California, New York: Wiley, p.248. Silver was discovered in 1919 in the eastern Rand district, near Randsburg and Johannesburg, in San Bernardino County. The Rand district had already been an established gold district. The Kelly Rand mine produced silver from miargyrite and pyrargyrite ores from 1919 to 1928.Robert M. Norris and Robert W. Webb (1990) Geology of California, New York: Wiley, p.246. Colorado Silver veins were first discovered in the Montezuma district of Summit County in 1864. Despite the early silver discoveries, Colorado's largest silver district, Leadville, was not discovered until 1874. The largest current source of silver in Colorado is as a byproduct of gold mining at the Cripple Creek & Victor mine, a large open-pit heap leach operation owned by AngloGold Ashanti at Victor, Colorado. In 2006, the mine produced 4.0 metric tons (130,000 ounces) of silver.. Burnell and others, Colorado, Mining Engineering, May 2007, p.76.> Idaho Lucky Friday mine, Coeur d‚ÄôAlene district. The Coeur d‚ÄôAlene (Silver Valley) district of Shoshone County in northern Idaho has produced more silver than any other mining district in the United States, and is historically one of the top three silver districts in the world in total silver produced. (It competes with Potosi in Bolivia and Pachuca-Real del Monte in Mexico for the title of greatest silver district, each having produced more than a billion troy ounces of silver.) Through 2006, the Coeur d‚ÄôAlene district has produced a total of more than 37,000 metric tons (1.2 billion ounces) of silver. Two silver mines are currently operating in the Coeur d‚ÄôAlene district: the Lucky Friday mine, the third largest in the US, owned by Hecla Mining Company; and the Galena mine, owned by Americas Silver Corporation. The Lucky Friday mine produced 3.0 million troy ounces of silver in 2015; the Galena mine produced approximately 1.54 million troy ounces of silver in 2015. Missouri Silver mining began in 1879 at the Einstein mine, nine miles northwest of Fredericktown in Madison County. The settlement of Silver Mine, complete with US Post Office was established to serve the miners of the Einstein, Ozark, and Apex mines. The mines closed within a few years, but reopened briefly in 1916 and again in 1927 to mine tungsten.Carl Tolman (1933) The geology of the Silver Mine area, in 57th Biennial Report, Appendix I, Missouri Bureau of Geology and Mines, p.5-34. Montana Butte, Montana is historically the second-greatest source of silver in the United States, second only to the Coeur d‚ÄôAlene district in Idaho. Butte started as a placer gold camp in 1864, and the placers were exhausted by 1867. But in 1874 prospectors discovered silver veins. Butte flourished as a silver-mining district until miners tunneled into large copper veins in 1882. From then until the 1980s, Butte was primarily a copper-mining district, but with a lot of silver as a byproduct.Charles Meyer and others (1968) Ore deposits at Butte, Montana, in Ore Deposits in the United States, 1933-1967, New York: American Institute of Mining Engineers, v.2, p.1373-1416. Butte produced more than 716 million troy ounces (22,300 mt) of silver through 2005.Steve J. Czehura, \\"Butte: a world-class ore deposit,\\" Mining Engineering, Sept. 2006 p.14-19. Silver was discovered at Phillipsburg in 1864, and the district was one of the most prolific silver producers in Montana. Major mines included the Granite Mountain mine, the Bi-Metallic mine, and the Hope mine. In 1887, the district produced 2.2 million troy ounces (68 metric tons) of silver, making it the largest silver producer in the US for that year.Lee I. Niedringhaus, Silver rampage, Financial History, Fall 2005, p.26. The district suffered greatly from the fall in the price of silver in 1893, and remained moribund until World War I, when the manganese deposits of the district became valuable, and Philipsburg became one of the top US producers of that metal. Silver occurs in veins filling fracture zones through Paleozoic limestone. Minerals in the silver-ore veins include polybasite, pyrargyrite, proustite, sphalerite, galena, and tennantite. Manganese occurs as replacement bodies of pyrolusite and rhodochrosite in limestone adjacent to the fracture zones. No mines are presently active in the district.E. N. Goddard (1940) Manganese deposits at Philipsburg, Granite County, Montana, US Geological Survey, Bulletin 922-G. Nevada The discovery of the Comstock Lode in 1858 inaugurated large-scale silver mining in the United States. The Comstock was the first important silver-mining district in the United States, and its discovery stimulated a great deal of prospecting for silver across the Great Basin area of the United States. The resulting silver rush led to many other silver discoveries in Nevada, including El Dorado Canyon (1861), Austin (1862), Eureka (1864), and Pioche (1869). The Rochester Mine is the only operating primary silver producer in Nevada and the second largest in the USA (after the Greens Creek mine in Alaska). In 2015 it produced 4.6 million ounces of silver and 52,588 ounces of gold from an open pit and heap leaching operation. Nevada produces a larger amount of silver, 6,744,703 ounces in 2014, as a byproduct of the mining of gold. New Hampshire Silver-bearing galena was mined from three districts in New Hampshire.Dennis P. Cox (1970) Lead-Zinc-Silver Deposits Related to the White Mountain Plutonic Series in New Hampshire and Maine, US Geological Survey, Bulletin 1312-D. The Silver Lake mine near Madison in Carroll County operated intermittently from 1826 to 1918. Ore was extracted from underground workings until 1915, when a small open pit was dug. The Mascot mine and the Shelburne mine worked veins in schist and granite on Mount Hayes, between Gorham and Shelburne in Coos County. The Shelburne mine operated intermittently from the 1830s into the 1850s; a final attempt at mining took place in 1880. The Mascot mine worked from 1881 to 1885 and in 1906. The North Woodstock mine, near the town of the same name in Grafton County, apparently mined and milled lead-silver ore, although no production records are known. New Mexico No silver is known to have been mined in New Mexico prior to the silver discovery in 1863 near Magdalena in Socorro County. The major silver-mining area of Silver City in Grant County was discovered in 1866.A.J. Thompson (1965) Silver, in Mineral and Water Resources of New Mexico, New Mexico Bureau of Mines and Geology, Bulletin 87, p.141. A rancher found the Lake Valley silver deposits in Sierra County in 1876. The deposits are bedded manto-type deposits in Paleozoic limestone. The mines, promoted by Whitaker Wright, produced well for a few years after miners tunneled into a silver-lined cavity they named the ‚Äúbridal chamber‚Äù that alone yielded 2.5 million troy ounces (78 metric tons) of silver. But no more bridal chambers were discovered, the mines struggled and were worked periodically into the 20th century. The district produced manganese during World Wars I and II.E. J. Young and T. G. Lovering (1966) Jasperoids of the Lake Valley mining district, New Mexico, US Geological Survey, Bulletin 1222-D. Total production of the Lake Valley district through 1931 was 5.8 million ounces (180 metric tons) of silver.George Townsend Harley (1934) The geology and ore deposits of Sierra County, New Mexico, State Bureau of Mines and Mineral Resources, Bulletin 10, p.178-179. Almost all the silver produced today in New Mexico comes as a byproduct from the two large open-pit copper mines in southwest New Mexico. North Carolina The Silver Hill mine in Davidson County, also known as the King mine and the Washington mine, was discovered in 1838. Excluding Mexican silver mines in land later acquired by the US, the Silver Hill mine was the first silver mine in the United States. It produced silver, gold, lead, copper, and zinc intermittently from its discovery until the mid-1870s.L. Michael Kaas, \\"The Silver Hill Mine: first silver mine in the United States and supplier of lead to the Confederacy,\\" Mining History Journal, 2009, p.29-44. Oklahoma Copper and silver occur in a sandstone roll-front-type deposit in the Wellington sandstone of Permian age at Paoli, Garvin County, Oklahoma. About 1900, several wagon loads of ore were shipped from the deposit.P.N. Shockey and others, (1974) Copper-silver solution fronts at Paoli, Oklahoma, Economic Geology, v.69, n.2, p.266-268. Oregon Most silver in Oregon was produced as a byproduct of gold and copper mining. Two mines operated primarily for their silver were the Bay Horse mine in Baker County, which produced 125,000 ounces (3.9 metric tons) of silver, and the Oregon King mine in Jefferson County, which produced 300,000 ounces (9.3 metric tons) of silver.H.C. Brooks and Len Ramp (1969) Gold and silver, in Mineral and Water Resources of Oregon, Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries, Bulletin 64, p.133, 136. Pennsylvania The Pequea silver mine near Conestoga in Lancaster County was worked from before the Revolutionary War to 1875. A minor amount of mining was done about 1900. The ore is silver-bearing galena in the Cambrian Vintage Dolomite. Production is unknown.Jacob Freedman (1972) Geochemical prospecting for zinc, lead, copper, and silver, Lancaster Valley, southeastern Pennsylvania, US Geological Survey, Bulletin 1314-C, p.C34-C43  Texas  The Allamoore-Van Horn silver-mining district in Hudspeth County and Culberson counties was discovered in 1880, and mined intermittently. Silver and copper were mined from Precambrian igneous and sedimentary rocks. No reliable production figures are available.R.D. Sample and E.E. Gould (1945) Geology and Ore Deposits of the Allamoore-Van Horn Copper District, Hudspeth and Culberson Counties, Texas, US Geological Survey, Open-File Report 45-22. Silver mineralization was discovered in 1880 or 1881 in Presidio County, Texas. Mining began in 1883 at what became the town of Shafter.Clyde P. Ross (1943) Geology and ore deposits of the Shafter mining district, Presidio County, Texas, US Geological Survey, Bulletin 928-B. At least six mines were worked. The deposits are manto-type deposits in Permian limestone of the Mina Grande formation, related to an igneous intrusive. Silver minerals include argentite and native silver. Associated minerals include the lead minerals anglesite and galena, the zinc minerals sphalerite, hemimorphite, and smithsonite, and gangue minerals quartz, calcite, goethite, and dolomite. Total production to 1999 was 35 million troy ounces (1090 metric tons) of silver, along with some gold.Douglas B. Silver, \\"Finding the silver lining in Shafter, Texas,\\" Mining Engineering, Mar. 1999, p.28-32. Aurcana Corp. of Vancouver has announced plans to reopen the silver mine.Aurcana Corp. website  Utah  The beginning of silver mining was delayed in Utah, due to its remote location. The completion of the transcontinental railroad spurred prospecting in Utah, and led to major silver discoveries. The first mining claim in the Park City district was staked in 1868, and the first ore shipment made in 1871. Prominent mines included the Flagstaff mine, Ontario mine, and Silver King mine. Ore occurs in veins and replacement deposits in sedimentary and igneous rocks.Clark L. Wilson (1959) Park City Mining District, in Guidebook to the Geology of the Wasatch and Uinta Mountains Transition Area, Salt Lake: Intermountain Association of Petroleum Geologists, p.182-188. The Horn Silver Mine was discovered in 1870 with the first discovery of significant value occurring in 1875. On September 24 of that year, Samuel Hawks (or Hawke) and James Ryan uncovered silver- bearing rock at the Horn Silver Ledge in what later became the San Francisco mining district near Milford, Utah. Significant mining began the next year. By 1882, the Horn Silver Mine was the largest silver producer in the world.Daily Tribune of August 4, 1882 as quoted in Horton (2002, p. 245). The Little Cottonwood district came into prominence in the 1870s with large ore shipments from the Emma Silver Mine, the Flagstaff Mine, the Emily Mine, and others. Silver ore was found in sandstone formations in the Silver Reef district in 1866, although large-scale mining operations did not begin until 1875. Today almost all the silver produced in Utah comes from the Bingham Canyon Mine, which produces silver as a byproduct of copper mining. * Utah History to Go: Silver in the Beehive State Virginia Virginia has produced about 90 thousand ounces of silver as a byproduct of mining other metals.Virginia Division of Geology and Mineral Resources: Silver  Washington  The Chewelah district in Stevens County produced 1.7 million troy ounces (53 metric tons) of silver and 5,000 metric tons of copper from quartz-carbonate veins.

This succession is transmitted from each bishop to their successors by the rite of Holy Orders. It is sometimes subject of episcopal genealogy.  Line of succession  In the churches that have well-documented ties to the history of Christianity as a whole, it is held that only a person in apostolic succession, a line of succession of bishops dating back to the Apostles, can be a valid bishop; can validly ordain priests, deacons and bishops; and can validly celebrate the sacraments of the church. These churches are the Roman Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Eastern Rite Catholic Church, the Oriental Orthodox Church, the Church of Sweden, the Church of Denmark (Lutheran), the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland, the Old Catholic Church, the Moravian Church, the Independent Catholic Churches, the Anglican Communion, and the Assyrian Church of the East. The definition of the historical episcopate is to some extent an open question. Bishops of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America lay claim to the apostolic succession through the laying on of hands by bishops of the Episcopal Church, the latter of which is part of the Anglican Communion.Called to Common Mission Text, paragraph 18 Some theologians, such as R.J. Cooke, have argued that the Methodist Church is also within the historic episcopate, being \\"in direct succession to the apostles through the bishops and patriarchs of the Eastern Church.\\" An Anglican-Methodist Covenant stated that The Roman Catholic Church holds that a bishop's consecration is valid if the sacrament of Holy Orders is validly administered with the intention of doing what the Roman Catholic Church does by ordination and according to a valid sacramental form, and if the consecrating bishop's orders are valid, regardless of whether the rite takes place within or outside the Roman Catholic Church. Thus, Roman Catholics recognize the validity of the episcopacy of Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Assyrian Church of the East and Old Catholic bishops, but argue the validity regarding Lutheran bishops, Anglican bishops, Moravian bishops and Independent Catholic bishops (see Episcopi vagantes). The Eastern Orthodox Church's view has been summarised, \\"While accepting the canonical possibility of recognising the existence (œÖœÄŒøœÉœÑŒ±œÑœåŒΩ) of sacraments performed outside herself, (the Eastern Orthodox Church) questions their validity (Œ≠Œ≥Œ∫œÖœÅŒøŒΩ) and certainly rejects their efficacy (ŒµŒΩŒµœÅŒ≥œåŒΩ)\\"; and it sees \\"the canonical recognition (Œ±ŒΩŒ±Œ≥ŒΩœéœÅŒπœÉŒπœÇ) of the validity of sacraments performed outside the Orthodox Church (as referring) to the validity of the sacraments only of those who join the Orthodox Church (individually or as a body).\\"Professor Dr. Vlassios Pheidas: The limits of the church in an orthodox perspective This applies to the validity and efficacy of the ordination of bishops and the other sacraments, not only of the Independent Catholic Churches, but also of all other Christian Churches, including the Roman Catholic Church, Oriental Orthodoxy, and the Assyrian Church of the East. In 1922 the Eastern Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople recognised Anglican orders as valid, holding that they carry \\"the same validity as the Roman, Old Catholic and Armenian Churches possess\\". In the encyclical \\"From the Oecumenical Patriarch to the Presidents of the Particular Eastern Orthodox Churches\\", Meletius IV of Constantinople, the Oecumenical Patriarch, wrote: \\"That the Orthodox theologians who have scientifically examined the question have almost unanimously come to the same conclusions and have declared themselves as accepting the validity of Anglican Orders.\\" Following this declaration, in 1923, the Eastern Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem, as well as the Eastern Orthodox Church of Cyprus agreed by \\"provisionally acceding that Anglican priests should not be re-ordained if they became Orthodox\\"; in 1936, the Romanian Orthodox Church \\"endorsed Anglican Orders\\". Historically, some Eastern Orthodox bishops have assisted in the consecration of Anglican bishops; for example, in 1870, the Most Reverend Alexander Lycurgus, the Greek Orthodox Archbishop of Syra and Tinos, was one of the bishops who consecrated Henry MacKenzie as the Suffragan Bishop of Nottingham. Because of changes in the Ordinal (the rites of Holy Orders) under King Edward VI, the Roman Catholic Church does not fully recognize all Anglican Holy Orders as valid, but the latter are recognized (and participated in) by Old Catholics, whose Holy Orders are considered valid by Rome.  Anglican views  In the sixteenth century a solid body of Anglican opinion emerged which saw the theological importance of the historic episcopate but refused to 'unchurch' those churches which did not retain it. The preface to the Ordinal limits itself to stating historical reasons why episcopal orders are to 'be continued and reverently used in the Church of England'. Before 1662 it was assumed that the foreign Reformed (Presbyterian) Churches were genuine ones with an authentic ministry of Word and Sacrament. The 1662 Act of Uniformity formally excluded from pastoral office in England any who lacked episcopal ordination but this was a reaction against the abolition of episcopacy in the Commonwealth period. As the divergences between the theory of 'the godly prince' and the practices of monarchs like James II, William III and the early Georges became more obvious, Pearson and Beveridge saw the \\"Apostolical Office\\" of the bishop as a guarantee of the Church's identity and this formed the background to the vital emphasis placed on it by Newman and the other Tractarians, through whom it passed into Anglo-Catholic thought. The modern debate divides three ways: between those who see the \\"historic episcopate\\" to be constitutive of the Church (of the esse); those who hold it is a question of its \\"well-being\\"(bene esse); and those who consider that it is necessary for the Church to be fully itself (plene esse). The Chicago-Lambeth Quadrilateral includes the \\"historic episcopate\\" as \\"essential to the visible unity of the church\\", but allows for its being adapted locally in its working to the varying needs of those who God calls into the unity of the Church. However, this has not meant a general commitment to the idea that in its absence there is no Church.

World War II Pacific Theatre operations The newly commissioned minesweeper's first assignment took her to the Aleutian Islands to carry out antisubmarine warfare (ASW) patrols and escort assignments protecting various vessels as they moved between Unalaska, Adak, and Atka Islands. On 16 September 1943, USS Annoy departed Dutch Harbor to escort and her tow, , to Seattle, Washington, where the convoy arrived on 5 October. The next day, Annoy entered the Puget Sound Navy Yard, Bremerton, Washington, for upkeep. The vessel left the yard on 9 November, bound for San Pedro, California. Upon her arrival there, Annoy began a month of mine-sweeping and ASW exercises. On 11 December, she began escort duty out of San Francisco, California, to various points in the Pacific. Among her destinations were Pearl Harbor, Hawaii; Majuro Atoll, Marshall Islands; Funafuti, Ellice Islands; and Tarawa, Gilbert Islands.  Pearl Harbor upkeep  USS Annoy entered the Pearl Harbor Navy Yard on 16 April 1944 for upkeep. Upon the conclusion of the work, she commenced operations with Submarine Squadron 4 based at Pearl Harbor. The ship served as a screening and escort vessel and acted as a target ship for submarines during their training routines.  Conversion to patrol craft  The name Annoy was cancelled on 1 June and the ship's classification was changed to PC-1588. She was relieved of her training duties on 23 July and got underway for San Francisco. She entered a shipyard at Alameda, California, on 3 August, for availability.

Badat and starring Eddie Deezen, Linda Kerridge, Eric Stoltz, Jeffrey Rogers and Peter Isacksen. The plot revolves around Menlo Schwartzer, a maniacal mad scientist who creates a chemically altered soft drink which turns its drinkers into mutant zombie punks as part of a diabolical scheme to rid the beaches of surfers. The film is a contemporary parody of 1960s-style beach party films, mixing elements of the horror, science fiction, surf and teen film genres. Despite what the title implies, there was never a Surf I. Surf II was marketed with a number of subheadings, the most common of which was in fact Surf II: The End of the Trilogy. Although the film was received negatively by critics upon release and has never been officially released on DVD, it has since been rediscovered in recent years on VHS and YouTube, and is now considered a cult film. Plot :Long ago in \\"The Good Old Days\\", surfers ruled. It was bitchin'! That was before the threat of chemical pollution, nuclear waste and the horror of Buzzz Cola. :Menlo Schwartzer was a high school genius who hated surfers. He invented a weird soft drink, involved local businessmen and set out to rule the coast. He nearly succeeded. This is the story of Buzzz Cola and Menlo's revenge. Deep in his secret underwater laboratory, teenage mad scientist Menlo Schwartzer plots to rid the beaches of his greatest enemies: surfers. Having been driven to revenge following a cruel practical joke gone awry, Menlo concocts an addictive chemical agent which turns its drinkers into mutated, garbage-ingesting zombie punks. With the reluctant help of his girlfriend Sparkle and a pair of greedy, cigar-chomping soda businessmen, Menlo distributes the chemical under the guise of \\"Buzzz Cola\\", and one by one begins to build an army of brainless zombie slaves to do his bidding. After several of their friends fall victim to Buzzz Cola, airheaded surfer dudes Chuck and Bob begin to piece together the parts of Menlo's evil scheme. Finding no help from their spaced-out parents or the bumbling efforts of the local police force, the two enlist the services of their eccentric science teacher and vow to stop Menlo for good, or else they will not be able to compete in the big surf contest this weekend.

Around this time, Badat suffered a surfing injury which warranted the use of heavy painkillers; it was during this period of being \\"completely out of [his] mind\\" that he discussed the idea for a \\"Frankie and Annette Go to Hell\\" type of beach party movie parody with his writer friends, who encouraged him to commit it to screenplay. Badat wrote Surf II - originally titled Surf Trash - over the course of two days while he recuperated from his injury. After completing the screenplay, Badat's agent dismissed it as \\"the worst piece of shit [he'd] ever seen\\". Undeterred, Badat showed the script to numerous friends and eventually caught the attention of independent film producers George Braunstein and Ron Hamady, who put together financing and eventually sold the project to production company Arista Films at the Cannes Film Festival. Arista had planned to film Surf II in 3-D; though several pre-production posters were made carrying the title Surf II 3-D, the idea was eventually scrapped. Badat wrote the role of Menlo Schwartzer specifically for Eddie Deezen, having been a fan of his performance in Robert Zemeckis' 1978 film I Wanna Hold Your Hand. According to Deezen, Menlo Schwartzer was named \\"Stinky Schwartzer\\" in the script until Deezen pressured Badat to change it. Many of the comic actors were allowed to improvise their lines, and several of the odd props throughout the film were contributed by Deezen himself, including a baseball cap with an absurdly elongated brim and an oversized pair of novelty scissors. Among Surf II's crew were cinematographer Alex Phillips Jr. (Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia), composer Peter Bernstein and Academy Award-winning make up artist Greg Cannom. Surf II was filmed in 29 days during the summer of 1983. The beach scenes were shot at various locations throughout Malibu, Redondo Beach and Hermosa Beach, while interior shots were filmed at a studio in Culver City. According to Badat, several shots in the film - specifically ones depicting nudity - were later inserted into the film by the executive producers after they decided they wanted an \\"R\\" rating: \\"these shots don't even match the rest of the film if you look at the cinematography\\". Release and reception Menlo Schwartzer and his girlfriend Sparkle. Surf II was released theatrically in North America in January 1984. It was marketed with the title Surf II: The End of the Trilogy, but later promotions re-titled the film Surf II: The Nerds Strike Back, following the success of Revenge of the Nerds, which was released that summer. The film screened in Europe in the fall of 1984, retitled in Spain as Locura de playa (roughly translated as \\"Beach Madness\\"). ;Contemporary reviews Although Badat claims that initial test screenings were successful, critical reviews of Surf II were overwhelmingly negative. In his Movie Guide, Leonard Maltin gave the film a 1.5 out of 5 star rating, writing that the \\"best joke is its title - there never was a Surf I\\". Kim Newman quipped in the Monthly Film Bulletin, \\"traditionally, sequels are never up to the standards of the original: Surf II, which is a sequel to nothing in particular, is therefore worse than anyone could possibly have imagined\\", calling it \\"incoherent\\" and \\"most dreadful\\". The Chicago Tribune called it \\"total trash\\" and the Los Angeles Times simply remarked \\"there was no Surf I - and with luck, there'll be no Surf III\\". In a more contemporary professional review, AllMovie, though having rated Surf II one star out of five, noted that the film is \\"never dull\\" and \\"deranged enough to be memorable\\", giving praise to the performances of the ensemble cast and summarizing, \\"Surf II's unbalanced mix of amateurishness and gonzo humor will confound most viewers, but fans of B-movie weirdness will find more than enough memorable moments to keep themselves entertained\\". Randall Badat himself has spoken about the negative reaction to Surf II and how it extended beyond film critics: \\"The target audience loved it. Their parents hated it. My family hated it. People that I was doing other business with hated it. I remember going to meetings and people would find out that I'd done this movie and that was it\\". He has also expressed an overall disappointment with the film, remarking \\"If there's anything I would have done differently... I'd have done everything differently\\", though ultimately admitting \\"I guess it's pretty funny.... I'm amazed at how well the film still plays, and I guess it works overall\\". ;Cult legacy Johnny Big Head challenges the cola zombies to a garbage-eating contest. In spite of (or perhaps because of) its critical ravaging, Surf II has developed a following among cult film fans. Cult film website McBeardo's Midnight Movies ranked Surf II on its list of \\"15 Movies That Deserve Massive Cult Followings\\", calling the film \\"serious competition\\" for the position of the \\"#1 most off-the-wall and ingenious teen sex comedy of the ‚Äô80s\\". The Scarecrow Video Movie Guide, describes the film as \\"[packing] more slapstick and early-80s drive-in mania into one movie than any sane mind could imagine\\", stating bluntly \\"missing this movie would be like beating yourself in the face with a brick!\\" Radioactive Reviews, a website specializing in reviewing \\"The Movies That DVD Forgot\\", noted that Surf II \\"doesn't make much sense and doesn't have much of a story\\", though the film creates \\"an amusing, cartoonish world that's fun to watch\\", and would ultimately be of interest to \\"lovers of [the 80s'] sillier, less-coherent cinematic creations\\". In 2010, Alamo Drafthouse programmers Zack Carlson and Bryan Connolly prominently featured Surf II in their book Destroy All Movies!!! The Complete Guide to Punks on Film, including interviews with Badat and Deezen. The book offered a rave review of Surf II as the \\"greatest mohawked-zombie-comedy ever made\\", calling it \\"pure fun in the form of a movie, born at a short-lived moment in history where culture was low and damaged enough to sustain a comedy of this magnitude. No joke is too easy or bizarre but the film manages to excel with countless deeply creative moments\\", while also praising the \\"career best\\" performance of Deezen and the \\"powerful comic work\\" of its ensemble cast.

The club broke ground by becoming the first successful non-Anglo migrant backed club in the state, laying the foundation for the dominance of other migrant run clubs after World War II. While the club was unable to win a league title post-war, it still managed several victories in the Dockerty Cup, including four consecutive titles in the 1950s.

After the Archbishop of Trier Theotgaud was excommunicated by Pope Nicholas I in October 863 in Rome and deposed, and died in Rome in 868, Charles the Bald managed in 869 to have his candidate, Bertulf, appointed as Theotgaud's successor and confirmed by the Pope. Bertulf had previously been abbot of Mettlach. His election ended the long period of sede vacante. Charles also awarded the new Archbishop the crown estate of Merzig. The election of Bertulf was a provocation to Louis the German, who then set up his own candidate. This was Bertulf's brother Waldo, abbot of St. Maximin's Abbey in Trier. Eight years previously, he had been convicted of disloyalty at the Imperial Diet in Regensburg along with his brothers Udo and Berengar and their uncle Ernest, and like them, had been stripped of his offices and titles. His candidacy, however, foundered at the opposition of the other Archbishops.

Remains of this animal have been found in the Upper Elliot Formation and it is among the most completely known early ornithischians, shedding new light on the origin of the group. The exact age of this taxon has been the subject of uncertainty. It was originally interprereted as living during the Late Triassic (Norian age), around 210 million years ago; however, Olsen, Kent & Whiteside (2010) stated that there is no independent geochronological support for its assumed age, and the available data makes it impossible to conclusively determine whether Eocursor is of Triassic or Early Jurassic (potentially as young as Sinemurian) age. Eocursor was subsequently interpreted as a taxon of Early Jurassic age by McPhee et al. (2017), who identified the specimen as having originated from the Upper (not Lower) Elliot Formation. Fossils of Eocursor were originally collected in 1993, but were not formally described until fourteen years later. The type species, Eocursor parvus, was described in 2007 by Richard J. Butler, Roger M. H. Smith, and David B. Norman. Eocursor was one of the earliest known ornithischians, and sheds some light on early dinosaur relationships because early dinosaurs are known from mostly incomplete skeletons. Eocursor is known from partial skeletal elements, including skull fragments, spinal elements, pelvis, long leg bones, and unusually large grasping hands. Description Size comparison Eocursor was a lightly built bipedal dinosaur with an estimated length of about 1 m (3 ft). The general aspect of the animal resembles that of the early Jurassic ornithischians such as Lesothosaurus and Scutellosaurus. Its large hands resembled those of the Heterodontosauridae, a clade of primitive ornithischians. The morphology of the triangular teeth, not unlike those of an iguana, suggests partial herbivory. The tibia was significantly longer than the femur, indicating it was a swift runner. Discovery and naming In 1993, the holotype specimen of Eocursor (SAM- PK-K8025) was collected from the Upper Elliot Formation in Free State, South Africa. The skeleton, although only partially complete, is one of the best- preserved early ornithischian skeletons ever found. The fossils include a partial skeleton: portions of the skull, lower jaw, vertebrae, and limbs. In June 2007, the fossils were formally described by an international team of paleontologists: Richard Butler of the Natural History Museum, London, and the University of Cambridge, David Norman of the University of Cambridge, and Roger M. H. Smith of the Iziko South African Museum. The fossils were named Eocursor parvus, from the Greek word eos (meaning \\"dawn\\"), and the Latin words cursor (meaning \\"runner\\") and parvus (\\"little\\"), \\"in reference to the early occurrence of this ornithischian, its apparent locomotory abilities and its small size.\\" Classification Eocursor was an early ornithischian, one of the first so-called \\"bird-hipped\\" dinosaurs, a group which would eventually give rise to animals such as Stegosaurus, Triceratops, and Iguanodon. Butler et al. consider Eocursor more primitive than Lesothosaurus and Heterodontosauridae, but more derived than the Pisanosaurus, as a basal ornithischian forming a sister clade of Genasauria.

Originally composed of Gary Hodges (vocals), 'Hoxton' Tom McCourt (guitar), Steve 'H' Hamer (bass) and Gary Hitchcock (drums), they formed in 1979 and disbanded in 1984 ‚Äì although new line-ups formed in 2007 and 2008. Many of their songs dealt with violent topics, but the band has claimed they were discussing the realities of inner city life, not promoting violence. Other 4-Skins song topics include police harassment, political corruption, war and unemployment. Career Initially the band members had known each other from football, or from following bands such as Sham 69 and Menace. Most of the original four band members were or had been skinheads, thus the double meaning of the band's name. However, Steve Pear had a rockabilly style, and Hoxton Tom McCourt ‚Äî who was a suedehead ‚Äî was one of the leading participants of the mod revival. Prior to the release of the band's debut single, \\"One Law for Them\\", The 4-Skins contributed songs to the first three Oi! compilation albums, alongside bands such as Cockney Rejects, Cock Sparrer, The Business and Angelic Upstarts. The 4-Skins went through many personnel changes during their five-year existence, with only bassist/songwriter 'Hoxton' Tom McCourt being present in every line-up of the band. Other former members include Roi Pearce, who was also the frontman of The Last Resort, and Paul Swain, a guitarist who later joined the white power rock band Skrewdriver. In 2007, the band reformed with two original members ‚Äî lead singer Gary Hodges and bassist Steve 'H' Harmer, plus guitarist Mick Geggus and drummer Andy Russell of Cockney Rejects. This line-up recorded two songs, \\"Chaos 2007\\" and \\"Glory Days\\" for the compilation album Kings of Streetpunk, released by the independent record label G&R; London. In 2008, Hodges formed a new version of the band under the name Gary Hodges' 4-Skins. This line-up played three shows ‚Äì one in Berlin at the Punk and Disorderly festival, in Allentown, Pennsylvania, at the East Coast Oi Fest and as the headlining act on the final day of the Blackpool Rebellion punk festival in August 2008.

The play was a major popular success upon its premier, and became something of a legend in the theatre lore of the seventeenth century. Performance 260px Cooke's play was performed by Queen Anne's Men at the Red Bull Theatre in 1611. The play satirises Coryat's Crudities, the travelogue by Thomas Coryat published in that year. The company's leading clown, Thomas Greene, played the role of Bubble in the play, and his rendering of Bubble's catch phrase \\"Tu quoque\\" (Latin for \\"you also\\" or, colloquially, \\"the same to you\\"), repeated through the play, captured the audience's fancy. The play was performed twice at Court, on 27 December 1611 and 2 February 1612 (Candlemas night), before King James I and Queen Anne; Greene, representing his troupe, received a payment of ¬£20 for the two performances on 18 June 1612 (which shows how long the players sometimes waited for money from their royal patrons). By that date in the summer of 1612, Cooke's play had already lost its original title; the Court records refer to the work as Tu Coque.Chambers, Vol. 4, p. 178. Greene's Tu Quoque would likely have become a key item in the Queen's Men's repertory, except for the unfortunate death of Thomas Greene in August 1612. The play was revived by the Queen of Bohemia's Men and performed at Court on 6 January 1625 before Charles I. In the Restoration period, Sir William Davenant produced his own adaptation of Cooke's play in 1667; Samuel Pepys saw it on 12 September of that year. Davenant's version was not published in its own era, and no copy of it has survived. Francis Kirkman's 1662 volume The Wits uses a frontispiece that alludes to the play: a picture of a clown peeking out from behind a curtain is captioned \\"Tu quoque\\". Publication The play was first published in a 1614 quarto issued by the bookseller John Trundle. (The play was published without an entry in the Stationers' Register, which was unusual though not unknown. Trundle ‚Äì whose shop bore the sign of \\"the Nobody\\" ‚Äì would publish A Fair Quarrel three years later, in 1617, also without a Register entry.) In this first edition, the work was called Greene's Tu Quoque, or The City Gallant; and it was under its ad hoc title that the play maintained its fame. The first edition bore a picture of Greene, in costume, on its title page. A second quarto was printed in 1622 for stationer Thomas Drew, and a third, undated quarto followed sometime later, perhaps by 1628. Playwright Virtually nothing is known of the author. He is identified as \\"Io. Cooke\\" on the title page of the 1614 quarto, and for many years scholars were not even sure if his name was John or Joshua.Chambers, Vol. 3, p. 269 The first quarto bears an Epistle to the Reader by Thomas Heywood, which indicates that Cooke was dead by 1614. John Payne Collier speculated that John Cooke was a brother of Alexander Cooke, actor with the King's Men. The plot Cooke's play can be classed with other prodigal-son plays of its era, like Eastward Ho and The Roaring Girl. It tells a double version of the story: the citizen Spendall, as his name indicates, wastes his patrimony and is reduced to poverty and prison. Bubble enjoys the reverse fortune, coming into money ‚Äì yet he remains true to his master, the gentlemanly Staines, mourning the man's decline and urging him to repair his fortunes...by robbery (\\"if we be taken, we'll hang together at Tyburn\\"). The high-living Staines loses his estate to a usurer in a foreclosed debt; the usurer dies and passes his wealth to his nephew...Bubble. In a reversal of roles, Staines becomes Bubble's servant. Staines gets his revenge by making Bubble a pretentious fool, worse than the natural fool he already was. Through a series of disguises and cheats, Staines eventually manages to reverse his situation, till he is the master and Bubble the servant once again. Greene's Tu Quoque gives a rich picture of everyday life in its era; it \\"uses tennis rackets, tobacco pipes, cards, dice and candles to establish a life of debauchery in visual terms...and a begging-basket with scraps of food to symbolize the natural result....\\"Leggatt, p. 57. The play's stark picture of debtors' prison is noteworthy. The drama is lavish in its use of costume and the details of the mercer's trade in the London of its time.MacIntyre, pp. 266‚Äì7; Leggatt, p. 66. Metafiction The play's text contains a bit of meta- theater, in that Greene in the role of Bubble refers to himself during performance:Leggatt, p. 97. :Geraldine: Why, then, we'll go to the Red Bull: they say Greene's a good clown. :Bubble: Greene! Greene's an ass. :Scattergood: Wherefore do you say so? :Bubble: Indeed I ha' no reason; for they say he is as like me as ever he can look. Ben Jonson would work the same trick in 1616 in his The Devil is an Ass, by referring in his text to actor Richard Robinson, who starred in the original production. And Thomas Killigrew would give his version of the trick in The Parson's Wedding (1641). Greene Thomas Greene was born in Romford, Essex, in September 1573; his baptism is recorded as 13 September 1573. He was with the Queen's Men from 1604 (shortly after the death of the company's celebrated comedian Will Kempe) and his usual stage persona was that of \\"amiable ass\\". By the time of his death in August 1612 had had risen to be a principal investor in the company, as well as the leaseholder of the nearby Curtain Theatre. One cryptic epigram states that \\"new come from sea, [he] made but one face and died\\"; this, states William Oldys, appeared in Richard Braithwaite's Remains after Death (1618) and signifies that he had recently returned from overseas and specialized in but one type of role. He once played a baboon onstage. His 1612 last will and testament mentions his wife Susan, daughter Honor, brothers John and Jeffrey Greene and sister Elizabeth Barrett. The will also mentions two sons-in-law and three daughters-in-law, though in Greene's day these terms referred to stepchildren ‚Äì his wife Susan's five children with her first husband, Robert Browne. (Greene's will, dated 25 July 1612, left his share in the company to his wife. She later remarried, and as Susan Baskervile initiated the lawsuit that would end the existence of Queen Anne's Men.)

In 1886, he was ordained as a minister and became the founding president and headmaster of the Wesleyan Ladies' College, Burwood. (now MLC School). He introduced challenging academic studies for girls, as well as music and competitive games. In time ex-pupils excelled at the University of Sydney, enhancing the college's reputation. He also established a co-educational kindergarten, probably the first in the Australia. MLC School was given colours, crest, motto, uniform, magazine and other traditions from English public schools. He was greatly helped by his wife, Annie, who took charge of the domestic arrangements and music. In 1900 he moved to Newington College, Stanmore, as president and headmaster, the first to hold dual office. He fostered the ideal of a balanced liberal education within a Christian environment, with an emphasis on mathematics and classical studies. Other emphases were correct English, team games, and commitment to 'family, school, King and God'. He retired from Newington in 1931 after a record term. Prescott House, one of the eight Houses within the College, was named after Prescott as was Prescott Hall.

It is not a tax and is not deductible as a property tax. It is a transfer fee, payable upon the sale of an apartment to the co-op. Flip taxes are considered a method to help raise money for a co- op's overhead expenses without raising the maintenance fees or assessing flat charge to all residences. Charging the fee to those who are leaving the building seems to be the most politically feasible. Types # A flat fee # A dollar amount based on shares allocated to the subject apartment # A percentage based on the sales price # A percentage based on the net profit of the sale # A fee based on the duration the seller has owned the apartments (shorter time periods of ownership typically bring higher fees) Legality The imposition of flip taxes in New York City has been supported in the courts. The New York State Legislature in July 1986 acted on a proposal from the Council of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums and defined in what way co-ops could legally impose these fees. Specifically, the law allows such an assessment if either of the following applies: # if it is sanctioned in the co-op's proprietary lease # if the lease is amended with more than two thirds of shareholders approving. Flip taxes appear to be legal for condominiums in New York City and New Jersey but are generally uncommon.

Wisker moved to London in 1866 to become a reporter for the City Press and befriended Howard Staunton. His proficiency at chess improved rapidly, and he won the 1870 British Chess Championship after a play-off against Amos Burn, ahead of Blackburne, the defending champion. He won again in 1872 after a play-off against the first British champion, Cecil Valentine De Vere. After this second victory, the British championship was not resumed until 1904. Wisker edited chess columns for The Sporting Times and Land and Water. From 1872 to 1876, Wisker was Secretary of the British Chess Association and co-editor of The Chess Player's Chronicle. After learning that he had contracted tuberculosis, Wisker emigrated to Australia in the autumn of 1876 to try to regain his health. In Australia, he wrote a chess column for the Australasian.

Route description The southern terminus of Jamboree Road is at Bayside Drive, immediately before Balboa Island. Its name changes to Marine Avenue as it makes the very short journey over the water that separates Balboa from Newport Beach. The road enters Irvine after the intersection with MacArthur Boulevard and continues into the Irvine urban core after the I-405 interchange. At Barranca Parkway, Jamboree Road becomes a freeway, with grade- separated intersections and limited right-of-way. As a freeway, Jamboree has exits at Warner Avenue, Edinger Avenue, and Walnut Avenue. After splitting with SR 261, Jamboree Road intersects I-5 and bisects the Irvine/Tustin Marketplace, the north side being Tustin and the south side being Irvine. It proceeds north through the foothills, crossing the Loma Ridge alongside SR 261 (the Eastern Transportation Corridor toll road) to its northern terminus in the City of Orange, at the intersection with Santiago Canyon Road (County Route S18). Jamboree Road is heavily used by commuters who work at the Irvine Urban Core districts such as the IBC (Irvine Business Center) and the Irvine Towers. History Region XII gateway' at the national 1953 National Scout Jamboree The 1953 National Scout Jamboree of the Boy Scouts of America held its event where Newport Center and Fashion Island now sit. It was the third national jamboree, the first to be held west of the Mississippi River, and had 50,000 scouts from all 48 states and 16 foreign countries.Orange County - 1946 to 1962 Thousands of tents were pitched in the area accessible only by a muddy two-lane trail called Palisades Road (part of which is now the southern end of Bristol Avenue). The road was soon paved, and later the name was changed to Jamboree Road in honor of the event. One attendee, David Sills, then a young Boy Scout from Peoria, Illinois, would later move to Irvine as an adult and serve four terms as mayor of the city. The current route of Jamboree Road follows the courses of four originally unconnected roads - these were, from south to north, the original stretch of Jamboree that extended from the present-day course of Bristol Street to Pacific Coast Highway, San Joaquin Road, Myford Road, and Peters Canyon Road. Future Currently, Jamboree Road terminates at Santiago Canyon Road. Plans in the future with the city of Anaheim and The Irvine Company on the \\"Mountain Park\\" neighborhood call to extend Jamboree Road to Weir Canyon Road with an at-grade intersection. In addition, the plans call for Weir Canyon Road to be extended to SR 241 with a tolled exit and for Gypsum Canyon Road to be extended to Weir Canyon Road. The Jamboree extension would have a brief run through Irvine Regional Park and would run parallel to SR 241. The route would serve as an alternate route for drivers who use SR 55 and Imperial Highway (via Cannon Street) in Orange, which usually are congested during peak hours, and such an extension would reduce congestion along those roads.https://www.anaheim.net/DocumentCenter/View/2615 Though this plan would benefit many drivers and provide housing and jobs, it is unknown when the project will break ground or reach completion. Along with this project, the cities of Anaheim and Yorba Linda as well as Caltrans call for select toll lanes on SR 241 to connect with SR 91's toll lanes, which would be parallel to the proposed Weir Canyon Road exit and Mountain Park and would improve the congestion faced at the northern terminus on SR 241 when merging east.http://www.thetollroads.com/about/projects/241-91-connector However in 2014, the Irvine Company donated 55,000 acres of land (including portions in the city of Anaheim) to the county of Orange to be preserved as open space.

The ship was built for the gentle waters of Scottish lochs and was almost long and weighed 247 tonnes. After Alert sank the ship laid for 113 years on the ocean floor until being rediscovered in June 2007 by a team from Southern Ocean Exploration. History Alert was built at Port Glasgow in 1877 and later sailed to Australia as a three-masted schooner with her funnel and propeller stowed in the hold. After a few years on the Melbourne-Geelong route she temporarily replaced the on the Gippsland‚ÄìMelbourne run in 1893 whilst Despatch was being refitted. During a gale, the ship set out from Lakes Entrance bound for Melbourne via Port Albert. She encountered hurricane-force southerly winds and mountainous seas and sank about four miles off Cape Schanck. Of the 16 people on board, the only survivor was Robert Ponting, the ship's cook, who was washed ashore at Sorrento\\"back\\" (ocean) beach after clinging to a portion of cabin door. He was found and revived by locals using brandy and the body heat of a St. Bernard dog. Two bodies were also washed ashore at Sorrento back beach. An inquiry was held and attached no blame to the lighthouse keeper or the captain but, after years of litigation, compensation was awarded to Ponting and the wife of one of the deceased.

Martini's talk show. The story of the film is based on their We Kill Everything album. This movie is included in the \\"Gwar DVD Box Set\\". This is the last Gwar movie to feature Hunter Jackson, Casey Orr, and Danielle Stampe, as well as the only movie to also feature Zach Blair, as members of Gwar. Chuck Varga, who had left Gwar in 1996, immediately following the tours for RagNaRok, makes his final appearance as well. Plot The story begins on GWAR's popular TV channel Slave Pit TV, as documentary Great Moments in Pisstory details the discovery of an ancient stone tablet of alien origin and mysterious power, by archaeologist Dr. Leaky and his assistant. Upon \\"celebrating\\" his biggest discovery onto the tablet and his assistant, Dr. Leaky is soon gruesomely made short work of by the angered and awakened being buried near the tablet, and the show ends upon his assistant's cleavage, leading into the premise show It's Sleazy. On set, after extorting \\"funds\\" from various front row seats and greeting his crowd, GWAR manager Sleazy P. Martini starts the show's focus of \\"GWAR Fucked Up My Life\\", with habitually drunk and wealthy widow Dotty Crust and her son, whom she claims GWAR transformed into a monster upon the purchase of their albums and at \\"the site of Balsac's face\\". Soon after the messy \\"resolution\\" between her and her son, their next host, Wally Lipsmear, a now mentally insane and gender confused post-surgery midget and former MTV \\"V.J.\\", given the \\"Giuliani\\" treatment upon refusing the airing of GWAR's music videos for not having a \\"negro\\" in the band, is immediately crushed by debris by long lost sojourning Scumdog Scroda Moon, who walks in on set through a wall. Upon an easy battle with Sleazy's security goons, Sleazy is soon spared upon answering Scroda's quest for GWAR, as the band is backstage. Walking on set through the same wall, and coincidentally through Scroda's mystical stone tablet, various shady figures steal the remnants of the tablet as Oderous and Scroda engage and greet each other in combat. Settling down, Scroda states his purposes for his arrival: Not only dedicated to GWAR and the Scumdogs of the Universe as their mystic adviser and eternal helper, Scroda also planned to help GWAR gain favor once more with the Master through the use of his sacred tablet, which would spell doom for the universe however, should it be desecrated. While eager to truly help Scroda recover the tablet and evade the wrath of the Master, Scroda is put through a time honored ritual to prove himself worthy as a Scumdog of the Universe, a long time binge and constant hit of the Nitro Burnin Funny Bong, and dozens of other recreational drugs; Scroda passes the intense partying and holds his ground without fail. Soon, calling upon Porcelon, Scroda's legendary interdimensional portal potty, the group engages the thieving antagonists of the tablet, using its powers for petty means and fame as TV celebrities, defeating Marilyn Manson, The King of Rock N' Roll, the Jagermonsta, and YG, who is summoned by GWAR as a final test for Scroda to finally prove himself as Scumdog material. During the battle with YG however, Scroda is killed in battle, with Oderous needing to finish off the beast. Upon discovering the last piece of the tablet at Sleazy's Crab House, Oderous by himself attempts to piece the tablet together once more, however, the group ultimately discovers that they cannot repair it without Scroda's help, who is dead. Slymenstra soon takes on the task, and resurrects and surgically enhances Scroda back to life, bigger and stronger in the process. Able to finally piece the tablet back together and return to the reaches of deep space once more, Slymenstra disastrously disposes her Free Flow sheep tampon carcass in Porcelon's bowl, soon summoning the Master onto Earth. Engaged in a tense and epic battle against the Master, GWAR does all they can, however, broadcasting time is soon cut short by Sleazy, stating that while they do have time to broadcast, he states they don't \\"have time for this shit\\", being the destruction and chaos on Sleazy's set. Soon parting off, Sleazy makes mention of next week's episode, being the interview with Skulhedface, who has degenerated into a hopeless crack addict after having been embarrassingly defiled on national television.

Part of the Bougainville campaign, the battle occurred as a force of about 3,300 Japanese from the Japanese 6th Division, including artillery and other supporting elements, launched a counterattack against the main Australian offensive which had been pushing south towards Buin, concentrating their attacks on Slater's Knoll near the Puriata River. The Australian troops belonged to the 7th Brigade, with the 25th Infantry Battalion being the most heavily engaged, although the 9th Infantry Battalion and the 61st Infantry Battalion also took part in the fighting. Against Japanese tactics that included massed attacks, the Australians utilised armour and artillery, and in the end these proved decisive. Commencing in late March, after the Australian advance had been halted by wet weather, over the course of several days the Japanese launched several probing raids followed by heavy attacks against the Australians. The final assault on the knoll came on the night of 4/5 April when 129 men from 'B' Company, 25th Infantry Battalion repulsed an attack by a force of about 1,100 Japanese, killing 292. This proved to be the 7th Brigade's final involvement in the campaign as they were relieved by the 15th Brigade shortly afterwards. Overall, 620 Japanese were killed in the battle with another 1,000 estimated to have been wounded, while the Australians suffered 189 casualties. Background At the beginning of 1945, the south-eastern part of Bougainville was occupied by the Japanese 6th Division, under the command of Lieutenant General Tsutomu Akinaga. Made up of the 13th and 23rd Infantry Regiments‚Äî600 and 700-strong respectively‚Äîas well as the 6th Field Artillery Regiment, the 6th Engineer Regiment, the 6th Transport Regiment and the 4th Field Heavy Artillery Regiment, Akinaga's division consisted of 3,300 men. The previous November, the Australian II Corps under Lieutenant General Stanley Savige had taken over responsibility of the island from the US XIV Corps, who had been transferred to fight in the Philippines. Although incorrect, at the time the Allies believed that the Japanese forces on the island numbered around 17,500 men and while these forces were understrength, they were still considered to be capable of carrying out effective combat operations. In order to counter this, it was decided that the Australian II Corps‚Äîconsisting of Militia and Australian Imperial Force troops from the 3rd Division and the 11th and 23rd Brigades‚Äîwould go on the offensive and a three-pronged campaign was planned in the northern, central and southern sectors of the island. As a result, the Australian campaign on the island developed into three separate drives: in the north, it was planned that Japanese forces would be forced into the narrow Bonis Peninsula and contained; in the centre, the seizure of Pearl Ridge would give the Australians control of the east‚Äìwest thoroughfares and protection against further counterattacks, while also opening the way for a drive to the east coast; and the main campaign would take place in the south, where the bulk of the Japanese forces were concentrated. Consequently, on 21 January, Savige directed the 3rd Division under Major General William Bridgeford to take \\"swift and vigorous action\\" to destroy Japanese forces in southern Bougainville. The division's immediate task was to advance south to the Puriata, and send patrols across it. Savige considered that the Japanese division was \\"weak and off balance\\" due to casualties and disease as well as a shortage of supplies. Brigadier Raymond Monaghan's 29th Brigade had opened the campaign in the south in mid-December, crossing the Jaba River, before conducting a series of landings by barge along the coast of Empress Augusta Bay, outflanking the Tuju, Tavera, Adele and Hupai Rivers, in what became dubbed the \\"Battle of the Swamps\\" by the Australians. The fighting during this time resulted in 240 Japanese killed, and 148 Australian casualties. Monaghan was also relieved of his command. In late January, the 7th Brigade, under Brigadier John Field, which had been patrolling the Jaba River to protect the 29th Brigade's rear while they pushed south, was subsequently tasked to \\"take Mosigetta, clear the enemy from the Kupon‚ÄìNigitan‚ÄìSisiruai area, and patrol along the Puriata\\". Each of the brigade's three infantry battalions was marginally below full strength at the time, with frontages of between 600 and 700 personnel around the start of the battle. Prelude In late January, a company from the Australian 25th Infantry Battalion‚Äîunder Lieutenant Colonel John McKinna‚Äîsubsequently carried out an amphibious landing south of Motupena Point, on the Solomon Sea coast and had cleared towards Matsunkei. On 2 February, the battalion carried out another landing at Toko, and advanced northeast from there towards Batara, and then along the west bank of the Puriata, towards the Buin Road. Meanwhile, further to the east, the 9th Infantry Battalion was moved by truck from Torokina to the Jaba River and then moved by barge along the Empress Augusta Bay coast, landing at Mawaraka from where they advanced towards Mosigetta, and the 61st Infantry Battalion also proceeded towards there, setting off from the junction of the Jaba and Pagana Rivers while the 2/8th Commando Squadron provided flank security further to the east. Elements of the 1st New Guinea Infantry Battalion also conducted a landing on the coast, on the 25th Battalion's left flank, to the north of Toko, and advanced to Makaku and then towards Mosigetta. Men from the 61st Infantry Battalion patrol along the Mosigetta River on Bougainville in March 1945 in the lead up to the Battle of Slater's Knoll. On 4 March, a company from the 25th Infantry Battalion crossed the Puriata River southward‚Äîat the point where the Buin Road crossed‚Äîon a north-facing bend, later known as Galvin's Crossing. The following day the Japanese were forced off a small knoll close to the river and the road, about south of the crossing. On 6 March, Japanese shelling of the knoll wounded an Australian, Private Carl Slater, who held his post until relieved. He was the only casualty during this period, and the knoll was named after him. Throughout March, the 25th Infantry Battalion continued to expand its perimeter, to the north and south, along the Buin Road, while the 9th moved west from Mosigetta to link up with them and the 61st skirted east around Makapeka. By late March, though, heavy rain temporarily stopped the Australian advance, as the main road became impassable due to thick mud. Although the Japanese sporadically shelled the knoll during March, there were no further Australian casualties. The 25th Infantry Battalion, which had established its headquarters and main defensive position around the knoll, in front of the Puriata River, sent out patrols every day, and on 9 March, one of these reported having killed 10 Japanese soldiers without loss to itself. The Japanese also began making dawn attacks, in which light machine gunners would approach by stealth, set up and fire on the Australian positions, then retire to their own lines, away. As the advance was halted, the Australians began to expect a major attack in the area of the knoll. The Japanese launched a number of attacks on the Australians between 15 and 17 March. Under fire from three sides and in danger of being enveloped, on 19 March the Australians launched an attack of their own along the Buin Road, and although they had some success in clearing the forward Japanese positions, they then encountered a system of pillboxes and trenches around the Hatai Road junction. The 25th Infantry Battalion's commander, McKinna, ordered the two platoons led by Lieutenant Dick Jefferies to attack the pillboxes, supported by a section of machine guns, and several PIAT anti-tank weapons. A two-hour fire-fight and a bayonet charge followed. This attack was ultimately beaten back by the defenders with the loss of eight Australians killed and 14 wounded. A second attack was launched on 22 March. Supported by heavy artillery, mortars and machine guns, it proved successful, largely after the individual efforts of Corporal Reg Rattey, who single-handedly silenced several bunkers. As the Australians began to prepare for the next stage of the offensive, important intelligence confirmed that the Japanese were planning a large-scale counterattack in the area. Believing that the Australian forces in the area surrounding the knoll were limited to just 400 men and observing that the Australians had not had time to reorganise, the Japanese XVII Army commander‚ÄîLieutenant General Masatane Kanda‚Äîordered the 6th Division commander‚ÄîAkinaga‚Äîto delay the Australian advance towards the south. Akinaga assessed that a counterattack against the Australian forces at this point with the entire weight of his division might be successful at this time and consequently he gave the order for his division to begin an attack across the Puriata. Akinaga planned to commit 2,000 men to the assault, while 1,300 would be held back to act as ammunition carriers. According to Karl James, no detailed orders were produced for the attack and deliberate planning was hastily completed with little or no co-ordination between the attacking infantry regiments. In addition, to increase the size of the infantry force, troops from the field artillery regiment were quickly re-roled as riflemen. In the meantime, the Australians on Slater's Knoll, having been alerted to the possibility of a large-scale attack, began adjusting their defences. The soldiers cleared fields of fire and set out clear engagement areas to the north, northwest and south of the knoll, to allow maximum effectiveness of their supporting Vickers medium machine guns and Bren light machine guns. Barbed wire was laid out, and booby traps set. Battle Probing raids alt=A map of Bougainville Island, indicating the location of several key battles in the campaign The main attack was planned for 1 April, but as the various Japanese units moved into position, a number of minor probes were made by elements of the Japanese 6th Engineer Regiment in the Australian rear areas and along their line of communications. The first raid came on the night of 27/28 March, when a force of about 100 Japanese exploited a gap between the 25th Infantry Battalion's main defensive position and its 'B' Echelon‚Äîwhich included its transport and logistics elements and was protected by a company from the 61st Infantry Battalion‚Äîfixed bayonets and then assaulted the rear of the Australian perimeter. The Australians had been alerted to their approach after the communication line between the two positions had been cut, and when the attack began the men had already been roused and the weapons pits fully manned. As a result, the attack failed and was turned back. A number of Japanese survivors managed to dig-in near the perimeter and later fired upon the Australian clearing patrol that was sent out the following morning, as well as snipe at the company defending 'B' Echelon's position. Afterwards, the Australians counted 19 dead Japanese around their position, while they also managed to capture one of the wounded. Against this, the 25th Infantry Battalion had lost three killed and seven wounded. Another probe was made early on the morning of 28 March on the positions of the Australian 5th Field Battery, whose eight guns were located east of Toko, on the west bank of the Puriata River from where they could provide defensive fires in support of the 25th Infantry Battalion's main positions on the knoll. Shortly before dawn one of the booby traps that the Australians had set around their perimeter to provide early warning was set off and one of the sentries opened fire upon what he believed to be a Japanese probe. A short time later, a small section of Japanese stumbled into one of the forward positions and fire was exchanged. Later, as a team was sent out to disarm the remaining booby traps, this team was fired upon and sporadic fighting continued until midday. That evening, around 23:00, the 9th Infantry Battalion's rear echelon at Barara, along the Toko‚ÄìMosigetta‚ÄìBuin Road, came under attack. Under the command of the battalion second-in-command, and possessing only four Bren light machine guns for direct fire support, they were nevertheless able to hold off the initial attack. Following this, sporadic fighting continued into the early morning, when at 04:45 on 29 March a force of about 100 Japanese attacked the position supported by sustained machine gun and rifle fire. Rushing the Australian position with bayonets, they were beaten back by stiff defence and fell back from the position, leaving behind 23 dead but taking their wounded with them. Four Australians were wounded in this encounter. Throughout 29 March, the Japanese continued the tactic of using small-scale attacks to test the Australian defences and isolate the 25th Infantry Battalion's forward companies from its headquarters and rear. Over the course of the morning and into the afternoon, one of its companies was probed, while the headquarters also came under attack. The company from the 61st Infantry Battalion protecting the 25th Infantry Battalion's line of communications also came under attack from the 70 Japanese that were believed to be entrenched between the 'B' Echelon and the 25th's main positions, suffering two killed and two wounded. Later, it became clear to the Australians that the Japanese were preparing for a major attack against Slater's Knoll, following the capture of a Japanese sergeant who confirmed that the probes were, in the words of Gavin Long, the \\"prelude to a full-scale offensive\\". These probes intensified on 30 March, as one of the 25th Infantry Battalion's companies was strongly attacked by the Japanese. The Australian position had been weakened by having about a third of its strength out on patrol at the time of the attack. Unable to return to the perimeter while the company was under fire, they were forced to link up with one of the other companies further north. Meanwhile, the company was attacked four times throughout the day. The first three attacks were repulsed before the last attack came at 13:00, preceded by a heavy mortar bombardment. Twelve Japanese were killed in the attack, while one Australian was killed and two were missing in action. Nevertheless, the Australian position had been made untenable and they were forced to withdraw and link up with the company to the north. In doing so they left behind three mortars and a quantity of ammunition which the Japanese later brought into action against them. alt=Soldiers in combat equipment carrying rifles advance along a dirt road in front of a tank Communications between the brigade and battalion headquarters and the forward company positions broke down at this stage and runners had to be dispatched to pass a message asking for artillery support. Meanwhile, the supply situation for the Australians also became desperate as they had consumed all of their rations and had run out of water. The water situation was solved by digging a well within the perimeter, but it became clear that reinforcements were required. The Australian divisional commander, Bridgeford, subsequently placed a squadron of Matilda tanks under Major Kenneth Arnott from the 2/4th Armoured Regiment at the 7th Brigade commander's disposal, and over the course of the day these tanks were brought up towards the 25th's position from Toko where they had been put ashore from landing craft. Engineers were used to bridge a number of creeks and streams, while bulldozers were also employed to improve the terrain or to pull the tanks along when they were unable to move under their own power. This was the first time tanks had been used in the campaign and the going was slow. By 19:00 on 30 March they reached the 'B' Echelon position. Early on 31 March the tanks moved up to the battalion headquarters on Slater's Knoll where they were escorted by a platoon from the headquarters company and moved out again, once again using bulldozers to improve the ground in front of them. Just as they did, the Japanese launched an attack on one of the isolated companies. When they were from the forward positions, the infantry deployed to the left and right of the tanks and they began their advance to contact, arriving just in time to help defeat the Japanese attack. As the forward companies began to move back towards the main defensive position, jeeps were sent up to collect the wounded while McKinna led a force of two platoons and two tanks out to the perimeter at the Hatai junction. There they were able to reclaim the mortars that had earlier been abandoned and destroyed them so that they could not be used against the Australians again, but the jeeps carrying the wounded ran into a Japanese ambush in which five Australians were killed. McKinna then organised a quick counterattack, taking a force up the road along with three tanks and subsequently attacking the ambushing force, killing 11, before forming a harbour around the tanks for the night. First major assault The next morning, 1 April, the Australians extended across the Kero Creek and advanced north to the Puriata where they established a perimeter south of Slater's Knoll. Around 12:00, the Japanese 6th Field Artillery Regiment, whose gunners had been converted to the role of infantry, set up a form-up position to the front of the Australian company holding the perimeter to the south of Slater's Knoll at a location the Japanese called Pain, which lay along the Buin Road. Before the attack could be launched, the Australians detected the movement of the Japanese and began firing upon them. Shortly after 12:40, the Japanese gunners launched their assault. Firing their weapons from the hip, they rushed the Australian position, pushing the defenders back, leaving dead and wounded behind. That evening, the Australians launched a series of determined counterattacks in order to re-establish contact between Slater's Knoll and the forward companies, however, these were turned back. alt=A location map, depicting a portion of the western coast of Bougainville, showing the relative position of Slater's Knoll, the Buin Road and several other key locations Meanwhile, the Japanese 23rd Infantry Regiment, which had advanced on the right flank from Barara attempted to move on Slater's Knoll from the north. Finding its way blocked by wire obstacles and lacking the equipment necessary to remove them, it was forced to halt its advance and cover the flank of Colonel Toyoji Muta's 13th Infantry Regiment, which was attempting to launch an assault across the Puriata. At this point, the river was about across and deep, while the opposite bank was about high. The crossing began at 03:00 on 1 April, and the three battalions made heavy work of it. When they were halfway across, the two forward battalions were spotted by the Australians in the moonlight and engaged with machine gun and rifle fire. The Japanese quickly deployed and attempted to launch an attack; however, in the confusion the 1st Battalion, 23rd Infantry Regiment was cut off from the rest of the assault force. As daylight came, the Australians were able to call down mortar fire on the Japanese, causing considerable casualties. Running low on ammunition and having suffered considerable losses, the 23rd Infantry were forced to withdraw. The 1st Battalion remained cut off until the evening of 1 April, when it was able to re-establish contact with the other two battalions and report to the divisional commander that the attack had been unsuccessful. Lull in the battle and secondary attack On 2 April, the Japanese divisional commander, Akinaga, called the 13th and 23rd Infantry Regiments back across the Puriata, to a position south-west of the Pain feature. At this point, the decision was made to launch a fresh attack aimed at taking Slater's Knoll and eliminating the Australian forces in the area surrounding the Puriata ford. The attack was scheduled for 5 April, and over the course of the following three days, contact was minimal. In this time, there were a few minor skirmishes, and small groups of Japanese were seen by the Australians around Barara, Slater's Knoll and Mosigetta. As further intelligence reports came in, it became clear to the Australian commanders that the Japanese were about to deliver the main attack. On the night of 4/5 April, the Japanese heavily shelled the Australian artillery battery, while communications between brigade headquarters and the 25th Infantry Battalion headquarters were severed, as were the lines from the 25th Infantry Battalion's headquarters to its forward companies. Suspecting that the attack was about to commence, runners were sent and the men defending Slater's Knoll, now consisting of a force of only 129 men from 'B' Company, stood-to. At 05:00 on 5 April, the Japanese launched an attack from the north. This was followed almost simultaneously by a stronger attack from the south- west. For the next 80 minutes, 900‚Äì1,100 Japanese from the 13th and 23rd Infantry Regiments attacked the small Australian force in waves. They overwhelmed the Australian forward positions, but finding their way blocked by wire obstacles and lacking any equipment to deal with them the Japanese attack stalled. Quickly, the situation was turned back in favour of the Australians, and the Japanese were cut down by heavy defensive artillery fire and by well- sited machine guns. A further attack was launched by a smaller force along the Buin Road and aimed at two of the forward companies positioned there. This attack was beaten back also. After regrouping, the surviving members of the 13th Infantry Regiment began preparing for a final charge, determined to fight to the last man. Their commander, Colonel Muta, in a final act of defiance wrapped his unit's banner around his waist and armed himself with a grenade with which to blow himself up during the assault. Elsewhere, the remaining officers of the 23rd Infantry made a pact to hurl themselves against the Australians one last time in a suicidal charge. Nevertheless, Akinaga, realising that further assaults were futile, finally dispatched the order to cancel the attack. At around 08:30, the Australians realised that the Japanese had decided that they had had enough. Just after midday, two tanks were dispatched from the 'B' Echelon perimeter, escorted by a company from the 61st Infantry Battalion, arriving on the knoll by 13:45 where they were used as fire support as the Australians began to carry out mopping up operations, flushing out small groups of survivors all around the position. Aftermath The day after the final Japanese assault on the knoll, 292 dead Japanese were counted around 'B' Company's perimeter. In total, over the course of the battle, the Australians counted 620 Japanese killed, and estimated that another 1,000 had probably been wounded. Information obtained from captured Japanese clarified that the Australians had come up against a force of at least 2,400 troops. The commander of the 23rd Infantry Regiment, Lieutenant Colonel Kawano Koji, was among the dead, as was a senior divisional staff officer, Lieutenant Colonel Honda Matsuo. Four wounded Japanese were also taken prisoner of war. Casualties for the Australians included 10 officers and 179 other ranks killed or wounded, while there had been a further 81 Australians evacuated due to non-combat related issues. Wartime Japanese casualty estimates vary from these figures, though, claiming to have killed 1,800 Australians, while placing their own losses at 280 killed and 320 wounded. Long argues that these figures are problematic, as based upon the same report, the Japanese believed that there were only 400 Australians in the region during the battle, and yet they claimed to have killed almost five times that number. alt=Soldiers burying dead in a large pit The result of the battle had a profound effect on the Japanese commanders. According to James, Kanda had been \\"so certain of victory...[he]...had not developed any plans for...subsequent activities\\". After the battle, the Japanese forces in the area pulled back to the Hongorai River, where they were reorganised due to the heavy losses, with several infantry, engineer and artillery units being amalgamated. Lacking food, suffering the effects of disease, and isolated from home, morale amongst the Japanese troops fell heavily, with many realising that the war was lost. There was an increase in desertions at this time, although the vast majority continued to fight, if only because they were under orders to do so. Operationally, the battle proved to the Australian high command how effective armour could be when used in close co-operation with infantry and in protecting the lines of communication. The use of machine gun carriers to carry out the wounded had also been quite effective. While the Japanese soldiers and officers on the ground fought bravely, continuing the assault even when it was clear it had failed, ultimately the battle proved to be a decisive Australian victory; however, James notes that poor planning and unreliable communications had also contributed to the result. Long goes on to argue that if the Japanese commander had been more flexible in his tactics, the result might have been different. The Australian right flank had been vulnerable, but Akinaga did not exploit this opportunity. There were tactical deficiencies as well, particularly the predictability of cutting Australian signals lines just before an attack and bunching together in tight groups during an assault, allowing the Australians to take full toll with their machine guns. The Australian commander of the 25th Infantry Battalion, McKinna, had spread his companies out effectively and went forward to direct the fighting at several points. Fields of fire had been cleared, perimeters set and patrolling had been maintained. Nevertheless, the Australians had also failed to seize opportunities as they arose, for after the battle they did not follow up their success immediately. After the failure of the final assault, the Japanese had possessed no forces in the immediate vicinity that would have been capable of resisting any follow up forces that the Australians might have been able to bring up, and it is possible that an advance could have been carried all the way to the Hongorai River. As it was, however, the Australian line of supply was stretched and it was necessary for a pause before the advance could continue in earnest. In the days immediately after the battle, the Australians continued to carry out patrolling operations around the knoll. On 7 April, a patrol from the 9th Infantry Battalion clashed with a Japanese force of about 30 men and in the ensuing engagement four Japanese were killed, while a patrol from the 61st Infantry Battalion on 8 April killed another five. On 13 April, the order was given that the 7th Brigade would be gradually withdrawn and relieved by the 15th. Shortly afterwards, the 58th/59th Infantry Battalion replaced the 25th in occupation of the knoll, while the 24th Infantry Battalion resumed the advance along the Buin Road on 17 April, subsequently taking part in the fighting along the Hongorai River. The 9th Infantry Battalion, however, was not withdrawn immediately, and remained in the northern area until it handed over to the 57th/60th Infantry Battalion in early May. The fighting on Bougainville continued throughout April as the Japanese resisted the Australian advance and went on until July when the fighting petered out due to heavy rain and flooding. After the war, the battle honour of \\"Slater's Knoll\\" was awarded to the 25th Infantry Battalion and the 2/4th Armoured Regiment. Neither the 9th or 61st Infantry Battalions were similarly credited, although according to Gordon Maitland there seems to be no explanation as to why. For his actions during the attack on the Japanese pillboxes on 22 March, Rattey later received the Victoria Cross. Initially, his battalion commander, McKinna, had nominated him for the lesser Distinguished Conduct Medal, but on review by Field, the brigade commander, the nomination was elevated. It was subsequently announced in the London Gazette in July 1945.

The lake is accessible from Harper Lake Road, which runs north off of State Route 58 midway between Boron and Barstow.  General  Lake Harper during its highstand reached an elevation of above sea level, had a surface area of and was inhabited by cyprinid minnow, molluscs and ostracods. Ostracods found in Lake Harper are species of Candona, Cypridopsis, Heterocypris and Limnocythere. These species indicate a freshwater lake with seasonal inflow and some shallower environments. An elongated peninsula jutted into the lake from the western shore and smaller peninsulas existed on the northern and southern shores towards the eastern side of the lake. Blue clays in boreholes and fine grained mud and sand on the former shores testify to the existence of a lake there. History The highest shorelines are dated to 24,400 ¬± 2,190 and 25,000 ¬± 310 radiocarbon years ago; further dates are 40,460 ¬± 550 and 33,830 ¬± 340 calibrated radiocarbon years ago. Lake Harper was the terminal lake for the Mojave River between 40,000 and 45,000 years before present, which is also considered to be the time of highstand of the lake; the river alternatively discharged into this lake and into Lake Manix farther downstream. The timespan where the Mojave River flowed into Harper Lake began 575,000 - 475,000 years ago when the river escaped the Victorville area and entered Harper Lake until 500,000 years ago when it started alternating between Lake Manix and Lake Harper. The last time that the Mojave River reached Lake Harper was between 25,000 and 20,000 years before present, but this finding was later considered to be doubtful. Harper Lake contained water and a natural marsh into the early 20th century when agricultural development began to deplete the groundwater that sustained its level. The lake and marsh wetlands attracted large numbers of migrating birds and supported a variety of resident desert wildlife in the oasis habitat. Sustained by a small amount of surface runoff from nearby farms, only the southwest corner of the reduced lake remained marshland. Into the early 1990s, the wildlife was still supported by the remnant habitat. Presently, Lake Harper forms a playa at an elevation of above sea level. It features a dry climate with desert scrub vegetation surrounding the lake bed. Neogene alluvial fans form much of the surrounding and overlie older basalts. Decline The lake became dry and the marsh died in the late 1990s after the alfalfa farm next to the lake shut down and the migrating and resident wildlife dropped. When a new solar power plant was built just to the west of the lake, it needed to pump groundwater to the lake. However, this never occurred because the company that owned the plant went bankrupt. After the bankruptcy was resolved, the concerns of Edwards Air Force Base regarding bird strikes and other bureaucratic issues halted restoration progress. Restoration Meanwhile, Luz Solar Partners and NextEra Energy Resources, the new owners of the Solar Energy Generating Systems power plant, delivered water to the lake as requested by the Bureau of Land Management-BLM through an informal agreement. In 2005, a new petition was filed by Friends of Harper Lake with the BLM and California Energy Commission, which approved the amendments to the project. Up to of water per year will be managed by the BLM and transferred to the lake as part of the mitigation agreement for solar field expansion. Other events On March 25, 2009, an F-22 Raptor crashed on the lakebed, resulting in the death of a Lockheed Martin test pilot.

It is the equivalent of a steering wheel for vehicles and vessels, but is most often directly mechanically linked to a pivoting front wheel via a stem which in turn attaches it to the fork. Besides steering, handlebars also often support a portion of the rider's weight, depending on their riding position, and provide a convenient mounting place for brake levers, shift levers, cyclocomputers, bells, etc. History Ni√©pce The dandy horse, or draisienne, invented by Karl Drais and the first vehicle with two wheels arranged in tandem, was controlled by a bar connected to the front steering mechanism and held by the riders' two hands. The first handlebars were solid bars of steel or wood, depending on the manufacturer. Curved, moustache-shaped, drop handlebars became popular in the 1920s and were invented by Percy Stenton of Ardwick, Manchester. Whatton bars were developed in attempt to improve the safety of penny-farthings. Handlebars made of wood, instead of steel, were used on safety bicycles to reduce weight in the 1890s. Although aluminum had been used to make bicycles as early as 1935, it was considered unsafe for handlebars until Cinelli produced them in 1963. Types of handlebar Handlebars come in a variety of types designed for particular types of riding. Drop Conventional drop handlebars with harlequin cloth tape wrapping Typical drop handlebars feature a straight central section attached to the stem, with each end curving first forwards and down, and then back towards the rider at a lower position. These are a very popular type of handlebar, and their exact shape and purpose leads them to be further categorised as follows. ;Standard These classic racing handlebars, as used on road or track bicycles. The bars are designed with three basic parameters; reach, drop and width. They can be further classified into three categories: classic, typically having a long reach and a deep drop, compact, featuring shorter reach and a shallow drop, and ergo or anatomic, described below. Drop bars may have one or two longitudinal indentations so that the brake and shift cables protrude less when they are wrapped under the bar tape. They may also have a flattened top section. ;Track \\"Track\\" style bars with large-radius curve Track drop bars are a variation of bars designed for the typical riding positions of track bicycle racers. Track drops are characterized by large, sweeping ramps, effectively precluding the top and brake hood hand positions, but promoting the rider's use of the ends, or \\"hooks\\". Track bars are designed for use without brake levers, but recently experienced a surge in popularity on use with fixed gear bikes, and as such have been adapted to fit levers and hand positions. ;Ergo or anatomic The shape of the drop may be a simple, traditional curve, or it can have a flat spot (straight section) which some riders find to be more comfortable for their hands. These bars may be described as ergo or anatomic. Some manufacturers have relegated the term anatomic to this curvature shape, while adopting the term ergo to instead describe non-cylindrical tubing cross-sections on the upper flat portion of the bar, intended to be more comfortable when riding in the upright position. ;Randonneur Drop bars that rise slightly from the center in a shallow U, and the drop portion of the bars is set wider than the curve at the top. Designed to be slightly more comfortable than a straight drop bar for bicycles used in Audax riding. ;Drop-in At one time, manufactures and racers experimented with drop-in bars that had an additional extension in toward the head tube at the rear end of the drops. This was intended to offer an even more aerodynamic position, due to low and narrow placement of the hands, than just the drops, while still remaining legal for mass-start races. Their popularity has since waned. ;Dirt Drop Primarily for riding off-road or on dirt, these handlebars are flared out at the ends of the handlebar. This style was used in the 1980s during the early period of mountain biking. Initially the flared portion in these handlebars was bent by hand, but now are available from manufacturers such as Salsa Cycles and SOMA Fabrications. Bullhorn Cut down drop bars repurposed as bullhorn handlebars Bullhorn (or pursuit) handlebars, curve up and forward. They are often paired with dedicated clip-on triathlon bars when used on the road (see above), and are also popular by themselves on track, single-speed, and fixed-gear bicycles. This style of handlebar is named after the discipline of track racing where it was originally used, and has the common nickname of \\"bullhorn bars\\" for their appearance, especially when the rider's body position is fully extended to lean forward and maintain control of the bicycle. Improvised bullhorn bars may be constructed simply by cutting the drops off drop bars and then mounting them upside down so that the remaining start of the drop provides a slight upward hook for resting the hands, although this does not provide as much forward extension (reach) or lowering (if desired, normally for time-trial based use) as purpose made bullhorns. These are sometimes called \\"flopped and chopped\\" or \\"flipped and clipped\\" bars, and if this is to be done, care should be taken to properly remove the sharp edges from the cuts, and to properly tape and plug the bar ends for safety purposes. Bullmoose The bullmoose style was common on early mountain bikes. The stem and bars are a single unit and where the single top section of the stem would be, there are instead 2 bars joined at the quill to the rear and connected to the conventional handlebar section in the front, at two off-center locations, forming a triangle. This type of handlebar is usually very large, allowing for an easy breath intake under stress. However, being heavier than contemporary flat or riser bars and being less customizeable in height and distance from the body of the rider, they progressively disappeared. Flat Flat bars are the standard handlebars equipped on mountain bikes, hybrids, and recently on fixed-gear bicycles and flat bar road bikes. A flat bar is a nearly-straight tube, in most cases slightly bent toward the rider. Many penny-farthings and early safety bicycles had flat handlebars. The angle between the slightly swept-back ends of the handlebar and the axis of the stem clamp is known as the sweep angle. Riser Riser handlebars on a mountain bike A riser is a variation of the flat bar in which the outer sections of the bars rise from the center clamp area by about 15 to 50 mm. Both flat and riser bars may be appended with bar ends, providing more hand positions. Triathlon or aero bars Triathlon bars or aerobars include various styles of aerodynamic handlebars for racing bicycles and particularly time trial bicycles. Included are narrow, bolt-on extensions that draw the body forward into a tucked position, pursuit bars that spread the arms of the rider but drops the torso into a slightly lower position, and integrated units that combine elements of both designs. Using aero bars may allow a rider to reduce time on a 40 km time trial by 90 seconds.Kyle CR. (1989). ‚ÄúThe Aerodynamics of Helmet and Handlebars.‚Äù Cycling Sci. 1: 22-25 Triathlon bars are commonly used in triathlons and time trial events on road and track. However, they are illegal in most mass start road races or any other event where drafting is permitted because, while aerodynamically advantageous, they tend to draw the hands away from brakes, make the rider slightly more unstable on the bike, and can be dangerous in the event of an accident. Further, they are not useful in sprints or shorter climbs where power is of greater importance than aerodynamics. Specialized shift levers (known as bar-end shifters) do exist that can be installed on some triathlon bars so that they can be reached without moving the hands from the aerodynamic position. The complementary brake levers in this handlebar configuration are placed in the ends of the accompanying pursuit bars. Aero bars are a recent addition to road racing time trials, with Greg LeMond first using them in the 1989 Tour de France. In a controversial time trial on the final day, LeMond used them to beat yellow jersey wearer Laurent Fignon by 58 seconds, changing a 50-second deficit into an 8-second lead. Fignon protested at the use of these bars but was unsuccessful. BMX BMX style bars with cross brace BMX style handlebars, as used on BMX bicycles, have more rise than straight bars and usually have a cross brace to provide rigidity and strength. Upright or North Road North Road handlebars One of the oldest type of handlebars, and perhaps the most ubiquitous for town bikes, this type of bar was named after the North Road Cycling Club in London and then used on three- speed and single speed Raleighs, Schwinns, and other three-speed bikes well into the 1980s, as well as various European utility bikes and roadsters. They are also known as \\"townie\\", or \\"tourist\\" bars. North Road bars are more or less swept back toward the rider; in extreme cases each grip ends nearly parallel to the other and the bike's frame. They have recently enjoyed a resurgence in popularity on some hybrid bicycles, city bikes, and comfort models. North Road bars can easily be inverted to give an approximate ~4 inch amount of drop when a more aggressive riding posture or a sporty look is desired. Porteur Porteur bars are designed to accommodate front-mounted racks or baskets in order to haul cargo and are usually found on dedicated porteur bicycles. The curve is usually almost flat in the center portion, then sweeps backwards towards the rider with different shapes, and with a slight drop in some cases. Cruiser Cruiser handlebars, as used on cruiser bicycles, tend to be long and slope towards the rear of the bicycle so that the rider can sit upright. Condorino Condorino type handlebar by Legnano, Italy, circa 1960 The condorino bar is bent slightly less than 90¬∞ onward, and then 90¬∞ outward with a sharp angle. It has no rise and it's much narrower than normal town bikes' bars. It was diffused mostly in Italy from the 1950s onwards, and was marketed to customers wanting a sporty looking bicycle that could still be used for general purpose (going to work, etc.) in years in which a specialized racing bicycle was not affordable by most people. It progressively lost popularity when road racing bikes became common, and by the early 1980s it was out of production. Whatton Whatton bars loop behind the legs of penny-farthing riders so that they can still keep their feet on the pedals and also be able to leap feet-first forward off the machine. These are also used on recumbent bicycles for under-seat steering. Touring or trekking Trekking or \\"Butterfly\\" handlebars with foam rubber coverings Sometimes referred to as \\"butterfly\\" bars, these are commonly encountered in continental Europe. They typically consist of a broken figure- of-eight arrangement mounted horizontally on the stem. This style of bar allows the rider to remain relatively upright while at the same time providing a wide range of hand positions for comfort on long duration rides. A variation of the Butterfly bar is fitted to 'P-type' Brompton folding bicycles. It differs from other Butterfly bars in that it is fitted vertically rather than horizontally. Moustache A moustache handlebar as seen from the top of the bike Moustache handlebars curve forward from the stem and then back towards the rider. This style was designed in the early 90s by Grant Petersen for the Bridgestone XO-1, based on the semi-drop bars used by schoolchildren in Japan. Ape hangers Ape hangers Ape hanger handlebars rise in a steep U-shape from the base, so that the rider's hands rest above waist-level. This style of bicycle handlebar became very popular in the 1960s after the introduction of wheelie bikes such as the Schwinn Sting-Ray, Raleigh Chopper, and other highly stylized youth bicycles that imitated the appearance of drag- racing or chopper motorcycles of the day. Regulations adopted in 1978 under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act limited the maximum height of manufacturer-installed handlebars to 16 inches (40.64 cm) above the lowest seat setting; European Union safety regulations use a similar limit of 40cm. Various U.S. states have regulations that vary from 15 to 30 inches above seat height, or shoulder or eye height; some have no restrictions. Ostensibly these regulations are for safety, though some commentators believe these laws are to allow police to have an excuse to pull over motorcyclists suspected to be part of an illegal gang. The ape hanger style remained common in the US through the mid-1980s, and is still frequently seen on lowrider bicycles. Recumbent recumbent Recumbent bicycles, due to their wide variety, are often equipped with handlebars seen nowhere else. These include handlebars with a very far reach, similar to ape hangers (see above) but mounted less vertically, and handlebars designed for under-seat steering, called Whatton bars. Design Handlebar design is a trade-off between several desirable qualities: Design goals The design goals of handlebars varies depending on the intended use of the bicycle. Common to all bicycles: * Providing the necessary leverage to steer the bicycle. * Proper positioning of the rider's hands according to the purpose and style of the bicycle. * Providing a mounting platform for brake and gear levers as well as various accessories. Racing/touring and triathlon bars have additional goals: * Enabling the rider to assume an aerodynamic position. * Enabling the rider to change hand and body positions during long rides, preventing fatigue. * Enabling aerodynamic routing of brake/gear cables. Mountain bike handlebar design goals have less focus on aerodynamics, more on negotiating terrain: * Providing enough control to maneuver the front of the bicycle over obstacles. * Being strong enough to withstand the extra forces generated in some activities/crashes. * Optionally: not significantly increasing vehicle weight. BMX and dirt-jump bike bars have similar needs to mountain bikes, with the added incentive of allowing even finer control, such as specific handling during the time the bike is airborne or during certain maneuvers. Materials Handlebars are most commonly made of aluminium alloys, but are also often made from steel, carbon fiber or titanium. Sizes There are several size parameters to consider when choosing a handlebar: Width Drop bars come in a variety of widths from . Usually a rider will pick a bar that approximately matches their shoulder width so that their arms can be approximately parallel. The width is measured at the end of the drop section but the exact method varies from manufacturer to manufacturer. Some measure from outside edge to outside edge (e.g., Deda, ITM, TTT, Pinarello Most) whereas others measure from center to center (e.g., Cinelli, Profile Design, Ritchey, Salsa).bicycling.com Bicycling Magazine: Choosing the right handlebar width. The figure returned by measuring outside to outside tends to be greater than measuring center to center for the same handlebar. Stem clamp diameter Care is needed when choosing a handlebar to match a stem, or vice versa, as there are several standards. The ISO standard for the stem clamping area of a handlebar is , which is used on mountain bikes and many Japanese-made road handlebars. However, the Italian unofficial standard is . There are also intermediate sizes such as that try to achieve compatibility with either an ISO or Italian stem, and the old Cinelli- specific size of . In practice, many modern stems with removable faceplates are quite accommodating of slight differences in handlebar clamp size, but the older type of stem with a single pinch bolt must be accurately matched. In the days of quill stems, a road stem was clearly identifiable from its \\"7\\" shape, but nowadays it can be hard to tell the difference between a \\"road\\" () and \\"MTB\\" () stem. Manufacturers frequently omit the clamp size from advertising or packaging. A new standard is an \\"oversize\\" or clamp for both MTB and road bars. This is popular on mountain bikes, especially those with a focus on \\"all mountain\\" and \\"downhill\\" activities, as the stem and handlebars can be both stiffer and lighter. This clamp diameter is taking over from the previous mix of sizes on road bicycles with drop-bars. On these stems, standard brake levers can be used as it is only the central section that is oversized although other accessories that mount near the stem also need to be oversized to fit (some brackets are adjustable). Shims are available to fit either a or bar to a stem, so many new models of stems are oversize-only. In 2012 bar manufacturer Easton also launched the size for bars and stems. This is specifically developed for high load applications such as downhilling. Easton are claiming further increases in strength and stiffness while reducing weight. BMX style handlebars require a clamp diameter of and are therefore incompatible with any non-BMX specific stem. Lever clamp and grip diameter In addition to the stem clamp area, the shifter and/or brake lever and grip area on a bar can have several different diameters. For traditional road and mountain handlebars, these diameters are standard and so there has historically been little confusion except when mixing road and mountain components. However, in recent years there have been cross-over bar types that do not fall into one category or the other, and which can conceivably use either type of shifter, brake lever or grip (an example is the upright style bar). For this reason, certain handlebars are now available in multiple sizes related to the shifter or brake lever clamp diameter. Standard road drop handlebars (including track, cyclocross and touring bars) use a grip/lever diameter, which is matched only to road bike type shifters or brake levers. This diameter is usually not important for grips since these bars most often are wrapped in tape. An exception are one-piece track grips, which are sized to fit the bar diameter (and, therefore, would not fit a mountain bike handlebar). Cyclocross brake levers are sized to fit drop style bars, and would also not fit a mountain bike handlebar. The other common lever/grip size is used for mountain and city handlebars, including flat bars, riser bars, some porteur bars, etc. On these bars the lever and grip areas have a diameter. Hence, thumb shift levers, grip type shifters, MTB brake levers and Rapidfire type shifters will only fit on this smaller diameter - none could fit on a road or cyclocross bar. Handlebar coverings Handlebars usually have tape or grips to provide grip and comfort. In general, handlebars which have one riding position have grips, and handlebars which provide several use tape. Tape There are many types of handlebar tape: *Polyurethane tape, introduced in the last few years, provides cushioning. *Composite rubber tape *Cork tape, padded tape, provides cushioning but less durable. *Bike ribbon, plastic padded tape with smooth waterproof surface. * Benotto \\"Cello-Tape\\", made from plastic, popular in the 1970s and 1980s. Compared with other types of handlebar tape it is relatively thin and is unpadded; it does not provide any cushioning from road vibrations. However it is long lasting, does not absorb water, was available in a vast range of colors and stays clean. Similar types of \\"shiny tape\\" exist. *Cotton tape, unpadded woven cotton tape with adhesive backing, similar to twill tape. *Leather wrap, for example by Brooks England *An inner tube can be cut and wrapped as well *A foam rubber tube has been used on inexpensive bikes. Tape can be applied in several ways, either wrapped from the ends towards the stem or starting near the stem and wrapped towards the ends. The tape is usually held in place at the ends with the bar- end plugs. The other end of the tape can be held in place with adhesive tape, usually electrical insulation tape or, if started near the stem, by first wrapping a few turns towards the stem before reversing direction to anchor it. A figure-eight can be made around the brake lever clamp to completely cover the bar, or a small, separate piece of tape can be place on the back side to cover the small v-shaped section that might otherwise be left bare. Strips of bar gel may optionally be applied to the handlebars prior to applying the tape in order to reduce vibration transmission and increase comfort. Grips Combined ergonomic grip and bar end Grips are usually made of firm or soft plastic, foam, gel, or sometimes leather, depending on expected use or desired price. They may be simply smooth and round or molded to fit the shape of a human hand better. Foam grips can be applied by submerging them under water and then inflate them with air while massaging them onto the handlebar. A quick way of fitting foam grips is to spray the ends of the bars liberally with hair spray and then slide on the grips and adjust their rotation quickly; leaving them alone, the hair spray will soon fix them in position. Plastic grips can be heated in water and punched onto the handlebar. Finally, a small amount of isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol may be applied to the bar surface during removal or installation of grips in order to provide lubrication, which when allowed to dry, leaves no residue. Plugs Handlebars with open ends should have handlebar plugs fitted in the open ends for safety reasons. These can be made of metal, usually steel, or plastic. Without them, the end of the bar can cause serious injury upon hard impact with soft tissue. Plugs are also required by competitive cycling governing bodies. Bar ends Single (left) bar end Pair of bar ends In cycling, bar ends are extensions typically fitted to the ends of straight handlebars. They extend away from the handlebars and allow the rider to vary the type of grip and posture that they use during a ride. They are especially effective when climbing out of the saddle, because they increase leverage. Bar ends can also improve comfort for the rider due to the neutral position of the hands (palms inward) which places marginally less stress upon the musculature, and by providing more than one place to rest hands on a long journey. Some handlebars have bar ends welded onto them but most are clamped to the end of the bar. They are available in many shapes and sizes, such as stubby models that are around 100 mm in length to ones that curve around so as to provide even more hand positions. It is also possible to purchase combined ergonomic hand grips with integrated bar-ends. Bar ends were very popular on mountain bikes from the early 1990s until the late 1990s, when upswept \\"riser bars\\" came back into fashion; the combination of riser bars and bar ends is rarely seen. Pair of full curve bar ends Bar ends can prove troublesome when negotiating twisty tracks between trees as they may hook around branches and cause a crash. They also afford some protection to a rider's hands in a fall or crash. However, by moving the hands further from the brake levers, they can increase the time it takes to stop a bicycle. Use of bar ends is forbidden by road racing regulatory bodies. Accidents can easily be caused by hooking other riders' handlebars during tight bunch-riding and additionally bar ends may cause severe injuries during collisions that not infrequently occur in that discipline.

The conservation and restoration of textiles refers to the processes by which textiles are cared for and maintained to be preserved from future damage. The field falls under the category of art conservation as well as library preservation, depending on the type of collection. In this case, the concept of textile preservation applies to a wide range of artifacts, including tapestries, carpets, quilts, clothing, flags and curtains, as well as objects which ‚Äò‚Äôcontain‚Äô‚Äô textiles, such as upholstered furniture, dolls, and accessories such as fans, parasols, gloves and hats or bonnets. Many of these artifacts require specialized care, often by a professional conservator. Collections Historic textile collections can largely be divided into three categories: museums, historic societies/locations, and private collections. The needs of each of these locations will vary. A private collection, for instance, is less likely to have as high a traffic flow as a museum, and may thus be able to take preservation steps that a working museum cannot (such as keeping lights to a minimum for longer periods of time). The different venues may also have different problems that arise, such as the fact that many historic homes do not have climate control, and rely strongly on natural light to display their furnishings, both of which may contribute to textile decay. Environment Deterioration and discoloration due to poor storage on a crocheted linen collar of the 1920s or 1930s. The chief cause for decay in textiles is almost always the environment in which they are stored. Light, temperature, and humidity can all contribute to a textile's health or deterioration, depending on their intensity. Additionally, pests, chemicals, and pollutants may also cause damage to an antique fabric. Airborne chemicals, such as smog or cigarette smoke are also harmful to the textiles, and should be avoided if at all possible: high-efficiency air filters should be installed throughout the building to reduce the presence of airborne chemicals that may stain, discolor, or weaken fabrics. Light Light can have a variety of effects on textiles over time. In some cases, it may contribute to fading or discoloration, but of more concern is the damage which the fibers may suffer under prolonged exposure to non-visible light, such as ultraviolet and infrared lighting. Ideally, textiles should be stored or displayed in as little light as possible, and preferably in total darkness.Putnam and Finch 26 However, as this is impractical for display and care of the piece, knowing the limits of lighting as well as the safest amounts of lighting, become important. Natural light is the most common source of ultraviolet light, and as such, care should be taken to avoid exposure to direct sunlight at all costs, and indirect sunlight whenever possible. This may mean storing or displaying textiles in an area without windows, or with blackout curtains, which can be pulled whenever the room is not in use. If a room relies on natural light, UV screens or coatings can be applied to the windows to block harmful rays while still allowing light to pass through. These filters should be checked periodically, however, as they have a limited lifespan and may need to be replaced every few years.Mailand 7 Fluorescent and halogen-produced light can also produce large amounts of UV radiation, though filters which fit over the bulbs are available to limit the damaging light.Mailand and Alig 21 These filters will need to be replaced when the bulbs are changed, so maintenance staff should be aware of them and their use. One advantage of fluorescent lights is that they produce little heat, which may also be harmful to textiles. Incandescent lights produce a large amount of heat in addition to large quantities of infrared radiation, which is likewise damaging to the fibers in antique textiles. If incandescent lights must be used, they should be placed far enough away from display cases that their heat does not affect the contents.Mailand and Alig 21-22 In the case of particularly delicate textiles, display organizers might consider motion-activated or timed lighting, or lighting controlled though a visitor-activated switch, which would allow the textiles to remain in darkness when they are not under view.Mailand and Alig 23 All textiles should be displayed on a rotating schedule, allowing them a few months of display, then the rest of the year in dark storage, to prolong their life. Climate embroidered Victorian altar frontal, Berkshire, England. Heat and humidity can both contribute and a textile's deterioration. However, excessive dryness may also cause damage, especially to elastic fibers, such as wool, which rely on some amount of moisture to maintain their flexibility (Putnam and Finch). Additionally, temperature and humidity should be kept as constant as possible; changes in either of these may cause the textile fibers to expand and contract, which, over time, can also cause damage and deterioration to the textile. For this reason, both storage and display areas should be fitted with monitoring equipment to gauge the temperature and humidity of rooms, display cases, enclosed storage facilities, and work areas. Ideally, temperature should be kept around 70 degrees Fahrenheit,Fahey though some slight fluctuation in either direction is permissible, as long as it occurs gradually.Mailand 6 For instance, temperature may be slightly lower in winter to save energy costs, but the change should be effected slowly, so as not to place the fibers under undue stress. As for humidity, the preservationist or conservator should aim for a relative humidity of 50%, though, as with temperature, some small fluctuation is allowable, as long as it occurs gradually (Mailand). In enclosed display or storage cases, humidity can be somewhat maintained through the use of silica gel crystals. These crystals should not be placed in contact with the textiles, but may be placed in breathable muslin bags and hung inside the case to maintain a constant humidity; they should be monitored periodically, however, to be sure that they are working. In areas where climate control is unavailable (such as in historic buildings), the conservator can still moderate the temperature and relative humidity through use of fans, humidifiers and dehumidifiers, and portable heating or cooling units.Putnam and Finch 28 In addition to temperature and humidity, air flow is also a concern for textile preservation. Textiles should never be sealed in plastic or other air-tight casing unless it is part of a treatment or cleaning process. Proper circulation, combined with the suggested humidity, will help to prevent the growth of mold and mildew, which may stain or weaken antique textiles.Mailand 10 Pests Pests are another significant threat to textile collections, as there are a number of creatures which can cause damage to fibres. Among the most common are clothes moths, carpet beetles, silverfish, firebrats and rodents. Clothes moths are attracted to protein fibres, and so are especially drawn to silk, wool, and feathers. An infestation might be identified through the evidence of white cocoons (or the remnants thereof) on the textiles, or of sighting the insects themselves. They are roughly 8 centimetres long and white in colour. Like clothes moths, carpet beetles are likewise drawn to proteins, and can be quite destructive. Evidence of an infestation may take of the form of chewed holes, carcasses, or larvae, which appear as small pale worm-like insects. Silverfish and firebrats are related insects which consume starch, usually found in sizing or other treatments applied to fabrics, as well as plant-based textiles such as linen and cotton. Both are attracted to dark, moist climates, though silverfish prefer cooler temperatures, while firebrats tend towards warmer. Both are about 12 millimetres in length and either light or dark in colouring, depending on which type is present. Rodent infestations can be identified in the usual ways, such as seeing droppings, nests, or comparatively large chewed areas of textile where they have caused damage. In all cases, chemical means of pest control should be avoided if possible, not only due to harm to humans who come in contact with them, but because the chemicals may cause damage to the very textiles the conservator is trying to save. For rodents, snap traps may be effective, and if needed, a professional exterminator should be called. Poison baited traps should be avoided, as the rodent could die somewhere inaccessible, and provide a breeding ground for further pests.Mailand and Alig 27 Also, in the case of a rodent infestation, all access points to the room (such as cracks or holes) through which they might be entering should be located and sealed if possible.Mailand 11 For insects, keeping clean storage, display, and work environment is the best method of prevention. Also, sticky traps (replaced often) around doors, windows, and display cases may be useful for monitoring the insect population. Furthermore, the population of carnivorous insects, such as spiders, should be observed. While such insects are not harmful to textiles by themselves, they may indicate another population of insects which are. If the infestation can be limited to one or a few pieces, the insects may be killed through freezing of the object. The textile should be wrapped in plastic and vacuum-sealed, then brought to a freezing temperature as quickly as possible, to prevent the insects from adjusting to the cold. The object may be left frozen for several days, but should be brought slowly back up to room temperature to avoid further damage. Note that while this method should kill adults, it may not destroy any eggs that are present. If chemical means must be employed, it would be best to consult with a professional conservator to be certain that the treatment will not harm the textiles themselves. Even if no signs of an infestation are present, textiles should still be inspected periodically to be certain that there is no outbreak that has gone unobserved. Additionally, when dealing with a new acquisition which shows signs of insect damage, the specimen should be quarantined until it can be determined whether the insects are still present before introducing it to the rest of the collection. Textile instability In some cases, the textiles are weakened not by outside causes such as light or pests, but by chemical reactions taking place within the fabric itself, such as the oxidation of iron-based mordants over time, which can cause darkening and discolouration in the surrounding fibres.Putnam and Finch 18 One example which is cited frequently throughout the literature is the case of ‚Äúshattered silk.‚Äù During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, many silk manufacturers treated their fabrics with metallic salts (usually containing tin and iron) to give them a heavier, more luxurious feel. However, as these fabrics have aged, the metals in the fibres have accelerated their decay and caused them to become extremely brittle. The shredded or ‚Äúshattered‚Äù effect this causes is the reason for the name. In this case, the environment of the textile contributes very little to the deterioration from the metallic salts, though exposure to light may accelerate it even further.Putnam and Finch 19 Textile preservationists should be familiar with their collections and the history and provenance of their pieces. Chemical tests can reveal the types of dyes and mordants used, as well as any other treatments applied to the fabric.Schweppe 153 Such knowledge can lead to the prevention of further decay by learning which pieces need to be handled with particular care. Handling It goes without saying that fragile and/or valuable textiles should be handled with care, and as little as necessary in any given circumstance. However, should handling be necessary, there are precautions Taken from Fahey which can be taken to ensure the safety of the textile. Because our hands contain oils and acids in the skin, clean cloth gloves should be worn when handling textiles. If gloves are unavailable, then frequent hand-washing should be undertaken to ensure that no damage is caused. For similar reasons, the working, display, and storage areas should be free of food, drink, and cigarette smoke, which can also stain or damage the fabric. Finally, to avoid ink stains, only pencils should be used for writing or sketching in the work space. To avoid snags and pulls, remove any jewelry that may catch in the fabric's weave, and wear clothing free of large buckles or other objects which may snag the textile. Long hair should also be tied back to allow a clear view of the working area, even when the head is bent over the table. When working with the textiles, it should be placed on a clean, flat surface which is larger than the textile itself, so that the whole piece is supported evenly. Although it is supported, never place anything on top of the textile while it is in the flat position. When moving the textile, it is important to maintain the flat, even support of the work space. If the piece is small enough (a handkerchief or sampler, for instance), it may be placed on an acid-free board or similar support and carried as if on a tray. If the piece is too large for this (a carpet or tapestry, for example), the piece may be rolled around an acid-free tube and carried by two people to its new location. Finally, antique costumes and clothing should never be worn, as the mere process of putting the clothes on and taking them off will cause damage. Additionally, the model may not fit the costume precisely ‚Äì clothing was for a long time made to fit a specific person, not mass-produced in approximate sizes ‚Äì causing strain where there should be none and slack where there likewise should be none. Cleaning Vacuuming One of the safest and easiest ways to clean textiles is to vacuum them. The fabric is placed on a clean, flat work surface. If the specimen is particularly delicate, or simply as a precaution, a fibreglass screen edged with twill tape may be placed over the textile. The screen allows dirt and dust to pass through, but prevents individual threads from being pulled loose or unravelled further by the suction. Using a vacuum attachment and the lowest power setting, move the suction over the screen until the entire area has been cleaned. If needed, move the screen to a new area and begin again. Always remember to vacuum both sides of the textile, as dirt may filter through to the other side.Putnam and Finch 48 Hanging textiles will need to be vacuumed less often than horizontal pieces, as there are fewer places where dust can collect. Wet cleaning One of the key standards of preservation is that of reversibility: anything done to preserve a piece should be able to be undone with minimal damage to the piece itself. Because wet cleaning is a chemical process, it is not reversible, and so should be used only when absolutely necessary. Before cleaning a textile, certain questionsTaken from Rice, page 32 should be asked to determine both the best treatment for that particular combination of textile and soil, and to ascertain whether the piece is able to be cleaned, or may sustain damage during the process. What is the chemical composition of the textile? In other words, does it have a high acid content? Were there chemicals used in its production that might contribute to how it reacts to water? Or how it may react to cleaning chemicals? What are the characteristics of the fibres? For instance, cotton and linen, being plant fibers, are both stronger wet than dry, and so may be able to withstand a more mechanical stress than something like silk. Wool can absorb large amounts of water, but mats if washed in high temperatures. All silks become brittle with age, but weighted silks (see Textile Instability above) decay more quickly, and thus must be handled with extreme care. Additionally, some silks, once wet, can be permanently spotted. Learn the basic characteristics of the type of fibres you have, and how they have been treated before undertaking any kind of cleaning. What colourants have been used, and how will they react to cleaning? This can apply not only to dyes but to mordants as well. Different parts of the world may have different dye processes, so here is where knowledge of when and where a textile originated, as well as a working knowledge of chemistry, can come in handy. If in doubt as to the wash ability of a dye, apply a drop or two of water to an inconspicuous place and blot with a clean white cloth. If the dye transfers to the cloth, even in small amounts, the textile should not be washed.Mailand 8 Are there finishes or surface treatments that must be preserved? For example, is the fabric painted? If so, it should never be washed; some other cleaning method should be used.Putnam and Finch 47 What kinds of soils are there? The older the stain, the more difficult it is to remove. After a certain point, it may be best to leave the stain or soil, or remove it only partially, in order to preserve the rest of the piece. Additionally, soils which may not be detectable to the naked eye might be present in the textile; flags, for instance, may be highly acidic due to long exposure to air pollutants, and should be treated by a professional conservator. What cleaner is safest and most effective? Commercial detergents should never be used on antique textiles, whatever their claims of gentleness: the chemicals used in most clothes detergents are too harsh for old fibres to withstand. A wide range of speciality detergents are available from conservation suppliers, though most sources suggest Ivory dish soap as a last- minute substitution if needed. Never use chemical spot cleaners, as they are likewise too harsh for old fibres to tolerate. This is especially important for pieces in situ, as this may endanger other nearby pieces as well (the wooden part of an upholstered piece of furniture, for instance).Putnam and Finch 45 What additives and cleaning aids are needed? This can include physical supplies (water, screens, a vacuum cleaner), as well as chemical (water softener, cleaning agents, etc.). How long can the specimen be exposed to the cleaner? Prolonged exposure may cause additional damage to the fibres. What mechanical action can be used? The older and more fragile a textile, the less movement it will be able to tolerate during the cleaning process, so this should be considered before undertaking a cleaning. Once the best cleaning process has been determined, the piece should be prepared for washing. Usually, this involves vacuuming to remove any surface dirt. Linings and backing should also be removed, vacuumed, and washed separately. This is not only to prevent colour bleeding, but to avoid trapping dirt between the layers, which may cause discolouration from the inside. Additionally, different fibres react to cleaning in different ways, and fabrics may shrink or stretch, which, if they are still attached together, may cause rippling and distortion in the lining and outer layer of the textile. As with moving or working with dry pieces, the textile should be washed in a flat, fully supported position. Usually this is achieved through the use of screens like the ones used in vacuuming, though these may be supported in a frame of some kind for added stability. The textile should be sandwiched between two screens. If the piece is particularly delicate or fragile, it may be wrapped in netting, then placed between the screens. The cleaning solution should be prepared using distilled water. If that is unavailable, softened water may be substituted. The main concern is to avoid hard water, which will leave deposits of minerals in the fibres. The solution should be placed in a container large enough for the textile to lie flat in. For large pieces, it may be necessary to construct a temporary basin outside or in a large room: Putnam and Finch suggest using boards or bricks to constrict a frame, then lining it with a large piece of plastic, weighted on the sides, and strong enough to support the water that will be poured into it. If a smaller basin is used, it should be of ceramic, stainless steel or a stable plastic. The screen-encased textile is lowered into the solution. The textile can then be washed by pressing a soft sponge directly down onto the fibres. DO NOT RUB the sponge, as this will cause unnecessary abrasion at a moment when the textile is already weak from the water.Putnam and Finch 50 The textile may be submerged for no more than an hour, and should be rinsed at least four times after it is cleaned (Mailand). The final rinse should always be with distilled water. The textile should be placed to dry on a flat surface or screen, in a well-ventilated room away from heat. Dry cleaning Dry cleaning is generally only used for oil stains, as it is a very stressful process of the textile. Commercial dry cleaners should never be used, as the chemicals used in the process are too strong for old fabrics to withstand without damage. If dry cleaning is absolutely necessary, consult a professional conservator.Mailand 9 Steaming and ironing Steaming and ironing textiles should be done with caution, as the heat may affect the viability of the fibres. More importantly, the fabric should always be cleaned before either of these processes is used, since heat may trap dirt and stains in the fibres to such an extent that the stain becomes permanent. Always use the lowest setting for either of these procedures. If a garment relies on folds to maintain its proper shape (such as pleats), it may be better to finger-press the folds into place when the garment is damp and allow it to dry that way, rather than subject it to the added stress of ironing.Putnam and Finch 54-55 One alternative to ironing If a textile item is relatively thin and light, and is safe to wet, it can be laid out flat on a piece of glass which is larger than the item. Before each use, the glass surface should be cleaned with 'safe' cleaners, as for the textile itself (see 'Wet Cleaning,' above), even if the glass has been kept in a clean place. The last rinse of the glass should ideally be with a very clean cotton cloth and distilled water. Lay the textile out as flat as possible on the dry glass. Do not let the textile touch any metal or other casing that protects the edge of the glass. Old storm- windowpanes and glass shower doors are often used for this task, and they usually have their original edging left on, if it's not too bulky, for reasons of safety in handling. If the textile is known to be clean, it can be laid out dry and gently wetted to full saturation. As sections are wetted, any crumples, folds, or details (such as fringes, the picots on the edges of lace, or fine pleats) can be gently teased into place with clean fingertips so that they lie as flat as possible on the glass. Some old textiles can be flattened on glass just after washing, though it may be best to transfer to the glass fully supported, as on a netting screen or similar. The supporting fabric can be removed by rolling it out from under the textile item as it is laid out on the glass, bit by bit. Just be aware that this can stress the fibres: do not use this method on any old textile that is likely to be damaged by the handling. Let such fabrics dry first, then lay them on the glass and wet them in place. Let dry completely in a darkened place with good air-flow. The textile can be gently lifted from the glass when it's completely dry, and will usually look just as smooth as if a hot iron had been used on it. Restoration Restoration can be done with techniques like mending and darning.Rafoogari: Art of darning, Deccan herald, 13 April 2013.New Delhi: Mapping a forgotten tradition, LiveMint, 28 April 2017.Journey of a shawl , The Statesman, 19 April 2018.The fabric of hope, The Hindu, 25 Aug 2016. Storage As stated in the Climate section, the best storage environment for textiles is clean, dark, cool, and moderately dry, with a constant temperature and relative humidity. Ideally, there should be no strain on any one particular area of cloth. There are three basic kinds of storage for textiles, and the choice of which to use relies on the type of textile and the space available. The three types are: Flat, Rolled, and Hanging storage. Flat storage Flat storage is the best option for exceptionally fragile pieces because it provides the most even support for the fibres. Enamelled metal shelves or drawers may be used, or acid-free boxes. The textiles may be placed in the boxes or drawers flat, if at all possible. If folding becomes necessary, acid-free tissue paper should be used to form soft rolls around which the folds can be shaped, to prevent creases from forming. Even so, folded textiles should be removed and refolded differently every few months, to allow even wear on the piece.Putnam and Finch 40 Rolled storage For exceptionally large textiles, such as tapestries, draperies, carpets and quilts, rolled storage is the best option. Like the upholstery section of a fabric store, the rolled storage area should consist of racks, each containing horizontally suspended acid-free or fabric-covered tubes around which the fabrics can be wrapped, being sure to line the selvages up with the edges of the roll. Textiles with a decorative side (such as velvets and embroidered textiles) should always be rolled with the decorative side facing out. This is because the inner layer, especially if there is a lining, may crease, stretch, or fold while it is on the roll. The rolled textiles can then be covered with a muslin wrapper to protect it from dust.Mailand and Alig 41 Hanging costume storage For costumes, flat storage may create more problems than it solves, since it is impossible to store them in this manner without forming folds and creases. Therefore, unless the costume is so weakened that it cannot support its own weight, hanging storage is perhaps the best option. Costumes which are unusually heavy (heavily beaded gowns, for instance), or those whose fabric may distort easily (such as some stretch fabrics, or those cut on the bias) should also be stored in flat storage. Garments suitable for hanging should be placed on plastic hangers which have been padded to mimic the shape of human shoulders, and covered with a plastic or cloth cover with an open bottom to allow air circulation while keeping the costume clean. Wooden hangers may have a high acid content, which may cause discolouration or decay to the costume. Likewise, metal hangers do not provide sufficient support, and may lead to distortion of the garments‚Äô shoulders. Therefore, both forms of hanging should be avoided.Mailand and Alig 44 If sufficient space is available, selected garments may be stored on dummies to better keep their shape. If this method is used, dummies should be fitted out with the proper undergarments, such as bustles or panniers, to provide adequate support for the garments as they were intended to be worn. However, while the main concern of a display may be to make the garment look attractive on the dummy, storage need have no such considerations. Loose, unsupported parts of the garment (such as sleeves or shirts) should be loosely stuffed with acid-free tissue paper to provide additional support.Putnam and Finch 41-42 Costume accessories can be stored in a variety of ways. Generally, bonnets and gloves should be loosely stuffed with acid-free tissue and placed in archival-quality boxes or under cover. Fans and parasols may be stored in half-open positions, which provide the least amount of stress on the fabrics.Putnam and Finch 42 Display The conditions required for display of textiles are largely those that have already been discussed in the Storage and Environment sections. Dry, cool, and dark, are to be preferred, with clean surroundings and frequent checks to be certain that the textiles are remaining in good condition. Lighting should be kept to a minimum, and textiles should be rotated through display, so that each is only exposed to light for a few months at a time before being returned to darkness or taken for cleaning/conservation work. Textiles should be vacuumed before and after display.  Education and training  In France, conservators specialized in textiles arts are trained at the Institut National du Patrimoine (The National Institute of Cultural Heritage). Their mission is to intervene when heritage resources are threatened or deteriorated for several reasons. The conservator prevents works of art from disappearing or loses its purpose whilst analyzing the complex stage of its material history and the cause of alteration.

Yamatji peoples were involved in a large native title claim since 1996, resulting in an historic determination in February 2020, involving both native title and an Indigenous Land Use Agreement covering an area of . Native Title claims The Yamatji Marlpa Aboriginal Corporation (YMAC), pursuant to the (Commonwealth) Native Title Act 1993, is \\"the native title representative body (NTRB) for native title claims in the resource-rich Pilbara, Murchison and Gascoyne areas of Western Australia\\". There have been four executive directors of the YMAC: Wayne Warner (1996-1998); former AFL footballer Clinton Wolf (1998-2001); Roger Cook (2001-2003) and current CEO Simon Hawkins (2003‚Äìpresent). YMAC was until 2017 co-chaired by Pilbara representative Doris Eaton and Yamatji Representative Ben Roberts. Eaton was recognised as the NAIDOC Female Elder of the Year in 2009. Claims As of 2017 the Yamatji had made two of the twelve claims for native title in the Geraldton region. One, concerning the Wajarri Yamatji, was filed in 2004. The second was filed by the Southern Yamatji in 2017. The claim process was started in 1996, including several different groups making overlapping claims. In February 2016, a Federal Court of Australia judicial registrar convened mediation, resulting in outstanding overlaps being resolved and the commencement of negotiations with the Western Australian Government. In 2019, more than 1,000 claimants from four different claim groups came together in the Yamatji Nation Southern Regional Agreement, which brought together the claims of Southern Yamatji, Hutt River, Mullewa Wadjari and Widi Mob groups. After two years of intense negotiations, on 7 February 2020 the Yamatji Nation was awarded both native title recognition and a million package, for a claim of an area covering nearly , as far north as Kalbarri, east to Yalgoo, and south to Dalwallinu. There are about 9,000 traditional owners involved in the claim. It was the first time in Australia that both native title recognition and an Indigenous Land Use Agreement have been determined simultaneously. The decision had special significance for the Yamatji people, because of the widespread physical dispossession of their lands. As a result of the decision, Yamatji Nation will hold non-exclusive possession rights over parts of the former Barnong, Menai Hills and Kadji Kadji pastoral leases, as well as land near Wanda Nature Reserve, Lucky Bay and Aboriginal Lands Trust areas in Carnamah, Kadathini and Eneabba. It does not give them the right to control access and use of an area, but it does allow them to access, hunt and camp on this country. A conservation area will be created under joint management, empowering the traditional owners to be able to care for their country, and will offer opportunities for Indigenous ranger programs in the region. Minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt, stressed the significance of the decision, saying \\"It gives, through this determination, traditional owners a place at the table. You are no longer sitting outside waiting for a decision, you are co-developing, co-designing the future\\".

A 1976 release, it was his second of four albums released on Chrysalis Records in the 1970s. Deep Purple/Rainbow bass guitarist Roger Glover co-produced with Gallagher: it was the first time that Gallagher worked with a \\"name\\" producer and the only successful such collaboration.The only other attempt was the failed next album. Gallagher tried letting Elliot Mazer produce in San Francisco. After the album was finished Gallagher scrapped it and fired most of his band. The Mazer versions of these songs were posthumously released as Notes From San Francisco. It was also the last album Gallagher would do with Rod de'Ath (drums) and Lou Martin (keyboards). After Calling Card, Gallagher retained only his long-time bass guitarist Gerry McAvoy and hired Ted McKenna on drums. This revised power trio was Gallagher's line up for the next five years when Brendan O'Neil took the sticks. Recording The sessions for the album began at Musicland Studios in Munich, Germany, in the summer of 1976. Glover came on board as co-producer after having met Gallagher when the latter opened for Deep Purple on an American tour. The choice of Glover signified a conscious attempt by Gallagher to try new directions from the hard rock he was best known for. Calling Card is one of his most diverse albums. It also reflects the synergy that the band had developed after years of playing together. As producer Roger Glover commented ‚Äúthey all seemed very dedicated to Rory, there was an allegiance, born of years of smoky clubs and endless journeys‚Äù. This was the fifth and last release featuring this line-up. Reaction The album is often considered one of Gallagher's finest studio offerings with Allmusic giving the album 4.5 stars out of 5. In its August 2005 issue, Guitar Player's \\"Oeuvre Easy\\" feature on Gallagher praised its \\"brilliant songs\\" and \\"rockin' edge\\" and listed it in the \\"Inspired\\" section of his catalogue.

He grew up in Christchurch, New Zealand and moved to Sydney in the mid-1980s. From childhood he was fascinated with the supernatural and terrifying consequences of events from stories such as \\"The Tinderbox\\", a predilection which continued through his high school years and beyond.Hanson, Donna Maree. Australian Speculative Fiction: A Genre Overview. Murrumbateman NSW: Aust Speculative Fiction. 2005, p. 115 Editorial career Between 1987 and 1992 he co-edited (with Chris G.C. Sequeira and Leigh Blackmore), Terror Australis: The Australian Horror and Fantasy Magazine (1987‚Äì92). A column by Stevens, \\"Every Time the Candle Burns\\", appeared in Issues 1 and 3 of Terror Australis, and he reviewed books under both his own name and the pseudonym of David Kuraria for the magazine's \\"In the Bad Books\\" column. Stevens was the basis for the character 'Doc Martin' as drawn and photographed in various of Christopher Sequeira's occult detective graphic novel series, Deadlocke and Doc Martin (in Pulse of Darkness and elsewhere). Stevens contributed interior art to numerous horror magazines in the 1990s in Australia and also cover art for issues of E.O.D, Shoggoth and Bloodsongs. In the mid-1990s Stevens moved to Melbourne, where he was a key figure (with Steven Proposch and Chris A. Masters) in the Melbourne Horror Society (later known as The Australian Horror Writers) - a forerunner to the Australian Horror Writers Association) - where he helped produce Bloodsongs (1994‚Äì95) magazine. From 1996 through 1998, Stevens was President of the Australian Horror Writers. He edited issues 5-11 of its official newsletter Severed HeadSevered Head (subtitled The Newsletter for the Melbourne Horror Society from Issue 1 to Issue 4 (April 1994; subtitled The Australian Horror Society Newsletter from Issue 5 (Nov 1994) to issue 11 (March 1995); subtitled The Journal of the Australian Horror Society on issue 12 (Oct 1996); subtitled The Journal of the Australian Horror Writers from issue 13 (Feb 1997) to the final issue, No 16 (Jan 1998). Writings and Art In 1999 he held his solo art show, the \\"Screw the Millennium Bug Exhibition\\" at Melbourne's Blue Velvet Lounge. His story of the same year, \\"Rookwood\\" (Aurealis No 24, 1999) is a collaboration with Rick Kennett and is currently available in the e-book Forbidden Texts (ed. David Bain (CreateSpace, 2013). In the late 1990s he produced several issues of a personal zine, Choking Dog Gazette. Originally a hardcopy zine, the title was revived in 2012 as an online zine; later issues were distributed through the SSWFT amateur press association. Stevens has published several small press collections of horror stories (see below). His short stories have also appeared in Black Moon, Bloodsongs, Cold Cuts, Dead By Dawn, E.O.D, Forbidden Tomes, Cthulhu and the Co-Eds: Kids & Squids, Midnight Echo, Misanthrope, Octavia, Outside, and Terror Australis. (magazine and book anthology). Stevens is noted for his hard-edged and uncompromising horror content; however he often delves into black humour and amongst his most reprinted stories are a Lovecraftian parody called \\"The Diary of Howard Clark Long Phillips\\"and \\"Payday\\" . Some of his horror stories show a black humour reminiscent of a cross between Ben Elton and Joe R. Lansdale. One of his most acclaimed stories is \\"Sisters of the Moss\\", most recently reprinted in Orb No 8 (The Best of Orb 1-7).

It first appeared in a 1958 issue of Star Science Fiction and has been reprinted a number of times, including in Star Science Fiction Stories No. 4 (1958) and Far Out (1961).Index to Science Fiction Anthologies and Collections  Synopsis  Aliens land in New Jersey, in a mile-long space ship. They request of level ground to erect buildings, and induce humans to work for them by passing out capsules that produce a feeling of temporary bliss. The workers are given sticks, each a \\"light metal or plastic rod, five feet long, with a curved handle and a splayed tip\\": > \\"When the command 'Go' is heard,\\" said the alien's voice clearly, \\"you will > all proceed directly forward at a slow walking pace, swinging your sticks > from side to side.\\" The sticks flatten the ground in front of the people as they walk. Later the aliens make adjustments in the sticks, and the ground bulges up into walls. Eventually an enormous building takes shape. The aliens are circumspect about their motives. One alien, Pendrath, is fond of fraternizing with humans. On one occasion he becomes drunk (from aspirin), and lets slip that the building will house a giant drill, which will be used to place a bomb in the core of the Earth. The purpose is to increase the amount of dust in the space around the Sun as a means to slow down spaceships and to protect the aliens from invasion. The humans become desperate to find a defense. They modify the \\"idiot sticks\\" at random; each modification causes the stick to become unstable and to kill its operator. Eventually a pattern is found that is stable and that is lethal to the aliens. A mob storms the ship and the aliens are killed.

On April 2, 1991, she defeated Kyoko Inoue for the All Japan Singes title. This was an important push for a wrestler so young, but her beauty and improving work rate was considered strong enough to put her over for the belt. She held it for a year, pretty outstanding for the time. She lost the title to Mariko Yoshida exactly one year later. She was paired with Mariko Yoshida; the brain trust figuring their styles would complement each other. They were booked to win the All Japan Tag Team titles on August 2, 1991, from Esther Moreno & Cynthia Moreno. On November 21, 1991, Inoue released a single called \\"Door of Miracle\\". Inoue and Yoshida then lost them to another up and coming team, Sakie Hasegawa & Debbie Malenko, on January 5, 1992. On April 25, 1992, Takako and Yoshida took the titles back from Sakie Hawegawa and Debbie Malenko before losing them to Bat Yoshinaga & Tomoko Watanabe on December 1, 1992. After the hot tag run ended, Takako found herself in the supporting role of a tag team with Yumiko Hotta. On September 5, 1993, she and Hotta won the UWA Tag Team titles from Akira Hokuto and Suzuka Minami. They had a good run, though only defending the titles occasionally, while the AJW brain trust was figuring her future. This caused Inoue to consider retirement. Hotta and Inoue finally lost the titles on March 30, 1994, to Etsuko Mita and Mima Shimoda. Her big break came when she and Kyoko Inoue formed a tag-team named ‚ÄúDouble Inoue‚Äù, in which Takako adopted Kyoko's usual face paint design. They defeated Manami Toyota and Toshiyo Yamada for the WWWA World Tag Team titles from on October 9, 1994, ending Toyota and Yamada‚Äôs almost 2 year domination. They defended the titles once, and then vacated them in an angle where they, being the 99th WWWA tag champs, wanted to be the 100th. On March 21, 1995, a one-night tournament was held with Double Inoue winning three matches to regain the titles. Double Inoue would now go on to dominate the tag titles, becoming the hot tag team in AJW for the next eighteen months. (They held the WWWA tag titles three times during this period.) Their hottest feud during this time was with the team of Manami Toyota and Sakie Hasegawa (or her masked alter ego, Blizzard Yuki). The feud produced quite a few outstanding tussles, including the one-night tournament final. After losing the titles to Manami Toyota and Mima Shimoda on June 22, 1996, the Inoues split up; it was decided that Kyoko would be getting a serious push at the WWWA title. Takako was not forgotten, however, as she would also win singles gold during this time. She defeated Reggie Bennett for the IWA Women‚Äôs title on December 4, 1995, and would defeat Bennett once again on November 21, 1996, in a unification match where Takako walked off with both the IWA title and the All-Pacific title. Takako then challenged ex-partner and WWWA champion Kyoko Inoue on January 20, 1997, in a losing effort to unify all three titles. After Kyoko vacated the All-Pacific title, Takako defeated Toshiyo Yamada to regain the belt on June 18, 1997. However, a severe eye injury suffered in a title defense caused Takako to miss three months and vacate the title. Once healed, she won the All-Pacific title back on January 3, 1998. She then lost it on April 21, 1998, to ZAP T (Tomoko Watanabe as a masked heel). She has also worked many inter-promotional matches while with AJW, being among the first to work them, notably against Cutie Suzuki and Mayumi Ozaki of JWP Joshi Puroresu. But for all that, she was never positioned as a top-level single in AJW, instead being a top mid-carder, used to set up those for the push into the top level. Amazingly, for someone with her experience, she had only two matches for the WWWA title: one against Kyoko Inoue, and in October, 1995, she was Dynamite Kansai‚Äôs first defense after Kansai had just won the WWWA title. Her last major singles hurrah for AJW during this period was her push for the All-Pacific Title. Given the fact she was spinning her wheels and facing the specter of continued bookings against the ZAPs, in what essentially turned into comedy matches, Takako left AJW in 1999 to freelance. Getting out from under AJW seemed to help, for she found herself in demand. She soon landed in Ladies Legend Pro-Wrestling, where, on September 2, 2000, Takako, Rumi Kazama and Eagle Sawai (collectively known as Black Joker) won the vacant LLPW Six Woman Tag Team titles from Miho Wakizawa, Manami Toyota and Nanae Takahashi. They held the belts for almost two years before dropping them to Mizuki Endo, Keiko Aono, & Rieko Amano on June 15, 2002. Freelance (1999‚Äìpresent) As a freelancer she worked for various women's promotions, such as LLPW (Ladies Legend Pro-Wrestling), Oz Academy, and Arsion. She has been signed to LLPW since February 2005.‰∫ï‰∏ä Ë≤¥Â≠ê - Joshi Pro- Wrestling Other fields Inoue has posed for several modeling photobooks.

A grandnephew of Servius Sulpicius Rufus, he was also a descendant, great grandson or nephew, of Gaius Cassius Longinus, one of Caesar's assassins. Longinus was suffect consul of the second half of the year 30 as the colleague of Lucius Naevius Surdinus.Alison E. Cooley, The Cambridge Manual of Latin Epigraphy (Cambridge: University Press, 2012), p. 460 Cassius, a pupil of Sabinus, was head of the legal school called the Sabinians or Cassinians. His principal works are the libri (commentarii) iuris civilis in at least ten volumes, which only survive in quotes by later authors such as Iavolenus. After completing his term as suffect consul, Longinus served as proconsular governor of Asia minor in 40‚Äì41, then governor of the imperial province of Syria in 41-49. He was exiled by Nero to Sardinia in 65, but returned to Rome when Vespasian acceded to the purple. Tacitus includes a speech of Cassius, when he was a senator in the time of Nero, on the debate that arose when there had been mass protests in Rome when 400 innocent slaves were to be executed because they belonged to the household of Lucius Pedanius Secundus who had been murdered by his slave.Tacitus, Annales XIV.42-45https://www.romansinfocus.com/sites/www.romansinfocus.com/files/Pedanius%20Secundus%20and%20the%20greater%20good.pdf It is open to question as to what extent the speech we have reflected what Cassius actually said, and to what extent it represents Tacitus's views, though it is at least possible that Tacitus made use of the Senate's records; the hard line expressed is in line with what we know about Cassius. In the speech Cassius conceded that the execution would be unjust. He also conceded it violated the rights of private interests but justified it on the grounds of the public good. The private interests that concerned him did not include any right to life for the slaves but the loss to the heirs.Fear of slaves, fear of enslavement in the ancient Mediterranean, Anastasia Serghidou, pp. 151-2 Modern commentators side with those who protested at the time in regarding the law as inherently unjust. He married Junia Lepida, a descendant of Augustus. Lepida bore Longinus two children: * Cassia Longina (born c. AD 35), married to the general Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo, by whom she had two daughters: Domitia and Domitia Longina * Cassius Lepidus (born c. AD 55), married to an unknown woman by whom he had a daughter, Cassia Lepida (born c. AD 80).

Thienamycin has excellent activity against both Gram-positive and Gram- negative bacteria and is resistant to bacterial Œ≤-lactamase enzymes. Thienamycin is a zwitterion at pH 7. History In 1976, fermentation broths obtained from the soil bacterium Streptomyces cattleya were found to be active in a screen for inhibitors of peptidoglycan biosynthesis. Initial attempts to isolate the active compound proved difficult due to its chemical instability. After many attempts and extensive purification, the material was finally isolated in >90% purity, allowing for the structural elucidation of thienamycin in 1979 (Figure 1). Figure 1. The Structure of thienamycin (with systematic numbering Thienamycin was the first among the naturally occurring class of carbapenem antibiotics to be discovered and isolated. Carbapenems are similar in structure to their antibiotic ‚Äúcousins‚Äù the penicillins. Like penicillins, carbapenems contain a Œ≤-lactam ring (cyclic amide) fused to a five-membered ring. Carbapenems differ in structure from penicillins in that within the five-membered ring a sulfur is replaced by a carbon atom (C1) and an unsaturation is present between C2 and C3 in the five-membered ring. Mechanism of action In vitro, thienamycin employs a similar mode of action as penicillins through disrupting the cell wall synthesis (peptidoglycan biosynthesis) of various Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus,Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa to name a few). Although thienamycin binds to all of the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) in Escherichia coli, it preferentially binds to PBP-1 and PBP-2, which are both associated with the elongation of the cell wall. Unlike penicillins, which are rendered ineffective through rapid hydrolysis by the Œ≤-lactamase enzyme present in some strains of bacteria, thienamycin remains antimicrobially active. Thienamycin displayed high activity against bacteria that were resistant to other Œ≤-lactamase-stable compounds (cephalosporins), highlighting the superiority of thienamycin as an antibiotic among Œ≤-lactams. Biosynthesis The formation of thienamycin is thought to occur through a different pathway from classic Œ≤-lactams (penicillins, cephalosporins). Production of classic Œ≤-lactams in both fungi and bacteria occur through two steps: First, the condensation of -cysteine, -valine, and -Œ±-aminoadipic acid by ACV synthetase (ACVS, a nonribosomal peptide synthetase) and then cyclization of this formed tripeptide by isopenicillin N synthetase (IPNS). The gene cluster (thn) for the biosynthesis of thienamycin of S. cattleya was identified and sequenced in 2003, lending insight into the biosynthetic mechanism for thienamycin formation. The biosynthesis is thought to share features with the biosynthesis of the simple carbapenems, beginning with the condensation of malonyl-CoA with glutamate-5-semialdehyde to form the pyrroline ring. The Œ≤-lactam is then formed by a Œ≤-lactam synthetase, which makes use of ATP, providing a carbapenam. At some later point, oxidation to the carbapenem and ring inversions must occur. The hydroxyethyl side chain of thienamycin is thought to be a result of two separate methyl transfers from S-adenosyl methionine. According to the proposed gene functions, ThnK, ThnL, and ThnP could catalyze these methyl-transfer steps. A Œ≤-lactam synthetase (ThnM) is thought to catalyze the formation of the Œ≤-lactam ring fused to the five-membered ring. How the cysteaminyl side-chain is incorporated is largely unknown, although ThnT, ThnR, and ThnH are involved in the processing of CoA to cysteamine for use in the pathway. Various oxidations complete the biosynthesis. Total synthesis Figure 3. Total Synthesis of (+)-Thienamycin Figure 4. Stereoselective Formation of the Lactam Ring Due to low titre and to difficulties in isolating and purifying thienamycin produced by fermentation, total synthesis is the preferred method for commercial production. Numerous methods are available in the literature for the total synthesis of thienamycin. One synthetic route is given in Figure 3. The starting Œ≤-lactam for the pathway given above can be synthesized using the following method (Figure 4):  Clinical use  Since thienamycin decomposes in the presence of water, it is impractical for the clinical treatment of bacterial infections, so stable derivatives were created for medicinal consumption. One such derivative, imipenem, was formulated in 1985. Imipenem, an N-formimidoyl derivative of thienamycin, is rapidly metabolized by a renal dipeptidase enzyme found in the human body. To prevent its rapid degradation, imipenem is normally coadministered with cilastatin, an inhibitor of this enzyme.

It is the largest memorial in the United States dedicated solely to honoring all branches of military veterans and service personnel. It was conceived by the Grand Army of the Republic in the 1890s as a way for Pittsburgh and Allegheny County to honor the dwindling ranks of its American Civil War veterans; it was built on what had served as the army mustering ground during the Civil War. The Memorial today represents all branches of the service and honors both career and citizen soldiers who have served the United States throughout its history. Architect Henry Hornbostel designed the memorial in 1907. Dedicated in 1910, the building is in the Beaux-Arts style and is heroic in scale. It is located in the Oakland section of Pittsburgh at 4141 Fifth Avenue (although the walkway leading to its main entrance is signed as \\"Matthew Ridgway Blvd.\\" in honor of the World War II and Korean War hero who called Pittsburgh home) and adjacent to the University of Pittsburgh campus and its Cathedral of Learning. The building is set back from Fifth Avenue, featuring expansive and well-kept lawns dotted with large cannons and other war implements. Side streets flanking the building are Bigelow Boulevard and University Place; directly behind is O'Hara Street. The Memorial houses rare and one-of-a-kind exhibits that span the eras from the Civil War to the present day conflicts. Since 1963 it has operated the \\"Hall of Valor\\" to honor individual veterans from the region who went above and beyond the call of duty. Today the hall has over 600 honorees among them are Medal of Honor, The Kearny Cross, Distinguished Service Cross, Navy Cross, Air Force Cross, Silver Star and Distinguished Flying Cross winners. The building houses an auditorium seating 2,500, a banquet hall, and meeting rooms, in addition to its museum. The expansive lawn of the memorial sits on top of an underground parking garage operated under a long-term lease by the University of Pittsburgh. It has served as host for many city, civic, university, and business events including the April 25, 1978 Gulf Oil Corporation shareholders meeting.

Founded in 1901, it was acquired by Chicago-based RR Donnelley in late 2006. History George Banta (1857‚Äì1935) began printing forms while working as an insurance agent. In 1901, he opened a storefront and formed the George Banta Printing Company, renamed two years later the George Banta Publishing Company.\\"Banta Corporation.\\" International Directory of Company Histories. The Gale Group, Inc. 2006 Banta's home, where he started the company, now known as the George, Sr., and Ellen Banta House, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Much of the company's early growth came from educational contracts. George Banta, a member of Phi Delta Theta fraternity at Indiana University in Bloomington, secured a contract to print its national magazine, The Scroll. Other national fraternities and sororities followed; the company would also publish Banta's Greek Exchange, a monthly review of fraternity and sorority news, and several editions of Baird's Manual of American College Fraternities. George's late father, David Demaree Banta (1833‚Äì1896), was dean of the Indiana University School of Law, and through this connection the company also won orders for university catalogs and yearbooks, textbooks, and magazines. In 1910 it moved to a new building, where its headquarters would remain for nearly the remainder of the century. The elder Banta had helped found the Phi Delta Theta fraternity. In the 1920s, one of George Banta, Jr.'s brothers-in-law, Russell Sharp, created an elementary school workbook and turned to Banta Publishing to print it. Its expertise in publishing them helped make it a leader in production of other softcover books. In 1954, it adopted the name George Banta Company, Inc. and in 1971 it went public, traded on NASDAQ as BNTA. After 27 years, it moved to the New York Stock Exchange on December 18, 1998, where it traded under the symbol BN for the next eight years.Banta Corporation - 1998 annual report, p.4 Starting in 1969, the Banta Company began a program of acquisitions of imaging and printing-related companies as well as manufacturers of packaging, paper products, and display equipment. It also diversified within its print business, printing catalogs, trade books, and the Parker Brothers board game Trivial Pursuit. As the printing industry declined in the early 21st century, Banta spun off several units to focus on its core businesses. In August 2006, Connecticut-based envelope printer Cenveo made an unsolicited offer to buy the company, but Banta's management considered it hostile. (Banta's stock price had recently fallen from the low $40s in late July; it closed at a penny under $34 on August 8, but the news shot the price up to $46 the following day.) Instead, it accepted a $1.3 billion offer from major competitor RR Donnelley of Chicago in October, at $52.50 cash per share ($36.50 plus a $16 special dividend).All Business.com - accessed 2009-06-07 The cash deal was fortuitous for Banta shareholders, as the value of RR Donnelley stock declined considerably in 2008.Yahoo Finance - RRD chart - 5 yr - accessed 2009-06-07 Family company Founder Banta remained president until his death in 1935 at age 78. His wife Nellie, who ran day-to-day operations from 1904 to 1911, assumed the presidency afterwards until her death in 1951. Their son, George Banta, Jr., joined the company in 1911 and served as president from 1951 to 1961. In 1965, George, Jr.'s son George Banta III took over, stepping aside to become chairman in 1971, where he remained until 1983. The company's final chairman & CEO in 2006 was Stephanie Streeter.

He is the most prolific and widely published genre author in Australia after Paul Collins, Terry Dowling and Greg Egan, with stories in a wide variety of magazines and anthologies in Australia, the US and the UK. His first published short story was \\"Troublesome Green\\" (1979). A number of his stories have been printed multiple times due to his habit of resubmission - for instance, \\"Isle of the Dancing Dead\\" and \\"The Battle of Leila the Dog\\". A number of his ghost stories feature the recurring character Ernie Pine, known as \\"the reluctant ghost-hunter\\". An excerpt of an intended novel featuring Pine, Abracadabra, appeared in Bloodsongs 2 (1994). Retitled The Devil and the Deep Blue Sea, the novel was published by Cooperative Press in 2013. Another continuing character in his work is the Lesbian \\"trained killer for the state\\" Cy De Gerch, the heroine of his novel Presumed Dead and the collection Thirty Minutes for New Hell. Some of Kennett's work is science fiction, but some of his science fiction stories feature ghosts, thus his work crosses genre boundaries that are often kept separate. Kennett was an early contributor to The Australian Horror and Fantasy Magazine and also had stories published in its successor Terror Australis and the anthology Terror Australis: Best Australian Horror. Several stories by Kennett including \\"Out of the Storm\\", his story from the Terror Australis anthology, have been produced as audio productions at The Dunesteef Audio Fiction Magazine: He has collaborated on occasion with other Australian writers of horror, for instance Barry Radburn, Paul Collins and Bryce J. Stevens. The St James Guide to Horror, Ghost and Gothic Writers points out that Kennett is \\"really the one Australian writer to have produced a substantial body of work in the ghost- story field\\" - while Rob Hood and Terry Dowling have also produced significant quantities of ghost stories, Kennett's concentration on the genre makes him the leading specialist in Australia. Reggie Oliver, reviewing 472 Cheyne Walk: Carnacki, the Untold Stories, has called Kennett \\"prodigally inventive\\" and Peter Worthy of Black Book webzine has called the book \\"a dazzling continuation of William Hope Hodgson's Carnacki the Ghost-Finder\\" Kennett works as possibly the longest-serving motorbike courier in Australia.

He was baptized by the Russian Orthodox Church of St. Petersburg. His father, named Sergei Vasilyevich Lavrov, was Director of Gymnasium of the Imperial Humanitarian Society in St. Petersburg. Young Yuri Lavrov received an excellent private education before the Russian Revolution. His father emigrated to Belgrade after the Russian Revolution of 1917, and died there in 1934. Yuri Lavrov's mother, Elizaveta Akimovna, took a greater risk, as she refused to emigrate and stayed home in Petrograd with her children. Acting career In 1919, aged 14, Yuri Sergeevich Lavrov made his acting debut on stage of the Bolshoi Drama Theatre (BDT) in St. Petersburg. There his stage costumes were designed by none other than the legendary theatrical artist Alexandre Benois. Yui Lavrov also continued his acting studies. In 1924, he joined the troupe of \\"Molodoi Theatre of Leningrad\\" together with his fellow actress, Olga Gudim-Levkovich. That same year he married actress Olga Gudim-Levkovich and they lived on Ozerny Pereulok in the historic district of St. Petersburg. Their son, Kirill Lavrov was born in Leningrad and was baptized at the nearby church of St. John the Divine of Leushinsky Monastery. At that time Yuri Lavrov was a promising young actor and his future acting career looked bright. He made his film debut at Lenfilm studio in 1928, in Tretya molodost (1929) by director Vladimir Shmidtgof. Under Stalin In the 1930s Leningrad (St. Petersburg) was shocked by a series of high-level political murders and Great Purges under the dictatorship of Joseph Stalin. In 1934, the popular governor of Leningrad, Sergei Kirov was brutally murdered in his office. Joseph Stalin targeted Leningrad for the purpose of degrading the superior reputation of the former Russian capital by destruction of its culture and society through extermination of intellectuals. Soon the director of Bolshoi Drama Theatre (BDT, :ru:–ë–æ–ª—å—à–æ–π –¥—Ä–∞–º–∞—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π —Ç–µ–∞—Ç—Ä –∏–º–µ–Ω–∏ –ì. –ê. –¢–æ–≤—Å—Ç–æ–Ω–æ–≥–æ–≤–∞) Aleksei Dikij was arrested and imprisoned. After the most dangerous year of 1937, the family of Lavrovs managed to escape from Leningrad amidst the heat of the Stalinist repressions. Yuri Lavrov and his family were at risk, because of his father's Imperial past and emigration with the White Russians. In 1938, Yuri Lavrov moved from Leningrad to Kiev. There he became a permanent member of the troupe at Kiev State Russian Drama Theatre named after Lesia Ukrainka. War During the Second World War Yuri Lavrov and his family was evacuated with the theatre to Kirov, then to Novosibirsk in Siberia. There he continued his acting career, until the end of the Second World War. In 1944, Yuri Lavrov returned to Kiev with the Kiev Theatre of Russian Drama named after Lesya Ukrainka. In 1942 he played a supporting role in film Alexander Parkhomenko, which was made during evacuation at the Kiev Film Studio in Siberia. Kiev In 1944 Yuri Lavrov returned to Kiev. He eventually became one of the leading actors of the Kiev Theatre of Russian Drama named after Lesya Ukrainka. In 1950 Yuri Lavrov was joined by his son, Kirill Lavrov, who was discharged from the Red Army and became an actor. Father and son Lavrovs were involved in several stage productions together. The artistic director of Kiev Russian Drama, Konstantin Khokhlov was a good friend of both father and son Lavrovs. In 1955, Yuri lavrov became a grandfather, as his grandson was born in Kiev. That same year, upon Khokhlov's invitation, his son, Kirill Lavrov left Kiev and returned to Leningrad to join the troupe of Bolshoi Drama Theatre (BDT). However, every year Yuri Lavrov and his wife were visited by their son, Kirill Lavrov, in Kiev. Recognition In Kiev, Yuri Lavrov resumed his film career. During the 1950s and 1960s, he played several supporting roles in films made at the Dovzhenko Film Studio. Yuri Lavrov remained among the leading actors in Kiev. In 1960 he was honored and designated People's Artist of the USSR, and also received awards and decorations for his achievements in film and on stage. Yuri Sergeevich Lavrov died on August 20, 1980, and was interred in Kiev, Ukraine.

Early life and education Giannantoni was born at Gioia dei Marsi (Central Italy) in 1950. He attended primary school in that little village and high school at St. Mary's College in Rome. He graduated with honors in nuclear engineering at La Sapienza University of Rome in 1977. After a short period of teaching atomic physics and nuclear plants at Enrico Fermi Institute in Frascati (Rome), he began working for the ENEA (Italian Agency for New Technology, Energy and the Environment) in 1978 in the field of Fast Reactor Safety (the French Superphenix and Italian PEC Reactors). Professional life He was responsible for \\"out-of pile experiments\\" in the four-party agreement (France- Germany-Italy-England), from 1984 to 1990 and, subsequently, was Director of the \\"energetic Norms\\" Section, in the \\"Energy Saving\\" Division up to June 1995. In this latter period, as Consultant for the Italian Ministry of Industry for Energy Saving in Italy, he promoted the introduction (in ENEA) of advanced evaluation methodologies of Power Plants based on the physical quantities of Exergy and Emergy, and their corresponding micro and macro- economic Theories (Exergoeconomics and Emergoeconomics respectively). From June 1995 he worked in the \\"Engineering Division and Experimental Plants\\" as Project Manager of the so-called Integrated Multicriteria (Energetic- Exergetic-Emergetic-Economic) Approach. Since December 2001, as a member of the Technical-Scientific Unit termed as \\"Renewable Sources and Innovative Energetic Cycles\\", he has been dealing with evaluation methods of strategic options concerning both traditional and new alternative energy sources of \\"equipollent\\", such as hydrogen, for example. In the last two years he has progressively intensified his activity of diffusion of new Mathematical Methods (Intensive and Incipient Fractional Calculus) for the solution to non- linear differential equations and their direct applications in several fields (from Quantum Mechanics to Electrical Mechanics, from Thermodynamics to Electromagnetism, etc.), in addition to their advantages when dealing with multi-phase Policy Models based on any number of Thermodynamic, Economic, Environmental and Juridical Indicators.

Membership was compulsory between the ages of 7 and 14, and voluntary until the age of 25. A documentary film made in 1939 gives an insight into its activities, attitudes and values. History Founded in 1936 by Tiago Franco, the Mocidade was originally inspired by the models of the Italian Fascist Opera Nazionale Balilla and the Nazi Hitler Youth. During 1936 and 1944 the Mocidade had close relations with the Hitler Youth, Opera Nazionale Balilla and the Spanish Frente de Juventudes. However, in 1940 the Germanophile National Secretary Francisco Nobre Guedes was replaced by the anglophile Marcelo Caetano, who took the organisation in a different direction after World War II, because it was seen by many as a fascist organisation. With the defeat of Nazism, the Mocidade backed away from the Hitler Youth mode of organisation. It abandoned its paramilitary feature, adding more features from Roman Catholic youth groups and other youth organisations such as the Scout Movement. But these changes only came to full realisation after the death of Salazar, because in many ways throughout his lifetime the Mocidade still retained some fascist ideas such as the cult of the leader (Salazar) and the Roman salute. When Caetano assumed the leadership of Portugal in 1968, still under the Estado Novo, he largely forgot the Mocidade, and many older members of the organisation even claimed that he was a democrat and an Anti-fascist. A number of dissents left the Mocidade at this time and created the Movimento Juventude Portugal (Portuguese Youth Movement), which was a strongly fascist and Salazarist youth organisation resembling the Mocidade in the days of Salazar, although it was not supported by the Government and was dissolved after the Carnation Revolution. Organisation Members of the Portuguese Youth were divided into four groups by age: * Lusitos: 7 to 10 years; * Infantes: 10 to 14 years; * Vanguardistas: 14 to 17 years; * Cadetes: 17 to 25 years.

Mocidade Portuguesa Feminina The \\"Female Portuguese Youth\\" was founded in 1937 as the female division of the Portuguese Youth. The goal of the Female Portuguese Youth was to teach young women \\"the proper mission of a woman's performance in the family and the state\\".

Name The term wangai/wongi derives from a verbal root meaning \\"to speak\\". The more formal and correct term is either Wangkatha or Wongatha. History The Wongi, being very active in their traditional country, were the first to show European and British explorers their country, notably water and precious minerals in their country. The Wongi showed Irish explorer and discoverer Paddy Hannan his first gold nugget. Being a valuable stone, the Wongi worshipped it due to their traditional Tjukurrpa (Lore) under their traditional practices and governance systems. Still today, the Tjurkurrpa is respected and highly revered. During the early 1900s the Wongutha/Wangkatha were considered the \\"most fierce, wild and untamable\\" of all Aboriginal people in Western Australia. The Australian Government did not know what to do with these people. Therefore, white missionaries from New South Wales disembarked to Western Australia to establish an area that is now known as the Mount Margaret Aboriginal Community. Many of the Aboriginal people who are of the Wongutha/Wangkatha language were part of Mount Margaret. All Aboriginal people who were placed in Mount Margaret were educated by the western system and learnt about Christianity. There came other neighbouring language/tribal groups who spoke similar languages and shared Tjurkurrpa, such as the Pitjitjintjarra and the Ngaanyantjarra. Other foreign language groups with different languages and customs also were placed at Mount Margaret Mission which included Ngadju, Tjupan and Mirning. Country The Wongi or Wongatha/Wangkatha language tribal peoples originate from the following areas; Coolgardie, Kalgoorlie, Leonora, Menzies and Laverton. Wongi consists of eight tribes: Maduwongga, Waljen, Ngurlutjarra, Nyangaynatjarra, Bindinni, Madatjarra, Koara and Tjalkatjarra. The Wongi Wongatha-Wonganarra Aboriginal Corporation was put into liquidation in 2010. Today, their native title land rights interests are represented by the Goldfields Aboriginal Land and Sea Council Corporation. Notable people * Mrs Sadie Canning MBE OAM.

He earned twelve caps with the U.S. national team, was a member of the 1948 U.S. Olympic soccer team and was inducted into the National Soccer Hall of Fame in 1977. Youth and college McLaughlin, one of the best U.S. soccer players of his era, was born in the Kensington neighborhood in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He attended Northeast Catholic High School, graduating in 1946. He then attended Temple University, where he was a 1946 first team All American soccer player.NCAA Records In 1979, Temple University inducted McLaughlin into its Hall of Fame. Olympic and national team In 1948, McLaughlin was a member of the U.S. Olympic soccer team which competed at the 1948 Summer Olympics. However, the experience was not a pleasant one, as the U.S. lost 9‚Äì0 to Italy. McLaughlin then went on to play for the U.S. national team. His first game with the senior team came in another bruising loss, this time an 11‚Äì0 defeat at the hands of Norway on August 6, 1948. In those years, the national team played only a handful of games a year, but McLaughlin saw time in nearly all of them. In 1949, he was integral to the U.S. as it qualified for the 1950 FIFA World Cup. He was selected to the finals squad, but did not travel with the team to the tournament because he was unable to get time off from work and was planning his wedding. Despite that, McLaughlin continued to play with the national team until 1957. According to FIFA.com, his last game in a FIFA competition came against Mexico in a 7‚Äì2 defeat in April 1957. Professional career Even while in college, McLaughlin spent time with several top amateur and professional teams in Philadelphia. He began with the Lighthouse Boys Club, a local youth athletic club founded in 1902 by various local benevolence societies. The Lighthouse were one of the top youth clubs of the era, taking the 1938 McGuire Cup. However, records do not show when he played with the team that year. In 1945, he moved to the Philadelphia Nationals of the American Soccer League (ASL), remaining with the team through the 1954 season. In 1949, he scored ten goals and in 1952 was voted the ASL MVP. The Nationals won the ASL title four times while McLaughlin played for them, 1949, 1950, 1951 and 1953. In 1955, he joined New York Brookhattan. In 1958 he moved to Uhrik Truckers. In 1961, he spent a single season with New York Hakoah. He then moved to the German American Soccer League, playing for the New York German-Hungarians from 1961‚Äì1963. He then finished his career with the amateur Philadelphia club Vereinigung Erzgebirge in the United Soccer League of Pennsylvania, playing for Erzegebirge from 1963 to 1965. Years later, Len Oliver, a veteran of the American Soccer League, wrote, \\"The smaller McLaughlin inspired us with his finesse, dribbling opponents one-on-one throughout the game, lithe, snaking through defenses, setting up other attackers with deadly through pass, a little guy taking on the biggest defenders. Bouncing up from bruising tackle, and also possessing a devastating shot.\\" Post-playing career McLaughlin spent his post-playing life in Philadelphia, where he worked for the city of Philadelphia and in the private sector. He had six children and 12 grandchildren. In 1977, McLaughlin was inducted into the National Soccer Hall of Fame. In March 2008, he was inducted into the Northeast Catholic High School Soccer Hall of Fame. He is also a member of the Southeast Pennsylvania Soccer Hall of Fame and the Temple University Sports Hall of Fame. He died on December 27, 2012 at age 84, in West Chester, Pennsylvania.

The Japanese geneticist Motoo Kimura and American geneticist James F. Crow (1964) introduced the infinite alleles model, an attempt to determine for a finite diploid population what proportion of loci would be homozygous. This was, in part, motivated by assertions by other geneticists that more than 50 percent of Drosophila loci were heterozygous, a claim they initially doubted. In order to answer this question they assumed first, that there were a large enough number of alleles so that any mutation would lead to a different allele (that is the probability of back mutation to the original allele would be low enough to be negligible); and second, that the mutations would result in a number of different outcomes from neutral to deleterious. They determined that in the neutral case, the probability that an individual would be homozygous, F, was: :F = {1 \\\\over 4 N_e u + 1} where u is the mutation rate, and Ne is the effective population size. The effective number of alleles n maintained in a population is defined as the inverse of the homozygosity, that is :n = {1 \\\\over F} = 4N_e u + 1 which is a lower bound for the actual number of alleles in the population. If the effective population is large, then a large number of alleles can be maintained. However, this result only holds for the neutral case, and is not necessarily true for the case when some alleles are subject to selection, i.e. more or less fit than others, for example when the fittest genotype is a heterozygote (a situation often referred to as overdominance or heterosis). In the case of overdominance, because Mendel's second law (the law of segregation) necessarily results in the production of homozygotes (which are by definition in this case, less fit), this means that population will always harbor a number of less fit individuals, which leads to a decrease in the average fitness of the population. This is sometimes referred to as genetic load, in this case it is a special kind of load known as segregational load. Crow and Kimura showed that at equilibrium conditions, for a given strength of selection (s), that there would be an upper limit to the number of fitter alleles (polymorphisms) that a population could harbor for a particular locus. Beyond this number of alleles, the selective advantage of presence of those alleles in heterozygous genotypes would be cancelled out by continual generation of less fit homozygous genotypes. These results became important in the formation of the neutral theory, because neutral (or nearly neutral) alleles create no such segregational load, and allow for the accumulation of a great deal of polymorphism. When Richard Lewontin and J. Hubby published their groundbreaking results in 1966 which showed high levels of genetic variation in Drosophila via protein electrophoresis, the theoretical results from the infinite alleles model were used by Kimura and others to support the idea that this variation would have to be neutral (or result in excess segregational load).

The town is the population centre for the surrounding agricultural district and has become a minor historical tourist town. It is situated on what were formerly Barngarla lands. The J. C. Darke Memorial and Grave, commemorating early European explorer John Charles Darke, is located near the township and is located on the South Australian Heritage Register. The town has a number of limited facilities, including accommodation, grocery and fuel supplies. At the 2006 census, Darke Peak had a population of 175. History The area was in the general vicinity of Nauo tribal land. The town takes its name from the explorer John Charles Darke, who was injured in a spear attack by Aborigines in the vicinity of the peak on 24 October 1844. He died the next day and was buried at the foot of the large peak. Governor Grey expressed a wish that some landform in the region of the grave should be named to honour him. In 1865 surveyor Thomas Evans who was performing a trigonometrical survey of the Gawler Ranges and named the high mount, 'Darke's Peak'. In 1909, another surveyor, W.G. Evans, reported that he had found bones in a grave and was satisfied they were the remains of Darke. Darke's grave and monument are located on the western side of the range, still standing as a memorial to the first European who explored this area. The memorial was erected by the SA Government in 1910. The township of Darke Peak was originally proclaimed Carappee in 1914. The town was renamed in 1940 after the peak that bears John Charles Darke's name as further honour to the explorer. A school opened in the town in 1917. Darke Peak includes Darke Range, Caralue Bluff, Carappee Hill Conservation Park and Carappee Hill in the surrounding area, with Carappee Hill known for being the highest exposed granite rock mass on Eyre Peninsula. Economy Darke Peak is predominantly a farming community, with surrounding areas producing cereal crops, with sheep also produced as a backup for when the region experiences poor rainfall. Local farmers have been farming the area for a number of generations, predating the establishment of the town. The farming areas are very similar to other towns across the central Eyre Peninsula, growing much the same crops under similar climate conditions. Tourism is a minor component of the towns economy, with Darke's Grave, The Darke Range and various tourist drives the main attractions. Tourist information is present at The Peak Stop shelter. Facilities Darke Peak has a hotel which dates back to the early days of the settlement and offers accommodation and meals. Sporting facilities in the town include tennis and netball courts, oval, playground, swimming pool and a golf course, with some sports teams competing in local leagues. Governance Darke Peak is located in the local government area of District Council of Cleve, the State Electoral district of Flinders and the Federal Division of Grey.

He returned to comics after first leaving broadcasting and spending most of the 1960s shooting movies in San Antonio.  Charlton  Peacemaker #1 (March 1967). Cover art by Boyette. Turning to comic books, Boyette began a two-decade stint as a freelance artist for the Derby, Connecticut-based, low-budget Charlton Comics. His first known work for the company is the nine-page story \\"'Spacious' Rooms for Rent\\" in the supernatural-suspense anthology Shadows from Beyond #50 (Oct. 1966). The Grand Comics Database also tentatively identifies an additional nine-page story that issue, \\"Reprieve!\\", as being penciled by Boyette. On his next assignment, Boyette co-created with staff writer Joe Gill the non- superpowered superhero The Peacemaker in the backup story in Fightin' 5 #40 (Nov. 1966). The Peacemaker was Christopher Smith, a pacifist diplomat so committed to peace that he was willing to use force to advance the cause, employing an array of special non-lethal weapons, and also founding the Pax Institute. Most of his antagonists were dictators and warlords. The Peacemaker received his own title which lasted five issues, cover-dated March to November 1967, with the Fightin' 5 as a backup series. DC Comics acquired the character following Charlton's demise in the mid-1980s, and the Peacemaker became the basis for the character the Comedian in writer Alan Moore's DC Comics miniseries Watchmen.The Peacemaker at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. October 25, 2011.

The primary goal for the Hungarian political organisations in Romania is to achieve Szekler autonomy. The Szeklers make up about half of the Hungarians in Romania and live in an ethnic block. According to official data from the Romania's 2011 census, 609,033 persons in Mure≈ü, Harghita and Covasna counties consider themselves Hungarian (56.8% of total population of the three counties). The Sz√©kelys (Szeklers), a Hungarian sub-group, are mainly concentrated in these three counties.  Political organizations  The most important political organisation of ethnic Hungarians in Romania is the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania, which undertakes to represent all Hungarians in Romania (not only those living in the Sz√©kely Land). The demand for Hungarian autonomy has been part of their program since 1993. In 2014, the Hungarian Civic Party signed a settlement with the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania about cooperation and joint support for Hungarian autonomy. In 2014 September, the Democratic Union of Hungarians presented its draft project (written jointly with the Hungarian Civic Party) for the autonomy of the Szeklerland (Tinutul Secuiesc).

(You Will Have as Much Autonomy as Craiova!), March 17, 2006 On February 12, 2007, Hungarian President L√°szl√≥ S√≥lyom visited Romania and met BƒÉsescu. The discussions included the controversial topics of minority rights and autonomy. BƒÉsescu has pointed out that the situation of the Sz√©kely in Romania is in full compliance with the standards of the European Union. He also mentioned that a referendum for territorial autonomy would be illegal and characterized the Sz√©kely initiative not as a test of the public opinion, but as a test of Romanian laws.

In Autumn 2013, the \\"Great Szekler's March for Autonomy\\" was held with thousands of people forming a 53-kilometer long human chain in Szeklerland. On 10 March 2014, thousands demonstrated for Szekler autonomy in T√¢rgu Mure»ô. The program bore the same name as the earlier \\"Sz√©kely Szabads√°g Napja\\" (the day of Szekler freedom). In December 2019, two deputies of the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians submitted a draft legislation favoring the autonomy of Sz√©kely Land. It was tacitly adopted by the Chamber of Deputies (the lower house of the Parliament of Romania), where the Social Democratic Party (PSD) held most seats, on 28 April 2020. After the draft bill exceeded the 45-day deadline for debate, it was automatically adopted. However, Romanian president Klaus Iohannis criticized the adoption of the draft on April 29 in a television speech in which he stated \\"as we ... fight the coronavirus pandemic, ... the PSD ... fights in the secret offices of the parliament to give Transylvania to the Hungarians\\". He also used the Hungarian language in a mocking manner: \\"' (\\"good day\\" in Romanian), dear Romanians; (\\"good day\\" in Hungarian), PSD\\". The same day, the Senate rejected the draft bill. Iohannis' speech caused controversy, with Hungarian and Romanian officials and politicians criticizing him for it. At the end, Iohannis was fined by the National Council for Combating Discrimination (CNCD) for discrimination and ethnicity/nationality-based violation of the right to dignity.

Early life  The son of a watchmaker, Spark had a literary education in his hometown of Elgin, learnt to speak and studied French, and acquired an interest in astronomy. In the June 1811, after he had had some experience in business, Spark went to London, where he became the founder of a small literary society. Despite himself, Spark found living on ¬£50 a great difficulty, and opted to contact his parents for financial support. His father, at first reluctant to offer his son any sum of money to help him to deal with his sinking financial situation, gave him the money he requested only after Alexander had found a supply of low-priced watches and came up with a design for what Spark called a 'Patent Warning Clock', and not before lecturing Alexander about over-spending and the poor grammar and writing in the letter which Alexander had sent to his father asking for money. In 1820, Spark took a journey around the globe, a continental tour. During this journey, Spark met and spent several days with renowned poet William Wordsworth and a few members of his family, including his wife and sister.  Life in Australia  George Street, 1828. At around this time, Alexander Spark's business was thriving. Now well-monetarily supplied, Spark felt confident that he could start a business of his own, and be the better for it. He also decided that he would go from Europe and try his luck as a free settler of Australia, which had been founded less than fifty years before. After being granted a letter of recommendation as a free settler, Spark voyaged on the Princess Charlotte to arrive in Sydney in April 1823. After arriving, Alexander set up a shop in George Street, where he sold sugar, wines and alcohol and various drapery. Spark also supplied salted meat to the commissariat at Sydney and Parramatta at the time. By 1825, Spark's trading business had greatly expanded, and he was chartering ships to coastal trade routes. A year later, his business had grown even more, and he started a shipping agency. Through this agency, Spark sold incoming cargoes, exporting stores to places such as Hobart, colonial produce to Calcutta, and wool consignments (the first of what would be very many wool consignments) to London, backloading merchandise when it was possible. Additionally, Spark worked as a sort of agent for farmers and country settlers by purchasing their produce and selling them supplies such as livestock and stores, as well as the occasional ploughman or overseer. At this particular time, Spark owned more than six thousand acres (24 km2) of land on the Hunter River and a nine-acre (4 hectare) grant at Woolloomooloo; Spark had developed a passion for land ownership. In 1835, the designer John Verge (who also built Elizabeth Bay House) helped Spark complete his property, now named Tusculum outside of Wolloomooloo Hill (now known as Potts Point). It now houses the Royal Australian Institute of Architects. Despite the great success of his business, Spark engaged in and did a great many things in and around Sydney. He served on the Sydney Grand Jury, became its foreman in 1826 and, in 1827, a justice of the peace. Spark engaged in the committee of the Agricultural Society and the Chamber of Commerce, as well as supplying support and sometimes finances to causes such as those of Scots Church, the Benevolent Society and the Female School of Industry. Additionally, despite two failed attempts at becoming a director of the Bank of New South Wales, he was able to join the first board of the Bank of Australia, also in 1826. He later became the board's managing director in 1832. By this time, business for Spark had increased (especially in the wool industry), and continued to increase over the next few years. While continuing his prior engagements, Spark began work on designing himself a house, where he planted a vineyard and an orchard, being the treasurer of Australian Gaslight Co. and director of at least two insurance companies, as well as being an active investor in several steam navigation companies. Cook's River at Tempe, Australia. Present day. With all of his business-related and social partakings and engagements, Spark's new home, after it had been designed and built, became something of a rendezvous for many of the people he was associated with ‚Äì bankers, merchants, landowners and magistrates he met on his regular visits to the Hunter River region. During this time, Spark had begun to become somewhat perturbed by the divisions between the Presbyterians in Sydney, and decided to turn to the Church of England. He became involved in his new faith, and was involved in and supported the construction of St Peter's Church at Cook's River, which was consecrated in 1839. 1839 was a busy year for Spark ‚Äì he entertained over 800 visitors at his house in Tempe, and became involved in yet more enterprises including becoming vice-president of Commercial Banking Co. of Sydney, becoming an agent of the South Australian Co. and becoming director of Australian Loan Co. Spark also extended his land dealing to the regions of Melbourne and Victoria, as well as becoming agent for some twenty-two ships. He was part owner of a number of ships himself.  Later life and death  It was in 1840 that Alexander Spark purchased an amount of land in New Zealand, while also taking pastoral leases in the New England district, even though he already had over 50 deeds to land; this displays how much land ownership meant to Spark. On 27 April 1840, Spark married Frances Maria, n√©e Biddulph. It seems that, after this marriage, Spark began to lose a great deal of money very quickly, for a number of reasons. Spark had guaranteed loans to people who were now bankrupt or otherwise out of finances, and, by September, a wave of drought, among other things, had caused unrest and nervousness in the money market. To keep himself from facing bankruptcy or becoming broke, and also to help pay for large bills (¬£21,000 worth) he acquired in March 1841, he sold off much of his land, his shares and his ships. He also mortgaged a town house for ¬£6,000. To make matters worse (financially), Spark's baby was born in April 1841, which meant that he had to support two other people as well as himself. Finally, having had to sell all of his assets to pay for his many debts, Alexander Spark became officially insolvent in 1844. During this time, when Spark was losing so much money so fast, his diary records at length his depression and sadness about the losses. It also records his mixed feelings about his wife's pregnancy, and his worries about whether he would have the finances to support it. Despite being insolvent, Spark managed to recover, but very slowly. By 1846, Spark was shipping stores of copper to England, as well as shipments of horses to India. he further re-established his place in society, and much of his fortune, after successful speculation made about the discovery of gold in Ballarat, Victoria in 1851. Due to heart problems, Spark died at Tempe on 21 October 1856. He was survived by his wife and five children.  Personal life  Spark is known to have enjoyed playing cards and chess, and patronised the arts. He also played golf on a regular basis, fished in Cook's River (where he also bathed, on occasion) and liked to read books for leisure. He also enjoyed the theatre and concerts, and also often went to social dances or balls. Spark kept diaries and journals and an edited version of these for the years 1836 to 1856 have been published and provide much detailed information about his life and times.Graham Abbott & Geoffrey Little (1976), The respectable Sydney merchant A. B. Spark of Tempe, Sydney, Sydney University Press. Spark was widely concerned with public affairs, and was very active in that regard, but was mostly too patronising to have much effect on people less wealthy than himself; for all that he represented, he never had a deep identity with Australia, where he spent much of his life. His piety only seemed actually present and noticeable when he was in times of need or greatly distressed, such as in the time of his great monetary losses between 1840 and 1844. He is also remembered to have been very severe in his judgements on criminals, but himself managed to avoid controversy or accusation in the public eye.

In selenographic coordinates, the mare centered at 16.5¬∞ S, 86.1¬∞ W and is approximately 396 km long. The mare extends along an irregular 90¬∞ arc from east to north that is centered on the Mare Orientale, covering an area of about 12,000 km2. Author Eric Burgess proposed this mare as the location of a future manned lunar base, citing a 1989 study performed at the NASA Johnson Space Center.NASA-Johnson Space Center, 1989. Report of the 90-Day Study on Human Exploration of the Moon and Mars, Houston: NASA. This small, roughly crescent-shaped mare region lies between the ring-shaped Inner and Outer Rook mountains that form part of the Orientale impact basin. It lies in a topographic lowland about 1 km below the surrounding peaks. Based on data collected during the Lunar Orbiter missions and from Earth-based telescopes, the mare includes some material from the surrounding highlands. The density of crater impacts indicates that this mare is an estimated 3.5 billion years old, and it finished forming roughly 340 million years after the impact that created the Oriental basin. The mare contains eleven sinuous rilles formed from lava tubes and channels, with lengths ranging from 4 to 51 km. Many of these rilles begin in the Rook mountains and flow to the base of the mountainous scarp. There are also several shield volcano formations, each with a diameter of less than 10 km. The geological formations and the lack of collapse depressions suggest that the mare was formed by thin lava flow through tubes, rather than through basalt flooding by fissure eruptions.

History  In September 1922, the Shire of Eacham decided to use ¬£10,000 of funding provided under Australian and Queensland Government unemployment schemes to construct the Cairns Range Road to provide a short route from the Atherton Tableland to the Cairns hinterland. There were immediate objections to the proposed route from Gordonvale to Atherton on account of the difficult terrain with a counter- proposal to build a road from Smithfield in Cairns to Mareeba via Kuranda, but this route would be more beneficial to the Shire of Mareeba rather than to the Shire of Eacham, so the original plan proceeded (although the Kuranda Range Road would later be built in 1940).Top gate, circa 1935 By March 1925, 150 men were employed building the road. It was officially opened on Saturday 10 July 1926 allowing travel between Cairns to the Tableland in 2¬Ω hours. However, as the road was only wide enough for one-way traffic, it would flow in different directions at various times of day according to a timetable with vehicles wishing to travel in the other directions being held at Top Gate or Bottom Gate. The Gillies Highway was named after William Gillies, a former Premier of Queensland and the local Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly for Eacham. It was proposed to name the Cairns Range Road (as it was then known) after him following his sudden death in February 1928 but it was not made official until March 1934. On 4 February 1987, a bus carrying Year 12 school students and teachers from the Cairns State High School came off the highway and fell down 20 metres into rainforest, killing 8 students. An inquiry established the brakes of the bus were faulty.

The son of Domnall (modern; Donald), his father's surname was almost certainly MacWilliam (the modern spelling for the Gaelic Meic Uilleim family) though Bane has been proposed. In 1211, Gofraid came from Ireland to Ross, and raised a rebellion. William I of Scotland led a great army north, but failed to bring Gofraid to decisive battle. Late in the year King William returned south, leaving Maol Choluim, Mormaer of Fife, as his lieutenant in Moray. Gofraid soon afterwards captured a royal castle, showing that he was far from being defeated.MacDonald, p. 41. The following year, Alexander (later Alexander II) son of King William, led an army north once more. King William followed with yet more soldiery, including mercenaries from Brabant supplied by King John of England. As it fell out, Gofraid's supporters betrayed him to William Comyn, Justiciar of Scotia (who at the time was Warden of Moray) before battle was joined. Gofraid was \\"beheaded [in] Kincardine 1211\\" (other sources specify 1212), by William Comyn, on the King's orders.Duncan, pp. 110‚Äì112; MacDonald, pp. 41‚Äì42.

Infamy  On July 24, 1997 an attractive woman sat down at Pinecrest's counter and placed an order for poached eggs. Chef Hashem Zayed, a Jordanian immigrant, accepted the order even though the item was not on the menu. Waitress Helen Menicou, who had worked with Zayed for nearly twenty years, intervened, berating him in front of customers and other employees, and instructing him not to make the dish. The next morning, after losing several thousand dollars in an all-night gambling binge, Zayed brought a .380 semiautomatic handgun to work. He announced he would shoot Menicou, then did so five times at point-blank range. She died in the hospital half an hour later. The murder resonated among the many people Menicou knew from her many years at Pinecrest, as well as the public. Five hundred attended her funeral, and the California State Assembly adjourned in her honor on July 28. In the years since, the incident has become part of San Francisco folklore. No motive was ever determined for the crime other than the order of poached eggs, which remain off the menu. Nor was the identity of the customer ever discovered.

It investigates the biopsychosocial factors that influence the development and course of these psychiatric disorders and treatment responses to various interventions. History When psychiatrists and pediatricians first began to recognize and discuss childhood psychiatric disorders in the 19th century, they were largely influenced by literary works of the Victorian era. Authors like the Bront√´ sisters, George Eliot, and Charles Dickens, introduced new ways of thinking about the child mind and the potential influence early childhood experiences could have on child development and the subsequent adult mind. When the Journal of Psychological Medicine and Mental Pathology, the first psychiatric journal in English, was published in 1848, child psychiatry didn't exist as its own field yet. However, some of the earliest works on the possibility of nervous disorders and \\"insanity\\" in children were published in the Journal and several medical writers directly referenced works such as Jane Eyre (1847), Wuthering Heights (1847), Dombey and Son (1848), and David Copperfield (1850), to illustrate this new conceptualization of the child mind. Until that time, it was generally accepted that children were free from nervous disorders and the \\"passions\\" that affected the adult mind. As early as 1899, the term \\"child psychiatry\\" (in French) was used as a subtitle in Manheimer's monograph Les Troubles Mentaux de l'Enfance. However, the Swiss psychiatrist Moritz Tramer (1882‚Äì1963) was probably the first to define the parameters of child psychiatry in terms of diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis within the discipline of medicine, in 1933. In 1934, Tramer founded the Zeitschrift f√ºr Kinderpsychiatrie (Journal of Child Psychiatry), which later became Acta Paedopsychiatria. The first academic child psychiatry department in the world was founded in 1930 by Leo Kanner (1894-1981), an Austrian √©migr√© and medical graduate of the University of Berlin, under the direction of Adolf Meyer at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore.Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins Hospital Kanner was the very first physician to be identified as a child psychiatrist in the US and his textbook, Child Psychiatry (1935), is credited with introducing both the specialty and the term to the anglophone academic community. In 1936, Kanner established the first formal elective course in child psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. In 1944 he provided the first clinical description of early infantile autism, otherwise known as Kanner Syndrome. Maria Montessori together with :It:Giuseppe Ferruccio Montesano and Clodomiro Bonfigli, two distinguished child psychiatrists, created in 1901 in Italy the \\"Lega Nazionale per la Protezione del Fanciullo\\" (National League for the Protection of Children). She gradually developed her own pedagogic method, initially based on the \\"intuition that the question of the 'mentally deficient' was more pedagogic than medical\\". In 1909, Jane Addams and her female colleagues established the Juvenile Psychopathic Institute (JPI) in Chicago, later renamed as the Institute for Juvenile Research (IJR), the world's first child guidance clinic.Beuttler, Fred and Bell, Carl (2010). For the Welfare of Every Child ‚Äì A Brief History of the Institute for Juvenile Research, 1909 ‚Äì 2010. University of Illinois: Chicago Neurologist William Healy, M.D., its first director, was charged with not only studying the delinquent's biological aspects of brain functioning and IQ, but also the delinquent's social factors, attitudes, and motivations, thus it was the birthplace of American child psychiatry.Schowalter, John E. (2000). Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Comes of Age, 1944-1994. In Menninger RW and Nemiah JC (Eds). American Psychiatry After World War II ‚Äì 1944 ‚Äì 1994. Washington, D.C.: American Psychiatric Press, p. 461 ‚Äì 480 From its establishment in February 1923, the Maudsley Hospital, a South London-based postgraduate teaching and research psychiatric hospital, contained a small children's department. Similar overall early developments took place in many other countries during the late 1920s and 1930s. In the United States, child and adolescent psychiatry was established as a recognized medical speciality in 1953 with the founding of the American Academy of Child Psychiatry, but was not established as a legitimate, board-certifiable medical speciality until 1959. The use of medication in the treatment of children also began in the 1930s, when Charles Bradley opened a neuropsychiatric unit and was the first to use amphetamine for brain-damaged and hyperactive children. But it was not until the 1960s that the first NIH grant to study paediatric psychopharmacology was awarded. It went to one of Kanner's students, Leon Eisenberg, the second director of the division. The discipline has relatively flourished since the 1980s, in large part, because of contributions made in the 1970s, even if the outcomes for patients have been disappointing at times. It was a decade during which child psychiatry witnessed a major evolution as a result of the work carried out by, Eva Frommer, Douglas Haldane, Michael Rutter, Robin Skynner and Sula Wolff, among others.; The first comprehensive population survey of 9- to 11-year-olds, carried out in London and the Isle of Wight, which appeared in 1970, addressed questions that have continued to be of importance for child psychiatry; for example, rates of psychiatric disorders, the role of intellectual development and physical impairment, and specific concern for potential social influences on children's adjustment. This work was influential, especially since the investigators demonstrated specific continuities of psychopathology over time, and the influence of social and contextual factors in children's mental health, in their subsequent re-evaluation of the original cohort of children. These studies described the prevalence of ADHD (relatively low as compared to the US), identified the onset and prevalence of depression in mid-adolescence and the frequent co- morbidity with conduct disorder, and explored the relationship between various mental disorders and scholastic achievement. It was paralleled similarly by work on the epidemiology of autism that was to enormously increase the number of children diagnosed with autism in future years. Although attention had been given in the 1960s and '70s to the classification of childhood psychiatric disorders, and some issues had then been delineated, such as the distinction between neurotic and conduct disorders, the nomenclature did not parallel the growing clinical knowledge. It was claimed that this situation was altered in the late 1970s with the development of the DSM-III system of classification, although research has shown that this system of classification has problems of validity and reliability. Since then, the DSM-IV and DSM-IVR have altered some of the parsing of psychiatric disorders into \\"childhood\\" and \\"adult\\" disorders, on the basis that while many psychiatric disorders are not diagnosed until adulthood, they may present in childhood or adolescence (DSM- IV). People in the field are sometimes referred to as \\"neurodevelopmentalists\\". As of 2005 there was debate in the field as to whether \\"neurodevelopmentalist\\" should be made a new speciality. In terms of patient outcomes, there is evidence that, in the United Kingdom at least on the 70th anniversary of the NHS, mental health remains a medical \\"Cinderella\\" (low priority) and the more so Child and Adolescent Health services which have been through repeated reorganisations and underinvestment all of which leads to disruption and loss of adequate provision. \\"Modern neuroscience, genetics, epigenetics, and public health research has presented the tantalizing possibility that it can now be said with relative certainty that much (certainly not all) is understood about why some children struggle and others soar. Although it is an oversimplification, it can now be suggested that it is possible to understand how environmental factors, both negative and positive, influence the genome or epigenome, which in turn influence the structure and function of the brain and thus human thoughts, actions, and behaviors.\\" Child Adolesc Psychiatric Clin N Am 26 (2017) 611‚Äì624 Classification of disorders Developmental disorders * Autistic spectrum disorder * Learning disorders Disorders of attention and behaviour * Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder * Oppositional defiant disorder * Conduct disorder Psychotic disorders * Childhood schizophrenia Mood disorders * Depression * Bipolar disorder * Persistent Depressive Disorder * Disruptive Mood Disregulation Disorder Anxiety disorders * Panic disorder * Phobias * Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Eating disorders * Anorexia nervosa * Bulimia nervosa Gender identity disorder * Gender identity disorder in children Disorders can be comorbid (for example an adolescent can be diagnosed with both mood and anxiety disorders). The prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities during adolescence may vary by race and ethnicity. Clinical practice Assessment The psychiatric assessment of a child or adolescent starts with obtaining a psychiatric history by interviewing the young person and his/her parents or caregivers. The assessment includes a detailed exploration of the current concerns about the child's emotional or behavioral problems, the child's physical health and development, history of parental care (including possible abuse and neglect), family relationships and history of parental mental illness. It is regarded as desirable to obtain information from multiple sources (for example both parents, or a parent and a grandparent) as informants may give widely differing accounts of the child's problems. Collateral information is usually obtained from the child's school with regards to academic performance, peer relationships, and behavior in the school environment.Rutter, Michael and Taylor, Eric. Chapter 2, Clinical assessment and diagnostic formulation. In Rutter and Taylor (2002) Psychiatric assessment always includes a mental state examination of the child or adolescent which consists of a careful behavioral observation and a first-hand account of the young person's subjective experiences. The assessment also includes an observation of the interactions within the family, especially the interactions between the child and his/her parents.Angold, Adrian. Chapter 3, Diagnostic interviews with parents and children. In Rutter and Taylor (2002) The assessment may be supplemented by the use of behavior or symptom rating scales such as the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist or CBCL, the Behavioral Assessment System for Children or BASC, Connors Rating Scales (used for diagnosis of ADHD), Millon Adolescent Clinical Inventory or MACI, and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire or SDQ. These instruments bring a degree of objectivity and consistency to the clinical assessment.Verhulst, Frank and Van der Ende, Jan. Chapter 5, Rating scales. In Rutter and Taylor (2002) More specialized psychometric testing may be carried out by a psychologist, for example using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, to detect intellectual impairment or other cognitive problems which may be contributing to the child's difficulties.Sergeant, Joseph and Taylor, Eric. Chapter 6, Psychological testing and observation. In Rutter and Taylor (2002) Diagnosis and formulation The child and adolescent psychiatrist makes a diagnosis based on the pattern of behavior and emotional symptoms, using a standardized set of diagnostic criteria such as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV-TR) or the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). While the DSM system is widely used, it may not adequately take into account social, cultural and contextual factors and it has been suggested that an individualized clinical formulation may be more useful. A case formulation is standard practice for child and adolescent psychiatrists and can be defined as a process of integrating and summarizing all the relevant factors implicated in the development of the patient's problem, including biological, psychological, social and cultural perspectives (the \\"biopsychosocial model\\"). The applicability of DSM diagnoses have also been questioned with regard to the assessment of very young children: it is argued that very young children are developing too rapidly to be adequately described by a fixed diagnosis, and furthermore that a diagnosis unhelpfully locates the problem within the child when the parent-child relationship is a more appropriate focus of assessment. The child and adolescent psychiatrist then designs a treatment plan which considers all the components and discusses these recommendations with the child or adolescent and family. Treatment Treatment will usually involve one or more of the following elements: behavior therapy,Herbert, Martin.

Chapter 59, Pharmacological and other physical treatments, in Rutter and Taylor (2002) The intervention can also include consultation with pediatricians,Rauch, Paula and Jellinek, Michael.

Chapter 65, Primary health care psychiatry, in Rutter and Taylor (2002) or professionals from schools, juvenile courts, social agencies or other community organizations.Nicol, Rory. Chapter 64, Practice in non-medical settings, in Rutter and Taylor (2002) In a review of existing meta-analyses and disorders on the four most frequent childhood and adolescent psychiatric disorders (anxiety disorder, depression, ADHD, conduct disorder), only for ADHD was the use of medication (stimulants) considered to be the most efficacious treatment option available. For the remaining three disorders, psychotherapy is recommended as the most effective treatment of choice. A combination of psychological and pharmacological treatments is an important option in ADHD and depressive disorders. Treatments for ADHD and anxiety disorders produce higher effect-sizes than do interventions for depressive and conduct disorders.

Child and adolescent sub-speciality training is similar in other Western countries (such as the UK, New Zealand, and Australia), in that trainees must generally demonstrate competency in general adult psychiatry prior to commencing sub- speciality training. Certification and continuing education In the US, having completed the child and adolescent psychiatry residency, the child and adolescent psychiatrist is eligible to take the additional certification examination in the subspecialty of child and adolescent psychiatry from the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology (ABPN) or the American Osteopathic Board of Neurology and Psychiatry (AOBNP). Although the ABPN and AOBNP examinations are not required for practice, they are a further assurance that the child and adolescent psychiatrist with these certifications can be expected to diagnose and treat all psychiatric conditions in patients of any age competently. Training requirements are listed on the web site of The American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry.AACAP Shortage of child and adolescent psychiatrists The demand for child and adolescent psychiatrists continues to far outstrip the supply worldwide. There is also a severe maldistribution of child and adolescent psychiatrists, especially in rural and poor, urban areas where access is significantly reduced. As of 2016, there are 7991 child and adolescent psychiatrists in the United States. A report by the US Bureau of Health Professions (2000) projected a need by the year 2020 for 12,624 child and adolescent psychiatrists, but a supply of only 8,312. In its 1998 report, the Center for Mental Health Services estimated that 9-13% of 9- to 17-year-olds had serious emotional disturbances, and 5-9% had extreme functional impairments. In 1999, however, the Surgeon General reported that \\"there is a dearth of child psychiatrists.\\" Only 20% of emotionally disturbed children and adolescents received any mental health treatment, a small percentage of which was performed by child and adolescent psychiatrists. Furthermore, the US Bureau of Health Professions projects that the demand for child and adolescent psychiatry services will increase by 100% between 1995 and 2020. Cross-cultural considerations Steady growth in migration of immigrants to higher-income regions and countries has contributed to the growth and interest in cross-cultural psychiatry. Families of immigrants whose child has a psychiatric illness must come to understand the disorder while navigating an unfamiliar health care system.Wintrob R. Cross- cultural psychiatry. Psychiatric Times. 2010;27:27.Measham T, Guzder J, Rousseau C, Nadeau L. Cultural considerations in child and adolescent psychiatry. Psychiatric Times. 2010;27:38-40. Criticisms Subjective diagnoses One criticism against psychiatry is that psychiatric diagnoses lack \\"objectivity\\", particularly when compared with diagnosis in other medical specialties. However, for several major psychiatric disorders interrater reliability, which shows the degree to which psychiatrists agree on the diagnosis, is generally similar to those in other medical specialties. In 2013, Allen Frances said that \\"psychiatric diagnosis still relies exclusively on fallible subjective judgments rather than objective biological tests\\". Traditional deficit and disease models of child psychiatry have been criticized as rooted in the medical model which conceptualizes adjustment problems in terms of disease states. It is said by these critics that these normative models explicitly characterize problematic behavior as representing a disorder within the child or young person and these commentators assert that the role of environmental influences on behavior has become increasingly neglected, leading to a decrease in the popularity of, for example, family therapy. There are criticisms of the medical model approach from within and without the psychiatric profession (see references): it is said to neglect the role of environmental, family, and cultural influences, to discount the psychological meaning of behavior and symptoms, to promote a view of the \\"patient\\" as dependent and needing to be cured or cared for and therefore undermines a sense of personal responsibility for conduct and behavior, to promote a normative conception based on adaptation to the norms of society (the ill person must adapt to society), and to be based on the shaky foundations of reliance on a classificatory system that has been shown to have problems of validity and reliability (Boorse, 1976; Jensen, 2003; Sadler et al. 1994; Timimi, 2006). Over-prescription of psychoactive drugs Since the late 1990s, use of psychiatric medication has become increasibly common for children and adolescents. In 2004 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued the Black Box Warning on antidepressant prescriptions to alert patients of a research link between use of medication and apparent increased risk of suicidal thoughts, hostility, and agitation in pediatric patients. The most common diagnoses for which children receive psychiatric medication are ADHD, ODD, and conduct disorder.Webber, Jo., Plotts, Cynthia A. Emotional and Behavioral Disorders Theory and Practice 5th Edition. 2008. Pearson Education: New York, NY. p. 98. Some research suggests that children and adolescents are sometimes given antipsychotic drugs as a first-line treatment for mental health problems or behavioral issues other than a psychotic disorder, which is not the ideal treatment approach for these drugs., which cites   In the United States, the usage of these drugs in young people has greatly increased since 2000, especially among children from low-income families. More research is needed to specifically assess the efficacy and tolerability of antipsychotic medications in pediatric populations. Because of the risk of weight gain, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular changes with antipsychotic use, the use of the drugs in pediatric populations is highly scrutinized and their use recommended only in combination with effective parent-training interventions. Electroconvulsive therapy In 1947, child neuropsychiatrist Lauretta Bender published a study on 98 children aged between four and eleven years old who had been treated in the previous five years with intensive courses of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). These children received ECT daily for a typical course of approximately twenty treatments. This formed part of an experimental trend amongst a cadre of psychiatrists to explore the therapeutic impact of intensive regimes of ECT, which is also known as either regressive ECT or annihilation therapy. In the 1950s Bender abandoned ECT as a therapeutic practice for the treatment of children. In the same decade the results of her published work on the use of ECT in children was discredited after a study showing that the condition of the children so treated had either not improved or deteriorated. Commenting on his experience as part of Bender's therapeutic program, Ted Chabasinski said that, \\"It really made a mess of me ... I went from being a shy kid who read a lot to a terrified kid who cried all the time.\\" Following his treatment, he spent ten years as an inmate of Rockland State Hospital, a psychiatric facility now known as the Rockland Psychiatric Center.

The area was declared a National Historic Landmark District in 1966,James Dillon (1977) , National Park Service and and is one of the largest urban, community-wide historic preservation districts in the United States. The district was made in recognition of the unique layout of the city, begun by James Oglethorpe at the city's founding and propagated for over a century of its growth. The plan of the historic portions of Savannah is based on the concept of a ward, as defined by James Oglethorpe. Each ward had a central square, around which were arrayed four trust lots and four tythings. Each trust lot was to be used for a civic purpose, such as a school, government building, church, museum, or other public venue, while the tythings were each subdivided into ten lots for residential use. The wards were oriented in a rectlinear grid with north-south and east-west alignment. In a typical ward, the trust lots were set east and west of the square, and the residential lots of the tythings were extended north and south of the trust lots and the square, each tything divided into two rows of five lots, separated by alleys. In the early years of the Province of Georgia, the ward organization was in part military, with each ward's inhabitants organized into militia units, and the central squares acting as a gathering point for refugees from outside the city walls. Each year, the Savannah Historic District attracts millions of visitors, who enjoy its eighteenth- and nineteenth-century architecture and green spaces. The district includes the birthplace of Juliette Gordon Low (founder of the Girl Scouts of the United States of America, see Juliette Gordon Low Historic District), the Telfair Academy of Arts and Sciences (one of the South's first public museums), the First African Baptist Church (the oldest African American Baptist congregation in the United States), Temple Mickve Israel (the third-oldest synagogue in America), the Central of Georgia Railway roundhouse complex (the oldest standing antebellum rail facility in America), Christ Church (the Mother Church of Georgia), the old Colonial Cemetery, Cathedral of St. John the Baptist, and Old Harbor Light. And Factor's Row, a line of former cotton warehouses, along its waterfront, some built from ships' ballast stones. Other buildings in the district include the Isaiah Davenport House, the Green-Meldrim House, the Owens-Thomas House, the William Scarbrough House, the Sorrel-Weed House, and the United States Customhouse. Notable green spaces in the district include Savannah's 22 shaded squares, the 30-acre Forsyth Park (at the southern limit of the district), and Emmet Park (near the city's riverfront).

Patrilineally, the family is descended from Ahmad bin Mousa Bin Abu baker Al Jabira Housaini. However, the family name Jabiri is derived matrilinearly through Fatima, daughter of an Ottoman judge named Jabir Bin Ahmad Al-Halabi of Aleppo who had considerable wealth and power at the time of her birth. One of their most influential descendants was Zaido Jabiri the Great. The Jabri Family was also famous in Yemen and India Hyderabad - During the time of His Exalted Highness Nawab Sir Mir Osman Ali Khan Siddiqi, Asaf Jah VII - Hyderabad india many arabs arrived from Arab for worked in Hyderabad and appointed as Army Personnel Salam bin Saied Al Jabri also one of the employee of Mir Osman Ali khan during that time.  Family rise to power 1700s  After the early death of his father Mousa, Ahmad was raised by his grandfather Qadi (the judge) Jabir, as an orphan the young boy kept by his grandfather's side, people started to refer to him as jabir son (Ibn Jabir) which was passed along to some of his sons and grandsons who were later referred to as Jabiris (the sons of Jabir). Members of this family had become important Ulema by the second half of the 18th century. In 1760 the head of the family was Ahmad Jabiri, who lived in the quarter of 'Aynayn in the western suburbs of the city and owned considerable property over there which he inherited from his mother mostly. In 1765 about five years before his death, Ahmad created a waqf from this property, including the family home, which was to be a residence for his descendants, Nevertheless, before he died three of his four sons had moved into new houses in different quarters of the city: 'Taha: a clerk in court and moved to Farafira, As'ad: stayed in 'Aynayn, Yousif: started as teacher in Aleskandaria school in bab al jynayn, then he moved to Masabin although he spent most of his time in Istanbul where he had taken a post as clerk in the imperial divan. Mustafa: Moved to Suwayqat 'Ali, he worked in court as Head of Kateb (chief clerk), later he became Mufti Halab and Naqeeb Al Alshraf two positions only given to direct descendants of profit Mohamed at that time, and considered the highest religious authority in the city. All Jabiri's today are descendants from Mustafa, he was the first to make the name jabiri official in court. Mustafa had two sons, Abdullah and Abdul Qader, Abdullah succeeded his father as Mufti and Naqeeb Alashraf, Abdul Qader was mutasalem and handled the family expanding business, these Jabiri brothers Abdullah and Abdul Qader were among the most powerful men in Aleppo in the first decades of the 19th century and were heavily involved in the factional politics of that time. Their political success were closely linked to their joint efforts. Between them, they shared some of the most important local religious offices: Mufti, Ra'is al-kuttab, na'ib (deputy judge) of the court, and naqib al-ashraf.

It is the second installment of the Gears of War series, with lead design by Cliff Bleszinski. The game was released in North America, Europe and Australia on November 7, 2008 and was released in Japan on July 30, 2009. The game expands technically on the previous game by using a modified Unreal Engine 3. The development team brought in comic book writer Joshua Ortega to help write the plot for the game. In Gears of War 2, the COG continues its fight against the Locust, who are attempting to sink all of the cities on the planet Sera. Sergeant Marcus Fenix leads Delta Squad into the depths of the planet to try to stop the Locust during the assault upon Locust territory. The player controls Fenix in the main mission campaign, with the ability to play cooperatively with a second player controlling Fenix's best friend and fellow Squad member Dominic \\"Dom\\" Santiago. The game includes several existing and new multiplayer modes including five-on-five battles between human and Locust forces, and a \\"Horde\\" mode that challenges up to five players against waves of Locust forces with ever-increasing strength. New weapons and gameplay mechanics such as \\"chainsaw duels\\" and the ability to use downed foes as \\"meatshields\\" were added to the game. On its release weekend, Gears of War 2 sold over two million copies, and within two months of release, had sold four million copies. It was the seventh best selling video game of 2009 and received several accolades. The game received similar praise as its predecessor, with the new gameplay and multiplayer modes seen as outstanding additions. It was followed by Gears of War 3 in 2011. Gameplay Gears of War 2 is a third person shooter with an emphasis on the tactical use of cover, and retains much of the same gameplay from the first game. The player, playing as either Marcus or Dominic in the campaign mode, or as any of the human or Locust characters in multiplayer mode, can only carry a pistol, one type of grenade, and two other weapons at any time, though they may swap these for weapons found in strategic locations or left by downed foes or fallen allies. Each weapon can be used for normal fire as well as for melee attacks; the game's signature Lancer, an assault rifle mounted with a chainsaw bayonet for its melee, can be used to instantly kill foes. The game introduces the ability to engage in chainsaw duels should the player attempt to chainsaw an opponent also using the Lancer; the player is presented with a controller button to press rapidly to try to win the duel and avoid death. Gears of War 2 rebalances the power of the existing weapons while introducing five new ones: a flamethrower, a chain gun, a mortar cannon, a \\"Gorgon\\" Pistol, and the Ink Grenade. The chain gun and the mortar are heavy weapons, forcing the player to move at walking speed while carrying it in both hands. The Gorgon Pistol is an SMG-like machine pistol that fires four four- shot bursts per magazine. The Ink Grenade doesn't damage with its detonation, but instead temporarily poisons the area it was thrown, making it very useful for driving enemies out of cover. Grenades can be planted on walls or floors as proximity traps that go off when an enemy nears, but only fragmentation grenades have the ability to kill foes when they go off. The player's health is represented by a red \\"Crimson Omen\\" that fades onto the screen the more damage the player takes; staying out of the line of fire allows the player to recover their health. Depending on the game mode or difficulty, if the player takes too much damage, they enter a downed state where they can crawl around the map to get out of battle and seek help. During this time, a teammate can revive him, an enemy may brutally execute the downed player, or the player may bleed out if too much time has passed. The player can also grab a downed character and use them as a meatshield, allowing the body to absorb damage but forcing the player to use a one-handed pistol. Explosive weapons will simply destroy the character they strike. Like its predecessor, Gears of War 2 features an optional mature content filter, which, when active, makes blood appear as sparks and removes harsh language from the dialogue. Furthermore, progress towards most of the Xbox achievements for the game can be earned in either campaign or multiplayer modes. Campaign mode The campaign mode in Gears of War 2 allows for a single player or two players playing cooperatively as Marcus or Dom. A new \\"Normal\\" difficulty was added between the game's \\"Casual\\" and \\"Hardcore\\" difficulties. There is also an 'Insane' difficulty that is unlocked after the player completes the game at least once. Players in co-op mode can select different difficulties, and a \\"communal combat system\\" will adjust the game's artificial intelligence to give both players a fair challenge. The co-op campaign can be played in a drop in/drop out manner, with the second player able to join the first player's game in progress. As well as collecting some COG tags as in the first game, players can search other story- based items such as personal letters and medical records, with discovered items being added to a war journal. The campaign features a deeper story with new characters, new weapons, and new enemies according to John DiMaggio, the voice actor for Marcus Fenix. New vehicles have been added to the game, such as the Centaur Tank, which lead designer Cliff Bleszinski describes as a \\"tank with monster truck wheels.\\" Players will also ride a Brumak and Reavers in the game. Cut-scenes use the better facial rendering technology of Epic's Unreal engine, and engage in more dramatic angles for the conversation, as well as using a video screen on Jack (the all-purpose robot used by Delta squad) to talk with their commanders face-to-face. Multiplayer Gears of War 2 features an upgraded multiplayer mode that allows up to ten users to simultaneously play in teams of five-on-five. Gears of War 2 includes most of the multiplayer modes, including Execution, Warzone, Annex and King of the Hill, and adds in three new modes. Guardian is a modified version of Assassination from the original Gears of War, but allows players to continue fighting after the leader has been killed, but losing the ability to respawn. Wingman splits all ten players into five teams of two, where both members of a team play as the same character. Submission, formerly known as Meat Flag, is a version of capture the flag in which players attempt to \\"down\\" an enemy controlled by the game's AI and move its body to their team's base or objective to earn points. The 10 maps shipped with the game originally are Avalanche, Blood Drive, Day One, Hail, Jacinto, Pavilion, River, Ruins, Security and Stasis A Halo-like matchmaking system has been utilized for the online multiplayer Players can now engage in multiplayer scenarios with any combination of human players and artificial intelligence controlled by the game, with the ability to set the AI's intelligence level. Horde is a new co- op mode for five players, fighting off waves of attacking Locust together, with each wave becoming more difficult. Horde Mode does not feature bot support as in competitive multiplayer, and can be played alone. Players can pan around a map as the camera focuses on areas of intense fighting, and the Ghost Cam allows a player to roam freely around a map. The ability to take photographs is also featured, which enables the player to take a photo, which can be uploaded to the Gears of War website and is rated on the quality of action in the shot. Synopsis Setting Gears of War 2 takes place six months after the detonation of the Lightmass Bomb at the end of the first game. Though most of the underground army of the Locust Horde was destroyed, the explosion also caused much of the liquid Imulsion underground to vaporize, causing a fatal disease called Rustlung to spread among the diminished human population. After months of peace, the cities of Tollen and Montevado suddenly and mysteriously disappear underground, leading the Coalition of Ordered Governments (COG) to suspect the resurgence of the Locust. Soon after, the once impenetrable Jacinto, one of the last remaining safe havens for humans, begins to show signs that the same fate awaits it. To stop the fall of Jacinto, the COG responds with a large-scale counter-offensive against the Locust. Senior Producer Rod Fergusson says \\"In order to save Jacinto, [the COG] have no choice but to take the war to the Locust.\\" Characters Returning characters includes the main protagonists of the series Marcus Fenix and Dominic Santiago and others from the first game, including Marcus and Dom's fellow Delta Squad COG soldiers, Augustus 'Cole Train' Cole and Damon Baird. Also returning in supporting roles are radio dispatcher Anya Stroud and senior officer Colonel Hoffman. Lead designer Cliff Bleszinski confirmed that the character Carmine would be returning, but did not reveal how or in what capacity as Carmine was killed in the original Gears of War. It was later revealed that the original Anthony Carmine would not be present in the Gears of War 2 campaign, but rather his brother, Benjamin, would make an appearance. The game also introduces several new characters. They include Chairman Prescott, the noble, yet near-dictatorial military leader of COG; Tai Kaliso, \\"a spiritual and meditative warrior from a tradition of honor bound fighters;\\" and Dizzy Wallin, a former Stranded who joined the COG to keep his family safe. Dom's wife Maria also makes an appearance, and Dom's search for her plays an important part in the story. Plot As Gears of War 2 begins, the COG army is mobilizing to send forces into the depths of Sera to assault the Locust directly. The COG deploy several units into the Locust Tunnels, known as 'The Hollow', despite sustaining heavy casualties. Delta Squad, consisting of Marcus Fenix, Dom Santiago, Benjamin Carmine, and later Augustus Cole and Damon Baird, continues to search the Hollow and discovers that the Locust are using a giant Riftworm to sink the human occupied cities. The Locust plan to destroy the rock structures at the outskirts of Jacinto, the last major Human city, in hopes of sinking it into the ground. Delta Squad kills the Riftworm before it can sink Jacinto, but lose Carmine in the process. They then manage to return to the surface. They are ordered to investigate a nearby abandoned COG outpost where they encounter experimented creatures of unknown origin and learn of a back door entrance to the Hollow in the nearby Kadar Mountains. They find prisoner cages and Dom convinces Marcus that Maria (Dom's wife) must be inside one of them. They manage to find her, but the Locust imprisonment and torture has left her severely disfigured and traumatized, unable to communicate. Faced with the nigh-vegetative state Maria is in, Dom tearfully chooses to euthanize her. Marcus and Dom then charge into the Locust stronghold. Inside, Delta Squad discovers the Locust Horde is locked in a civil war against the \\"Lambent\\", a group of Locust who have been exposed to Imulsion. They decide to destroy both the Locust and Lambent forces by detonating a bomb under Jacinto, which will sink the city and flood the Locust tunnels. Marcus and Dom battle their way through the Locust tunnels, while Cole and Baird use a helicopter to transport a bomb into the cavern. A Lambent Brumak destroys the bomb before it can be detonated. Marcus improvises by using a satellite targeting solution to bombard the Brumak with an orbital laser, which causes it to violently explode. Jacinto begins to sink and sea- water floods into the sinkhole, destroying the remaining Locust forces. As the COG forces and civilians evacuate, a voiceover of the Locust Queen talks about unintended legacies. After the credits, a last voice over of Adam Fenix is heard, a radio transmission of a call for help, and a cry of desperation, revealing he is still alive. Development Game Developers Conference 2008, depicting Fenix executing a Locust with the chainsaw bayonet Gears of War designer Cliff Bleszinski has done several interviews to highlight improvements to the game. Heavy Netcode optimization has been done to negate the host advantage problem in the first title and hundreds of tweaks have gone into improving the cover system and movement. To provide a deeper story, the team brought aboard novelist Joshua Ortega as to incorporate more personal drama within the sci-fi setting. Steve Jablonsky provided the music for the game. Epic Games also considered making the game easier after complaints about Gears of War. Senior producer Rod Fergusson admitted that ‚Äî for the first game ‚Äî \\"We overshot on [the Casual] difficulty and a game that was a little harder than we intended.\\" A teaser image posted to the Gears of War 2 website on July 8, 2008 suggested that the game was to be released on November 9, 2008, but it was confirmed during the Microsoft E3 2008 press conference that the game would be released on November 7, 2008. On July 14, 2008, the teaser image was removed and the website relaunched and updated for Gears of War 2. Gears of War 2 was a focal point during Microsoft's E3 2008 presentation on July 15, 2008, which included a \\"hands-on\\" demo. A second trailer, entitled \\"Rendezvous,\\" was made available on July 14, 2008 as a part of E3. The Joseph Kosinski-directed trailer,[josephkosinski.com/main.html J. Kosinski's web page], under 'Works', 'GOW 2 Rendezvous'. which features the Trans Am track \\"Diabolical Cracker\\" from the album Red Line, takes its title and spoken words from Alan Seeger's World War I poem I Have a Rendezvous with Death. The game's release date was also set, with a worldwide release to occur on November 7, 2008. Microsoft and Epic Games announced on October 10, 2008 that Gears of War 2 had gone gold.Gears of War 2 Goes Gold IGN.com. Retrieved October 10, 2008. It was stated by Cliff Bleszinski that, unlike Gears of War, the previous installment, Gears of War 2 will not feature a PC port. Graphics Comparison of the map \\"Gridlock\\" in Gears of War and Gears of War 2 At the 2008 Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, California, as a showcase for the functionality of the Unreal Engine 3, Gears of War creators Epic Games showed various improvements to the engine with specific reference to the sequel itself. The video showed several demonstrations of the improvements, the initial being improvements to the in-game lighting through Screen Space Ambient Occlusion, in which dynamic shadows could be generated through the use of a pixel shading technique to render more realistically lit and shaded objects and actors, illustrated through comparison between character and environment models in the original game engine to that of Unreal Engine 3. Also showcased was the ability of the engine to render hordes of actors within the engine, as demonstrated with a large crowd of locust flocking through the \\"Gridlock\\" multiplayer map from the original game. Alongside this technology was improvements to \\"Matinee,\\" an artistic tool used for the rendering and editing 3-dimensional scenes within the game. Other physics-related features included improvements to the rendering of water in which specular light and physical interactions with were displayed more realistically, improvements to soft body entities demonstrated with a \\"Meat Cube\\" and a floating ball possessing properties similar to that of liquid helium. The largest of these physics engine related changes was the introduction of destructible environments due to the implementation of real-time structural analysis tools to generate the damage of the materials and subsequently their deformed shapes based upon resultant forces placed upon them. This was demonstrated with the use of explosive arrows fired from the \\"Torque Bow\\" of the original game causing damage to wooden planks, and also revealing rebar present after destroying areas of a stone structure. Downloadable content and updates On February 20, 2008, coinciding with the game's announcement at the Game Developers Conference, a free set of gamer pictures and a dashboard theme, as well as a teaser trailer titled \\"Duel,\\" were made available via the Xbox Live Marketplace. The first footage of gameplay from the campaign, highlighting new features of the game, was released online and to the Marketplace on May 9, 2008. After the Microsoft E3 press conference, the \\"Rendezvous\\" trailer and the press conference demonstration was available for download as well as a new free set of gamer pictures and a dashboard theme. Upon release, every new copy of Gears of War 2 features a code to download the \\"Flashback Map Pack,\\" which includes five enhanced multiplayer maps from the original game. Customers who attended the GameStop Midnight Madness game release event received a code to unlock a gold-plated Hammerburst rifle for use in multiplayer and a code for an exclusive Xbox 360 Dashboard theme optimized for the New Xbox Experience. The first downloadable content released after Gears of War 2 was the \\"Combustible Map Pack,\\" which consists of three new multiplayer maps. This add-on was announced and released on December 15, 2008. The second title update was released on January 21, 2009, featuring several adjustments to gameplay and adding additional Achievements, the patch attempts to correct many of the \\"glitches\\" that players have discovered since the game's release. A third update was applied to Gears of War 2 on March 24, 2009. The update added an experience-based ranking system in which the player is given a numerical value based on their amount of experience points, which are gained by shooting or killing enemies in public multiplayer. The update also addressed several issues with matchmaking, including adding bots in place of players who have quit or lost connection to the game. In early July 2009, Epic Games applied a fourth update to Gears of War 2, which added the ability to gain experience from the multiplayer Horde Mode, as well as applying several more gameplay fixes. On July 28, 2009, the \\"Dark Corners\\" add-on was released. This add-on consisted of seven new multiplayer maps, and an additional campaign chapter that was originally deleted from the game. The deleted scene takes place after Maria's death, where the user can choose to either sneak into the stronghold as Theron Guards or charge in as in the original game, though the level is different from the one that appeared in the final game and features a cameo from a Stranded character from the original Gears. All Fronts Collection On May 6, 2009, Microsoft and Epic Games issued a joint press release announcing the Gears of War 2: All Fronts Collection, to be released on July 28, 2009. The All Fronts Collection was to be sold as a retail package, and would have included all add-ons released for Gears of War 2, a poster, and a strategy guide for the game. In response to complaints that the All Fronts Collection had identical pricing to the Dark Corners add-on, but significantly more content, as well as the All Fronts Collection retail package not being made available in certain regions, Epic Games adjusted the release plan; the All Fronts Collection was released digitally via Xbox Live and the Dark Corners add-on was reduced in price. Stereoscopic 3D In June 2010 during the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2010 Mark Rein (vice president of Epic Games) was showcasing a tech demo of Gears of War 2 in stereoscopic 3D running on an Xbox 360 thanks to the TriOviz for Games Technology.\\"This technology‚Äôs great because it works on normal HD TVs, as well as the very high end 3DTVs,\\" Rein commented to Computer and Video Games. \\"We're not planning to re-release this in 3D - unless Microsoft want us to - but I'm sure its technology may be keen to put in the games developed by our partners.\\" In October 2010 TriOviz for Games Technology has been integrated in Unreal Engine 3, allowing to easily convert in stereoscopic 3D, numerous past and upcoming games developed with this engine. Marketing A Limited Edition of the game was confirmed on February 20, 2008. On July 14, 2008, more information about the Limited Edition's contents was revealed. The edition features alternative cover art, a SteelBook case with a bonus content DVD, a book entitled Beneath the Surface: An Inside Look at Gears of War 2, which includes concept art and story-related information, a keepsake photo of Dominic and Maria, and an exclusive Xbox Live code to unlock a gold-plated Lancer for online play. As a bonus item promoted by electronics store Best Buy, customers who preordered the Limited Edition also received a bonus Remote Control Centaur Tank replica, just like the new vehicle introduced in the game, free of charge. Reception Critical reception Gears of War 2 received widespread critical acclaim. It currently holds a 93.32% aggregate review score at GameRankings, and a 93/100 from the aggregate review website Metacritic. While the game has been praised for the addition of a deeper plot than the original Gears of War and being highly polished, reviewers noted that the multiplayer experience did not resemble the previous game especially in its quick pace and enjoyability. IGN noted that while the first four acts of the game were satisfying, in the final act \\"the last boss is a complete joke and the ending feels just a tad too abrupt,\\" and that there were some bugs and lag in the online multiplayer. Overall, IGN stated that \\"[Gears of War 2] has its flaws when it comes to the technical side of multiplayer and the last act of the campaign and the voice acting might turn some off. Still, none of that comes close to holding back Gears of War 2 from its destiny: being one of the best games available on the Xbox 360.\\" Also, even though the new plot was praised, critics such as Official Xbox Magazine scrutinized the game's middle acts saying that most of the plot \\"falls flat.\\" Both IGN and Eurogamer, among others, positively mentioned the new \\"Horde Mode\\" feature, with Eurogamer saying that \\"Horde is a weighty slab of fun that can turn almost any of them into a time-sink, and the leaderboards are likely to be as compelling a reason to stick with Gears of War 2 as the leveling system has been for Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare.\\" X-Play praised the game for its \\"polished cover system\\" and cooperative campaign mode. X-Play also praised the new weapons and characters and its \\"brilliant\\" multiplayer experience. Game Informer called the single-player campaign \\"satisfying\\" and called the co-op campaign amazing and goes on to call online multiplayer \\"an outstanding contrast to team deathmatch or capture-the-flag scenarios.\\" Sales Gears of War 2 has achieved significant success after its release. In its opening weekend, the game sold over two million units, and set a new record for the number of simultaneous players on Xbox Live, with over 1 million people logging on to play the game. The game went on to sell over three million copies worldwide within the first month of its release, and pushed past four million in sales within the first two months. It was the sixth best-selling game of December 2008 in the United States, selling in excess of 745,000 copies. It was also the tenth top-selling game in the United States in 2008, with over 1.3 million copies sold. It received a \\"Double Platinum\\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 600,000 copies in the United Kingdom. As of May 7, 2009, Gears of War 2 had sold over 5 million units worldwide, bringing the franchise total to 11 million units sold. Awards Gears of War 2 won several awards following its presentation at E3 2008. IGN gave it the awards Overall Best Shooting Game and Overall Best Graphics Technology of E3 2008. Game Critics Awards gave the game Best Action Game of E3 2008. Gears of War 2 also won Best Shooter and Best Xbox 360 Game at the 2008 Spike Video Game Awards. Sequel On April 13, 2010 on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, Cliff Bleszinski announced Gears of War 3 and debuted a trailer, titled \\"Ashes to Ashes.\\" The game is set 18 months after the events of Gears of War 2. It was originally going to be released on April 8, 2011, but was delayed and was finally released on September 20, 2011.

Fractional flow reserve is defined as the pressure after (distal to) a stenosis relative to the pressure before the stenosis. The result is an absolute number; an FFR of 0.80 means that a given stenosis causes a 20% drop in blood pressure. In other words, FFR expresses the maximal flow down a vessel in the presence of a stenosis compared to the maximal flow in the hypothetical absence of the stenosis. Procedure During coronary catheterization, a catheter is inserted into the femoral (groin) or radial arteries (wrist) using a sheath and guidewire. FFR uses a small sensor on the tip of the wire (commonly a transducer) to measure pressure, temperature and flow to determine the exact severity of the lesion. This is done during maximal blood flow (hyperemia), which can be induced by injecting products such as adenosine or papaverine. A pullback of the pressure wire is performed, and pressures are recorded across the vessel. An example of real-time FFR assessment in clinical use is shown here. There is no absolute cut-off point at which FFR becomes abnormal; rather, there is a smooth transition, with a large grey zone of insecurity. In clinical trials however, a cut-off point of 0.75 to 0.80 has been used; higher values indicate a non-significant stenosis, whereas lower values indicate a significant lesion. Equation Fractional flow reserve (FFR) is the ratio of maximum blood flow distal to a stenotic lesion to normal maximum flow in the same vessel. It is calculated using the pressure ratio FFR = \\\\frac{p_d}{p_a} where p_d is the pressure distal to the lesion, and p_a is the pressure proximal to the lesion. Rationale The decision to perform a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is usually based on angiographic results alone. Angiography can be used for the visual evaluation of the inner diameter of a vessel. In ischemic heart disease, deciding which narrowing is the culprit lesion is not always clear-cut. Fractional flow reserve provides a functional evaluation, by measuring the pressure decline caused by a vessel narrowing. Advantages and disadvantages FFR has certain advantages over other techniques to evaluate narrowed coronary arteries, such as coronary angiography, intravascular ultrasound or CT coronary angiography. For example, FFR takes into account collateral flow, which can render an anatomical blockage functionally unimportant. Also, standard angiography can underestimate or overestimate narrowing, because it only visualizes contrast inside a vessel. Other techniques can also provide information which FFR cannot. Intravascular ultrasound, for example, can provide information on plaque vulnerability, whereas FFR measures are only determined by plaque thickness. There are newly developed technologies that can assess both plaque vulnerability and FFR from CT by measuring the vasodilitative capacity of the arterial wall. FFR allows real-time estimation of the effects of a narrowed vessel, and allows for simultaneous treatment with balloon dilatation and stenting. On the other hand, FFR is an invasive procedure for which non- invasive (less drastic) alternatives exist, such as cardiac stress testing. In this test, physical exercise or intravenous medication (adenosine/dobutamine) is used to increase the workload and oxygen demand of the heart muscle, and ischemia is detected using ECG changes or nuclear imaging. DEFER study In the DEFER study, fractional flow reserve was used to determine the need for stenting in patients with intermediate single vessel disease. In those patients with a stenosis with an FFR of less than 0.75, outcome was significantly worse. In patients with an FFR of 0.75 or more however, stenting did not influence outcomes. This suggests that FFR is a useful tool to gauge decision-making in this setting. FAME study The Fractional Flow Reserve versus Angiography for Multivessel Evaluation (FAME) study evaluated the role of FFR in patients with multivessel coronary artery disease. In 20 centers in Europe and the United States, 1005 patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention with drug eluting stent implantation were randomized to intervention based on angiography or based on fractional flow reserve in addition to angiography. In the angiography arm of the study, all suspicious- looking lesions were stented. In the FFR arm, only angiographically suspicious lesions with an FFR of 0.80 or less were stented. In the patients whose care was guided by FFR, fewer stents were used (2.7¬±1.2 and 1.9¬±1.3, respectively). After one year, the primary endpoint of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and repeat revascularization were lower in the FFR group (13.2% versus 18.3%), largely attributable to fewer stenting procedures and their associated complications. There also was a non-significant higher number of patients of residual angina sufferers (81% versus 78%). In the FFR group, hospital stay was slightly shorter (3.4 vs 3.7 days) and procedural costs were less ($5,332 vs $6,007). FFR did not prolong procedure (around 70 minutes in both groups).

These include the kingdoms of the Visigoths (in Hispania and Gallia Narbonensis), the Ostrogoths (in Italia, Sicilia, Raetia, Noricum, Pannonia, Dalmatia and Dacia), the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms in Sub-Roman Britain, and finally the Franks who established the nucleus of the later \\"Holy Roman Empire\\" in Gallia Aquitania, Gallia Lugdunensis, Gallia Belgica, Germania Superior and Inferior, and parts of the previously unconquered Germania Magna. Additionally, minor Germanic tribes ‚Äì the Vandals, the Suebi, the Burgundians, the Alemanni, and later the Lombards ‚àí also established their kingdoms in Roman territory in the West. The cultural syncretism of Roman and Germanic traditions overlaid the earlier syncretism of Roman culture with the Celtic culture of the respective imperial provinces, Gallo-Roman culture in Gaul and Romano-British culture in Britain. This results in a triple fusion of Celtic-Roman-Germanic culture for France and England in particular. Romano-Germanic cultural contact begins as early as the first Roman accounts of the Germanic peoples. Roman influence is perceptible beyond the boundaries of the empire, in the Northern European Roman Iron Age of the first centuries AD. The nature of this cultural contact changes with the decline of the Roman Empire and the beginning Migration period in the wake of the crisis of the third century: the \\"barbarian\\" peoples of Germania Magna formerly known as mercenaries and traders now came as invaders and eventually as a new ruling elite, even in Italy itself, beginning with Odoacer's rise to the rank of Dux Italiae in 476 AD. The cultural syncretism was most pronounced in Francia. In West Francia, the nucleus of what was to become France, the Frankish language was eventually extinct, but not without leaving significant traces in the emerging Romance language. In East Francia on the other hand, the nucleus of what was to become the kingdom of Germany and ultimately German-speaking Europe, the syncretism was less pronounced since only its southernmost portion had ever been part of the Roman Empire, as Germania Superior: all territories on the right hand side of the Rhine remain Germanic- speaking. Those parts of the Germanic sphere extends along the left of the Rhine, including the Swiss plateau, the Alsace, the Rhineland and Flanders, are the parts where Romano-Germanic cultural contact remains most evident. Early Germanic law reflects the coexistence of Roman and Germanic cultures during the Migration period in applying separate laws to Roman and Germanic individuals, notably the Lex Romana Visigothorum (506), the Lex Romana Curiensis and the Lex Romana Burgundionum. The separate cultures amalgamated after Christianization, and by the Carolingian period the distinction of Roman vs. Germanic subjects had been replaced by the feudal system of the Three Estates of the Realm.  Medieval aristocracy  With a renewed close attention to the history and literature of ancient Rome in the 12th century, the medieval aristocracy saw itself mirrored in the accounts of ancient Roman nobility. Some made doubtful claims to direct descent from Roman aristocracy. In the 19th century, German and French medievalists worried about the origins of the great medieval families. Did the great families descend from the aristocracy of the Roman Empire or from the barbarian chieftains who invaded the Roman Empire between 400 and 600? Did the families originate in the Latin or Germanic world? Both, it seems. Medieval Western Europe was an amalgam of Roman and 'Barbarian' bloodlines. The cultural and genetic influence of the Visigoths, Franks, et al. is readily apparent in the socio-cultural and political framework of Medieval Europe. In spite of this, the legacy of Rome, both social-cultural and genetic pervaded every aspect of Medieval society - this was of course greatly assisted by the medieval Church. Beginning in the 19th century scholars such as Nikolay Yakovlevich Danilevsky and other pan- Slavism and Slavophile writers have used the term to distinguish eastern and western Europe, or Slavic-Russian culture as opposed to Romano-Germanic culture. The earliest mentions of these ideas arose when the Hellenic Byzantine east made attempts to distinguish itself from the Latin west during the times of the Roman Empire.

It is also called the Riedbahn (Ried Railway). The line runs through an area called the Hessische Ried, hence the name. The term Riedbahn was originally used for the Darmstadt‚ÄìWorms railway and the two lines share the central section between Gro√ü-Gerau and Biblis. The Mannheim‚ÄìFrankfurt railway is used by three Intercity-Express routes, connecting South Germany with Berlin, Hamburg, Cologne and Dortmund and regional services of the Rhine-Main transport union and Rhine-Neckar transport union. The line is one of the busiest line in Germany with 650 trains per day, although most freight uses the Main-Neckar Railway, which is further east and gives better access to the Mannheim marshalling yard. In order to overcome heavy congestion of the line and to accelerate train services, it is proposed to build a new line between Frankfurt and Mannheim. The planning approval process is expected to start in 2017.  History  The Riedbahn was originally built by the Hessian Ludwig Railway (Hessische Ludwigsbahn), to connect Darmstadt, the capital of the Grand Duchy of Hesse, with Worms, the second most important city in the province of Rheinhessen of the Grand Duchy. The riparian communities contributed significantly to the financing of the project. On 29 May 1869, the line from Darmstadt via Riedstadt-Goddelau and Biblis to Rosengarten station, on the opposite side of the Rhine from Worms, was opened by the Prime Minister of the Grand Duchy of Hesse, Reinhard Carl Friedrich von Dalwigk. From Rosengarten station, trains crossed the Rhine from 1870 to 1900 using the Worms-Rosengarten train ferry, as there was no bridge across the Rhine at Worms. Between Worms and Hofheim services on the Nibelung Railway run on the same tracks. The line from Biblis to the Mannheim suburb of Waldhof was opened in October 1879, so that the route to Mannheim ended not at the central station, but at the Riedbahnhof, north of today's Kurpfalz Bridge. In November 1879, the (then) branch line from Goddelau to Frankfurt was opened. Changes to the line  The opening of the line from Waldhof through K√§fertal to the Rhine Valley line south of Mannheim station in 1880, enabled trains to run from the Riedbahn into Mannheim station from the south. In order to continue towards Karlsruhe and Stuttgart trains had to reverse in the station. In December 1900, a railway bridge was opened over the Rhine to Worms, creating a direct connection to Worms and replacing the existing terminus at Rosengarten and the ferry crossing over the Rhine. In 1975, the railway between Darmstadt and Goddelau was closed due to lack of traffic and partly dismantled. All that remains of the line is a siding from Darmstadt to Weiterstadt-Riedbahn, where the line ends. However, there is a connection between the Riedbahn and the Rhine-Main Railway to Darmstadt and Mainz at Gro√ü-Gerau. High-speed traffic LZB in Biblis station ICE train on Riedbahn at Mannheim Handelshafen Until the opening of the long Western Entrance to the Riedbahn (westlichen Einf√ºhrung der Riedbahn, WER) to Mannheim Hauptbahnhof in 1985, trains from Frankfurt came from the south to reach Mannheim and had to reverse to continue south towards Heidelberg or Karlsruhe on the Rhine Valley line. Some TGV and Intercity-Express (ICE) services continue to use the eastern branch of the Ried Railway to cross the Rhine without reversal. Almost all regional trains run on the new western approach; Mannheim-K√§fertal station is currently operated by one Regionalbahn service each day. The eastern Ried Railway has 180 pairs of trains each day, mainly freight traffic. Already in the Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan (Bundesverkehrswegeplan) of 1973, the Ried Railway was planned as one of eight rail routes to be rebuilt as \\"upgraded\\" lines (Ausbaustrecken). In its successor, the Co-ordinated Investment Program for Federal Transport Infrastructure (Koordinierten Investitionsprogramm f√ºr die Bundesverkehrswege) of 1977, the track was included as one of six development projects. The development project was also included in the Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan (Koordinierten Investitionsprogramm f√ºr die Bundesverkehrswege) of 1980. The Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan of 1985 included the first stage of the route, which was essentially the new approach to Mannheim Hauptbahnhof, as part of the most urgently needed works. The second stage was included in the list of ‚Äúfurther needs‚Äù in the same document. In the 1970s, a new line from Cologne to Gross-Gerau that would have connected with the Ried Railway in Gross-Gerau was planned; this project was later abandoned. The second stage should have been completed by the time of the full commissioning of the Mannheim‚ÄìStuttgart high-speed railway (1991). Due to delays in the project approval process, some measures were implemented later, especially the elimination of level crossings. By the end of 1989, four of the 27 crossings along the line had been removed. By early 1991, the planning approval process for four of the twelve sections had been initiated. In four of the eight sections work had largely been completed. Overall, 46 individual projects had been carried out by the end of 1989. The line was opened for ICE operations between Stockstadt and Waldhof on 2 June 1991. On the same section of line, capacity was increased from 240 to 280 trains per day. The B√ºrstadt railway bridge and four other bridge associated with the upgrade were rebuilt. In the early 1990s, preliminary planning also began for the construction of a connecting curve to connect Frankfurt Airport to the line (later realised as the Frankfurter Kreuz Tunnel, the first section of the Cologne‚ÄìFrankfurt high- speed line). At the timetable change in May 1998, the maximum speed limit on a 15 km length of the southern section was raised to 200 km/h. The northern section from Gro√ü-Gerau to Frankfurt was completed in autumn 1999 for high- speed operations. From 5 December 1999, the 3.3-km section from Leeheim to Dornberg could be operated at 200 km/h. As one of the major lines in Germany and the busiest line in southern Germany, the long Frankfurt-Mannheim line between Zeppelinheim and Mannheim-Waldhof, the line's Linienzugbeeinflussung train control system is certified for speeds up to 200 km/h; although the maximum speed at the Biblis curve is about . Most freight traffic runs over the parallel Main Neckar line because of its better connection to the Mannheim marshalling yard. Operations Riedstadt-Wolfskehlen station With 650 trains per day (as of 2007), the corridor between Mannheim and Frankfurt/Mainz is one of the busiest lines in Germany. A further increase to 900 trains in the corridor is expected by 2015. In addition to the regional services of the Rhein-Main-Verkehrsverbund and the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Neckar, three Intercity-Express lines run on the Ried Railway, connecting southern Germany with Berlin, Hamburg and Cologne/Dortmund. A Regional-Express service (RE 70) operates between Mannheim and Frankfurt and a Regionalbahn service (RB 62) operates between Worms and Biblis. One Regional Express operates each way between Frankfurt and Worms at night. Services of Rhine-Main S-Bahn line 7 run between Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof and Riedstadt-Goddelau. A Regionalbahn service (RB 2) operates between Biblis, Mannheim and Karlsruhe. This service is planned to be integrated in the Rhine-Neckar S-Bahn in the future. After the opening of the new the Rhine/Main‚ÄìRhine/Neckar high-speed line, capacity on the Ried Railway will be sufficient to allow Rhine-Main S-Bahn S-Bahn line to Gross-Gerau 7 to run every quarter of an hour rather than every half hour. Planning  To ease overloading on the line a new high-speed line from Frankfurt to Mannheim is being planned, cleared for top speeds of up to 300 km/h. The new line would mostly run close to the A5 and the A67 motorways. Deutsche Bahn originally proposed to build a bypass of the Mannheim Hauptbahnhof (the most important rail junction in southwestern Germany, although it is not a Category 1 station like Karlsruhe Hbf), but dropped this plan for the time being in 2006 due to strong community and political opposition. Construction has not started yet due to the difficulty in reaching agreement on the details of the project. Construction is expected to start in 2011 and be completed in 2017. A connection to the planned Terminal 3 at Frankfurt Airport is being considered. A connecting curve for S 7 and RE 70 services, including an underground S-Bahn station, would cost ‚Ç¨120 million. Such a connection would have a Benefit-cost ratio of more than 1. The second track of the eastern branch of the Ried Railway in Mannheim is to be reactivated in 2015 and the line will be served by S-Bahn services, according to the Baden-W√ºrttemberg Ministry of Environment and Transport. A new S-Bahn stop is planned at Mannheim-Neuostheim at the crossing of D√ºrerstra√üe. From December 2015, S-Bahn trains will run on the line every hour between Biblis and Mannheim Hauptbahnhof.

His reign was mostly peaceful as Siam was a powerful state through the conquests of Naresuan. It was also during his reign that foreigners of various origin began to fill the mercenary corps. In particular, the king had a regiment of professional Japanese guards under the command of Yamada Nagamasa.Chakrabongse, C., 1960, Lords of Life, London: Alvin Redman Limited During Ekathotsarot's reign, the English first came to Siam in 1612.  The White Prince  The White Prince was the son of Maha Thammarachathirat of Phitsanulok and Queen Wisutkasat. White Prince had an elder brother who was called The Black Prince, and an elder sister known as the Golden Princess. In November 1563, Phitsanulok came under attack by King Bayinnaung of Burma. Faced with an overwhelming force, Maha Thammarachathirat surrendered in January 1564, and agreed to join Bayinnaung's assault on Ayutthaya. With Phitsanulok's help, Bayinnaung forced King Maha Chakkraphat of Ayutthaya to surrender in February 1564.Phayre 1883: 110‚Äì111Harvey 1925: 168 Bayinnaung brought back the Black Prince and White Prince, along with Ayutthaya king Maha Chakkraphat. The two princes were educated and overseen by Bayinnaung, along with other captive princes. When Ayutthaya revolted in May 1568, Maha Thammarachathirat remained loyal to Bayinnaung, and became the vassal king of Siam when Bayinnaung's forces retook Ayutthaya in August 1569.Harvey 1925: 169‚Äì170 The Black and White Prince then returned to Ayutthaya in 1571. The Second King Prince Ekathotsarot joined his brother Naresuan in various wars with the Burmese. Naresuan declared independence in May 1584, and fought off a series of Burmese invasions from 1584 to 1593. In 1590, Maha Thammarachathirat died. Naresuan was crowned as the King of Ayutthaya while Ekathotsarot was made Uparaja but with equal honor to Naresuan (As in the case of Mongkut and Pinklao). The end of this series of Burmese invasions came in January 1593. Crown Prince of Burma, Mingyi Swa invaded Siam once more. He conducted an elephant duel with Naresuan, and was slain in the armed conflict. In 1595, Pegu faced rebellions by various tributaries and royal princes. Naresuan planned a massive invasion of Pegu but the city was taken beforehand by the Lord of Toungoo, with the support of Arakan. The efforts to capture Toungoo failed in May 1600, and Naresuan decided to retreat. In Lanna, however, a conflict arose between Nawrahta Minsaw, the Burmese king of Lanna, and Phraya Ram, a Siamese-installed Lanna noble. Naresuan sent Ekathotsarot to claim the conflicts by dividing Lanna into two parts. Naresuan died in 1605 while planning to invade the Burmese Shan states. Ekathotsarot was crowned as his successor. King of Siam Upon his coronation, the Ayutthaya kingdom had reached the maximum extent. However, immediately after the coronation, the Lanna kingdom broke away. In 1612, an English expedition arrived in Siam carrying a letter from King James I of England requesting permission for English merchants to trade in Siam. The King warmly welcomed the party and granted them a station for trading as well as presenting them with lavish gifts. In 1613‚Äì1614, Burmese king Anaukpetlun invaded the Tenasserim coast. He gained Tavoy but was driven back with heavy losses at Mergui.Harvey 1925: 189 (The Burmese then invaded Lan Na in April 1614. Lan Na sought help from Lan Xang but no help ever came, and Chiang Mai fell to the Burmese in December 1614.Hmannan Vol. 3 2003: 179‚Äì181 Note that according to Damrong, in 1618 Siam and Burma reached an agreement in which Burma would control Martaban and Siam would control Chiang Mai.Rajanubhab, D., 2001, Our Wars With the Burmese, Bangkok: White Lotus Co.

The embassy arrived in The Hague on September 10, 1608, and met with Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange.Galileo's Instruments of Credit: Telescopes, Images, Secrecy, Page 96, by Mario Biagioli This visit coincided with the application for patent of the telescope by the Dutch eyeglass maker Hans Lippershey, and this new device was mentioned at the end of a diplomatic report on the Siamese Embassy, Ambassades du Roy de Siam envoy√© √† l'Excellence du Prince Maurice, arrive a La Haye, le 10. September, 1608 (\\"Embassy of the King of Siam sent to his Excellence Prince Maurice, September 10, 1608\\"), which soon diffused across Europe.Measuring the Universe: Cosmic Dimensions from Aristarchus to Halley Page 65, by Albert Van Helden Following the embassy, a treaty was concluded between Holland and Siam in 1617.Southeast Asia: Its Historical Development, John Frank Cady, p.213 Foreign Mercenaries Ekathotsarot's reign saw the influx of foreigners into Siam as traders and mercenaries. Ekathotsarot established Krom Asas ('committee of volunteers', i.e. volunteered regiments) of foreign soldiers, for example; Krom Asa Mon, Krom Asa Cham, Krom Asa Yipun (Japanese mercenaries), and Krom Asa Maen Puen (literally 'committee of volunteer marksman' - the Portuguese and Dutch). Ekathotsarot had close relations with the Tokugawa shogunate under Tokugawa Ieyasu who commissioned Red Seal Ships to Siam. Around this time the Siamese metallurgists learned the arts of forging mortars from Westerners and combined with traditional methods giving rise to the praised Siamese mortars known for their qualities. Prince Suthat Ekathotsarot had two legitimate sons: Prince Suthat and Prince Sri Saowabhak. Prince Suthat was invested with the title of Uparaja in 1607. However, only four months later, Prince Suthat asked his father to release a prisoner; but instead angered his father, who accused Prince Suthat of a rebellion. Prince Suthat committed suicide by poison the same night - much to the grief of Ekathotsarot. This is one of the most mysterious historical scenes of Siamese history, as no one knows who was the prisoner Prince Suthat tried to free, nor why Ekathotsarot was so angry. Some historians hypothesized that the prisoner was one of the powerful nobles whose power was a challenge to the monarchy. The nature of Prince Suthat's death was also disputed, as he may have been poisoned by someone else. Whatever the fact may be, the Prince Suthat incident laid the grounds for future princely struggles that would plague Ayutthaya for about another century. As his son was dead, Ekathotsarot did not appoint his second son, Prince Sri Saowabhak, Uparaja, as expected. It was said that Ekathotsarot died of depression following the Prince Suthat incident, in 1620. Prince Sri Saowabhak succeeded to the throne anyway. Prince Chula Chakrabongse states, \\"the king went insane before he died in 1620. His younger son, who had killed the elder brother when their father was alive but helpless, now seized the throne.\\" He became King Songtam, \\"The Pious\\" or \\"The Just\\", after he repented his act.

Western Australia has a proud history in interstate football, having a successful historical record and winning three Australian Championships and a State of Origin Carnival Championship, in the State of Origin era. Western Australia has a long and intense rivalry with Victoria. The 1986 game between Western Australia and Victoria is \\"regarded by many people as one of the greatest games ‚Äì not just in State of Origin ‚Äì but in the 150 years of Australian Football\\". The rivalry with Victoria stems from before State of Origin started clubs in the Victorian Football League (VFL), being the richest league, used to sign many of the best players from interstate and the standard rules prior to 1977 were that all VFL players played interstate football for Victoria. Also contributing a feeling in Western Australia that Victoria never gave them the credit they deserve, despite some of the best players of all time coming from the state. The rivalry with Victoria is characterised in the West Coast Eagles first song, with the line \\"for years they took the best of us and claimed them for their own, but now we've got them back again\\", referring to the VFL making Western Australian players play for Victoria. History Western Australia played several interstate matches annually from 1904 until when State of Origin ended in 1999. Western Australia has participated in every Australian National Football Carnival, and always in section 1 when there were divisions. Throughout the majority of the team's history its players came from the West Australian Football League. Between 1977 and 1999 West Australian players in the Victorian Football League played State of Origin football for the Sandgropers. Western Australia has won three State of Origin Carnival championships. The 1980s were Western Australia's most successful period, winning the Australian Championship three times. Western Australia won the historic first State of Origin game against Victoria in 1977 by 94 points. This game was a significant endorsement of the concept as a Victorian team had defeated the West Australian team under the previous selection rules by 64 points in the same year.Full Points Footy Rivalries Victoria Although Western Australia has a very strong rivalry with South Australia, the rivalry with Victoria is the state's strongest. Western Australia's rivalry stems from dislike coming from a number of reasons, like a feeling in Western Australia that Victoria never gave them the credit they deserve, despite some of the best players of all time coming from the state. It has been described that Western Australia has disdain for Victoria. Some games widely regarded as some of the best in the history of Australian football were played between Western Australia and Victoria in the 1980s. Some include the games in 1986 and 1984, which were high scoring, with multiple high goal scorers. Leigh Matthews in a game against Western Australia knocked out Barry Cable with a high hit, at Subiaco Oval. The incident caused an enormous amount of angst in Western Australia. Shane Parker a former Western Australia player, has stated about his memories of State of Origin growing up \\"Oh, when I was a kid the State of Origin games were the greatest ever. It was a really big thing to see the WA side play, particularly against Victoria\\". Paul Roos has stated about State of Origin games against Western Australia, saying from an early age I was glued to the Television hoping Victoria would destroy Western Australia. The entire Western Australian team that won the 1961 Interstate Carnival was inducted into the Western Australian Hall of Champions, because they won a breakthrough carnival, which had been dominated by Victoria.

Legal nurse consultants assist attorneys in reading medical records and understanding medical terminology and healthcare issues to achieve the best results for their clients.\\"What is an LNC?\\" on the American Association of Legal Nurse Consultants website The specialty is a relatively recent one, beginning in the mid-1980s. A legal nurse consultant bridges gaps in an attorney's knowledge. While the attorney is an expert on legal issues, the legal nurse consultant is an expert on nursing and the health care system. A legal nurse consultant screens cases for merit, assists with discovery, conducts the existing literature and medical research, reviews medical records, identifies standards of care, prepares reports and summaries on the extent of injury or illness, creates demonstrative evidence, and locates or acts as an expert witness. The legal nurse consultant acts as a specialized member of the litigation team whose professional contributions are often critical to achieving a fair and just outcome for all parties. A legal nurse consultant differs from a paralegal in that a paralegal assists attorneys in the delivery of legal services and frequently requires a legal education, while a legal nurse consultant is first and foremost a practitioner of nursing, and legal education is not necessarily a prerequisite. A legal nurse consultant uses existing expertise as a health care professional to consult and educate clients on specific medical and nursing issues in their cases. Aside from within law firms, legal nurse consultants may also work for government agencies, insurance companies and health maintenance organizations, in hospitals as part of the risk management department, and may also be in independent practice. The American Association of Legal Nurse Consultants which was founded in 1989, is a non-profit membership organization whose mission is to promote legal nurse consulting as a nursing speciality.\\"Mission and Goals\\" on the American Association of Legal Nurse Consultants website The Association also promulgates a Code of Ethics for the Legal Nurse Consultant practitioner.\\"Codes of Ethics\\" on the American Association of Legal Nurse Consultants website As of 2001, the Association had approximately 4,000 members, the majority of whom had joined after 1994. There are a number of training courses and certifications available for legal nurse consultants. The American Legal Nurse Consultant Certification Board offers an online examination which is the only certification exam credited by the American Board of Nursing Specialties.\\"LNCC\\" on the American Association of Legal Nurse Consultants website Other training and certification programs are available from both commercial and non-commercial organizations.

Large landlords, especially kings and churches, had extensive networks of associated farms with a central administration. This central administration was the seat of the landlord or his local administrator, the Meier. The importance and size ranged from barely better than any other local farm to a big business with a number of unfree vassal farms, a manor house, several outbuildings and fenced paddocks. Often the Meierhof included a chapel or church for the noble. Directly owned by the Meierhof was the so-called Salland or personal land. The Salland generally consisted arable land, but could also include pastures, forests, special crops such as vineyards and orchards, or special facilities such as mills and fish ponds. The Meierhof also had a number of dependent peasants who were obliged to pay taxes and provide forced labor on the farm. While the building might be leased to another tenant later, the name often remained with the building. Especially in northern Germany today, many of these buildings are still known as Meierhof.

It had its world premiere at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival on January 19, 2007. It was released on November 28, 2007, by Fox Searchlight Pictures. It received critical acclaim. At the 80th Academy Awards, it earned two nominations: Best Actress (for Linney) and Best Original Screenplay (for Jenkins). At the 65th Golden Globe Awards, it was nominated for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy (for Seymour Hoffman). Plot After drifting apart emotionally over the years, two single siblings ‚Äî Jon (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and Wendy (Laura Linney), the younger of the two ‚Äî band together to care for their estranged, elderly father, Lenny (Philip Bosco), who is rapidly slipping into dementia. Wendy and Jon first travel to Sun City, Arizona to attend the funeral of their father's girlfriend of 20 years. When they arrive, they are told that their father signed a non-marriage agreement and will not have rights to any of her property. They then move him to a nursing home in Buffalo, where Jon is a theater professor working on a book about Bertolt Brecht. Wendy, who is an aspiring, but unsuccessful, playwright, moves from New York City to help establish their father in Buffalo. Neither of the siblings are close with Lenny. It is implied that he was a physically and emotionally abusive father when Jon and Wendy were growing up and they cut him out of their lives. They were also abandoned by their mother at a young age. Their dysfunctional family life appears to have left Wendy and Jon emotionally crippled and unable to sustain a relationship. She is sleeping with an unattainable married man 13 years her senior and Jon cannot commit to a Polish woman who must return to Krak√≥w after her visa expires. Their visits to the nursing home and their father's eventual death allow them to reevaluate their lives and to grow emotionally. In the end, Wendy has broken up with her married lover, but has adopted his dog, which he had planned to put down. She is also seen working on the production of her play about their terrible childhood, while Jon is leaving for a conference in Poland where it is suggested he may reconnect with the woman he had let go. The film closes with Wendy running with her lover's dog alive, running with the aid of a wheeled hip cast, suggesting a mode of flawed yet persevering life for both siblings.

As of October 14, 2012, the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 89% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 113 reviews.

Known members of the police and military forces on Earth defending or aiding against the Visitor horde are detailed below. U.S. President William \\"Wild Bill\\" Brent Morrow William Morrow was the President of the United States and a former Air Force pilot who served in the Vietnam War. During the First Invasion, Morrow was kidnapped by the Visitors and was held prisoner on the New York Mothership for most of the war. During his captivity, the Visitors subjected him to the conversion process. However, agents of the Fifth Column helped him escape before his brainwashing was completed and he aided the New York \\"White Christmas\\" group when attacking the Visitor's ground headquarters (though no-one knew his real identity as he simply went by the name of \\"Bill\\"), and helped rebuild the government after the Visitors were driven from the Earth by the Red Dust. One year after Liberation Day, Morrow and the rest of the government went underground to prevent being captured by the Visitors and now directs what is left of the U.S. Military to aid the Resistance, which has become the world's last line of defense. Defense Secretary Farley \\"Moose\\" Mason Farley Mason is the Secretary of Defense and an old friend of President Morrow, normally using his old nickname of \\"Wild Bill\\" and Morrow addressed him by his nickname of \\"Moose\\". Though he sometimes appears lax, lazy and doesn't take his job seriously, he takes his job to heart and knows when to be serious. When the First Invasion began, Morrow and Mason were abducted by the Visitors and Mason was successfully converted. However, when the New York Mothership was captured by the Fifth Column and its population freed, Mason was freed from the effects of his brainwashing. When the Second Invasion began, he along with the rest of the government went underground to prevent being captured and converted again. Mason now commands what's left of the U.S. Military and is directing them to help the Resistance whenever he can. General Curtis Morgan Curtis Morgan is a high-ranking general in the U.S. Military and commands a large portion of the country's remaining ground and air defensive forces. When the Second Invasion began, Morgan was hoping to use the Red Dust on them, but Nathan Bates revealed the dangers of using it. Nevertheless, Morgan and Bates agreed to formulate a doomsday weapon of massive amounts of Red Dust linked to explosives, that would destroy all life on Earth, along with all the Visitor armies, should the war end in their favour and was named \\"Code: Delta\\". Morgan currently leads the military forces against the Visitors, but waits for the day when \\"Code: Delta\\" can be initiated. General Loman Loman was a general in the U.S. Military and loyally serves as Defense Secretary Mason's right-hand man during the First Invasion. Unlike Mason, who was converted, Loman retained his freedom and continued the fight against the Visitors until the Red Dust was deployed. He again joined the fight when the Second Invasion began one year after Liberation Day and now helps to lead what's left of the U.S. military against the Visitors. Federal Agent Barnabas Barnabas was a federal agent in the U.S. government. Just after the end of the First Invasion, Barnabas and two other federal agents attempted to free Diana under orders from \\"individuals\\" within the government who hoped to use her to learn about Visitor technology, but was stopped and arrested. Federal Agent Stover Stover was a federal agent in the U.S. government. Just after the end of the First Invasion, Stover and two other federal agents attempted to free Diana under orders from \\"individuals\\" within the government who hoped to use her to learn about Visitor technology, but was stopped and arrested.  Colonel Kent Fletcher  Kent Fletcher was a high-ranking colonel in the National Guard and leads a complement of 300 men. Though he helped fight the Visitors, he sought to gain more power by taking advantage of the growing power vacuum following the Visitors fleeing the Earth. He led a coup against the local governor with help from Lieutenant Dennis W. Simon and planned to use it to eventually take control of the entire U.S. government, but was stopped by the Resistance and taken into custody by the Military Police.  Major Garret  Garret was a major in the National Guard and a member of Kent Fletcher's senior staff. Garret supported Fletcher's coup over the local government, but the coup was stopped by the Resistance and Garret was taken into custody by the Military Police.  Lieutenant Casey  Casey was a lieutenant in the National Guard and a member of Kent Fletcher's senior staff. Casey supported Fletcher's coup over the local government, but the coup was stopped by the Resistance and Casey was taken into custody by the Military Police.  Lieutenant Dennis W. Simon  Dennis W. Simon was a lieutenant in the National Guard under Colonel Kent Fletcher's command. Despite his low rank, Simon was very powerful and usurped the local governor and placed the entire state into martial law, as a stepping stone for Fletcher to take control of the country. However, the coup failed because of the Resistance and Simon was taken into custody by the Military Police. Lieutenant Wallace Wallace was a lieutenant in the National Guard under Colonel Kent Fletcher's command. Wallace supported Fletcher's coup over the local government, but the coup was stopped by the Resistance and Casey was taken into custody by the Military Police.  Captain Broadbent  Broadbent was a captain in the National Guard under Colonel Kent Fletcher's command. Unlike most of his comrades, Broadbent was hesitant to use such extreme force on the Resistance and didn't think Fletcher's coup was a good idea. Nevertheless, he followed his orders as any other loyal soldier would, but the coup failed and Broadbent was taken into custody by the Military Police.  Corporal Tom  Tom was a corporal in the National Guard under Colonel Kent Fletcher's command. Unlike most of his comrades, Tom was hesitant to use such extreme force on the Resistance and didn't think Fletcher's coup was a good idea. Nevertheless, he followed his orders as any other loyal soldier would, but the coup failed and Tom was taken into custody by the Military Police. Private Higgins Higgins was a private in the National Guard under Colonel Kent Fletcher's command. Unlike most of his comrades, Higgins was hesitant to use such extreme force on the Resistance and didn't think Fletcher's coup was a good idea. Nevertheless, he followed his orders as any other loyal soldier would, but the coup failed and Higgins was taken into custody by the Military Police. Private Stockwell Stockwell was a private in the National Guard under Colonel Kent Fletcher's command. Unlike most of his comrades, Stockwell was hesitant to use such extreme force on the Resistance and didn't think Fletcher's coup was a good idea. Nevertheless, he followed his orders as any other loyal soldier would, but the coup failed and Stockwell was taken into custody by the Military Police. Police Captain Emil Jonkers Emil Jonkers was a police captain with 18 police officers under his command.

When the Visitor's power over the city grew, Sam steadily recognized that the police no longer controlled law and order, and defected to the newly made \\"White Christmas\\" Resistance group. He fought alongside the group throughout the First Invasion, and when the Visitors were defeated, rejoined the police to restore order in the power vacuum that followed.

It was the group's first album and was recorded at Mobius Music in San Francisco in March 1987. The album was released in 1987 in the United States by Rhino Records on LP, CD and cassette. The CD release contained two extra tracks. The album was reissued in 2008 by Fledg'ling Records with five extra tracks recorded live at the Ashkenaz in Berkeley, California. Live, Love, Larf & Loaf was released in Borneo and Sumatra with the title Dead Man's Gloom. Reception Music critic Robert Christgau called the album \\"an ad hoc collaboration that sounds as good as it reads\\". Mark Deming at AllMusic described it as \\"[an] oddball delight from four truly gifted musicians\\", adding that while Kaiser, Frith and French's \\"avant-leaning art rock\\" is toned down by the presence of Thompson's folk-rock guitar, it does not detract from the album's appeal. In a review in the Santa Ana Orange County Register, Jim Washburn wrote that the album is \\"a fresh surprise even after repeated listenings\\", and called it \\"one of the year's best\\".

It was developed by Steven Faber for the Apple II and published by Strategic Simulations in 1982. It was ported to the Atari 8-bit family. Plot A meteorite crashes into Earth, bringing with it an alien virus. The player must stem the epidemic across 14 regions quickly as possible and with minimal loss of life. Gameplay The player has from 15 to 30 turns, with options ranging from inert methods like interferon, to quarantine, to destruction of a region with nuclear weapons. The game has four difficulty levels, ranging from small controllable scenarios of approximately 20 minutes at level 4, to full one-hour campaigns with severe difficulty at level 1. Reception Johnny L. Wilson reviewed the game for Computer Gaming World, and stated that \\"In conclusion, Epidemic is a good beginning level strategy game with excellent graphics. The game provides a real challenge to constantly better your score by curing the world as fast as you can.\\" In a 1983 review for Creative Computing, Brian J. Murphy wrote, \\"The game system is easy to master, and play is smooth,\\" and \\"The documentation is entertainingly written and supports the program well, but even without the manual and player aid cards, a first time gamer stands a good chance of picking up the rules just by booting the disk and following the prompts.\\" References External links *Epidemic at Atari Mania Category:1982 video games Category:Apple II games Category:Atari 8-bit family games Category:Strategic Simulations games Category:Strategy video games Category:Video games developed in the United States ","title":"Epidemic!"},{"id":"11744269","text":"Forgotten Voices of the Great War is a collection of interviews with people who lived through the First World War.The book is part of the Imperial War Museum's oral archive. In 1960, the Imperial War Museum began a momentous and important task. A team of academics, archivists and volunteers set about tracing WWI veterans and interviewing them at length in order to record the experiences of ordinary individuals in war. The IWM aural archive has become the most important archive of its kind in the world. Authors have occasionally been granted access to the vaults, but digesting the thousands of hours of footage is a monumental task. Author Max Arthur puts the interviews into chronological and campaign order, and provides some context about the events that surround the memories. The book includes testimonies from Harry Patch, Philip Neame, Horace Birks, Edmund Blunden, Douglas Wimberley, Mabel Lethbridge, Reginald Leonard Haine, Edward Spears, Godfrey Buxton, Henry Williamson, Tom Adlam, Cecil Arthur Lewis, Montagu Cleeve, Charles Carrington, Keith Officer and Norman Demuth. Now, forty years on, the Imperial War Museum has at last given author Max Arthur and his team of researchers unlimited access to the complete WWI tapes. These are the forgotten voices of an entire generation of survivors of the Great War. The resulting book is an important and compelling history of WWI in the words of those who experienced it. This book has also been dramatized for the stage by the playwright Malcolm McKay.

Liptov () is a historical and geographical region in central Slovakia with around 140,000 inhabitants. The area is also known by the German name Liptau, the Polish Lipt√≥w, the Hungarian Lipt√≥ and the Latin name Liptovium. Etymology The name is derived from some Slavic personal name beginning with ƒΩub- with a possessive suffix -ov. ƒΩ√∫bi≈• ‚Äì to love, derived personal names are ƒΩubom√≠r, ƒΩubota (potentially the Czech House of Lubota) and others. E.g. ƒΩubtov (pronunciation ƒΩuptov) - ƒΩubota's castle or his territory. The form ƒΩuptov has been preserved in Orava and in a frequent Slovak surname ƒΩupt√°k (Liptovian). History The first known inhabitants came to Liptov during the Neolithic age around 6000 years ago. Celts represent an important time period of Liptov during the Iron Age. The Celtic tribal village can be seen in the archeological site of Havr√°nok near Liptovsk√Ω Mikul√°≈°. The first settlements of Slavic people in Liptov region began approximately in the 6th century BC. The first written evidence about Liptov came from 1231 AD during the rule of the Hungarian king Andrew II when Liptov was a permanent comitatus (county) of the Kingdom of Hungary. The dissolution of Austro-Hungarian monarchy in 1918 led to the creation of Czechoslovakia as a successor country, including Liptov as one of the integral regions of the new state. After the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993, Liptov became the region of present-day Slovakia. There are currently three remains of castles that were built in the Liptov region. They are the Likava castle, the Liptov castle, and the Liptovsk√Ω Hr√°dok castle. Liptov is also a place where the legendary Slovak figure of the 17th and 18th century, Juraj J√°no≈°√≠k, was sentenced to death. Geography Likava Castle, Likavka Historical and cultural centres of Liptov are the towns of Liptovsk√Ω Mikul√°≈°, Ru≈æomberok and Liptovsk√Ω Hr√°dok. Liptov is surrounded by the highest mountains in Slovakia: High Tatras, West Tatras and Choƒçsk√© vrchy from the north, Low Tatras from the south and Greater Fatra from the west. The longest Slovak river of V√°h runs through Liptov and fills the important water reservoir of Liptovsk√° Mara. There are two Slovak national parks with the highest level of protection in the territory of Liptov, they are the Tatra National Park and the Low Tatras National Park. Tourism Jasn√° ski resort Liptov is one of the most visited regions in Slovakia. There are four public caves: Dem√§novsk√° Cave of Liberty, Dem√§novsk√° Ice Cave, Va≈æeck√° Cave and Stani≈°ovsk√° Cave, the biggest ski resort in Slovakia, Jasn√°, ski park Malin√¥ Brdo, thermal parks of Tatralandia in Liptovsk√Ω Mikul√°≈° and Be≈°e≈àov√° and water worlds Gothal in Liptovsk√° Osada and Thermal Paradise in Liptovsk√Ω J√°n as well as a UNESCO World Heritage Site of Vlkol√≠nec. The list of museums and galleries include: Liptov Museum and ƒΩudov√≠t Fulla Gallery in Ru≈æomberok, Slovak Museum of Nature Protection and Spelology, Gallery of P.M. Boh√∫≈à and the Centre of Koloman Sokol in Liptovsk√Ω Mikul√°≈°. Liptov has a rich tradition of folklore culture. The annual folklore festival in the village of V√Ωchodn√° is the biggest folklore event in Slovakia attracting thousands of visitors from all around Europe. The Liptov region has a number of fine churches. In Sv√§t√Ω Kr√≠≈æ, south of the reservoir, is a large 'articular' wooden church belonging to the same group as the one in Hronsek, near Bansk√° Bystrica (see the article in the section on Bansk√° Bystrica Region). This is one of the largest wooden religious buildings in Europe and, like the buildings at Pribylina, was also rescued from the water (it was originally built in the now-vanished village of Paludza). And in the small village of Ni≈æn√© Matia≈°ovce, at the start of the precipitous route from Liptov to Zuberec (in the Orava valley), is a beautiful wooden-roofed church with defensive stone walls and bastions. Liptov has two other big tourist draws: a pair of large geo-thermal aquaparks, at Be≈°e≈àov√° (near Ru≈æomberok) and Tatralandia (near Liptovsk√Ω Mikul√°≈°); and the Dem√§novsk√° valley. On the way up the tree-lined Dem√§novsk√° valley, are two large limestone cave complexes open to the public, the first of which is an ice cave (where the subterranean climate has formed a sort of underground glacier). The second, the Dem√§novsk√° Cave of Freedom, is a huge complex of galleries featuring many stalactites and stalagmites.

An Eternal who called himself Striker explains to the Doctor that he and his people live outside of time, in the realm of eternity. They consider the mortal inhabitants of the universe to be \\"Ephemerals\\", including even the Time Lords of the planet Gallifrey. Striker seems completely unaware of the existence of the Time Lords before meeting the Doctor. In the Enlightenment serial, the Doctor eventually realizes that the Eternals are powerful enough to manipulate matter, creating objects out of thin air; they also read minds effortlessly through telepathy. They lack imagination and creativity, indeed saying they were empty and lost without Ephemeral thought to entertain and challenge them, and thus were dependent on Ephemerals to keep them active and prevent them from withering away in boredom. Without Ephemerals, the Eternals have no purpose. On one occasion, the Doctor manages to outwit an Eternal attempt to destroy a rival ship by throwing a planted explosive target off the ship, noting that the Eternals couldn't have accomplished that because they lacked the imagination to think of such an action. This dependence was not something they liked admitting to, however, and they made boasts several times of how they could manipulate the reality around them through sheer force of will. Despite this great power, they deferred to the Guardians of Time, specifically the White Guardian and the Black Guardian, who offered the Eternals \\"enlightenment\\" ‚Äì complete knowledge of good and evil ‚Äì if they won a cosmic race. The Eternals captured many Ephemerals to win the race for them, hence accidentally bringing about the attention of the Doctor who immediately saw them as a threat. They have been mentioned in the new TV series that began in 2005. In the episode \\"Army of Ghosts,\\" the Doctor mentioned the existence of a \\"nowhere place\\" that exists between parallel universes and alternate timelines, saying that his people called it the Void while \\"the Eternals called it the Howling.\\" In the later episode \\"The Shakespeare Code\\" (2007), the alien witches called Carrionites claimed that the Eternals banished them \\"into deep darkness\\" soon after the \\"dawn of the universe.\\" Other appearances In the Doctor Who Magazine story \\"Uninvited Guests\\", the Doctor used the force of the Time Vortex itself to punish the evil Eternal called Lord Prospero by bringing him into \\"the domain of Time.\\" So it seems that under the right circumstances, an Eternal can become an Ephemeral. In the BBC Books spin-off novel The Quantum Archangel by Craig Hinton, it is mentioned that the Eternals co-exist with the Chronovores, Reapers, and the Guardians in Calabi-Yau Space, which is composed of six dimensions as opposed to our universe which is composed of five. It was also mentioned that Chronovores and Eternals were forbidden from mixing with each other, with this 'Covenant' being broken when a Chronovore and Eternal mate and conceive a child; although both parents are erased from history as punishment, their child survives to become Kronos, regarded as the greatest of the Chronovores, who is encountered by the Third Doctor when the Master seeks to control Kronos in The Time Monster. The New Adventures range of Doctor Who novels published by Virgin Publishing featured the frequent appearance of an Eternal who called herself Death and seemed to be, in nearly every way, a personification of death itself. Some of the novels later stated that Death, along with Time and other Eternals, were worshiped as gods on ancient Gallifrey. The Doctor first met Death while in his seventh incarnation in the novel Timewyrm: Revelation. While battling the cosmically powered Timewyrm, the villain seemed to conjure up a representation of death that the Seventh Doctor then danced with. But this was not a creation of the Timewyrm's but rather the Eternal named Death who had been summoned by the Timewyrm's power. Death taunted the Seventh Doctor in several books after that. In the novel Love and War by Paul Cornell, a dream sequence showed a conversation between the Doctor and Death and implied that the Doctor, while in his sixth incarnation, had actually planned his own death and rebirth into the seventh in order to become \\"Time's Champion.\\" Death seemed to imply that she had been directly involved in this plan of action and that it may have resulted after a deal the Doctor made with her. In the audio play Master, the Master is described as Death's Champion, just as the Seventh Doctor was said to be \\"Time's Champion.\\" The audio play depicted how the Doctor made a deal with Death that she would make his arch- enemy the Master into a good man who did good things. Death agreed to this and gave the Master complete amnesia, after which she set him in a town called Perfugiam. He became a well-respected and loved physician named \\"John Smith\\" (coincidentally, an alias the Doctor himself has often used). But in return for turning the villain into a good man, Death said that the Doctor would have to kill him after ten years. The Doctor couldn't bring himself to commit this murder and soon afterwards Death restored the Master's memories, returning him to his villainous ways and making him hate the Doctor even more now for having stolen ten years of his life and \\"neutering\\" him. In that same audio play, Death said that the Doctor had once killed a boy in self-defense when he was still just a child on Gallifrey. She said that she came to the Doctor afterwards in a dream and offered him a chance to be free of the guilt and memory of this crime, but that if he asked for it his best friend would be stricken with this guilt and memory instead. According to Death, the young boy who would become the Doctor agreed to this bargain and his friend believed he had done the killing instead. That friend eventually became the Master. Whether or not this account of Death's was true isn't known and can't really be proven, though the Seventh Doctor was very worried that he felt it was true and that perhaps he was responsible for beginning the Master's descent into darkness (although the Master's good side assured the Doctor that he didn't blame the Doctor for the actions he had committed as a child when he could not understand what was being offered). In the novel So Vile a Sin, Death visits the Doctor when he suffers a heart attack ‚Äî in only one heart ‚Äî while attending the funeral of his companion Roz Forrester, telling him that she is coming for him directly very soon and that when he dies it will be alone, without companions and without meaning. This was meant to reference the Seventh Doctor's rather abrupt and lonely death in the 1996 Doctor Who television movie which had been released not too long before the book was published. An article by Russell T Davies in the Doctor Who Annual 2006 stated that during the Last Great Time War between the Time Lords and the Daleks, the Eternals were so affected by the violence and the damage to space and time that they left the mainstream five-dimensional universe completely, never to be seen again.

Early Life and Priestly Ministry Daniel Mageean was born in the townland of Darragh Cross in the parish of Saintfield, Co. Down and received secondary education at St Malachy's College and St Patrick's College, Maynooth. He was ordained priest in 1906. His older sister Mary (McCall) became the first President of the Apostolic Work in 1924 indicating the faith and commitment of his wider family where there were others vocations to religious life. http://www.apostolicwork.ie/about/history/ While his mother was a sister of the late Dr Richard Marner, who served as President of St. Malachy's College from 1866 - 1876 and then Parish Priest of Kilkeel until his death in 1906. http://www.visitkilkeel.com/history-heritage/ His first pastoral appointment was a summer curacy in Glenavy parish in July 1907 and on September 1st that year he was transferred to St Malachy's College where he taught both English Literature and Latin and served as Dean of Discipline. In 1919 Fr Mageean he appointed Junior Dean at St. Patrick's College, Maynooth becoming Senior Dean in 1925. Episcopal Ministry On May 31st 1929 he was nominated Bishop of Down and Connor and received episcopal consecration in St Patrick's Church, Belfast on August 25th 1929. http://www.gcatholic.org/hierarchy/new/1929c.htm In the 1930s he was a champion of Catholic rights especially after the anti-Catholic riots of 1935. He claimed that almost 400 Catholic families, totally nearly 1600 people had been driven from their homes. Dr. Mageean succeeded in getting the anti- Catholic nature of much of Northern Ireland life raised in the House of Commons at Westminster but his efforts came to naught and he resigned himself to a long period of sterility as prime ecclesiastical leader of demoralised Northern Irish Catholics. A flavour of the struggles Bishop Mageean faced are considered in Jonathan Bardon's magisterial work on this history of Ulster.http://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/schools/agreement/reconciliation/support/rec2_c012.shtml Bishop Mageean often used his Lenten Pastoral letter to address issues of wider social and political concern e.g. his 1938 letter on Partition and the persecution of Catholics in Northern Ireland.http://sources.nli.ie/Record/PS_UR_067168 In 1939, he coined the much-quoted phrase \\"A Protestant Parliament for a Protestant People\\", attributing it to his opponent Prime Minister Lord Craigavon, but that was a slight misquotation.Actual text from the 1934 Stormont debates He died on the 17 January 1962 and was succeeded by the Bishop of Clonfert, William Philbin. The Mageean Cup awarded annually to the winners of the Ulster Colleges' Senior Hurling Championship is named after him. http://www.danskebankulsterschoolsgaa.com/history/mageean-cup/ See also Notes Category:1882 births Category:1962 deaths Category:People from County Down Category:Roman Catholic bishops of Down and Connor Category:20th- century Roman Catholic bishops Category:People educated at St Malachy's College Category:Alumni of St Patrick's College, Maynooth ","title":"Daniel Mageean"}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:B}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},I={class:"card-container"};function R(s,e,o,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),n(h,null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("section",null,[a("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâ your ETHü•≥")])])],-1)),a("section",null,[a("div",I,[(t(!0),n(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,g)=>(t(),w(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):b("",!0)])],64)}const D=d(P,[["render",R]]),F=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"sponsor/18.md","filePath":"sponsor/18.md"}'),H={name:"sponsor/18.md"},x=Object.assign(H,{setup(s){return(e,o)=>(t(),n("div",null,[v(D)]))}});export{F as __pageData,x as default};
