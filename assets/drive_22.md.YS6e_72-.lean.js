Emergence of Space in the Kinematic Structure  In an articleFurkan Semih Dündar and Barış Tamer Tonguç. Emergence of Spacetime in Quantum Shape Kinematics. arXiv:1511.09197 recently revised, a quantum gravity phenomenon known as the emergence of space is observed for a universe consisting of N protons and electrons. The reason is the angular momentum constraint in shape dynamics in the presence of spin-1/2 particles:vec J psirangle = vec L psirangle + vec S psirangle = 0Because of this constraint, the expectation value of L^2 and S^2 is the same. Classical shape dynamics requires the expectation value of the former operator to vanish. It is related to non-existence of an absolute space. (En passé, non-existence of absolute time is related to the Hamiltonian constraint: Hpsirangle = 0.) However, there are states that yields a positive eigenvalue for S^2 and hence for L^2 while satisfying the total angular momentum constraint for spin-1/2 particles: vec Jpsirangle = 0. The article found out that the density of states in the total spin Hilbert space (which is of 2^N dimensional) that yields a zero expectation value for S^2 and L^2 as:f_0^N = frac{N!}{2^N (N/2+1)!(N/2)!}when N is even, and zero when it is odd. The limit of this expression approaches zero as Ntoinfty. Hence it is argued that the space is almost always emergent classically for kinematic states.

She was most noted in her lifetime for her community leadership and advocacy for Caribbean migrants to France. Since her death, her written works, which explore themes of alienation, exploitation, and nationalism, have been recognized as an important voice for French Antillean women in the period between the end of the Second World War and the end to colonization. Early life Françoise Marcelle Modock was born on 11 November 1920 in Le Morne-Rouge, Martinique to the seamstress Déhé Partel and gamekeeper, Claude Modock. Modock was raised in Martinique and took a secretarial course, earning a typing diploma before she moved to France during World War II. There she met and married Franz Ega on 8 May 1946 in Paris. Her husband was a soldier, which led the couple to live in several African countries before they settled in Marseille, where four of her five children were born. Career Ega was very involved in the Caribbean community in Marseille. She founded after-school programs for children and tutored children in both school studies and Catholic catechism. She was an organizer of the French West Indian-Guyanese soccer team and founded two organizations the Association of Antillean and Guyanese Workers () and the Antillo-Guyanese Cultural and Sports Association () to foster participation by migrants from the French Antilles and French Guiana in sporting and cultural events. As an educated woman, Ega also helped migrants with paperwork and transactions related to carrying out their day-to-day activities, as well as giving adult literacy lessons. Active in politics and union activities, she strongly advocated for the protection of public spaces, such as parks, swimming pools and stadiums. She worked with Séverin Montarello to create the Espace Culturel Busserine, the first neighborhood center in the area. In the 1960s, Ega produced two autobiographical novels, Le temps des Madras (1966) and Lettres à une noire, which was not published until after her death in 1978. The first, was a series of poems, which recalled Ega's childhood experiences in Martinique. In Lettres à une noire, she explored themes that were common to many Caribbean migrants in the post-war period: alienation, exploitation, migration, nationalism, as well as classism, racism and gender. After hearing tales of women migrants of their difficulties as domestics, Ega took a position as a housekeeper to be able to write about the experience. Thus, in Lettres, she describes herself as a woman, negro, housekeeper, in that order, to show that she has no authority, no rights, and is nameless. The novel relays the treatment which black domestics endured, a world where their labor was important, but they were not. Where workers were expected to silently carry out tasks ignoring their own need for food or relief, as if the work were done not by humans, but by nameless objects. Her works, along with a few other contemporary Caribbean writers, critique the French efforts to manage their colonies in the postwar period. Ega spoke of the stratified society, the low wages migrants were paid, the lack of education. Death and legacy Ega died on 8 March 1976 in Marseille. After her death, a plaque was installed to commemorate her works at the Busserine Cultural Centre and a committee was established to maintain her legacy of community service. The committee has also continued to publish posthumous works. In 1978, they released Lettres à une noire; in 1992 Le pin de Magneu was published; and in 2000, the Mam’Ega Committee published L’Alizé ne soufflait plus, which explores a young Martinican couple's experiences in France at the end of the war.

A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. A partial solar eclipse occurs in the polar regions of the Earth when the center of the Moon's shadow misses the Earth. It was one of four partial eclipses that took place that year, each two in two months, the last one was on February 12 and covered a part of the Northern Hemisphere. The next eclipse was on August 7 1812 in a smaller part of where the eclipse happened in the same year. Description The eclipse was visible in southeastern Australia which included New South Wales which included the modern southeast portion, most of present-day Victoria and present-day Australian Capital Territory, the time the southernmost part of southern Australia (now a state), at the time also called New Holland and the island of Tasmania, there it showed up to 15% obscurity. It was also visible the southwesternmost part of New Zealand's South Island where it showed up to 25% obscurity, the southeast Indian Ocean and the southwesternmost portion of the Pacific and most of Antarctica except for the northcentral part and the peninsular portion, in that continent, it showed from 5% obscurity at 50th longitude east up to near 50% at the greatest eclipse. The eclipse started in the middle of northern Antarctica at about the 20th longitude east at sunrise east and finished in southwestern New Zealand and within the range of the 180th longitude. The edge of the eclipse was at the area around Parramatta, New South Wales. It showed about up to 15% obscurity in Africa, south of 60, it shown up to over 50% obscurity of the sun. The greatest eclipse was in the Pacific Ocean just near Ross Sea which happened at 6:19 UTC (18:19 local time) at the furthermost area of the Southwestern Hemisphere (sometimes as the Southwestern Tetrasphere).

He was born in San Sebastián, Spain, and lived his later years in Cuba, Venezuela, and Mexico.  Career  Among his earliest works are La melindrosa (lyrics by Enrique F. Gutiérrez-Roig and Luis Gabaldón) and performed at the Teatro de la Latino in Madrid, April 15, 1921, and El príncipe azul, a comic opera in one act (lyrics by Julio Torres and Rafael Robledo) and performed at the Teatro Ruzafa, in Valencia, Spain, on December 14, 1923. On November 8, 1931, he directed an operetta at the Teatro Nacional, in which Caridad Suárez Valdés interpreted the role of 'Valencienne' in the La viuda alegre, alongside Esperanza Iris as ‘Ana de Glavary’, Manolo Villa as ‘Danilo’ and Panchito Naya as ‘Rosillón’. Muguerza directed Los diamantes de la corona at the Teatro Nacional January 30, 1932, with Panchito Naya, Estelita Echazábal and Paco Salas.http://www.vivalavoz.net/SuarezCaridad.html Leaving prior to the beginning of Spain's civil war (1936–39), Severo traveled to Latin America with Palmira Tomas, an opera singer from Barcelona, and her sister Carmen, also a soprano star, to Caracas, Venezuela; Cuba; and later Mexico, settling in Cuernavaca. Spain's civil war (July 18, 1936 to April 1, 1939) changed Mexico's cultural life overnight. The civil war killed millions and brought thousands of intellectuals, musicians, and actors to Argentina, Colombia, Venezuela, and Mexico. Spanish musicians and actors joined Mexico's golden age of cinema, contributing themes based on civil war and injustice. Severo Muguerza along with Antonio Díaz Conde, Gustavo Pittaluga, and Rodolfo Halffer wrote film scores for Venezuela's and Mexico's film industry between 1940 and 1945. Severo composed movie scores for Destino de Mujer (1934) filmed in Venezuela and The Eternal Secret (1942), Una Gitana en Mexico (1945), and Adultery (1945) filmed in Mexico.  Personal life  In Spain Muguerza married María Berri, with whom he had two children, actress Esperanza Muguerza Berri, who later married actor Carlos Lemos, and Virgilio Muguerza y Berri who was born in Arroyo Naranjo, La Habana, Cuba, April 14, 1910. On May 2, 1919, Severo departed from San Juan, Puerto Rico, for La Guaya, Venezuela, on the SS Julia. He listed his age as 34 and residence as Spain. On May 29, 1930, Severo again sailed from San Juan, Puerto Rico bound for Santiago de Cuba on the SS Presidente Machado. At this time he listed his residence as Curacao. On April 17, 1933, he listed his residence as Havana, Cuba, and obtained an immigration permit to sail on the SS Presidente Machado from Santiago de Cuba to Puerto Rico and arrived on April 24, 1933. In Mexico Muguerza married Palmira Tomas, and reported that his address was Caracas, Venezuela. On the marriage certificate, Palmira Tomas stated that she was from Barcelona, Spain, but her current address was Aldaco 8, Mexico City. Presiding over the wedding were Rosario Martin from Santander, Spain, and her husband Amador Perez from Asturias, Spain. At the time of her marriage Palmira Tomas had a son named Gustavo Muguerza Tomas who was later adopted by Severo Muguerza. His father was a Czechoslovakian named Sedergreg who had been killed while on a boat transporting refugees during World War II. Her son Gustavo Muguerza Tomas married Carmen Perez, the daughter of Rosario and Amador, and a school administrator in Mexico City's public schools. Palmira's son became a traveling Laggs tea salesman during the 1960s–70s and had two sons, architect Gustavo Muguerza Perez (1947–2015) and Eduardo Muguerza (1948–) Perez. Severo Muguerza died of diabetes around 1952 at the Sanatorio Español in Mexico City.

It is classed as category 3 station and has six platforms. In addition to 3 daily Intercity trains, regional railway trains stop at the station.  History  Northeim was connected to the railway network on 31 July 1854 with the opening of the line from Alfeld to Göttingen (the old North-South Line). On 1 September 1871 the South Harz Railway to Herzberg (Harz) and Nordhausen was opened. With the opening of the Solling Railway to Ottbergen on 15 January 1878, Northeim became an important railway hub. From now on, the railway had a major impact on the development of the town. The bombed out station in April 1945 Heavy air raids in February and April 1945 fully destroyed Northeim station and its representative station hall, which had been built in 1885. After the Second World War, work on rebuilding Northeim station began. In the late 1960s the present station building was constructed; in 1993 a travel centre was built, that replaced the traditional ticket counters. From 1988, trains of the first InterRegio line in the Deutsche Bahn stopped at the station. These services replaced the D-Zug expresses. In December 2002 the InterRegio trains were superseded by 2-hourly Intercity trains. On 15 November 1992 at 1.30 am there was an accident in the immediate vicinity of Northeim station that resulted in 11 deaths and 51 injuries. In 2014 the station was upgraded and modernised at a cost of 6.4 million euros. The western platforms, 1 to 3, have since had a height of 76 cm, the eastern ones, nos. 11 to 13, a height of 55 cm. Presseinformation der DB, retrieved 19 April 2015 In 2016 the underpass on the western side of the station was lengthened.  Connections  = Local services = Northeim lies on the line from Hanover to Frankfurt am Main and Hanover to Würzburg (the old North-South Line), on which the metronom Eisenbahngesellschafttrains have operated hourly since December 2005. In addition the South Harz Railway via Herzberg (Harz) to Nordhausen begins here, as does the Solling Railway to Ottbergen, on which trains run hourly or two-hourly. = Long distance services = Since the timetable change of 2009/2010 in December 2009 the number of Intercity trains calling at Northeim were significantly reduced. The majority of IC services run instead on the Hanoverian Southern Railway on the Hanover–Wurzburg high-speed line. Three pairs of Intercity trains remain in the Leine valley and stop, as was normal until 2009, in Alfeld, Northeim and Kreiensen.Pressemitteilung des Wirtschaftsministeriums auf suedharzstrecke.de, Bericht von Christian Haegele, Kommentare von Michael Reinboth retrieved 19 December 2009 References External links Railway stations in Lower Saxony Buildings and structures in Northeim (district) ","title":"Northeim (Han) station"},{"id":"53444295","text":"Arts syndrome is a rare metabolic disorder that causes serious neurological problems in males due to a malfunction of the PRPP synthetase 1 enzyme. Arts Syndrome is part of a spectrum of PRPS-1 related disorders with reduced activity of the enzyme that includes Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease and X-linked non-syndromic sensorineural deafness.  Signs and symptoms  Males show more serious symptoms than females affected by this disorder. The symptoms for males are: # Profound sensorineural hearing loss i.e, a complete or almost complete loss of hearing caused by abnormalities in the inner ear. # Weak muscle tone - Hypotonia. # Impaired muscle coordination - Ataxia. # Developmental delay. # Intellecual disability. # Vision loss caused by optic nerve atrophy in early childhood. # Peripheral neuropathy. # Recurrent infections, especially in the respiratory system. # Muscle weakness caused by recurrent infections. Symptoms for females: Very rarely seen hearing loss that begins in adulthood (age > 20 years) combined with ataxia and neuropathy. Optic atrophy and retinitis pigmentosa observed in some cases too.  Cause  Arts syndrome is caused by a loss of function mutation in the PRPS1 gene. The PRPS1 gene codes for the enzyme phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase 1 or PRPP synthetase 1. This enzyme is involved in producing purines and pyrimidines which are the building blocks of DNA, RNA, ATP and other molecules. The mutations that cause Arts syndrome replace single amino acids the PRPP synthetase 1 enzyme. The resulting enzyme is unstable. Disruption of purine and pyrimidine production may impair energy storage and transport in cells. Impairment of these processes may have a particularly severe effect on tissues that require a large amount of energy, such as the nervous system, resulting in the neurological problems characteristic of Arts syndrome. The reason for the increased risk of respiratory infections in Arts syndrome is unclear. Novel missense mutation - c.367C>G (p.His123Asp) c.455T→C (p. L152P), c.398A→C (p.Q133P) p. Ile275Thr and p.Gly306Glu  Genetics Arts syndrome follows an X-linked inheritance. In males (who have only one X chromosome), a mutation in the only copy of the gene in each cell causes the disorder. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation in one of the two copies of the gene in each cell sometimes causes features of the disorder; in other cases, these females do not experience any symptoms. In the small number of Arts syndrome cases that have been identified, affected individuals have inherited the mutation from a mother who carries an altered copy of the PRPS1 gene. If the mother is a carrier, the chance of transmitting the PRPS1 mutation in each pregnancy is 50%. Males who inherit the mutation will be affected; females who inherit the mutation will be carriers and may or may not be mildly affected. Males with Arts syndrome do not reproduce. Charcot-Marie- Tooth disease-5, Arts syndrome and X-linked nonsyndromic sensorineural deafness present three clinically distinct but genetically allelic disorders, caused by reduced phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase 1 (PRS1) activity due to PRPS1 mutations. Only three families with CMTX5 and two families Arts syndrome, respectively, have been reported worldwide so far. Thus, evidence is still rare whether these two disorders are separate entities, or rather clusters on a phenotypic continuum of PRPS1-related disease.  Diagnosis  Arts syndrome should be included in the differential diagnosis of infantile hypotonia and weakness aggravated by recurrent infection with a family history of X-linked inheritance. Sequence analysis of PRPS1, the only gene associated with Arts syndrome, has detected mutations in both kindreds reported to date. Arts syndrome patients were also found to have reduced levels of hypoxanthine levels in urine and uric acid levels in the serum. In vitro, PRS-1 activity was reduced in erythrocytes and fibroblasts.  Treatment  Currently, purine replacement via S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) supplementation in people with Arts syndrome appears to improve their condition. This suggests that SAM supplementation can alleviate symptoms of PRPS1 deficient patients by replacing purine nucleotides and open new avenues of therapeutic intervention. Other non-clinical treatment options include educational programs tailored to their individual needs. Sensorineural hearing loss has been treated with cochlear implantation with good results. Ataxia and visual impairment from optic atrophy are treated in a routine manner. Routine immunizations against common childhood infections and annual influenza immunization can also help prevent any secondary infections from occurring. Regular neuropsychological, audiologic, and ophthalmologic examinations are also recommended. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the disease-causing mutation in the family is known.

The office holder commanded the North Sea Fleet History The North Sea has traditionally been an important command from the 13th to 15th centuries there was an Admiral of the North based at Yarmouth that office ceased when it was unified with the new office of Admiral of England. During the 16th and 17th centuries Vice Admirals in the North Sea were appointed to the command of the North Sea Squadron though on an intermittent basis. From 1652-1654 Yarmouth used by the Royal Navy for stationing its fleets during the First Anglo-Dutch War. A more permanent appointment was then established in 1745 the Commander-in-Chief, North Sea he had overall responsibility for the North Sea Fleet usually anchored at Yarmouth Roads. The fleet is most well known for its key role in the Battle of Camperdown against the Dutch Navy on the 11 October 1797 which resulted in a decisive British victory. The fleet was also involved in trade protection with the advent of the looming Napoleonic Wars and later it turned to the blockading of enemy ports. The fleet also played an instrumental part in the British anti-invasion preparations of 1803–05 in response to Napoleon's planned invasion of the United Kingdom. It would be in May 1804 that the North Sea Fleet under the Commander-in-Chief, North Sea Admiral of the White: George Elphinstone, Viscount Keith would reach its largest composition. It consisted of some 170-179 ships (according to sources given) and divided primarily between squadrons each commanded by competent admirals. The office was abolished in 1815 and its former duties were taken over by the Commander-in- Chief, The Nore whose role and geographic area of command was re-defined by the Admiralty.

Early life May Gertrude Dermot was born in Rockland, Maine, James Fisher, Felicia Hardison Londré, The A to Z of American Theatre: Modernism (Scarecrow Press 2009): p. 151; a daughter of Thomas and Adelaide Hall Dermott. Her father was a sea captain born in Ireland, and her mother had been a schoolteacher. Her older sister Maxine left the household for New York City by age 16, and Gertrude soon followed. Both of them began using the surname \\"Elliott\\" as young women. Career Gertrude Elliott Forbes-Robertson as Cleopatra Elliott's career on stage began in 1894, with a role in Oscar Wilde's A Woman of No Importance, in a company that was touring New York state.Martin Banham, The Cambridge Guide to Theatre (Cambridge University Press 1995): 328. Both Elliotts joined a company in San Francisco that toured Australia in 1896. The company was run by Nat C. Goodwin, an actor who soon married Maxine Elliott. Their company went to London in 1899, and the next year Gertrude was hired into the company of Johnston Forbes-Robertson; Gertrude Elliott and Forbes-Robertson married at the end of 1900, and continued to work together for much of their careers. She was, literally, Ophelia to his Hamlet, Desdemona to his Othello, and Cleopatra to his Caesar.Clara M. Behringer, \\"Gertrude Elliott\\", in Edward T. James, Janet Wilson James, Paul S. Boyer, eds., Notable American Women 1607–1950: A Biographical Dictionary, Volume 3 (Harvard University Press 1971): 570-572. Away from the stage, Gertrude Elliott starred with her husband in a silent film version of Hamlet in 1913, directed by their friend J. H. Ryley. She also appeared in a 1917 silent film, Masks and Faces. Gertrude Elliott was a co- founder and president of the Actresses' Franchise League.Elizabeth Crawford, The Women's Suffrage Movement: A Reference Guide 1866-1928 (Routledge 2003): 4.

Personal life Gertrude Elliott married English actor Johnston Forbes- Robertson in 1900. They had four daughters, including aircraft designer Maxine (Blossom) Miles, writer Diana Forbes-Robertson, and actress Jean Forbes- Robertson. Johnston was knighted in 1913, making Gertrude \\"Lady Forbes- Robertson\\" from that time.Alan Dale, \\"An American Actress of Title\\" The Cosmopolitan (January 1914): 262-264.

Burgess spent her career at the Canadian Conservation Institute (\\"CCI\\"), where she was a Senior Conservation Scientist. She was a researcher in paper and textiles conservation processes and an expert in the areas of cellulose degradation analysis, conservation bleaching, washing, enzyme applications on paper, as well as aqueous and mass deacidification of paper. Career Helen Burgess obtained her Bachelor of Science (Chemistry) (Honours) from the University of Lethbridge in 1973. Burgess subsequently went to the University of British Columbia, where she graduated with a Masters of Science in bio-organic chemistry. She then went on to obtain a Masters of Conservation from Queen's University, specializing in conservation science. At Queen's, her Masters thesis dealt with the degradation of cellulose during conservation bleaching treatments. In 1978, Burgess joined CCI in its Conservation Processes Research department. Burgess ultimately became its Senior Conservation Scientist, a position she held until her retirement in 1998. Her primary focus was the conservation of paper artifacts, but she also handled other materials, such as textiles. For several decades, the primary guidance for conservation bleaching practices was dominated by guidelines Burgess helped develop. Burgess was the first conservation-restoration scientist to classify the chemical analysis of treated specimens, and to find an application for bleaching agents in paper conservation. Burgess published numerous articles in a variety of academic journals and industry publications. Burgess was also a frequent presenter at conservation, restoration, and scientific conferences. Burgess died a year after her retirement, in 1999. At the annual conference of the Western Association for Art Conservation following her death, several of the presentations were dedicated to her memory.

Both teams compete in the NHL's Eastern Conference Metropolitan Division. The two teams have been rivals since the Capitals inception in the 1974–75 season, but became most intense in the 1980s when the Capitals joined the Patrick Division. The rivalry was renewed in the late 2000s and 2010s with both teams being equally competitive resulting in two playoff matches in 2008 and 2016. 1980s Due to the proximity of each team (124 miles from Philadelphia to Washington via Interstate 95), the Flyers and Capitals are natural rivals. It was common for the Capital Centre, where the Capitals played, to be filled with many Flyers fans during the meetings. This led to an intense hatred for Capitals fans, and became even more intense when they joined the Flyers in the Patrick Division. After struggling for close to a decade, the Capitals finally made the playoffs in 1983, but did not meet the Flyers until the next season. The Capitals, then led by Mike Gartner and Rod Langway, got their first playoff series win in franchise history by defeating the Flyers in the 1984 Patrick Division semifinals 3–0 in a best-of-five. This stunning sweep also marked the end of two legendary Flyers careers, Bobby Clarke and Bill Barber. The two teams met again in the 1988 Patrick Division semifinals. This time, the Flyers took a 3–1 lead, only to have the Capitals come back and force a game 7. Both teams sent the game into overtime, and Capitals forward Dale Hunter won it for the Caps, making it one of the greatest playoff memories in team history. The Flyers got their revenge the following season in 1989, as the Flyers won the series 4–2. The series is perhaps best remembered for a historical feat committed by Flyers goaltender Ron Hextall. Hextall became the first NHL goaltender to score a goal in the Stanley Cup playoffs, by shooting the puck into the empty net. Hextall was also the first to do that feat in the regular season, having done it the year before. 1990s Perhaps the most notable moment of the rivalry in the 1990s was of a fight filled game at the Cap Centre. On February 10, 1991, the Flyers and Caps faced off in one of the most violent games between the two teams. The first period was fight filled, but the most notable moment happened in the third period with the Caps leading big. Capitals forward Dale Hunter laid a vicious elbow to the face of Flyers defenseman Gord Murphy, which sent Flyers head coach Paul Holmgren into a frenzy, as he banged a stick against the plexiglass that separates the team benches and got in a shouting match with Capital head coach Terry Murray and enforcer Alan May. The Flyers later responded with enforcer Craig Berube crushing Capitals goalie Don Beaupre behind the net. This led to another brawl and many fines for both teams. Each team was fined $5000 and Paul Holmgren was fine $1000 for his actions. Dale Hunter was suspended 4 games for his hit on Gord Murphy. Another notable moment was of another brawl, this time in The Spectrum. Flyers goalie Ron Hextall and Caps forward Rob Pearson got into a notable scrum in February 1995 but was the last notable moment between the two teams for many seasons. The rivalry grew dormant throughout the rest of the decade, as the two teams did not meet in the playoffs in the newly constructed Atlantic Division. With the 1998 realignment moving the Capitals into the Southeast Division, the rivalry grew even more dormant, especially as the Capitals struggled. 21st century =2000s= With the arrival of the Capitals new, young star Alexander Ovechkin, this led to a rebirth of the intensity between the two teams. After 19 seasons, the two teams finally met again in the 2008 Eastern Conference quarterfinals. Capitals star Alex Ovechkin made an impact early, as he scored the game-winning goal in Game 1. The Flyers won the next three games, with game 4 being won by Flyers forward Mike Knuble in double-overtime. In memories of the 1988 series, the Capitals forced a game 7 back in Washington, D.C. on April 22. This time, however, the Flyers won after Flyers forward Joffrey Lupul scored the game and series winning goal for Philadelphia. =2010s= The rivalry became its most intense since the 1980s, especially during the 2013–14 season. The Flyers were off to a miserable start to the season, and would face the Capitals on November 1, 2013. The Capitals crushed the Flyers 7–0 in Philadelphia, with Flyers fans chanting for GM Paul Holmgren to be fired. However, the most notable moment of the game was the line-brawl during the third period. Flyers forward Wayne Simmonds dished out a huge hit on Capitals defenseman Steven Oleksy, which led to Simmonds dropping the gloves with the Capitals Tom Wilson, leading to a brawl. Flyers goaltender Ray Emery joined in and fought Capitals goalie Braden Holtby, who was an unwitting combatant. Emery was given two minutes for instigating, two for leaving the crease, five for fighting, and a 10-minute misconduct. Despite the controversy surrounding the brawl, the Flyers cited the game as a rally cry, and made the playoffs, despite the slow start to the season. Later that season, on March 5, 2014, the two teams would engage in another fight filled game. This time in an eventual 6–4 Flyers win, the brawl started early as Flyers defenseman Luke Schenn checked Caps forward Ryan Stoa into the boards, which led to a fight between Schenn and Tom Wilson. At the same time, the Flyers Vincent Lecavalier and Capitals John Erskine fought, as did Wayne Simmonds and the Capitals Connor Carrick. The brawl, coincidentally, occurred on the 10-year anniversary of the famous Flyers brawl with the Ottawa Senators. After storming to make the playoffs, both teams faced off in the 2016 Eastern Conference quarterfinals. The Capitals were the Presidents' Trophy winners and were heavily favored. The Capitals took a 3–0 series lead, but the Flyers extended it to game 6, thanks to a brilliant 44-save performance by goaltender (and former Capital) Michal Neuvirth. The Flyers only have 11 shots during the game, the fewest in franchise history for a playoff game. The Capitals won game 6, however, to win the series 4–2.

It is affiliated with the Catholic Church and was built in 1623, making it one of the oldest parishes in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of São Salvador da Bahia. It was the first church built by the first governor-general of Brazil, Tomé de Sousa. The current structure was prefabricated in Portugal and assembled in Salvador; its construction began in 1739 and ended in the mid 19th century. The art historian Germain Bazin classifies the church as Portuguese in design, rather than part of the Bahian tradition of religious structures of the 17th and 18th century. Its monumental façade is a hybrid of Baroque and Neoclassical styles, and is based on church façades of the period in Portugal. The building was designed by Manuel Cardoso Saldanha; the master bricklayer and architect Eugénio da Mota prepared the stonework in Portugal and accompanied it to Salvador. Its elevation to the status of basilica took place in 1946. Pope Pius XII declared Our Lady of Conception the sole patron of the State of Bahia. Robert C. Smith described the structure as the \\"first and most complete expression in Brazil of the new Baroque style that succeeded Mannerism in Portugal in the early years of John V's reign.\\" History View of nave and chancel =Early history= The present church structure is the third to be built on the site. Tomé de Sousa (1503-1579), the first governor-general of the Portuguese colony of Brazil, established a primitive settlement and chapel in 1549 on the site of the current church in the initial period of construction of Salvador. Father Manuel da Nóbrega (1517-1570) and six Jesuit clergymen personally built a small mud-walled chapel at the base of the slope between the current upper and lower city. The chapel was dedicated to Our Lady of the Conception and housed an image of the saint brought by Tomé de Sousa from Portugal. The site sits close to the oceanfront and was a place of worship for sailors and tradesmen arriving in Brazil; they christened the church the Conception of the Beach (Conceição da Praia), a name that remained during subsequent reconstructions. =17th century= The growth of the population of the Cidade Baixa and area near the port of Salvador necessitated the construction of a larger church. Marcos Teixeira de Mendonça (1578-1624), a bishop and resistance leader against the Dutch attacks against Brazil, expanded the structure in 1623. It was renamed Matriz da Nova Freguesia de Nossa Senhora da Conceição da Praia and was financed by wealthy Portuguese merchants in the area. =18th century= The Santíssimo Sacramento da Imaculada Conceição, a fraternal order, decided to completely rebuild the church in 1736. The military engineer Manuel Cardoso de Saldanha planned the church and Manuel Vicente, a master stonemason, supervised its construction. The master bricklayer and architect Eugénio da Mota prepared the lioz stonework in Portugal and accompanied it to Salvador. The import of lioz stonework from Portugal for use as architectural elements in Brazil began in the 16th century; it additionally served as ballast for Portuguese ships travelling to Brazil. The art historian Germain Bazin classifies it as the only Portuguese church in Bahia, and outside of the progression of design of other religious structures in the region. Construction on the church began in 1739 but was delayed in 1758 by a financial downturn in Bahia. The woodcarver Lourenço Rodrigues Lançarote completed the elaborate side altars in 1765; he had earlier completed similar work in the Church of the Third Order of Mount Carmel. João Moreira de Espírito Santo completed the high altar between 1765 to 1773. The new structure, still unfinished, was dedicated on December 8 of the same year by the Archbishop of Bahia, Frei Manuel de Santa Inês Ferreira (1704-1771). Eugénio da Mota returned to Lisbon in 1769, \\"aged and nearly blind\\". =19th century= Four Portuguese masons succeeded Da Mota. The completion of the central section and left wing of the church in 1820 marked the end of major construction of the structure. By 1820 the fraternal order had spent 208,234,000 Portuguese réis on the church, making it one of the costliest in Bahia. The massive staircase in lioz and right wing of the structure were completed in 1850. The church of the Immaculate Conception received the title of minor basilica by the Apostolic Letter \\"Coruscantis sideris\\" of the 7 of October 1946, by decision of the Holy See. Location Lioz inlay, flooring of chancel. The Basilica of the Immaculate Conception faces directly northwest onto the Bay of All Saints. After numerous additions to the port facilities of the area it now sits at the south the cidade baixa, or lower city. Parts of the church, notably the chancel, are built directly into the cliff that marks the cidade baixa. Structure The Basilica of the Immaculate Conception has a monumental façade of lioz, with straight lines and rectangular details. The façade is neoclassical with two diagonal towers which \\"give a baroque touch to the design of the church box.\\" The church is noted for its use of natural light: it has a copula above the chancel and faces directly west to utilize light from the Bay of All Saints via numerous doors and windows. =Interior= The interior of the church is the first complete example of the Baroque style of John V of Portugal; it was partially altered in the Neoclassical style in the 19th century. The high altar is ornate, with monumental Solomonic columns, an altar in silver, and an image of Our Lady of the Conception at center. The master carver João Moreira do Espírito Santo completed the carving of the high altar in cedar between 1765 and 1773. Domingos Luiz Soares, among others, is responsible for the gilding of the high altar. The Italiante Solomonic columns, which feature flower garland and acanthus details, resemble those of the baldachin of St. Peter's Basilica. A copula and two massive oculi in the chancel ceiling provides natural light to the chancel and high altar. The ceiling of the nave in the Baroque illusionist style and executed by José Joaquim da Rocha (c. 1737-1807). =Side chapels= The church has eight side chapels: three along each side of the nave and one at either side of the high altar. The chapel at the right of the higher altar is dedicated to the Holy Christ (Capela do Santo Cristo). At the left of the nave, from left to right: *Chapel of Saint Joseph (Capela de São José) *Chapel of Our Lady of Sorrows (Capela de Nossa Senhora das Dôres) *Chapel of Saint John the Baptist (Capela de São João Batista), with an image of Our Lady of Fátima below At the right of the nave, from left to right: *Chapel of Our Lady of the Rosary (Capela Nossa Senhora do Rosário), with an image of Saint Pantaleon below *Chapel of Saint Anthony (Capela de Santo Antônio), with an image of Saint Joseph below *Chapel of Saint Benedict (Capela de Sao Benedito) =Patio= The church has an interior patio with a fountain and staircase leading to the meeting room of the Brotherhood. The patio and its elements are entirely constructed of lioz. Protected status The Basilica of the Immaculate Conception was listed as a historic structure by the National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage in 1938.

The themes of her work are informed by both \\"her Caribbean heritage and her continuous movements between continents and islands.\\" Soto's drawings, installations and sculptures embody the struggle between connections and disconnections. Supporting the belief that all things, seen and unseen are essentially linked. There is a conversation that includes a personal and a universal situation, an interplay between the micro and the macro. Questioning the endless conflicts, the creation of artificial differences, and the establishment of borders. While exploring the essence of the forces at work in the macrocosm. Shaping what those energies, frequencies, and vibrations might look like.  Early life and education  Soto was born in Los Angeles, California and grew up in New York City and a small, traditional village in the South of Spain, across the waters from Morocco. She received her art education at the Amsterdams Instituut voor Schilderkunst, in the Netherlands. Her Caribbean heritage (Puerto Rican) and continuous movement to different continents and countries have impacted her art by giving her a wide range of perspectives and experiences.  Work and Reception  Soto's work draws largely on industrial materials such as wire, bullet shells, Mylar, hardware, wire mesh, and mirrors. For example, Soto's \\"NGC1003 & NGC1913\\" consists of a pair of suspended planes made from crocheted squares of wire while her \\"The Gravity of Our Locus\\" is produced from subwoofers, copper wire, bullet shells and caps, and copper bowls. She transforms these materials into works suggestive of cartographic lines, neurons, swarms, nests, and webs. Of her work \\"Relational Realities,\\" Jeannette Ehlers writes that these networks are so complex \\"so complex that it is almost impossible to trace the different lines across the grid.\\" Soto states that her works relate \\"to systems of communications and universal principles in order to question society's conflicts and violence, while highlighting its harmonious network.\\" Reviewing the exhibition, \\"Soul Recordings,\\" Luis de Jesus compares Soto's works to her fellow artists. De Jesus claims that Soto presents \\"subtle, nuanced objects and images, while remaining just as strongly tethered to a set of meanings and contexts no less fraught with hard truths.\\" Genie Davis has written that Soto's sculpture, \\"The Gravity of our Locus,\\" which was presented at Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions. \\"is a stunning fountain of violence that is as lovely as a waterfall and as devastating as the deaths and injury the bullet shells and caps represent. The copper is burnished, shimmers almost like water; the bowls are shaped like artful lily pads, the symmetry is perfect. But above all else, this large-scale sculptural sound installation echoes with loss.\\" In his review of \\"Hard Edged,\\" an exhibition at the California African American Museum, Christopher Knight offers a description of Soto's work \\"NGC1003 & NGC1913.\\" The work consists of a pair of suspended planes made from crocheted squares of wire, which are attached to a small motor hidden near the ceiling. Knight writes that \\"The motor makes the layered, floating quilts slightly jostle and shimmy, their animation evoking a living spirit — the spirit of historical family legacies that quilts so often embody.\\"  Exhibitions  Soto has participated in solo and group exhibitions in the Dominican Republic, Spain, Miami, New York, New Orleans, Berlin and Los Angeles.

Not all area parents agreed with the proposal; 208 parents had signed a survey stating opposition. In 2005 HISD announced that Wilson was scheduled to be converted into a PreK-8 school using a Montessori program for all students. Friends of Montessori agreed to assist the effort and signed a two-year agreement to assist the conversion of Wilson; it was scheduled to raise $6,000 to buy the materials used for the Montessori program. All teachers were to be Montessori-certified, and existing teachers staying at Wilson were to undergo training to deliver the curriculum. Parents acquired an additional $345,000 in the period 2003-2008 to convert Wilson into a Montessori campus. The 7th and 8th grades were to be established at Wilson by late 2009. In 2008 there were 440 students. That year Jennifer Radcliffe of the Houston Chronicle wrote that \\"Parents rave about Wilson\\". After the Montessori program was established, enrollment at Wilson increased; in the 2013-2014 school year, the school had 501 students, including 90 middle school students. The expected enrollment for the 2014-2015 school year was 530. In 2016 groundbreaking occurred for an expansion of the campus. The original building is to be renovated, and a three-story structure designed by Smith & Co. Architects will be added on. The total cost will be $18.9 million, and the campus will have a total area of almost of space.

Wilson Montessori functions as a magnet school, and children from outside the Wilson boundary who apply to Wilson are selected on the basis of a lottery. Student body In 2008 the school had 440 students, including almost 90 learning English as a second language. Curriculum All students at Wilson are taught in the Montessori educational style. The school day is divided into three-hour blocks, and students are expected to perform tasks on their own within those three hour blocks. Assignments involve students working in pairs and using flashcards, blocks, beads, and other objects. The school provides Spanish-language Montessori materials, in addition to English- language ones, for students with English as a second language. Each class had a mixture of different ages, and as a result each teacher is required to study, for a period of one year, how to customize a lesson plan for different students. In order to increase relations between the teachers, students and parents, each student stays in the same class for a three-year period. Students are required to take state achievement tests.

Belonging to the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin, in the archdiocese of Olinda and Recife, its patron is the Virgin of the Rock. History The origin of the location of the Basílica da Penha dates back to a small oratory located \\"Outside the Gate of Santo Antônio\\", corresponding, with a slight difference, to the plot of land where today the contemporary building is erected. The oratory was instituted in 1655 by the French Capuchin Franciscans and expanded on April 16 of the same year, in a plot donated by Belchior Alves Camello and his wife Joanna Bezerra. However, the present temple was constructed between the years of 1870 and 1882, being the only church in Corinthian style of the Pernambuco State. It is inspired by the architecture of the San Giorgio Maggiore church of Venice. In 1870, the Capuchins of Veneto (Italy) demolished the old Church of Penha and erected the imposing and current Basilica da Penha, concluding the work in 1882. On September 2, 2007, a restoration work began that lasted until July 4, 2014, the date of its re-inauguration. The works cost about R$ 6 million and have not yet finished. The work of the restorers revealed several features that had been lost by the passage of time. The original color of the gilded saint above the external dome has been restored and a vitrified panel of mosaic made in Italy has been found. The church is known for the traditional event of the Blessing of Felix of Cantalice which took place close to the Basilica while the restoration lasted. Unlike the Baroque style used in most of Recife's churches, the Basilica da Penha is of Renaissance Revival architecture and an architectural work of vast artistic merit both inside and outside. Unfortunately, most of the works do not have documentation indicating authorship, leaving a gap in the historical survey of the building. Among the few pieces of well-known authorship we find, in the altarpiece, the figures of St. Francis of Assisi and St. Anthony carved in marble in relief by Italian Valentino Panciera Besarel (1829-1902) and low relief on the high altar. But there are indications that various other works come from the same sculptor. There are also on the high altar frescoes by Brazilian Murillo La Greca (1899-1985).

He made his first- class cricket debut in May 1919 for Lionel Robinson's XI against the Australian Imperial Force Touring XI at Old Buckenham Hall in Norfolk, scoring 30 not out and 87 not out in the match. Seven Kent players were on the same team, including Lionel Troughton the Kent captain, and Hough was invited to play for the county side the following month, qualifying through his regimental connections with the RWK. Troughton had also served in the RWK and had captained the regimental team in the war time match in which Hough had played in 1916. Considered mainly as an \\"aggressive batsman\\", Hough took his only wicket in first-class cricket with the first ball he bowled on his Kent debut against Essex at Leyton - one of only three Kent players to take a wicket with his first ball in first-class cricket.'Bowling Records' in Kent County Cricket Club Annual 2017 p.205. Canterbury: Kent County Cricket Club. His war wounds restricted his bowling action and he only bowled seven overs of off-spin in his first-class career. He played twice for Kent's Second XI in the Minor Counties Championship - once in 1920 and once in 1934 - and played in other matches for MCC. Later life After working as a teacher at Bradfield College for ten years, Hough took over the position of Manager at Kent in 1933 following the death of Lionel Troughton. From 1935 he combined this with the role of Secretary, working in these capacities for the club until 1949 when he was forced to retire due to ill-health. In his final years working at the club he was largely responsible for the installation of new wrought iron gates at the entrance to the St Lawrence Ground in Canterbury as a memorial to the club players who died during World War II.

It is the eastern terminus of the Dammam–Riyadh Line and one of the three railway stations with active passenger transport in the Eastern Province. The station also serves as the station of operations for the Saudi Railways Organization (SRO), the older of the kingdom's two railway operators, the other being the Saudi Railway Company (SAR).  History  The current station building was designed by Italian architect Lucio Barbera in 1978, and was opened to the public in 1981. The design was inspired by the architecture of mosques along the Mediterranean Sea. The building constitutes the main lobby and the east and west wings, which enclose the two railway platforms. The roof is made from prefabricated, pre-stressed beams and he exterior is clad in limestone which was sourced locally. The style and decoration of the building uses elements such as triangular openings to construct windows and arcades and parapets with rectangular steps, elements bearing a resemblance to Nejdi architecture but also common in other Arab and Islamic architecture. The station includes a main concourse, ticket counter, and the two platforms. The stations in Dammam, Hofuf and Riyadh were all designed by Barbera and share similar design.  Services  The first railway line built under the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia began construction between Dammam and Riyadh in 1947. The line was inaugurated on October 20, 1951 and was 569 km (354 mi) long. Initially owned and operated by Saudi Aramco, the ownership and operations were later entrusted to the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Finance. On May 13, 1966, the Saudi Railways Organization (SRO) came into existence after the issuance of a royal decree which declared it a public corporation with full legal status. The main railway station buildings with active passenger service opened in Riyadh, Dammam, and Hofuf in 1981. The present passenger railway line (Dammam-Riyadh Railway Line 1) from Riyadh to Dammam via Buqayq and Hofuf, measuring 449 km (279 mi), was completed in 1985. Along with the decrease in distance, this shortened the time taken for the journey between the two cities from 7 hours to 5 hours. SRO trains on this route travel at around 180 kmh (113 mph). The line was used by approximately 1.48 million passengers during 2017 between stations in Dammam, Abqaiq, Hofuf, and Riyadh. This other line (Dammam-Riyadh Railway Line 2) is restricted to transport of freight and cargo. For the first 139 km (86 mi) of its length, it uses the same line as the passenger line, but where the passenger line bends westward toward Riyadh at Hofuf, the freight line continues straight toward Haradh and then bends northward toward Riyadh via Kharj. = Planned future services = The Saudi Landbridge Project is a proposed plan to extend the existing Dammam–Riyadh line to Jeddah via New Muwayh. Dammam will serve as a major junction on the proposed Gulf Railway line as the station is the proposed junction between the main line from Kuwait to the United Arab Emirates and a feeder line from Dammam to Bahrain.

It is housed in two linked buildings, the city's historic Alcázar (castle) and a purpose-built extension. The museum contains many miniature replicas of battles. The history of the museum began in 1803 when the royal military museum was established in a building in Madrid known as the Palacio de Monteleón. The building also served as a barracks for artillery units and it was attacked and looted by the French when they suppressed the Dos de Mayo Uprising of 1808. The museum was reestablished, but in 1827 it was divided into two sections: the Museo de Artillería and the Museo de Ingenieros. Later the collections were unified and housed in the Hall of Realms. In the twenty-first century the collections were moved from Madrid to Toledo. The new premises offered much more space, although the site was not without controversy because of its associations with the Siege of the Alcázar, an episode in the Spanish Civil War. The new museum was opened in 2010 by Felipe, Prince of Asturias. The Alcázar The Alcázar is used for the Permanent Exhibition. Some rooms are devoted to chronological displays reflecting the history of Spain twinned with that of its Army, other rooms show the collections thematically. The new plant The new building The new building houses the administrative offices, the Temporary Exhibitions room, the Army room in the present time, the didactic classroom, the auditorium, the archive, the library, the coffee shop, the restoration workshops and the warehouses, all of them endowed with the greatest technical advances for the conservation, restoration, cataloging, investigation and diffusion of the funds that are guarded. Archaeology Some items are archaeological. The displays include finds from excavations at the Alcázar which were undertaken prior to construction of the museum extension. Display cases and individual items Some of the display cases belonging to the museum are of interest in their own right with decorative details reflecting their contents. The displays on the 20th century include a 1930s Enigma machine in its original box. The Spanish have preserved a number of Enigma machines which were obtained from Nazi Germany.

Zoltak has been featured on CBC in a special done by the channel.  Early life  When Nazi Germany invaded Poland in the invasion that launched the Second World War, Zoltak's hometown of Siemiatycze was occupied by German troops. However under the terms of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, the Soviet-German non aggression agreement, much of Poland was divided into the Soviet sphere of influence. Then a surprise invasion by Germany on June 22, 1941 saw the Germans once again occupy Siemiatycze. The town's Jews were rounded up, forced to live in a ghetto, and by November, those left alive were shipped to Treblinka.  Film: Reunions  The documentary, produced in co-operation with The March of the Living Digital Archive Project, is about Zoltak's return to Poland to meet the people that saved his life. The film was screened at the Hamilton Jewish Film Festival, the Vancouver Jewish Film Festival, and the Big Sky Documentary Film Festival. His memoir, My Silent Pledge: A Journey of Struggle, Survival and Remembrance, was published by Guernica Editions, in 2013. In his book Witness: Passing the Torch of Holocaust Memory to New Generations author Eli Rubenstein recounts a scene from the film, told in the presence of the son of his rescuer and hundreds of March of the Living student and recorded at Treblinka, where nearly one million Jews were murdered. \\"When we got back to our hometown, less than one percent had survived.

Mississippi has a literary tradition that arise from a diverse mix of cultures and races. Traditional themes from this genre of literature lean towards the past, conflict and change, and southern history in general; however, in the modern era, work have shifted towards deeply Southern works that do not rely on these traditional themes. Some prominent writers from Mississippi's past include William Faulkner, Richard Wright, Tennessee Williams, and Eudora Welty, while modern writers include John Grisham, Natasha Trethewey, Jesmyn Ward, and Michael Farris Smith. History =Early history (1800s–1920s)= Beginning from statehood in 1817, Mississippi played a very small role in United States literature. Weber (1898) mentioned that at the time of his writing, Mississippi had \\"few grounds for boasting. The list of Mississippi books is not long; the average quality is nothing. Of pure literature, of the real literature of power, we have contributed scarcely 50 pages to the world's store.\\" Mississippi's general trend of apathy towards serious literature continued into the 1920s, with Elsie Dersham (1921) reiterating Weber's statements in \\"An Outline of American State Literature\\" and discussing lost opportunities to add to Mississippi's literary repertoire. The author writes: > Mississippi has contributed much more to politics than to literature. With > the single exception of the poems of Irvin Russel, Mississippi has produced > nothing which literary men have been willing to give a place in American > literature. She has many interesting Indian legends and negro folk tales, > and accounts of the doings of Mississippian laws that should be collected > and made a part of her literature. Williams Ward is one of Mississippi's > best poets and is the author of the well known poem \\"Katie Did.\\" =Literary beginnings (1930s–1940s)= William Faulkner and Eudora Welty both published many of their most significant works during the 1930s and 1940s, drawing international attention to Mississippi. Faulkner published The Sound and The Fury (1929), As I Lay Dying (1930_, Light in August (1932), and Absalom, Absalom! (1936). In 1949, Faulkner was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. Welty published her short story collections A Curtain Green (1941), Music from Spain (1948), and The Golden Apples (1949) in the forties, as well as her first novel Delta Wedding in 1946. Margaret Walker published her first poetry collection For My People in 1942 before moving to Mississippi. =Civil rights era (1950s–1970s)= The University Press of Mississippi began operating in 1970. With the support of the state's eight public universities and the Mississippi Institutes of Higher Learning, the press publishes around 85 books a year on topics concerning the culture of the South, expert books, and writings related to specialized topics, such as African American, Caribbean, and pop culture studies. =Modern era (1980s-present)= In the modern era, writers have shifted towards deeply Southern works that do not necessarily rely on traditional themes related to the Lost Cause and racial conflict. The change in race relations over the years contributed to the expansion of topics from race to broader areas such as the working class and underdogs. Beginning in 2005 and relaunching in 2016, The Cirlot Agency, located in Jackson, ran advertisements promoting the state's literary history as part of the Mississippi, Believe It! campaign. The campaign cited William Faulkner, Tennessee Williams, Richard Wright, and John Grisham as a few examples of Mississippi's literary heritage. In 2018, the Mississippi Arts Commission and Mississippi Humanities Council announced intentions for the Mississippi Writers Trail, modeled off of the Mississippi Blues Trail and Freedom Trail. The markers, shaped like open books, will be placed in strategic locations related to the author. The first two markers were unveiled at the 2018 Mississippi Book Festival; they are for Eudora Welty and Jesmyn Ward, which represents both past and present contributions of Mississippi authors. Receipt and placement of trail markers will be determined by scholar recommendations.

Incident  In a closed Facebook group called \\"Marines United,\\" which consisted of 30,000 active duty and retired members of the United States Armed Forces and British Royal Marines, hundreds of photos of female servicemembers from every branch of the military were distributed.

In addition to the three murals, Rohland has works in the permanent collections of the Library of Congress, The Honolulu Academy of Art, the New Mexico Museum of Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art. Early life Caroline Melvina Speare was born on April 15, 1885 in Chelsea, Suffolk County, Massachusetts to Edith (née Holway) and Lewis R. Speare. [U.S.Federal Census 1910] She studied at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and then at the Art Students League of New York under the instruction of John Sloan and Kenneth Hayes Miller. Then she studied with Andrew Dasburg, before making her way to the artists' community of Woodstock, New York. In 1919 she married fellow art student Paul Rohland.[New York State Marriage Index 1881-1967,Ancestry.com] The couple lived in a nearby community of artists known as \\"The Maverick\\", founded by Hervey White. Career From 1927, Rohland exhibited at the Whitney Studio Club, the precursor to the museum. In that year, she was part of a three-woman show which included Gertrude Tiemer and Georgina Klitgaard and which ran for nearly three weeks. In 1929, she and her husband both participated in a circus-themed exhibition in New York City, timed to correspond with a Barnum and Bailey show and the following year, she Rosella Hartman and the Croatian sculptor, Dujam Penić were featured at the Whitney Gallery. From the opening of the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1931, Rohland was a fixture, appearing in biennial shows until 1942. She was most known for her pastels, which had both contemporary style and sensual surfaces, often dealing with southern themes. In the 1930s, Rohland was hired as one of the Works Progress Administration (WPA) artists. She painted idealized southern scenes, such as the 1939 portrayal of Cotton Pickers installed in the post office of Bunkie, Louisiana. In 1941, she painted Spring for the post office in Sylvania, Georgia. The scene was of a farm family and a field hand carrying out daily labors on the farm. Though many locals, black and whites alike appreciated the painting, in the 1980s, the local NAACP chapter had the painting removed as being insensitive in its depiction of the African-American farm hand. In 1995, the canvas was found wadded up in a closet of the post office and was restored. It is now in the permanent collection of Georgia Southern University on loan from the federal government. In 1942, Rohland won the commission to paint the post office mural for Fulton, New York. Father LeMoyne Trying to Convert the Indians on Pathfinder Island was an oil on canvas depicting another typical WPA theme, Native Americans interacting with Europeans. The post office was placed on the National Register of Historic Places for Oswego County, New York in 1989. When the WPA project ended around 1943, the Rohlands moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico. She continued to have success and was selected in 1943 for an exhibit at the Museum of Fine Arts with her traditional southern themes. In 1944, her water color Modern Death was chosen to be in the 55th annual exhibit at the Chicago Art Institute, her pastel Oh, What a Beautiful Morning was chosen for the Santa Fe Art Museum and she had several paintings in the permanent collection of the Whitney. A collection of a variety of her works, including oils, pastels and water colors were featured at the Santa Fe Fine Arts Museum in 1945. Both she and her husband participated in the 1945 Fiesta Art Exhibit of Santa Fe and that same year her works were included in a showing at the Johnson-Humrickhouse Museum, which had selected them from a 1943 Library of Congress Exhibit. Rohland's husband died in 1949, and the following year, she returned to the Woodstock artists colony. By the late 1950s, she had expanded into photography and participated in a showing at the Woodstock Gallery in 1959, featuring photographic works. Death and legacy Rohland died June 12, 1964 at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City after a lengthy illness. Rohland has works in the permanent collections of the Library of Congress in Washington, D. C., the Honolulu Academy of Art, the New Mexico Museum of Art in Santa Fe and the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City.

One of these noun phrases has the syntactic function of subject while the others function as complements (direct, indirect, prepositional or verbal), or adverbials (of time, place, manner, etc.). The sentence can be introduced by a 'frame' (for example 'as far as X is concerned', or an adverbial of time or place). The main features of the sentence are the agreement in person and number between the subject and the verb - which marks the relation between the speaker, on the one hand, and his or her interlocutors and any other people, on the other - and time, which situates the action in relation to the present of the speaker or in relation to the time of the other sentences of the text or discourse. In attributive sentences (see below), as well as agreement in person and number between the subject and the verb, there is also agreement of gender and number between the subject and the head of the attribute when it is a noun or an adjective. In Catalan there are four main types of sentence: # Predicative sentences, consisting of a subject, a verb and some complements. En Jordi va collir tres roses per a la Núria (Jordi picked three roses for Núria). La colla camina per la carretera amb pas decidit (The group walked purposefully along the road). # Attributive sentences, which express a characteristic of the subject, the attribute, which is linked to it by a copulative or quasi-copulative verb. La plaça era plena a vessar (The square was full to bursting). La camisa estava bruta (The shirt was dirty). El cel semblava de plom (The sky looked leaden). # Impersonal sentences, which do not have a subject. Plou. Neva. Fa sol. Està núvol. (It's raining. It's snowing. It's sunny. It's cloudy.) # Unaccusative sentences, which have the verb in initial position followed by a noun phrase which has the dual function of subject and direct object, and which is the new information provided by the sentence. Avui s'han publicat tres notícies sobre terratrèmols (Today three news items have been published on earthquakes). Hi ha mosques al celler (There are flies in the cellar). Per aquí hi passen molts cotxes (A lot of cars come past here). Li convenen unes bones vacances (He needs a good holiday). The neutral order of sentences is shown by the examples for each of the above types: subject, verb (and complements) for type 1; subject, verb and attribute for type 2; no subject for type 3 and verb followed by a noun phrase for type 4. In general, however, Catalan is an SVO language. Sentences can be simple or compound, depending on whether they contain just one verb or more than one. In the sentences with more than one verb, they can be on an equal footing (juxtaposition or coordination), or there may be one main verb and other subordinate ones. Within the main clause, subordinate clauses can be the subject and object (direct or prepositional), which in simple sentences are usually expressed by noun phrases. Subordinate clauses can also contain other subordinate clauses. One feature of Catalan syntax is the role played by the so-called weak pronouns, which can change the order of the sentence by removing one of the elements for pragmatic reasons, but keeping the sentence structured around the verb. This sort of construction, known as topicalization, is used in dialogues, to take up what has been said by the interlocutors, and monologues, and it can make a text coherent thanks to the technique of thema and rheme or thematic progression. For example, one response to the question \\"On has posat les roses?\\" (Where have you put the roses?\\") could be \\"Les he posades al gerro de l'entrada\\" (I've put them in the vase in the hallway), in which the theme of the question is picked up in the pronoun les, or \\"Les roses les he posades al gerro de l'entrada\\" (The roses, I've put in the vase in the hallway), in which \\"les roses\\" is in theme position and the sentence is still structured around the verb with the pronoun les. More than one complement can be put in theme position: No les hi posis, les roses, al gerro de l'entrada, que està esquerdat!\\" (\\"Don't put the roses in the vase in the hall because it's cracked!\\"), in which les represents \\"les roses\\" and hi, \\"the vase in the hall\\".

It tells the story of a young woman who adopts male dress and becomes a sailor (or sometimes a soldier) in order to search for her lover. Other names include Billy Taylor, Brisk Young Seamen, Bold William Taylor, Down By the Seashore, The False Lover, The Female Lieutenant; Or, Faithless Lover Rewarded, If You'll Get Up Early in the Morning, The Life and Death of Billy Taylor, My Love, Poor William Taylor, Sally Brown and William Taylor, and Young Billy Taylor.Roud Folk Song Index, Vaughan Williams Memorial Library https://www.vwml.org/roudnumber/158 Retrieved 2017/03/09 Music One tune is as follows: relative c { clef treble key d major time 2/2 g4 fis4 g8 g8 a8 b8 c8 c8 a4 fis4 d4 g4 fis4 g4 a8 a8 b4 d' a2 } addlyrics { Will- iam Tay- lor was a brisk young sai- lor, He who court- ed a la- dy fair; } Story =Synopsis= Several versions exist, but the story of the song concerns a young couple due to be wed. On the morning of the wedding, the groom William Taylor (Billy in some versions) is pressed into service. The bride searches for him, disguising herself as a man to become a soldier or sailor. When her true gender is revealed (usually in an incident involving accidental exposure of her breasts), the captain points her in the direction of her beloved, but mentions that he now has a new suitor. When she finds him, she shoots him and sometimes also his new bride. In some versions, she is then rewarded by the captain with command of her own ship. =Details= Many versions follow a line similar to this. William Taylor, a \\"brisk young sailor\\" is at church about to be married when he is taken by the press gang: > William Taylor was a brisk young sailor > He who courted a lady fair > Bells were ringing, sailors singing > As to church they did repair. > > Now forty couple were at the wedding, > All were dressed in rich array. > Instead of William getting married > He was pressed and sent away. > (or sometimes he merely enlists in the army, or joins a ship, with no wedding arrangements). His bride-to-be, sometimes called Sarah Dunn or Sally Grey, but often nameless, dresses in sailor's (or soldier's) clothing and goes to look for him. In some versions her true gender is revealed in battle or in some other way: > One day as she were exercising, > Exercising one, two, three, > A silver chain hung down her waistcoat > And exposed her lily-white breast. > in others her ship arrives at a foreign port where she resumes her true gender. Her captain asks why she has come, she tells him she is looking for William Taylor: > “If his name be William Taylor, > William Taylor is not here; > He's lately married a rich young lady, > Worth ten thousand pound a year.” > > “If you rise early in the morning, > Just before the break of day, > Why there you'll find bold William Taylor, > A-walking out with his lady fair.” > She gets up before the dawn, sees William and his wife as predicted, calls for a pistol or pistols and sometimes a sword, and shoots him \\"with his fair lady by his side\\". > She's called for a brace of pistols, > That were brought at her command;, > Fired and shot her false Willie, > And the bride at his right hand. > The captain is so impressed he marries her, or makes her the commander of a ship or two. > And then the captain stepped up to her, > Was well pleased at what she'd done. > He took her and made her a bold commander > Over a ship and all his men. > History William Taylor was often performed as a comic song, Billy Taylor, in the 19th century, but seems to have originated as a serious ballad. Traditional singers seem to sing it straight. =Early Printed Examples= The earliest known version, as Billy Taylor, is in a chapbook, Four New Songs, printed in 1792.

They are flexible shims designed to fix two cylindrical parts together. The wavelike protrusions that run around the circumference of the ring generate a retention force to provide an optimal fit between the two mating components without the need for adhesive or excessive assembly force, simplifying the process for manufacturers. They allow for any misalignment caused by thermal expansion or excessive vibration. Tolerance rings can be used as bearing mounts and as a means of dealing with torque transfer, torque overload protection and axial slip between mating components. They are often used to isolate undesirable vibration in engines and electric motors, for noise-free mechanism operation in passenger vehicles and domestic appliances, where noise reduction has become a major trend in recent years. Modifications to tolerance rings can be made to tune the dynamic stiffness and, therefore, the frequencies that can be isolated. Tolerance rings can be used to eliminate noise completely, simply by taking up clearance between mating components, which could otherwise lead to rattling in the system as the parts are not completely constrained.  Applications and uses  = Automotive = Tolerance rings are used in a number of mechanisms throughout the automotive powertrain and steering systems, as well as the car interior and exterior. Their torque limiting and overload capabilities allow them to be used as simple clutch devices in several applications, such as the automatic tailgate motor and the collapsible steering column. They are also used by automotive manufacturers to mount bearings in hinges and gears in the power train. Their lightweight properties have also made tolerance rings attractive to automotive manufacturers as they seek to enhance car performance while complying with government requirements for reductions in carbon emissions. In the European Union, regulations on car emissions have been introduced by the European Commission, restricting the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions that a car can emit. Since 2015, EU law requires that new cars do not emit more than 130 grams per kilometer of carbon dioxide (CO2). If that limit is breached then manufacturers can face fines. From 2021 the new mandatory emission target will be a fleet average of 95 grams per kilometer. China is beginning to introduce legislation to create a National Standard, based on carbon emission reduction regulations already in effect in Europe. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires automotive companies to average carbon dioxide (CO2) tailpipe emissions at 101 grams per kilometer (163 grams/mile) by model year 2025. These regulations require car manufacturers to reduce the weight of their engines and vehicles to enhance fuel efficiency. According to the EPA estimations, every 10 per cent drop in car mass decreases fuel use between 5 and 10 per cent.  EPS Motor Stator Mount  In most modern Electric Power Steering (EPS) systems, the motor housing is a part of the rack casting which is usually made from lightweight materials, such as aluminum alloys. The stators are traditionally press fitted into the housing. Tolerance rings can be used instead of press fitting. With their wavelike protrusions, tolerance rings generate a retention force when compressed between the housing and the stator. These protrusions act as springs and allow the mating components to expand and contract at different rates while still providing the required retention force. Tolerance rings also make sure that there is a constant thermal bridge between the stator and the housing, allowing heat to be dissipated away from the stator. Cooler operating temperatures result in higher efficiency and an extended life of the motor.  Gear Mounts  Tolerance rings are used as an electric motor stator mount in electric power steering (EPS) to protect the system from torque overload in the event of back-driven shocks through the steering system. They do this by allowing the drive shaft to slip inside the gear so the gear teeth are not damaged, which strengthens the longevity of the EPS system.  Collapsible Steering Column  The collapsible steering column has been designed to protect the driver from injuries caused by striking the steering system in a crash. Consisting of two interlocking shafts, the collapsible steering column absorbs energy by collapsing inwards or breaking upon impact. To secure the shaft and housing of the steering column in place during normal driving conditions, a tolerance ring is fitted between the two parts. The tolerance ring is designed to axially slip at a predetermined torque level, enabling the shaft to slide inside its housing in a crash, absorbing impact energy to protect the driver.  Anti-Theft Devices  According to the European Union Commission Directive 95/56/EC (1995), all vehicles are mandated to be fitted with anti-theft security devices. The regulation requires that a steering lock must be able to withstand forces of 100Nm applied to the steering wheel without failing. It also requires that cars exported to European markets be fitted with security devices. The Chinese directive GB15740-2006 obliges Chinese car producers to incorporate anti-theft mechanisms in their vehicles. In a steering lock, a tolerance ring's wavelike protrusions maintain a retention force between the steering shaft and lock column. This allows the inner shaft to move freely within the housing when the steering lock is applied, while securing the two parts in place during normal car operation.  Tailgate Motor  This is an electric motor to automate the opening and closing of the car trunk door. When the trunk door lowers, if a sensor detects an obstruction such as a bag or hand, it will signal the motor to stop. The tolerance ring protects the motor and gearing from excessive force, acting as a clutch. If the trunk is subjected to a force opposite to the motion (i.e. when someone is manually opening the trunk when it is automatically closing), the tolerance ring will allow the components to slip against each other, at certain torque levels. This protects the other components in the trunk mechanism.  Car Seat Armrest  To ensure the armrest stays in place when it is stowed away by the passenger and does not fall down when the car travels over rough terrain, a tolerance ring is used at the pivot. Its wavelike protrusions generate sufficient torque to hold it in place and to allow for the correct adjustment feel. = Climate Control = Tolerance rings are used in a number of mechanisms in domestic and industrial air conditioning (AC) systems. AC manufacturers use them as stator and bearing mounts.  Air Conditioner Stator  This is the stationary part of the motor. The tolerance ring is used to secure the stator within the frame. It acts as a cushion when the AC motor is in operation to absorb vibration for noise-free AC performance.  Air Conditioner Frame  Tolerance rings are also used in the top frame structure of AC systems to secure the top of the rotor, replacing spot welding. They absorb vibration from the rotor and crankshaft in the AC motor when the compressor is running at high speed, ensuring the AC pump operates as efficiently as possible over its life cycle and reducing noise. = Hard Disk Drive = Tolerance rings are used in hard disk drives (HDD) to mount disks or bearing cartridges into the drives. The waves on their outer surface allow them to absorb excess vibration to reduce torque ripple effect and resonance to improve the HDD’s performance. The tolerance rings also ensure fast and easy assembly by eliminating the need for adhesive.

It is approximately long and flows through Upper Saucon and Salisbury townships in Lehigh County and Lower Saucon Township and Bethlehem in Northampton County. The watershed of the river has an area of . It is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery and contains wild trout. The river is a very small limestone stream and flows in the vicinity of Lehigh University's Saucon Fields. Course The Black River begins on a hill in Upper Saucon Township, Lehigh County. It flows north-northeast for a few tenths of a mile, then continues north-northeast for several tenths of a mile as the border between Salisbury Township and Lower Saucon Township. It passes through an unnamed pond and then turns east for several tenths of a mile, entering Lower Saucon Township, Northampton County. It then heads in a southeasterly direction for over a mile, crossing Interstate 78. Eventually, it gradually turns northeast, passing through another pond before heading in an easterly direction and entering the city of Bethlehem. Some distance later, the river turns east-northeast for a few tenths of a mile before turning north for a few tenths of a mile and reaching its confluence with Saucon Creek. Black River joins Saucon Creek upstream of its mouth. Hydrology Black River is not designated as an impaired waterbody. At its mouth, the peak annual discharge has a 10 percent chance of reaching . It has a 2 percent chance of reaching and a 1 percent chance of reaching . The peak annual discharge has a 0.2 percent chance of reaching . In April 1959, measurements of Black River near a private road from Wydnor found the creek's discharge to be . Geography and geology The elevation near the mouth of the Black River is above sea level. The elevation near the river's source is above sea level. The confluence of the Black River with Saucon Creek is approximately north of the confluence of Silver Creek with Saucon Creek. The Black River is described as a \\"miserable ditch\\" in Trout Unlimited's Guide to Pennsylvania Limestone Streams. It is a very small stream with only a trickle of stormwater runoff flowing through it. However, it is a limestone stream. Watershed The watershed of Black River has an area of . The mouth of the river is in the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Hellertown. However, its source is in the quadrangle of Allentown East. The mouth of the river is at Hellertown. Most of the watershed of Black River is in Lower Saucon Township, Northampton County. However, smaller areas occupy parts of Upper Saucon Township, Lehigh County; Salisbury Township, Lehigh County; and Bethlehem, Northampton County. The northernmost corner of the river's watershed borders the southernmost part of Fountain Hill. Black River flows in the vicinity of the Saucon Fields tract of Lehigh University's campus in some reaches. History Black River was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1169729. The river is also known as Black Creek or Black River Creek. These variant names appear in Place Names of Northampton County, Pennsylvania, by James and Linda Wright, created in 1988. A concrete tee beam bridge carrying State Route 3004 over Black River was built in 1938 west of Hellertown. A prestressed box beam or girders bridge carrying State Route 3003 was built over the river in 1959. Biology The drainage basin of the Black River is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Wild trout naturally reproduce in the river from its headwaters downstream to its mouth. However, Trout Unlimited's Guide to Pennsylvania Limestone Streams said in 2000 that it was \\"not trout water\\". In 2006, the Black River was identified as one of the places in the Saucon Creek watershed most in need of habitat restoration. The river has been affected by Lehigh University.

She was named a CNN Hero in 2010 and a Purpose Prize winner in 2012.  Life  Burton was born and raised in housing projects in East Los Angeles. Her upbringing was full of turmoil, and she struggled constantly. Her five- year-old son, Marque Hamilton, was accidentally hit and killed by a police cruiser in 1982. Consumed with grief and heartbreak, and without any access to therapy, Burton turned to alcohol and drugs. She became addicted to crack cocaine while living in Watts, Los Angeles. She eventually was arrested and jailed for crack cocaine. She went in and out of prison six times during the 1980s and the 1990s, each time she was released with limited money, no ID, and no social security card. She was trapped in a vicious cycle, where she could not find a job, did not have housing, and would eventually get caught and placed back in prison again. Upon her last release, a prison guard told her that he would see her in prison again soon. Determined to prove him wrong, Burton tried to find a drug treatment facility that was away from her home neighborhood, where it would be too easy to fall back into her old patterns of addiction. It was hard to find a rehabilitation center that she could afford, and finally she found the CLARE Foundation in Santa Monica. She stopped doing drugs in 1997, because of the help she received from the CLARE Foundation. While receiving treatment, it dawned on Burton that there were not facilities like this where she lived, and she began helping other women in similar situations.  Activism  Burton founded the organization A New Way of Life, where she works with formerly incarcerated people fighting problems of re- entry. After her recovery at the CLARE foundation, Burton looked for other opportunities to continue her life outside of prison. She found that resources like food stamps and housing assistance were not given to her because of her record, and it was hard to find support that was affordable. Because of this, Burton was at a loss for ways to continue her life successfully after prison – an issue that far too many individuals face daily. This inspired Burton, and in 1998, Burton bought a house and converted it into a house for recently released female offenders. She started the program by going to the bus station where parolees were released, and inviting women she knew from the system to stay with her. She originally had 10 women living in the house, but after a year she began to lose money – and did not have enough to support everyone. A friend helped her apply for a grant to form this system into a real non-profit organization, and in 2000 A New Way of Life was officially born. Burton worked with organizer Melissa Burch, a member of the Los Angeles Chapter of Critical Resistance to start the LEAD project, which stands for Leadership, Education, Action and Dialogue. The LEAD project offered regular workshops that provided a space for residents of A New Way of Life to dialogue and understand the history of the prison industrial complex and prison abolition. Eventually, Burton became a certified chemical dependency counselor, and she now has five transitional houses in Los Angeles. The program helps women transition back into society, find work, and recover from drug addiction, 75 percent of the women in her program stay drug-free and do not return to prison for 18 months minimum. The organization now runs a free legal clinic, and each woman receives her own caseworker. She has helped more than 1,000 women, and all can stay until they are ready to move on to somewhere else. Further, the organization's legal department has provided pro bono services to over 2,000 formerly incarcerated and incarcerated people. Recently, the organization expanded and now provides $2 million in donated goods each year, which has helped more than 3,000 formerly homeless people get the necessary items to gain a home and live a healthy life. In January 2019, she made a trip to Uganda to not only visit prisons, but also to visit schools that house children of incarcerated mothers. In August 2019, California Governor Gavin Newsom granted a pardon to Burton.  Awards  Susan Burton has received numerous awards and been appointed to several positions in her life time. Some of those accolades include: * 2007, Burton was appointed to the Little Hoover Sentencing Reform Commission and the Gender Responsive Strategies Commission by then-governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. * 2010, Burton was awarded the Citizen Activist Award from the Harvard University Kennedy School of Government. * 2011, CNN named Burton a CNN Hero. * 2012, she was named a Purpose Prize winner. * In the California Wellness Foundation, she has been a Community Fellow. * Through The Women's Foundation of California, Burton was a Women's Policy Institute Fellow as well as a Soros Justice Fellow through the Open Society Foundations. * She is a board member on the Los Angeles Sober Living Network. * 2014, Burton received the James Irvine Foundation Leadership Award. * 2015, she was named one of the United States's 18 New Civil Rights Leaders by the Los Angeles Times. * 2018 she was chosen by the National Women's History Project as one of its honorees for Women's History Month in the United States. * 2019 she was awarded a Doctor of Humane Letters honorary degree from California State University, Northridge.

The sculpture is a flattened oval ring with rounded edges, pierced by a large hole. The inside edge of the hole has two protrusions rising from opposite sides and narrowing to sharp points that almost meet at the centre of the hole, creating a sense of energy and dynamic tension. The points divide the hole into two areas, a smaller one above and a larger one below, like a figure 8, with the shape of the void sometimes interpreted as resembling a human form with a head and a torso. The beginnings of the sculpture can be traced in Moore's works back to a sculpture made in 1939–40, Three Points, and some drawings from 1940. Moore was often inspired by found natural objects, such as stone with a hole. The work may draw inspiration from an elephant skull collected in East Africa by Sir Julian Huxley and displayed in his garden, and later given to Moore as a gift. Oval with Points is also related to other Moore sculptures, included his Spindle Piece and Two Piece Points: Skull, both of which have two points facing outwards rather than inwards. Moore himself later mentioned a link in his mind to spark plugs. Moore made a plaster maquette of Oval with Points (LH 594) in 1968, which was then cast in bronze in an edition of 9+1 (nine castings plus an artist's copy). It measures . The plaster maquette and the bronze artist's copy, cast 0, are held by the Henry Moore Foundation in Perry Green, Hertfordshire. Another example is at the Art Gallery of Ontario. Moore increased the scale of the work in 1968–69, to create Working Model for Oval With Points (LH 595) measuring . The sculpture was originally modelled in plaster, which is now held at the Henry Moore Sculpture Centre at the Art Gallery of Ontario.Henry Moore Sculpture Centre accessed 11 May 2017 This was cast in an edition of 12+2 bronzes (i.e. two artist's copies, and 12 other casts). These two artist's copies are now held by the Henry Moore Foundation, along with two plaster casts of this working model. Other bronze casts are owned by the Museum of Modern Art in New York (not currently on view), the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (not currently on view) and the University of California, Los Angeles (currently on display in the UCLA School of Medicine building). Finally, in 1969, Moore increased the scale again to create a full- size bronze version (LH 596) which is high. It was cast in an edition of 6+1 (six plus one artist's model) 1 by Morris Singer.

Early life and education Brockway was born on September 23, 1907, in Topeka, Kansas. He attended the University of Nebraska and received his B.S. in 1929 and his M.S. a year later. He then moved to the California Institute of Technology, where he was one of the first graduate students of Linus Pauling. He and Pauling were interested in the physics of interatomic interactions and focused their efforts on the structure of chalcopyrite, which established Brockway's interest in electron diffraction as a method for studying molecular structure. Brockway received his Ph.D. in 1933. He spent the next several years as a research fellow at Caltech and then received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1937 to spend the following year at the University of Oxford and Royal Institution. Academic career After returning to the United States in 1938, Brockway joined the faculty at the University of Michigan, where he reached the rank of full professor in 1945 and remained until he assumed professor emeritus status at the end of 1976. During his career at Michigan he was noted as a committed educator and continued teaching specialized seminars after his retirement. Brockway's research interests focused primarily on continued development of electron diffraction, which he began studying as a graduate student, and broadened later to include surface chemistry and thin films. Brockway received the American Chemical Society Award for Pure Chemistry in 1940. He held a number of leadership positions in scientific societies: he helped to found the American Crystallographic Association and served as its president in 1953, as well as serving in various capacities with the International Union of Crystallography and with the National Research Council. In addition, he consulted for external institutions working on defense-related projects during World War II and for industrial interests thereafter.

The town contains the historic centre of the county- level city of Dali and is also commonly known as Dali Old Town (). The modern centre of Dali City, however, is 10 km south of the old town at Xiaguan. Being the county seat of Dali City, Xiaguan is often labelled as Dali on maps and is sometimes referred to as Dali New Town () to distinguish it from Dali Town. The old town has become well-known as a tourist site in part thanks to its picturesque location and historic Bai architecture. History Fou\\" and \\"El- hai\\" from Du Halde's 1736 Description of China. Night view of the area Dali has long been a regional centre of commerce, being located at a crossroads of trade routes between Tibet, China, Burma, and Southeast Asia. The Bai people first settled the region 3000 years ago. Dali first emerged as the capital of the Nanzhao Kingdom in the 8th century. Later, the town served as the capital of the Kingdom of Dali until its conquest by the Yuan conquest of the area. The old town of Dali has been preserved in a 1.5 by 1.5 km wide townsite surrounded by its ancient walls. Due to its relatively well-preserved architecture, the town has developed as a major tourist attraction in recent decades. Major sites of interest include the Three Pagodas, Dali Museum, the ancient city gates, an artificial town built as the set for Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils, and the Cang Mountain Range to the west. Geography Dali Town is located in a depression at the southern end of the Yun Mountains, part of the greater Hengduan Mountains at the southeast edge of the Tibetan Plateau. This depression, an extension of the Red River Fault, is filled by Erhai, a lake that is part of the Mekong River basin. The old town of Dali is located on a plain between Erhai on the east and the Cang Mountains to the west. Transportation Dali is served by local public transit buses in Dali City connecting with Xiaguan. The town also has some long-distance bus services that run to Kunming and Lijiang.

Tourism The old town Dali has been dramatically changed by tourism since the mid 2000s, when a number of bed and breakfast inns began to open to cater to domestic and foreign tourists. Subsequent to pollution of Erhai lake, and a visit from Chinese President and General Secretary of the Communist Party Xi Jinping, inns within 20 metres of the lakeside were closed and in some cases demolished, in order to prevent sewage from leaking into the lake.

The horse is depicted on two legs, with the right fore and left rear foot raised, perhaps at the trot. It is écorché (flayed) with the skin removed so the underlying musculature is clearly visible, and stands about high The sculpture may have been created as a preliminary a study for Giambologna's equestrian statue of Duke Cosimo cast in 1591 and displayed at the Piazza della Signoria in Florence. It is similar to Giambologna's statue of a pacing horse. It shows influence from some écorché drawings by Leonardo da Vinci, made for his uncompleted equestrian statue of Gian Giacomo Trivulzio, and resembles prints in Carlo Ruini's book, Anatomia del Cavallo. Some sources identify some inspiration from the ancient equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius in Rome. The anatomical detail of the sculpture prefigures the intimate knowledge gained by George Stubbs from his own dissections. The sculpture was displayed at the Villa Mattei in Rome in the 18th century. Pope Clement XIV refused permission for Giuseppe Mattei to sell it, along with other artworks from his collection, in 1770. It was later sold to Cardinal Fesch, and then sold from his collection in Paris in June 1816. It was acquired by Charles Loeser in London in 1913, and left to the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence on his death in 1928. Copies of Giambologna's sculpture original were made at the Vatican foundry, by its directors Giuseppe Valadier and then Francesco Righetti. One of four known full size copies by Valadier was sold at Christie's in July 2013 for £1.4m; this sculpture may have been owned the Dukes of Northumberland before passing through the collection of Boris Kochno and Christian Bérard, and then Alexis von Rosenberg, Baron de Redé before being sold by Sotheby's in Monaco in 1975 for 1.5 million French francs. A different example of the sculpture was acquired in Rome by James Erskine, later 3rd Erskine baronet of Torrie, around 1803, who attempted to sell it in London in 1804, and then brought it to Scotland. This sculpture is probably a copy by Valadier, as the original was still Cardinal Fesch's collection at the time. Erskine left his art collection, including the sculpture, to the University of Edinburgh on his death in 1836, and now held by the university's Museum of Fine Arts. Another example by Valadier is held by the Michele and Donald D'Amour Museum of Fine Arts, in Springfield, Massachusetts. The University of Edinburgh veterinary school holds a more recent copy of the Edinburgh sculpture made by Mario Pastori in 1984. The Edinburgh sculpture was also copied to become the Breeders Cup trophy in the 1980s, with smaller replicas presented to the winners of Breeders' Cup World Championships races.

It was the nerve center of the city during most of its history, acting as its main square. A part of it was designed by Juan de Herrera in times of the reign of Philip II. Here horses, donkeys, foals, mares, mules and other beasts were sold, when the city of Toledo was Spanish-Muslim city. Here was organized the most important market of the city. It has been celebrating for centuries, it is a weekly market. Today it celebrate on Tuesday in the vicinity of Paseo de Merchán or de la Vega.  History  The origin of the name Zocodover comes from the Arabic language sūq ad-dawābb, which means \\"market of burden beasts\\". This place was also the place where bullfighting and the cucañas were organized in the celebrations of the locality. It is, therefore, the nerve center of the social life of the city since medieval times. But Zocodover was also the center for more mournful acts like the autos-da-fé of the Inquisition or the public execution of the prisoners. It is when the old square was destroyed by a fire on October 29, 1589 when it was decided to build a new one. In 1854 an ambitious project is drawn up, by the hand of the technician Santiago Martín Ruiz, to reorganize the plaza de Zocodover, transforming it into a rectangular portico square.  Reforms  Several attempts should have been made to widen the square, although of these two are the most outstanding; The first and oldest date of the time of the Catholic Monarchs, approved by the same Isabella of Castile in 1502. The proposal came from the same municipality of Toledo and was authorized to all its organs the remodeling of this one, since the former square was too narrow, and since the Alcázar lacked an appropriate place they wanted to join both to the front facade of the building. To do this, a wall would rise to overcome the gap to the postern of San Miguel and also were regulated its characteristics, among which it highlight the construction of typical arcades of Castilian architecture. This colossal work was never put into practice since, considering the technical possibilities of the time and the high slope from Zocodover to the main facade of the Alcázar, 23 meters high, the difficulty became very heavy adding to this the fact that to be able to lower the land would have to have dug in living rock. The second expansion was done and dates from the beginning of the 17th century. This consisted in the demolition of a series of houses of little value that seems to be difficult the total vision of Zocodover from its top to the bottom and vice versa. Never more arches were realized and probably this fact is due to that it was not wanted to remove meters to the square. Nowadays Zocodover is one of the places of the city where many events and celebrations are held, as well as serving as a popular meeting point and enjoyment of the Toledo and above all a must for the thousands of tourists who mark the streets of the historical quarter throughout the year.

At the time of the hospital's founding, mental illness was a very big issue. Mentally ill individuals were commonly mistreated and their quality of living were nowhere near that of those who were of good mental health. The year 1901, a census was done to count the number of mentally ill individuals in the country. The census found 133 mentally ill individuals, 124 of which lived in rural areas. The hospital changed a lot, although it could not take in everyone that needed is, as the Director of Health at that time told Alþingi. The hospital's methods of operation have changed drastically of the years with the introduction of new and improved therapeutics. Today, Kleppur's operations mainly consist of rehabilitation and various treatments for people with mental health problems, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, anxiety, depression and addiction.

Reactions =Media= Initial media reports described Sessions' move as abrupt and unexpected, but not unprecedented. Slate Leon Neyfakh accused media outlets of sensationalizing Sessions' actions, which he said were \\"nothing particularly unusual or surprising\\", and noted the mass firings of U.S. attorneys accompanying each presidential transition. National Review pointed out that Janet Reno began her tenure as President Bill Clinton's attorney general in March 1993 by firing U.S. attorneys for 93 of the 94 federal districts, this being more than twice as many as Trump attorney general Sessions fired on Friday. The Washington Post contrasted the Trump administration's decision with those of George W. Bush and Barack Obama, who replaced U.S. attorneys gradually. Sessions' move came less than 24 hours after Sean Hannity, the Fox News commentator and host of The Sean Hannity Show, called for the \\"immediate expulsion\\", or a \\"purge\\", of Obama appointees at the United States Justice Department in his show's opening monologue. =Politicians= Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, criticized the \\"abrupt firing. \\" She said, \\"Under previous administrations, orderly transitions allowed U.S. attorneys to leave gradually as their replacements were chosen. This was done to protect the independence of our prosecutors and avoid disrupting ongoing federal cases. At a time when Attorney General Sessions has recused himself from major investigations into the Trump campaign, the independence of federal prosecutors could not be more important.\\" Tim Purdon, who served as U.S. attorney for the District of North Dakota from 2010 to 2015, said: \\"The way the Obama administration handled it was appropriate and respectful and classy. This saddens me because many of these people are great public servants and now they are being asked to leave.\\" Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said he was \\"troubled to learn of reports of requests for resignations from the remaining U.S. Attorneys, particularly that of Preet Bharara.\\" Other politicians expressed dismay, such as former Vermont Governor Howard Dean, Massachusetts U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, New York State Republican Assemblyman Steve McLaughlin, and Brian Kolb, the Assembly Leader, over Bharara's firing. =Resignees= Preet Bharara said he was fired after refusing to submit his resignation. Bharara said he was fired and did not resign. He had been asked to maintain his position in November 2016 by then President-elect Trump. Trump’s Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, Tom Price, traded stocks of health-related corporations during the time period when Price was working on crafting the legislation that would affect those firms. Bharara was said to have been supervising an investigation about the propriety of those trades.

Ciriclio, was an American photographer and educator particularly known for her photographic mapping project \\"Neighborhood\\". She lived and worked in Oakland, California. Ciriclio worked for 40 years as a professor of photography at California College of the Arts (CCA), retiring as Professor Emerita in 2017. Life and education Ciriclio was born in 1946 in New York City, grew up in Westchester County, New York and later moved to Phoenix, Arizona. While she was a student at Phoenix College, she worked as a dispatcher and crime scene photographer for the Phoenix Police Department. She received an A.A. from Phoenix College in 1969, a B.F.A. from California College of Arts and Crafts in 1972, and a M.F.A. from Mills College in 1974.  Career  Early in her teaching career, Ciriclio was an instructor in photography at Chabot College and San Francisco Art Institute. Ciriclio was chair of CCA's photography program from 1988—1992, and 1999—2008. In addition to her work as a professor of photography at California College of the Arts, she also served as interim Vice President for Academic Affairs from 1986-1987 and as Vice President for Academic Affairs from 1989-1992. During her time in the position, Ciriclio made great progress in budget planning and faculty governance. Aside from her work as a photography educator and academic administrator, Ciriclio also served on the board of directors at San Francisco Camerawork Gallery from 1983-1986. Awards and fellowships In 1979, Ciriclio was awarded a National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship. Works Ciriclio's map projects explore the chronicling of place; combining large scale map replicas with thousands of detail photographs of an area, in works that function both sculpturally and temporally. Ciriclio cites her day to day surroundings as inspiration in her photographic practice; she searches out visual texture in the ordinariness of her suburban environment and neighborhood, documenting the visual landscape over time and compiling photographs into map works and book works. Ciriclio's piece, \\"Neighborhood\\" was exhibited in 1977 as part of the group show San Francisco/Los Angeles/New York held at the San Francisco Art Institute and in 1980 as a solo exhibition at the University of California, Davis Memorial Union Art Gallery. The ordinariness of her suburban neighborhood, which she photographed for the piece, had a universal quality that viewers responded to identifying it was their neighborhood; whether that was in San Francisco, Salt Lake City or Atlanta. Hal Fischer described Ciriclio's piece as \\"sympathetic to the New Topographics genre\\". Another of Ciriclio's works, \\"Haddon Roadwork\\" was featured as part of a group exhibition at 1708 Gallery in Richmond, Virginia in 1985 when it was known as 1708 East Main. Similar to Ciriclio's \\"Neighborhood\\", \\"Haddon Roadwork\\" also involved creating a map with pictures she had taken of houses along the streets of her neighborhood. As Mitchell Kahan wrote in Art Papers, \\"There is neither an aestheticized quality to them nor the cool detached aura of scientific documentation. They are as off hand and casual as a realtor's handbook\\".

The special election was necessary due to former mayor Pete Wilson's resignation to take a seat in the United States Senate. Municipal elections in California are officially non-partisan, though some candidates do receive funding and support from various political parties. The non-partisan primary was held March 15, 1983. Maureen O'Connor and Roger Hedgecock received the most votes and advanced to the May runoff. Hedgecock received a majority of the votes in the May election, and was elected mayor for the remainder of Wilson's term. Pete Wilson resignation In November 1982, San Diego Mayor Pete Wilson was elected to the United States Senate representing California. On January 3, 1983, Wilson resigned as mayor of San Diego to be sworn in as a senator. Deputy Mayor Bill Cleator served as acting mayor until an election could be held to fill the office for the remainder of Wilson's third term.

Former city council member Maureen O'Connor, a Democrat, was considered the early front-runner and likely to advance to a runoff election, if not win the first round outright. O'Connor's major opponents in the first round election included county supervisor Roger Hedgecock, city council member and acting mayor Bill Cleator, and city council member Bill Mitchell, all self-identified Republicans. In addition to the main four candidates, an additional 16 other candidates qualified for the ballot. In her campaign, O'Connor proposed freezing utility rates, focusing on creating jobs, and improving public transportation. Hedgecock ran as a political moderate and emphasized environmental protection. Cleator positioned himself as a pro-business Republican, and he criticized Hedgecock as a renegade Republican. On March 15, 1983, O'Connor came in first in the primary with 36.8 percent of the vote, followed by Hedgecock with 31.1 percent of the vote. Cleator finished in third with 25.6 percent of the vote. Mitchell, whose campaign never really took off, trailed behind in fourth with only 5.0 percent of the vote. None of the 16 minor candidates received more than 1 percent individually. Because no candidate received a majority of the vote, O'Connor and Hedgecock advanced to a runoff election scheduled for May 3, 1983. Hedgecock ultimately prevailed in the runoff with 52.2 percent of the vote, and was elected mayor.

It explores Fisher's concept of \\"capitalist realism,\\" which he takes to describe \\"the widespread sense that not only is capitalism the only viable political and economic system, but also that it is now impossible even to imagine a coherent alternative to it.\\" The book investigates what Fisher describes as the widespread effects of neoliberal ideology on popular culture, work, education, and mental health in contemporary society. Capitalist Realism was an unexpected success and has influenced a range of writers. The subtitle refers to British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's pro-market slogan \\"There is no alternative\\". Definition Arguably and widely regarded as Mark Fisher's most prolific idea, capitalist realism is an ideological framework for viewing capitalism and its effects on politics, economics, and public thought. The name itself is a play on the term \\"socialist realism\\". Fisher wrote extensively on the subject under both his pseudonym \\"k-punk\\" and his own name. He frequently gave interviews on the subject with political bloggers and thinkers that expanded on his definition of the concept. According to Fisher, the quotation \\"it is easier to imagine an end to the world than an end to capitalism,” attributed to both Fredric Jameson and Slavoj Žižek, encompasses the essence of capitalist realism. Capitalist realism is loosely defined as the predominant conception that capitalism is the only viable economic system, and thus there can be no imaginable alternative. Fisher likens capitalist realism to a \\"pervasive atmosphere\\" that affects areas of cultural production, political- economic activity, and general thought. > Capitalist realism as I understand it cannot be confined to art or to the > quasi-propagandistic way in which advertising functions. It is more like a > pervasive atmosphere, conditioning not only the production of culture but > also the regulation of work and education, and acting as a kind of invisible > barrier constraining thought and action.Mark Fisher, Capitalist Realism: Is > There No Alternative? (Winchester, UK; Washington [D.C.]: Zero, 2009). Capitalist realism propagates an idea of the post-political, in which the fall of the Soviet Union both solidified capitalism as the only effective political-economic system and removed the question of capitalism's dissolution from any political consideration. This has subverted the arena of political discussion from one in which capitalism is one of many potential means of operating an economy, to one in which political considerations operate solely within the confines of the capitalist system. Similarly, within the frame of capitalist realism, mainstream anti-capitalist movements shifted away from promoting alternative systems and toward mitigating capitalism's worst effects. Capitalist realism does not assert that capitalism is a perfect system, but instead that it is the only system that can operate in a means compatible with human nature and economic law. By promoting the idea that innate human desire is only compatible with capitalism, any other system that is not based on the personal accumulation of wealth and capital is seen as counter to human nature and, by extension, impossible to implement. Fisher argues that the bank bailouts following the 2008 economic crisis were a quintessential example of capitalist realism in action, reasoning that the bailouts occurred largely because the idea of allowing the banking system to fail was unimaginable to both politicians and the general population. Due to the intrinsic value of banks to the capitalist system, Fisher proposes, the influence of capitalist realism meant that such a failure was never considered an option. As a consequence, Fisher observes, the neoliberal system survived and capitalist realism was further validated. Fisher classifies the current state of capitalist realism in the neoliberal system in the following terms: > The only powerful agents influencing politicians and managers in education > are business interests. It's become far too easy to ignore workers and, > partly because of this, workers feel increasingly helpless and impotent. The > concerted attack on unions by neoliberal interest groups, together with the > shift from a Fordist to a post-Fordist organisation of the economy – the > move towards casualisation, just-in-time production, globalization – has > eroded the power base of unions [and thus the labor force]. Fisher regards capitalist realism as emerging from a purposeful push by the neoliberal right to transform the attitudes of both the general population and the left towards capitalism and specifically the post-Fordist form of capitalism that prevailed throughout the 1980s. The relative inability of the political left to come up with an alternative economic model in response to the rise of neoliberal capitalism and the concurrent Reaganomics era created a vacuum that facilitated the birth of a capitalist realist system. The collapse of the Soviet Union, which Fisher believes represented the only real example of a working non-capitalist system, further cemented the place of capitalist realism both politically and in the general population, and was hailed as the decisive final victory of capitalism. According to Fisher, in a post-Soviet era, unchecked capitalism was able to reframe history into a capitalist narrative in which neoliberalism was the result of a natural progression of history and even embodied the culmination of human development. Despite the fact that the emergence of capitalist realism is tied to the birth of neoliberalism, Fisher is clear to state that capitalist realism and neoliberalism are separate entities that simply reinforce each other. According to Fisher, capitalist realism has the potential to live past the demise of neoliberal capitalism, though Fisher posits that the opposite would not be true. Capitalist realism is inherently anti-utopian, as it holds that no matter the flaws or externalities, capitalism is the only possible means of operation. Neoliberalism conversely glorifies capitalism by portraying it as providing the means necessary to pursue and achieve near-utopian socioeconomic conditions. In this way, capitalist realism pacifies opposition to neoliberalism's overly positive projections while neoliberalism counteracts the despair and disillusionment central to capitalist realism with its utopian claims. Effects According to Fisher, capitalist realism has so captured public thought that the idea of anti-capitalism no longer acts as the antithesis to capitalism. Instead, it is deployed as a means for reinforcing capitalism. This is done through media which aims to provide a safe means of consuming anti-capitalist ideas without actually challenging the system. The lack of coherent alternatives, as presented through the lens of capitalist realism, leads many anti-capitalist movements to cease targeting the end of capitalism, but instead to mitigate its worst effects, often through individual consumption-based activities such as Product Red. With regards to public views on capitalism, Fisher coined the term 'reflexive impotence' which describes a phenomenon where people recognize the flawed nature of capitalism, but believe there are no means of effecting change. According to Fisher, this inaction leads to a self-fulfilling prophecy as well as a negative toll on their mental health. Fisher identifies a widespread popular desire for a public sphere that operates outside of the state and free from the undesired \\"add-ons of capital\\". However, he claims that it is the state alone that has been able to maintain public arenas against the capitalist push for mass privatization. Popular neoliberal thought supports the destruction of public spheres in favor of the privatization of public institutions such as education and health based on the assumption that the market best determines public needs. In this vein, Fisher also raises the idea of 'business ontology', which is the capitalist ideology in which purposes and objectives are understood exclusively in business terms. He further postulates that in the case of uniformly business-oriented social conditions there is no place for the public and its only chance at survival is by means of extinguishing the business framework in public services, adding that \\"if businesses can't be run as businesses, why should public services?\\" Thus, a frequent topic of Fisher's writing is the future of the public sphere in the face of neoliberal business ontology and what it might look like in absence of a centralized state-run industry. =Realism= The 'realism' aspect of capitalist realism and its inspiration—socialist realism—is based on Jacques Lacan's distinction between the Real and 'realities', such as capitalist realism, which are ideologically based understandings of the world that reject facts that lie outside of their interpretations. Fisher posits that an appeal to the Real which is suppressed by capitalist realism may begin to deconstruct the pervasiveness of the ideology. Fisher points to areas such as climate change, mental health, and bureaucracy that can be highlighted to show the weaknesses and gaps in capitalist realism. In the wake of Fisher's work, other critical theorists in academia and the political blogosphere have employed capitalist realism as a theoretical framework.Prominently ; Reading Capitalist Realism, ed. by Alison Shonkwiler and Leigh Claire La Berge (Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 2014).

Her candidacy was sponsored by Lucy, Lady Houston, and came despite the opposition of Ernest. In a year which generally saw a landslide victory for the Conservatives, Tennant took 22.2% of the vote.F. W. S. Craig, British parliamentary election results 1918–1949. Keene describes Tennant as standing in 1933, but Craig's authoritative work confirms the correct dates. Undeterred, she set up an office in the constituency with the aim of encouraging local employers to take on more staff, and forcing the local council to deal with some housing issues. She stood again at the 1935 general election, her vote share falling to 19.0%. During the Spanish Civil War, Tennant visited areas under Nationalist control, near the Portuguese border. She was driven around by a Falangist activist, and came to the conclusion that what she described as the \\"Glorious Uprising\\" was an unqualified success, the war being entirely the fault of communists, and that a dictatorship was necessary to save the country. Although she was only in the country for ten days, on her return to the UK, she published Spanish Journey: Personal Experiences of the Civil War. At home she was a leading figure in Friends of National Spain, a group formed by Lord Phillimore in 1937 to win the support of leading members of the political elite and nobility for Francisco Franco, and in this group was close to the far-right academic Charles Saroléa who, like Tennant, was based in Scotland at the time.Gavin Bowd, Fascist Scotland: Caledonia and the Far Right, Edinburgh: Birlinn, 2013, pp. 101–102 Tennant maintained contact with many far-right activists during World War II, and met regularly with Jeffrey Hamm, during which they discussed their support for anti-Semitism.Mark Pitchford, The Conservative Party and the Extreme Right 1945–1975, p.15 Near the end of the war, Tennant came to lead two groups, the \\"Never Again Association\\" and the \\"Face the Facts Association\\", both extreme nationalist groups.Frank Honigsbaum, The Division in British Medicine, p.46 Though neither attracted a significant membership, she used them to promote various views, mostly notably her opposition to bread rationing. She stood in Putney at the 1945 United Kingdom general election as an independent Conservative. Opposing an official Conservative and three other candidates, she took only 144 votes and came bottom of the poll. By this point Tennant had become outspoken in her anti-Semitism, stating that she was prepared to \\"go all out against the Jew\\". To this end she sought to work with Sylvia Gosse and Margaret Crabtree, two residents of Belsize Park who in October 1945 organised an \\"anti-alien\\" petition against plans to house Jewish refugees in the Metropolitan Borough of Hampstead. The petition gained some press support and had the backing of Conservative MPs Charles Challen and Waldron Smithers as well as Ernest Benn and the Society for Individual Freedom. Tennant attempted to link Hamm in with this burgeoning movement and the pair held a meeting in Belsize Park on 21 November 1945 in an attempt to link Hamm with them. Before the meeting Hamm removed a portrait of Oswald Mosley for fear of scaring off the Conservative-linked Tennant although in the end he was impressed by the strength of her commitment to anti- Semitism.Stephen Dorril, Blackshirt – Sir Oswald Mosley and british Fascism, Penguin, 2007, p. 549 The initiative was largely unsuccessful however as Hamm's methods of provocative street politics and the heckling of leftist meetings were far removed from the high society circles in which the likes of Gosse and Crabtree moved.Graham Macklin, Very Deeply Dyed in Black: Sir Oswald Mosley and the Resurrection of British Fascism After 1945, London: I.B. Tauris, 2007, p. 40 Later years In 1948 Tennant's husband brought a divorce petition on the grounds of desertion. She contested the petition on the grounds that she \\"objected to living with [him] because of his Nazi sympathies\\". He remarried in 1950.Charles Mosley (ed.), Burke's Peerage, Baronetage & Knightage, 107th edition, 3 volumes.

She sold this on after a few years and bought a series of farms in this manner, the last being one she newly established on the Diddleum Plains. She again became politically active, and stood as a Democratic Labor Party candidate for the Senate in the 1961 Australian federal election, but took only 476 votes.\\"1961 Senate: Tasmania\\", Adam Carr's Election Archive She began suffering from heart problems, and returned to live with family in England, dying in Kettering in 1963.

It was also known as the (i.e. former Sannohe Castle). It was located at a strategic junction of the Ōshū Kaidō with the Kakuno Kaidō and the Mabechi River.The site of the castle, as well as the Buddhist temple of Sankō-ji, and the Moto-Sannohe Hachiman-gu Shinto Shrine collectively received protection as a National Historic Site on 30 September 2004. Portions of the site are now on private lands occupied by local farm houses and fruit orchards. Shōjojidate ruins The Nanbu clan claimed descent from the Seiwa Genji of Kai Province. Minamoto no Yoshimitsu was awarded Kai Province following the Gosannen War, and his great-grandson Nobuyoshi took the surname Takeda. Another great grandson, Mitsuyuki, took the name \\"Nanbu\\", after the location of his estates in Kai Province, which are now part of the town of Nanbu, Yamanashi. \\"Nanbu-shi\\" on Harimaya.com (accessed 15 August 2008) Nanbu Mitsuyuki joined Minamoto no Yoritomo at the Battle of Ishibashiyama and served in various mid-level positions within the Kamakura shogunate and is mentioned several times in the Azuma Kagami. He accompanied Yoritomo in the conquest of the Hiraizumi Fujiwara in 1189, and was awarded with vast estates in Nukanobu District the extreme northeast of Honshū, building Shōjujidate Castle. The fortification was more of a fortified house than a true castle, and is a built on a roughly trapezoidal 20 meter hilltop, partially protected to the north by a 20 meter wide dry moat, and by steep cliffs on other sides. It was also located adjacent to the Nanbu clan temple of Shōjo-ji, from which it takes its name. The castle served as the residence of the Sannohe Nanbu clan for over 200 years, until the time of the 24th hereditary chieftain, Nanbu Harumasa, when it was burned down in a revolt by one of his retainers in June 1539. Shōjujidate Castle is located only 700 meters west of Hiragasaki Castle and four kilometers north of Sannohe Castle. Sanko-ji The temple of Sanko-ji is a Buddhist temple belonging to the Rinzai school of Japanese Zen and is located just to the north of the ruins of Shōjo-ji. It is one of what were once several temples patronized by the Nanbu clan in the area, but the other temples relocated to Morioka during the Edo period when the Nanbu clan made Morioka Castle their seat. Sanko-ji remained as it contained the graves of the 26th chieftain, Nanbu Nobunao and his wife (Nanbu Town Historic Site), and the mortuary chapel of the 27th chieftain, Nanbu Toshinao (Aomori Prefectural Historic Site), and the mortuary chapel of Toshinao's son, Nanbu Toshiyasu (Important Cultural Property). In addition, the temple has a small tumulus which is claimed to be the grave of the 2nd chieftain of the Nanbu clan, Nanbu Sanemitsu. Moto-Sannohe Hachiman-gu This Hachiman shrine is built on a plateau along the Mabuchi River, south of the main site of the Shōju-ji temple. It is believed to have been the site of a fortification erected by Nambu Nobunao in 1578; however, the shrine itself is said to have been transferred from Kai Province when the Nanbu clan relocated to Nukanobu District. The grave of the 23rd chieftain of the clan, Nanbu Yasunobu (Aomori Prefectural ICP) remains at this shrine; however, other graves which once existed at this location have disappeared due to the erosion by the Mabuchi River.

The New England Woman's Press Association (NEWPA) was founded by six Boston newspaper women in 1885 and incorporated in 1890. By the turn of the century it had over 150 members. NEWPA sought not only to bring female colleagues together and further their careers in a male-dominated field, but to use the power of the press for the good of society. The group raised funds for charity and supported women's suffrage and other political causes. NEWPA was a charter member of both the General Federation of Women's Clubs and the National Federation of Press Women, among other organizations. Notable members included Lucy Stone, Julia Ward Howe, and Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin. Its last meeting was held in 1982.  History  = Founding = In November 1885, Marion A. McBride of the Boston Post sent out a call to other Boston newspaper women to establish a press association.Also spelled \\"MacBride\\"; see Lord (1932), p. 9. McBride had already been involved in the founding of the Illinois Woman's Press Association and the National Woman's Press Association. Boston was a logical choice for another such group. With 9 daily newspapers and 19 weeklies, it was one of the busiest media centers in the country, but few of its newspapers hired women full time. Most women in the field worked as part-time correspondents and contributors. Their professional opportunities were limited, and they were often treated disrespectfully by their male colleagues.Burt (2000), pp. 153-154. On November 17, six women met at the office of Boston Herald reporter Sallie Joy White and formed the New England Woman's Press Association (NEWPA).NEWPA (1895), p. 21. Besides McBride and White, the other women were Helen M. Winslow of the Boston Daily Advertiser, Grace W. Soper of the Boston Daily Journal, Estelle M. Hatch (later Estelle M. H. Merrill) of the Boston Globe, and freelance journalist Cora Stuart Wheeler. White was chosen to be the first president and Hatch the first secretary. The group met at the headquarters of the Woman's Journal until it outgrew that space and moved to the Parker House Hotel.NEWPA (1895), p. 22. = Mission and membership = Over the next year, Hatch recruited a dozen more women to the organization.NEWPA (1895), p. 21. Alice Stone Blackwell of the Woman's Journal headed a committee that drew up a constitution and bylaws. To make clear that NEWPA was a professional association and not a social club, membership was limited to women living in New England who were \\"regularly and professionally connected with the press of New England, either as writers, editors, business managers, or correspondents --all, in short, for whom work on the press is a vocation, and not an avocation, a breadwinning occupation, and not an amusement.\\" The group was incorporated on September 15, 1890.Burt (2000), p. 163. Starting in 1891, associate members were admitted, but not allowed to vote.Burt (2000), p. 155. Most of NEWPA's members were from the Boston area; others hailed from Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Nova Scotia. They included proprietors of local newspapers such as the Winthrop Visitor, editors of household, fashion, society, art, and literature departments, and freelance journalists who contributed to many different newspapers and magazines. Lillian A. Lewis, the first African-American woman reporter in Boston, made national headlines when she was admitted to the association in 1889.Pittsburgh Post (November 30, 1889). In the 1920s, NEWPA began accepting radio script writers, public relations writers, playwrights, and other \\"kindred women writers.\\" The association maintained an average of more than 120 members until the mid-1940s.Burt (2000), p. 158. NEWPA's constitution served as a model for many other women's press organizations over the next twenty years; for example, the Pacific Coast Woman's Press Association, founded in 1890, modeled its constitution after NEWPA's, and went on to become a leader of the women's movement in California.Gullett (2000), pp. 51-52. NEWPA's object was \\"to promote acquaintance and good-fellowship among newspaper women\\" and to use the power of the press to promote \\"good objects in social, philanthropic, and reformatory lines.\\" In other words, it was a professional association, but one that aimed to make a positive difference in the community.NEWPA (1895), p. 5. As such, it was part of the women's club movement.Burt (2000), p. 157. It became a charter member of the General Federation of Women's Clubs in 1890; the International Federation of Women's Press Clubs in 1891; the Massachusetts Federation of Women's Clubs in 1895; and the National Federation of Press Women in 1938.Burt (2000), pp. 156, 163. = Social and professional activities = For the first few years, NEWPA held literary and business meetings twice a month, elections each November, and an outing each spring. They invited prominent authors and newspaper women such as Jane Cunningham Croly,Burt (2000), p. 156. Amelia Edwards,Lord (1932), p. 39. and Frances H. BurnettBoston Post (February 11, 1894). to speak about their work. Each February, male friends and relatives of members were invited to a \\"Gentlemen's Night\\" at the Hotel Vendome, featuring guest speakers such as Mayor Josiah Quincy.Lord (1932), p. 110. One member wrote in 1901, \\"However busy a newspaper woman may be the rest of the year, on gentlemen's night she lays aside all care, puts on her most becoming gown, and consigns to oblivion assignments, hurry calls for copy, and all the rest of the daily routine.\\"Lord (1932), p. 140. They also hosted special events, such as authors' readings, teas, and receptions. During World War I the association began holding fewer social events, but continued holding monthly business and literary meetings. NEWPA established the Woman's Press Bureau in 1888 to help members find work. On February 11, 1894, they called attention to the work of women journalists by publishing a special \\"women's edition\\" of the Boston Post, \\"written, edited, and put out entirely by women.\\" In the 1930s and 40s, NEWPA regularly broadcast shows on WEEI and WORL. Starting in the 1930s they also published a monthly bulletin. Annual workshops offered expertise on such topics as \\"Writing a Feature Column\\" and \\"Editing Winter Sports.\\" In 1946 NEWPA established an annual awards competition, with several categories such as news story, feature story, and \\"article or column of special interest to women.\\" The New England Newspaper Woman of the Year award was added in 1951; recipients included Catherine Coyne of the Boston Herald, Mary Crewmen of the Boston Globe, and Mary Handy of the Christian Science Monitor. = Charitable and reform efforts = In its early years, NEWPA was active in community affairs and politics. On January 18, 1887, the same day its constitution and bylaws were adopted, the group was addressed by \\"Mme. Charpiot,\\" superintendent of the Home for Intemperate Women, who spoke of the need for matrons at Boston's police stations.Boston Globe (January 19, 1887). Marion McBride had first spoken to Ms. Charpiot about this issue in 1886. She recalled later: > I told her I had determined to take it up and not lay it down until we had > police matrons, not only for the city, but for the State as well. I went to > police headquarters and got from the books the numbers of women arrested in > 1885 and other facts and figures which I sent out at once to the leading > papers in the State and to papers in Chicago, St. Louis, San Francisco and > New Orleans.Boston Globe (May 4, 1887). In February, the \\"lady newspaper men\\" of NEWPA voted to show their support for the movement by signing a petition to the state legislature.Boston Globe (February 2, 1887). A few days later, a short article in the Boston Globe reminded readers of the need for police matrons, and encouraged activists to keep the pressure on city and state officials.Boston Globe (February 5, 1887). NEWPA's reporters and editors continued to call the public's attention to the issue over the next few months. By early May the legislature had passed a bill to appoint police matrons in Massachusetts cities and establish a house of detention for women in Boston. McBride attributed the success of the movement to the \\"kindness and courage\\" of the Boston press. The association campaigned for international copyright laws in 1889, and for \\"clean journalism\\" at the turn of the century.Burt (2000), pp. 156, 162. During the Panic of 1893 it formed a benevolent society, \\"Samaritania,\\" which raised money for the poor and established a fund for journalists in need. They organized authors' readings, auctions, and other fundraising events, and sponsored a hospital bed for women writers at Lynn Hospital. In 1914, NEWPA marched in the Boston suffrage parade, and in 1919 Dr. Grace E. Cross represented NEWPA at the National Woman's Party demonstration in Washington, D.C.Burt (2000), p. 157. NEWPA was far less politically active during the \\"women's liberation\\" movement of the 1960s and 70s. The association took no formal position on the Equal Rights Amendment, for example, issued no petitions, and sent no representatives to demonstrations. One former president, Muriel Knight, said members were too busy to devote much time to activism, while another, Evelena Hudson, attributed the change to conservative leadership.Burt (2000), p. 159. = Later years = Membership declined over the years due to competition from other groups such as the Society of Professional Journalists (SPJ), American Women in Radio & Television (AWRT), and Women in Communications, Inc. (WICI). In an attempt to attract new members, NEWPA began admitting men in the early 1970s. Attendance continued to decline, and fewer meetings were held. The association held its last annual meeting in 1982.  Presidents  * Sallie Joy White, 1885-1890Lord (1932), p. 49. * Estelle M. Hatch, 1891-1893Lord (1932), pp. 60, 63. * Helen M.

It was formed in 2014 from volunteers of Ivano- Frankivsk Oblast (Prykarpattya region), and was subordinated to the Ministry of Defence. Battalion was disbanded in January 2015.  History  An all volunteer unit largely composed of members from the Transcarpathian region of Ukraine and cities of Ivano-Frankivsk and Uzhhorod numbering around 500 people. Unlike other volunteer battalions the unit's main mission is to keep peace in its home region and not anti-terror operations. The unit's main mission is to protect critical facilities, ensure communication, guard the state border, and assist public and military authorities in western Ukraine. Zakarpattia Oblast is the least populated region of Ukraine, therefore deploying troops away from the area would leave it understaffed, the battalion is meant to assist authorities while regular police and military troops are deployed. The unit was eventually deployed to the War in Donbass and played an infamous role in the Battle of Ilovaisk. The battle began on 7 August 2014 and Ukraine's forces entered the city of Ilovaisk on 18 August 2014. The Prykarpattya Battalion did not take part in direct assault but was charged with holding the flank of the main component of Ukraine's troops. However, about 2,000 separatist reinforcements backed by Russian forces crossed from the Russian border to encircle Ukraine's troops in Ilvaisk. Almost all of the unit's 500 troops abandoned their post once they started coming under Russian fire leaving Russian forces free to encircle Ukrainian troops.

Very little is known of it, except that is probably of southern German origin. The statuette emphasises the suffering of both the Virgin and Jesus Christ.Forsyth, 177 Mary is shown in grief and mourning, holding the body of her son on her lap, as she leans over him and faces towards his crown of thorns. Christ body is emaciated, shrunken, decomposing and lacerated with the wounds of his crucifixion. Because of its small size and intimacy, the Pietà was probably not intended for a main church altar, rather for either a side altar or home altar to be viewed by those in repentance. Its stylistic characteristics, including its iconography, pathos, austerity, high reliefs and links to 13th century German mysticism texts, suggest it probably came from, or near, the Rhine Valley.Wixom, 35 Description The statuette is a variation of the stepped type, and built from poplar wood, with added plaster, paint and gilding. The back of the sculpture is hollowed out, although closed with a board. It was for a period attached to a reliquary.Forsyth, 179 This German style was adapted by French carvers, although with softer and less brutally realistic tones.Forsyth, 178 Detail showing the dead body of Christ The work shows an enthroned and sorrowful Virgin holding the lifeless body of the dead Christ. The image is realistic and grim; his ribs protrude, his stomach is sunken and he shows visible signs of rigor mortis; and he bears the bloody wounds of the Passion, with the stigmata on his hands, feet, and side.\\"Pietà (Vesperbild)\\". Metropolitan Museum of Art. Retrieved 10 March 2017 Mary's upper body is somewhat rigid, stiff and awkward, compared to the fluidity of Christ, and the lower layers of her dress. According to art historian William Forsyth, the \\"large soft folds of the Virgin's cloak around her legs and over her body clothe her with majesty befitting so august a mourner\\". The figures are carved in high relief, which can be seen especially in the deep concave folds of the dress around Mary's legs.Forsyth, 180 Detail showing the bust of the Virgin Images of the Virgin cradling the body of her son in her arms and lap are known as \\"Pietà\\", and were a popular devotional subject in the later Middle Ages from the 13th century, especially in nunneries, possibly under Byzantine influence, as a form of the Lamentation of Christ. In this version, internal harmony is achieved by Christ's limp and outstretched form, echoing the curve of the Virgin's body, which is turned slightly towards the viewer. The early German examples, such as this, are intended to evoke pity; art historian William Wixom writes that \\"the worshipers' feelings are not spared but are lacerated, as was Christ's body, inducing a state of repentance in the beholder\\". According to Wixom, Pietà statuettes such as this example were intentionally stoic and gruesome \\"designed to have a profound emphatic effect on those who said their prayers before them.\\" The scale of the work is significant in two aspects; in overall size, and in the relative size of the figures in relation to each other. The scale of the statuette's diminutive size (132.7 x 69.5 x 36.8 cm) indicates that it might have derived from a 13th-century south German mystical belief that the Virgin, in her grief, imagined Christ as an infant once again as she held his body after the crucifixion, and that his burial shroud is instead his swaddling clothes. Christ is diminutive relative to her monumental scale. This approach allows the emphasis of the work to focus on her suffering. The fourteenth century Dominican mystic, Henry Suso, in his \\"Little Book of Holy Wisdom\\", vocalised the Virgins thoughts as \\"I took my tender child (mein zartes kind) upon my lap and gazed upon him, but he was dead.\\" Saint Bernardino wrote that the Virgin is remembering of his childhood in Bethlehem, while Saint Brigid says she is looking \\"at his eyes full of blood\\". Provenance Pietà, Swabian, c. 1435-40 It was acquired by the Cloisters in 1948 using the Jacob S. Rogers fund, having previously been in the collection of the collector and art historian Lucien J. Demotte,Demotte specialised in medieval stained glass of Paris and New York. The museum has one other near contemporary example of this kind of Pietà, from Swabia, dated to c. 1435-40.\\"Pietà\\".

He is one of the pioneers of an innovative project called Dimensions in Testimony in which a life-sized interactive biography will be wheeled into classrooms, lecture halls and museums. The idea is that the audience asks questions and pre-recorded statements from the video Gutter will respond – much as if talking to the real person. Gutter has also been the subject of a number of films by directors such as Fern Levitt, Eli Rubenstein, Stephen D. Smith and Zvike Nevo. Early life After the Nazis occupied his hometown of Łódź, Gutter was sent to Warsaw along with his mother and sister to live with a relative; his father thought that it would be safer there for his family. Gutter's father eventually joined them where they lived in the Warsaw Ghetto. They survived the big deportations of 1942, but after the 1943 Warsaw Ghetto Uprising was suppressed, they were rounded up by the Germans and sent to the Majdanek extermination camp. Gutter's parents and sister were killed. Gutter himself suffered a beating by a German guard, but survived and was then sent to a nearby labor camp, where he was part of a crew that manufactured mines and ammunition for the German army. Toward the close of the war, he found himself in Buchenwald. He was subsequently transported to another labor camp in Germany and later forced on a death march to Theresienstadt in northern Bohemia, now the Czech Republic. After being liberated by the Red Army in 1945, he was sent to Britain. In 1952, he enlisted in the Israeli army. He lived in Brazil and South Africa before immigrating to Canada in 1985. Dimensions in Testimony Dimensions in Testimony is a concept developed by Heather Maio of Conscience Display, and made in a collaboration between the University of Southern California's Institute for Creative Technologies (ICT) and the University of Southern California's USC Shoah Foundation, a nonprofit established by American film director Steven Spielberg. It is a technology that enables people — now and far into the future — to have a \\"virtual conversation\\" with Holocaust survivors about their life experiences. The project integrates advanced filming techniques, specialized display technologies, and next-generation natural language processing to provide an intimate experience with Holocaust survivors who are uniquely qualified to offer personal reflections and answer direct questions about their firsthand experiences with the Holocaust. Complex algorithms dictate which responses are played back – faintly reminiscent of virtual assistants such as Apple's Siri and Microsoft's Cortana, except that while those pieces of software are primed to answer questions about emails or the weather, Dimensions in Testimony is based on communicating one person's experience of genocide. Gutter was the first person to test-drive the new technology. On three occasions, he travelled to the Los Angeles-based foundation, where he sat in a dome lit by 6,000 LED lights, surrounded by 52 cameras. The lights were so blinding he had to wear protective glasses when he wasn't being filmed. He had to wear the same clothes and sit in the same position to maintain the continuity of the project. The prototype involved filming extensive interviews with Gutter. The team at ICT then used natural language processing software to help create an interactive version of the video footage, with vocal cues triggering responses from the pool of recorded speech in the 25 hours of video footage with Gutter, who spent a total of five days sitting in the sphere. Drafting the more than 900 questions was also a challenge. Researchers had to start with the lowest level of knowledge about the Holocaust, and one day, staff brought in their own children to ask questions. Answers had to be recorded for questions that were off-topic and that were hypothetical. In testing, the software has picked out the best answer for about 90 per cent of the questions that have been asked. The project has won many plaudits including the interactive award and the audience award at the Sheffield documentary festival in 2016. The Illinois Holocaust Museum is the first Museum in the world to share the technology with the public at large. The project hopes to record ten survivors, five men and five women, who will reflect the diversity of the Holocaust experience, costing about $2 million initially and then $500,000 for each additional survivor who will be filmed. The ten testimonies from these Holocaust survivors will be unveiled by the end of 2017. Films: The Void For several years, USC Shoah Foundation Executive Director, Stephen D. Smith and Gutter developed a friendship of trust in which they explored the life that resides in Gutter's memory. He took Smith into the world of the Gerrer Hassidim of Lodz, through the Warsaw ghetto uprising, to Majdanek and Terezin, London, Paris and Jerusalem. The film probes the dark corners of Gutter's memory and discovers how vibrant, and real memory can be, but also how dark and lonely and terrifying it is too. Loss and trauma, survival and hope, pain and healing, love and hate, people and their fading shadows are all there in the void; remembered and forgotten. Films: Political, Polish Jew: The Story of Pinchas Gutter Zvike Nevo's documentary, which unfolds in chronological order from Gutter's birth in Lodz in 1932, is mostly about his survival as a Jew in Nazi-occupied Poland. Dow Marmur, rabbi emeritus at Toronto's Holy Blossom Temple said in his review in The Toronto Star that the film demonstrates that Gutter has harnessed his ordeal to the noble cause of tikun olam, the idea that Jews bear responsibility not only for their own moral, spiritual, and material welfare, but also for the welfare of society at large.  Films: The Last Goodbye  Produced by USC Shoah Foundation with Ari Palitz and Gabo Arora and producer Stephen D. Smith in 2016, The Last Goodbye is a roomscale virtual reality experience that allows viewers to travel to the Majdanek concentration camp with Pinchas as he tells them about his early experiences there. The film premiered to high acclaim at the 2017 Tribeca Film Festival and took home the VR-Documentary Jury Prize at the 2018 Lumiere Awards. In 2019, Pinchas himself dubbed the Virtual Reality film into five new languages with the intent of bringing the film to global audiences in 2020. President Obama Speech Speaking at USC Shoah Foundation's Ambassadors For Humanity Gala, President Barack Obama spoke about Pinchas Gutter saying, \\"I think of Pinchas Gutter, a man who lived through the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, and survived the Majdanek death camp... 'I tell my story,' he says, 'for the purpose of improving humanity, drop by drop by drop. Like a drop of water falls on a stone and erodes it, so, hopefully, by telling my story over and over again, I will achieve the purpose of making the world a better place to live in.' Those are the words of one survivor – performing that sacred duty of memory - that will echo throughout eternity. Those are good words for all of us to live by.\\" March of Remembrance and Hope and March of the Living thumbPinchas Gutter leading the March of Remembrance and Hope in Auschwitz- Birkenau (March of Remembrance and Hope File Photo) Pinchas Gutter has joined the annual March of Remembrance and Hope and March of the Living programs in Poland, where he takes young people on a trip to the sites of the Holocaust to make sure its legacy is never forgotten. Pinchas Gutter explained his commitment to Holocaust education in Witness: Passing the Torch of Holocaust Memory to New Generations' by author Eli Rubenstein, where he stated: \\"I always tell the young that I am carrying a torch of well-being and goodness. Despite the fact that it could have been a bitter one, I believe that Olympic torch, a torch that brings goodwill on Earth. We had a person named Moses on our trip, a survivor of the genocide in Rwanda. It was incredible how he bonded with me, by my being able to tell my stories. He wrote a letter about how it's much easier for him to accept, to live in the future because I have given him another Weltanschauung, another world view. It's very important for Holocaust survivors – or anybody else - to spread togetherness and goodwill - and i think it's the young people specifically who can create this. Because drop, by drop, by drop, like water on a stone, the world can become a better place.\\"  References  1932 births Warsaw Ghetto inmates Polish emigrants to Canada Living people ","title":"Pinchas Gutter"},{"id":"53447698","text":"Buchanan Lake Village is an unincorporated community and census-designated place in Llano County, Texas, United States.

The Detroit, Monroe and Toledo Railroad was incorporated in the state of Michigan on April 26, 1855, with headquarters in Detroit. The charter allowed for a line originating in Detroit, Michigan, passing roughly along the shoreline of Lake Erie to the small town of Monroe on the Ohio-Michigan border.

Visintini was decorated for his operations against Allied shipping in Gibraltar during the Battle of the Mediterranean. His brother Mario Visintini was a famous flying ace; both were killed during the war.  Biography  Visintini joined the Italian Naval Academy in Livorno in 1933, and received his appointment as Ensign in 1937. Initially assigned on surface ships, he participated in missions during the Spanish Civil War; he then served on the submarines Narvalo and then on Atropo. While on the latter, in April 1939, he participated in the operations for the Italian invasion of Albania.Licio Visintini on the website of the Italian Navy. On 10 June 1940, when Italy entered World War II, Visintini was serving on the submarine Torelli, and participated in its first mission in the Atlantic Ocean. On his return, he asked to be assigned to the Tenth MAS Flotilla in La Spezia, where he became assault craft operator. In 1941 he was promoted to Lieutenant and was given command of the \\"Ursa Major squadron\\", deployed against the British naval base at Gibraltar. In the night between 25 and 26 May 1941, Visintini led a first attack on Gibraltar with three SLC manned torpedoes released from the submarine Scirè (operation \\"B.G.3\\"); the raiders managed to enter the harbor, but the operation failed due to a combination of mechanical breakdowns suffered by the SLCs and sudden illnesses that seized two of the operators (moreover, Force H, the objective of the attack, had sailed just a few hours before).Giorgio Giorgerini, Attacco dal mare. Storia dei mezzi d'assalto della Marina italiana, pp. from 188 to 190. Visintini and his companions had to swim to the shore, then they returned to Italy with the help of agents from the Italian Navy intelligence service. In the night between 19 and 20 September 1941, Visintini led another attack against Gibraltar (operation \\"B.G.4\\"), again with the use of three SLC released by the Scirè. This time, the operation resulted in a success: Visintini and his partner Giovanni Magro mined and damaged the naval tanker RFA Denbydale (of 17,200 tons of displacement), which remained afloat but was considered a constructive total loss because of the severity of the damage (it was reduced to a floating fuel depot until its demolition), while the other two SLCs sank the tanker Fiona Shell and severely damaged the armed merchant Durham.Giorgio Giorgerini, Attacco dal mare. Storia dei mezzi d'assalto della Marina italiana, pp. from 194 to 201.RFA Denbydale The operators then destroyed the SLCs and swam to the coast, where they were again assisted by Italian agents who helped them to return to Italy. In the summer of 1942, when it was decided to stop using submarines for the approach of SLCs to the port of Gibraltar, instead resorting to turn the steamer Olterra, interned in Algeciras, into a secret floating base for SLCs, Visintini was tasked with directing the transformation, as well as being given command of the SLC group that would operate from the ship.Giorgio Giorgerini, Attacco dal mare. Storia dei mezzi d'assalto della Marina italiana, p. 237. At 23:15 on 7 December 1942, Visintini left Olterra for operation \\"B.G.5\\", and steered his manned torpedo towards the port of Gibraltar, with the aim of mining the battleship HMS Nelson. He and his partner, Leading Seaman Giovanni Magro, managed to overcome the external obstructions and to enter the harbor, but were both killed by the depth charges thrown by British surveillance to ward off Italian raiders. Visintini and Magro were both awarded a posthumous Gold Medal of Military Valor. Their bodies were recovered by the British and buried with full military honours. The Marina Militare named a De Cristofaro-class corvette, F 546, after him.

Background  The Trunajaya rebellion began in 1674 as rebel forces conducted raids against the cities of the Mataram Sultanate. In 1676, a rebel army of 9,000 invaded Java from their base in Madura and shortly after took Surabaya, the principal city of eastern Java. Mataram sent a much larger army to suppress them, but Trunajaya's forces routed this army at the Battle of Gegodog. The rebels continued to win victories and gain territories in the following month, taking most of the northern coast of Java as far west as Cirebon. Facing the imminent collapse of his authority, the Mataram King Amangkurat I sought help from the VOC in Batavia. On 20 January 1677, Admiral Cornelis Speelman, recently named commander of the VOC's forces in Java's north coast, arrived in Jepara to negotiate with Wangsadipara, the Mataram governor of the north coast. They agreed to a contract in February, which was ratified by the king in March. = VOC arrival off Surabaya = Cornelis Speelman, the VOC commander in Java's north coast, who led the attack on Surabaya. Portrait from 1680s when he was Governor-General of the VOC. Speelman's fleet left Jepara, anchored off Surabaya in early April and tried to start negotiations with Trunajaya. Trunajaya was initially friendly towards the VOC, but he refused to meet Speelman on board a VOC ship. The VOC's impression of Trunajaya declined after he failed to keep an appointment on neutral waters, and after emissaries reported that he was a drunkard. By the end of April, Speelman had decided to attack Surabaya over negotiations.  Battle  = Forces and terrain = Speelman had around 1,500 men under his command, including about 400 VOC troops from Jepara; the remainder had sailed with him from Batavia. The force from Batavia included 600 sailors, 310 European soldiers, and four \\"companies\\" (each about 50 strong) of Ambonese, Malays, Balinese and Mardijkers. Surabaya was defended by fortifications, artillery and a \\"substantial\\" number of men. The defenders had at least 120 cannons. Trunajaya's forces were technologically on par with those of the VOC, since VOC technical innovations had been quickly adopted in Java. Two rivers, the Kali Mas and Kali Pegirian, flowed through the city into the Madura Strait in the north. Trunajaya established his court in an old royal citadel (around the location of today's East Java Governor's office) and diverted the Kali Mas to form a moat around it. However, during the battle, the moat was dry because of the dry season during the east monsoon. Trunajaya established his main line of defence along the river north of the citadel, building elevated fortifications and palisade barriers, and emplacing two artillery batteries. The more easterly Kali Pegirian flowed through Ampel, a district of Surabaya containing the grave of Sunan Ngampel-Denta, one of the Wali Songo. In contrast to the western sector, this sector (Trunajaya's right flank) was lightly defended; only palisade barriers were built across the river. The distance from the coast to Trunajaya's main defenses, around , mostly consisted of marshy ground covered with scrub, and were underwater at high tide. = Main fighting = Dutch contemporary map, depicting Surabaya and both forces' position after the VOC forces took Ampel but before the main assault. VOC forces landed on 4–5 May on Trunajaya's right flank. Trunajaya did not expect an attack on this flank, and consequently it was only lightly defended. VOC took Ampel after little resistance. In the following days, the VOC established its battery in Ampel, simultaneously conducting desultory negotiations with Trunajaya. Trunajaya accused Speelman of being unknightly by attacking his right flank instead of his main position. Both Trunajaya and VOC moved their works forward until their artillery batteries faced each other at pistol-shot distance. Trunajaya dammed the river, the VOC's source of fresh water; afterwards, the VOC troops were limited to brackish water, and diseases soon spread. At this point, time appeared to be on Trunajaya's side, as further delay would allow him to strengthen his fortifications and reinforcements, while disease would weaken the VOC's forces. Therefore, Speelman decided to attack. On 12–13 May, the VOC delivered a heavy artillery bombardment on Trunajaya's main works, followed by an assault. The attack succeeded after hard fighting, and Trunajaya retreated inland to establish his new capital at Kediri, capital city of the ancient Kediri Kingdom. In the retreat, he left behind sixty-nine iron cannons and thirty-four bronze cannons (twenty of them small ships' cannons, bassen) and only saved twenty bronze pieces. = Follow-up = VOC forces proceeded to clear the rebels from the area surrounding Surabaya. Two VOC detachments—Indonesian companies led by Dutch captains—were sent northwest along the coast, clearing the rebels in the areas surrounding Sidayu, Tuban and the Kendeng mountains with no losses. Speelman also sent envoys, including Indian traders, to Kraeng Galesong at Pasuruan. Galesong was a former ally of Trunajaya who had quarreled with him and remained neutral during the battle in Surabaya. This negotiation failed in early May, and Galesong refused to submit even after Trunajaya's defeat in Surabaya. The VOC also tried to gain the loyalties of the lords of Madura, Trunajaya's home island across the strait from Surabaya. Several Madurese lords submitted to the admiral as the representative of the Mataram king in late May, and Speelman tried to install one of them, Raden Martapati, as a proxy. However, Martapati's authority collapsed in the face of Trunajaya loyalists as soon as his VOC escorts left Madura, and he was forced to flee to Surabaya. Subsequently, Speelman himself sailed to Madura, defeated Trunajaya's allies there, and razed his residence, Maduretna. However, in late June the court of Mataram itself fell to Trunajaya's forces, and the king fled. Upon receiving this news, Speelman decided to sail immediately to defend the strategic point of Jepara and link up with the retreating royal forces.  Aftermath  Speelman planned to follow his victory with a further advance towards the interior of Java, but his campaign was cut short by the news of the Mataram capital's fall, after which he immediately sailed to defend Jepara. Furthermore, Speelman's superiors in the VOC hesitated to continue further involvement in the war. At the time, Batavia itself was facing threats from the Banten Sultanate in West Java, and the VOC post at Malacca was threatened by the Johor Sultanate. On 6 July, the VOC ordered a halt to Speelman's operation: \\"Not one of our people, great or small, is to go to Mataram\\". Historian of Indonesia M. C. Ricklefs argued that the VOC victory in Surabaya probably accelerated the fall of Mataram. The defeated rebel forces retreated inland, driving closer to Mataram's capital and triggering an early attack on the court. Secondly, the alliance between the king and the foreign, Christian VOC strengthened the Islamic character of the rebellion. Amangkurat I's successor, Amangkurat II, later told the VOC that the alliance with the VOC pushed his cousin Pangeran Purbaya towards the rebel side, and Purbaya's forces were among those who later overran the capital. The Trunajaya rebellion continued until 1680, when it was ultimately defeated by the Mataram-VOC alliance.

History Roberts was born in the Old Fleet Market (now Farringdon Street) London, a son of Samuel Edward Roberts (c. 1790 – 20 December 1869). He was educated at the Grammar School at Tonbridge, Kent, and the City of London School, then served a seven-year apprenticeship in London as a compositor. He emigrated to South Australia aboard Symmetry, arriving in Adelaide in November 1848 after a long voyage of 147 days. His intention was to take up sheepfarming, but circumstances dictated otherwise, and he found employment as a printer. In February 1852 he joined the rush to the Victorian goldfields, where he was moderately successful and returned to Adelaide late that same year. He returned to his trade, working as a journeyman printer until June 1855, when he went into business on his own account on Currie Street, roughly opposite Leigh Street, later moved to Gawler Place; it was at this time he published The South Australian Horticulturist and Magazine of Agriculture, Botany and Natural History, edited by J. F. Wood FHS. The magazine went to at least four monthly issues. He sold up to J. T. Shawyer in March 1856, and took up farming on the River Light, near Kapunda, supplementing his income by carting copper ore with a bullock team from Burra to Gawler until 1862, when the Copper Company began employing their own teams. Roberts entered the Government service in 1863, and remained there till 1865, when he took over G. Dehane's stationery business at King William Street, opposite White's Rooms. From January 1867 he accepted the job of printing the weekly Pasquin; from June he acted also as business manager for its founder and editor E. R. Mitford. The paper was only two years old when Mitford died, and did not long outlast him; its last issue was published on New Year's Eve 1870. In mid-1872 he moved his business to 64 Hindley Street. Later that year he was proven insolvent and the whole of his printing plant was liquidated by auction. In the Northern Territory boom year 1873 to 1874 he worked as a sharebroker, before briefly returning to the Government Printing Office. He was appointed local director of the Palmerston Goldmining Company, but on arriving in Darwin found the company was in liquidation, and after tying up some loose ends returned to Adelaide. He worked briefly in the offices of The Register and The Advertiser, then in 1880 again entered the Government Printing Office, where he remained until he retired late in 1904. He died three days after passing into a coma from which he never regained consciousness. Family Samuel Edward Roberts married Ruth Wylde (c. 1833 – 4 May 1901) on 18 December 1850.

The series debuted on ITV in the UK on 2 March 2017, comprising six episodes. In June 2017, it was confirmed there would be no second series. Synopsis Set in Hackney, the series depicts a 22-year-old Jane Tennison (Stefanie Martini) as she begins her career as a WPC with the Metropolitan Police Service in 1973. At a time when women were beginning to be gradually integrated into the police force, Tennison has to deal with sexism, as well as difficulties in her home life as her family disapprove of her career choice. Under the guidance of DI Len Bradfield (Sam Reid), the naive and inexperienced Tennison assists in investigating the murder of a young runaway, Julie-Ann Collins. Meanwhile, criminal Clifford Bentley (Alun Armstrong) is released from prison and, along with other members of his family, is planning a bank heist. Links to Collins's murder threaten to expose the Bentley family's plans.

Commissioned by ITV in June 2015 under the working title Tennison, the series was set to be penned by LaPlante, who had also written the original Prime Suspect novels, and contributed to episodes of the long-running television series of the same name. The announcement of Martini as Jane Tennison, as well as further casting was announced in July 2016. In early 2016, La Plante pulled out of the project. Vera and Home Fires writer Glen Laker was drafted in to write the series. = Filming = Filming began in July 2016 in London. = Cancellation = In June 2017, ITV confirmed that the series had not been recommissioned, despite high ratings for the first series. The cause is reported to be creative differences between author Lynda LaPlante and ITV.  Broadcast  Prime Suspect 1973 first aired on 2 March 2017 on ITV. Internationally, broadcast under the title Prime Suspect: Tennison, the series premiered in South Africa on 6 April 2017 on ITV Choice. The series premiered in the United States on 25 June 2017 on Masterpiece Mystery on PBS, airing over three 90-minute instalments. In Australia, the series is set to be broadcast on ABC on 21 July 2017, under its original title.  Reception  The series received mixed reviews from critics, achieving a 50% approval rating based on 12 reviews as aggregated on Rotten Tomatoes. Critics praised Stefanie Martini's performance and the period detail, in particular. Upon its broadcast in the United States, the Washington Post recommended it as \\"one of the best shows you’ll find on TV this summer\\", while the Los Angeles Times said that \\"Tennison does not quite measure up to Prime Suspect.\\" In contrast, Salon considered it fortunate that the series was forced into early retirement, and noted that this Tennison prequel failed to focus on Tennison's character development with the same intensity as the \\"provocative... classic\\" sequel did with Helen Mirren's character.

Throughout the years, the 65th Brigade Engineer Battalion (65th BEB) has undergone several reorganizations and has participated in World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and Operation Enduring Freedom. Consisting of two engineer companies, an intelligence company, a signal company, and a headquarters company, the 65th BEB is currently assigned to the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division (\\"Warriors\\") based out of Schofield Barracks, Hawaii. They typically conduct operations within the Asia-Pacific region under the command of United States Pacific Command (USPACOM).  Mission  65th BEB is capable of deploying scalable, combat multiplier capabilities within 72 hours to enable 2/25 IBCT during Unified Land Operations and support emerging requirements and contingencies that deter conflict within the USPACOM AOR.  History  = Lineage = The 65th Brigade Engineer Battalion was first constituted into the Regular Army as the 65th Engineer Battalion on 18 October 1927. The unit was inactive and remained inactive for 14 years. On 1 October 1941, the Hawaiian Division was split into the 24th and 25th Infantry divisions. The 65th Engineer Battalion was assigned to the 25th Infantry Division (25th ID), and was activated. Soon after, the Japanese launched their attack on Pearl Harbor, and the 65th was called to service during World War II. On 1 January 1944, the 65th was reorganized, designated as the 65th Engineer Combat Battalion. After the war, it deployed to Japan to assist in occupation duties for the next five years. The battalion was then engaged in the Korean War during 1950–1954. In 1954, the unit finally returned home to Schofield Barracks after more than 12 years overseas. On 1 March 1954, the battalion was reorganized and once again designated as the 65th Engineer Battalion. In 1965, the battalion deployed to the Republic of Vietnam and did not redeploy home until 8 December 1970. On 15 August 2005, the unit laid down its colors, and was inactivated and reorganized as a Special Troops Battalion under the 3rd Brigade Combat Team. The 65th was reactivated on 16 July 2007 and assigned to the 8th Military Police Brigade, 8th Theater Sustainment Command as a combat effects battalion. In June 2008, they were then assigned to the 130th Engineer Brigade, 8th Theater Sustainment Command. With the 130th, the unit deployed to Northern Iraq as well as Afghanistan. When they returned to Schofield Barracks, they were assigned to the 2nd Stryker Brigade Combat Team (2SBCT), 25th Infantry Division and designated as a brigade engineer battalion on 16 October 2014. In spring 2016, the 2nd Stryker Brigade Combat Team was relieved of its strykers and organized into its current status as a (light) infantry brigade combat team. = World War II = The 65th Brigade Engineer Battalion's first mission was to improve defenses in Oahu. Their main areas of concern were the beaches and trails in the southern region. They first saw action on 7 December 1941 during the attack on Pearl Harbor. They were then swiftly deployed to Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands to participate in the Guadalcanal Campaign. Charlie Company, 65th Brigade Engineer Battalion used coconut trees to construct a Corduroy Road in New Georgia during World War II. The road is capable of supporting 155 mm howitzers. The Japanese held strong defensive fortifications on Mount Austen as well as on two nearby ridges: Seahorse and Galloping Horse. Offensive operations to capture the three locations began on 7 January 1943. Despite the fact that the 65th Engineer Battalion was poorly equipped, they aided in the seizure of the key terrain by opening roads and maintaining lines of communication. They also opened up supply routes to the interior by dredging the Matanikau River allowing free movement for boats. In January 1943 XIV Corps went on the offensive. As XIV Corps moved into the Northern Solomons, New Georgia, Vella LaVella, Sasavele, and Kolombangara, the 65th Engineer Battalion continued to support freedom of maneuver and facilitate resupply routes by improving roads and trails and building bridges and fording sites. On 11 January 1945, the 65th landed on Luzon in continued support of the 25th ID who was then assigned to the Sixth Army. The unit faced continuous fierce ground combat and was removed on 30 June 1945. At the end of WWII, the 65th Engineer Battalion received 4 campaign streamers: Central Pacific, Guadalcanal, Northern Solomons, and Luzon. Alpha, Bravo, and Charlie Companies each also earned a Presidential Unit Citation for Gallantry on Luzon. The 65th was then deployed to Japan with the 25th ID in order to assist in occupation duties. = Korean War = In 1950, the 65th deployed straight from Japan to the Republic of Korea. During the Korean War, the unit conducted similar missions as they had in World War II. Their duties consisted of mine/booby trap clearing, obstacle reducing/building, road and trail improvements, and bridge building. A soldier from the 77th Engineer Company, as a part of the 65th BEB, prepares to remove a mine with a shovel on 15 September 1950. They assisted the 25th ID throughout the entirety of the war, participating in all ten campaigns: UN Defensive, UN Offensive, CCF Intervention, First UN Counteroffensive, CCF Spring Offensive, UN Summer-Fall Offensive, Second Korean Winter, Korea Summer-Fall 1952, Third Korean Winter, and Korea Summer 1953. In addition to the battalion receiving streamers for campaign participation, Alpha, Bravo, and Charlie Companies also received Presidential Unit Citations. Alpha Company received the award for assisting the 27th Infantry Regiment (\\"Wolfhounds\\") in defending the Pusan Perimeter. Bravo Company earned it while aiding the 35th Infantry Regiment in their stand at the Nam River. Charlie Company obtained the citation for supporting the 25th ID's combat operations near Taegu. The battalion also received a Meritorious Unit Commendation and two Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citations. By the time the 65th returned home to Schofield Barracks from participating in WWII and the Korean War, they had spent 800 days in direct support of combat operations and 12 years overseas. = Vietnam War and the post-Cold War era= The 65th was deployed to Vietnam in 1965 and spent six years supporting the 25th Infantry Division. One of the main assignments during the Vietnam War was jungle clearing operations near Cu Chi, Dau Tieng and Tay Ninh 25th Division basecamps. During this time it gained 12 campaign credits before returning to the United States in 1971, arriving at Oahu, Hawaii. Between 1972 and 1986 the unit served as a divisional engineer unit, before being converted into a light engineering battalion. In 2002, the battalion deployed 80 personnel to Bosnia in support of the 25th Infantry Division. After this, it was inactivated in 2005 as the 25th Infantry Division was reorganized along modular lines. The battalion was reactivated as part of the 130th Engineer Brigade in Hawaii in 2008. With this formation, the unit deployed to both Iraq and Afghanistan under Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom.  Organization  The unit consists of six companies: Headquarters & Headquarters Company (\\"Renegades\\"), Alpha Company (\\"Sappers\\"), Bravo Company (\\"Beast\\"), Charlie Company (\\"Charge\\"), Delta Company (\\"Daggers\\"), and Echo Company (\\"Phoenix\\").

For most of the war it followed a very similar combat path to that of the 332nd Rifle Division, sometimes serving on adjacent sectors. It fought in the Battle of Moscow and during the winter counteroffensive was assigned to 4th Shock Army, where it would remain until November 1943. During this offensive it helped carve out the Toropets Salient, where it would remain until the autumn of 1943 when it helped to liberate Velizh and began advancing westward again. In the first days of the 1944 summer offensive the 334th shared credit with several other units in the liberation of Vitebsk and was awarded that name as an honorific. The unit advanced into East Prussia in January 1945, distinguishing itself in the siege of the heavily-fortified city of Königsberg and the clearing of the Baltic coast. It continued to serve briefly into the postwar period. Formation The division began forming at Kazan in the Volga Military District in August 1941.Walter S. Dunn, Jr., Stalin's Keys to Victory, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2006, p. 79 Its order of battle was as follows: * 1122nd Rifle Regiment * 1124th Rifle Regiment * 1126th Rifle Regiment * 908th Artillery Regiment * 477th Sapper Battalion * 407th Reconnaissance CompanyCharles C. Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed From June to December 1941, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. IX, Nafziger, 1996, p. 80 * 280th Antitank Battalion * 796th Signal Battalion On September 16 Colonel N.M. Mishchenko was appointed to command the division, a position he would hold until May 9, 1944, a remarkably long term of service in the early part of the war. Mishchenko was promoted to Major General in May 1942. His division was moved to Gorkii in the Moscow Military District in late October to complete its training and equipping, and variously assigned to several reserve armies that were forming in the Moscow District at that time. Combat service In December the 334th was moved north by rail and assigned to the newly formed 4th Shock Army in Northwestern Front.Dunn, Jr., Stalin's Keys, p. 79 When 4th Shock attacked in January 1942, the division reported a strength of 12,000 officers and men armed with 167 mortars, 14 HMGs, 347 LMGs, and 80 antitank rifles. During training, each rifle regiment had organized \\"assault\\" submachine-gun companies from Communist Party members and Komsomols younger men with high morale, if not more training and experience. The German forces in this sector were badly overextended and under-supplied, and the 334th helped 4th Shock, and its running mate, 3rd Shock Army, drive deep into the left flank of Army Group Center, liberating Toropets and advancing almost to Velikiye Luki before finally running out of steam. By February - March 1942, while fighting north of Velizh, the division had collected enough trophy German 105mm light howitzers and ammunition to form a battery of these guns in the 908th Artillery Regiment.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 80 4th Shock would remain in this general area, just north and west of Velizh, until November 1943, in Kalinin Front. Had Operation Mars in November 1942, fared better, the 334th would likely have taken part in an operation code-named either Jupiter or Neptune to destroy all of Army Group Center east of Smolensk.David M. Glantz, After Stalingrad, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2009, pp. 41-42, 473 During the Dukhovshchina–Demidov Offensive from September 20 to October 2, 1943, Kalinin Front would finally liberate Smolensk, and 4th Shock took Velizh, advancing nearly to Surazh by the end of the offensive. At this time the 334th was a separate division in the Army, not part of any corps. Before this operation ended the Front commander, Gen. Andrey Yeryomenko, began planning two additional thrusts, one by 3rd Shock Army and most of 4th Shock in the direction of Nevel, and another by the rest of his forces towards Vitebsk, which was seen by both sides as the gateway to the Baltic states. The assault on Nevel, beginning on October 6, was a surprising success, while the attack towards Vitebsk, which began three days earlier, was the first of many frustrating failures along this axis over the next seven months. The 334th was deployed in a support role on the right flank of 92nd Rifle Corps, facing the German 87th Infantry Division. After heavy fighting over nine days, the German forces were pulled back to new lines in the Gorodok region, and after following up, the 4th Shock units had to pause for their own regrouping and replenishment. On October 16 an order from STAVKA shut this offensive down.Glantz, Battle for Belorussia, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2016, pp. 26, 32-33, 43, 48-50 In late November, the division was transferred to the 43rd Army in the 1st Baltic Front (former Kalinin Front), and it remained under those commands until August 1944.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", pp. 80-81 A new offensive towards Vitebsk began on December 23. By this time the 334th was in 92nd Rifle Corps, alongside the 332nd. On the second day, the division, along with the 358th of the same Corps, succeeded in biting a chunk out of German 14th Infantry Division's defenses north of the Surazh - Vitebsk road. This pressure helped to compel the Germans to withdraw their LIII Corps to new defenses even closer to the city. Despite these marginal successes, and others, the offensive was shut down on January 5, 1944, due to excessive losses.Glantz, Belorussia, pp. 279, 284, 296-97 During that month the 334th was reassigned to 60th Rifle Corps, in the same Army, and it would remain in this Corps for the duration, while being reassigned to several other armies.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 81 In early March yet another attempt was made to advance against the German positions north and east of Vitebsk. The German VI Army Corps withdrew once again to shorter lines, followed by the 334th and its Corps, which ran up against 4th German Air Force Field Division in the vicinity of Losvida and Savchenki, only to suffer a sharp rebuff. By March 5 the offensive was once again shut down.Glantz, Belorussia, pp. 379-80 At the start of Operation Bagration, on June 22, the 334th and its Corps were part of the assault forces of 43rd Army. Following a very heavy artillery barrage and air attacks, 60 Corps had passed through both the first and second German defense lines and reached the Obol River. By the evening of June 23, 60th Corps was pressing remnants of German Corps Detachment D south towards the Dvina River west of Vitebsk. On the following day several bridgeheads were taken, and crossing operations began on both sides of Beshenkovichi. Overnight on June 25/26 60th Corps met the 19th Guards Rifle Division of 39th Army at Gnezdilovichi, closing the ring, and through the day forces of both armies cleared Vitebsk.Dunn, Jr., Soviet Blitzkrieg, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2008, pp. 95, 102, 104, 129 On the same date the division was recognized for its role in liberating the city, towards which the Red Army had struggled for so many months, and was given that name as an honorific:Following this victory the division joined in the pursuit of the broken remnants of Army Group Center, and by the second week in July had nearly reached the Lithuanian border just east of Švenčionys. Over the following months the advance slowed, and by August 1 the division found itself in the vicinity of Kupiškis, moving in the direction of Riga. Two weeks later it had reached Pasvalys, and shortly thereafter was transferred, along with the rest of 60 Corps, to 51st Army. By mid-September the 334th had crossed into Latvia at Eleja, but made little further progress over the next six weeks.Baltic Gap, Multi-Man Publishing, Inc., Millersville, MD, 2009, pp. 14, 21, 27-28, 35 In the last months of the year the division was briefly reassigned back to 4th Shock Army, then to 61st Army. Operations in 1945 On January 4, 1945, Guards Colonel E.Ya. Birstein was given command of the division, which he would hold for the duration. At about the same time the 334th made its final transfer, to 2nd Guards Army in 3rd Belorussian Front, still in 60th Rifle Corps. Under these commands it took part in the Vistula-Oder Offensive. When the offensive was launched, 60th Rifle Corps was assigned to defend along a broad front to the north of Goldap while the remainder of 2nd Guards Army followed 28th Army's breakthrough of the German lines; the 334th and its Corps followed in second echelon. In the second half of March, in the lead-up to the assault on Königsberg, 60th Corps advanced along a route from Preussisch Eylau to Domnau, Tapiau, and Granz. On April 5 the division was awarded the Order of Suvorov, 2nd Class, in recognition of its role in the capture of Bartenstein and Landsberg. During the assault on Königsberg on April 7, the division assisted in forcing the Tierenberger River and reached the area north of Norgau. Once the city fell, the 334th took part in the clearing of the Samland Peninsula beginning on April 13.Soviet General Staff, Prelude to Berlin, ed. and trans. Richard W. Harrison, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2016, pp. 124, 251, 264, 267 Postwar When the fighting stopped, the men and women of the division had earned the full title of 334th Rifle, Vitebsk, Order of Suvorov Division (Russian: 334-я стрелковая Витебская ордена Суворова дивизия), and 15 men had been named Heroes of the Soviet Union. The division was withdrawn to the Smolensk Military District with the 60th Rifle Corps, where it was disbanded in November 1945 along with the rest of the corps.

Bowie and Turpin managed to get Ewing into foul trouble early, and with him on the bench and Reggie Williams shooting only 1-for-7 (14.3%) from the field during the game, the Wildcats raced out to a 27-15 lead with 3:06 left in the first half. After that however, the Hoyas made a defensive stand still unequalled in college basketball: Kentucky scored only two more points in the first half; the Wildcats also did not score in the first 9 minutes 55 seconds of the second half, missing their first 12 shots and after that shooting 3-for-21 (14.3%) during the remainder of the game.

Late in the game, with Georgetown enjoying a comfortable lead, Thompson began to pull starters out and give bench players some time on the court; the game's enduring image came when senior guard Fred Brown came out of the game. Two years earlier at the same stage in New Orleans against North Carolina, after Michael Jordan had given the Tar Heels the lead, Brown had mistakenly passed the ball to James Worthy with less than 15 seconds to go, ruining Georgetowns chances for a final game-winning shot and allowing North Carolina to take the national championship, and cameras had captured Thompson consoling a devastated Brown with a hug as the Tar Heels celebrated. As Brown left the 1984 championship game, cameras caught Brown and Thompson again embracing on the sideline, this time to celebrate a victory.The Georgetown Basketball History Project: the Top 100: 48.

Location  The Japurá- Solimoes-Negro moist forests ecoregion is named for the Japurá, Solimões, and Negro rivers. Almost all of the ecoregion is in the central northern part of the Brazilian Amazon basin, with a small portion in Colombia. It has an area of . Conservation units include the Jaú National Park and the Mamirauá Sustainable Development Reserve. The ecoregion lies on the lowland plateau in the interfluvial between the Rio Negro and the Solimões River. In Colombia the region skirts the foothills of the Guiana Shield to the northwest, and contains the lower Vaupés River basin and the land south of the Guainía River, the name of the upper Rio Negro in Colombia. The region is then bounded by the Rio Negro along the border with Venezuela and into Brazil to its confluence with the Solimões at Manaus. The southern border is defined by the Japurá River from the border with Colombia to the point where it meets the Solimões at Tefé, then by the Solimões to the Rio Negro. To the west the Japurá- Solimoes-Negro moist forests adjoin the Caqueta moist forests, and to the north the Negro-Branco moist forests. To the east it adjoins the Uatuma- Trombetas moist forests. To the south it adjoins the Monte Alegre várzea, the Purus várzea and the Solimões-Japurá moist forests. The ecoregion contains large areas of the distinct campinarana ecoregion, which has white sand soils that are periodically subject to shallow flooding, and hold broad-leaf meadows, dwarf shrubs and shrublands.  Physical  = Terrain = The lowland plateau that holds the Japurá-Solimoes-Negro moist forests ecoregion emerged as soft sediments about 2.5 million years ago. The terrain is mainly non-flooded terra firme on wide plains cut by steep-sided valleys of tributaries of the larger rivers. The region has elevations that are mostly well below , dropping to at Manaus. = Hydrology = The Japurá and Solimões are whitewater rivers, carrying large amounts of suspended solids, while the Rio Negro and most of the smaller rivers in the region are blackwater rivers. Each year heavy rainfall within the ecoregion and higher up in the Andes causes flooding along the banks of all the larger rivers and many of the smaller rivers. Near Tefé and Manaus the flood water may rise . Floooding lasts for one or two months on the upper reaches of the smaller rivers, but may extend for as much as ten months near Manaus. The wide floodplains of the Japurá and Solimões rivers hold the Várzea forests of the Purus Várzea ecoregion. The blackwater Rio Negro and rivers of the interior of the ecoregion flood Igapó forests, with lower diversity of tree species and less fertile soil. = Climate = The Japurá-Solimoes-Negro moist forests ecoregion has a hot and humid climate with average monthly temperature from . Average annual rainfall is , with a well-defined rainy season.  Ecology  = Flora = The Japurá-Solimoes-Negro moist forests ecoregion has medium endemism, but the holds many rare or endangered flora. The ecoregion is in the Neotropical realm and the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests biome. There are many rivers and flooded areas, but the most of the vegetation is terra firme forest, not subject to flooding. The ecoregion is part of the Río Negro-Juruá Moist Forests, a global ecoregion, the other parts being the Negro-Branco, Solimões-Japurá and Caqueta moist forests. The reasonably intact global ecoregion has high annual rainfall, diverse soils and varied terrain, resulting in a high level of biodiversity. It has not been studied in great depth by scientists. Most of the Japurá-Solimoes-Negro moist forests ecoregion is covered by terra firme forests growing on poor soil. These forests typically have a canopy, either open or closed with emergent trees up to . Common families of trees are Fabaceae, Sapotaceae, Rubiaceae, Chrysobalanaceae, Lauraceae and Annonaceae. There are many palms in the understory and canopy of the different types of forest. In the terra firme areas the most common palms are miriti and carana in the genus Mauritia. Other terra firme trees include Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa), sucupira (Bowdichia virgilioides) and rubber (Hevea spruceana). Trees in igapó forests along the Jaú River in the west include Elvasia calophylla, Swartzia laevicarpa, Pouteria elegans, Aldina latifolia, Swartzia polyphylla, Ouratea hexasperma, Mollia speciosa, Leopoldiana pulchra, Inga puntata and Heterostemon mimosoides. Trees along the Tarumã Mirim River to the east include Vismia amazonica, Unonopsis guatterioides, Pentaclethra macroloba, Macrolobium suaveolens, Eschweilera parvifolia, Caraipa grandiflora, Aspidosperma nitidum and Mabea nitida. Timber trees on the upper margins of the várzea include Ceiba pentandra, Manilkara amazonica, and Virola surinamensis. = Fauna = The Japurá-Solimoes-Negro moist forests contain diverse fauna. 181 species of mammals have been recorded, including South American tapir (Tapirus terrestris), capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris), jaguar (Panthera onca), collared peccary (Pecari tajacu), red-faced spider monkey (Ateles paniscus), red-handed tamarin (Saguinus midas), common squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus), and several gracile capuchin monkeys (Cebus species). There are many small rodents, anteaters, opossums, and over 100 bat species. 506 species of birds have been reported. Common birds include macaws (Ara species), cattle egret (Bubulcus ibis), herons of the Egretta and Ardea genera, tinamous (Crypturellus species) and parrots (Amazona and Piona species). There are many species of reptiles and amphibians, including the omnipresent green iguana (Iguana iguana) and tegus lizards (Tupinambis species). Snakes include boa constrictor (Boa constrictor) and the venomous fer-de-lance (Bothrops asper), palm pit-vipers (Bothriechis species), coral snakes (Micrurus species) and bushmasters (Lachesis muta). The rivers are home to fish of all sizes, turtles, Amazon river dolphin (Inia geoffrensis), and Amazonian manatee (Trichechus inunguis). = Status = The region holds the south half of the Puinawai Natural Reserve in Colombia. Protected areas in Brazil include the Mamirauá Sustainable Development Reserve in the Purus Várzea ecoregion, the Amanã Sustainable Development Reserve and the Jaú National Park. The forest is largely undisturbed and relatively stable, but there are high levels of mining, logging, agriculture, hunting and fishing along the rivers. There are no roads in the region except for very close to Manaus, but the rivers carry much boat traffic. Urban development in the Manaus region causes deforestation and pollution. In the border region between Colombia and Brazil large stretches of river bank are being destroyed by gold miners. There is unregulated logging of timber along the river banks.

He served on the Montreal city council from 2005 to 2013, initially as a member of the Montreal Island Citizens Union (MICU)/Union Montreal (UM) party and later as an independent. From 2012 to 2013, he was a member of the Montreal executive committee (i.e., the municipal cabinet). At an earlier time in his life, he held a leading position in the New Democratic Party in Quebec and was a candidate for the House of Commons of Canada. Private career Tassé's 2013 campaign literature identified him as the owner of a property management firm specializing in the oversight of non-profit housing.Pierre Boulanger, \\"Alain Tassé, candidat de la Coalition Montréal\\", Le Messager Verdun, 22 October 2013, accessed 13 March 2017. New Democratic Party activist Tassé was a candidate for the Canadian House of Commons in the 1988 Canadian federal election, running for the New Democratic Party in Verdun—Saint-Paul. He finished third against Progressive Conservative Gilbert Chartrand. The New Democratic Party experienced serious internal divisions in 1989 over the nature and extent of its support for the proposed Meech Lake Accord on constitutional reform. In December 1989, delegates at the party's convention voted to seek improvements to the accord via a series of amendments. This decision was opposed by many Quebec delegates, particularly those who identified as Quebec nationalists and who opposed any changes to the original text. Tassé was among those opposing the decision; he was quoted as saying, \\"I'm a socialist before I'm a nationalist, but I remain a (Quebec) nationalist.\\"Graham Fraser and Alan Freeman, \\"NDP CHOOSES A LEADER Delegates avoid splitting party, vote to improve, change Meech,\\" Globe and Mail, 2 December 1989, A10. Tassé was chosen as interim president of the federal wing of the New Democratic Party in Quebec in June 1990.\\"NDP Quebec wing picks new chief,\\" Montreal Gazette, 19 June 1990, A3. The provincial wing of the Quebec NDP had broken away from the federal party the previous year, largely due to divisions over Quebec sovereignty. See Peter Kuitenbrouwer, \\"Quebec NDP splits from federal party,\\" Montreal Gazette, 1 May 1989, A1. A newspaper report from March 1991 described Tassé as continuing to hold the office of president. He stood down from the position in early 1991 and became special assistant on Quebec issues to federal party leader Audrey McLaughlin, a position he continued to hold through to the 1993 Canadian federal election.Edison Stewart, \\"PM eyes meeting with opposition on unity stand, Toronto Star, 5 April 1991, A13.Andy Riga, \\"Want to meet Charest? It will only cost you $500,\\" Montreal Gazette, 9 October 1993, A12. In June 1991, he was involved in developing a compromise resolution on constitutional reform intended to win support for the party in both Quebec and Western Canada.Geoffrey York, \\"NDP tries to placate Quebec and West,\\" Globe and Mail, 7 June 1991, A1. Municipal politician Tassé unsuccessfully sought election to the Verdun city council in 1985, running as a candidate of the Parti contre l'annexion de Verdun (Verdun Anti-Annexation Party), which opposed a proposed merger of Verdun with Montreal.Daniel Kucharsky, \\"Verdun voters reject annexation backers,\\" Montreal Gazette, 5 November 1985, A1. See also Ingrid Peritz & Daniel Kurcharsky, \\"Montreal wants talks on Nun's Island,\\" Montreal Gazette, 5 November 1985, A5. He was elected in the 1993 municipal election as a member of Georges Bossé's Parti d'action municipale (Municipal Action Party) and served for the next four years. He sought re-election in 1997 but was defeated.\\"Results from races for mayor, council,\\" Montreal Gazette, 3 November 1997, A6. Verdun was subsequently annexed to Montreal on January 1, 2002, and Tassé was elected to the Montreal city council in 2005, winning in the Desmarchais-Crawford division in that year's municipal election. The Montreal Island Citizens Union won a majority on council, and Tassé served as a backbench supporter of Gérald Tremblay administration. He was re-elected in the 2009 election, which was won by Tremblay's renamed Union Montreal party. Following this election, Tassé served on the city's task force dealing with bedbug infestations\\"Pack tight, don't let the bedbugs bite; Tip: Avoid picking up furniture from the curb, even if it looks good,\\" Montreal Gazette, 29 June 2011, A6. and oversaw the establishment of an open-data portal for municipal information.Roberto Rocha, \\"City makes data available on Web,\\" Montreal Gazette, 28 October 2011, A6. The Union Montreal party fell into crisis in late 2012, after serious allegations of corruption were made about the party at the Charbonneau Commission. Tassé was one of the first councillors to resign from the party following these revelations, serving as an independent on council as of November 2012.Max Harrold & Lynn Moore, \\"One thing's clear at city hall: It's confusing; As Union Montreal loses its majority, candidates and parties jockey for position,\\" Montreal Gazette, 15 November 2012, A4. Following Tremblay's resignation as mayor, city council voted to choose a replacement, and Tassé supported Michael Applebaum's successful bid for the position.Sidharta Banerjee, \\"After 100 years, could Montreal get Anglo mayor? Mais 'oui,' says one candidate,\\" Canadian Press, 14 November 2012. On November 22, 2012, Applebaum named Tassé to his executive committee with responsibility for economic development and urbanization.René Bruemmer, \\"Applebaum delivers promised mix; Executive committee introduced; Vision gets three seats, Union three, Projet two, plus three independents,\\" Montreal Gazette, 23 November 2012, A4. He retained these responsibilities when Laurent Blanchard succeeded Applebaum as mayor on June 25, 2013, and also gained responsibility for the oversight of water.Tracey Ariel, \\"Verdun Candidate for Mayor: Alain Tassé\\", newscoverage.org, 17 October 2013, accessed 10 March 2013. In January 2013, Tassé announced the beginning of a long-term renewal plan for a derelict area in the northern section of Montreal's Parc Avenue. He indicated that the plan was to turn a former \\"no man's land\\" area into a mixed-use neighbourhood, with some continued industrial and commercial presence.René Bruemmer, \\"New look proposed for Parc Ave.; Development plans to put homes, offices, commercial space in former industrial area,\\" Montreal Gazette, 18 January 2013, A4. He also defended the city's decision to authorize condominium towers in Griffintown without public consultation, saying that the buildings would be an improvement over what had been there previously.Marian Scott, \\"Citizens key to shaping city,\\" Montreal Gazette, 16 March 2013, B1. Tassé speculated that he might contest the 2013 municipal election as part of a group of independents in Verdun,Linda Gyulai, \\"Clock ticking and few mayoral candidates; Corruption scandal blamed for lack of interest in race,\\" Montreal Gazette, 2 April 2013, A4. but he ultimately supported Marcel Côté's bid for mayor and joined the Coalition Montréal party.René Bruemmer, \\"Marcel Côté throws his hat in the ring; Vows to 'bring together all the elements' of city,\\" Montreal Gazette, 4 July 2013, A3. Under this party's banner, he ran for borough mayor of Verdun and finished fourth against Jean-François Parenteau of Équipe Denis Coderre pour Montréal.

It is approximately long and flows through Lower Saucon Township and Hellertown. The watershed of the creek has an area of . The creek is a very small stream that is urban in its lower reaches. However, it is not designated as an impaired waterbody and is inhabited by trout. The creek has been a major source of flooding in Hellertown. Course Silver Creek begins to the east of a hill known as Swoveberg. It flows north- northwest and then turns west for several tenths of a mile, heading into a valley between Swoveberg, Kirchberg, and Focht Hill. Here, the creek flows west-southwest for more than a mile before turning west-northwest for a few tenths of a mile and reaching the border of Hellertown. It flows north along the border for a short distance before turning west into Hellertown. The creek then flows southwest and west-southwest for several tenths of a mile before crossing Pennsylvania Route 412 and reaching its confluence with Saucon Creek after a few tenths of a mile. Silver Creek joins Saucon Creek upstream of its mouth. Hydrology Silver Creek is not designated as an impaired waterbody. At the downstream border of Hellertown, the peak annual discharge of Silver Creek has a 10 percent chance of reaching . It has a 2 percent chance of reaching and a 1 percent chance of reaching . The peak annual discharge has a 0.2 percent chance of reaching . In November 1955, the discharge of Silver Creek at Hellertown was measured to be . In October, 1968, it was measured to be only . Geography and geology The elevation near the mouth of Silver Creek is above sea level. The elevation near the source of the creek is between above sea level. The creek is a very small stream that is an urban stream flowing through Hellertown in its lower reaches. In 2000, it was observed that many tires and broken soda bottles littered the creek. Hardyston Quartzite is present in the valley of Silver Creek and ranges from white chert to arkosic quartzite and is rich in pyrite in this area. Gneiss is also present in the valley. Signs of faulting in the valley include springs and an unusually shaped window of gneiss. Jasper and small, weathered crystals of quartz can be found in Silver Creek throughout its length. Silver Creek is described as a \\"clear attractive stream\\" in Benjamin LeRoy Miller's 1939 book Northampton County, Pennsylvania: Geology and Geography. The headwaters of Silver Creek are in the Wassergass. The Heller homestead is located near its mouth. Watershed The watershed of Silver Creek has an area of . The creek is entirely within the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Hellertown. The watershed of Silver Creek is mostly in Lower Saucon Township, but its lower reaches are in Hellertown. The watershed borders those of East Branch Saucon Creek and Polk Valley Run. Silver Creek is a major source of flooding in Hellertown. It has impacted the community during flooding in September, 2004, as well as during two heavy storms in 2005. The creek was in fact the primary source of flooding in Hellertown during the 2004 flood. History and recreation Silver Creek was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1187669. Historically, there were iron mines in the valley of Silver Creek. In the late 19th century, people would commonly picnic at Silver Creek and explore a nearby cave. One reach of the creek flows through a private golf course. A concrete stringer/multi-beam or girder bridge carrying Northampton Street was built over Silver Creek in 1920. Another bridge of the same type, but carrying Front Street, was built over the creek in 1937. A concrete slab bridge carrying Harris Street was constructed across the creek in 1954 and reconstructed in 2013. Another concrete slab bridge was built over the creek in 1960, carrying Rentzheimer Drive. In 1964, a concrete slab bridge carrying Reservoir Road was built over the creek in Hellertown. A covered bridge was also built over the creek outside of Hellertown at some point. Biology Wild trout naturally reproduce in Silver Creek from its headwaters downstream to its mouth. According to Trout Unlimited's Guide to Pennsylvania Limestone Streams, it is barely large enough to support trout, and none were observed when the author visited. In 2006, the reach of Silver Creek that flows through Hellertown was identified as one of the areas in the Saucon Creek watershed that is most in need of habitat restoration.

It determined the national champion for the 1982–83 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The game was played on April 4, 1983, at The Pit in Albuquerque, New Mexico and paired top-ranked, #1 seed Midwest Regional Champions, the Houston Cougars, and sixteenth-ranked, #6 seed West Regional Champions, the NC State Wolfpack. The first half of the national championship game favored NC State. Not only did the Wolfpack lead 33–25, but Houston's Clyde Drexler picked up four first- half fouls. The Cougars opened the second half with a dominating 17–2 run to seize a seven-point lead, 42–35. NC State was able to keep the game close, as Houston's star center Akeem Olajuwon checked out of the game multiple times to receive oxygen, leading the Cougars to slow the pace of the game in order to protect the lead. Tied at 52 with 44 seconds remaining, NC State held the ball for a final shot attempt. Houston narrowly missed stealing the ball as the clock ticked down. After gathering the ball nearly 30 feet from the basket, Dereck Whittenburg launched a desperation shot that fell short of the rim. Olajuwon hesitated in fear of a goaltending call, allowing Lorenzo Charles to catch the ball and dunk it for the 54–52 victory. One of the indelible images in tournament history is of winning coach Jim Valvano running onto the court after the game ended looking for Whittenburg. NC State's magical, improbable postseason run and national championship win, highlighted by Charles' game- winning dunk, remain a legendary representation of March Madness. Participants =NC State= Despite a preseason ranking of #16 in the AP poll, the Wolfpack sputtered to a 9–7 record after losing at Maryland on January 29. Three close victories in the ACC Tournament saved NC State from missing the NCAA Tournament altogether. Three of the team's four victories on the road to the Final Four came by one or two points. The Wolfpack trailed with a minute or less to play in six of their eight postseason games before this game. *West **NC State (6) 69, Pepperdine (11) 67 **NC State 71, UNLV (3) 70 **NC State 75, Utah (10) 56 **NC State 63, Virginia (1) 62 *Final Four **NC State 67, Georgia (4) 60 =Houston= Houston was ranked #14 in the AP poll to open the season, and fell to 5–2 after a 72–63 loss to #1 Virginia in Tokyo on December 16, 1982. The Cougars then ran off a 26-game winning streak, capturing the #1 ranking in the process, that was capped by a 94–81 victory over #2 Louisville to advance to the National Championship Game. *Midwest **Houston (1) 60, Maryland (8) 50 **Houston 70, Memphis (4) 63 **Houston 89, Villanova (3) 71 *Final Four **Houston 94, Louisville (1) 81 Game summary NC State led at halftime by a score of 33–25. Houston was hampered by foul trouble that plagued star Clyde Drexler, who picked up four first half fouls. In the second half, the Cougars came out with a second wind and established control of the game, eventually taking a seven-point lead. Since the game was played in Albuquerque, players had to deal with the city's mile-high altitude. The Cougars' star center, Akeem Olajuwon, had problems adjusting to the environment and tired quickly, needing to check out of the game multiple times so he could put on an oxygen mask and recover. With Olajuwon on the bench, Houston head coach Guy Lewis decided that in order to protect the lead and Olajuwon's health at the same time, the Cougars slowed the game down. This enabled the Wolfpack to return to their standby strategy of extending the game. Houston's free throw shooting was very suspect entering the game (60.9% on the season), which worked greatly in NC State's favor as they were able to rally back and even the score at 52 in the final two minutes. On what would be the last Houston possession, Valvano called for his players to back off and let freshman guard Alvin Franklin bring the ball up the court, while fouling him whenever he had the ball on the belief that the relatively inexperienced Franklin could not withstand the pressure of going to the line with a championship at stake. Franklin missed and the Wolfpack grabbed the rebound. Valvano called timeout with 44 seconds left and drew up a play for senior guard Dereck Whittenburg that called for the team to pass him the ball with ten seconds left on the clock so he could take the final shot. Houston needed a defensive stop so they could get another chance to close out the game. Lewis decided to move from the man-to-man defense his team had been running the whole game to a half court zone trap defense. The Wolfpack, who were not expecting the defensive adjustment, were forced to deviate and began passing the ball around just to keep the Cougars from stealing it. Houston nearly got the turnover it was looking for when Whittenburg made an errant pass to Gannon that Drexler nearly came away with before the sophomore regained control of the ball. The ball eventually wound up in the hands of guard Sidney Lowe, who gave it to forward and fellow senior Thurl Bailey in the corner. Trying to keep the ball moving, as he had been double teamed as soon as he received the pass, Bailey looked back toward Whittenburg, who was approximately thirty feet away from the hoop near midcourt. Bailey threw what Whittenburg would later call a \\"poor fundamental\\" overhanded pass which Houston's Benny Anders, guarding Whittenburg on the play, was in position to steal. At this point, Whittenburg hearkened back to his high school days with Morgan Wootten at DeMatha Catholic High School, where he was taught to always catch the basketball with both hands. If Whittenburg had not attempted to do so in this case, Anders may have gotten the steal and a game-winning breakaway layup. In college basketball at the time, the game clock continued to run after a made field goal, and the Wolfpack likely would not have had time even to inbound the ball. As it was, Anders knocked the ball out of Whittenburg's hands, but Whittenburg quickly regained control. The clock, meanwhile, had ticked down to five seconds and Whittenburg was still standing a significant distance from the goal, Once he regained control, Whittenburg turned and launched a desperation shot to try and win the game for NC State. The shot's trajectory took it to the front of the basket where Olajuwon was covering Wolfpack center Lorenzo Charles. As he watched the shot, Olajuwon said he knew the shot was going to come up short but he also did not want to go for the ball too early because of the potential for goaltending. Charles took advantage of the indecision by Olajuwon and went up for the air ball, then in one motion scored the go-ahead points with a two-handed tip-in dunk. The final two seconds ticked off the clock before Houston could inbound the ball, and with that the game ended and the Wolfpack were the national champions. Despite the loss, Olajuwon was named Tournament MOP as he collected 41 points, 40 rebounds, and 15 blocked shots in the Final Four alone. To date, this remains the last time a player from the losing team was named Most Outstanding Player. It was NC State's second NCAA championship. Their first championship was in 1974, when they defeated the Marquette Warriors. The Wolfpack became the first team to win the NCAA Tournament with at least 10 losses. It also marked Drexler's final college game, as he entered the 1983 NBA Draft with a year of eligibility remaining and was selected 14th overall by the Portland Trail Blazers. In 1995, he returned to Houston and rejoined Olajuwon after the defending champion Rockets traded Otis Thorpe to the Trail Blazers for him in the middle of the season, and he helped lead the Rockets to a second straight NBA championship.

It was located on a river terrace of the Mabechi River, which formed part of its natural defenses. History The actual date of Sannohe Castle’s foundation is unknown; however, it was one of a series of fortifications established by the Nanbu clan in the late Kamakura period or early Muromachi period when the clan relocated its seat from Kai Province to Mutsu Province and started to secure its control over the frontier Nukanobu District. The clan residence remained at nearby Shōjujidate Castle in what is now the town of Nanbu until that fortified house was destroyed in an uprising in June 1539. The 24th hereditary chieftain of the clan, Nanbu Harumasa, relocated his seat to nearby Sannohe Castle. After the death of Nanbu Harumasa in 1582, the clan split into several competing factions. In 1590, the Sannohe faction led by Nanbu Nobunao organized a coalition of most of the Nambu clans and pledged allegiance to Toyotomi Hideyoshi at the Siege of Odawara. In return, he was recognized as chieftain of the Nanbu clans, and confirmed as daimyō of his existing holdings in the northern districts of Mutsu Province. However, Kunohe Masazane, leader of a rival faction, felt that he had a stronger claim to the title of clan chieftain, and immediately rose in rebellion. After the suppression of the Kunohe Rebellion, Sannohe castle was modernized with stone ramparts. However, after the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate, the clan seat was relocated south to Morioka Castle in 1634, and Sannohe Castle was allowed to fall into ruins. In 1684, Morioka Domain established a daikansho, constructing a jin'ya on the site of the old castle. After the Meiji restoration, one of the gates was donated to a local temple, and remaining structures were pulled down. The area later became the . In 1967, a faux-donjon was constructed to serve as a local history museum, even though there is no historical evidence to indicate that such a structure existed at any point in the castle’s history. In 1989 one of the gates of the castle was also re-constructed. Description Sannohe Castle is located at a strategic junction of the Ōshū Kaidō with the Mabechi River and one of its tributaries, the Appigawa. The castle is situated on a long and narrow hilltop with dimensions of approximately 500 meters by 200 meters, with sheer 70 meter sides, extending northwest to southeast. This area was divided into 20 enclosures at various levels, each surrounded by earthen walls. The main bailey is the highest and largest enclosure, with dimensions of 100 by 200 meters. Lower enclosures held the residences of relatives and important retainers, the garrison, stables and several ponds. In the Edo period, the most important enclosures were rebuilt with stone walls, and gates.

And coexists for centuries, more or less peacefully, with Muslims and Christians, in which it would be called city of the three cultures. Description The quarter can be reached through a gate. One of the many entrances is the gate Puerta de Assulca, which has in its vicinity in flea market where oil, butter, chickpeas, lentils and everything necessary for daily life are sold. Then it enters the streets, adarves (dead-end streets) and squares of the quarter. The main street is called Calle del Mármol and connects the Jewish quarter with the rest of the city. There is a market, places to pray, public baths, bread ovens, palaces and a wall. Near the Tagus river is the neighborhood Barrio del Degolladero, so named because here was the designated place for the ritual slaughter (shechitah) of beef-cattle. In the neighborhood Barrio de Hamazelt the richest Jewish families lived and in the street known today as San Juan de Dios, lived the best known Jew of Toledo: Samuel ha-Levi. He was the treasurer of the king Peter of Castile and ordered to build a big synagogue, that later was known like \\"Synagogue of El Transito\\". And like in all the Jewish houses, also in his one there is a mezuzah with containing passages from Deuteronomy. In Jewish tradition the mezuzah is believed to protect the home. The place of prayer of the Jews is the synagogue and today it is conserved the one of Santa María la Blanca and the one of El Tránsito. Before, every Friday before sunset, a rabbi sounded three times the shofar (a goat's horn) announcing the arrival of the Sabbath, a weekly holiday for the Jews, who rested while the rest of the city continued with its usual bustle.

A very versatile weapon it was used as primary, secondary and tertiary armament on a number of ship classes. After being replaced aboard ships of the Royal Italian Navy it saw widespread use on land in a number of different roles such as coastal artillery, anti-aircraft gun and railroad gun during World War II. History The 76/40 Model 1916's origins lay in the British QF 12 pounder 12 cwt gun designed 1893 and first produced in 1897. The QF 12 pounder 12 cwt gun was designed and produced by the Elswick Ordnance Company for the British Royal Navy and also for export customers. Italy and Japan were two early export customers that later purchased production licenses for the gun. The majority of the Italian guns were produced by the Ansaldo Company from a design provided during World War I by the Armstrong Company, the parent company of EOC. Construction The 76/40 Model 1916 was a fairly complicated design with an A tube, a shrunk on jacket that extended to the breech, and a B tube which extended to the muzzle. Over the jacket and B tube a C hoop was shrunk on, which screwed onto the jacket and secured the B tube. There was a shortened version of the gun called the 76/30 Model 1915, which was used on a few classes of destroyers, submarines, tugs and minesweepers. The 76/30 Model 1915 were also used as truck mounted artillery during both world wars. The mounts for the Italian guns were different than their British counterparts and there were five different varieties. The quick fire breech was identical to that of the Royal Navy gun, except for the cartridge extractor and the firing mechanism. Traverse and elevation were manual and a crew of seven were needed to man the gun. The guns fired fixed quick fire ammunition and a crew could sustain a rate of fire ranging from 12-15 rounds per minute. Mounts available: * Model 1915 - pedestal mount: -10° to +42° elevation, which weighed complete. * Regia Marina Model 1916 - pedestal mount: -10° to +65° elevation, which weighed complete. * Ansaldo Model 1917 - pedestal mount: -10° to +75° elevation, which weighed complete. * Cannone da 76/40 C.A. - pedestal mount: -5° to +75° elevation, which weighed complete. * Cannone da 76/40 modificata 35 - pedestal mount: -6° to +81° elevation, which weighed complete. Naval Use The 76/40 Model 1916 was widely used on a number of different types and classes of ships. It was often mounted in single casemates, turrets or on unprotected pivot mounts. It was used aboard pre-dreadnought battleships, dreadnought battleships, protected cruisers, armored cruisers, light cruisers, destroyers, torpedo boats, minesweepers, submarines, gunboats, barges and armored trains of the Royal Italian Navy. Ship classes that carried the 76/40 include: *Constanța-classNicolae Koslinski, Raymond Stănescu, Marina română in al doilea război mondial: 1941-1942, Făt-Frumos, 1996, pp. 72 and 85 Anti- aircraft Use In 1933 the navy began replacing the 76/40. Salvaged guns were mounted on a high angle pedestal mount and given the designation Cannone da 76/40 C.A. and assigned to anti-aircraft and coastal artillery units of the Royal Italian Army. In 1935 some guns were given new recuperators and higher angle mounts and redesignated as the Cannone da 76/40 modificata 35. Slow traverse, slow elevation, low muzzle velocity, lack of automated fire direction and lack of automatic fuse setting hindered its use as an anti- aircraft gun. However it was estimated that Italy had 730 Cannone da 76/40 C.A. and Cannone da 76/40 modificata 35 guns in use during World War II. These remained in use together with 66/47, 76/45 Model 1911, 100/47, 102/35 and 102/45 due to insufficient numbers of the newer Cannone da 75/46 and Cannone da 90/53. Unmodified guns taken over by Germany after the Italian defeat were given the designation 7.62 cm Flak 266/1 (i) and modified guns were given the designation 7.62 cm Flak 266/2 (i). Autocannon Use During World War I the Royal Italian Navy created two batteries, four guns each of truck-mounted anti-aircraft guns. These were referred to as \\"autocannoni\\". The guns were Model 1915 76/30's mounted on Fiat 18 B.L.R. trucks. These batteries were used to defend Italian naval bases, although one battery was attached to the Royal Italian Army late in the war. During the inter-war period a third battery equipped with six truck-mounted 76/30 guns was created and the earlier guns were mounted on new Lancia R0 truck chassis (photo). In 1942 some of the guns were again mounted on newer Fiat 634N truck chassis. These guns mainly used as anti-aircraft guns with secondary anti-tank and field artillery roles. The three batteries equipped with 76/30 guns were the 13th and 14th Batteries with five guns each, and the 16th Battery with four guns. The 14th was assigned to the 60th Sabratha Infantry Division, while the 16th was assigned to the 16th Pistoia Infantry Division. The last seven surviving guns were assigned to the Centauro Armored Division when it surrendered in Tunisia during 1943.

The festival was attended by 26,000 people from 157 countries. The slogan of the festival was \\"For anti- imperialist solidarity, peace and friendship\\". Objective Kopek postage stamp, 1985 The political goal of the festival was to show positive aspects of life in Soviet society. The political program of the festival included the establishment of a new international economic order, discussion of the problems of economic assistance to backward and developing countries, combating poverty and unemployment, and raising environmental issues. Anti- Soviet elements, just as before the 1980 Summer Olympics, were expelled from Moscow before the opening of the festival. Events GDR stamp commemorating the 12th World Festival of Youth and Students, 1985. MiNr 2960 The main organizer of the festival events was the Soviet Preparatory Committee, chaired by Vladimir Fedosov, secretary of the Central Committee of the Komsomol. The Komsomol relied heavily on the infrastructure of the Moscow 1980 Summer Olympics for the festival venues, including the Luzhniki Olympic Complex and the Cosmos Hotel, which accommodated 3,000 foreign participants. The opening of the festival took place at a four hour parade and ceremony at Luzhniki stadium and was broadcast live on Soviet television. The festival was opened with a welcome speech from the newly-elected General Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, Mikhail Gorbachev: The festival included an exhibition of young artists, a photo exhibition, and concerts by amateur and ethnic groups, as well as professional performers from the socialist states such as Zemlyane, Mashina Vremeni, Tsvety, Integral, Dean Reed, Bajaga i Instruktori, Bijelo Dugme and Western musicians Bob Dylan, and Everything but the Girl. \\"Waltz of Silence\\", a song by Yuri Livshits, was the final melody of the festival. Commemorative Merchandise USSR Commemorative Coin for the 1985 World Festival Medal for active participation in the preparation and conduct of the XII World Festival of Youth and Students) Before the festival, posters, postage stamps with festival symbols, a commemorative coin were issued and a special promotional campaign was held by the Soviet state lottery. The poster and symbols of the festival were approved by the Central Committee of the CPSU. The emblem of the festival was chosen as a result of a competition in 1984 in which more than 200 professional artists from different countries took part. The winning designer of the festival's emblem was People's Artist of Ukraine Rafael Zeynurovich Masautov. The emblem was used in more than 80 countries. In the USSR the emblem of the festival, at the order of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, was used to produce more than 7,000 souvenir items. The emblem brought the USSR a net profit of 450,000,000 Soviet rubles (through surcharges for products with festival symbols). \\"Katyusha\\", the mascot of the festival, was conceived by Soviet artist Vyacheslav Yermakov, photographer Yuri Alekseevich Zharov and artist Ekaterina Afanasyevna Dunaeva, who was also depicted on the official poster of the festival for the Central Committee of the CPSU youth publication \\"Plakat\\". \\"Katyusha\\" was sketched by Mikhail Veremenko, an artist from Moscow. At the first meeting of the International Preparatory Committee of the XIX World Festival of Youth and Students of 2017, which will be held in Sochi, Russia, the logo of the event was chosen to be an updated version of the logos of the two previous Moscow world festivals of youth and students in 1957 and 1985.

Her father was a British colonial administrator and she later married her father's secretary, Sir Richard Strachey, and ten of their children survived into adulthood. She was an outspoken advocate for the right of women to vote and involved her daughters in her campaigning. She wrote two books for children. Early life The children of Sir Richard and Lady Strachey Lady Strachey was born on the ship Earl of Hadwick off the coast of Cape of Good Hope on 13 March 1840. Her father was British Colonial Administrator Sir John Peter Grant who later served as the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal and as Governor of Jamaica and her mother was Henrietta Chichele Plowden. She became the second wife of her father's secretary Sir Richard Strachey, who was 23 years older than her in 1859. Sir Richard and Lady Strachey had 13 children, 10 of whom survived into adulthood – Lytton, James, Dorothea, Pernel, Oliver, Marjorie, Dick, Ralph, Philippa and Elinor. Professional life Lady Strachey in her younger days Her husband introduced her to the works of John Stuart Mill. They moved to Edinburgh in 1866–1867 and Lady Strachey began gathering signatures for petitioning the Parliament for women's right to vote. Her first article on women's suffrage was published in The Attempt which was published by the Edinburgh Ladies Debating Society. She became a member of the Edinburgh National Society for Women's Suffrage in 1868 but moved to India with her husband who was posted in the British Colonial administration again. The couple returned to London in 1879 and she restarted her suffrage work. She was an active supporter of the New Hospital for Women, an initiative to provide poor women with medical help from qualified female practitioners. She was also a financial supporter of Girton College, Cambridge. She was an organiser of the Women's Local Government Society and in 1909 became the chair of its London branch. Her work achieved fruition when a WLGS sponsored bill was mentioned in the King's Speech in 1907. Lady Strachey also published two children's books, in 1887 and 1893. She also wrote Poets on Poets in 1894 besides working on an English translation of Alexander Herzen's De l'autre rive. An account of her and her family is provided in Betty Askwith's Two Victorian Families. In 1907, Lady Strachey was elected to the Executive committee of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies. She and her daughters were also active organisers of the Mud March from Hyde Park to Exeter Hall to demand the right to vote. In 1909 she became an editorial board member of the English Woman's Journal and was elected as the President of the South Paddington Committee of the London Society for Women's Suffrage. Her professional activities declined after her husband's death in 1909. She was offered the directorship of the Society of Women Writers and Journalists in 1920, which she declined. She died in 1928.

Early life Moriyasu was born in Tokyo.Kazunori Sugiyama, \\"Shotaro Moriyasu\\". The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz. 2nd edition, ed. Barry Kernfeld He was self-taught on piano, though his parents were musically inclined. He graduated from Keio University. Later life and career Moriyasu sold refrigerators for a short time, then became a professional musician in the late 1940s, when there was an increase in entertainment opportunities in Japan. He worked in the bands of Shungo Sawada and Nobuo Hara, also arranging for Hara's ensemble, Sharps and Flats. Moriyasu's first pianistic influence was Teddy Wilson, but he turned to studying the bebop of Bud Powell around 1950, \\"transcribing not only melodies but solos, bass lines, drum fills, and harmonic progressions\\". At this time, Moriyasu was playing with the Red Hot Boys at the 400 Club in Yokohama. He also attended jam sessions in the same city that included musicians who were part of the American military involved in the occupation of Japan. His association with like-minded tenor saxophonist Akira Miyazawa in the Four Sounds was short but inspiring. \\"Before long he was regarded as the most accomplished bopper in Japan, whose awesome technique and odd personal habits intimidated many musicians and audiences.\\" Moriyasu was an exception to the tendency of the time for soloists in jazz in Japan to play whatever most pleased the audience, which was made up of both American occupiers and locals. \\"The word 'apparition' (maboroshi) has become irrevocably associated with him. His pale, sickly countenance suggested a salaried office worker rather than the hippest pianist in Japan.\\" Moriyasu occasionally played while \\"sitting beneath the keyboard with his back to the instrument, essentially playing the piano backwards.\\" He had large hands, stretching to play tenths with ease. Moriyasu was never officially recorded; the only recording that exists was made during an all-night session at the Mocambo club in Yokohama on July 27–28, 1954. These were first released, on LP, 22 years later. \\"In the last months of his life Moriyasu started exhibiting strange and unstable behavior.\\" On September 28, 1955, Moriyasu killed himself at the age of 31 by jumping into the path of a moving train in Tokyo.

The text is thought to have been written around 163 AD in Asia. The text is set up as a conversation between an Athenian, Mnesippus, and a Scythian friend, Toxaris. Their discussion begins with Mnesippus questioning the Scythians' devotion to Orestes and Pylades, in whose honor the Scythians had constructed a temple. Mnesippus asks why the Scythians would ever honor two men who had attacked their city, stolen Iphigenia who was priestess of their temple to Artemis, and finally the statue of Artemis itself from the Scythian city of Tauris. Toxaris tells Mnesippus that the Scythians venerate Orestes and his companion Pylades because of their devotion to friendship. He claims that Scythians are masters of practicing friendship while the Greeks have mastered merely describing it through their plays and writings. They decide to test the validity of his statement which Mnesippus claims is false. What follows is a contest of tales where Mnesippus and Toxaris determine whether Toxaris is correct. They both swear an oath to tell only true tales and decide on each telling five stories of true friendship that they have witnessed during their own lifetimes.

It was described by historian John-Paul Himka as \\"vehemently antisemitic.\\" paper presented at the conference \\"Soviet Totalitarianism in Ukraine: History and Legacy\\" held in Kiev on September 2–6, 2005 Himka described it as a Nazi propaganda daily, published during World War II in the Ukrainian language with the German financial aid, and with exposure orchestrated by Joseph Goebbels himself. Origins After the Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939 in accordance with the Nazi-Soviet Pact, many Ukrainian nationalists left the Soviet- controlled Western Ukraine for the German zone of occupation, and Kraków became the centre of their nationalist activity. Some of the most prominent Ukrainian writers contributed to Krakivs’ki visti. According to John-Paul Himka, a history professor at the University of Alberta, from 1940 until 1945, the newspaper was the \\"most important\\" in the Ukrainian language under the World War II German occupation. The newspaper's publisher, the Ukrainian Publishing House (UV) Ukrainske Vydavnytstvo, was established in December 1939 in Kraków, then the capital of the General Government or General Governorate, under occupation by Nazi Germany. \\"Despite the financial and technical difficulties, strict German censorship, and paper shortages that plagued it throughout its existence\\", Ukrainian Publishing House published prolifically from 1940 to 1945. In a November 19, 1939 meeting with Ukrainian representatives, Governor general Hans Frank \\"pledged his support for a Ukrainian publishing house and press.\\" The original funding came from the Ukrainian population of the General Governorate for the new limited company, Krakivs'ki Visti. The German Head of the Press Department, Emil Gassner, gave Yevhen Yulii Pelensky, Ukrainske Vydavnytstvo's first director, the right to take over the printing press confiscated from the Jewish Nowy Dziennik. The daily was closely associated with the Ukrainian Central Committee headed by Volodymyr Kubiyovych. It was more autonomous than other Ukrainian-language publication under the German rule. Distribution The first issue of Krakivs'ki Visti was published on January 7, 1940. It began to publish a daily paper in November 1940. At that time Ukrainske Vydavnytstvo began to publish a weekly paper for the rural population. The German occupiers limited the newspapers to small press runs. The press run was just over 10,000 in 1941 and just over 15,000 in 1943. There were very few Ukrainians living in Kraków, where the newspaper was published, therefore most copies were distributed elsewhere. The readership was located in the Governorate and among the Ukrainians \\"working as forced labor in Germany\\", and in German-occupied Europe. The Germans placed a ban on circulating the newspaper to the Reichskommissariat Ukraine (RKU), the civilian regime of much of Nazi German- occupied Ukraine, where \\"the bulk of the potential readership lived.\\" The targeted audience envisioned by the newspapers founders were the \\"peasants, workers and refugees.\\" In the end the daily was aimed at the intelligentsia and the weekly for the rural population and workers. After the Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939 in accordance with the Nazi-Soviet Pact, many Ukrainian nationalists left the Soviet-controlled Kresy for the German zone of occupation, and Kraków became the centre of their nationalist activity. Some of the most prominent Ukrainian writers contributed to Krakivs’ki visti. However, there were very few Ukrainians living in Kraków, therefore most copies were distributed elsewhere. Content Krakivs'ki visti, with headquarters in Kraków since 1940, republished materials from the German papers for distribution in the General Government territory of occupied Poland, especially the Nazi party organ Völkischer Beobachter, which appeared frequently. The articles were also translated from Berliner Illustrierte Nachtausgabe and all most important German papers. The Krakivs'ki Visti was distributed in Nazi Germany among the Ukrainian Ostarbeiter workers for the purpose of indoctrination especially after the anti-Soviet Operation Barbarossa of 1941, but also throughout other German-occupied countries. The company was moved to Vienna in 1944 ahead of the Soviet counteroffensive. The last issue was published on March 29, 1945. Critics After Mykhailo Khomiak's death in 1984, John-Paul Himka, Khomiak's son-in-law, accessed Khomiak's papers, which are now held in the Provincial Archives of Alberta. Mykhailo Khomiak changed his name to Michael Chomiak when he emigrated to Canada after World War II. According to Himka, the anti-Jewish materials published in Krakiws'ki Visti contributed in no small way to atmosphere conductive to the mass murder of Jews. Khomiak's granddaughter, Chrystia Freeland, is Canada's Minister of Foreign Affairs. Some Canadian officials have claimed in 2017 that the circulation of news regarding Chomiak's connection to Nazism was the result of a Russian disinformation campaign. Nevertheless, these facts have been confirmed by the University of Alberta historian and son-in-law of Chomiak, Professor John-Paul Himka, among others. Editors Ukrainske Vydavnytstvo's director Pelens'ki, had difficulty hiring a chief editor for the Krakivs'ki visti. Many talented editors from Lviv feared Soviet reprisals against their families who remained in Galicia. The first editor, Borys Levyt'ski was fired on the insistence of the Germans, after he published an article on the Russo-Finnish War. Mykhailo Khomiak, who was in his thirties at the time, was appointed as editor-in-chief to replace Levyt'ski in 1940 and remained in that position until the paper closed in 1945. During that time, Ley Lepkyi was the deputy editor and Roman Kupchyns'kyi, Mariian Kozak, Iaroslav Zaremba, and Petro Sahaidachnyi, who were all Galacians, served on the editorial board. Relations with German authorities The paper \\"was constantly running into difficulties with German censors\\", which did \\"damage to the paper\\" and created a \\"dangerous editorial crisis\\". In his correspondence with the publisher's office, Khomiak \\"placed blame\\" on the \\"lack of editorial presence in the newspaper\\", on German censorship. =Antisemitic articles (1943)= In May 1943, the German press chief, demanded that the newspaper publish a series of antisemitic articles in the \\"flagship of Ukrainian journalism under Nazi occupation,\\" Krakov's daily newspaper, the Krakivs'ki Visti. In 1984, following the death of Mykhailo Khomiak, then known as Michael Chomiak, his personal records revealed his role as editor-in-chief at Krakivski visti from 1940 through 1945 when he was in his thirties. He emigrated to Canada after WWII. Included in his records were detailed communications providing historical context of the articles. The records were acquired by the Provincial Archives of Alberta in 1985. Himka used these records as primary sources for papers he presented at Ukrainian- Jewish relations conferences in Kyiv in 1991 and Jerusalem in 1993. His 1996 article, \\"Krakivski visti and the Jews, 1943: A Contribution to the History of Ukrainian-Jewish Relations during the Second World War\\", published in the Journal of Ukrainian Studies, was a revised version of these papers. The records provided the names of the authors (now deceased) of the articles which were not included in the 1943 Krakivski vistiarticles: Kost Kuzyk, Luka Lutsiv, Olena Kysilevska, Oleksander Mystsiuk, and Oleksander Mokh who wrote a series of articles. Other Himka described the Krakivski visti as the \\"flagship of Ukrainian journalism under Nazi occupation,\\" Krakov's daily newspaper, the Krakivs'ki Visti. The articles, which were published between May 25 through July, \\"provoked indignation on the part of the Ukrainian intelligentsia\\".

Also known as Spelling to Communicate, it is closely related to the scientifically discreditedFacilitated Communication: Sifting the Psychological Wheat from the Chaff. American Psychological Association. June 13, 2016. technique facilitated communication (FC). Practitioners of RPM have failed to assess the issue of message agency using simple and direct scientific methodologies, saying that that doing so would be stigmatizing and that allowing scientific criticisms of the technique robs people with autism of their right to communicate. The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association has issued a statement opposing the practice of RPM. Soma Mukhopadhyay is credited with creating RPM, though others have developed similar techniques, known as informative pointing or alphabet therapy. RPM users report unexpected literacy skills in their clients, as well as a reduction in some of the behavioral issues associated with autism. As noted by Stuart Vyse, although RPM differs from facilitated communication in some ways, \\"it has the same potential for unconscious prompting because the letter board is always held in the air by the assistant. As long as the method of communication involves the active participation of another person, the potential for unconscious guidance remains.\\" Critics warn that RPM's over-reliance on prompts (verbal and physical cuing by facilitators) may inhibit development of independent communication in its target population. As of April 2017, only one scientific study attempting to support Mukhopadhyay's claims of efficacy has been conducted, though reviewers found the study had serious methodological flaws. Vyse has noted that rather than proponents of RPM subjecting the methodology to properly controlled validation research, they have responded to criticism by going on the offensive, claiming that scientific criticisms of the technique rob people with autism of their right to communicate, while the authors of a 2019 review concluded that \\"...until future trials have demonstrated safety and effectiveness, and perhaps more importantly, have first clarified the authorship question, we strongly discourage clinicians, educators, and parents of children with ASD from using RPM.\\" Overview RPM founder Mukhopadhyay purports to base RPM on psychological, developmental and behavioral theories put forth by Jean Piaget (developmental psychology) and Anna Jean Ayres (sensory integration), the goal of which is to \\"establish functional independent pointing-based communication in people who are otherwise nonverbal due to severe autism or other developmental disabilities.\\" RPM users employ elements of Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA), but reject the documentation and evaluation procedures integral to ABA as being unnecessary and stigmatizing. Mukhopadhyay postulates that, by observing student's self- stimulatory behaviors (as in the case of autism, the \\"sensory preoccupations that drive and develop them\\"), she can identify each student's \\"dominant learning channel\\" (visual, tactile, or auditory) and individualize a program to match his or her needs. RPM facilitators \\"presume competence\\" in their (often nonspeaking) communication partners; the assumption being that people with autism \\"are likely to possess considerable hidden knowledge that they cannot express\\" and that prompting will address these individuals' hypothesized difficulties with motor planning and self-stimulatory behaviors. RPM is a \\"low-tech approach that requires only an instructor, student, paper, and pencil\\". =Certification and licensing= As of April 2017, RPM is not recognized as a clinical profession nor does it have recognized standards for registering, licensing or certifying treatment providers. Practitioners appear to be self-taught or have participated in workshops and camps offered by Mukhopadhyay, Heather Clare (Informative Pointing), or Vanderbilt Kennedy Center Angelman Program (Alphabet Therapy). Professionals applying for RPM workshops are required to submit 10-min video samples of the use of rapid prompting, a resume, and a letter explaining the \\"reason for wanting to attend course\\". =Targeted populations= RPM literature indicates that, along with autism, the technique has been tried with people who have Fragile X syndrome, blindness, deafness, Angelman syndrome, Down syndrome, Williams syndrome, and Prader-Willi syndrome. =Practices and procedures= Beginning with a \\"teach- ask\\" protocol, the facilitator presents the student with a concept (i.e., The chair is yellow), then immediately follows up with a question (i.e., \\"What color is the chair?\\"). The student is then given prompts (i.e., two pieces of paper, with choices written on each) to represent the answer. This procedure is repeated, using a combination of prompts provided by the facilitator to elicit a response. Prompts may include physical (i.e. words written on paper), auditory (i.e. the sound of paper tearing), verbal (i.e. spoken directives), and visual (i.e. gestures by the facilitator). Choices move from two, three, to four and so on, with increased difficulty. The student progresses from making choices, to spelling on a letter board held by the facilitator, to spelling on a letter board (flat on a table or held by the student) or voice- output device, independently. Historical background The rapid prompting method (also known as RPM, Rapid Prompting, Soma®RPM, Informative Pointing, Spelling To Communicate (STC) and Alphabet Therapy) is largely credited to Soma Mukhopadhyay, who has a master's degree in chemistry and a bachelor's in education. By trial and error, Mukhopadhyay combined various behavioral and communication techniques to help her son, Tito, who has a diagnosis of autism and exhibits limited speaking abilities. Mukhopadhyay posits that autism is a manifestation in which a child's cognitive abilities are undermined by poor sensory integration abilities and that RPM serves to \\"activate the reasoning part of the brain\\" and, therefore, distracts the student into learning. Proponents of RPM and related techniques claim to be able to help people with disabilities express untapped intellectual abilities and advance communication skills through a system of pointing, typing, or writing with verbal and physical prompts from a facilitator. This is, purportedly, \\"the most direct and unlimited path to learning and communicating.\\" RPM proponents point to the \\"sole study of RPM\\", \\"Harnessing repetitive behaviours to engage attention and learning in a novel therapy for autism: An exploratory analysis\\", published in the journal Frontiers in Psychology (2012), as proof of the method's efficacy. In 2001, Mukhopadhyay brought RPM to the United States, in conjunction with a fellowship from the Cure Autism Now Foundation, lead by Portia Iversen and Jon Shestack. In 2004, Mukhopadhyay and Helping Autism through Learning and Outreach (HALO) collaborated to expand RPM's reach nationally. Mukhopadhyay owns the trademark for RPM. In 2005, Mukhopadhyay moved from California to Austin, Texas, where she established the Halo-Soma Institute. There, she provides clinical services, offers workshops and promotes RPM internationally. Evaluation research is not conducted by the institute. Mukhopadhyay is the author of Rapid Prompting: an Instructional Guide, Understanding Autism through Rapid Prompting (2008) and Curriculum Guide for Autism Using Rapid Prompting Method: with Lesson Plan Suggestions (2011). After some initial collaboration with Mukhopadhyay, Iversen developed the Informative Pointing Method. She also wrote a book called Strange Son: Two Mothers, Two Sons, and the Quest to Unlock the Hidden World of Autism, which, as one reviewer stated, expresses her \\"absorbing and speculative views\\" on autism which are \\"at once compelling and controversial.\\" Iversen spends much of the book discussing Tito's communications and documenting her own son, Dov's, introduction to RPM. Alphabet Therapy was developed and is promoted by Vanderbilt University and focuses specifically on people with Angelman Syndrome. Organizations that have made statements opposing rapid prompting method * The American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (AAIDD) * The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) * The Irish Association of Speech and Language Therapists (IASLT) * Speech-Language and Audiology Canada (SAC) Criticism =Empirical evidence= RPM proponents point to one study to support their claims of efficacy: \\"Harnessing repetitive behaviours to engage attention and learning in a novel therapy for autism: An exploratory analysis, as proof of the method's efficacy\\". In this peer-reviewed, quantitative study using videotaped sessions of Mukhopadhyay working with clients, the study authors attempted to measure how RPM influenced participants' attention to their facilitator and the materials being presented (joint attention) and the effect of RPM on restrictive and stereotypic behaviors (RSB). Although RSBs reduced as joint attention increased, the authors were unable to show that RPM itself had a direct correlation to the behaviors exhibited by the participants or that joint attention increased as a result of its use. Correct answers were observed while students were not engaged with the activity, leading reviewers of the study to ask: \\"How does the client know how to answer, what the answer options are, or where the letters are located if the client is not looking at the facilitator or at the moving letter board?\\" The study authors postulated that \\"direct gaze [at the facilitator or letter board] may actually inhibit the ability to respond correctly,\\" The authors did not investigate authorship of the communications produced during the RPM sessions. According to reviewers, RPM method does make use of concepts such as errorless learning, response interruption, and redirection. However, these behavioral intervention components are not implemented in a manner consistent with the research-base. Practitioners claim to be responsive to each individual's dominant open sensory channel, the \\"basic features of training\\" to not appear to be distinctively different across the channels. Studying RPM's efficacy is made difficult by policies that prevent videotaping of RPM sessions (even of one's own child) and instructional workshops. A study in 2020 continued the pattern of proponents studying the issue of agency in the use of RPM by using indirect, rather than direct (message passing) methodologies. Jaswal et al (2020) found that the non-verbal (according to their reports) autistic individuals in their study (1) made anticipatory eye movements to the next letter in a word prior to touching the letter, (2) had longer pauses in their letter-touching within words than between words, and (3) were faster at touching common letter patterns in sequence than was the case for less common letter patterns. Based upon these indirect indices of message agency, it was concluded that the autistic individuals, rather than the assistants who held the letter boards, were the agents of the messages. Vyse, however, argued that none of these findings provides clear evidence regarding message agency. For example, the longer pauses between words could simply have resulted from the fact that the assistant voiced each word aloud after the final letter of each word was touched.. Vyse also argued that the authors have not provided a compelling reason why simpler, and more direct, methods of assessing message agency (some form of message passing methodology) were not used in the study, and why simple controls that could bolster the authors' claims (e.g. placing the letterboard on a stand instead of it being held by the assistant or putting a blindfold on the assistant) were not utilized. Accordingly, to date, RPM proponents, by resisting participation in studies, have failed to produce methodologically sound, evidence-based studies demonstrating that RPM provides people with autism and other developmental disabilities a reliable and independent method for communicating. =Unexpected literacy and extraordinary communication abilities= Critics of RPM are concerned that, sometimes even on the first attempt at using the method, people with profound communication and/or developmental disabilities achieve levels of communication or understanding of subject matter beyond what their expected age or exposure to formal education would predict. In some cases, students, with prompting, produce results in a language other than the one he or she has been exposed, indicating facilitator, rather than student authorship. Facilitators, sympathetic to the RPM goals of ensuring student success, may unknowingly, unintentionally, or unconsciously move the letter board to achieve the desired communication outcome. =Prompt dependency= In order to point, type or write using RPM, people with disabilities rely on an aide or facilitator to give verbal or gestural prompts and/or hold a letter board during the sessions, which precludes independent communication. Prompts may include verbal reprimands, trial termination, physical redirection, slapping or shaking the letter board against the subject's face or chest, and blocking escape by positioning the subject between the table and walls. Some of the verbal and gestural prompting procedures used in RPM are similar to the Pinchbeck Technique used by conjurers to \\"create the illusion of letter-by- letter communication.\\" Critics point out that there are no procedures in place to prevent students' over reliance on their facilitator. Likewise, there is no purposeful or systematic fading of prompts with RPM, though research-based techniques exist to support transference of prompt-reliant behaviors to \\"naturally occurring discriminitive stimuli\\". This reliance on prompts creates a dependency that, essentially, reduces independent communication and increases the chances that the facilitators are authoring the messages. In other words, \\"accurate responding may not occur unless the aide knows the answers.\\" Proponents assert that \\"prompt dependency is preferable to no response\\" from the subjects. With advanced computer technology capable of allowing people access to communication with eye movements, critics also question \\"the validity of any communication method that requires the physical help of someone else.\\" Critics counter this assertion. Prompt dependency creates an active participation in the communication process. Therefore the \\"potential for unconscious guidance remains\\". =Facilitated communication= Facilitated communication, a technique in which a facilitator supports a person with disabilities at the arm, wrist or hand during the process of typing on a letter board, is closely related to RPM. Controlled studies in the 1990s determined that, when facilitators did not know the answers to questions being asked through FC, the answers were \\"routinely inaccurate\\". Facilitators were (unconsciously) authoring the messages. Proponents of RPM deny similarities with FC because the aide or facilitator in RPM holds the letter board but \\"does not touch the person typing\\" and that the prompts are \\"nonspecific.\\" However, critics of RPM point out that subtle cuing takes place during RPM that makes it \\"highly susceptible to facilitator influence.\\" Other similarities between RPM and FC include: reluctance or refusal to test facilitator/client pairs in controlled settings (purportedly because the process breaks the trust between the pair), presumed competence, reliance on anecdotal accounts as proof of efficacy, maintenance of practices, techniques and claims that are inconsistent with the known body of work around the behavior and communication skills of individuals with developmental disabilities or proven remediation techniques, claims of extraordinary literacy or intellectual breakthroughs, unconscious verbal or physical cuing by facilitators to obtain the expected responses, inadequate or non-existent protocols to fade supported or facilitated prompts. Media RPM has been featured in several documentary and on several television news programs including: 60 Minutes II, CNN, PBS (How does the autistic brain work?), and National Geographic (Mind Tree Poems, 2005). Mukhopadhyay's son, Tito, featured prominently in a BBC Documentary, Tito's Story, and is given credit for co-authoring (with his mother using RPM), \\"two poetry books, a collection of short stories, and a book describing his sensory experience.\\" Print sources discussing RPM and the Mukhopadhyays, include The New York Times and Scientific American, the latter of which criticized active proponents for not attempting a scientific study of the method. The August 2014 documentary film, A Mother's Courage: Talking Back to Autism, was adapted from a 2009 Icelandic film entitled Solskinsdrengurrin (The Sunshine Boy) by Margrét Dagmar Ericsdóttir and Friðrik Þór Friðriksson. The film follows Margret, an Icelandic woman, in her quest to find answers for her 11-year-old son who is severely impaired. Her search leads her to Austin, TX, Mukhopadhyay and RPM. RPM was featured in an Apple Inc. commercial, which led to criticism of Apple for promoting pseudoscience. Critics of this type of media attention point out that these programs portray autism as \\"mysterious in nature\\", offer anecdotal evidence (i.e., Tito's poetry) as proof that RPM works, and downplay the fact that RPM \\"does not have research to support it at this time.\\" Bibliography =Articles= *Evidence does not support the use of Rapid Prompting Method (RPM) as an intervention for students with autism spectrum disorder and further primary research is not justified *Harnessing repetitive behaviours to engage attention and learning in a novel therapy for autism: An exploratory analysis *Rapid Prompting Method (RPM): A suitable intervention for students with ASD? * Voices from the Past: Comparing the Rapid Prompting Method and Facilitated Communication * Rapid Prompting Method Is Not Consistent with Evidence-Based Reading Instruction for Students with Autism =Book Chapters= *Old horses in new stables: Rapid prompting, facilitated communication, science, ethics, and the history of magic.

MUCS is one of the founding choirs of the Intervarsity Choral Festival (Australia), although it has not been a member since 2012. It is also an affiliated member of the Australian National Choral Association.  History  MUCS was established in 1939 when the University of Melbourne male and female glee clubs merged. The first conductor of this new combined choir was Dan Hardy from the Melbourne Conservatorium of Music. This new mixed choir flourished under Hardy, and within a few years the choir had grown to more than 100 members. In 1945, the choir began to present radio performances of madrigals and Christmas carols. Dan Hardy eventually resigned in 1948. In the following eleven years the choir appointed a number of conductors, none of whom had the longevity of Hardy. In 1959 the choir would appoint George Logie- Smith as conductor. Logie-Smith envisioned a much more active and influential choir and as a result, MUCS began to perform larger works more regularly. Throughout the previous two decades MUCS had typically presented a single yearly concert of small and medium-sized works. However, in 1961, under the baton of Logie-Smith, MUCS gave three large concerts, including Handel's \\"Messiah\\" and Brahms's \\"A German Requiem\\". In the following years, MUCS performed Bach's Christmas Oratorio, Monteverdi's L’Orfeo, Orff's Carmina Burana, Purcell's Dido and Aeneas, and Beethoven's Mass in C major. In 1992 MUCS, appointed its current conductor, Andrew Wailes. Following this appointment MUCS established a strong working relationship with the Royal Melbourne Philharmonic Choir and Orchestra, of which Wailes is also Musical Director and Conductor. The two choirs and orchestra regularly perform joint concerts.

Nelson Morales also attends UCSB and he handles on the DEL PLAYA. Basketball career Morales began playing for the Atleticos in 1963, playing in 14 games that season, with an average of 4.2 points a game, without recording a rebound or assist in any of the 14 games he played at. For the next two years, his stats did not improve very much, but in 1966, he saw an increase in play time, which in turn led to a much improved level of performance and he averaged double digits in scoring for the first time in his BSN career, scoring 230 points in 20 games for an average of 11.5 points a game. He also caught his first recorded BSN rebound and passed his first recorded BSN assist, finishing with 2.6 and 1.1 per game in those two categories, respectively. Aside from having a woeful season from the free- throw line during 1967, (he made only 38 of 171 attempts for an average of 22 percent free throws made) the 1967 BSN season turned out to be the best, statistically speaking, of Morales' 9 seasons at Puerto Rico's top professional basketball league, as he averaged 13.7 points per game, with 4.3 rebounds and 3.2 assists per game, all career highs for the young basketball player. Those numbers declined sharply during the 1968 season, when he was able to play in only 9 games due to injury, and had averages of 6.6 points, 2.2 rebounds and 1.8 assists per game. Morales spent the 1969 BSN season sidelined and returned during the 1970 season, faring a bit better statistically-wise but also falling victim to injury again. During the 1970 season, Nelson Morales played in 11 BSN games, averaging 1.8 assists, 3.1 rebounds and 8.2 points per game. Once again, injuries hampered his career during 1970 and 1971, year in which he did not see action during the 1971 BSN season. In 1972, Morales returned to the BSN basketball courts, participating in 13 games for the Atleticos, scoring 6.6 points, passing for 2.0 assists and catching 1.5 rebounds for the Atleticos. Finally, Morales participated in 8 games during the 1973 BSN season for the Atleticos, with an average of 1.0 points and rebounds per game, without recording any assists.

It was crafted sometime in the mid to late 10th century in Constantinople. The box measures 48 centimeters by 35 centimeters and has a depth of 6 centimeters. This reliquary design was common in Byzantium beginning in the 9th century. The Limburg Staurotheke is currently housed in Germany in the Limburg an der Lahn.  Description and History  The interior of the Limburg Staurotheke with the True Cross reliquary in place. The Limburg Staurotheke consists of two parts that were made at separate times. The removable, double-armed cross was made first and holds seven fragments of the True Cross in the middle of the cross where its main set of arms meets. The cross is made out of sycamore wood and is entirely covered in gilded silver and embellished with gemstones and pearls. Inscribed on the back of the cross is the following verse: Translated from Medieval Greek. The two emperors mentioned in the inscription are Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos and Romanos II, his son. They ruled jointly from 945 to 959, meaning that the cross would have been constructed during their rule. The lid of the Limburg Staurotheke The box and its sliding, removable lid were made second and is designed to hold the cross reliquary in the center of the box. Surrounding the cross are ten enamel panels that depict angels wearing court outfits. Next to the angels are 10 more panels that each depict a pair of either cherubim or seraphim. The panels depicting the cherubim and seraphim are the containers that hold ten relics and each compartment has an inscription that identifies the relic housed inside. Six relics are Passion relics and are ascribed to Christ, three to the Virgin Mary, and one to John the Baptist. The relics in the compartments of the theke are: * The swaddling clothes of Jesus * The sponge used to give Christ water during his crucifixion * The crown of thorns worn by Christ during his crucifixion * The winding sheet Christ was wrapped in while in his tomb * The towel used by Christ to wash the feet of his Apostles during the Last Supper * The purple himation worn by Christ during his crucifixion (mentioned in John 19:2) * The belt of the Virgin Mary from Chalkoprateia * The belt of the Virgin Mary brought from Zela * The maphorion of the Virgin Mary * Locks of hair from St. John the Baptist Close up of Christ Pantocrator on the middle enamel panel of the lid of the Limburg Staurotheke The lid of the box, like the cross and inner compartments of the theke, is covered in gilded silver and lavishly decorated with gemstones. It features nine enamel panels that portray the Deesis, a scene that depicts Christ in a throne, accompanied by the Virgin Mary and St. John the Baptist and surrounded by angels. On the lid of the Limburg Staurotheke, Christ is seen in the middle panel, with John the Baptist to his left and the Virgin Mary to his right. The archangels Gabriel and Michael stand next to John the Baptist and the Virgin Mary. The top and bottom panels portray the twelve Apostles. On an outer border framing the panels are the busts of eight unidentified figures, though they are likely images of four military saints and four important church leaders. The theke itself features an inscription on the outer rim that states: Translated from Medieval Greek. The inscription reveals that Basil Lekapenos was the benefactor of the staurotheke. Basil was the bastard son of Emperor Romanos I Lekapenos and was made a eunuch likely as a child. He would become a powerful figure in the imperial court. Emperor Nikephoros II Phokas gave him the title of proedros in 963. The theke was likely made between 963 and 985, when Basil was exiled from the imperial court.

Modern taste prefers his consort music, where his reputation in the 18th century was for liturgical music and anthems. His Hymnus Eucharisticus beginning Te O Patrem colimus is sung annually on Magdalen Tower on May day morning. Life Born at Windsor, and baptised at the church of New Windsor on 2 June 1614, he was son of George Rogers of Windsor. He was a chorister of St. George's Chapel under Nathaniel Giles, and then a lay clerk. In 1639 Rogers succeeded Randolph Jewett as organist of Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin. The outbreak of the Irish rebellion of 1641 drove him back to England, and he returned as singingman to Windsor; the choral services there were discontinued around 1644. Occupied with composition and teaching, Rogers maintained himself, with the help of a small government allowance, in the neighbourhood of Windsor. With Oliver Cromwell's mandate, dated 28 May 1658 and probably through Nathaniel Ingelo, Rogers obtained the degree of Bac. Mus. at Cambridge. For the city banquet given to Charles II to celebrate the English Restoration of 1660, he supplied the music both to a hymn by Ingelo and to Psalm 32. He was reappointed lay clerk of St. George's Chapel, was substitute at the organ for William Child, and played the cornett. May Day 2007, crowds gather at Magdalen College, Oxford to hear the Hymnus Eucharisticus by Benjamin Rogers sung from the Tower Rogers won high reputation in England by his music for the Church of England and by his reorganisation of major choirs. In 1662 he was also appointed organist to Eton College. Invited by Thomas Pierce to Magdalen College, Oxford, he took over the organ and choir there in 1665, with a salary and college rooms. On 8 July 1669 he proceeded Mus. Doc. at Oxford. In January 1686 Rogers lost his college place at Magdalen. Unpopular with the choir, and a loud talker in the organ loft during services, he was lodging in his rooms his daughter, who was pregnant by the college porter. He was also claiming those rooms were haunted. He took a college pension. Rogers retired to New Inn Hall Lane, Oxford, and died there, aged 84, in 1698. He was buried on 21 June at Church of St Peter-le-Bailey. Works By 1653, consort music by Rogers was heard at the court of the future Emperor Leopold. When Ingelo went as chaplain to the Swedish embassy under Bulstrode Whitelocke, he presented to Queen Christina some of Rogers's music, which was performed by her Italian musicians. His Court-Masquing Ayres were well-received in Holland. Rogers's major works were in collections of cathedral music. Anthems were preserved in college and cathedral libraries. Family Rogers was married to Ann, who survived him by a few months. Their son John, born in 1654, was B.A. 1674, M.A. 1677, and clerk 1674–81.

On his return he was appointed prosector and anatomy lecturer at the Karolinska Institute. From 1854 he was appointed temporary professor at the Veterinärinrättningen i Skara (which became the Swedish Veterinary Institute in 1867), becoming an acting professor from 1856 and full professor from 1859 until 1888. He also acted as a director there 1856 to 1862 and 1872–1886. He was one the founding members of the Swedish Veterinary Association and its first chairman. Kinberg submitted an award-winning zoological thesis to the University of Uppsala in 1863, Synopsis suturarum et epiphysium. He also published a number of papers on new species of Annelida collected on the Eugenie expedition between 1865 and 1867 which were reissued posthumously in Uppsala as a single volume published in 1910Kinberg JGH (1910) Kongliga svenska fregatten Eugenies resa omkring jorden under befäl af C.

Dutch plan vast windfarm island in North Sea. Guardian, 29 December 2017. One or more “Power Link” artificial islands will be created at the northeast end of the Dogger Bank, a relatively shallow area in the North Sea, just outside the continental shelf of the United Kingdom and near the point where the borders between the territorial waters of Netherlands, Germany, and Denmark come together. Dutch, German, and Danish electrical grid operators are cooperating in this project to help develop a cluster of offshore wind parks with a capacity of several gigawatts, with interconnections to the North Sea countries. Undersea cables will make international trade in electricity possible. According to this plan, the first artificial island will have an area of 6 square kilometers. Thousands of wind turbines will be placed around the island, with short alternating-current links to the island. On the island itself, power converters will change the alternating current to direct current that will be carried to the mainland via undersea cables.(Dutch) nrc.nl - Stroomfabriek Doggersbank The Hub – one island at first, and later one or two more – is intended to make a substantial contribution to the energy transition and to achieving the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015. The project is to be completed around 2050.(Dutch) nrc.nl - Tennet wil energie-eiland In June 2016, nine countries – the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, Luxemburg, France, Denmark, Ireland, Norway, and Sweden – signed an agreement to cooperate in planning and building offshore wind parks.(Dutch) nrc.nl - Stroomfabriek Doggersbank The goal is to reduce costs as quickly as possible and thus make the wind parks more economically viable. A study commissioned by Dutch electrical grid operator TenneT reported in February 2017 that as much as 110 gigawatts of wind energy generating capacity could ultimately be developed at the Dogger Bank location. North Sea Wind Power Hub Consortium At the North Seas Energy Forum in Brussels on 23 March 2017, TenneT Netherlands, TenneT Germany, and the Danish Energinet.dk signed a trilateral agreement to cooperate in further development of the project. These network managers hope that Norway, the United Kingdom, and Belgium will also join them. In September 2017, Dutch gas-grid operator Gasunie joined the consortium, suggesting converting wind power to gas and using near offshore gas infrastructure for storage and transport.'Gasunie to join North Sea Wind Power Hub consortium'. TenneT News 09/13/2017. In November 2017, the Port of Rotterdam became the fifth member of the consortium.

It is an open, straggly shrub with hairy branches, three-part leaves and white flowers in groups of up to twelve, the groups longer than the leaves and each flower with four petals and four stamens. Description Zieria exsul is an open, weak, straggly shrub which grows to a height of and has relatively smooth but hairy branches. The three- part leaves have a petiole long and a central leaflet which is egg-shaped, long, wide with the other two leaflets slightly smaller. The upper surface of the leaf is slightly hairy but the lower surface is densely hairy with woolly, star-shaped hairs. The flowers are white and are arranged singly or in groups of up to twelve in leaf axils on a mostly glabrous stalk long, the groups longer than the leaves. The sepals are more or less triangular, about long and wide and the four petals are elliptic in shape, about long and wide. The four stamens are less than long. Flowering occurs mostly occurs between August and September and is followed by fruit which is a glabrous capsule, about long and wide. This species is similar to Zieria compacta except that it is a more straggly shrub and has glabrous flower stalks. Taxonomy and naming Zieria exsul was first formally described in 2007 by Marco Duretto and Paul Forster from a specimen collected in Caloundra and the description was published in Austrobaileya. The specific epithet (exsul) is a Latin word meaning \\"a banished person\\" referring to this species having been displaced from most of its probable former range.

A totaliser allows the votes cast in about 14 polling booths to be counted together. At present, the votes are tallied booth by booth. Functioning Totaliser with EVMs Bharat Electronics Limited, Bengaluru, and Electronics Corporation of India Limited, Hyderabad, developed the totaliser. Totaliser is an interface, which is connected to main control unit of a cluster of 14 EVMs and the consolidated count of votes cast for each candidate in that group of EVMs can be obtained by pressing the result button in the totaliser without disclosing the votes polled by a candidate area-wise. History A Public Interest Litigation has been filed in Supreme Court in 2014 seeking a direction to the poll panel to mix up the votes cast in the various polling stations in a constituency, to prevent the candidates intimidating voters in areas that had rebuffed them. Election Commission of India initially suggested the measure to UPA Government in 2008. During the 2014 Indian general election, former Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar allegedly threatened the voters that his party, the Nationalist Congress Party, would be able to detect the voting patterns from the electronic voting machine readings and cut off their water supply if they snubbed it in the constituency of Baramati. The Law Commission said the Totaliser would also help in situations such as that witnessed in the constituency of Hoshangabad in 2014, where a lone voter voted at the Mokalvada polling station in the Sohagpur area. Before the introduction of electronic voting machines in India, ballot papers were mixed wherever necessary to prevent disclosure of the voting patterns. In February 2017, NDA Government opposed totaliser in its affidavit in Supreme Court, while Law Commission of India and the Election Commission of India had favoured the introduction of a totaliser. Congress, NCP and BSP “categorically” supported its proposal to use ‘totaliser’ machine while BJP, Trinamool Congress and PMK opposed totaliser.

Her work covers a broad range of various media in which the term \\"Internet Awareness\\" plays an important role. With ancient techniques and material experiments, she sets a counterpoint to the pervasive digital world. Schober uses photography and freeze-frames, creates digital and analog collages and (re-)digitizes, paints over, or applies material objects to them. She integrates intentionally or randomly created structures elsewhere in her work. A major topic in Schober's work is a dynamic play with perspective and dimensions which continuously destabilizes the position of the viewer. The spontaneous, the accidental and art-trouvé is as important as the artist's personal involvement with the object or the topic.

Distribution Pempheris vanicolensis has an Indo-Pacific distribution but the precise distribution is subject to some controversy. The distribution of P. vanikolensis sensu stricto is from the Andaman Sea east through the Malay Archipelago to New Guinea and the Solomon Islands where the type specimen was collected at Vanikoro. Biology Pempheris vanicolensis occurs in shallow water, normally no deeper than 100m, in tropical and subtropical seas often on coral reefs. It is the host of the intestinal nematode Rhabdochona Indiana. It is found in schools in and around sheltered rocky and coral reefs. It shelters under ledges, in caves, harbours and shipwrecks during the day. It feeds on zooplankton foraging high in the water column during the night. Taxonomy Pempheris vanicolensis was named in 1831 by the French zoologist Georges Cuvier from specimens collected in Vanikoro in the south west Pacific Ocean. It was thought to have a wide distribution from the Red Sea to the Solomon Islands and even into the Mediterranean as a Lessepsian migrant but recent work has shown that it does not occur in the Red Sea and that records of this species in the western Indian Ocean are misidentifications of related species.

It may have been intended as a defensive tower which became redundant as times became more peaceful as the Middle Ages progressed in Sweden. The church has been rebuilt and expanded several times. During a renovation of the altar in 1733 a patch of parchment was discovered that noted the date of a re-inauguration of the church to 1298.

Brisbane had entered the grand final as undefeated, conceding only one draw during the season, while Adelaide conceded two losses, including a three-point loss to Brisbane in the fifth round. In the weeks prior to the match, concern centered around the venue of the match. While Brisbane opted to host the game at their traditional home ground, the Gabba, the issue of damage to its pitch as a result of the Adele Live 2017 concert held three weeks prior, and its management by ground curator Kevin Mitchell, became the subject of public controversy and tension between the club, the AFL and Gabba management. Due to the venue's condition, the match was moved to Metricon Stadium, to act as a curtain-raiser to the round one \\"QClash\\" of the 2017 AFL season. Background The inaugural season of the AFL Women's competition, which featured eight teams, made use of a best-two qualification system straight through to the grand final, instead of a finals series system similar to the Australian Football League (AFL). The top two teams on the premiership ladder at the end of a seven-round home-and-away season would compete for the premiership in the grand final. The team that wins the minor premiership also wins the rights to host the match. The date of the match was set for 25 March, serving as a curtain-raiser match for the first round of the 2017 AFL season. The match was scheduled for an early afternoon start at 1:00 pm Australian Eastern Standard Time to boost attendance and television ratings, when no AFL matches were occurring—the first match of the day, a clash between and , was scheduled for a 4:35 pm start time. Three days before the match, the starting time was changed to five minutes earlier (12:55 pm) due to the application of the heat policy, with the quarter and half-time breaks extended. =Qualification= { class=\\"wikitable floatright\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - !colspan=\\"11\\"  2017 AFL Women's season ladder (top 4) - !width=\\"20\\"  !Team !width=\\"20\\"  !width=\\"20\\"  !width=\\"20\\"  !width=\\"25\\"  !width=\\"25\\"  !width=\\"30\\"  !width=\\"20\\"  -style=\\"background: #ccffcc;\\" 1style=\\"text- align:left;\\"601224128151.426 -style=\\"background: #ccffcc;\\" 2style=\\"text-align:left;\\"520291185157.320 -style= 3style=\\"text-align:left;\\"520258183141.020 -style= 4style=\\"text-align:left;\\"331261232112.514 } Entering as wooden spoon favourites, remained undefeated by the end of 2017 season, conceding only a draw with out of the season's seven games. After defeating the in round six and securing their sixth straight win, Brisbane mathematically qualified for a place in the 2017 AFL Women's Grand Final. After , the second placed team, lost their sixth round match against , Brisbane pulled away with two wins ahead of Adelaide at the beginning of the final round, securing the minor premiership and the right to host the grand final. For Melbourne to qualify for the grand final, they would have had to win their round seven match against and due to Adelaide's advantage on points for/against, Adelaide would have had to lose their match against . While Melbourne succeeded in defeating Fremantle by 54 points, the largest margin of the 2017 season, they were still behind Adelaide on point percentages. Adelaide secured their place in the grand final after a come-from-behind victory against Collingwood, noted for Sarah Perkins' four-goal performance. Both Adelaide and Melbourne finished the season with five wins and two losses, with Adelaide finishing with a 16.3 point percentage lead over Melbourne. The only match up between Adelaide and Brisbane before the grand final was Adelaide's 3-point loss to Brisbane in round five, which knocked Adelaide off the top of the ladder. =Venue= After Brisbane qualified to the grand final, the club pushed for the match to be held at their home ground, the Gabba. After a higher-than-anticipated turnout to games in the first round of the season, capacity became an issue to AFL Women's organisers, who considered holding the grand final at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in the event that a Melbourne team became minor premiers. The match would then serve as a curtain- raiser match for the AFL round one match between and , to be held at the ground at 7:25 pm. Docklands Stadium was ruled out due to an AFL clash between and at the stadium occurring at 4:35 pm—considered by organisers as not enough time between matches. As the season progressed, the likelihood rose of the match not being held in Melbourne, as Brisbane and Adelaide performed well in the first few rounds. Adelaide Oval was pinned by AFL general manager of football operations Simon Lethlean as a venue for the match if Adelaide hosted it, though the team's losses in rounds five and six prevented it from happening. With Brisbane being favourites to host, the Gold Coast Football Club lobbied to hold the grand final at Metricon Stadium to prevent splitting crowds with the \\"QClash\\" match between Gold Coast and the being held on the same day at 6:25 pm, a plan backed by Lethlean. An alternative proposal, however, suggested the match be held at the Brisbane Lions' traditional home ground, the Gabba. After Brisbane became minor premiers and earned the right to host the grand final, concern for the Gabba's capability to host the match was raised. Floorboards installed at the venue for the Adele Live 2017 concerts in early March were originally due to be completely removed, and the pitch restored by 1 April, a week after the match. Despite this, enthusiasm from fans to host the match at the Gabba was shared by club leadership, who publicly expressed their preference to play at the stadium, and by marquee players Tayla Harris and Sabrina Frederick-Traub, with Frederick-Traub stating, \\"it's an iconic stadium and I’d love to play there. It would be great for Queensland football.\\" The proposal was also supported by Queensland media, with some columnists such as Andrew Hamilton of The Courier-Mail criticising AFL Women's management for their organisation of the grand final. On 20 March, it was confirmed via a decision by the Department of National Parks, Sport and Racing that Metricon Stadium would host the match, to be played six hours prior to the QClash which takes place later the same evening at the venue. It was found that the Adele Live 2017 concert had damaged the turf at the Gabba, and that the ground's curator, Kevin Mitchell, had made the decision to replace the turf—a process which would not be finished in time for the grand final. While the decision was praised by the Gold Coast, both Brisbane and AFL management publicly expressed their dissatisfaction, putting the blame on Mitchell and the Gabba's management and ground curator. The club accused Mitchell of prioritising the 2017–18 Ashes series, claiming that the cricket pitch had already been sewn in advance of the series' first test, which would occur over seven months after the grand final. Brisbane chief executive Greg Swann said the club had been \\"absolutely let down by the ground staff\\" at the Gabba and that \\"those responsible for managing the field of play should be held accountable for a decision that has denied our women's team the right to create history in front of our loyal supporters.\\" Teams The teams were announced on 23 March, with both teams opting to go into the match unchanged from the final round of the home and away season. {  valign=\\"top\\"   valign=\\"top\\"  } Scorecard Media coverage The 2017 AFL Women's Grand Final was broadcast on the Seven Network, as part of a broadcasting rights deal that saw Seven West Media gain broadcasting rights to all matches of the 2017 AFL Women's season, airing on the Seven Network, 7mate, or the video on demand service, PLUS7.

Another aim of the operation was to gain control of the water source for Aleppo city, at the Khafsa Water Treatment Plant, in addition to capturing the Jirah Military Airbase. At the same time, the Turkish-backed rebel groups turned towards the east and started launching attacks against the Syrian Democratic Forces, west of Manbij.  Offensive  = Syrian Army push to al-Bab = On 17 January, the Syrian Army launched an assault led by its Tiger Forces, capturing a village to the south of al-Bab. The SAA captured four more villages to the south of the city within the next three days, and another 13 villages to the southwest of al-Bab between 21 and 24 January. By 29 January, 20 villages had come under Army control. On 1 February, the Turkish-backed rebels captured two villages to the southwest of al-Bab, cutting the main road between the city and Aleppo from another side in front of the recent advances by pro-Syrian government forces who had come within . Meanwhile, the SAA also captured a village to the south of the Kuweires airbase. By 5 February, the SAA was within two kilometers of cutting the last road into al-Bab, with support from Hezbollah and Russian artillery. The next day, they captured Tal Uwayshiya hill, which overlooks the main supply route to al-Bab. The SAA advance effectively cut off the last main supply route to the city, putting it under a siege. Government advances continued on 7 February, with SAA and Hezbollah capturing three villages and a nearby hill to the south of Al-Bab. They later captured a hill and many other sites to the south of the Kuweires airbase, extending their control over Sabkhat al-Jabbul and fully securing the road near it. Later on the same day, it was reported that the rapid Syrian Army advances had nearly encircled 5,000 ISIL militants within Al-Bab and its environs. During the night of 7 February, Turkish forces and rebels launched an assault at Al-Bab, capturing several strategic hills and breaking into the city. On 9 February, the Syrian Army was within of al-Bab. On the same day, the rebels clashed with the Syrian Army for the first time near al-Bab, in a village to the southwest of the city. = Syrian Army advance east of al-Bab = After the Syrian Army advanced within of the city of al-Bab on 10 February, the next day, it was reported that Turkish-backed rebel forces had captured a strategic roundabout, effectively cutting off the Syrian Army from Al-Bab. To prevent further southern advances by the rebels, the military started operations east of Kuweires Airbase into ISIL territory so to cut off the rebels. Between 12 and 16 February, the Syrian Army captured nine villages northeast of the airbase, advancing some four kilometres and coming within five kilometres of the ISIL-held town of Dayr Hafir. Between 21 and 25 February, the military seized a dozen more villages and imposed artillery fire-control over Dayr Hafir. The Army started bypassing Dayr Hafir in an attempt to encircle it and force ISIL forces to withdraw instead of launching a direct assault on the town due to the possibility of extensive ISIL fortifications. On 25 February, amid a large retreat of ISIL forces from rural areas of east Aleppo, and following the fall of Al-Bab to Turkish-backed rebel forces, it was reported that most of ISIL's fighters had withdrawn from the town of Tadef. At this point, it remained unclear whether the town would be taken over by pro-government or rebel fighters. The next day, the Syrian Army entered Tadef and took control of the town. Subsequently, clashes erupted near Tadef between the Army and Turkish- backed rebels. The rebels claimed that at least 22 Syrian soldiers were killed in the fighting, while at least six rebels also died. Still, despite this, the military continued with its advances, seizing another two villages. Early on 27 February, government forces and Hezbollah seized another village from ISIL, bringing them within 5 or 6 kilometers from linking up with the Syrian Democratic Forces' Manbij Military Council and potentially besieging 13 ISIL- held villages. Later in the morning, the Syrian Army captured several more villages, reaching SDF lines. Turkish-backed rebels also took control of five villages after ISIL forces withdrew from those areas. The SDF then launched an assault against ISIL southwest and south of Manbij, capturing nine villages. It was reported that the SDF was planning to capture the town of Al-Khafsa from ISIL, as well as that the SDF and SAA may be coordinating their actions in the region. During the day, it was reported by Sputnik News that Russia had mediated another ceasefire between the Syrian Army and Turkish-backed FSA forces in the area. = Rebel attack on the SDF; SAA reaches Lake Assad = US Humvees drive through a SDF-controlled village near Manbij in an attempt to \\"deter\\" the skirmishes between the SDF and Turkish-backed forces. On 28 February, both Syrian Army and SDF advances against ISIL continued with both sides capturing a total of five villages. Turkish-backed rebels meanwhile attacked the SDF near Arima and captured two villages. During the day, according to lieutenant general Stephen J. Townsend of the United States Army, the Russian Air Force accidentally bombed the Syrian Democratic Forces forces, mistaking them for ISIL fighters. The bombing caused casualties but was stopped after United States commandos nearby informed Russian forces of the error. On 1 March, the SDF captured five more villages from ISIL, while the Syrian Army took control of one more. Meanwhile, the Turkish-backed rebels made a push towards SDF-held Manbij and captured three villages from the SDF before the SDF recaptured them the following day. Six or 12 rebels were killed in the fighting, while the SDF lost four fighters. On 2 March, the Manbij Military Council announced that it had reached an agreement with Russia to hand over villages to west of Manbij, bordering the frontline with rebel forces, to the Syrian government in the coming days. A YPG spokesman, meanwhile, stated that they hadn't sent any reinforcements to the area as they hadn't been requested. SDF also launched a counter-attack, retaking several villages that had been captured by the rebels a day earlier. The Syrian army and Hezbollah meanwhile continued advancing and captured 13 villages from ISIL by the next day. Russian General Staff's Sergey Rudskoy confirmed on 3 March that SDF had agreed to hand over villages to the west of Manbij to the Syrian government. He later stated that Syrian Army units had been deployed in these villages. The United States Department of Defense also confirmed the deal. On 4 March, United States special operations forces were also deployed in Manbij in response to the clashes. The United States military stated that its deployment was done to deter hostile acts, enhance governance, and ensure that there is no persistent YPG presence. Meanwhile, the Syrian Army, backed by Hezbollah and Russian artillery, captured 5 villages from ISIL, and another 8 on the next day. Syrian Army soldiers in a village west of Manbij, acting as peacekeepers. On 6 March, the Syrian Army captured six villages from ISIL. Manbij Military Council meanwhile stated that Syrian Army had taken over positions on one part of its frontline with the Turkish-backed rebels. Pro- rebel media meanwhile claimed that the rebels had captured a village to the west of Manbij, pro-Kurdish media, however, rejected this, claiming the attack was repelled. On 6 March, it was also revealed that SDF forces were allowing the Syrian Army to enter 20 villages and towns along the frontline with rebel forces, after which they would reportedly withdraw. On 7 March, the Syrian Army captured 23 more villages in the Deir Hafer countryside along with the strategic Mount Salmah, the town of Khafsah and its water treatment station supplying the city of Aleppo, reaching the western bank of Lake Assad in the process for the first time since 2012. On the next day, the Syrian army captured 21 villages. On 9 March, the Syrian Army started attacking the strategic Jirah Military Airbase. However, by afternoon of 10 March their assault was repelled by ISIL which took advantage of a sandstorm to overrun Syrian Army north of the Airbase. During the offensive in the eastern countryside of Aleppo, from 17 January to 10 March, the Syrian Army recaptured 150 villages. = Syrian Army captures Dayr Hafir = The Tiger Forces abandoned attempts to capture Jirah Airbase, due to poor weather conditions, and instead decided to focus on villages east of the Kuweires Military Airport. On 13 March, the Syrian army captured the village of Humaymah Al- Kabira and stormed the northern part of Humaymah Al-Saghira capturing it after two hours of fighting, thus coming within 2 kilometres from the town of Dayr Hafir. On 14 March, the ISIL launched the counterattack in attempt to recaptures two villages from the Syrian army but it was repelled. Between 15 and 16 March, the Syrian army captured eight to nine villages near Dayr Hafir. On 17 March, the Syrian Army captured another 4 villages along with a hill near Dayr Hafir. On the next day, it captured 4 villages along with a strategic hill near Dayr Hafir. On 19 March, they captured a village as well as its surrounding farmlands to the south of Dayr Hafir. On the next day, the Syrian army captured another two villages along with a nearby train station, thus coming close to cutting off the main road between Dayr Hafir and Maskanah. On 21 March, the Syrian Army captured another three villages to the south of the city Dayr Hafir. On the next day, the Syrian Army and Hezbollah captured the town of Umm Adasah in the countryside of Dayr Hafir, cutting off the Aleppo-Raqqa highway which was ISIL's main supply route. Later, the Syrian army captured four more villages in the countryside, nearly encircling ISIL at the city of Dayr Hafir, and leaving only one route open to the northeast for ISIL militants in the city to escape. On 23 March, the Syrian Army captured four villages to the east of Dayr Hafir, cutting off the last escape route, and completely besieging the city. There were also reports that the Syrian Army had captured Dayr Hafir after ISIL withdrew. Nevertheless, the Syrian Army have not entered yet the city of Dayr Hafir, but they were expected they do so, after Syrian and Russian de-mining units clear the town of ISIL explosives. On 24 March, mines and improvised explosive devices were cleared from the city, allowing the Syrian Army to enter and fully secure the city of Dayr Hafir. The Syrian Army also captured a village to the east Dayr Hafir on the same day. However, the Iranian Fars News Agency as well as the fact- checking Verify-sy reported that SAA was still besieging the city. In addition, a pro-government reporter also posted denial by a field commander of the city's capture. On 25 March, the Turkish-backed rebels reportedly took control of the town of Tadef after a Syrian Army withdrawal from the town. However, the Syrian Army and the Sultan Murad Division denied these reports later. On the same day, the Syrian Army captured two more villages in the eastern Aleppo countryside, to the east of Dayr Hafir. Despite some earlier reports to the contrary, large parts of Dayr Hafir remained off-limits to the Syrian Army, since ISIL left behind improvised explosives in almost every building and street, which have not yet been completely cleared. On 26 March, the Syrian Army advanced further eastward, capturing another 4 villages. Another village along the Aleppo-Raqqa highway was captured on the next day, with the Syrian Army advancing on the strategic town of al-Mahdum. On 28 March, the Syrian army captured another four villages along with a hill. On 29 March, the Syrian army officially entered and fully secured the town of Dayr Hafir for the first time after demining most of the explosives and IEDs planted by ISIL at the entrance of the town. A military source announced that they had captured the town. =Advance on Jirah Airbase= The Syrian Army started clashing with ISIL around Jirah Airbase on 30 March, with ISIL trying to hold them off from progressing into the Raqqa Governorate. Clashes continued the next day, while both sides were unable to make any progress. On 1 April, ISIL repelled an SAA assault on Madhum village, located on the M4 Highway, by sending an elderly suicide bomber at the soldiers, killing 11 of them. The Syrian Army captured three villages near the airbase between 3 and 5 April.  Aftermath – Sporadic fighting continues and renewed offensive southward  Between 10 and 17 April, sporadic clashes and air raids took place around the Jirah airbase as the Syrian Army had temporarily paused the offensive because of the rebel offensive in northern Hama. ISIL's Inghimasi unit carried out a raid on forward positions of SAA near the Jabbul Lake on 17 April, killing many Syrian soldiers. ISIL's Amaq News Agency claimed that 17 soldiers were killed. On 8 May, the SAA resumed their offensive operations in the region, advancing towards the Jirah Airbase. On 12 May, the SAA captured the Jirah Airbase from ISIL, with the ISIL militants retreating southward into the Maskanah Plains. On 13 May, ISIL counterattacked at the Jirah Airbase, attempting to recapture the airbase from Syrian Government forces. However, the SAA repelled the ISIL assault and advanced further, capturing additional areas to the south of the Jirah Airbase.  Strategic analysis  After the Syrian Army severed the last strip of territory in eastern Aleppo that connected Turkish-backed rebels with ISIL, it was speculated by Al-Masdar News writer Chris Tomson that the rebels would either attack the Syrian Army or the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) if they were to advance deeper into Syria. Any such further acts would put Turkey at odds with either the United States or Russia. A trade route between Syrian government and SDF-held areas was opened at the end of February, with goods and services being exchanged between the two areas, and relatives being able to visit each other. Abdul Karim Saroukhan, head of the Kurdish-led administration, stated that the opening of a corridor to the Syrian Government-controlled west will have a positive impact and open new trade opportunities for the Kurdish region that had been under a \\"siege\\" by hostile parties, though advances in East Aleppo province by the Syrian Army had led to tensions with YPG in some areas. He also stated that there were no contacts with the Syrian Government over trade. The capture of Dayr Hafir has let the door wide open for a Syrian attack into the Raqqa Governorate, with the only obstacles being the Jirah Airbase and Maskanah. By the 28th of March, it looks inevitable that Jirah will fall, bringing with it the highly arable Dayr Hafir plain under the Syrian Army's full control, improving food security for Syria's citizens, and reaching the final defensive line for ISIL in east Aleppo, the narrow Thermopylae-like gap of the Maskanah plains.

PfEMP1 is synthesized during the parasite's blood stage (erythrocytic schizogony) inside the RBC, during which the clinical symptoms of falciparum malaria are manifested. Acting as both an antigen and adhesion protein, it is thought to play a key role in the high level of virulence associated with P. falciparum. It was discovered in 1984 when it was reported that infected RBCs had unusually large-sized cell membrane proteins, and these proteins had antibody-binding (antigenic) properties. An elusive protein, its chemical structure and molecular properties were revealed only after a decade, in 1995. It is now established that there is not one but a large family of PfEMP1 proteins, genetically regulated (encoded) by a group of about 60 genes called var. Each P. falciparum is able to switch on and off specific var genes to produce a functionally different protein, thereby evading the host's immune system. RBCs carrying PfEMP1 on their surface stick to endothelial cells, which facilitates further binding with uninfected RBCs (through the processes of sequestration and rosetting), ultimately helping the parasite to both spread to other RBCs as well as bringing about the fatal symptoms of P. falciparum malaria.

Malaria is the deadliest among infectious diseases, accounting for approximately 429,000 human deaths in 2015 as of the latest estimate by the World Health Organization. In humans, malaria can be caused by five Plasmodium parasites, namely P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae, P. ovale and P. knowlesi. P. falciparum is the most dangerous species, attributed to >99% of malaria's death toll, with 70% of these deaths occurring in children under the age of five years. The parasites are transmitted through the bites of female mosquitos (of the species of Anopheles). Before invading the RBCs and causing the symptoms of malaria, the parasites first multiply in the liver. The daughter parasites called merozoites then only infect the RBCs. They undergo structural development inside the RBCs, becoming trophozoites and schizonts. It is during this period that malarial symptoms are produced. Unlike RBCs infected by other Plasmodium species, P. falciparum-infected RBCs had been known to spontaneously stick together. By the early 1980s, it was established that when the parasite (both the trophozoite and schizont forms) enters the blood stream and infects RBCs, the infected cells form knobs on their surface. Then they become sticky, and get attached to the walls (endothelium) of the blood vessels through a process called cytoadhesion, or cytoadherence. Such attachment favours binding with and accumulation of other RBCs. This process is known as sequestration. It is during this condition that the parasites induce an immune response (antigen- antibody reaction) and evade destruction in the spleen. Although the process and significance of sequestration were described in detail by two Italian physicians Amico Bignami and Ettore Marchiafava in the early 1890s, it took a century to discover the actual factor for the stickiness and virulence. Discovery PfEMP1 was discovered by Russell J. Howard and his colleagues at the US National Institutes of Health in 1984. Using the techniques of radioiodination and immunoprecipitation, they found a unique but yet unknown antigen from P. falciparum-infected RBCs that appeared to cause binding with other cells. Since the antigenic protein could only be detected in infected cells, they asserted that the protein was produced by the malarial parasite, and not by RBCs. The antigen was large and appeared to be different in size in different strains of P. falciparum obtained from night monkey (Aotus). In one strain, called Camp (from Malaysia), the antigen was found to have a molecular size of approximately 285 kDa; while in the other, called St. Lucia (from El Salvador), it was approximately 260 kDa. Both antigens bind to cultured skin cancer (melanoma) cells. But the researchers failed to confirm whether or not the protein actually was an adhesion molecule to the wall of blood vessels. Later in the same year, they found out that the unknown antigen was associated only with RBCs having small lumps called knobs on their surface. The first human RBC antigen was reported in 1986. Howard's team found that the antigens from Gambian children, who were suffering from falciparum malaria, were similar to those from the RBCs of night monkey. They determined that the molecular sizes of the proteins ranged from 250 to 300 kDa. In 1987, they discovered another type of surface antigen from the same Camp and St. Lucia strains of malarial parasites. This was also a large-sized protein of about 300 kDa, but quite different from the antigens reported in 1984. The new protein was unable to bind to melanoma cells and present only inside the cell. Hence, they named the earlier protein Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1), to distinguish it from the newly identified Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 2 (PfEMP2). The distinction was confirmed the next year, with an additional information that PfEMP1 is relatively less in number. Although some of the properties of PfEMP1 were firmly established, the protein was difficult to isolate due to its low occurrence. Five years after its discovery, one of the original researchers Irwin Sherman began to doubt the existence of PfEMP1 as a unique protein. He argued that the antigen could be merely a surface protein of RBCs that changes upon infection with malarial parasites. A consensus was achieved in 1995 following the identification (by cloning) of the gene for PfEMP1. The discovery of the genes was independently reported by Howard's team and two other teams at NIH. Howard's team identified two genes for PfEMP1, and recombinant protein products of these genes were shown to have antigenic and adhesive properties. They further affirmed that PfEMP1 is the key molecule in the ability of P. falciparum to evade the host's immune system. Joseph D. Smith and others showed that PfEMP1 is actually a large family of proteins encoded by a multigene family called var. The gene products can bind to a variety of receptors including those on endothelial cells. Xin-Zhuan Su and others showed that there could be more than 50 var genes which are distributed on different chromosomes of the malarial parasite.  Structure  Typical structure of PfEMP1. NTS = N terminal segment. TMD = transmembrane domain. ATS = intracellular acidic terminal segment. PfEMP1 is a large family of proteins having high molecular weights ranging from 200 to 350 kDa. The wide range of molecular size reflects extreme variation in the amino acid composition of the proteins. But all the PfEMP1 proteins can be described as having three basic structural components, namely, an extracellular domain (ECD), a transmembrane domain (TMD) and an intracellular acidic terminal segment (ATS). The extracellular domain is fully exposed on the cell surface, and is the most variable region. It consists of a number of sub-domains, including a short and conserved N terminal segment (NTS) at the outermost region, followed by a highly variable Duffy-binding-like (DBL) domain, sometimes a Ca2+-binding C2 domain, and then one or two cysteine-rich interdomain regions (CIDRs). Duffy- binding-like domains are so named because of their similarity to the Duffy binding proteins of P. vivax and P. knowlesi. There are six variant types of DBL, named DBLα, DBLβ, DBLγ, DBLδ, DBLε and DBLζ. CIDR is also divided into three classes: CIDRα, CIDRβ and CIDRγ. Both DBL and CIDR have an additional type called PAM, so named because of their specific involvement in pregnancy- associated malaria (PAM). In spite of the diverse DBL and CIDR proteins, the extracellular amino terminal region is partly conserved, consisting of about 60 amino acids of NTS, one each of DBLα and CIDR1 proteins in tandem. This semi-conserved DBLα-CIDR1 region is called the head structure. The last CIDR region joins the TMD, which is embedded in the cell membrane. The TMD and ATS are highly conserved among different PfEMP1s, and their structures have been solved using solution NMR (). The head structure is followed by a variable combination of diverse DBL and CIDR proteins, and in many cases along with C2. This variation gives rise to different types of PfEMP1. The DBL-CIDR combination in a particular type of PfEMP1 protein is never random, but organized into specific sequences known as domain cassettes. In some domain cassettes, there are only two or few DBL domains and CIDR domains, but in others they cover the entire length of the PfEMP1. These differences are responsible for different binding capacity among different PfEMP1s. For instance, among the most well-known types, VAR3 (earlier called type 3 PfEMP1) is the smallest, consisting of only NTS with DBL1α and DBL2ε domains in the ECD. Its molecular size is approximately 150 kDa. In domain cassette (DC) 4 type, the ECD is made up of three domains DBLα1.1/1.4, CIDRα1.6 and DBLβ3. The DBLβ3 domain contains a binding site for intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1). This is particularly implicated with the development of brain infection. VAR2CSA is atypical in having a single domain cassette that consists of three N terminal DBLPAM domains followed by three DBLε domains and one CIDRPAM. The seven domains always occur together. The usual NTS is absent. The protein specifically binds to chondroitin sulphate A (CSA); hence the name VAR2CSA. Synthesis and transport Model of a knob structure of P. falciparum-infected RBC showing attachment of PfEMP1. The PfEMP1 proteins are regulated and produced (encoded) by about 60 different var genes, but an individual P. falciparum would switch on only a single var gene at a time to produce only one type of PfEMP. The var genes are distributed in two exons. Exon 1 encodes amino acids of the highly variable ECD, while exon 2 encodes those of the conserved TMD and ATS. Based on their location in the chromosome and sequence, the var genes are generally classified into three major groups, A, B, and C, and two intermediate groups, B/A and B/C; or sometimes simply into five classes, upsA, upsB, upsC, upsD, and upsE respectively. Groups A and B are found towards the terminal end (subtelomeric) region of the chromosome, while group C is in the central (centromeric) region. Once the PfEMP1 protein is fully synthesized (translated), it is carried to the cytoplasm towards the RBC membrane. The NTS is crucial for such directional movement. Within the cytoplasm, the newly synthesized protein is attached to a Golgi-like membranous vesicle called the Maurer's cleft. Inside the Maurer’s clefts is a family of proteins called Plasmodium helical interspersed subtelomeric (PHIST) proteins. Of the PHIST proteins, PFI1780w and PFE1605w bind the intracellular ATS of PfEMP1 during transport to the RBC membrane. The PfEMP1 molecule is deposited at the RBC membrane at the knobs. These knobs are easily identified as conspicuous bumps on the infected RBCs from the early trophozoite stage onward. The malarial parasite cannot induce its virulence on RBCs without knobs. As many as 10,000 knobs are distributed throughout the surface of a mature infected RBC, and each knob is 50-80 nm in diameter. The export of pfEMP1 from Maurer's cleft to RBC membrane is mediated by binding of another protein produced by the parasite called knob-associated histidine-rich protein (KAHRP). KAHRP enhances the structural rigidity of infected RBC and adhesion of PfEMP1 on the knobs. It is also directly responsible for forming knobs, as indicated by the fact that kahrp gene-deficient malarial parasites do not form knobs. To form a knob, KAHRP aggregates several membrane skeletal proteins of the host RBC, such as spectrin, actin, ankyrin R, and spectrin–actin band 4.1 complex. Upon arrival at the knob, PfEMP1 is attached to the spectrin network using the PHIST proteins.  Function  Model of binding of RBC and WBC infected by P. falciparum to endothelial cells. The primary function of PfEMP1 is to bind and attach RBCs to the wall of the blood vessels. The most important binding properties of P. falciparum known to date are mediated by the head structure of PfEMP1, consisting of DBL domains and CIDRs. DBL domains can bind to a variety of cell receptors including thrombospondin (TSP), complement receptor 1 (CR1), chondroitin sulfate A (CSA), P-selectin, endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR), and heparan sulfate. The DBL domain adjacent to the head structure binds to ICAM-1. CIDRs mainly bind to a large variety of cluster determinant 36 (CD36). These bindings produce the pathogenic characteristics of the parasite, such as sequestration of infected cells in different tissues, invasion of RBCs, and clustering of infected cells by a process called rosetting. The RBC-binding site of PfEMP1.

(B) Detail of the RBC-binding site with bound molecules (yellow = C, blue =N, red = O). CIDR1 protein in the semi-conserved head structure is the principal and best understood adhesion site of PfEMP1. It binds with CD36 on endothelial cells. Only group B and C proteins are able to bind, and that too with only those having CIDRα2-6 sequence types. On the other hand, group A proteins have either CIDRα1 or CIDRβ/γ/δ, and they are responsible for the most severe condition of malaria. Binding with ICAM-1 is achieved through the DBLβ domain adjacent to the head structure. However, many PfEMP1s having DBLβ domain do not bind to ICAM-1, and it appears that only the DBLβ paired with C2 domain can to bind to ICAM-1. The DBLα-CIDRγ tandem pair is the main factor for rosetting, sticking together the infected RBC with the uninfected cells, and thereby clogging of the blood vessels. This activity is performed through binding with CR1. The most dangerous malarial infection is in the brain and is called cerebral malaria. In cerebral malaria, the PfEMP1 proteins involved are DC8 and DC13. They are named after the number of domain cassettes they contain, and are capable of binding not only endothelial cells of the brain, but also in different organs including brain, lung, heart, and bone marrow. Initially, it was assumed that PfEMP1 binds to ICAM-1 in the brain, but DC8 and DC13 were found incompatible with ICAM-1. Instead DC8 and DC13 specifically bind to EPCR using CIDRα sub-types such as CIDRα1.1, CIDRα1.4, CIDRα1.5 and CIDRα1.7. However, it was later shown that DC13 can bind to both ICAM-1 and EPCR. EPCR is thus a potential vaccine and drug target in cerebral malaria. VAR2CSA is unique in that it is mostly produced by the placenta during pregnancy (the condition called pregnancy-associated malaria, PAM, or placental malaria). The majority of PAM is therefore due to VAR2SCA. Unlike other PfEMP1, VAR2CSA binds to chondroitin sulphate A present on the vascular endothelium of placenta. Although its individual domains can bind to CSA, its entire structure is used for complete binding. The major complication in PAM is low-birth-weight babies. However, women who survived the first infection generally develop an effective immune response. In P. falciparum-prevalent regions in Africa, pregnant women are found to contain high levels of antibody (immunoglobulin G, or IgG) against VAR2CSA, which protect them the placenta- attacking malarial parasite. They are noted for giving birth to heavier babies. Clinical importance In a normal human immune system, malarial parasite binding to RBCs stimulates the production of antibodies that attack the PfEMP1 molecules. Binding of antibody with PfEMP1 disables the binding properties of DBL domains, causing loss of cell adhesion, and the infected RBC is destroyed. In this scenario, malaria is avoided. However, to evade the host's immune response, different P. falciparum switch on and off different var genes to produce functionally different (antigenically distinct) PfEMP1s. Each variant type of PfEMP1 has different binding property, and thus, is not always recognized by antibodies. By default, all the var genes in the malarial parasite are inactivated. Activation (gene expression) of var is initiated upon infection of the organs. Further, in each organ only specific var genes are activated. The severity of the infection is determined by the type of organ in which infection occurs, hence, the type of var gene activated. For examples, in the most severe cases of malaria, such as cerebral malaria, only the var genes for the PfEMP1 proteins DC8 and DC13 are switched on. Upon the synthesis of DC8 and DC13, their CIDRα1 domains bind to EPCR, which brings about the onset of severe malaria. The abundance of the gene products (transcripts) of these PfEMP1 proteins (specifically the CIDRα1 subtype transcripts) directly relates to the severity of the disease. This further indicates that preventing the interaction between CIDRα1 and EPCR would be good target for a potential vaccine. In pregnancy-associated malaria, another severe type of falciparum malaria, the gene for VAR2CSA (named var2csa) is activated in the placenta. Binding of VAR2CSA to CSA is the primary cause of premature delivery, death of the foetus and severe anaemia in the mother. This indicates that drugs targeting VAR2CSA will be able to prevent the effects of malaria, and for this reason VAR2CSA is the leading candidate for development of a PAM vaccine.

Olson traveled to the UK to discuss details with the composer, who later credited him with influencing his compositions: \\"Much of the credit must go to Mel Olson … because, in telling me what he was looking for in a new choral work, he was telling me what thousands of other choral directors were looking for too.” Olson commissioned Rutter to compose \\"I will lift up mine eyes\\" (Psalm 121) for his church choir and orchestra at the First United Methodist Church in Omaha, where it was first performed one day after the Gloria. In 1976, Olson commissioned James E. Fritschel to write Give Ear, O Ye Heavens, after Deuteronomy 32:1 for unaccompanied double chorus, for The Voices of Mel Olson. Rutter dedicated his anthem The Lord is my Shepherd (Psalm 23, published in 1978), to Olson and his Chancel Choir of the First United Methodist Church. Edwin R. Fissinger composed on a commission of Olson for the Voices of Mel Olson To Everything There Is A Season, after Ecclesiastes III, for soprano, mezzo-soprano, tenor, speaker and choir, published in 1979 by Jenson Publications. Olson died in Nevada City, California.

Work Marianne Eigenheer, Untitled, from the series Bilder zur Lage, 1981/1982, watercolour on paper, 15 × 12.5 cm Eigenheer’s work has its roots in drawing, in which the freely moving line precedes the flat, pictorial dimension. Her drawings are gesticulating, free line works on paper, in which the spontaneous, subconscious action is combined with conscious formal and content-related decision-making. In the 1980s, the important series Bilder zur Lage, of postcard-sized drawings, was created. They are semiabstract forms and “mergers of entirely different beings,” which attain comic-like, erotic associations, symbolic elements and also a great dynamic. At this time, she also painted large canvases, as part of the series Misere des Herzens (Misery of the Heart), with animal silhouettes, human figures and hybrid beings, who seem to float or lie before monochrome backgrounds. Eigenheer describes the creation of these pictures as follows: Marianne Eigenheer, exhibition view, Les Guédés dansent toujours, Das Esszimmer, Bonn, 2012 Later came works on canvas and wall drawings, characterized by the use of red, black and gold, consisting mostly of borders, features and amorphous, semi-abstract forms and form developments.

Unveiled in 2009, it has been called \\"South Korea's most iconic statue.\\" The statue was constructed as part of the creation of new public space in central Seoul, the Gwanghwamun Plaza, located next to the Gyeongbokgung Palace complex. The statue of King Sejong was designed by Kim Yeong-won, a carving and modeling professor at Hongik University. Early plans for the Gwanghwamun Plaza included moving the statue of King Sejong from Deoksugung palace complex to the Gwanghwamun Plaza. However, after public discussions involving surveys of citizens and experts, it was decided to commission a new statue of King Sejong. Its design was chosen after a competition between a shortlist of artists recommended by the Korean Fine Arts Association and universities. The new statue was designed to be sitting, unlike the nearby older standing statue of Admiral Yi Sun-sin. King Sejong statue is located 250 meters from the other large statue on the Gwanghwamun Plaza, the statue of the Admiral Yi Sun-sin. The statue of King Sejong was dedicated on 9 October 2009, in a ceremony attended by attended by President Lee Myung-bak and other Korean government official, on a Hangul Day in celebration of the 563rd anniversary of the invention of the Korean alphabet by King Sejong, two months after the Gwanghwamun Plaza opening. The golden statue is 6.2 meters high (another source gives the statue height as 9.5 meters and yet another, 6.7 meters) and weights 20 tons. The king has one hand raised and another placed on a book. Sides of the statue display all of the hangul alphabet characters. In front of the statue there are small models of a celestial globe, a rain gauge, and a sundial, the invention of which is also traditionally attributed to King Sejong in Korea. While King Sejong is best remembered for his invention of hangul, he is also considered to have been involved in promotion of agriculture, literature, science and technology, as well as Confucian philosophy, in Korea. Near the statue a 'Sejong's Story' an exhibition hall, a small museum dedicated to King Sejong, can be found.

From 2014 to 2017 Klaubert served as Thuringia's Minister for Education, Youth and Sport.  Life  = Provenance and early years = Birgit Klaubert was born in Schöneck, a small town in the mountains to the east of Plauen in East Germany, and close to the country's frontier with the westernmost extent of Czechoslovakia. She attended school locally in Klingenthal, where passing her school final exams (\\"Abitur\\") opened the way to university level education. Between 1973 and 1977 she studied and qualified for a degree as a teacher of History and German at the Karl Marx University of Leipzig (as it was known at that time). Between 1977 and 1980 she worked as a teacher at the secondary school (\\"Polytechnische Oberschule\\") in Altenburg. After that, till 1983, she worked at Altenburg's teacher training institute. Between 1983 and 1986 she undertook a further period of study as an \\"Aspirantur\\" in the history department at the \\"Clara Zetkin\\" teacher training college in Leipzig. This led to a doctorate. Her dissertation was entitled \\"The struggle of Germany's free trades unions to organise women workers between 1896 and the outbreak of the Forst World War\\" (\\"Das Ringen der freien Gewerkschaften Deutschlands um die Organisierung der Arbeiterinnen von 1896 bis zum Ausbruch des 1. Weltkrieges\\"). After this she returned to teaching work at the teacher training institute in Altenburg, where she remained till 1994 when her political involvement translated into a full-time job and a seat in the Thuringian regional parliament (\\"Landtag\\"). = Politics = While growing she was, like almost all her contemporaries a member of the country's youth organisations, the Free German Youth (\\"Freie Deutsche Jugend\\" / FDJ) and the Pioneers. Birgit Klaubert was a candidate for membership of East Germany's ruling Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\" / SED) and the next year, which was the year of her twentieth birthday, she was accepted as a party member. Most sources are silent on her political involvement before 1989: a biographical note provided by the party of which she is now a member indicates that her political involvement included conducting classes and seminars for groups of children and trades unionists. The same source spells out that she never collaborated with the infamous Ministry for State Security (\\"Stasi\\"). Following reunification she became more politically involved. The old SED which had ruled in East Germany relaunched itself as the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), and set about adapting itself for a democratic future. Following further political realignments the party merged into a new party, called simply The Left (\\"Die Linke\\") in 2007. Throughout this period, initially at a municipal level and later on the regional stage, Birgit Klaubert remained active as a member of the party through its ups and downs. She was elected to the Altenburg town council in 1990. In 1994 she was elected to the Thuringian regional parliament (\\"Landtag\\"). Between 13 December 1995 and 12 September 1999, in succession to Ursula Fischer, she led the PDS group in the chamber. The focus of her own interests in the chamber was on \\"culture\\", as broadly defined. She was deeply interested in education and training matters. In 1999 she was elected one of the two vice-presidents of the Thuringian Landtag, regularly re-elected to the post till 2014. In 2013 the regional party executive proposed Klaubert as the party's lead candidate for Thuringia in the forthcoming general election. The nomination was supported by the local party committees, and on 2 March 2013 at meeting held at Friedrichroda party delegates voted on the matter. However, when the votes were counted Klaubert was found to have received only 59 of the 120 delegates' votes. Faced with this underwhelming endorsement she withdrew her candidacy. Commentators speculated that the unexpected outcome of the vote reflected general disenchantment with the local party executive rather than hitherto unidentified issues over Klaubert's own candidacy. After being appointed regional Minister for Education, Youth and Sport in the Ramelow Cabinet she took the opportunity - like Bodo Ramelow himself - to resign her seat in the Landtag. Klaubert announced her resignation due to illness on July 4, 2017. She was succeeded by Helmut Holter in August 2017.  Beyond politics  Birgit Klaubert is a member of the Board of Trustees of the Regional Centre for Political Education and a member of the REgional Memorials Council. She is also an honorary (unpaid) member of the Supervisory Board of the Altenburg- Gera theatre company.

It was built as the Victorian headquarters of Australian Catholic Assurance, a commercial insurance firm established with the aim of serving the Catholic community in Australia. The building was designed by Sydney-based architecture firm Hennessy & Hennessy, built in 1935-36, and has a twin in Sydney. The building is one of the most notable Art Deco office buildings in the city, with a City of Melbourne and National Trust heritage listing.  Architecture  The ACA Building is a clear example of Art-Deco; in Melbourne the vertically ribbed examples are described as \\"Commercial Gothic\\", due to their similarity with the first examples of this style, the strongly Gothic Manchester Unity Building. The ACA Building is unusual in that the material used on the facade is not the then typical cement render or faience, but rather \\"Benedict Stone\\", an artificial stone product manufactured by a company owned by the Brisbane Diocese of the Catholic Church. The stone shades in colour from darker at the base to lighter at the top of the tower. The design is strikingly vertical, dominated by the stepped silhouette of the central tower-like element, a continuation of the separately expressed central bay above the interwar height limit. The tower is given further prominence by the setback of the top two office floors either side, and the projecting ribs of the top four floors which also step back, and continue beyond the parapet, creating a lively skyline. The three level base is sparsely adorned, providing a platform for the verticality of the upper floors. The prominent entry is formed by a deep, two storey tall, inset within the central bay. The building is remarkably intact; the double height square bays of the ground floor are occupied by original bronze shopfronts, the prominent building name metal signage above is unchanged, and the lobby retains its black marble walls, signboard, light fittings and lifts. The Sydney building, located on King Street and now known as Charles Plaza, was completed in early 1936. The facade, also in pink artificial stone, has exactly matching details, but is taller, and addresses a corner, and so appears less vertical.

The ceremony is performed on the eleventh day of the King's death. In this ceremony a vegetarian Brahmin is made to eat an elaborate non-vegetarian meal, given various items belonging to the deceased King as gifts and made to wear clothing belonging to the deceased King in the belief that by doing so, the partaker will absorb all the bad karma of the dead king. The stigmatized Brahmin is then put on the back of an elephant and ordered to leave the kingdom. Many Nepalese believe that the Katto meal consists of parts from the body of the deceased King. However, Ramesh Prasad Pande, the Royal Brahmin of the Shah dynasty of Nepal who oversaw the rituals after the Royal massacre in 2001 revealed that no such thing occurs, and such hearsay are just myths.

History On December 18, 1882, the National Petroleum Exchange was opened. Sales that day equated to 150,000 barrels. On March 24, 1883, the New-York Mining and National Petroleum Exchange had a membership of 479. In 1883 the National Petroleum Exchange and the New York Mining Stock Exchange were consolidated, at which point Charles G. Wilson was elected president and held the office until 1900. The new exchange was named the New-York Mining Stock and National Petroleum Exchange. By December 1883, the New York Times wrote that \\"much interest\\" was being shown in a proposed consolidation between the competing New-York Petroleum Exchange and the New-York Mining Stock and National Petroleum Exchange. The matter was voted on by both exchange members on December 22, 1883. At the vote, members of the New-York Mining Stock and National Petroleum Exchange largely favored consolidation. However, the New- York Petroleum Exchange saw 269 in favor and 250 against, out of a total membership of around 688. Afterwards, a joint committee of three members from each Exchange was proposed, for the drafting of a new constitution and by-laws prior to any consolidation. On March 11, 1884, it was reported that the governing board of the New-York Mining Stock and National Petroleum Exchange had voted against consolidation 29 to 2. One of the reasons given was that the National Exchange treasury contained $204,000, while the New-York Petroleum Exchange only had $74,570. However, a resolution was passed that members of the New-York Petroleum Exchange could join the National Exchange.

A one-hour retrospective aired before the finale.  Plot  As Stefan and Caroline attempt to revive Bonnie, Bonnie enters the state between life and death and sees Elena and they reunite. Elena is shocked to see Bonnie, and says that it is too early. Bonnie doesn't mind being dead, saying that she will be with Enzo. Enzo then appears and comes up to the pair and tells Bonnie that it isn't her time and she returns to her body. Stefan and Damon return to the boarding house and find Elena's coffin opened with Elena standing there. Damon and Elena reunite and hug but she turns out to be Katherine instead. Stefan then stabs Katherine with the dagger made from her bones, but she comes back to Damon later, revealing that she can leave hell whenever she wants and that Cade had been under her control since her death. Meanwhile, Matt confronts Vicki and she reveals that she wants to die from the hellfire so she can escape hell, where she has been residing in a miserable existence. Vicki will ring the bell every five minutes until the end of the hour. After hearing this, Matt and the police evacuate the town. Alaric, Caroline, and the twins also leave Mystic Falls when Bonnie comes up with a plan to use her magic to reverse the hellfire back into hell, destroying it and Katherine. Damon stays with Katherine in the tunnels under the Armory to make sure she is in hell when Bonnie does this; Stefan comes forward to sacrifice himself instead, but Damon compels him to leave. However, Stefan was never compelled as there was vervain in his system. He hurries back into the tunnels, where he gives his blood to Damon, making Damon human. Stefan then takes Damon's place, and dies alongside Katherine. Though Bonnie struggles at first, the spirits of Enzo and her ancestors appear to give Bonnie the strength she needs. Caroline is seen in the car with Alaric, and he tells her Stefan's plan. She calls Stefan, in tears, and quotes \\"I will love you forever\\" with Alaric hearing those words. Stefan then visits Elena in their high school in the state between life and death, tells her what happened, and then joins Lexi and quotes \\"I was feeling epic\\" and hug in the afterlife.

After an emotional goodbye to Stefan Salvatore in the cemetery Elena conveys a message to Caroline which Stefan had told her; \\"I heard her. And I will love her forever too\\". The Salvatore boarding house is turned into a school for supernatural children with Jeremy and Dorian among the people running it and a hefty $3 million donation from Klaus. Vicki, Tyler, Liz, Jo, and Enzo are shown watching over the living. Damon and Elena are shown to be married. Elena is seen writing in the diary near Stefan's grave about how everything is as a crow flies and sits on a grave (a reference from the pilot of the show). After Damon and Elena's long lives shared together, Elena finds peace in the afterlife and reunites with her parents, John, and Jenna; and Stefan, at peace, opens the door to the boarding house, to see Damon, who greets him with \\"Hello, brother\\" and the brothers hug, having found peace after death and bringing the series to a conclusion.  Feature music  In \\"I Was Feeling Epic\\" the following songs are heard: * \\"Never Say Never\\" by The Fray * \\"Hold On\\" by Chord Overstreet * \\"Take on the World\\" by You Me At Six  Reception  The episode received critical acclaim, with most reviewers appreciating the writers’ skill in successfully ending the long eight-year run of the hit series in an emotion-driven finale. Kelly Lawler of USA Today praised the episode by calling it a “whirlwind finale” that “should have you alternating between sobbing and grinning.” Samantha Highfill of Entertainment Weekly said “the most impressive thing this finale did was find a way to honor every love story this show’s ever told. I can walk away feeling like I got closure on each and every one — and maybe a little hope on one in particular — all the while not one stands out as the ‘winner.’ And that’s not a small feat.” Caroline Preece of Den of Geek! praised the episode saying “True to form, a lot happened during I Was Feeling Epic, spanning decades of time and featuring more twists and turns than should really be allowed in a single hour. But this is The Vampire Diaries, and its biggest sin would have been if it was boring. [….] it’d be impossible for me to sum up what this show has meant to me and so many others over these past eight years.” TVLine’s Andy Swift said “The Vampire Diaries has always been a show about loss, about heartache, about powering through the difficult times in order to see the beauty in the world around you. And that’s exactly what this ending was — beautiful.” References External links  The Vampire Diaries Episode Listings * Recap from Official Website 2017 American television episodes The Vampire Diaries (season 8) episodes American television series finales Television episodes about death ","title":"I Was Feeling Epic"},{"id":"53451013","text":"Newsham railway station served the village of Newsham near Blyth, England from 1851 to 1964 on the Blyth and Tyne Railway. It was located at the junction of the Percy Main to and lines of the Blyth and Tyne Railway. The station was closed by British Railways in 1964, but it has been the subject of a reopening campaign since at least the 1990s.  History  The station was opened in summer 1851 by the Blyth and Tyne Railway. It was situated at the end of Seaton Avenue and Carlton Road, off South Newsham Road on the B1523. There was an extensive system of sidings at the station and The Railway Clearing House Handbook indicated that the station handled goods and livestock. The station was closed to passengers on 2 November 1964 and closed completely on 7 June 1965. Reopening proposals There have been proposals to reintroduce passenger services to part of the former Blyth and Tyne Railway system since the 1990s; Denis Murphy, the then Labour MP for Wansbeck, expressed support in the House of Commons in an adjournment debate in April 1999 and again in a debate in January 2007. The Railway Development Society (renamed Railfuture in 2000) also endorsed the proposal in 1998. Later, in 2009, the Association of Train Operating Companies published a £34 million proposal to restore passenger services from to . In the early 2010s, Northumberland County Council (NCC) became interested in the reintroduction of passenger services onto remaining freight-only sections of the network. In June 2013 NCC commissioned Network Rail to complete a GRIP 1 study to examine the best options for the scheme. The GRIP 1 study was received by NCC in March 2014 and in June 2015 they initiated a more detailed GRIP 2 Feasibility Study at a cost of £850,000. The GRIP 2 study, which NCC received in October 2016, confirmed that the reintroduction of a frequent seven-day a week passenger service between and was feasible and could provide economic benefits of £70 million with more than 380,000 people using the line each year by 2034. This study suggested that though Newsham station should be reopened to serve the village itself, Blyth would be better served by a dedicated park and ride station near to the former site of Bebside station which would be closer to both the town centre and the A189 dual carriageway. At the time it was suggested that, subject to funding being raised for the £191 million scheme, detailed design work could begin in October 2018 with construction commencing four months later and the first passenger services introduced in 2021 though by October 2018 such works were yet to begin. After receiving the GRIP 2 study, NCC initially announced that they were preceding with a GRIP 3 Study from Network Rail but such a report was not commissioned at the time. Despite a change in the political leadership of Northumberland County Council following the 2017 local elections the authority continued to work towards the reintroduction of a passenger service onto the line, encouraged by the Department for Transport's November 2017 report, A Strategic Vision for Rail, which named the line as a possible candidate for a future reintroduction of passenger services. Consequentially, NCC commissioned a further interim study in November 2017 (dubbed GRIP 2B) to determine whether high costs and long timescales identified in the GRIP 2 Study could be reduced by reducing the initial scope of the project but the report failed to deliver on this. The county council has, however, continued to develop the project, announcing an additional £3.46 million in funding for a further business case and detailed design study (equivalent to GRIP 3) to be completed by the end of 2019. However, the revised proposals, released in July 2019, are reduced in scope from the plan considered in the 2016 GRIP 2 study and propose 4-phase project to reduce the initial cost of the scheme. Indeed, under the £90 million Phase 1, Newsham would become the only station reopened to serve Blyth on the Newcastle to Ashington Northumberland Line passenger service; possibly occurring as early as 2022. The park and ride station at Bebside proposed in the GRIP 2 study is instead proposed as an additional station to be added in Phase 2. The North East Joint Transport Committee's bid for £377 million of funding from the UK Government's £1.28 billion Transfroming Cities Fund, submitted on 20 June 2019, includes £99 million to fund the reintroduction of passenger services between Newcastle and Ashington, while further work is ongoing to secure additional public and private investment for the project.

History PLLO Secretary Adelino Sitoy conceptualized of plans of a bridge connecting Cebu City to the town of Cordova, along with another bridge connecting Cebu City to the town of Jetafe, Bohol, since 2014.Sunstar Cebu, \\"Review on 3rd bridge almost done\\", October 20, 2014 The construction of the bridge was lobbied by then chairman of the Regional Development Council of Region VII, Michael Rama who was the Mayor of Cebu City at the time the Cebu–Cordova Bridge project was already awarded to a company. In January 2016, the Metro Pacific Tollways Development Corp. (MPTDC), through a disclosure to the Philippine Stock Exchange, announced that the construction of the bridge was to commence in 2017. The company in the same announcement said that they will be responsible for the construction and financing of the bridge, as well as its operation once its completed. The groundbreaking ceremony for the Cebu–Cordova Bridge was held on March 2, 2017. President Rodrigo Duterte joined the MPTDC and local officials for the event. The bridge was the first venture of the MPTDC outside of Luzon. The bridge is planned to be opened by 2021. Operation The CCLEX will be managed by the Metro Pacific Tollways Development Corp. Design Site where the Cebu-Cordova Link Expressway will be built. The bridge will span and will be the longest and tallest bridge in the Philippines, surpassing the San Juanico Bridge in Leyte and Samar. It is to be designed by the Spanish firms Carlos Fernandez Casado (CFC) and SENER Ingeniería y Sistemas, while the local firm DCCD Engineering Corp and the Danish firm COWI will be the owner's Engineer. The bridge is being built by a joint venture between Spanish firm ACCIONA, and Philippine firms FB and DMCI Connecting Cebu City and Cordova, the bridge is meant to serve an alternate route serving the Mactan Cebu International Airport, serving at least 40,000 vehicles daily. The main span of the CCLEX will be cable-stayed and will be supported by twin tower pylons. The design of the pylons was inspired from the historic Magellan's Cross. The main span will have a navigation clearance, which allow ships to traverse the bridge. Viaduct approach bridges and a causeway will also form part of the CCLEX, as well as toll road facilities on an artificial island. The toll facilities' design are inspired from the eight-rayed sun of the Philippine flag.

Despite its short length, many of its buildings are either registered on Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship heritage list, or are part of Bydgoszcz local history.  Location  The street is located in downtown Bydgoszcz. It connects the main thoroughfare Gdańska Street to the green area of Jan Kochanowski Park in Bydgoszcz and the Pomeranian Philharmonic building. Bismarck Straße ca 1908 History Although lined up with Cieszkowskiego Street, Słowackiego Street was established much later. The street appears on Bromberg maps between 1900 and 1908, boosted by city's main expansion, thanks to the development of the Prussian Eastern Railway. City population grew from 12,900 inhabitants in 1852 to 57,700 inhabitants in 1910. Słowackiego Street is listed as Bismarck Straße on Bromberg address book in 1905 for the first time: only the administrative building of the district, playing also the role of a courthouse (), is mentioned there. In 1906, the street bears already five numbers, almost as many as today. At the time, Bismarck Straße led from Danziger Straße to Bismarck Platz, where stands now the Philarmonia building, and further on to Eigenheim straße A, today's Kopernika Street. =Naming= Through history, the street bore the following names: * 1905–1920, Bismarck Straße, from Otto von Bismarck; * 1920–1939, Ulica Słowackiego;Plan Miasta Bydgoszczy, 1933 * 1939–1945, Bismarck Straße;Stadtplan Bromberg, 1941 * Since 1945, Ulica Słowackiego. Current namesake refers to Juliusz Słowacki (1809–1849) a Polish Romantic poet, one of the \\"Three Bards\\" of Polish literature (with Adam Mickiewicz and Zygmunt Krasiński), considered as a major figure in the Polish Romantic period, and the father of modern Polish drama.  Main places and buildings  =Tenement at N°1, corner with Gdańska Street= 1907-1908 Modern architecture The house was built in 1905-1906 by architect Alfred Schleusener, for a retired colonel of the Prussian army, Robert Grundtmann.

The investor was Wilhelm Blumwe, son of Carl Blumwe, a wealthy industrialist from Bydgoszcz. Carl Brumwe set up in 1865 a factory producing machines for wood located at Nakielska street 53, in Bydgoszcz. Carl Blumwe also had his own villa built nearby his factory in Nakielska Street. Since May 1, 1945, the villa hosts the seat and studios of the local radio, Radio PiK. The building has the classical shape of a palace, with a style referring to Palladian architecture, popular in Europe in the late 19th century.

Gdańska 50 (24).JPGFacade on Słowackiego Street =Tenement at N°3= 1904-1905, by Paul Böhm Eclecticism, Historicism The tenement was built at the beginning of the 20th century; its first owner was Paul Böhm, a famous Bromberg architect. He designed several other buildings in the city (Cieszkowskiego Street 1, 3 and Weyssenhoff Square 5). After the re-creation of the Polish State (1920), the tenement housed a part of the district administrative offices, together with the building at N°7: for this purpose, it underwent an interior remodeling led by architect Jan Kossowski. Today, it hosts the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship Health care services. The facade is characteristic of the eclectic style, mixing several references altogether. On the ground floor, the portal shows Neo-Baroque influences, with its Corinthian order columns and adorned lintel topped by finials and the large doors with semi-circular glass transom light. The second and third floor display more an early modern style, with clear geometrical shapes, attenuated by a nice wrought iron balcony. The top level abounds with German historicism references, especially by combining materials (plaster, wood, timber framing), shapes (balconies, loggias, ridge turret, dormer) and decoration motifs (Art Nouveau-like pattern). The style recalls clearly nearby tenements in Gdańska Street from architect Fritz Weidner (at 28 and 34).

The Peñol de Cerquín was a key Lenca stronghold during the Great Revolt of 1537 against the Spanish conquest.Gelliot undated, p. 1. The defences were formidable,Chamberlain 1953, 1966, p. 80. and the Lenca warleader Lempira strengthened the fortifications considerably, and used it as his base of operations. The hardened veteran Spanish conquistadores considered the fortress to be as strong as anything they had seen in Europe.Chamberlain 1953, 1966, p. 81. The first Spanish expedition to pass the Peñol was led by Pedro de Alvarado in early 1536, but he did not attempt an assault. A few months later Alvarado sent his lieutenant Juan de Chávez against the fortress; his initial assault was defeated, and the siege that followed it faltered due to supply problems. Over the next year, Spanish expeditions in the general region were moderately successful, and the Spanish considered the area pacified. Unknown to the Spanish, Lempira had been fortifying the Peñol in secret, and he amassed a great number of warriors and a great quantity of supplies there before openly declaring war in late 1537. The Spanish captain Alonso de Cáceres laid siege to the fortress at the beginning of November. In spring of 1538, Lempira agreed to a parley with the Spanish, and was shot dead during the negotiations. The surprise Spanish assault that followed quickly overran the demoralised defenders, and the fortress fell to the European invaders. Etymology Cerquín was the name of an ancient Lenca province, while peñol is Spanish, meaning a rocky crag, or butte.Royal Academia Española 2017. Location The Peñol de Cerquín is located in the southeast of the Lempira Department of Honduras, in Central America. The site lies within the municipality of Erandique.Gelliot, Costa, Mercier, Perrot-Minnot 2011, p. 7. The Peñol de Cerquín is to the south of the town, on the far side of the Sierra de las Neblinas, in the region of the hamlet of San Antonio La Mina.Gelliot, Costa, Mercier, Perrot-Minnot 2011, p. 21. Description The summit of the Peñol de Cerquín presents a ridge line with a surface area of approximately . The available surface area was increased by narrow terraces supported by retaining walls on both sides.Gelliot undated, pp. 1–2. Investigators Doris Stone and Federico Lunardi both described the site, and reported the presence of fortifications, retaining walls, and engraved rocks, as well as artefacts that included ceramic remains, metates, and worked obsidian.Gelliot undated, p. 1. Gelliot, Costa, Mercier, and Perrot-Minnot 2011, p. 2. Investigators in the 1940s climbed the Peñol and described finding the remains of a number of buildings, and the possible remains of a reservoir.Gelliot, Costa, Mercier, and Perrot- Minnot 2011, p. 16. There is a quantity of rock art at the site, either engraved or picketed depending upon the form. Small oval and sub-circular petroglyphs were made using the picketing technique, while quadrangular forms and a spiral were cut into the rock with unbroken lines. A polychrome ceramic fragment is similar in style to Late Classic (c. 600–900 AD) Maya ceramics of the Copán valley, and the presence of petroglyphs suggest that the Peñol de Cerquín had an early history as a sacred site, later pressed into service as a fortress by Lempira.Gelliot undated, p. 2. Spanish conquest Pedro de Alvarado passed close to the Peñol de Cerquín in 1536, with eighty mixed Spanish infantry and cavalry, and some 3000 native Guatemalan auxiliaries. Alvarado was anxious to relieve a beleaguered Spanish garrison elsewhere, so he did not attempt an attack against the gathered warriors in what was obviously a strong fortification, and passed onwards without engaging the defenders.Chamberlain, 1953, 1966, pp. 54–55. When Alvarado had established himself in the Naco valley of Honduras, he sent his lieutenant Juan de Chávez southwards with 40–50 Spanish soldiers, and 1500–2000 native auxiliaries.Chamberlain, 1953, 1966, p. 56. Chávez approached the Peñol de Cerquín towards the middle of 1536, to find it defended by a great many indigenous warriors who had gathered there to resist the Spanish. Chávez launched an assault against the fortress, but was beaten back before he could reach the base of the Peñol, so he laid siege to it. Chávez' force was short of supplies, and the natives had stripped the area of any food that the invaders could make use of. Given the strength of the fortress, his men became rebellious, and wished to return to their homes in Guatemala, and Chávez was forced to call off the siege.Chamberlain, 1953, 1966, pp. 57–58. Further Spanish expeditions in the general area were moderately successful, and they believed the region largely pacified.Chamberlain 1953, 1966,74, 79–80. However, the Lenca warlord Lempira was secretly gathering a strong force of warriors at the Peñol, together with weapons and provisions.Chamberlain 1953, 1996, pp. 79–80. Lempira fortified the already formidable natural defences and, in late 1537, he openly declared war against the Spanish. The natives, including women and children, abandoned their villages and lands and gathered at the fortress.Chamberlain 1953, 1996, p. 81. The Peñol de Cerquín was crucial to Lempira's rebellion against the Spanish, and successful resistance there was a powerful symbol to indigenous peoples throughout the province of Honduras and beyond.Chamberlain 1953, 1996, pp. 81–82. In response to the open challenge to Spanish authority, Francisco de Montejo, who had replaced Pedro de Alvarado as governor of Honduras,Olson and Shadle 1991, p. 284. despatched his lieutenant Alonso de Cáceres with eighty Spanish soldiers and a large number of native auxiliaries from Mexico and Guatemala. Cáceres arrived below the fortress around 1 November 1537. Cáceres immediately laid siege to the Peñol, hoping to starve the defenders into submission. There followed a series of attacks and counterattacks, and the Spanish closed the eight approaches to the mountain, although they were unable to make any advance. Five Spaniards died during the initial fighting, and many more were wounded, including Cáceres.Chamberlain 1953, 1966, pp. 82–83. Constant fighting dragged on for months, and the Spanish were unable to maintain supply lines through hostile territory and were often short of provisions. In spring of 1538 the rain season began, which added to the attackers' difficulties.Chamberlain 1953, 1966, p. 88. Desperate to bring the siege to a conclusion, Cáceres called a parley with Lempira. The Lenca general approached in full battle regalia, including feathered headdress and cotton armour. He refused Cáceres' demand that he submit, at which point a hidden Spanish arquebusier shot Lempira through the head.Chamberlain 1953, 1966, p. 89. This was the signal for a surprise Spanish assault, which quickly overran the shocked and demoralised defenders. The Peñol de Cerquín rapidly fell to the invaders. Many warriors surrendered without further resistance, while a portion of them fled into the surrounding mountains. Many elderly, women, and children were also captured by the Spanish.Chamberlain 1953, 1966, p. 89-90. Historical documents The Peñol de Cerquín was described in a letter from conquistador Francisco de Montejo to the king of Spain, dated 10 June 1539. Also in 1539, Spanish bishop Cristóbal de Pedraza wrote a report that included the testimonies of various Spanish soldiers who had been present at the siege of the Peñol de Cerquín. In the early 17th century, Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas produced his monumental Historia General de los Hechos de los Castellanos en las Islas y Tierra Firme del Mar Oceáno, which included an account of the battle of Cerquín.Gelliot, Costa, Mercier, and Perrot-Minnot 2011, pp. 9–10. Investigations The area of the Peñol de Cerquín was investigated by Italian archaeologist Federico Lunardi in the 1940s, and by the American archaeologist Doris Stone in the 1950s.Gelliot, Costa, Mercier, and Perrot- Minnot 2011, p. 11.

After finishing unplaced on her only run as a two-year-old she reached her peak in the following spring, winning a maiden race and the Derrinstown Stud 1,000 Guineas Trial before taking the Irish 1000 Guineas. She was well beaten in her only subsequent race and was retired at the end of the year. Background Bethrah is a brown mare with a small white star and a white sock on her left hind leg, bred in Ireland by Tullpark Ltd. As a foal in December 2007 she was put up for auction at Tattersalls but was bought back by Tullpark when the bidding stopped at 34,000 guineas. In September of the following year the yearling filly was entered in the Goffs Millian Sale and was bought for €160, 000 by Hamdan Al Maktoum's Shadwell Estate. She was sent ito training with Dermot Weld and was ridden in all of her races by Pat Smullen. She was sired by the Irish stallion Marju who finished second in The Derby and won the St James's Palace Stakes in 1991. Marju sired several other major winners including Soviet Song, My Emma, Viva Pataca, Indigenous and Satono Crown. Bethrah's dam Reve d'Iman showed little ability as a racehorse, finishing unplaced in all of her eight races. She was descendant of the influential British broodmare Point Duty (foaled 1926) who is the ancestor of many major winners including Sodium, Horse Chestnut and Madelia. Racing career =2009: two-year-old season= On her only appearance as a two-year-old Bethrah was one of twenty horses to contest the Goffs Million Sprint over six furlongs at the Curragh on 27 September. Starting at odds of 20/1 she was reluctant to enter the stalls and finished tenth, behind the British-trained Lucky General, beaten six and a quarter lengths by the winner. =2010: three- year-old season= Bethrah made her three-year-old debut in a maiden race over seven furlongs at Limerick Racecourse on 13 April and started the 4/9 favourite against five opponents. She took the lead from the start and drew away in the straight to win \\"comfortably\\" by three and a half lengths from Queen Commander. On 9 May the filly was stepped up in class and distance for the Group Three Derrinstown Stud 1,000 Guineas Trial over a mile at Leopardstown Racecourse. The joint-favourites were the Jim Bolger-trained Atasari (runner-up in the Rockfel Stakes) and the David Wachman-trained Picture Perfect with Bethrah the third choice in the betting on 5/1. After racing in fourth place she made steady progress in the straight, caught Atasari in the final strides and won by a neck. Two weeks after her win at Leopardstown Bethrah started a 16/1 outsider in a nineteen-runner field for the Irish 1000 Guineas on good to firm ground at the Curragh. The British- trained filly Music Show started the 3/1 favourite ahead of Gile Na Greine (third in the 1000 Guineas) and Lolly For Dolly (Athasi Stakes) while the other runners included Lillie Langtry, Anna Salai (Prix de la Grotte), Termagant (Moyglare Stud Stakes), Lady Springbank (C L Weld Park Stakes, Leopardstown 1,000 Guineas Trial Stakes), Song of My Heart (Blenheim Stakes) and Atasari. The pacemakers Full of Hope and Queen of Troy made the running before Anna Salai went to the front a furlong and a half from the finish. At this point Bethrah, who had raced towards racing towards the rear of the field and been in eleventh place at half way, began to make rapid progress and was then switched to the right to make her challenge. In a \\"blanket finish\\" Bethrah caught Anna Salai in the final strides and won by a head with Music Show, Remember When and Lillie Langtry just behind: the first five finishers were covered by three quarters of a length. After the race Weld said \\"She is tough and very genuine, and has progressed over the winter. We’ve done a lot of work with her at the stalls, and she is a lot more confident these days and went in perfectly today\\". Discussing her future targets he added \\"we'll make a plan from there but she might go 10 furlongs next as I don't see her just limited to a mile\\". After a break of over three months Bethrah returned in the Matron Stakes at Leopardstown on 4 September. After racing in third place she was unable to make any progress in the straight and finished fifth of the six runners behind Lillie Langtry.

An elected fellow of all three major Indian science academies — Indian National Science Academy, Indian Academy of Sciences, and National Academy of Sciences, India — Sharma is known for his research on the molecular biology of malaria. The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the apex agency of the Government of India for scientific research, awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology for his contributions to medical sciences in 1994.  Biography  All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi Born on 22 July 1951, Y. D. Sharma did his early college studies at Dr. B. R. Ambedkar University (formerly known as Agra University) from where he earned his bachelor's (BSc) and master's (MSc) degrees. Subsequently, he did his doctoral studies at M. J. P. Rohilkhand University and after securing a PhD for his thesis on serum glycoproteins in 1981, he did the first part of his post-doctoral work at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi where his work was based on fluorosis. Moving to the University of Connecticut Health Center in 1982, he continued his post-doc work at the laboratory of Marvin Lawrence Tanzer on molecular biology and biochemistry of collagens. However, when he moved to Public Health Research Institute in 1984, his focus shifted to molecular parasitology which remained the main theme of his researches thereafter. He returned to India to join National Institute of Malaria Research (erstwhile Malaria Research Centre) as a Pool Officer but his stay at NIMR lasted only six months till he was appointed as an associate professor at AIIMS Delhi where he established a laboratory for researches on molecular parasitology. He continues at AIIMS as a professor since 1998 and heads the department of biotechnology while serving as the coordinator of Bioinformatics Centre of the institution. In 2011, he also served as a part of the two-member committee constituted to investigate the plagiarism charges against one of the senior doctors of AIIMS.  Legacy  Symptoms of malaria During his days at Public Health Research Institute, Sharma was successful in cloning the knob protein gene of Plasmodium falciparum, one of the protozoan parasites causing malaria, in 1984. At AIIMS, he led a group of researchers who carried out molecular epidemiological studies of the parasites causing malaria and their studies widened the understanding of the parasites' resistance to chloroquine and antifolate drugs. He is credited with the identification of P. falciparum strains in India, isolation of P. falciparum and Plasmodium vivax, another non-cultivable protozoan parasite, as well as the development of a genomic library of Plasmodium vivax. It was his group which reported the first incidence of malaria in humans caused by Plasmodium knowlesi, a primate malarial parasite.

Members of the unit have declared that their primary goal is to drive the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) from Syria, and to establish a democratic, inclusionist government in the country.  History  According to the pro-SDF Hawar News Agency, the Manbij Revolutionaries Battalion was founded under the leadership of Mustafa Manbij on 25 January 2016, whereas the Firat News Agency claimed that the militia was formed in April 2016. The group was one of the Syrian Democratic Forces' Manbij Military Council's founding members. The Manbij Revolutionaries Battalion participated in the Manbij offensive from May 2016, and helped to encircle Manbij city. The militia's fighters encountered ISIL forces armed with HEAT missiles during the fighting around the town. One of the group's chief commanders, Ali Salah al-Din Bish Alo (alias \\"Botan Turkmani\\"), was killed during the Manbij campaign. Ali had been a veteran of the Kurdish Front and also served as commander for the al- Bab Military Council while leading the Manbij Revolutionaries Battalion. The SDF later named a military academy after him. After Turkey and allied FSA groups launched Operation Euphrates Shield against ISIL and the YPG/YPJ, a Manbij Revolutionaries Battalion commander expressed a strong disapproval of the Turkish occupation of northern Syria. He claimed that Turkey was prolonging the Syrian Civil War by intervening, and that it wanted to prevent the formation of a democratic government in northern Syria. On 4 February 2017, 100 fighters completed their training at the Martyr Faysal Abu Layla Academy at Manbij, joining the Manbij Revolutionaries Battalion, and by extension, the Manbij Military Council. On 21 February, unidentified gunmen killed five commanders of the unit in the village of Al-Awsajly, west of Manbij. In early March, as fighting between the Syrian Democratic Forces and the Turkish-backed forces escalated in the western Manbij countryside, the SDF made a deal with the Assad government. Accordingly, the SDF handed over a number of villages in the area to the Syrian Army, so that the Turkish forces could no longer attack them. On 6 March 2016, Manbij Revolutionaries Battalion commander Ahmad Arsh appeared in a Russia Today video, dressed like a member of the Syrian Armed Forces and with a Syrian government flag in the background. He claimed to be a commander of the Syrian Border Police, and that he and his men had taken control of the villages in question. By February 2019, Manbij Revolutionaries Battalion commander Mustafa Manbij led an Arab SDF contingent during the Battle of Baghuz Fawqani, ISIL's last important territorial holding in Syria.  Organization  According to the pro-SDF Hawar News Agency, the Manbij Revolutionaries Battalion consists of hundreds of fighters, most of them belonging to tribes that live to Manbij city's west and south. The group is multiethnic, and has recruited Arabs, Kurds, and Syrian Turkmen into its ranks. Fighters of the group have claimed that their ultimate aim is to establish a democratic government in Syria.

It is endemic to Peru and only known from its type locality, Japumato Valley in the Peruvian Andes in the Cusco. Common names Japumayo Andes frog has been coined for this species. Etymology The specific name chirihampatu is a combination of Quechua words meaning \\"cold toad\\" (chiri hamp'atu). The genus name Psychrophrynella has the same meaning. Dorsolateral (left) and ventral (right) views of two males and two females. Description Males measure and females in snout–vent length. Skin on the dorsum is finely shagreen, with some small warts forming linear ridges at mid dorsum. Skin on the venter is smooth. The tympanic membrane is not differentiated and the tympanic annulus is barely visible below skin. The snout short is bluntly rounded. Neither fingers nor toes have lateral fringes or webbing. The dorsal color varies considerably between individuals: the dorsum is tan to brown and gray, with dark brown markings; some individuals have a yellow or orange mid- dorsal line. An inter-orbital bar is present. The chest, venter and ventral parts of the arms and legs are yellow with brown flecks. The throat and palmar and plantar surfaces brown or reddish-brown. Males have vocal sac and vocal slits but no nuptial pads. Reproduction Males have been observed calling during the day. The advertisement call is composed of multiple notes; the call of the holotype lasted 1–4.5 seconds and consisted of 10–68 single-pulsed notes. Female fecundity is 7–12 eggs. In one nest, eleven unattended eggs measuring about in diameter were found. Habitat and conservation Psychrophrynella chirihampatu has been found in areas of disturbed montane forest vegetation, often along the forest edges bordering landslides and other open areas. It is known from elevations of above sea level. This species has been assessed as of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The surveyed populations are relatively large, and no direct threats are currently known—the species might actually benefit from some habitat disturbance. The known range is within a protected area.

The bridge was built in 1865-66, and is a rare well-preserved example of a mid-19th century stone bridge. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. Description and history The Skilton Road Bridge is located in a rural-residential area of northwestern Watertown, spanning the Nonewaug River between Hinman Road and Hickory Lane. The bridge has an overall length of , with a single arch spanning . It is made of dry laid local stone, and is built on a stone ledge on one side and a stone abutment on the other. The stones which form the barrel of the arch are roughly worked, while those filling the spandrels show little evidence of work. The arch is a slightly asymmetrical segmented arch, probably due to the difficulties involved in working at the site. The bridge is wide, and carries a single lane of traffic. The bridge was built either in 1865-66, after the town voted in 1865 to fund its construction; Skilton Road was at the time the major route between Watertown and Bethlehem. Stone, a more expensive construction material than wood, was probably chosen because of its longer lifespan, and because a mill dam just upstream (now breached) whose breach would have caused flooding that would endanger a wooden bridge. This bridge is fairly typical of mid-19th century stone bridges, which were once quite numerous in the state.

Cytosolic ciliogenesis is divided into three types: Primary cytosolic cilia are formed by exposing the axoneme of compartmentalized cilium (formed initially by compartmentalized ciliogenesis) to the cytoplasm. This type of cilia is found in the sperm of human and other mammals. Secondary cytosolic cilia are formed in parallels to the formation of the typical compartmentalized cilium. One end of the axoneme is exposed to the cytoplasm as the other end of the axoneme is formed as compartmentalized cilia. This type of cilia is found in insects. Tertiary cytosolic cilia are axonemes that form directly in the cytoplasm. This type of cilia is found in Plasmodium (the malaria parasite).  History  The term Cytosolic Ciliogenesis was coined in 2004 as part of a study that identified a large set of ciliogenesis genes. It was found that a subset of genes that are thought to be essential for compartmentalized cilia are not essential to form the sperm flagellum. Since the axoneme of this flagellum was exposed to the cytoplasm it was named Cytosolic Ciliogenesis.

Functional from 1 August 1964 until November 1965, it was meant to replace the provisional Loi Fundamental that had been enacted when independence was declared in 1960. Unlike its predecessor, the Luluabourg Constitution featured a strong executive presidency and carefully delineated federalism between the central government and the provinces. It also formalized the adoption of the name \\"Democratic Republic of the Congo\\", succeeding the name \\"Republic of the Congo\\".  Background  As was agreed upon by the participants in the Belgo-Congolese Round Table Conference in 1960, a formal constitution was to be agreed upon by the Congolese within three to four years of independence.  Summary  The Luluabourg Constitution was mostly a compensation for what its authors perceived to be the shortfalls of the Loi Fundamental. Its principal features were a centralized and strengthened executive and a punctilious separation of responsibilities between the central and provincial governments. = National flag and state name = The constitution formally changed the name of the country from \\"Republic of the Congo\\" to \\"Democratic Republic of the Congo\\" and adopted a new national flag. = Presidency = According to the constitution, the president \\"determines and directs the policy of the state\\" and \\"establishes the framework of government action, supervises its application, and informs Parliament of its development\\". The president was to be selected by an electoral college composed of members of Parliament, members from every provincial assembly, and several delegates from the capital with the number of them being determined by how much representation they would be accorded to in Parliament based on population. The capital delegates and parliamentary delegates would meet in the capital to cast their vote, while the provincial assembly electors would do the same from their respective provincial capitals. All presidential candidates had to be at least 40 years of age. The president was to be chosen by the candidate with a simple majority. If this was not achieved on the first two ballots, then the candidate with a plurality on the third would become president. = Premiership = The office of prime minister was retained, but its functions and responsibilities were largely reduced. The prime minister and all other cabinet ministers were to be named and revoked either individually or collectively by the president. = Nationality = Article 6 restricted Congolese nationality solely to persons whose ancestors were a part of an ethnic group that had lived in the Congo before 18 October 1908. This rule could be circumvented if a person submitted a formal request to change their nationality within 12 months of the promulgation of the constitution.  Effects and criticisms  The Luluabourg Constitution denied citizenship to most Rwandan immigrants in the Congo. Marcel Bisukiro, a former government minister, criticised it as discriminatory.

It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a side gable roof, interior brick chimneys, and a clapboarded exterior. It has wide corner pilasters rising to an entablature. The main facade is five bays wide, with a center entrance flanked by sidelight windows and pilasters, and topped by a transom window and cornice. The interior rooms retain the original woodwork and much of its historical appearance. The house was built sometime in the mid-1840s by Jason Skinner, a prosperous local farmer. It was located on the eastern shore of Valley View Pond, a rural setting south of its present location. In 1985, it was carefully disassembled and moved to its current location. Some of its deteriorated and vandalized elements were replaced with reproductions, and the 20th-century interior elements were modernized.

It is known from the American tropics. Description Most members of the genus are epiphytes, although some grow on soil or on rocks. Taxonomy The genus was first described by Michael Sundue in 2014 to receive some of the species of the genus Terpsichore. When that genus was described by Alan R. Smith in 1993, he divided it into five informal groups. Subsequent morphological and molecular studies showed that Terpsichore was polyphyletic, but its groups were largely monophyletic and could furnish the basis of new genera. These genera were described over the next several years; Sundue's new genus Mycopteris, encompassing the T. taxifolia group, was the last group to be removed from Terpsichore sensu lato. The name \\"Mycopteris\\" is derived from the Greek roots myco-, \\"fungus\\", and -pteris, \\"fern\\", referring to the near-universal association of these ferns with the ascomycete fungus Acrospermum. Sundue initially placed seventeen species in the genus, one of which was newly described and another elevated from a variety. He suggested that another five to ten species might be described after the completion of a monograph on the genus. In 2017, he described a new species, Mycopteris martiniana, from Mexico. =Species= , the Checklist of Ferns and Lycophytes of the World accepted the following species: *Mycopteris alsopteris (C.V.Morton) Sundue *Mycopteris amphidasyon (Mett.)
