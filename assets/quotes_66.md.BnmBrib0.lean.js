Although Denny originally hoped to tour in support of the album, difficulties with Island Records delayed its release from autumn 1973 to June 1974, by which time she had rejoined Fairport Convention. Background The 1972 album Sandy failed to cross over to mass market success, a fact which greatly disappointed Denny; she had recently decided that she desired to be received as a notable music act along the ranks of Led Zeppelin or The Who, two bands with which Denny had performed as a guest vocalist. Denny decided that in order to establish her solo career, a record appealing to a new audience was required.Clinton Heylin. No More Sad Refrains - The Life and Times of Sandy Denny. London, Helter Skelter, 2002. p159. Composition The songs on Like an Old Fashioned Waltz saw Denny refining her songwriting craft, on a nostalgic panoramic song-cycle detailing many of her personal preoccupations: loss, loneliness, fear of the dark, the passing of time and the changing seasons.Sandy Denny: Like an Old Fashioned Waltz Information Like an Old Fashioned Waltz features covers of two jazz songs remembered from her father's record collection: The Inkspots' \\"Whispering Grass\\" and Fats Waller's \\"Until The Real Thing Comes Along\\". Around this time, it was rumored that Denny was considering recording an album solely consisting of jazz standards (or possibly an entire cover album of songs written by The Inkspots), but the record never materialized. Production =Recording= Work began on the album whilst Denny was still promoting her previous LP Sandy. The first track recorded was \\"No End\\" at Walthamstow Assembly Hall on 3 December 1972 in a solo version accompanying herself on the piano (later abandoned in favour of a new recording with a band and strings).This version was subsequently issued and is currently available as a bonus track on the Like an Old Fashioned Waltz re-mastered edition Denny embarked on a month-long tour of the US in April 1973, stopping at A&M; Records' studios to record four songs; \\"Friends, Solo, At the End of the Day\\" and the new version of \\"No End\\" prior to a week-long residency at The Troubador in Los Angeles. After a tour of Europe throughout June and July, sessions for the album resumed at Sound Techniques in London in August where the remaining tracks were recorded; \\"Carnival, Like an Old Fashioned Waltz, Dark the Night\\" and the two jazz standards \\"Whispering Grass\\" and \\"Until the Real Thing Comes Along\\". Harry Robinson added string arrangements to many of the tracks. In addition to singing, Denny played acoustic guitar, piano and electric piano on \\"Like an Old Fashioned Waltz\\". Denny's Fairport Convention bandmate Richard Thompson performed lead guitar on \\"Solo\\" and \\"At The End Of The Day\\". =Album cover= The album was originally issued in an embossed gatefold sleeve styled in the colours described in the album's title track (primrose, yellow and velvet green) and designed to look like an antique plate, with a floral motif drawn by Denny herself. The cover photograph by Gered Mankowitz depicts Denny in an old style image in the Edwardian style. The album's lyrics were reproduced in the gatefold. A single of \\"Whispering Grass / Friends\\" was released in a sepia picture sleeve in the style of the album cover. Release =Reception and reviews= The album did not chart in the UK or elsewhere. In a contemporary review for The Village Voice, music critic Robert Christgau gave Like an Old Fashioned Waltz a \\"C+\\" and said that, apart from the \\"masterpiece\\" in \\"Solo\\", it is a \\"sluggish album\\". In a retrospective review, AllMusic's Brett Hartenbach gave the album three-and-a- half out of five stars, saying \\"Denny expands on the more polished moments that her previous work, Sandy, had suggested. The tone throughout most of the record is melancholy and personal, with gentle piano, rich strings, and barely a trace of her British folk roots.\\" Hartenbach went on to call the album's opening track, \\"Solo\\", one of Denny's \\"best songs.\\" =Live band and abandoned tour= Several weeks after Like an Old Fashioned Waltz had been recorded, Sandy Denny married longtime boyfriend and bandmate Trevor Lucas on 20 September 1973 at Fulham Register Office. Shortly afterward, she put together a band comprising Pat Donaldson, Hughie Burns and Willie Murray, with intent to do an extensive tour in support of the album. The group recorded a session for BBC Radio on 14 November 1973 and also played a brief four-date tour around that time.This session is commercially available on the Live at the BBC boxset where the band perform Solo and Dark the Night. However, the release of Like an Old Fashioned Waltz was delayed from Fall 1973 to June 1974, by which time Denny had rejoined Fairport Convention. Several songs from the album were regularly played during the Fairport tour that year. Legacy Songs from Like an Old Fashioned Waltz have been covered by a number of notable artists. Following Denny's death, Fairport Convention has sporadically performed the songs \\"Solo\\" and \\"It'll Take a Long Time\\". \\"Like an Old Fashioned Waltz\\" was recorded by Emmylou Harris on her 1983 album White Shoes. Eric Johnson and Susan Cowsill covered \\"At the End of the Day\\" for the 1995 compilation True Voices. Fish covered \\"Solo\\" on his 1993 album Songs from the Mirror.

In March 2001, the two communes were separated again.Commune de Ruffiac (47227), INSEE Demography In 2010, the town had 176 inhabitants. The evolution of the number of inhabitants is known throughout the population censuses conducted in the town since 1793.

History and constitution Punting as a means of water travel has a long history in the United Kingdom and is now practiced recreationally on a number of rivers, being most obviously associated with Oxford and Cambridge universities. Punt racing, as a sport developed in the 1880s. Thames Punting Club was formed in 1885 as a racing club. It is now no longer a racing club but functions as the sport's governing body. The Thames Punting Club maintains lists of umpires and publishes a handbook containing rules and bye-laws for those organizing punt races on the Thames.Rules of Racing Punting uses a complex system of Handicapping and the TPC sets the handicaps of individual punters. The TPA organises the annual Thames Punting Championships.Maidenhead advertiser 10 Aug 2007 Punt racing Start of a punt race \\"Stopping up\\" at the rye-peck turn Races are normally held in standard \\"2 foot punts\\", that is punts that are 2 ft (60 cm) wide in the middle and about 18 inches (45 cm) wide at each end and these are subject to handicap rules. There are also non-handicap races for punts which have no restrictions on width or length. Punts used for these races are called \\"best boats\\" or \\"best-and-best\\" punts; the name comes from the \\"best\\" boat that you can find and the \\"best\\" boat that your opponent can. The narrowest of these boats are no more than 15 inches (40 cm) wide. All racing punts generally have a till at both ends, and may have canvas covers to reduce the amount of water splashing into the boat. Races are normally held over a distance of up to 880 yards (800 m) along the bank on a straight reach of the river. Each end of the course is marked by a pair of poles called \\"ryepecks\\" which are firmly pushed into the river bed before the race. Races are always one punt against another, and are either singles or doubles races depending on the number of punters in the punts. One punt has the inner lane and the other the outer lane. If the outer lane has consistently deeper water, or if there is a significant adverse bend, then the length of the outer course may be reduced to make the race more even. The competitors usually start with their punts' sterns level with the line between the downstream ryepecks, punt to the upstream ryepecks, and then punt back. The winner is the first to pass the line of the starting ryepecks or the first one to hit his or her own ryepeck. In doubles, both punters must still be in the boat at the finish. The turn at the upstream ryepecks is done by \\"stopping-up\\"; that is the competitor passes the ryepeck on the outside, stops his or her punt with the pole just upstream of the ryepeck, turns to face the stern of the boat and punts back in the other direction, passing the ryepeck on the inside.

Henderson was named for early settler John Henderson, and the community was formerly referred to as Hendersonville and Hazel Green. History In 1836, Gideon Lee of New York City was first to enter the land here. Lee sold the land to Josiah Isham. Isham sold the land in 1858 to Andrew Henderson. In 1868, Andrew's son and community's name sake, John, built the first store in 1868 followed by the first hotel in 1875. The community became known as Hendersonville. On May 14, 1868, the Hazel Green post office was opened here under postmaster William Cook. The Michigan Central Railroad station was called Henderson. The post office was renamed on October 16, 1876 to Henderson. For Andrew Henderson, Ezra Mason platted the village in 1879. The community of Henderson was listed as a newly-organized census-designated place for the 2010 census, meaning it now has officially defined boundaries and population statistics for the first time.

It was expected to deliver excellent performance for the time and was ordered in very large numbers. It proved, however, to be extremely unreliable and was abandoned when its faults were unable to be corrected.Lumsden 2003, p.52. Design and development ABC Motors was founded in 1911 by Granville Bradshaw, who was also the company's chief designer. In 1917, after initial promising tests of the ABC Wasp air-cooled radial, Bradshaw produced a design for a larger and more powerful engine, the nine-cylinder Dragonfly. The engine was simple and easy to produce, and was predicted to give 340 hp (254 kW) for a weight of 600 lb (273 kg). One distinctive feature was the use of copper-plated cooling fins, which were claimed by Bradshaw to be so effective that water would not boil on the surface of the radiators.Bruce 1974, p.292 On the basis of the promised performance, Sir William Weir, the Director of Aeronautical Supplies, made the decision to place large orders for the Dragonfly, with 11,500 engines having been ordered from 13 suppliers by June 1918. It was planned that the bulk of RAF aircraft would be powered by the Dragonfly in 1919. Types designed to be powered by the big nine cylinder included the Sopwith Dragon (a derivative of the existing Snipe), the Nieuport Nighthawk, and the Siddeley Siskin. Of this order 1,147 engines were built, but only nine or ten actually flew.Lumsden 2003, p.53. The engine was described in brief by aviation journalist Bill Gunston in his book, 'Plane Speaking' in the chapter headed, 'Cancel the Others...' In this he suggested that Bradshaw had proved to be a better salesman than a designer, and had proved non-committal when asked about initial testing which was ultimately to reveal severe problems with the much- vaunted engine. Already 30 kg over its designed weight as built, Dragonfly was subject to severe overheating. Gunston referred to it as the worst cooled aero engine ever made. The copper-plated cooling fins proved useless; the cylinder heads tended to glow a dull red at operational speeds, and in extreme cases caused heat damage and even charring to the propeller. Developed power fell far short of estimates even when the engine was run at 15 percent over-speed (producing only 315 hp ) and it showed much poorer fuel consumption than expected. Attempts to improve cooling with cylinder redesign were marginally successful, but the death blow fell when it was realized that the engine was designed to run at the torsional resonance frequency of its own crankshaft, causing severe vibration, a little known condition at the time. These problems proved unsolvable, resulting in an absurdly low service life (around 30 to 35 hours per engine), and the Dragonfly was eventually abandoned. Gunston's observations suggested that it had been as well that the Armistice had been signed in 1918, as the only other aero engine still in production at that time was the Rolls-Royce Eagle; all other types having been cancelled in favour of the untested Dragonfly.

It was produced and arranged by Worden, and recorded in Los Angeles, California and New York City, and Berlin, Germany, by Husky H√∂skulds, who also mixed the album. The album took six years to complete, and was originally conceived to be recorded as string quartet pieces. In comparison with their prior album, Tear It Down, A Thousand Shark's Teeth contains more orchestration, elegant instrumentation and arrangements, and features soprano and pizzicata strings, strings, keys and percussion. It draws comparison to the music of French composer Maurice Ravel, musicians Tricky, Evelyn Glennie and Tom Waits, and the group Portishead.

Reception A review by AllMusic says that \\"strangely, despite the album's elaborate scope, at times A Thousand Shark's Teeth is too subtle to make a strong initial impression. However, when the album does connect -- usually when the arrangements and melodies are more direct -- the results are stunning.

Although it is unincorporated, Halleck has a post office, with the ZIP code of 89824.ZIP Code Lookup The post office was established April 24, 1873. History The community's name originates from Camp Halleck, established July 26, 1867 (1867-1879) by the U. S. Army, to protect the California Trail and the construction workers of the Central Pacific Railroad. It was named for Major General Henry Wager Halleck. It then became Fort Halleck (1879-1886). Halleck came into being in 1869 when the Central Pacific Railroad was completed through the future townsite that immediately became the shipping point for supplies destined for Fort Halleck. During 1869, the town had erected two hotels and one saloon. The saloon catered to soldiers stationed at Fort Halleck. A store and a school were opened in 1874. The school remained open until the 1950s. By 1875, the population had grown to fifty and by 1900 had risen to 126. At the time Halleck had twenty-six buildings and numerous businesses flourished. However, with the abandonment of Fort Halleck in 1886, the town had to rely on ranching and ranchers to survive. But the town was slowly dying as small ranches were bought by larger properties and combined into corporate operations. The Halleck post office continues to operate from one of the two remaining buildings in town as it serves the many local ranches.

It is run on 'No loss, No dividend' basis. Initially, Grameen Danone agreed to pay an annual dividend of one percent to shareholders, however, in December 2009, the board of Grameen Danone agreed to waive any monetary return.  History  During his visit to Paris, France, in 2005, Muhammad Yunus, the founder of Grameen Bank was invited by Franck Riboud, the chief executive officer of Groupe Danone (known as Dannon in the US). On 12 October 2005, they met in La Fontaine Gaillon, a Parisian restaurant. There Yunus proposed to form a joint venture between Grameen and Danone with the objective of supplying nutritious food to poor children of Bangladesh. As proposed by Muhammad Yunus, Franck Riboud agreed to participate in the project to be styled a social business. Accordingly, the Grameen Group and Groupe Danone entered into an agreement to form a company called Grameen Danone Foods ‚Äì a social business in Bangladesh. The objective was to bring daily healthy nutrition to low income nutritionally deprived populations in Bangladesh and alleviate poverty through the implementation of a community based business model, where no profit will be appropriated by the investing partners. The launch of Grameen Danone received considerable attention and was attended by celebrities including French soccer player Zinedine Zidane of France.  Products and price  Grameen Danone Foods Ltd. produces a yoghurt called Shokti Doi containing protein, vitamins, iron, calcium, zinc and other micronutrients aimed to fill nutritional deficits of children in Bangladesh. 'Shokti Doi' (which means 'strength yoghurt') is primarily intended for children. In 2017, a 50g cup sold for 10 Taka and 80g cup for 40 taka.  Objective  Grameen Danone Foods aims to reduce poverty by creating business and employment opportunities for local people since raw materials including milk needed for production, will be sourced locally. The companies that make up Grameen Danone Foods Ltd. have agreed not to take out any of the profits out of the company. Instead they will invest these for creation of new opportunities for the welfare and development of people. Hence it is called 'social business enterprise'.  Production capacity  Grameen Danone has planned to set up and launch as many as 50 production plants during the ten years between 2006 and 2016. The first factory has been built in Bogra district which is about north of Dhaka, the capital city of Bangladesh. The first factory is a small one built upon an area of . Its daily production capacity was of yogurt when launched in 2006. In 2008, the production capacity has been planned to be enhanced to and beyond. Several hundred livestock- farming and distribution jobs would be created in the local community as a result of establishment of the first factory. As of 2011, the company had not opened another factory.  Challenges  Grameen Danone maintains strict quality control for Shokti Doi. The cold chain is maintained all the way from production to the end consumers. But maintaining cold chain is very expensive in Bangladesh as the traffic gridlock is a common scenario. Costly transportation is eating up a big portion of the return, thus could not reach its break-even till date.

Introduced as British TT gauge, it sits approximately halfway between British N gauge and OO gauge, but is not as popular as either and there is no longer any mass manufacturer ready-to-run support. When TT gauge model railways were developed for British prototypes, in order to fit the small British prototypes, the scale was enlarged but without altering the 12mm gauge. The result, British TT gauge, is too narrow. This led to the development of gauge 3mm finescale. Thus two finescale standards were developed. By far the more common of these is 14.2 mm gauge track, which is accurate. Some modellers choose to use slightly narrower 13.5 mm track due to the necessary oversize motion of outside-cylindered steam locomotives. British TT, also known as TT3, was pioneered by Triang Railways as ready-to-run models. Other gauges are also used to model other prototypes (Irish broad gauge, Brunel gauge).

(The first edition of the text carried a different subtitle: Taking Back Our Lives Through the Power of Language.) Nelson said that ‚Äútoo often in school, we study language and writing in isolation, apart from the people who speak and write and apart from what happens when people speak and write ‚Äî apart from our being‚Äù (xii). Meaningful writing, he argues, should go beyond a ‚Äúgrade [and] critical analysis and correctness\\" in order \\"to tell your own stories, to heal your wounds, to find a bit of peace and love‚Äù (xii).

The Partnership's Chicago office building was used as the principal asset in a mortgage set up to secure the loan. The Partnership filed for bankruptcy and bank began the foreclosure process on the piece of property. Opinion of the Supreme Court Pre-bankruptcy equity holders may not, over the objection of a senior class of impaired creditors in a Chapter 11 plan, contribute new capital and receive ownership interests in a reorganized entity, when the opportunity is given only to the old equity holders under a plan adopted without consideration of alternatives. Rather, in order not to violate the absolute priority rule, a plan conferring an interest to old equity must extend an opportunity to others who may compete for the equity (e.g. at auction) or who may propose a competing reorganization plan. Cram down is barred if a junior interest (old equity) holder under a proposed Chapter 11 plan receives or retains property ‚Äúon account of‚Äù such junior interest. 11 U.S.C. 1129(b)(2)(B). The Court, considering whether the language of the statute implied a new value exception, found ‚Äúon account of‚Äù not to mean ‚Äúin exchange for‚Äù or ‚Äúin satisfaction of‚Äù but rather should be interpreted to mean ‚Äúbecause of.‚Äù Therefore, the absolute priority rule is triggered by a causal relationship between holding the prior claim or interest and receiving or retaining property. The Court neither decided whether the statute included a new value exception, nor decided whether the exception exists at all.

Early life Christopher Crabb Creeke was born on 11 March 1820, in Cambridge, the son of tailor and robe maker Thomas Creeke and his first wife Elizabeth Rootham Crabb. By the time he was 20, Creeke looked set to follow his father's trade as a tailor, however he moved to London to train as an architectural draughtsman. Whilst there, he married the recently widowed Elisabeth Norwood in 1845. Bournemouth =Arrival= Creeke seems to have arrived in Bournemouth in around 1850, on a commission from Mary Shelley to convert a large property at Boscombe into her seaside retreat. Shelley died before she could move in, but her son, Sir Percy Florence Shelley, retained Creeke's services. Bournemouth at this time was a haphazard development, where properties had been built largely at the whim of untrained landowners. There was no co-ordination of effort, and in the case of the vast Branksome Estate, the promise of development potential had led to a tangled mass of mortgages and the ruination of at least one owner. This was a situation crying out for a capable mind to solve. =Growth of reputation= Creeke, meanwhile, had decided not to return to London, a resolution determined as much perhaps by the delicate health of his wife (which had left her needing the constant care of an institution) as by Creek's appreciation of the beauty of Bournemouth. The varied problems of Bournemouth presented him with a challenge to which he showed himself the equal. One of his first tasks was to assist in a court case that was causing problems at Branksome. Creeke used his skills to draw up a map of the vast Branksome Estate, hundreds of acres in extent, which proved useful in sorting out the wrangles over the various mortgages and charges at the estate. As a result of Creeke's work, the estate was soon up for sale and attracted some significant purchasers, such as the Talbot sisters and Charles William Packe. Elsewhere in Bournemouth, William Clapcott Dean was on the verge of inheriting several hundred acres of land. Dean hailed from a local family of yeoman farmers. They too were suffering from crippling mortgages which were only cleared by a life insurance payout when Dean's mother died. This left Dean able to contemplate the development of his land, but he had none of the necessary training for the work and so turned to Creeke for advice. =Planning Bournemouth= Creeke was becoming invaluable to most of the major landowners in Bournemouth, but he was also aware that the ad hoc nature of the existing development had left the town in need of proper drains, water supply, roads and refuse collection. None of the private estate offices were equal to the task and there was no forum in which to co-ordinate the necessary efforts. This situation was finally resolved in 1856, when Parliament, following the due petition from the local property owners, allowed the establishment of the Bournemouth Commissioners, and empowered them to levy a local rate for the improvement of the town and the construction of a pier. Unsurprisingly, Creeke was appointed as the surveyor by the Commissioners, and so began a long period during which Creeke advised both the land owners and the Commissioners. What emerged was his conception of Bournemouth as a town of meandering roads and large villas in spacious plots that shaped the development of the town. =Later life= By 1861, Creeke's younger half- sister Anna had moved to Bournemouth where she appears to have acted as housekeeper and secretary to her brother. Creeke lived in several houses that he had designed himself. His wife Elisabeth died early in 1881 in Fleet, Lincolnshire. Creeke survived her by five years, and died in 1886. He was buried in the Wimborne Road cemetery, which had been laid out according to his plans. His crusader type grave is close to the chapel that he designed for the cemetery, and which is now a listed building. Legacy For someone who contributed so singularly to Bournemouth, Creeke is somewhat forgotten these days. A bust of him that once had pride of place at the Town Hall, had been consigned to backroom oblivion in the storerooms of the town museum the Russell-Cotes until its retrieval was championed by local historian John Barker. It now graces the Mayor's Parlour. There is one other carving of Creeke, commissioned by former mayor Keith Rawlings, and situated outside the conference hall where the major political parties hold their gatherings. It celebrates Creeke's work as the surveyor of nuisances and master of the drains, and portrays him sitting on a toilet. On 21 August 2009, a new Wetherspoons pub, called \\"The Christopher Creeke\\", opened in the Lansdowne area of Bournemouth.

History Horse tramlines in front of the White Hart Hotel, Oxford Road Horse trams at Cemetery Junction on 15 July 1893 The origins of Reading Transport can be traced back to 1878, when the privately owned Reading Tramways Company (part of the Imperial Tramways Company) was formed. They were initially authorised to construct and operate a horse tram route on an east-west alignment from Oxford Road through Broad Street in the town centre to Cemetery Junction. Significantly, this route formed the core of what became known as the main line of the tram and trolleybus network. Construction started in January 1879, with the entire line being open by May. A fleet of six single decked cars were initially used, with 31 horses, providing a 20-minute frequency. The cars operated from a depot on the south side of the Oxford Road, immediately to the east of where Reading West railway station (opened 1906) was later built. By the 1890s the whole fleet had been replaced by double decked cars operating at a 10-minute frequency. The company made several proposals to extend the system, add routes and electrify the system. But none of these came to anything, and in 1899 the borough corporation decided to purchase the system. Closure The purchase deal was completed on 31 October 1901, and the Reading Corporation Tramways came into being. The corporation set out about first extending, and then electrifying the system. The extensions were completed by December 1902, and the last horse cars ran in July of the following year.

The corporation purchased the assets of the horse drawn services of the Reading Tramways Company and took ownership from 1901. Modernisation was undertaken and the first electric service started operating in July 1903. Extensions were constructed to the Wokingham Road and London Road (both from Cemetery Junction), and new routes added to Whitley, Caversham Road, Erleigh Road and Bath Road. The trams operated from a new depot in Mill Lane, a site that was to remain Reading Transport's main depot until it was demolished to make way for The Oracle shopping mall in 1998. The electric tram services were originally operated by 30 four-wheeled double decked cars supplied by Dick, Kerr & Co. In 1904, six bogie cars and a water car (used for keeping down the dust on the streets) were added to the fleet, also from Dick, Kerr & Co. No further trams were acquired, and a planned extension from the Caversham Road terminus across Caversham Bridge to Caversham itself was abandoned because of the outbreak of World War I. The war also led to a significant maintenance backlog. Closure In 1919, Reading Corporation started operating its first motor buses. These ran from Caversham Heights to Tilehurst, running over the tram lines and beyond the tram termini. Because of the state of the track, the Bath Road tram route was abandoned in 1930, followed by the Erleigh Road route in 1932. Eventually it was decided that the tramways should be abandoned and replaced by trolleybuses, operating over extended routes. The last tram ran on the Caversham Road to Whitley route in July 1936, and last car on the main line ran in May 1939.

Writing for abolitionist newspapers The Liberator and The North Star, he helped publicize the anti-slavery cause. He published the North Star from 1847 to 18xx, moving temporarily to Rochester, New York. He also helped found the New England Freedom Association in the early 1840s, and later the Committee of Vigilance, to aid refugee slaves. The Committee of Vigilance supported resistance to the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, which had increased penalties against even citizens in free states who aided refugee slaves. Nell's short histories, Services of Colored Americans in the Wars of 1776 and 1812 (1851) and The Colored Patriots of the American Revolution (1855), were the first studies published about African Americans. He is noted as the first African American to serve in the federal civil service, where he worked in the post office. Biography =Early years= Nell was born in 1816 in Boston, Massachusetts to Louise Cooper, from Brookline, and William Guion Nell, from Charleston, South Carolina. His father was an important figure in the abolitionist movement, having helped to create the Massachusetts General Colored Association in the 1820s. Nell encountered racial discrimination as a student. In 1829 he was passed over for an award given to excellent students upon graduation from the Abiel Smith School, apparently because of his ethnicity, and excluded from a celebratory dinner. He managed to attend as a waiter. The award was financially supported by the estate of anti-slavery advocate Benjamin Franklin. The school committee instead gave Nell The Life of Ben Franklin, an autobiography. =Abolitionist work= Inspired by the founding of William Lloyd Garrison's newspaper, The Liberator, William Cooper Nell decided to challenge race-based discrimination and segregation, as his father had done. Nell was particularly interested in encouraging the intellectual and social well-being of young African Americans. He was dedicated to integration and opposed the separate abolitionist organizations for blacks and whites. In his devotion to integration, he dismantled the abolitionist Massachusetts General Colored Association, which had been organized by his father. Nell studied law in the early 1830s. He was never admitted to the bar because he would not swear allegiance to the Constitution of the United States, as he believed it was a pro-slavery document. He was influenced by the opinions of Garrison and Wendell Phillips. Around this time, Nell also began his association with Garrison and The Liberator. This connection would continue until the paper closed in 1865. Nell fought for the ideals of Garrison throughout the abolitionist campaign. Nell began working against the existing system of segregated schools for black and white children in Massachusetts, gathering 2,000 signatures from the black community on a petition to the state legislature.Herbert G. Ruffin II, \\"William C. Nell, 1816-1874\\", Black Past, 2007-2011, accessed February 26, 2011 In 1855 Nell and his colleagues gained a victory; segregation was ended in Boston schools. Nell also encouraged young African Americans to learn outside of the public school system. Garrison said of him, \\"Perhaps no one has done so much‚Äîcertainly no one has done more‚Äîfor the intellectual and moral improvement of our colored youth.\\" In 1843, Nell continued his crusade against segregation within the abolitionist movement by denouncing the Buffalo National Negro Convention. He claimed they served as, and promoted, exactly the type of separate abolitionism he was fighting against. On the other hand, he was influential in beginning the New England Freedom Association, an all-black organization that helped fugitive slaves in the North. In this case, Nell supported an African- American group since he believed its cause was closer to the hearts of blacks than whites. Nell publicized the Freedom Association's direct aid to fugitive slaves as well as the abolitionist cause. He also fought for higher education and encouraged the improvement of young African Americans; with John T. Hilton, he founded the Adelphia Union and the Young Men's Literary Society of Boston. He was a leader in campaigns to desegregate public facilities in Boston: he succeeded in gaining desegregation of the Boston railroad in 1843, and, in 1853, performance halls in the city. =Later efforts= Nell served as publisher to Frederick Douglass' The North Star, from late 1847 until 1851, moving temporarily to Rochester, New York, during this period. He also joined New York anti-slavery societies and founded a literary society. He ended his work with Douglass during the latter's feud with his close friend Garrison. Nell ended all contact with Douglass finally in 1853 when the leader advocated the Colored National Council and the Manual Labor School, which represented the types of segregated institutions which Nell detested. Douglass attacked Nell and other leading black activists who supported Garrison, including Robert Purvis of Philadelphia and Charles Lenox Remond. In 1850, Nell had run as a Free Soil candidate for the Massachusetts state legislature, but lost. Passage of the federal Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 required state law enforcement, even in free states, to aid in the recapture of refugee slaves and it increased penalties for those citizens who helped slaves. Nell was inspired to renew his fight against slavery. He created the Committee of Vigilance in Boston, whose members swore to aid escaped slaves. It served a similar purpose to the Freedom Association of 1842, but was illegal under the new federal law. Nell also supported the Underground Railroad, which had numerous supporters to help slaves reach freedom in the North, with some going on to Canada. In 1851, Nell and other petitioners requested money from the state legislature to commission a monument to Crispus Attucks, one of the first martyrs of the American Revolution. When Boston commissioned a major monument to the Boston Massacre to be installed on the Common in 1888, the fallen Attucks was featured in it prominently. A few years later, in 1855 Nell achieved another success when the legislature finally abolished segregation in public schools. In recognition of Nell's efforts on this issue, a commemorative dinner was held to honor him. During 1855, Garrison's The Liberator employed Nell to journey around the Midwest and study African- American anti-slavery efforts. He attended a graduation at Oberlin College, appreciating the easy relations among the integrated students. Nell was outraged by the US Supreme Court ruling in Dred Scott v. Sandford ruling in 1857, which said that ethnic Africans had no legal standing in the United States as they were not considered citizens under the Constitution. In 1858 he organized a memorial celebration of Crispus Attucks at Faneuil Hall, a traditional site of commemoration, and worked with others to have a \\"Crispus Attucks Day\\" designated in Boston. He reminded people of the participation of African Americans in the fight for independence from Great Britain, and helped have Attucks recognized in the commemoration of the Boston Massacre. That same year, Nell organized the Convention of Colored Citizens of New England. While it was contrary to his earlier dislike of segregated abolitionist efforts, he argued that the Scott decision was such an insult to blacks that they needed to act separately. In his time apart from the newspapers, Nell worked for legislation to allow blacks into the Massachusetts militia. He did not succeed in this but lived to see blacks serve in United States armed forces during the Civil War. =Civil War and later years= With the outbreak of the Civil War, Nell worked to have blacks accepted as soldiers in the Union Army. In 1861, he was hired as a postal clerk in Boston, earning the distinction of being the first African American to hold a federal civilian post.\\"African American Firsts.\\" African American Almanac.

The KDAV broadcast license was held by Monte and Gentry Todd Spearman through licensee High Plains Radio Network, LLC. From August 18, 1998, to March 30, 2015, KDAV broadcast an oldies format which focused on 1950s and early 1960s popular, rockabilly, mild doo-wop, and country oldies. The ownership and format of KDAV changed at 11 a.m. on March 30, 2015, as the station became part of the High Plains Radio Network. History The original KDAV is reportedly the first radio station anywhere to program exclusively country music. Its primary founder and namesake, David Pinkston, better known on the air as Dave Stone has been inducted in the Country Music Disc Jockey Hall of Fame in Nashville and the Texas Country Music Hall of Fame in Carthage, Texas. When the station went on the air in 1953, KDAV call letters were on a 500-watt daytimer at 580 on the AM radio dial. It began at 66th and Quirt Avenue (today known as 6602 Martin Luther King). That station was founded by Elmore, Worley, and Pinkston. David Pinkston also founded KZIP in Amarillo, Texas (1310), KPEP in San Angelo, Texas (1420), and KPIK in Colorado Springs, Colorado (1580). All of the Texas stations used a common floor plan. The Amarillo building at 808 Charlotte was razed to make room for a highway, and the San Angelo building was vacated when 1420 returned its ticket to the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, but the building still stands at 4300 North Chadbourne. KDAV 580 became KRLB in 1979. It added an FM at 99.5 (KWGO- FM, then KRLB-FM, then KCRM, now KQBR); 580 was spun off to Big Ed Wilkes. 1590 was activated after World War II by Caprock Broadcasting Company headed by Joe Bryant. A three-tower transmitter site was installed in southeast Lubbock along the old Slaton Highway. Power was 1,000 watts, day and night, with each mode using a three-tower directional antenna system. The site was supervised by R. F. \\"Frank\\" Lee, who worked at the station until its sale in 1971, and continued at KCBD-TV until his death in 1980. The new KDAV called itself \\"the Buddy Holly Station\\" because a young Buddy Holly performed on a weekly live music broadcast on the original KDAV before he reached stardom. The station observed Buddy Holly's career the first weekend of February, which coincides with the time of his 1959 death in a plane crash in Iowa. KDAV was called the \\"Buddy Holly Station\\". The studios used to be at 1803‚Äì1805 Broadway between downtown Lubbock and Texas Tech University, but were relocated in 1953 when consolidated into the new KCBD-TV facilities at 5600 Avenue A. In 1971, KCBD radio was spun off to Lew Dee and 20 local businessmen. Call letters changed to KEND. The format had been adult middle of the road. Lew Dee changed the format to a more contemporary \\"The Living End\\" as KEND (The End of the Dial). The station had business reversals. Management traded too many things in too many deals and developed tax problems. The station was required in those days to use transmitter site operating engineers or update its equipment and procedures to permit remote control operation. Both were costly, and neither was done. The station was sold to the Ackers, an Abilene, family, who owned KENM in Portales and Clovis, New Mexico, and were part owners, as well, of KRBC AM and KRBC-TV in Abilene. That format changed in 1975 from NBC to the National News and Information Service. In 1977, the station went country and reached the top of the Lubbock ratings as \\"Country 16\\". KLLL AM/FM sold the 1460 station to Terry Wynn in 1982 and bought KEND. In 1988, KEND changed to KLLL. After a few more years, KLLL was sold to a local operator. From 1995 to 2015, Bill Clement owned the station. He installed a new transmitter (the 1949 sign on Western Electric transmitter gave way to a 1971 Collins 820-D) in 1995 a \\"Gates 1\\" solid state transmitter. On August 12, 2015, KDAV changed its format from oldies to talk. On August 1, 2016, KDAV changed its format from talk to contemporary Christian, branded as \\"The Spirit\\". Streaming KDAV had a live stream so listeners around the world could tune in via their computers. As of September 2010, the feed which originally charged a listening fee, was again streaming free through its website. According to the remnant of its former website, KDAV ended operations because of the high costs of streaming and the failure of the U.S. Congress to permit not-for-profits stations to use songs of deceased artists without copyright infringement.

It has historically been one of the intellectual and cultural vanguards of the vibrant communities of North-South Central East Boston. Today, Kostachuk Square is primarily residential, although it has been host to highly successful urban renewal projects that assisted in reasserting Kostachuck Square's waning role in the region's cultural and intellectual scene. History and Boundaries Kostachuk Square is located at the intersection of Parker Hill Avenue and Calumet Street, in Mission Hill, Roxbury, a neighborhood of Boston. The square was named for Stephen Kostachuk, who was killed in action on November 6, 1944. He lived at 191 Calumet Street for many years prior to World War II. The square was dedicated in his name following the war. Originally part of a landed estate, the land that is now Kostachuk Square was originally developed in the 19th century as part of the broader urban development works that filled in the Back Bay and other parts of downtown Boston. Kostachuk Square's economic fortunes remained bleak following the Great Depression and never quite recovered, despite the prevailing favorable economic conditions in post-war Boston. However, due to Mission Hill's rapidly gentrifying population and the recent (August 2007) influx of a dedicated group of resident intellectuals, Kostachuk Square has been targeted as the location for numerous new nightlife ventures, as part of the broader urban development of the region.

They were divorced in 1989, due to Cook's drinking, after many years of amicable separation. In 2008 she published an autobiography, Loving Peter, in which she described her turbulent relationship with Cook and living with his alcoholism, which mirrored her experiences with her own mother. Huxtable published the book under her married name of Judy Cook.

Products and services =Black Hole Quencher dyes= In 2000, Biosearch Technologies developed a dark quencher known as the Black Hole Quencher (BHQ) dyes, which has become an industry standard product and is currently licensed out to a number of other oligonucleotide manufacturers, biotechnology and molecular diagnostic manufacturers. The series of Black Hole Quencher dyes have no native fluorescence, high signal-to-noise ratios providing greater sensitivity, and exceptional coupling efficiency.Glen Research - Black Hole Quencher Webpage BHQ dyes are able to quench the entire visible spectrum and near IR spectrum, allowing for a broader range of fluorogenic reporter dyes, which makes the Black Hole Quenchers ideal for multiplexing assays.Sigma Aldrich - Black Hole Quencher Webpage =Fluorogenic probes and primers= The research team at Biosearch Technologies also developed other fluorescent dyes such as the CAL Fluor, Quasar, and Pulsar series of dyes, which emit fluorescence from 500-700 nanometers. Equipped with the various technology in fluorescent dyes and quenchers, much of Biosearch Technologies' business comes from the design and manufacture of custom probes and primers, which are commonly used for genomic applications such as quantitative PCR and SNP genotyping. =ValuPanel reagents= During the 2009 H1N1 Pandemic, Biosearch Technologies became the first to license from the CDC the H1N1 Influenza and Influenza A sub-typing panel signatures. They would later obtain a license for the ‚Äúpdm‚Äù H1N1 signatures as well. With these licenses from the CDC, Biosearch Technologies manufactured probes and primers to discriminate the various flu signatures as part of their ValuPanel Reagents product line. In 2013, Biosearch responded to the Avian Influenza A (H7N9) outbreak in China by providing an H7N9 detection panel. =Stellaris FISH probes= In 2010, Biosearch Technologies acquired an exclusive license to the single molecule fish technology developed by scientists at University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey.http://www.umdnj.edu/cgi- bin/cgiwrap/hpappweb/newsroom.cgi?headline=Foundation+Venture+Capital+Group,+a+Foundation+of+UMDNJ+Affiliate,+Sells+Interest+in+Longevica+Pharmaceuticals The technology is now branded as Stellaris FISH, and is a method of detecting and quantifying mRNA and other long RNA molecules in cell culture or tissue samples. The technology is a refinement of earlier RNA ISH technologies, and uses multiple single labeled DNA oligonucleotide probes to increase sensitivity and specificity. =Design service - RealTimeDesign= Biosearch Technologies offers a free, web-based design service known as RealTimeDesign (RTD) equipped with comprehensive algorithms that allow the software to model and propose quantitative PCR and SNP genotyping assays.

Some of those features include a direct link to NCBI and BLAST databases as well as a selection of user-modifiable parameters.Genetic Engineering News - RealTimeDesign History =Founding= Although Biosearch Technologies was founded in 1993, its roots can be traced back to 1979 when it was preceded by Dr. Ronald Cook's first company, Biosearch, Inc. Biosearch, Inc. experienced 9 years of DNA synthesis instrumentation and chemistry by playing a key role in engineering and manufacturing one of the first automated solid-phase DNA synthesis instruments, the SAM I. As time progressed, Biosearch was also able to bring other DNA synthesizers to market such as the Biosearch 8700, Biosearch 8800 Prep, and the Cyclone. =Mergers and acquisitions= In 1987, Biosearch was acquired by New Brunswick Scientific,New Brunswick Scientific's Company History on Answers.com who sold the Biosearch unit to Millipore Corporation in 1988.Millipore Corporation's Company History on Answers.com By 1989, Biosearch was renamed Milligen- Biosearch. Due to the loss of several corporate officers, Milligen-Biosearch was subsequently acquired by PerSeptive Biosystems which in turn was acquired by Applied Biosystems who eventually retired the Biosearch name and products. After taking a short hiatus, Dr. Cook decided to return to the oligonucleotide industry and founded what is currently known as Biosearch Technologies, Inc.The Biosearch Story on Biosearchtech.com In 2013, Biosearch acquired the oligonucleotide manufacturing arm of DNA Technology and the entirety of VitraBio, a maker of porous glass. =Recognition in PCR research= When Kary Mullis received the Nobel Prize in 1993 and gave his Nobel Lecture concerning his invention of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, he gratefully acknowledged Biosearch and Dr. Cook's role in providing him one of the first SAM I DNA synthesizers which was used in support of Kary Mullis' PCR research.Kary B.

From there, they went on a procession to the station church. Sometimes the procession would stop at churches or shrines along the way to hold a short devotion to the stations of the Cross. Collecta processions took place on days of penance, such as the ember days, the feast of Candlemas, on Ash Wednesday and several weekdays in Lent.

It belongs to the genus Fundulus in the killifish and topminnow family, Fundulidae. It can grow up to 12.9 centimetres in length and 21.4 grams in weight. The male is dark green with a yellow underside and a dark spot on the dorsal fin when spawning. The female is brown or olive in colour, paler below. It was formerly common in fresh and brackish ponds and marshes throughout Bermuda. It has a declined as a result of destruction and modification of its habitat by humans and was listed as a protected species in the Bermuda Protected Species Act of 2003. It is currently known from just seven ponds: Mangrove Lake, Trott's Pond, West and East Walsingham Ponds, Warwick Pond, Evan's Pond and an introduced population in Blue Hole Pond. The populations in Lover's Lake and Bartram's Pond are now thought to be a separate species, Lover's Lake killifish (F. relictus). Some other populations of Bermuda killifish may also be separate species. Its omnivorous diet includes green algae, molluscs, crustaceans and insects.

As noted by Edward Castronova in Synthetic Worlds: The Business and Culture of Online Games, the boundary delineating this space \\"can be considered a shield of sorts, protecting the fantasy world from the outside world\\".. Instead of being impenetrable, however, an examination of contemporary virtual worlds reveals that the magic circle is actually quite porous. More directly, there appears to be a relationship between virtual worlds and the outside world. Even though virtual worlds display a range of attributes that are unique to their realm, they also exhibit characteristics deriving from the outside world. Castronova uses the term \\"synthetic world\\" because a synthetic world \\"cannot be sealed completely; people are crossing it all the time in both directions, carrying their behavioral assumptions and attitudes with them\\". As this suggests, elements of synthetic worlds are being evaluated in terms of their importance in the outside world. These newly established values, subsequently, gain significance on both sides of the membrane. Thus, it becomes difficult to determine the meaning of the word \\"virtual\\". As stated by Castronova, the \\"allegedly 'virtual' is blending so smoothly into the allegedly 'real' as to make the distinction increasingly difficult to see\\".. Origin of the term The term magic circle has been attributed to Dutch historian Johan Huizinga (1872‚Äì1945). In Homo Ludens: A Study of the Play-Element in Culture, Huizinga wrote:. However, Johan Huizinga never really said that a game is a magic circle. What he said was that a magic circle like many other cultural activities may have game-like characteristics. The term Magic Circle was coined by Eric Zimmerman and Frank Lantz in 1999 and popularized by Eric Zimmerman and Katie Salen in 2003. Eric Zimmerman admits this in his 2012 essay \\"Jerked Around by the Magic Circle ‚Äì Clearing the Air Ten Years Later\\" writingZimmermna, E. Feb. 7, 2012. Jerked Around by the Magic Circle ‚Äì Clearing the Air Ten Years Later. Gamasutra.: Application to digital media The concept of the Magic Circle was applied to digital games by Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman in Rules of Play: Game Design Fundamentals.. Salen and Zimmerman note that even though \\"the magic circle is merely one of the examples in Huizinga's list of 'play-grounds', the term is used ... [by him] as short-hand for the idea of a special place in time and space created by a game\\".. In more detail, they describe: Salen and Zimmerman argue that \\"the term magic circle is appropriate because there is in fact something genuinely magical that happens when a game begins\\". Within video games, the magic circle concept is often used in the game's introductory screens to help establish that the player should prepare to embrace the game's world; some examples include the opening of Super Mario Bros. 3, where the game starts with the lifting of a stage curtain that is a framing device for the game, and in Hearthstone, where the voice of a bartender welcomes the player to take a seat at his tavern. Steven Conway, writing for Gamasutra, used the notion of the magic circle to identify when video games actually break the fourth wall. Conway defines the magic circle for a video game as encompassing both the game, and the way the player actually views and interacts with the game. Some games which are claimed to break the fourth wall are instead expansions of the magic circle to encompass the player and the video game hardware to create a stronger immersion into the game, Conway argues. For example, Evidence: The Last Ritual requires the player to read email sent to them in real-life and view web pages to proceed, which Conway explains is encompassing the player within the magic circle. True fourth wall breaking occurs when some aspect crosses the magic circle and breaks the illusion, such as when the title character in Max Payne, in a drug-induced haze, starts describing himself as a video game character and details what the player sees on their user interface while playing the game. Examples of permeability According to Castronova, there are several areas that reflect the obscuring of the distinction between the real and the virtual. Three of these areas consist of \\"markets, politics, and law\\". =Markets= Online marketplace listing for World of Warcraft accounts Virtual worlds usually contain their own currency. Thus, virtual goods and services have a certain monetary value associated with them. Moreover, many activities in these worlds require a certain degree of skill as well as commitment from the user, which adds to this value. The worth of goods and services, though, is not restricted to the virtual realm. While external markets, including eBay, sell content from synthetic worlds, virtual items gain importance in the outside world. As Castronova points out, \\"the existence of external markets makes every good inside the membrane just as real as the goods outside of it\\".. In fact, there are Third World factories that are specialized in looting synthetic worlds for currency and other rewards. According to David Barboza, \\"the trading of virtual property is so lucrative that some big online gaming companies [as well] have jumped into the business, creating their own online marketplaces\\".David Barboza, \\"Ogre to Slay? Outsource it to Chinese\\", The New York Times. Such marketplaces, however, exert pressures onto the economy of synthetic worlds. Castronova states that in worlds where the farming of loot has developed, \\"the value of gold pieces against the dollar rapidly drops and, therefore, the value of assets obtained by everyone in the game drops as well\\".. =Politics= World of Warcraft online forum Another example that illustrates the blurring of the distinction between the real and the virtual is related to politics and the concept of fairness within synthetic worlds. Castronova states that users \\"are a community of interests who are affected by the decisions of a coding authority, usually the game developers\\". Communication between users and the coding authority takes place in online discussion forums outside the synthetic world. Here, users can discuss issues of fairness they have experienced and pose suggestions for improving the world. By referring to the MMORPG World of Warcraft, Constance Steinkuehler and Marjee Chmiel mention that players \\"convene in online discussion forums to discuss and debate the merits of different builds, at times even refusing to play with others who have made choices that go against the communal wisdom developed therein\\".. Even though there are political activities inside synthetic worlds, \\"debates, which really do involve legitimate political interests, almost always occur outside the membrane rather than inside it\\".. Since game developers are seeking profit, they have to pay attention to these debates and, if necessary, adjust the rules within their products. Castronova notes:. =Law= Avatar in Second Life The third area blending the understanding of the real and the virtual is linked with ideas regarding property. As the acquisition of currency, items, and skills within synthetic worlds is usually tied with a considerable time dedication of users as well as their individual abilities, people often gain the sense of owning their achievements in cyberspace. In May 2006, for example, Kathleen Craig wrote: \\"In what might be a first-of-its-kind lawsuit, a Pennsylvania lawyer is suing the publisher of the rapidly growing online world Second Life, alleging the company [closed his account and] unfairly confiscated tens of thousands of dollars worth of his virtual land and other property.\\"Kathleen Craig, \\"Second Life Land Deal Goes Sour\\", Wired. Consequently, in October 2007, an entry in the \\"Blog\\" section of the Second Life website declared that both parties have agreed to settle the lawsuit and that the lawyer's \\"account, privileges, and responsibilities to the Second Life community have been restored\\".Marty Linden. \\"Resolution of Lawsuit\\", Second Life. According to Castronova, \\"the obvious economic value of the interests present in synthetic worlds has led to some notion of value under the laws of Earth; law is another site where virtual and real are blending together\\".. In culture According to Castronova, our culture \\"has moved beyond the point\\" where distinctions between the virtual and the real are helpful.. He concludes:. In the culture of gaming Economic, political, and legal activity that cross the membrane between the synthetic worlds and the Earth exists to blur any real distinction between what is synthetic and what is insistently real. These examples may be affected more generally to gaming as a collective. Games have become such a central part of living that the differences between game and real life is starting to become blurred. Continual development in the culture of gaming may be seen in various behavior and practices. For example, when a pilot of a plane receives instructions from an air traffic controller, at that very same moment, somewhere in the world, there is someone flying a simulation of that plane, or something like it, on a similar flight path, and that person also receiving path instructions from a controller; all of this is occurring through VATSIM.net, a virtual air traffic simulation system. Through the website, flight simulation has adapted into a multiplayer format, and ordinary people get to interact as pilots and interact with air traffic controllers to create a natural reproduction of actual air traffic. The political movements that happen inside and outside games, for now, mostly concentrate on the games themselves. A gamer's day consists of switching between the game life and real life. But while one is sitting in front of their computer and is engaged in the synthetic game world, they are just as likely to discuss the day's weather as they are talking about the game, whilst chatting with a friend in-game. The distinction between labeling an act that strictly occurs in the game, and something that happens out of game (i.e. checking email about getting \\"gold\\" pieces in the game world) becomes inconsequential; the two worlds inevitably must interact with one another..

In 1994 UNESCO designated Villa Gazzotti Grimani as part of the \\"Vicenza, City of Palladio\\" World Heritage Site. Two years later the World Heritage Site was expanded to include Palladian villas outside the core area and accordingly it was renamed as \\"City of Vicenza and Palladian Villas of the Veneto\\".  Architecture  Panorama retro The villa was designed and built in the 1540s for the Venetian Taddeo Gazzotti and, like a number of Palladio's buildings, it incorporates a pre- existing structure. In 1550, before the building was completed, Gazzotti was facing financial problems and sold the villa to Girolamo Grimani. The external form of the villa shows the person who commissioned it to have been a man who wanted to make his influence clearly visible. For the first time Palladio presents the body of the building as a clearly defined cube. The three-fold arcade in the central section, which is reminiscent of Villa Godi, is crowned by a pediment and is the dominant shape of the facade. It is less the embodiment of an original body of thought of Palladio's ‚Äì comparable examples can be found both in Villa Agostini in Cusignana and in the architecture of Giovanni Maria Falconetto ‚Äì than of his endeavour to give existing forms of new expression. What is new is that the three-fold arcade takes up the entire height of the one-story building. Equally, the use of a pediment as a symbol of dignity has no counterpart in Venetian secular architecture of that time. A wide flight of steps was originally meant to lead up to the loggia; the narrow flight of steps which now leads up to the center arcade in the loggia is a latter addition. The body of the building rests on a base, from which it is divided by means of a ledge which runs along the entire width of the facade. On the one hand, this serves to protect the working areas from damp, but on the other hand, it also raises the villa above the surrounding landscape. This use of a base is to be found in a number of Palladio's villas, but it was not his invention; Giovanni Maria Falconetto placed the Villa Vescovile in Luvigliano, which was begun in 1534, on a base. Villa Gazzotti pianta Bertotti Scamozzi 1778.jpg|Floor plan, drawn by Ottavio Bertotti Scamozzi, 1778 Villa Gazzotti sezione Bertotti Scamozzi 1778.jpg|Cross section (Ottavio Bertotti Scamozzi, 1778) Along with this adoption of contemporary architectural thinking, the Villa Gazzotti also shows what was in the Venetian territories a new way of treating wall surfaces. It is not the closed parts of the facade, but the open loggia which takes up the dominating position on the villa's facade. Beyond this, the way in which Palladio treats his facade makes it clearly recognisable that it is his intention to give the wall surface plastic structure. Eight pilasters with Composite capitals that project gently from the surface of the wall divide the facade into eight vertical rhythms. At the same time, the central part, distinguished by its three-fold arcade, is offset slightly from the rest of the facade. The windows are connected firmly to the body of the building by means of a lower window ledge which runs along the entire width of the facade and is offset along with pedestals of the pilasters. In contrast to the Villa Godi and the Villa Piovene, the windows are no longer merely perforations in the wall, but through their plastic profiles and the protruding triangular gables at their tops have become independent structural elements on the facade. Even though Palladio endeavoured to open up the wall, which is usually seen as a border, the facade of Villa Gazzotti still has a lot of unshaped wall surface above the windows. Nonetheless, the multiple layering of the wall by means of the arrangement of pilasters, window profiles and triangular gables is a clear indication that Palladio is now endeavouring to model and shape the massive body of the building derived from Venetian two-towered buildings through the use of a plastic structure and wide openings. The capitals, which conclude the pilasters, carry a multiple offset and variously-terraced entablature. The villa is currently in need of restoration, particularly the exterior stucco which has peeled to expose the underlying brickwork. The restored Villa Saraceno is an example of how impressive restored stucco can look.

The One was also a very basic model that used drum brakes front and rear as opposed to a hydraulic front disc on more expensive models. Similarly, the One was a kick start only model whereas others were available with electric start. Also the One model runs on a generator instead of a 12 volt battery like other models and many other Peugeot scooters, this causes the indicators to be very dim, the horn to be poor sounding and quiet and there to be no lights on the small dash other than a two-stroke warning light.

It was established in 1974 and is currently published by SAGE Publications. The managing editor is Ronald Chilcote, Edward A. Dickson Emeritus Professor of Economics and Political Science at the University of California, Riverside. LAP is the #1 journal in the Latin American Studies category of Google Scholar Metrics.  History  Latin American Perspectives emerged from the political and intellectual ferment of the late 1960s and early 1970s, notably the civil rights and anti-war movements that raised concerns about social justice and questioned the rationale and goals of U.S. foreign policy. Young academics, influenced by the work of radical scholars like C. Wright Mills and Paul Baran, critical of U.S. intervention in Latin America, and supportive of movements for social change, particularly the Cuban Revolution, formed the Union of Radical Latin Americanists (URLA) under the direction of Chilcote and Joel Edelstein within the Latin American Studies Association (LASA). Their objectives included opening up the field to methodological approaches including Marxism and to cutting edge work by Latin American theorists and scholars. They urged LASA to create a new journal that would reflect these concerns, and the LASA membership approved a resolution in support. Chilcote was invited by LASA to develop a proposal for an alternative journal in 1970. However, after LASA failed to secure support from the Ford Foundation and it was unable to fund the proposed journal, the project was carried forward by Chilcote and a group based in Southern California, who were also involved in the Los Angeles Group for Latin American Solidarity (LAGLAS) which at the time was very active in solidarity with Allende‚Äôs Chile. In May 1973, on behalf of the Southern California group, Chilcote and fellow URLA member William Bollinger presented a proposal for a new journal to the URLA members at the LASA Congress in Madison, Wisconsin, who approved the idea. Subsequently the Southern California group decided to proceed with an independent journal and announced its decision in a September 1973 report to the URLA. In addition to Chilcote and Bollinger, the founders included Frances Chilcote, Donald Bray, Marjorie Bray, Timothy Harding, Norma Chinchilla and Carlos Mu√±oz. Other progressive Southern California academics soon joined the collective, including Nora Hamilton, Richard Harris and Michel Kearney. Many members of the core group had been graduate students at Stanford University where they worked on the Hispanic American Report, edited by Ronald Hilton, which was best known for having revealed in 1960 CIA preparations for the upcoming Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in April 1961. Coming from disciplines such as history, political science, and sociology, they had done research in Latin American countries including Chile, Mexico, Peru, and Brazil and become committed to supporting movements for social justice and revolutionary change. The founders decided that the new journal would be different not only in content but in its organization, with decisions made by a democratic editorial collective. Ronald Chilcote was elected managing editor, a post he has held ever since. They also decided to publish primarily thematic issues that could examine topics in depth from multiple perspectives. From the beginning, the journal sought contributors from Latin America and assumed the cost of translating manuscripts from Spanish, Portuguese, and occasionally French, a policy that made it unique in the field. The collective recruited leading progressive scholars from the United States and Latin America to serve as editor-reviewers with an approximately equal representation from each geographic area.  Political Orientation  The journal rejected the idea of scholarship as politically neutral but also eschewed dogmatic and sectarian approaches to political economic and social analysis. The founders‚Äô statement in the first issue affirmed their commitment to intellectually rigorous analysis that contributed not only to understanding Latin American reality, but to developing viable strategies for transforming social structures. Describing itself as ‚Äúa journal on capitalism and socialism,‚Äù LAP prioritized political economic analysis that examined power and class relations nationally and internationally and it welcomed articles from a diversity of disciplines and political viewpoints, including the various currents of Marxism.  Intellectual Trajectory  The journal‚Äôs initial engagement with capitalism and imperialism in Latin America highlighted the debate then underway among intellectuals on the left over the nature of the region‚Äôs insertion in the international political and economic order. Known as dependency theory, this body of work challenged the developmentalism or modernization theory then dominant in mainstream U.S. social science. It focused on the disparities in wealth and power between Latin American countries and the centers of Western capitalist development, with the United States as the hegemon, and their impact on Latin American economic, political, and social structures. Dependent development was understood as the subordination of Latin America‚Äôs independent development to the interests of foreign capital, enforced by U.S. intervention through support for oligarchic and bourgeois parties, coups against reformist and nationalist leaders, and direct military intervention, when other methods failed. Some dependency theorists advocated autonomous capitalist development with a nationalist bourgeoisie as a progressive force. Others saw socialism under working class leadership as the only alternative. Despite the often strong disagreements among writers identified as dependency theorists, their analysis raised key questions about the nature of class relations and possible political alliances to overcome underdevelopment, the viability of national capitalism, the changing nature of imperialism, and other issues that became important topics for the journal. While welcoming the challenge to mainstream theory, much of the work the journal published critiqued weaknesses in the dependency approach, frequently from a Marxist perspective. The journal‚Äôs analysis of capitalism also included thematic issues on specific social sectors such as the working class and the peasantry as well as on the class nature of the state in different countries. The journal‚Äôs approach was evident in its first two issues which exemplified the application of Marxist political economic and class analysis to a particular topic or to a country or region. The inaugural issue ‚ÄúDependency Theory: A Reassessment,‚Äù published in Spring 1974, included an introductory overview of the main tendencies within dependency theory by Chilcote and contributions from major Latin American theorists of the different dependency currents, including Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Theot√¥nio Dos Santos, Rodolfo Stavenhagen, and Andr√© Gunder Frank. The second issue: ‚ÄúChile: Blood on the Peaceful Road,‚Äù published in Summer 1974, offered critical perspectives on the coup that had taken place less than a year before. It featured a class analysis of the Allende period and critiqued U.S. policy using an imperialism framework. In its early years LAP also applied political economic and class analysis to other controversial topics such as the Cuban Revolution as well as three thematic issues on the relationship between feminism and Marxism, and three issues on the role of the peasantry. The journal also became a venue for articles examining strategies for social change. It included debates over reformist versus revolutionary approaches as well as debates over the priorities and strategies for revolutionary movements in power. The journal‚Äôs questioning of capitalism was complemented by articles that explicitly advocated socialism and debated alternative visions of socialist society. The interest in socialism was reflected in on-going analysis of the Cuban Revolution, examining issues, such as the role of moral vs. material incentives, both theoretically and empirically. The first issue on the revolution was published in December 1975. From then through 2013, the journal published over 100 articles and book reviews on Cuba, some in issues specifically on the revolution, others in broader thematic issues. Of particular significance were the Spring 1991 issue ‚ÄúCuban Views on the Revolution‚Äù that was the first U.S. anthology of articles entirely by Cuban authors and the three issues in January, March, and May 2009 that marked the revolution‚Äôs fiftieth anniversary and included an introductory statement from the editorial collective both celebrating the revolution‚Äôs achievements and identifying unresolved problems. In the 1980s, Central America became a prominent theme, with four issues specifically on the Sandinista revolution and four more on the broader revolutionary struggles in the region. The journal‚Äôs study of capitalism was closely related to examination of imperialism, which was the dominant framework for analyzing U.S.-Latin American relations and the role of foreign capital in Latin America. In addition to criticism of U.S. foreign policy, especially its role in the armed conflicts in Central America in the 1980s, articles considered the changing nature of transnational investment in the wake of free trade agreements primarily the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and labor-capital relations in new forms of production such as maquiladoras. With the ascendancy of the ‚ÄúWashington Consensus‚Äù promoted by Reagan and Thatcher that imposed neoliberalism on Latin America, the journal increasingly published critiques of the consequences of neoliberal economic and social policies such as the privatization of state industries and austerity budgets with sharp reductions in state services. Neoliberalism became a major topic in the journal and articles examined the interrelated economic and social restructuring at many levels, including the workplace, the family and community as well as from national and regional perspectives. Neoliberalism was implemented within the multiple, interrelated processes of transnationalization that were generally described in combination as globalization. LAP authors challenged the mainstream view that corporate-led globalization was desirable or at least inevitable. Notably, a November 2002 issue examined contending perspectives with most authors considering corporate-led globalization as a contemporary form of imperialism. Given the large scale international movements of workers in response to globalization and neoliberalism, migration became a theme addressed in several thematic issues as well as in individual articles. After 1990, the journal‚Äôs content reflected political and theoretical changes within the left. The electoral defeat of the Sandinistas, the military stalemate and political settlement that ended the armed struggle in El Salvador, in the context of the collapse of the Soviet Union and Eastern European regimes created a new political environment that seemed to foreclose revolutionary outcomes in the foreseeable future. In the meantime, new mass political forces such as the Brazilian Workers Party (PT) and the Chilean Concertaci√≥n were taking shape and achieving electoral success. Grassroots movements challenging neoliberalism emerged in most of Latin American countries from the Zapatistas in Chiapas to the urban piqueteros (unemployed activists) in Argentina. Analysis of this new political conjuncture and emerging social movements became another major focus for the journal, which published several thematic issues on social movements in addition to many individual articles. As leftist and left-leaning governments were elected in numerous Latin American countries in a so-called ‚Äúpink tide,‚Äù special issues focused on the transformations in individual countries as well as on the hemispheric development of a new 21st century left or 21st century socialism. This included consideration of the importance of indigenous movements in the coalitions bringing to power the leftist MAS (Movement toward Socialism) under Evo Morales in Bolivia and the Revoluci√≥n Ciudadana (Citizens‚Äô Revolution) under Rafael Correa in Ecuador and analysis of their innovative political and constitutional principles such as plurinationalism and buen vivir (living well) as foundations of governance and social policy. The journal also addressed new currents of critical theory. Gramsci‚Äôs concepts of ideology, hegemony, civil society and ‚Äúwars of position‚Äù became influential in analysis of Latin America‚Äôs new social movements and their political strategies. The journal also published work that critically examined Foucault, Laclau, and other theorists broadly characterized as ‚Äúpost- Marxist,‚Äù notably in a Spring 1990 article by Chilcote on ‚ÄúPost-Marxism: The Retreat from Class in Latin America‚Äù and continued to emphasize Marxist class analysis. The journal also responded to post Cold War U.S. policy in Latin America, including the disjuncture between rhetoric and reality under president Obama. The LAP editorial collective issued a critical statement on Obama‚Äôs Latin American policy ‚ÄúDangerous Complacencies: Obama, Latin America, and the Misconceptions of Power‚Äù in a special issue on Obama and Latin America in July 2011. Although LAP had published pioneering issues and articles on women and culture in the 1970s, these themes became more prominent in recent years. The journal‚Äôs content on women expanded to a broader consideration of gender and sexuality and there was increased attention to the arts and media in issues on documentary film, culture and memory, narco-culture, and on the arts, performance and cultural resistance. The journal‚Äôs increased attention to art included its own format, which introduced covers with color photographs in 2007. It also welcomes photographs, especially by Latin American artists, to illustrate articles, and publishes photo essays. In 2012, the journal co- published Mexico at the Hour of Combat, a book of rare photographs of the Mexican Revolution by Sabina Osuna, edited by Chilcote. In 2013, the journal began a new initiative that involved streaming Latin American documentary films as well as incorporating film reviews into journal issues. A list of all issue themes through November 2013 was published in the 40th anniversary issue, which featured an intellectual history of the journal by Jawdat Abu-El- Haj, based on research conducted as a visiting LAP Fellow at the University of California Riverside library.  LAP Fellowships  Since 2007, LAP has offered fellowships for visiting scholars to use the resources at the University of California, Riverside library that include the complete LAP archives and the Ronald H. Chilcote Collection of material on the politics, economy, and history of Latin America, Portugal, and Portuguese-speaking Africa. Highlights include rare books and periodicals on Brazilian left movements, cordel literature, political ephemera, and recorded interviews. Fellows present their research to the LAP collective as well as to students and faculty at UCR and other area colleges. Articles based on the research are subsequently published in LAP. Fellowship recipients include Adam Morton, University of Nottingham, Francisco L√≥pez Segrera, Universidad de Salamanca, Jawdat Abu El-Haj, Universidad Federal de Cear√°, Luis Su√°rez Salazar, Universidad de Habana, Kemy Oyarz√∫n, Universidad de Chile, Carlos G√≥mez Florent√≠n, SUNY Stony Brook and Universidad Nacional de Asunci√≥n.

Since 2019, the Austrian Ambassador to the United States is Martin Weiss  History  = History of relations prior to World War I = The Archduchy of Austria never held any colonies in the Americas. Nevertheless, a few Austrians did settle in what would become the United States prior to the 19th Century, including a group of fifty families from Salzburg, exiled for being Lutherans in a predominantly Catholic state, who established their own community in Ebenezer, Georgia in 1734. Austria stayed neutral during the American Revolutionary War, eventually joining the First League of Armed Neutrality, a league of European states organized by Catherine the Great of Russia during the war to protect neutral shipping, which was often under the threat of being seized or interrupted by the Royal Navy. Austria, as the epicenter of an empire ruled by a monarch, was initially reluctant to support the American Revolution, given that the goal of the revolution was to liberate a group of colonies from the tyrannical rule of a foreign monarch. The Continental Congress had tried to establish diplomatic relations in 1777 by sending William Lee to Vienna, but the Austrian government did not officially receive him. Eventually, Austria did officially recognize the United States as an independent country when, in 1797, Conrad Frederick Wagner was accepted as U.S. Consul at Trieste. U.S. diplomats to Austria served in the Habsburg-held cities of Trieste and Venice before an American consulate was established in Vienna on October 10, 1829 (followed by the establishment of a U.S. legation in Vienna headed by Henry A.P. Muhlenberg in 1838, with the elevation to embassy status occurring in 1902). The United States and the Austrian Empire signed a treaty regarding commerce and navigation in 1829. An Austrian legation headed by Baron de Mareschal arrived in Washington, D.C. in 1838. Serious strains occurred in the relations between the two countries as a result of the Revolutions of 1848. Professor Stephen Tuffnell states: :In its frequent and blundering breaches of etiquette with the Habsburgs, American domestic politics were, as ever, catalytic. Thus, as national-separatist revolutions broke open across the European continent in 1848, ebullient support of Lajos Kossuth and the Hungarian 48ers in the United States drove Washington and Vienna into conflict. Pro-Hungarian fervour in the Senate and Democratic press, stoked by Lewis Cass; State Department flirtation with the recognition of Hungarian independence in the Taylor and Fillmore Presidencies; and, finally, the latter's 1851 'rescue' of Kossuth from the Ottoman Empire on board the USS Mississippi precipitated a breach in relations. Only the death of Daniel Webster, a major opponent of reconciliation, averted the crisis.Stephen Tuffnell, review of Sovereignty Transformed: U.S.-Habsburg Relations from 1815 to the Paris Peace Conference, (review no. 1556) online Both Austria-Hungary and the United States were part of the Eight-Nation Alliance that intervened in the Boxer Rebellion in China from 1899 to 1901. Over two million people from the Austro-Hungarian Empire immigrated to the United States throughout the 19th Century, though because of the empire's multi-ethnic status, it is difficult to determine how many of these immigrants were ethnic Austrians. By 1900, over 275,000 Austrian Americans lived in the United States, with most coming over during the latter half of the 19th Century, settling primarily in New York, California, Pennsylvania, Florida, New Jersey, and various Midwestern states like Ohio and Illinois. Over 60% of these immigrants came from Burgenland. = World War I and World War II = In 1917, the United States declared war on the Austro- Hungarian Empire alongside the German Empire after being drawn into the First World War. The war caused diplomatic relations between the United States and the Austro-Hungarian Empire to be terminated on April 8, 1917 and caused a dramatic decrease in Austrian immigration to the United States. The Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, negotiated between the Allies and Austria following the war, officially dissolved the Austro-Hungarian Empire and created the First Austrian Republic. The United States never ratified the Treaty of Saint- Germaine-en-Laye. Instead, the United States negotiated its own peace treaty with Austria in 1921. The United States officially recognized the independence of the First Austrian Republic on August 24, 1921. Nazi Germany annexed the First Austrian Republic in March 1938 in an event known as the Anschluss. The United States closed its legation to Austria on April 30, 1938. Following World War II, the United States and the Allies occupied Austria from 1945 to 1955. The occupation ended when the Allies signed the Austrian State Treaty, which re-established Austria as a sovereign state, creating the modern-day country of the Second Austrian Republic. The U.S. played an important role in Austria's reconstruction after World War II, via the Marshall Plan. = History of relations since World War II = U.S. President Barack Obama and Austrian Chancellor Werner Faymann, 2009. Vienna has frequently been chosen as the venue of key superpower summit meetings, like the Vienna summit in June 1961, with U.S. President John F. Kennedy and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, or the SALT II agreement in June 1979, with U.S. President Jimmy Carter and Soviet General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev. In February 1984, the President of Austria Rudolf Kirchschl√§ger paid a state visit to the United States. It was the first state visit of an Austrian President to the United States. In September 1995, U.S. President Bill Clinton invited the President of Austria Thomas Klestil for a working visit to Washington, D.C., which took place on October 19. On June 21, 2006, U.S. President George W. Bush held bilateral talks with the President of Austria Heinz Fischer at the Hofburg Imperial Palace in Vienna, together with U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Foreign Minister of Austria Ursula Plassnik, shortly before a US- European Union summit. President Barack Obama met Chancelor Werner Faymann when Obama visited Prague on April 5, 2009. President Donald Trump met with Chancellor Sebastian Kurz for a bilateral meeting in February 2019 with the aim of \\"revitalizing the bilateral relationship between the United States and exploring new avenues for transatlantic cooperation...look[ing] to address both global conflicts and those in the European neighborhood, promote economic prosperity, and strengthen energy security.\\" U.S. and Austrian troops fought side by side during the NATO intervention in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Kosovo (despite the fact that Austria is not a part of NATO).

Its name is attributed to the root word kamin', from the Slavic word for stone. Historical accounts date Kamianets-Podilskyi Castle to the early 14th century, although recent archaeological evidence has proved human existence in the area back to the 12th or 13th century. Initially built to protect the bridge connecting the city with the mainland, the castle sits on top of a peninsula carved out by the winding Smotrych River, forming a natural defense system for Kamianets-Podilskyi's historic Old Town neighborhood. Its location on a strategic transport crossroad in Podolia made the castle a prime target for foreign invaders, who rebuilt the castle to suit their own needs, adding to its multicultural architectural diversity. Specifically, the complex consists of the Old Town fortified by King Casimir IV, the Old Castle rebuilt by Kings Sigismund I and Stephen B√°thory, and the New Castle founded by Kings Sigismund III and W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV. However, in spite of the many architectural and engineering changes to the original structure, the castle still forms a coherent architectural design, being one of the few medieval constructions in modern-day Ukraine that is relatively well preserved. Along with the Old Town neighborhood, the castle is listed as part of the National Historical-Architectural Sanctuary \\"Kam'ianets\\" and the National Environmental Park \\"Podilski Tovtry\\". The complex is a candidate UNESCO World Heritage Site, nominated in 1989 by the Ukrainian representatives, and also one of the Seven Wonders of Ukraine. Today, Kamianets-Podilskyi Castle is the most recognized landmark of the city, serving as an important regional and national tourist attraction. History =Foundation and early history= French map depicting the Kamianets Old Town neighborhood and castle Traditionally, Kamianets-Podilskyi Castle was thought to have been founded during the second half of the 14th century, as the first accurate historical accounts of the castle date back to the mid-14th century, when most of the territories of western Rus' were under control of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. A written document by Prince Yuriy Koriatovych in 1374, for example, mentions that the Magdeburg rights would be presented to Kamianets inside the castle. Archaeological excavations during the 1960s, however, provided contrasting evidence suggesting that the castle might date back even earlier to the end of the 12th or the beginning of the 13th centuries. It is also clear from historical and archaeological evidence that an earthen fortress existed in the area during the time of the East Slavic state of Kievan Rus', but not on the same site as the current castle. The castle was outdated but remained vital to the defense of Kamianets and nearby trade routes; as a result, the voivode of Krak√≥w, Spytek of Melsztyn, began modernizing the complex at the turn of the 15th century.Pyaterikov, Sergey \\"The old fortress on the Smotrych River\\", Zerkalo Nedeli, ‚Ññ 24 (399), 28 June‚Äî5 July 2002 (in Russian , Ukrainian ) During the reconstruction, the old towers were renovated and ten new towers were added. A century and a half later, the castle was updated again, this time by military engineer and architect Hiob Bretfus, who built the New Western and Eastern Towers, the castle's eastern wall and an underground gallery, as well as the Full Gates and housing for the town's starosta community. =Continuous attacks by invaders= An old lithograph depicting the castle walls with a settlement underneath, which still exists today During the mid-14th to mid-15th centuries, Kamianets-Podilskyi Castle was located on one of the main frontiers of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. From 1434 until its annexation by the Russian Empire in 1793, the castle played a major role in the defense against the oncoming Cossack, Ottoman and Tatar invasions; from the 15th through 17th centuries, the castle was attacked by Tatar hordes a total of 51 times. The Tatar invasions of 1448, 1451, 1509 and 1528, as well as the Ottoman siege of 1533, caused damage to both the castle and the city but all of these invasions were successfully repelled. Kamianets-Podilskyi Castle played an important role during the Khmelnytsky Uprising between 1648‚Äì54, when the Zaporozhian Cossacks led by Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky, allied themselves with the Crimean Tatars and the local Ukrainian peasantry against the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth's army and militia. During the uprising, the castle was unsuccessfully besieged by local Cossacks and insurgents led by Commander Maksym Kryvonis. In 1651, the castle was then subject to another Cossack siege led by Hetman Ivan Bohun, before an unexpected counterattack by Polish insurgents under commanders Aleksandrenka and Chuika re-established the Polish presence in the area and relieved the siege. A 60,000 force army led by Khmelnytsky himself reasserted Cossack control over the castle in 1652. Just one year later, the castle was attacked yet again, this time by a 40,000 strong Crimean Tatar horde. Ustym Karmaliuk. Vasily Tropinin, c. 1820s oil on canvas. State Tretyakov Gallery, Moscow. In the beginning of August 1672, a 300,000 Ottoman force led by Sultan Mehmed IV and a 40,000 combined force of Tatars and Cossacks led by Hetman Petro Doroshenko laid siege to the castle. After conducting negotiations with their attackers, the city's leaders surrendered control of the fortress to the Ottomans on August 18. In a sign of protest, the fortress's Commandant Micha≈Ç Wo≈Çodyjowski and Major Hejking blew up the castle's remaining gunpowder, killing themselves along with 800 defenders. For 27 years after the attack, the fortress served as the base of Ottoman rule in Podolia. The 1699 Karlov Peace Treaty saw the return of Polish control over the area after the Ottoman Empire ceded its control in the area. =From a castle to a prison= From the beginning of the 18th century, Kamianets-Podilskyi Castle had lost its defensive role, and was used more as a military prison than a military fortification. Numerous people were executed or held captive in the prison, including Cossack starshynas (officers), haidamakas, and even the three-year-old pretender to the Polish throne, Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski. Even though it had lost its defensive role, it was one of the strongest fortresses in the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland up until the Second Partition of Poland of April 21, 1793. when both Kamianets- Podilskyi Castle and the city were transferred to the sovereignty of the Russian Empire. On the same day, the castle's commandant gave up the key to the castle and swore allegiance to the empire in the city's cathedral. One hundred and one artillery cannons later saluted the commandant's decision inside the castle. During the French invasion of Russia of 1812, the Russian Imperial Army was stationed in the castle. In 1815, Konstantin Batyushkov, who later became a well-known poet and writer, was stationed as an officer in the castle. In 1846, poet Vladimir Raevsky was stationed in the castle, during which time he established a pro-Decembrist organization of progressively- minded army officers. From 1816 until 1914, the fortress was converted from a military prison into a jail for debtors, criminals and political prisoners. In 1831, Russian lexicologist Vladimir Dal worked in the castle, at the time writing a dictionary of the Russian language. The castle was the center of the anti-feudalism movement in the Podolia during the 19th century led by the Patriotic War of 1812 cavalry veteran Ustym Karmaliuk (1787-1835), who is now regarded by Ukrainians as a national folk hero. =Museum and conservation= Interior courtyard and view of the castle's museum After a series of political changes following the 1905 revolution, political parties and organizations were allowed by the law throughout the Russian Empire. In 1906, a total of 67 political organizations were based in the castle. Among them was the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party's newspaper \\"Iskra\\" (Spark). A decree issued by the Sovnarkom of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic in 1928 declared Kamianets-Podilskyi Castle complex a historical-cultural preserve.. During the late 1930s, plans were made to turn the castle into a museum, and reconstruction work on the buildings was started in 1937. Among the museum attractions added was a scene depicting Karmaliuk in the castle's prison cell in the Pope's Tower, where he was kept during his imprisonment in the castle. Visitor numbers for the castle during the 1930s reached 300,000 a year. In 1947, Kamianets-Podilskyi Castle was placed on the all-Union list of historic preserves. A memorial plaque and a bas-relief resembling Karmaliuk was erected near the Karmaliuk exposition on April 18, 1958. Restorational and archaeological works have been conducted in the castle since 1962 under the supervision of architects Y. Plamenytska and A. Tyupych. On May 18, 1977, the National Historic-Architectural Reserve \\"Kamianets\\" was established. On September 13, 1989, the Ukrainian SSR Government placed \\"Kamianets\\" reserve on the tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. In 2004, the \\"Kamianets\\" reserve was upgraded to that of a national preservation district. In August 21, 2007, the complex was declared one of the Seven Wonders of Ukraine when it came in 3rd place in a nationwide competition. A severe storm on August 1, 2011 partially destroyed the New Western Tower; the city mayor's office didn't deny that the tower's structural integrity was weakened during its last reconstruction in 2007, paving the way for its collapse just four years later. Architecture Kamianets-Podilskyi Castle rests on a limestone formation surrounded by the Smotrych River canyon. Consequently, its foundations were built using limestone, as well as local and imported brick and stone. Indeed, the castle's name is attributed to the root kamin', from the Slavic word for stone. The two main parts of the castle, the Old Castle () and the New Castle (), were built during different periods. The Old Castle defended the approach from Kamianets-Podilskyi's Old Town, and was constructed to protect against direct assaults from enemy soldiers. The New Castle was formed during the numerous later modernizations of the castle; its purpose was to provide protection from enemy field armies and was designed to support newer military inventions such as long range artillery cannons. =The twelve towers= An important and large fortification complex, Kamianets-Podilskyi Castle had as many as 12 towers, some of which were added during later modernizations to the castle. Some of the towers were located on the peninsula on which the main castle sits; some of the other towers were located on the steep slopes across the Smotrych River. There also were other towers such as the Petty Southern Tower, a Dacia-Roman Tower, while another Dacia-Roman Tower stood just outside the eastern walls and a half tower is located at the western end of the Castle bridge. Of these towers, however, only a few remain unscathed today. Specifically, the 12 towers were the: * Pope's Tower (also known as Karmeliuk's Tower, Julian Tower) was built sometime in the 15th and 16th centuries; an artillery arsenal, powder warehouse, treasury, and a mill were housed within the tower, interconnected with the extensive southern bastion; * Kovpak Tower (also called the Szlachta Tower) an earlier tower originating between the 14th and 16th centuries, where the town's szlachta nobility were quartered; * Tenchynska Tower, from the 14th to 16th centuries, commemorated to the Tƒôczy≈Ñski family; * White Tower (also known as Laska Tower), constructed in the 15th century, which housed an additional artillery arsenal; * Daily Tower (also called the Dzienna Tower), a large tower with a second- floor artillery intersection to move guns into firing position as well as onto the New Western Tower. It also housed a small Lutheran chapel and a smaller \\"orlyk\\" (eaglet), or observation tower, at the top; * New Western Tower (or the Great Tower), built in 1544 and which served as a bastion. The tower contained one of the castle's printing presses, and also provided an artillery platform to cover the vast fields surrounding it. It was damaged in a severe storm in 2011. * R√≥≈ºanka Tower (also known as the Burgrabska or Kreslavska Tower), which was constructed between the 14th and 16th centuries, housed a prison in the tower's basement. It is one of three towers (Tenchynska and Lanckoro≈Ñska) that were finished with specially designed conical vault to draw away the gases from the gunpowder stored there; * Water Tower (also known as the Smotrytska Tower), one of the castle's later constructions dating to the 15th to 18th centuries used to be connected to the castle by the Field Gate, located some distance away from the main compound on the northern side. It contained a well which drew water from the adjacent Smotrych River, and a secret tunnel, whose existence was only known to the local starosta and scribes; * Commandant's Tower, built in the 15th century; * Lanckoro≈Ñska Tower (or the second Laska Tower), built between the 14th and 16th centuries, commemorated to the Lanckoro≈Ñski family; * Black Tower. Only the remains of this tower exist, dating back to the 15th and 16th centuries. It served as a magazine and was blown up in a protest (see earlier history section); * New Eastern Tower, built in 1544. =Fortification walls= The walls of Kamianets-Podilskyi Castle are divided into three sections or terraces; the northern, southern, and eastern. The walls of the northern terrace (about in length) defend the whole inner courtyard. The courtyard's northwestern walls form the Old Castle, ending between the Day and Rozhanka Towers. They are made up of two parallel walls, which include the Petty Western Tower, the remnants of the Black Tower, and a two-level casemate, or fortified gun emplacement. The older of the two walls dates back to the beginning of the 12th century and is built with crenelations. Another casemate was located at the eastern walls. An entrance to the castle in the eastern walls is known as the New Castle Gate, and there were two more gates, one, in the northern walls, called the Old Castle Gate, and another, the Field Gate, connecting the Water Tower with the rest of the castle. The northern walls are reinforced with the Northern Bastion along their whole length. The bastion was built in 1790, just before the second partition of Poland. There is also the New Castle that was designed as a hornwork and located west from the main castle complex. Centuries of additions to the fortification walls add to the castle's architectural diversity At the eastern side of the castle's courtyard were the remnants of the St. Stanislaus Church, next to which was located a tomb of M. Potocki. Next to the Kovpak Tower stood an Eastern Orthodox church where Prince Koriatovych was buried. In the courtyard along the southern walls between Kovpak and Tenchynska Towers were a granary and cart shed. Across from these, near the northern walls and Lanckoro≈Ñska Tower, was the residence of the starosta. Next to the Tenchynska Tower stood the \\"Rurmush\\" which served as a water storage tank for the castle. At the southern walls closer to the White Tower (between Tenchynska and White Towers) were a kitchen and a bakery. Adjacent to the White Tower at the southern walls between White and Day Towers stood the starosta's headquarters. Located against the western walls were the chelyadna, or serfs' quarters, which housed up to 70 serfs who served the castle. Located outside of the northern walls were the castle stables, which could house up to 30 horses. In the 16th century the castle had a garrison of around 300 soldiers, who lived in the town. Closeup of one of the 12 towers The Kamianets-Podilskyi Industrial Vocational School has investigated the castle walls. They discovered an area of quick sand at the roadside next to the \\"Podzamche\\", or sub-castle, neighborhood of the city, which in the previous year had partially undermined the castle's supporting walls. The effects of the quick sand had uncovered the fortress's foundation walls, a little over deep. The foundation walls were built on the limestone that creates a canyon along the river valley. Further excavation work showed that the walls stretched to the west, as well from the Old Castle to the bastions of the new one. The support footings for the old castle bridge were also found in the ditch. From the south in the wall there is a wide and tall opening, through which the Vocational School assumed water flowed. The preserved northwestern walls are now high measured from the outside of the castle and high from the courtyard. As a result of the numerous reconstructions, the walls' depth changed throughout the centuries, being deep in the Medieval period, during the 14th and 15th centuries, and an average of after the reconstruction of the 16th and 17th centuries. Conservation works have recently been conducted on the walls to preserve the old Rus' fragments. =Castle bridge= As a result of the castle's unique location on a peninsula, the castle bridge () serves as the only transport link to the city's Old Town neighborhood. It is considered to represent a considerable feat of medieval engineering. The bridge has a length of . At the entrance to the bridge, its width is around , while at the end, it narrows to . The bridge's height is at the entrance, dropping to on the far side. At the beginning of the 15th century, a large round gate tower was constructed at the castle end of the bridge; the bridge's height, including the tower, was equivalent to that of eight modern stories. During the unsuccessful Polish siege of the city in 1687, the castle bridge was rebuilt and fortified by the Turks, acquiring the name \\"Turkish bridge\\" (), which many locals still call it today. The bridge's stone fa√ßade was in poor repair from 1841 until the end of the 19th century. A subsequent lack of preservation work, together with earthquake damage in 1986, contributed to its poor condition. In 2000, the World Monuments Fund included Kamianets-Podilskyi Castle bridge in the 2000 World Monuments Watch. Legacy Night view of the Kamianets-Podilskyi Castle. Kamianets-Podilskyi Castle was the most recognized attraction in the city in 2005. The castle also sees a large number of tourists from across Ukraine and abroad, attracting thousands of tourists annually. Its legacy has left behind several local legends. According to one legend, when Ottoman Sultan Osman II came to Kamianets in 1621 to capture the city, he was allegedly impressed by its strength and fortifications and asked \\"Who built this great city?\\" . Someone then replied to him, \\"God himself.\\" When Osman could not capture the castle, he then replied \\"Then let God himself take the city.\\" Another local legend has it that Turkish gold is buried in the Smotrych River and that a tunnel leads to the Khotyn Fortress from Kamianets-Podilskyi Castle. The events of the 1672 Ottoman siege were depicted in the 1888 historical novel Fire in the Steppe, written by Polish Nobel Prize laureate Henryk Sienkiewicz. The castle has appeared on a commemorative coin of the \\"Ancient fortresses on the river Dniester\\" series issued by the Transnistrian Republican Bank of Transnistria, a breakaway, internationally unrecognised republic within Moldova.

Eukaryotic algae and cyanobacteria generate energy and reduce carbon dioxide, providing organic substrates and oxygen. The photosynthetic activity fuels processes and conversions in the total biofilm community, including the heterotrophic fraction. Thick laminated multilayered phototrophic biofilms are usually referred to as microbial mats or phototrophic mats (see also biofilm). Phototrophic biofilms and microbial mats have been described in extreme environments like thermal springs, hyper saline ponds, desert soil crusts, and in lake ice covers in Antarctica. The 3.4-billion-year fossil record of benthic phototrophic communities, such as microbial mats and stromatolites, indicates that these associations represent the Earth's oldest known ecosystems. It is thought that these early ecosystems played a key role in the build-up of oxygen in the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere.

The United States supports Hong Kong's autonomy by concluding and implementing bilateral agreements; promoting trade and investment; arranging high-level visits; broadening law enforcement cooperation; bolstering educational, academic, and cultural links; and supporting the large community of U.S. citizens and visitors. Hong Kong is an active member of the global coalition against terrorism, and has joined the Container Security Initiative and remains an important partner with regard to eliminating funding for terrorist networks and combating money laundering.

On May 20, 2013, Edward Snowden, a former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) employee, arrived in Hong Kong. He leaked classified information from the National Security Agency (NSA) in Hong Kong in early June.

The incidence had proven to be a rare diplomatic conflict between Hong Kong and the United States. The United States has extradition treaties with more than 100 countries, excluding People's Republic of China and Republic of China but including Hong Kong, due to Hong Kong's autonomy in developing relations with foreign nations in a broad range of appropriate fields. Snowden, however, had not been detained by Hong Kong as requested by the United States. Hong Kong authorities said that it was because the United States' extradition request had not fully complied with Hong Kong law, and there was no legal basis to prevent Snowden from leaving. On June 24, U.S. State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell said \\"we're just not buying that this was a technical decision by a Hong Kong immigration official. This was a deliberate choice by the government to release a fugitive despite a valid arrest warrant ... though the Privacy Act prohibits me from talking about Mr. Snowden's passport specifically, I can say that the Hong Kong authorities were well aware of our interest in Mr. Snowden and had plenty of time to prohibit his travel.\\"Daily Press Briefing United States Department of State June 24, 2013 Hong Kong protests. = 2019‚Äì20 Hong Kong protests = A series of protests against the Hong Kong government broke out on 15 March 2019, in response to the 2019 Hong Kong extradition bill. By 9 June, the protests became the subject of global attention as demonstrations grew more violent. The New York Times writes, ‚ÄúFueled by anger toward the police, as well as the slow erosion of civil liberties, the largely leaderless protests morphed into a broader, more complicated movement about protecting freedoms, democracy and Hong Kong‚Äôs autonomy. The list of protesters‚Äô demands has grown to include amnesty for arrested participants and direct elections for all lawmakers and the chief executive.‚Äù The bill has since been eradicated, but protests continue. In August 2019, foreign ministry spokeswoman of China Hua Chunying said: \\"As you all know, they are somehow the work of the US\\" and that China would \\"never allow any foreign forces\\" to interfere in Hong-Kong, and warned that \\"those who play (with) fire will only get themselves burned.\\" So far this has been the most direct accusation Beijing has made against the US. However when president Trump commented on the ongoing protests in a Global Times interview he said: \\"At some point they are going to want to stop the riots. But that's between Hong Kong and that's between China, because Hong Kong is a part of China.\\" Joseph Cheng, a retired political science professor who is involved in Hong Kong‚Äôs pro-democracy movement commented on president Trump's comment, he said: \\"It appears to the Hong Kong people that the Hong Kong issue is not an important issue in the agenda of the president.‚Äù, as reported by Bloomberg. In early September 2019, Hong-Kong protesters were waving \\"tens of thousands\\" of US-flags on a march to the US Consulate in Hong Kong asking for help from the Trump administration to help end the confrontations with the Hong Kong government, as reported by CNN. In November 2019, United States President Donald Trump signed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which banned the sale of crowd-control munitions like tear gas and rubber bullets to the Hong Kong police. This harmed the United States‚Äô relations with the Hong Kong Government, although both bills have seen strongly positive reactions among the Hong Kong protestors. The South China Morning Post writes, \\"The Human Rights and Democracy Act is an extension of the Hong Kong Policy Act, the basis of the US approach since 1992. The US believes human rights are universal, and has a long-standing policy that China should honor its agreements on Hong Kong\\" and that \\"It is the United States‚Äô long-standing policy that China honor its commitments to protect those rights, as outlined in the Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1984, an international treaty filed with the United Nations.\\" = Revocation of special exemptions = On 28 May 2020, China's National People's Congress approved the controversial national security laws for Hong Kong, which aim at cracking down protests and ban \\"any acts or activities\\" that the communist government considers to endanger China's national security. The critics have called this new legislation a \\"killer blow\\" to Hong Kong's autonomy and freedoms. The legislation allows the government's national security agencies to operate in Hong Kong. On 29 May 2020, United States president Donald Trump ordered to remove the exemptions that give Hong Kong special status in America due to the PRC's new national security law for the territory. Trump announced that the extradition treaty between Hong Kong and the United States will be affected, the United States travel guidance for this territory will be changed, and the officials who undermined Hong Kong's freedoms will be sanctioned. The Hong Kong Autonomy Act, which imposes sanctions on officials and entities that help violate Hong Kong's autonomy, was signed into law by President Trump on 14 July 2020, following the enactment of the Hong Kong national security law in June 2020. On 19 August 2020, United States president Donald Trump ordered to suspended or terminated three bilateral agreements with Hong Kong. These agreements cover the surrender of fugitives, transfer and convicted prisoners as well as reciprocal tax exemptions on income from international shipping.

According to the 2012 U.S. Global Leadership Report, 38% of Hungarians approve of U.S. leadership, with 20% disapproving and 42% uncertain, a decrease from 53% approval in 2011.U.S. Global Leadership Project Report - 2012 Gallup. According to a 2018 poll, 68% of Hungarians view the United States favorably.  History  US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo meets with Hungarian Foreign Minister P√©ter Szijj√°rt√≥ in Budapest in February 2019 Until 1867 the Kingdom of Hungary was a part of the Austrian Empire and from 1867 to 1918 of the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary. United States diplomatic relations with Hungary were conducted through the United States Ambassador to Austria in Vienna. After the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire following World War I, Hungary and the United States established bilateral relations through a legation in Budapest established in 1921. The first American ambassador to Hungary (Theodore Brentano) was appointed on February 10, 1922. Diplomatic relations were interrupted at the outbreak of World War II. Hungary severed relations with the U.S. on December 11, 1941, when the United States declared war on Germany. Two days later, on December 13, Hungary declared war on the United States. The embassy was closed and diplomatic personnel returned to the U.S. Normal bilateral relations between Hungary and the U.S. were resumed in December 1945 when a U.S. ambassador was appointed and the embassy was reopened. Relations between the United States and Hungary following World War II were affected by the Soviet armed forces' occupation of Hungary. Full diplomatic relations were established at the legation level on October 12, 1945, before the signing of the Hungarian peace treaty on February 10, 1947. After the communist takeover in 1947‚Äì48, relations with the People's Republic of Hungary became increasingly strained by the nationalization of U.S.-owned property and what the United States considered unacceptable treatment of U.S. citizens and personnel, as well as restrictions on the operations of the American legation. Though relations deteriorated further after the suppression of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, an exchange of ambassadors in 1966 inaugurated an era of improving relations. In 1972, a consular convention was concluded to provide consular protection to U.S. citizens in Hungary. In 1973, a bilateral agreement was reached under which Hungary settled the nationalization claims of American citizens. On 6 January 1978, the United States returned the Holy Crown of Hungary, which had been safeguarded by the United States since the end of World War II. Symbolically and actually, this event marked the beginning of excellent relations between the two countries. A 1978 bilateral trade agreement included extension of most-favored-nation status to Hungary. Cultural and scientific exchanges were expanded. As Hungary began to pull away from the Soviet orbit, the United States offered assistance and expertise to help establish a constitution, a democratic political system, and a plan for a free market economy. Between 1989 and 1993, the Support for East European Democracy (SEED) Act provided more than $136 million for economic restructuring and private-sector development. The Hungarian-American Enterprise Fund has offered loans, equity capital, and technical assistance to promote private-sector development. The U.S. Government has provided expert and financial assistance for the development of modern and Western institutions in many policy areas, including national security, law enforcement, free media, environmental regulations, education, and health care. American direct investment has had a direct, positive impact on the Hungarian economy and on continued good bilateral relations. When Hungary acceded to NATO in April 1999, it became a formal ally of the United States. This move has been consistently supported by the 1.5 million-strong Hungarian-American community. The U.S. government supported Hungarian accession to the European Union in 2004, and continues to work with Hungary as a valued partner in the Transatlantic relationship.

Located between Reno and Carson City, it is named for the Washoe people, Native Americans who lived there before the arrival of Europeans. Slide Mountain and Mount Rose overlook the valley from the west. New Washoe City and Washoe Lake are located in the valley. The census-designated place of Washoe Valley, Nevada, corresponds closely to the area covered by New Washoe City and as of the 2010 Census had a population of 3,019. The valley's ZIP codes are 89701 and 89704, which are often associated with Carson City. History From 1857 to 1957, Theodore Winters (1823‚Äì1906) and his daughter, Neva Winters Sauer, owned and operated a cattle farm and Thoroughbred stud with a quarter-mile training track. Among the ranch's famous horses was El Rio Rey, the American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt of 1889. The Winters Ranch and Bowers Mansion in the valley are today listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Winters, California, is named in honor of Theodore Winters. =Washoe Zephyr= The Washoe Valley, along with much of the region in the lee of the Sierra Nevada mountains, is known for its occasionally strong winds. These sometimes require the closing of U.S. 395, the principal north-south highway, to high profile vehicles. One of these, known as the Washoe Zephyr, occurs during the summer, sometimes daily. Describing the Washoe Zephyr as it occurred while he was in Carson City, Mark Twain wrote: :: \\"A Washoe wind is by no means a trifling matter. It blows flimsy houses down, lifts shingle roofs occasionally, rolls up tin ones like sheet music, now and then blows a stage-coach over and spills the passengers; and tradition says the reason there are so many bald people there is, that the wind blows the hair off their heads while they are looking skyward after their hats.\\" Transportation The valley is a main thoroughfare in northern Nevada, with Interstate 580/US 395 and US 395 Alt passing along the base of the Sierra Nevada at the western edge of the valley, connecting Reno and Carson City. The Virginia & Truckee Railroad used to pass through this transportation corridor from 1872 to 1950, with the grade highly visible through the middle of the valley, and many bridges across the creeks near Pagni Canyon were still there (as pictured above) until the Washoe Drive Fire occurred and swept through the canyon. There are also small bridges whose framework is still there farther south along the route.

Both Iceland and the U.S. are NATO allies. Overview The United States has maintained an interest in Iceland since the mid-1800s. In 1868, U.S. Department of State under William H. Seward authored a report that contemplated the purchase of Iceland from Denmark. The United States military established a presence in Iceland and around its waters after the Nazi occupation of Denmark (even before the U.S. entered World War II) in order to deny Nazi Germany access to its strategically important location (which would have been considered a threat to the Western Hemisphere). The United States was the first country to recognize Icelandic independence from Denmark in June 1944, union with Denmark under a common king, and German and British occupation during World War II. Iceland is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) but has no standing military of its own. The United States and Iceland signed a bilateral defense agreement in 1951, which stipulated that the U.S. would make arrangements for Iceland's defense on behalf of NATO and provided for basing rights for U.S. forces in Iceland; the agreement remains in force, although U.S. military forces are no longer permanently stationed in Iceland. In 2006, the U.S. announced it would continue to provide for Iceland's defense but without permanently basing forces in the country. That year, Naval Air Station Keflavik closed and the two countries signed a technical agreement on base closure issues (e.g., facilities return, environmental cleanup, residual value) and a \\"joint understanding\\" on future bilateral security cooperation (focusing on defending Iceland and the North Atlantic region against emerging threats such as terrorism and trafficking). The United States also worked with local officials to mitigate the impact of job losses at the Air Station, notably by encouraging U.S. investment in industry and tourism development in the Keflavik area. Cooperative activities in the context of the new agreements have included joint search and rescue, disaster surveillance, and maritime interdiction training with U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard units; and U.S. deployments to support the NATO air surveillance mission in Iceland. The U.S.‚ÄìIcelandic relationship is founded on cooperation and mutual support. The two countries share a commitment to individual freedom, human rights, and democracy. U.S. policy aims to maintain close, cooperative relations with Iceland, both as a NATO ally interested in the shared objectives of enhancing world peace; respect for human rights; economic development; arms control; and law enforcement cooperation, including the fight against terrorism, narcotics, and human trafficking. The United States and Iceland work together on a wide range of issues from enhancing peace and stability in Afghanistan (Iceland is part of the ISAF coalition), to harnessing new green energy sources, to ensuring peaceful cooperation in the Arctic. According to the 2012 U.S. Global Leadership Report, 17% of Icelanders approve of U.S. leadership, with 25% disapproving and 58% uncertain.U.S. Global Leadership Project Report - 2012 Gallup Economic relations Both countries are part of the United Nations. Not only that, but the United States seeks to strengthen bilateral economic and trade relations. Most of Iceland's exports go to the European Union and the European Free Trade Association countries, followed by the United States and Japan. The U.S. is one of the largest foreign investors in Iceland, primarily in the aluminum sector. The United States and Iceland signed a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement in 2008. Iceland's membership in international organizations Iceland, like the U.S., never joined the League of Nations. Iceland's ties with other Nordic states, the United States, and other NATO member states are particularly close. Iceland and the United States belong to a number of the same international organizations, including the United Nations, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, Arctic Council, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and World Trade Organization. Diplomatic visits Only two U.S. presidents have visited Iceland whilst in office: Richard Nixon in 31 May-1 June 1973 and Ronald Reagan in 9‚Äì12 October 1986. President Richard Nixon was the first U.S. president to visit Iceland when he visited on 31 May - 1 June 1973. Reagan attended the Reykjav√≠k Summit in 9‚Äì12 October 1986 with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. It was a highly dramatic moment in the Cold War as the two leaders almost came to an agreement to abolish all nuclear weapons. They just missed, but the ice was broken and there were soon major new initiatives that led to the end of the Cold War. Numerous other U.S. dignitaries have visited Iceland. First Lady Hillary Clinton spoke at a conference on Women and Democracy in Reykjavik in October 1999. She returned to Iceland as a U.S. senator in August 2004 on a fact- finding trip that also included her husband, former President Bill Clinton, and Senator John McCain. Secretary of State Colin Powell attended a NATO summit in Iceland in May 2002, and his successor, Condoleezza Rice, visited the country in May 2008. The U.S. maintains an embassy in Reykjavik, Iceland. Icelandic diplomats have also visited the United States on several occasions. Icelandic President √ìlafur Ragnar Gr√≠msson attended a technology summit hosted by Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin in October 2007. He also met with Maine Gov. Paul LePage at an international trade summit in Portland, Maine in May 2013. On May 13, 2016, President Barack Obama hosted a summit and state dinner for Nordic leaders from Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Finland. Among the attendees from the Icelandic delegation were Prime Minister Sigur√∞ur Ingi J√≥hannsson and the Icelandic Ambassador to the U.S., former Prime Minister Geir Haarde.

Designed by J. W. Dunne and built by Short Brothers at Leysdown, A tailless swept-wing biplane, the D.5 was the first aircraft built by his company, the Blair Atholl Aeroplane Syndicate Ltd. Like its military predecessors it was driven by twin pusher propellers, but it had a considerably more powerful engine. The D.5 first flew in the summer of 1910, Dunne having long ago literally dreamed of this flight. The D.5 was later certified as the first fixed-wing aircraft ever to achieve stability in flight, one of the official witnesses being Orville Wright. Development On leaving the Army Balloon Factory at Farnborough in 1909, J. W. Dunne set up a company, the Blair Atholl Aeroplane Syndicate Ltd., to continue developing his aircraft, none of which had yet flown under power. The D.5 was their first aircraft and it followed the basic design of the earlier D.1B and D.4 Army machines in having a tailless, swept biplane wing with pronounced wash-out. Like the others it was also driven by twin pusher propellers. However it differed in having a streamlined central nacelle or fuselage housing the pilot and engine, and the engine itself was a more powerful Green four-cylinder inline type. The controls were also unusual. Elevons at the wing tips provided all the control forces and were operated by two levers on either side of the cockpit. There was no rudder, with turning being coordinated by the aerodynamic design of the swept and washed-out wings. Endplate fins were fitted to the wings, to improve efficiency. Construction of the main airframe was contracted to Short Brothers. Operational history Following construction at Leysdown, the D.5 was taken to Eastchurch, the new site of the (now Royal) Aero Club and the Syndicate. Early trials were not encouraging, with the machine in its original form proving too heavy. The D.5 first flew, piloted by Dunne himself, in the summer of 1910. Dunne taxied to the top of a rise in the ground which lay downwind, turned the machine and took off downhill and into the wind. Dunne later recalled in his book An Experiment with Time that, as a child, he had experienced exactly this flight in a dream.Constance Babington Smith; Testing Time, Pages 11-17. The D.5 proved to be aerodynamically stable in flight. Two demonstration flights were made for the Royal Aero Club in December 1910, officially witnessed by the visiting Orville Wright and by Griffith Brewer. During the second flight, Dunne took his hands off the controls for an extended period, while he wrote a note on a piece of paper provided for him by Brewer. This note was the first ever documentary evidence of an aircraft's performance written in flight by the pilot himself. The D.5 was subsequently certified as the first fixed-wing aircraft ever to achieve stable flight.

Gordon (August 10, 1915 ‚Äì February 16, 1969) was a Chicago businessman, inventor, and social theorist. Gordon also was a futurist and an advocate for privacy rights, a cause that he advocated through his writings and public speaking during the 1960s. Gordon built several profitable businesses during the years of the Great Depression. He also designed and created a safety lever device for hydraulic machine presses to improve worker safety. This was first put to use in his primary manufacturing facility. Then, during the 1930s and thereafter, mechanical production engineers copied and put Gordon's development to use in factories throughout the Midwest. As an industrialist during the 1940s and 1950s, Gordon adopted various public service social policies that benefited the families of workers. During the relatively low- tech era of telephone party lines, Gordon predicted the advent of such modern day telecommunication advances as hand held, personal phones that would bounce their signals off of satellites. Gordon also was an astute evaluator of commercial value within the communication industry. He accumulated a large investment portfolio by the time that he quit the business world due to a heart attack at 46. Gordon died at 54.  Childhood and early years  Gordon was born on a tenant farm in Gary, Indiana, in 1915. He lived there as a young boy until his family moved to Chicago. There, his parents opened a grocery store on Archer Avenue, located south of Cicero. In Chicago, besides the grocery store, Gordon's father, Victor, went into partnership with a W.O. Sommers to develop and grow a food-processing and distribution business, the W.O. Sommers Company. In Europe, the partners purchased harvests of cherries, olives and other bulk food items, which they bottled or canned under many labels, including the Monarch brand, and then sold to grocers, including numerous Jewell T Food Stores outlets throughout the Chicago area. Admitted to the University of Chicago at 16, he began honing his entrepreneurial skills during the depression years and went on to study law at night at the Chicago- Kent College of Law, now the law school of the Illinois Institute of Technology.  In business  Gordon graduated from law school at 19, too young to be permitted to take the bar examination to become a lawyer. Instead, he and a high school friend, M.J. Levine, went to work as salespersons for a sugar supply company. (At 21, the minimum legal age, Gordon successfully took the bar exam and became a member of the Illinois Bar.) Gordon and his friend later acquired the profitable sugar company where they had begun their commercial careers. The sugar company purchased bulk sugar from Caribbean plantations and sold it to Chicago grocers by the truckload before and during World War II. Spurred on by the travails of the Depression, Gordon and his partner pledged to share the proceeds of their annual incomes on a 50‚Äì50 basis, as well as any profits from their various business enterprises. Both men honored this unusual agreement. In the 1930s Gordon went into business for himself, starting up the United Packing & Gasket Company. His factory, located in Cicero, originally was a government confiscated Al Capone distillery during the Volstead Act years. Gordon's company manufactured gaskets and other components for the automotive industry. During World War II Gordon refitted his operation to produce replacement parts for U.S. military vehicles and speaker rings for battlefield radios. In the post sputnik period, Gordon manufactured specially designed absorbent parts used for the US government's rocket program. While Gordon was expanding his gasket company, he helped grow the Gordon family food processing operation and his other investment interests to purchase a paper mill in Hannibal, Missouri, the boyhood home of author Mark Twain and the locale for his two most famous novels, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. Gordon used the paper products manufactured at this Missouri plant in the production of gaskets and related items at his Illinois factory. At the same time that Gordon was expanding his gasket and paper manufacturing operations, he also retained ownership rights in the W.O. Sommers food processing company as well as his future interest in the sugar supply company which his partner maintained. When Victor Gordon died, his rights to the well-established W.O. Sommers Company passed on to his three children, including M.G. Gordon. Gordon's abiding concern for the welfare of his workers led the industrialist to conceive of a pay benefit that he made available to his employees and their families. Many of Gordon's workers would socialize at a local tavern after work on payday Fridays, and then proceed to a nearby racetrack after drinks. There, some of the workers would gamble and occasionally lose their entire paychecks. To mitigate this problem, Gordon instituted a singular social exchange in which the spouses of his workers could come to the plant early on Fridays and get 50 percent advances on the weekly salaries of their mates. This policy ensured that the families of workers who gambled would still have money for bills and expenses. As a result of his progressive worker friendly policies, Gordon's workers never unionized or struck his plants during his lifetime.  Inventions  When Gordon started up his gasket operations, hydraulic machine presses were extremely dangerous. Workers sometimes lost hands or arms in this bone-crunching equipment. Gordon therefore redesigned the two-story-tall machine presses at his plant so they would not function unless a worker pushed a button with one hand while activating a newly installed lever with another, thus tying up both hands and arms at the same time. This safety feature prevented workers from inadvertently placing an idle hand or arm inside the presses when they were in operation. Gordon's adaptation of his machine presses eventually became known in the industrial Midwest. Detroitauto manufacturers sent a team of engineers to Gordon's plant to inspect his retrofitted machine presses on a first-hand basis. Later, they adapted Gordon's design at their own plants. Operating from a concern for worker safety, Gordon was content to let the potentially lucrative patent rights to his safety lever design pass into the public domain. During World War II, the U.S. government rationed many vital commodities. Gordon's plant required large quantities of cork, a controlled item, and a necessary raw material for the gaskets that were manufactured there for the domestic market. To solve this raw materials shortage Gordon developed a process to create synthetic cork from crushed peanut shells. Like his machine press improvement, Gordon allowed his patentable rights for this process to vest in the public domain.  Investments  Gordon purchased stock in small to mid-size telephone companies and exchanges throughout the Midwest during the 1930s, 40s, and 50s. Eventually, these companies were consolidated into AT&T;'s or Continental Telephone's massive operations. This increased the value of Gordon's holdings. During his retirement years, revenues from Gordon's investment portfolio in the burgeoning telecommunication industry surpassed revenues from his business interests during his working career. The portfolio's value, managed by various trusts for the benefit of his wife Goldye Gordon and their five children increased since his death.  The telephone  Beginning when he was a young man and throughout his life, Gordon was fascinated with the telephone. He saw it as more than a mere communication device, believing that the telephone had the capability to truly level society. For Gordon, an outspoken advocate for social equality, the telephone made all people equal, at least during the virtual experience when they were in communication with one another. over the phone lines, according to Gordon, such issues that stratify society as race, social status, and ethnicity become moot. Instead, he believed that the telephone, more than any other technical development, had the capability to bring people together as equals, no matter who they might be. Gordon envisioned the quickly expanding telephone network as the ideal social network. His prescient 1950s-'60s theorizing regarding the telephone anticipated such popular modern-day Internet social networks as Facebook and MySpace. Gordon developed a social/psychological theory that, thanks to the telephone, people can feel free to exhibit two personalities ‚Äì one for everyday life conversation and another goal directed personality for business and professional exchange. Indeed, because the customary cues that differentiate individuals have little or no relevance during telephone conversations, people can feel free to adopt various enhanced personas over the phone that would be psychologically impossible for them to assume during face-to-face conversations. \\"On the phone, you are able to become the very best person that you can possibly be,\\" Gordon said. During his retirement, Gordon conducted pro bono discussion groups of these ideas with students at the University of Wisconsin, the University of Oklahoma and Baylor University. Until his death, Gordon followed up with participating students to assess their progress in implementing these ideas with annual telephone calls. Gordon's early prognostications regarding assumed personalities in virtual environments have relevance in today's highly wired world. Many people now routinely adopt enhanced personalities during email, internet chat sessions, text messaging, and related electronic communication venues that reflect their ideal selves. During the 1950s, Gordon anticipated the modern era of cell phones. He believed that people would eventually possess their own wireless, handheld telephonic devices; and that such equipment would communicate back and forth via satellite transmissions. Of course, Gordon's prescient views regarding telephony are now a commercial reality. Although one idea that he had, which was that people at birth would be assigned their own individual phone numbers for life, is no closer to becoming reality now than when Gordon first proposed it in the 1950s. Before he died, Gordon was writing a book, to be entitled Success at Arm's Reach.  Privacy rights  After a heart attack at 46, Gordon recuperated at his residence in Highland Park, Illinois. Highland Park, with its tree lined streets nestled on Lake Michigan, was an excellent venue for him to contemplate his future. Highland Park hosts the tranquil Ravinia Park music festival which is the oldest in North America. The city was and continues to be a retreat for public luminaries who value personal privacy such as Chicago Bears Hall of Fame Quarterback Sid Luckman and Chicago Bulls basketball star Michael Jordan. The first telephone call Gordon received during his Highland Park convalescence was from someone attempting to sell cemetery plots. This energized him to quickly take up the cause of privacy rights. Gordon began to think about the issue of privacy in the broader context of civil rights. For Gordon, unsolicited calls from sales and similar organizations, trying to peddle their products, services and (sometimes crackpot) causes over the phone, represented a rank invasion of privacy. Additionally, Gordon believed that the instantaneous accessibility the phone made possible represented a dangerous potential that a foreign government or any unscrupulous commercial entity, could easily abuse. (of course, Gordon's heightened privacy concerns during the 1960s parallel the level of umbrage ‚Äì indeed, even outrage ‚Äì that exists today regarding the annoying automated telephone calls and E-mail spam that people must endure.) Gordon began to write about this topic. one of his articles, entitled \\"Invasion of Privacy: The Unsolicited Telephone Call,\\" was published in the International Journal of Law and Science. Gordon also became an active public speaker on the topic of privacy rights. One presentation he made on this topic was before a meeting of the International Academy of Law and Science. Gordon worked to disseminate his views on privacy rights in other ways. This included interviews on American and Canadian radio stations. In addition to privacy rights, Gordon also advocated civil and political rights. During the 1960s, he tried to help an oppressed family flee Communist Czechoslovakia. At the time Czechoslovakia was a brutal police state that did not permit normal immigration. Gordon's assistance involved communicating in code with the Czech family through the pre-arranged placement of different-imaged postage stamps on airmail letters. Unfortunately, despite Gordon's concerted efforts, the Czech family was unable to escape from the Iron Curtain country.  Professional honors  Gordon was a Fellow in the American Judicature Society and in the International Academy of Law and Science.  Personal  M.G and Goldye Gordon had five children: Sandy, Judy, Barbara, Robert, and Alan.

Born in Calabria in a locality described as being the \\"closest to Sicily\\", Fantinus was introduced as a child to Saint Elias the Cave-Dweller.Orthodox Europe :: Italy Fantinus' parents were named George and Vriena. Fantinus' spiritual education was entrusted to Elias, and Fantinus became a monk at the age of thirteen and worked as a cook and afterwards as a porter. At the age of thirty-three, he became a hermit in the region of Mount Mercurion in the north of Calabria. There, many monasteries and hermitages had been established under the Basilian rule. Fantinus lived a life of extreme asceticism, eating only raw vegetables, and occupying his time copying manuscripts. He also experienced a vision of heaven and hell. Fantinus lived both as a hermit and as a monk and abbot. He subsequently convinced his aged parents, as well as his two brothers, Luke and Cosmas, and sister Caterina, to enter the monastic life. When he became a hermit, he left his brother Lucas in charge of the monastery for men he had founded. Though a hermit, he often returned from the wild in order to serve as a guide and spiritual teacher to disciples, such as Nilus the Younger and Nicodemus of Mammola. Greece The monastery he founded was destroyed by Muslim raiders during Fantinus' lifetime. But Fantinus was told by an angel to preach in Greece. He left Calabria with two disciples, Vitalis and Nicephorus. During the voyage, the ship ran out of drinking water. Fantinus is said to have made the sign of the cross over a container filled with seawater and miraculously converted it into drinkable water. Fantinus visited Corinth, Athens, and Larissa, where he lived near the sepulcher of Saint Achillius of Larissa. He lived for four months in a monastery dedicated to Saint Menas near Thessalonica, and then lived outside of the city walls of that city. In Thessalonica itself, he cured the sick and caused a corrupt judge to repent of his sins. He was also given credit for preventing a Bulgarian capture of the city. Fantinus died in Greece.

Relations between the two are generally strong and close. Both are democracies, and each nation reciprocally recognizes the strategic importance of their counterpart.

In 1831, the natives living in the village of Kuala Batee (located on the island of Sumatra, then part of the Dutch East Indies) massacred the crew of a U.S. merchant ship. This led to the punitive First Sumatran Expedition, a during which U.S. and Dutch troops raided the settlement. The U.S. navy returned to Sumatra during the Second Sumatran Expedition, launched in response to an attack on another U.S. merchant ship by Malay pirates. =1949‚Äì1975= Much to the annoyance of the Dutch, the United States played a major role in the demanding Indonesian independence in the late 1940s. The Cold War played a critical role as the Indonesian Republic conclusively demonstrated its willingness and ability to suppress internal communist threats, as directed by the Comintern. U.S. policy since the 1940s has been to support Indonesia and help it avoid communism and was the primary provider of armaments. After Japan, Indonesia was the largest pro-U.S. nation in Asia. It hosted American investments in petroleum and raw materials and controlled a highly strategic location near vital shipping lanes.Marc Frey, \\"Decolonization and Dutch-American Relations,\\" in Krabebbendam, ed., Four Centuries of Dutch-American Relations (2009) pp 609-20. The Dutch attempted to regain control of Indonesia after the surrender of Japan. However, under the Japanese occupation, the nationalist new government had arisen that resisted the Netherlands, leading to a four-year armed and diplomatic conflict. The U.S. took the lead in the United Nations demanding a Dutch withdrawal and Washington threatened to cut off Marshall plan aid. Indonesia gained full independence from the Netherlands in 1949. Indonesia nationalized more than a thousand Dutch companies, and nine out of 10 of the Dutch residents returned to the Netherlands, along with thousands of pro-Dutch Indonesians. Although considered a triumph of nationalism, it resulted in a prolonged economic depression due to the country's lack of capital and managerial skills.M. C. Ricklefs, A History of Modern Indonesia since c. 1200 (3rd ed. 2001) pp 261‚Äì90. Indonesia helped sponsor the Non-Aligned Movement along with India and Yugoslavia to assert its independence from both the U.S. and the Soviet Union. When Indonesia started selling rubber to Communist China in the mid-1950s, the Eisenhower administration protested and persuaded Jakarta to cease the sales, allowing friendly relations to resume.Soo Chun Lu, \\"'Trade with the Devil': Rubber, Cold War Embargo, and US‚ÄìIndonesian Relations, 1951‚Äì1956.\\" Diplomacy and Statecraft 19.1 (2008): 42‚Äì68.Richard Mason, \\"The United States, the Cold War and Indonesia-People's Republic of China Relations, 1950‚Äì1955.\\" KEMANUSIAAN: The Asian Journal of Humanities 23.1 (2016) Online. The U.S. under President John F. Kennedy intervened in the West New Guinea dispute between Indonesia and the Netherlands, due to Indonesia's purchase of Soviet arms and planned invasion of the territory. U.S. diplomat Ellsworth Bunker brokered the New York Agreement, which eventually ceded West New Guinea to Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum.David Webster, \\"Regimes in Motion: The Kennedy Administration and Indonesia's New Frontier, 1960‚Äì1962.\\" Diplomatic History 33.1 (2009): 95‚Äì123. The administration of Lyndon B. Johnson escalated the war in Vietnam, which greatly heightened tensions with Indonesia in 1964‚Äì65. Relations deteriorated further with Indonesia's opposition to the formation of Malaysia that led to war. By mid-1965, Sukarno was edging closer to China, denounced U.S imperialism, and inspired anti- American demonstrations. Following an attempted coup on September 30, 1965, and the ensuing massacres of communists, the pro-Western Suharto came to power in 1968, and the U.S. started providing financial and military aid to Indonesia.Matthew Jones, \\"US relations with Indonesia, the Kennedy-Johnson transition, and the Vietnam connection, 1963‚Äì1965.\\" Diplomatic History 26.2 (2002): 249‚Äì281. onlineH.

Anti-Fretilin activists from the other main parties fled to West Timor, a part of Indonesia, and called upon Jakarta to annex the former Portuguese colony. On December 6, 1975, Ford and Kissinger met Indonesian President Suharto in Jakarta and indicated the U.S. would not take a position on East Timor. Indonesia invaded the next day and made East Timor its 27th province. The United Nations, with U.S. support, called for the withdrawal of the Indonesian forces. The 25-year Indonesian occupation of East Timor was characterized by continuous and violent clashes between separatist groups (especially Fretilin) and the Indonesian military. It was not until 1999 that Indonesia relinquished control of East Timor following an Australian-led international intervention. East Timor later became an independent country in 2002.Benedict R.

Recent research into newly opened documents indicates that anti-Communism was not the main reason for Western support of Indonesia's takeover of East Timor. Analysts in Washington and NATO concluded that East Timor was too small and too unstable to survive on its own. Furthermore, there was a clear need to maintain friendly relations with Indonesia due to its growing size and importance in a critical region.Brad Simpson, \\"‚ÄòIllegally and Beautifully‚Äô: The United States, the Indonesian Invasion of East Timor and the International Community, 1974‚Äì76.\\" Cold War History 5.3 (2005): 281‚Äì315. Following the invasion, U.S. military aid averaged about $30 million annually throughout the occupation of East Timor, and arms sales increased exponentially under President Jimmy Carter. This policy continued until 1999 when President Bill Clinton was outraged by Indonesia's defiance of East Timor referendum results that heavily favored independence. =Since 2000= With the end of the Cold War in 1989 and the resolution of the East Timor crisis in 2000, relations between Indonesia and the U.S. have been untroubled. By 2000, relations reached an all-time high. Rapprochement was made successful by Indonesia's transition to democracy with free elections, and its effective counter-terrorism strategies. The George W. Bush administration claimed a part of the credit by arguing that the Bush doctrine advocated democracy as an antidote to terrorism, and Indonesia's experience vindicated the doctrine. The Barack Obama administration celebrates shared democratic values and interests and recognizes Indonesia's increasingly influential role in world affairs. Efforts by 2010 were underway for the two countries to create a 'Comprehensive Partnership Agreement' (CPA) encompassing enhanced security, economic and educational engagement, as well as cooperation on transnational issues such as climate change.Ann Marie Murphy, \\"US rapprochement with Indonesia: from problem state to partner.\\" Contemporary Southeast Asia (2010): 362‚Äì387. onlineMeidyatama Suryodiningrat, \\"US rapprochement with Indonesia: From problem state to partner‚ÄîA response.\\" Contemporary Southeast Asia 32.3 (2010): 388‚Äì394. excerpt Recent relations U.S. and Indonesian presidents Barack Obama and Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono participate in the arrival ceremony at the Merdeka Palace in Jakarta, Indonesia (November 9, 2010). Chairman of The Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Dunford Jr. with Commander of the Indonesian National Armed Forces Air Chief Marshall Hadi Tjahjanto at The Pentagon during the state visit of the TNI Commander to the United States in 2018. The United States has significant economic, commercial, and security interests in Indonesia. It remains a linchpin of regional security due to its strategic location astride several vital international maritime straits, particularly the Malacca Strait. Relations between Indonesia and the U.S. are generally positive and have advanced since the election of President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono in 2004. Cooperative relations are maintained today, although no formal security treaties bind the two countries. The U.S. and Indonesia share the common goal of maintaining peace, security, and stability in the region and engaging in a dialogue on threats to regional security. Cooperation between the U.S. and Indonesia on counter-terrorism has increased steadily since 2002, as terrorist attacks in Bali (October 2002 and October 2005), Jakarta (August 2003 and September 2004) and other regional locations demonstrated the presence of terrorist organizations, principally Jemaah Islamiyah, in Indonesia. The U.S. has welcomed Indonesia's contributions to regional security, especially its leading role in helping restore democracy in Cambodia and in mediating territorial disputes in the South China Sea. The U.S. is committed to consolidating Indonesia's democratic transition and supports the territorial integrity of the country. Nonetheless, there are friction points in the bilateral relations. These conflicts have centered primarily on human rights, as well as on differences in foreign policy. The U.S. Congress cut off grant military training assistance through International Military Education and Training (IMET) to Indonesia in 1992 in response to a November 12, 1991, incident in East Timor when Indonesian security forces shot and killed East Timorese demonstrators. This restriction was partially lifted in 1995. Military assistance programs were again suspended, however, in the aftermath of the violence and destruction in East Timor following the August 30, 1999 referendum favoring independence. Separately, the U.S. had urged the Indonesian government to identify and bring to justice the perpetrators of the August 2002 ambush murders of two U.S. teachers near Timika, Papua. In 2005, the Secretary of State certified that Indonesian cooperation in the murder investigation had met the conditions set by Congress, enabling the resumption of full IMET. Eight suspects were arrested in January 2006, and in November 2006 seven were convicted. In November 2005, the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, under authority delegated by the Secretary of State, exercised a National Security Waiver provision provided in the FY 2005 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act to remove congressional restrictions on Foreign Military Financing (FMF) and lethal defense articles. These actions represented a reestablishment of normalized military relations, allowing the U.S. to provide more substantial support for Indonesian efforts to reform the military, increase its ability to respond to national and regional disasters, and promote regional stability. =Workers rights= Regarding worker rights, Indonesia was the target of several petitions filed under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) legislation arguing that Indonesia did not meet internationally recognized labor standards. A formal GSP review was suspended in February 1994 without terminating GSP benefits for Indonesia. Since 1998, Indonesia has ratified all eight International Labor Organization core conventions on protecting internationally recognized worker rights and allowed trade unions to organize. However, enforcement of labor laws and protection of workers rights remains inconsistent and weak in some areas. Indonesia's slow economic recovery has pushed more workers into the informal sector, which reduces legal protection and could create conditions for increases in child labor. Development assistances U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia Paul Wolfowitz and USAID Mission Director David Merrill presented a plaque to Suardi Sumadiwangsa, the 10,000th Indonesian to participate in USAID's Overseas Training Program in 1987. 2009 Sumatera Earthquakes. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and its predecessors have provided development assistance to Indonesia since 1950. Initial assistance focused on the most urgent needs of the new republic, including food aid, infrastructure rehabilitation, health care, and training. For thirty years, between 1967 and 2007, U.S. aid to Indonesia was provided within the arrangements of, first, the Inter-Governmental Group on Indonesia, and later the Consultative Group on Indonesia. Through the 1970s, a time of enormous economic growth in Indonesia, USAID played a significant role in helping the country achieve self- sufficiency in rice production and in reducing the birth rate. Today, USAID assistance programs focus on primary education, democratic governance, rebuilding after the 2004 tsunami, economic growth, health, water, food, and the environment. ;Improving the quality of decentralized education In October 2003, President Bush announced a $157 million Indonesian Education Initiative for 2004‚Äì2009 to improve the quality of education in Indonesia. This initiative is a cornerstone of the U.S. Government assistance program in Indonesia, directly responding to Indonesia's priorities and reflecting a joint Indonesia-U.S. commitment to revitalize education for the next generation of Indonesia's leaders. ;Managing basic education (MBE) Since 2003, this project has worked with local governments to strengthen their capacity to effectively manage primary education services in 20 districts/municipalities in East and Central Java, Aceh, and Jakarta. MBE is also working with 10,000 educators to improve the quality of teaching and learning in grades 1‚Äì9 through in-service teacher training, community participation, and the promotion of school-based management. MBE directly reaches 450 schools, 20% of which are madrassah, and 140,000 students. Through dissemination of good practices, teachers from 2,000 additional schools received training last year. ;Decentralized basic education (DBE) The Indonesia Education Initiative will increase the quality of basic education in primary and junior secondary schools, both public and private, and focus on three results: (DBE1) Local governments and communities more effectively manage education services; (DBE2) Enhance the quality of teaching and learning to improve student performance in critical subjects such as math, science, and reading; and (DBE3) Youth gain more relevant life and work skills to better compete for jobs in the future. ;Opportunities for vulnerable children This program promotes inclusive education in Indonesia. Children with special needs, such as visual impairment are provided with the opportunity to be educated in public schools. Replicable models are being developed to expand the reach of the program. ;Sesame Street Indonesia A new Indonesian co-production of the award-winning television show targeting young children is being developed and produced by the Sesame Workshop in New York with local Indonesian partners and USAID funding. Millions of Indonesian children will be better equipped to start school. The first season is scheduled to air in mid-2007. ;Effective democracy and decentralized governance This objective aims to support democratic reforms by supporting effective and accountable local governance, addressing conflict and encouraging pluralism, and consolidating national-level democratic reforms. ;Mitigation of conflict and support for peace USAID remains a crucial donor working to mitigate conflict and support peace in conflict areas, such as Aceh, Papua, Sulawesi, and Ambon. Assistance activities focus on: conflict resolution/mitigation; civilian-military affairs; livelihoods development in conflict areas; drafting and monitoring of relevant legislation; and emergency and post-conflict transitional assistance to conflict-affected persons. ;Anti- trafficking in persons USAID's anti-trafficking programs work closely with the Ministry of Women's Empowerment and civil society groups in policymaking, program development, victim support, and dissemination of information which will contribute to reducing the trafficking of women and children in Indonesia. ;Justice sector reforms Through the Democratic Reform Support Program and Justice Sector Reform Program, USAID's current Justice Sector programs provide technical assistance and training to judges, prosecutors and staff members at the Supreme Court, the Constitutional Court, and the Attorney General's Office. ;Legislative strengthening Technical assistance and training are provided to strengthen the legislative and legal drafting skills of parliamentarians as well as provide institutional support to the National House of Representatives, National Regional Representative Council, nine provincial legislative councils and 40 district-level legislative councils. Activities include promoting constituency and media outreach; developing the capacity to draft and analyze legislation and operational budgets; creating inter-party coalitions; encouraging legislative commissions to carry out their functions and perform strategic planning. ;The local governance support program Currently assisting 60 local governments, this program works to increase governmental accountability and transparency, strengthen the local legislative process, promote citizen engagement and civil service reform, and improve the delivery of basic services. ;Media development In October 2005, USAID funded a new media development project entitled \\"Building on the Foundations: Strengthening Professional, Responsible and Responsive Broadcast Media in Indonesia.\\" The goal of the program is to build professional, information-based local media that are responsive to the development and reform of districts across Indonesia. The program assists local radio stations in North Sumatra, Aceh and Java, fostering dialogue on media regulations, and providing support for media and media education in Aceh. ;Tsunami Reconstruction The U.S. Government was one of the first donors to respond to the disaster and remains one of the most significant contributors to relief and reconstruction efforts in Indonesia. Through numerous grants to non- governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations, and United Nations agencies, USAID has helped stabilize the humanitarian situation in Aceh, avert a public health crisis, and provide relief services to survivors. ;Rebuilding shelter and key infrastructure USAID is assisting communities by providing much-needed shelter, working with the Indonesian government to rebuild vital infrastructure, and ensuring proper mapping and planning is considered through local cooperation. ;Restoring livelihoods USAID enables communities to direct capacity building to benefit people at the local level. USAID's Community Based Recovery Initiative is working with 59 villages to organize local capacity-building initiatives. ;Strengthening capacity and governance USAID is assisting in restoring local government services in Aceh, working to increase governmental accountability and transparency, strengthen the local legislative process, promote citizen engagement and civil service reform, and improve the delivery of basic services. ;Economic growth strengthened and employment created Assistance to the Indonesian government and private sector focuses on creating jobs by improving the business and investment climate, combating corruption, increasing competitiveness in key sectors, and improving the safety of the financial system. USAID is working with Indonesians to ensure that future generations enjoy an increasingly prosperous, democratic and stable country. ;Business climate and enterprise development Efforts to promote a transparent and predictable legal and regulatory business climate aim to reduce the hidden costs of doing business, to reduce uncertainty, and to promote trade, investment and job creation. USAID delivers technical assistance to leading industry sectors to fuel growth, exports, jobs, and prosperity. These efforts drive increased productivity and national competitiveness by forging stronger coalitions of public, private, and civil society advocates for legal, regulatory, and policy change. ;Financial sector safety and soundness USAID is working to improve the oversight of bank and non-bank financial intermediaries in order to promote safety and soundness in the financial system and to improve transparency and governance. ;Improving the quality of basic human services The USAID Basic Human Services Office assists Indonesia through an integrated strategy combining health, food/nutrition, and environmental management and water services at the district and community levels. ;Environmental services This program supports better health through improved water resources management and expanded access to clean water and sanitation services. With a ridge to reef approach, partners improve water resource management from watershed sources, along rivers, through cities, and to coastal reefs. In the upper watershed, the program promotes forest management, biodiversity conservation, and land use planning to protect a steady, year-round source of clean water. Further downstream, the program strengthens municipal water utilities to improve and expand piped water and sanitation services to communities. Stakeholder forums link upstream and downstream communities to build consensus on water and waste management issues. Marginalized urban communities also benefit from the introduction of safe drinking water through Air Rahmat, a home chlorination product being introduced to the market through a public-private partnership. ;Health services Women, newborns and children are the principal beneficiaries of this integrated public health program. Working with the government, NGOs, and other partners, USAID focuses on maternal, neonatal and child health; reproductive health; nutrition; HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria; and decentralization of the health sector. Improved health-seeking behaviors within communities link key hygiene promotion interventions, such as hand- washing with soap, in order to reduce diarrheal disease, a major cause of childhood death. New initiatives address challenges from the re-emergence of polio and the outbreak of avian influenza in Indonesia. ;Food and nutrition Improving the nutritional status of Indonesians, USAID food assistance targets impoverished communities. These activities directly impact women and children through targeted supplemental feeding and nutritional education activities. The food assistance program works with villages to construct public latrines, washing facilities, protected water stations, and to organize solid waste disposal efforts to better protect community health. Over one million people will be direct recipients of USAID food assistance under this program. = At America = In December 2010, the United States reached out to the Indonesian youth by establishing @america, a high-tech, interactive operation heralded as the digital-age successor to the venerable American Cultural Center. It is also American public diplomacy's latest effort to win over young foreigners, especially in Muslim countries. @america represents the U.S. government's first attempt at creating a full-fledged cultural center since the September 11, 2001 attacks. @america is a cutting-edge, 21st-century cultural center where visitors can explore and experience the U.S., and express their thoughts and ideas about America. At @america, visitors could discover state-of-the-art technology and learn more about the U.S. Through discussions, webchats, cultural performances, debates, competitions, and exhibitions, visitors can experience the best of America ‚Äì its ideals, creativity, and diversity. This American Cultural Center located on the third floor of Pacific Place Mall, Sudirman Central Business District, Jakarta.

In January 2018 visit to Jakarta, Secretary of Defense James Mattis stated that Indonesia was a maritime fulcrum in the Asia- Pacific region, and wanted Indonesia and the U.S. to cooperate on issues of maritime security. During that same visit, Secretary Mattis said he believed that Kopassus had reformed sufficiently to justify increased contact with the U.S. =Military sales= The United States is a major supplier of military hardware to Indonesia, including of Boeing AH-64 Apache helicopters and the F-16 Fighting Falcon. As of January 2018, Indonesia is exploring purchasing an additional 48 F-16 aircraft, for as much as $4.5 billion.

The thirteener is located in Pike National Forest, northeast (bearing 41¬∞) of the Town of Alma in Park County, Colorado, United States. Mount Silverheels is just east of two fourteeners: Mount Bross and Mount Lincoln. Legend of Silverheels The mountain was named for Silverheels, a dance hall girl in the nearby mining camp of Buckskin Joe, now a ghost town. She was nicknamed \\"Silverheels\\" because of the silver shoes she wore while dancing. She wore a blue or white mask so as to conceal her face, and her actual name is unknown. Well-compensated by the trappers and prospectors who watched her dance, Silverheels was personally generous, having used her own money to bring in doctors during a smallpox epidemic in Buckskin Joe. After the disease waned, Silverheels left Buckskin Joe and was never heard from again. In the words of Frank H. Mayer, a United States marshal in Park County: \\"The best we could do was to name the mountain after her.\\"Laura King Van Dusen, \\"Colonel Frank Mayer: Buffalo Hunter, Civil War Drummer Boy, Author, Met Dancehall Entertainer Silverheels When U.S. Marshal of Buckskin\\", Historic Tales from Park County: Parked in the Past (Charleston, South Carolina: The History Press, 2013), , pp. 57. The smallpox epidemic struck in 1861. Most miners remained behind to protect their claims, but the women and children largely fled to Denver. Silverheels stayed behind to nurse her friends and neighbors. She too contracted the disease but survived, having taken refuge in her cabin located at the base of Mount Silverheels. Once the epidemic was over, the surviving miners raised $5,000 in appreciation of her efforts in fighting the epidemic. However, Silverheels had left her cabin. According to legend, she had remained in isolation because the smallpox had scarred her face. The money was returned to the miners, and she was instead honored by the naming of the mountain. Several years later when Buckskin Joe was desolate from the decline of the gold rush, someone claimed to have seen a black-veiled woman placing flowers on the graves of those who died in the smallpox epidemic. Some since claim to have seen a black-veiled woman wandering around the Buckskin Joe Cemetery.

The levels characterize the role of modeling in a software project. The concept shows resemblance to the way software processes are rated with the Capability Maturity Model. There are 6 levels ;Level 0: No Specification: the specification of software is not written down. It is kept in the minds of the developers ;Level 1: Textual Specification: the software is specified by a natural language text (be it English or Chinese or something else), written down in one or more documents ;Level 2: Text with Models: a textual specification is enhanced with several models to show some of the main structures of the system ;Level 3: Models with Text: the specification of software is written down in one or more models. In addition to these models, natural language text is used to explain details, the background, and the motivation of the models, but the core of the specifications lies in the models. ;Level 4: Precise Models: the specification of the software is written down in one or more models. Natural language can still be used to explain the background and motivation of the models, but it takes on the same role as comments in source code. ;Level 5: Models only: the models are precise and detailed enough to allow complete code generation. The code generators at this level have become as trustworthy as compilers, therefore no developer needs to even look at the generated code. References *T.

History The San Jose Estates Administration Building was built in 1925 by the developers of San Jose Estates. After the real estate boom collapsed, Alfred I. duPont acquired the property. Upon his death in 1935, the property passed to his widow, Jesse Ball duPont. In 1941 Mrs. duPont agreed to let it be used for Episcopal worship services and it became known as Grace Chapel. The cadets from the Bolles Military Academy located across the street used it as their chapel also and attended Sunday worship services as a body. In 1949 Mrs. duPont gave the property to the Episcopal Diocese of Florida for the founding of a new congregation, and in 1951, Grace Chapel (as it was first known) became an Episcopal Parish, with The Reverend Grover Alison as its founding priest. Alison was also serving as the priest at Church Of Our Savior in Mandarin at the same time. In 1952 he left Mandarin and moved to San Jose.

Early life Szembek was born in a szlachta family on July 11, 1881, in the village of Porƒôba, near Alwernia. He graduated from the Vienna University and took up the post of an Austrian government clerk in Bosnia (1905-1908). In 1908, he settled in Krak√≥w. Diplomatic career In 1919, after Poland regained independence from the partitions of Poland, Szembek was named charg√© d'affaires and later he was the Polish ambassador in Budapest (1921-1924), Brussels (1925) and Bucharest (1927), where he remained until 1932. After returning to Poland, he took up the job of deputy secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Warsaw. After the invasion of Poland, he left Poland on September 17, 1939, along with other members of the government.

According to the governments of the United States and Ireland, relations have long been based on common ancestral ties and shared values.Ireland US Department of State Retrieved 2011-02-20Ireland - U.S. Relations Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade Retrieved 2016-02-27 Besides regular dialogue on political and economic issues, the U.S. and Irish governments have official exchanges in areas such as medical research and education. Ireland pursues a policy of neutrality through non-alignment and is consequently not a member of NATO, although it does participate in Partnership for Peace. However, on many occasions Ireland has provided tacit support to the United States and its allies. In 2012 according to a U.S. Global Leadership Report, 67% of Irish people approved of the U.S. leadership of Barack Obama. This was the fourth-highest rating for any surveyed country in Europe.U.S. Global Leadership Project Report - 2012 Gallup  History  =Pre-Irish independence= In 1800 under the Acts of Union 1800, Ireland was politically unified with Britain to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. All major diplomatic decisions regarding Ireland were made in London. From this time until 1922, when twenty-six of thirty-two counties of Ireland seceded to form the Irish Free State (later becoming the Republic of Ireland), the United States' formal diplomatic affairs with Ireland were carried out through London. Immigration The Scots-Irish were some of the first settlers in the 13 colonies and played an important role in The War of Independence, as well as being some of the first cattle drivers in North America. The Irish exerted their own influence inside the United States, particularly through Democratic Party politics. From 1820 to 1860, 2 million Irish arrived in the United States, 75% of these after the Great Irish Famine (or The Great Hunger) of 1845‚Äì1852, struck. Most of them joined fast-growing Irish shantytowns in American cities. The famine hurt Irish men and women alike, especially those poorest or without land. It altered the family structures of Ireland because fewer people could afford to marry and raise children, causing many to adopt a single lifestyle. Consequently, many Irish citizens were less bound to family obligations and could more easily migrate to the United States in the following decade. Fenians After the American Civil War, authorities in the U.S. who were resentful of Britain's role in the war looked the other way as the Fenian Brotherhood plotted and even attempted an invasion of Canada.Niall Whelehan, The Dynamiters: Irish Nationalism and Political Violence in the Wider World, 1867‚Äì1900 (Cambridge, 2012) The Fenian Raids proved a failure but Irish American politicians, a growing power in the Democratic Party, demanded more independence for Ireland and made anti-British rhetoric‚Äîcalled \\"twisting the lion's tail\\"‚Äîa staple of election campaign appeals to the Irish vote. De Valera √âamon de Valera, a prominent figure in the Easter Rising and the Irish War of Independence, was himself born in New York City in 1882. His American citizenship spared him from execution for his role in the Easter Rising. De Valera went on to be named President of D√°il √âireann, and in May 1919 he visited the United States in this role. The mission had three objectives: to ask for official recognition of the Irish Republic, to float a loan to finance the work of the Government (and by extension, the Irish Republican Army), and to secure the support of the American people for the republic. His visit lasted from June 1919 to December 1920 and had mixed success. One negative outcome was the splitting of the Irish-American organisations into pro- and anti-de Valera factions.Jordan, Anthony J. Eamon de Valera 1882‚Äì1975, pp. 63‚Äì70. De Valera managed to raise $5,500,000 from American supporters, an amount that far exceeded the hopes of the D√°il. Of this, $500,000 was devoted to the American presidential campaign in 1920 which helped him gain wider public support there. In 1921 it was said that $1,466,000 had already been spent, and it is unclear when the net balance arrived in Ireland. Recognition was not forthcoming in the international sphere. He also had difficulties with various Irish-American leaders, such as John Devoy and Judge Daniel F. Cohalan, who resented the dominant position he established, preferring to retain their control over Irish affairs in the United States. World War I The United States Navy had five U.S. Naval Air Stations in Ireland from 1918 to 1919. These stations were specifically in place to protect Ireland and neighbouring countries from belligerent submarine aggression. The names and locations of these bases were NAS Queenstown, NAS Wexford, NAS Whiddy Island, NAS Berehaven and NAS Lough Foyle. =Post-Irish independence= U.S. recognition of Ireland The Irish War of Independence ultimately ended with the Anglo-Irish Treaty, which confirmed the partition of Ireland into the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland, the latter of which opted to remain a part of the United Kingdom. The Irish Free State quickly fell into the Irish Civil War between Pro-Treaty Forces who supported independence via partition and Anti-Treaty Forces who opposed partition and wanted independence for the entire island of Ireland. Pro-Treaty Forces won the Irish Civil War in 1923, and the following year the United States recognized the Irish Free State and established diplomatic relations with it. The Irish Free State was succeeded by the new state of Ireland in 1937, and formally declared itself a republic in 1949. World War II/The Emergency Ireland was officially neutral during World War II, but declared an official state of emergency on 2 September 1939 and the Army was mobilized. As the Emergency progressed, more and newer equipment was purchased for the rapidly expanding force from the UK and the United States as well as some manufactured at home. For the duration of the Emergency, Ireland, while formally neutral, tacitly supported the Allies in several ways.Fanning, R., 1983, Independent Ireland, Dublin: Helicon, Ltd.., pp 124‚Äì25 The Irish Sea was mined. German military personnel were interned in the Curragh along with the belligerent powers' servicemen, whereas Allied airmen and sailors who crashed in Ireland were very often repatriated, usually by secretly moving them across the border to Northern Ireland. G2, the Army's intelligence section, played a vital role in the detection and arrest of German spies, such as Hermann G√∂rtz. Cold War During the Cold War, Irish military policy, while ostensibly neutral, was biased towards NATO. G2 monitored communists and agents of communist governments operating in Ireland, primarily through embassies in Dublin, sharing information with western allies. During the Cuban Missile Crisis, Se√°n Lemass authorised the search of Cuban and Czechoslovak aircraft passing through Shannon and passed the information to the CIA.Irish Times, 28 December 2007 p. 1. Celtic Tiger U.S. foreign direct investment in Ireland has been particularly important to the growth and modernization of Irish industry since 1980, providing new technology, export capabilities, and employment opportunities. During the 1990s, Ireland experienced a period of rapid economic growth referred to as the Celtic Tiger. While Ireland's historical economic ties to the UK had often been the subject of criticism, Peader Kirby argued that the new ties to the US economy were met with a \\"satisfied silence\\".Paul Keenan. Book review of Peader Kirby's The Celtic Tiger In Distress. Accessed 4 November 2006. Nevertheless, voices on the political left have decried the \\"closer to Boston than Berlin\\" philosophy of the Fianna F√°il-Progressive Democrat government. Growing wealth was blamed for rising crime levels among youths, particularly alcohol-related violence resulting from increased spending power. However, it was also accompanied by rapidly increased life expectancy and very high quality of life ratings; the country ranked first in The Economist's 2005 quality of life index. The Troubles The Troubles caused a strain in the Special Relationship between the United Kingdom and the United States. In February 1994, British Prime Minister John Major refused to answer US President Bill Clinton's telephone calls for days over his decision to grant Sinn F√©in leader Gerry Adams a visa to visit the United States. Adams was listed as a terrorist by London.Villa, ‚ÄòThe Reagan-Thatcher \\"special relationship\\" has not weathered the years‚Äô. The US State Department, the CIA, the US Justice Department and the FBI all opposed the move on the grounds that it made the United States look 'soft on terrorism' and 'could do irreparable damage to the special relationship'.Alec Russell, 'Major's fury over US visa for Adams', Daily Telegraph (23 June 2004), p. 9. Under pressure from Congress, the president hoped the visit would encourage the IRA to renounce violence.Joseph O'Grady, 'An Irish Policy Born in the U.S.A.: Clinton's Break with the Past', Foreign Affairs, Vol. 75, No. 3 (May/June 1996), pp. 4‚Äì5. While Adams offered nothing new, and violence escalated within weeks,O'Grady, 'An Irish Policy Born in the U.S.A.', p. 5. the president later claimed vindication after the IRA ceasefire of August 1994.Russell, ‚ÄòMajor's fury‚Äô, Daily Telegraph, p. 9. To the disappointment of the prime minister, Clinton lifted the ban on official contacts and received Adams at the White House on St. Patrick's Day 1995, despite the fact the paramilitaries had not agreed to disarm. The US also involved itself as an intermediary during the Northern Ireland peace process, including, in 1995, US Senator George Mitchell being appointed to lead an international body to provide an independent assessment of the decommissioning issue, and President Clinton speaking in favor of the \\"peace process\\" to a huge rally at Belfast's City Hall where he called IRA Fighters \\"yesterday's men\\". Mitchell announced the reaching of the Good Friday Agreement on 10 April 1998 stating, \\"I am pleased to announce that the two governments and the political parties in Northern Ireland have reached agreement,\\" and it emerged later that President Clinton had made a number of telephone calls to party leaders to encourage them to reach this agreement. War on Terror Ireland's air facilities were used by the United States military for the delivery of military personnel involved in the 2003 invasion of Iraq through Shannon Airport. The airport had previously been used for the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, as well as the First Gulf War. ‚Äì Tony Gregory speaking in D√°il √âireann The government of Republic of Ireland has come under internal and external pressure to inspect airplanes at Shannon Airport to investigate whether or not they contain extraordinary rendition captives. Police at Shannon said that they had received political instruction not to approach, search or otherwise interfere with US aircraft suspected of being involved in extraordinary rendition flights. Irish Justice Minister Dermot Ahern sought permission from the US for random inspection of US flights, to provide political \\"cover\\" to him in case rendition flights were revealed to have used Shannon; he believed at least three flights had done so.Kelley, Dara,WikiLeaks reveals Justice Minister's Dermot Ahern's rendition fears Irish Central, 18 December 2010. Ireland has been censured by the European Parliament for its role in facilitating extraordinary rendition and taking insufficient or no measures to uphold its obligations under the UN CAT.EU to censure Ahern over rendition role, The Irish Times, 24 January 2007. European Union With Ireland's membership in the European Union, the discussion of EU trade and economic policies, as well as other aspects of EU policy, is also a key element in the U.S.-Irish relationship. In recent years, Ireland has attempted to act as a diplomatic bridge between the United States and the European Union. During its 2004 Presidency of the Council of the European Union, Ireland worked to strengthen U.S.-EU ties that had been strained by the Iraq War, and former Irish Taoiseach John Bruton was named EU Ambassador to the United States. In May 2011, U.S. President Barack Obama visited Ireland.Obama in Ireland: president searches for 'missing apostrophe' The Telegraph, 23 May 2011 In 2017, President Donald Trump sought to reform the tax code to repatriate American businesses abroad, and specifically referenced Ireland on several occasions, stating \\"Many, many companies, they‚Äôre going to Ireland.\\" Despite this, Irish politicians thought the U.S. tax overhaul posed little threat to U.S. investment in Ireland, with European Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development Phil Hogan stating, \\"Ireland remains a logical and very attractive European base for American business.\\" In April 2019, Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, visited the border of Ireland and Northern Ireland and said that if Brexit compromised the Good Friday Agreement then there was \\"no chance\\" of a US-UK trade deal.  Economic ties  Taoiseach Bertie Ahern meeting President Bill Clinton in the oval office in March 2000. Subsidiaries of US multinationals have located in Ireland due to low taxation and an educated English-speaking population. Ireland is the world's most profitable country for US corporations, according to analysis by US tax journal Tax Notes. In 2013, Ireland was named the \\"best country for business\\" by Forbes. The United States is Ireland's largest export partner and second-largest import partner (after the United Kingdom), accounting for 23.2% of exports and 14.1% of imports in 2010. It is also Ireland's largest trading partner outside of the European Union. In 2010, trade between Ireland and the United States was worth around $36.25 billion. U.S. exports to Ireland were valued at $7.85 billion while Irish exports to the U.S. were worth some $28.4 billion, with Ireland having a trade surplus of $20.5 billion over the U.S. The range of U.S. products imported to Ireland includes electrical components, computers and peripherals, pharmaceuticals, electrical equipment, and livestock feed. Exports to the United States include alcoholic beverages, chemicals and related products, electronic data processing equipment, electrical machinery, textiles and clothing, and glassware. The major U.S. investments in Ireland to date have included multibillion-dollar investments by Intel, Dell, Apple Inc, Microsoft, IBM, Wyeth, Quintiles, Google, EMC and Abbott Laboratories. Currently, there are more than 600 U.S. subsidiaries operating in Ireland, employing in excess of 100,000 people and spanning activities from manufacturing of high-tech electronics, computer products, medical supplies, and pharmaceuticals to retailing, banking and finance, and other services. Many U.S. businesses find Ireland an attractive location to manufacture for the EU market, since as a member of the EU it has tariff free access to the European Common Market. Government policies are generally formulated to facilitate trade and inward direct investment. The availability of an educated, well-trained, English- speaking work force and relatively moderate wage costs have been important factors. Ireland offers good long-term growth prospects for U.S. companies under an innovative financial incentive programme, including capital grants and favourable tax treatment, such as a low corporation income tax rate for manufacturing firms and certain financial services firms. Irish firms are now beginning to provide a lot of employment in the U.S., for example indigenous Irish companies, particularly in the high tech sector have provided in excess of 80,000 jobs to date for American citizens. Cultural ties President John F. Kennedy in motorcade in Cork on June 27, 1963 Irish immigration to the USA has played a large role in the culture of the United States. About 33.3 million Americans‚Äî10.5% of the total population‚Äîreported Irish ancestry in the 2013 American Community Survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. Irish Americans have made many contributions to American culture and sport. Halloween is thought to have evolved from the ancient Celtic/Gaelic festival of Samhain, which was introduced in the American colonies by Irish settlers. A number of the presidents of the United States have Irish origins. The extent of Irish heritage varies. For example, Chester A. Arthur's father and both of Andrew Jackson's parents were Irish-born, while George W. Bush has a rather distant Irish ancestry. Ronald Reagan's father was of Irish ancestry, while his mother also had some Irish ancestors. John F. Kennedy had Irish lineage on both sides. Within this group, only Kennedy was raised as a practicing Roman Catholic. Former President Barack Obama's Irish heritage originates from his Kansas-born mother, Ann Dunham, whose ancestry is Irish and English. His Vice President Joe Biden is also an Irish-American. Emigration, long a vital element in the U.S.‚ÄìIrish relationship, declined significantly with Ireland's economic boom in the 1990s. For the first time in its modern history, Ireland experienced high levels of inward migration, a phenomenon with political, economic, and social consequences. However, Irish citizens do continue the common practice of taking temporary residence overseas for work or study, mainly in the US, UK, Australia and elsewhere in Europe, before returning to establish careers in Ireland. The US J-1 visa program, for example, remains a popular means for Irish youths to work temporarily in the United States.United States Department of State  Resident diplomatic missions  * Ireland has an embassy in Washington, D.C. and consulates-general in Atlanta, Austin, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City and San Francisco.Embassy of Ireland in Washington, D.C. * United States has an embassy in Dublin.Embassy of the United States in Dublin File:Embassy of Ireland in Washington DC.jpg|Embassy of Ireland in Washington, D.C.

Range H. heurippa is found on the eastern slopes of the Andes Mountains in Colombia. Hybridisation The color pattern of H. heurippa appears to be a combination of the patterns found on H. cydno and H. melpomene. Natural hybrids from San Crist√≥bal, T√°chira, Venezuela, display wing patterns very similar to H. heurippa, supporting the hypothesis of a hybrid origin for the species. A team from the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama attempted to recreate H. heurippa by breeding H. cydno with H. melpomene. In only three generations of hybridization, the investigators developed butterflies with wing patterns almost identical to those of H. heurippa that may be very similar to the first H. heurippa individuals. Butterflies within Heliconius are \\"extremely choosey\\" about finding mates with wing patterns that match their own, and H. heurippa males given a choice between mating with females of H. heurippa, H. cydno, or H. melpomene species were 75 to 90 percent more likely to choose their own kind. They were similarly discriminating when presented with photographs of wing patterns instead of actual mates. The wing patterns of H. heurippa individuals also make them undesirable as mates for members of their parents' species as well, showing evidence for reproductive isolation between H. heurippa and its putative parental species. Skeptics wish to see further genetic sequencing demonstrating that wild H. heurippa is a hybrid similar to the laboratory- developed animals, and the H. heurippa hybrid speciation hypothesis has been the subject of a recent (2011) critical review. There is evidence to suggest that the genome of H. heurippa may be a mosaic. The species H. timareta and H. pachinus are also proposed to result from the hybridization of H. cydno and H. melpomene.

History  The United States maintains close and productive relations with the Government of Jamaica. Former Prime Minister Patterson visited Washington, DC, several times after assuming office in 1992. In April 2001, Prime Minister Patterson and other Caribbean leaders met with President George W. Bush during the Summit of the Americas in Quebec, Canada, at which a \\"Third Border Initiative\\" was launched to deepen U.S. cooperation with Caribbean nations and enhance economic development and integration of the Caribbean nations. Portia Simpson Miller attended the \\"Conference on the Caribbean--A 20/20 Vision\\" in Washington in June 2007. The United States is Jamaica's most important trading partner: bilateral trade in goods in 2005 was over $2 billion. Jamaica is a popular destination for American tourists; more than 1.2 million Americans visited in 2006. In addition, some 10,000 American citizens, including many dual-nationals born on the island, permanently reside in Jamaica. The Government of Jamaica also seeks to attract U.S. investment and supports efforts to create a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA). More than 80 U.S. firms have operations in Jamaica, and total U.S. investment is estimated at more than $3 billion. An office of the U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service, located in the embassy, actively assists American businesses seeking trade opportunities in Jamaica. The country is a beneficiary of the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA). The United States Chamber of Commerce, which also is available to assist U.S. business in Jamaica, has offices in Kingston. Embassy of Jamaica in Washington, D.C. U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) assistance to Jamaica since its independence in 1962 has contributed to reducing the population growth rate, the attainment of higher standards in a number of critical health indicators, and the diversification and expansion of Jamaica's export base. USAID's primary objective is promoting sustainable economic growth. Other key objectives are improved environmental quality and natural resource protection, strengthening democratic institutions and respect for the rule of law, as well as family planning. In fiscal year 2006, the USAID mission in Jamaica operated a program totaling more than $21 million in development assistance. The Peace Corps has been in Jamaica continuously since 1962. Since then, more than 3,300 volunteers have served in the country. Today, the Peace Corps works in the following projects: Youth-at-Risk, which includes adolescent reproductive health, HIV/AIDS education, and the needs of marginalized males; water sanitation, which includes rural waste water solutions and municipal waste water treatment; and environmental education, which helps address low levels of awareness and strengthens environmental nongovernmental organizations. The Peace Corps in Jamaica fields about 70 volunteers who work in every parish on the island, including some inner-city communities in Kingston. Jamaica is a major transit point for cocaine en route to the United States and is also a key source of marijuana and marijuana derivative products for the Americas. During 2006, the Government of Jamaica seized narcotics destined for the United States, arrested key traffickers and criminal gang leaders, and dismantled their organizations. Jamaica remains the Caribbean's largest producer and exporter of marijuana. The efforts of the Jamaica Constabulary Force (JCF) and Jamaica Defense Force (JDF) enabled cannabis seizures to increase by over 200% in 2006. In 2006, the JCF arrested 5,409 persons on drug related charges, including 269 foreigners. Additionally, more than 20,000 kilograms of marijuana were seized, and 6,300,000 marijuana plants eradicated in 2006. Operation Kingfish is a multinational task force (Jamaica, U.S., United Kingdom, and Canada) for coordinating investigations leading to the arrest of major criminals. From its October 2004 inception through December 2006, Operation Kingfish launched 1,378 operations resulting in the seizure of 56 vehicles, 57 boats, one aircraft, 206 firearms, and two containers conveying drugs. Kingfish was also responsible for the seizure of over 13 metric tons of cocaine (mostly outside of Jamaica) and over 27,390 pounds of compressed marijuana. In 2006 Operation Kingfish mounted 870 operations, compared to 607 in 2005. In 2006, through cargo scanning, the Jamaican Customs Contraband Enforcement Team seized over 3,000 pounds of marijuana, ten kilograms of cocaine, and approximately $500,000 at Jamaican air and seaports.

Jordan has been a very close Major non-NATO ally in the Middle East since 1996. History King Hussein meeting US President Jimmy Carter in Washington in 1977 Relations between the U.S. and Jordan have been close for over four decades. U.S. policy seeks to reinforce Jordan's commitment to peace, stability, and moderation. The peace process and Jordan's opposition to terrorism parallel and indirectly assist wider U.S. interests. Accordingly, through economic and military assistance and through close political cooperation, the United States has helped Jordan maintain its stability and prosperity.\\"U.S. Relations With Jordan\\" Background Notes Since its inception, Jordan has relied on sponsorship from major Western powers. Great Britain filled this role until the late 1940s; the U.S. stepped in during the 1950s. During the Gulf War of 1991, Jordan tried to solve the situation in an Arabian framework that the U.S. interpreted as pro-Iraq. As a result, the U.S. started monitoring the country's only ocean port, Aqaba, to prevent any supplies from reaching Iraq. Jordan suffered financial hardships for this, and attitudes toward the U.S. only improved during the Madrid Conference of 1991, where the U.S. deemed Jordanian participation as essential. King Abdullah advised Washington against the 2003 Iraq War, but later allegedly gave the invading coalition some degree of covert and tacit support, despite the overwhelming opinion of his own public.Rick Fawn and Raymond Hinnebusch The Iraq Causes and Consequences War (US, Colorado: Lynne Rienner Publishers:2006, p. 143) The Jordanian government publicly opposed the war against Iraq. The King stressed to the United States and European Union that a diplomatic solution, in accordance with UN Security Council (UNSC) resolutions 1284 (1999) and 1409 (2002), was the only appropriate model for resolving the conflict between Iraq and the UN.Rick Fawn and Raymond Hinnebusch The Iraq Causes and Consequences War (US, Colorado: Lynne Rienner Publishers:2006, p. 144) In August 2002 he told the Washington Post that an attempt to invade Iraq would be a \\"tremendous mistake\\" and that it could \\"throw the whole area into turmoil\\".G. Kessler and P. Slevin, \\"Abdullah: Foreign Oppose Attack; Jordanian King to Urge Bush to Focus on Peace in Mideast, Not Invasion of Iraq,\\" Washington Post, 1 August 2002 =Programs= U.S. Air Force Special Tactics Commandos training with Jordanian special operations forces Since 1952, the United States has provided Jordan with economic assistance totaling more than $14 billion ($1.3 billion in loans and $7.7 billion in grants), including funds for development projects, health care, education, construction to increase water availability, support for microeconomic policy shifts toward a more completely free market system, and both grant and loan acquisition of U.S. agriculture commodities. These programs have been successful and have contributed to Jordanian stability while strengthening the bilateral relationship. U.S. military assistance‚Äîprovision of material and training‚Äîis designed to meet Jordan's legitimate defense needs, including preservation of border integrity and regional stability. Jordan signed a Threshold Agreement with the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) in October 2006, and was subsequently deemed by the MCC to be eligible for a Compact Agreement in recognition of the country's progress on economic, social, and political reform indicators. As of 2013, the United States had given Jordan's intelligence agency, the General Intelligence Directorate (the G.I.D), over $3.3 billion in aid over the previous five years, with another $200 million pledged for the Syrian refugee crisis. The G.I.D is a close partner of the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). In 2014, due to concerns over Jordan's fragile economy being stretched by the influx of Syrian refugees, President Obama announced he would seek $1 billion in loan guarantees in addition to the $1.25 billion Congress approved in 2013. =Human Rights Promotion= Since the deadly terrorist attacks of 9/11, the United States has focused on security and stability in the region, while simultaneously fighting the War on Terror. As military training and intelligence operations became a higher priority after 2001, the Bush Administration revised the nation's rhetoric on human rights promotion and democracy in the region, despite the turbulent political climate of the Middle East. In an effort to move toward a more interventionist foreign policy, Bush created a specific freedom agenda. He has strongly encouraged \\"...the spread of freedom as the great alternative to the terrorists' ideology of hatred...\\". Based on American ideals of democracy and liberty, the agenda emphasizes the way the continued spread of freedoms can combat the conditions and opposition that breed extremism. The United States' strong push for action and democratic reform, especially from 2001 to 2008 resulted in the refinement of technical programs and an increase in democracy assistance. Issues of gender empowerment, legislative reform, emphasis on elections, and support for educational and developmental programs have risen to the forefront. Recent reform/action taken for human rights promotion and democratization in Jordan include: \\\\- 2,800 troops deployed for protection of the border \\\\- New leadership for the Ministry of Interior, Jordanian Armed Forces, and the General Intelligence \\\\- Democracy assistance for programs such as Jordan School Expansion Project, Community Engagement Project, Local Enterprise Support Activity, and Workforce Development Program \\\\- Push to pass proposal for the number of female representatives to grow to 23, one representative for each electoral district Embassy Principal U.S. officials in Jordan include: * Ambassador Alice Wells * Deputy Chief of Mission Stephanie T. Williams The U.S. embassy is located in Abdoun, Amman. Friends of Jordan Caucus In the United States Congress, the Friends of Jordan Caucus was launched March 6, 2009, to support a strong relationship between Jordan and the United States and to facilitate the exchange of ideas between Members of the House of Representatives and Jordanian officials. The caucus will be co- chaired by Congressmen Schiff and Boustany, and Congressmen Baird and Fortenberry (R-NE) will serve as vice chairs.

These vehicles will usually be equipped with larger luggage space, and incorporate special branding. They are also commonly (but not always) painted with bright colours to stand out among other airport vehicles and to be easily seen by the crews of taxiing aircraft when negotiating the aprons. Airport buses have been in use since the 1960s, when nationalised operator British European Airways employed the archetypal London red AEC Routemaster buses in a blue and white livery with luggage trailers on service to Heathrow Airport. On airport transfer Bus transport within an airport may take the following forms, and be operated by the airport owner, an airline, or a contractor to either. =Airside transfer= Airside transfer apron bus In the cases where airports do not use a jet bridge, has too few of them, for long distance transfers or for reasons of safety, passengers will be transferred from the airport terminal arrival or departure gate to the aircraft using an airside transfer bus or apron bus. Airside transfer buses can be of normal bus design, or due to not running on the public highway, can be extra long and wide, to hold the maximum number of passengers. Sometimes a trailer bus is employed. Transfer buses are usually fitted with minimal or no seating, with passengers standing for the journey. Sometimes for larger aircraft a coach is used to ferry customers to or from the terminal as coaches hold more people. Transfer buses will usually be fitted with flashing beacons for operating airside near runways. They may also feature driving cabs at both ends. =Terminal transfer= The Wiki Wiki terminal transfer bus at Honolulu International Airport In cases where the airport features multiple terminals which are far apart or not physically connected, and where there exists no people mover or other transfer alternative, a zero-fare transfer bus may be employed to transfer connecting passengers from one terminal to another. Terminal transfer bus Image of a British Airways transfer bus at Heathrow Terminal 4 Terminal transfer may also be incorporated into public transport bus networks. =Car park transfer= Car park transfer bus In cases where the airport owned or affiliated car parks are large or relatively far from the terminal building, the airport owner or contractor may provide free car park shuttle busesImage of Southampton Airport car park shuttle bus making circular or shuttle runs between terminals and car park bus stands. Off airport transfer Third party companies offering services to airline passengers may also operate buses as part of their business, with pick-up and drop off points near the airport terminal, and extra luggage space. These usually comprise: * Off airport car parking services. These car park providers provide cheap car-parking some distance from the airport, by transferring passengers in shuttle buses. These can be anywhere from luxury coaches, full size buses or minibuses, sometimes fitted with luggage trailers. * Car rental companies. Often, car rental providers will have their vehicles stored off-site, and transfer customers in regular buses. * Airport hotels will often offer a complimentary airport bus service, to entice guests to stay at their property. Public bus services A free inter-modal shuttle bus operated by Arriva North East for Durham Tees Valley Airport Several public transport operations may include airport focused services, such as: =Intermodal shuttle buses= Some transport companies may provide shuttle buses between railway stations and airports, with transit buses fitted for extra luggage space. These are sometimes supported financially by the airport or railway company. In England, Durham Tees Valley Airport contracted Arriva North East bus company to provide a free shuttle bus for airport passengers, and railway operator Govia Thameslink Railway operates a fare paying shuttle bus from Luton Airport Parkway railway station to Luton Airport. In addition, some airlines run bus services from a city's bus terminal to an airport or, in other cases, connecting two airports whose cities' population sizes are deemed too small for them to have air service between each other. One example of the former is Singapore Airlines' bus service from downtown Newark, New Jersey to Newark Liberty International Airport. An example of the latter is United Airlines service from Beaumont Airport in Beaumont, Texas to Houston George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston, which used to be done on United Express SAAB 340 aircraft but which is now run on a bus. =Premium airlink services= Premium airlink services Bus companies that operate normal transit bus services may often operate a premium fare route to an airport alongside their standard routes, using specially brandedImage of Dublin Bus airlink branded premium service bus vehicles with extra luggage space. These routes are usually limited stop, rather than point to point shuttle buses. Newly privatised London Buses operated an Airbus service from Victoria Coach Station to Heathrow Airport in the 1990s, although this was withdrawn after London Underground and Heathrow Express rail links were improved. =Demand responsive shuttle buses= Some public bus operators have moved into the demand responsive transport sector, bridging the gap between premium fixed route bus services and private hire airport taxicabs, incorporating an area in which the service can vary its route to pick up pre-booked passengers. Unlike private hire firms, these are still legally public buses. Examples include Dot2Dot from National Express, and the Edinburgh Shuttle operated by Lothian Buses, which feature high specification minibus based vehicles with luggage space. =Express services= An airport service branded express coach operated by Green Line Coaches in the UK Several long distance express bus and coach operators make airports hubs of their service networks, such as National Express Coaches Airport services. These services do not necessarily use vehicles that have any extra modification beyond the standard express bus or coach specification, although they will usually carry a livery indicating the airport service, and special route numbers such as 747. A specialist express bus operation is that of the likes of easyBus, that runs minibus services from stops in London direct to Luton Airport. =Terminal transfer= In the case where different airport terminals are far apart and not linked by other modes, public bus operators may choose to provide a route to link the two terminals, either as a point to point shuttle or as part of a standard route network. A specialist example being the Fastway, which is a bus rapid transit scheme which at the heart of its route network links the north and south terminals of Gatwick Airport. =Railair= RailAir, or Railair, services are designed to connect railway stations to airports, where there is no direct train link. Other non airport bus services =Standard bus services= In addition to the specially equipped or liveried buses that help airports, several non-specific bus services may also stop or terminate at airports. These are often scheduled outside normal operating hours to serve the airport workers and passengers with unsociable flight times as well as normal passengers. =Private hire= Several private hire airport transfer companies, or airport focused taxicab operators, also use minibuses, to varying specifications, for transporting groups of people.

It is a method that is used to increase the density of soil deposits. The process involves dropping a heavy weight repeatedly on the ground at regularly spaced intervals. The weight and the height determine the amount of compaction that would occur. The weight that is used, depends on the degree of compaction desired and is between 8 tonne to 36 tonne. The height varies from 1m to 30m. The impact of the free fall creates stress waves that help in the densification of the soil. These stress waves can penetrate up to 10m. In cohesionless soils, these waves create liquefaction that is followed by the compaction of the soil, and in cohesive soils, they create an increased amount of pore water pressure that is followed by the compaction of the soil. Pore water pressure is the pressure of water that is trapped within the particles of rocks and soils. The degree of compaction depends on the weight of the hammer, the height from which the hammer is dropped, and the spacing of the locations at which the hammer is dropped. The initial weight dropping has the most impact, and penetrates up to a greater depth. The following drops, if spaced closer to one another, compact the shallower layers and the process is completed by compacting the soil at the surface. Most soil types can be improved with dynamic compaction. Old fills and granular soils are most often treated. The soils that are below the water table have to be treated carefully to permit emission of the excess pore water pressure that is created when the weight is dropped onto the surface.

The Deccan Traps, Gangetic Plains and the Himalayas are the major geographical features. The country faces different forms of pollution as its major environmental issue and is more vulnerable to the effects of climate change being a developing nation. India has laws protecting the environment and is one of the countries that signed the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) treaty. The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change and each particular state forest departments plan and implement environmental policies throughout the country.  Features  =Biota = The Bengal tiger. Along with other species, India has the most species of cats than any other country. India has some of the world's most biodiverse ecozones‚Äîdesert, high mountains, highlands, tropical and temperate forests, swamplands, plains, grasslands, areas surrounding rivers and an island archipelago. It hosts three biodiverse hotspots: the Western Ghats, the Himalayas and the Indo-Burma region. These hotspots have numerous endemic species. In 1992, around 7,43,534 km2 of land in the country was under forests and 92 percent of that belonged to the government. Only 22.7 percent was forested compared to the recommended 33 percent by the National Forest Policy Resolution (1952). Majority of it are broad-leaved deciduous trees which comprise one-sixth sal and one-tenth teak. Coniferous types are found in the northern high altitude regions and comprise pines, junipers and deodars. There are 350 species of mammals, 375 reptiles, 130 amphibians, 20,000 insects, 19000 fish and 1200 species of birds in India. The Asiatic lion, Bengal tiger and leopard are the main predators; the country has the most species of cats than any other. Elephants, the Indian Rhinoceros and eight species of deer are also found. There are over 17000 species of flowering plants in India, which account for six percent of the total plant species in the world. India comprises seven percent of world's flora. Wide range of climatic conditions in India gave rise to rich variety of flora. India covers more than 45,000 species of flora, out of which several are endemic to the region. India is divided into eight main floristic regions: North-Western Himalayas, Eastern Himalayas, Assam, Indus plain, Ganga plain, the Deccan, the Malabar and the Andamans. = Geography = India lies on the Indian Plate, the northern portion of the Indo-Australian Plate, whose continental crust forms the Indian subcontinent. The country is situated north of the equator between 8¬∞4' and 37¬∞6' north latitude and 68¬∞7' and 97¬∞25' east longitude. It is the seventh-largest country in the world, with a total area of . Total area excludes disputed territories not under Indian control. India measures from north to south and from east to west. It has a land frontier of and a coastline of . Early Eocene some 52 mya was a key factor in determining India's modern-day climate; global climate and ocean chemistry may have been impacted too. The Indian plate and Eurasia collided between 40 and 60 million years ago according to four observations, one being that there is no mammalian fossil record in India from around 50 million years ago. On its way, the Indian plate passed over the Reunion hotspot which led to volcanic activity, thus forming the Deccan Traps. Its collision with the Eurasian plate led to the rise of the Himalayas and the continuous tectonic activity still makes it an earthquake prone area. The Gangetic plains were formed by the deposition of silt by the Ganga and its tributaries into the area between the Himalayas and the Vindhya range. The rock formations can be divided into the Archaean, Proterozoic (Dharwar system), Cuddupah system, Vindhyan system, Gondwana system, The Deccan Traps, Tertiary system, Pleistocene period and recent formations. The climate comprises a wide range of weather conditions across a vast geographic scale and varied topography, making generalisations difficult. Given the size of India with the Himalayas, Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean, there is a great variation in temperature and precipitation distribution in the subcontinent. Based on the K√∂ppen system, where the mean monthly temperature, mean monthly rainfall and mean annual rainfall are considered, India hosts six major climatic subtypes, ranging from arid desert in the west, alpine tundra and glaciers in the north, and humid tropical regions supporting rainforests in the southwest and the island territories. Many regions have starkly different microclimates. The Indian Meteorological Department divides the seasons into four: Winter (mid-December to mid-March), Summer (mid-March to May), Rainy (June to September), and Retreating Monsoon (October to mid-December).  Issues  Air pollution in India is a major environmental issue. Shown above is the Taj Mahal blanketed by smog. Pollution is one of the main environmental issues in India. * Water pollution is a major concern in the country. The major sources of water pollution are domestic, industrial, agricultural and shipping waste waters. The largest source of water pollution in India is untreated sewage. Other sources of pollution include agricultural runoff and unregulated small scale industry. Most rivers, lakes and surface water are polluted. * Land pollution: The main causes of soil (or land) pollution is soil erosion, excessive use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides, accumulation of solid and liquid waste, forest fires, and water-logging. It can be reduced by judicious use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides and treatment of effluents before being used for irrigation. Due to increasing population and enhanced food grains consumption, more and more rain fed crop lands are brought under intensive cultivation by ground and surface water irrigation. The irrigated land is losing gradually its fertility by converting into saline alkali soil. * Air pollution in the country is another concern. A major source is the matter released by the combustion of fossil fuels. Airborne particles like soot, fumes and dust are potentially harmful depending on the pollutant's chemical and physical structure. They can affect climate and reduce scattering of solar radiation in the atmosphere. * Noise pollution: This can be defined as the state of discomfort or stress caused by unwanted high intensity sound. It increases in proportion to urbanisation and industrialisation. =Climate change= Being a developing nation, India is more vulnerable to the effects of climate change due to its dependence on climate-sensitive sectors like agriculture and forestry. Low per capita incomes and small public budgets also lead to low financial adaptive capacity. The nation is vulnerable to the immediate socio-economic effects of climate change. A 2002 study indicated that the temperature over the country increased at around 0.57¬∞ per 100 years. Inadequate infrastructure also means that people are more exposed, and less resilient, to climate change. For example, as of 2015, only 124 million Indians were connected to a sewer and 297 million to a septic tank. The remainder depend on pit latrines or open defecation, which creates major risks of waterborne disease during floods - which will become more frequent and severe with climate change. These risks are more severe in urban areas, where the higher density of people means that basic infrastructure options might not be adequate. Additionally, many Indian megacities are in floodplains and deltas, and will therefore be very exposed to climate hazards such as sea level rise, storm surges and cyclones. Although India still has low average incomes per person, the country is now the third largest emitter of greenhouse gas emissions after China and the USA. The central government has pledged to reduce the emission intensity of Gross Domestic Product by 20-25%, relative to 2005 levels, by 2020. India has also made major pledges to expand its renewable energy supply, enhance energy efficiency, build mass transit and other measures to reduce its emissions. There is evidence that many of these climate actions could generate substantial benefits in addition to reducing India's carbon footprint. Many low-carbon measures are economically attractive, including more efficient air conditioners, parking demand management, gasification and vehicle performance standards. Others offer social benefits: for example, Indian cities might see substantial improvements in air quality if the country were to promote renewable energy technologies instead of fossil fuels and walking/cycling/public transport instead of private vehicles.  Conservation  =Protected areas= In 2009, around 4.8 percent of the total area of the country were designated as protected areas. That comprised 100 national parks, 514 sanctuaries, 41 conservation reserves and four community reserves. =Policy and law= In the Directive Principles of State Policy, Article 48 says \\"the state shall endeavour to protect and improve the environment and to safeguard the forests and wildlife of the country\\"; Article 51-A states that \\"it shall be the duty of every citizen of India to protect and improve the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers and wildlife and to have compassion for living creatures.\\" India is one of the parties of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) treaty. Prior to the CBD, India had different laws to govern the environment. The Indian Wildlife Protection Act 1972 protected the biodiversity. In addition to this act, the government passed the Environment (Protection) Act 1986 and Foreign Trade (Development and Regulation) Act 1992 for control of biodiversity. = Renewable energy = Renewable energy in India comes under the purview of the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy. India was the first country in the world to set up a ministry of non-conventional energy resources, in the early 1980s. Its cumulative grid interactive or grid tied renewable energy capacity (excluding large hydro) has reached 33.8 GW, of which 66% comes from wind, while solar power contributes 4.59% along with biomass and hydro power.  Environmentalism  In 1973, the government launched Project Tiger, a conservation program aimed at protecting the national animal, the tiger. Its population reached as low as 2000 in 1970. Human population growth, cultivation of forest land and mainly hunting were the key factors for this decline. Aided by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), Indian conservationists were instrumental in getting the government to ban hunting and set aside national parks. Project Tiger further served as a model for protecting endangered species like the Indian elephant and rhinoceros. Around that year, after a protest in a village by the locals against loggers sent by a company, by threatening to hug the trees, similar protests got triggered, collectively known as the Chipko Movement. In the same year, the National Committee for Environmental Protection and Control was formed; in 1980, a department for Environment and finally five years later the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change was formed. The environmentalist movement in India began with these incidents. Historian Ramachandra Guha calls Medha Patkar as \\"the most celebrated environmental activist in contemporary India\\". New age India is concerned about the air and water quality, several civil society groups such as Environmentalist Foundation of India have forged a successful community based conservation model to revive lakes across the country. Organisations The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change through its Department of Environment and the particular state forest departments plan and implement environmental policy in each state. Some national-level environmental organisations (governmental and non-governmental) include: * Advisory Board on Energy (ABE) * Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) * Central Forestry Commission (CFC) * Department of Non-Conventional Energy Sources (DNES) * Environmentalist Foundation of India (E.F.I) * Industrial Toxicology Research Centre (ITRC) * National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) * National Dairy Development Board * National Natural Resources Management System * National Wetland Management Committee * State Pollution Control Boards (SPCB) * Tata Energy Research Institute (TERI) * Central Soil Salinity Research Institute There are at least 85 widely diversified environmental organisations involved with environmental conservation and environmental education in Tamil Nadu.

Issues Indonesia's large and growing population and rapid industrialisation present serious environmental issues, which are often given a lower priority due to high poverty levels and weak, under-resourced governance. Issues include large-scale deforestation (much of it illegal) and related wildfires causing heavy smog over parts of western Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore; over-exploitation of marine resources; and environmental problems associated with rapid urbanisation and economic development, including air pollution, traffic congestion, garbage management, and reliable water and waste water services. Deforestation and the destruction of peatlands make Indonesia the world's third largest emitter of greenhouse gases. Habitat destruction threatens the survival of indigenous and endemic species, including 140 species of mammals identified by the World Conservation Union (IUCN) as threatened, and 15 identified as critically endangered, including the Sumatran Orangutan. Indonesia has a below average but slightly improving performance in the global Environmental Performance Index (EPI) with an overall ranking of 107 out of 180 countries in 2016. This is also below average in the Asia Pacific region, behind Thailand but slightly ahead of China. The EPI was established in 2001 by the World Economic Forum as a global gauge to measure how well individual countries perform in implementing the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. The environmental areas where Indonesia performs worst (ie. highest ranking) are water resource management (128), environmental effects of fisheries (127) and forest management (109), followed closely by sanitation. Waste water treatment plans are expected to improve conditions a bit in the future. Indonesia performs best (ie. lowest ranking) in the area of climate and energy (41), mostly due to the excellent access to electricity, less so for CO2 emission levels from power production. Health impacts of environmental issues (78) and biodiversity and habitat (83) also ranks above average.EPI (2016): Indonesia = Climate Change = Indonesia is at serious risk from the projected effects of climate change. If emissions go unreduced, it is predicted that it will see an average temperature rise of around 1‚ÑÉ by the middle of the century, 0.3‚ÑÉ per decade.Case, M., Ardiansyah, F., Spector, E.

Rising temperatures risk increasing the frequency and severity of draught and food shortages, as it will have (and already has already had) a serious impact on precipitation and the patterns of wet and dry seasons upon which the Indonesian agricultural system is based. It will also encourage diseases, such as dengue fever and malaria, and increases in wild-fires, which threaten the huge areas of rainforest in the country. Climate change is having and will have further serious impact in the form of rising sea levels. As Indonesia is the world‚Äôs largest archipelago state, at current rates, rising sea levels will result in 42 million Indonesian households over 2000 islands being at risk of submersion by the middle of this century. Over 60% of Indonesia‚Äôs population live in low-lying coastal areas, including Jakarta, which is particularly at risk, as 40% of the city is below sea-level and is rapidly subsiding, putting a huge number of people at risk of displacement.

Kenya and the United States have long been close allies and have enjoyed cordial relations since Kenya's independence. Relations became even closer after Kenya's democratic transition of 2002 and subsequent improvements in human rights. This was preceded by sometimes frosty interludes during President Moi's regime when the two countries often clashed over bad governance issues, resulting in aid suspension and many diplomatic rows. Following the election of the new government of Uhuru Kenyatta in 2013, relations somewhat took a dip when the new president forged a new foreign policy looking east away from traditional western allies. Kenya‚ÄìUnited States relations have been cemented through cooperation against Islamist terrorism and a visit by President Obama to Kenya, which is the homeland of his father. Kenya's athletic mastery of some auspicious American events such as the Boston Marathon and New York Marathon have increased ordinary Americans' consciousness of Kenya paving the way for a warm mutual regard between the two peoples. An attack on Kenya by Al-Qaeda in 1998 as well as subsequent more attacks by Al-Shabaab, has drawn the two countries politically closer due to the shared fate the U.S. has had of similar targeting in the horrific September 11 attacks by Al-Qaeda in Lower Manhattan and The Pentagon. Kenya is one of the most pro-American nations in Africa and the world, seemingly more so than the U.S. itself. According to the Pew Research Global Attitudes Project, 87% of Kenyans view the U.S. favorably in 2007, decreasing slightly down to 83% in 2011 and 81% viewing the U.S. favorably in 2013.Opinion of the United States and according to the 2012 U.S. Global Leadership Report, 68% of Kenyans approve of U.S. leadership, with 14% disapproving and 18% uncertain.U.S. Global Leadership Project Report - 2012 Gallup In a 2013 BBC World Service poll, 69% of Kenyans view U.S. influence positively, with only 11% viewing U.S. influence negatively.Country Ratings - 2013 BBC Poll History = Independence = After Kenya's independence on December 12, 1963, the United States immediately recognized the new nation. However, it was not until March 2, 1964 that diplomatic relations were established with William Atwood establishing the U.S. Embassy at Nairobi. The United States also provided the fledgling nation with $21 million in funds and technical aid, with Kenya seeking more loans from the United States. The United States soon found itself invested in Kenyan politics due to the power struggle between Tom Mboya and Jaramogi Oginga Odinga. The United States had been impressed by Mboya since the 1950s, and sought to empower him in the new administration instead of the more leftist Odinga. The United States was successful, and Mboya began wooing Kenya's prime minister Jomo Kenyatta into becoming more favorable with the United States and the CIA. = Cold War = After Odinga's fall from power, Kenya found itself squarely in the Western bloc during the Cold War period. The fact that Soviet ideals never gained traction in post-independence Kenya meant that there was little to no jockeying between the United States and the U.S.S.R. in this region. This meant there was little need for Kenya and United States relations, since the United States took Kenyan support for granted. However, the 1980s saw Kenya become more involved in Cold War politics. After Jomo Kenyatta's death, the new president of Kenya Daniel arap Moi sought to further strengthen relations with the United States Moi joined the United States' Rapid Deployment Joint Task Force, allowing for the construction of United States military installations in Kenya. The most notable development of this military construction was allowing United States naval access to Mombasa, which resulted in the United States paying Kenya $26 million. = Democratization Era = Good relations, however, fell into jeopardy with the deteriorating civil rights picture in Kenya. In 1987, the chairman of the Congress subcommittee on Africa, Michigan congressman Howard Wolpe, accused Daniel arap Moi of bankrolling criminals and committing human rights abuses. The issue was then placed on the agenda for Ronald Reagan's talks with Moi, but nothing came of it at this time. In 1991, however, the United States joined with a coalition of other nations who gave financial assistance to Kenya to pressure for reforms. In a 1991 meeting in Paris, Kenya's aid donors insisted on ending corruption and human rights abuses, threatening to pull their aid. These concerns caused the United States to suspend its aid in 1992. Even when United States pressure forced multiparty elections in 1992, relations were tense all throughout the 1990s due to international discontent with the tactics of the Moi regime. The United States reacted positively to the Kenyan elections of 2000, the first democratic transition of power in Kenya's history. The new president, Mwai Kibaki was honored as the first African head of state to be invited to Washington D.C. for a state visit. = War on Terror = On August 7, 1998, al Qaeda terrorists detonated a car bomb outside the United States embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, leaving 200 dead and thousands wounded. The immediate aftermath strained relations between the United States and Kenya, as Kenyans felt that the United States only cared about the Americans who lost their lives, not the Kenyans. The situation was worsened when the American ambassador, Prudence Bushnell, implied that Kenyans were attempting to loot the embassy. However, since that event, the Kenyan and U.S. governments have intensified cooperation to address all forms of insecurity in Kenya, including terrorism. The United States provides equipment and training to Kenyan security forces, both civilian and military. In its dialog with the Kenyan Government, the United States urges effective action against corruption and insecurity as the two greatest impediments to Kenya achieving sustained, rapid economic growth. Families and victims of the attack have severally appealed to the Kenyan government to petition the U.S. government to compensate them. A Kenyan journalist who resides in the U.S. has on several occasions castigated the U.S. government for its nonchalant approach to the issue. In an article titled \\"The Big Bloody Burden of The Big Brother\\" published by the Daily Nation, one of the two mainstream Kenyan Newspapers, the writer, Ben Mutua Jonathan Muriithi wondered why \\"the Obama administration and others before it had turned a blind eye yet it was clear that Kenya had suffered as a Collateral damage\\". Following the September 11th attacks, Kenya was designated as a frontline in the United States' Global War on Terror. Kenya's National Security Intelligence Service (NSIS) received a list of two hundred suspects linked to Al-Qaeda in late September 2001. Following Al-Qaeda attacks in Mombasa in 2002, new president Mwai Kibaki created the Anti-Terrorism Police Unit to further counter-terror operations. The United States Anti-Terrorism Assistance Program provided training to 500 Kenyan security officers in the United States and many more in East Africa training locations. The United States also sunk large amounts of money into non-governmental organizations (NGOs) operating in Kenya. This was part of an overall emphasis placed on international NGOs during the War on Terror that saw United States funding to NGOs increase by billions. However, this particularly affected Kenya due to the high quantity of aid the United States sends to Kenya. This period also saw a \\"blurring of lines\\" in regards to NGOs, as it became more common for NGOs in Kenya to work with military officials in the United States Department of Defense. Even as Kibaki cooperated, relations suffered due to the United States' perceived \\"obsession\\" with the War on Terror and concerns that alignment with the United States led to domestic terrorism. Kenyan policymakers feared that while the United States had encouraged democratization, they ceased to encourage democracy during the War on Terror. Furthermore, some international organizations have raised concerns that American policy is pushing Kenya to discriminate against its Muslim population. Another key aspect of the War on Terror was that American aid to Kenya became even more politicized and \\"securitized.\\" During this period, The United States heavily tied USAID support directly to military and counterterror operations undertaken by the Kenyan Defense Forces. The United States also demonstrated a willingness to play hardball, sometimes threatening to cut aid if Kenya does not support United States foreign policy on the international level. Nonetheless, Kenya continues to back counter-terror operations in exchange for financial support. = Modern Era = The United States became a talking point during Kenya's 2007 elections, as some believed they were supporting Raila Odinga as retaliation for Kibaki reducing Kenyan dependence on the United States. Following the violence caused by Kenya's 2007 elections, the United States and other Western nations pressured Kenya to create tribunals to punish those responsible for the violence. The United States initially threatened to pull its aid unless the violence was addressed, but political will for such a step waned throughout the year. The tribunals were never established, but the United States was satisfied by the peaceful elections in 2013. The election of Barack Obama in 2008 was greeted with great optimism from Kenya, who felt pride in him due to his Kenyan father. His Africa policy was based on four pillars‚Äîpromoting democracy, managing conflicts, strengthening the economy, and providing access to education. That said, he also continued many of President George W. Bush's policies, particularly in counterterrorism. President Obama was also the first sitting president to visit Kenya. The election of Barack Obama also brought back international discourse regarding Kenya's Mau Mau uprising, as Obama's father had been interned by the British for his Mau Mau alignment. While this was a non-issue in Kenya, it put some domestic pressure on Obama to distance himself from his Kenyan heritage. However, Barack Obama has always been explicit that Kenya should expect no favors from him due to his heritage. Despite concerns regarding favoritism, the Obama administration did not take a more active role in Kenyan politics like some expected. The Obama era also saw U.S. assistance to Kenya grew \\"exponentially,\\" as the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) put in a 2012 document. The number of USAID projects had grown significantly enough for the agency to justify hiring additional contractors to help it manage its Kenyan program portfolio. A Statement of Work for the support initiative acknowledged that \\"the level of U.S.-financed Kenyan operations has outpaced Washington's ability to adequately manage it.\\" Additionally, USAID has faced academic criticism for backing projects that mostly benefit the rich of the Kenya. The 2013 elections in Kenya brought controversy due to the words of the United States Assistant Secretary of State at the time, Johnnie Carson. While not endorsing a candidate, he stated that \\"actions have consequences,\\" implying opposition to the challenger, Uhuru Kenyatta. The Kenyatta presidency was notably cold towards the United States prior to the terrorist attack on Kenya's Westgate mall. The terrorist attack led to more cooperation, as Kenya focused more on counterterror operations. The 2016 election of President Donald Trump did not bring similar enthusiasm to Kenyans. He also stirred controversy by referring to Kenya as a \\"s**thole\\" country. Despite that, it was found that Kenyans have much more confidence in President Trump than most of the world, likely due to Kenya's overall pro- American views. Trump has met with the sitting Kenyan president, Uhuru Kenyatta, to discuss trade and security. Recent issues Early in 2013, the Obama Administration via the U.S. Agency for International Development issued a Request for Proposals seeking contractor assistance in encouraging peace between warring tribes and cattle-raiders in and around Kenya. The PEACE III initiative proposes, among other approaches, to arrange \\"reflective workshops\\" among groups in conflict primarily along Kenyan border regions, where such groups would share \\"trauma stories\\" as a means of reconsidering who is a \\"victim\\" and who is a \\"perpetrator.\\" According to U.S. Trade & Aid Monitor, the administration \\"acknowledges that chronic cattle rustling and other cultural practices ‚Äì such as killing rivals ‚Äúto prove their manhood or impress young women‚Äù ‚Äì serve as impediments to progress.\\" Visits Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visited Nairobi in 2009 and 2012.

Native or endemic species of the Korean Peninsula include Korean hare, Korean water deer, Korean field mouse, Korean brown frog, Korean pine and Korean spruce. The Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) with its forest and natural wetlands is a unique biodiversity spot, which harbours eighty two endangered species such as the red-crowned crane and the Amur leopard. Overall, DMZ is home to about 70 mammalian species, more than 300 birds and about 3,000 plants. At the same time the populations of bears, lynxes, tigers, panthers and leopards, which once inhabited the Korean Peninsula, are presently very rare. The local wildlife sustained some damage during the Japanese occupation in 1910‚Äì1945 and subsequent Korean War, particularly due to overhunting of tigers. Regional differences =North Korea= While North Korea was once flourishing with forests, the environment of the country took a serious hit first in the Korean War, when numerous forests were burnt down. It took another blow in the 1990s, when a few natural disasters swept the country. Wanting to rectify the problem, the North Korean government has since started planting trees on a regular basis. =South Korea= The national flower of South Korea is the Hibiscus syriacus, a species of hibiscus that blooms continually from July through October.

In industrial applications the liquid and vapor streams can have co-current or countercurrent flows. Stripping is usually carried out in either a packed or trayed column.  Theory  Stripping works on the basis of mass transfer. The idea is to make the conditions favorable for the component, A, in the liquid phase to transfer to the vapor phase. This involves a gas‚Äìliquid interface that A must cross. The total amount of A that has moved across this boundary can be defined as the flux of A, NA.  Equipment  An example of a bubble cap tray that could be found inside of a stripping column. Stripping is mainly conducted in trayed towers (plate columns) and packed columns, and less often in spray towers, bubble columns, and centrifugal contactors. Trayed towers consist of a vertical column with liquid flowing in the top and out the bottom. The vapor phase enters in the bottom of the column and exits out of the top. Inside of the column are trays or plates. These trays force the liquid to flow back and forth horizontally while the vapor bubbles up through holes in the trays. The purpose of these trays is to increase the amount of contact area between the liquid and vapor phases. Packed columns are similar to trayed columns in that the liquid and vapor flows enter and exit in the same manner. The difference is that in packed towers there are no trays. Instead, packing is used to increase the contact area between the liquid and vapor phases. There are many different types of packing used and each one has advantages and disadvantages.  Variables  The variables and design considerations for strippers are many. Among them are the entering conditions, the degree of recovery of the solute needed, the choice of the stripping agent and its flow, the operating conditions, the number of stages, the heat effects, and the type and size of the equipment. The degree of recovery is often determined by environmental regulations, such as for volatile organic compounds like chloroform. Frequently, steam, air, inert gases, and hydrocarbon gases are used as stripping agents. This is based on solubility, stability, degree of corrosiveness, and availability. As stripping agents are gases, operation at nearly the highest temperature and lowest pressure that will maintain the components and not vaporize the liquid feed stream is desired. This allows for the minimization of flow. As with all other variables, minimizing cost while achieving efficient separation is the ultimate goal. The size of the equipment, and particularly the height and diameter, is important in determining the possibility of flow channeling that would reduce the contact area between the liquid and vapor streams. If flow channeling is suspected to be occurring, a redistribution plate is often necessary to, as the name indicates, redistribute the liquid flow evenly to reestablish a higher contact area. As mentioned previously, strippers can be trayed or packed. Packed columns, and particularly when random packing is used, are usually favored for smaller columns with a diameter less than 2 feet and a packed height of not more than 20 feet. Packed columns can also be advantageous for corrosive fluids, high foaming fluids, when fluid velocity is high, and when particularly low pressure drop is desired. Trayed strippers are advantageous because of ease of design and scale up. Structured packing can be used similar to trays despite possibly being the same material as dumped (random) packing. Using structured packing is a common method to increase the capacity for separation or to replace damaged trays. Plastic Bia≈Çecki rings Trayed strippers can have sieve, valve, or bubble cap trays while packed strippers can have either structured packing or random packing. Trays and packing are used to increase the contact area over which mass transfer can occur as mass transfer theory dictates. Packing can have varying material, surface area, flow area, and associated pressure drop. Older generation packing include ceramic Raschig rings and Berl saddles. More common packing materials are metal and plastic Pall rings, metal and plastic Zbigniew Bia≈Çecki rings,http://tech.money.pl/przemysl/patenty/pl-101135-424118.html Bia≈Çecki ring. Polish Patent 101135 (1976) and ceramic Intalox saddles. Each packing material of this newer generation improves the surface area, the flow area, and/or the associated pressure drop across the packing. Also important, is the ability of the packing material to not stack on top of itself. If such stacking occurs, it drastically reduces the surface area of the material. Lattice design work has been increasing of late that will further improve these characteristics. During operation, monitoring the pressure drop across the column can help to determine the performance of the stripper. A changed pressure drop over a significant range of time can be an indication that the packing may need to be replaced or cleaned.  Typical applications  Stripping is commonly used in industrial applications to remove harmful contaminants from waste streams. One example would be the removal of TBT and PAH contaminants from harbor soils.The Steam Stripping Process: A Remediation Technique for TBT- and PAH-Contaminated Dredged Sediments and Soils, by A. Eschenbach et al. The soils are dredged from the bottom of contaminated harbors, mixed with water to make a slurry and then stripped with steam. The cleaned soil and contaminant rich steam mixture are then separated. This process is able to decontaminate soils almost completely. Steam is also frequently used as a stripping agent for water treatment. Volatile organic compounds are partially soluble in water and because of environmental considerations and regulations, must be removed from groundwater, surface water, and wastewater. These compounds can be present because of industrial, agricultural, and commercial activity.

Biota Climate Geography Water Climate change Pollution Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into the natural environment that cause adverse change. Pollution can take the form of chemical substances or energy, such as noise, heat or light. Pollutants, the components of pollution, can be either foreign substances/energies or naturally occurring contaminants. Pollution is often classed as point source or nonpoint source pollution. =Coast Pollution= Pakistan's coastline, which stretches over 1,046 km, is facing severe pollution due to a combination of industrial, port, municipal, and transportation activities in the area. The coastline is being overwhelmed with water-borne pollution being discharged in the shipping process into the marine environment. A recent study found that some of the marine life was contaminated with lead, which if consumed by humans through seafood, has been linked to anemia, kidney failure and brain damage. In fact, the study also discovered that even the mangrove forests protecting the feeder creeks from sea erosion as well as a source of sustenance for fishermen are threatened by this pollution.The Karachi Coastline Case =Air pollution= The Air pollution is the release of chemicals and particulates into the atmosphere. Common gaseous pollutants include carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and nitrogen oxides produced by industry and motor vehicles. Photochemical ozone and smog are created as nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons react to sunlight. Particulate matter, or fine dust is characterized by their micrometre size PM10 to PM2.5. The air in Karachi is rapidly polluted by automobile smoke, especially Rickshaws and Buses, industrial emissions, open burning of garbage, house fires, and other particles but the government and environment organizations seems non-serious to tackle the issue timely. Rickshaws The two-stroke engines on rickshaws and motorcycles are one of the major polluters of air in Karachi and the rest of Pakistan. The two-stroke engines as well as defective or unturned vehicles are major polluters with carbon dioxide emissions. Two-stroke engines as well as defective vehicles using substandard lubricant are major emitters of sulfur dioxide and smoke. Automobiles operating on compressed natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas are major air polluters.Rising air pollution badly affecting Karachiites =Light pollution= The Light pollution includes light trespass, over-illumination and astronomical interference. =Littering= Littering is the criminal throwing of inappropriate man-made objects, unremoved, onto public and private properties. =Noise pollution= Noise pollution which encompasses roadway noise, aircraft noise, industrial noise as well as high-intensity sonar. The noise for Karachi came to 80 dB (A), the General Noise Index x (G.N.I.) to 460, and the noise pollution level (N.P.L.) to 99 dB (A). These values are significantly higher (P less than 0.01) than the available international data. =Soil contamination= Soil contamination occurs when chemicals are released by spill or underground leakage. Among the most significant soil contaminants are hydrocarbons, heavy metals, MTBE,Concerns about MTBE from U.S. EPA website herbicides, pesticides and chlorinated hydrocarbons. =Radioactive contamination= Radioactive contamination resulting from 20th century activities in atomic physics, such as nuclear power generation and nuclear weapons research, manufacture and deployment. (See alpha emitters and actinides in the environment) =Thermal pollution= Thermal pollution is a temperature change in natural water bodies caused by human influence, such as use of water as coolant in a power plant. =Visual pollution= Visual pollution, which can refer to the presence of overhead power lines, motorway billboards, scarred landforms (as from strip mining), open storage of trash, municipal solid waste or space debris. =Water pollution= Water pollution id by the discharge of wastewater from commercial and industrial waste (intentionally or through spills) into surface waters; discharges of untreated domestic sewage, and chemical contaminants, such as chlorine, from treated sewage; release of waste and contaminants into surface runoff flowing to surface waters (including urban runoff and agricultural runoff, which may contain chemical fertilizers and pesticides); waste disposal and leaching into groundwater; eutrophication and littering. Tanning Pakistan exports Leather product using Leather production processes including tanning. In addition to the other environmental impacts of leather, the production processes have a high environmental impact, most notably due to: * the heavy use of polluting chemicals in the tanning process * air pollution due to the transformation process (hydrogen sulfide during dehairing and ammonia during deliming, solvent vapours). One tonne of hide or skin generally leads to the production of 20 to 80 m3 of turbid and foul- smelling wastewater, including chromium levels of 100‚Äì400 mg/L, sulfide levels of 200‚Äì800 mg/L and high levels of fat and other solid wastes, as well as notable pathogen contamination. Pesticides are also often added for hide conservation during transport. With solid wastes representing up to 70% of the wet weight of the original hides, the tanning process comes at a considerable strain on water treatment installations. Climate most part of Pakistan lies in arid to semi arid zone of climate but there is a lot of variation observed in Pakistan due to the variation of relief features from lofty mountains to low-lying area mostly climate of Pakistan is divided into four major climatic zones 1 High land climate zone (include all the mountain regions of Pakistan western and northern mountain) 2 low land climatic zone (include all the plain areas of Pakistan which include whole of Indus plain except Indus delta) 3 arid climate zone ( this zone include all the south eastern deserts like Cholistan, Nara and Tharparker ) 4 coastal climate zone ( include whole of coastal stripe from Makran coast to Karachi coast and Sindh coastal areas of Pakistan) Geography Water Energy Protected areas Environmental policy Environmental affairs in Pakistan are managed and regulated by the Ministry of Environment (Pakistan), headed by the Minister for Environment (Pakistan).

Life =Early life= Born in Paris, France, he received his education at Choate Rosemary Hall and Princeton University, editing The Daily Princetonian and later serving as a Princeton trustee. He served as a paratrooper in World War II. After the war, Attwood wrote for the New York Herald Tribune and soon was transferred to the Paris bureau of the international edition. His first book, The Man Who Could Grow Hair, or Inside Andorra, was a memoir-based series of tales of his adventures in post-war Europe. Attwood married Simone Cadgene in Paris in 1950 and the couple eventually had three children, Peter, Janet, and Susan. He published a memoir of their impressions of the changes in America upon returning, titled Still the Most Exciting Country. =Speechwriting= Adlai Stevenson enlisted Attwood to serve as a speechwriter and advisor in both of his presidential campaigns, in 1952 and 1956, and to write other speeches in 1960.Time, Be Prepared. When John F. Kennedy became the 1960 Democratic nominee, Attwood joined the Kennedy campaign. Stevenson and Attwood were close friends and collaborators for years. Attwood accompanied Stevenson on a trip around the world sponsored by Look magazine, writing the regular articles about Stevenson's travels that appeared in that magazine. =Diplomat= Early in his presidency, President Kennedy appointed Attwood to serve as Ambassador to the West African country of Guinea. He was forced to return to the States after a near fatal case of polio (which gave him a permanent limp), but recovered and returned to Guinea for a time. In 1963, the Kennedy administration desired to negotiate d√©tente with Fidel Castro and to negotiate the beginning of normalized relations after the 1964 campaign. Attwood claimed he served as a secret liaison and was due to report to the president when Kennedy returned from the trip to Dallas during which he was assassinated; and that the Johnson administration discontinued this effort.William H. Attwood, recorded statement, November 8, 1965, John F. Kennedy Library Oral History Program. Attwood served a second appointment as ambassador during the Johnson administration, to Kenya. He published a book about the relationship of Kenyan politics and communism, The Reds and the Blacks. =Later life= Attwood had long worked with Cowles Communications, mostly in various editorial roles at Look. In 1970, he became editor of Newsday, the Long Island daily newspaper. He started Newsday's New York edition. Upon retirement in 1979, Attwood focused on writing, and serving the Town Council in his hometown of New Canaan, Connecticut. After covering the Geneva Summit between Reagan and Gorbachev in 1987, Attwood published his final book, The Twilight Struggle: Tales of the Cold War, which chronicled his unique view of the Cold War from its beginning to its presumable end. Attwood died from congestive heart failure in New Canaan on April 15, 1989. Memory The Public Library in Attwood's hometown of New Canaan annually hosts the Attwood Memorial Lecture, which features speakers who reflect his own passions for the intersection of journalism and politics.

He was best known for his depiction of the titular hero of Frances Hodgson Burnett's 1886 novel Little Lord Fauntleroy, which started a craze in juvenile fashion. While his illustrated corpus has eclipsed his other work, he was also an accomplished painter of portraits and landscapes. Life and family Birch was born May 2, 1856 in London, England, the son of British army officer William Alexander Birch and Isabella (Hoggins) Birch. During his childhood he lived for a time with his paternal grandfather on the Isle of Jersey while his father was in India. He moved to San Francisco, California with his parents in 1870. Afterward he was naturalized as a citizen of the United States. Birch married twice and had two children, a son and a daughter. The son, Rodney Bathurst Birch, was an early film actor. Birch died at the age of eighty-seven of congestive heart failure at the Home for Incurables in the Bronx, New York. His body was interred at Woodlawn Cemetery in New York. Career Birch's artistic talent first emerged in San Francisco, where he helped his father prepare wood-block theatrical posters. He soon attracted a patron in painter Toby Edward Rosenthal, who allowed him to use his studio and helped further his artistic education. From 1873 to 1881 Birch studied and worked in Europe, attending the Royal Academy in Munich and illustrating various publications in Vienna, Paris, and Rome. On his return to the United States he took up residence in New York City, where he became a magazine illustrator. His work appeared in St. Nicholas, the Century, Harper's, Life, and The Youth's Companion, among other publications. He also became a founding member of the Society of Illustrators in New York. His first great success was his illustration of Frances Hodgson Burnett's children's book Little Lord Fauntleroy (1886), whose young protagonist's long, curly hair and velvet and lace suit were widely imitated by mothers as a pattern of dress for their little boys. Birch's name was indelibly associated with Burnett's protagonist forever after, rather to the illustrator's irritation. During the period of his initial popularity he illustrated over forty books, many of which, along with his drawings, had initially seen publication in serial form. These included more of Burnett's children's books, notably Sara Crewe (1888). Demand for Birch's work faded after 1914, and by the 1930s he was living in poverty. His career was revived in 1933 by his illustrations for Louis Untermeyer's The Last Pirate, and he went on to illustrate about twenty additional books before being retired by failing eyesight about 1941. Reginald Birch‚ÄîHis Book, a retrospective collection of works he illustrated by various authors, was published in 1939 by Harcourt, Brace and Company.

The submarines had a length of overall, a beam of and a mean draft of . They displaced on the surface and submerged. The G-class submarines had a crew of 30 officers and other ranks. They had a partial double hull.Gardiner & Gray, p. 90 For surface running, the boats were powered by two Vickers two-stroke diesel engines, each driving one propeller shaft. When submerged each propeller was driven by a electric motor. They could reach on the surface and underwater. On the surface, the G class had a range of at . The boats were intended to be armed with one 21-inch (53.3 cm) torpedo tube in the bow and two 18-inch (45 cm) torpedo tubes on the beam. This was revised, however, while they were under construction, the 21-inch tube was moved to the stern and two additional 18-inch tubes were added in the bow. They carried two 21-inch and eight 18-inch torpedoes. The G-class submarines were also armed with a single deck gun. War service Like the rest of her class, G13s role was to patrol an area of the North Sea in search of German U-boats. On 10 March 1917 G13 torpedoed and sank the German submarine UC-43 off the Shetland Islands, about NW of Muckle Flugga Lighthouse. Lieutenant Commander George Fagan Bradshaw was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his command in this action. G13 survived the war and was sold for scrap in 1923.

SSCL Today Mission Control area for HABET Flights In 2007 the SSOL was changed to the Space Systems and Controls Lab as new leadership took over, and to reflect some of the changes the lab had undergone. The SSCL continues with a focus in space systems and has expanded to several new areas. The SSCL still has a strong emphasis in student involvement both with projects and with leadership in the lab. Presently the lab has 4 core projects, two active research projects, several capstone projects and well over 50 students involved from Electrical, Aerospace, and Mechanical Engineering as well as students outside the College of Engineering. The lab is managed by Matthew Nelson, staff within the Aerospace Engineering department and is the Director of Engineering and Operations for the lab. Funding for the lab is from the Aerospace Engineering department, research grants and private donations. SSCL Projects The SSCL has several core projects that are ongoing from year to year. In addition to these projects, the SSCL has had numerous capstone and independent projects led by students in the lab. HABET The longest running project at the SSCL is the High Altitude Balloon Experiments in Technology (HABET) program. This program has enabled students to design, build and fly spacecraft to the edge of our atmosphere and back to earth. The HABET team has flown experiments that have included micro gravity, the sending of worms, collection of atmospheric data, high quality images and videos and countless other experiments. To date, the HABET team has flown over 130 flights, has obtained an altitude record of 121,793 feet (ASL), has flown payloads up to 50 lbs, and has pushed the envelope in developing new techniques and hardware for High Altitude Balloons. HABET History HABET Flight Stack The following is an excerpt from Ralph Wallio on the beginnings of the HABET program in the SSCL: > HABET was started by the Central Iowa Technical Society (CITS) an Amateur > Radio organization. CITS launched four HABET flights, HABET-1 through > HABET-4, 1993‚Äì1994, from the rural home of Ralph Wallio, W0RPK, in north > central Warren County.

In September 1994, an opportunity to fly an experiment aboard the space shuttle was presented. One of the original experiments for the ISAT project, was incorporated into a design to be flown aboard the space shuttle in a project called the Iowa Joint Experiment in Microgravity Solidification (IJEMS). The project involved many institutions, including Iowa State University (ISU), the University of Iowa, the Ames Laboratory, the Institute for Physical Research and Technology, Rockwell International, and Space Industries Incorporated. In September 1995, the project was successfully flown on board STS-69.

As of 2013, there were 5,115 international students of Kuwaiti origin studying in the United States, representing 0.6% of all foreigners pursuing higher education in America.TOP 25 PLACES OF ORIGIN OF INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS Institute of International Education History The United States opened a consulate in Kuwait in October 1951, which was elevated to embassy status at the time of Kuwait's independence 10 years later. The United States supports Kuwait's sovereignty, security and independence, as well as its multilateral diplomatic efforts to build greater cooperation among the GCC countries. Strategic cooperation between the United States and Kuwait increased in 1987 with the implementation of a maritime protection regime that ensured the freedom of navigation through the Persian Gulf for 11 Kuwaiti tankers that were reflagged with U.S. markings. The U.S.-Kuwaiti strategic partnership intensified dramatically again after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. The United States spearheaded United Nations Security Council demands that Iraq withdraw from Kuwait and its authorization of the use of force, if necessary, to remove Iraqi forces from the occupied country. The United States subsequently played a dominant role in the development of the multinational military Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm that liberated Kuwait. The U.S.-Kuwaiti relationship remained strong in the post-Gulf War period. Kuwait and the United States worked on a daily basis to monitor and to enforce Iraq's compliance with UN Security Council resolutions. Since Kuwait's liberation, the United States has provided military and defense technical assistance to Kuwait from both foreign military sales (FMS) and commercial sources. The U.S. Office of Military Cooperation in Kuwait is attached to the American embassy and manages the FMS program. There are currently over 100 open FMS contracts between the U.S. military and the Kuwait Ministry of Defense totaling $8.1 billion. Principal U.S. military systems currently purchased by the Kuwait Defense Forces are Patriot Missile systems, F-18 Hornet fighters, the M1A2 main battle tank, AH-64D Apache helicopter, and a major recapitalization of Kuwait's Navy with U.S. boats.

The United States is currently Kuwait's largest supplier of goods and services, and Kuwait is the fifth-largest market in the Middle East. U.S. exports to Kuwait totaled $2.14 billion in 2006. Provided their prices are reasonable, U.S. firms have a competitive advantage in many areas requiring advanced technology, such as oil field equipment and services, electric power generation and distribution equipment, telecommunications gear, consumer goods, and military equipment. Kuwait also is an important partner in the ongoing U.S.-led campaign against international terrorism, providing assistance in the military, diplomatic, and intelligence arenas and also supporting efforts to block financing of terrorist groups. In January 2005, Kuwait Security Services forces engaged in gun battles with local extremists, resulting in fatalities on both sides in the first such incident in Kuwait's history.

Performance The piece is a sextet intended in the baroque style, the two unfriendly groups of instruments being the three woodwinds ‚Äî flute, oboe and bassoon ‚Äî and the three brass; trumpet, french horn and trombone. The basic premise is that the woodwinds play the piece straightforwardly, while the brass instruments (who don't like the woodwinds and/or the conductor) do everything possible to pervert the work, including playing their echo atonally/arhythmically, playing in a carnival or ragtime style, ignoring their cue (even when repeated) and then playing \\"nanny nanny boo-boo\\" over the subsequent woodwind line, and dramatic ritardandos and rallentandos that cover the other group's parts. This understandably frustrates the woodwinds and the conductor. At the breaking point, the conductor and/or woodwind group pull out guns and point them at the brass section, whose broad, obnoxiously loud line trails off. The woodwinds play their final line, and the brass finally cooperate... until they refuse to play their final note, which is completed by the woodwinds. Recordings The piece appears in two albums, Report From Hoople: P. D. Q. Bach On The Air and Portrait of PDQ Bach.

History  The U.S. government provides humanitarian assistance, non-lethal military assistance, and assistance to support economic and political reforms. It also has supported the Kyrgyz Republic's requests for assistance from international organizations. For example, the United States helped the Kyrgyz Republic accede to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in December 1998. Following 9/11, the U.S. has increased its interest in this part of the world, leading to divisions in opinion and welcome. The US opened the Transit Center at Manas in December 2001 following the 9/11 incident. Both Russia and China were dismayed and in later years reportedly offered large bounties if Kyrgyzstan closed the base. In 2006, the President of Kyrgyzstan demanded further concessions to the agreement and in this year a US Air Force personnel officer was kidnapped (media later reported inconsistenties in this account; the USAF reconfirmed a kidnapping took place in 2012). 2006 also saw the killing of a Kyrgyz civilian wielding a knife by a US serviceman with a gun. Local Kyrgyz sentiment and media was outraged as the Kyrgyz region is plagued by lawlessness, banditry, and smuggling and the carrying or even threatening with a knife is relatively common in Kyrgyz street culture. For the Americans, still reeling and devastated from the 9/11 terrorist assault on their largest city, any forcible entry by a civilian into a military base can and is met with deadly force. The US military placed the serviceman under administrative punishment and an undisclosed financial settlement was made to the family. Secretary Kerry Meets With Kyrgyz President Atambaev in Bishkek, 2015 According to the 2012 U.S. Global Leadership Report, 34% of Kyrgyz people approve of U.S. leadership, with 43% disapproving and 23% uncertain.U.S. Global Leadership Project Report - 2012 Gallup In July 2015, the Kyrgyzstan Ministry of Foreign Affairs ceased a bilateral cooperation treaty signed by the two countries in 1993, amidst protests by the Kyrgyz foreign ministry over the U.S. Department of State's decision to award the 2014 Human Rights Defender Award to Kyrgyz prisoner Azimzhan Askarov, a journalist and political activist who was arrested for his contributions in the 2010 South Kyrgyzstan ethnic clashes. The U.S. has since warned Kyrgyzstan of the cancellation's consequences regarding the provision of humanitarian and security aid.

He is the son of actor David Niven and Primula Rollo.  Career  Niven was the head of the William Morris Agency in Europe, which he left for Columbia Pictures in 1970. His many clients included Robert Woods. He was managing director of Paramount Pictures England until 1975, when he turned his focus to film production. In 1976, he produced The Eagle Has Landed, and in 1979, he produced Escape to Athena, which starred his father. He was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award in 1985 as Executive Producer of The Night They Saved Christmas which he co-wrote with James C. Maloney. Niven was a regular on the 1990 edition of To Tell the Truth, which was hosted by Gordon Elliot making 14 appearances. During the 1990s he was the chair emeritus of the Recording Artists, Actors and Athletes against Drunk Driving (R.A.D.D) group in Hollywood, and founder of the bicycle safety group See a Child, Save a Child. In 2002 he successfully campaigned for a Child Safety Day and Week which was accepted by the City of Los Angeles. At a book launch by Jackie Collins in 1987, Niven was asked would if he would ever write a book about his life, to which he replied \\"But how can I when everything, everything, I have ever done, said or thought appears in Jackie‚Äôs novels.\\"‚ÄòThere‚Äôs nothing left,‚Äô he laments. ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know why the headings on some of the chapters shouldn‚Äôt be, ‚ÄòI‚Äôd like to dedicate this to‚Ä¶‚Äô ‚Äù Niven's acting credits include Rush Hour 3 and The Cool Surface. Away from film, Niven invested in the restaurant Drones, in Pont Street, London in 1972, which he recommended that it be called after Bertie Wooster's fictional club. At his request a picture of his father was positioned on the wall. The restaurant was later run by Marco Pierre White's restaurant group White Star Group. The location changed under new owners and closed in 2007. Personal life Noel Coward was Niven's godfather, and gave him a silver cocktail shaker with the inscription ‚ÄúBecause, my Godson dear, I rather / Think you‚Äôll turn out like your father.‚Äù Niven knew Jane and Peter Fonda, Mia Farrow, Nancy and Frank Sinatra Jr., and Candice Bergen growing up. Niven was married to actress and producer Barbara Niven from 1993 to their divorce in 1998. He had previously had a relationship with Natalie Wood during the 1960s. He married his second wife Beatrice Anne Reeve, daughter of Annette de la Renta in 2000, but divorced in 2005. In 2009 he sold his house on Sunset Boulevard for $5 million. In 1994 Niven and his brother Jamie gave the Online Archive of California their father's archive. In 2009 Michael Munn released a biography of his father, David Niven, by which Niven Jr. was horrified.

The Melungeon people are a mixed-race group who married within the group up until about 1900. There was speculation about their identity and ancestry for decades, and many differing accounts of their origins. This study was started in 2005. Researchers published an article in 2012 summarizing their results. The female ancestors were shown to have had European DNA, while male ancestors had DNA from African or European haplogroups. Only one male had a Native American haplogroup.  Background  The term \\"Melungeon\\" was used by others from the early 19th century to describe a group of people living in Hancock County, Tennessee, and nearby areas. It was originally a pejorative. Vardy Collins is considered the patriarch of the Melungeons. Author Roberta Estes states that the first mention of Melungeons was in an 1810 record, identifying them as \\"foreigners\\" or \\"Portuguese\\", rather than either Negro or Indian. Marriage between Whites, Blacks, and Native Americans (including free people of color) was prohibited or taboo in many parts of the Thirteen colonies from the mid-18th century onwards, but free mixed-race families were formed by white women and African or African-American men before the American Revolutionary War. As the women were free, their children were born free, under the laws of the colonies that said children were born into their mother's status, according to the principle of partus sequitur ventrem. In the mid-to-late 19th century, some Melungeons were living on the frontier and considered white by their neighbors and by the law. Some Melungeons served in the military, voted, and carried arms‚Äîall of which obligations and rights were reserved at the time for White male citizens. Following the 1831 Nat Turner slave rebellion, southern states such as North Carolina had reduced the rights they had formerly extended to free people of color and free blacks. While the Melungeon communities largely practiced endogamy until c. 1900, marrying among their neighbors and known cohort; since then, individuals identifying as Melungeon have increasingly been marrying into the general population of White Americans.  Project  = Project organization = Jack Goins, the project coordinator, is also the Hawkins County archivist. Of proven Melungeon ancestry, Goins has been researching the group for years and is the author of Melungeon and Other Pioneer Families and Melungeons Footprints From the Past. Additional project administrators have included Roberta Estes, Janet Crain, Penny Ferguson, and Kathy James. Estes founded 'DNA-explained' in 2004. = Participant identification = Melungeon researchers determined participants' genealogical suitability for inclusion in the study based on historical documentation; a number of surnames have been identified as associated with Melungeon families (see below). The project was initiated in 2005 and is on-going. Participants must descend in a direct paternal line for Y chromosome (Y-DNA) testing, or in a direct female line for Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) testing. = Study subjects = The project organizers designated the following as core families, based on historical documentation: ;Group 1: Core Melungeon > Bunch, Goins, Gibson, Minor, Collins, Williams, Goodman, Denham, Bowlin, > Mullins, Moore, Shumake, Boltons, Perkins, Mornings, Menleys, Breedlove, > Hopkins and Mallett; including name variations. ;Group 2: Melungeon Related. > If the above names are in the participant's family, but are not in a direct > line to enable Y-DNA or mtDNA testing, participants are placed in the > Melungeon Related group. More surnames may be added as this is an ongoing project.  Some initial results  Results of the Melungeon Core DNA Project were summarized in \\"Melungeons, A Multi-Ethnic Population\\", published in the Journal of Genetic Genealogy (April 2012).Roberta Estes et. al, \\"Melungeons: a Multi-Ethnic Population\\", Journal of Genetic Genealogy, April 2012 The few women tested all belonged to haplogroup H (predominantly found in Europe) in their direct female lines. There is no single mtDNA maternal line for all Melungeons tested.Note: Each woman's mtDNA line was passed down directly from her mother, maternal-grandmother, maternal-great-grandmother, and so on. All the mtDNA of subjects tested was found to be of European origin. Tested males belonged primarily to African and European haplogroups, with the majority (12 of 21) in the latter. One male showed descent from a Native American haplogroup.Note: Q1a3a1.Melungeon DNA project Y results, Melungeon DNA project Only one person in the project (from the Freeman line) tested as having Native American ancestry on the Y side. Eight lines were found to have African Y chromosome haplogroups, while 12 were European. Participant breakdown by haplogroup was as follows: R1b (38 people) 47.5% , E1b1a1-M2 (27 people) 33.75%, R1a (6 people) 7.5%, I1 (3 people) 3.75%, A (2 people) 2.5%, E1b1b1 (2 people) 2.5%, Q1a3a1 (1 person) 1.25%, I2 (1 person) 1.25%. The results-by-surnames-tested are not shown on the public website for the project.  Conclusions  There is no proof regarding the parentage of Vardy Collins, considered the patriarch of the Melungeons. Vardy Collins' DNA belonged to the R1a1a (European) haplogroup. His wife, Margaret Gibson, nicknamed \\"Spanish Peggy,\\" showed positive for maternal haplogroup H. Gibson is thought to be the daughter of Andrew Gibson (R1b1b2 group).\\"Roberta Estes, \\"Melungeons, A Multi-Ethnic Population\\", Journal of Genetic GenealogyThe Expedition of Batts and Fallam:A Journey from Virginia to beyond the Appalachian Mountains, September, 1671. From Annals of Southwest Virginia, 1769-1800, Annals of Southwest Virginia The DNA test shows the regional origin of the original ancestors of direct male or female lines, but not which culture their descendants may have identified with in succeeding years. Neither does it indicate how far back the admixture occurred.Note: In terms of overall group identity, an individual's ethnicity could be determined by relatives not in the direct line; for instance, an individual male could have had more than one generation of female ancestors who were from one culture, but his direct male line of descent may have been from another culture, with either culture dominating in the family group.

According to polling by the Pew Research Center, from 2002 to 2017, on average 44% of Lebanese people expressed a positive opinion of the United States (lowest in 2003 at 27%, highest in 2009 at 55%) while on average 55% expressed a negative opinion (highest in 2003 at 71%, lowest in 2009 at 45%).Pew Global Indicators Database.

However, nearly three- in-four Christians (72%) had a favorable view of the U.S.\\"Rosentiel, Tom. \\"Lebanon's Muslims.\\" Pew Research Center, Washington D.C. July 2006.  History  US Secretary of State John Kerry shakes hands with Lebanese Future Movement leader Saad Hariri in 2014 The United States sent diplomat George Wadsworth to Lebanon in October 1942 as an \\"Agent and Consul General\\" while Lebanon was still part of a French-ruled international mandate. The United States recognized Lebanon as an independent country on September 8, 1944. Formal relations were established on November 16, 1944, as Wadsworth presented his credentials as Envoy. The United States seeks to maintain its traditionally close ties with Lebanon, and to help preserve its independence, sovereignty, national unity, and territorial integrity. The United States, along with the international community, supports full implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1559, including the disarming of all militias and the deployment of the Lebanese Armed Forces throughout Lebanon. The United States believes that a peaceful, prosperous, and stable Lebanon can make an important contribution to comprehensive peace in the Middle East. One measure of U.S. concern and involvement has been a program of relief, rehabilitation, and recovery that from 1975 through 2005 totaled more than $400 million in aid to Lebanon. For relief, recovery, rebuilding, and security in the wake of the 2006 war, the U.S. government substantially stepped up this program, pledging well over $1 billion in additional assistance for the 2006 and 2007 fiscal years. This support reflects not only humanitarian concerns and historical ties but also the importance the United States attaches to sustainable development and the restoration of an independent, sovereign, unified Lebanon. Some of current funding is used to support the activities of U.S. and Lebanese private voluntary organizations engaged in rural and municipal development programs nationwide, improve the economic climate for global trade and investment, and enhance security and resettlement in south Lebanon. The U.S. also supports humanitarian demining and victims' assistance programs. Over the years, the United States also has assisted the American University of Beirut (AUB) and the Lebanese American University (LAU) with budget support and student scholarships. Assistance also has been provided to the American Community School at Beirut (ACS) and the International College (IC). In 1993, the U.S. resumed the International Military Education and Training program in Lebanon to help bolster the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF)‚Äîthe country's only nonsectarian national institution‚Äîand reinforce the importance of civilian control of the military. Sales of excess defense articles (EDA) resumed in 1991 and have allowed the LAF to enhance both its transportation and communications capabilities, which were severely degraded during the civil war. Security assistance to both the LAF and the Internal Security Forces (ISF) increased significantly after the 2006 war, in order to support the democratically elected Government of Lebanon as it carries out the requirements of UNSCR 1701 and asserts its sovereignty over the whole of Lebanese territory. On October 24, 2012, five days after the deadly car bombing in Beirut that killed Lebanese chief of intelligence Wissam Al-Hassan, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland announced that the American government will back the Lebanese political opposition coalition's call for a new cabinet free of Syrian influence as well as assist Lebanon in the investigation of the bombing. In early November 2018, the United States Treasury Department put four key members of Lebanon's Hezbollah on the list of Specially Designated Global Terrorists program. They included Yusuf Hashim, Adnan Hussein Kawtharani, and Muhammad 'Abd-Al-Hadi Farhat and also Shibl Muhsin 'Ubayd Al-Zaydi who was a link between Hezbollah, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and their supporters in Iraq.US Targets Hezbollah Iraq Network With New Sanctions In June 2019, the Trump Administration imposed sanctions on three senior Hezbollah officials in Lebanon, Wafiq Safa, Muhammad Hasan Ra'd, and Amin Sherri. These officials were added to the U.S. Treasury Department's sanctions list and were accused of having a \\"malign agenda\\" to support the Iranian government. Diplomacy The U.S. Embassy operates in Awkar, Lebanon. As of July 11, 2016, the ambassador is Elizabeth Richard. In September 1989, all American officials at the U.S. Embassy in Beirut were withdrawn, when safety and operation of the mission could not be guaranteed. A new U.S. Ambassador returned to Beirut in November 1990, and the Embassy has been continuously open since March 1991. In 1997, reflecting improvements in Lebanon's security climate, the United States lifted the ban it had imposed on American-citizen travel to Lebanon in 1985. The ban was replaced by a travel warning. Nonetheless, remaining security concerns continue to limit the size of the American staff and visitor access to the Embassy. American Citizen Services are available, and the Embassy resumed full nonimmigrant visa services in June 2003. However, relations between the two countries soured briefly following accusations of double standards owing to American aid to Israel against Hezbollah during the 2006 war.

He was the founder of Jesus Calls Ministries and Karunya University.  Early life  Dhinakaran was born on 1 July 1935 at SurandaiD. G. S. Dhinakaran Memorial Page in Tirunelveli district of Madras Presidency (today Tamil Nadu), British India. He attended St. John\`s college, Palayamkottai, and received a BSc degree in Mathematics from Madras University in 1955.  Ministry  Dhinakaran was involved in evangelical activities for some time prior to leaving his job at the bank in October 1962 to evangelise on a full-time basis.Dr.D.G.S.Dhinakaran, \`En Paraloka Tharisanankal\` (Tamil), / \`Heavenly Visions of D.G.S. Dhinakaran (English)\`, Jesus Calls Publication, Chennai, 2008, p. 20. He founded the Jesus Calls Ministries that, by the time of his death, had more than 20 bases in India and abroad and during his lifetime was the most influential and best-known of the Charismatic evangelists working in India. Allan Anderson, an academic specialising in studies of Pentecostalism, sees similarities between Dhinakaran's efforts and those of Oral Roberts in the US. One of the parallels with Roberts was Dhinakaran's involvement in the establishment of Karunya University, a Christian institution at which he served as the first Chancellor. He also played a significant role in the formation of Seesha, a voluntary body concerned with educating underprivileged children and with assisting rural people. Dhinakaran, who remained a member of the Church of South India, was among the first Indian Christian leaders to appreciate the potential of television as a medium for evangelism. In doing this he was following a pattern established in the US and challenging the conservative opinions of his peers, who associated television with the perceived moral laxities of the Indian cinema industry. He had been broadcasting his message on radio programmes since 1972, when he had used the FEBA network for that purpose, and the Jesus Calls Ministry began using television broadcasts in the mid-1990s. The broadcasting entity is now sizable and during his lifetime he was assisted in it by his son, Paul Dhinakaran, who subsequently took charge of the Ministry following Dhinakaran's death. The introduction of his son as co- anchor so soon after Roberts had adopted a similar course in the US was, according to Jonathan James, probably not a coincidence. Only a small proportion of the broadcast output was religious in nature and that used devices‚Äîsuch as addressing the audience in a mixture of speech and song - that may reflect the methodology of ancient Sanskrit theatre as well as modern Hindu priests. Cultural empathies with the audience were encouraged by predominant use of the local Tamil language rather than alternatives such as English and by recognising local traditions of oral storytelling. Following methods used in the US, which included building a massive prayer tower in Chennai and others throughout India, were not always appreciated. Dhinakaran presented his television shows wearing Western clothing and he used Western songs and music, as well as addressing his audience in a Western style rather than sitting on the ground as gurus did, all of which evoked some dis- satisfaction. He wrote more than 15 books and recorded many Christian musical albums.  Death  Dhinakaran died in hospital on 20 February 2008. He had been suffering from heart and kidney ailments. He was survived by his wife Stella, and his son, Paul.  References   Further reading     External links  * 1935 births 2008 deaths Indian Charismatics ","title":"D. G. S.

Canada In Canada, \\"Polar Bear Swims\\", \\"plunges\\" or \\"dips\\" are a New Year's Day tradition in numerous communities across the country.Watch The Rick Mercer Report segment on Polar Bear Dipping in Canada Vancouver, BC's annual Polar Bear Swim Club has been active since 1920 and typically has 1,000 to 2,000 registered participants, with a record 2,128 plunging into English Bay in 2000. Registration is not enforced and the actual number of swimmers may be significantly higher. Estimates of the number of observers are typically up to 10,000. Suburban White Rock, BC's was founded in 1958, and other suburbs including North Vancouver, Surrey, Delta and Langley also hold swims. Other locations include Bowen Island, BC, Edmonton, AB, Calgary, AB, Ottawa, ON, Oakville, ON, Toronto, ON, Perth, ON, Clarington, ON, Sarnia, ON, Montreal, QC, North Hatley, QC, Halifax, NS, Prince Edward Island, Ness Lake north of Prince George, BC and St. John's, NL. In Yellowknife, NWT, the \\"Freezin for a Reason\\" plunge is held in May after the spring thaw. Netherlands The Nieuwjaarsduik in Scheveningen (2010) Every New Year's Day around 10,000 people dive collectively into the icy cold sea water at Scheveningen, a Dutch beach resort town, since 1960. In 89 locations on beaches and in lakes all over the country, each year around 30,000 people participate in this \\"Nieuwjaarsduik\\" (English: New Year's dive), with a record 36,000 participants on January 1, 2012. Since 1998, Unox, a Unilever food brand often associated with winter, adopted the Nieuwjaarsduik and ever since it is tradition to wear Unox branded winter caps and gloves. New Zealand Polar plunges (the local name) are held at various beaches in New Zealand, usually on the weekend closest to the shortest day in late June. Among other places, polar plunges are led at Papamoa Beach (Tauranga), Saint Clair Beach (Dunedin), and Castlecliff (Wanganui). United Kingdom Christmas Day swim at Exmouth In the UK, the majority of winter swimming events take place on Christmas Day or Boxing Day, with many hundreds of people swimming in the sea at the largest events in Exmouth, Lowestoft and Brighton. An annual \\"Loony Dook\\" takes place in South Queensferry, Scotland, on New Year's Day. Several thousand attend the event with over one thousand taking the plunge. Participants regularly dress up for the occasion and will usually parade through the local town acting like \\"loonies\\" proceeding the \\"dook\\". Aside from the regular enthusiasts, most are still inebriated from New Year's Eve celebrations and have more than likely lost a bet. Another, smaller plunge occurs on Christmas Day at Blackroot Pool in Sutton Park, Birmingham, England. Often, participants aim to raise money for charity. In the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar, an annual swim is held on Boxing Day. United States Two women prepare to enter the water in Milwaukee Plunges are now held across the United States. Annual events are held in Seattle (since 1993); Evergreen, Colorado; New York (the Coney Island Polar Bear Club); Lake George, NY; Boston (since 1904); Milwaukee's Bradford Beach (since 1916); New Hampshire; and New Jersey. Some, such as Minnesota's, are held to raise proceeds for the Special Olympics. Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth College also organizes an annual \\"Polar Plunge for Health Equity\\" into Occom Pond. The Polar Bear Plunge event in Maryland, the largest polar bear plunge in the United States, held annually at Sandy Point State Park, raises funds for the Special Olympics. Sponsored by the Maryland State Police, in 2007, Plungapalooza raised $2.2 million and had 7,400 participants. In 2008, an estimated 12,000 people participated. Every Super Bowl Sunday, Long Beach, New York, hosts one of the largest in the US. Since 1998 thousands of people have flocked to the beaches of Long Beach to jump into the ocean on Super Bowl Sunday. All proceeds are donated to the Make-A-Wish Foundation.

Most bitlaha pay their penalty or their parents do so they will cease to be shunned from festivals, carnivals, celebrations and religious rituals. Those who decide to remain a bitlaha live in an isolated non-hod community for the rest of their lives. Even though bitlaha do not have to return to their villages, almost all of them do because of kinship networks and strong friendships within the village.

It was originally started in 2004 by members of the Brazos Valley Coalition for Life, including David Bereit and Shawn Carney. The name refers to a repeated pattern of events lasting for 40 days in the Bible, such as Noah‚Äôs Ark, Moses‚Äôs 40 days on Mount Sinai, and Jesus‚Äôs 40 days in the desert. The campaign is active in the spring during the Christian season of Lent and in the fall. According to Florida Catholic, an official Roman Catholic newspaper, more than 1,000,000 people have participated in the campaign worldwide. History According to Roman Catholic Diocese of Sioux City, the initial 2004 local campaign was begun in reaction to the presence of a Planned Parenthood abortion facility which had opened in Bryan, Texas in 1998. ProLife 365 says that four members of the Brazos Valley Coalition for Life, including David Bereit and Shawn Carney, decided to start the prayer campaign 24 hours a day for 40 days with the goal of closing the facility, and credits this campaign for a rejuvenation of local pro-life activities in the Bryan- College Station area. Over the next two and a half years, the campaign was replicated in six other cities. In early 2007, the original 40 Days for Life leaders suggested a simultaneous nationwide 40 Days for Life campaign in as many cities as wished to participate. The first national campaign ran that fall with vigils in 89 cities in 33 U.S. states. A second national campaign was added to run during the spring of each year, starting in Lent of 2008 with campaigns in 59 cities. The spring 2009 campaign had numerous U.S. and international cities participating, including Brisbane, Australia and cities in Canada, Northern Ireland, and the United States. During the fall 2009 campaign, Abby Johnson, the director of the Planned Parenthood facility in Bryan, Texas (where 40 Days for Life originated), resigned and joined the Coalition for Life. In 2013, the Bryan Planned Parenthood closed. The building is now operated by 40 Days for Life. As of the spring 2019 campaign, more than 1,000,000 people have participated in 61 countries across all six populated continents. Approximately 19,000 churches have participated in the 6,428 local campaigns that have been held since 40 Days for Life began. The US-based Christian Broadcasting Network reports that more than 16,000 confirmed cases of abortions were stopped, Campaigns continue to be held in the spring and fall of each year. Campaigns A 40 Days for Life campaign consists of 40 days of prayer and fasting in shifts outside of a clinic or hospital that performs abortions or which is an abortion referral center. The campaign also involves outreach to the community to promote awareness about abortion and outreach directly to women considering abortion. Campaigns are coordinated to take place twice yearly during Lent and fall, although not all campaign locations participate every time. Internationally, the 40 Days for Life campaign is considered an American-style protest. Opposition Participants in the 40 Days for Life campaigns are required to sign a ‚ÄúStatement of Peace‚Äù stating that they will act lawfully and peacefully while participating in the campaign. Holly Baxter, a journalist for the British publication The Guardian states that the organization‚Äôs participants at the vigils are generally friendly. However, abortion-rights activists, concerned that the campaigns harass and intimidate women seeking abortion, have reacted in opposition to the 40 Days for Life campaign, including protests against 40 Days for Life such as ‚Äú40 Days of Choice,‚Äù among others. An ACLU (American Civil Liberties Union) spokesperson called 40 Days for Life ‚Äúthe most dangerous threat to choice.‚Äù Abortion-rights activists have also pursued legal avenues such as buffer zones, especially in Canada and Europe, to prevent anti-abortion activists from approaching women or standing nearby abortion facilities. In some cases, abortion-rights activists have reacted violently against 40 Days for Life participants. The fall 2010 campaign attracted attention when a Tennessee abortion provider was arrested for brandishing a handgun at three 40 Days for Life participants demonstrating outside a South Carolina abortion facility. During the spring 2019 campaign, an 85-year-old 40 Days for Life participant in San Francisco was beaten, his sign stolen, and the incident captured on video.

Built around 1809, it is a rare surviving example of post-and-plank construction, and of a build of small house which once dominated the local landscape. For these reasons it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. History The house was constructed in two stages, with the earliest portion dating to around 1809. The land upon which it stands was once called Steven's Adventure, after Francis Stevens, to whom title was granted in 1694. The first section to be built, using an unusual sort of post-and-plank method, was a three-bay, -story house. Later, a frame addition was made to the south end, also containing three bays. At this time the original roof was replaced by a gambrel roof, which ran the entire length of the house. The resulting structure is quite similar to a house style that was once relatively common during the late 18th and early 19th century in Queen Anne's County, Maryland. The house was auctioned publicly in 1914; its namesake, widow Nora Cray, later lived there with her nine children. In 1975 her heirs donated the house, and its lot, to the Kent Island Heritage Society, which group have restored and furnished it and opened it to the public. Construction The earlier section of house remains fairly ordered; a central door on each facade is flanked by six-over-six-pane windows. The north gable end is a blank wall, and the chimney is \\"paneled\\", with its brickwork exposed up to the second floor. In these respects, the house is not unique, as several similar houses can still be found countywide. The modest size of the original house, too, is very much in keeping with other houses of its age from the surrounding area; such buildings were common in Tidewater Maryland well into the nineteenth century. Less common is the post-and-plank construction of the earliest portion of the house, unusual in Tidewater Maryland, and examples such as this, where the planks run from corner to corner, were virtually unknown before this example was found. The house has a hall-parlor plan that had only one heated room per floor. Despite its small size, however, it was kitted out with full interior trim; elements include beaded board partition and baseboards, a two-piece chair rail, refined trim and a mantel on the first floor. The rear of the house, seen in 2007. In addition to the main dwelling, a smokehouse stands on the property, at the rear of the lot. This structure is not original to the site, but was moved to the house as a rare example of a once-common feature of houses in the region. It is currently operated as a gift shop in conjunction with the house-museum. Significance Meat house on the property, now used as a gift shop When first discovered, the Cray House was thought to be a unique survival of an unusual type of post-and-plank construction. Subsequent investigations have shown that a number of these buildings remain, scattered throughout Tidewater Maryland. Unfortunately, almost all of these buildings are in threatened condition. The majority of the known examples are either small farm buildings or have been adapted as kitchen wings for larger houses. The Cray House, along with two similar buildings in southern Maryland, remain the only examples of such a structure that have remained relatively intact as dwellings. The Cray House is one of a number of historic structures in Stevensville; many are grouped within the Stevensville Historic District, but the Cray House was listed separately. It is, however, located in the middle of the historic area, on Cockey Lane; behind it is the Stevensville Train Depot, while just down the street are the Old Post Office building and the Stevensville Bank.

He went on to play regularly throughout the war years and was rewarded with two wartime Welsh caps against England in 1945. He also guested for Everton, Wrexham and Manchester United, playing for the latter in the northern final of the Football League War Cup.

The original Ottawa Senators, founded in 1883, had a famed history, winning 11 Stanley Cups and played in the NHL from 1917 until 1934. On December 6, 1990, after a two-year public campaign by Firestone to return the NHL to Ottawa, the NHL awarded a new franchise, which began play in the 1992‚Äì93 season. The club has seen its share of struggles, both on and off the ice. The team has had two changes of ownership, from Firestone to Rod Bryden in 1993 due to the arena development process and its financing, and subsequently to Eugene Melnyk after the team filed for bankruptcy in 2003. On the ice, the club finished last in the League in its first four seasons. Changes in hockey management have led to steady improvement of the team's play, resulting in the team qualifying for the Stanley Cup playoffs in 11 of the last 12 seasons, winning the Presidents' Trophy in 2002‚Äì03 and making it to the Stanley Cup Finals in 2007. The \\"Bring back the Senators\\" campaign At the weekly Terrace Investments Ltd. management meeting on December 4, 1987, Duncan MacDonald tabled the initial idea of the NHL returning to Ottawa after learning (Ottawa Citizen, Sports section) about the League's expansion plans for three new franchises in the 1990s. The idea incubated with real estate developer Bruce Firestone for months and accepted that Ottawa was now ready to again support a franchise. He decided to launch a bid for the Ottawa franchise through his development firm Terrace Investments. Firestone first told his fellow Terrace executives, Cyril Leeder, and Randy Sexton, after a game of shinny hockey in March 1988.Finnigan, p. 194. Both were surprised; Leeder thought the idea was \\"ridiculous\\".Robinson, p. 33. Terrace did not have enough assets to finance the team, but Firestone believed that they could do so as part of a development project. Their plan was to build a mini-city (named West Terrace) of 9,000 around a $100 million arena and hotel development on approximately . Getting an NHL club for the arena would drive up the price of the surrounding lands and Terrace's net worth would jump from $100 million to $400 million by 1997. The strategy was straightforward: \\"Buy the site, win the franchise, build the building.\\" In 1989, Terrace found a suitable site west of Ottawa, of farmland, located on both sides of the 417 Highway west of Terry Fox Drive in the then City of Kanata. Pre-launch logo, 1989‚Äì1991. On June 22, 1989, Terrace publicly announced their intentions to acquire an NHL franchise and revive the Senators name. The name choice provoked threats of legal action, though Firestone obtained permission from original-era / 1950s era Senators club owner Tommy Gorman's descendants to use the old Senators name and settled with the Ottawa Jr. Senators' owners. To kick off the \\"Bring Back the Senators\\" campaign, Terrace held a press conference on September 7, 1989 with special guests Frank Finnigan, representing the old Senators' players, and Joe Gorman, representing the Gorman family. Finnigan, the last surviving member of the Senators' last Stanley Cup championship (in 1927), was presented with a new number 8 jersey and the promise to have him drop the first puck at the first game if they emerged victorious. Terrace unveiled drawings of the $55 million, 22,500 seat arena, now named the Palladium, designed by Rossetti Associates, architects of The Palace of Auburn Hills arena. Also unveiled was a logo for the team using a stylized Peace Tower and Canadian flag, designed by David O'Malley of Ottawa. The theme song for the franchise drive was Tom Petty's \\"I Won't Back Down.\\"Finnigan, pp. 196‚Äì197. The Senators' bid was considered something of a longshot. Jim Durrell, the mayor of Ottawa at the time, but later part of the Senators' front office, said, \\"It's not that the area isn't a big enough market to support a professional hockey team, it's just that we're not going to get it.\\"MacGregor(1996), p. 14. National Hockey League Players' Association (NHLPA) head Alan Eagleson was quoted as saying, \\"Local fans are being led through the petunia patch if Bruce Firestone thinks he can land an NHL expansion franchise for Ottawa this century, well into the next or ever.\\"Robinson, p .31. Despite the naysayers, 11,000 fans sent in $25 non-refundable pledges toward season-tickets by November 1990.Finnigan, p. 199. In December 1990, the NHL held a meeting in Palm Beach, Florida, to consider expansion applications. The NHL executives were reportedly impressed by the Ottawa presentation, including Finnigan's participation, the several hundred fans and the marching band who traveled to Palm Beach, but apparently were more impressed at the fact that the group was one of the few applicants willing to pay the $50 million franchise fee without reservations.Stein, pp. 78‚Äì90. On December 6, 1990, the Terrace group was approved to purchase one of the two franchises (along with the Tampa Bay Lightning) to start play in the 1992‚Äì93 season.Finnigan, p. 201. Financing struggles =The Palladium project= Since the location for the new arena was on land designated for agriculture, the arena and development had to be approved by the Government of Ontario. The Ontario New Democratic Party government of Bob Rae was not sympathetic to the conversion of farmland and would not lend any assistance to the project. As the rezoning hearings dragged on, Firestone was offered $20 million to relocate to Anaheim, which had an arena, but no team. Firestone turned it down, claiming, \\"I didn‚Äôt bring back the Ottawa Senators to play in Anaheim.\\" Anaheim would eventually land an expansion team of its own (called the Mighty Ducks), which commenced play one year after Ottawa. Eventually, the rezoning was approved with conditions. The Palladium's size was reduced to 18,500, and Terrace had to pay for a necessary highway interchange. Terrace had to suspend its plans for the rest of the \\"West Terrace\\" development, which limited the site's value. Only the lands to the south of the 417 were allowed to be developed, and the lands on the north side of the 417 were to remain farmland. According to Firestone, Terrace's investment lost $80 million in value to secure the zoning. Eventually, the strain to complete the payment on the franchise to the NHL and to build the arena led to Firestone's resignation on August 17, 1993, after Terrace missed mortgage and development payments. He was replaced as club president by Bryden, who would lead the franchise for the next ten years. Financing of the arena project was difficult. Terrace had four financing deals fail. As it became clear that the Senators could not finance a needed highway interchange without government backing, the Government of Ontario was persuaded successfully to provide a $27 million loan for the highway interchange construction. In the end, the firm of Ogden Entertainment, a New York City facilities management firm, backed the project with a $20 million loan in exchange for a 30-year contract to manage the facility. In addition, American banks loaned $110 million, the federal government gave the Senators $6 million, $10 million from Terrace and $15 million from a Canadian pension fund. The Senators played the first game at the Palladium (today called Canadian Tire Centre) on January 17, 1996. One month after opening, Corel Corporation bought the naming rights in a ten-year deal and the arena was renamed the Corel Centre. The naming rights were then purchased by Scotiabank in a 25-year deal and the arena was re-branded Scotiabank Place. Seven years later, Scotiabank sold the naming rights to Canadian Tire Corporation in a deal which saw the facility receive its current name. =The bankruptcy= The debt payments weighed heavily on the Senators. For several years, Bryden tried to reschedule the debt on the arena. There were various attempts at filing tax losses to write off the debt, all rejected by the federal government. In 2002, Ogden went bankrupt. It had re-invented itself as Covanta Energy and failed not long after the Enron scandal broke out. This led to the Senators filing for bankruptcy on January 9, 2003, when it could not arrange financing to pay all it owed to Covanta, becoming due because of Covanta's bankruptcy. On August 26, 2003 the team and arena was purchased by Biovail chief executive officer (CEO) and Toronto St. Michael's Majors owner Eugene Melnyk, who had shown interest for several years in the team. The limited partnership between Terrace and the limited partners was dissolved and Covanta's creditors received the proceeds of the sale towards the money it was owed for the NHL franchise fee and the Palladium. 1992‚Äì1995: Expansion club struggles The team would name Mel Bridgman as their first general manager (GM) in 1991 after being turned down by Scotty Bowman and John Muckler.MacGregor(1993), pp. 22‚Äì23. The decision was criticized by the press due to Bridgman's lack of GM experience.MacGregor(1993), p. 22. In the coaching department, the club would pick Rick Bowness, formerly the Boston Bruins' head coach, as their first head coach, assisted by Alain Vigneault, E. J. Maguire and Chico Resch. John Ferguson, Sr., would be named director of player personnel. The Expansion draft day on June 18, 1992, was memorable. The team's laptop computer failed and the club was unprepared with a backup plan, picking several ineligible players. Not much talent was available as other teams protected young prospects. The players the Senators did select were \\"journeymen NHLers or players who had good years in minor leagues but no longer were considered prospects.\\"Garrioch, p. 225. While side-deals during the Draft were not allowed, the team would select players in concert with the other teams and in return, other teams gave the Senators Neil Brady, Jody Hull, Brad Marsh and Steve Weeks during the summer, all who would ultimately make the team. In the Entry Draft, the Senators would name Alexei Yashin their first-ever pick, though he would not join the team until 1993.MacGregor(1993), p. ???. =1992‚Äì93: First season= The new Senators were placed in the Adams Division of the Wales Conference, and played their first game on October 8, 1992, at the Ottawa Civic Centre against the Montreal Canadiens. There was much pre-game spectacle -- the skating of Brian Orser, the raising of banners commemorating the original Senators' eight Stanley Cup wins,The Senators would raise nine banners on opening night. They have subsequently raised two further banners (for the 1906 and 1910 seasons) in March 2003. retirement of Frank Finnigan's jersey number and the singing of the anthem by Ottawa native Alanis Morissette. NHL President Gil Stein took part, presenting Bruce Firestone with a \\"certificate of reinstatement\\" to commemorate Ottawa's return to the NHL after 58 years.The certificate does not mean that the original franchise was restored. The NHL lists 1991 for the franchise founding date, which is the date of the final franchise payment, in their official publications. The ceremonial face-off between Laurie Boschman and Denis Savard was done by Frank Finnigan, Jr., (his father having died on December 25, 1991), Firestone, Stein and original Senator Ray Kinsella. The Senators would play in the 10,000 seat Civic Centre until January 1996. The Senators would defeat the eventual Stanley Cup champion Canadiens 5‚Äì3 that night, but it would turn out to be their only highlight of the season for the Senators. The club would tie with the San Jose Sharks for the worst record in the League that year, winning just ten games with 70 losses and four ties (24 points) in the 1992‚Äì93 season. The Senators still hold the NHL record for least road wins for their record that season, with one. Their points total for the season was one point better than the NHL record for fewest points in a season ever. The Senators had aimed low. Firestone had set beating the old record the Senators' goal for the season, as the team planned to finish low in the standings for its first few years in order to receive high draft picks.MacGregor(1993), p. 250. The Senators played their home games at the Ottawa Civic Centre from 1992 to 1996. ;Daigle Cup Among the disappointments during the early years of the resurrected Senators was Alexandre Daigle, the number one overall pick in the 1993 NHL Entry Draft. During the 1992‚Äì93 season, it had become clear that Daigle would be the number one pick. The Quebec Nordiques publicly announced that they would trade several players for him, as they wished to build a new arena and needed a marquee francophone player. As the season progressed, both the Senators and the San Jose Sharks were neck-and-neck in last place, and at that time, NHL rules meant the worst team would receive the first overall pick. This \\"competition\\" was variously dubbed the \\"Daigle Cup\\" and the \\"Yelnats Puc.\\"MacGregor(1993) pp. 227‚Äì255. Near the end of the season, the Senators would call other teams to ask for their opponent's best players to be playing them in upcoming matches, making plans to field a weaker squad if their opponent did so also. The club made no trades to improve its position, not wanting to lose the number one pick. After the season, Bruce Firestone would make comments to the press about how the team deliberately lost games, expecting that comments would be \\"off the record.\\" Instead, his comments were reported, the NHL investigated, and the team was fined $100,000 for his comments. The NHL changed its rules as of the 1995 Draft so that a lottery would be held for the top draft picks. In 1993, the Senators would sign Daigle to a $12.25 million contract, the largest rookie salary in League history, which would lead to a cap on rookie contracts a few years later. The club would promote Daigle over Alexei Yashin, nominating Daigle for rookie of the year over Yashin. His play did not justify full-time status and in 1995, coaches Rick Bowness and Alain Vigneault demoted Daigle to part-time status. The move led to Bowness and Vigneault being fired. In the end, Daigle did not come close to the career the Senators hoped for. After scoring only 74 goals in just over four seasons, he was traded to the Philadelphia Flyers, and is widely regarded as one of the biggest draft busts in sports history. =1993‚Äì1995= After the 1992‚Äì93 season, Bridgman was fired and replaced by Senators Vice-President Randy Sexton. In the 1993‚Äì94 season, with the NHL renaming the conferences and divisions, the team was now based in the Eastern Conference's Northeast Division. The club added prospects Daigle and Yashin. Yashin would have an outstanding rookie season and become a finalist for the Calder Memorial Trophy. Yashin led the team in points with 30 goals and 79 points, while Daigle had 51 points. The Senators would make some progress, improving their record to 14 wins and 37 points, but would again finish last in the League.Garrioch, p. 227. The Senators would select Radek Bonk with their pick, third overall, in the 1994 Draft. During this period, the club may have been more focused on building the Palladium, for which construction began in July 1994. In the lockout-shortened 1994‚Äì95 season, Yashin and Daigle led the club in points again, although their point totals declined. The 1994‚Äì95 Senators team record declined also from the previous season, finishing with nine wins and 23 points (this was over only 48 games), to finish last in the League again. 1996‚Äì2004: Jacques Martin era =Ottawa's turnaround= One month before the Senators were to open the new Palladium, after three-straight last place finishes, and poor attendance at the Civic Centre, the Senators organization was in turmoil. Star player Alexei Yashin, angered that management favoured Daigle over him despite posting higher numbers, was a contract hold-out. First-round draft choice Bryan Berard, who had left the Senators training camp unsigned to a contract, had publicly stated that he would never report to the Senators. After Head Coach Rick Bowness demoted Daigle to the fourth line, General Manager Randy Sexton fired Bowness and Assistant Coach Alain Vigneault on November 20, 1995. He replaced the coaches with Prince Edward Island Senators coach Dave Allison and gave the assistant coaching job to former Hartford Whalers Head Coach Pierre McGuire, who was working at the time as a scout for the Senators. Daigle was returned to full- time duty, but Sexton's changes did not improve the team's play. The situation was a large concern for the Senators ownership and especially for Ogden, which had much invested in the soon-to-open Palladium and which did not want to open the Palladium to poor attendance. Ogden brought in Roy Mlakar to assist in sorting out the turmoil; he would eventually become team president and CEO. The turnaround process started with the firing of Sexton on December 11, 1995, and the hiring of the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim Assistant General Manager Pierre Gauthier as GM, Ottawa's first with previous NHL executive experience. Before the end of January, Gauthier had signed Yashin to a three-year contract, traded Berard to the New York Islanders for Wade Redden, and hired Jacques Martin as head coach. In the midst of the upheaval, the new Palladium had opened. The Senators, still coached by Allison, lost their opening game in the arena 3‚Äì0 to Montreal on January 17, 1996. The event was much more subdued than their franchise's first game. The Cup banners were raised, but the winches jammed, blocking the view of many fans. There were no entertainment big names, and only Firestone and Bryden participated in the ceremonial face- off. The club would lose its first four games at the Palladium, winning none for Allison, who was later fired on January 24 after the team lost 22 of 25 games. While Ottawa finished last in the League for the fourth year in a row, the 1995‚Äì96 season ended with renewed optimism, partly from the debut of new star Daniel Alfredsson, who won the Calder Trophy, the NHL rookie of the year award, the first Senator to do so. Alfredsson, selected 133rd overall in 1994, was also selected to play in the 1996 NHL All-Star Game. The 1996‚Äì97 season would see the Senators qualify for the Stanley Cup playoffs for the first time, in dramatic fashion. They clinched the seventh seed on the last game of the regular season thanks to a late goal from Steve Duchesne against the Buffalo Sabres' Dominik Hasek, giving the Senators a 1‚Äì0 win and the first playoff appearance for an Ottawa-based team in 67 years. The Senators then faced Buffalo in the first round of the playoffs and were eliminated in the full seven games. Despite holding a lead in Game 7, Alexei Yashin put the puck in his own net, allowing Buffalo to tie the game and eventually win the game and the series on a goal by Derek Plante in overtime. The next season, 1997‚Äì98, saw the Senators improve further. They improved their regular season record, finishing with their first winning record in franchise history (one game over .500). In the first play-off round, they upset the top-seeded and the heavily favoured New Jersey Devils in six games to win their first playoff series. The Senators next faced the eventual Eastern Conference champion Washington Capitals and lost in five games. It was in this season that the team unveiled its \\"third jersey\\" in red with the Centurion head logo \\"rotated\\" to face forward. The jersey and logo would be used until the end of the 2006‚Äì07 season. After the season, Rick Dudley would become general manager after Pierre Gauthier returned to Anaheim to become the Ducks' general manager. Dudley would be the Ottawa GM for only a year, however, leaving to join Tampa Bay (for which the Senators received Rob Zamuner as compensation), and was replaced by Marshall Johnston. =Emergence as contenders= The Senators met with limited success in the playoffs, only winning five series in their first nine trips to the post-season. In 1998‚Äì99, the Senators jumped from 14th in the previous season to third, with 103 points‚Äîthe first 100-point season in club history. The team, however, took an embarrassing pratfall in the playoffs, being swept by Buffalo after scoring just three goals in the entire series. Ottawa was locked in a contract dispute with then-captain Alexei Yashin during the 1999‚Äì2000 season. Yashin held out for the entire season, hoping either to play elsewhere or claim his contract was for 1999‚Äì2000, not a year of service. The team responded by suspending him for the entire season and granting the captaincy to Daniel Alfredsson. Yashin tried to sign on with a team in Switzerland, but the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) banned him from playing internationally until the dispute with the Senators was resolved. An NHL arbitrator rejected Yashin's request to make him a free agent, instead ruling that he owed the Senators one more season if he ever returned to the NHL. The Senators even took legal action to recover damages suffered as a result of the dispute. Despite the distraction, the Senators' regular season was successful as they finished with 93 points to qualify for the playoffs in sixth place in the Eastern Conference. Like the previous year, they had a quick playoff exit, losing in six games in the first round to the Toronto Maple Leafs. The Senators' arena, Scotiabank Place, its name following the signing with Scotiabank for a 25-year, $25 million contract in January 2006. The team terminated the agreement seven years later and sold the naming rights to Canadian Tire Corporation, which gave the facility its present name. Yashin returned for the 2000‚Äì01 season, though no longer the captain of the team. Despite being booed at home and in most arenas, being cursed as \\"Alexei Cashin\\" or \\"Cashin Yashin\\" by the fans, he played well for the Senators. The Senators had another successful season, finishing with 109 points, winning the Division and placing second in the East. For the third- straight season, however, the Senators could not win a playoff round, losing again to Toronto in the first round, this time in a 4‚Äì0 sweep. After the season, on the day of the 2001 NHL Entry Draft, Yashin would be dealt to the New York Islanders in exchange for Zdeno Chara, Bill Muckalt and the Islanders' first-round draft pick (second overall), which the Senators used to select Jason Spezza. Yashin would sign a $87.5 million ten-year contract with the Islanders. In 2001‚Äì02, the Senators regular season points total dropped to 94 points, third in the Division, but the team did qualify for the playoffs. Jacques Martin stepped aside as head coach for the final two games to allow Assistant Coach Roger Neilson to have 1,000 games as head coach in the NHL. In the first round, they upset the Philadelphia Flyers in five games, limiting the Flyers' high-powered offence to just two goals for the franchise's second playoff series win. This led to a second round series with Toronto, the third- straight year the Senators had met the Maple Leafs in the \\"Battle of Ontario.\\" The Maple Leafs won the series in a tense seven-game affair, despite the Senators leading the series 3‚Äì2 after five games. After the disappointing end to the season, there was speculation that front-office changes were coming. In the end, GM Marshall Johnston retired, but Martin and Mlakar were re-signed. John Muckler was hired on June 12, 2002, the Senators' sixth GM, and the first with previous experience as a general manager (with Buffalo). He had been interested in the Ottawa job in 1991, but he chose not to wait for the Senators to make him an offer, and he joined the Sabres organization. In 2002‚Äì03, off-ice problems dominated the headlines. The Senators filed for bankruptcy on January 9, 2003, after a long history of debt. They continued regular season play after getting some emergency financing from the NHL. Despite the off-ice problems, Ottawa won the Presidents' Trophy, finishing with a franchise-record 113 points, making them the first Canadian team to win it since the Calgary Flames in 1989. This was also the highest finish by an Ottawa team in 77 years (since the original Senators finished first overall in 1926). In the 2003 playoffs, they defeated Yashin and his New York Islanders and the Philadelphia Flyers before coming within one game of making it into the Finals, falling to the eventual Stanley Cup champions, the New Jersey Devils. =Failure in playoffs and firing of Jacques Martin= Jason Spezza was picked with the draft choice received for Alexei Yashin. In the off- season, Eugene Melnyk would purchase the club to bring financial stability and the team entered the 2003‚Äì04 season with high expectations. Head Coach Jacques Martin would guide the team to another good regular season, finishing with 102 points. This was good for only third in the tightly contested Northeast Division, as Boston would have 104 and Toronto 103. The seedings meant that the Senators would play the Maple Leafs in the first round of the 2004 playoffs for the fourth-straight time. By now, Ottawa had developed a strong rivalry with their Ontario rivals, and there was a great deal of pressure on the team to finally defeat the Leafs. Despite missing their captain Mats Sundin and other veterans, the Maple Leafs would win the series on the back of goaltender Ed Belfour, who had two shutouts in the series, defeating the Senators in seven games. In Game 7, Senators goaltender Patrick Lalime would surrender three goals before the first period was done and would be replaced by backup Martin Prusek. The Senators were not able to come back from the 3-0 deficit, losing 4‚Äì1. It was Lalime's last appearance in a Senators' uniform, and Martin's last game as coach‚Äîtwo days after the loss, Martin was fired. and Lalime was later traded to the St. Louis Blues for a fourth-round pick in the 2005 NHL Draft. After losing eight of 12 playoff series, including all four series in five years against Toronto, team management felt that a new coach was required for playoff success. Muckler even suggested that the new coach would have \\"to fix the dressing room\\", implying the team was not responding to Martin. On June 8, 2004, Bryan Murray became the team's fifth head coach, leaving the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, where he had been general manager. He would not actually coach until 2005 due to the 2004‚Äì05 NHL lockout, instead spending time on scouting. 2004‚Äì2017: Bryan Murray era =2004‚Äì05: Lockout time= The Senators, like the other NHL teams, did not play during the lockout. Most players chose to play in Europe, although some, including Jason Spezza, played for the Senators' farm team, the Binghamton Senators. Prior to the lockout, the Senators had acquired free agent goaltender Dominik Hasek. He did not play for any teams during the season, instead practicing with Binghamton. Daniel Alfredsson had a very good season in Sweden with Fr√∂lunda HC, winning the Swedish championship. =2005‚Äì06: High expectations unfulfilled= Forward Dany Heatley netted two consecutive 50-goal seasons in 2005‚Äì06 and the following year. The media predicted the Senators to be Stanley Cup contenders, as they had a strong core back after the lockout, played in an up-tempo style fitting the new rule changes and Hasek was expected to provide top-notch goaltending. The team rushed out of the gate, winning 19 of the first 22 games, in the end winning 52 games and 113 points, placing first in the East, and second overall in the League. Prior to the season, the Senators had acquired Dany Heatley in a blockbuster trade with the Atlanta Thrashers for Marian Hossa and Greg de Vries. Heatley, Alfredsson and Spezza immediately formed one of the League's top offensive lines, dubbed the \\"CASH line\\" by fans in a contest held by the Ottawa Citizen. (The name is made from the initials of Captain Alfredsson, Spezza, and Heatley. Another nickname the line has picked up is the \\"Pizza Line\\", and is the nickname used by the Citizen's rival paper, the Ottawa Sun.) The line made a dramatic debut in the first game, with Alfredsson scoring a goal to force overtime and Alfredsson and Heatley scoring goals in the League's first-ever shootout round. Heatley became the first player in franchise history to reach 100 points and the first to reach the 50-goal mark. The line is notable as a top offensive line, the top line of all time for the Senators, and is widely regarded as one of the top lines in the NHL earning such quotes as \\"best trio in the NHL,\\" \\"most dangerous line in hockey,\\" \\"high-flying trio,\\" \\"League's highest scoring line\\" and \\"potent first line\\" in the sports media and hockey fans, both of the Senators and other teams. Despite the regular season success, the team entered the playoffs under a cloud. In February, Hasek had suffered an adductor muscle injury while playing for the Czech Republic men's national ice hockey team during the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin. He had played only one game for the Czechs and returned to Ottawa to heal, but would never play for the Senators again. Rookie goaltender Ray Emery had to take over the starting goaltender duties, leading the media to predict an early playoff exit due to Hasek's absence. Hopes were raised in the first round, however, when Emery would become the first rookie goaltender since Philadelphia's Brian Boucher in 2000 to win a playoff series when the Senators defeated the Tampa Bay Lightning four games to one. However, the Senators then lost to the Buffalo Sabres in the second round, a series in which all games were decided by one goal. This was the last hurrah for several Senators, as Zdeno Chara, Dominik Hasek, Martin Havlat, Bryan Smolinski and Brian Pothier all left the team after the season; Chara, Hasek and Pothier departed via free agency, while Havlat and Smolinski were both dealt to the Chicago Blackhawks. =2006‚Äì07: Trip to the Stanley Cup Finals= The Senators' season went off to a poor start, and was marked by a struggle to reach a .500 win-loss ratio. Until December, the team had a 21‚Äì18‚Äì1 record, though they had much more success in the remaining half of the season, eventually finishing second in the Division after the Presidents' Trophy-winning Sabres and earning the fourth seed in the East. They ultimately finished with 105 points, their fourth-straight 100-point season and sixth in their last eight. Captain Daniel Alfredsson improved his play in the 2007 playoffs, tallying a League-leading 22 points. In the playoffs, Ottawa's fourth placing in the Conference meant that the first-round playoff series was against the fifth-seeded Pittsburgh Penguins. Some media were expecting the Penguins to win the series for three reasons‚Äîthe Penguins had won the season series, the Senators' past playoff troubles and the strong young talent of the Penguins, particularly young star Sidney Crosby. The Senators, however, won easily by a score of four games to one, including a 3‚Äì0 shutout win in Game 5. This was the only series where the Senators were the higher-seeded team. The second-round series was against the Atlantic Division-leading New Jersey Devils in a rematch of the 2003 Eastern Conference Finals. The Senators again won by a score of four games to one. Next, the Senators faced off against Buffalo in the Conference Final, looking to get even for losing to the Sabres in the 2006 playoffs. The Senators took the series, again by a score of four games to one, earning the Prince of Wales Trophy as the Eastern Conference champions and advancing to the Stanley Cup Finals to face the Western Conference-winning Anaheim Ducks. Daniel Alfredsson scored the series-winning goal, (see video) in overtime, redemption for being beaten a year before on the goal that eliminated Ottawa from the playoffs. It was also the first series win by the Senators against the Sabres. ;First Stanley Cup finals in the capital in 80 years The 2006‚Äì07 Senators thus became the first Ottawa team to be in the Stanley Cup Finals since the 1927 Stanley Cup Finals. Despite the 80-year gap, one fan attended games both the 1927 and the 2007 Finals‚Äîthe third game of the series and first home game for Ottawa on June 2 was attended by 99-year-old Russell Williams as a guest of the Senators. He had attended the last Finals game in Ottawa on April 13, 1927, played in the old Ottawa Auditorium. Both the 1927 and 2007 games were won by the Senators. Ottawa City Hall before Game 3 of the Stanley Cup Finals The city was swept up in the excitement of being in the Finals. Businesses along all the main streets posted large hand-drawn \\"Go Sens Go\\" signs, residents put up large displays in front of their homes or decorated their cars. A large Senators flag was draped on the City Hall, along with a large video screen showing the games. A six- story likeness of Daniel Alfredsson was hung on the Corel building and the Senators organization held rallies at City Hall, and car rallies of decorated cars paraded from Lynx stadium, through downtown to Scotiabank Place. The series marked the first time that an NHL team with a captain from Europe had made the Finals, as Senators captain Alfredsson hails from Sweden. (Previously, only Americans or Canadians had captained teams in the Finals.) Alfredsson would be one of the bright lights for the Senators in the series, as he had been in all the playoff series. But he would be one of the few bright lights as Anaheim won the series in five games bolstered by strong defensive play and opportunistic scoring. The first two games were in Anaheim, both won by the Ducks by one-goal margins. Game 3 went to the Senators, but Game 4 in Ottawa was won by the Ducks, for an insurmountable three games to one lead. The Ducks would finish the series in Game 5 at home. The Ducks had been favoured to win the Cup since before the season started. The Senators were the third consecutive Canadian franchise to reach the Final and they suffered the same fate as the Calgary Flames of 2004 and the Edmonton Oilers of 2006. =2007‚Äì08: Stanley Cup hangover= The Senators made major changes in their hockey staff during the off-season. On June 17, 2007, General manager John Muckler was fired; he had been in the last year of his contract. Head coach Bryan Murray was subsequently promoted to GM. On July 5, 2007, he hired his nephew Tim Murray as assistant GM, followed by the promotion of assistant coach John Paddock to head coach on July 6, 2007. On August 15, Goaltending coach Ron Low was named as assistant coach while Eli Wilson was named goaltending coach. Assistant coach Greg Carvel retained his duties. On November 5, 2007, the Senators set a franchise record eighth-straight win with their victory over the Maple Leafs. On November 6, six Senators were named to the All-Star Game ballot: Daniel Alfredsson, Ray Emery, Dany Heatley, Chris Phillips, Wade Redden and Jason Spezza, the most from any one team in the NHL. The \\"CASH line\\" was named to the All-Star roster in its entirety, Alfredsson to the starting lineup and Dany Heatley and Jason Spezza as reserves. On January 24, 2008, Alfredsson recorded a franchise-record seven points (three goals and four assists) against the Tampa Bay Lightning, taking over the NHL scoring lead momentarily. After the hot start, a prolonged slump through January and February occurred during which the Senators won only seven of 21 games, and Murray fired Head Coach Paddock and Assistant Coach Ron Low on February 27, 2008, taking over the coaching duties himself. After the coaching switch, team performance improved but did not match the performance of the beginning of the season. A playoff spot was in doubt until the Senators' last game of the season, a loss to Boston, but the team qualified due to the Carolina Hurricanes losing. After all other games were played, the team ended up as the seventh seed and faced the Pittsburgh Penguins in the opening round, a repeat of the 2007 Eastern Conference Quarterfinals. The Senators lost the series four games to none, the third time they were swept in a first-round series. The result, after going to the Finals the previous season, led to speculation by the media that the team would make a large change in personnel before next season, including the buy-out of Ray Emery and the Senators not re-signing their free agents. =2008‚Äì09: Season of turnover= After a disappointing 2007‚Äì08 season, Senators' management promised change, and in the off-season fulfilled that promise with changes both in coaching and on-ice personnel. On June 13, 2008, the Senators named Craig Hartsburg, who had been head coach of the OHL's Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds, as the new head coach, signing him to a three-year contract. The Senators also named Curtis Hunt, formerly of the Regina Pats, as assistant coach. On the player side, the first change was the buy-out of troubled goaltender Ray Emery's contract following a difficult season. Long-time Senator Wade Redden left via free-agency, and 2007‚Äì08 trade acquisitions Mike Commodore, Cory Stillman and Martin Lapointe were not re-signed. Brian McGrattan and Andrej Meszaros were traded, Meszaros following a contract dispute. From the free agent market, the Senators signed goaltender Alex Auld, defenceman Jason Smith, and agitating forward Jarkko Ruutu. In exchange for Meszaros, defencemen Filip Kuba, Alexandre Picard and a 2009 first-round draft pick (later dealt for defenceman Chris Campoli) were acquired from the Tampa Bay Lightning. To start the 2008‚Äì09 season, the Senators played their first-ever games in Europe, starting in Gothenburg, Sweden, playing Daniel Alfredsson's former team, Fr√∂lunda HC. The Senators then began the regular season with two games in Stockholm against the Pittsburgh Penguins, splitting the results in a 4‚Äì3 overtime loss and a 3‚Äì1 win. The Senators struggled throughout the first half of the season, having the lowest number of goals scored in the League. Following a disappointing 17‚Äì24‚Äì7 start, the Senators fired Hartsburg on February 1, 2009, after a 7‚Äì4 loss to the Washington Capitals. He was replaced by Cory Clouston, the head coach of their farm team in Binghamton. The team showed almost immediate improvement under Clouston, playing above .500 for the remainder of the season. Though much improved, the team was unable to make up for its poor start, and was officially eliminated from playoff contention on March 31. The team continued to play well, winning nine games in a row at home. On April 8, Clouston was rewarded with a two-year deal to continue coaching the Senators. =2009‚Äì10: Return to the playoffs= After the season had concluded, word was leaked that star forward Heatley had demanded a trade, placing GM Murray in a precarious position. On June 30, a deal to Edmonton was finalized, but Heatley rejected it by refusing to waive his no-trade clause. On September 12, 2009, Heatley was traded, along with a fifth-round pick in 2010 NHL Entry Draft, to the San Jose Sharks in exchange for forwards Milan Michalek and Jonathan Cheechoo, as well as a second-round pick in the 2010 NHL Draft. Michalek would play well for the Senators, but Cheechoo struggled and was demoted to the Binghamton Senators before having his contract bought out in the off-season. On January 13, 2010, Bryan Murray relieved Goaltending Coach Eli Wilson of his duties. Immediately afterward, the team went on a team-record 11-game winning streak. The streak propelled the team to the top of the Northeast Division standings and a top-three placing for the playoffs. The team was unable to hold off the Sabres for the division lead, but qualified for the playoffs in the fifth position. For the third season in four, the Senators played off against the Penguins in the first round. A highlight for the Senators was winning a triple-overtime fifth game in Pittsburgh, but the team was unable to win a playoff game on home ice, losing the series in six games. Young All-Star defenceman Erik Karlsson was regarded as a cornerstone of the franchise as it rebuilt. =2010‚Äì11: Rebuilding= The Senators had a much poorer than expected 2010‚Äì11 campaign, resulting in constant rumours of a shakeup right through until December. The rumours were heightened in January after the team went on a lengthy losing streak. January was a dismal month for the Senators, winning only one game all month. Media speculated on the imminent firing of Clouston, Murray or both. Owner Melynk cleared the air in an article in the January 22, 2011 edition of the Ottawa Sun. Melnyk stated that he would not fire either Clouston or Murray, but that he had given up on this season and was in the process of developing a plan for the future. On Monday, January 24, The Globe and Mail reported that the plan included hiring a new general manager before the June entry draft and that Murray would be retained as an advisor to the team. A decision on whether to retain Clouston would be made by the new general manager. The article by Roy MacGregor, a long-time reporter of the Ottawa Senators, stated that former Assistant Coach Pierre McGuire had already been interviewed. Murray, in a press conference that day stated that he wished to stay on as the team's general manager. He also stated that Melnyk was allowing him to continue as general manager without restraint. Murray said that the players were now to be judged by their play until the February 28 trade deadline. Murray would attempt to move \\"a couple, at least\\" of the players for draft picks or prospects at that time if the Senators remained out of playoff contention. At the time of Murray's comments the team was eight games under .500 and 14 points out of a playoff position after 49 games. Murray started with the trading of Mike Fisher to the Nashville Predators in exchange for a first-round pick in the 2011 draft. Fisher already had a home in Nashville with new wife Carrie Underwood. The trading of Fisher, a fan favorite in Ottawa, lead to a small anti-Underwood backlash in the city with the banning of her songs from the play lists of some local radio stations. Murray next traded Chris Kelly, another veteran, to the Boston Bruins for a second-round pick in the 2011 draft. A few days later, pending unrestricted free agent Jarkko Ruutu was sent to the Anaheim Ducks in exchange for a sixth- round pick in 2011. A swap of goaltenders was made with the Colorado Avalanche which brought Craig Anderson to Ottawa in exchange for Brian Elliott. Both goalies were having sub-par seasons prior to the trade. Under-achieving forward Alex Kovalev was traded to the Pittsburgh Penguins for a seventh-round draft pick. On trade deadline day, Ottawa picked up goaltender Curtis McElhinney on waivers, and traded Chris Campoli with a seventh-round pick to the Chicago Blackhawks for a second-round pick and Ryan Potulny. Goaltender Anderson played very well down the stretch for Ottawa, and the team quickly signed the soon-to-be unrestricted free agent to a four-year contract. After media speculation on the future of Murray within the organization, Murray was re-signed as general manager on April 8, to a three-year extension. On April 9, Head Coach Cory Clouston and assistants Greg Carvel and Brad Lauer were dismissed from their positions. Murray said that the decision was made based on the fact that the team entered the season believing it was a contender, but finished with a 32‚Äì40‚Äì10 record. Former Detroit Red Wings Assistant Coach Paul MacLean was hired as Clouston's replacement on June 14, 2011. =2011‚Äì2016: Up and down seasons= As the 2011‚Äì12 season began, many hockey writers and commentators were convinced that the Senators would finish at or near the bottom of the NHL standings.http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Hockey/NHL/Ottawa/2011/09/14/18687986.html Five things Sens need to do to make playoffs. In the midst of rebuilding, the Ottawa lineup contained many rookies and inexperienced players. The team struggled out of the gate, losing five of their first six games before a reversal of fortunes saw them win six games in a row. In December 2011, the team acquired forward Kyle Turris from the Phoenix Coyotes in exchange for David Rundblad and a draft pick. The team improved its play afterwards and moved into a playoff position before the All-Star Game. For the first time in Senators' history, the All-Star Game was held in Ottawa, and it was considered a great success. Five Senators were voted in or named to the event, including Daniel Alfredsson, who was named captain of one team. The team continued its playoff push after the break. After starting goalie Craig Anderson injured his hand in a kitchen accident at home, the Senators called up Robin Lehner from Binghamton and acquired highly regarded goaltender Ben Bishop from the St. Louis Blues. While Anderson recovered, the team continued its solid play. On April 1, 2012, the Senators defeated the New York Islanders 5‚Äì1, officially ensuring a playoff position. The team finished as the eighth seed in the Eastern Conference, drawing a first round playoff matchup against the Conference champion New York Rangers. Ultimately, Ottawa lost the series in seven games. The next season, Ottawa would be challenged to repeat the success they had in 2011‚Äì12, due to long-term injuries to key players such as Erik Karlsson, Jason Spezza, Milan Michalek and Craig Anderson. Despite these injuries, the Senators would finish seventh in the Eastern Conference and head coach Paul MacLean would go on to win the Jack Adams Award as the NHL's coach of the year. Ottawa would play the second-seeded Montreal Canadiens in the first round of the playoffs, eventually winning in five games, blowing out Montreal 6‚Äì1 in games three and five. The Senators would advance to play the top-seeded Pittsburgh Penguins in the second round, this time losing in five games. During the off-season, the Senators traded veteran defenceman Sergei Gonchar to the Dallas Stars in exchange for a sixth-round draft pick in 2013. July 5, 2013 would be a day of mixed emotions for the city and fans, as long- time captain Daniel Alfredsson signed a one-year contract with the Detroit Red Wings, leaving Ottawa after 17 seasons with the Senators and 14 as captain. The signing shocked numerous fans across the city and many within the Senators organization. The day finished optimistically however, as Murray acquired star forward Bobby Ryan from the Anaheim Ducks in exchange for forwards Jakob Silfverberg, Stefan Noesen and a first-round draft pick in 2014. Murray would also sign free agent forward Clarke MacArthur to a two-year contract that same day and would sign free agent defenceman Joe Corvo to a one-year contract three days later on July 8. For the 2013‚Äì14 season, the League re-aligned and Ottawa was moved to the new Atlantic Division along with the rest of the old Northeast Division and the Columbus Blue Jackets and Detroit Red Wings from the Western Conference. The re-alignment increased the competition to qualify for the playoffs, as there was now 16 teams in the East fighting for eight playoff spots. There were changes on the club as well. Ottawa entered the season with Jason Spezza as the team's new captain as long-time captain Daniel Alfredsson left to join the Detroit Red Wings after a contract dispute with the club. The same day that Alfredsson signed, the club swung a deal for Anaheim Ducks' scorer Bobby Ryan. There were numerous other changes to the lineup as well. The club signed free agents Clarke MacArthur and Joe Corvo, while not re-signing veteran defencemen Sergei Gonchar and Andre Benoit. While MacArthur had a career season, Ryan played well until he was injured, and Corvo lost his place in the lineup. The club struggled on defence, with shots and goals against increasing from the previous season. The club was a sub-.500 team much of the season, or only a few games above and never was in a playoff position all season. At the NHL trade deadline, Murray traded for flashy right winger Ales Hemsky from Edmonton and he played well, establishing chemistry on a line alongside Jason Spezza and Milan Michalek, though the club was eliminated from playoff contention in the last week of the season. In 2014‚Äì15, the team made the playoffs, only to lose in the first round. 2017‚Äìpresent: Pierre Dorion era Murray retired after the 2015‚Äì16 season. He had been diagnosed with cancer and the team failed again to make the playoffs. The team promoted assistant GM Pierre Dorion to general manager and hired Guy Boucher and Marc Crawford as associate head coaches. The 2016‚Äì17 season was a surprise high point for the team as it made a playoff run to the Eastern Conference Final, losing in double-overtime in the seventh game of the series. The team picked up several veterans that made key contributions and Karlsson, Turris and Ryan made crucial contributions. The 2017‚Äì18 season was a major disappointment. From the playoff run team, the team lost Clarke MacArthur, Marc Methot, Chris Neil, Chris Kelly, Tommy Wingels and Viktor Stalberg. Additionally, captain Erik Karlsson was injured to start the season and first- line center Kyle Turris was in a contract dispute with the team. Turris was traded to the Colorado Avalanche for Matt Duchene. The team at first absorbed the changes and remained in a playoff spot. However, team play declined to the point where the team traded away several veterans at the trade deadline and finished in 30th place in the league. The team hosted an outdoor game to great success, however owner Eugene Melnyk made off-the-cuff comments about fan attendance that soured fan opinions. Logo and jersey design The team colours are red, black and white, like the original era Senators, and like other Ottawa sports teams (such as the Ottawa Renegades, Rough Riders and 67s), with added trim of gold. The colours are attributed to the colours of the defunct Ottawa Amateur Athletic Association, the Ottawa Hockey Club being a member club. The club logo is officially the head of a Roman general, a member of the Senate of the Roman Empire, projecting from a gold circle. There have been several versions of the team logo. The original, unveiled on May 23, 1991, described the general as a \\"centurion figure, strong and prominent\\" according to its designer, Tony Milchard. Milchard intended the logo to be similar to that of the Chicago Blackhawks head logo. Leaked before its unveiling, the logo design was unpopular with fans, being compared unfavourably to the American Express card, the USC Trojans and the Trojan condom. The original had the words \\"Ottawa Senators\\" within the circle. This logo was slightly revised in 1996 to remove the team name from the gold circle and replace it with laurels. The Senators jerseys as used from 2003 until 2007 The original home jersey was white with black and red stripes. The original \\"away\\" jersey was black, with white and red trim. Shoulder patches used a winged \\"S\\" in \\"established MDCCCXCIV\\" (1894) logo. The League changed its policies on coloured and white jerseys and the white jersey became the away jersey. The club would use the white jersey with the original logo until the end of the 2007 Stanley Cup Finals. In 1998, the Senators unveiled a new logo, taking the head, which had been in profile, and rotating it so that it was face-first. The new logo was unveiled with a new red \\"third\\" jersey, prominently using \\"curved\\" or \\"swoosh\\" stripes. On the shoulder, the original logo was used as a shoulder patch. The original dark jersey, (then the \\"away\\" jersey) which was mostly black, was retired after the season. The red jersey became the home jersey and it remained in use until the end of the 2007 Stanley Cup Finals. Starting in July 2000, the Senators reused the alternate logo on another third jersey, designed by Ottawa firm Hoselton Brunet, this one black with red and gold sleeves and a gold stripe with laurel leaves along the bottom of the jersey. On the shoulders, was a modified version of the original Peace Tower logo of the expansion campaign, which the management liked. Like the original logo, this design was leaked onto the Internet. This jersey was in use until the end of the 2006‚Äì07 season. =2007 update= On August 22, 2007, the Senators unveiled a set of new jerseys, which have a more refined, streamlined look to them,. The team retired all three previous jerseys and did not have a third jersey for the 2007‚Äì08 season. The updated look came in conjunction with the launch of the new Rbk EDGE jerseys by Reebok, adopted League-wide for the 2007‚Äì08 season. At the same time, the team updated its logos, designed by local firm Acart Communications. The new primary logo is an update of the old secondary logo, which according to team owner Eugene Melnyk, \\"represents strength and determination.\\" The logo was modified in several ways, updating the facial features, removing facial colouring, reducing size of the gold semicircle and updating the cape of the warrior. The new secondary logo is an update of the old primary logo. Only the primary logo will appear on the jerseys, as the secondary logo will be on Sens' merchandise. The new shoulder patch 'O' logo replaces the winged 'S' shoulder patch with the jersey logo of the original Ottawa Senators club. =2008 and 2011 third jerseys= On November 22, 2008, the Senators unveiled a new third jersey in a game versus the New York Rangers. Marketed with the slogan 'Back in Black' in reference to the black \\"away\\" jerseys the team wore during its first several seasons, the jersey is primarily black, while the team's other traditional colors of white and red are also integrated. The Senators' primary \\"centurion figure\\" logo moves to the shoulders. The front features the word 'SENS' in white with red and gold trim, as a new primary logo. The 'SENS' third jersey was retired in 2011. On January 20, 2011, the Ottawa Sun reported that the Senators organization was studying designs for a new third jersey to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the current franchise. The Senators announced to season ticket holders on March 2, 2011, that the new third jersey will be a 'heritage design' based on the early-era Senators jersey. The new third jersey was to be unveiled officially on October 1, 2011, however was mistakenly leaked after being discovered in a souvenir store at First Niagara Center. The jersey will be a 'barber-pole' design with a large 'O' on the front, and shield-shaped badges on each shoulder. One shoulder badge has the words \\"Ottawa Senators\\", the other has the words \\"S√©nateurs d'Ottawa\\". Mostly black, the third jersey incorporates horizontal striping intended to be reminiscent of the original Senators' 'barber-pole' designs, and the large letter O used in Ottawa jersey designs going back to the 1890s. The new , while an entirely new creation, most resembles the look of the 1926‚Äì27 Senators, when the franchise won its last Stanley Cup. Shield-type patches were added to the shoulders. The design of the shield-type patches was intended to be similar to the shield patches that the original Senators added to their jerseys after each Stanley Cup championship win. The patches spell the team name, one in English, and one in French. Jacob Barrette, a local Gatineau, Quebec fan had posted a similar design on the internet since 2009. The Senators worked with Barrette to develop the jersey design in time for the 20th anniversary season. =2014 Heritage Classic jersey= A special edition jersey was used for the 2014 Heritage Classic against the Vancouver Canucks on March 2, 2014. The jersey shares virtually the same characteristics as their current third jersey, albeit reversed so that cream is the primary colour. =2017 update= The move to Adidas as the NHL's uniform provider necessitated some slight changes in the Senators uniforms. While the overall design was carried over from the Reebok Edge look, the fonts now use the style that was found on the barber-pole third jerseys they wore from 2011‚Äì17.

The submarines had a length of overall, a beam of and a mean draft of . They displaced on the surface and submerged. The G-class submarines had a crew of 30 officers and other ranks. They had a partial double hull.Gardiner & Gray, p. 90 For surface running, G 14 was initially powered by two FIAT diesels, but these proved unsuccessful and she was refitted with the standard Vickers two-stroke diesel engines, each driving one propeller shaft.

It is part of the Ocotl√°n District in the south of the Valles Centrales Region. The area was a significant population center at the time of the Spanish Conquest, and for that reason an important Dominican monastery was established here in the 16th century. The complex still exists, with the church still being used for worship and the cloister area used as a museum. While mostly quiet, the city is an important distribution and transportation center for the south of the Central Valleys region of Oaxaca, a function which is expected to be reinforced with the opening of new highway being built to connect the city of Oaxaca with the Pacific coast. The city is known for artist Rodolfo Morales, who painted aspects of his hometown in his works and sponsored projects to save and restore historic monuments here. For generations the municipality has been known for its crafts, with the ceramics making Aguilar family producing some of the best known craftsmen. The name Ocotlan is from Nahuatl and means \\"among the ocote trees\\" with the appendage \\"de Morelos\\" added in honor of Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos y Pav√≥n. During the colonial period the area was known as Santo Domingo Ocotl√°n due to the Dominican friars who created a monastery here dedicated to Saint Dominic. The Zapotec name for the area is \\"Lachiroo\\" which means \\"large valley\\" although some Zapotecs in the Tlacolula area called it \\"Guelache\\" which means \\"plaza of the valley\\". History Hall on upper level of the former monastery The ethnicity of the first populations of this area is not known, but one of the earliest settlements is a site called Tortolita, located two km from the modern town center. When the Spanish arrived, the settlement had about 2,000 inhabitants, which is why the monastery was eventually founded here. In 1538, the bishopric sent Dominicans to found a parish. The monastery was founded in 1555 and called Santo Domingo de Ocotl√°n. The official founding of the town by Diego Hernandez Domingo Luis and Juan Vazquez also occurred in 1555. The complex was never finished because the local people also worked in the mines established nearby. By the 18th century, Octolan has eight small neighborhoods including one called Santa Mar√≠a Tocuela (the oldest) and San Juan Chilatece in which the market was founded. During the Mexican War of Independence, Morelos camped here for three days on his way to Acapulco. Ocotlan was officially declared a town in 1875. In 1916, forces loyal to Venustiano Carranza successfully defended the town from an attack led by General Macario Hernandez. Ocotlan was officially declared a city in 1926. Since the Mexican Revolution, the city has been mostly quiet but the current construction of a superhighway linking the city of Oaxaca has been bringing changes to the area. The road called Camino Real a San Juan was recently paved, and event that drew the attendance of the governor of Oaxaca. Other newly paved roads include Calle Industria, Calle Francisco Villa and Calle Ayuntamiento. The new paving is meant to relieve traffic congestion on the roads to Ejutla de Crespo and the city of Oaxaca by providing alternate routes for current and future traffic. In 2006, the social uprisings that affected much of Oaxaca affected Ocotl√°n. Much of the social unrest centered around the mines that are located in the municipality and consequences continue to this day. A mining labor leader from the area, Napolean Gomez Urrutia, living in Vancouver, is seeking asylum in Canada after the Mexican government asked for his extradition. He is accused of fraud, criminal associated and other offences associated with the social uprisings. Before he left for Canada, Gomez Urrutia was demanding an investigation into the deaths of 65 workers at a coal mine in the area. In 2009, protesters from several communities in the municipality blocked a highway to demand the cancellation of an arrest warrant against residents who opposed the operation of a mine and demand talks to close the La Trinidad mine. The mine belongs to a Mexican-Canadian company called Cuxcatlan. Protesters claim the mine is polluting their lands. The protesters were supported by Section 22 of the SNTE and APPO. An unrelated controversy in 2008 involved child pornography charges against the Colegio Guadalupe school. Implicated are several parents and photographer Norberto Dionisio Martinez. The photographs in question involved partially nude women, men and children in a classroom at the school. Angry parents have protested and sued the school although those involved claimed no pornographic acts were involved. The city Kiosk in the main plaza The city can seem like an ordinary and even empty town at first glance. However, because of its geographic location on the south end of the Central Valleys region of Oaxaca, the city is a distribution center for local towns and smaller cities such as Santa Luc√≠a Miahuatl√°n. It is also a point of transit for those traveling between the state capital and the coast, a role that will be enforced with the completion of the new modern highway. One reason the area is relatively quiet is that for many years, until recently, its churches, monastery, plazas and gardens lay unkempt against the effects of the sun and time, as well as vandalism. Most of the restoration work was sponsored by artist Rodolfo Morales, a native of Ocotl√°n. The city's main attraction is the Temple and Ex- convent of Santo Domingo de Guzm√°n. The complex was constructed in various stages between the 16th and 19th centuries. The construction of the monastery was halted on several occasions due to the lack of manpower, due to the discovery of mines nearby such as Santa Catarina. The main vault, apse, choir and sacristy of the church were not finished until 1669. The pillars of the cloister were begun at this time as well, but were never finished. Courtyard of monastery with church behind From then until the early 19th century, much of the complex was poorly maintained and fell into ruins. Starting in 1804, the Dominicans worked to rehabilitate the building, with attempts continuing until the complex was appropriated by the federal government during the Reform Laws. Ocotlan was one of the last towns in Oaxaca to still have friars in residence in the 19th century but by 1855, the last one had left. By 1885, the monastery area was completely abandoned, but the church was still functioning and remaining in relatively good condition. Santo of Saint John, from the Chapel of the Se√±or de la SacristiaAfter it was no longer used as a monastery, the complex has several uses, including that of a prison, where inmates made crafts. In the latter 20th century, the Rodolfo Morales Foundation restored and converted the monastery space into a museum, which contains one room with works by Morales, one room with Oaxaca crafts and one room with artwork from the colonial period. There are also sound and book libraries. In the courtyard where the old pillory is, are held cultural events and photography shoots. The church was also restored by the foundation, but maintains its religious function. The church is fronted by a very large atrium fenced by a stone wall. The main facade has two bodies and a crest with both Baroque and Neoclassical elements. The first body contains the door arch and the second is marked by the choir window. Both bodies are flanked by columns with Ionic order capitols. The columns extend up the facade and have profuse vegetative decoration. At the top, there is a shell. In the interior is the Chapel of the Senor de la Sacristia, which is decorated in Neoclassical style. In both the church and the chapel are found a large number of colonial-era santos (statues of saints), many executed in fine polychrome and well preserved.Santos in Oaxaca's Ancient Churches: Santo Domingo Ocotl√°n . Retrieved 2012-04-13. Municipal palace The municipal palace has a sober Neoclassic facade built with pink stone, with columns and pediments. The main feature are the arches which rest on columns with rectangular bases, forming portals. It was designed to be a focus point for social interaction. The main feature of the interior is the mural work done in the council chambers by Rodolfo Morales in the 1950s, when he was a young man. The mural work depicts scenes from the history of Ocotl√°n as well as landscapes and representative scenes such as the municipality markets, mining and agriculture. Unfortunately, this work does not receive the care it deserves as the chambers have been used for storage as well as meetings. This palace was constructed to commemorate the Centennial of Mexican Independence which occurred in 1910, and was completed in 1913. Courtyard of the Morales house The Rodolfo Morales house is a mansion from the 18th century which he rescued and lived in. Today, the building is a cultural center with an open-air theatre, which can seat 200 people, galleries of work by local artists and a computer center. All activities and resources here are offered free of charge. The house is located just north of the main square and preserves a number of Morales personal effects, including collages. The building is also home to the Fundaci√≥n Cultural Rodolfo Morales, A. C (Rodolfo Morales Cultural Foundation), which is a private, nonprofit organization which promotes education and culture in the Ocotlan District of the state of Oaxaca. The Foundation realizes restorations, the maintenance and conservation of architectural monuments, paintings and sculptures and trains young people in restoration work. The foundation was created in 1992 by Rodolfo Morales. The Octolan railroad station was built along the old Ferrocarril San Jer√≥nimo to San Pablo Huixtepec line in 1906. In 1909, a second platform was built. The Virgin of Ocotl√°n A number of important traditions are maintained in the community. The feast of the Virgin of Ocotl√°n is celebrated on 15 May. Most of the festivities take place on the main square of the town with live music and regional food, especially tamales and atole. The feast of the Se√±or de la Sacristia is celebrated on the third Sunday in May. One old tradition that is still maintained is a dancing procession to bring the bride and groom their wedding gifts to their new home. However, the most important tradition is the weekly Friday market day (tianguis), which is one of the oldest and largest in the Central Valleys region of Oaxaca. Produce and products from surrounding towns are available as well as manufactured products. Market day is not just buying and selling for rural and indigenous communities, it is a festive ritual which has been held regularly for thousands of years, attracting both locals and families from small outlying villages to both buy and sell. It is an opportunity for many to socialize with distant neighbors. Market day begins very early for both residents and those who travel to the town to sell. Many products such as plants, flowers, fruit, lime for tortillas, live animals, fabric, ceramics, baskets, knives, saddles, hats, rope, alebrijes, traditional footwear and drinks such as mezcal and tejate. Many of the products are the crafts produced by other towns in the Central Valleys region of Oaxaca, such as textiles of Jalietza, and San Antonino Castillo Velasco and the alebrijes of San Mart√≠n Tilcajete. Prepared regional specialties are also offered here and the adjacent permanent municipal market. Some of the traditional foods here include several types of mole (negro, rojo, Amarillo, coloradito and more), chichilo, tasajo, tamales in banana leaves and tacos with chapulines (fried grasshoppers). Another favorite is ice cream in flavors such as nut, cactus fruit, guanabana, horchata and others. Sweet breads such as \\"mamones\\" \\"rosquitas\\" \\"marquezotes\\" and coconut tortillas are popular as well. Most of the food products are locally made, including chapulines, animal crackers made with piloncillo and ice cream. The eighth campus of the Nova Universitas University, part of the SUNEO system, was inaugurated by Oaxaca governor Ulises Ruiz Ortiz in the city. The college focuses on providing educational opportunities to indigenous populations. Professors give classes both in person at the campus and provide distance learning through big screens in remote classrooms with special monitors to allow student-teacher dialogue. The distance learning scheme allows students in Ocotlan to study with professors from other parts of the state and even attend classes offered in foreign countries. The first degrees offered are Computer Science and Agricultural Science. The school also offered adult and remedial education. The city has a tuna ensemble called the \\"Tuna Universitaria Santo Domingo de Guzman.\\" This group organizes recitals such as the one in December 2009 for Christmas, inviting other tuna ensembles. The ensemble was founded in 1978 with the objective of preserving the music and traditions associated with the musical style and receives funding from Oaxaca state as well as from private sources. Arts and handcrafts =Rodolfo Morales= Shrine to Morales at entrance to museum/monastery The town is intimately linked with the life of painter Rodolfo Morales. He has depicted it in his works and has worked to save many of its historic and architectural treasures. The artist's work is devoted to images from this hometown, including local churches, indigenous women, religious procession and others. Art critic Julio Cesar Schara states that Ocotlan is a down without grace or major heroes but Morales reinvented the area with his own imagination, painting Neoclassic palaces, angels, fairies to express how he felt about the place. One of his last works called \\"Mercados\\" depicts market scenes from the town painted on columns. Rodolfo Morales‚Äô career as an artist developed in fits and starts. In the 1950s, Morales was commissioned to do the mural work in the municipal palace of Ocotlan, painting it with historical and current scenes related to the municipality. Much of this mural work shows similarities to mural work done by Diego Rivera. From that time to the 1970s, Morales remained in obscurity, teaching art privately and for a UNAM affiliated preparatory school. In the 1970s, his work was discovered by Mexican painter Rufino Tamayo, when Morales was in his 50s. This later work was more surreal than that of the mural he painted when he was younger. From the time of his discovery by Tamayo until 1986, Morales continued to work at the preparatory school even though his work was being sold in Europe, Mexico and the United States. In 1986, Morales retired from teaching to paint full-time. The production from this time period brought him fame and fortune, allowing him to sponsor civic projects in his hometown. In 1992, he established the Rodolfo Morales Foundation dedicated to fomenting the culture of Oaxaca and supporting the youth of Ocotlan. The artist died in 2001. Much of the restoration work in the monastery and church were done by Morales himself, including feminizing the angels and making the faces more solemn. While Morales is Ocotl√°n's best known creative mind, the town has been associated with crafts for generations. Some of the crafts still practiced here include basketry, textiles in the form of rebozos and other traditional clothing embroidered in silk thread, blade making, saddlemaking and miniatures in lead. The town is known for its red clay pottery, which is often painted in various colors. Octolan is part of a stretch of road on which are a number of crafts towns such as San Bartolo Coyotepec, San Martin Tilcajete, Santo Tom√°s Jlietza and Santa Ana Zegache. the MEAPO Museum. =Crafts and artisans= While the men dominate the rug-weaving and woodcarving industries in Oaxaca, the women reign with their pottery. This is true in Ocotlan as well. The best known pottery family in Ocotlan is the Aguilar. The dynasty begins with potter Isaura Alcantara Diaz, a potter. Isaura learned the traditional pottery making techniques of the Oaxaca Valley, which was mostly limited to making utilitarian items. She began to experiment with figures and more decorative pieces, with some of her pieces making their way into the Rockefeller collection, but died prematurely at the age of 44. Before she died, she taught potting to her children Josefina, Guillermina, Irene, Concepci√≥n and Jes√∫s. Due to their mother's death, the children began working early, with Josefina being only seven. Poverty prevented the children from attending school. Like their mother, they began and mostly made pots and other kitchen utensils but they also worked to develop clay figures. Over time, these siblings became renowned for their fanciful painted clay figures that celebrate everyday life. Today, these siblings still work and much of the third generation are craftsmen as well. Some, such as Demetrio Garcia Aguilar, are making a name for themselves as well. Josefina Aguilar has been noted for her ceramic work since 1977 when she won the third Premio Nacional de Arte (National Art Prize) in 1977. Later, she would win statewide and other nationwide honors and would show her work internationally in places such as the United States and Europe, and her work can be found around the world. Guillermina Aguilar Alcantara is known for her nativity scenes, wedding scenes, candle sticks and other works done in clay. She and her sister Irene have also won a number of awards and has exported her wears to over a dozen countries. Much of this exporting success was due to a grant by Fomento Cultural Banamex which allowed the family operation to purchase shipping equipment. Apolinar Aguilar Velasco and one of his blades Another known craftsman is Angel Aguilar, who is known for making knives, swords, machetes and the like using the same techniques as those used in the 16th century. Aguilar began making blades when he was ten, taught by his father and uncle. He is now teaching the craft to the next generation.

Other rivers include the Chilana, Santa Rosa, Rio Grande, Riod Chichicapan, San Pablo, Taviche, Atoyac, Guanibay, Rio Bravo, La Garzona, Del Panteon and Paraiso. In addition there are intermittent streams that principally flow during the rainy season. The climate is temperate with some variation in temperature during the year and a moderate rainy season in the summer and early autumn. Most of the municipality's flora and fauna has been disturbed by man, with flat areas converted into farmland or settlements. Forests of pine and ocote still exist in the higher elevations. There are deposits of gold, silver, iron, coal, lead, copper, zinc, antimony, titanium, asbestos and other minerals. Most of the population is involved in agriculture (23%), crafts and manufacturing (28%) and commerce (45%). One major crop is the castor oil plant, along with corn, beans and various fruit trees. Livestock includes cattle, pigs, goats and domestic fowl. There is a processing plant which makes vegetable oil, with mezcal and dairy products produced in small workshops.

The lake was expanded to thirteen acres when the Civilian Conservation Corps replaced the original dam with a larger one. The CCC was active in the park from 1933 until 1942, maintaining forest roads, planting trees, and adding day-use facilities including bathhouse, gazebo, and picnic shelters. The CCC also built cabins for overnight stays and slopes that created the state's first ski resort. The CCC's recreation hall and officers quarters are still in use in the park. Activities and amenities The park's lake offers fishing, swimming, and a boat launch for canoeing and non‚Äìgas-powered boating. The park's of trails are used for hiking, biking, and cross-country skiing. Other amenities include cabins, campsites, nature center, snack bar, and picnicking facilities.

Life He was born on March 28, 1792 in Delaware, the son of Thomas and Mary Allen M'Clintock. Thomas's father was a Presbyterian, and his mother a Quaker, although their marriage resulted in her being removed from the Quaker rolls for marrying out of meeting. Thomas became a druggist or pharmacist, which at the time would have been achieved through an apprenticeship. Thomas became a Quaker by commitment in 1811. At age twenty-two, Thomas began working as a druggist, opening his own store in Philadelphia, and six years later, in 1820, he married Mary Ann Wilson in Burlington, New Jersey. They began their life together in Philadelphia, where they lived for the first seventeen years of their marriage, and where Thomas M'Clintock began his involvement in abolitionism. During their years there, Thomas and Mary Ann had six children, five of whom lived to adulthood. In 1827, M'Clintock co-founded the Free Produce Society of Pennsylvania along with James Mott, Richard Allen, and others and became its first secretary. This predominantly Quaker movement, which included also free African Americans, was an effort to promote the exchange of goods not involving any slave labor. In doing so, the members hoped to create a demand for \\"free\\" produce. The society felt their agenda was a peaceful and reasonable way to combat slavery. Thomas applied those principles throughout his life. That same year M'Clintock was an instrumental force in the Hicksite Schism. This separation among the Quakers resulted from disagreements as to what role doctrine should play in the church, how much one should participate in social activism, and other factors. His extensive knowledge of early Quaker theology was used to form debilitating arguments against Orthodox Quakers. His arguments caused so much tension that even ten years later, in 1836, he and his family chose to move to Waterloo, New York. While there, the M'Clintocks more actively aligned themselves with William Lloyd Garrison and his American Anti-Slavery Society. The M'Clintocks participated in petition campaigns, anti-slavery fairs, hosted numerous anti-slavery speakers and were founding members of the Western New York Anti-Slavery Society. In 1843, Thomas was elected to the board of managers of the American Anti-Slavery Society and later served as a vice president for a number of years. M'Clintock actively championed abolition, temperance, and Native American rights. Thomas and his wife organized anti-slavery petitions, gave refuge to black children, and continued the Free Produce movement. Controversy erupted between moderate and radical members over whether the Society had the right to discipline members for individual acts. As a result, the M'Clintocks organized a new group called the Yearly Meeting of Congregational Friends, which became official in 1853 after the schism of the Society of Friends in 1848. This new group, later renamed the Friends of Human Progress in 1854, had strong ties to the Pennsylvania Yearly Meeting of Progressive Friends. Thomas's wife, Mary Ann, was a major force in organizing the Seneca Falls Convention, the first women's rights convention. She attended the famous tea party in the Hunt where the idea for a convention was first discussed. The original Declaration of Sentiments was then written at the M'Clintock house by Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Mary Ann and probably Elizabeth M'Clintock and Mary M'Clintock. Thomas may have been involved in those discussions, but there is no direct record of that. He did chair one of the sessions of the subsequent convention and gave a speech in support of the declaration. The entire M'Clintock family was involved in the convention, and they even helped to organize a follow-up convention later in August. By 1860, at age sixty-eight, Thomas M'Clintock had moved back to Philadelphia with his family. Thomas returned to his trade as a pharmacist until about 1866. He died on March 19, 1876 at age eighty-three. His wife died eight years later on May 21, 1884. Legacy Thomas M'Clintock is remembered for his contributions to the anti-slavery movement and his impact on the first women's rights movements. The home in Waterloo, New York where the family resided during July 1848 was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980 as the M'Clintock House.

Models for the spread of scientific concepts, ideas, or media driven information have been introduced. Research on gun dynamics and their relationship with recurrent ‚Äúmass‚Äù shootings is being conducted primarily under the leadership of Sherry Towers. Castillo-Chavez has co- authored over 250 publications and a dozen books, textbooks, research monographs and edited volumes. [26] Castillo-Chavez and collaborators carry out research on the role of behavior and mobility on the dynamics of emergent and re-emergent diseases including Ebola, Influenza, Tuberculosis, and Zika. Finally, the dynamics of collaborative and active learning inspired and supported by the deep mentoring efforts carried out via the Mathematical Biology Institute or MTBI, founded in 1996, have resulted in publications that highlight models and frameworks for collaborative learning through user- inspired research.  Founder of the Mathematical and Theoretical Biology Institute or MTBI (1996)  MTBI was originally established in 1996 at Cornell University by Dr. Carlos Castillo-Chavez, before it was moved to Arizona State University in the spring of 2004. MTBI funding was provided by Cornell University and Los Alamos National Laboratory (T-Division) from 1996-2004. Currently, MTBI is funded in part by the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Security Agency (NSA), Arizona State University and the Office of the Executive Vice-President and Provost of the University. The high level of financial and administrative support provided by ASU to MTBI is a reflection of the serious commitment to recruitment and retention efforts within the fields of mathematics and science. https://mtbi.asu.edu/summerprogram MTBI is an intensive summer research experience that prepares undergraduate students for the rigors of graduate level research at the interface of mathematics, statistics, and the natural and social sciences. Select students are invited to Arizona State University for eight weeks, where their time is split between classroom instruction on research methods and hands-on research projects. MTBI has recruited and enrolled a total of 507 regular first-time undergraduate students and 78 advanced (returning) students. Of these regular students 420 are U.S. citizens or permanent residents; 290 (69%) are underrepresented minorities and/or members of the Sloan Pipeline Program (URMs include Hispanic, African American and Native American students). have been provided mentoring (many of these teaching and grad assistants returned to MTBI for multiple years). Through July 2017, 281 out of 420 (67%) of U.S. MTBI student participants had enrolled in graduate or professional school programs (this number includes teaching/graduate assistants who were involved with MTBI over the course of multiple years). Two hundred five (205) are underrepresented minorities (66% of all MTBI US participants who entered graduate or professional schools were URMs). To date 129 US MTBI student participants have completed their Ph.Ds, 97 of whom are URMs; 75% of US MTBI Ph.D. recipients are URMs. Further, taking into consideration gender (as US women are an underrepresented group in the mathematical and life sciences at the doctoral level) the results are even more dramatic. Of the 129 US MTBI student participants who have earned Ph.Ds. 117 (or 90%) belong to an underrepresented minority and/or underrepresented group (including Asian and White/mixed females).  Director of Institute for Strengthening and The Joaquin Bustoz Math-Science Honors Program (JBMSHP)  The Joaquin Bustoz Jr. Math-Science Honors Program (JBMSHP) is a summer residential mathematics program intended for mature and motivated students who are interested in academic careers requiring mathematics, science, or engineering-based coursework and who are typically underrepresented in those fields of study. Selected participants include first-generation college bound students and students representing diverse backgrounds from high schools throughout the State of Arizona, including rural communities and the Navajo Nation. Participants live on the Arizona State University (ASU) Tempe campus while enrolled in a university level mathematics course for college credit such as College Algebra, Pre- Calculus, Calculus I, Calculus II, or Applied Mathematics in the Life and Social Sciences. In addition to the coursework, students work in groups to conduct applied mathematics research involving real-life mathematics problems to help deepen their understanding of the class material. Students present their findings in an oral presentation to their class peers and JBMSHP staff as well as at a poster symposium for faculty, staff, and family members. Tutoring and problem-solving sessions are provided as well as a variety of academic presentations and activities. Tuition, room and board, textbooks, and classroom expenses are provided at no cost to the student. Since 1985, 2,820 students have participated in the JBMSHP. 58% of the participants have been female. 50% are Hispanic, 16% are Native American, 13% are Asian, 13% are Caucasian, and 8% are African American. 35% of the students who attend the JBMSHP attend for multiple summers, earning as many as 11 university credits before enrolling at a university as a first-time freshman. Prof Carlos Castillo-Chavez with student in poster session https://jbmshp.asu.edu/summer_program Since 1985, 59% of all JBMSHP alumni students have attended ASU after their high school graduation. 71% of all JBMSHP alumni currently attending ASU are majoring in a Science, Technology, Engineering, or Mathematics (STEM) field. JBMSHP alumni consistently earn higher grade point averages when compared to non-JBMSHP students at Arizona State University within the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, the Ira A. School of Engineering, and the W.P. Carey School of Business. As of fall 2018, JBMSHP alumni grade point average compared to those non-JBMSHP alumni currently at Arizona State University is 13% higher within the College of Liberal Arts, 11% higher within the Ira A. School of Engineering, and 14% higher within the Mary Lou Fulton Teachers College. As of the fall of 2018, JBMSHP alumni have earned 1,244 degrees from ASU, with 1,079 undergraduate degrees and 165 graduate degrees earned from ASU. 59% of JBMSHP alumni who have earned a degree from ASU are female, 52% are Hispanic, 18% are Asian, 11% are Native American, 12% are Caucasian, and 7% are African American. 159 JBMSHP students have graduated from ASU as part of Barrett, The Honors College. Since 1985, 73% of all JBMSHP alumni who attended ASU earned a degree from ASU.  Carlos Castillo-Chavez' students and The Math Genealogy Project  The Mathematics Genealogy Project (MGP)[30] is an initiative to compile all possible information about the mathematicians in the world, who receive a doctorate degree in mathematics. The project also intends to keep track of the intellectual history of individual and record advisors, universities and areas of study. MGP started in 1996 by Harry Coonce, a mathematician at Mankato State University in Minnesota. The data base considers mathematicians in the most inclusive manner, including people with degrees in mathematics education, statistics, computer science, operations research. The project currently has 239,144 records of mathematicians as of Feb, 2019. The distribution of the number of students is presented in figure below. According to the MGP, 172,959 mathematicians do not have students under their supervision, corresponding to 75,7% of the entire list. 23.5% of mathematicians have had less up to 20 students under their supervision. The page under the name of ‚ÄúExtrema‚Äù [31] lists up to the Top 250 Advisors. Prof. Carlos Castillo-Chavez has currently 50 PhD students, being the only Latino-heritage mathematician listed in the top 250 positions. The probability of having 48 students or more under supervision is just 0,08%, that is, less that 1 per 1.000 mathematicians. Professor Castillo-Chavez‚Äôs name is included in this top 250 list which, includes names like Ronold Wyeth Percival, Rudiger W. Dornbusch, Andrei Kolmogorov, Daron Acemoglu, Robert Solow, Simon A. Levin, Marvin Fisher, C. R. Rao, Jerome Arthur Feldman, Edward Prescott, among others.  Founder of the Simon A. Levin Mathematical, Computational and Modeling Sciences Center or SAL-MCMSC (2008)  Applied Mathematics for the Life and Social Sciences (AMLSS) investigates and integrates complex areas of the physical, life and social sciences while preparing a new generation of students in mathematics. The objective of these programs is to develop critical thinking skills and purposeful competencies in mathematics, as well as an appreciation for the contributions of mathematics to the fields of science, engineering, business, government and economics. The Levin Center members have a history of stimulating synergistic cross-disciplinary activities, and initiating biological, environmental and sociological research that involves a significant use of quantitative methods‚Äîmathematics, modeling, statistics and simulations. The center's name was motivated by the work conducted by Simon A. Levin, Distinguished University Professor in the Department of Ecology and Evolution and the Director of the Center for BioComplexity at Princeton University. Research areas include: * Public Health * Infectious Diseases * Social Dynamics * Human-Environmental Interactions * Theoretical Biology * Applied Mathematics * Statistics and Simulations  Founder of the Applied Mathematics in the Life and Social Sciences Degrees (2008) Ph.D. and BS programs  The Ph.D. program at the Applied Mathematics in the Life and Social Sciences at Arizona State University produces a new generation of scientists with an understanding of global issues and vigorous training in quantitative theory and methods. The graduates come from a wide range of backgrounds and will be able to quickly adapt to the changing employment demands we are already seeing in areas such as homeland security, sustainability and conservation biology, urban system dynamics, public health, disease evolution and addiction, infrastructure and technological research.‚Äù The Applied Mathematics for the Life and Social Sciences (AMLSS) doctoral degree is designed especially for students who want to make innovative and far-reaching scientific contributions to the global challenges of our time. The program's faculty includes mathematicians, statisticians, theoretical biologists and social scientists from five different schools at Arizona State University. The curriculum‚Äîwith dynamic and statistical approaches as critical and unifying components‚Äî is aimed at producing first-rate scientists whose skills will always be in high demand both within and outside of academia. AMLSS graduate students are supported in their work by the members of the MCMSC. AMLSS was established in 2008 and is supported by the Simon A. Levin Mathematical, Computational and Modeling Sciences Center. Its notable accomplishments include graduating 38 doctoral students since its inception (25, or 66%, are underrepresented minorities). Additionally, ASU‚Äôs first ever PhD degree in mathematics to an African American student, Edme Soho, was realized in 2012; the second, to Kehinde Salau, was awarded in 2013. The first to a Native American, Adrian Smith, all were AMLSS students. Within the AMLSS program alone, we have awarded 38 Ph.Ds. since 2008, 25 (66%) to URM students, and anticipate an additional three graduates this year. Of these 38 doctorates, 19 were awarded to Hispanic/Latino students (10 male, nine female), five to African American (Black) males, and one to a Native American male. Two were awarded to White females, and two to international females. Finally, five international males and three white males have attained their doctoral degrees within AMLSS.

He is head coach of the University of Georgia. Early life Smart was born in Montgomery, Alabama, and grew up in Bainbridge, Georgia. Smart began his playing career at Bainbridge High School and went on to play college football at the University of Georgia, where he was teammates with defensive linemen Antonio Cochran, Emarlos Leroy, linebacker Brandon Tolbert, and Pro Football Hall of Fame cornerback Champ Bailey. Smart was a four-year letterman at defensive back for Georgia and a first-team All-SEC selection as a senior. He finished his career with 13 interceptions, which ranks fourth all-time at Georgia, and led the Bulldogs with six interceptions in 1997 and five in 1998. He was also a four-time member of the SEC Academic Honor Roll. Smart graduated from Georgia in 1999 with a degree in finance. He went undrafted in the 1999 NFL Draft and signed a free-agent contract with the Indianapolis Colts. He spent the 1999 preseason with the team but was cut before the start of the regular season. Coaching career =Early career= Smart began his coaching career with the University of Georgia in 1999, serving as an administrative assistant. He then moved to Valdosta State where he spent one season as defensive backs coach before being promoted to defensive coordinator for the 2001 season. From 2002 to 2003, Smart worked as a graduate assistant under Bobby Bowden at Florida State while pursuing a master's degree. He received his master's degree from FSU in 2003. Smart then spent one season as defensive backs coach at LSU under head coach Nick Saban in 2004. Smart rejoined the Georgia Bulldogs football program to serve as running backs coach for the 2005 season. His only season in the NFL came in 2006, during which time he coached under Saban again, this time as the Miami Dolphins safeties coach. =Alabama= Smart followed Nick Saban to the University of Alabama in 2007. He was hired by Saban as an assistant coach on January 9. On February 27, 2008, Smart was promoted to defensive coordinator. On December 8, 2009, Smart was awarded the Broyles Award as the nation's best assistant coach. He was the first Alabama assistant coach to win the award. Alabama would go on to win the BCS National Championship. Smart considered a lucrative contract to be the defensive coordinator at his alma mater, the University of Georgia, but chose to stay with the Crimson Tide in early January 2010. In 2011, Smart's defense helped Alabama win another championship, beating LSU in the 2012 BCS National Championship Game. On March 27, 2012, the University of Alabama System's Board Of Trustees voted to increase Smart's salary and extend his contract. On November 20, 2012, Smart was recognized as the 2012 AFCA FBS Assistant Coach of the Year. Alabama would win another national championship, beating Notre Dame with a bruising defense. On April 16, 2013, Smart was granted a $200,000 salary increase to make him the highest-paid defensive coordinator in college football. =Return to Georgia= On December 6, 2015, Smart was announced as the 26th head football coach at the University of Georgia. Smart went 8‚Äì5 in his first season as the head coach of the Bulldogs in 2016. The Bulldogs finished tied for second in the SEC East division. In the 2017 season, Smart led the Bulldogs to their first 9‚Äì0 start since 1982 and won the SEC East after a victory over the South Carolina Gamecocks on November 4. On December 2, 2017, Smart coached Georgia to its first SEC title since 2005, and only the fourth 12-win season in school history (1980, 2002, 2012). On December 3, Georgia was ranked No. 3 by the College Football Playoff Committee and was set to play No. 2 Oklahoma in the Rose Bowl on New Year's Day. Georgia rallied from a 31‚Äì14 first-half deficit, ultimately defeating Oklahoma 54‚Äì48 in double overtime, completing the largest comeback in Rose Bowl history. The Bulldogs went on to lose to the Alabama Crimson Tide in the College Football Playoff National Championship Game 26-23, where Alabama freshman quarterback Tua Tagovailoa relieved Jalen Hurts late in the contest and ended the game on a 41-yard TD completion to DeVonta Smith in overtime. https://www.espn.com/college-football/game?gameId=400953415 In his 2018 season, Georgia completed the regular season with an 11‚Äì1 record and earned a spot in the 2018 SEC Championship game as the Eastern Division Champions. Georgia would play the Western Division Champions, the Alabama Crimson Tide. Georgia would end up losing 35‚Äì28 against Alabama. Georgia earned an invitation to play in the 85th Sugar Bowl Classic against #15 Texas Longhorns. Texas would beat the #5 Georgia Bulldogs 28-21 and finish the season 11‚Äì3. Personal life Smart was member of the Georgia Beta chapter of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity, and he is married to Mary \\"Beth\\" Elizabeth Lycett, who played basketball for the University of Georgia. The couple has three children, Weston, Julia, and Andrew.

Originally an obscure locality on the edge of Derby, rapid urbanisation and population growth in the 19th century led to it briefly existing as a separately governed local authority between 1860 and 1888, prior to once again being absorbed by its neighbour. History The name Litchurch is of probable Anglo-Saxon origin, and may possibly derive from either Luda's Church or Littlechurch. One theory is that it originally referred to a now lost settlement centred on St Peter's Church in Derby. The earliest reference to Litchurch is in the Domesday Book when it was also one the hundreds of Derbyshire, meaning that at one time it was the meeting place for the hundred court. By 1300, it had been combined with the neighbouring hundred of Morleston.Craven, Maxwell: Derby Street by Street (Breedon Books, Derby, 2005) In 1757 Thomas Borrow, Derby's Town Clerk, married Anne Ault of Loughborough and came into the use of ¬£4,000 and lands and property in Litchurch. Up to the 19th century, Litchurch was a locality within the borough of Derby, however the coming of the railway industry to the area from 1839 onwards was the catalyst for a huge expansion of Derby's population, particularly to the south of the town centre in the area around Derby railway station. The Litchurch area was one of these growing suburbs, to the extent that in 1860 it was extracted from the borough of Derby to become a township in its own right. In 1866 it also became a civil parish. Litchurch's brief independent existence lasted only until 1888 when it was re- absorbed into the newly created county borough of Derby. Since then, it has had no officially defined administrative function. Indeed the use of the name itself has fallen into decline in recent decades, many of the residential streets at the heart of 19th century Litchurch having been obliterated in the 1970s to facilitate the expansion of the neighbouring Derbyshire Royal Infirmary. An early map of Derby dated 1819 shows The Liberty Of Litchurch. A street name-plate located on Normanton Road, next to Grove Street, identifies the area as \\"Normanton Road- Litchurch\\". The area also had a gallows located in what is now Derby Arboretum. Litchurch leant its name to the Midland Railway's Derby Litchurch Lane Works.

In addition to writing books for children around their teens, she also writes for adults, she is the author of the BBC Radio 2 series, My Mammy And Me.  Personal life  MacPhail was married. She has three children, one named Katie, who was the inspiration from her first book. She has two other children. MacPhail says that she would write for free, but she enjoys to get paid for it. On her website, as a child she asks \\"Do you know what an eejit is? Someone who is one sandwich short of a picnic ‚Ä¶ whose lift doesn't go ‚Ä¶ well, you know what I mean.

It was inspired by her youngest daughter, Katie was being bullied at school and she wanted to raise the awareness of how little help is actually available to children who are being bullied. Run, Zan, Run was the winner of the 1994 Kathleen Fidler Award for new Scottish Writing. Catherine's next book was entitled Fighting Back, and was about loan-sharking. Fighting Back won one of the first Scottish Arts Council Children's Book Awards in 1999 . This was followed by the novel Fugitive. She has also written a series of four books entitled Nemesis, which concluded in May 2008.

Bach, whose works and life Schickele purports to study. It is a concerto featuring the aforementioned bagpipes, bicycle and balloons as solo musical instruments accompanied by a string orchestra. Description In Schickele's own words during the introduction, \\"The title, Pervertimento is... not P.D.Q. Bach's own. As a matter of fact, it was not so much a title as an opinion of the people who first played it\\". The piece incorporates several unconventional instruments, and in some cases non-instruments. The bagpipes player uses three radically different incarnations of the instrument; first, the chanter is removed from the bagpipes and played similar to an oboe or clarinet. \\"The tone, though jarring, is not altogether unexpected\\" in the words of the dust jacket for the original LP. In the subsequent movement, a \\"practice bagpipes\\" with the drones removed and the chanter muffled is used. In the final movement, the full bagpipes are employed. Balloons are rubbed and popped through the majority of the piece. For the final chord, three helium balloons, attached to pitchpipes, are released from the percussion section behind the orchestra. The bicycle is \\"played\\" first as a percussion instrument using playing cards in the spokes, then by blowing through the handlebars similar to a trumpet, and finally using pedal power to drive a rotary whistle.

The Canal de Marans √† la Rochelle, also called Canal de Marans, Canal de Rompsay or Canal de La Rochelle depending on the location, is a French canal in the Charente-Maritime department connecting the city of La Rochelle with the town of Marans. It also connects the river of the S√®vre Niortaise to the harbour at La Rochelle. The canal goes through the communes of Dompierre-sur-Mer, Andilly and Sainte- Soulle. It is 24.5 km long, with 4 locks, and has a total denivellation of 1.7 m. It has a width of 5.2 m. The canal was built in the 19th century in order to foster trade between the two cities. It was part of a great project of a North-South canal connecting the river Loire to the Adour. The project was ordered by imperial decision of Napoleon I on July 17, 1805, with the objective of connecting Niort with La Rochelle.Service d√©partemental de l'architecture et du patrimoine de Charente-Maritime. It was started in 1806, but only open in 1875, and only reached La Rochelle in 1888. It was built with the forced labour of prisoners. When it was completed however, the advent of the train (with the establishment of a track between Nantes and La Rochelle) meant that the canal fell into disuse. Navigation on the canal was totally stopped after the Second World War. It is today not navigable. Today the canal allows for picturesque walks between the two cities. It is renowned for its flora and fauna. The waters of the canal discharge into the Maubec reservoir at La Rochelle, just before the tidal bassin, and its waters contribute to scour the harbour and navigable channels.

The variation described below is Perla's Cariocas.  Perla's Cariocas = Objective = The objective of the game is to finish with the smallest number of points, like Golf. =Gameplay= # Two decks of cards with two jokers are used (108 cards total) # The cards are shuffled and each player takes a card from the top. The player that draws the lowest card (aces high) gets to cut the deck. # The person seated to the right shuffles the card and lets the person to the left cut the deck. # The dealer deals to the person to the right of him/her first and around accordingly. # In the next round, the dealer becomes the deck cutter. # The person who cuts the deck tries to cut the deck such that it is exactly the number of the cards to be dealt plus one to start the discard pile. Eleven cards are dealt to each player (except in the last round when thirteen are dealt), so if four people were playing the player would want to cut the deck such that 45 cards are left for the dealer. The other half of the cut deck starts the pile from which players draw cards. If the player cuts perfectly, he receives -10 points. # There are eight rounds. Each round requires that players construct predefined hands in the order shown below under Rounds. # The round is started when the player to the right of the dealer draws from the deck or the discard pile. ## A player may 'steal' the card in the discard pile if all of the players to the left of him/her pass. 2 points are added to the player's score for 'stealing' a card. # When a player constructs all of the specified hands for the round, he/she can lower the hands. If he/she manages to lower the hands and not be left with any cards at the same time, he/she has gone out and is awarded -30 points. If a player manages to discard all of his/her cards in multiple turns, he/she is awarded 0 points.

The unit is an organic element of the 30th Heavy Brigade Combat Team of the North Carolina Army National Guard. Currently, 1st Battalion is the only active battalion in the regiment and is organized as a combined arms battalion under the Brigade Unit of Action table of organization and equipment. The 1st Battalion, 120th Infantry Regiment (1/120th IN) is headquartered in Wilmington, North Carolina. The 2nd Battalion, 120th Infantry Regiment was most famous for its actions in the Battle of Mortain (German: Operation L√ºttich), repelling a German advance and preserving an American breakout from 7‚Äì13 August 1944 as part of the 30th Infantry Division. The 2/120th's actions sustained the American initiative as Allied forces pushed through Northern France after the Normandy invasion.  History  = World War I = The 3rd Regiment of Infantry was called into Federal service on 25 July 1917 after the United States' entry into World War I. Drafted into service on 5 August, it became the 120th Infantry Regiment of the 30th Division on 12 September, while the 2nd Regiment of Infantry became the 119th Infantry. With the 30th Division, the 120th fought in the Somme Offensive, the Ypres-Lys offensive, and the Flanders campaign during the war. Both the 119th and 120th were demobilized at Camp Jackson, South Carolina on 17 April 1919, preceding the demobilization of the division headquarters there on 7 May. = Interwar period = The 119th and 120th were consolidated and reorganized as the 1st Infantry Regiment of the North Carolina National Guard between 1919 and 1921, with headquarters Federally recognized at Raleigh on 2 May 1921. It was soon redesignated as the 120th Infantry Regiment to restore its World War I designation on 8 November of that year, becoming part of the reformed 30th Infantry Division. = World War II = As a result of World War II, the regiment was inducted into Federal service at Raleigh on 16 September 1940. With the 30th Division, it fought in the Normandy campaign, the Northern France Campaign, the Rhineland Campaign, the Ardennes-Alsace Campaign, and the Central Europe Campaign. The 2nd Battalion and Company K received a Distinguished Unit Citation and Croix de Guerre with Palm for their actions in the Mortain counterattack, while the 1st Battalion received a DUC for the advance from Duffescheide to Euchen. After the end of the war, the regiment was inactivated at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, on 24 November 1945. = Cold War = Postwar, the 120th Infantry was reorganized with the 30th Infantry Division in the North Carolina Army National Guard under the command of Shelby attorney Colonel Peyton McSwain, with its headquarters Federally recognized at Reidsville on 22 April 1947. Its previous 1st and 3rd Battalions were consolidated with the 119th Infantry Regiment. Through 1947 and 1948, the remainder of the regiment was reorganized and Federally recognized, based at armories in western North Carolina. Support units included a Service Company at Asheville, a Heavy Mortar Company at Leaksville, a Heavy Tank Company at Waynesville, and a Medical Company at Mocksville. The 1st Battalion, with headquarters at Mount Airy, included Company A at Burlington, Companies B and D at Winston-Salem, and Company C at Lexington. The 2nd Battalion, headquartered at Asheboro, included Company E at Concord, Company F at Albemarle, Company G at Salisbury, and Company H at Hickory. The 3rd Battalion, headquartered at Kings Mountain, included Company I at Newton, Company K at Gastonia, Company L at Morganton, and Company M at Shelby. The regiment participated in its first postwar summer training at Fort Bragg between 11 and 25 July 1948 with most of the 30th Division. After the camp it was estimated at 32% combat readiness by the senior army instructor of the North Carolina National Guard, which meant that in event of war it would not be combat ready for several months. The 1949 summer training was held at Fort Jackson between 14 and 28 August with the division, and the senior army instructor reported that, with 90 percent of the officers and 65 percent of the non-commissioned officers veterans of World War II, the regiment would be ready for combat in at least eight months in event of war. Morganton school superintendent and 3rd Battalion commander Lieutenant Colonel Maston S. Parham was promoted to colonel and became regimental commander on 30 August 1950 following the retirement of McSwain. A 1954 reorganization of the 30th Infantry Division that made it an entirely North Carolina-manned force resulted in the 2 November promotion of Parham to assistant division commander and his replacement by Morganton Colonel Howell J. Hatcher. To bring the division up to strength, a new 139th Infantry Regiment was organized from existing units of the division, resulting in the redesignation of companies of the 120th and the conversion and organization of new units to bring the 120th back up to strength. The regimental Headquarters and Headquarters Company (HHC), the Heavy Mortar Company, and the HHC of 2nd Battalion transferred to the 139th, along with Companies A, F, and C, which became Companies E, F, and G, of the 139th, respectively. Company L of the 120th was redesignated as the regimental HHC, Battery A of the 112th Field Artillery Battalion (FAB) at Forest City was converted into the Heavy Mortar Company, and Companies G, K, I, and M became Companies C, F, G, and K, respectively. Battery B of the 112th FAB at Spindale was converted into the new Company M.NC AG report, 1953‚Äì1954, pp. 150‚Äì152 The new Company L at Hendersonville activated on 8 February 1955, followed by 2nd Battalion HHC at Kannapolis on 15 February, Company I at Sylva on 14 April, and Company A at Elkin on 7 June.NG AG Report 1955‚Äì1956, pp. 5‚Äì6 Recent history The 1/120th, known as the \\"Tusk Hogs,\\" was deployed to combat for the first time in nearly 60 years in early 2004 as part of the 30th Heavy Brigade Combat Team, North Carolina Army National Guard. In Iraq, the 30th HBCT served under the 1st Infantry Division. Brigade headquarters was at FOB Caldwell, east of Baghdad, while the 1/120th battalion headquarters and Charlie Company was based (for most of the deployment) at FOB Bernstein, about 45 miles south of Kirkuk. The brigade, including the 120th, redeployed Dec. 2004 - Feb. 2005. On 6 June 2004 ‚Äì 60 years after the D-Day invasion - soldiers of the 1/120th were awarded right-shoulder unit patches signifying wartime service. The 1/120th lost four soldiers during the 2004 deployment: Spc. Jocelyn Carrasquillo (HHC, 1/120th, 13 MAR 2004, Baghdad), Cpt. Christopher S. Cash (Commander, Alpha Company, 1/120th, 24 JUN 2004, Baqubah); Spc. Daniel A. Desens Jr. (Alpha Company, 1/120th, 24 JUN 2004, Baqubah); and Staff Sgt. Michael S. Voss (HHC, 1/120th, 8 OCT 2004, near Kirkuk). The Tusk Hogs were again called to serve in late 2008. Following training at Camp Shelby, Miss., and Fort Stewart, Ga., the 1st Battalion (Combined Arms), 120th Infantry Regiment deployed with the 30th HBCT to central Iraq in early 2009, this time under the 1st Cavalry Division. The 120th redeployed with the 30th HBCT in January‚ÄìFebruary 2010. Notable members Francis S. Currey earned the Medal of Honor for his actions as a Sergeant in Company K, 120th Infantry Regiment, 30th Infantry Division. On 21 December 1944, in Malmedy, Belgium, Currey repeatedly exposed himself to hostile fire to attack the German forces and rescue five comrades who had been pinned down by enemy fire. He was awarded the Medal of Honor eight months later, on 17 August 1945. Paul Luther Bolden earned the Medal of Honor as a Staff Sergeant in Company I, 120th Infantry Regiment, 30th Infantry Division. On 23 DEC 44, at Petit-Coo, Belgium, he and another soldier advanced on a German-held house. While his comrade provided covering fire from across the street, Bolden tossed grenades through a window, rushed to the door, and began firing. Wounded by the greatly superior number of German soldiers inside, he retreated from the house. Realizing that the Germans would not surrender, he returned to the house despite his serious wounds and killed the remaining soldiers. For these actions, he was awarded the Medal of Honor eight months later, on 30 August 1945. Jack James Pendleton earned the Medal of Honor as a Staff Sergeant in Company I, 120th Infantry Regiment, 30th Infantry Division. On 12 OCT 44, in Bardenberg, Germany, Pendleton voluntarily led his squad in an attack against an enemy machine gun. After being seriously wounded, he continued forward alone, purposely drawing the machine gun's fire so that another squad could advance and destroy the enemy position. Killed by the intense fire from the machine gun, Pendleton was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor six months later, on 6 April 1945. Newscaster David Brinkley served with the 120th Infantry Regiment before and during the early stages of the U.S. involvement in World War II. He was discharged for a medical condition, which prevented him from serving in the war. Distinctive unit insignia The 120th Infantry Regiment's distinctive unit insignia, approved on 28 June 1928, consists of a gold metal and enamel device 1 5/32 inches (2.94 cm) in height overall, consisting of a shield blazoned azure, in pale a prickly pear cactus and the entrance to the canal tunnel over the St. Quentin Canal. Attached below the shield is a blue scroll inscribed VIRTUS INCENDIT VIRES (\\"Virtue Kindles Strength\\") in gold. The shield is blue for infantry. The cactus represents service on the Mexican border as the 3rd Infantry, North Carolina National Guard. The tunnel symbolizes the mouth of the tunnel in the Hindenburg Line at Bellicourt, France, captured by the 120th Infantry on 29 September 1918.

LED power dissipation is modeled as a current source; thermal resistance is modeled as a resistor; and the ambient temperature is modeled as a voltage source. High power light-emitting diodes (LEDs) can use 350 milliwatts or more in a single LED. Most of the electricity in an LED becomes heat rather than light (about 70% heat and 30% light). If this heat is not removed, the LEDs run at high temperatures, which not only lowers their efficiency, but also makes the LED less reliable. Thus, thermal management of high power LEDs is a crucial area of research and development. It is necessary to limit both the junction and the phosphor particles temperatures to a value that will guarantee the desired LED lifetime. An 80W Chip-On-Board COB LED Module from an industrial light luminaire, thermally bonded to the heat-sink Heat transfer procedure In order to maintain a low junction temperature to keep good performance of an LED, every method of removing heat from LEDs should be considered. Conduction, convection, and radiation are the three means of heat transfer. Typically, LEDs are encapsulated in a transparent polyurethane-based resin, which is a poor thermal conductor. Nearly all heat produced is conducted through the back side of the chip. Heat is generated from the p‚Äìn junction by electrical energy that was not converted to useful light, and conducted to outside ambience through a long path, from junction to solder point, solder point to board, and board to the heat sink and then to the atmosphere. A typical LED side view and its thermal model are shown in the figures. The junction temperature will be lower if the thermal impedance is smaller and likewise, with a lower ambient temperature. To maximize the useful ambient temperature range for a given power dissipation, the total thermal resistance from junction to ambient must be minimized. The values for the thermal resistance vary widely depending on the material or component supplier. For example, RJC will range from 2.6 ¬∞C/W to 18 ¬∞C/W, depending on the LED manufacturer. The thermal interface material‚Äôs (TIM) thermal resistance will also vary depending on the type of material selected. Common TIMs are epoxy, thermal grease, pressure-sensitive adhesive and solder. Power LEDs are often mounted on metal-core printed circuit boards (MCPCB), which will be attached to a heat sink. Heat conducted through the MCPCB and heat sink is dissipated by convection and radiation. In the package design, the surface flatness and quality of each component, applied mounting pressure, contact area, the type of interface material and its thickness are all important parameters to thermal resistance design. Passive thermal designs Some considerations for passive thermal designs to ensure good thermal management for high power LED operation include: =Adhesive= Adhesive is commonly used to bond LED and board, and board and heat sinks. Using a thermal conductive adhesive can further optimize the thermal performance. =Heat sink= Heat sinks provide a path for heat from the LED source to outside medium. Heat sinks can dissipate power in three ways: conduction (heat transfer from one solid to another), convection (heat transfer from a solid to a moving fluid, which for most LED applications will be air), or radiation (heat transfer from two bodies of different surface temperatures through Thermal radiation). * Material ‚Äì The thermal conductivity of the material that the heat sink is made from directly affects the dissipation efficiency through conduction. Normally this is aluminum, although copper may be used with an advantage for flat-sheet heat sinks. New materials include thermoplastics that are used when heat dissipation requirements are lower than normal or complex shape would be advantaged by injection molding, and natural graphite solutions which offer better thermal transfer than copper with a lower weight than aluminum plus the ability to be formed into complex two-dimensional shapes. Graphite is considered an exotic cooling solution and does come at a higher production cost. Heat pipes may also be added to aluminum or copper heat sinks to reduce spreading resistance. * Shape ‚Äì Thermal transfer takes place at the surface of the heat sink. Therefore, heat sinks should be designed to have a large surface area. This goal can be reached by using a large number of fine fins or by increasing the size of the heat sink itself. Although a bigger surface area leads to better cooling performance, there must be sufficient space between the fins to generate a considerable temperature difference between the fin and the surrounding air. When the fins stand too close together, the air in between can become almost the same temperature as the fins, so that thermal transmission will not occur. Therefore, more fins do not necessarily lead to better cooling performance. * Surface Finish ‚Äì Thermal radiation of heat sinks is a function of surface finish, especially at higher temperatures. A painted surface will have a greater emissivity than a bright, unpainted one. The effect is most remarkable with flat-plate heat sinks, where about one-third of the heat is dissipated by radiation. Moreover, a perfectly flat contact area allows the use of a thinner layer of thermal compound, which will reduce the thermal resistance between the heat sink and LED source. On the other hand, anodizing or etching will also decrease the thermal resistance. * Mounting method ‚Äì Heat-sink mountings with screws or springs are often better than regular clips, thermal conductive glue or sticky tape. For heat transfer between LED sources over 15 Watt and LED coolers, it is recommended to use a high thermal conductive interface material (TIM) which will create a thermal resistance over the interface lower than 0.2K/W Currently, the most common solution is to use a phase-change material, which is applied in the form of a solid pad at room temperature, but then changes to a thick, gelatinous fluid once it rises above 45 ¬∞C. =Heat pipes and vapor chambers= Heat pipes and vapor chambers are passive, and have effective thermal conductivities ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 W/m K. They can provide the following benefits in LED thermal management:Heat Pipe Integration Strategies for LED Applications * Transport heat to a remote heat sink with minimum temperature drop * Isothermalize a natural convection heat sink, increasing its efficiency and reducing its size. In one case, adding five heat pipes reduced the heat sink mass by 34%, from 4.4 kg to 2.9 kg.LED Thermal Management * Efficiently transform the high heat flux directly under an LED to a lower heat flux that can be removed more easily.Dan Pounds and Richard W. Bonner III, ‚ÄúHigh Heat Flux Heat Pipes Embedded in Metal Core Printed Circuit Boards for LED Thermal Management‚Äù, 2014 IEEE Intersociety Conference on Thermal and Thermomechanical Phenomena in Electronic Systems (ITherm), Orlando, FL, May 27-30, 2014 =PCB (printed circuit board)= * MCPCB ‚Äì MCPCB (Metal Core PCB) are those boards which incorporate a base metal material as heat spreader as an integral part of the circuit board. The metal core usually consists of aluminum alloy. Furthermore MCPCB can take advantage of incorporating a dielectric polymer layer with high thermal conductivity for lower thermal resistance. * Separation ‚Äì Separating the LED drive circuitry from the LED board prevents the heat generated by the driver from raising the LED junction temperature. =Thick-film materials system= * Additive Process ‚Äì Thick film is a selective additive deposition process which uses material only where it is needed. A more direct connection to the Al heat sink is provided; therefore thermal interface material is not needed for circuit building. Reduces the heat spreading layers and thermal footprint. Processing steps are reduced, along with the number of materials and amount of materials consumed. * Insulated Aluminum Materials System ‚Äì Increases thermal connectivity and provides high dielectric breakdown strength. Materials can be fired at less than 600 ¬∞C. Circuits are built directly onto aluminum substrates, eliminating the need for thermal interface materials. Through improved thermal connectivity, the junction temperature of the LED can be decreased by up to 10 ¬∞C. This allows the designer to either decrease the number of LEDs needed on a board, by increasing the power to each LED; or decrease the size of the substrate, to manage dimensional restrictions. It is also proven that decreasing the junction temperature of the LED dramatically improves the LED‚Äôs lifetime. =Package type= * Flip chip ‚Äì The concept is similar to flip-chip in package configuration widely used in the silicon integrated circuit industry. Briefly speaking, the LED die is assembled face down on the sub-mount, which is usually silicon or ceramic, acting as the heat spreader and supporting substrate. The flip-chip joint can be eutectic, high- lead, lead-free solder or gold stub. The primary source of light comes from the back side of the LED chip, and there is usually a built-in reflective layer between the light emitter and the solder joints to reflect up the light which is emitted downward. Several companies have adopted flip-chip packages for their high-power LED, achieving about 60% reduction in the thermal resistance of the LED while keeping its thermal reliability. =LED filament= The LED filament style of lamp combines many relatively low-power LEDs on a transparent glass substrate, coated with phosphor, and then encapsulated in silicone. The lamp bulb is filled with inert gas, which convects heat away from the extended array of LEDs to the envelope of the bulb. This design avoids the requirement for a large heat sink.  Active thermal designs  Some works about using active thermal designs to realize good thermal management for high power LED operation include: = Thermoelectric (TE) device = Thermoelectric devices are a promising candidate for thermal management of high power LED owing to the small size and fast response. A TE device made by two ceramic plates can be integrated into a high power LED and adjust the temperature of LED by heat-conducting and electrical current insulation. Since ceramic TE devices tend to have a coefficient of thermal expansion mismatch with the silicon substrate of LED, silicon-based TE devices have been invented to substitute traditional ceramic TE devices. Silicon owning higher thermal conductivity (149 W/(m¬∑K)) compared with aluminum oxide(30 W/(m¬∑K)) also makes the cooling performance of silicon- based TE devices better than traditional ceramic TE devices. The cooling effect of thermoelectric materials depends on the Peltier effect. When an external current is applied to a circuit composed of n-type and p-type thermoelectric units, the current will drive carriers in the thermoelectric units to move from one side to the other. When carriers move, heat also flows along with the carriers from one side to the other. Since the direction of heat transfer relies on the applied current, thermoelectric materials can function as a cooler with currents that drive carriers from the heated side to the other side. A typical silicon-based TE device has a sandwich structure. Thermoelectric materials are sandwiched between two substrates made by high thermal conductivity materials. N-type and p-type thermoelectric units are connected sequentially in series as the middle layer. When a high power LED generates heat, the heat will first transfer through the top substrate to the thermoelectric units. With an applied external current, the heat will then be forced to flow to the bottom substrate through the thermoelectric units so that the temperature of the high power LED can be stable. = Liquid cooling system = Cooling systems using liquids such as liquid metals, water, and stream also actively manage high power LED's temperature. Liquid cooling systems are made up of a driving pump, a cold plate, and a fan-cooled radiator. The heat generated by a high power LED will first transfer to liquids through a cold plate. Then liquids driven by a pump will circulate in the system to absorb the heat. Lastly, a fan-cooled radiator will cool the heated fluids for the next circulation. The circulation of liquids manages the temperature of the high power LED.

Red River Frame was a popular name for the post-and- plank construction technique used in the Red River Colony in the 19th Century. The building style was characterized by a dressed timber structure with a horizontal log infill. The spaces between the logs were filled or 'chinked' with clay and straw. The exterior would either be whitewashed with a limestone/water plaster mixture, or in later years, the exterior would be covered by board siding. This style was popular because it could use smaller trees for logs--the longest trees needed were for the vertical logs. The Farm Manager's House at Lower Fort Garry, the William Brown House at the Historical Museum of St James--Assiniboia, the historical Fur Warehouse at Fort St. James National Historic Site of Canada and Riel House in Winnipeg, Manitoba are excellent examples of Red River Frame construction.

History  A pair of ivory candlesticks with a wooden presentation box that was gifted to American President Gerald Ford by Liberian President William R. Tolbert. U.S. relations with Liberia date back to 1819, when the US Congress appropriated $100,000 for the establishment of Liberia. However, although Liberia declared its independence in 1847, United States Senators from Southern states prevented its recognition as a sovereign nation until 1862, during the American Civil War, after the entire Southern delegation in Congress had departed. The two nations shared very close diplomatic, economic, and military ties until the 1990s. =U.S. assists Americo-Liberians= The United States had a long history of intervening in Liberia's internal affairs; sending naval vessels to help the ruling Americo- Liberian minority suppress insurrections by indigenous tribes in 1821, 1843, 1876, 1910 and 1915. By 1909, Liberia faced serious external threats to its sovereignty from the European colonial powers over unpaid foreign loans and annexation of its borderlands. President William Howard Taft devoted a considerable portion of his First Annual Message to Congress (December 7, 1909) to the Liberian question, noting the close historical ties between the two countries that gave an opening for a wider intervention: : \\"It will be remembered that the interest of the United States in the Republic of Liberia springs from the historical fact of the foundation of the Republic by the colonization of American citizens of the African race. In an early treaty with Liberia, there is a provision under which the United States may be called upon for advice or assistance. Pursuant to this provision and in the spirit of the moral relationship of the United States to Liberia, that Republic last year asked this Government to lend assistance in the solution of certain of their national problems, and hence the Commission was sent across the ocean on two cruisers. In 1912 the U.S. arranged a 40-year international loan of $1.7 million, against which Liberia had to agree to four Western powers (America, Britain, France, and Germany) controlling Liberian Government revenues for the next 14 years, until 1926. American administration of the border police also stabilized the frontier with Sierra Leone and checked French ambitions to annex more Liberian territory. The American Navy also established a coaling station in Liberia, cementing its presence. When World War I started, Liberia declared war on Germany and expelled its resident German merchants, who constituted the country's largest investors and trading partners. Liberia suffered economically as a result. In 1926, the Liberian government gave a concession to the American rubber company Firestone to start the world‚Äôs largest rubber plantation at Harbel, Liberia. At the same time, Firestone arranged a $5 million private loan to Liberia.R.J. Harrison Church, \\"The Firestone rubber plantations in Liberia.\\" Geography 54.4 (1969): 430-437. onlineGeorge Dalton, \\"History, politics, and economic development in Liberia.\\" Journal of Economic History 25.4 (1965): 569-591. online In the 1930s Liberia was again virtually bankrupt, and, after some American pressure, agreed to an assistance plan from the League of Nations. As part of this plan, two key officials of the League were placed in positions to ¬¥advise¬¥ the Liberian government.W.E. Burghardt Du Bois, \\"Liberia, the League, and the United States.\\" Foreign affairs 11.4 (1933): 682-695. online Ever since President Taft, American support for Liberian independence, prosperity, and reform were priorities. The major American role was training the Liberian army (known as the Liberian Frontier Force, using elite black officers from the regular United States Army. The American presence warned away European imperial powers, defeated a series of local rebellions, and helped bring in American technology to develop the resource-rich interior. Democracy was not a high priority, as the 15,000 Americano-Liberians had full control of 750,000 locals. The Krus and Greboe tribes remained highly reluctant to accept control from Monrovia, but they were not powerful enough to overcome a regime strongly supported by the United States Army and Navy. The American officers including Charles Young, Benjamin Davis, and others were skilled at training recruits, helping the government minimize corruption, and advocating loans from American corporations while monitoring the resulting flow of funds.Brian G. Shellum, African American Officers in Liberia: A Pestiferous Rotation, 1910‚Äì1942 (2018) pp xii, 205-12. Excerpt =World War II= President Edwin Barclay (right) and U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt during World War II, January 1943 During World War II, Liberia joined the Allies and Monrovia was host to important Allied logistics bases. Firestone was a large munitions supplier for the Allies. =Since 1970= Liberian and United States relationships became strained between 1971 and 1980 due to Liberian president William R. Tolbert's establishment of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and other Eastern Bloc countries. In 1978, United States president Jimmy Carter made the first official presidential visit to Liberia. During the 1980s, the United States forged especially close ties with Liberia as part of a Cold War effort to suppress Communist movements in Africa. Samuel Doe's government was seen by American strategists as being especially important to their Cold War policies in Africa and his government received between $500 million and $1.3 billion during the 1980s from the U.S. through direct and indirect channels. Furthermore, Liberia was home to a relay station for Voice of America, a large navigation tower, and the CIA's main African base for the majority of this period. Liberian President Tolbert and U.S. President Jimmy Carter (in car, left) in Monrovia The rise of Charles Taylor's government, the Liberian Civil War, regional instability and human rights abuses interrupted the previously close relations between Liberia and the United States. Charles Taylor's election in 1997 was monitored by the Economic Community of West African States and the United States officially recognized the result and the new government. However, during Taylor's presidency, the United States cut direct financial and military aid to the Liberian government, withdrew Peace Corps operations, imposed a travel ban on senior Liberian Government officials, and frequently criticized Charles Taylor's government. Much of the Liberian- American tension from this period stems from the Liberian government's acknowledged support for the Revolutionary United Front, a rebel group in Sierra Leone and surrounding region. Due to intense pressure from the international community and the United States, along with Liberian civic organizations like the Women of Liberia Mass Action for Peace, Charles Taylor resigned his office on August 11, 2003. The resignation and exile of Charles Taylor in 2003 brought changes in diplomatic ties between the United States and Liberia. On July 30, 2003, the United States proposed a UN Security Council draft resolution to authorize the deployment of a multi-national stabilization force.Taylor sets date to step down, CNN, August 2, 2003 Despite stated concerns about prosecution in the International Criminal Court, United States president George W. Bush sent 200 marines to Monrovia's airport to support the peace-keeping effort. The United States also deployed warships along Liberia's coast as part of the stabilization effort. The United States committed $1.16 billion to Liberia between the years of 2004 and 2006.Liberian president invites rebels into government, CNN, August 12, 2003 USAID The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) implements the U.S. Government's development assistance program. USAID's post-conflict rebuilding strategy focuses on reintegration and is increasingly moving towards a longer- term development focus. Rehabilitation efforts include national and community infrastructure projects, such as building roads, refurbishing government buildings, and training Liberians in vocational skills. USAID also funds basic education programs, improving education for children, focusing on girls, and training teachers. In the health area, USAID programs include primary health care clinics, HIV/AIDS prevention, and a large malaria program. USAID supports rule of law programs, establishing legal aid clinics and victim abuse centers, training judges and lawyers, community peace building and reconciliation efforts, and anti-corruption projects to promote transparency and accountability in public sector entities. USAID is also providing support to strengthen the legislature and other political processes. USAID is strengthening civil society's role in delivering services and advocating good governance. Total USAID funding program for these programs in FY 2007 was $65.9 million. In 2009, a 17.5 million dollar contract was offered to Liberia with the International Foundation for Electoral Systems as the conduit. This money is meant to support the 2011 general elections and 2014 Senate elections. U.S. officials Principal U.S. Officials include: * Ambassador‚ÄîChristine A.

He was also the ninth ruler of Jin in the Spring and Autumn period and the second duke of Jin. When his father, Duke Wu of Jin, died in 677 BC, Guizhu ascended the throne of Jin and became Duke Xian of Jin. He reigned for 26 years. He moved the capital from Quwo (Êõ≤Ê≤É) to Jiang (Áµ≥). He was named after a Rongdi tribe (ÊàéÁãÑÊóè) leader Guizhu (Ë©≠Ë´∏) whom his father, Duke Wu of Jin, captured alive. During his reign, the State of Jin was one of the most powerful and largest states due to his conquests in many small neighboring states. He is also renowned for the slaughter and exile of many royal family members of Jin and for favoring one of his concubines named Li Ji. Rise to Power When he ascended the throne, Duke Xian of Jin and the duke of Guo visited King Hui of Zhou and they were given rewards which resulted to the increase of their popularity throughout the states. He also adopted a strategy that his official, Shi Wei (Â£´Ëíç), suggested which involves the slaughter and exile of almost all the royal family members of Jin to ensure that the throne of Jin will always be held by one of his descendants. This resulted to the increase of the power of the duke and the loss of political power of the clan of the duke since the clan was almost annihilated. To increase the military power of the state, he expanded his army into 2 troops, each having 10,000 men (some say 12,500). In 672 BC, the fifth year of his reign, he eliminated the Li Rong tribe and he obtained two women from the tribe: Li Ji and her younger sister, Shao Ji (Â∞ëÂß¨). Both women were favored by Duke Xian of Jin. In 665 BC, the twelfth year of his reign, Li Ji gave birth to Xiqi. Since Duke Xian of Jin favored Li Ji, he had a desire to dethrone Shensheng, the eldest son of Duke Xian of Jin, from his position as crown prince to make Prince Xiqi the crown prince instead, so he sent Prince Shensheng to defend Quwo, modern Quwo County in Shanxi. Duke Xian of Jin also sent Prince Chong'er to defend the city of Pu and Prince Yiwu to Erqu (‰∫åÂ±à), modern Ji County in Shanxi. In 661 BC, the sixteenth year of his reign, he conquered the state of Geng (ËÄø), the state of Huo (Èúç), the old state of Wei (È≠è) and the Rongdi tribe. The Jin official Bi Wan (Áï¢Ëê¨) was given the land of the old state of Wei, and his descendants will later establish the new state of Wei. The Jin official Zhao Su (Ë∂ôÂ§ô) helped conquer the state of Huo so he was given the land of the state of Geng and his descendants will later establish the state of Zhao. (Altogether Duke Xian annexed 17 states and subjugated 38 others.) Li Ji Rebellion In 656 BC, the 21st year of his reign, Li Ji plotted a scheme for Shensheng which caused him to go back to Quwo to offer sacrifices for his deceased mother, Qi Jiang (ÈΩäÂßú). After the sacrifice, he gave some of the food to the palace for his father, Duke Xian of Jin. Li Ji secretly placed poison on them and when Duke Xian of Jin discovered that the food was poisoned, he assumed that Prince Shensheng plotted to kill him. Duke Xian of Jin then sent men to capture Prince Shensheng. When Prince Shensheng heard that his father sent men to capture him, he committed suicide on the twelfth month of that year. After Prince Shensheng committed suicide, Li Ji falsely accused Prince Chong'er and Yiwu of revolting so they escaped to Pu (Ëí≤) and Erqu (‰∫åÂ±à) respectively. In 655 BC, the 22nd year of his reign, Duke Xian of Jin sent troops to Pu and Erqu to capture Chong'er and Yiwu. Chong'er escaped to the Di tribe, where his mother was from, and Prince Yiwu also escaped. Conquests of Yu and Guo The neighboring State of Guo frequently attacked the border of Jin. Duke Xian wished to overthrow Guo, but needed passage through the State of Yu (ËôûÂúã), which was allied with Guo, to do so. On the advice of his officer, Xun Xi (ËçÄÊÅØ), Duke Xian sent beautiful women to the Duke of Guo and a beautiful young man to the Duke of Yu with instructions to distract the rulers from government affairs.Hinsch, Bret. (1990). Passions of the Cut Sleeve. University of California Press. p.31 At the same time, men were sent to cause trouble on Guo's northern border. As expected, officials in Guo blamed Duke Xian for the new trouble they were encountering on the northern border. Feigning insult, Duke Xian sent officer Xun Xi to the State of Yu to request passage so that they could avenge the insult. Bringing gifts of jade and horses, Xun Xi arrived in the State of Yu to request passage. Under the influence of his new beloved, the Duke of Yu immediately agreed, over the protestations of his own official, Gong Zhiqi (ÂÆÆ‰πãÂ•á). Gong Zhiqi described the relationship of Yu and Guo with the Chinese proverb \\"The teeth are cold when the lips are lost\\" (). He told the Duke of Yu that if Guo were conquered, Yu would be next. The Duke of Yu ignored his warning and Gong Zhiqi secretly left the state of Yu, foreseeing its destruction. In 658 BC, the 19th year of his reign, Duke Xian of Jin sent his general Li Ke (ÈáåÂÖã) and his officer Xun Xi to attack the State of Guo during the reign of Duke Chou of Guo (Ëô¢ÂÖ¨ÈÜú). Ever more favorable to Jin, the Duke of Yu assisted in the invasion. He sent his own army to capture Xiayang Pass (‰∏ãÈôΩÈóú) for Jin, under the ruse that his army was there to subdue the rebellious Quanrong tribe. In the winter of 655 BC, the 22nd year of his reign, the State of Guo was conquered by Jin. The Duke of Yu was given a part of the women and treasures sacked from Guo. Li Ke was then granted permission to station the Jin army outside the Yu capital to rest. After a few days, the Duke of Yu was suddenly informed that Duke Xian of Jin was outside the city wall of the Yu capital. The Duke of Yu quickly went out to greet him and Duke Xian of Jin invited the Duke of Yu to the Ji Mountain (ÁÆïÂ±±) to hunt. In an ostentatious display, perhaps still under the influence of the beloved planted at his court by Duke Xian, the Duke of Yu brought the entire military force stationed in the capital to the hunt in the Ji Mountain. While hunting, the Yu officer Baili Xi reported to the Duke of Yu trouble at the capital. By the time the Duke of Yu arrived at the outskirts of the city, the Yu capital has already been captured by the Jin army. The Duke of Yu and Baili Xi were held captive and brought back to the State of Jin. Baili Xi was recognized as a good officer by Duke Xian of Jin but Baili Xi rejected every offer given to him to become a court official of Jin. He was later given to the state of Qin as a servant dowry with Princess Bo Ji (‰ºØÂß¨). (The use of Yu to attack Guo was one of the Thirty-Six Stratagems). Later years In 654 BC, the 23rd year of his reign, Duke Xian of Jin sent troops to attack Erqu and capture Prince Yiwu, but Prince Yiwu fled to the State of Liang. In 652 BC, the 25th year of his reign, he sent troop to attack the Di tribe and capture Prince Chong'er, but the army retreated when they met resistance. In that same year, the younger sister of Li Ji, also a concubine of Duke Xian of Jin, gave birth to Prince Zhuo. At that time, the State of Jin was one of the largest and most powerful state in China. According to the Records of the Grand Historian, the Jin territory at that time extends west to the Hexi (Ê≤≥Ë•ø) region (the region that extends from Shaanxi province to the west) and to the boundary of the western State of Qin, north to the Di tribe, and east to the Henei (Ê≤≥ÂÖß) region (roughly the southern part of Hebei province). Death and legacy In the summer of 651 BC, the 26th year of his reign, Duke Huan of Qi held an alliance meeting in Kuiqiu (Ëëµ‰∏ò), west of modern Minquan County in Shanxi. Duke Xian of Jin did not attend because he was sick at that time and Zaikong (ÂÆ∞Â≠î) of Zhou advised him not to attend. Since he was gravely ill, he entrusted the then Crown Prince Xiqi to Xun Xi (ËçÄÊÅØ) and also gave Xun Xi the position of the chancellor of Jin. Duke Xian of Jin died on the ninth month of that year. After the death of Duke Xian of Jin on the ninth month of 651 BC, Li Ji placed the 15-year-old Crown Prince Xiqi on the throne of Jin and made Xun Xi the chancellor of Xiqi to help him in government affairs. On the tenth month of 651 BC, Li Ke (ÈáåÂÖã) killed Xiqi roughly a month after his ascension. Duke Xian of Jin was not yet properly buried at that time. Xun Xi then placed Prince Zhuozi into the throne of Jin even though Zhuozi was still a toddler at that time. After that, Xun Xi finished the burial of Duke Xian of Jin. On the eleventh month of 651 BC, Li Ke killed Zhuozi and his aunt Li Ji. Xun Xi then committed suicide by hanging himself. Shao Ji, the younger sister of Li Ji and mother of Prince Zhuozi, was imprisoned. Li Ke then invited Prince Chong'er who was then in the State of Qi back to the State of Jin to become the next duke. Chong'er declined so Li Ke then invited Prince Yiwu who was then in the State of Liang and he accepted. Prince Yiwu ascended the throne of Jin and became Duke Hui of Jin. According to historical records, Duke Xian of Jin had six wives. The first was Jia Jun (Ë≥àÂêõ) from the State of Jia (Ë≥àÂúã). Another is Qi Jiang (ÈΩäÂßú), formerly the concubine of Duke Wu of Jin, who gave birth to Princess Bo Ji (‰ºØÂß¨) and Shensheng. He also had Hu Ji (ÁãêÂß¨) from the northern Rong tribe (Êàé) who gave birth to Chong'er. Another was the younger sister of Hu Ji who gave birth to Prince Yiwu. Then there was Li Ji from the Lirong tribe who gave birth to Prince Xiqi. Lastly, there was Shao Ji (Â∞ëÂß¨), the younger sister of Li Ji, who gave birth to Prince Zhuo.

Relations are today cordial and cooperative, with particularly strong security cooperation only after the 2012 attack on the US liaison office or mission in Benghazi. Furthermore, a Gallup poll conducted in March and April 2012 found that Libyans had \\"among the highest approval\\" of US leadership in the entire Middle East and North Africa region. However, for decades prior to the 2011 Libyan Civil War, the countries were not on good terms and engaged each other in several military skirmishes. The Libyan government of Muammar Gaddafi funded terror operations against the United States, most notably the 1986 Berlin discotheque bombing, to which the United States retaliated by bombing Libya, and the 1988 Lockerbie bombing. When the Libyan civil war broke out in 2011, the United States took part in a military intervention in the conflict, aiding anti-Gaddafi rebels with air strikes against the Libyan Army. With the success of the revolution and the overthrow of Gaddafi, US President Barack Obama said that the United States was \\"committed to the Libyan people\\" and promised partnership in the development of a new Libyan state. According to a 2012 poll conducted by Gallup, 54% of Libyans approve of U.S. leadership, compared to only 22% and 19% respective approval for China and Russia's, and 75% of Libyans say they approved of NATO's military intervention in the civil war.Opinion Briefing: Libyans Eye New Relations With the West Gallup The U.S. began operations in Libya again on November 13, 2015 with permission from the GNA, as part of the military intervention against ISIL.  History  = Kingdom of Libya (1951‚Äì1969) = Vice President Richard Nixon meeting King Idris of Libya in 1957. The king sought cordial relations with the U.S. Following Italy's colonial occupation of Libya and the German occupation during World War II the U.S. leased the strategically important Wheelus Air Base from the Kingdom of Libya. The United States supported the UN resolution providing for Libyan independence in 1951 and accordingly raised the status of its office at Tripoli from a consulate general to a legation. Libya opened a legation in Washington, D.C., in 1954. Both countries subsequently raised their missions to embassy level. Oil was discovered in Libya in 1959, and what had been one of the world's poorest countries became comparatively wealthy. The United States continued a generally warm relationship with Libya and pursued policies centered on interests in operations at Wheelus Air Base and the considerable U.S. oil interests. During the early 1960s, many children of U.S. oil personnel sent to develop the oil field installations and pipelines were allowed to attend the high school facility at Wheelus, typically riding buses from residential areas in or near Tripoli. Classes often had to pause briefly while large aircraft were taking off. The strategic value of Wheelus as a bomber base declined with the development of nuclear missiles and Wheelus served as a tactical fighter training facility in the 1960s. In September 1969 King Idris I was overthrown by a group of military officers centered around Muammar Gaddafi. Before the revolution, the U.S. and Libya had already reached agreement on U.S. withdrawal from Wheelus; this proceeded according to plan, and the facility was turned over to the new Libyan authorities on June 11, 1970. = Libya under Gaddafi (1969‚Äì2011) = After Muammar Gaddafi's 1969 coup, U.S.-Libyan relations became increasingly strained when Gaddafi removed the American oil companies by nationalizing the oil industry. In 1972, the United States recalled its ambassador. Export controls on military and civil aircraft were imposed during the 1970s, and U.S. embassy staff members were withdrawn from Tripoli after a mob attacked and set fire to the embassy in December 1979. The U.S. Government designated Libya a \\"state sponsor of terrorism\\" on December 29, 1979. Throughout the 1970s Gaddafi was a vocal supporter of the Palestinians and anti-Israeli Arab governments and he supported the Arab states during the Yom Kippur War and the Arab Oil Embargo.  Gulf of Sidra incident  On August 19, 1981, the Gulf of Sidra incident occurred. Two Libyan Sukhoi Su-22 jets fired on U.S. aircraft participating in a routine naval exercise over international waters of the Mediterranean claimed by Libya. The U.S. planes returned fire and shot down the attacking Libyan aircraft. On December 11, 1981, the U.S. State Department invalidated U.S. passports for travel to Libya and, for purposes of safety, advised all U.S. citizens in Libya to leave. In March 1982, the U.S. Government prohibited imports of Libyan crude oil into the United States and expanded the controls on U.S.-origin goods intended for export to Libya. Licenses were required for all transactions, except food and medicine. In March 1984, U.S. export controls were expanded to prohibit future exports to the Ras Lanuf petrochemical complex. In April 1985, all Export-Import Bank financing was prohibited. United States adopted additional economic sanctions against Libya in January 1986, including a total ban on direct import and export trade, commercial contracts, and travel-related activities. In addition, Libyan Government assets in the United States were frozen. When Libyan complicity was reported in the 1986 Berlin discotheque bombing, which killed two American servicemen, the United States responded by launching an aerial bombing attack against targets near Tripoli and Benghazi in April 1986 (see Operation El Dorado Canyon). At least 15 people died in the U.S. air strikes on Libya ‚Äì including leader Colonel Gaddafi's adopted 15-month-old daughter ‚Äì and more than 100 were injured. Subsequently, the United States maintained its trade and travel embargoes and brought diplomatic and economic pressure to bear against Libya. This pressure helped to bring about the Lockerbie settlement and Libya's renunciation of WMD and MTCR-class missiles. In 1991, two Libyan intelligence agents were indicted by federal prosecutors in the U.S. and Scotland for their involvement in the December 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 near Lockerbie, Scotland. In January 1992, the UN Security Council approved Resolution 731 demanding that Libya surrender the suspects, cooperate with the Pan Am 103 and UTA 772 investigations, pay compensation to the victims' families, and cease all support for terrorism. Libya's refusal to comply led to the approval of UNSC Resolution 748 on March 31, 1992, imposing sanctions designed to bring about Libyan compliance. Continued Libyan defiance led to passage of Security Council Resolution 883‚Äîa limited assets freeze and an embargo on selected oil equipment‚Äîin November 1993. In March 2003, Tripoli secretly approached Washington and London with an offer to reveal the scope of its WMD programs. This led to covert negotiations in Libya, which in turn resulted, on December 19, 2003, in the country's public disclosure of the extent of their WMD research and capabilities. UN sanctions had been lifted on September 12, 2003, after Libya fulfilled all remaining UNSCR requirements pertaining to the Lockerbie bombing, including renunciation of terrorism, acceptance of responsibility for the actions of its officials, and payment of appropriate compensation to the victims' families.  Normalizing relations  After its public announcement of December, 2003, the Gaddafi government cooperated with the U.S., the U.K., the International Atomic Energy Agency, and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons toward these objectives. Libya also signed the IAEA Additional Protocol and has become a State Party to the Chemical Weapons Convention. Libyan National Security Adviser Mutassim Gaddafi with Hillary Clinton in 2009 In recognition of these actions, the U.S. began the process of normalizing relations with Libya. The U.S. terminated the applicability of the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act to Libya and the President signed an Executive Order on September 20, 2004 terminating the national emergency with respect to Libya and ending IEEPA-based economic sanctions. This action had the effect of unblocking assets blocked under the Executive Order sanctions. Restrictions on cargo aviation and third-party code-sharing have been lifted, as have restrictions on passenger aviation. Certain export controls remain in place. U.S. diplomatic personnel reopened the U.S. Interest Section in Tripoli on February 8, 2004. In the same month, the U.S. State Department lifted the 23-year travel ban on Libya. The U.S. Interest Section was upgraded to a U.S. Liaison Office on June 28, 2004, and to a full embassy on May 31, 2006. The establishment in 2005 of an American School in Tripoli demonstrates the increased presence of Americans in Libya, and the continuing normalization of bilateral relations. Libya re-established its diplomatic presence in Washington with the opening of an Interest Section on July 8, 2004, which was subsequently upgraded to a Liaison Office in December 2004 and to a full embassy on May 31, 2006. On May 15, 2006, the US State Department announced its intention to rescind Libya's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism in recognition of the fact that Libya had met the statutory requirements for such a move: it had not provided any support for acts of international terrorism in the preceding six-month period, and had provided assurances that it would not do so in the future. On June 30, 2006, the U.S. rescinded Libya's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism. See p. 553. In July 2007, Mr. Gene Cretz was nominated by President Bush as ambassador to Libya. The Foreign Relations Committee of the U.S. Senate held Cretz's confirmation hearing on Wednesday, September 25, 2008. The Libyan government satisfied its responsibility and paid the remaining amount of money it owed (total of $1.5 billion) to the victims of several acts of terrorism on Friday, October 31, 2008. That same year, the United States and Libya also signed a bilateral Agreement on Science and Technology Cooperation. Principal U.S. Officials included Charg√© d'Affaires William Milam and Deputy Principal Officer J. Christopher Stevens. The U.S. Embassy in Libya is temporarily located at the Corinthia Bab Africa Hotel, Souk al-Thulatha, Al-Gadim, Tripoli. The U.S. consular representative's office is also located at the Corinthia Bab Africa Hotel. Limited services are available for U.S. citizens.  2011 Libyan Civil War  Relations were again severely strained by the outbreak of the 2011 Libyan Civil War, in which Gaddafi attempted to crush first protests, and then an armed rebellion against his rule. The U.S. government cut ties with the Gaddafi regime, and enacted sanctions against senior regime members. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said that the legitimacy of Gaddafi's regime had been \\"reduced to zero\\". The US, along with several European and Arab nations, then began to call for the United Nations to authorise military intervention in the conflict. US ambassador to the UN Susan Rice successfully pressured Russia and China not to veto the resolution, and it passed on March 17, 2011. The US military played an instrumental role in the initial stage of the intervention, suppressing Libyan air defenses and coordinating international forces in the establishment of a no-fly zone over Libya, before handing command responsibility to NATO and taking a supporting role in the campaign of air strikes against pro-Gaddafi forces. The intervention severely weakened the Gaddafi regime and aided the rebels to victory, with the fall of Tripoli in August 2011. = Post-Gaddafi Libya (2011‚Äìpresent) = U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and Transitional Libyan Prime Minister Abdurrahim El-Keib, conduct a press conference in Tripoli, Libya on Dec. 17, 2011. Representatives sign a Memorandum of Understanding on cultural property protection in 2018 The United States' first direct contact with the anti-Gaddafi opposition came on March 14, 2011 when Secretary of State Hillary Clinton met with National Transitional Council leader Mahmoud Jibril in Paris. The US took longer than other leading NTC allies to formally recognise the council as Libya's legitimate authority, but it did so on July 15, and it granted accreditation to Ali Aujali as the Libyan Ambassador to the United States on August 15. Later that month, the US led an effort at the United Nations to repeal parts of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1970 in order to allow unfrozen Libyan assets to be transferred to the interim government. When the civil war came to an end in October, US President Barack Obama pledged to work with the new Libyan government as a partner, and said the United States was \\"committed to the Libyan people\\". US relations with the new Libyan government were thrust into the spotlight on September 11, 2012 when gunmen attacked and firebombed the US liaison office/mission in Benghazi, killing 4 Americans including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens. Libya's interim leader Mohammed Magarief quickly condemned the attack and apologised to the US, describing it as \\"cowardly\\" and pledging to bring the killers to justice. Demonstrations denouncing the attack and supporting the United States were held in Benghazi the next day, with protesters mourning Stevens and signs declaring him 'a friend to all Libyans'. Libya cooperated with the US to investigate the attack, closing Benghazi's airspace for several hours to allow US drone patrols over the city on September 14. December 2, 2013, the United States and Libya entered into the U.S.-Libya Declaration of Intent, a declaration intended to increase cooperation in law enforcement investigations and fulfill international crime-fighting obligations. On 27 May 2014, the United States advised all U.S. citizens in the country to leave immediately. Citing the unstable and unpredictable security situation in Libya, the United States also warned its citizens to avoid travel to the country.

The first batch of students of the Faculty of Medicine, University of Kelaniya completed their five-year course and graduated with the MBBS degree in September 1996.North Colombo Medical College History In 1979, the College of General Practitioners (CGP) examine the feasibility of establishing a non-profit, fee-levying graduate medical institution as proposed by Dr. G. M. Heennilame which he had been advocating since 1975. Dr Walter Gooneratne and a few others convinced of the feasibility and necessity for a private medical college joined him. In November 1979 the college appointed a Project Implementation Committee comprising Drs Heennilame, Aloysius and Gooneratne ‚Äúto take all necessary steps to start an undergraduate medical college.‚Äù Between April and July 1980, Drs Sathis Jayasinghe, W D Ratnavale and Shelton Cabraal joined the team. On July 4, 1980 the College of General Practitioners of Sri Lanka appointed the Board of Governors and director of the North Colombo Medical College. The Board of Governors appointed were Drs Heennilame, Aloysius, Gooneratne, Jayasinghe and Cabraal. Dr WD Ratnavale was appointed director. Dr Stanley Kalpage appropriately described this achievement as ‚Äútruly a miracle‚Äù. After all, when these six persons were appointed, the project had no funds, no office, no staff, nothing in writing about approval and little credibility. Yet within one year and two months on 21 September 1981, the President of Sri Lanka, Junius Richard Jayewardene, ceremonially opened the North Colombo Medical College. The college placed on record those who helped to make the NCMC a reality, with their encouragement and assistance. These included President J R Jayewardene who, from 1979 till the end of his term of office, provided invaluable support. Dr Stanley Kalpage as chairman of the University Grants Commission (Sri Lanka) and secretary of Higher Education played a similar role. The others who provided assistance included Prof Stanley Wijesundera and the academic staff of the University of Colombo, Dr Malinga Fernando, L H R Peiris, Gamini Jayasuriya, B C Perera and Edward Arambawela. Since its inception the NCMC came under criticism and opposition of many socialist elements in the island, with the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna which had in 1988 initiated an insurrection carrying out a bomb attack on the NCMC administration section in 1988. The Board of Management conferred its own medical degree MBBS (NCMC) instead of the one from the University of Colombo and affiliated itself with the University of Aberdeen. In 1989, President Premadasa appointed a committee made up of K.H.J. Wijedasa (Presidential Secretary), W.M.P.B. Menikdiwela (Former Presidential Secretary), Ananda Guruge and Bradman Weerakoon to look into the NCMC. Soon after the NCMC was nationalized with the government sending the army to occupy the buildings at Talagolla stating security reasons.

It was constructed by the brothers Armand and Henri Dufaux who had previously experimented with a model helicopter. This new aircraft incorporated a feature far ahead of its time; the concept of a tiltrotor. Based on what they had learned from their helicopter, the Dufaux brothers hoped to generate vertical as well as horizontal thrust from their engine installation, and conceived of an aircraft where the engine and propeller would be mounted at the centre of the airframe and would be able to pivot 180¬∞ to provide forward, upward, and even backward thrust (the latter to assist in braking). Experiments with a boxkite fitted with an engine in 1905 proved promising, so construction of a full-scale aircraft proceeded. The resulting machine featured two sets of triplane wings in tandem with the engine installation between them, followed by a biplane tail unit with a span almost equal to that of the wings. There was no fin, but all eight flying surfaces had a marked dihedral, and the fuselage was open framework. A large and heavy aircraft for its day, it immediately posed a problem to the brothers in trying to find a field large enough to test it in, since relying on forward thrust alone, the take-off distance was estimated at 300 metres (1,000 ft). Eventually, they settled on a cavalry training field at Bi√®re, from their workshop in Geneva. The aircraft was relocated there in July 1909, and tests proceeded through the summer. Problems plagued the trials, and on no occasion did the aircraft appear to come close to leaving the ground. In August, it was badly damaged when it toppled sideways while taxiing, and although repaired, the Dufaux brothers abandoned the project at the end of the month.

The United States established diplomatic relations with Lithuania on July 28, 1922. The Soviet invasion forced the closure of the Legation to Lithuania on September 5, 1940, but Lithuanian representation in the United States continued uninterrupted. The United States never recognized the forcible incorporation of Lithuania into the USSR and views the present government of Lithuania as a legal continuation of the interwar republic. In 2007, the United States and Lithuania celebrated 85 years of continuous diplomatic relations. Lithuania has enjoyed most-favored- nation treatment with the United States since December 1991. Since 1992, the United States has committed more than $100 million in Lithuania to economic and political transformation and to humanitarian needs. The United States and Lithuania signed an agreement on bilateral trade and intellectual property protection in 1994 and a bilateral investment treaty in 1997. In 1998, the United States signed a \\"Charter of Partnership\\" with Lithuania and the other Baltic countries establishing bilateral working groups focusing on improving regional security, defense, and economic issues. Today, over 650,000 individuals who identify as Lithuanian American live in the United States. Lithuanian immigration began before the United States even became a country, with individuals like Alexander Curtius settling in New Amsterdam (what would later become New York City) in 1659. Lithuania was part of the Polish- Lithuanian Commonwealth until 1795, when it was largely incorporated into the Russian Empire. Despite attempts by the Tsarist government in Moscow to prevent residents of the empire from emigrating, many Lithuanians came to the United States throughout the 19th and early 20th Centuries, settling primarily in the Northeast (especially Pennsylvania) and the Midwest. Lithuanian immigration tapered off with the passage of nativist legislation like the Emergency Quota Act of 1921 and the Immigration Act of 1924 in Congress. Smaller waves of Lithuanian migration to the United States occurred at the end of World War II (thanks to the Displaced Persons Act) and when Lithuania regained independence following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1990.

Shadow memory consists of shadow bytes that map to individual bits or one or more bytes in main memory. These shadow bytes are typically invisible to the original program and are used to record information about the original piece of data. The technique is utilized by memory-error checkers that can store information on which parts of memory have been allocated to the program being checked. This shadow memory is then used for detecting and reporting incorrect accesses of memory, even though the program may not be crashing due to a segmentation fault or similar. An error checker may also store additional information on memory such as which bits have defined and which ones do not. Memcheck, part of the Valgrind suite, uses this to detect undefined behavior resulting from acting on or printing undefined memory values. Use of shadow memory is however not limited to memory-error checkers, as what information is stored in these shadow bytes is not fixed. It is for instance used by ThreadSanitizer, a data race detector. Shadow memory can be both implemented and used a lot of different ways, and have different performance characteristics. Memcheck for instance tracks values with bit precision, while AddressSanitizer, part of the clang compiler, is comparatively very fast. Memcheck, like all Valgrind tools, uses binary translation and instrumentation to run code manipulating the shadow memory corresponding to program memory use. AddressSanitizer on the other hand is created on compile-time and inserts error-checking code inline into a program during compilation. Its shadow-memory implementation uses a huge reservation of virtual memory for its shadow memory, giving very different performance characteristics.

Political relationship In recognition of Macau's high degree of autonomy, the United States continues to treat Macau as a \\"special area\\" distinct from the People's Republic of China: e. g., the sanctions imposed on China after the June 1989 violence in Tiananmen Square do not apply to Macau. For the DV-Lottery, those who were born in Mainland China are not eligible to apply, whereas persons born in Macau are qualified. The U.S. government supports Macau's autonomy by strengthening bilateral ties through the promotion of bilateral trade and investment, law enforcement cooperation, academic and cultural links, and high-level dialogue and visits. After the September 11 attacks, Macau officials pledged full cooperation with U.S. and global efforts against terrorism. The legislature passed an anti-terrorism law in April 2002 that includes provisions that are consistent with the requirements of UN Security Council Resolution 1373. Economic relations Macau's clothes and textiles continued to enter the United States under quotas separated from those of China. Under the terms of a September 2000 bilateral Memorandum of Understanding, Macau and the US government cooperate in enforcing textile quotas and preventing illegal trans-shipment. The US continued periodic visits by U.S. Customs Textile Production Verification Teams to ensure compliance with Macau bilateral textile commitments. The protection of intellectual property rights remains a priority issue on the U.S.-Macau bilateral economic agenda. Macau progress since 1999 in strengthening IPR laws, tightening controls over DVD and VCD manufacturing, and stepping up street-level IPR enforcement resulted in Macau being removed from USTR's Special 301 list in 2002. Macau's new customs service worked with U.S. industry associations and maintained high tempo operations to combat piracy . U.S. investment in Macau, while small in the past, is expected to increase in coming years as the result of the 2002 awarding of two gaming concessions to consortia with U.S. interests. Though trade with Macau represents a small portion of U.S. trade, the United States was Macau's second largest trading partner after the People's Republic of China. U.S. exports to and imports from Macau in 2002 were US$79 million and US$1.2 billion, respectively. After the Macau government ended the 40-year-old gaming monopoly of the Sociedade de Turismo e Divers√µes de Macau (STDM) in February 2002, the government awarded concessions to three consortia, including two with significant U.S. investment. The restructuring of the gaming industry remains the centerpiece of Macau - efforts to improve its international reputation and become a Las Vegas-like gaming, convention, and family-oriented holiday destination. The possible new investment of US$1.5-2.5 billion in the medium term will increase jobs and income and dramatically raise the U.S. business profile in Macau. US investment in Macau is largely centered on gambling, with five out of thirteen of Macau's casinos being owned by US companies.  Offices and officials  The U.S. Government has no offices in Macau.

In the book, Lynch writes about his approach to filmmaking and other creative arts. Catching the Big Fish was published by Tarcher on December 28, 2006.Biggs, Cheryl (January 14, 2007).

The book The title refers to Lynch's idea that \\"ideas are like fish. If you want to catch little fish, you can stay in the shallow water. But if you want to catch the big fish, you've got to go deeper\\". To Lynch, going deeper means experiencing a deeper, more expanded state of consciousness, a transcendental or fourth state of consciousness, an experience he has during meditation but believes is rare in ordinary daily life. According to Lynch, this experience expands artistic capacity. Lynch tells the reader that initially he did not want to meditate. He relates how he eventually began Transcendental Meditation on the advice of his sister. At the time, he was struggling to complete Eraserhead, his first feature film, and his first marriage was ending. He was out of money with a young daughter to support. Lynch's father and brother admonished him to abandon Eraserhead and become responsible. Lynch started meditation and took a job delivering The Wall Street Journal for $50 a week. Before meditation, he felt empty. When he started meditation, he felt a ‚Äúweight lifted‚Äù and fear and negativity dissolved. He saved money, kept his focus and slowly completed the movie over the next four years, one scene at a time. The lead actor stayed with the project and waited three years for Lynch to complete the film. Lynch writes about the continuing effects of meditation on his creative process. He explains that his imagination is let loose by meditation and creative concepts surface while he is meditating. He believes that from meditation, he is uniquely open to creative ideas. These ideas inspired the rabbit and Greek prostitute characters in his film Inland Empire. From OJ Simpson‚Äôs trial came the idea for Bill Pullman‚Äôs character in Lost Highway. Lynch‚Äôs creative innocence lends itself to his unconventional casting style. He writes that auditioning actors do not read from his script. Instead, they speak while he considers the possibility of the actor playing a part in the film. Often asked about the seeming conflict between the bliss he feels in meditation and his dark and violent films, Lynch reconciles the seeming disparity. The world is dark, he reasons, and films are stories about the world. Good and evil are components of stories. For Lynch, inner peace and ‚Äúexternal edginess‚Äù can coexist. Lynch reveals that he does not see the need for an artist to suffer. He does not believe artists have to identify with the emotional characters they create. ‚ÄúLet your characters do the suffering,‚Äù is his perspective. Artists can leave suffering behind without sacrificing their ‚Äúedge.‚Äù On the other hand, during a one-time, 30 second consultation, a ‚Äúshrink‚Äù told him that psychological counseling could diminish Lynch‚Äôs creativity, causing Lynch to promptly end the session. Lynch believes that meditation is a powerful inspirational tool for children. The book talks about schools where meditation is now part of the curriculum. Lynch says in meditation he experiences an ‚Äúocean of pure love, pure peace,‚Äù which is ‚Äúpure compassion.‚Äù This gives him the ability to help others in a significant way. All proceeds from the book are donated to the David Lynch Foundation For Consciousness-Based Education and World Peace, which funds TM instruction in schools. Lynch‚Äôs book reviews his practical pointers for artists. He mentions the importance of allocating preparation time (i.e., getting set up), and uninterrupted time to create the finished project. He believes a seminal idea is sufficient to start the creative process, which proceeds based on the artist‚Äôs ‚Äúaction and reaction.‚Äù Likewise, an artist needs to be ‚Äúreceptive to ideas‚Äù rather than trying to formulate them. Ideas start as ‚Äúfragments,‚Äù which attract other ideas. Blue Velvet, for example, started with the thought of red lips, green lawns, and the song by Bobby Vinton. Lynch opines that the artist‚Äôs intuition guides the creative process so he knows if his direction is right. Artists need to be fully equipped (with appropriate work space and tools) to quickly harvest their fresh creative impulses. Lynch feels strongly about digital video, saying he will not go back to film. He is developing a web series for On Networks based on Catching the Big FishThe New York Observer; October 30, 2008; ‚ÄúDavid Lynch goes digital for web show‚Äù (Conference news); New York, NY Catching the Big Fish is also available as an audiobook, with Lynch performing the audio. Reception According to reviewers, the tone of Catching the Big Fish is ‚Äúsurprisingly gentle,‚Äù ‚Äúfolksy‚Äù and ‚Äúdirect.‚Äù Critics offered differing opinions about Lynch‚Äôs coverage of Transcendental Meditation. One commentator called Lynch‚Äôs approach predominantly promotional, while another reviewer found minimal proselytizing on the topic. Commentators viewed the 84 vignette-like chapters as entertaining stories, uncontroverted advice, and ‚Äúan unexpected delight‚Äù that unlocks the secret of Lynch‚Äôs distinctive imagination.The Boston Globe; December 24, 2006; Bolick, Kate ;‚ÄúQ&A; David Lynch‚Äù; Boston, MA One reviewer observed the seeming conflict between the bliss Lynch experiences in his meditation and his life and the dark, disturbing, and bliss-less films Lynch creates. For another, Lynch‚Äôs ‚Äúgentle wisdom‚Äù came across as ‚Äúencouraging, calming insights into the beyond.‚ÄùThe Independent on Sunday; March 11, 2007; Romney, Jonathan; \\"In Odd We Trust\\"; London, England Another perceived deficiency in the book is the lack of details about Transcendental Meditation and how it‚Äôs practiced, creating a ‚Äútantalizing but unsatisfying‚Äù effect and the feeling that the reader is ‚Äúon the outside looking in.‚Äù Ultimately, Lynch‚Äôs love of creating films and transcendence along with his unique perspective are seen as themes that his admirers and would-be filmmakers can relish.

(See Statute Law Database, \\"Introduction\\" note X1. It is still partly in force in Great Britain.The Chronological Table of the Statutes, 1235‚Äì2010. The Stationery Office. 2011. . Part I. Page 79, read with pages viii and x. The Act was passed at a time when Parliament was anxious to ensure the succession of a Protestant on the death of Queen Anne. It replaced the Regency Act 1705. The Act required privy counsellors and other officers, in the event of Anne's death, to proclaim as her successor the next Protestant in the line of succession to the throne, and made it high treason for any of them to fail to do so.Section 10 If the next monarch was overseas at the time of the succession, the government would be run until he or she returned by between seven and fourteen \\"Lords Justices.\\" Seven of the Lords Justices were named in the Act, and the next monarch could appoint seven more, who would be named in writing, three copies of which were to be sent to the Privy Council in England.Sections 12 and 13 The Act made it treason for any unauthorised person to open these, or to neglect to deliver them to the Privy Council.Section 14 The Lords Justices were to have the power to give royal assent to bills, except that they would be guilty of treason if they amended the Act of Uniformity 1662 or the Protestant Religion and Presbyterian Church Act 1707.Section 17 The Act also provided that if Parliament was sitting at the time of the monarch's death, then it would be able to sit for a further six months unless dissolved by a new legitimate monarch.Section IV Previously the death of the monarch automatically dissolved Parliament. If the monarch were to die and Parliament was not at that time sitting, then it would immediately convene.Section V These clauses remain in force today (without the six month time limit on Parliament's continued existence, which was repealed in 1878legislation.org.uk). The Act also made it treason maliciously, advisedly and directly by writing or printing to maintain and affirm that any person has a right to the Crown otherwise than according to the Act of Settlement and Acts of Union, or that the Crown and Parliament cannot pass statutes for the limitation of the succession to the Crown.Section 1 It was praemunire to say so in speech.Section 2 These provisions were extended to Scotland by the Treason Act 1708, and were repealed in 1967 (however see the Treason Act 1702 which makes similar provision). Anne died on 1 August 1714 and was succeeded as a result of the Act of Settlement 1701 by the Elector of Hanover, George Louis, as King George I, who arrived in Great Britain on 18 September 1714. Sections 1 to 3 were repealed by the Criminal Law Act 1967.Part I of Schedule 4. The whole Act was formally repealed in the Republic of Ireland by the Statute Law Revision Act 2007. This Act is not to be confused with 6 Ann. c.14, which is entitled \\"An act for the better security of Her Majesty's person and government\\" but which is not about treason.

Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk's military career explains his life between graduation from Ottoman War College in Istanbul as a lieutenant in 1905 to his resignation from the Ottoman Army on 8 July 1919, as well as his military leadership throughout the subsequent Turkish War of Independence (armistice 11 October 1922).  Early years  = Staff Captain at Fifth Army (1905‚Äì1907) = Mustafa Kemal graduated from the Ottoman Military Staff College as a Staff Captain (Kurmay Y√ºzba≈üƒ±) in 1905 and was assigned to the Fifth Army based in Damascus. There he soon joined a small secret revolutionary society of reformist officers called \\"Motherland and Liberty\\" () and became an active opponent to the regime of Abd√ºlhamid II. = Senior Captain at Third Army (1907‚Äì1910) = In 1907, he was promoted to the rank of Senior Captain (Kolaƒüasƒ±) and assigned to the Third Army in Monastir (now Bitola, North Macedonia). During this period he joined the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP). In 1908, the Young Turk Revolution seized power from the then reigning Sultan Abd√ºlhamid II and Mustafa Kemal became a senior military figure. As one of the first members of the CUP, he played a role in the revolution of 1908. However, in later years he became known for his opposition to, and frequent criticism of, policies pursued by the CUP leadership. Soon thereafter, Mustafa Kemal's relationship with Enver Pasha deteriorated. As a result, when Enver Pasha emerged as the foremost military leader after 1913, Mustafa Kemal was excluded from the center of power.Z√ºrcher, Turkey : a modern history, 142 = Ministry of War (1910‚Äì1911) = In 1910, Atat√ºrk took part in the army maneuvers in Picardy, France, and in 1911 he entered service at the Ministry of War () in Constantinople (now Istanbul).  Italo-Turkish War (1911‚Äì1912)  Later in 1911, he volunteered to fight in the Italo-Turkish war in the Ottoman Vilayet of Tripolitania (present-day Libya) to oppose the Italian invasion.Jacob M. Landau, (1984), p. 48 Following the successful defense of Tobruk on 22 December 1911, he was appointed Commander of forces at Derna on 6 March 1912.  Balkan Wars (1912‚Äì1913)  He returned to Constantinople following the outbreak of the Balkan Wars in October 1912. During the First Balkan War, Mustafa Kemal fought against the Bulgarian army at Gallipoli and Bulair (Bolayƒ±r) on the coast of Thrace. He also played a crucial role in the recapture of Adrianople (Edirne) and Didymoteicho during the Second Balkan War. World War I = Military attach√© at Sofia (1913‚Äì1914) = In 1913, he was appointed military attach√© to Sofia, in part because Enver Pasha viewed him as a potential rival and sought to curtail his involvement in any political intrigue in Istanbul. By March 1914, whilst serving in Sofia, Mustafa Kemal was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel. While in Sofia, Mustafa Kemal became a vocal critic of Empire's entry into the war on Germany's side. On 16 July 1914, he sent an official dispatch from Sofia to the Ministry of War in Constantinople, urging a policy of neutrality in the event of war, with a view to possible later intervention against the Central Powers.Kinross, Atat√ºrk: The Rebirth of a Nation, 60 However, Enver Pasha, the Minister of War, favoured an alliance with Germany, leading to a secret alliance treaty being signed between the two governments. The Ottoman Empire eventually entered the First World War on Germany's side. =Battle of Gallipoli, 1914‚Äì1915= The German Marshal Otto Liman von Sanders was assigned to defend the Dardanelles in command of the Fifth Army. Mustafa Kemal was given the task of organizing and commanding the 19th Division attached to the Fifth Army. On 8 January 1915, the British War Council launched an operation \\"to bombard and take the Gallipoli peninsula with Istanbul as its objective\\". British naval attacks, however, failed to break through the Dardanelles Strait and the British decided to support their fleet with a land attack. The land campaign took place between 25 April 1915, and 9 January 1916. With his division stationed in Gallipoli, Mustafa Kemal found himself at the centre of the Allies' attempts to force their way onto the peninsula. On 25 April 1915, the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) forces were to move inland after landing their troops at Anzac Cove, but were soon met with a Turkish counterattack, commanded by Mustafa Kemal. Mustafa Kemal engaged the enemy forces on the hills, held them and retook the high ground. Largely due to him and his command, the ANZAC forces were contained, and could not attain their objectives. Before the encounter between the two forces, Mustafa Kemal told his troops: By nightfall the ANZACs had suffered 2,000 casualties and were fighting to remain on the beach. For the following two weeks the Allies failed to advance and lost one third of their force. Because he had successfully held off the Allied forces at Conkbayƒ±rƒ± (Chunuk Bair), Mustafa Kemal was promoted to the rank of Colonel during the early stages of the land campaign. The second stage of the Gallipoli campaign, which began on 6 August, placed Mustafa Kemal only three hundred meters (approximately 330 yards) away from the firing line. He was also the Turkish commander assigned to many of the major battles throughout the Gallipoli campaign, such as the Battle of Chunuk Bair, Battle of Scimitar Hill and the Battle of Sari Bair. The Gallipoli campaign became a disastrous defeat for the Allies as they were pinned down by the Turks for ten months of incessant fighting and were unable to advance past the low lying beaches of Gallipoli. The Allies finally decided to call off the offensive and successfully evacuated their troops. On the Ottoman Empire's side, Otto Liman von Sanders (Fifth Army) and several other Turkish commanders attained significant achievements in their role in the defense of the Turkish Straits. However, Mustafa Kemal became the outstanding front-line commander and gained much respect from his former enemies for his chivalry in victory. The Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk Memorial has an honoured role during ANZAC Day parades in Canberra, Australia. Mustafa Kemal's speech commemorating the loss of the hundreds of thousands of Turkish and Anzac soldiers who perished during the Gallipoli campaign is inscribed on a monument at Anzac Cove: =Caucasus Campaign, 1915‚Äì1917= Following the Battle of Gallipoli, Mustafa Kemal first served in Adrianople (Edirne) until 14 January 1916. He was assigned to the command of the XVI Corps of the Second Army and sent to the Caucasus Campaign. He was promoted to the rank of Brigadier General on 1 April. When Mustafa Kemal was assigned to his new post, the Second Army was facing the Russian army under General Tovmas Nazarbekian, the detachment of Armenian volunteer units commanded by Andranik Ozanian and the Armenian irregular units which were in constant advance. After the Siege of Van an Armenian provisional government under the leadership of Aram Manukian was formed with a progressive autonomous region. The Armenian administration had grown from its initial set-up around Lake Van. The initial stages of the Battle of Bitlis and the Battle of Mu≈ü were already developed. On arrival Kemal found chaotic conditions. The region was inhospitable at the best of times.Mango, Atat√ºrk, 160 Communication lines were under insurgency attacks. Hundreds of thousands of refugees, many of them Kurds, which had bitter relations with Armenian units, came flooding in front of the advancing Russian armies.Mango, Atat√ºrk, 161 Mustafa Kemal's initial task was to bring order to the frightened people so that his corps could function during this period of human suffering. The massive Russian offensive reached the Anatolian key cities of Erzurum, Bitlis and Mu≈ü. On 7 August, Mustafa Kemal rallied his troops and mounted a counteroffensive.Lengyel, They called him Atat√ºrk, 68 He had so strengthened the morale of his force, following its defeat, that within five days, two of his divisions captured not only Bitlis but the equally important town of Mu≈ü, greatly disturbing the calculations of the Russian Command.Kinross, Atat√ºrk: The Rebirth of a Nation, 100 Emil Lengyel wrote: \\"He demonstrated anew that the Turk was a fine soldier if he was given the right leadership. Again the Turks took note of the uncommon competence of a general whose name was 'Perfection'\\". However, Izzet Pasha, on the other parts of the front, failed to match these successes. In September, Mustafa Kemal retreated from Mu≈ü under the heavy advance of the Russian Army and Armenian volunteer units. However, Mustafa Kemal could claim the only Turkish victory in a round of defeats. He also concentrated on the strategic goal of confining the enemy within the mountainous region. That same year, as a recognition of his military achievements and his success in improving the stability of the region, he was given the medal Golden Sword of the Order of \\"Imtiyaz\\". On 7 March 1917, Mustafa Kemal was appointed from the command of the XVI Corps to the overall command of the Second Army. Meanwhile, the Russian Revolution erupted and the Caucasus front of the Czar's armies disintegrated. Mustafa Kemal had already left the region being assigned to another fighting front. =Sinai and Palestine Campaign, 1917‚Äì1918= His command of the Second Army was cut short, as he was transferred to the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. He was assigned the command of the Seventh Army. After a short visit to the Seventh Army headquarters, he returned to Constantinople on 7 October. He joined the crown prince Mehmed Vahdettin (later Sultan Mehmed VI) on a visit to Germany. During this trip he fell ill and stayed in Vienna for medical treatment. He returned to Aleppo on 28 August 1918, and resumed the command of the Seventh Army. His headquarters were in Nablus, Palestine. Like in Gallipoli, he was under the command of General Liman von Sanders, whose group headquarters was in Nazareth. Mustafa Kemal studied Syria thoroughly once again and visited the frontline. His conclusion was that Syria was in a pitiful state (the 1915‚Äì1917 period had left 500,000 Syrian casualties to famine).Spangnolo, The modern Middle East in historical perspective : essays in honour of Albert Hourani, 234‚Äì254 There was no Ottoman civil governor or commander. There was an abundance of British propaganda and British secret agents were everywhere. The local population hated the Ottoman government and looked forward to the arrival of the British troops as soon as possible. The enemy was stronger than his own forces in terms of men and equipment. To describe the desperate situation, he said \\"we are like a cotton thread drawn across their path\\".Mango, Atat√ºrk, 179 Mustafa Kemal also had to deal with the Arab Revolt, organized by Great Britain which encouraged the local Arabs to revolt against Turkish rule. Liman von Sanders lost the Battle of Megiddo, leaving 75,000 POW behind, on the first day alone. Now, nothing stood between General Allenby's forces and Mustafa Kemal's Seventh Army. Concluding that he didn't have enough men to encounter the British forces, Mustafa Kemal retreated towards Jordan to establish a stronger defensive line. In a couple of days, the total number of the deserters reached 300,000.Mango, Atat√ºrk, 180 Mustafa Kemal's war was changed drastically from fighting against the Allies to fighting against the disintegration of his own forces. He sent a furious telegram to Sultan: Mustafa Kemal was appointed to the command of Thunder Groups Command (), replacing Liman von Sanders. In the autumn of 1918 allied forces, having captured Jerusalem, prepared for their final lightning offensive under General Allenby on the Palestine front, in the words of an Arab historian to sweep Turks \\"like thistledown before the wind\\".Kinross, Ottoman centuries, 608 Mustafa Kemal established his headquarters at Katma and succeeded in regaining control of the situation. He deployed his troops along a new defensive line at the south of Aleppo, and managed to resist at the mountains. He stopped the advancing British forces (last engagements of the campaign). Kinross wrote: Mustafa Kemal's position became the base line for the Armistice of Mudros. There were regions, such as Yemen, which was still under the Ottoman control at the time of armistice. Kemal's last active service to the Ottoman Army was organizing the return of the troops that were left behind the south of his line.  Ministry of War (1918‚Äì1919)  On 30 October 1918 the Ottomans capitulated to the Allies with the Armistice of Mudros. Beginning with the armistice, the creation of the modern Arab world and Turkey began. At the end of the war, Mustafa Kemal was 37 years old. In the final stages of WWI, he was assigned to command the largest remaining Ottoman Army division, the Thunder Groups Command. After the armistice, however, Thunder Groups Command was dissolved, and Mustafa Kemal returned to an occupied Constantinople on 13 November 1918. The Occupation of Constantinople began before the Ottoman Army's leading officers, such as Mustafa Kemal on 13 November 1918, Kazim Karabekir on 28 November 1918, Ismet In√∂n√º, and others returned to Istanbul.Mango, Andrew. (1999) Atat√ºrk‚Äì The Biography of the Founder of Modern Turkey, chap. 10.Lord Kinross. The Rebirth of a Nation, chap. 20. Mustafa Kemal found himself surrounded with conditions in Istanbul that he fought to prevent. The \\"dark days of the armistice\\" was the common saying among the Muslim members of the Empire. He met with Rauf Bey and the Grand Vizier Ahmet Izzet Pasha. He wanted to resign from the army.Mango, Atat√ºrk, 198 Ahmet Izzet Pasha persuaded him to stay. He was given an administrative position at the Ministry of War (Harbiye Nezareti). Ahmet Izzet Pasha's term ended sharply and replaced by Tevfik Pasha on 18 November. High Commissioner Admiral Somerset Arthur Gough-Calthorpe was assigned as the Allied military adviser to Constantinople. His first task was to arrest some thirty former members of the CUP on 29/30 January 1919. They were taken to Bekiraga Bolugu, the military detention center. Mustafa Kemal was not one of them. Ottoman government needed respected officers to control the army. Older generals, such as Abdullah Pasha, could not control the army. The war minister Cevat Cobanli, declared that serving officers could not form associations and Mustafa Kemal claiming to advocate political neutrality of the armed forces was not perceived as a threat.Mango, Atat√ºrk, 204  General Inspector (19 May 1919 ‚Äì 8 July 1919)  Mustafa Kemal's active participation in the national resistance movement began with his assignment as a General Inspector to the 9th Army by the Sultan Mehmed VI. His task was to oversee the demobilisation of remaining Ottoman military units and nationalist organizations. On 19 May 1919, he departed from Constantinople to Samsun on board the ferry Bandƒ±rma. 19 May is accepted as the beginning of Turkish War of Independence or more precisely onset of the initial organization of oppositions under his leadership. However, the British, who had better intelligence, were alarmed when they learned that Mustafa Kemal had become Inspector General, as they believed that Mustafa Kemal had nationalist ideals. A British detachment entered and searched for documents in his mother's house where he was residing at the time.Volkan, Vamik and Itzkowitz, Norman, Immortal Ataturk, A Psychobiography, chap 9. The British were correct in their suspicions, as Mustafa Kemal at the time was meeting in that house with the Ottoman Army generals and commanders who were to become leaders in the coming war. The regular guests of this house included K√¢zim (Karabekir), Ali Fuat, Ismet (In√∂n√º). Britain urged the Sultan to recall Kemal. Thanks to friends and sympathizers in government circles, a compromise was worked out whereby the power of the Inspector General was curbed. As a result, Inspector General became a title that had no power, at least on paper. The occupations had already generated disorganised local oppositions by numerous militant resistance groups. The establishment of an organised national movement against the occupying forces was the first goal in Mustafa Kemal's mind. The General Inspector position created an ideal situation in organising the resistance.Ahmad, The Making of Modern Turkey, 49 He contacted local leaders, provincial governors and military commanders calling them to resist the occupations instead of trying to disarm the military units. In June 1919, he and his close friends issued the Amasya Circular, which stated that the independence of the country was in danger, since the Ottoman government in Istanbul was subject to foreign control the nation had to save itself by its own will and sources. On 23 June High Commissioner Admiral Calthorpe, realizing the significance of Mustafa Kemal's discreet activities in Anatolia, sent a report about Kemal to the Foreign Office. His remarks were down played by George Kidson of the Eastern Department. Captain Hurst (British army) in Samsun warned Admiral Calthorpe one more time, but Hurst's units were replaced with a Brigade of Gurkhas. The movement of British units alarmed the population of the region and convinced the population that Mustafa Kemal was right. Right after this \\"The Association for Defense of National Rights\\" (M√ºdafaa-i Hukuk Cemiyeti) was founded in Trebizond (Trabzon), and a parallel association in Samsun was also founded, which declared that the Black Sea region was not safe. The same activities that happened during the Occupation of Izmir were happening in the region. When the British landed in Alexandretta, Admiral Calthorpe resigned on the basis that this was against the Armistice that he had signed and was assigned to another position on 5 August 1919.Lord Kinross. (1999) Atat√ºrk: The Re-birth of a Nation, chap. 16. K√¢zim Karabekir had called for a congress of all defense-of-rights associations to be held in Erzurum on 23 July 1919. Mustafa Kemal was elected head of the Erzurum Congress. This gave him the chance to talk in behalf of the national movement. The Erzurum congress drafted a deceleration with the representatives of the six eastern provinces. Later known as the National Pact, it affirmed the inviolability of the Ottoman \\"frontiers\\"‚Äîthat is, all the Ottoman lands inhabited by Turks when the Armistice of Mudros was signed. It declared the provisional government, which is named as Turkish Grand National Assembly (GNA). On the economic front, this document also followed the Ottoman position of rejection of special status arrangements for the minorities, which was named as the Capitulations of the Ottoman Empire. A steering committee was established and Mustafa Kemal as selected head. Mustafa Kemal sought to extend the National Pact to the entire Ottoman-Muslim population of the empire. To that end, he called a national congress that met in Sivas and ratified the pact. He exposed attempts by the sultan‚Äôs government to arrest him and to disrupt the Sivas Congress.  Resignation from Ottoman Army (8 July 1919)  The British were alarmed when they learned of Mustafa Kemal's activities and immediately contacted the Ottoman government. The grand vizier in Constantinople was driven from office, as he rejected the British view. A new government was established. Ottoman government issued a warrant for the arrest of Mustafa Kemal, on the charge that he was disobeying the Sultan's order for dissolving the remaining Ottoman forces in Anatolia, later condemning him to death. As a response, Mustafa Kemal resigned from the Ottoman Army on 8 July, while he was in Erzurum. Mustafa Kemal called for a national election to establish a new Turkish Parliament that would have its seat in Angora (Ankara).Ahmad, The Making of Modern Turkey, 50 The call for an election became successful. On 12 February 1920, the last Ottoman Parliament gathered in Istanbul and declared the National Pact (). Following the Parliament was dissolved by the occupying British forces.  War of Independence  The British, Italian, French and Greek forces began to occupy Anatolia. The occupation of Constantinople along with the occupation of Smyrna (Izmir) mobilized the establishment of the Turkish national movement and the Turkish War of Independence.Mustafa Kemal Pasha's speech on his arrival in Angora (Ankara) in November 1919 As a reaction to the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire, the Turks waged the War of Independence, which eventually led to the establishment of the Republic of Turkey. =Conflicts, March 1920 ‚Äì March 1922= Battle of Sakarya at Duatepe observation hill. Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk with Fevzi √áakmak, Kazƒ±m √ñzalp, Ismet In√∂n√º and Hayrullah Fi≈üek, 10 September 1921 Mustafa Kemal used the dissolution of the Ottoman Parliament in Constantinople (Itsanbul) as an opportunity to establish a new National Assembly in Angora (Ankara). The first session of the \\"Grand National Assembly of Turkey\\" (GNA) gathered on 23 April 1920, with Mustafa Kemal as its president. The assembly declared its goal as to \\"liberate the Sultan\\". On 10 August 1920 Grand Vizier Damat Ferid Pasha signed the Treaty of S√®vres, which finalized the plans for the partitioning of Ottoman Empire including what Turkish nationals accepted as their heartland. Mustafa Kemal and his friends deemed the Treaty of S√®vres unacceptable, as it would spell the end of Turkish independence. The proposal for a British protectorate also rejected in the rest of Anatolia left to Turks by the Treaty of S√®vres. Kemal Insisted on complete independence and the safeguarding of the interests of the Turkish majority on Turkish soil. The acceptance of treaty and the following events weakened the legitimacy of the Sultan's government in Istanbul, and caused a shift of power in favour of the GNA in Ankara. Mustafa Kemal persuaded the assembly to recognize that sovereignty resided in the nation and in the GNA as the representative of the nation.Yapp, The making of the modern Near East, 1792‚Äì1923, 314 A popular sovereignty law was passed with the new constitution of 1921. This constitution gave Mustafa Kemal the tools to wage a War of Independence, as it publicly denounced the authority of the Istanbul government by assigning the right of sovereignty to the nation, not to the Ottoman Sultan. Kemal then persuaded the GNA to gather a National Army. The executive power was delegated to a cabinet and its speaker Mustafa Kemal. The National Army faced the Allied occupation forces and fought on three fronts: in the Franco-Turkish, Greco-Turkish and Turkish-Armenian wars. In the early autumn of 1920, the Turkish-Armenian War was waged between the Turkish revolutionaries and the Armenian military. In December 1920, Armenia appealed for peace and signed the Treaty of Alexandropol. After Armenia was incorporated into the Transcaucasian SFSR as a Soviet Socialist Republic, the Treaty of Kars gave the Turks control over most of the territories in northeastern Anatolia, where they now constituted the ethnic majority. Battle of Sakarya Mustafa Kemal with the Turkish revolutionaries. After a series of initial battles during the Greco-Turkish War, the Greek army advanced as far as to the Sakarya River, just eighty kilometers west of the Grand National Assembly in Ankara. While events were being set into motion, Enver Pasha returned from Moscow to meet with several Union of Islamic Revolutionary Societies leaders in Batum about the possibility of taking over the leadership. Mustafa Kemal politely did not invite Enver to Angora, and he left Batum by the end of September, 1921. On 5 August 1921, Mustafa Kemal was promoted to be the Commander in chief of the forces. The Battle of Sakarya from 23 August to 13 September 1921 ended with the defeat of the Greeks. Mustafa Kemal returned in triumph to Ankara, where a grateful Grand National Assembly awarded him the rank of Field Marshal of the Army, as well as the title of Gazi.Shaw, History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey, 357 Another meeting in Conference of London was held in March 1922. The Allies, without considering the extent of Ankara's successes, hoped to impose modified Serves as a peace settlement on Ankara. Allies offered to raise the S√®vres limits on the Turkish army to 85,000 men, eliminating the European financial controls over the Turkish government, but retaining the Capitulations and Public Debt Commission. Kemal rejected this proposal. According to NutukTurkish: Dedim ki: ¬´Hatt-ƒ± m√ºdafaa yoktur, Saht-ƒ± m√ºdafaa vardƒ±r. O satƒ±h, b√ºt√ºn vatandƒ±r.

No inch of the motherland may be abandoned without being soaked in the blood of her sons...\\"Stanford Jay Shaw, History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey, Cambridge University Press, 1976, , p. 357. Battle of Dumlupƒ±nar After the failure of Conference of London, the final battle, Battle of Dumlupƒ±nar, was fought between August‚ÄìSeptember 1922. Mustafa Kemal chose to adopt the strategy of concentration and surprise, employed by General Allenby in Syria. He launched an all-out attack on the Greek lines at Afyonkarahisar, aimed at smashing a hole in the Greek defences, cutting the Greek supply lines and opening the road to Izmir and to the sea. The Greek defense positions were overrun on 26 August. On 30 August, the Greek army was defeated decisively.Shaw, History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey, 362 On 1 September, Mustafa Kemal issued his famous order to the Turkish army: \\"Armies, your first goal is the Mediterranean, Forward!\\" The Greeks asked for an armistice on 6 September. By 10 September, the remainder of the Greek forces had left Anatolia, the Turkish mainland.

Despite taking hundreds of measures, the rate of environmental issues is increasing rapidly instead of reducing. Movements and ideas =20th century= Both Conservationism and Environmentalism appeared in political debate in forests about the Progressive Era in the early 20th century. There were three main positions. The laissez-faire position held that owners of private property‚Äîincluding lumber and mining companies, should be allowed to do anything they wished for their property.Samuelement, 1890-1920 (1959) The Conservationists, led by President Theodore Roosevelt and his close ally Gifford Pinchot, said that the laissez-faire approach was too wasteful and inefficient. In any case, they noted, most of the natural resources in the western states were already owned by the federal government. The best course of action, they argued, was a long-term plan devised by national experts to maximize the long-term economic benefits of natural resources. Environmentalism was the third position, led by John Muir (1838‚Äì1914). Muir's passion for nature made him the most influential American environmentalist. Muir preached that nature was sacred and humans are intruders who should look but not develop. He founded the Sierra Club and remains an icon of the environmentalist movement. He was primarily responsible for defining the environmentalist position, in the debate between Conservation and environmentalism. Environmentalism preached that nature was almost sacred, and that man was an intruder. It allowed for limited tourism (such as hiking), but opposed automobiles in national parks. It strenuously opposed timber cutting on most public lands, and vehemently denounced the dams that Roosevelt supported for water supplies, electricity and flood control. Especially controversial was the Hetch Hetchy dam in Yosemite National Park, which Roosevelt approved, and which supplies the water supply of San Francisco. Climate change =Energy= Satellite image showing the light output at night in the continental United States Since about 26% of all types of energy used in the United States are derived from fossil fuel consumption it is closely linked to greenhouse gas emissions. The energy policy of the United States is determined by federal, state and local public entities, which address issues of energy production, distribution, and consumption, such as building codes and gas mileage advancements. The production and transport of fossil fuels are also tied to significant environmental issues. Species conservation Many plant and animal species became extinct in North America soon after first human arrival, including the North American megafauna; others have become nearly extinct since European settlement, among them the American bison and California condor.Pleistocene Megafauna Extinctions The last of the passenger pigeons died in 1914 after being the most common bird in North America. They were killed as both a source of food and because they were a threat to farming. Saving the bald eagle, the national bird of the U.S., from extinction was a notable conservation success. As of 13 December, 2016, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature's Red List shows the United States has 1,514 species on its Threatened list (Critically Endangered, Endangered and Vulnerable categories). =Invasive species= Invasive species are a significant problem, some of the most notable being zebra mussels, Burmese pythons, kudzu, brown tree snakes and European starlings. Economic damages are estimated at $120 billion per year. = Deforestation = Mining Nuclear The locations across the U.S. where nuclear waste is stored The most notable accident involving nuclear power in the United States was Three Mile Island accident in 1979. Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station has been the source of two of the top five most dangerous nuclear incidents in the United States since 1979. and Nuclear safety in the United States is governed by federal regulations and continues to be studied by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). The safety of nuclear plants and materials controlled by the U.S. government for research and weapons production, as well those powering naval vessels, is not governed by the NRC. The anti-nuclear movement in the United States consists of more than eighty anti-nuclear groups which have acted to oppose nuclear power and/or nuclear weapons in the USA. The movement has delayed construction or halted commitments to build some new nuclear plants,Lights Out at Shoreham: Anti-nuclear activism spurs the closing of a new $6 billion plant Newsday.com, undated. and has pressured the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to enforce and strengthen the safety regulations for nuclear power plants.Jerry Brown and Rinaldo Brutoco (1997). Profiles in Power: The Anti-nuclear movement and the Dawn of the Solar Age, p. 198. Anti- nuclear campaigns that captured national public attention in the 1970s and 1980s involved the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant, Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant, Diablo Canyon Power Plant, Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant, and Three Mile Island.Giugni, Marco (2004). Social Protest and Policy Change: Ecology, Antinuclear, and Peace Movements p. 44. Pesticides Pesticide use in the United States is predominately by the agricultural sector, which in 2012 comprised 89% of conventional pesticide usage in the United States. The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) was first passed in 1947, giving the United States Department of Agriculture responsibility for regulating pesticides. In 1972, FIFRA underwent a major revision and transferred responsibility of pesticide regulation to the Environmental Protection Agency and shifted emphasis to protection of the environment and public health. Pollution =Air pollution= =Water pollution= =Marine pollution= =Solid waste= At 760 kg per person the United States generates the greatest amount of municipal waste.http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/env_mun_was_gen-environment-municipal- waste-generation Municipal waste generation As of 2017, municipal waste totalled 267.8 million tons in total, or 4.51 pounds per person per day.  Policy  = Electronic waste = Hazardous waste Population The total U.S. population crossed the 100 million mark around 1915, the 200 million mark in 1967, and the 300 million mark in 2006 (estimated on Tuesday, October 17). The U.S. population more than tripled during the 20th century ‚Äî a growth rate of about 1.3 percent a year ‚Äî from about 76 million in 1900 to 281 million in 2000. This is unlike most European countries, especially Germany, Russia, Italy and Greece, whose populations are slowly declining, and whose fertility rates are below replacement. Population growth is fastest among minorities, and according to the United States Census Bureau's estimation for 2005, 45% of American children under the age of 5 are minorities. In 2007, the nation‚Äôs minority population reached 102.5 million.US Census Press Releases, U.S. Census Bureau A year before, the minority population totaled 100.7 million. Hispanic and Latino Americans accounted for almost half (1.4 million) of the national population growth of 2.9 million between July 1, 2005, and July 1, 2006. Based on a population clock maintained by the U.S. Census Bureau, the current U.S. population, as of 5:55 GMT (EST+5) 27 April 2012 is 316,237,337. A 2004 U.S. Census Bureau report predicted an increase of one third by the year 2050. A subsequent 2008 report projects a population of 439 million, which is a 44% increase from 2008. Conservation and environmental movement Today, the organized environmental movement is represented by a wide range of organizations sometimes called non-governmental organizations or NGOs. These organizations exist on local national and international scales. Environmental NGOs vary widely in political views and in the amount they seek to influence the government. The environmental movement today consists of both large national groups and also many smaller local groups with local concerns. Some resemble the old U.S. conservation movement - whose modern expression is the Nature Conservancy, Audubon Society and National Geographic Society - American organizations with a worldwide influence.

A large portion of Florida is a biologically diverse ecosystem, with large wetlands in the Everglades. Management of environmental issues related to the everglades and the larger coastal waters and wetlands have been important to the history of Florida and the development of multiple parts of the economy of Florida, including the influential agricultural industry. This biodiversity leaves much of Florida's ecological ecosystem vulnerable to invasive species and human sources of industrial pollution and waste. Moreover, because of Florida's low geography, Florida has been described as \\"ground zero\\" in the United States for the impacts of climate change in the United States. Everglades The Everglades ecoregion, highlighted in a satellite photograph The Everglades are tropical wetlands located in the southern portion of Florida that have been designated under the Ramsar Convention as one of only three wetland areas of global importance. A restoration of the Everglades is being carried out with a $7.8 billion, 30-year project aimed at its preservation and restoration. Biodiversity The Florida panther is an endangered population of the cougar (Puma concolor). There are about 230 individuals in the wild. The Center for Biological Diversity and others have called for a special protected area for the panther. Manatees are also dying at a rate much higher than their reproduction. In 1977, the federal government placed alligators on the endangered list. They were removed from the endangered list in 1987 and Florida permitted selective hunting in 1988. In 2013, the US Fish and Wildlife Service was examining a list of nine species to see if they should be added to the protected list. These included bridled darter, Panama City crayfish, Suwanee moccasin shell mussel, eastern hellbender salamander, Florida Keys mole skink, MacGillivray's seaside sparrow, boreal toad, Sierra Nevada red fox, and the Bicknell's thrush. Invasive species The state has more invasive amphibians and reptiles than anyplace else in the world. The pet industry was responsible for 84% of the 137 non-native species introduced from 1863 to 2010. 25% were traced to a single importer. =Flora= Approximately 1,300 of Florida's plant species (31 percent of the total) are non-natives which have become established; 10 percent of these are considered invasive. The three most ecologically damaging are Brazilian pepper (Schinus terebinthifolius), which has taken over in south and central Florida, and forms single-species environments; melaleuca (Melaleuca quinquenervia), which has invaded - more than 12 percent of total land area in South Florida, and was spreading at an estimated per day; and Australian pine (Casuarina spp.) which covered , and whose fallen needles release a chemical into the soil which inhibits the growth of native plants. In 2013, five rare butterflies, indigenous to Florida, haven't been seen in over six years. These include the zestos skipper, rockland Meske's skipper, zarucco duskywing, nickerbean blue, and the Bahamian swallowtail. The US Fish and Wildlife Service is reluctant to declare them extinct because other butterfly species have been \\"rediscovered\\" after long periods of not being seen by man. Hydrilla (Hydrilla verticillata) is the most significant invasive aquatic plant species in the state; aggressive biological, chemical and mechanical management has reduced the effects of water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) and water lettuce (Pistia stratiotes). =Fauna= Due in part to its prevalence in the exotic pet trade, Florida has a large number of non-native species. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission tracks 31 species of mammals, 196 species of birds, 48 species of reptiles, 4 species of amphibians, and 55 species of fish that have been observed in the state. Many of the identified species are either non- breeding or stable populations, but several species, including the cane toad (Bufo marinus), Gambian pouched rat (Cricetomys gambianus), Nile monitor (Varanus niloticus), and Burmese python (Python molurus bivittatus), have created significant impact on the delicate ecosystems of the state, especially in the tropical southern third of the state. Florida's fresh waters are host to 34 confirmed breeding species of exotic (introduced) fish, a higher number than any other place on earth. Since their accidental importation from South America into North America in the 1930s, the red imported fire ant population has increased its territorial range to include most of the Southern United States, including Florida. They are more aggressive than most native ant species and have a painful sting. Fungus endangering some non-native palms Native fusarium wilt is endangering several types of palm trees including the non-native queen palms, and the Washingtonia palms. The fungus is apparently being spread by humans using unsanitized power tools. Waste Florida's 18 million residents and 80 million visitors generated over million of solid waste in 2010. Increasing landfill space has been an issue. In 2010 landfill space cost about $400,000 per . In 2010, the state had the goal of recycling 75% of its waste by 2020. Municipal experiments in \\"single-stream recycling\\" disposal seemed to indicate that this goal might be achievable. St. Lucie County is planning to experiment with burning trash through plasma arc gamification to generate energy and reduce landfill space. Pollution In 2010 there were, in the state, 44 federal Superfund sites, 101 brownfields, 13,527 petroleum cleanups and more than 3,000 other sites with dry-cleaning fluids or other hazardous waste. Drinking water is at risk because the water table is so shallow. Because of its marine origins, Florida soil is naturally high in phosphorus. Coupled with fertilizer, this often has resulted in excessive phosphorus in water runoff to nearby bodies of water. As a result, Florida has required certain municipalities to limit the application of fertilizer containing phosphorus.

Deforestation in Haiti has left less than one percent of its original forest cover, the human population has now exceeded 11 million, and there is prediction of severe impact from climate change. Flora and fauna Flamingo tongue on a purple sea fan from Arcadin Islands, Haiti. This sea snail is found living on various species of soft corals and sea fans. The island of Hispaniola is home to more than 6,000 plants, of which 35% are endemic; and 220 species of birds. None of the birds are endemic to Haiti, but La Selle thrush is nearly so. The country's originally high biodiversity is due to its mountainous topography and fluctuating elevations in which each elevation harbors different microclimates. The country's varied scenery include lush green cloud forests (in some of the mountain ranges and the protected areas), high mountain peaks, arid desert, mangrove forest, and palm tree-lined beaches. Since arrival of aboriginal man, the biodiversity of Haiti has been significantly diminished due to human exploitation. For example, the Caribbean monk seal, the only pinniped ever to occur in the Caribbean, is now extinct.Peter Saundry. 2010. Caribbean monk seal. Encyclopedia of Earth. eds. C.Michael Hogan and Cutler Cleveland. National council for Science and the Environment, Washington DC Environmental hazards In addition to soil erosion, deforestation in Haiti has caused periodic flooding, as seen on 17 September 2004. Tropical storm Jeanne skimmed the north coast of Haiti, leaving 3,006 people dead in flooding and mudslides, mostly in the city of Gona√Øves. Earlier that year in May, floods killed over 3,000 people on Haiti's southern border with the Dominican Republic. Haiti was again pummeled by tropical storms in late August and early September 2008. The storms‚ÄîTropical Storm Fay, Hurricanes Gustav, Hanna and Ike‚Äîall produced heavy winds and rain in Haiti. Due to weak soil conditions throughout Haiti, the country's mountainous terrain, and the devastating coincidence of four storms within less than four weeks, valley and lowland areas throughout the country experienced massive flooding. Casualties proved difficult to count because the storm diminished human capacity and physical resources for such record keeping. Bodies continued to surface as the flood waters receded. A 10 September 2008 source listed 331 dead and 800,000 in need of humanitarian aid. The grim state of affairs produced by these storms was all the more life-threatening due to already high food and fuel prices that had caused a food crisis and political unrest in April 2008. As was the case in 2004, the coastal city of Gona√Øves was hit especially hard by the 2008 storms. There were also major problems in 1999 with hurricanes, leaving 9,398 dead, 10,000 injured and at least 5,000 missing. Environmental issues In 1925, Haiti was lush, with 60% of its original forest covering the lands and mountainous regions. Since then, recent in-depth study of satellite imagery has concluded an accurate estimate of <1% primary forest cover Hedges SB, Cohen WB, Timyan J, Yang Z. 2018. Haiti's biodiversity threatened by nearly complete loss of primary forest. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. USA. 115(46):11850-11855. Erosion has been severe in the mountainous areas. Most Haitian logging is done for agriculture and to produce charcoal, the country's chief source of fuel. In the 19th century, arable land in the size of 15 hectares was distributed to farmers. It was inherited and divided by their children. In 1971, the average farm size was less than 1.5 hectares. To survive, the landowners had to overuse the land. It became infertile within a few years. The farmers moved to clear steeper hillsides and finally become unemployed. Eventually the shortage of arable land and rising rural poverty pushed peasants from hillside subsistence farms to search for work in Port-au- Prince, where the concentration of desperate people in slums contributed to the country's tragic history of civil strife.David R. Montgomery, Dirt. The Erosion of Civilizations, Berkeley: University of California Press 2007. Pages 227-230. Despite the large environmental crises, Haiti retains a very high amount of biodiversity in proportion to its small size. Water supply and sanitation Haiti faces key challenges in the water supply and sanitation sector. Notably, access to public services is very low, their quality is inadequate and public institutions remain very weak despite foreign aid and the government's declared intent to strengthen the sector's institutions. Foreign and Haitian NGOs play an important role in the sector, especially in rural and urban slum areas.

Environmental issues based in Canada are discussed in further detail below. Air pollution As with all countries air pollution is a problem in metropolitan areas. The air pollutants are from cars and wood burning. The common measured air pollutants are carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide. Climate change Canada has experienced a faster rate of warming than other regions of the world, especially in its far north and western areas.https://www.changingclimate.ca/CCCR2019 The effects of warming are most observable in winter and spring. This warming leads to permafrost and ice melt, making sea levels rise and bringing extreme weather conditions, changes in precipitation and uncommon heat extremes.https://www.climaterealityproject.org/blog/how-climate-change- affecting-canada =Melting of the Arctic and its effects on marine ecosystems= Scientists across the world have already started to notice massive reductions in Canada's Arctic sea ice cover, particularly during the summertime. The shrinking of this ice results in the disruption of the ocean circulation, and changes in climate and weather around the world.http://www.climaterealityproject.org The 2019 Canada's Changing Climate Report, written by scientists from institutions around the globe, states that the impacts of climate change on Atlantic Canada will be very diverse. One impact is that the sea ice will become thinner and will also form for much shorter periods of the year. And with less sea ice than the region usually gets now, wave seasons will become more intense. Atlantic Canada will see a relative rise in sea levels everywhere - a rise which is estimated to be 75 to 100 cm by the year 2100. Scientists also predict that even if emissions decrease, a 20-cm rise is expected to take place during the course of the next 20 to 30 years.https://globalnews- ca.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/globalnews.ca/news/5918981/climate-change-impact- across-canada/ As the ocean warms and subtropical waters move north, the ocean will become warmer and saltier, and since warmer water holds less oxygen than cooler water, marine ecosystems can suffer and become less sustainable because of this lower oxygen level.https://globalnews.ca/news/4657721/canada-fish- stock-decline-ottawa-report/ In the journal, Science, which was published in March 2019, it explains that warmer waters could actually increase fish stocks in certain regions, like the halibut found off the coast of Newfoundland and Greenland but other species such as the Atlantic Cod and albacore tuna might not be able to cope with the conditions so well. Conservation Clearcutting of old-growth forests just outside Carmanah Walbran Provincial Park in British Columbia The Rainforest Action Network and indigenous groups have campaigned to protect the boreal forest of Canada from logging and mining. In July 2008 the Ontario government announced plans to protect some of the area from all industrial activity. =Logging= Logging of old growth forest continues in Canada. The Ancient Forest Alliance is an environmental group in British Columbia, dedicated to stopping logging in endangered old growth forests, and ensuring the sustainable logging of second growth forests. The forests of Clayoquot Sound are still being logged. There are ongoing protests over the logging and in 1993 it was the site of the largest act of peaceful civil disobedience in Canada. =Chemical pollution= The Aamjiwnaang First Nation community has expressed concern regarding its proximity to chemical plants, as birth rates of their people have been documented by the American journal Environmental Health Perspectives as deviating from the normal ratio of close to 50% boys, 50% girls. The ratio as found between 1999 and 2003 by the journal was roughly 33% boys, and 67% girls. The First Nation is concerned that this abnormal trend is due to adverse effects of maternal and fetal exposure to the effluent and emissions of the nearby chemical plants. This is the first community in the world to have a birth rate of two girls to every boy.

Portrait by Pompeo Batoni, Prado, Madrid Francis Basset in 1778, painting by Pompeo Batoni, Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando, Madrid Francis Basset, wearing a red suit and undergraduate robes, with a mortar-board on the wall beside him. Portrait by Sir Joshua Reynolds, private collection Arms of Basset of Heanton Punchardon and Umberleigh, Devon and Tehidy, Cornwall: Barry wavy of six or and gules Francis Basset, 1st Baron de Dunstanville and Basset FRS (9 August 1757 ‚Äì 14 February 1835) of Tehidy in the parish of Illogan in Cornwall, was an English nobleman and politician, a member of the ancient Basset family. Origins He was the eldest son and heir of Francis Basset (1715‚Äì1769) of Tehidy by his wife Margaret St. Aubyn, a daughter of Sir John St Aubyn, 3rd Baronet of Clowance in Cornwall. His was the junior branch of the Basset family, the senior line of which was seated at Umberleigh and Heanton Punchardon in North Devon, but nevertheless his Cornish branch owned more land, and from the many mineral and tin mines within its possessions it amassed great wealth. In 1873 (the first time such a survey had been performed) they were the fourth largest landowner in Cornwall, as revealed by the Return of Owners of Land, 1873, with 16,969 acres, after the Rashleigh family of Menabilly (30,156 acres), the Boscawens of Tregothnan (25,910 acres) and the Robartes of Lanhydrock (22,234 acres). Dolcoath, one of the richest copper mines in England, belonged to the Cornish Bassets. Competition from Welsh mines forced Francis to close it in 1787, but the improving market for copper allowed him to reopen it in 1799. A shrewd businessman, he was a partner in the Cornish Bank of Truro and chairman of the Cornish Metal Company, and added to his already large fortune as a result. Career Basset was baptized at Charlbury, Oxfordshire on 7 September 1757 and was educated at Harrow School (1770‚Äì71), Eton College (1771‚Äì74) and King's College, Cambridge (1775). In 1777 he left university early to perform a Grand Tour in Italy, with Rev. William Sandys acting as his Cicerone. In Rome he had his portrait painted by Pompeo Batoni, who did not finished it until after Basset's departure. It was despatched to England on board the Westmorland, which was seized by the French and sold to the Spanish. Two portraits of him by Batoni are today in the collections of the Prado and the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando, Madrid. He returned to England in 1778, and partly due to his family's great influence in Cornwall, was appointed to the honourable position of Recorder of Penryn in Cornwall. Like his father, he served as a Member of Parliament for his family's pocket borough of Penryn in Cornwall (in 1760 his father was possessed of 82 tenements in the borough, 36 more in the parish, and about 60 of his tenants were electors),History of Parliament, Penryn Constituency which seat he held between 1780 and 1796. The constituency returned two MPs, and the other, also elected due to the Basset family's control of the borough, was at some time his first cousin Sir John St Aubyn, 5th Baronet. In August 1779 as part of the national move to counter a Franco-Spanish invasion fleet gathered in connection with the American War of Independence, he marched 600 Cornish miners to Plymouth and strengthened that town's defenses and fortified Portreath. As a reward, he was created by the King a Baronet, \\"of Tehidy, County Cornwall\\" on 24 November 1779. Following his marriage in 1780 he finally graduated from King's College as a Master of Arts in 1786. He purchased Radnor House on the banks of the River Thames in Twickenham, which he owned from 1785 until 1793. He was one of the dominant political figures in Cornwall, rivalled in influence only by Viscount Falmouth and Sir Christopher Hawkins, 1st Baronet. Each of them sought to use their powers of patronage to control elections to the House of Commons (Cornwall, with 44 seats, was grossly over-represented in Parliament given its population). Basset was personally on bad terms with Hawkins, and they fought a notorious duel in 1810, although neither was injured. Not surprisingly, he was a determined opponent of electoral reform, which he saw as a threat to his own power base. He was elevated to the peerage on 17 June 1796 as Baron de Dunstanville, and later on 30 November 1797 also as Baron Basset of Stratton, with special remainder to his daughter. Marriage and children He married twice: *Firstly on 16 May 1780 at St Marylebone Parish Church in London, to Frances Susanna Hippesley-Coxe (d. 14 June 1823), who pre-deceased him, a daughter of John Hippesley-Coxe of Ston Easton in Somerset, by whom he had a sole daughter and heiress: **Frances Basset, 2nd Baroness Basset, who inherited his second barony suo jure in accordance with the special remainder. *Secondly on 13 July 1824 he married Harriet Lemon (1777‚Äì1864), 4th daughter of Sir William Lemon, 1st Baronet, of Carclew, by his wife Jane Buller. They had no issue. His second marriage, when he was close to seventy, and so soon after his first wife's death, caused some derisory comment, and was generally thought to be inspired solely by the hope of producing a male heir: \\"the one ambition in his life which he never fulfilled\\". The hope of a male heir was not realised, nor did he have any grandchildren, as Frances never married. Death & succession He died on 14 February 1835 without surviving male issue, whereupon his barony of de Dunstanville became extinct as did his baronetcy, while the barony of Basset passed by the special remainder to his only child, Frances Basset, 2nd Baroness Basset, his daughter by his first marriage. Monument Basset Monument on Carn Brea On the highest point of Carn Brea in Cornwall is a high celtic cross, erected by public subscription in 1836. It is dedicated to Francis Basset and inscribed \\"The County of Cornwall to the memory of Francis Lord de Dunstanville and Basset A.D. 1836\\".As shown by the stone inscription on the south of the monument. See inscription text on Basset Cross photograph Depiction in literature He is a recurring character in the Poldark novels by Winston Graham, where he is shown in a generally sympathetic light. The novels describe the long-standing struggle between Basset and George Boscawen, 3rd Viscount Falmouth for political supremacy in Cornwall. This relates in part to control of the pocket borough of Penryn.History of Parliament, Penryn Constituency  Notes   References   External links  *History of Parliament Trust: House of Commons, Members 1790-1820, History of Parliament Trust biography * Francis Basset on thePeerage.com * Francis Basset - entry on Dictionary of National Biography * Maria Dolores Sanchez-Jauregui, 'Two Portraits of Francis Basset by Pompeo Batoni in Madrid', The Burlington Magazine, Vol. 143, No. 1180 (Jul., 2001), pp. 420‚Äì425 *Angus McLellan, 'Pirates of the Mediterranean - mining the cargo of the Westmorland in Madrid', Trinity Today, December 2007, pages 14 to 15 * Giles Tremlett, 'Spaniards looted British art hoard', The Times, 1999 1757 births 1835 deaths People from Illogan People from West Oxfordshire District People educated at Eton College People educated at Harrow School Alumni of King's College, Cambridge Barons in the Peerage of Great Britain Peers of Great Britain created by George III British Militia officers British MPs 1780‚Äì1784 British MPs 1784‚Äì1790 British MPs 1790‚Äì1796 Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for constituencies in Cornwall Fellows of the Royal Society Politicians from Cornwall Francis Cornish nobility ","title":"Francis Basset, 1st Baron de Dunstanville"},{"id":"15991044","text":"The Reuben Freeman House is a unique home, it sports eight gables and was built 1887 in Inver Grove Heights in the U.S. state of Minnesota.

One railway line passes through the center of the town. History Signage upon entering Meadows. The town of Meadows was laid out 18 May 1903 by Samuel W. Baker.Historical Encyclopedia of Illinois and History of McLean County (Chicago: Munsell, 1908) p. 902. The Original Town consisted of ten blocks on either side of the railroad with additional lots just north of the tracks.Combined Indexed Atlas 1856 - 1914, McLean County, Illinois (Bloomington: McLean County Historical Society and McLean County Genealogical Society, 2006) p.256. A station with the name Meadows and a small cluster of buildings had existed in this place since at least 1874. In 1877 Charles Parker platted and recorded the land in which he owned in the area now known as Meadows. A post office was located here with Charles Klein being its first postmaster. It also had a store and a grainhouse as well as a train station that stopped along the Toledo, Peoria and Western Railway. Meadows was also home to the Meadows Washer Line, a washing machine manufacture.  Economy  Meadows is home to the Meadows Mennonite Retirement Community which was founded in 1919. It offers Alzheimer and nursing care to the elderly. Meadows is also home to one of the Prairie Central Co-Op grain elevators. It has access to the Toledo, Peoria and Western Railway and is a main grain shipping facility in the area. Meadows Mennonite Church Meadows Mennonite Church 2010. Meadows Mennonite Church started out as an Alsace Amish congregation in 1874. It wasn't until 1890 that the congregation was officially organized. It then went on to become the charter member of the Central Conference in 1908. Consideration of where the church should be built was a main concern because people of the late 19th century mostly had to be transported by horse and carriage. But Meadows boasted a passenger railway stop, a luxury of the time that most small towns did not have. The church was built and dedicated in 1909. This building was added on to and updated until a new church was built in 1967. The new building served the congregation until the church closed in 2007. With the advant of the building of Interstate 55, 3 miles to the east near Chenoa, Meadows was then considered out of the way and the local bank in Meadows closed, general store, auto garage, and a school all were closed inevitably, with the interstate being to blame. The church had seen a reduction in congregation since it peaked in the 1940s at 300. It finally made the operating of the day-to-day expenses too much for the church to shoulder and the Meadows Mennonite Church closed on Sunday, August 19, 2007. An end to 117 years in this small community.

These compartments are designed such that each contains no more than one gene. When the gene is transcribed and/or translated, its products (RNAs and/or proteins) become 'trapped' with the encoding gene inside the compartment. By coupling the genotype (DNA) and phenotype (RNA, protein), compartmentalization allows the selection and evolution of phenotype.  History  In vitro compartmentalization method was first developed by Tawfik et al.Tawfik, D.S. and A.D. Griffiths, Man-made cell-like compartments for molecular evolution. Nat Biotechnol, 1998. 16(7): p. 652‚Äì6. Based on the idea that Darwinian evolution relies on the linkage of genotype to phenotype, Tawfik et al. designed aqueous compartments of water- in-oil (w/o) emulsions to mimic cellular compartments that can link genotype and phenotype. Emulsions of cell-like compartments were formed by adding in vitro transcription/translation reaction mixture to stirred mineral oil containing surfactants. The mean droplet diameter was measured to be 2.6 um by laser diffraction. As a proof of concept, Tawfik el al. designed an experiment that would transcribe and translate M. HaeIII gene in the presence of 107-fold excess of genes encoding another enzyme folA. The 3‚Äô of each gene was purposely designed to contain HaeIII R/M sequences, and when HaeIII methyltransferase was expressed from a M.HaeIII gene, it would methylate HaeIII R/M sequence and cause the gene to be resistant to restriction enzyme digestion. By selecting for DNA sequences that survive the endonuclease digestion, Tawfik el al. found there was enrichment for the M.HaeIII genes, i.e. 1000 fold in the first round of selection.  Method  Figure 1. In vitro compartmentalization: selection cycle =Emulsion technology= Water- in-oil (w/o) emulsions are created by mixing aqueous and oil phases with the help of surfactants. A typical IVC emulsion is formed by first generating oil- surfactant mixture by stirring, and then gradually adding the aqueous phase to the oil-surfactant mixture. For stable emulsion formation, a mixture of HLB (hydrophile-lipophile balance) and low HLB surfactants are needed.Rothe, A., R.N. Surjadi, and B.E. Power, Novel proteins in emulsions using in vitro compartmentalization. Trends Biotechnol, 2006. 24(12): p. 587-92. Some combinations of surfactants used to generate oil-surfactant mixture are mineral oil / 0.5% Tween 80 / 4.5% Span 80 / sodium deoxycholateTawfik, D.S. and A.D. Griffiths, Man-made cell-like compartments for molecular evolution. Nat Biotechnol, 1998. 16(7): p. 652-6. and a more heat stable version, light mineral oil / 0.4% Tween 80 / 4.5% Span 80 / 0.05% Triton X-100.Ghadessy, F.J., J.L. Ong, and P. Holliger, Directed evolution of polymerase function by compartmentalized self-replication. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 2001. 98(8): p. 4552-7. The aqueous phase containing transcription and/or translation components is slowly added to the oil surfactants, and the formation of w/o is facilitated by homogenizing, stirring or using hand extruding device. The emulsion quality can be determined by light microscopy and/or dynamic light scattering techniques. The emulsion is quite diverse, and greater homogenization speeds helps to produce smaller droplets with narrower size distribution. However, homogenization speeds has to be controlled, since speed over 13,500 r.p.m tends to result in a significant loss of enzyme activity on the level of transcription. The most widely used emulsion formation gives droplets with a mean diameter of 2-3Œºm, and an average volume of ~5 femtoliters, or 1010 aqueous droplet per ml of emulsions.Miller, O.J., et al., Directed evolution by in vitro compartmentalization. Nat Methods, 2006. 3(7): p. 561-70. The ratio of genes to droplets is designed such that most of the droplets contains no more than a single gene statistically. =In vitro transcription/translation = IVC enables the miniaturization of large-scale techniques that can now be done on the micro scale including coupled in vitro transcription and translation (IVTT) experiments. Streamlining and integrating transcription and translation allows for fast and highly controllable experimental designs. IVTT can be done both in bulk emulsions and in microdroplets by utilizing droplet-based microfluidics. Microdroplets, droplets on the scale of pico to femtoliters, have been successfully used as single DNA molecule vessels. This droplet technology allows high throughput analysis with many different selection pressures in a single experimental setup. IVTT in microdroplets is preferred when overexpression of a desired protein would be toxic to a host cell minimizing the utility of the transcription and translation mechanisms. IVC has used bacterial cell, wheat germ and rabbit reticulocyte (RRL) extracts for transcription and translation. It is also possible to use bacterial reconstituted translation system such as PURE in which translation components are individually purified and later combined. When expressing eukaryote or complex proteins, it is desirable to use eukaryotic translation systems such as wheat germ extract or more superior alternative, RRL extract. In order to use RRL for transcription and translation, traditional emulsion formulation cannot be used as it abolishes translation. Instead, a novel emulsion formulation: 4% Abil EM90 / light mineral oil was developed and demonstrated to be functional in expressing luciferase and human telomerase.Ghadessy, F.J. and P. Holliger, A novel emulsion mixture for in vitro compartmentalization of transcription and translation in the rabbit reticulocyte system. Protein Eng Des Sel, 2004. 17(3): p. 201-4. = Breaking emulsion and coupling of genotype and phenotype = Once transcription and/or translation has completed in the droplets, emulsion will be broken by successive steps of removing mineral oil and surfactants to allow for subsequent selection. At this stage, it is crucial to have a method to ‚Äòtrack‚Äô each gene products to the encoding gene as they become free floating in a heterogeneous population of molecules. There are three major approaches to track down each phenotype to its genotype.Leemhuis, H., et al., New genotype-phenotype linkages for directed evolution of functional proteins. Curr Opin Struct Biol, 2005. 15(4): p. 472-8. The first method is to attach each DNA molecule with a biotin group and an additional coding sequence for streptavidin (STABLE display).Yonezawa, M., et al., DNA display of biologically active proteins for in vitro protein selection. J Biochem, 2004. 135(3): p. 285-8. All the newly formed proteins/peptides will be in fusion with streptavidin molecules and bind to their biotinylated coding sequence. An improved version attached two biotin molecules to the ends of a DNA molecule to increase the avidity between DNA molecule and streptavidin- fused peptides, and used a low GC content synthetic streptavidin gene to increase efficiency and specificity during PCR amplification.Yonezawa, M., et al., DNA display for in vitro selection of diverse peptide libraries. Nucleic Acids Res, 2003. 31(19): p. e118. The second method is to covalently link DNA and protein. Two strategies have been demonstrated. The first is to form M.HaeIII fusion proteins.Bertschinger, J. and D. Neri, Covalent DNA display as a novel tool for directed evolution of proteins in vitro. Protein Eng Des Sel, 2004. 17(9): p. 699-707. Each expressed protein/polypeptide will be in fusion with Hae III DNA methyltransferase domain, which is able to bind covalently to DNA fragments containing the sequence 5‚Ä≤-GGC*-3‚Ä≤, where C* is 5-fluoro-2 deoxycytidine. The second strategy is to use monomeric mutant of VirD2 enzyme.de Figueiredo, P., R.L. Roberts, and E.W. Nester, DARTs: A DNA-based in vitro polypeptide display technology. Proteomics, 2004. 4(10): p. 3128-40. When a protein/peptide is expressed in fusion with Agrobacterium protein VirD2, it will bind to its DNA coding sequence that has a single-stranded overhang comprising VirD2 T-border recognition sequences. The third method is to link phenotype and genotype via beads.Nord, O., M. Uhlen, and P.A. Nygren, Microbead display of proteins by cell-free expression of anchored DNA. J Biotechnol, 2003. 106(1): p. 1-13. The beads used will be coated with streptavidin to allow for the binding of biotinylated DNA, in addition, the beads will also display cognate binding partner to the affinity tag that will be expressed in fusion with the protein/peptide.  Selection  Depending on the phenotype to be selected, difference selection strategies will be used. Selection strategy can be divided into three major categories: selection for binding, selection for catalysis and selection for regulation.Griffiths, A.D. and D.S. Tawfik, Miniaturising the laboratory in emulsion droplets. Trends Biotechnol, 2006. 24(9): p. 395-402. The phenotype to be selected can range from RNA to peptide to protein. By selecting for binding, the most commonly evolved phenotypes are peptide/proteins that have selective affinity to a specific antibody or DNA molecule. An example is the selection of proteins that have affinity to zinc finger DNA by Sepp et al.Sepp, A. and Y. Choo, Cell-free selection of zinc finger DNA-binding proteins using in vitro compartmentalization. J Mol Biol, 2005. 354(2): p. 212-9. By selecting for catalytic proteins/RNAs, new variants with novel or improved enzymatic property are usually isolated. For example, new ribozyme variants with trans- ligase activity were selected and exhibited multiple turnovers.Levy, M., K.E. Griswold, and A.D. Ellington, Direct selection of trans-acting ligase ribozymes by in vitro compartmentalization. Rna, 2005. 11(10): p. 1555-62. By selecting for regulation, inhibitors of DNA nucleases can be selected, such as protein inhibitors of the Colicin E7 DNase.Bernath, K., S. Magdassi, and D.S. Tawfik, Directed evolution of protein inhibitors of DNA-nucleases by in vitro compartmentalization (IVC) and nano-droplet delivery. J Mol Biol, 2005. 345(5): p. 1015-26.  Advantages  Comparing to other in vitro display technologies, IVC has two major advantages. The first advantage is its ability to control reactions within the droplets. Hydrophobic and hydrophilic components can be delivered to each droplet in a step-wise fashion without compromising the chemical integrity of the droplet, and thus by controlling what to be added and when to be added, the reaction in each droplet is controlled. In addition, depending on the nature of the reaction to be carried out, the pH of each droplet can also be changed. More recently, photocaged substrates were used and their participation in a reaction was regulated by photo-activation. The second advantage is that IVC allows the selection of catalytic molecules. As an example, Griffiths et al. was able to select for phosphotriesterase variants with higher Kcat by detecting product formation and amount using anti-product antibody and flow cytometry respectively.Griffiths, A.D. and D.S. Tawfik, Directed evolution of an extremely fast phosphotriesterase by IVC. EMBO J, 2003. 22(1): p. 24-35.

The 121st is equipped with the Block 30 F-16C/D Fighting Falcon. The squadron is a descendant organization of the 121st Observation Squadron, established on 10 July 1940. It is one of the 29 original National Guard Observation Squadrons of the United States Army National Guard formed before World War II.  Heraldry  In the early 1960s, the 121st Tactical Fighter Squadron developed and approved a fuselage insignia, an iron fist and jet fighter superimposed on a national shield. It was thought that the unit had no previous insignia, but the designers were incorrect. A Maryland Terrapin originally flew with the District of Columbia Air National Guard and, many years later, was reinstated as the unit's insignia. The original design, approved in 1943, and authenticated as correct by the Air Museum, Wright- Patterson Air Force Base, is described as follows. \\"A caricatured tan and brown turtle proper , riding a \\"pogo\\" stick, leaving a trail of hops and impact marks black, all outlined light turquoise blue.

Not organized until April 1941, formed in Washington D. C. without aircraft assigned. =World War II= The unit was ordered to active duty in April 1941 as part of the buildup of the Army Air Corps after the Fall of France. Assigned to Bolling Field, D.C. and equipped with light observation aircraft. Transferred to the Third Air Force in September 1941, they began flying anti-submarine flights over the South Carolina coastline from airfields in the Columbia area. It was then moved to the First Air Force at Langley Field, Virginia, again engaging in antisubmarine patrols over the Maryland, Virginia and upper North Carolina coasts and the approaches to Chesapeake Bay. Finally, it was moved to Birmingham, Alabama in October 1942 and then inactivated. The squadron personnel were reassigned to other units and aircraft and transferred to other duties. The squadron was reactivated in April 1943 as a liaison and Observation squadron, with a mission to support Army ground units by flying photo and tactical observation missions, performing battlefield reconnaissance for enemy ground forces, and spotting for artillery fire. They were deployed to the Twelfth Air Force in Algeria in March 1944, engaging in liaison and courier operations for Headquarters, Army Air Forces, MTO. They were equipped with various light observation aircraft, mostly A-20 Havoc light bombers used for aerial photo-reconnaissance and modified A-24 Banshee dive bombers taken out of combat and modified into RA-24 photo-reconnaissance aircraft. They were again reassigned to the Fifth Army in Italy in September, where they engaged in combat reconnaissance and photo-reconnaissance in Italy as part of the Italian Campaign. The squadron was then broken up, with elements of the squadron transferred to the Seventh Army in Southern France, where they performed combat reconnaissance as part of the Southern France Campaign. Other parts of the squadron remained attached to the Ninth Air Force and Sixth United States Army Group during the Rhineland Campaign and the Western Allied invasion of Germany. The remaining elements of the squadron stayed in Italy as part of the Fifth Army as it advanced north and enemy forces withdrew north of Rome. They were stationed near Florence until the end of the war. The squadron was returned to the United States at Drew Field, Florida in August 1945. Most personnel were demobilized although the unit remained active until being inactivated in Oklahoma in November 1945. =District of Columbia Air National Guard= The wartime 121st Liaison Squadron was redesignated as the 121st Fighter Squadron, and was allotted to the District of Columbia Air National Guard, on 24 May 1946. It was organized at Andrews Field, Maryland, and was extended federal recognition on 20 October 1946 by the National Guard Bureau. The squadron was equipped with F-47D Thunderbolts and was assigned to 113th Fighter Group, also a DC guard unit and was initially gained by Air Defense Command. The mission of the 121st Fighter Squadron was the air defense of the District of Columbia, along with southern Maryland and northern Virginia. Parts were no problem and many of the maintenance personnel were World War II veterans so readiness was quite high and the planes were often much better maintained than their USAF counterparts. In some ways, the postwar Air National Guard was almost like a flying country club and a pilot could often show up at the field, check out an aircraft and go flying. However, the unit also had regular military exercises that kept up proficiency and in gunnery and bombing contests they would often score at least as well or better than active-duty USAF units, given the fact that most ANG pilots were World War II combat veterans. In December 1949 the 121st Fighter Squadron converted from its F-47s to F-84C Thunderjets as the first Air National Guard squadron to be equipped with jet aircraft. It was not to be a happy relationship. During 1950, the 121st had lost four Thunderjets in accidents, and two more to undetermined other causes. On 30 August 1950 the squadron lost a single Republic F-84 Thunderjet during a routine weather training mission of two aircraft. After passing southbound near Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, the F-84C exploded in mid-air at tree height, left a large crater in a field, and scattered wreckage over 3 acres (1.2 hectares) of the Hilbert cornfield near the Maryland intersection of the Harney and Bollinger School roads. Along with small parts of the aircraft, a few remains of the pilot were recovered; and the element leader in the lead F-84, 1st Lt. William L. Hall, reported \\"Alkire had not radioed of any difficulty before the explosion.\\" Korean War activation 121st Fighter Squadron Republic F-84C Thunderjet 47-1499, about 1950 With the surprise invasion of South Korea on 25 June 1950, and the regular military's lack of readiness, most of the Air National Guard was called to active duty, including the 121st, which was activated on 1 February 1951. The 121st Fighter Squadron became an element of Air Defense Command (ADC) and was redesignated as the 121st Fighter-Interceptor Squadron.Cornett & Johnson, p. 122 The squadron was joined in the 113th Fighter-Interceptor Group by the Delaware ANG 142d Fighter-Interceptor Squadrons, also equipped with F-84Cs, and the Pennsylvania ANG 148th Fighter Squadron equipped with World War II era F-51D Mustangs at Spaatz Field, Reading.Cornett & Johnson, p. 68 ADC moved the 113th group and its parent 113th Fighter-Interceptor Wing from Andrews AFB to New Castle Air Force Base, Delaware, where they replaced the 4th Fighter-Interceptor Wing and group, which deployed to the Pacific,Endicott, p. 59Ravenstein, pp. 13‚Äì14} but the squadron remained at Andrews. The squadron mission was the air defense of the Delaware Bay and the Delmarva Peninsula. In September 1951 the squadron converted to airborne interception radar equipped F-94B Starfires with partial all-weather capabilities. ADC's was experiencing difficulty under the existing wing base organizational structure in deploying its fighter squadrons to best advantage.Grant, C.L., p. 33 In February 1952, the 113th wing and group were inactivated and replaced by the regional 4710th Defense Wing. The squadron remained assigned to the wing until it was released from federal service in November 1952 and its mission, personnel, and equipment reassigned to the 95th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, which activated the same day.Maurer, Combat Squadrons, p. 318 Cold War 121st TFS F-86H 53-1329 With its return to District of Columbia control, the 121st Fighter-Interceptor Squadron was re- equipped with propeller-driven F-51H Mustangs and resumed its air defense mission of Washington, D.C. It was not until 1954, with the phaseout of the Mustang and the requirement by Air Defense Command that its interceptor squadrons be equipped with jet-powered aircraft that the squadron was upgraded to postwar-era F-86A Sabres that had been refurbished and reconditioned before being received. In August 1954, the 121st began standing daytime air defense alert at Andrews, placing two aircraft at the end of the runway with pilots in the cockpit from one hour before sunrise until one hour after sunset. This ADC alert lasted each and every day until the end of October 1958 Despite the reconditioning, the F-86A Sabres were weary and required a considerable amount of maintenance to keep in the air. In 1955, the 113th sent them to storage at Davis-Monthan AFB and received F-86E Sabres from active-duty ADC units that were receiving F-89 Scorpion interceptors. In 1957, the F-86H was already being phased out of active service with the USAF, being replaced by the F-100 Super Sabre, and the 121st received F-86H Sabres in late 1957. North American F-100C 54-1807 about 1965 121st Tactical Fighter Squadron F-105D 58-1173 after an air refueling. In late 1958, the gaining command for the 113th was changed from Air Defense Command to Tactical Air Command (TAC) and the mission of the wing was changed to tactical air support, although the air defense of Washington remained as a secondary mission. The Sabres were phased out in 1960 with the receipt of relatively new F-100C Super Sabres from active duty units receiving the F-100D model. The Super Sabre was a major improvement over the F-86H and it gave the wing a major increase in capability as well as it entering the supersonic age. In January 1968, a new crisis, the seizure of the American ship USS Pueblo by North Korean forces, and again the 113th was called to active duty. The wing was activated to federal service, and its personnel were assigned to Myrtle Beach AFB, South Carolina as a filler unit while the base's permanent unit, the 354th Tactical Fighter Wing was deployed to Kunsan Air Base, South Korea. At Myrtle Beach AFB, the federalized NJ ANG 119th Tactical Fighter Squadron joined the 121st TFS on active duty. However, not all wing personnel were sent to Myrtle Beach, as personnel were spread throughout the United States, Taiwan, Korea, and South Vietnam. The 113 TFW returned to Andrews AFB, in June 1969, and transitioned into the F-105D Thunderchief (AKA \\"Thud\\") in 1971, receiving Vietnam War veteran aircraft that were being withdrawn from combat. The 113th was one of four Air National Guard units to receive the F-105. A very large and complex aircraft, the 113th was fortunate to have many Vietnam Veteran airman in its ranks by 1970 which had F-105 experience. The Thud was the first USAF supersonic tactical fighter- bomber that was developed from scratch. All others before it were adaptations of aircraft that had originally been developed as pure fighters. In December 1974, the 113th Tactical Fighter Group was inactivated, with the 121st TFS being assigned directly to the 113th Tactical Fighter Wing. In 1981 at the end of its service life, the F-105s were retired, with the 113th TFW receiving F-4D Phantom IIs, again receiving Vietnam War veteran aircraft from active- duty units receiving F-15A and F-16A next-generation fighter aircraft. With the F-4, the 113th returned to the air defense mission, becoming part of Air Defense, Tactical Air Command (ADTAC), a named unit at the Numbered Air Force echelon of TAC. ADTAC had taken over the mission of Aerospace Defense Command in 1979 when the command was inactivated; the D.C. Air National Guard using the Phantoms for Washington, D.C. air defense. F-4D 66-7607 from the 121st Tactical Fighter Squadron, 1987 The 113th operated the Phantoms throughout the 1980s, retiring the Phantoms at the end of their service life in 1989. In turn, the 121st FS started receiving F-16A Fighting Falcons in September 1989. These were block 5 and 10 models coming from various regular USAF units converting to more modern F-16C/D models. The Wing retained its air defense and attack mission, however the early block 5 and 10 models really designed to do. In the air defense role these models lacked any BVR capability, limiting them only to close range combat with their gun and Sidewinder missiles. In the attack role these aircraft were able to deploy bombs, but with their smaller stabs the center of gravity of these aircraft was far from ideal making it quite a challenge for the pilots to fly these missions. The 113th Tactical Fighter Wing was not mobilized during the 1991 Gulf Crisis, remaining in the United States with its air defense mission. D. C. Air National Guard volunteers, however were deployed to CENTAF during the crisis and subsequent combat operations as part of Operation Desert Storm. Air Combat Command After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1990 and Operation Desert Storm, Air Force planners reorganized the major command structure and the organization of its units to reflect the new reality of the 1990s and also a smaller force after the end of the Cold War. Tactical Air Command was replaced by Air Combat Command (ACC) as the gaining command for the 113th effective 1 June 1992. On 15 March 1992, the 113th adopted the new Air Force Objective Organization, which re-designated the wing as the 113th Fighter Wing. The 113th Tactical Fighter Group was reactivated as the 113th Operations Group, and the 121st Fighter Squadron was transferred to the 113th OG. Other support groups under the Objective Wing organization are the 179th Maintenance Group, 179th Mission Support Group and the 179th Medical Group. 121st Fighter Squadron F-16s over Washington DC In 1994 the 121st traded its early F-16A aircraft for Block 30 F-16C/D Fighting Falcon which upgraded its capabilities considerably. In May 1996, the 121st Fighter Squadron deployed personnel and aircraft to Al Jaber Air Base, Kuwait to support Operation Southern Watch (OSW). The 121st FS was the first Air National Guard unit to fly OSW. Operation Southern Watch was an operation which was responsible for enforcing the United Nations mandated no-fly zone below the 32nd parallel north in Iraq. This mission was initiated mainly to cover for attacks of Iraqi forces on the Iraqi Shi‚Äôite Muslims. In July 1996, the squadron returned to Andrews AFB. In mid-1996, the Air Force, in response to budget cuts, and changing world situations, began experimenting with Air Expeditionary organizations. The Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) concept was developed that would mix Active-Duty, Reserve and Air National Guard elements into a combined force. Instead of entire permanent units deploying as \\"Provisional\\" as in the 1991 Gulf War, Expeditionary units are composed of \\"aviation packages\\" from several wings, including active-duty Air Force, the Air Force Reserve Command and the Air National Guard, would be married together to carry out the assigned deployment rotation. In February 1997 the 121st Expeditionary Fighter Squadron (121st EFS) was first formed from 113th personnel and aircraft and deployed to Incirlik Air Base, Turkey in support of Operation Northern Watch (ONW). Operation Northern Watch was a US European Command Combined Task Force (CTF) who was responsible for enforcing the United Nations mandated no-fly zone above the 36th parallel north in Iraq. This mission was a successor to Operation Provide Comfort which also entailed support for the Iraqi Kurds. The 121st EFS returned to Andrews in April 1997. The 121st EFS was again formed in January 1998 when the Wing was tasked with a second Operation Northern Watch deployment to Incirlik Air Base. This time the deployment was only for a month with less than 100 personnel being deployed. Modern era On 11 September 2001, the wing was given authorization for its pilots to shoot down threatening aircraft over Washington DC. After the events of 11 September 2001 the squadron took on an Air Sovereignty Alert Detachment role, stationing a number of aircraft at air force bases around the country to fly alert missions as part of Operation Noble Eagle (ONE). 121st Expeditionary Fighter Squadron F-16C Fighting Falcon 86-0209 lifts off the runway at Balad AB, Iraq During one of those missions, on 11 May 2005 the squadron scrambled to intercept an aircraft that wandered into the no-fly zone around the White House. Customs officials had also scrambled a Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter and a UC-35B Cessna Citation jet at 11:47 a.m. to intercept the plane. The Customs aircraft gave way when the F-16s arrived flew on the wing tips of the little plane. They dipped their wings ‚Äì a pilot's signal to 'follow me' ‚Äì and tried to raise the pilot on the radio. But the Cessna didn't change course and it was flying too slow for the F-16s. The frustrated pilots had to take turns dropping flares, breaking away and returning to drop more flares. One senior Bush administration counter-terrorism official said it was 'a real finger- biting period' because they came very close to ordering a shot against a general aircraft. Finally, when the Cessna came within three miles of the White House ‚Äì just a few minutes flying time ‚Äì it altered course. In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, the DoD recommended that Cannon Air Force Base, NM be closed. As a result, it would distribute the 27th Fighter Wing‚Äôs F-16s to the 113th Wing, Andrews Air Force Base, MD (nine aircraft) and several other installations. The committee claimed that this move would sustain the active/Air National Guard/Air Force Reserve force mix by replacing aircraft that retire in the 2025 Force Structure Plan. However, the base was temporarily removed from closure 26 August 2005, pending review of new mission assignment. On 6 May 2008 the squadron flew its 2000th scramble since the events of 11 September 2001. Most scrambles do not lead to such stories as noted above.

History The history of the 201st Airlift Squadron began in 1946 with the activation of \\"H\\" Flight, HQ, District of Columbia Air National Guard. Operating out of Hangar 15 on the East side of Andrews Air Force Base, \\"H\\" Flight's assortment of B-26, C-47, C-53 and F-51 aircraft provided passenger airlift capabilities to the Air National Guard. In 1954 \\"H\\" Flight was re-designated as Detachment 1, HQ, District of Columbia Air National Guard. Over the next 38 years Detachment 1 employed more than 20 different types of aircraft to provide worldwide airlift support for both military and civilian passengers. Detachment 1 provided airlift support for large military teams as well as small command groups. The detachment also provided transportation for distinguished passengers such as the Vice President, congressional and cabinet members, service secretaries and local civic leaders. In 1984, Detachment 1 relocated to its current location on the West side of Andrews Air Force Base. On June 20, 1992, Detachment 1 was re- designated as the 201st Airlift Squadron, District of Columbia Air National Guard. Today the 201st Airlift Squadron continues to carry on the tradition of excellence that was started with \\"H\\" Flight in 1946. The continuing efforts to upgrade and expand the squadron's worldwide capabilities led to the acquisition of C-38As in 1998 and C-40Cs (Boeing 737) in 2002. The 201st retired their C-38A fleet in 2015, handing the aircraft off to the United States Navy. The events of September 11, 2001 marked a turning point in the history of the Squadron. The Global War on Terrorism brought a new emphasis on worldwide VIP travel. Since that date, the 201st Airlift Squadron's operational tempo has increased dramatically, with the majority of missions overseas. With its current complement of C-40Cs, the squadron provides worldwide air transportation for the executive branch, congressional members, Department of Defense and high-ranking U.S. and foreign dignitaries.

When splitting business development into two parts, we have: ‚Äòbusiness‚Äô and ‚Äòdevelopment‚Äô. The first things that come into mind when looking at business are: economics, finance, managerial activities, competition, prices, marketing, etc. All of these keywords are related to risk and entrepreneurship and clearly indicate the primary scope of the term ‚Äòbusiness development‚Äô. Development is very abstract and can be linked with some of the following keywords: technological improvement, cost reduction, general welfare, improved relations, movement in a (positive) direction, etc. In the traditional definition of Business development, Business Development is mostly seen as growing an enterprise, with a number of techniques. The mentioned techniques differ, but in fact all of them are about traditional marketing. The main question in these issues is: how to find, reach and approach customers and how to make/keep them satisfied, possibly with new products.Kotler, 2006 Since this definition is limited and lacks some essential factors in business developing, a complete new definition of Business Development will be introduced. Of course, the theory on ‚Äútraditional‚Äù marketing is still correct and can be adopted from the old definition. When supplying a solution, it is important to focus on the total offering you give instead of only focusing on the product or service. An offering is a package consisting of different proportions of physical product, service, advice, delivery and the costs, including price that are involved in using it. Hereby the advice, adaptation to the customer and the costs are the most important factors to get the right combination within the offering. Ford et al., 2006; Hakansson et al., 2004 Drawing on contingency theory, an idea central to new business development is that different product-market- technology combinations can require different marketing strategies and business models to make them a success (Tidd et al., 2005). To chart the factors that are involved and create synergy between them, new business development draws heavily upon the fields of technology and business networks. The new business development process is to recognize chances and opportunities in a fast changing technological environment. Often uncertainty arises because of new technology and their new markets.  Technology of Business  Innovative technology provide important opportunities for new business development. For a company it is important to keep products and processes up to date, to stay competitive (Ford et al., 2006). Continuous investment in innovation for both products and processes makes it more difficult for others to offer a large technological functionality advantage (Schilling, 2003). Many companies need technological development to stay competitive. Technological development can occur through making decisions about acquiring, exploiting and managing technologies. These decisions should be made by involving the research and development staff, purchasing staff and marketers. (Ford et al., 2006) The customers are also important (Schilling, 2003; Ford et al., 2006). Furthermore technology can be analyzed by the concept/framework of value configuration as introduced by Norwegian academics Stabell and Fjedstad (1998).Stabell, C. B. and O. D. Fjeldstad, \\"Configuring Value for Competitive Advantage: on Chains, Shops and Networks\\", Strategic Management Journal, 19(5), 1998: 413-437 The framework consists of three value configurations, which are an extension of the value chain model developed by Michael Porter: *the value chain (transformation of inputs in products), *the value shop (solving customer problems), and * the value network (linking customers). These configurations overcome some of the issues with the traditional value chain model, which is only helpful for traditional manufacturing companies. In practice, firms are not pure instances of a single distinct value configuration, multiple combinations of configurations can be found within one firm. The value creation process can also be understood from the perspective of Schilling. Schilling talks about value in the sense of technological functionality, installed base and complementary goods of a product. (Schilling, 2003). It may be clear that technology plays an important role in this value creation process, and in general contributes to the process of renewing the match between problem and solution.  Business networks  Traditional marketing is usually based on economic models (Williamson, 1975). In those pure economic models there is no room for negotiations or special treatment for different companies. A technological environment, however, can be very uncertain and therefore competitors have to rely heavily on their business networks. It is then that special treatments and negotiations are necessary. It is important to recognize the effect social relations have on economic action, including business development (Ford et al., 2006). Granovetter also argues that social relations in a network lead to trust between partners, an important factor for stable development in a dynamic environment. By focusing on these new activities, it becomes difficult to keep every activity up-to-date and to maintain the competitive advantage (Ford et al., 2006). Companies therefore increasingly concentrate their investment and their activities on only a few activities which they believe to be their core business, otherwise their competitive advantage is easily lost. Because they concentrate on just a few activities, they need business relations for the other activities (Ford et al., 2006). Relationships are usually based on resource ties, activity links and/or actor bonds (Ford et al., 2006). A company should therefore analyze their firm itself, their relationships and their business networks in terms of activities, actors and resources. In this way, a company can determine where there are new opportunities for relationships and where resources, technologies and/or skills can be developed, integrated or exploited from other companies (Ford et al., 2006). In this way, business development can be established with help of this business network. Nowadays, marketing is about the exchange of heterogeneous resources between dynamic, cooperating partners in network-like structures (Hakansson et al., 2004). It is about relationships, not about selling products. So, business marketers should be busy finding, developing and managing of relationships within the complex network that surrounds them (Ford et al., 2006). Blois (2004) provides three ways in which a firm can evolve from market to network mechanism. These are entrepreneurial alertness (being alert to value-creating opportunities), path dependence (historical events cause solutions to problems and become ‚Äúlocked in‚Äù) and replaceability (irreplaceable contributors get much attention of others trying to influence them). It is still questionable to what extent these networks are involved by social relations, since the mentioned authors do not agree on this. Therefore, enterprises have to cope with the problem of how to maintain their network contacts.  References  Further reading *Ford, D., L. E. Gadde, et al. (2006).

The field lies in water depths of approximately . When the discovery of the field was initially reported, it caused widespread commotion because of the speculated size of the field, which surpassed the Mexican Cantarell Complex, the biggest oil field complex outside of the Middle East.

The field was taken into production in December 2016 and is operated by Petrobras with BG and Repsol-Sinopec as partners.

Being discovered in the pre-salt of the Santos Basin after the giant Tupi oil field (2007), then called Tupi, and just before J√∫piter in January 2008, the first reports about the reserves caused high expectations.

The operator of the field, state oil company Petrobras, refuted this statement as it was \\"far too early\\" to know the size of the field while the first appraisal well Sugar Loaf-1 was still drilling. The oil price plummeted after the announcement of the discovery.Ruppert, 2009, p.39 The excitement about Carioca has been mentioned as an example of \\"oil fever\\" in the exploration of the Brazilian deepwater pre-salt plays. After appraisal of the field, the reserve estimate was downsized to and taken into production in December 2016.Lapa Field  Reservoir  The reservoir of the Lapa oil field is the pre-salt Guaratiba Group, a Hauterivian to Aptian sequence of limestones and clastic sediments of which the microbialite, stromatolite-like limestone hosts vast amounts of oil.

In addition to natural sand beaches, including Purple Sands Beach with vibrantly striped bands of sand in purple, magenta, and pink, the lake contains a number of sport fish species including northern pike, walleye, yellow perch, burbot, lake whitefish, white sucker, longnose sucker and shorthead redhorse. The lake takes its name from a Cree legend about flickering lights appearing near the north end of the lake, which have supposedly been seen right up to contemporary times. Some theorize that the lights are caused by a gas emitted from decaying driftwood, rather than having a paranormal origin. The level in Candle Lake is regulated by a four-bay 3.1 m concrete dam, constructed in 1978-1979 and operated by the Saskatchewan Watershed Authority. The dam discharges into the Torch River.

It borrows heavily from concepts in the 1979 film Alien. Gameplay The Alien is a game in which the crew of a ship must deal with a hostile alien species. Gameplay proceeds in turns and requires an analogue joystick to play. Actions are selected through a series of menus which are only accessible by holding the controller in varying degrees between up, centre and down. Using a digital controller with only absolute up, centre and down positions will mean that only a few options are available. In Alien, the player controls a crew of seven people who are on a spaceship with an alien that is running loose. The object of the game is to capture or kill the alien. The crew can employ stun guns or lethal weapons to try to neutralise the alien. As a last resort, the player can use a self-destruct mechanism in the ship and the remaining crew can flee in an escape pod. The game has two screens: a text screen and a map screen. Each turn has three phases - one phase uses the map screen and the other two use the text screens. The first phase of each turn takes place on the text screen. Every turn begins with the message: Sensors indicate movement of life forms within the ship. Play then moves to each room where a crewmember is present. During the text-screen phases, the player is given a description of the room and which crewmembers are in it. This also includes objects and creatures in the room. In this mode, the player can interact with objects in the room, such as attempting to capture an animal or attacking an alien. During the second phase of the game, which takes place on the map screen, the player can move the crew around the ship and have the drop and take items. The third phase returns the player to the text screen. Although the player issues commands to each crewmember, the characters in the game will not necessarily obey those commands. For example, a crewmember may refuse to attack the alien or to enter a restricted area. If the player instructs a crewmember to attack the alien early in the game, the player may also receive the message regulations forbid killing of creatures which can be controlled otherwise. The alien will attempt to kill any of the crew that encounter it. If the alien kills a crewmember, the remaining crew will re-assemble on the bridge to \\"discuss the situation\\". The alien will also metamorphose during the course of the game and becomes more lethal as it changes. Eventually, the alien will also begin to multiply. Reception Johnny Wilson reviewed the game for Computer Gaming World, and stated that \\"'The Alien' is an interesting strategy game which will take many hours of gaming to master. Variables in number and locations of aliens, rate of metamorphosis, and identity (or existence) of the android crew member offer the possibility of an above-average shelf life.\\" References External links *Review in Softalk 1982 video games Alien (franchise) games Apple II games Avalon Hill video games FM-7 games Horror video games NEC PC-8801 games Strategy video games Survival video games Turn-based strategy video games Video games about extraterrestrial life Video games developed in the United States Video games set in outer space ","title":"Alien (Avalon Hill)"},{"id":"15992439","text":"Onofrio Sciortino was an Italian-American mobster and boss of the San Jose crime family. Early career The date of his accomplishments was considered to be 1942. It is almost certain that organized crime existed before this date. Sciortino would derive a majority of his profits from loansharking, gambling and prostitution. He was considered the first official La Cosa Nostra crime boss of San Jose until his death from natural causes on September 10, 1959. His successor Sciortino's successor was his underboss, Joseph Cerrito. Cerrito came to America from Sicily during the 1920s and moved to the San Jose area in the early 1940s. During the November 1957 Appalachian Summit of mob bosses, Cerrito was one of many who was caught by law enforcement and would answer to a grand jury on the matter in 1959. In October 1964, Cerrito was identified when he was found meeting Bonanno LCN Family former consigliere Frank Garofalo, at a hotel in Palermo, Sicily. It was believed that the two were discussing the ensuing war within the Bonanno crime family, which would later be dubbed as the \\"Banana War.\\" Cerrito was a well-accomplished businessman with two car dealerships in San Jose and one in Los Gatos. In the late 1960s, Cerrito and \\"made\\" soldier, Pete Misuraca, were implicated but never tried for attempted extortion plot against of a Reno-based resort. In 1968, LIFE Magazine publicly identified Cerrito as the crime boss over San Jose. He sued for libel, but the case was eventually dismissed. He died on September 8, 1978 from natural causes as one of the most successful crime lords over a very small family. Addiction Sciortino was reportedly a gambling addict, often squandering upwards of a million dollars per day. To support his habit, he engaged in extensive racketering, ranging from counterfeiting and shylocking to prostitution and extortion throughout San Jose. Death Sciortino died from a massive heart attack in his Sicilian while reading a newspaper.

The 178th is equipped with the MQ-9 Reaper. Overview The 178th Reconnaissance Squadron includes operations of the MQ-1 Predator, a medium- altitude, long-endurance, remotely piloted aircraft. The MQ-1's primary mission is interdiction and conducting armed reconnaissance against critical, perishable targets. When the MQ-1 is not actively pursuing its primary mission, it acts as the Joint Forces Air Component Commander-owned theater asset for reconnaissance, surveillance and target acquisition in support of the Joint Forces commander. History =World War II= Training in the United States P-39D as used by the group for training The squadron was first organized as the 392d Fighter Squadron at Hamilton Field, California on 15 July 1943, as one of the original squadrons of the 367th Fighter Group.Maurer, Combat Units, pp. 252‚Äì254Maurer, Combat Squadrons, pp. 481‚Äì482 Several members of its initial cadre were former Flying Tigers with prior combat experience. It was not until late August, however, that the group received its first Bell P-39 Airacobra.Groh, p. 12 After building up its strength, the squadron moved in October to Santa Rosa Army Air Field, California. In December group headquarters moved to Oakland Municipal Airport, while the 392d was at Sacramento Municipal Airport. The squadron moved temporarily Tonopah Army Air Field, Nevada, where they performed dive bombing and gunnery training. Training accidents with the Bell P-39 Airacobra cost several pilots their lives. In January 1944, as it prepared for overseas movement, the 392d was beefed up with personnel from the 328th and 368th Fighter Groups.Chickering, p. 78 The squadron staged through Camp Shanks, and sailed for England aboard the .Groh, pp. 23‚Äì24 The \\"Drunken Duchess\\"Nicknamed for its unusual rolling motion in heavy weather. Groh, p. 23. docked at Greenock, Scotland on 3 April and the group was transported by train to its airfield at RAF Stoney Cross, England. P-38 transition and combat operations from England 392d Fighter Squadron P-38Aircraft is Lockheed P-38G-10-LO Lightning, serial 42-12982 Having trained on single engine aircraft, the squadron's pilots were surprised to find Lockheed P-38 Lightnings sitting on Stoney Cross's dispersal pads.Chickering, p. 79 Only members of the advance party had any experience flying the Lightning. These pilots had flown combat sorties with the 55th Fighter Group.Groh, p. 26 The change from single engine to twin engine aircraft required considerable retraining for both pilots and ground crew. Although some pilots entered combat with as little as eight hours of flying time on the P-38, in late April the squadron was reinforced by pilots who had trained on the Lightning in the States and were more experienced on the type.Groh, p. 31 However, the lack of instrument training in the P-38 took its toll on the 392d as weather, not enemy action, caused the loss of pilots and airplanes.Groh, pp. 50‚Äì51 On 9 May, the squadron flew its first combat mission, a fighter sweep over Alen√ßon.Groh. p. 32 For the remainer of the month, the unit flew fighter sweeps, bomber escort and dive bombing, missions and suffered its first combat losses.Groh. pp. 32‚Äì37 On D-Day and the next three days the squadron flew missions maintaining air cover over shipping carrying invasion troops. These missions continued for the next three days. The 392d and other P-38 units stationed in England were selected for these missions with the expectation that the distinctive silhouette of the Lightning would prevent potential friendly fire incidents by anti-aircraft gunners mistaking them for enemy fighters.Groh, p. 42 Shortly after the Normandy invasion, on 12 June, the 367th Group was selected to test the ability of the P-38 to carry a 2,000 lb bomb under each wing. The selected target was a railroad yard, and results were mixed.Groh, p. 43 By mid June German ground forces had withdrawn to defend a perimeter around Cherbourg, a major port whose capture had become more important to the allies with the destruction of Mulberry A, one of the artificial harbors constructed near the Normandy beachhead. An attack by VII Corps on 22 June was to be preceded by low level bombing and strafing attack by IX Fighter Command. Briefed by intelligence to expect a \\"milk run\\" The 394th flew at low altitude through what turned out to be a heavily defended area. Seven group pilots were killed in action. Nearly all surviving aircraft received battle damage and the entire 367th Group was out of action for several days.Groh, p. 46 Ninth Air Force moved its medium bomber forces to bases closer to the Continent in July, so they would be able to strike targets near the expanding front in France. The 387th Bombardment Group was moved to Stoney Cross, forcing the 392d to vacate their station and move the short distance to RAF Ibsley.Groh, p. 52 From Ibsley the group struck railroads, marshaling yards, and trains to prevent enemy reinforcements from reaching the front during the Allied breakthrough at Saint Lo in July 1944. Operations on the European Continent Starting on 19 July, the 367th Group's forward echelon crossed the English Channel to take up stations in Normandy.Groh, p. 59 Group headquarters shared Beuzeville Airfield with the 371st Fighter Group, while the 392d Squadron was at Carentan Airfield, advanced landing grounds made from pierced steel planking. After the breakout of ground forces in the Saint-L√¥ area, the squadron concentrated on close air support of General Patton's Third Army. In late August, the squadron attacked German Seventh Army convoys which, to prevent being surrounded, were withdrawing eastward from the Falaise pocket. Five convoys and 100 Tiger Tanks were destroyed on one day. On 22 August the group attacked three Luftwaffe airfields near Laon. The squadron dive bombed and destroyed two hangars on one airfield but were jumped by twelve Focke-Wulf Fw 190s as they completed their attack. Eighteen Messerschmitt Me 109s and Fw 190s engaged the 393d Fighter Squadron as it reformed from its dive bomb run. After bombing its target, the 394th Fighter Squadron turned to reinforce the 392d. The squadrons of the 367th Group claimed fourteen enemy aircraft in total against a loss of one Lightning. The 392d received a Distinguished Unit Citation when it returned to the Laon area three days later. That day, the 367th Group attacked Luftwaffe airfields at Clastres, P√©ronne and Rosi√®res-en-Haye through an intense flak barrage. The group then engaged more than thirty Focke-Wulf 190 fighters that had just taken off. Group claims were 25 enemy aircraft destroyed, one probably destroyed and 17 damaged against the loss of 6 group aircraft.These claims were from an estimated 50 enemy aircraft engaged in the air and on the ground. Chickering, p. 79 Then, despite a low fuel supply, the unit strafed a train and convoy after leaving the scene of battle. In the afternoon the squadron conducted a long range fighter sweep of more than 800 miles to airfields in the Dijon-Bordeaux area.Groh, p. 72 As Allied forces moved forward across France the squadron began leap-frogging to new bases. In early September they relocated at Peray Airfield, but moved again a week later to Clastres Airfield. From Clastres The 392d supported Operation Market-Garden by escorting troop carrier aircraft and attacking flak positions. For its attacks that fall, the squadron was cited in the Order of the Day by the Belgium Army. In late October, as Ninth Air Force brought its medium bombers to bases in France, the 392d was bumped from its station for the second time by the 387th Bombardment Group, when it moved to Juvincourt Airfield (A-68), north of Reims.Maurer, Combat Units, p. 274 Juvincourt was a former Luftwaffe base with permanent facilities, in contrast to the advanced landing grounds where the squadron had been based since moving to France.Groh, pp. 98‚Äì99 The squadron attacked German strong points to aid the Allied push against the Siegfried Line throughout the fall of 1944. The German Ardennes Offensive occurred as the holidays approached. A planned move to a field in Belgium was canceled. During the Battle of the Bulge, the 392d, after escorting C-47s on a resupply drop to encircled troops at Bastogne, conducted an armed reconnaissance of the Trier area. Transition to the P-47 Thunderbolt 367th Fighter Group commander's P-47D Early in 1945 a desire to standardize the fighter-bombers in Ninth Air Force, the group transitioned into Republic P-47 Thunderbolts. Pilots flew Lightings on combat missions while training at the same time with the Thunderbolt. Using the Thunderbolt the group was again cited in a Belgium Army Order of the Day, earning the Belgian Fourragere. The 392d received a second Distinguished Unit Citation for action on 19 March 1945. The 367th Group's target was the headquarters of Field Marshal Kesselring, the German Commander-ln-Chief, West,Kesselring assumed command the day of the attack. American intelligence believed Field Marshall von Rundstedt was still in command. Groh, p. 136. at Ziegenburg near Bad Nauheim, Germany. Aircraft of the leading 394th Fighter Squadron would attack at low level to achieve surprise, carrying a 1,000-pound bomb under each wing. The P-47s of the 392d would be similarly armed, but would dive bomb from a higher altitude. The bombs were equipped with time-delay fuses intended to crack the concrete roofs of the bunker. The 393d Fighter Squadron carried napalm intended to seep into the bunkers and burn what remained. The attack was scheduled for a time that intelligence reports indicated would find senior staff and commanders at lunch, the only time they would not be in the reinforced tunnels underneath the castle that housed the headquarters. The target was located in mountainous terrain well defended by antiaircraft artillery. Moreover, to avoid alerting the Germans to the pending attack, photographic reconnaissance aircraft had avoided the area, so detailed target photography was not available. The day of the attack the castle was concealed by ground haze which caused the 394th Fighter Squadron to stray off course at the last minute, preventing them from executing the attack as planned and reducing the element of surprise.Groh, p. 136 Although senior German officers reached the underground bunkers and survived the attack, the group reduced the military complex to ruins, disrupting communications and the flow of intelligence at a critical time. The squadron struck tanks, trucks, flak positions, and other objectives in support of the assault across the Rhine late in March and the final allied operations in Germany. It was commended by the commanding generals of XII Corps and the 11th Armored Division for the close air support the unit provided for their commands. On 10 April the squadron moved to Eschborn Airfield on the northwest side of Frankfurt, Germany. The 392d flew its last combat mission, a defensive patrol, one year after entering combat on 8 May.Groh, p. 158 During its combat tour, the squadron was credited with 39.5 air-to-air victories over enemy aircraft, the most of any of the squadrons in the group.Newton & Senning, p. 645 Return to the United States and inactivation All hostilities ceased the following day, exactly one year after the squadron became operational. On 4 June, the 367th Group led a flyby for General Weyland. On 1 July it was announced the 392d was to redeploy to the Pacific Theater of Operations after it was re-equipped with and trained with long range P-47Ns in preparation for Operation Downfall, the invasion of Japan. The squadron moved to Camp Detroit in France then to a staging area near Marseille. Here it boarded two ships, the , and the . When Japan surrendered, the Morton was diverted to Newport News, Virginia while the Ericcson sailed for Staten Island, New York. Following leave for everyone, the few personnel that remained in the squadron after transfers and discharges reassembled at Seymour Johnson Field, North Carolina on 2 November, and the 394th was inactivated there on 7 November 1945. =North Dakota Air National Guard= The wartime 392d Fighter Squadron was redesignated as the 178th Fighter Squadron and allotted to the National Guard on 24 May 1946. It was organized at Hector Field near Fargo, North Dakota and was extended federal recognition on 16 January 1947. The squadron was equipped with North American P-51D Mustangs trained in air defense. Korean War activation On 1 March 1951 the 178th was federalized and brought on active duty due to the Korean War. It moved to Moody Air Force Base, Georgia, where it became part of Strategic Air Command (SAC), and was assigned to the federalized 146th Fighter-Bomber Group. The 146th Group was composed of the 178th, the 186th Fighter-Bomber Squadron and the 190th Fighter-Bomber Squadron. The unit remained a Moody until October when it moved to George Air Force Base, California, where it became part of Tactical Air Command (TAC) in November. It trained with its Mustangs as a tactical unit and augmented the air defenses of the United States.See Ravenstein, pp. 40‚Äì41 (mission of replacement unit) The 178th Fighter-Bomber Squadron was released from active duty and returned on paper to North Dakota state control on 1 January 1953. Its personnel and equipment at George were transferred to the 72d Fighter-Bomber Squadron, which was simultaneously activated.See Maurer, Combat Squadrons, pp. 265‚Äì266 (activation of 72d Squadron at George) Air Defense 178th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron F-4D PhantomAircraft is McDonnell F-4D-26-MC Phantom serial 64-965, taken in 1979. The aircraft is painted in Air Defense Tactical Air Command gray. The squadron was redesignated the 178th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron and reactivated at Fargo the same day. In September 1953 the squadron began to keep two F-51D Mustangs on alert status 14 hours a day. The squadron continued to maintain this alert in various forms for over 50 years until it lost its fighter mission in the summer of 2007. On 1 November 1954, the 192d began the transition from the piston-engine, propeller driven F-51D to its first jet aircraft, the Lockheed F-94A Starfire interceptor. The Starfire was armed with 20 millimeter cannon and was equipped with radar. On 15 April 1956, the 178th was authorized to expand to a group level, and the 119th Fighter Group (Air Defense) was established to command the squadron and its associated support units. The 178th became the new group's flying squadron. Other units assigned into the group were the 119th Material Squadron, 119th Air Base Squadron and the 119th USAF Dispensary. The \\"Happy Hooligan\\" pilots upgraded to the Northrop F-89 Scorpion in 1958. Its first Scorpions were F-89Ds, armed with Mighty Mouse rockets, but a year later the squadron began to receive the F-89J, which could carry the nuclear armed MB-1 Genie (later AIR-2). The Scorpion was also equipped with data link for interception control through the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment system. The 178th was one of the last units to fly the F-89, only replacing then in 1966 when it received the supersonic Convair F-102A Delta Dagger interceptor, armed with AIM-4 Falcons. It replaced its \\"Deuces\\" in 1969 with McDonnell F-101B Voodoo interceptors. In 1977, it began tp fly McDonnell F-4 Phantom IIs, and two years later, its mobilization gaining command changed to TAC, when ADC was inactivated and replaced by Air Defense Tactical Air Command. The unit's first overseas deployment occurred in 1983, when six Phantoms and 120 support personnel deployed to Naval Air Station Keflavik, Iceland. Eight Soviet Tupolev Tu-95 Bear bombers were intercepted by Hooligan pilots during the deployment. In 1986, the 119th Fighter Group became the first Guard unit to assume the USAF Zulu alert mission at Ramstein Air Base, West Germany in Operation Creek Klaxon. The 119th and other air defense units rotated to Ramstein and stood continuous alert for one year, to provide air sovereignty in Western Europe for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. During Operation Desert Storm in 1991, 107 Happy Hooligans were mobilized and deployed to support operations at numerous locations within the United States. F-16A of the 178th FS takes off on a practice scrambleAircraft is F-16A serial 81-777 piloted by Maj. Michael DePree at Langley AFB. The aircraft was retired to the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group on 5 December 2006. Reported as destined for Jordanian Air Force. The 178th FS converted from the F-4 Phantom to the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon in mid-1990. The first squadron \\"Vipers\\" were mostly older Block 5 and 10 models. although some Block 15 aircraft were delivered to the squadron. The main task for the unit remained air defense, as with many Guard units that were equipped with the F-16. In 1991 the F-16s were modified to be brought up to the Air Defense Fighter variant of the plane . This improved the performance and capability of the squadron in their air defense role. The Hooligans earned first place at the October 1994 William Tell worldwide weapons meet. William Tell tests pilots and ground crews from the Air Force fighter units in air-to-air combat. This was the Hooligans' third William Tell victory, which it added to wins in 1970 and 1972. It also placed first among F-4 units in William Tell 1986. In 1994 the 119th Group won the Hughes Trophy which recognizes the most outstanding air-to-air unit in the Air Force. The only Air National Guard unit to win the award twice, the Hooligans are also the only F-16 unit ever to win the Hughes Trophy. A permanent alert detachment of the squadron was established at Kingsley Field, Oregon, beginning 1 October 1989. The detachment, staffed by 18 members, was relocated to March Air Force Base, California, on 31 July 1994 when the Oregon Air National Guard took over air defense at Kingsley. An announcement was made in March 1999 that the squadron would convert from an air defense mission to a general purpose mission with 15 F-16A/B aircraft while activating an alert detachment at Langley Air Force Base, Virginia on 1 March 1999. The March and Langley detachments remained in operation as long as the squadron operated the \\"Viper.\\" Current status The 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission recommended that the mission of the North Dakota Air National Guard be realigned. The 119th Fighter Wing's F-16As (15 aircraft) were reaching the end of their operational life and would retire. In Jan 2007, the 119th ended its F-16 mission after almost 60 years of air defense interceptor missions. Replacing the F-16s in 2007, the squadron began to receive the C-21A Learjet and was redesignated the 178th Airlift Squadron. The C-21 has room for eight passengers and 42 ft¬≥ (1.26 m¬≥) of cargo. In addition to its normal role, the aircraft is capable of transporting litters during medical evacuations. Later in 2007, it was announced that C-21 operations would be transferred to the newly activated 177th Airlift Squadron, and the 179th would convert to operating the MQ-1 Predator and be redesignated the 178th Reconnaissance Squadron. In 2008 it received its first Predator.

Unlike bank loans, gemach loans are interest-free, and are often set up with easy repayment terms. Gemachs operate in most Jewish communities. The traditional gemach concept -- that of a money- lending fund -- extends loans on a short- or long-term basis for any need, including emergency loans, medical expenses, wedding expenses, etc. However, many people have expanded the concept of gemachs to include free loans of household items, clothing, books, equipment, services and advice. Gemachs may be operated both on a communal basis (such as by treasurers of community funds) and an internal basis (such as by businesses, organizations, schools and families). The ideal of contributing to or forming one's own gemach was popularized by Rabbi Yisrael Meir Kagan (the Chofetz Chaim), who addressed many halachic questions about the practice and lauded its spiritual benefits in his landmark book, Ahavat Chesed (\\"Loving Kindness\\"). Biblical source Money gemachs fulfill the Biblical imperative, \\"You shall lend money to my people\\" (Exodus 22:24) as well as the Biblical injunction, \\"You shall not give him your money for interest, nor may you give him your food for increase\\" (Leviticus 25:37). Gemachs which provide other services, such as clothing, books and equipment, fall under the general Biblical commandment to do kindness, \\"Love your neighbor as yourself\\" (Leviticus 19:18).  Modern history Gemachs, known as Jewish or Hebrew Free Loan Societies in English- speaking countries, were among the first institutions established by Jewish immigrants to the United States from Eastern Europe. Most gemachim were founded between 1880 and 1914 in communities where Jews settled, although some were established as late as 1940. The Hebrew Free Loan Society of New York, the oldest gemach in America, was established in 1892 when 11 men pooled their savings to establish it. They initially raised $95, which they loaned out in increments of $5 and $10. The society is still in existence today. By the turn of the 20th century there were approximately 500 gemachs in the United States. One reason for their prevalence was that banks did not want to make loans to low-income Jewish borrowers. But with repayment rates exceeding 99 percent, banks eventually realized that Jewish borrowers were desirable customers, and began loaning to them in the 1940s. The global financial crisis of 2008‚Äì2009 sparked a resurgence of gemachim in some cities. Milwaukee, which had a gemach at the turn of the century, is in the process of creating a new free-loan society. Types of loans Gemachs are best known for lending money on a short- or long-term basis. The size of the loan will depend on the lender's resources. A home-based gemach might offer loans of $100 and up, while a wedding gemach may extend a loan of several thousand dollars. Typically, gemachs also offer favorable repayment terms, enabling borrowers to repay the loan over a long period of time, in keeping with the imperative of \\"doing kindness.\\" One Jerusalem family offers loans of $750 with repayment of $150 per month. A wedding gemach offers a $3000 loan with repayment of $100 per month. The Israel Free Loan Association (IFLA) is the largest interest free loan association in the world, with loans from NIS 20,000 for individuals up to NIS 90,000 for small businesses (www.freeloan.org.il) and serves Israeli citizens anywhere in Israel. While poor families and individuals in debt are frequent users of gemachs, borrowers need not be poor. Money gemachs also cater to students, workers, or any individual in need of a loan. Internal money gemachs are common fixtures in yeshivas, synagogues, and workplaces, among others. The gemach concept has expanded to include free loans of household items, clothing, books, equipment, services and advice. Following is a sampling of gemach services found in the Jerusalem telephone directory of 2002: > Low chairs and other necessities for mourning; food for simchas; food for > the needy; food for hospital visitors; moving boxes; used clothes; English > and American stamps; Dead Sea mud; sewing patterns; hosting guests; hosting > guests near hospitals; transporting invalids; wedding needs; wedding > dresses; health food and vitamins; tallits; telephone cards; cell phones; > form letters; burners; tools; banquet dishes; tables and chairs; playpens; > fans; loudspeakers; baby paraphernalia; suitcases; mezuzahs; mattresses; > partitions; computers; water urns; folding beds; microwaves; haircutting > equipment; inhalers; sewing machines; tablecloths; cameras; blankets; > projectors; fridges and freezers; toys; glasses; candles; segulot; ladders; > pots; sifrei Torah; books; cribs; film; Shabbat hot plates; Shabbat > candlesticks; furniture; vacuum cleaners; work tools and more. The Neve Yaakov telephone directory currently includes gemach listings for a plumber and a guitarist who offer free advice by telephone. Southfield, MI (Detroit) has a gemach for baby items such as strollers, high chairs, and packnplays. Chicago was the first city to create a gemach of educational materials and resources for teachers in Jewish education.https://view.joomag.com/jewish-life-digital-edition- june-2015/0546067001433887810?page=84 Repayment To ensure repayment of a money loan, gemachs will typically ask the borrower to provide two guarantors as co-signers on the loan. (In halakha this is known as areivut.) Should the borrower fail to repay on time, the gemach owner can turn to these co-signers and demand repayment, a claim which will be upheld in a beit din (Jewish rabbinical court). Laws also pertain to the person who borrows clothing, equipment, or other items from a gemach. Goods that are damaged must be replaced or reimbursed. Although a Jew should lend to those in need, he is not obligated to continue to lend to someone who consistently loses things or returns them damaged.

The student newspaper gained the name University Press in 1971.University Press History History When South Park Junior College, now Lamar University, began in 1923, a Student Publications Board was appointed to study the need for a student newspaper. The committee decided that, indeed, the school needed a newspaper. The committee and the student body came up with the contraction for South Park and the word ‚ÄúPlug‚Äù to indicate action ‚Äî hence, The S‚ÄôPark Plug. Elery Holland was named the first editor. The staff managed to publish four issues for 1923-24, quite an accomplishment for a fledgling little school. E.C. Brodie, an English professor, served as the first faculty adviser. During the Flapper era and before the collapse of the Stock Market on October 28 and 29, 1929, student publications flourished. But during the 1930s, money was hard to come by. The newspaper did manage to keep going, but staffs were not able to bring out issues on a regular basis. Much later, during World War II, newsprint and staffing were not available, so the newspaper suspended publication for what Americans called ‚ÄúThe Duration.‚Äù In 1946, however, the Depression and World War II were over, and Student Publications got back to normal. The S‚ÄôPark Plug, which had become The Redbird when South Park College became Lamar College in 1932, started publishing an edition every other week. These changes were made to try to establish a separate identity for the college from the South Park school district, which had been its parent. By the mid 1950s, The Redbird was publishing weekly. When Lamar gained university status in 1971, the student body voted to change the name of the newspaper to the University Press to give the newspaper an identity correlating with the school‚Äôs new status. By the early 1970s, lack of finances were back in the picture. The Cardinal, a very expensive operation and separate from the University Press, had had a series of disastrous years in sales and staffing. Students were no longer willing to work on it and they were no longer willing to buy it. The university put some of its best talent into managing the publication and many editions were award winners. But when the staff got down to two students and only 27 students purchased it, the writing was on the wall. The 1975 edition was the last. The University Press inherited a part of the yearbook budget, and, for the first time, in 1976-77, began publishing twice weekly ‚Äî every Wednesday and Friday. From 1976 until 1985, the University Press published a slick magazine, also named Cardinal. The publication won every award given to magazines by the Southwestern Journalism Congress and the Texas Intercollegiate Press Association, including sweepstakes (highest points scored by any magazine) for six of its nine years in existence. Again, in 1985, a financial crunch hit the Golden Triangle owing to falling oil prices and Student Publications cut costs by canceling the expensive slick. Later, a newspaper magazine called UPBeat was started as a supplement, more in keeping with today‚Äôs trends. Although the name ‚ÄúS‚ÄôPark Plug‚Äù died many years ago, it remains apropos in describing the tradition that students since Elery Holland, that first editor, have continued in making the UP something of which the University is quite proud. Awards & Acclaim The University Press has grown into one of Lamar‚Äôs showpieces. It is the largest student-run business on campus, and it has become one of the most respected student newspapers in the country. Since 1977, the University Press and its magazines have garnered more than 1200 awards, including first place for Best Non-Daily Student Newspaper in 1994 and 2005 from The Associated Press Managing Editors of Texas and second place from the same group in 1988, 1997, 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004. The UP has averaged more than 38 awards a year in those 29 years. The University Press is also fortunate to be one of the best equipped newspapers, with one of the largest state-of-the-art Apple computer systems in Southeast Texas. The University Press won second place in the non daily student paper category in 2011.http://advancement.lamar.edu/lamar- student-newspaper-earns-associated-press-honors The UP is a member of the Texas Intercollegiate Press Association and the Press Club of Southeast Texas. Staff & Students The staff consistently attracts some of the best students on campus. These students have gone on to become leaders in the media industry, including the staffs of all three dailies in the Golden Triangle, teachers of journalism in most of the Golden Triangle high schools, CNN, Turner Broadcasting, The Associated Press, the Houston Chronicle, the Dallas Morning News, editors of in-house publications, heads of advertising agencies, and the list goes on. The UP, as it is popularly called, also consistently attracts one of the most diversified staffs, both ethnically and culturally, of any organization on campus. Some countries represented by staffs over the years include, in addition to the United States, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Ecuador, Sweden, England, Spain, Germany, Belgium, Australia, Viet Nam, Taiwan, Mainland China, Japan, India, France, Cuba, Pakistan, Iran, Zimbabwe and Thailand. Howard Perkins, director of student publications from September 1976 to 2011, served five terms as president of the Southwestern Journalism Congress. He is the only person in journalism education that was recognized with a special scholarship named in his honor by the organization. He has also served as president, vice president, scholarship chairman, and adviser-of-the- year chairman for the Texas Intercollegiate Press Association. He was elected Adviser-of-the-Year by that organization in 1979 ‚Äî a lifetime award.

The show has run nonstop since 1988 on Canale 5 and Rete 4, and switched from a trilon to an electronic board in the mid 1990s, like the U.S. version.See the Wheel of Fortune (US game show) article for more details on gameplay. Previously hosted by Mike Bongiorno, the show was hosted by Enrico Papi on Italia 1, and featured Victoria Silvstedt from the French version of the show, La Roue de la Fortune. The Italian version of Wheel went off the air in 2010. In 1985, the show was one of several game shows that was part of the television series, Pentatlon, which was also hosted by Mike Bongiorno. The show aired on Canale 5. From September 1987 to 1988, the show aired on Odeon TV. This version had the shopping element that the U.S. version, along with several other versions at the time, had. This version had a different host.  Differences in Gameplay Compared to American Version = The Electronic Puzzle Board (circa 1998-2003)= This is the only puzzle board in the world where if more than one letter was revealed, the hostess only had to touch one and all would simultaneously appear. Prior to its introduction, and like many other versions, the board used trilons.  2008  The board on the modern Italian version acted like the US version's puzzle board in that letters would light up one at a time, and the hostess had to touch all letters. =Vowels= In 2002, the price for buying a vowel changed from ‚Ç§1,000,000 to ‚Ç¨300. On the 2007 revival, each vowel cost ‚Ç¨200. =The Wheel= The round one wheel from 1988 with all values in multiples of 1000 with 1,000,000 liras (represented by the number 1000) as top value. When the show was on 'Pentatlon' using Italian Lira as its currency, the 15-wedge wheel configuration ran from ‚Ç§100,000 to ‚Ç§1 Million. On the Odeon version, the number of wedges increased to 24, and amounts ranged from ‚Ç§50,000 to ‚Ç§1,000,000. In round 3, the amounts increased with ‚Ç§100,000 as the smallest and ‚Ç§3,000,000 as the biggest. In 1989, ‚Ç§1,000,000, ‚Ç§1,300,000, and ‚Ç§2,000,000 were the top amounts of the first three rounds. The following year, the smallest amount of ‚Ç§200,000 increased to ‚Ç§300,000, and ‚Ç§1,000,000 became the top amount for the first two rounds. This changed from ‚Ç¨150 to ‚Ç¨500 (‚Ç¨200 to ‚Ç¨1,000 in round 3) when Italy decided to go to Euros in 2002. From 1999 to 2001, however, a blue band was inserted at the wheel's edge showing the euro value equivalent to each corresponding wedge. For example, a wedge worth ‚Ç§300,000 had a blue band noting that the same wedge was worth ‚Ç¨154.94. In 2001, euro and lira values swapped positions. By 2002, the band was removed, and the euro values were changed again, ranging from ‚Ç¨50 to ‚Ç¨300 (‚Ç¨100 to ‚Ç¨600 in round 3). Values were displayed in thousands of liras from 1989 to 2002. That meant if a player landed on a wedge that had the number 300 on it, the player would be playing for ‚Ç§300,000. In addition to amounts ranging from ‚Ç¨100 to ‚Ç¨500, the most recent version adopted two rules from the French version by putting a ‚Ç¨0 on the wheel, meaning players keep their turn but earn nothing for a correct letter, and also the \\"Cave\\" feature. The Lose a Turn wedge is known as \\"Passa\\" and the Bankrupt wedge is \\"Perde\\" or \\"Bancarotta\\". The Free Spin This was referred to as a \\"Jolly\\", due to the clown picture being on the token. It had to be earned with a correct letter, and could be turned in if a mistake was made. On 'Pentatlon,\\" it was named Bonus. On the 1987-88 Odeon version, it was known as Rilancia. Originally the word \\"JOLLY\\" was placed as an entire wedge on the wheel, and players could earn multiple free spins, spinning again immediately after earning one. Warm-Up Lap The \\"warm-up lap\\" carried over from Pentatlon, but was dropped after the first few episodes. What it did, however, was allow each player exactly one spin and one guess, regardless of whether or not the letter was in the puzzle, starting with the player whose turn it was to begin the round. After each player got one guess, the game continued in the standard fashion with the player who began the round continuing to control the wheel until he/she made a mistake or landed on \\"Perde\\" (Bankrupt) or \\"Passa\\" (Lose a Turn). Landing on \\"JOLLY\\" during the warm-up lap allowed a player a free spin, but control immediately passed to the next player instead of allowing the player a second spin. Bankrupt Written on the wheel as \\"Perde,\\" short for \\"Perde tutto\\" (lose everything). The wedge was renamed Bancarotta in 2007. Lose a Turn Written on the wheel as \\"Passa,\\" short for \\"Passa mano\\" (lose a turn). 5-Second Timer The show employed a rule that all decisions had to be made within 5 seconds. This was represented by a series of bells and a chime originally; later on it changed to a ticking clock and a gong. Sometimes leniency was allowed in the event that Mike was in the middle of giving instructions, since the clock didn't stop ticking. Toss-up puzzles From 2007 to 2009, each round began with a toss-up puzzle (similar to the French version). The first player to solve the puzzle began the round with ‚Ç¨500, and had to solve the puzzle to keep it but would lose it to a Bankrupt. An additional toss-up puzzle was played to determine order intro to start the show before the first round proper, so solving both puzzles meant the player would start Round 1 with ‚Ç¨1,000. The audience would chant each letter out loud as it was revealed. = Bonus Round = Played exactly the same as the American version. At first, the winner chose which prize to play for. Starting in 1995, players chose from three random envelopes (similar to the \\"WHEEL\\" envelopes in the early 1990s in the US); from 2007 to 2008, they spun a miniature wheel with prizes ranging from ‚Ç¨5,000 to ‚Ç¨200K, or a new car. From 2008 until the end of its run in 2009, the top prize of ‚Ç¨200K was halved to ‚Ç¨100K. The first two runs used the original rules of players choosing five consonants and a vowel, but they wouldn't be told the category until after all letters chosen were revealed if they were in the puzzle; Mike would say the category, after which the 15-second timer immediately started. The 2007-09 run gave the player R, S, T, and E for free, and then they had to pick 3 more consonants and a vowel. Unlike the US version (which only gives 10 seconds), the contestant had 30 seconds to solve the puzzle, and were told the category beforehand.  Parole d'oro (Golden Words)  Airing from 1987-88 on Sunday evenings and ending in 1988 due to low ratings, Parole d'oro (Golden Words) was a knockoff of La Ruota Della Fortuna with notable differences. The main difference in Italy was that the Wheel, rather than using money, had all letters of the alphabet (the Italian alphabet does not use J, K, W, X, or Y, except on loanwords) plus one each of Bankrupt and Wild. Players who landed on a letter could take the letter (for 500,000 lire per appearance) or pass their turn, as a wrong letter cost that player 500,000 lire. Some letters on the Wheel were gold, and hence were worth 1,000,000 lire per appearance. Landing on the Wild space allowed that player to choose a letter. Once a puzzle was solved, all players won what was on their display, with the person who solved receiving an additional 5,000,000 lire. (This has a similarity to the UK \\"Wheel,\\" where all players keep their points they scored when the puzzle gets solved.) In some instances, players were allowed to use a Joker in the event the wheel landed on a letter already called; doing so still earned 500,000 lire per appearance if the letter was in the puzzle, or costing 500,000 if it wasn't. The Bonus Round allowed the player to choose five letters, albeit picked at random from a bag. Solving the puzzle doubled that player's winnings. The players had 60 seconds to solve the puzzle. Notes Rather confusingly, the Showcase Showdown round of the Italian version of The Price Is Right (OK, il Prezzo e Giusto!, or just OK for short, as it's known in Italy) was also called \\"La Ruota Della Fortuna.\\" The round's title was used to emphasize the wheel used in the game. Both Ruota and OK successfully aired on the same network at the same time.

The United States formally recognized North Macedonia on February 8, 1994, and the two countries established full diplomatic relations on September 13, 1995. The U.S. Liaison Office was upgraded to an Embassy in February 1996, and the first U.S. Ambassador to Skopje arrived in July 1996. The development of political relations between the United States and North Macedonia has ushered in a whole host of other contacts between the two states. The United States, together with its European allies, strongly condemned the initiators of the 2001 insurgency in North Macedonia and closely supported the government and major parties' successful efforts to forge a peaceful, political solution to the crisis through the Ohrid Framework Agreement. In partnership with the EU and other international organizations active in North Macedonia, the United States is facilitating the Macedonian Government's implementation of the Framework Agreement and fostering long-term peace and stability in the country. North Macedonia continues to make an important contribution to regional stability by facilitating the logistical supply of NATO (including U.S.) peacekeepers in Kosovo. Today, North Macedonia and the United States enjoy a cooperative relationship across a broad range of political, economic, cultural, military, and social issues. The United States supports North Macedonia's aspirations to build a democratically secure and market-oriented society, and has donated large amounts of foreign assistance for democracy and economic reforms, defense reforms, and projects to strengthen rule of law and improve education. Bilateral assistance budgeted to North Macedonia under the Support Europe Economic Development (SEED) Act totaled over $320 million from 1990 to 2004, including budget support and other assistance to help North Macedonia recover from the 2001 crisis. North Macedonia received approximately $37 million in SEED Act assistance in 2005. George W.

A key focus of U.S. assistance is helping North Macedonia implement the August 2001 Framework Agreement; implementing the decentralization provision is a priority. USAID is targeting capacity building for local government officials, who will have more authority and responsibility devolved from the central government, as well as providing grants to fund small-scale infrastructure projects. A further priority of U.S. assistance is to facilitate North Macedonia‚Äôs transition to a market economy and increase employment and growth levels. USAID has identified and is now assisting the five most competitive sub-sectors of North Macedonia‚Äôs economy. USAID also helps Macedonian enterprises through business resource centers, improved access to credit and equity, trade and investment facilitation, and training. Programs target improvements in the business-enabling environment by helping to bring legislative and regulatory frameworks in line with EU standards and improving the transparency and efficiency of government services through technology. A resident U.S. Department of Treasury advisor is assisting the Ministry of Finance improve strategy, planning and execution, and public expenditure management. Ambassador Zoran Jolevski with George W. Bush at the accreditation ceremony USAID is working to strengthen North Macedonia's non-governmental organization (NGO) and community networks, encourage judicial reform, in particular by modernizing court administration, and build capacity and transparency of the parliament and local governments. USAID has helped strengthen the State Election Commission‚Äôs capacity to administer elections and supported domestic NGO election monitoring of the spring 2005 municipal elections. A U.S. Department of Justice Resident Legal Advisor focuses on strengthening the independence of the judiciary, efficacy of public prosecution, reform of criminal codes, and capacity to fight trafficking in persons and organized crime. Complementing its assistance in North Macedonia‚Äôs political and economic transition, USAID programs improve education and human capacity in North Macedonia through projects on the primary, secondary, and post-secondary levels. Targets include improving teaching techniques, modernizing vocational education, providing computer labs in all schools, and expanding broadband Internet service throughout the country using primary and secondary schools as a platform. Other programs address crosscutting issues, including interethnic cooperation, assistance to the Romani minority, corruption, HIV/AIDS, and trafficking.

The two countries concluded a commercial convention in 1867 and a treaty of peace, friendship, and commerce in 1881. At the time, Madagascar was largely controlled by the Merina Kingdom, based in the country's central highlands. IN 1886, the U.S. sent its first Commercial Agent to Madagascar (John P. Finkelmeier), and in 1875 its first Consul (William W. Robinson). Both were based in the port of Tamatave (now Toamasina). In the years between the First Franco-Hova War and the annexation of Madagascar by France, a series of U.S. Consuls in the country supported the rights of the Merina government against French colonial claims, notably by receiving exequatur from the Merina rather than the French, as the French insisted they should. This culminated in the 1895 arrest of former U.S. Consul John Louis Waller, who had been granted a large tract of land by the Merina government (who refused to make such grants to the French). Waller was taken to metropolitan France and sentenced to 20 years in prison for allegedly conspiring with Merina radicals. The incident was only resolved when U.S. President Grover Cleveland secured his release by threatening to sever diplomatic ties between the U.S. and France. Additionally, in 1882-1883 a Malagasy diplomatic delegation visited the U.S. in order to gain support against French designs on the island. They visited Washington D.C., Philadelphia, New York City, Boston, and Salem, addressing not only government officials but merchants who had substantial trade interests in Madagascar. After France officially annexed Madagascar in 1896, French treaties with the U.S. superseded all previous treaties that the U.S. had signed with the Merina Kingdom. In 1916, the U.S. relocated its consulate from the port of Tamatave to the highland capital Tananarive (Antananarivo). The Malagasy Republic became independent from France on June 26, 1960, and the U.S. Consulate in Madagascar was upgraded to an Embassy on the same day. The first Ambassador to Madagascar was accredited on October 5, 1960 (Frederic Pearson Bartlett). On December 5, 1960, the Malagasy Embassy to the U.S. opened in Washington D.C., and the first Malagasy Ambassador to the U.S. was accredited (Louis Rakotomalala). All U.S. treaties with France would remain in effect with Madagascar unless otherwise indicated. In 1964 the U.S. constructed a NASA satellite tracking station in northwestern Madagascar (Majunga), which would later be moved to Antananarivo. Also in that year, Malagasy President Philibert Tsiranana visited the U.S. on a two week tour, and received an official state welcome on the White House South Lawn. Traditionally warm relations suffered considerably following the 1972 and 1975 coups, when Madagascar expelled the U.S. ambassador, closed the NASA tracking station, pursued closer relationships with the USSR, Cuba, and North Korea, and nationalized two U.S. oil companies. In 1980, relations at the ambassadorial level were restored. U.S. economic aid to Madagascar increased dramatically in the 1980s and 90s. In 1984 USAID opened a field office in Madagascar. In 1990, Madagascar was designated as a priority aid recipient, and assistance increased from $15 million in 1989 to $40 million in 1993. Recent U.S. assistance has contributed to a population census and family planning programs; conservation of Madagascar's remarkable biodiversity, private sector development, agriculture, democracy and governance initiatives; and media training. A Peace Corps program was established on the island in 1992. Madagascar qualified for AGOA trade benefits in 2000. Madagascar became the first country with a Millennium Challenge Account compact when it signed an agreement worth $110 million in April 2005. The Ravalomanana government was especially positive about ties with the United States. The fall of President Ravalomanana in 2009 and the subsequent Transition regime strained those relations. Madagascar could not benefit from much US or international aid any more, nor qualify for free trade agreements such as AGOA. In 2013, a new president and a new national assembly were elected with the support of the international community. International aid resumed, and Madagascar again benefited from AGOA; in theory, for its main export industry garments, had suffered very much. However, in June 2015, a new degradation of the political climate in Antananarivo prompted the U.S. State Department to voice its concern and call for a 'national dialogue' in the country. In 2020 the Peace Corps suspended operations in Madagascar due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Embassy U.S. Officials include: * Ambassador‚Äî Michael P.

Malaya was the predecessor state to Malaysia, a larger federation which was formed through the merger of Malaya, North Borneo, Sarawak and Singapore in 1963. Immediately before the merger, the latter three territories were previously part of the British Empire. But the US had consular and commercial presence in Malaya since the 1800s. US merchants, especially Joseph William Torrey together with Thomas Bradley Harris also had commercial interests in north western coast of Borneo in the 19th century as well, where they established the American Trading Company of Borneo. Malaysia has its embassy in Washington, D.C., and consulate-general offices in Los Angeles and New York City. The United States maintains its embassy in Kuala Lumpur. Beginning from 2014, the US considered Malaysia as a Comprehensive Partner which increased the importance of the diplomatic ties as part of President Barack Obama's Pivot to Asia policy. The partnership increased bilateral consultations and co- operation on politics, diplomacy, trade, investment, education, people-to- people ties, security, the environment, science, technology and energy, which continue to be enhanced by President Donald Trump in 2017. In 2016, the US is Malaysia's third largest export market in terms of value, while Malaysia is the US's 25th largest export destination and among the largest trading partners for the latter.  History  Thomas Bradley Harris (standing left) and Joseph William Torrey (sitting right), both are the first US merchants to establishing presence in present-day Malaysian Borneo. The United States has a long commercial interest in Malaysia, dating back since the 1800s when the territories now part of the Southeast Asian country were still under British colonial rule. While Malaysia through Malaya only established a diplomatic presence in the US beginning from 1957, the US had consular posts in Malaya and commercial interests in northern Borneo since the 1800s. In 1850, the US recognised the status of Kingdom of Sarawak which was established by an Englishman named James Brooke as an independent state. US merchants Torrey and Harris through the American Trading Company of Borneo had a tract of land in north western of Borneo, which was however sold to Baron von Overbeck in 1876. The US further appointed a consul in George Town in 1918 and established additional consular posts in Kuala Lumpur in 1948 and Kuching in 1968. The modern ties between Malaysia and the US are generally warm with the US had supported Malaysia during the Indonesia‚ÄìMalaysia confrontation, an armed conflict arising from Indonesian opposition to the formation of Malaysia, marking the beginning of US direct involvement in the political affairs of Malaysia. Earlier during the World War II, the US played a role in the liberation of Southeast Asia from Japanese occupation especially in the liberation of Borneo as the island is located close to the Commonwealth of the Philippines, which is a protectorate of the latter. Political relations, however became strained, under the Bush administration during the Iraq War. Mahathir Mohamad who ruled from 1981 until 2003 was critical of the foreign policy of the United States at the time, especially the foreign policy of the George W. Bush administration's invasion of Iraq during the Iraq War. Nevertheless, these periods of tensions between the two nations did not prevent the US from being one of the largest trading partners for Malaysia during Mahathir's tenure. The US was, and still is one of the largest trading partners for Malaysia and is traditionally considered to be Malaysia's closest ally. In 2002, Malaysia-US Friendship Council was established to strengthen the friendship between the Malaysian government and the US government. Mohd Noor Amin, Chairman of the International Multilateral Partnership Against Cyber Threats (IMPACT), was appointed as the Secretary-General for this council. The council is headquartered in Washington, D.C. and sponsored by leading Malaysian companies to offer advice on matters relating to bilateral relationship between the two countries. Under the helm of Prime Minister Najib Razak's administration, the two-way diplomatic ties between the two sovereign nations have since warmed and became normalized once more. Subsequently, US President Barack Obama's made his first official visit to Malaysia in April 2014, the first visit by a sitting US President since 1966. Prime Minister Najib and President Obama issued a joint statement that, among other things, elevated the Malaysia-US relationship to a comprehensive partnership. Malaysia is currently pursuing the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) treaty with the support of the US until January 2017. Both countries continue to enjoy warm relations with the two leaders became close personal friends. On Christmas Eve in 2014, both Najib and Obama are seen playing golf together in Hawaii. Following the victory of Donald Trump in the 2016 US presidential election, the relations continue to be strengthened with Najib was among the international leaders that congratulated Trump and looked forward to continuing a partnership with the US under his presidency. In June 2018, the United States Embassy in Kuala Lumpur hosting a series of programs in Sabah (the former North Borneo) to celebrate the 150+ years of partnership with the people of the territory.  Economic trade and relations  The earliest significant economic relations between the territories now part of Malaysia, in particular Malaya, was the US involvement in the production and trade of tin and rubber. Malaya at one time was the largest single producer of both commodities and the US was the largest importer of Malayan tin. By 1917, rubber became Malaya's most important exports and the US absorbed 77% of Malaya's total rubber production. The great demand for rubber was due to the rising production of automobile in Malaysia. In the modern days, the US is one of the largest foreign investor in Malaysia. The American Malaysian Chamber of Commerce serves as a business association for collaboration between both countries. While figures capturing the full range of foreign investment (including oil and gas) are not available, American companies are particularly active in the energy, electronics, and manufacturing sectors and employ nearly 200,000 Malaysian workers. The cumulative value of US private investment in the manufacturing sector in Malaysia is roughly $15 billion. In the 1970s, American companies, including Agilent AMD, Fairchild Semiconductor, Freescale Semiconductor, Intel, Texas Instruments and Western Digital pioneered the Malaysian electrical and electronics (E&E;) sector, which exports billions of dollars of equipment to global supply chains every year. Major US oil and gas companies, including ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, Hess and Murphy Oil, have invested billions of dollars to develop Malaysia's energy resources. Many US- based fast-food/coffeehouse chains such as A&W; Restaurants, Burger King, Domino's Pizza, Dunkin' Donuts, KFC, McDonald's, Pizza Hut, Starbucks, Subway, Texas Chicken and Wendy's had already dominating the Malaysian fast food/coffeehouse markets. Recent US investors include Hershey, Kellogg's, Bose and Golden Gate Capital. The US is Malaysia's fourth largest trading partner and Malaysia is the 22nd largest trading partner of the US Annual two-way trade in goods and services in 2013 amounted to approximately $44 billion. Malaysia and the US launched negotiations for a bilateral free trade agreement in June 2005 but did not conclude an agreement after eight rounds of talks. Malaysian investment in the US is small but growing, particularly in leisure, gaming and biotechnology. Significant Malaysian companies operating in the US include Genting's Resort World Casino and MOL Global, a New York Stock Exchange listed company. In 2010, Malaysia joined the US, Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam in negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) (Japan subsequently joined the negotiations in 2013). This agreement seeks to expand market access, strengthen intellectual property protections, and support high labour and environmental standards while fostering greater economic integration among participants. The US however has since left the TPP in 2017.  Education relations  The Fulbright English Teaching Assistant program helping improve the English language skills of thousands of Malaysian secondary school students and there is around 6,000 alumni of United States Department of State-sponsored exchange programs in Malaysia. In 2014, President Obama announced additional exchange programs, grant opportunities and fellowships for youth ages 18‚Äì35 under the Young Southeast Asian Young Leaders Initiative (YSEALI). Since 2001, the Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation (AFCP) has supported 10 projects to support the preservation of cultural heritage in Malaysia.

Malaysia and the US enjoy strong security co-operation, with both have maintained steady defence co-operation since the 1990s. While Malaysia's security are secured by the Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA) with Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and the United Kingdom, the US also has military alliance with both Australia and New Zealand under the Australia, New Zealand, United States Security Treaty (ANZUS) and has established direct military and political co-operation with Singapore and Malaysia, whose armed forces were growing increasingly dependent on American arms shipments, with the M4 carbine and M16 rifle became the major assault rifles for both armed forces.

Earlier on 1 July 2003, Malaysia established a Southeast Asia Regional Centre for Counter-Terrorism (SEARCCT), where the two collaborating in combating terrorist financing. Both Malaysia and the US share a strong military-to-military relationship with numerous exchanges, training, joint exercises, and visits such as the annual participation of both countries in the Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training (Exercise CARAT) and co- operation in International Military Education and Training (IMET). The US is also among the foreign countries that has collaborated with the centre in conducting capacity building programmes. Malaysia's Peacekeeping Centre provides pre-deployment training to Malaysian and other peacekeepers before deployment on United Nations (UN) missions. Through the Global Peace Operations Initiative, the US provided support for the Malaysian Peacekeeping Centre.

Prime Minister Najib Razak and President Barack Obama met just before the Nuclear Security Summit in Washington on 12 April 2010. This meeting was thought by many to represent a significant improvement in Malaysia‚ÄìUnited States relations. This was their first one-on-one meeting. During their talk, Obama sought further assistance from Malaysia in stemming nuclear proliferation which Obama described as the greatest threat to world security. In June 2009 Najib and Obama discussed via telephone the global financial crisis, nuclear non-proliferation issues and two Malaysians detained at Guantanamo Bay detention camp. During the summit Najib stressed that Malaysia only supported nuclear programmes designed for peaceful purposes. Najib's attendance at the summit was part of a week-long official visit to the US. On 21 October 2013, Secretary of State John Kerry and Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker visited Kuala Lumpur to participate in the Global Entrepreneurship Summit. Secretary Kerry visited Malaysia again from 4 to 6 August 2015 to attend the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF). On 26 April 2014, President Obama made a state visit to Malaysia. He is the second US President to visit Malaysia since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1966. The following are senior US diplomats and politicians who have visited Malaysia: * US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice visited Kuala Lumpur in July 2006. * US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made a 3-day bilateral visit to Kuala Lumpur in November 2010. * US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates visited Malaysia in November 2010. * US Attorney General Eric Holder visited Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in July 2012. * US Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel visited Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in August 2013. * US Secretary of the Treasury Jacob Lew visited Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in November 2013. * US Trade Representative Michael Froman visited Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia on four occasions, most recently in 2015. * US Congress bipartisan delegation led by Paul Ryan, Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee visited Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in February 2015. * US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in August 2018.  Public opinion  According to global opinion polls, only 27% of Malaysians viewed the US favourably in 2007, likely due to disapproval of US foreign policy against fellow Islamic nations. However, as of 2013, 55% of Malaysians view the US favourably, declining somewhat down to 51% in 2014. According to the same poll conducted in 2015, 54% of Malaysians had confidence that President Obama would do the right thing in international affairs. According to the 2012 US Global Leadership Report, 34% of Malaysians approved of US leadership, with 31% disapproving and 35% uncertain.  Diplomatic missions  American embassy in Kuala Lumpur.

History  The United States has friendly relations with the Republic of Maldives since the nation's independence from the United Kingdom in 1966. The U.S. Ambassador and some Embassy staff in Sri Lanka are accredited to the Maldives and make periodic visits. The United States supports Maldivian independence and territorial integrity, and publicly endorsed India's timely intervention on behalf of the Maldivian Government during the November 1988 coup attempt. U.S. Naval vessels have regularly called at Mal√© in recent years. The Maldives extended strong support to U.S. efforts to combat terrorism and terrorist financing in 2001-2002. Former Ambassador Robert O. Blake, Jr. in November 2007 U.S. contributions to economic development in the Maldives have been made principally through international organization programs. Following the December 2004 tsunami, the U.S. and Maldives signed a bilateral assistance agreement for $8.6 million in reconstruction assistance. This assistance will help in the rebuilding of harbors, sewage systems, and electrical generation facilities and in the development of aid absorption capacity in the Ministry of Finance. The United States has directly funded training in airport management and narcotics interdiction and provided desktop computers for Maldivian customs, immigration, and drug-control efforts in recent years. The United States also trains a small number of Maldivian military personnel annually. About 10 U.S. citizens are resident in the Maldives; some 5,000 Americans visit the Maldives annually. Alaina B. Teplitz is the current U.S. Ambassador to the Maldives. The relevant U.S. Embassy is in Colombo, Sri Lanka.  Defense  The United States and Maldives have been deepening their military and political ties since the election of Ibrahim Mohamed Solih as President of the Maldives. In September 2020 the United States and Maldives signed a defense agreement with each other in Philadelphia. The agreement had been in the works since 2013, but had previously been blocked by the Indian government's opposition to the agreement. Indian officials have since welcomed the agreement saying that Maldives is part of the Indo-Pacific. The United States is one of several countries that provides military aid to broaden the capacity of the Maldivian Armed Forces.  Aid  The United States donated 60 ventilators to Maldives during the COVID-19 pandemic. The United States also gave a grant of $2 million for economic support during the pandemic and $150,000 worth of personal protective equipment.

According to the 2012 U.S. Global Leadership Report, 21% of Maltese people approve of U.S. leadership, with 15% disapproving and 64% uncertain.U.S. Global Leadership Project Report - 2012 Gallup  History  = Early Hospitaller‚ÄìUnited States relations = At the time of the American Revolutionary War which established the United States, Malta was a de facto independent vassal state ruled by the Order of St. John. During the war, the French Navy included 1,800 Maltese and knights of the Order, who played a role during the decisive Battle of the Chesapeake in 1781. Two years later, the United States Ambassador to France Benjamin Franklin presented a Libertas Americana medal to Grand Master Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc, thanking him for supporting the American cause. Franklin also asked de Rohan to allow American ships in Maltese ports, and the latter granted this request. The first United States Consul to Malta was appointed in 1796. John Pass (Pace), who recast the Liberty Bell in 1753, was of Maltese origin. = British Malta = During the First Barbary War of 1801‚Äì05, American ships were allowed to take in water and provisions from Maltese ports. According to Diane Andreassi:Andreassi, 2014 :During the first decade of the nineteenth century American ships brought a variety of goods to Malta, including flour, rice, pepper, salted meat, rum, tobacco, and mahogany wood from Boston and Baltimore, as well as dried fruits, cotton, wax, pearls, goat hides, coffee, potatoes, drugs, and sponges from Smyrne and the Greek archipelago. Trade would rise and fall cyclically. Malta's biggest boon of American shipping was during the Crimean War, between 1854 and 1856, when Great Britain and France were fighting Russia. Malta also emerged as a stepping stone in the wool trade between Barbary and the United States because it received wool from different ports in North Africa for shipment to the United States. Later, American tobacco was shipped to Barbary and Sicily through Malta....Malta also imported petroleum, rum, pepper, flour, log-wood, pitch, resin, turpentine, coffee, sugar, cloves, codfish, wheat, cheese, butter, and lard. Meanwhile, the island nation exported to the United States goods such as olive oil, lemons, sulfur, ivory, salt, rags, goat skins, stoneware, soap, sponges, and donkeys. SS Ohio arriving in Malta, 15 August 1942 During World War II, some American ships took part in Operation Pedestal, a British convoy meant to supply Malta with critical supplies in August 1942. Most notably, the American tanker SS Ohio supplied crucial fuel and food to the islands. Later on in 1942, the aircraft carrier USS Wasp twice delivered Spitfires to Malta. General Dwight D. Eisenhower and Italian Prime Minister Pietro Badoglio signed an armistice in September 1943 on board HMS Nelson while anchored in Malta's Grand Harbour. Later on in 1943, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt visited Malta described the island as \\"one tiny bright flame in the darkness ‚Äì a beacon of hope for the clearer days which have come.\\" Maltese Prime Minister George Borg Olivier met the US President John F. Kennedy at the White House on 19 September 1963, a year before Malta's independence. = Since Maltese independence = Maltese Prime Minister Lawrence Gonzi with U.S. President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama, September 2009 Malta and the United States established full diplomatic relations upon Malta's independence in 1964; overall relations are positive. The United States has been sympathetic to Malta's campaign to attract private investment, and some firms operating in Malta have U.S. ownership or investment. These include major hotels, manufacturing and repair facilities, and some offices servicing local and regional operations. The Maltese Prime Minister Eddie Fenech Adami met U.S. President Ronald Reagan at the White House in July 1988. On 2‚Äì3 December 1989, U.S. President George H. W. Bush met Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev at the Malta Summit in Marsaxlokk Bay, where they officially declared an end to the Cold War. In 2005, the Maltese Prime Minister Lawrence Gonzi met U.S. President George W. Bush at the White House. Malta acted as an evacuation point for US and other citizens during the Libyan Civil War in 2011. That year, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton briefly visited Malta while returning from Libya. Prime Minister Joseph Muscat met President Barack Obama a number of times. On 10 August 2019, the governments of both Malta and the United States issued a joint statement emphasizing the countries' \\"friendship and close collaboration\\".

History  Marshall Islands President Hilda Heine meets with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in 2019 During World War II, the United States took control of the islands from Japan (which governed them as part of the South Pacific Mandate) in the 1944 Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign. The US military conducted nuclear testing on Bikini Atoll in 1946 through 1958. In 1965, the US government formed the Congress of Micronesia, a plan for increased self-governance of Pacific islands. The Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands in 1979 provided independence to the Marshall Islands, whose constitution and president were formally recognized by the US. The Republic of the Marshall Islands is now a sovereign state in free association with the United States. After more than a decade of negotiation, the Marshall Islands and the United States signed a Compact of Free Association on June 25, 1983. The people of the Marshall Islands approved the Compact in a UN-observed plebiscite on September 7, 1983. The U.S. Congress subsequently approved the Compact, adding several amendments which were accepted by the Government of the Marshall Islands, and the Compact was entered into force on October 21, 1986. From 1999-2003, the two nations negotiated an Amended Compact that entered into force on May 1, 2004. Under the Amended Compact, the U.S. will provide the Marshall Islands at least $57 million every year until 2023, including contributions to a jointly managed Trust Fund. Marshallese will continue to have access to many U.S. programs and services. A Joint Economic Management and Financial Accountability Committee (JEMFAC) composed of representatives of both governments will ensure that Compact assistance funds are spent effectively. Under the Compact, the United States has full authority and responsibility for security and defense of the Marshall Islands, and the Government of the Marshall Islands is obligated to refrain from taking actions that would be incompatible with these security and defense responsibilities. The Department of Defense, under a subsidiary government-to-government agreement of the original Compact, has use of the lagoon and several islands on Kwajalein Atoll. The atoll consists of approximately 90 islets around the largest lagoon in the world. The original agreement allowed the United States continued use of the U.S. Army Garrison Kwajalein Atoll (USAG-KA), home to the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site, until 2016. An amendment to that agreement, extending U.S. rights until 2066 with an option until 2086, was negotiated in conjunction with the Amended Compact. Another major subsidiary agreement of the original Compact provides for settlement of all claims arising from the U.S. nuclear tests conducted at Bikini and Enewetak Atolls from 1946 to 1958. Under the terms of free association, more than 40 U.S. Government agencies such as the Federal Aviation Administration, U.S. Postal Service, the Small Business Administration, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency operate programs or render assistance to the Marshall Islands. In the United Nations, the Marshall Islands shows overwhelming support for the United States. On 13 key issues in 2008, the Marshall Islands matched the vote of the United States 100% of the time.\\"Iran‚Äôs Security Council Bid Nears a Vote\\" , CNS News, October 14, 2008 In 2015, however, the Marshall Islands voted to condemn the US embargo over Cuba.

The ship had been charted by Germany's Rickmers ship management, who stated that the ship contained no special cargo including military weapons. The ship was reported to be under the control of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard according to the Pentagon amid escalating tensions in the region due to the intensifying of Saudi-led coalition attacks in Yemen. The Pentagon reported that the destroyer USS Farragut and a maritime reconnaissance aircraft were dispatched upon receiving a distress call from the ship Tigris and was also reported that all 34 crew members were detained. US defense officials have said that they would review their defense obligations to the Government of Marshall Islands in wake of the recent events and also condemned the shots fired at the bridge as \\"inappropriate\\". It was reported in May that Tehran would release the ship after a paid penalty. Wake Island dispute The United States and the Marshall Islands governments both claim Wake Island, which puts the United States armed forces in the ambiguous position of defending US territory while acting as guarantor (under the Compact of Free Association) of the territorial integrity of a state with which it is involved in a territorial dispute.

Overview Embassy of Mauritania in Washington, D.C. After Mauritania gained independence on 28 November 1960, the United States maintained cordial relations with Mauritania and provided a small amount of economic assistance. During the Six-Day War in June 1967, Mauritania broke diplomatic and consular relations with the United States but restored ties two years later and maintained relatively positive relations until the late 1980s, despite disagreement over the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict. Since 1981, the United States has provided about $130 million in economic and food assistance. The 1989 rupture between Mauritania and Senegal (the \\"1989 Events\\") that resulted in Mauritania's deportation of tens of thousands of its own citizens to Senegal, negatively affected U.S.-Mauritanian relations. Moreover, Mauritania's perceived support of Iraq prior to and during the 1991 Gulf War further weakened the strained ties. Relations between the U.S. and Mauritania reached a low in the spring of 1991, as details of the Mauritanian military's role in widespread human rights abuses surfaced. The U.S. responded by formally halting USAID operations and all military assistance to Mauritania. Relations also suffered in the 1990s as a result of repeated reports that slavery continued in some parts of Mauritania despite legal proscriptions. By the late 1990s, the Mauritanian government adopted policies facilitating the return of those expelled or who fled during the 1989 Events; turned away from Iraq and toward the West; and initiated a poverty reduction strategy while securing debt relief under the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative. Improved relations with the United States, including the return of military cooperation and training programs, accompanied these changes. Mauritania formally opened diplomatic relations with Israel in 2000 and remains one of only three Arab League member-nations to have done so. The U.S. condemned the August 2005 coup and the unconstitutional assumption of power by the Military Council for Justice and Democracy, and called for a return to a constitutional government through free and fair elections as soon as possible. The U.S. Government supports Mauritania's transition to democracy, and supported the 2006 parliamentary election and 2007 presidential election. The United States provided election-related assistance for voter education, political party training, and democracy building. The U.S. now aims to work with the Mauritanian Government to expand bilateral cooperation in the areas of food security, health, education, security, strengthening democratic institutions, and counterterrorism.

Despite a major revolt by the Arabs, the Ottoman sultan ceded Libya to the Italians by signing the 1912 Treaty of Lausanne. The Italians made extensive use of the Savari, colonial cavalry troops raised in December 1912. These units were recruited from the Arab-Berber population of Libya following the initial Italian occupation in 1911‚Äì12. The Savari, like the Spahi or mounted Libyan police, formed part of the Regio Corpo Truppe Coloniali della Libia (Royal Corps of Libyan Colonial Troops).

When the Order's leader, Ahmed Sharif as-Senussi, abdicated his position, he was replaced by Idris, who was his cousin. Pressured to do so by the Ottoman Empire, Ahmed had pursued armed attacks against British military forces stationed in neighbouring Egypt. On taking power, Idris put a stop to these attacks. Instead he established a tacit alliance with the British, which would last for half a century and accord his Order de facto diplomatic status. Using the British as intermediaries, Idris led the Order into negotiations with the Italians in July 1916. These resulted in two agreements, at al- Zuwaytina in April 1916 and at Akrama in April 1917. The latter of these treaties left most of inland Cyrenaica under the control of the Senussi Order. Relations between the Senussi Order and the newly established Tripolitanian Republic were acrimonious. The Senussi attempted to militarily extend their power into eastern Tripolitania, resulting in a pitched battle at Bani Walid in which the Senussi were forced to withdraw back into Cyrenaica. The Royal Palace of Tripoli, designed by Italian colonial architect Meraviglia- Mantegazza in 1924. Roman theatre of Sabratha, restored during the Italian rule At the end of World War I, the Ottoman Empire signed an armistice agreement in which they ceded their claims over Libya to Italy. Italy however was facing serious economic, social, and political problems domestically, and was not prepared to re-launch its military activities in Libya. It issued statutes known as the Legge Fondamentale with both the Tripolitanian Republic in June 1919 and Cyrenaica in October 1919. These brought about a compromise by which all Libyans were accorded the right to a joint Libyan-Italian citizenship while each province was to have its own parliament and governing council. The Senussi were largely happy with this arrangement and Idris visited Rome as part of the celebrations to mark the promulgation of the settlement. In October 1920, further negotiations between Italy and Cyrenaica resulted in the Accord of al-Rajma, in which Idris was given the title of the Emir of Cyrenaica and permitted to autonomously administer the oases around Kufra, Jalu, Jaghbub, Awjila, and Ajdabiya. As part of the Accord he was given a monthly stipend by the Italian government, who agreed to take responsibility for policing and administration of areas under Senussi control. The Accord also stipulated that Idris must fulfill the requirements of the Legge Fondamentale by disbanding the Cyrenaican military units, however he did not comply with this. By the end of 1921, relations between the Senussi Order and the Italian government had again deteriorated. Following the death of Tripolitanian leader Ramadan Asswehly in August 1920, the Republic descended into civil war. Many tribal leaders in the region recognised that this discord was weakening the region's chances of attaining full autonomy from Italy, and in November 1920 they met in Gharyan to bring an end to the violence. In January 1922 they agreed to request that Idris extend the Sanui Emirate of Cyrenaica into Tripolitania in order to bring stability; they presented a formal document with this request on 28 July 1922. Idris' advisers were divided on whether he should accept the offer or not. Doing so would contravene the al-Rajma Agreement and would damage relations with the Italian government, who opposed the political unification of Cyrenaica and Tripolitania as being against their interests. Nevertheless, in November 1922 Idris agreed to the proposal. Following the agreement, Idris feared that Italy ‚Äî under its new Fascist leader Benito Mussolini‚Äîwould militarily retaliate against the Senussi Order, and so he went into exile in Egypt in December 1922. Postcard of Tripoli in 1934 Fighting intensified after the accession to power in Italy of the dictator Benito Mussolini. Due to the effective resistance of the Libyan people against Italy's so-called \\"pacification campaign\\", Italian colonization of the Ottoman provinces of Tripolitania and Cyrenaica was not initially successful and it was not until the early 1930s that the Kingdom of Italy took full control of the area.Chapin Metz, Hellen. Libya: A Country Study. First Chapter Several reorganizations of the colonial authority had been made necessary because of armed Arab opposition, mainly in Cyrenaica. Between 1919 (17 May) to 1929 (24 January), the Italian government maintained the two traditional provinces, with separate colonial administrations. A system of controlled local assemblies with limited local authority was set up, but was revoked on 9 March 1927. In 1929, Tripoli and Cyrenaica were united as one colonial province. From 1931 to 1932, Italian forces under General Badoglio waged a punitive pacification campaign. Badoglio's successor in the field, General Rodolfo Graziani, accepted the commission from Mussolini on the condition that he was allowed to crush Libyan resistance unencumbered by the restraints of either Italian or international law. Mussolini reportedly agreed immediately and Graziani intensified the oppression. Some Libyans continued to defend themselves, with the strongest voices of dissent coming from the Cyrenaica. Beginning in the first days of Italian colonization, Omar Mukhtar, a Senussi sheikh, organized and, for nearly twenty years, led Libyan resistance efforts. His example continued to inspire resistance even after his capture and execution on 16 September 1931. His face is currently printed on the Libyan ten dinar note in memory and recognition of his patriotism. By 1934, Libyan indigenous resistance was effectively crushed. The new Italian governor Italo Balbo created the political entity called Italian Libya in the summer of that year.Helen Chapin Metz wrote in her book Libya: A Country Study: Once pacification had been accomplished, fascist Italy endeavoured to convert Libya into an Italian province to be referred to popularly as Italy's Fourth Shore. In 1934 Tripolitania and Cyrenaica were divided into four provinces‚ÄîTripoli, Misrata, Benghazi, and Darnah‚Äîwhich were formally linked as a single colony known as Libya, thus officially resurrecting the name that Diocletian had applied nearly 1,500 years earlier. Fezzan, designated as South Tripolitania, remained a military territory. A governor general, called the first consul after 1937, was in overall direction of the colony, assisted by the General Consultative Council, on which Arabs were represented. Traditional tribal councils, formerly sanctioned by the Italian administration, were abolished, and all local officials were thereafter appointed by the governor general. Administrative posts at all levels were held by Italians.An accord with Britain and Egypt obtained the transfer of a corner of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, known as the Sarra Triangle, to Italian control in 1934. The next year, a French-Italian agreement was negotiated that relocated the 1,000-kilometer border between Libya and Chad southward about 100 kilometers across the Aouzou Strip, but this territorial concession to Italy was never ratified by the French legislature. In 1939 Libya was incorporated into metropolitan Italy. During the 1930s, impressive strides were made in improving the country's economic and transportation infrastructure. Italy invested capital and technology in public works projects, extension and modernization of cities, highway and railroad construction, expanded port facilities, and irrigation, but these measures were introduced to benefit the Italian-controlled modern sector of the economy. Italian development policy after World War I had called for capital-intensive \\"economic colonization\\" intended to promote the maximum exploitation of the resources available. One of the initial Italian objectives in Libya, however, had been the relief of overpopulation and unemployment in Italy through emigration to the undeveloped colony. With security established, systematic \\"demographic colonization\\" was encouraged by Mussolini's government. A project initiated by Libya's governor, Italo Balbo, brought the first 20,000 settlers--the ventimilli--to Libya in a single convoy in October 1938. More settlers followed in 1939, and by 1940 there were approximately 110,000 Italians in Libya, constituting about 12 percent of the total population. Plans envisioned an Italian colony of 500,000 settlers by the 1960s. Libya's best land was allocated to the settlers to be brought under productive cultivation, primarily in olive groves. Settlement was directed by a state corporation, the Libyan Colonization Society, which undertook land reclamation and the building of model villages and offered a grubstake and credit facilities to the settlers it had sponsored. The Italians made modern medical care available for the first time in Libya, improved sanitary conditions in the towns, and undertook to replenish the herds and flocks that had been depleted during the war. But, although Mussolini liked to refer to the Libyans as \\"Muslim Italians,\\" little more was accomplished that directly improved the living standards of the Arab population. The classical name \\"Libya\\" was revived as the official name of the unified colony. Then in 1937 the colony was split administratively into four provinces: Tripoli, Misrata, Benghazi, and Derna. The Fezzan area was called Territorio Sahara Libico and administered militarily. =Unification with Cyrenaica= Italian Tripolitania and Italian Cyrenaica were formed in 1911, during the conquest of Ottoman Tripolitania in the Italo-Turkish War. In 1934, Italian Tripolitania became part of Italian Libya. In December 1934, certain rights were guaranteed to autochthonous Libyans (later called by Benito Mussolini \\"Moslem Italians\\"Sarti. The Ax within p 190) including individual freedom, inviolability of home and property, the right to join the military or civil administrations, and the right to freely pursue a career or employment. In 1937, northern Tripolitania was split into Tripoli Province and Misrata Province. In 1939 Tripolitania was included in the 4th Shore of the Kingdom of Italy. In early 1943 the region was invaded and occupied by the Allies; this was the end of the Italian colonial presence. Italy tried unsuccessfully to maintain the colony of Tripolitania after World War II, but in February 1947 relinquished all Italian colonies in a Peace Treaty. Colonial administration =Provinces= The Province of Tripoli (the most important in all Italian Libya) was subdivided into: *Tripoli *Zawiya *Sugh el Giumaa *Nalut *Gharyan =Demography= alt= A large number of Italian colonists moved to Tripolitania in the late 1930s. These settlers went primarily to the area of Sahel al-Jefara, in Tripolitania, and to the capital Tripoli. In 1939 there were in all Tripolitania nearly 60,000 Italians, most living in Tripoli (whose population was nearly 45% Italian).Images of old Tripoli As a consequence, huge economic improvements arose in all coastal Tripolitania. For example, Italians created the Tripoli Grand Prix, an internationally renowned automobile race.Video of Tripoli Grand Prix Certain rights were guaranteed to autochthonous Libyans (later called by Benito Mussolini \\"Moslem Italians\\"Sarti. The Ax within p 190) including individual freedom, inviolability of home and property, the right to join the military or civil administrations, and the right to freely pursue a career or employment. Infrastructure Battisti Village, present-day Qirnada. In Italian Tripolitania, the Italians made significant improvements to the physical infrastructure: The most important were the coastal road between Tripoli and Benghazi and the railways Tripoli-Zuara, Tripoli-Garian and Tripoli-Tagiura. Other important infrastructure improvements were the enlargement of the port of Tripoli and the creation of the Tripoli airport. A group of villages for Italians and Libyans was created on coastal Tripolitania during the 1930s. Chapter Libya-Tripolitania (in Italian) Archaeology and tourism The Tripoli Grand Prix Classical archaeology was used by the Italian authorities as a propaganda tool to justify their presence in the region. Before 1911, no archeological research was done in Tripolitania and Cyrenaica. By the late 1920s the Italian government had started funding excavations in the main Roman cities of Leptis Magna and Sabratha (Cyrenaica was left for later excavations because of the ongoing colonial war against Muslim rebels in that province). A result of the fascist takeover was that all foreign archaeological expeditions were forced out of Libya, and all archeological work was consolidated under a centralised Italian excavation policy, which exclusively benefitted Italian museums and journals.Dyson, S.L (2006). In pursuit of ancient pasts: a history of classical archaeology in the 19th and 20h centuries. pp. 182‚Äì183. After Cyrenaica's full pacification, the Italian archaeological efforts in the 1930s were more focused on the former Greek colony of Cyrenaica than in Tripolitania, which was a Punic colony during the Greek period. The rejection of Phoenician research was partly because of anti-Semitic reasons (the Phoenicians were a Semitic people, distantly related to the Arabs and Jews). Of special interest were the Roman colonies of Leptis Magna and Sabratha, and the preparation of these sites for archaeological tourism. Tourism was further promoted by the creation of the Tripoli Grand Prix, a racing car event of international importance.

The first US consular agent was Emile de Loth, accredited in February 1874, but this post was closed and moved to Nice in 1906. A US consulate was briefly set up in Monaco in November 1942 by Walter Orebaugh at the behest of his superior Pinkney Tuck. It was located in two rooms of the Hotel Metropole.

However, some immigrants came from Mongolia to the United States as early as 1949, spurred by religious persecution in their homeland. The U.S. government recognized Mongolia in January 1987 and established its first embassy in that country's capital Ulan Bator in June 1988. The U.S. embassy formally opened in September 1988.

The United States has sought to assist Mongolia's movement toward democracy and market-oriented reform and to expand relations with Mongolia primarily in the cultural and economic fields. In 1989 and 1990, a cultural accord, Peace Corps accord, consular convention, and Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) agreement were signed. A trade agreement was signed in January 1991 and a bilateral investment treaty in 1994. Mongolia was granted permanent normal trade relations (NTR) status and Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) eligibility in June 1999. In July 2004, the U.S. signed a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement with Mongolia to promote economic reform and more foreign investment. In July 2007, six members of the U.S. House of Representatives visited Mongolia to inaugurate an exchange program between lawmakers of the two countries. The return visit came in August 2007, with five members of the Mongolian Parliament traveling to the U.S. In September 2007, the White House announced the proposed creation of an Asia-Pacific Democracy Partnership, in which Mongolia was invited to take part. The initiative is aimed at providing a venue in which free nations can work together to support democratic values, strengthen democratic institutions, and assist those who are working to build and sustain free societies. The year 2012 was a significant year for the United States and Mongolia, as the countries celebrated their 25th anniversary of diplomatic relations. U.S. assistance The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) plays a lead role in providing bilateral development assistance to Mongolia. The program emphasizes one major theme: sustainable, private sector- led economic growth and more effective and accountable governance. Total USAID assistance to Mongolia from 1991 through 2008 was about $174.5 million, all in grant form. USAID Mongolia's FY 2007 budget of $6.625 million a year promotes: a) economic growth that support macroeconomic policy reform, energy sector restructuring, financial sector reform, and micro and small enterprise development; and b) governing justly and democratically by focusing on activities supporting judicial sector reform, electoral reform, parliamentary reform, and anti-corruption.

Service history The most notable incident in the life of the Westmorland occurred shortly after she sailed for Britain from Livorno under Captain Michael Wallace late in 1778, carrying a large monetary payment for her inbound cargo of salt cod from Newfoundland (Livorno was a trade hub for this commodity), food goods,These included almost 4000 barrels of anchovies, 129 pounds of silk, 150 crates of manna and oil, thirty-four bales of hemp, thirty-two Parmesan cheeses, twenty- two barrels of Tartar salt and medicines and five crates of artificial flowers. and 57 crates of artistic objects collected by Grand Tourists such as the Duke of Gloucester, Sir John Henderson and the Duke of Norfolk.Including Batoni's portrait of Charles Cecil Roberts and a second portrait called An English Gentleman; sculptures by Albacini and Christopher Hewetson; a marble chimney originally destined for the Duke of Gloucester; musical scores, violins, violin strings, hats (two barrels), ornamental fans, expensive books; Piranesi sketches; specimens of lava from Mount Vesuvius sent by William Hamilton; relics; paintings by Pompeo Batoni, Anton Raphael Mengs, Carlo Maratta, Guido Reni, and Guercino, among others; modern copies of Raphael's paintings; drawings by artists working in Rome, including John Robert Cozens; 23 crates of ancient Roman marble statues and fragments, plus modern plaster casts; other carved marble mantelpieces, slabs of coloured marble for table- tops, full-sized Piranesi-like \\"vasi candelabri\\", 84 rolls of deluxe blank Genoa paper, a crate of flowering onion bulbs and seeds; boxes of pomade, sweetmeats and citrus-blossom water, four barrels of Madeira, and a double- barreled rifle.

Wallace attempted to outsail them but, outgunned as he was, soon felt he had little option but to allow the French to board his ship. She was then allowed by Spain (then friendly with France though not yet ‚Äî in formal terms at least ‚Äî at war with Britain) to continue to M√°laga. Hermitage) At M√°laga her artistic contents were passed on from the French government to two trading companies with links to Ireland, despite Wallace's protests that the ship was full of \\"extremely precious goods\\" (the French had already seized her cash cargo), and the Spanish king was informed by his prime minister, the Count of Floridablanca, of the arrival of the art works. Upon Spain's formal declaration of war, king Charles III secretly bought the art from a syndicate of Madrid merchants for 360,000 silver reales (a discount on their original asking price of 600,000 gold doubloons, but still a considerable sum) and had it brought by cart to the capital. The portraits of Basset and Lord Lewisham, meanwhile, were acquired by the Spanish Prime Minister. Although the British consul at Cadiz had initially informed the British Admiralty that the Westmorland and her cargo had been seized as legitimate prizes, demands followed from the British ambassador, firmly backed at cabinet level, for the repatriation of the art and (in a prisoner exchange for French and Spanish prisoners taken by the Royal Navy) the crew of the Westmorland. Yet to this day, all these coveted artistic treasures remain the possession of the Prado Museum, the Real Academia, and other Spanish national collections. There were only a few, very limited exceptions: a package of Catholic relics intended for the Duke of Norfolk (which the Spanish returned unopened to the Vatican); and Sir Watkin Williams Wynn's Perseus and Andromeda by Mengs, which ended up in the collection of Catherine the Great at the Hermitage Museum. In 1784, the ¬£100,000 for which the art had been insured at Livorno were paid out in London. The Westmorland, for its part, was renamed, re-commissioned into the Spanish fleet, but eventually re-taken in the Caribbean by the British. In 2012 an exhibition of many of the art works captured was held at the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford University and then traveled to the Yale Center for British Art in New Haven, United States.S√°nchez-J√°uregui and Wilcox.

Relations between the empire of Morocco and the United States of America date back to the American Revolutionary War (1775-1783). Morocco remains one of America's oldest and closest allies in North Africa, a status affirmed by Morocco's zero-tolerance policy towards Al-Qaeda and their affiliated groups. Morocco also assisted the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency with questioning al-Qaeda members captured in Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere during the administration of 43rd President George W. Bush, who designated the country as a Major non-NATO ally. Formal U.S. diplomatic relations with Morocco began in 1787 when the Confederation Congress ratified a Treaty of Peace and Friendship between the two nations which had been negotiated earlier in 1786. Renegotiated in 1836, the treaty is still in force, constituting the longest unbroken treaty relationship in U.S. history, and Tangier is home to the oldest U.S. diplomatic property in the world. Now a museum, the Tangier American Legation Museum is also the only building outside of the U.S. that is now a National Historic Landmark. Morocco is also one of the few countries in Africa to extend visa-free travel to American citizens. The U.S. maintains an embassy in Rabat, Morocco. Morocco maintains an embassy in the United States at 1601 21st Street N.W., Washington, D.C. 2009. 43rd President George W. Bush meeting with King Mohammed VI of Morocco in the White House in Washington, D.C. in April 2002 History =1777 ‚Äì 1787= On 20 December 1777, Sultan Mohammed ben Abdallah commissioned the Dutch consul in Sal√© to write letters to European merchants and consuls in Tangier, Sal√©, Larache and Mogador stating that vessels sailing under the American flag could enter Morocco's ports, alongside those of European countries with which Morocco had no diplomatic ties, such as Russia and Prussia, under the same conditions as those enjoyed by the nations that had treaty relations. Information about the Sultan's desire for friendly relations did not reach Benjamin Franklin, the American emissary to the Kingdom of France in Paris before April 1778 at the earliest. In 1777, Morocco became the first nation to conduct trade with the new United States, which is sometimes considered as a recognition of the country's independence ‚Äî but that \\"recognition\\" did not include the necessary treaty nor the exchange of ambassadors, only the admission of American ships. Morocco is the first country to recognize the U.S. On December 20, 1777, the Kingdom of Morocco became the first country in the world to recognize United States independence, only a year and a half after the U.S. Declaration of Independence was issued. Sultan Sidi Muhammad Ibn Abdullah actively sought to have an American diplomat negotiate a formal treaty, but meanwhile Moroccan pirates threatened American merchant shipping in the Mediterranean Sea. Finally, Thomas Barclay, the American consul in France, arrived in Morocco in 1786. There he negotiated the Moroccan‚ÄìAmerican Treaty of Friendship which was signed later that year in Europe by American diplomats John Adams and Thomas Jefferson and ratified by the Confederation Congress (under the earlier Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union government) in July 1787.Priscilla H. Roberts and Richard S. Roberts, Thomas Barclay (1728‚Äì1793): Consul in France, Diplomat in Barbary (Lehigh University Press, 2008), pp. 189‚Äì223. One of the many letters between America and Morocco was one by first President George Washington to Muhammed Ibn Abdullah. On December 1, 1789, eight months into his presidency, Washington speaks on his authority and leadership of the United States and the miscommunication between Morocco and America. In the letter, Washington expresses his regrets in lack of punctuality but clarifies that the untimely response was due to change in government and the want to communicate on solidified terms. Washington also shows appreciation for Muhammed Ibn Abdullah's diplomatic initiative tactics in protection of American ships from pirates. These actions are appreciated because of the lack of power United States as a country had held at the moment. Morocco was one of the first Arab, African, Muslim states to sign a treaty with America. America temporarily lacked a navy at the time, and could not defend its ships in the Mediterranean. = Abd ar-Rahman = In 1826, Sultan Abd ar-Rahman intervened on behalf of Abdulrahman Ibrahim Ibn Sori, a Muslim Fula nobleman enslaved in the US, after having read a letter Sori had sent to his family in Africa. Andrew Jackson capitalized on this event in his campaign against President John Quincy Adams. Portrait of Admiral Raphael Semmes who represented the Confederate States of America to Morocco during the American Civil War though Morocco never formally recognized the Confederate States. =American Civil War= During the American Civil War, Morocco reaffirmed its diplomatic alliance with the United States (Union). Morocco also became the scene of a colorful foreign relations and political warfare episode involving the Kingdom of Morocco, the United States of America, the Confederate States of America, France, and Great Britain. In 1862 Confederate diplomats Henry Myers and Tom Tate Tunstall were arrested outside the American Consulate in Tangier after making disparaging remarks about the United States and its flag. American consul, James De Long overheard their jeers and asked Moroccan police to seize the men. When word reached Confederate Admiral Raphael Semmes who was acting as the Confederate diplomat in the area, he sent out dispatches to as many neutral diplomats as he had contact with, including the British Consul to Morocco, John Drummond Hay. Semmes asked Hay to get involved and encourage Morocco to release the prisoners, to which Hay responded that he could only convey the message but not offer any recommendation for actions, as offering a recommendation would violate Britain's terms of neutrality. Semmes tried a similar tactic with the French consul, but without success. Eventually, European citizens living in Morocco rallied outside the American consulate demanding the prisoners' release. During the heat of the protest, American Lt. Commander Josiah Creesey drew his sword, which caused the mob to throw rocks. After the episode, the Moroccan government sent official word to Semmes that they could not meet with him to discuss the situation, because the two nations did not have formal diplomatic relations. Eventually, the Union officials ordered the two prisoners be sent to Fort Warren prison in Boston by way of Cadiz, Spain. Only after the French intervened while the ship was docked in Cadiz did President Abraham Lincoln issue an official order to release the prisoners.For a detailed description of the event, see: Abu-Talib, Mohammed, ‚ÄúMorocco and the American Civil War‚Äù in The Atlantic Connection: 200 Years of Moroccan-American Relations 1786‚Äì1986, Bookin-Weiner and El Mansour eds. Rabat, Morocco: Edino Press, 1990, pp. 57‚Äì69 As a result of the affair, Lincoln withdrew consul De Long. Having been irritated by Morocco's response, the Confederate States were never able to recover and manage relations with Morocco. In 1863, the King of Morocco released an official order stating in part: \\"... the Confederate States of America are fighting the government with whom we are in friendship and good relations... if any vessel of the so-called Confederate states enters your port, it shall not be received, but you must order it away on pain of seizure; and you will act on this subject in cooperation with the United States....\\"Abu-Talib, Mohammed, ‚ÄúMorocco and the American Civil War‚Äù in The Atlantic Connection: 200 Years of Moroccan-American Relations 1786‚Äì1986, Bookin-Weiner and El Mansour eds. Rabat, Morocco: Edino Press, 1990, p. 65 =Later 19th, early 20th Centuries= At the end of the Civil War, the first international convention ever signed by the United States, the 1865 Spartel Lighthouse Treaty, dealt with a navigational aid erected on the Moroccan side of the Strait of Gibraltar. The Treaty, ratified by Morocco, President Andrew Johnson, and nine European heads of state, granted neutrality to the lighthouse, with the condition that the ten naval powers signing the agreement assumed responsibility for its maintenance. Around the turn of the 20th century, as European colonizers gazed hungrily at Morocco's resources and strategically located harbors, the United States strongly defended the Kingdom's right to its continued sovereignty at the Conference of Madrid (1880), and again at the Algeciras Conference in 1906. In fact, the European powers were edging towards engaging in a continental war because of Morocco in 1905. President Theodore Roosevelt played an important role in settling the affair during the 1906 Algeciras Conference. Elihu Root, his Secretary of State, declared, \\"Fair play is what the United States asks - for Morocco and for all the interested nations - and it confidently expects that outcome.‚Äù citing Papers Relating to the Foreign Relations of the United States, 1905-1906, 28 November 1905, Washington DC, GPO 1906-1909 President Roosevelt offered a compromise plan which the European powers accepted. The proposal granted Morocco a greater deal of autonomy and allowed for all European nations to trade with Morocco.Holmes, James R. Theodore Roosevelt and World Order. Washington DC: Potomac Books Inc, 2006, pp. 191‚Äì201 In 1912, after Morocco became a protectorate of Spain and France because of Moroccan leadership mismanagement, American diplomats called upon the European powers to exercise colonial rule that guaranteed racial and religious tolerance. =World War I ‚Äì World War II= During World War I, Morocco was aligned with Allied forces. In 1917 and 1918, Moroccan soldiers fought victoriously alongside U.S. Marines at Chateau Thierry, Mont Blanc and Soissons. With France occupied by the Nazis during World War II, colonial French Morocco initially sided with the Axis Powers. When the Allies invaded Morocco on November 8, 1942, Moroccan defenders yielded to the British and American invaders. Shortly after Morocco surrendered, President Franklin D. Roosevelt sent a message to Morocco's King, H.E. Mohammed V, commending him on the ‚Äúadmirable spirit of cooperation that is animating you and your people in their relationships with the forces of my country. Our victory over the Germans will, I know, inaugurate a period of peace and prosperity, during which the Moroccan and French people of North Africa will flourish and thrive in a manner that befits its glorious past.‚Äù In what was to be the most pivotal meeting of Allied leaders during World War II, President Roosevelt, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and Free French commander General Charles De Gaulle met for four days in the Casablanca suburb of Anfa in January 1943 to discuss the war. During the Anfa Conference, the Allies agreed that the only acceptable outcome of the conflict was the ‚Äúunconditional surrender‚Äù of the Axis forces. President Roosevelt also conferred privately with King Mohammed V to assure him that the United States would support Morocco's quest for independence from France.Rosenblum, Jennifer & Zartman, William. ‚ÄúThe Far West of the Near East‚Äù in The Foreign Policies of Arab States, Korany & Dessouki eds.

New York: American University in Cairo Press, 2008, pp. 330‚Äì1. Morocco has also played a critical role in explaining the larger role of Arab policy to the United States. This was particularly true under the reign of King Hassan II.Spencer, Claire. The Maghreb in the 1990s, Adelphi Paper 274, February 1993, p. 49. After Morocco gained independence, President Dwight D. Eisenhower sent a congratulatory message to King Mohammed V: ‚ÄúMy Government renews its wishes for the peace and prosperity of Morocco, and has asked me to express its gratification that Morocco has freely chosen, as a sovereign nation, to continue in the path of its traditional friendships.‚Äù In November 1957, King Mohammed V traveled to Washington to pay an official call on President Eisenhower. Two years later, Eisenhower's vice president, Richard Nixon, traveled to Rabat to meet with the King. In 1961, King Hassan II, Mohammed V's successor, made the first of several diplomatic visits to the United States to confer with President John F. Kennedy. King Hassan II would later journey to Washington to meet Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and Bill Clinton. During the Cold War, Morocco remained officially non- aligned. However, unlike most other Arab states, Morocco displayed pro-western sympathies.Rosenblum, Jennifer & Zartman, William. ‚ÄúThe Far West of the Near East‚Äù in The Foreign Policies of Arab States, Korany & Dessouki eds. New York: American University in Cairo Press, 2008, p. 320. Indeed, one month after conducting joint military exercises with Morocco off the coast of Western Sahara in 1986, then-Secretary of Defense, Caspar Weinberger, visited Morocco to thank King Hassan II for his efforts in the Arab-Israeli peace process, and for seeking to mediate the United States' clash with Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi.White, Gregory et al. ‚ÄúThe Kingdom of Morocco‚Äù in The Government and Politics of the Middle East and North Africa, 4th Edition, eds. Long, David E and Reich, Bernard Boulder, CO: Westview Press, 2002, p. 417. In 1987 the Moroccan government agreed to the use of an old abandoned U.S. Strategic Air Command Base at Ben Gu√©rir as a transoceanic abort landing site for NASA's space shuttles during emergencies. On the military side, Morocco signed agreements with the U.S. government allowing U.S. forces access and transit rights to Moroccan Air Force bases. President Clinton personally flew to Rabat in July 1999 to attend King Hassan II's funeral, and to meet the son who succeeded him, King Mohammed VI. Upon taking the throne, King Mohammed VI made it quite clear that he wanted to continue his nation's centuries-old friendship with the United States. In his first speech as King in 1999, King Mohammed VI reaffirmed his father's policy of defending the nation's territorial integrity and strengthening ties with African nations, friends in Europe, and the United States.Rosenblum, Jennifer & Zartman, William. ‚ÄúThe Far West of the Near East‚Äù in The Foreign Policies of Arab States, Korany & Dessouki eds. New York: American University in Cairo Press, 2008, p. 323. One year later, King Mohammed VI made his first official visit to Washington. The leading Moroccan foreign policy official in recent times has been Taieb Fassi- Fihri who originally served under Hassan II as Minister-Delegate for Foreign Affairs, later Minister of Foreign Affairs. Serving as adviser to King Mohammed VI after 2012, he overshadows the foreign minister, Mohammed Ben Aissa.

Thus, the United States has a history of supporting Morocco in its conflict over Western Sahara. =1975‚Äì2006= In the 1970s, the United States made an effort to modernize Morocco's military to help with its conflict over Western Sahara. The United States focused particularly on Morocco's Royal Moroccan Air Force. Help from the United States was especially important when the Polisario deployed Soviet-built SA-6 surface-to-air missiles to counter the growing effectiveness of the Royal Moroccan Air Force. However, The Carter Administration shackled military support and weapons sales to Morocco with pre-conditions, stating the U.S. would only trade military supplies with Morocco for the purpose of modernizing Morocco's military, but not to assist with the conflict over Western Sahara. On the other hand, the Reagan Administration dropped all conditions in supporting the Moroccans, as the need for staging bases in North Africa for the Rapid Deployment Joint Task Force made access to Morocco's airfields strategically important. Beginning with the George H. W. Bush Administration, the focus of the U.S. security assistance efforts in Morocco shifted to sustaining and maintaining U.S.-origin equipment in the Moroccan Armed Forces. In the 1980s and early 1990s, Morocco secured about 1 billion dollars annually from Saudi Arabia to purchase arms and supplies from the United States to fight the POLISARIO and defend its claim to Western Sahara.Spencer, Claire.

They have been identified in multiple eukaryotes, including humans, mice, yeast and Arabidopsis thaliana. This class of RNAs includes both protein-coding and non- coding RNAs. Current evidence has suggested a variety of regulatory roles for NATs, such as RNA interference (RNAi), alternative splicing, genomic imprinting, and X-chromosome inactivation. NATs are broadly grouped into two categories based on whether they act in cis or in trans. Trans-NATs are transcribed from a different location than their targets and usually have complementarity to multiple transcripts with some mismatches. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are an example of trans-NATs that can target multiple transcripts with a few mismatches. Cis-natural antisense transcripts (cis-NATs) on the other hand are transcribed from the same genomic locus as their target but from the opposite DNA strand and form perfect pairs.  Orientation  Figure 1: Orientations of cis-NATs within the genome Cis-NATs have a variety of orientations and differing lengths of overlap between pairs. There have been five identified orientations for cis-NATs to date. The most common orientation is head-to-head, where the 5' ends of both transcripts align together. This orientation would result in the greatest knockdown of gene expression if transcriptional collision is the reason for transcript inhibition. There are however some studies that have suggested that tail-to-tail orientations are the most common NAT pairs. Others such as tail to tail, overlapping, nearby head-to- head, and nearby tail-to-tail are less frequently encountered. Completely overlapping NATs involve the antisense gene being located completely over top of each other. Nearby head-to-head and tail-to-tail orientations are physically discrete from each other but are located very close to each other. Current evidence suggests that there is an overrepresentation of NAT pairs in genes that have catalytic activity. There may be something about these genes in particular that makes them more prone to this type of regulation.  Identification approach  Identification of NATs in whole genomes is possible due to the large collection of sequence data available from multiple organisms. In silico methods for detecting NATs suffer from several shortcomings depending on the source of sequence information. Studies that use mRNA have sequences whose orientations are known, but the amount of mRNA sequence information available is small. Predicted gene models using algorithms trained to look for genes gives an increased coverage of the genome at the cost of confidence in the identified gene. Another resource is the extensive expressed sequence tag (EST) libraries but these small sequences must first be assigned an orientation before useful information can be extracted from them. Some studies have utilized special sequence information in the ESTs such as the poly(A) signal, poly(A) tail, and splicing sites to both filter the ESTs and to give them the correct transcriptional orientation. Combinations of the different sequence sources attempts to maximize coverage as well as maintain integrity in the data. Pairs of NATs are identified when they form overlapping clusters. There is variability in the cut-off values used in different studies but generally ~20 nucleotides of sequence overlap is considered the minimum for transcripts to be considered and overlapping cluster. Also, transcripts must map to only one other mRNA molecule in order for it to be considered a NAT pair. Currently there are a variety of web and software resources that can be used to look for antisense pairs. The NATsdb or Natural Antisense Transcript database is a rich tool for searching for antisense pairs from multiple organisms.  Mechanisms  Transcription collision model for expression inhibition Molecular mechanisms behind the regulatory role of cis-NATs are not currently well understood. Three models have been proposed to explain the regulatory effects that cis-NATs have on gene expression. The first model attributes that base pairing between the cis- NAT and its complementary transcript result in a knockdown of mRNA expression. The assumption of this model is that there will be a precise alignment of at least 6 base pairs between the cis-NAT pair to make double stranded RNA. Epigenetic modifications like DNA methylation and post-translational modification of core histones form the basis of the second model. Although it is not yet clearly understood, it is thought that the reverse transcript guides methylation complexes and/or histone-modifying complexes to the promoter regions of the sense transcript and cause an inhibition of expression from the gene. Currently it is not known what attributes of cis-NATs are crucial for the epigenetic model of regulation. The final proposed model that has gained favour due to recent experimental evidence is the transcriptional collision model. During the process of transcription of cis-NATs, the transcriptional complexes assemble in the promoter regions of the gene. RNA polymerases will then begin transcribing the gene at the transcription initiation site laying down nucleotides in a 5' to 3' direction. In the areas of overlap between the cis-NATs the RNA polymerases will collide and stop at the crash site. Transcription is inhibited because RNA polymerases prematurely stop and their incomplete transcripts get degraded.  Importance  Regulation of many biological processes such as development, metabolism and many others requires a careful co-ordination between many different genes; this is usually referred to as a gene regulatory network. A flurry of interest in gene regulatory networks has been sparked by the advent of sequenced genomes of multiple organisms. The next step is to use this information to figure out how genes work together and not just in isolation. During the processes of mammalian development, there is an inactivation of the extra X-chromosome in females. It has been shown that a NAT pair called Xist and Tsix are involved in the hypermethylation of the chromosome. As much as 20‚Äì30% of mammalian genes have been shown to be the targets of miRNAs, which highlights the importance of these molecules as regulators across a wide number of genes. Evolutionary reasons for utilizing RNA for regulation of genes may be that it is less costly and faster than synthesizing proteins not needed by the cell. This could have had a selective advantage for early eukaryotes with this type of transcriptional regulation.  Disease  Figure 3: Aberrant transcription of antisense transcripts can result in inhibition of oncogenes and allow cell to continue past cell cycle check points. Putative new oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes can be found by looking for upregulated antisense transcripts in cancer cells. Antisense transcription might contribute to disease through chromosomal changes that result in the production of aberrant antisense transcripts. A documented case of cis-NATs being involved in human disease comes from an inherited form of Œ±-thalassemia where there is silencing of the hemoglobin Œ±-2 gene through the action of a cis-NAT. It is thought that in malignant cancer cells with activated transposable elements creates a large amount of transcriptional noise. It is likely that aberrant antisense RNA transcripts resulting from this transcriptional noise may cause stochastic methylation of CpG islands associated with oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. This inhibition would further progress the malignancy of the cells since they lose key regulator genes. By looking at upregulated antisense transcripts in tumor cells, researchers are able to look for more candidate tumor suppressor genes. Also, aberrant cis-NATs have been implicated in neurological diseases such as Parkinson's disease.

History Relations between the United States and Mozambique are good and steadily improving. Besides Madagascar, Mozambique was the only East African country to be involved in importing African slaves to the Americas. By 1993, U.S. aid to Mozambique was prominent, due in part to significant emergency food assistance in the wake of the 1991-93 southern African drought, but more important in support of the peace and reconciliation process. During the process leading up to elections in October 1994, the United States served as a significant financier and member of the most important commissions established to monitor implementation of the Rome General Peace Accords. The United States is the largest bilateral donor to the country and plays a leading role in donor efforts to assist Mozambique. The U.S. Embassy opened in Maputo on November 8, 1975, and the first American ambassador arrived in March 1976. In that same year, the United States extended a $10 million grant to the Government of Mozambique to help compensate for the economic costs of enforcing sanctions against Rhodesia. In 1977, however, largely motivated by a concern with human rights violations, the U.S. Congress prohibited the provision of development aid to Mozambique without a presidential certification that such aid would be in the foreign policy interests of the United States. Relations hit a nadir in March 1981, when the Government of Mozambique expelled four members of the U.S. Embassy staff. In response, the United States suspended plans to provide development aid and to name a new ambassador to Mozambique. Relations between the two countries languished in a climate of stagnation and mutual suspicion. Embassy of Mozambique in Washington, D.C. Contacts between the two countries continued in the early 1980s as part of the U.S. administration's conflict resolution efforts in the region. In late 1983, a new U.S. ambassador arrived in Maputo, and the first Mozambican envoy to the United States arrived in Washington, signaling a thaw in the bilateral relationship. The United States subsequently responded to Mozambique's economic reform and drift away from Moscow's embrace by initiating an aid program in 1984. President of Mozambique Samora Machel paid a symbolically important official working visit to the United States in 1985, where he met U.S. President Ronald Reagan. After that meeting, a full U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) mission was established, and significant assistance for economic reform efforts began. President Joaquim Chissano met with President George W. Bush in September 2003; previously, he had met with Presidents Reagan (October 1987), Bush (March 1990), and Bill Clinton (November 1998), and also with Secretaries of State Colin Powell (February 2002) and James Baker (July 1992). Since taking office in February 2005, President Armando Guebuza has visited the United States on five occasions. In June 2005, President Guebuza visited Washington, D.C., to take part in President Bush's mini-summit on Africa, along with the leaders of Ghana, Namibia, Botswana, and Niger. Later that month, he attended the Corporate Council on Africa (CCA) Business Summit in Baltimore. President Guebuza returned in September 2005 for the United Nations General Assembly in New York and in December 2005 attended the Fourth Development Cooperation Forum at the Carter Center in Atlanta. In 2006 he visited New York for the UN General Assembly, and in 2007 he visited Washington, D.C. for the signing of Mozambique's Millennium Challenge Corporation compact.

Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte with U.S. President Donald Trump in the Oval Office of the White House on 18 July 2019 The U.S. partnership with the Netherlands is one of its oldest continuous relationships and dates back to the American Revolution. Starting in the late 16th century, the Dutch and other Europeans began to colonize the eastern coast of North America. The Dutch named their territory New Netherland, which became a colony of the Dutch Republic in 1624. The Dutch colonial settlement of New Amsterdam later became New York City. The present-day flag of New York City is based on the flag of Republic of the United Netherlands. Though the action was disavowed by the government of the Netherlands, on November 16, 1776, the fort at St. Eustatius gave the first formal salute (firing its guns nine times) to a ship flying the American flag. On 19 April 1782, John Adams was received by the States General in The Hague and recognized as Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States of America. By doing so, it became the second foreign country to recognize the United States (after France on February 6, 1778). The house that Adams purchased in The Hague became the first American embassy in the world. Dutch officers in Sumatra (then part of the Dutch East Indies) assisted the U.S. Navy during the First and Second Sumatran Expeditions in 1832 and 1838 respectively. Both operations were punitive expeditions, carried out against Chiefdom of Kuala Batee after the crews of U.S. merchant ships were massacred by the native Malays. In 1861-63 the Lincoln administration looked abroad for places to relocate freed slaves who wanted to leave the United States. It opened U.S. negotiations with the Dutch government regarding African American migration and colonization of the Dutch colony of Suriname in South America. Nothing came of the idea, and after 1864 the idea was dropped.Michael J.

The Netherlands was steadfastly neutral in the late 19th and early 20th century trading with everyone but avoiding alliances. In foreign affairs it build up its overseas empire especially in the Dutch East Indies (Indonesia). Neutrality did not stop the Nazi invasion in 1940, and after its liberation 1945 neutrality was no longer attractive. the Dutch tried for years to recover its valuable colony of Indonesia, but the United States was impressed with the anti-communist stance of the Indonesian Republic, and insisted that the Dutch leave. Resentfully, they did so, and refocused their attention on West European and trans-Atlantic relations.Marc Frey, \\"Decolonization and Dutch-American Relations,\\" in Krabebbendam, ed., Four Centuries of Dutch-American Relations (2009) pp 609-20. By the 1950s, according to Giles Scott-Smith the Americans considered the Dutch to be perfect allies in the Cold War: :The Dutch were politically close to the UK and were opposed to European affairs being dominated by either a renewed France or a resurgent Germany....the Dutch body politic, dominated as it was by the democratic socialists and Christian parties, was resoundingly anti-communist in outlook. The Netherlands was also positive towards a US-led free-trade regime, and during the Cold War was wholly committed to building a managed post-war economic and political order based around international organizations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).Giles Scott- Smith, \\"The Ties that Bind: Dutch-American Relations, US Public Diplomacy and the Promotion of American Studies since the Second World War.\\" The Hague Journal of Diplomacy 2.3 (2007): 283-305, at p 290.

The Dutch have worked with the United States at the World Trade Organization, in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, as well as within the European Union to advance the shared US goal of a more open and market-led world economy. The Dutch were allies with the United States in the Korean War and the first Gulf War and have been active in global peacekeeping efforts in the former Yugoslavia, Afghanistan and Iraq. Netherlands also support and participate in NATO and EU training efforts in Iraq.

History  =Walker's 1855 filibustering = In the traditional historiography by historians in the United States and in Latin America, William Walker's filibustering represented the high tide of antebellum American imperialism. His brief seizure of Nicaragua in 1855 is typically called a representative expression of Manifest destiny with the added factor of trying to expand slavery into Central America. Historian Michel Gobat, however, presents a strongly revisionist interpretation. He argues that Walker was invited in by Nicaraguan liberals who were trying to force economic modernization and political liberalism. Walker's government comprised those liberals, as well as Yankee colonizers, and European radicals. Walker even included some local Catholics as well as indigenous peoples, Cuban revolutionaries, and local peasants. His coalition was much too complex and diverse to survive long, but it was not the attempted projection of American power, concludes Gobat.Michel Gobat, Empire by Invitation: William Walker and Manifest Destiny in Central America (Harvard UP, 2018). See this roundtable evaluation by scholars at H-Diplo. =Occupation of Nicaragua= The United States from 1912 to 1933 was part of the Banana Wars, when the US military intervened in various Latin American countries from 1898 to 1934. The formal occupation began in 1912, even though there were various other assaults by the U.S. in Nicaragua throughout this period. American military interventions in Nicaragua were designed to stop any other nation from building a Nicaraguan Canal. Nicaragua assumed a quasi-protectorate status under the 1916 Bryan‚ÄìChamorro Treaty. President Herbert Hoover (1929-1933) opposed the relationship. Finally in 1933 President Franklin D Roosevelt, invoking his new Good Neighbor policy ended American intervention.Alan McPherson, \\"Herbert Hoover, Occupation Withdrawal, and the Good Neighbor Policy.\\" Presidential Studies Quarterly 44.4 (2014): 623-639. online =Nicaraguan Revolution= =Recent history= After being condemned for terrorism, the U.S has aimed to support the consolidation of the democratic process in Nicaragua with the 1990 election of President Chamorro. The United States has promoted national reconciliation, encouraging Nicaraguans to resolve their problems through dialogue and compromise. It recognizes as legitimate all political forces that abide by the democratic process and eschew violence. U.S. assistance is focused on strengthening democratic institutions, stimulating sustainable economic growth, and supporting the health and basic education sectors. Until recently, the resolution of U.S. citizen claims arising from Sandinista-era confiscations and expropriations still figured prominently in bilateral policy concerns. Section 527 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act (1994) prohibits certain U.S. assistance and support for a government of a country that has confiscated U.S. citizen property, unless the government has taken certain remedial steps. After the Secretary of State had twenty times issued annual national interest waivers of the Section 527 prohibition, in August 2015 the U.S. Embassy in Managua announced a decision that the waiver was no longer needed, in a statement that included \\"The United States recognizes the work of the current government administration ‚Äòto resolve pending claims in an expeditious and satisfactory manner.‚Äô\\" Other key U.S. policy goals for Nicaragua are: * Improving respect for human rights and resolving outstanding high-profile human rights cases; * Developing a free market economy with respect for property and intellectual property rights; * Ensuring effective civilian control over defense and security policy; * Increasing the effectiveness of Nicaragua's efforts to combat trans-border crimes, including narcotics trafficking, money laundering, illegal alien smuggling, international terrorist and criminal organizations, and trafficking in persons; and * Reforming the judicial system and implementing good governance. Since 1990, the United States has provided over $1.2 billion in assistance to Nicaragua. About $260 million of that was for debt relief, and another $450 million was for balance-of-payments support. The U.S. also provided $93 million in 1999, 2000, and 2001 as part of its overall response to Hurricane Mitch. In response to Hurricane Felix, the United States provided over $400,000 in direct aid to Nicaragua to support recovery operations from the damage inflicted in September 2007. Aside from funding for Hurricanes Mitch and Felix, the levels of assistance have fallen incrementally to reflect the improvements in Nicaragua. Assistance has been focused on promoting more citizen political participation, compromise, and government transparency; stimulating sustainable growth and income; and fostering better-educated and healthier families. The Millennium Challenge Corporation signed a 5-year, $175 million compact with the Republic of Nicaragua on July 14, 2005. The Millennium Challenge Compact is intended to reduce poverty and spur economic growth by funding projects in the regions of Le√≥n and Chinandega aimed at reducing transportation costs and improving access to markets for rural communities; increasing wages and profits from farming and related enterprises in the region; and increasing investment by strengthening property rights. Embassy of Nicaragua in Washington, D.C. Principal U.S. Officials include: * Ambassador‚ÄîLaura Farnsworth-Dogu The Embassy of Nicaragua is located in the Dupont Circle neighborhood of Washington, D.C. The Embassy of the United States is located in Managua, Nicaragua. = NICA Act = In 2016, the Nicaragua Investment Conditionality Act of 2016 (NICA) was passed by the United States House of Representatives. It was unable to be approved by the Senate or the president due to the 2016 presidential election. The bill would, as a response to the alleged election fraud committed by president Daniel Ortega during the 2016 election prevent Nicaragua from taking additional loans until they are willing to \\"[take] effective steps to hold free, fair and transparent elections.\\" The bill was reintroduced to the House of Representatives again during a new session in 2017. The Nicaraguan Government and every single political party (including those who originally voiced concern over the election) opposed this bill, with Nicaraguan Vice President Rosario Murillo calling it a ‚Äúreactionary and interventionist\\" action that would ‚Äúundermine the right of Nicaragua to continue developing the socialist model.‚Äù. All ALBA member states are opposed to the bill. The following trade unionists have also voiced their opposition to the bill by signing a solidarity statement in support of the Government of Nicaragua: * Rosa Pavanelli of Public Services International * Joe O'Flynn of SIPTU * Owen Tudor of Trades Union Congress * Tim Roache of Britain's General Union * Kevin Courtney of National Union of Teachers * Mick Cash of National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers * Dave Prentis of UNISON On December 20, 2018, U.S. President Donald Trump signed the NICA Act into law after it had already been unanimously approved by Congress. This enactment comes eight months after the beginning of the 2018‚Äì2020 Nicaraguan protests. = School of the Americas and Fr. Roy Bourgeois = In 1987, United States Senator Bob Dole visited Managua and criticized President Daniel Ortega for two of Nicaragua's political prisoners. Ortega offered to free the two political prisoners, who were opposition lawyers, in exchange for the freedom of the founder of School of the Americas Watch, Roy Bourgeois. In 2012, Nicaragua ended relations with the School of the Americas, refusing to send any more trainees to the institute. In a news release, he stated that the School of the Americas has victimized Nicaragua (likely referring to the Contras, who were trained at the institute).

Nigeria and the United States have long been close allies. The United States is Nigeria's main trading partner and is its most important diplomatic partner. With the nullification of Nigeria's June 12, 1993, presidential election, the substantial amount of human rights abuses, and the failure to embark on a meaningful democratic transition, the United States has imposed numerous sanctions on Nigeria. After a period of increasingly strained relations, the death of General Abacha in June 1998, and his replacement by General Abubakar opened a new phase of improved bilateral relations. As the transition to democracy progressed, the removal of visa restrictions, increased high-level visits of U.S. officials, discussions of future assistance, and the granting of a Vital National Interest Certification on counter-narcotics, effective in March 1999, paved the way for re-establishment of closer ties between the United States and Nigeria as a key partner in the region and the continent. Since the inauguration of the Obasanjo government, the bilateral relationship has continued to improve, and cooperation on many important foreign policy goals, such as regional peacekeeping, has been excellent. The government has lent strong diplomatic support to U.S. Government counter-terrorism efforts in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. The Government of Nigeria, in its official statements, has both condemned the terrorist attacks and supported military action against the Taliban and Al Qaida. Nigeria also has played a leading role in forging an anti-terrorism consensus among states in Sub- Saharan Africa. An estimated one million Nigerians and Nigerian Americans live, study, and work in the United States, while over 25,000 Americans live and work in Nigeria. There are many Nigerian organizations in the United States. Prominent among them is the Nigerian Union Diaspora (NUD), which is the umbrella Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) for the economic and political empowerment of the people of Nigerian descent outside Nigeria. President Yar'Adua visited President Bush at the White House on December 13, 2007. Nigeria is consistently a pro-America nation. According to the 2012 U.S. Global Leadership Report, 77% of Nigerians approve of U.S. leadership, with 9% disapproving and 14% uncertain,U.S. Global Leadership Project Report - 2012 Gallup and according to a 2013 BBC World Service Poll, 59% of Nigerians view U.S. influence positively, with 29% expressing a negative view. According to a 2014 Global Opinion Poll, 69% of Nigerians view the U.S. favorably.Opinion of the United States U.S. foreign assistance priorities Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa at the White House with President Kennedy in 1961, shortly after Nigerian independence. \\"Investing in People\\" is the top U.S. foreign assistance priority in Nigeria. The U.S. ability to help Nigeria combat public health shortcomings contributes directly to good governance, societal stability, economic growth, and confidence in U.S. concern for the well-being of the Nigerian people. The prospects of the mutual cooperation is very decisive. Considering the fact that Nigeria is currently the economic powerhouse of the African continent and that the Nation has the richest black man and richest black woman in the world according to Forbes magazine. Nigeria is also a capitalist economy and it is this inherent similarity in both the Nigerian economy and the United States economy that proves the prospects of this cooperation to be highly favorable. U.S. efforts to eradicate malaria will focus on the sale of insecticide-treated nets and treatments kits, and provide therapies and intermittent preventive treatment of pregnant women. To reduce death and disability as a result of TB, especially in the vulnerable co-infected HIV/AIDS population, U.S. assistance will strengthen the Nigerian health system, and referral systems between diagnosis and treatment programs for TB and AIDS. Furthermore, the U.S. Government focuses resources on expanding access to quality family planning services and reproductive health care and strives to increase the contraceptive prevalence rate to 14%. One- third (10 million) of Nigerian children are enrolled in primary school. Only 45% of primary-school aged children have functional numeric skills, and only 28% are literate. The United States hopes to bolster basic education, including at Islamic schools, which provide both religious instruction and a secular curriculum, through teacher training and community involvement, and ensure equitable access to quality basic education. Governing Justly and Democratically: The United States is helping Nigeria make exceptional efforts to develop inclusive, transparent, and effective institutions of democratic governance. U.S. assistance helps rebuild basic mechanisms of democratic governance to make elected officials accountable to constituents through free and fair elections, strong government institutions, and well-organized, informed citizens who demand performance. The U.S. advances rule of law in Nigeria by strengthening the capacity and transparency of law enforcement agencies and judiciary. The United States supports democratic local government and decentralization and improves fiscal administration by maximizing revenue collection in credible audits. It strengthens the civil society by promoting existing watchdog groups that have lobbied successfully for more transparency, accountability, and pluralism in Nigeria's fiscal, electoral, conflict management, political, and human rights affairs. Peace and Security: The United States has supported the peacekeeping and simulation centers at the Armed Forces Staff College‚Äîthe only one in Africa and a major regional asset‚Äîand has continued to provide equipment and training for Nigerian peacekeeping forces while promoting effective civilian oversight of the military and its adherence to human rights norms. The U.S. is building the capacity of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to prevent and respond to regional instability and promote the integration of ECOWAS security mechanisms into a broad Africa framework. It is also funding military-sponsored schools, clinics and basic community services to demonstrate U.S. commitment to help build the nation's infrastructure. Beyond fostering maritime cooperation with security services in the Niger Delta, the United States supports the European Union's leading role in helping Nigeria fight corruption, organized criminal elements, document fraud, drug traffickers, and terrorists. The U.S. will focus on training, developmental and technical aid, and law enforcement cooperation in border control and against arms smuggling and oil theft. Expanded community policing programs will improve Nigeria's human rights record and restore public faith and cooperation with the security services. The U.S. will continue to offer legal reform, training, and technical help to Nigeria's counter-terrorism finance regime. Economic Growth: The United States is working with the Central Bank of Nigeria, Finance Ministry, National Planning Commission, and others to improve the environment for investment in agriculture through policy reform at the national and state level. Micro-investment is hindered by lack of access to market-driven financial services and lack in policy that provides for liberalization of credit institutions and encourages savings plans with transparency in both the private and public sectors. Federal and state policy strengthening are essential as business decisions and banking regulation take place at both levels. U.S. programs help develop a policy climate in which micro, small and medium enterprises have access to credit, encourage investment, stimulate job growth, and build capacity in both the public and private sectors. Trade initiatives include capacity building in customs regulation and operations, policy reform to encourage internal and external trade, taking advantage of AGOA incentives for bilateral trade, and development of the private sector capacity to meet international trade and export standards. Ongoing presidential initiatives with Nigeria include the African Growth and Competitiveness Initiative, fighting avian flu, the Initiative to End Hunger in Africa, and the Trans-Sahel Counter-Terrorism Program. Nigeria's eligibility for other regional activities include the Famine Early Warning System, Anti-Corruption Initiative; trafficking in persons; and the Ambassador's Girls Scholarship Fund. Nigeria is a premier participant in the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), for which $270 million was committed in FY 2007. On January 15, 2015, former Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Johnnie Carson urged increased engagement with Nigeria for both the US and European partners, to assist in maintaining stability in the light of the upcoming 2015 Nigerian general election, security problems in Northeastern Nigeria, and economic concerns regarding rising oil prices.Carson, Johnnie.

The United States and Norway have a long tradition of positive relations. The American Revolution of 1776 had a profound impact on Norway, and the democratic ideals of the United States Constitution served as a model for the authors of Norway's own Constitution of 1814. The close relationship between the two nations was reinforced by massive Norwegian emigration to the U.S. during the period 1825‚Äì1940, when more than 850,000 Norwegians made new homes in the United States and helped build the nation. After the liberation from German occupation 1945, Norway abandoned its history of neutrality and joined NATO, stressing its military alliance and economic cooperation with Britain and the United States. The Marshall Plan helped Norway to modernize its economy and integrate more into the world market. It avoided any provocation that might offend the Soviet Union, its northern neighbor. Since the 1960s, Norway has been drawn increasingly into European affairs while the importance of ties to Britain and the United States has declined. Norway refuses to join the European Union, and engages in a largely independent foreign policy. There is a lingering desire for nonalignment, strengthened by the discovery of vast amounts of oil, that built up a huge rainy day fund in the treasury.Geir Lundestad, \\"The evolution of Norwegian security policy: Alliance with the West and reassurance in the East.\\" Scandinavian Journal of History 17.2-3 (1992): 227-256. The friendly state of the bilateral relationship was reinforced when King Harald V of Norway hosted the visit of U.S. President Bill Clinton in November 1999, the first visit to Norway by a U.S. President in office. The excellent relations between Norway and the United States, and the Mission in Oslo can focus its efforts on projects that serve mutual interests. Among them are expanding on the success of NATO in securing transatlantic security, promoting new business opportunities between the two nations, working with the Arctic Council to preserve the Arctic environment and with Russia in particular in the Barents Sea, helping the Baltic nations to find their place in the new Europe, and capitalizing on information technology to promote human rights and a sense of world community.

In the Upper Midwest, especially Minnesota, western Wisconsin, northern Iowa, and the Dakotas, more than 15% of whites are of Norwegian descent. Nearly one-third of all North Dakotans claim Norwegian as their ancestry. *55% of Norwegian Americans live in the Midwest, although a large number (21%) live in the Pacific States of Washington, Oregon, and California. *Norwegian Americans actively celebrate and maintain their heritage in many ways. Much of it centers on the Lutheran-Evangelical churches they were born into, but also culinary customs (lutefisk and lefse), costumes (bunad), and Norwegian holidays (Syttende Mai, May 17) are popular. A number of towns in the United States, particularly in the Upper Midwest, display very strong Norwegian influences. *Although the Norwegians were the most numerous of all the Scandinavian immigrant groups, other Scandinavians also emigrated to America during the same time period. Today, there are 11‚Äì12 million Americans of Scandinavian ancestry. Scandinavian descendants represent about 6% of the white population in the United States as a whole, and more than 25% of the white population of the Upper Midwest. *Norwegian Americans tend to be Lutheran (Norwegian-American Lutheranism), although substantial minorities are Roman Catholic or belong to other Protestant denominations. *There are more people of Norwegian ancestry in America than in Norway. Historically high birth rates over the past hundred years among Norwegian Americans resulted in their roughly quadrupling in population over the original 850,000 immigrants.

The U.S. relationship with Oman dates back 200 years, with American merchant ships making port calls in Oman as early as 1790. Oman was the first Arab nation to recognize the United States, sending an envoy in 1841.  History  Omani Foreign Minister Yusuf bin Alawi bin Abdullah meets with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo (right) in 2019 Royal Navy of Oman sailors receive training from the US Coast Guard aboard the in 2019 The United States had established trade relations with the Sultanate in the early years of American independence. The first Treaty of Amity and CommerceTreaty of Amity and Commerce, p. 458. U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774 - 1875 was concluded at Muscat on September 21, 1833, by Edmund Roberts and Said bin Sultan. The treaty was the first agreement of its kind with an independent Arab state in the Persian Gulf. This initial treaty was replaced by the Treaty of Amity, Economic Relations, and Consular Rights signed at Salalah on December 20, 1958. A U.S. consulate was maintained in Muscat from 1880 until 1916. Thereafter, U.S. interests in Oman were handled by U.S. diplomats resident in other countries. In 1972, the U.S. ambassador in Kuwait was accredited also as the first U.S. ambassador to Oman, and the U.S. embassy, headed by a resident charge d'affaires, was opened. The first resident U.S. ambassador took up his post in July 1974. The Oman embassy was opened in Washington, DC, in 1973. U.S.-Omani relations were deepened in 1980 by the conclusion of two important agreements. One provided access to Omani military facilities by U.S. forces under agreed-upon conditions. The other agreement established a Joint Commission for Economic and Technical Cooperation, located in Muscat, to provide U.S. economic assistance to Oman. The Joint Commission continued in existence until the mid-1990s. A Peace Corps program, which assisted Oman mainly in the fields of health and education, was initiated in 1973 and phased out in 1983. A team from the Federal Aviation Administration worked with Oman's Civil Aviation Department on a reimbursable basis but was phased out in 1992. In March 2005, the U.S. and Oman launched negotiations on a Free Trade Agreement that were successfully concluded in October 2005.

On October 1, 1994, after five decades of US administration, the country of Palau became the last component of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands to gain its independence. In 1978, Palau decided not to join the Federated States of Micronesia, due to culture and language differences, and instead sought independence. In 1986, a Compact of Free Association between Palau and the United States was approved, paving the way for Palau's independence.

Desperate to construct a canal, the United States saw the separatist movement as an opportunity. Despite the Bidlack-Mallarino Treaty of 1846 in which the United States would intervene in the event of a disorder between Panama and Colombia in Colombia‚Äôs favor, the United States prevented Colombian forces from moving across the isthmus to stop the Panamanian uprising. On November 4, 1903, the immediate support of the USA secured the Declaration of Independence of Panama from Colombia. In return, Panama signed the Hay‚ÄìBunau-Varilla Treaty three weeks later, granting the USA sovereign rights over the interoceanic canal that would be built over the following decade.  Relations during the 20th century The evolution of the relation between Panama and the USA has followed the pattern of a Panamanian project for the recovering of the territory of the Canal of Panama, a project which became public after the events of May 21, 1958, November 3, 1959, and then on January 9, 1964. The latter day is known in Panama as the Martyrs' Day (Panama), in which a riot over the right to raise the Panamanian flag in an American school became the vicinity of the Panama Canal. The following years saw a lengthy negotiation process with the United States, culminating with the Torrijos‚ÄìCarter Treaties, in which the transfer of the Panama Canal to Panama was set to be completed in December, 1999. The process of transition, however, was made difficult by the existence of the de facto military rule of Manuel Noriega in Panama from 1982 to 1989. The 1977 Panama Canal Treaties entered into force on October 1, 1979. They replaced the 1903 Hay‚ÄìBunau-Varilla Treaty between the United States and Panama (modified in 1936 and 1955), and all other U.S.-Panama agreements concerning the Panama Canal, which were in force on that date. The treaties comprise a basic treaty governing the operation and defense of the Canal from October 1, 1979 to December 31, 1999 (Panama Canal Treaty) and a treaty guaranteeing the permanent neutrality of the Canal (Neutrality Treaty). The details of the arrangements for U.S. operation and defense of the Canal under the Panama Canal Treaty are spelled out in separate implementing agreements. The Canal Zone and its government ceased to exist when the treaties entered into force and Panama assumed complete jurisdiction over Canal Zone territories and functions, a process which was finalized on December 31, 1999. =United States invasion of Panama= On December 20, 1989, in order to arrest Manuel Noriega, the United States invaded Panama. The military intervention helped to swear into power the winners of the elections of May 1989, President Guillermo Endara. The History of the Relations between Panama and the USA are a mandatory course in the curriculum of Public High School in Panama. Recent history The United States cooperates with the Panamanian government in promoting economic, political, security, and social development through U.S. and international agencies. Cultural ties between the two countries are strong and many Panamanians go to the United States for higher education and advanced training. In 2007, the U.S. and Panama partnered to launch a regional health worker training center. The center provides training to community healthcare workers in Panama and throughout Central America. About 25,000 American citizens reside in Panama, many are retirees from the Panama Canal Commission and individuals who hold dual nationality. There is also a rapidly growing enclave of American retirees in the Chiriqu√≠ Province in western Panama. Panama continues to fight against the illegal narcotics and arms trade. The country's proximity to major cocaine-producing nations and its role as a commercial and financial crossroads make it a country of special importance in this regard. The Panamanian Government has concluded agreements with the U.S. on maritime law enforcement, counter-terrorism, counter- narcotics, and stolen vehicles. A three-year investigation by the Drug Prosecutors Office (DPO), the PTJ, and several other law enforcement agencies in the region culminated in the May 2006 arrest in Brazil of Pablo Rayo Montano, a Colombian-born drug crime boss. Assets located in Panama belonging to his drug cartel were among those seized by the Government of Panama following his indictment by a U.S. federal court in Miami. In March 2007, the United States Coast Guard, in cooperation with the Government of Panama, seized over 38,000 lbs. of cocaine off the coast of Panama, the largest drug seizure in the eastern Pacific. Panama signed the Lima Declaration, which has been signed by multiple Latin American countries. The document is a collective rejection of Venezuela‚Äôs Constituent Assembly and identifies president Maduro of Venezuela as a dictator. In the beginning of August 2017, Vice President Pence visited Panama City, Panama to give a joint statement with President Varela regarding the two countries joint efforts to restore democracy in Venezuela, but more importantly reflect on the relationship between the two countries. In the economic investment arena, the Panamanian government has been successful in the enforcement of intellectual property rights as well as has concluded a Bilateral Investment Treaty Amendment with the United States and an agreement with the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. Although money laundering remains a problem, Panama passed significant reforms in 2000 intended to strengthen its cooperation against international financial crimes. In January 2005, Panama sent election supervisors to Iraq as part of the International Mission for Iraqi Elections to monitor the national elections. In 2015, former Panamanian president Ricardo Martinelli fled to the United States and asked for asylum. Despite a Panamanian request for extradition on wiretapping charges, Martinelli was only arrested in June 2017 and extradited in June 2018. The delay caused critics in Panama to question about American interference. The United States also worked against improving relations between Panama and China. When a Chinese container ship became the first ship to pass through the new Panama Canal locks in June 2016, US Ambassador John D. Feeley arranged for a US Navy ship to be stationed in view of the Chinese ship. While Feeley expressed concerns about Panamanian plans to establish diplomatic relations with China, Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela denied that anything was happening. Negotiations were held in Madrid and Beijing to escape surveillance by the US Embassy, and the US Ambassador was only told one hour before the public announcement. Ambassador Feeley also persuaded Panama's Security Ministry to deny the Chinese company Huawei a contract for communications technology, which was handed to the US company General Dynamics.

Feeley * Deputy chief of mission - John Law Diplomatic missions US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo speaks at the US embassy in Panama City in 2018 The U.S. Embassy in Panama is in Panama City, Panama. In 1938, the site in Avenida Balboa was leased from the Government of Panama for 99 years. The chancery building was constructed under the supervision of the Foreign Buildings Office of the Department of State in 1941. The total cost of the land and construction was $366,719. The first diplomatic mission of the United States of America in the Republic of Panama was established in 1904, the year after Panama achieved independence from Colombia on November 3, 1903. The first American Minister was William L. Buchanan of Covington, Ohio. For many years, The American Legation was for many years located at the corner of Central Avenue and Fourth Street. It was raised to Diplomatic mission status in 1939 and moved to its current location on April 2, 1942. The United States first established a consular office in Panama in 1823 when Panama was a department of Colombia. It became a Consulate General on September 3, 1884 and was combined with the Embassy on April 6, 1942. Earliest available records of the Consulate date from 1910 when the Consulate was located in the Diario de Panama Building near the Presidential Palace. It was then moved to the Marina Building across from the Presidential Palace. It subsequently moved to several other buildings in Panama City, before coming to its current location in Building 783, Clayton. There is also a virtual post in Colon. Panama maintains an embassy in Washington. See also *Panamanian Americans *List of ambassadors of the United States to Panama *Panama Canal References Further reading * Conniff, Michael L.

Paraguay‚ÄìUnited States relations are bilateral relations between the Republic of Paraguay and the United States of America. According to the 2012 U.S. Global Leadership Report, 41% of Paraguayans approve of U.S. leadership, with 24% disapproving and 35% uncertain.U.S. Global Leadership Project Report ‚Äì 2012 Gallup U.S. interests in Paraguay The United States and Paraguay have an extensive relationship at the government, business, and personal level. Paraguay is a partner in hemispheric initiatives to improve counter narcotics cooperation, combat money laundering, human trafficking, and other illicit cross-border activities, and adequately protect intellectual property rights. The United States looks to Paraguay, which has tropical forest and riverine resources, to engage in hemispheric efforts to ensure sustainable development. The United States and Paraguay also cooperate in international organizations. Paraguay has taken significant steps to combat terrorism financing activity in the tri-border area it shares with Argentina and Brazil. It participates in anti terrorism programs and fora, including the \\"Three Plus One Security Dialogue\\", with its neighbors and the United States. The United States strongly supports consolidation of Paraguay's democracy and continued economic reform, the cornerstones of cooperation among countries in the hemisphere. The United States has played important roles in defending Paraguay's democratic institutions, in helping resolve the April 1996 crisis, and in ensuring that the March 1999 change of government took place without further bloodshed. Bilateral trade with the United States has increased over the last four years, after a steady decline over several years due to a long- term recession of the Paraguayan economy. Although U.S. imports from Paraguay were only $51.28 million in 2005, down from $58.58 million the previous year, U.S. exports to Paraguay in 2005 were $895.53 million, up from $622.87 million in 2004, according to U.S. Customs data. (Not all exports and imports are reflected in Paraguayan government data.) More than a dozen U.S. multinational firms have subsidiaries in Paraguay. These include firms in the computer, agro-industrial, telecom, banking, and other service industries. Some 75 U.S. businesses have agents or representatives in Paraguay, and more than 3,000 U.S. citizens reside in the country. The U.S. maintains an embassy in Asunci√≥n, Paraguay. The United States Ambassador to Paraguay is M. Lee McClenny. U.S. assistance The U.S. Government has assisted Paraguayan development since 1942. In 2006, Paraguay signed a $34.9 million Millennium Challenge Corporation's (MCC) Threshold Country Program (TCP) with the U.S. focused on supporting Paraguay's effort to combat impunity and informality. Also in 2006, Paraguay signed and ratified an agreement with the U.S. under the Tropical Forest Conservation Act that provides Paraguay with $7.4 million in relief and zeroing out its remaining bilateral debt in exchange for the Paraguayan Government's commitment to conserve and restore tropical forests in the southeastern region of the country. Separately, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) supports programs to strengthen Paraguay's democratic institutions in the areas of civil society, local government and decentralization, national reform of the state, rule-of-law, and anti- corruption. Other important areas of intervention are economic growth, the environment and public health. The total amount of the program was approximately $10 million in fiscal year 2006. The U.S. Department of State, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Department of Justice and the Department of Treasury provide technical assistance, equipment, and training to strengthen counter narcotics enforcement, combat trafficking in persons, promote respect for intellectual property rights, and to assist in the development and implementation of money laundering legislation and counter terrorism legislation. * On December 19, 2003, U.S. and Paraguayan officials signed a new Memorandum of Understanding to strengthen the legal protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights in Paraguay. The MOU was extended in 2006 through the end of 2007. * Since 2003 the U.S. Government has had a Resident Justice Advisor in Paraguay to support efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist financing and other financial crimes as well as organized crime and corruption. * In 2006, the State Department's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) provided Paraguay with $494,000 in assistance to support its efforts to combat narcotics trafficking, money laundering, and violations of intellectual property rights. * Starting in 2004, a Resident Public Debt Advisor, a Resident Budget Advisor, and a Resident Tax Advisor from the Department of Treasury have been working with Paraguayan counterparts to implement essential reforms. The Peace Corps has about 160 volunteers working throughout Paraguay on projects ranging from agriculture and natural resources to education, rural health, and urban youth development. 2007 marked the 40th anniversary of the Peace Corps in Paraguay. The Office of Public Diplomacy also is active in Paraguay, funding Fulbright and other scholarships to the U.S., U.S. scholars to Paraguay, other short- and long-term exchanges, English scholarship programs, donations of books and equipment, and a cultural preservation project to restore Paraguay's National Library. The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) provides technical assistance and training to help modernize and professionalize the military, including by promoting respect for human rights and obedience to democratically elected civilian authorities. DoD also provides assistance to impoverished communities through its Humanitarian Assistance Program. A military training agreement with Asunci√≥n, giving immunity to US soldiers, caused concern after media reports initially reported that a base housing 20,000 US soldiers was being built at Mariscal Estigarribia within 200 km of Argentina and Bolivia, and 300 km of Brazil, near an airport which could receive large planes (B-52, C-130 Hercules, etc.) which the Paraguan Air Forces do not have.US Marines put a foot in Paraguay, El Clar√≠n, September 9, 2005 In September 2009 Paraguay's President Fernando Lugo revoked plans for US troops to hold joint military exercises and development projects after stating that he no longer thinks that hosting troops taking part in the US department of defence's \\"New Horizons\\" programme was worthwhile. President Lugo referenced strong regional opposition from countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela, Bolivia and Ecuador to the expansion of US military bases in Colombia in his decision. Conflicts Paraguay Squadron (Harper's Weekly, New York City, October 16, 1858). In 1858, the Paraguay expedition was of gunboat diplomacy where the US sent a naval squadron to Paraguay to seek redress from Paraguay for the shelling of the USS Water Witch in 1855. It was quickly concluded after the force landed at Asunci√≥n on January 25, 1859, and followed by a Treaty of Amity and Commerce on February 4, 1859.

The relationship between the United States and the Philippines has historically been strong and has been described as a special relationship. The current Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte, however, is supportive of a foreign policy that is less dependent on the United States, favoring one that prioritizes closer relations with China and Russia, although the Philippines and the U.S. have a mutual defense treaty dating from 1951 and are actively working on implementation of an enhanced defense cooperation agreement concluded in 2014. The Philippines is one of the oldest Asian partners of the United States and a strategically major non-NATO ally.

Military agreements  The US Embassy in Manila. The Philippine Embassy in Washington, D.C.. President Elpidio Quirino with Harry S. Truman at the White House, 1951. = Bases era (1947‚Äì91) = A 1947 Military Bases Agreement gave the United States a 99-year lease on a number of Philippine military and naval bases in which U.S. authorities had virtual territorial rights. In August 1951, a mutual defense treaty (MDT) was signed between representatives of the Philippines and the United States. The overall accord contained eight articles and dictated that both nations would support each other if either the Philippines or the United States were to be attacked by an external party. An amendment to the bases agreement in 1966 reduced its 99-year term to 25 years. In 1979, after two years of negotiation, the bases agreement was renewed with some amendments. Pursuant to the bases agreement, the United States maintained and operated major facilities at Clark Air Base until November 1991, and at Subic Bay Naval Complex and several small subsidiary installations in the Philippines until November 1992. In July 1991, negotiators from the two countries reached agreement on a draft treaty providing for the clean-up and turn over of Clark to the Philippine government in 1992, and for the lease of Subic Bay Naval Base by the U.S. for ten years. By 1991, operations at Clark had already been scaled back because of the end of the Cold War, with the last combat aircraft leaving in 1990, before the base was heavily damaged by the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo. On September 16, 1991, the Philippine Senate rejected renewal of the bases agreement by a slim margin, and despite further efforts to salvage the situation, the two sides could not reach an agreement. As a result, the Philippine Government informed the U.S. on December 6, 1991, that it would have one year to complete withdrawal. That withdrawal went smoothly and was completed ahead of schedule, with the last U.S. forces departing on November 24, 1992. On departure, the U.S. Government turned over assets worth more than $1.3 billion to the Philippines, including an airport and ship-repair facility. Agencies formed by the Philippine Government have converted the former military bases for civilian commercial use, with Subic Bay serving as a flagship for that effort. The Philippine government on July 16, 2015 announced that it will revive a US- built deep-water naval base in Subic Bay The vote resulted in 11 senators in favor of extending the treaty, and 12 senators in favor of suppressing it. The list of senators who voted for the bases treaty are as follows: = Visiting Forces Agreement = The post-U.S. bases era has seen U.S.-Philippine relations improved and broadened, with a prominent focus on economic and commercial ties while maintaining the importance of the security dimension. U.S. investment continues to play an important role in the Philippine economy, while a strong security relationship rests on the Mutual Defense Treaty of 1951. In February 1998, U.S. and Philippine negotiators concluded the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA), paving the way for increased military cooperation under the MDT. The agreement was approved by the Philippine Senate in May 1999 and entered into force on June 1, 1999. Under the VFA, the U.S. has conducted ship visits to Philippine ports and has resumed large combined military exercises with Philippine forces. Key events in the bilateral relationship include the July 4, 1996 declaration by President Ramos of Philippine-American Friendship Day in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of Philippine independence. Ramos visited the U.S. in April 1998, and then-President Estrada visited in July 2000. President Arroyo met with President Bush in an official working visit in November 2001 and made a state visit in Washington on May 19, 2003. President Bush made a state visit to the Philippines on October 18, 2003, during which he addressed a joint session of the Philippine Congress‚Äîthe first American President to do so since Dwight D. Eisenhower. There are regular U.S. cabinet-level and congressional visits to the Philippines as well. President Arroyo repeatedly stressed the close friendship between the Philippines and the U.S. and her desire to expand bilateral ties further. Both governments tried to revitalize and strengthen their partnership by working toward greater security, prosperity, and service to Filipinos and Americans alike. Inaugurated into office on the same day as President Bush, President Arroyo lent strong support to the Global War on Terrorism. In October 2003, the U.S. designated the Philippines as a Major non-NATO ally. That same month, the Philippines joined the select group of countries to have ratified all 12 UN counterterrorism conventions. On February 7, 2020, President Rodrigo Duterte officially ordered the termination of the VFA as a response to an accumulation of a series of \\"disrespectful acts\\" by a few US senators directed against the sovereignty of the Republic of the Philippines. On February 11, 2020, the Philippine government officially notified the U.S. that it would be terminating the VFA. = Annual military exercises = Marines from the United States and the Philippines conducting a joint exercise. The annual Balikatan (Shoulder-to-Shoulder) bilateral military exercises contribute directly to the Philippine armed forces' efforts to root out Abu Sayyaf and Jemaah Islamiyah terrorists and bring development to formerly terrorist-plagued areas, notably Basilan and Jolo. They include not only combined military training but also civil-military affairs and humanitarian projects. The International Military Education and Training (IMET) program is the largest in the Pacific and the third-largest in the world, and a Mutual Logistics Support Agreement (MLSA) was signed in November 2002. Similarly, law enforcement cooperation has reached new levels: U.S. and Philippine agencies have cooperated to bring charges against numerous terrorists, to implement the countries' extradition treaty, and to train thousands of Filipino law enforcement officers. There is a Senior Law Enforcement Advisor helping the Philippine National Police with its Transformation Program. The U.S. works closely with the Philippines to reduce poverty and increase prosperity. The U.S. fully supports Philippine efforts to root out corruption, to open economic opportunity, and to invest in health and education. USAID programs support the 'Philippines' war on poverty as well as the government's reform agenda in critical areas, including anti- money laundering, rule of law, tax collection, and trade and investment. Other USAID programs have bolstered the government's efforts to heal divisions in Philippine society through a focus on conflict resolution, livelihood enhancement for former combatants, and economic development in Mindanao and the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, among the poorest areas in the country. Meanwhile, important programs continue in modern family planning, infectious disease control, environmental protection, rural electrification, and provision of basic services‚Äîas well as PL 480 food aid programs and others, which together totaled $211.3 million. In 2006, the Millennium Challenge Corporation granted $21 million to the Philippines for a threshold program addressing corruption in revenue administration. Nearly 400,000 Americans visit the Philippines each year. Providing government services to U.S. and other citizens, therefore, constitutes an important aspect of the bilateral relationship. Those services include veterans' affairs, social security, and consular operations. Benefits to Filipinos from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the Social Security Administration totaled $297,389,415 in 2006. Many people-to-people programs exist between the U.S. and the Philippines, including Fulbright, International Visitors, and Aquino Fellowship exchange programs, as well as the U.S. Peace Corps. =Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement= The Agreement on Enhanced Defense Cooperation is a ten-page document containing a preamble and 12 articles, that was signed on April 28, 2014. It is a framework agreement that raises the scope of the 1951 MDT. The Preamble to the EDCA refers to the obligations of the Philippines and the United States, under both the Charter of the United Nations and the MDT, to settle international disputes by peaceful means, not to endanger international peace and security, and to refrain from the threat or use of force ‚Äúin any manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.‚Äù Importantly, the Preamble notes that both parties ‚Äúshare an understanding for the United States not to establish a permanent military presence or base in the territory of the Philippines.‚Äù The Preamble later concludes, ‚Äúall United States access to and use of facilities and areas will be at the invitation of the Philippines and with full respect for the Philippines Constitution and Philippine laws.  Trade and investment  Filipino soldiers painting a US and Philippine flag. Two-way U.S. merchandise trade with the Philippines amounted to $17.3 billion in 2006 (U.S. Department of Commerce data). According to Philippine Government data, 16% of the Philippines' imports in 2006 came from the U.S., and about 18% of its exports were bound for America. The Philippines ranks as the 26th-largest export market and the 30th-largest supplier of the United States. Key exports to the U.S. are semiconductor devices and computer peripherals, automobile parts, electric machinery, textiles and garments, wheat and animal feeds, and coconut oil. In addition to other goods, the Philippines imports raw and semi- processed materials for the manufacture of semiconductors, electronics and electrical machinery, transport equipment, and cereals and cereal preparations. The U.S. traditionally has been the Philippines' largest foreign investor, with about $6.6 billion in estimated investment as of end-2005 (U.S. Department of Commerce data). Since the late 1980s, the Philippines has committed itself to reforms that encourage foreign investment as a basis for economic development, subject to certain guidelines and restrictions in specified areas. Under President Ramos, the Philippines expanded reforms, opening the power generation and telecommunications sectors to foreign investment, as well as securing ratification of the Uruguay Round agreement and membership in the World Trade Organization. As noted earlier, President Arroyo's administration has generally continued such reforms despite opposition from vested interests and \\"nationalist\\" blocs. A major obstacle has been and will continue to be constitutional restrictions on, among others, foreign ownership of land and public utilities, which limits maximum ownership to 40%. Over the last two decades, the relatively closed Philippine economy has been opened significantly by foreign exchange deregulation, foreign investment and banking liberalization, tariff and market barrier reduction, and foreign entry into the retail trade sector. The Electric Power Industry Reform Act of 2001 opened opportunities for U.S. firms to participate in the power industry in the Philippines. Information and communications technologies, backroom operations such as call centers, and regional facilities or shared-service centers are likewise leading investment opportunities. During the visit by President Benigno Aquino III to Washington DC, on July 7, 2012, the US-Philippine Society was launched. It is a non- profit independent organisation tasked for generating awareness about the Philippines in the US. The last board meeting was conducted by the society on January 24, 2013. In its 2013 Special 301 Report, the Office of the United States Trade Representatives wrote \\"The United States looks to the Philippines to take important steps to address piracy over the internet, in particular with respect to notorious online markets\\".2013 Special 301 Report, Office of the United States Trade Representative. It is speculated that pressure from the United States contributed to the complaint filed by Philippine Association of the Record Industry against the torrent website KickassTorrents, resulting in its seizure by Philippine authorities on June 13, 2013.

In 2012 the Philippines and the United States conducted joint military exercises. As of 2012, a U.S. military contingent of 600, including Navy Seals and Seabees are stationed \\"indefinitely\\" in the Southern Philippines, in a declared non-combatant role to assist the Armed Forces of the Philippines in operations against the al-Quaida-linked Abu Sayyaf terrorist group primarily on the island of Basilan in western Mindanao and the Sulu islands, in particular Jolo, a long-time stronghold of Abu Sayyaf. The Scarborough Shoal standoff with China and the ongoing Spratly islands dispute has caused the Philippines to consider stronger military ties with the United States. In 2012, a senior Philippine defense official said that as long as they have prior clearance from the Philippine government, American troops, warships and aircraft could once again use their former naval and air facilities of Subic Bay Naval Base and Clark Air Base.US troops can use Clark, Subic bases, Philippine Star, June 6, 2012. In 2013, Foreign Secretary, Albert del Rosario clarified that, due to constitutional constraints, establishment of a US military facility could only be allowed if it would be under the control of the Philippine military.\\"Welcome more US troops‚ÄìDel Rosario.\\", Philippine Daily Inquirer, April 14, 2013. The deal will reportedly include shared access to Philippines military but not civilian facilities. During a 2013 visit to the Philippines, Defense Secretary, Ashton Carter said that the main security issues that the USA was working with the Philippines were: * Maritime domain awareness, * building up the capacities of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, * and counter terrorism. In April 2014, a ten-year pact (EDCA ‚Äì Enhanced Defence Co-operation Agreement) was signed between the U.S. President, Barack Obama and the Philippine President, Benigno Aquino III, allowing United States to increase military presence in the Philippines. The Joint US Military Assistance Group (JUSMAG) handed over weapons to the Philippine Marine Corps. The equipment includes 300 M4 carbines, 200 Glock 21 pistols, 4 M134D Gatling-style machine guns, and 100 M203 grenade launchers, the US embassy in Manila said in a 5 June statement. The JUSMAG also delivered 25 new Combat Rubber Raiding Craft with outboard motors to PMC headquarters in Taguig, where PMC commandant Major General Emmanuel Salamat formally accepted delivery of the weapons during a transfer ceremony on 5 June. The equipment was delivered amidst the Marawi Crisis. In February 2019, US Secretary of State Pompeo affirmed US commitments under the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT) during a meeting with counterparts in the Philippines. Pompeo in a speech added, \\"as the South China Sea is part of the Pacific, any armed attack on Philippine forces, aircraft or public vessels will trigger mutual defense obligations\\". The US assured that they will \\"back the Philippines\\" if confrontation between the Philippines and China occurs in the South China Sea. The move came after years of American reluctance to affirm commitments, which led to numerous Filipino politicians to push for review of the 68-year-old security pact between the Philippines and the US. The Filipino foreign affairs secretary welcomed the US commitment, adding that there is \\"no need to review\\" the pact anymore.  Diplomatic relations  The U.S. maintains an embassy in Manila and a consulate in Cebu. The American Business Center, which houses the Foreign Commercial Service and the Foreign Agricultural Service, is located in Makati City. The Philippine government maintains an embassy in Washington, D.C. as well as several consulates throughout the United States.

It occurs in two basic color morphs which are called green scat and ruby or red scat. This fish is generally distributed around the Indo-Pacific region, to Japan, New Guinea, and southeastern Australia. They live in coastal muddy areas, including estuaries, mangroves, harbours, and the lower courses of rivers. They are popular aquarium fish. Description The body is strongly compressed. The dorsal head profile is steep, with a rounded snout. The body is greenish-brown to silvery with many brown to red-brown spots. Spines and rays of the dorsal fin are separated by a deep notch. Small ctenoid scales cover the body. Juveniles are a greenish-brown with either a few large, dark, rounded blotches, or five or six dark, vertical bars. Since S. argus can live in embayment regions, as well as quite far upstream in freshwater rivers, they can adapt to varying salinities. As fry, they live in freshwater environments, but as they mature, they move to saltwater environments. They do not live in temperate waters, as they require at least a little warmth (21 to 28 ¬∞C). The common scat is omnivorous and an indiscriminate eater. In 1992, biologists Barry and Fast reported adult scat from the Philippines were primarily herbivorous, while the juveniles preferred zooplankton. Although scat were named for their purported habit of feeding on offal (Scatophagus argus is translated from Greek to \\"spotted feces-eater\\"), it may be a misnomer as this behaviour has not been confirmed in diet studies. As a food source Scatophagus argus is fished for and eaten by some people from its original environment, and can sting with small spikes in its anterior parts, inflicting a venom that causes great pain and dizziness. Treatment of the wound is often done by soaking the infliction in hot water. Parasites The Acanthocephala Pararhadinorhynchus magnus As most fish, the common scat harbours parasites. The Acanthocephala Pararhadinorhynchus magnus has been described from the intestine of this fish in waters off Vietnam.

According to the 2012 U.S. Global Leadership Report, 36% of Portuguese people approve of U.S. leadership, with 12% disapproving and 52% uncertain.U.S. Global Leadership Project Report - 2012 Gallup  History  Despite various attempts to set up colonies in Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia, the Kingdom of Portugal never held any long-lasting or significant colonies in North America due to the 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas, which stipulated that the Portuguese were only allowed to set up colonies in the Old World (aside from Brazil, which the treaty failed to account for), leaving the New World open to Spanish colonization. Despite the lack of colonies, a small amount of Portuguese individuals did settle in North America prior to the 19th century. Unlike other European colonial powers such as France and Spain, Portugal did not intervene on behalf of the United States during the American Revolutionary War. This was because of the aforementioned lack of Portuguese colonies in North America and also because of the historic alliance between Portugal and Britain, dating back to the 14th century. Portugal remained neutral throughout the conflict, eventually joining the First League of Armed Neutrality, a league of European states organized by Catherine the Great of Russia to protect neutral shipping, which was often interrupted and seized by the Royal Navy during the war. While the Portuguese military did not participate in the war, some of the aforementioned Portguese settlers in the Thirteen Colonies did fight, such as the ‚ÄúVirginia Giant‚Äù Peter Francisco, a soldier of the Continental Army who was born in the Azores. In 1791, Portugal became the first neutral nation to establish diplomatic ties with the United States, leading to the arrival of an American legation headed by David Humphreys in Lisbon. Consular relations with the Portuguese island territories of Madeira and the Azores were established in 1790 and 1795 respectively. When the Portuguese court fled to Brazil during the Napoleonic Wars, the American legation followed the court to Rio de Janeiro in 1810 and returned with it to Lisbon in 1822. The U.S. and Portugal fought together in the First Barbary War (1801-1805) against the Barbary corsairs in an effort to reduce piracy and disruption of trade on the Mediterranean Sea. Increased Portuguese immigration to the United States began in the early nineteenth century. Approximately 70 percent of these immigrants came from the Azores, with the remainder mostly coming from Madeira and Cape Verde, with very few of them coming from the Portuguese mainland. Most of these Portuguese immigrants settled in New England and ended up working in the whaling industry. The involvement of Portuguese immigrants in the whaling trade also led Portuguese American communities to spring up in the San Francisco Bay Area in California and in Hawaii. Some Portuguese immigrants settled in cities further inland, such as Springfield, Illinois. Today, there are over one million Americans of Portuguese descent. While prolific in some areas, Portuguese immigration was comparatively tiny when compared with the large number of German and Irish immigrants that came to the United States. The Portuguese government favored the Union during the American Civil War, providing assistance to the Union Navy during the conflict. Due to settling primarily in New England, most Portuguese Americans were Union soldiers. In 1911, the United States declared its support of the 5 October 1910 revolution that abolished the Portuguese Monarchy and replaced it with the First Portuguese Republic. In 1917, both Portugal and the United States joined World War I on the side of the Allies. During World War II, Portugal remained neutral until 1944, when it allowed the United States to establish a military base in the Azores. Both countries remained on the same side during the Cold War, with both Portugal and the United States becoming founding members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1949. The harmonious relationship between Portugal and the United States was strained during the 1960s and 70s. Amid a wider global trend of decolonization, the Portuguese colonies of Angola, Mozambique, and Guinea-Bissau, all in Africa, began to demand independence from Portugal. The strain in relations was caused by the United States declaring their support for these independence movements, a move which greatly angered the Portuguese government. Following the Portuguese Colonial War, Angola, Mozambique, and Guinea-Bissau all gained independence. The revolution brought down the dictatorial Estado Novo regime that had ruled over Portugal since 1933, beginning the country‚Äôs peaceful transition towards democracy and allowing Portuguese-U.S. relations to be repaired. Since the Carnation Revolution and the end of the Cold War, Portugal and the United States have remained close allies, fighting together in the NATO intervention in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the NATO intervention in Kosovo, the Iraq War, and the War in Afghanistan.  Overview  The defense relationship between the United States and Portugal is centered on the 1995 Agreement on Cooperation and Defense (ACD). For 50 years, Lajes Field in the Azores has played an important role in supporting U.S. military aircraft (its importance such that the US had a contingency plan in 1975 to stimulate Azores independence in the event of a Communist takeover of PortugalAgence France Presse, Raw Story, 19 November 2010, US had plans to ‚Äòtake over‚Äô Azores in 1975). Most recent missions are engaged in counter- terrorism and humanitarian efforts, including operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. Portugal also provides the United States access to Montijo Air Base and a number of ports. Portugal defines itself as \\"Atlanticist\\" emphasizing its support for strong European ties with the United States, particularly on defense and security issues. The Government of Portugal has been a key ally in US, supporting efforts in Iraq, and hosting the Azores Summit that preceded military action. The United States exported $1.47 billion worth of goods in 2006 and imported an estimated $3.04 billion. While total Portuguese trade has increased dramatically over the last 10 years, the U.S. percentage of Portugal's exports and imports has declined. The Government of Portugal is encouraging greater bilateral investment. US firms play some significant roles in the pharmaceutical, computer, and retail sectors in Portugal, particularly in Lisbon, but their involvement in the automotive sector has sharply declined in recent years.

F. Akyildiz, D. Pompili, and T. Melodia, \\"Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks: Research Challenges,\\" Ad Hoc Networks (Elsevier), vol. 3, no. 3, pp. 257-279, March 2005. There are several ways of employing such communication but the most common is by using hydrophones. Underwater communication is difficult due to factors such as multi-path propagation, time variations of the channel, small available bandwidth and strong signal attenuation, especially over long ranges. Compared to terrestrial communication, underwater communication has low data rates because it uses acoustic waves instead of electromagnetic waves. At the beginning of the 20th century some ships communicated by underwater bells as well as using the system for navigation. Submarine signals were at the time competitive with the primitive Maritime radionavigation service. The later Fessenden oscillator allowed communication with submarines.  Types of modulation used for underwater acoustic communications  In general the modulation methods developed for radio communications can be adapted for underwater acoustic communications (UAC). However some of the modulation schemes are more suited to the unique underwater acoustic communication channel than others. Some of the modulation methods used for UAC are as follows: * Frequency shift keying (FSK) * Phase shift keying (PSK) * Frequency hopped spread spectrum (FHSS) * Direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) * Frequency and pulse-position modulation (FPPM and PPM) * Multiple frequency shift keying (MFSK) * Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) The following is a discussion on the different types of modulation and their utility to UAC. = Frequency shift keying = FSK is the earliest form of modulation used for acoustic modems. UAC prior to modems was by percussion of different objects underwater. This method was also used to measure the speed of sound in water. FSK usually employs two distinct frequencies to modulate data; for example, Frequency F1 to indicate bit 0 and frequency F2 to indicate bit 1. Hence a binary string can be transmitted by alternating these two frequencies depending on whether it is a 0 or 1. The receiver can be as simple as having analogue matched filters to the two frequencies and a level detector to decide if a 1 or 0 was received. This is a relatively easy form of modulation and therefore used in the earliest acoustic modems. However more sophisticated Demodulator using Digital Signal Processors (DSP) can be used in the present day. The biggest challenge FSK faces in the UAC is multi-path reflections. With multi-path (particularly in UAC) several strong reflections can be present at the receiving hydrophone and the threshold detectors become confused, thus severely limiting the use of this type of UAC to vertical channels. Adaptive equalization methods have been tried with limited success. Adaptive equalization tries to model the highly reflective UAC channel and subtract the effects from the received signal. The success has been limited due to the rapidly varying conditions and the difficulty to adapt in time. = Phase shift keying = Phase-shift keying (PSK) is a digital modulation scheme that conveys data by changing (modulating) the phase of a reference signal (the carrier wave). The signal is impressed into the magnetic field x,y area by varying the sine and cosine inputs at a precise time. It is widely used for wireless LANs, RFID and Bluetooth communication. Any digital modulation scheme uses a finite number of distinct signals to represent digital data. PSK uses a finite number of phases, each assigned a unique pattern of binary digits. Usually, each phase encodes an equal number of bits. Each pattern of bits forms the symbol that is represented by the particular phase. The demodulator, which is designed specifically for the symbol-set used by the modulator, determines the phase of the received signal and maps it back to the symbol it represents, thus recovering the original data. This requires the receiver to be able to compare the phase of the received signal to a reference signal ‚Äî such a system is termed coherent (and referred to as CPSK). Alternatively, instead of operating with respect to a constant reference wave, the broadcast can operate with respect to itself. Changes in phase of a single broadcast waveform can be considered the significant items. In this system, the demodulator determines the changes in the phase of the received signal rather than the phase (relative to a reference wave) itself. Since this scheme depends on the difference between successive phases, it is termed differential phase-shift keying (DPSK). DPSK can be significantly simpler to implement than ordinary PSK since there is no need for the demodulator to have a copy of the reference signal to determine the exact phase of the received signal (it is a non-coherent scheme). In exchange, it produces more erroneous demodulation. = Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing = Orthogonal frequency- division multiplexing (OFDM) is a digital multi-carrier modulation scheme. OFDM conveys data on several parallel data channels by incorporating closely spaced orthogonal sub-carrier signals. OFDM is a favorable communication scheme in underwater acoustic communications thanks to its resilience against frequency selective channels with long delay spreads.E. Demirors, G. Sklivanitis, T.

Voice or an audio tone (morse code) communicated through the UQC are heterodyned to a high pitch for acoustic transmission through water. = JANUS = In April 2017, NATO's Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation announced the approval of JANUS, a standardized protocol to transmit digital information underwater using acoustic sound (like modems and fax machines do over telephone lines). Documented in STANAG 4748, it uses 900Hz to 60kHz frequencies at distances of up to . It is available for use with military and civilian, NATO and non-NATO devices; it was named after the Roman god of gateways, openings, etc. The JANUS specification (ANEP-87) provides for a flexible plug-in-based payload scheme. This enables multiple different applications such as Emergency location, Underwater AIS, and Chat.

Qatar and the United States are strategic allies.  History  The United States formed diplomatic relations with Qatar on 19 March 1972, when diplomat William Stoltzfus met with Qatari government officials and submitted his credentials. Bilateral relations between the two countries has expanded in since the opening of the U.S. embassy in Doha in March 1973. The first resident U.S. ambassador arrived in July 1974. Qatar and the United States coordinate closely on Middle Eastern regional diplomatic initiatives to increase security in the Persian Gulf. The two countries also have extensive economic links, especially in the hydrocarbons sector. Qatar has also developed international educational institutions in the region to cater to the Middle Eastern market. Qatar also hosts an American military facility. United States President Donald Trump with the Emir of Qatar Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, May 2017 During the 2017 Qatar diplomatic crisis, the United States President Donald Trump claimed credit for engineering the diplomatic crisis in a series of tweets. On 6 June, Trump began by tweeting: \\"During my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology. Leaders pointed to Qatar ‚Äì look!\\" An hour and a half later, he remarked on Twitter that it was \\"good to see the Saudi Arabia visit with the King and 50 countries already paying off. They said they would take a hard line on funding extremism, and all reference [sic] was pointing to Qatar. Perhaps this will be the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism!\\" This was in contrast to attempts by The Pentagon and State department to remain neutral. The Pentagon praised Qatar for hosting the Al Udeid Air Base and for its \\"enduring commitment to regional security.\\" U.S. Ambassador to Qatar, Dana Shell Smith, sent a similar message. Earlier, the US Secretary of State had taken a neutral stance and called for dialogue. Qatar hosts about 10,000 U.S. troops at Al Udeid Air Base, which houses the forward operating base of United States Central Command that plays a commanding role in US airstrikes in Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan. A Pentagon spokesperson claimed the diplomatic crisis would not affect the US military posture in Qatar. On 8 June, President Donald Trump, during a phone call with the Emir of Qatar Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, offered as a mediator in the conflict with a White House meeting between the parties if necessary. The offer was declined, and Qatari official stated, \\"The emir has no plans to leave Qatar while the country is under a blockade.\\" On 9 June, Trump once put the blame on Qatar, calling the blockade \\"hard but necessary\\" while claiming that Qatar had been funding terrorism at a \\"very high level\\" and described the country as having an \\"extremist ideology in terms of funding\\". This statement was in conflict with Secretary of State Tillerson's comments on the same day, which called on Gulf states to ease up the blockade. On 30 January 2018 an inaugural United States-Qatar Strategic Dialogue meeting was held, co-chaired by U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, Qatari Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of State for Defense Khalid al-Attiyah and Qatari Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani. The meeting expressed the need for an immediate resolution of the crisis which respects Qatar‚Äôs sovereignty. In a Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation the U.S. expressed its readiness to deter and confront any external threat to Qatar‚Äôs territorial integrity. Qatar offered to help fund the expansion of facilities at U.S. bases in Qatar. Educational ties Hundreds of Qatari students study in the United States. Six U.S. universities have branch campuses in Qatar's Education City complex. There are Virginia Commonwealth University School of the Arts in Qatar (VCUQ), Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar (WCMC-Q), Texas A&M; University at Qatar (TAMUQ), Carnegie Mellon University in Qatar (CMU-Q), Georgetown University School of Foreign Service in Qatar (SFS-Qatar),School of Foreign Service in Qatar: Georgetown University and Northwestern University in 2008.

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visited Qatar in February, 2010, and Secretary John Kerry traveled to Qatar in March, 2013. Post Sheikh Tamim and Donald Trump‚Äôs meeting in July 2019, Qatar agreed to purchase \\"tremendous amounts of military equipment\\" and Boeing planes from the United States. The deal has been signed with some of the major US companies, including Boeing, General Electric, Raytheon, Gulfstream Aerospace and Chevron Phillips Chemical and is expected to cost tens of billions of dollars.

In 2014, the United States sold $11 billion worth of arms to Qatar, including AH-64 Apache attack helicopters and Patriot and Javelin defense systems. In June 2017, Qatar signed a $12 billion deal to buy 36 F-15QA strike aircraft from the United States, with Boeing as the prime contractor on the sale. Disaster aid Qatar donated $100 million in aid to New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina ravaged the Gulf Coast in August 2005.

Majority of the Kamwe people despise the derogatory name 'higgi' except some few people in Dakwa(Bazza) area who are originally of Margi origin. Because grasshopper from which the derogatory word \\"higi/higgi is derived is a hopeless insect in Kamwe culture eaten by lizards and frogs because they are weak and vulnerable Kamwe is a compound word derived from the words \\"Ka\\" and \\"Mwe\\" Which means \\"People of\\". Kamwe stands for people of the same consanguinity and affinity. It means family kindred. Relatives bound together. It derived its meaning from a special type of native Kamwe ornament worn by close relatives of a deceased person.Kwache,Iliya Yame (2016).Kamwe People of Northern Nigeria: Origin,History and Culture. Prudent Press Kaduna. Elders say that in the past, if a non-relative the decease wears the Mwe, it leads to conflict with the real relatives. Only close relatives are allowed to wear the Mwe among the Kamwe were not allowed to were the Mwe. Because the \\"Mwe\\" is the true identity of close relatives and cements the bond between them. Some elders still think it means people of the heavens, people on the hills, mountains and even the sky in Vecemwe. There are more than 24 dialects of Vecemwe(Kamwe language) but Nkafa is the central dialect and is reduced into writing and literature. The Margi first called the Kamwe people \\"Higi\\" in 1937.Tribal Studies in Northern Nigeria. C.K Meek 1931 In Nigeria about 80 percent of Kamwe are found in Michika Local Government Area of Adamawa State, Nigeria. A substantial number of them are also found in the local government areas of Mubi North, Hong, Gombi, Song and Madagali in Adamawa State. The Kamwe people are also found in Borno State, especially in Askira/Uba and Gwoza local government areas. Blench (2019) lists Mukta of Mukta village, Adamawa State as part of the Kamwe cluster.

Most Kamwe identify themselves with Mwe-ci-ka (Michika), the ancestral home of all Kamwe people. The name Mwecika(Michika) is a Nkafa phrase which means creeping in silently to hunt. Depicting how Kwada Kwakaa the warrior was moving stealthily on the Michika hills to hunt his games. Kamwe literally means people of the same \\"consanguinity and affinity\\". The Kamwe people believe in a heavenly God called 'Hyalatamwe' Communication with Hyalatamwe directly is not possible in Kamwe culture. Hyalatamwe is revered and feared. Communication with him has to be through intermediaries called \\"Da melie or Tchehye shwa\\" In the Kamwe culture, caste system does exist as the Kamwe race is broadly classified into 'Melie and Ka-Ligyi'. The founder of Michika (Mwe-ci-ka) was said to be one Kwada Kwakaa, a prince from Kuli in Nkafamiya on the hills of Michika. Kwada Kwakaa was said to be a warrior hunter who could hunt lions and leopards just by himself. When his father, who was the King in Nkafamiya, got to know that Kwada was 'kwa' 'kaa', he mandated Kwada to be the ruler in the present day Michika. What is unique about the Kamwe people's culture is the way the name their children according to the child's birth from the mother. A first-born male child is named Tizhe, a first-born female child Kuve. The first ten children in Kamwe culture are named as follows:- First male child is Tizhe, the female child is Kuve. The second male child is Zira, the female is Masi. The third male child is Tumba, the female is Kwarramba, the fourth male child is Vandi, the female is Kwanye. The fifth child is Kwaji whether male or female. The sixth child is Tari for male and Kwata for female. The seventh child is sini for male and Kwasini for female. The eight child is Kwada for both male and Female. The ninth child is Drambi for both the male and female. The tenth child is called Kwatri for both the male and female child. Subsequently, any other child will have a suffix \\"hale\\" attached to the name signifying that the child was born in old age of the mother. Example is Kuve-hale or Zira-hale as the case may be. Twins or multiple births are celebrated in Kamwe culture. Twins have special names depending on the gender and who is delivered first. First male twin is called Thakma, the second male twin is Pembi. First female twin is Thakma, second female twin is Kwalgha Before the advent of Western legal system in Africa and especially Nigeria, the Kamwe People had an organised legal system of the King called \\"Mbege\\" as the sole adjudicator.

Alexander Hamilton, an important leader in the founding of the United States, was born in Charlestown, Nevis. The United States seeks to help St. Kitts and Nevis develop economically and to help strengthen its moderate, democratic, parliamentary form of government. St. Kitts and Nevis is a beneficiary of the U.S. Caribbean Basin Initiative. U.S. assistance is primarily channeled through multilateral agencies such as the World Bank and the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB), as well as the USAID office in Bridgetown, Barbados. In addition, St. Kitts and Nevis benefits from U.S. military exercises and humanitarian civic action construction projects. St. Kitts and Nevis is strategically placed in the Leeward Islands, near maritime transport lanes of major importance to the United States. St. Kitts and Nevis' location close to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands makes the two-island federation attractive to narcotics traffickers. To counter this threat, the Government of St. Kitts and Nevis cooperates with the United States in the fight against illegal narcotics. In 1995, the Government signed a maritime law enforcement treaty with the United States, later amended with an overflight/order-to-land amendment in 1996. St. Kitts and Nevis also signed an updated extradition treaty with the United States in 1996, and a mutual legal assistance treaty in 1997.

It was part of the territory conquered from the Ottoman Empire during the Italo-Turkish War of 1911,Italian Benghazi alongside Italian Tripolitania. The territory of the two colonies was sometimes referred to as \\"Italian Libya\\" or Italian North Africa (Africa Settentrionale Italiana, or ASI). Both names were also used after their unification, with Italian Libya becoming the official name of the newly combined colony. In 1923, indigenous rebels associated with the Senussi Order organized the Libyan resistance movement against Italian settlement in Libya. The rebellion was put down by Italian forces in 1932, after the so-called \\"pacification campaign\\", which resulted in the deaths of a quarter of Cyrenaica's local population. In 1934, it became part of Italian Libya. History Stamp of Italian Cyrenaica The Palazzo Littorio, later called the \\"Parliament of Cyrenaica\\", built in 1927 Italian Cyrenaica and Italian Tripolitania were formed in 1911, during the conquest of Ottoman Tripolitania in the Italo-Turkish War. In the 1920s, Cyrenaica was the scene of fighting between Italian colonial forces and Libyan rebels who were fighting for independence from colonial rule. In 1931, the rebel independence leader Omar Mukhtar was captured and executed. Fascist Italy maintained several concentration camps in Eastern Libya during the first phase of its occupation of that country. The colonial administration began in 1929 the nearly wholesale deportation of the people of the Jebel Akhdar to deny the rebels the support of the local population. Ten thousand inmates were kept at the concentration camp in El Agheila. The forced migration of more than 100,000 people ended in concentration camps in Suluq, El Magrun, Abyar and El Agheila where tens of thousands died in squalid conditions, mainly because of epidemics like the Spanish flu. The concentration camps were dismantled after 1934 when the fascist regime obtained full control of the area and started a policy of assimilation of the local Arab community. This policy was so successful that in 1940 there were two colonial military divisions of Arab Libyans. In the late 1930s, Cyrenaica was populated by more than 20,000 Italian colonists, mainly around the coast. As a consequence, there was a large economic development effort in the second half of the 1930s. Italy carried out massive investment in the infrastructure of Libya (the purpose was to develop the economy for the benefit of Greater Italy).General History of Africa, Albert Adu Boahen,Unesco. International Scientific Committee for the Drafting of a General History of Africa, page 196, 1990 In Benghazi were created -for the first time in Cyrenaica's History- the first manufacturing installations: some industries were created in 'Bengasi italiana' in the early 1930s, that included salt processing, oil refining, food processing, cement manufacturing, tanning, brewing and sponge and tuna fishing. The port of Benghazi was enlarged and nearby was created a modern Hospital. Also a new airport was built. In 1934, Italian Cyrenaica and Italian Tripolitania became part of Italian Libya. Demography In the late 1930s, Cyrenaica was populated by more than 20,000 Italian colonists, mainly around the coast. As a consequence, there was a large economic development effort in the second half of the 1930s. Initially the Italian aim was to drive the local population to the marginal land in the interior and to resettle the Italian population in the most fertile lands of Libya, but since 1938 the new governor Italo Balbo changed this policy in order to get the approval from the native population However the Italians did not provide the Libyans with adequate education until Balbo: the Italian population (about 15% of the total population) had 81 elementary schools in 1938, while the Libyans (more than 75% of total population) had 97. In Cirenaica were founded -for the Italian colonists- the rural villages of Baracca, Maddalena, Oberdan, D‚ÄôAnnunzio and Battisti in 1938, successively Mameli and Filzi in 1939. For Libyan families (who contributed with many soldiers enrolled in the two Italian-Libyan Divisions: The 1st Libyan Division Sibelle and 2nd Libyan Division Pescatori) were created in Cyrenaica in the villages of Gedida-Nuova, Nahida-Risorta, Zahra- Fiorita and el-Fager-Alba. Panorama of Italian Benghazi with the Catholic Cathedral connected to the Via Vittoria and the two columns featuring the Lion of Venice and the Capitoline Wolf Infrastructure Benghazi railway station in 1930 The Italians implemented major infrastructure projects in Italian Cyrenaica, mainly in the 1930s; the most important were the coastal road between Tripoli and Benghazi, the railways Benghazi-Barce and Benghazi-Soluch, and the enlargement of the Port of Benghazi. A group of villages with all the needed communications (and infrastructures) for Italians and Libyans were established in coastal Cyrenaica during the 1930s.

Biography West was the fifth son of Henry Thomas West and Susan Cox West. He was educated in public and private schools in Sussex County and matriculated in the college preparatory course at the Suffolk Collegiate Institute in Suffolk, Virginia. He attended college at the University of North Carolina and studied law at both Washington and Lee University and the University of Virginia. Upon completion of his formal education he returned to Waverly, Virginia and became Superintendent of Sussex County Schools in 1889. As superintendent, West suggested innovations that would improve the system in Sussex; a nine-month school term, better qualified teachers with increased pay, better schoolhouses and furniture, and a reasonable compensation to trustees for their services. While residing in Waverly, West formed an insurance business with a brother, John West. Two years later he decided to seek greater opportunities in the insurance field in Suffolk, Virginia, where he joined the firm of Col. L. P. Harper. West soon became the junior partner in the firm of Harper and West. Upon the death of Harper in 1906 the firm became West and Withers, with Mr. J. T. Withers as junior partner. On January 17, 1903, West married Margaret Olive Beale, a daughter of Rev. and Mrs. Edwin W. Beale of Suffolk. Soon after their marriage they purchased the residence then located at the east corner of West Washington Street and St. James Avenue where they lived for the remainder of his life. The Wests had one child, a daughter, Margaret Beale, who was born in 1909. West devoted much of his life to public service. He became active in local politics and was elected to Suffolk City Council and served as President of that body in 1896. Claude A. Swanson, who served as Governor of Virginia from 1906 to 1910, named West to his staff and bestowed upon him the title of colonel by which he was known for the remainder of his life. In 1910 West was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates and in 1912 to the Virginia State Senate, where he served for ten years. West became a leader in the Democratic Party at the state level. During his career West served on the Democratic State Central Committee and its Executive Committee as well as on several local Democratic Executive Committees. He was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1896 and in 1936. In 1922 and again in 1926 West was elected Lieutenant Governor of Virginia, serving during the terms of Governors E. Lee Trinkle and Harry Flood Byrd. During West's first term in office, Governor Trinkle appointed West's brother, Judge Jesse F. West of Sussex County, to a seat on the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals. At his second inaugural ceremony in 1926, Judge West administered the oath of office to his brother, Junius West. During the years in which West served as Lieutenant Governor, Richard L. Brewer, Jr. of Suffolk served as Speaker of the House of Delegates (from 1920 to 1926) and a third Suffolk citizen, Robert Riddick Prentis, served as Chief Justice of the State Supreme Court of Appeals (from 1925 to 1931). It has been said that \\"[t]he spotlight that played simultaneously on these three men during an important transition period in the state's history made Suffolk, for a time, a kind of \\"little capital\\" of Virginia and conferred upon [the three men] ... the unofficial title of \\"Suffolk's Big Three\\". West was always active in civic affairs. In the early 20th century West was, for a time, an owner and publisher of the Suffolk Herald, a forerunner of the Suffolk News Herald. He was a charter member of the Suffolk Rotary Club and served as its president in 1924. West served as a director of the Retail Merchants Association and as a director and president of the Suffolk Chamber of Commerce. He was also on the board of directors of the State Chamber of Commerce. West was a Mason, serving as the Master of Lodge 30 in Suffolk in 1901. He was a member of the Sons of the American Revolution, a Shriner, a Knight Templar, a Pythian, an Elk, an Odd Fellow, a member of the Junior Order of American Mechanics, a member of the Laurel Country Club of Suffolk and of the Westmoreland Club of Richmond. Too old to enter military service in World War I, he served as the Chairman of the United War Work Campaign in Suffolk and Nansemond County. West was a very active layman in the Suffolk Christian Church, chairing many committees, and serving on the Board of Deacons and the Board of Trustees. During the 1890s he organized a Sunday School Class which became the Philathea Class in 1913 and which he taught until his death in 1947. On April 17, 1950, the Young Ladies Bible Class and Senior Philathea Class became one and that class was renamed \\"The West Memorial Bible Class\\". On Sunday, September 17, 1950, a memorial service was held in the classroom at which time a portrait of West was presented to the class. West was Chairman of the Mission Board of the Southern Convention of the Christian Church and served on the Board of Trustees of Elon College for nearly half a century. His interest in education also lead to his appointment to the Board of Trustees of what is now Longwood College. In recognition of his achievements West was selected for inclusion in a number of editions of Who's Who in America. Upon his retirement from political service in Richmond in 1930, the Norfolk Virginian-Pilot wrote: \\"Those who will miss him most are his associates in the Senate, men who day by day have been impressed with his fairness as a presiding officer, his uniform courtesy and his innate kindliness\\". On January 27, 1932, in the State Senate Chamber in Richmond, West was honored with a formal dedication of his portrait. Senator E. E. Holland, of Suffolk, made the formal presentation citing the high esteem in which West was held in Suffolk: \\"I can attest that in Suffolk he is considered a model citizen and is a leader in all religious, civic, social and political activities. He has been eminently successful, progressive yet conservative, and is always alert and ready to strive for the best interests of Virginia and her citizens\\". The portrait hangs in the Virginia State Capitol to this day. West died on January 1, 1947, in a Richmond hospital where he was being treated for cancer. Louis Jaffe, the Pulitzer Prize-winning editor of the Norfolk Virginian Pilot, described West as a \\"conspicuous member of the General Assembly [who] ... in many ways as an almost ideal legislator ... No inconsiderable part of the most valuable legislation of that transitional period of Virginia history bore his name.\\" West drew the praise of several who had served as Governor of the Commonwealth. Harry Byrd described him as \\"an indefatigable worker ... [who] had a grasp of public matters such as few men of my acquaintance possessed ... [I]t can be very truthfully said of him that his labors in the public service of Virginia was outstanding\\". Colgate Darden wrote that West \\"has participated in every phase of civic life looking to the betterment of the State ... and through his efforts ... the people of Virginia have been enriched and encouraged\\". William M. Tuck described West \\"as one of Virginia's leading citizens\\" who \\"as a citizen and as an official ... contributed much that is of value to the life of our Commonwealth.\\" West was buried in Cedar Hill Cemetery in Suffolk on January 3, 1947.

United States of America) ICJ 4) is a public international law case decided by the International Court of Justice in 2003. Facts Three Iranian offshore oil platforms and a United States Navy warship, , were destroyed when the ship struck a mine in international waters near Bahrain. The basis of the Court's jurisdiction was a bilateral commercial agreement between Iran and the United States: the Treaty of Amity, Economic Relations and Consular Rights (United States‚ÄìIran). Judgments On December 12, 1996, the Court rejected the U.S. preliminary objection to the Court's jurisdiction, by a vote of fourteen to two. The two dissenters were Vice President Schwebel (nationality: U.S.) and Judge Oda (Japan), each of whom wrote dissenting opinions. Among the majority, separate opinions were appended by Judges Shahabuddeen (Guyana), Ranjeva (Madagascar), Higgins (U.K.), and Parra-Aranguren (Venezuela), and Judge ad hoc Rigaux (Belgium, appointed by Iran). On March 10, 1998, the Court held that the U.S. counter-claim against Iran, for mining and other attacks on U.S. shipping, was admissible. Oral arguments were held between February 17 and March 7, 2003. On November 6, 2003, 11 years after the initial application was submitted by Iran, the ICJ rejected the claims of both states. The court found (1) by a vote of 14-2 (dissenting Judges Al-Khasawneh (Jordan), Elaraby (Egypt)) that the U.S. actions against Iranian oil platforms in 1987 and 1988 do not meet the treaty's essential security exception but that they did not breach the treaty's freedom of commerce provision and so Iran's claim against the U.S. could not be upheld, and (2) by a vote of 15-1 (dissenting Judge Simma (Germany)) that the U.S. counter-claim against Iran could not be upheld. (Paragraph 125 of the Decision.) Eleven judges attached declarations or separate opinions.

Benson's quartet was modeled after Jack McDuff's--with baritone saxophonist Ronnie Cuber, organist Lonnie Smith, a powerhouse player who deserved more attention than he ever received, and Jimmy Lovelace or Marion Booker on drums. The sonorous tone of Cuber's baritone gives the quartet a richer, more dense texture than that obtained by McDuff, who used a tenor, but the overall sound is the same. At twenty-five, Ronnie Cuber was an alumnus of Marshall Brown's celebrated Newport Youth Band; he had spent the previous two years with Maynard Ferguson's very loud and brassy orchestra, which may account for his aggressive style, but Cuber's approach also emphasized rhythm, and that was precisely the ingredient called for by a \\"soul jazz\\" group of this kind.\\"The Hardbop Homepage: The George Benson Cookbook Track listing All tracks composed by George Benson; except where indicated =2007 remastered CD / Blu-spec CD bonus tracks= Personnel *George Benson ‚Äì guitar, vocals =The George Benson Quartet= *Ronnie Cuber ‚Äì baritone saxophone *Bennie Green ‚Äì trombone *Lonnie Smith ‚Äì organ *Albert Winston ‚Äì bass *Paul_H._Brown - Bass uncredited on album *Jimmy Lovelace ‚Äì drums *Marion Booker, Jr. ‚Äì drums References George Benson albums 1967 albums Columbia Records albums Albums produced by John Hammond (producer) ","title":"The George Benson Cookbook"},{"id":"15994572","text":"Suncity Records is an Australian record label that specialized in releasing melodic rock and hard rock CDs.

The firm was founded in 2006 and launched their first release to a public beta in 2008. LiquidPlanner is a platform-independent, online project management system which features ranged estimates (e.g. 3‚Äì5 days) to express the uncertainty in project schedules. This collaborative software is accessible via modern web browsers and mobile applications for iPhone, iPad, and Android operating system-based devices.  History  LiquidPlanner was founded by Charles Seybold and Jason Carlson in 2006. LiquidPlanner launched a public beta at the DEMO 08 conference. The Alliance of Angels named LiquidPlanner ‚ÄúCompany of the Year‚Äù in May 2011. LiquidPlanner also received the ‚ÄúInnovation Award‚Äù from Info-Tech Research Group in 2011 and 2012. In November 2017, Todd Humphrey became CEO of the company, replacing Liz Pearce. In 2018, the company got $2 million in funding from investors. In February 2020, LiquidPlanner was dubbed by Purch Group's Business News Daily as the best online project management software for analyzing overall company data in 2020.  Software  Built using Ruby on Rails, LiquidPlanner is the industry‚Äôs only priority-based, predictive online project management solution and claims to be the first software as a service (SaaS) based project management solution to allow users to express uncertainty in their task estimates using ranges. The application employs a probabilistic scheduling engine that is claimed to build more accurate schedules. Several authors have noted that estimating in ranges (e.g. 3‚Äì4 days, 1‚Äì3 hours) is preferable to single point estimates (e.g. 1 hour, 2 days). Steve McConnell states \\"simplistic single-point estimates are meaningless because they don't include any indication of the probability associated with the single-point.\\" Project management and scheduling methodologies such as Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) generate best-case/worst-case ranges. However the preponderance of popular project management software does not readily accept ranges as inputs for estimates. LiquidPlanner accepts ranges as estimates and infers a probability distribution from that range. It then uses the distributions and the relationships between tasks and people to calculate a distribution for the project as a whole. By exposing the uncertainty in estimates the developers of LiquidPlanner claim that the uncertainty can then be managed. It then tracks the evolution of these estimates over time. From these uncertainty measures over time it can plot the history of the project estimates. This type of plot is often referred to as the Cone of Uncertainty. Project managers create work spaces and invite users to participate in a way similar to LinkedIn or Facebook. The workspace can contain multiple projects and keeps a running narrative of tasks, comments, documents, and other project collateral. In September 2011, LiquidPlanner introduced their free mobile app that connects the LiquidPlanner online project management workspace to the Apple iPhone and iPad. This app is available through the Apple iTunes Store. Significant updates to its mobile app were made in April 2013. The LiquidPlanner application programming interface (API) enables project managers to programmatically interact with their LiquidPlanner workspace. With the API, most of the LiquidPlanner project management actions can be automated. For example, you can create a task and then post comments, track time against it, and mark the task done when completed. LiquidPlanner was founded in 2006. released its first public beta in 2008, Funding LiquidPlanner is privately held and has raised a total of $17.4 million in funding since incorporation, including a $1 million round raised through the Alliance of Angels Seed Fund.

It is part of the Franciscan Monastery of the Flagellation, which also includes the Church of the Condemnation and Imposition of the Cross. The monastery stands at the traditional Second Station of the Cross on the Via Dolorosa. Tradition Church of the Flagellation The altar of the church According to tradition, the church enshrines the spot where Jesus Christ was flogged by Roman soldiers before his journey down the Via Dolorosa to Calvary. However, this tradition is based on the assumption that an area of Roman flagstones, discovered beneath the adjacent Church of the Condemnation and the Convent of the Sisters of Zion, was Gabbatha, or the pavement the Bible describes as the location of Pontius Pilate's judgment of Jesus (). A triple-arched gateway built by Hadrian as an entrance to the eastern forum of Aelia Capitolina was traditionally, but as archaeological investigation shows, mistakenly,Benoit, Pierre, The Antonia of Herod the Great, and the East Forum of Aelia Capitolina (1971)Benoit, Pierre, The Archaeological Reconstruction of the Antonia Fortress, in Jerusalem Revealed (edited by Yigael Yadin), page 87, (1976) said to have been part of the gate of Herod's Antonia Fortress, which was alleged to be the location of Jesus' trial. It is possible that following its destruction the Antonia Fortress's pavement tiles were brought to Hadrian's plaza. Like Philo, Josephus testifies that the Roman governors stayed in Herod's palace while they were in Jerusalem, carried out their judgements on the pavement immediately outside it, and had those found guilty flogged there;Josephus, Jewish Wars, 2:14:8 Josephus indicates that Herod's palace is on the western hill,Josephus, Jewish Wars, 5:2 and it has recently (2001) been rediscovered under a corner of the Jerusalem citadel near Jaffa Gate. Archaeologists now therefore conclude that, in the first century, the Roman governors judged at the western hill, rather than the area around the Church of the Flagellation, on the diametrically opposite side of the city. History The original church was built by the Crusaders. During the Ottoman period (which in Palestine started in 1516), this early shrine and its surrounding buildings were reportedly used as stables, and later as private houses. The whole complex was given to the Franciscans in 1838 by Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt, who brought parts of Ottoman Syria under Egyptian rule between 1831-41. In 1839 Duke Maximilian Joseph in Bavaria funded a hasty rebuilding of the church over the medieval ruins. The current church was completed between 1928‚Äì29 and was a complete reconstruction, executed by Italian Antonio Barluzzi in the style of the 12th century. The church is held in trust by the Franciscan Custody of the Holy Land. Description The interior of the church consists of a single aisle. Some noteworthy points of interest include the three stained glass windows, each depicting a different aspect of the biblical narrative of the trial of Jesus by Pilate, and the inside of the mosaic-clad golden dome. The northern window depicts Pontius Pilate washing his hands (), the central one behind the altar depicts the Flagellation (, ), and the southern one the victory of Barabbas (, , ). The dome with its mosaic and translucent elements is designed as a crown of thorns.

Centered at the intersection of Memorial Avenue and Grandin Road (US 11), Grandin Village has become one of the more eclectic areas of Roanoke, with an array of independently owned retail and dining establishments. The district has been noted as one of Roanoke's best examples of a mixed-use urban village, and has been used as a local model for future mixed-use developments within the community. History Grandin Village traces its origin to 1906 with the establishment of the Virginia Heights Land Corporation. This land corporation was responsible for the initial development of Virginia Heights after the opening of the Memorial Bridge, which serves as a connection into downtown Roanoke. Development at the T intersection at Grandin and Memorial began with the construction of the original Virginia Heights Elementary School in 1907. By 1911, the Roanoke Street Railway Company completed a streetcar line between Raleigh Court/Virginia Heights and downtown. With this streetcar extension, development of the commercial establishments of the present-day Grandin Village accelerated. In 1919, Virginia Heights was annexed into the city of Roanoke. The majority of the structures in the district were constructed between 1917 and 1945. During this period, the Grandin Village emerged as a major retail and service area serving the residents of southwest Roanoke. On July 31, 1948, streetcar service to the area was abandoned, which also marked the end of streetcar transit altogether in the city of Roanoke. Much of the post-1950s development within the district was designed to accommodate the automobile. After a period of decline in the mid-20th century, the district has since rebounded and has become a local retail and dining destination. Grandin Theatre The centerpiece of the Grandin Village is the Grandin Theatre, which opened in 1932. Designed by Eubank & Caldwell, its eclectic design features elements of various revival styles, and opened as Roanoke's first suburban movie house. The theatre operated continuously through November 11, 2001, when it closed its doors due to its deteriorating condition. After its closure, the Grandin Theatre Foundation raised enough money to renovate and reopen the theatre on October 20, 2002. The Grandin survives as the lone historic movie theatre in the Roanoke Valley.

A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. A total solar eclipse occurs when the Moon's apparent diameter is larger than the Sun's, blocking all direct sunlight, turning day into darkness. Totality occurs in a narrow path across Earth's surface, with the partial solar eclipse visible over a surrounding region thousands of kilometres wide. This eclipse was on the same day as the 2010 FIFA World Cup Final. Visibility Animated map of the eclipse's visibility over the southern Pacific Ocean The eclipse on this day was one of the most remote in recorded history. It was visible over much of the southern Pacific Ocean, touching several atolls in French Polynesia, the Cook Islands, Easter Island, and Argentina's Patagonian plains. Fred Espenak, a NASA astrophysicist, said: In French Polynesia, the eclipse was seen with 98 percent totality. During that time, the diamond ring effect and the Baily's beads occurred. It ended at sunset over the southern tips of Argentina and Chile in South America, including the town of El Calafate. The Sun's altitude was only 1¬∞ during the 2 minute 47 second total phase, but Argentino Lake offered an adequate line-of- sight to the eclipse hanging just above the rugged Andes skyline. A 58% partiality occurred at sunset in Santiago, Chile, but it was not visible due to adverse weather conditions. In other cities such as Valpara√≠so and Coquimbo, clearer skies permitted the event to be witnessed in continental Chile.  Observations  The moon's diameter was 5.805% larger than the sun's, represented by the magnitude of eclipse of the table above, making for a relatively long eclipse duration of 5 minutes, 20.24 seconds. Time lapse images of the eclipse as seen from Vi√±a del Mar, Chile Total eclipse began southeast of Tonga at approximately 18:15 UTC and reached Easter Island by 20:11 UTC. The global sky photography project The World At Night stationed photographers throughout the eclipse's visibility track. Eclipse chasers photographed the event on board a chartered airplane, cruise ships, numerous Pacific islands, and in Argentina's Patagonia region. Totality was observed for four minutes and 41 seconds (4:41) on Easter Island, where it was observed for the first time in 1,400 years. Approximately 4,000 observers visited Easter Island for this eclipse, including tourists, scientists, photographers, filmmakers and journalists,Eclipse chasing: four minutes of bliss, Australian Geographic, July 16, 2010 prompting an increase in security at its important moai archeological sites. The eclipse occurred at the same time that the final game of the 2010 FIFA World Cup was being played in South Africa, and many soccer fans in Tahiti watched the match instead of observing the partial eclipse with a high percentage of obscuring the sun by about 98 percent. The path of totality of this eclipse barely missed some significant inhabited islands, including passing just about 20 km north of the northern end of Tahiti. This eclipse was the first one to happen over French Polynesia in 350 years. An estimated 5,000 tourists visited various islands in the archipelago to observe the event. Nearly 120,000 pairs of special glasses were distributed for observers. Eclipse chasers were also able to observe the eclipse at El Calafate, near the southern tip of Argentina, before the sun set just two minutes later. From Puerto Montt, Chile, 20:44 UTC, near maximum eclipse Several hours after the eclipse was observed in continental Chile, a magnitude 6.2 earthquake struck in the Antofagasta Region. There were no major injuries or damage in the nearby cities of Calama, Chile and San Pedro de Atacama.

Design The M-68 is based on the Finnish designed 122 K 60 and 155 K 68 cannon series, first developed in the mid-1960s by the company Tampella Oy. Twelve Finnish cannons were built between 1970-1975, with more guns later built of later designs. These Tampella guns formed the basis for Soltam's production of the M-68 and later \\"Tampella series\\" guns. Before the 155 K 68 (Tampella), the 155HX prototype was shipped to Soltam for trials.Vesa Toivonen. From Tampella to Partia. Karisto 2003 pp. 145-149 The first prototype was completed in 1968 for trials and evaluations by the Israeli Defense Force (IDF), who were satisfied with the performance of the howitzer. Subsequently, an order was placed with Soltam and a production line was initiated in 1970. The gun entered IDF service in time to serve IDF artillery corps during the Yom Kippur War of 1973. In addition to Israel, the M-68 has also been exported to Singapore and Thailand. Description The barrel of the M-68 was fitted with a simple muzzle brake while the recoil mechanism with its two pneumatic cylinder jacks are positioned on the back-end of the barrel. The gun mount chassis, breech and recoil system were to see further use in the next development of this gun ‚Äî the Soltam M-71, which has a slightly longer barrel (39 calibers versus 33 calibers of the M-68) and a compressed air-driven rammer to ease loading. Variants IDF Ro'em self-propelled gun, mounting a L/33 M-68 In the mid 1970s, the Israeli Defense Forces engineered an improvised self-propelled gun known as the Ro'em / L-33 to complement the towed M-68.

If Stimulus 1 (S1) excites a certain neuronal population, repeated exposure to S1 will result in subsequently attenuated responses. This adaptation may be due to neural fatigue or coupled hemodynamic processes. However, when S1 is followed by a unique stimulus, S2, the response amplitudes should not be attenuated as a fresh sub-population of neurons is excited. Using this technique can allow researchers to determine if the same or unique neuronal groups are involved in processing two stimuli.Krekelberg, B, Boynton, G.M., & van Wezel, R.J.A. (2006).

Both are based upon Vajrayana Buddhism and its pantheon of teachers and divine beings. The major orders of Buddhism in Bhutan are the Drukpa Lineage and the Nyingma. The former is a branch of the Kagyu school and is known for paintings documenting the lineage of Buddhist masters and the 70 Je Khenpo (leaders of the Bhutanese monastic establishment). The Nyingma school is known for images of Padmasambhava (\\"Guru Rinpoche\\"), who is credited with introducing Buddhism into Bhutan in the 7th century. According to legend, Padmasambhava hid sacred treasures for future Buddhist masters, especially Pema Lingpa, to find. Tert√∂ns are also frequent subjects of Nyingma art. Each divine being is assigned special shapes, colors, and/or identifying objects, such as lotus, conch-shell, thunderbolt, and begging bowl. All sacred images are made to exact specifications that have remained remarkably unchanged for centuries. Bhutanese art is particularly rich in bronzes of different kinds that are collectively known by the name Kham-so (made in Kham) even though they are made in Bhutan because the technique of making them was originally imported from that region of Tibet. Wall paintings and sculptures, in these regions, are formulated on the principal ageless ideals of Buddhist art forms. Even though their emphasis on detail is derived from Tibetan models, their origins can be discerned easily, despite the profusely embroidered garments and glittering ornaments with which these figures are lavishly covered. In the grotesque world of demons, the artists apparently had a greater freedom of action than when modeling images of divine beings. The arts and crafts of Bhutan that represents the exclusive \\"spirit and identity of the Himalayan kingdom\\" is defined as the art of Zorig Chosum, which means the ‚Äúthirteen arts and crafts of Bhutan‚Äù; the thirteen crafts are carpentry, painting, paper making, blacksmithery, weaving, sculpting and many other crafts. The Institute of Zorig Chosum in Thimphu is the premier institution of traditional arts and crafts set up by the Government of Bhutan with the sole objective of preserving the rich culture and tradition of Bhutan and training students in all traditional art forms; there is another similar institution in eastern Bhutan known as Trashi Yangtse. Bhutanese rural life is also displayed in the Folk Heritage Museum in Thimphu. There is also a Voluntary Artists Studio in Thimphu to encourage and promote the art forms among the youth of Thimphu. The thirteen arts and crafts of Bhutan and the institutions established in Thimphu to promote these art forms are:Brown, p. 104 Traditional Bhutanese arts Clay statue before painting Padmasambhava or \\"Guru Rinpoche\\", 8th century In Bhutan, the traditional arts are known as zorig chusum (zo = the ability to make; rig = science or craft; chusum = thirteen). These practices have been gradually developed through the centuries, often passed down through families with long-standing relations to a particular craft. These traditional crafts represent hundreds of years of knowledge and ability that has been passed down through generations. The great 15th century tert√∂n, Pema Lingpa is traditionally credited with introducing the arts into Bhutan. In 1680, Ngawang Namgyal, the Zhabdrung Rinpoche, ordered the establishment of the school for instruction in the thirteen traditional arts. Although the skills existed much earlier, it is believed that the zorig chusum was first formally categorized during the rule of Gyalse Tenzin Rabgye (1680-1694), the 4th Druk Desi (secular ruler). The thirteen traditional arts are: * Dezo - Paper Making: Handmade paper made mainly from the Daphne plant and gum from a creeper root. * Dozo - Stonework: Stone arts used in the construction of stone pools and the outer walls of dzongs, gompas, stupas and some other buildings. * Garzo - Blacksmithing: The manufacture of iron goods, such as farm tools, knives, swords, and utensils. * Jinzo - Clay arts: The making of religious statues and ritual objects, pottery and the construction of buildings using mortar, plaster, and rammed earth. * Lhazo - Painting: From the images on thangkas, walls paintings, and statues to the decorations on furniture and window- frames. * Lugzo - Bronze casting: Production of bronze roof-crests, statues, bells, and ritual instruments, in addition to jewelry and household items using sand casting and lost-wax casting. Larger statues are made by repouss√©. * Parzo - Wood, slate, and stone carving: In wood, slate or stone, for making such items as printing blocks for religious texts, masks, furniture, altars, and the slate images adorning many shrines and altars. * Shagzo - Woodturning: Making a variety of bowls, plates, cups, and other containers. * Shingzo - Woodworking: Employed in the construction of dzongs and gompas * Thagzo - Weaving: The production of some of the most intricately woven fabrics produced in Asia. * Tr√∂zo - Silver- and gold-smithing: Working in gold, silver, and copper to make jewelry, ritual objects, and utilitarian household items. * Tshazo - Cane and bamboo work: The production of such varied items as bows and arrows, baskets, drinks containers, utensils, musical instruments, fences, and mats. * Tshemazo ‚Äì Needlework: Working with needle and thread to make clothes, boots, or the most intricate of appliqu√© thangkas. Characteristics of Bhutanese arts Painted thangka of Milarepa (1052-1135), late 19th-early 20th century, Dhodeydrag Gonpa, Thimphu. Articles for everyday use are still fashioned today as they were centuries ago. Traditional artisanship is handed down from generation to generation. Bhutan's artisans are skilled workers in metals, wood and slate carving, and clay sculpture. Artifacts made of wood include bowls and dishes, some lined with silver. Elegant yet strong woven bamboo baskets, mats, hats, and quivers find both functional and decorative usage. Handmade paper is prepared from tree bark by a process passed down the ages. Each region has its specialties: raw silk comes from eastern Bhutan, brocade from Lhuntshi (Kurtoe), woolen goods from Bumthang, bamboo wares from Kheng, woodwork from Tashi Yangtse, gold and silver work from Thimphu, and yak-hair products from the north or the Black Mountains. Most Bhutanese art objects are produced for use of the Bhutanese themselves. Except for goldsmiths, silversmiths, and painters, artisans are peasants who produce these articles and fabrics in their spare time, with the surplus production being sold. Most products, particularly fabrics, are relatively expensive. In the highest qualities, every step of production is performed by hand, from dyeing hanks of thread or hacking down bamboo in the forest, to weaving or braiding the final product. The time spent in producing handicrafts is considerable and can involve as much as two years for some woven textiles. At the same time, many modern innovations are also used for less expensive items, especially modern dyes, and yarns - Bhutan must be one of the few places where hand-woven polyester garments can be bought. Products Embroidery, School of Traditional Arts. ; Textiles Bhutanese textiles are a unique art form inspired by nature made in the form of clothing, crafts and different types of pots in eye-catching blend of colour, texture, pattern and composition. This art form is witnessed all over Bhutan and in Thimphu in the daily life of its people. It is also a significant cultural exchange garment that is gifted to mark occasions of birth and death, auspicious functions such as weddings and professional achievements and in greeting dignitaries. Each region has its own special designs of textiles, either made of vegetable dyed wool known as yathra or pure silk called Kishuthara. It is the women, belonging to a small community, who weave these textiles as a household handicrafts heritage. ; Paintings Most Bhutanese art, including ‚ÄòPainting in Bhutanese art‚Äô, known as lhazo, is invariably religion centric. These are made by artists without inscribing their names on them. The paintings encompass various types including the traditional thangkas, which are scroll paintings made in ‚Äúhighly stylised and strict geometric proportions‚Äù of Buddhist iconography that are made with mineral paints. Most houses in Bhutan have religious and other symbolic motifs painted inside their houses and also on the external walls. ; Sculptures The art of making religious sculptures is unique in Bhutan and hence very popular in the Himalayan region. The basic material used for making the sculptures is clay, which is known as jinzob. The clay statues of Buddhist religious icons, made by well-known artists of Bhutan, embellish various monasteries in Bhutan. This art form of sculpture is taught to students by professional artists at the Institute of Zorig Chosum in Thimphu. ; Paper making Handmade paper known as deysho is in popular usage in Bhutan and it is durable and insect resistant. The basic material used is the bark of the Daphne plant. This paper is used for printing religious texts; traditional books are printed on this paper. It is also used for packaging gifts. Apart from handmade paper, paper factories in Bhutan also produce ornamental art paper with designs of flower petals, and leaves, and other materials. For use on special occasions, vegetable dyed paper is also made. ; Wood carving Slate carving, School of Traditional Arts. Wood carving known as Parzo is a specialised and ancient art form, which is significantly blended with modern buildings in the resurgent Bhutan. Carved wood blocks are used for printing religious prayer flags that are seen all over Bhutan in front of monasteries, on hill ridges and other religious places. Carving is also done on slate and stone. The wood that is used for carving is seasoned for at least one year prior to carving. Contemporary hand woven Bhutanese fabrics, Bumthang District ; Sword making The art of sword making falls under the tradition of garzo (or blacksmithing), an art form that is used to make all metal implements such as swords, knives, chains, darts and so forth. Ceremonial swords are made and gifted to people who are honoured for their achievements. These swords are to be sported by men on all special occasions. Children, wear a traditional short knife known as the dudzom. Terton Pema Lingpa, a religious treasure hunter from central Bhutan, was the most famous sword maker in Bhutan. ;Boot Making It is not uncommon to see Bhutan‚Äôs traditional boots made of cloth. The cloth is hand stitched, embroidered and appliqu√©d with Bhutanese motifs. They are worn on ceremonial occasions (mandatory); the colours used on the boot denote the rank and status of the person wearing it. In the pecking order, Ministers wear orange, senior officials wear red and the common people wear white boots. This art form has been revived at the Institute of Zorig Chosum in Thimphu. Women also wear boots but of shorter length reaching just above the ankle. ; Bamboo Craft Bamboo Craft made with cane and bamboo is known as thazo. It is made in many rural communities in many regions of Bhutan. Few special items of this art form are the belo and the bangchung, popularly known as the Bhutanese ‚ÄúTupperware‚Äù basket made in various sizes. Baskets of varying sizes are used in the homes and for travel on horseback, and as flasks for local drink called the arra. ;Bow and Arrow Making To meet the growing demand for bow and arrow used in the national sport of archery, bamboo bows and arrows are made by craftsmen using specific types of bamboo and mountain reeds. The bamboo used are selected during particular seasons, shaped to size and skilfully made into the bow and arrow. Thimphu has the Changlimithang Stadium & Archery Ground where Archery is a special sport.Brown, p. 105 ; Jewellery Intricate jewellery with motif, made of silver and gold, are much sought after by women of Bhutan. The traditional jewellery made in Bhutan are heavy bracelets, komas or fasteners attached to the kira, the traditional dress of Bhutanese women, loop ear rings set with turquoise and necklaces inlaid with gem stones such as antique turquoise, coral beads and the zhi stone. The zhi stone is considered a prized possession as it is said to have ‚Äúprotective powers‚Äù; this stone has black and white spiral designs called ‚Äúeyes‚Äù. The zhi is also said to be an agate made into beads. Institutions ; National Institute of Zorig Chusum The National Institute of Zorig Chusum is the centre for Bhutanese Art education. Painting is the main theme of the institute, which provides 4‚Äì6 years of training in Bhutanese traditional art forms. The curricula cover a comprehensive course of drawing, painting, wood carving, embroidery, and carving of statues. Images of Buddha are a popular painting done here. ; Handicrafts emporiums There is a large government run emporium close to the National Institute of Zorig Chusum, which deals with exquisite handicrafts, traditional arts and jewelry; gho and kira, the national dress of Bhutanese men and women, are available in this emporium. The town has many other privately owned emporiums which deal with thangkas, paintings, masks, brassware, antique jewellery, painted lama tables known as choektse, drums, Tibetan violins and so forth; Zangma Handicrafts Emporium, in particular, sells handicrafts made in the Institute of Zorig Chusum.Brown, p. 114 ; Folk Heritage Museum Folk Heritage Museum in Kawajangsa, Thimphu is built on the lines of a traditional Bhutanese farm house with more-than-100-year-old vintage furniture. It is built as a three storied structure with rammed mud walls and wooden doors, windows and roof covered with slates. It reveals much about Bhutanese rural life. ; Voluntary Artists Studio Located in an innocuous building, the Voluntary Artist Studio‚Äôs objective is to encourage traditional and contemporary art forms among the youth of Thimphu who are keen to imbibe these art forms. The art works of these young artists is also available on sale in the 'Art Shop Gallery' of the studio. ; National Textile Museum The National Textile Museum in Thimphu displays various Bhutanese textiles that are extensive and rich in traditional culture. It also exhibits colourful and rare kiras and ghos (traditional Bhutanese dress, kira for women and gho for men). Exhibitions The Honolulu Museum of Art spent several years developing and curating The Dragon‚Äôs Gift: The Sacred Arts of Bhutan exhibition.

His record that year was 5 wins and 13 losses with an earned run average of 4.45. While Tate is noted for never having achieved a Major League hit despite having 41 at bats, he is best known for nearly pitching a no-hitter on August 4, 1975 at Shea Stadium against the Montreal Expos. Despite not allowing a hit through seven and one third innings, Tate ended up losing the game‚Äîwhich seems to have been the final straw for Mets management regarding the tenure of manager Yogi Berra, who was fired the next day. After spending the entire 1975 season in the Mets starting pitching rotation, Tate was sent to the Mets' class AAA minor league affiliate at Tidewater for the 1976 season. He pitched poorly and never made another major league appearance. After 1976, Tate was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates and pitched for their Triple A affiliate.

One of the first nanoradios was constructed in 2007 by researchers under Alex Zettl at the University of California, Berkeley where they successfully transmitted an audio signal. Due to the small size, nanoradios can have several possible applications such as radio function in the bloodstream.  History  The first observation of a nanoradio can be accredited to a Japanese physicist Sumio Iijima in 1991 who saw a \\"a luminous discharge of electricity\\" coming from a carbon nanotube on a graphite electrode. On October 31, 2007, a team of researchers under Alex Zettl at the University of California, Berkeley created one of the first nanoradios. Their experiment consisted of placing a multilayered nanotube placed on a silicon electrode and connecting it to a counter electrode through a wire and a DC battery. Both the electrode and nanotube were also put in a vacuum of about 10‚àí7 Torr. They then placed the apparatus into a high-resolution transmission electron microscope to document the movement of the nanotube. They observed the nanoradio vibrating and transmitted a song called \\"Layla\\" by Eric Clapton. After some minor adjustments, the team was able to transmit and receive signals from a couple meters across the laboratory; however, the initial audio receptions from the radio were scratchy which Zettl believed was due to the lack of a better vacuum.  Properties  The small size, roughly 10 nanometers wide and hundreds of nanometers long, and composition of nanoradios provide several distinct properties. The small size of nanoradios enables electrons to pass through without much friction, making nanoradios efficient conductors. Nanoradios can also come in different sizes; they can be double-walled, tripled-walled and multi-walled. Aside from the different sizes, nanoradios can also take different shapes such as bent, straight or toroidal. Common among all nanoradios is how relatively strong they are. The resistance can be attributed to the strength of the bonds between carbon atoms.  Function  The fundamental parts of a radio are the antenna, tuner, demodulator and amplifier. Carbon nanotubes are special in that they can function as these parts without the need of extra circuitry. = Antenna = The nanoradio is small enough for electromagnetic signals to mechanically vibrate the nanoradio. The nanoradio essentially acts as an antenna by vibrating with the same frequency as the signal from incoming electromagnetic waves; this is in contrast with traditional radio antennas, which are generally stationary. The nanotube can vibrate in high frequencies, from \\"thousands to millions of times per second.\\" = Tuner = The nanoradio can also function as a tuner by extending or reducing the length of the nanotube; doing so changes the resonance frequency at which it vibrates, enabling the radio to tune into specific frequencies. The length of the nanotube can be extended by pulling the tip with a positive electrode and can be shortened by removing atoms off the tip. Consequently, changing the length is permanent and can't be reversed; however, the method of varying the electric field can also affect the frequency that the nanoradio responds without being permanent. = Amplifier = As a benefit of the microscopic size and needle-like shape, the nanoradio functions naturally as an amplifier. The nanoradio exhibits field emission, in which a small voltage emits a flow of electrons; due to this, a small electromagnetic wave would produce a large flow of electrons, amplifying the signal. = Demodulator = Demodulation is essentially the separation of the information signal from the carrier wave. When the nanoradio vibrates in sync with the carrier wave, the nanoradio responds only to the information signal and ignores the carrier wave; and so, the nanoradio can act as a demodulator without the need of circuitry.  Medical Application  Currently, chemotherapy uses chemicals that harm not only cancerous cells, but also healthy ones since they are put into the blood stream. Nanoradios can be used to prevent damage to healthy cells by remotely communicating with the radio to release drugs and specifically target cancerous cells. Nanoradios can also be injected into individual cells to release certain chemicals, enabling repair of specific cells. Nanoradios can also be used to monitor insulin levels of diabetes patients and use that information to release a drug or chemical.  Complications  The implanting of nanoradios in the body are currently not feasible due to power dissipation. The nanoradio radiates about 4.5 x 10‚àí27 W of electromagnetic power; however, much of this power would be lost when passing through the body. The amount of energy input can be increased, but would generate too much heat in the body, posing a safety risk. Other issues include the difficulty of constructing a nanoradio due to its nanoscale size, requiring quantum models and precision to manufacture.

The town had its own post office, hall and strong community until the 1930s when most moved to the main town site. The town boasted its own cricket team as well as many other groups. The town experienced a period of economic boom until the international price of tin slumped in 1893, which caused the Greenbushes' industry to collapse. By 1913, approximately one quarter of Greenbushes' inhabitants were working in the timber industry, which was established shortly after the first mine.

IgG deficiency is often found in children as transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy (THI), which may occur with or without additional decreases in IgA or IgM. IgG has four subclasses: IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4. It is possible to have either a global IgG deficiency, or a deficiency of one or more specific subclasses of IgG. The main clinically relevant form of IgG deficiency is IgG2. IgG3 deficiency is not usually encountered without other concomitant immunoglobulin deficiencies, and IgG4 deficiency is very common but usually asymptomatic. IgG1 is present in the bloodstream at a percentage of about 60-70%, IgG2-20-30%, IgG3 about 5-8 %, and IgG4 1-3 %. IgG subclass deficiencies affect only IgG subclasses (usually IgG2 or IgG3), with normal total IgG and IgM immunoglobulins and other components of the immune system being at normal levels. These deficiencies can affect only one subclass or involve an association of two subclasses, such as IgG2 and IgG4. IgG deficiencies are usually not diagnosed until the age of 10. Some of the IgG levels in the blood are undetectable and have a low percentage such as IgG4, which makes it hard to dertermine if a deficiency is actually present. IgG subclass deficiencies are sometimes correlated with bad responses to pneumoccal polysaccharides, especially IgG2 and or IgG4 deficiency.

Shortly after the end of World War II, in 1946, Sam Zidell's son Emery, who now headed the business, purchased the shipyard of Commercial Iron Works in Portland and turned it into a shipbreaking yard, called the Zidell Ship Dismantling Company. With scrap steel in high demand for rebuilding America's industrial base in the postwar period, business boomed and by the 1960s the company, now known as Zidell Explorations, Inc., had become America's largest shipbreaker. In the course of its thirty years of shipbreaking operations, Zidell dismantled a total of 336 ships, including many World War II-era Liberty ships and naval auxiliaries, and some warships. , a WWII-era naval auxiliary scrapped by Zidell From 1948, Zidell also began to recover industrial valves from its shipbreaking operations and resell them, a business that was eventually spun off into the Zidell Valve Corporation. Zidell Valves was sold in 1997 to Pon Holdings of the Netherlands. In 1955, Emery Zidell also founded Tube Forgings of America, Inc. (TFA), which supplies welding fittings for a wide variety of applications. TFA was the first US manufacturer of carbon steel welding fittings to earn an ISO-9002 certification and is one of the world's largest manufacturers of such fittings today.Zidell Companies press release , 30 October 2003. In 1960, Emery Zidell established the Zidell Marine Corporation, which used steel recovered from Zidell's shipbreaking business to build new barges. Demand soon outstripped the supply of recycled steel however, so Zidell began building barges from new steel. Between 1961 and 2017, when it discontinued its barge manufacturing, the company built 277 barges, varying in length between and . During the final 15 years of production, most of Zidell's barges were double-hulled tankers. At its peak, Zidell Marine was employing 90 workers in barge production at its South Waterfront complex. In 2009, the total was 85, of which about 30 were administrative staff. Since 1996, the company has been headed by Jay Zidell, the grandson of Sam Zidell. In 2010, the grandson of Emery Zidell, Matt French, joined to the company to explore and develop for Zidell Company. In July 2011, the Zidell Company took part in a project to clean up the shoreline of the Willamette River. The project budget was $20 million and was directed at capping and removing dangerous contaminants, restoring wildlife habitat, and re-sloping and replanting the banks. Some of the land will be used for real estate development, including Zidell Yards.Zidell Yards unveils South Waterfront development planZidell Marine CorporationZidell Yards Today, Zidell Marine and Tube Forgings of America remain family-run businesses, headed by Emery's son Jay. The companies currently employ some 200 people in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. As of mid-2017, Tube Forgings had 140 employees working in its plant, located on NW Front Avenue near Kittridge Avenue, in Portland's Northwest Industrial area. In September 2016, the company announced that it was preparing to shut down its barge-building business permanently and discontinue use of its South Waterfront property in 2017. Zidell Marine launched its final barge on June 16, 2017. Subsequent removal of equipment from the site is expected to take several months. A separate barge-leasing business is to continue operating.

It was discovered on 22 August 1969, by Czech astronomer Lubo≈° Kohoutek at the Bergedorf Observatory in Hamburg, Germany. The asteroid was named in memory of Czech writer Karel ƒåapek.  Orbit and classification  ƒåapek is a background asteroid, not associated to any known asteroid family. It orbits the Sun in the inner part of the central main-belt near the 3:1 resonance with Jupiter at a distance of 1.9‚Äì3.2 AU once every 4 years and 1 month (1,480 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.27 and an inclination of 8¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The asteroid was first identified as at Goethe Link Observatory in October 1957. The body's observation arc begins at Crimea‚ÄìNauchnij, eleven days prior to its official discovery observation at Bergedorf.  Physical characteristics  = Spectral type = In the Tholen classification, ƒåapek is a common carbonaceous C-type asteroid. This strongly disagrees with the albedo obtained by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), which indicates that ƒåapek is a stony S-type asteroid rather than a carbonaceous one. = Rotation period = As of 2017, no rotational lightcurve of ƒåapek has been obtained from photometric observations. The asteroid's rotation period, shape and poles remain unknown. = Diameter and albedo = According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, ƒåapek measures 6.628 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.254.  Naming  This minor planet was named in memory of Karel ƒåapek (1890‚Äì1938), Czech dramatist and novelist, best known for his allegorical plays R.U.R. and Krakatit, in which he anticipated both, the destructive potential of nuclear physics and their moral implications. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 27 June 1991 ().

Among the participants was Chaim Potok, who served as a chaplain. His experiences in Korea led to the book, The Book of Lights and I am the Clay. Most of the Jewish community in South Korea resides in Seoul. The community is mostly U.S. military personnel and their families, business people, English-language journalists and teachers, and tourists.Scheib, Ariel \\"The Virtual Jewish History Tour- South Korea\\" Jewish Virtual Library https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/south_korea.html The Jewish population is constantly in flux, due to the rotation of U.S. military personnel in the country. While the soldiers have a Jewish chaplain at the Yongsan Army Base, their services are restricted and off-limits to most civilians. At this time, there are no Jewish schools. Israel has full diplomatic relations with South Korea, and the sizable Christian population in the country also keeps ties strong between the countries. In August 2005, the Jerusalem Summit promoting Christian support for Israel was held in Seoul.The Jerusalem Summit http://www.jerusalemsummit.org/eng/index_js_asia_seoul.php In contrast, neighboring North Korea has no known Jews within its borders. In April 2008, the first Chabad House was established in Seoul under direction of Rabbi Osher Litzman, accompanied by his wife, Mussia Litzman. As there were no synagogues in the country, Jews in Korea would have to go to the U.S. Army base for Shabbat meals and holiday services. Chabad.org news service reported that the Israeli ambassador to South Korea asked three visiting Lubavitch yeshiva students to help arrange for permanent Chabad emissaries. Though very few South Koreans are interested in Judaism as a religion, philo-Semitism is prevalent among the South Korean population as they reportedly hope to emulate Jews' high academic standards by studying books derived from Jewish works such as the Torah and Talmud. With South Korean society's passion for education, South Koreans hold a stereotypical view of Jews as the model of academic excellence as well as Jews being very intelligent. However, the half-Jewish journalist Dave Hazzan investigated on this result and found no anti-semitism in South Korea. Moreover, Abe Foxman, head of the ADL, admitted that cultural norms affected the respondents' answers which has to be considered for future surveys. In addition, South Koreans also laud Jews as a high achieving and accomplished group of people citing the disproportionate of successful Jewish businesspeople and Nobel Prize winners as evidence and use this as inspiration for the South Korean populace to emulate Jewish success. The South Korean media often discusses the merits of \\"Jewish education\\" to the South Korean populace. South Koreans also identify with Judaism's arduous history of being oppressed peoples, surviving adversity with nothing but intellect and ingenuity to socioeconomically succeed, as well as its strong emphasis on family. In 2019, the first mikveh in South Korea was opened.

Applications Microstimulation is used in neuroanatomical research to identify the functional significance of a group of neurons. For example, Vidal-Gonzalez et al. (2006) Vidal-Gonzalez, I., Vidal-Gonzalez, B., Rauch, S. L., & Quirk, G. J. (2006). Microstimulation reveals opposing influences of prelimbic and infralimbic cortex on the expression of conditioned fear. Learning & Memory, 13, 728-733. applied microstimulation to the rat prelimbic and infralimbic subregions of the medial prefrontal cortex while testing the subjects in a fear-inducing low-footshock condition for various behavioral indicators of fear (such as freezing). This test allowed them to compare the relative fear behavior of rats under microstimulation in either subregion to normal rats in the same condition. The researchers concluded that the prelimbic subregion excites fear behavior while the infralimbic subregion inhibits fear behavior. In this instance, the correlation between stimulation and behavior helped identify the function of these two subregions in the process of fear. Microstimulation is being explored as a method to deliver sensory percepts to circumvent damaged sensory receptors or pathways. For example, stimulation of primary visual cortex create phosphenes (flashes of light) which can be used to restore some vision for a blind individual. Other applications include bladder prostheses; cochlear and brain-stem auditory prostheses and retinal and thalamic visual prostheses.
