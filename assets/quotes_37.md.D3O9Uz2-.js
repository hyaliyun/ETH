In a racing career which lasted from April 1993 and May 2001, he won twenty of his fifty- four races and was placed on sixteen occasions. After beginning in National Hunt Flat races he competed over hurdles winning the Punchestown Champion Novice Hurdle in 1994. In the following season he raced in novice chases and recorded major wins in the Dennys Gold Medal Chase, Arkle Novice Chase and Arkle Challenge Trophy. In 1996 he had his biggest success when taking the Queen Mother Champion Chase and followed up in the BMW Handicap Chase. He was never as good again, but won a second BMW Chase in 1997 and took the Normans Grove Chase in 1998, 1999 and 2001 before retiring at the age of twelve. During his career he had sustained rivalries with the leading Irish jumpers Sound Man and Merry Gale. Background Klairon Davis was a brown gelding with a white star and snip bred in France by Claude Quellier. His sire, Rose Laurel won the Prix Daru and the Prix Eug√®ne Adam in 1973, when he was rated 121 by Timeform. Rose Laurel was a representative of the Byerley Turk sire line, unlike more than 95% of modern thoroughbreds, who descend directly from the Darley Arabian. Klairon Davis's dam Styrene also produced Trumpet Davis, the dam of the Warfield Mares' Hurdle winner Violin Davis. Klairon Davis was acquired as a yearling by Chris Jones and sent into training with Arthur Moore at Naas in County Kildare. Moore, the son of Dan Moore who trained L'Escargot, had established himself as a leading trainer in his own right in the 1980s with horses such as Royal Bond and Drumgora. During his racing career, Klairon Davis usually raced in a sheepskin noseband. Racing career 1992/1993 season: National Hunt Flat races Klairon Davis began his racing career at Punchestown Racecourse on 27 April 1993 when he contested the two-mile Tom O'Leary Memorial INH Flat Race. Ridden by the amateur jockey Humphrey Murphy, he started at odds of 12/1 and finished sixth of the thirty runners, nine lengths behind the winner Dunferne Classic. 1993/1994 season: Novice Hurdles Klairon Davis began his undefeated second season in a National Hunt Flat race at Gowran Park on 4 November 1994 in which he was again ridden by Murphy. He started the 6/4 favourite against seven opponents and recorded his first victory, beating the mare Maryjo by eleven lengths. Three weeks later he made his debut over obstacles in a novice hurdle race at Naas Racecourse and won by twelve lengths when ridden by the professional jockey Tom Taaffe, who was riding in his final season. Taaffe was again in the saddle when Klairon Davis added wins in novice hurdles at Navan Racecourse in December and Thurles Racecourse in early January. At the end of January, Murphy partnered the gelding to a fifth successive win at Naas, beating Court Melody by three lengths. Klairon Davies missed the 1994 Cheltenham Festival and returned on 4 April at Fairyhouse Racecourse when he was moved up in class for the Grade 2 Jameson Gold Cup Hurdle. In this race he was matched for the first time against the Edward O'Grady-trained gelding Sound Man and the pair started joint-favourites at odds of 2/1. Ridden for the first time by Tom Horgan, Klairon Davis was restrained in the early stages before taking the lead approaching the last fence and defeated Sound Man by a length and a half. Three weeks later Klairon Davis was stepped up in class again and for the Group 1 Champion Novice Hurdle at Punchestown and started 7/4 favourite ahead of Winter Belle, Sound Man and Monalee River. Horgan sent the gelding into the lead at the final hurdle and won his seventh consecutive race by a length from the Jim Bolger-trained outsider Riszard. 1994/1995 season: Novice Chases In the 1994/1995 season was switched to compete over larger obstacles when he began to compete in novice steeplechases. His seven-race winning sequence came to an end on 27 October his debut over fences when he fell in a race at Tipperary Racecourse won by the Aidan O'Brien-trained seven-year-old Idiot's Venture. Francis \\"Frannie\\" Woods took over the ride at Navan eleven days later and Klairon Davis recorded his first chase win, beating Calmos by three lengths at odds of 8/11. On 26 November he started 6/4 favourite over Idiot's Delight in a novice chase at Punchestown but was beaten two lengths into second place by his older rival. On his final appearance of 1995, Klairon Davis faced Idiot's Delight, Sound Man and Winter Belle in the Group 1 Dennys Gold Medal Chase over two miles one furlong at Leopardstown Racecourse on 26 December. He was in third place behind Sound Man and Winter Belle when Idiot's Delight fell at the second last. Klairon Davis stayed on strongly on the run- in to take the lead in the final strides and won by a head and a length from Winter Belle and Sound Man. In the Arkle Novice Chase at Fairyhouse on 29 January, Klairon Davis won again, beating Winter Belle by ten lengths with the favourite Idiot's Delight being pulled up injured three fences out. For his next race, the gelding was sent to the Cheltenham Festival for the first time to contest the Arkle Challenge Trophy over two miles. He started the 7/2 favourite ahead of the Dipper Novices' Chase winner Morceli, with Sound Man the co-third choice in the betting alongside the Henry VIII Novices' Chase winner Sound Reveille and Dancing Paddy. Sound Reveile took the early lead from Morceli, with Klairon Davis racing at the back of the field on the wide outside. At the seventh fence Sound Reveille made a very bad jumping error, handing the advantage to Morceli and Klairon Davis made progress into fourth place. Sound Man overtook Morceli at the third last, but Klairon Davis continued his forward move and gained the advantage at the next fence. Klairon Davis and Sound Man raced side by side over the last obstacle and along the run-in, with the favourite prevailing by half a length despite Woods dropping his whip in the closing stages. At Punchestown on 27 April, Klairon Davis met Sound Man yet again in the Bank of Ireland Novice Chase, but also faced a new rival in the Paddy Burke-trained Strong Platinum who had won the BMW Chase two days earlier. After racing in third for most of the way, Klairon Davis, the 6/4 favourite, made a forward move approaching the last, but could make no further progress on the run-in and finished third behind Strong Platinum and Sound Man. Three weeks after his defeat at Punchestown, the gelding was sent to France to contest a hurdle race over 4100 metres at Auteuil Hippodrome, but ran last of the four finishers behind the locally trained Poplife. 1995/1996 season: Steeplechases On his first appearance against more experienced chasers, Klairon Davis contested a Grade 3 race at Tipperary on 16 November in which he was matched at level weights against Merry Gale, the winner of the Punchestown Chase, Powers Gold Cup and Martell Cup. Starting the 9/10 favourite, he tracked Merry Gale before taking the lead at the second last and won by six lengths. Commenting on the possibility of a clash with the reigning two-mile champion chaser Viking Flagship, Moore said \\"Klairon Davis did that well, but he will be having a light programme because there are not many suitable races over this trip in this country. Next spring will be time enough to take on Viking Flagship\\". The gelding was then tried over longer distances and failed to complete the course in his next two races, falling at the fifth in the John Durkan Memorial Punchestown Chase on 25 November and unseating Woods at the fourth at Leopardstown on 13 January. Later in January he was dropped back in distance for a two-mile handicap chase at Paunchestown and was beaten a neck by Brockley Court, to whom he was conceding twenty pounds. Klairon Davis was again sent to the Cheltenham Festival where he was one of seven horses to contest the 38th running of the Queen Mother Champion Chase on 13 March. His opponents were Viking Flagship the winner of the race for the last two years, Travado (runner-up in 1994 and winner of the 1993 Arkle Challenge Trophy), Sound Man, Strong Platinum, Dancing Paddy and Coulton (Aintree Chase). Sound Man, who had won the Tingle Creek Trophy in December and the Comet Chase in February was made the 11/8 favourite ahead of Viking Flagship and Strong Platinum with Klairon Davis fourth choice in the betting at 9/1, Dancing Paddy made the early running from Sound Man and Viking Flagship with Klairon Davis held up by Woods in fifth. Sound Man took over the lead at the sixth and led from Viking Flagship with Klairon Davis moving up into third. After mistakes at the fourth and third last fences Klairon Davis turned into the straight in third behind Sound Man and Viking Flagship who looked poised to dispute the finish. Francis Woods, however, moved Klairon Davis steadily forward on the outside and jumped past the two leaders at the final fence before drawing away to win by five lengths. Viking Flagship kept on for second ahead of Sound Man, Travado and Strong Platinum. After the race Moore said \\"After his last race at Punchestown he could hardly walk into his box. He was on three legs. I never thought he would even run at Cheltenham, never mind win\\" whilst Woods commented \\"Klairon Davis is a spring horse and the forgotten horse... He is as tough as anything and it was pure class up the hill\\". Chris Jones' wife Jill received the trophy from the 95-year-old Queen Mother. Afterwards, connections returned to Ireland to celebrate in Murray's Pub in Dunshaughlin. The gelding was again tried over longer distances in the Melling Chase at Aintree Racecourse sixteen days later, but after pulling hard in the early stages he finished last of the four runners behind Viking Flagship, Sound Man and Coulton, beaten more than twenty lengths by the winner. On his final appearance of the season, Klairon Davis carried top weight of 168 pounds in the BMW Handicap Chase over two miles at Punchestown on 23 April. His opponents were Sound Man (with whom he started the 5/2 joint- favourite), Strong Platinum, Coulton, Sound Reveille, Brockley Court, the mare Opera Hat and the 1994 Arkle Challenge Trophy winner Nakir. After disputing the lead with Sound Man, he took a clear advantage at the third last fence and soon went clear, winning by ten lengths from Sound Man, with Opera Hat half a lengths away in third place. 1996/1997 season: Steeplechases On his first appearance of the 1996/1997 season Klairon Davis was beaten half a length by Fiftysevenchannels in a handicap chase at Leopardstown on 10 November when he conceded twenty-one pounds to the winner. On 7 December he started 5/2 second favourite for the Punchestown Chase but fell four fences from the finish. Three weeks later in handicap chase at Leopardstown he was beaten into second place by Merry Gale, to whom he was conceding fifteen pounds. Klairon Davis returned to winning form in handicap chase at Navan in February, beating Idiot's Venture by eight lengths, conceding 21 pounds to the runner-up. On 12 March 1997, Klairon Davis attempted to repeat his 1996 success in the Queen Mother Champion Chase at Cheltenham and started as the 3/1 joint-second favourite behind the improving six-year-old Strong Promise and alongside Viking Flagship. Racing on firmer ground than in the previous year he was held up in the early staged but appeared outpaced on the final turn and finished fourth of the six runners behind Martha's Son, Ask Tom and Viking Flagship. On his final appearance of the sea on the season, Klairon Davis returned to Ireland for the BMW Chase at Punchestown on 22 April and started 11/10 favourite despite conceding seventeen pounds to his six opponents who included Idiot's Delight, Opera Hat and the British challenger Arctic Kinsman and Big Matt. After being challenged in the early stages by Opera Hat he took the lead and jumped well before drawing away over the last two fences to win the race for the second time, beating Big Matt by eight lengths with Idiot's Venture in third. 1997/1998 season: Steeplechases Klairon Davis began his sixth season in the Dunston Wood Chase at Fairyhouse on 23 October and won by eleven lengths from Fiftysevenchannels. As in all of his races that season he was ridden by Richard Dunwoody. He was sent to England in December and finished fourth to Ask Tom, Viking Flagship and Or Royal when starting 6/4 favourite for the Tingle Creek Trophy. On New Year's Day 1998 he was beaten into second place when attempting to concede seventeen pounds to Merry Gale in a handicap at Fairyhouse. Dunwoody explained that the gelding was unsuited by the heavy ground. At the same course four weeks later, Klairon Davis met Merry Gale again in the Normans Grove Chase, this time conceding fourteen pounds to his rival. Dunwoody tracked Merry Gale and recovered from a mistake at the second last before taking the lead at the final fence and winning by a length, with Fiftysevenchannels fourteen lengths back in third. In March, Klairon Davis ran in the Queen Mother Champion Stakes for the third time. Starting the 100/30 second favourite he finished fourth of the eight runners behind One Man, Or Royal and Lord Dorcet, beaten fourteen lengths by the winner. On his final appearance of the season he fell at the second fence as he attempted to win a third BMW Chase at Punchestown. Later career In the 1998/1999 season Klairon Davis won one of his four races. On his first run of the year he crossed the line in third behind Merry Gale and Hill Society in a very unusual race at Cork Racecourse in November. Merry Gale was disqualified when his jockey took the wrong course and missed out the second last fence. In December he finished unplaced behind Direct Route in the Tingle Creek Trophy at Sandown and then finished second to Papillon, ahead of Merry Gale and Opera Hat in the Paddy Power Dial-A-Bet Chase at Leopardstown. On 30 January the gelding was ridden for the first time by Conor O'Dwyer as he contested his second Normans Grove Chase at Fairyhouse. Starting the 4/6 favourite he led from the start and won in \\"impressive\\" style by fourteen lengths from Opera Hat. After the race the gelding developed heart problems and was off the course for nine months. In the following season Klairon Davis failed to win in eight races despite contesting some lower class races. After finishing second at Dundalk Racecourse he finished fourth in the Fortria Chase at Navan and the Hilly Way Chase at Fairyhouse before running fifth behind Merry Gale in the Paddy Power Dial-A-Bet Chase at Leopardstown. He finished second to Mr Baxter Basics in the Normans Grove Chase in January and then finished unplaced when carrying top weight of 162 pounds in the Grand Annual Chase at the Cheltenham Festival. In his two remaining races that season he finished third to Mr Baxter Basics in a handicap at Fairyhouse in April and third in a similar event at Killarney in May. Klairon Davis began his final season by running third behind To Your Honour in a race at Naas and then ran third to the same horse in the Hilly Way Chase. In December he finished last of the four runners behind Papillon (who had won the Grand National in April), To Your Honour and Miles Byrne in the Paddy Power Dial-A-Bet Chase. On 28 January at Fairyhouse, Klairon Davis started the 11/2 outsider of the three runners when facing Papillon and Mr Baxter Basics in the Normans Grove Chase. After racing in third in the early stages, O'Dwyer sent the twelve-year-old into the lead at the fifth fence. Although Mr Baxter Basics dropped away after a bad mistake at the third last Papillon maintained his challenge but Klairon Davis prevailed by a length to record his twentieth and final career victory. After the race Moore commented that the veteran \\"has still got a bit of life in him yet\\". In his next two races, Klairon Davis finished third to Moscow Flyer in the Newlands Chase at Naas in February and third to Micko's Dream in the Irish Independent Chase at Fairyhouse in April. On his final racecourse appearance, Klairon Davis finished fourth behind Micko's Dream in a handicap at Fairyhouse on 4 May 2001. Retirement In October 2001 it was announced that Klairin Davis would not race again and would spend his retirement at Chris Jones's farm in Dunshaughlin, County Meath. Arthur Moore said \\"We took the decision to retire Klairon Davis as he has done everything and has been a wonderful servant... He is certainly going to be missed around the yard\\". Klarion Davis died at the farm on 27 March 2018 at the age of 29: according to Chris Jones (the son of his late owner) the horse \\"passed away peacefully\\".

It was a complex hydropneumatic, computer-controlled active suspension system. This did away with conventional springs and anti- roll (stabiliser) bars in favour of hydraulic struts controlled by an array of sensors (such as yaw velocity sensors, vertical G sensors, height sensors, wheel speed sensors, longitudinal and lateral G sensors) that detected cornering, acceleration and braking forces. The system worked well and gave an unusually controlled yet smooth ride with no body roll. However, the additional weight and power requirements of the system affected straight-line performance somewhat.

It has been proposed that either the bass foot pedal or hi-hat pedal was invented, or rather, standardized, first. The illustration in Blades and Dean (2002) implies that the low-boy started out as a stick laid over two cymbals (\\"sock cymbal\\") and that the positioning of the snare and bass was facing each other, nearly touching at the bottom, achieved through use of snare and bass drum stands, while Nicholls describes the snare drum as being, \\"tilted alarmingly close to vertical.\\" Hessler and Famularo (2008) argue that the bass drum pedal must have come first, due to its less sensitive action. This process also contributed to the standard drum kit layout and arm position, as most drummers chose to play the bass pedal with their right foot. When the hi-hat came along, it was left to the other foot, and traditional grip made the use of the right hand, and thus a cross-, rather than open-, handed technique, more comfortable.Hessler and Famularo (2008), p.10.

The main A4077 road to Gilwern crosses it. The bridge is claimed to be the longest stone bridge in Wales at over . History and description The bridge is first documented in 1538 and is believed to have existed since medieval times, originally constructed from timber. In 1706 it was completely rebuilt in stone with additional arches, at a cost of ¬£400. It was replaced by a temporary bridge in 1808 after being severely damaged by flooding and the repaired bridge, in 1810, was widened on the northwest (upstream) side (the downstream side remains original to 1706). The bridge engineer was Benjamin James (of Llangattock) and the cost totalled ¬£2,300. In 1828‚Äì30 the northeast end was altered, reducing the upstream length by one arch by combining the two largest upstream arches into one. The bridge was substantially repaired in 1928 and again in 1979, to repair cracking caused by motor vehicles. In 2011 part of the parapet was demolished by a car, following a police chase. Crickhowell Bridge is unusual (due to the 1828 alterations) in that it has a different number of arches upstream (12) from downstream (13). On the (original) downstream side, the arches are recessed, though not on the upstream side. The bridge has V-shaped cutwaters to both sides with pedestrian refuges above. Construction is of rubble masonry with flat coping stones on the parapets. The bridge is long and has a minimum width of between parapets. The bridge became a Grade I listed structure in 1998, being \\"one of Wales' finest early bridges\\". It is also a Scheduled Ancient Monument.

After the wedding, the bride and groom rode a horse and carriage, leading a cort√®ge from Stockholm Palace along its outer courtyard, through the streets of Slottsbacken, Skeppsbron, Slottskajen, Norrbro, Regeringsgatan, Hamngatan, Nybroplan, Nybrokajen, Hovslagargatan, S√∂dra Blasieholmshamnen, Str√∂mbron and finally arriving at the Log√•rden of the Royal Palace. The Armed Forces paraded along the procession route and after arriving at Log√•rden, they gave the couple a 21-gun salute. On the balcony of the palace, Carl Philip gave a short speech to the assembled crowd of well-wishers, asserting that \\"Sweden is a warm country.\\" The King then \\"led the crowd in a traditional Swedish 'four cheers' for the couple.\\" The festivities continued with dinner in the White Sea Ballroom of Stockholm Palace and dancing in Karl XI's Gallery. Fredrik Eriksson, Mathias Dahlgren, Mark Aujalay, Henrik Norstr√∂m and Mattias Ljungberg were responsible for the wedding dinner. At the wedding banquet, King Carl Gustaf welcomed guests and toasted the couple. Music The ceremony featured classical music as well as a significant amount of popular music. The bride walked down the aisle to an instrumental version of Enya's \\"Athair ar Neamh\\". The hymns \\"Guds k√§rlek √§r som stranden\\" (God's love is like the beach) and \\"I denna ljuva sommartid\\" were played on the church organ and sung by the choir and guests. Al Fakir performed \\"Fix You\\" by Coldplay. A Swedish version of \\"Umbrella\\", called \\"Paraply\\", was performed by David Pagmar. The couple exited the church to a rendition of \\"Joyful, Joyful We Adore Thee\\" led by gospel vocalist Samuel Ljungblahd. The hymn contained an interpolation of Janet Jackson's \\"What Have You Done For Me Lately\\", like the version performed in the film Sister Act 2. Swedish musicians Avicii and Icona Pop performed at the wedding reception. Wedding cake The colourful wedding cake contained pop rocks (fizzing candy) as a surprise for the guests.

Biography  Background and early life Hatem was the son of Bahram Khan Ordubadi, the lord of Ordubad, the homeland of the Ordubadi family‚Äîan Iranian family which was descended from the medieval philosopher and polymath Nasir al-Din al-Tusi. Hatem later succeeded his father as the lord of Urdubad, and received the title of \\"Beg\\" (lord). Due to local disagreements, he resigned however, and went to the royal court. In the ensuing period he served as vizier of the governor of Khoy. However, when the latter was dismissed later on, Hatem Beg lost his job as well, and settled again in Ordubad and later Ardabil. His fortunes changed in the early rule of Abbas I, when he was appointed as the vizier of the governor of Kerman, Vali Beg Yuz Bashi Afshar and was later made the accountant (mostowfi al-mamalek) of Yazd. Vizierate under Shah Abbas I Shah Abbas I. In 1587-1588, Hatem's brother Abu Taleb Beg, then the mostowfi al-mamalek was sent as an envoy to the ruler of the Uzbeks, Abdullah Khan II, who was trying to take Herat from the Safavids at the time. Abdullah Khan II was not interested in negotiations, and had Abu Taleb Beg executed by putting him in front of the mouth of a cannon. As a result of this gruesome tale in relation to his close relative, Hatem Beg was taken under Abbas I's wings, and in 1591, he appointed him as the mostowfi al-mamalek of all of Iran, while six months later he made him his grand vizier. Hatem Beg, who became known by his honorific of Etemad-e daulat (\\"Trusty Support of the State\\"), which was given to every Safavid grand vizier, demonstrated to be a statesman of noteworthy capacity during his tenure as grand vizier. During his tenure he managed to form a highly potent state administration that allowed the country to persist to prosper under considerably less adept shahs after Abbas I's death. The Safavid court historian Iskandar Beg Munshi, who was attached to the retinue of Hatem Beg, states that he \\"brought security into the lives of Iranians\\" and \\"was a model for all in regard to the administration of justice, his knowledge of accounting procedures, and his organisation of divan affairs.\\" Hatem Beg was evenly held in high regard by the Europeans‚Äîthe Carmelite monk Father Paul Simon, recounted Hatem Beg's calmness in dealing with difficult tasks. He describes how Hatem Beg \\"used to despatch 200 petitions in a morning, and after having sat and given a hearing for six or seven hours would go out as serene as if he were coming from taking his horse for a walk.\\" Aside from his administrative responsibilities, Hatem Beg also distinguished him as a military commander in the consolidation of the country. It was unusual for a person of Iranian stock to be involved in military affairs‚Äîthe Iranian statesman Mirza Salman Jaberi, who had served as grand vizier from 1577 to 1583, had as a result of his involvement in military affairs made the Qizilbash hostile towards him, who felt that their power had been usurped. Mirza Salman Jaberi was eventually murdered by the Qizilbash. Hatem Beg's involvement in military affairs, however, did not arouse the antagonism of the Qizilbash, which, in the words of David Blow, was \\"a sign of changing times\\". In 1594/5, Hatem Beg, together with a group of administrators and accountants, were sent to the newly subdued province of Gilan, where they improved the structure of tax charge and contribution, which, supposedly, was done at the demand of the residents who were discontent with the oppressive governorship of Mehdi Qoli Khan Shamlu. More likely, however, this reform took place due to the economic capability the province offered‚Äîits rich silk manufacture, tea, caviar, and lumber encouraged Abbas I to dispatch his most prominent officers to overhaul the economic system of the province in a just approach. Death and offspring Hatem Beg died in 1610/1 near Urmia during an expedition‚Äîhe was buried in Mashhad. His son, Mirza Taleb Khan Ordubadi, succeeded him as grand vizier, occupying the office till 1621. He was reappointed as grand vizier during the reign of shah Safi (r. 1629‚Äì1642) from 1632 until 1633, where he was assassinated by the eunuch Saru Taqi, due to a personal hatred he had towards the Ordubadi family, the reason being that Hatem Beg had denied to give Saru Taqi's father a post which he had asked for.

Frederick is standing, Gustav is sitting to the left, and Charles is to the right. The painting is in the collection of the Swedish National Museum. The painting has Alexander Roslin's signature in French: Roslin √† Paris 1771. Roslin had settled in Paris in 1752; by the time he painted this triple portrait Roslin had already been living in Paris for nineteen years. He would remain there for the rest of his life. Portraits of the Swedish royal family Alexander Roslin ‚Äì Gustav III In the same year that Roslin moved to Paris, he was elected to be a member of the French Acad√©mie, a great honour for an artist from outside France. Roslin was commissioned to paint the portraits of numerous European aristocrats, not only in Paris but also from St. Petersburg, Bayreuth and Stockholm. Carrying out these commissions meant that he travelled widely for example, Roslin spent two years in the service of Catherine II in St Petersburg. Gustav III attracted artists to his court. Sweden's royal family were the patrons of Roslin and he maintained contacts with them throughout his career. A number of different compositions both half-length portraits of Gustav III, and portraits in full-figure were painted of the royal family by Roslin. He also painted numerous portraits of Swedes who visited Paris. Like a court painter, Roslin was able to vary the portraits of the same person giving them different attributes and accessories to give a varied air to the paintings. The 18th century was a period of regeneration and reconstruction in Sweden as the country had been devastated and weakened by the huge costs of King Charles XII's wars. Gustav III's role now was to consolidate the country. In another painting by Roslin he is depicted as an allegoric interpretation of his role as Sweden's \\"Hercules who will crush the Hydra of anarchy and discord.\\" Therefore, Gustav III was painted dressed in armour, the crown and wearing the grand star of the Order of the Seraphim, a Swedish royal order initiated by King Frederick I in 1748, only awarded to members of the royal family and foreign heads of state as well. These new commissions were promoting Roslin's career in France, since the new king was pleased with his works and gave him several new commissions. To this was added a new group portrait commissioned by the king, depicting the three royal brothers. The portrait of the three brothers Prince Frederick Adolf of Sweden, Frederick's single portrait Roslin was required to compose a group portrait in a new configuration, and he chose a triangular composition, with half-length portraits of the three princes seated round a table studying a plan of fortifications. The artist faced a difficulty, in that the princes had not sat all together at the same time for him. The prince, who would be crowned King Gustav III of Sweden, traveled to France on February 4, 1771 together with his brother Fredrick. Roslin had received the commission for the triple portrait a few months earlier, and had already depicted Karl (Charles XIII of Sweden) before he left the country prior to his brothers' arrival. New sittings now followed; in the mornings the Crown Prince and his younger brother participated in sittings held in Roslin's studio. By that time Roslin was already flooded with a series of royal commissions. Because none of the brothers sat together at the depicted table in reality, the trio look as if they are not interacting with each other, nor studying the plan. They are somewhat disconnectedly pointing to the plan on the table, but the weakness of this is counterbalanced with Roslin's eminent ability to render fabrics and his presentation of the subjects of his painting wearing colourful clothes. The elegant external appearances are depicted in a lifelike manner. However this was a portrait of princes, and thus demanded a decorum that dignified the models: \\"Gustav III and his brothers could hardly be portrayed as sweaty campaigners despite the gravity of their doings.\\" The painting is held by the Swedish National Museum. The presentation is seen as being conflicted by competing considerations and goals. This was part of a series of royal portraits wherein the brothers were depicted separately in different situations and accoutrement. The attire was changed for allegorical effect.

The following season found him at Rimini where he stayed for five seasons (1974‚Äì79) and led the team from D division to Serie A2. After saving the club from the drop, he joined Fabriano. In the 1981-82 season he helped the team to reach the top division (Serie A), while the following year he saved them from relegation. His successful job in Fabriano was recognized by Virtus Bologna who gave him charge of the club for the next two years (1983‚Äì85). At Bologna, he immediately led the Granarolo to their first golden star with the winning of the double (Italian League & Italian Cup) against the super competitive team of Simac Milano. His second year in Virtus was mediocre, reaching seventh place in the championship, while in the 1984‚Äì85 FIBA European Champions Cup they got to the top six where they came last in the group. Leaving the city of Bologna, he spent six years coaching in Serie A2 coaching, first at Enichem Livorno and then Glaxo Verona getting the unique achievement, the conquest of the Italian Cup (against Philips Milano) for the first and only time in history by club from A2 (1990‚Äì91). Following these successes he joined Scavolini Pesaro.

She was the subject of photographs by Dodgson and is often part of the contemporary discussion about Dodgson's relationship with young female children. She also acted as editor for a book of Dodgson's letters after his death called A Selection From The Letters Of Lewis Carroll To His Child-Friends. Early life Evelyn Maud Hatch was born in 1871 to Edwin and Evelyn Hatch. Edwin Hatch was a theologian; author; a vice-principal of St. Mary Hall, Oxford; and later a university reader in Ecclesiastical history. Evelyn had two sisters, being Beatrice and Ethel Charlotte, the latter presumably being named after her mother. She also had a brother named Arthur Herbert Hatch (b. 1864), who was House Prefect at his school, Malvern College. The Hatch family moved in \\"stimulating circles\\", including friendships with Edward Burne-Jones, Algernon Charles Swinburne and William Morris. The family lived in a Gothic-style house built in 1867 on Banbury Road in Norham Gardens, North Oxford, England. The house was described as having \\"arched windows, a tower, and a turret complete with a statue niche towards the top.\\" Neighborhood friends included Julia and Ethel Huxley, daughters of Thomas Henry Huxley and the aunts of Aldous Huxley. Other acquaintances in the neighborhood who visited the Hatch family included Bonamy Price, Mark Pattison, and Benjamin Jowett. Evelyn attended the Oxford High School, Oxford for girls, where she participated in extracurricular activities, including acting. In 1879, Evelyn acted in the school's production of A Midsummer Night's Dream, playing Cobweb, a fairie. Relationship with Dodgson Evelyn Hatch, as photographed by Dodgson on July 29, 1879. Colored by Anne Lydia Bond on Dodgson's instructions. Evelyn, along with her sisters, was introduced to Dodgson through mutual acquaintances. Dodgson cultivated \\"the friendship of many little girls\\", often photographing them. Dodgson's friendships with these children focused on upper-middle-class families, making sure \\"he did not seek very low-class children as friends.\\" Evelyn's family were of an upper middle class station and they became friends with Dodgson. Both Evelyn and her older sister Beatrice were muses of Dodgson who were each photographed clothed and nude. Their mother had given permission to Dodgson to photograph the girls and Dodgson was considered a family friend. Beatrice, rather than Evelyn, was considered the \\"long term favorite of Dodgson.\\" Dodgson's friendship with Evelyn continued for a number of years, however, lasting until his death when Evelyn was in adulthood. The photograph to the left was taken by Dodgson and is of Evelyn at age 8. Dodgson journaled about dreams he had of Evelyn, which author Kym Brindle dissects in her book Epistolary Encounters in Neo-Victorian Fiction: Diaries and Letters. He also gave Evelyn many gifts, including cards, a wind-up bear, fourteen musical boxes, trips to the theatre and other outings. It was not uncommon for Dodgson to take Evelyn on trips or other outings that lasted overnight or for a weekend. Adult life After their father died in 1889, Evelyn and her sisters were granted a pension from the government for his service. In 1897, Evelyn acted as a bridesmaid to Dorothy Maud Mary Kitchin, daughter of the Rev. George Kitchin and sister of Alexandra Kitchin. Dorothy married the Rev. John Lionel Shirley Dampier Bennett, M.A. at the Durham Cathedral on 7 October 1897. In 1927, Evelyn released a book she had written titled Burgundy: Past and Present. Burgundy was a historical tour of the Burgundy region of France, with the account being lauded as \\"readable, erudite, authoritative\\" and mentioned for covering out of the way places. After Dodgson's death and in her adulthood, Evelyn edited a book of Dodgson's letters called A Selection From The Letters Of Lewis Carroll To His Child-Friends. She also included notes throughout and an introduction. The New York Times also listed Hatch and her sister Beatrice in attendance at an event that the Carroll Foundation put on called \\"Alice 125\\". Evelyn in modern times The reclining photograph of Evelyn was included in Britain's Tate Gallery 2014 show called Exposed: The Victorian Nude. In R. Nichole Rougeau's 2005 dissertation, she writes of the gypsy photograph of Evelyn (upper right): \\"Evelyn symbolizes a form of the Blakean child, not really existing in the society depicted by the gypsy camp in the upper right of the photograph. Instead she is a part of the landscape, leaning against what could be interpreted as the tree of knowledge. She seeks knowledge about her sexuality and her eventual move away from the water of her youth to the society of the camp behind her. In calling her a ‚Äúgipsy‚Äù Carroll infers the child is in a perpetual state of movement, belonging neither to society nor completely to nature. He blurs her nipples and has her cross her legs again to hide genitalia and to suggest he is not commenting on the child‚Äôs reproductive ability, but her innocent sexuality. In picturing her this way, he strips her of her naturalness. She is not a true child, but a fictional one, Carroll‚Äôs ideal, the woman child who will never have sex.\\" References Category:1871 births Category:Lewis Carroll Category:1951 deaths Category:Place of birth missing ","title":"Evelyn Hatch"},{"id":"44914094","text":"Dyke Hard is a 2014 Swedish comedy film directed by Bitte Andersson.

The stop was located at the eastern edge of the Indiana Dunes State Park. It was established in 1977 on the initiative of South Shore Recreation, a citizens group, and closed in 1994.  History  The original Chicago, Lake Shore and South Bend Railway, which opened in 1908, included a stop named Keiser at the same location as Kemil Road. With the opening of the Indiana Dunes State Park in the 1920s Keiser was at the southeast corner of the park. The stop closed prior to 1977. That year, the newly formed South Shore Recreation group pressed the Chicago South Shore and South Bend Railroad to create a flag stop at Kemil Road to improve access to the park. Tremont station, further west, served the park's main entrance, but the Kemil Road location would let passengers directly into the park's interior. The railroad estimated the cost of the stop at $700 but initially refused to pay for it. After Lois Weisberg, one of the group's founders, wrote a personal check to cover the cost, the railroad agreed to pay in exchange for Weisberg moderating her public criticism of the railroad and its president, Albert Dudley. The new stop consisted of a gravel platform adjacent to the road. Contemporary marketing materials showed trail systems linking Kemil Road with Dune Acres, a station at the west edge of the park. The stop closed on July 5, 1994, as part of an NICTD service revision which also saw the closure of Ambridge, Willard Avenue, LaLumiere, Rolling Prairie, and New Carlisle.

Durmish Khan later died in 1525.  Biography  Durmish Khan was the son of Abdi Beg Shamlu, while his mother was a sister of shah Ismail I. Furthermore, Durmish Khan had a brother named Husayn Khan Shamlu. In 1503, Durmish Khan was appointed as the governor of Isfahan, but chose to stay in the Safavid capital of Tabriz and appointed Mirza Shah Husayn as his vizier. In 1514, while the Safavid forces were at Chaldiran and planning on how to confront the Ottomans, who had declared war against the Safavid Empire. Mohammad Khan Ustajlu, who served as the governor of Diyabakir, and Nur-Ali Khalifa, a commander who knew how the Ottomans fought, proposed that they should attack as quickly as possible. However, this proposal was rejected by Durmish Khan, who rudely said that Muhammad Khan Ustajlu was only interested in the province which he governed. The proposal was also rejected by Ismail himself, who said; \\"I am not a caravan-thief, whatever is decreed by God, will occur.\\" A battle shortly ensured, which, however, resulted in an absolute disaster for the Safavids, who lost most of their troops and commanders. In 1518/9, Durmish Khan suppressed several rebellions in Mazandaran, and later in 1520 he was sent to Baghdad to defend the city against the Ottoman sultan Selim I, who, however, died of sickness before he managed to reach the city. In 1521, Mirza Shah Husayn, who now served as Ismail's vizier and had become so powerful that he chose to send Durmish Khan far away from the Safavid court‚Äîto Herat in Khorasan, where he was forced to serve as its governor. When Durmish Khan arrived to the city, he appointed Ahmad Sultan Afshar as the governor of several districts of the province. In May 1522, the Mughal ruler Babur seized Qandahar from Durmish Khan. In 1523/4, Herat was attacked a by a group of Uzbeks, which Durmish Khan managed to repel. Durmish Khan later died in 1525 and was succeeded by his brother Husayn Khan Shamlu.

When this occurs, stretching the muscle will be severely painful, making it difficult to move the arm, and the strain may later be marked by swelling or bruising. The strain usually occurs due to the internal oblique muscle contracting suddenly from a stretched position. It may happen suddenly, or over time from regular repetitive activity. It is common in cricket players, and occurs on the opposite side of the arm that is used for bowling. The injury has also been reported in rowing, baseball and ice hockey and pool. The preferred treatment for a side strain is regular rest and inactivity on the affected muscle. With appropriate rest, regular activity on the muscle can occur between 4 and 6 weeks, though it may take longer.

History  Originally the site was part of an Augustinian order Cluniac monastery originating in 1254; the church was then dedicated to Santa Maria Maddalena in Valdipietra. The monastery later passed on to nuns, and later the Dominican order. In 1566, it housed the Servi di Maria, who named the church San Giuseppe. In 1810, the convent was suppressed. However, after Napoleon's defeat, in 1818, the Capuchin order, with 11 priests and 16 lay brothers, were granted the church and monastery. In 1865‚Äì1866, the Kingdom of Italy expropriated the site for military uses. In 1873, the church was reconsecrated, and the monastery reused in 1892. In 1926, in celebration of the 700th anniversary of St Francis, the field adjacent to the Piazza of the church was converted into a public garden, and a bronze statue of the Saint by Mario Sarto was erected. The convent suffered grievously during the Second World War, including the destruction of its once large library. In 1943, the church was named a sanctuary, and in 1959, made a parish church.Parish of San Giuseppe Sposo official site.  Museum  A museum, founded in 1928 by father Leonardo Montalti of Mercato Saraceno, is now hosted in the convent of the Frati Minori Cappuccini just outside Porta Saragozza. It collects works of art from various Capuchin order convents of the Emilia-Romagna region, including Ferrara, Porretta, Castel San Pietro, Imola, and Lugo. In the 1970s, the architect Leone Pancaldi rearranged the exhibition space, giving special prominence to the Crucifix by Marco Zoppo, by creating an apse for exhibition. Other major works are a Madonna of the Rose by Pietro Lianori; a Coronation of the Virgin by Jacopo di Paolo; an Adoration by the Magi by Flaminio Torri; a Crucifixion by the Passerotti brothers; a St Francis in Ecstasy by Bartolomeo Cesi; a Deposition of Christ by Gaetano Gandolfi; and two ovals with St Peter and Paul by Giuseppe Maria Crespi. The museum also has works of ivory and a large terracotta Madonna and child (1523), called Sedes Sapientiae by Zaccaria Zacchi; two wooden tabernacles from Lugo, one of them signed by Cesare Fabbri (1706); and some terracota nativity scenes, one by Rossetti.

It was created in August 1977. History The document of the Galician People's Union (UPG) The youth of the party, in February 1977, included the decision to create the UMG due to the increase in the number of supporters, members and activists of the UPG in high school or that were young workers. University students were already members of the Galician Revolutionary Students (ERGA). This led the party to the creation of a youth organization which, besides serving to bring to the Galician youth \\"a patriotic and communist political line\\", could address the youth particular issues and problems effectively. The creation of UMG was ratified in the 1st Congress of UPG in August 1977, few days after the UMG itself was officially founded. In the spring of 1977 a recruitment of militants was carried out, along with cell organization and theoretical and programmatic discussion. The constituent congress was held on the 14 and 15 August 1977, under the slogan \\"For a free and socialist Galiza\\". In that congress the UMG approved the statutes of the organization and a program that analyzed the specific situation of the Galician youth, the role of UMG that context and the alternatives that the organization should offer, including a table of \\"minimal demands\\". The UMG defined itself as the Patriotic and communist organization of Galiza and the youth wing of the Galician People's Union.Final document of the 1st congress of the Galician Youth Union. In 1989 the UMG participated in the creation of Galiza Nova, the youth wing of the Galician Nationalist Bloc (BNG). Since then, UMG has subordinated its political action to Galiza Nova, rarely doing solo acts. Since 1988, after the creation of Galiza Nova (BNG youth organization), UMG renounced to make public activity, focusing all their efforts in working for the BNG. Ideology Like the UPG, the UMG declares itself communist and nationalist, and believes that the establishment of socialism in Galiza necessarily passes by the previous national liberation of the country. Among Marxism the UMG follows the Marxist- Leninist ideology, although the organization also includes in their ideology the thought of the progressive Galician nationalists previous to the Spanish Civil War, like Castelao, Alexandre B√≥veda or Ram√≥n Su√°rez Picallo. The UMG also considers itself the continuation of the Federaci√≥n de Mocedades Galeguistas. Organization The first statutes of UMG, established democratic centralism as the main organizational principle. The organization is formed as a pyramidal organization, divided into zones and localities and defining cells as the basic fundamental core (called \\"Zone Assembly\\" since 1990). Local Committees and Area Committees are the intermediate direction bodies, while the Central Committee acts as the supreme body of the UMG between congresses and elected by (and in every) the National Congress. The Executive Committee is elected by the Central Committee. The highest governing body is the National Congress. Heading the UMG is the Secretary or general secretary, with executive functions.

Biography Born in Latvia on November 21, 1888, Linow began wrestling in the United States in 1918. Between 1918 and 1933, he participated in 92 matches, with a record of 38 wins and 23 losses. Linow's monikers in the ring were \\"the Cossack\\" and the \\"Russian Man-Eater\\". During his wrestling career, he faced other notable wrestlers of that era, such as Joe Stecher and Ed Lewis. Using his popularity as a wrestler, Linow entered the film industry during the 1920s, his first film being Cappy Ricks (1921). In his fifteen-year acting career, he appeared in over forty films in supporting and bit parts. While appearing in films, Linow continued his wrestling career. In his final match in July 1931, under the pseudonym Jack Leon, he defeated Young Sandow. Linow retired from films two years later, in 1935; his final film was The Black Room, starring Boris Karloff.

Beginning in the 1970s, he developed a progressively more coherent and empirically-grounded self-medication hypothesis of drug abuse, which states that individuals use drugs in an attempt to self-medicate states of distress and suffering. Dr. Khantzian is a first generation Armenian-American born in Haverhill Massachusetts. His parents were born in Turkey, his father immigrated to the United States in 1912. Khantzian's mother survived the Armenian genocide that started in 1915, moving to the U.S. in the late 1920s. Edward Khantzian was born in 1935 and grew up in Haverhill, a shoe town, where both parents worked in the then flourishing shoe industry. Educated in local school systems, he began his university studies in the Evening Divisions of Merrimack College and Boston University, graduating from the latter in 1958. After working as a technical writer for Raytheon for one year, he commenced his medical training at Albany Medical College in 1959, and graduated in 1963. He completed an internship at Rhode Island Hospital in Providence, Rhode Island. Subsequently, he commenced his training in psychiatry at the Massachusetts Mental Health Mental Center, a Harvard Medical School-affiliated facility. He joined the staff and Harvard teaching faculty at Cambridge Hospital, where he worked for most of his career. He completed psychoanalytic training at the Boston Psychoanalytic Society and Institute in 1973. Starting early in his career he became involved in multiple clinical and investigative studies of addiction, with an emphasis on pursuing a psychodynamic understanding of the psychological vulnerabilities that predispose to addictive disorders. Considered a pioneer in addiction studies, he gained recognition for his development of the self-medication hypothesis. He also developed modified psychodynamic individual and group treatments for alcohol and other drug dependent individuals, as well as exploring ingredients that seem to make 12-step programs effective. Khantzian is a founding member and past-president of the American Academy of Addiction Psychiatry. In 2016, the Massachusetts Psychiatric Society awarded Khantzian with their Lifetime Achievement Award.

He is first mentioned as serving the governor of Herat, Amir Khan Mawsillu, and later in 1516 fought against the Timurid prince Muhammad Zaman Mirza, who had captured Balkh. In 1520/1, Ahmad Sultan was appointed as the governor of Tus and Mashhad, but was after some time replaced by Burun Sultan. In 1522, the new governor of Herat, Durmish Khan Shamlu, appointed Ahmad Sultan as the governor of several districts.

Beneficial uses of the treated excreta may focus on using the plant-available nutrients (mainly nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium) that are contained in the treated excreta. They may also make use of the organic matter and energy contained in the excreta. To a lesser extent, reuse of the excreta's water content might also take place, although this is better known as water reclamation from municipal wastewater. The intended reuse applications for the nutrient content may include: soil conditioner or fertilizer in agriculture or horticultural activities. Other reuse applications, which focus more on the organic matter content of the excreta, include use as a fuel source or as an energy source in the form of biogas. There is a large and growing number of treatment options to make excreta safe and manageable for the intended reuse option. Some options include: Urine diversion and dehydration of feces (urine-diverting dry toilets), composting (composting toilets or external composting processes), sewage sludge treatment technologies and a range of fecal sludge treatment processes. They all achieve various degrees of pathogen removal and reduction in water content for easier handling. Pathogens of concern are enteric bacteria, virus, protozoa, and helminth eggs in feces. As the helminth eggs are the pathogens that are the most difficult to destroy with treatment processes, they are commonly used as an indicator organism in reuse schemes. Other health risks and environmental pollution aspects that need to be considered include spreading micropollutants, pharmaceutical residues and nitrate in the environment which could cause groundwater pollution and thus potentially affect drinking water quality. There are several \\"excreta-derived fertilizers\\" which vary in their properties and fertilizing characteristics, for example: urine, dried feces, composted feces, fecal sludge, sewage, sewage sludge, and animal manure. The nutrients and organic matter which are contained in human excreta or in domestic wastewater (sewage) have been used in agriculture in many countries for centuries. However, this practice is often carried out in an unregulated and unsafe manner in developing countries. World Health Organization Guidelines from 2006 have set up a framework how this reuse can be done safely by following a \\"multiple barrier approach\\".WHO (2006). WHO Guidelines for the Safe Use of Wastewater, Excreta and Greywater - Volume IV: Excreta and greywater use in agriculture. World Health Organization (WHO), Geneva, Switzerland Such barriers might be selecting a suitable crop, farming methods, methods of applying the fertilizer and education of the farmers.  Background  The resources available in wastewater and human excreta include water, plant nutrients, organic matter and energy content. Reuse of human excreta focuses on the nutrient and organic matter content of human excreta unlike reuse of wastewater which focuses on the water content. Sanitation systems that are designed for safe and effective recovery of resources can play an important role in a community's overall resource management. Recovering the resources embedded in excreta and wastewater (like nutrients, water and energy) contributes to achieving Sustainable Development Goal 6 and other sustainable development goals. The most common type of reuse of excreta is as fertilizer and soil conditioner in agriculture. This is also called a \\"closing the loop\\" approach for sanitation with agriculture. It is a central aspect of the ecological sanitation approach. An alternative term is also \\"use of human excreta\\" rather than \\"reuse\\" as strictly speaking it is the first use of human excreta, not the second time that it is used. It can be efficient to combine wastewater and human excreta with other organic waste such as manure, food and crop waste for the purposes of resource recovery.Andersson, K., Rosemarin, A., Lamizana, B., Kvarnstr√∂m, E., McConville, J., Seidu, R., Dickin, S. and Trimmer, C. (2016). Sanitation, Wastewater Management and Sustainability: from Waste Disposal to Resource Recovery. Nairobi and Stockholm: United Nations Environment Programme and Stockholm Environment Institute.  Multiple barrier concept for safe use in agriculture  Research into how to make reuse of urine and feces safe in agriculture was carried out in Sweden since the 1990s.Joensson, H., Richert Stintzing, A., Vinneras, B., Salomon, E. (2004). Guidelines on the Use of Urine and Faeces in Crop Production. Stockholm Environment Institute, Sweden In 2006 the World Health Organization (WHO) provided guidelines on safe reuse of wastewater, excreta and greywater. The multiple barrier concept to reuse, which is the key cornerstone of this publication, has led to a clear understanding of how excreta reuse can be done safely. The concept is also used in water supply and food production, and is generally understood as a series of treatment steps and other safety precautions to prevent the spread of pathogens. The degree of treatment required for excreta-based fertilizers before they can safely be used in agriculture depends on a number of factors. It mainly depends on which other barriers will be put in place according to the multiple barrier concept. Such barriers might be selecting a suitable crop, farming methods, methods of applying the fertilizer, education of the farmers, and so forth.Richert, A., Gensch, R., J√∂nsson, H., Stenstr√∂m, T., Dagerskog, L. (2010). Practical guidance on the use of urine in crop production. Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), Sweden For example, in the case of urine-diverting dry toilets (UDDTs) secondary treatment of dried feces can be performed at community level rather than at household level and can include thermophilic composting where fecal material is composted at over 50 ¬∞C, prolonged storage with the duration of 1.5 to two years, chemical treatment with ammonia from urine to inactivate the pathogens, solar sanitation for further drying or heat treatment to eliminate pathogens.Niwagaba, C. B. (2009). Treatment technologies for human faeces and urine. PhD thesis, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Uppsala, SwedenRieck, C., von M√ºnch, E., Hoffmann, H. (2012). Technology review of urine-diverting dry toilets (UDDTs) - Overview on design, management, maintenance and costs. Deutsche Gesellschaft fuer Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH, Eschborn, Germany  Treatment options  There is a large and growing number of treatment options to make excreta safe and manageable for the intended reuse option. Various technologies and practices, ranging in scale from a single rural household to a city, can be used to capture potentially valuable resources and make them available for safe, productive uses that support human well-being and broader sustainability. Some treatment options are listed below but there are many more: * Urine diversion and dehydration of feces (which is done with urine- diverting dry toilets) * Composting (composting toilets or external composting processes) *Sewage sludge treatment technologies, which is installed downstream of various wastewater treatment technologies * Fecal sludge treatment processes, such as sludge drying beds, constructed wetlands. * Anaerobic digestion with biogas production * Waste-to-energy process * Omni Processor  Reuse options  Reuse options depend on the form of the excreta that is being reused: it can be either excreta on its own or mixed with some water (fecal sludge) or mixed with much water (domestic wastewater or sewage). The most common types of excreta reuse include: * Fertilizer and irrigation water in agriculture, and horticulture: for example using recovered and treated water for irrigation; using composted excreta (and other organic waste) or appropriately treated biosolids as fertilizer and soil conditioner; using treated source-separated urine as fertilizer. * Energy: for example digesting feces and other organic waste to produce biogas; or producing combustible fuels. * Other: other emerging excreta reuse options include producing protein feeds for livestock using black soldier fly larvae, recovering organic matter for use as building materials or in paper production. Resource recovery from fecal sludge can take many forms, including as a fuel, soil amendment, building material, protein, animal fodder, and water for irrigation.  Comparison to other fertilizers  Comparison of spinach field with (left) and without (right) compost, experiments at the SOIL farm in Port-au-Prince, Haiti There is an untapped fertilizer resource in human excreta. In Africa, for example, the theoretical quantities of nutrients that can be recovered from human excreta are comparable with all current fertilizer use on the continent. Therefore, reuse can support increased food production and also provide an alternative to chemical fertilizers, which is often unaffordable to small-holder farmers. However, nutritional value of human excreta largely depends on dietary input. Mineral fertilizers are made from mining activities and can contain heavy metals. Phosphate ores contain heavy metals such as cadmium and uranium, which can reach the food chain via mineral phosphate fertilizer.Kratz, S. (2004) Uran in D√ºngemitteln (in German). Uran-Umwelt-Unbehagen: Statusseminar am 14. Oktober 2004, Bundesforschungsinstitut f√ºr Landwirtschaft (FAL), Institut f√ºr Pflanzenern√§hrung und Bodenkunde, Germany. This does not apply to excreta- based fertilizers, which is an advantage. In intensive agricultural land use, animal manure is often not used as targeted as mineral fertilizers, and thus, the nitrogen utilization efficiency is poor. Animal manure can become a problem in terms of excessive use in areas of intensive agriculture with high numbers of livestock and too little available farmland. Fertilizing elements of organic fertilizers are mostly bound in carbonaceous reduced compounds. If these are already partially oxidized as in the compost, the fertilizing minerals are adsorbed on the degradation products (humic acids) etc. Thus, they exhibit a slow-release effect and are usually less rapidly leached compared to mineral fertilizers.  Peak phosphorus  In the case of phosphorus in particular, reuse of excreta is one known method to recover phosphorus to mitigate the looming shortage (also known as \\"peak phosphorus\\") of economical mined phosphorus. Mined phosphorus is a limited resource that is being used up for fertilizer production at an ever-increasing rate, which is threatening worldwide food security. Therefore, phosphorus from excreta-based fertilizers is an interesting alternative to fertilizers containing mined phosphate ore.Soil Association (2010). A rock and a hard place - Peak phosphorus and the threat to our food security. Soil Association, Bristol, UK  As fertilizer   Urine  Application of urine on a field near Bonn, Germany, by means of flexible hose close to the soil Basil plants: The plants on the right are not fertilized, while the plants on the left are fertilized with urine - in a nutrient-poor soil Application of urine on eggplants during a comprehensive urine application field testing study at Xavier University, Philippines Urine is primarily composed of water and urea. It contains large quantities of nitrogen (N) (mostly as urea), as well as reasonable quantities of dissolved potassium. The nutrient concentrations in urine vary with diet. In particular, nitrogen content in urine is related to quantity of protein in the diet: A high protein diet results in high urea levels in urine. Urine's eight main ionic species (> 0.1 meq L‚àí1) are cations Na, K, NH4, Ca and the anions, Cl, SO4, PO4 and HCO3. Urine typically contains 70% of the nitrogen and more than half the potassium found in sewage, while making up less than 1% of the overall volume. Urine fertilizer is usually applied diluted with water because undiluted urine can chemically burn the leaves or roots of some plants, particularly if the soil moisture content is low. The dilution also helps to reduce odor development following application. Applying urine as fertilizer has been called \\"closing the cycle of agricultural nutrient flows\\" or ecological sanitation or ecosan. When diluted with water (at a 1:5 ratio for container-grown annual crops with fresh growing medium each season or a 1:8 ratio for more general use), it can be applied directly to soil as a fertilizer. The fertilization effect of urine has been found to be comparable to that of commercial nitrogen fertilizers. Urine may contain pharmaceutical residues (environmental persistent pharmaceutical pollutants). The more general limitations to using urine as fertilizer depend mainly on the potential for buildup of excess nitrogen (due to the high ratio of that macronutrient), and inorganic salts such as sodium chloride, which are also part of the wastes excreted by the renal system. Over-fertilization with urine or other nitrogen fertilizers can result in too much ammonia for plants to absorb, acidic conditions, or other phytotoxicity. Important parameters to consider while fertilizing with urine include salinity tolerance of the plant, soil composition, addition of other fertilizing compounds, and quantity of rainfall or other irrigation. It was reported in 1995 that urine nitrogen gaseous losses were relatively high and plant uptake lower than with labelled ammonium nitrate. In contrast, phosphorus was utilized at a higher rate than soluble phosphate. Human urine can be collected with sanitation systems that utilize urinals or urine diversion toilets. If urine is to be collected for use as a fertilizer in agriculture, then the easiest method of doing so is (in increasing order of costs) by using waterless urinals, urine-diverting dry toilets (UDDTs) or urine diversion flush toilets. The risks of using urine as a natural source of agricultural fertilizer are generally regarded as negligible or acceptable. There are potentially more environmental problems (such as eutrophication resulting from the influx of nutrient rich effluent into aquatic or marine ecosystems) and a higher energy consumption when urine is treated as part of sewage in wastewater treatment plants compared with when it is used directly as a fertilizer resource. In developing countries, the use of raw sewage or fecal sludge has been common throughout history, yet the application of pure urine to crops is rare. There are increasing calls for urine's use as a fertilizer.Mara Grunbaum Human urine is shown to be an effective agricultural fertilizer, Scientific American, July 2010. Retrieved on 2011-12-07. Since about 2011, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is providing research funding sanitation systems that recover the nutrients in urine.von Muench, E., Spuhler, D., Surridge, T., Ekane, N., Andersson, K., Fidan, E. G., Rosemarin, A. (2013). Sustainable Sanitation Alliance members take a closer look at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation‚Äôs sanitation grants. Sustainable Sanitation Practice (SSP) Journal, Issue 17, EcoSan Club, Austria  Examples  * In Tororo District in eastern Uganda - a region with severe land degradation problems - smallholder farmers appreciated urine fertilization as a low-cost, low-risk practice. They found that it could contribute to significant yield increases. The importance of social norms and cultural perceptions needs to be recognized but is not absolute barriers to adoption of the practice.  Dried feces  Reuse of dried feces (feces) from urine-diverting dry toilets (UDDTs) after post-treatment can result in increased crop production through fertilizing effects of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and improved soil fertility through organic carbon.  Composted feces  Cabbage grown in excreta-based compost (left) and without soil amendments (right), SOIL in Haiti Compost derived from composting toilets (where organic kitchen waste is in some cases also added to the composting toilet) has, in principle, the same uses as compost derived from other organic waste products, such as sewage sludge or municipal organic waste. One limiting factor may be legal restrictions due to the possibility that pathogens remain in the compost. In any case, the use of compost from composting toilets in one's own garden can be regarded as safe and is the main method of use for compost from composting toilets. Hygienic measures for handling of the compost must be applied by all those people who are exposed to it, e.g. wearing gloves and boots. Some of the urine will be part of the compost although some urine will be lost via leachate and evaporation. Urine can contain up to 90 percent of the nitrogen, up to 50 percent of the phosphorus, and up to 70 percent of the potassium present in human excreta.J.O. Drangert, Urine separation systems The nutrients in compost from a composting toilet have a higher plant availability than the product (dried feces) from a urine-diverting dry toilet.Berger, W. (2011). Technology review of composting toilets - Basic overview of composting toilets (with or without urine diversion). Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH, Eschborn, Germany  Fecal sludge  Fecal sludge (also called septage) is defined as \\"coming from onsite sanitation technologies, and has not been transported through a sewer.\\" Examples of onsite technologies include pit latrines, unsewered public ablution blocks, septic tanks and dry toilets. Fecal sludge can be treated by a variety of methods to render it suitable for reuse in agriculture. These include (usually carried out in combination) dewatering, thickening, drying (in sludge drying beds), composting, pelletization, and anaerobic digestion.  Municipal wastewater  Reclaimed water can be reused for irrigation, industrial uses, replenishing natural water courses, water bodies, aquifers and other potable and non-potable uses. These applications, however, focus usually on the water aspect, not on the nutrients and organic matter reuse aspect, which is the focus of \\"reuse of excreta\\". When wastewater is reused in agriculture, its nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) content may be useful for additional fertilizer application. Work by the International Water Management Institute and others has led to guidelines on how reuse of municipal wastewater in agriculture for irrigation and fertilizer application can be safely implemented in low income countries.  Sewage sludge  The use of treated sewage sludge (after treatment also called \\"biosolids\\") as a soil conditioner or fertilizer is possible but is a controversial topic in some countries (such as USA, some countries in Europe) due to the chemical pollutants it may contain, such as heavy metals and environmental persistent pharmaceutical pollutants. Northumbrian Water in the United Kingdom uses two biogas plants to produce what the company calls \\"poo power\\" - using sewage sludge to produce energy to generate income. Biogas production has reduced its pre 1996 electricity expenditure of 20 million GBP by about 20%. Severn Trent and Wessex Water also have similar projects.  Sludge treatment liquids  Sludge treatment liquids (after anaerobic digestion) can be used as an input source for a process to recover phosphorus in the form of struvite for use as fertilizer. For example, the Canadian company Ostara Nutrient Recovery Technologies is marketing a process based on controlled chemical precipitation of phosphorus in a fluidized bed reactor that recovers struvite in the form of crystalline pellets from sludge dewatering streams. The resulting crystalline product is sold to the agriculture, turf and ornamental plants sectors as fertilizer under the registered trade name \\"Crystal Green\\".  Animal manure  Animal dung (manure) has been used for centuries as a fertilizer for farming, as it improves the soil structure (aggregation), so that it holds more nutrients and water and becomes more fertile. Animal manure also encourages soil microbial activity, which promotes the soil's trace mineral supply, improving plant nutrition. It also contains some nitrogen and other nutrients that assist the growth of plants.  Health and environmental aspects of agricultural use   Pathogens  Gardeners of Fada N'Gourma in Burkina Faso apply dry excreta after mixing with other organic fertilizer (donkey manure, cow manure) and pure fertile soil, and after maturing for another 2 to 4 months  Risk management  Exposure of farm workers to untreated excreta constitutes a significant health risk due to its pathogen content. There can be a large amount of enteric bacteria, virus, protozoa, and helminth eggs in feces. This risk also extends to consumers of crops fertilized with untreated excreta. Therefore, excreta needs to be appropriately treated before reuse, and health aspects need to be managed for all reuse applications as the excreta can contain pathogens even after treatment.  Treatment of excreta for pathogen removal  The treatment of excreta and wastewater for pathogen removal can take place: * at the toilet itself (for example, urine collected from urine-diverting dry toilets is often treated by simple storage at the household level); or * at a semi-centralized level (for example, by composting); or * at a fully centralized level at sewage treatment plants and sewage sludge treatment plants.  Indicator organisms  As an indicator organism in reuse schemes, helminth eggs are commonly used as these organisms are the most difficult to destroy in most treatment processes. The multiple barrier approach is recommended where e.g. lower levels of treatment may be acceptable when combined with other post- treatment barriers along the sanitation chain.  Pharmaceutical residues  Excreta from humans and farmed animals contain hormones and pharmaceutical residues which could in theory enter the food chain via fertilized crops but are currently not fully removed by conventional wastewater treatment plants anyway and can enter drinking water sources via household wastewater (sewage).von M√ºnch, E., Winker, M. (2011). Technology review of urine diversion components - Overview on urine diversion components such as waterless urinals, urine diversion toilets, urine storage and reuse systems. Gesellschaft f√ºr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH In fact, the pharmaceutical residues in the excreta are degraded better in terrestrial systems (soil) than in aquatic systems.  Nitrate pollution  Only a fraction of the nitrogen-based fertilizers is converted to produce and other plant matter. The remainder accumulates in the soil or lost as run-off. This also applies to excreta-based fertilizer since it also contains nitrogen. Excessive nitrogen which is not taken up by plants is transformed into nitrate which is easily leached. High application rates combined with the high water- solubility of nitrate leads to increased runoff into surface water as well as leaching into groundwater. Nitrate levels above 10 mg/L (10 ppm) in groundwater can cause 'blue baby syndrome' (acquired methemoglobinemia). The nutrients, especially nitrates, in fertilizers can cause problems for natural habitats and for human health if they are washed off soil into watercourses or leached through soil into groundwater.  Other uses Apart from use in agriculture, there are other possible uses of excreta. For example, in the case of fecal sludge, it can be treated and then serve as protein (black soldier fly process), fodder, fish food, building materials and biofuels (biogas from anaerobic digestion, incineration or co-combustion of dried sludge, pyrolysis of fecal sludge, biodiesel from fecal sludge).  Solid fuel, heat, electricity  Dry animal dung is used as a fuel in many countries around the world. Pilot scale research in Uganda and Senegal has shown that it is viable to use dry feces as for combustion in industry, provided it has been dried to a minimum of 28% dry solids. Dried sewage sludge can be burned in sludge incineration plants and generate heat and electricity (the waste-to-energy process is one example). Resource recovery of fecal sludge as a solid fuel has been found to have high market potential in Sub- Saharan Africa.  Hydrogen fuel  Urine has also been investigated as a potential source of hydrogen fuel. Urine was found to be a suitable wastewater for high rate hydrogen production in a Microbial Electrolysis Cell (MEC).  Biogas  Small-scale biogas plants are being utilized in many countries, including Ghana, Vietnam and many others.1 Larger centralized systems are being planned that mix animal and human feces to produce biogas. Biogas is also produced during sewage sludge treatment processes with anaerobic digestion. Here, it can be used for heating the digesters and for generating electricity. Biogas is an important waste-to-energy resource which plays a huge role in reducing environmental pollution and most importantly in reducing greenhouse gases effect caused by the waste. Utilization of raw material such as human waste for biogas generation is considered beneficial because it does not require additional starters such as microorganism seeds for methane production, and a supply of microorganisms occurs continuously during the feeding of raw materials.  Food source to produce protein for animal feed  Pilot facilities are being developed for feeding Black Soldier Fly larvae with feces. The mature flies would then be a source of protein to be included in the production of feed for chickens in South Africa. Black soldier fly (BSF) bio-waste processing is a relatively new treatment technology that has received increasing attention over the last decades. Larvae grown on bio-waste can be a necessary raw material for animal feed production , and can therefore provide revenues for financially applicable waste management systems. In addition, when produced on bio-waste, insect-based feeds can be more sustainable than conventional feeds. Building materials It is known that additions of fecal matter up to 20% by dried weight in clay bricks does not make a significant functional difference to bricks.  Precious metals recovery  A Japanese sewage treatment facility extracts precious metals from sewage sludge. This idea was also tested by the US Geological Survey (USGS) which found that the sewage sludge generated by 1 million people contained 13 million dollars worth of precious metals.  History  The reuse of excreta as a fertilizer for growing crops has been practiced in many countries for a long time.  Society and culture   Economics  Debate is ongoing about whether reuse of excreta is cost effective. The terms \\"sanitation economy\\" and \\"toilet resources\\" have been introduced to describe the potential for selling products made from human feces or urine.  Sale of compost  The NGO SOIL in Haiti began building urine-diverting dry toilets and composting the waste produced for agricultural use in 2006.Christine Dell'Amore, \\"Human Waste to Revive Haitian Farmland?\\", The National Geographic, October 26, 2011 SOIL's two composting waste treatment facilities currently transform over 20,000 gallons (75,708 liters) of human excreta into organic, agricultural-grade compost every month.Jonathan Hera, \\"Haiti Non-Profit Plumbs Solutions to World's Unmet Sanitation Needs\\", \\"The Globe and the Mail\\", November 14, 2014 The compost produced at these facilities is sold to farmers, organizations, businesses, and institutions around the country to help finance SOIL's waste treatment operations.Kramer, S., Preneta, N., Kilbride, A. (2013). Two papers from SOIL presented at the 36th WEDC International Conference, Nakuru, Kenya, 2013. SOIL, Haiti Crops grown with this soil amendment include spinach, peppers, sorghum, maize, and more. Each batch of compost produced is tested for the indicator organism E. coli to ensure that complete pathogen kill has taken place during the thermophilic composting process.Erica Lloyd, \\"Safety First: The New and Improved SOIL Lab\\", \\"SOIL blog\\", February 2, 2014  Policies  There is still a lack of examples of implemented policy where the reuse aspect is fully integrated in policy and advocacy.SEI (2009). Sanitation policies and regulatory frameworks for reuse of nutrients in wastewater, human excreta and greywater - Proceedings from SEI/EcoSanRes2 Workshop in Sweden. Stockholm Environment Institute, Sweden When considering drivers for policy change in this respect, the following lessons learned should be taken into consideration: Revising legislation does not necessarily lead to functioning reuse systems; it is important to describe the ‚Äúinstitutional landscape‚Äù and involve all actors; parallel processes should be initiated at all levels of government (i.e. national, regional and local level); country specific strategies and approaches are needed; and strategies supporting newly developed policies need to be developed).  Regulatory considerations  Regulations such as Global Good Agricultural Practices may hinder export and import of agricultural products that have been grown with the application of human excreta-derived fertilisers.Elisabeth Kvarnstr√∂m, Linus Dagerskog, Anna Norstr√∂m and Mats Johansson (2012) Nutrient reuse as a solution multiplier (SIANI policy brief 1.1), A policy brief by the SIANI Agriculture-Sanitation Expert Group, Sweden  Urine use in organic farming in Europe  The European Union (EU) only allows the use of source separated urine in conventional farming within the EU, but not yet in organic farming. This is a situation that many agricultural experts, especially in Sweden, would like to see changed. This ban may also reduce the options to use urine as a fertilizer in other countries if they wish to export their products to the EU.  Dried feces from UDDTs in the U.S.  In the United States, the EPA regulation governs the management of sewage sludge but has no jurisdiction over the byproducts of a urine-diversion dry toilet (UDDT). Oversight of these materials falls to the states.  Country examples   China  Treatment disposal of human excreta can be categorized into three types and these are manure use, discharge and biogas use. Discharge is the disposal of human excreta to soil, septic tank or water body. In China, with the impact of the long tradition, human excreta is often used as fertilizer for crops. The main application methods are direct usage for crops and fruits as basal or top application after fermentation in a ditch for a certain period, compost with crop stalk for basal application and direct usage as feed for fish in ponds. On the other hand, as much as many people rely on human waste as an agricultural fertilizer, if the waste is not properly treated, the use of night soil may promote the spread of infectious diseases.  Kenya  In Mukuru, Kenya, the slum dwellers are worst hit by the sanitation challenge due to a high population density and a lack of supporting infrastructure. Makeshift pit latrines, illegal toilet connections to the main sewer systems and lack of running water to support the flushable toilets present a sanitation nightmare in all Kenyan slums. The NGO Sanergy seeks to provide decent toilet facilities to Mukuru residents and uses the feces and urine from the toilets to provide manure and energy for the market.Likoko, E. (2013) Ecological Management of Human Excreta in an Urban Slum: A case study of Mukuru in Kenya. Master thesis in Sustainable Development at Uppsala University, Department of Earth Sciences, Uppsala University, Sweden, No. 148, 41 pp.  Uganda  Reuse of wastewater in agriculture is a common practice in the developing world. In a study in Kampala, although famers were not using fecal sludge, 8% of farmers were using wastewater sludge as a soil amendment. Compost from animal manure and composted household waste are applied by many farmers as soil conditioners. On the other hand, farmers are already mixing their own feed because of limited trust in the feed industry and the quality of products. Electricity demand is significantly more than the electricity generation and only a small margin of the population nationally has access to electricity. The pellets produced from fecal sludge are being used in gasification for electricity production. Converting fecal sludge for energy could contribute towards meeting present and future energy needs.  Ghana  In Ghana, the only wide scale implementation is small scale rural digesters, with about 200 biogas plants using human excreta and animal dung as feedstock. Linking up of public toilets with biogas digesters as a way of improving communal hygiene and combating hygiene-related communicable diseases including cholera and dysentery is also a notable solution within Ghana.

He was Prince (batoni) of Mukhrani and ex officio commander of the Banner of Shida Kartli and Grand Master of the Household (msakhurt-ukhutsesi) at the court of Kartli from 1756 to 1778.  Career  Svimon was a son of Levan, Prince of Mukhrani, and a certain Princess Elene. He acceded to the titles and possessions of his father in 1756, in the reign of King Teimuraz II of Kartli, succeeding on the death of his relative, Constantine III, Prince of Mukhrani, whose heirs were in their minority. He was further appointed by Teimuraz as nasakhchibashi, \\"Lord High Executioner\\", the office which gave rise to his moniker, Svimon the nasakhchibashi (·É°·Éï·Éò·Éõ·Éù·Éú ·Éú·Éê·É°·Éê·ÉÆ·É©·Éò·Éë·Éê·É®·Éò). During the 1768‚Äì74 war between the Russian and Ottoman empires, in which the Georgians allied themselves with the Russians, Prince Svimon contributed to the victory of Teimuraz II's son and successor, King Heraclius II of Georgia at Aspindza in April 1770. During the campaign, Heraclius was abandoned by his ally, the Russian general Count Totleben, and the Georgian forces had to confront a larger Turkish-Lesgian army. The night before the battle Prince Svimon led some two dozen men and clandestinely dismantled the only bridge across the river, stranding the enemy forces on the riverbank and allowing Heraclius to win a decisive victory. In 1778, a change in political climate forced Prince Svimon to abdicate in favor of his nephew, Ioane, and retire to Russia.  Family  Prince Svimon was married twice, first to a certain Tamar and secondly to Ana (1733‚Äì1823), probably a daughter of Prince Alexander of Kartli. He had the following children: * Prince Katsia (c. 1764 ‚Äì 1826), who had two sons.

His tenure lasted from 1274 to his death in either 1279 or 1282. Family background Rinchen Gyaltsen was born in 1238 as the son of Zangtsa Sonam Gyaltsen and his wife Jomo Dro.Shoju Inaba, 'The lineage of the Sa skya pa: A chapter of the Red Annals', Memoirs of the Research Department of the Toyo Bunko 22 1963, 109. His father belonged to the Khon family, members of which were hereditary abbot-rulers of the Sakya Monastery in Tsang in western Tibet. In the time of his uncle, the abbot Sakya Pandita (1182-1251), Sakya became brokers between the various Tibetan petty lords and the Mongol power. Rinchen Gyaltsen's elder half-brother Phagpa enjoyed a close relationship with Kublai Khan and was appointed to the title Imperial Preceptor (Dishi) in 1270. As such he was a standing institution in the Yuan government, enjoying extraordinary honours and resources.Luciano Petech, Central Tibet and the Mongols: The Y√ºan-Sa-skya period of Tibetan history. Rome 1990, pp. 22-3, 33-4. The Dishi had a paramount influence on the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs (Zongzhi Yuan, later Xuanzheng Yuan). Meanwhile another brother, Chakna Dorje, was the viceroy of Tibet from 1264 to 1267.Luciano Petech 1990, pp. 19-20. Tenure as Imperial Preceptor Rinchen Gyaltsen served for a time as chaplain (lacho) to Kublai Khan. However, when his brother Chakna Dorje died in 1267, this led to serious unrest as the important Drigung Monastery tried to push back the position of Sakya. When his other brother Phagpa left Sakya and temporarily settled in Amdo in the same year, Rinchen Gyaltsen took over as a \\"quasi-abbot\\" (dansa tawu) of the Sakya Monastery.Luciano Petech 1990, pp. 20-1. Phagpa arrived to the imperial court in Beijing in 1370 and was appointed Dishi (Imperial Preceptor); however, he renounced the title in 1274 in order to return to Sakya. Instead, Rinchen Gyaltsen was summoned the court to fill the post in the same year. As imperial preceptor he resided in the palace compound Metog Rawa (Flowery Enclosure), as his brother had done. There he gathered a community of clerics.Luciano Petech 1990, p. 23. During his tenure the worldly affairs of Tibet were handled by a succession of administrators in Sakya, called dpon-chen (ponchen). They were: * Shakya Zangpo (c. 1264-1270) * Kunga Zangpo (c. 1270-1275) * Zhangtsun (c. 1275-?) * Chukpo Gangkarwa (?-1280)Luciano Petech 1990, p. 144. Rinchen Gyaltsen died in Shingkun (Lintao) at an uncertain date, most probably 24 March 1279. According to another chronicle he died as late as 1282, which seems to be incorrect.Luciano Petech 1990, p. 23; Shoju Inaba 1963, p. 109.

It is an unstable orange or brown substance that can be isolated only at low temperatures. Above , thioacetone readily converts to a polymer and a trimer, trithioacetone. It has an extremely potent, unpleasant odour, hence thioacetone has been considered as the worst-smelling chemical. Thioacetone was first obtained in 1889 by Baumann and Fromm, as a minor impurity in their synthesis of trithioacetone.William H. Sharkey (1979): \\"Polymerization through the carbon-sulfur double bond\\". Polymerization, series Advances in Polymer Science, volume 17, pages 73-103. Preparation Thioacetone is usually obtained by cracking the cyclic trimer trithioacetone, [(CH3)2CS]3. The trimer is prepared by pyrolysis of allyl isopropyl sulfide or by treating acetone with hydrogen sulfide in the presence of a Lewis acid. Note: This early report mistakes the trimer for the monomer The trimer cracks at to give the thione. :220px Polymerization Unlike its oxygen analogue, acetone which does not polymerise easily, thioacetone spontaneously polymerizes even at very low temperatures, pure or dissolved in ether or ethylene oxide, yielding a white solid that is a varying mixture of a linear polymer ¬∑¬∑¬∑‚Äì‚Äì¬∑¬∑¬∑ and the cyclic trimer trithioacetone. Infrared absorption of this product occurs mainly at 2950, 2900, 1440, 1150, 1360, and 1375 cm‚àí1 due to the geminal methyl pairs, and at 1085 and 643 cm‚àí1 due to the C‚ÄìS bond. The NMR spectra shows a single peak at x = 8.1. The mean molecular weight of the polymer varies from 2000 to 14000 depending on the preparation method, temperature, and presence of the thioenol tautomer. The polymer melts in the range of about 70 ¬∞C to 125 ¬∞C. Polymerization is promoted by free radicals and light. The cyclic trimer of thioacetone (trithioacetone) is a white or colorless compound with a melting point of , near room temperature. It also has a disagreeable odor. Odor Thioacetone has an intensely foul odor. Like many low molecular weight organosulfur compounds, the smell is potent and can be detected even when highly diluted. In 1889, an attempt to distill the chemical in the German city of Freiburg was followed by cases of vomiting, nausea and unconsciousness in an area with a radius of around the laboratory due to the smell. British chemists at the Whitehall Soap Works in Leeds noted in an 1890 report that dilution seemed to make the smell worse and described the smell as \\"fearful\\". Thioacetone is considered a dangerous chemical due to its extremely foul odor and ability to render people unconscious, induce vomiting, and be detected over long distances. In 1967, Esso researchers repeated the experiment of cracking trithioacetone, at a laboratory south of Oxford, UK. They reported their experience as follows: See also * Thiobenzophenone, a thioketone that can be isolated as a solid * Bromoacetone * Chloroacetone * Fluoroacetone * Iodoacetone References External links * Thioacetone, NIST * Trithioacetone, Aldrich Category:Thioketones Category:Foul-smelling chemicals ","title":"Thioacetone"},{"id":"44915522","text":"Charles Delbarre (born 1886, date of death unknown) was a Belgian sports shooter.

Origins  Mohammad Beg was born in Tabriz to an Armenian family, which originally served as a ghulƒÅm (\\"military slave\\") of the Safavid dynasty of Iran, but later became tailors. Mohammad Beg's father was Husayn Beg Tabrizi, who served as the court master tailor (qaychachi-bashi) during the reign of Shah Safi (r. 1629‚Äì1642).  Biography  Mohammad Beg is first mentioned in 1643, when he was appointed as the city prefect of New Julfa, a quarter in the Safavid capital of Isfahan, which was populated by Armenians. During this period, Mohammad Beg was supported by another officer of Armenian origin named Allahverdi Khan (not be confused with the powerful military officer Allahverdi Khan, who was of Georgian origin). In 1646, Mohammad Beg was appointed as the port-master/harbourmaster (shahbandar) of Bandar Abbas. Two years later, he was appointed as the \\"controller of assay\\" (mu'ayyir al- mamalik). With the help of Allahverdi Khan, Mohammad Beg became the steward of the royal household (nazer-e boyutat) in 1651, thus succeeding Mohammad Ali Beg. One year later, Mohammad Beg was appointed as the governor of Kohgiluyeh. However, during the same year, Mohammad Beg's relations with Allahverdi Khan became bad, and the two became rivals. In 1654, Mohammad Beg was appointed by shah Abbas II as his grand vizier. One of his first acts was dismissing the Georgian prefect of Isfahan, Parsadan Gorgijanidze, due to his unpopularity among the inhabitants of the city. Mohammad Beg also had the empire more centralized by converting more land into the crown domain (Hamadan in 1654, Ardabil in 1656/7, Semnan in 1656/7 and Kerman in 1658). In 1661, Mohammad Beg, after having failed to diminish the power of his rivals, was forced to resign from the grand vizier office. He was then exiled to Qom. In 1672, shah Suleiman I (r. 1666‚Äì1694) offered Mohammad Beg to become grand vizier once again, which he agreed to, but while on his way to Isfahan, he died. According to the French traveler Jean Chardin, Mohammad Beg had been poisoned by Suleiman's grand vizier Shaykh Ali Khan Zangana.  Family  Mohammad Beg had a son named Amin Beg, who would later serve as the mu'ayyir al-mamalik in Isfahan. Mohammad Beg's two brothers, Ughan Beg and Husayn Beg, both served as the shahbandar of Bandar Abbas. Their uncle, Shamshir Beg, also served in the office, and was succeeded by Mohammad Beg's cousin Isa Khan Beg. When Mohammad Beg was appointed as the nazer-e boyutat in 1651, he gave his previous office, mu'ayyir al-mamalik, to one of his other brother, Hasan Beg. Furthermore, when Mohammad Beg was appointed grand vizier, he appointed Hasan Beg as the qaychachi-bashi. Furthermore, one of Mohammad Beg's nephews served as the vizier of the governor of Gilan. During most of the reign of Abbas II, all of silver and silk commerce was controlled by the family of Mohammad Beg.

He hailed from Sakya, the foremost monastic regime in Tibet in this period, and held the title from 1286 to 1291. Sakya and the Sharpa lineage In the course of the 13th century, the Sakya abbots Sakya Pandita and Phagpa forged a working relationship with the Mongol conquerors, becoming their agents in Tibetan affairs. In 1270, Phagpa was appointed Imperial Preceptor (Dishi) by Kublai Khan. This office was not merely religious but also political: the Dishi exerted a paramount influence in the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs (Xuanzheng Yuan) which was the office that oversaw Buddhist and Tibetan affairs.Luciano Petech, Central Tibet and the Mongols: The Y√ºan-Sa-skya period of Tibetan history. Rome 1990, p. 37. His decrees bore the same weight as the great khan in Central Tibet. He usually resided close to the Yuan emperor. The first three Dishi belonged to the Khon lineage, members of which were hereditary abbots of the Sakya Monastery. The disciples of the abbots Sakya Pandita and Phagpa were grouped in the so-called Three Schools, namely the eastern (Shar), western (Nub) and middle (Gun). The Shar was headed by a family of Zhangzhung origins, known as Sharpa.Shoju Inaba, 'The lineage of the Sa skya pa: A chapter of the Red Annals', Memoirs of the Research Department of the Toyo Bunko 22 1963, 111. Yeshe Rinchen and his tenure as Dishi Yeshe Rinchen was born into the Sharpa lineage in 1248, being the son of Chukpo Jetsun Kyab. As a young man he was the disciple of Phagpa. In 1274 the clerics of Sakya sent him to Shingkun (Lintao) where Phagpa resided, where he invited his master back.Shoju Inaba 1963, p. 111. The Dishi dignity was taken over, first by Rinchen Gyaltsen and later by Dharmapala Raksita. The last-mentioned vacated his position in 1286 and headed back for Sakya, dying on the way in 1287. There were no more fully ordained members of the Khon lineage left, and the void was filled by members of the Sharpa lineage. Yeshe Rinchen was appointed Dishi at the imperial court, while his brother Jamyang Rinchen Gyaltsen became the ruling abbot of Sakya. It is possible that the Sharpa brothers were the protegees of the influential imperial minister Sangge.Luciano Petech 1990, p. 29. The tenure of Yeshe Rinchen coincided with the great Tibetan rebellion headed by the Drigung Monastery in 1287-1290, which was finally crushed by the administrator Aglen. In the next year 1291, Sangge fell from power and was executed. Probably this made Yeshe Rinchen's position untenable.Luciano Petech 1990, pp. 72-3. He stepped down from the position as Dishi and was succeeded by Drakpa Odzer. He then withdrew to the sacred Buddhist site Mount Wutai in present-day Shanxi. He died there in 1294.Shoju Inaba 1963, p. 111.

The club's colours were white shirts, black shorts and red socks. The club relocated and became New Brighton A.F.C. in 1921. In 1935 a phoenix club was established South Liverpool F.C. (1935). History Formation and playing years It has long been accepted that the first South Liverpool F.C. was founded in the late-1890s when a club called African Royal (or, in some sources, Africa Royal) changed its name, under the influence of W.J. Sawyer, and relocated to Dingle, just south of the city centre. The team played in The Combination and the Lancashire League before joining the Second Division of the Lancashire Combination in 1911. The club was promoted to the First Division in 1913, but the competition was suspended during the First World War. By 1914, William James Sawyer was Secretary and Managing Director of a new company called South Liverpool Football & Athletic Club, with the team playing at Dingle Park in the Lancashire Combination Division 1 against the likes of Chester, Tranmere Rovers, Barrow, and Accrington Stanley. Sawyer became Hon. Secretary of Everton in 1918 and remained on the club's board of directors for a decade. Latterly he was Secretary-Manager of New Brighton in the 1930s, while he also offered consultancy to Wigan Borough FC on its formation in 1920. Relocation After the war, South Liverpool played for two more seasons before relocating to Wallasey in 1921 and changing its name to New Brighton. New Brighton assumed South Liverpool's official Lancashire FA registration, most of South Liverpool's staff, all of South Liverpool's debts (¬£200, reportedly), and South Liverpool's place in the Lancashire Combination for 1921‚Äì22. Therefore, New Brighton FC was a legal continuation of South Liverpool FC. The club was one and the same, although many sources claim, erroneously, that South Liverpool FC folded up in 1921 and that New Brighton FC was formed in 1921. (The connection between South Liverpool and New Brighton is similar to that of Wimbledon and Milton Keynes Dons). In 1923, New Brighton secured election to the Football League Division Three (North). The club lost its League status in 1951 and folded in 1983. Phoenix club A phoenix club was set up in 1935 bearing the same name.

Participants can be arranged into hierarchies of teams - some games will consist of multiple competing factions and others will have teams operating in different game 'niches'. Megagames have been played with up to 300 people, though are more usually played with 30-80 players.  History   Early forms of megagames  The Model United Nations games were using mechanics and gameplay of megagame (LARPs, negotiation, etc.). It seems they were created in the 1920s on the model of the League of Nations.Marko, Kovacevic. \\"Toward a History of Model United Nations\\". MUNPlanet. Then, in order to popularise the United Nations, they were played through the North- American universities since 1945.\\"Model U.N. Sessions Held at Swarthmore\\". The New York Times. 6 April 1947. p. 54. Retrieved 5 May 2019. Braunstein wargames could be considered as small-scale megagames. Since the 1980s, some tabletop role-playing game conventions organized multi-table games, spreading players and game masters in a synchronous fictional universe.  Modern megagames  The term was coined around 1980 by the wargamer and historian Andy Callan, and developed into a game system by military theorist and historian Paddy Griffith. The Megagame Makers website defines it as: \\"a megagame is a multi- player game, in which, usually the participants are organised into teams, and those teams into an hierarchy of teams\\",http://www.megagame-makers.org.uk/mm- about.htm though not all megagames conform to this definition. An organisation called Chestnut Lodge Wargames Group, based in South London, ran games similar to modern megagames throughout the late 1970s, but the first game to be called a megagame was Memphis Mangler in April 1982. The game, written by Griffith, was a Vietnam wargame with about 30 players. In 2014, gaming reviewers Shut Up & Sit Down produced a video about the first Watch The Skies megagame. This video was pivotal in introducing the previously niche hobby to a larger gaming audience. They recorded a follow-up video the next year at the first 300-player run of Watch The Skies.  Structure  Megagames cover subjects such as modern and historical military conflicts, political scenarios, Machiavellian historical drama, science fiction and fantasy genres. A megagame will take place over a number of turns which can represent time intervals ranging from days to months depending on the scenario being played. Each turn can be broken down into phases again depending on the scenario. These phases can consist of: * Team time, where the team must stay together at their table to discuss their approach to later phases and update each other with their progress during the turn. * An orders phase, where map players will move and/or place units to reflect their attempts to influence the map state. * A meeting phase, where the appropriate team members can meet with other teams in order to try to influence them. A game might consist of an 'adjustable' number of turns to create a level of uncertainty and to reduce the likelihood teams or players attempting 'extreme' actions in the last turn. For example, a game could be scheduled to run for 8-10 turns, with the final turn being declared at the end of one of those turns. The games are moderated by members of Control (or referees), who perform a similar role to that of the dungeon master in a traditional roleplaying game. It is their job to react to the actions players attempt to take during the game. Megagames of between 50-60 will include 5-10 Control players - the largest Watch the Skies megagame had about fifty moderators for 300 players. In large megagames specialist Control roles may be needed to facilitate specific aspects of the game mechanics. In some scenario or plot based theme Plot Control will help manage the various storylines that may have been seeded by the original setting, or have been created by players during the game. In most games where maps are used to represent the locations involved Map Control will coordinate the activity of players and non-player factions on each map and help resolved the outcome of conflict if needed. Overall Game Control will oversee the game as it unfolds and deal with escalations and major plot elements if they are an aspect of the game concerned. Winning and losing In most scenarios winners and losers are not determined - the players judge for themselves how well they have performed within the game and their outcomes against team and personal objectives. Operational megagames may well have victory conditions that can be achieved. The general aim of a megagame will be the group generation of multiple responses to the scenario and starting conditions in the game. In general the end result of a megagame is the stories created by the players at the end of the game.  Formats  There are a couple of main formats of megagames. Operational megagames are typically military \\"what if\\" scenarios and will include an extensive and detailed rule set to reflect the capability of forces and equipment that might be found in the era the game is set in. There is little room for improvisation around the rules and players will be expected to operate closely within the game mechanics. Political megagames, like Watch the Skies, will have a light rule set and there is large scope for improvisation and suggesting plans to Control, who will moderate of the potential for those plans to succeed based on the game scenario and the level of rationale that the players can provide. Other games may have mechanics for political states, economic and trade mechanics and in some games they can include a science side game which may benefit the players teams if they invest in those options. A common format is one which combines the political and operational, providing a political framework in which any combat will be resolved. In the US, most active designers stem from the board game scene and their designs are reflected in their origin. Several have designed highly mechanical megagames with rigid rules that don't differ substantially from very large board games. Within the community, there has been debate about whether these new megagame-board game hybrids are actually megagames (and thus eligible for broad community endorsement and support). These typological debates are not unique to the Megagaming Community and are likely to continue into the future. Notable megagames  Watch The Skies  The awareness of megagames within gaming communities grew following the original run of Jim Wallman's Watch The Skies megagame on 17 May 2014. The game was filmed by board game reviewers Shut Up & Sit Down and then shared on their website. They then followed up with a further documentary on a large version of Watch the Skies https://www.shutupandsitdown.com/videos/watch-skies-2-pt-2/ In the game teams of three to six players represent nations of the world reacting to the arrival of an alien race. Players take on diplomatic and military roles in their dealings with other teams, the room being divided into separate tables for each country, and others for a world map or the United Nations and alien team(s). In some versions corporate entities will also be added to the player teams. Much of the gameplay comes from the players reacting to the unfolding events and actions of the different teams in the scenario. The game has been compared to a Model United Nations activity \\"but there are aliens and everyone has all these tanks, itching for a fight\\". Watch The Skies remains the most popular megagame in the world, having been run on every continent. Several different variations exist, including Jim Wallman's original design, his updated \\"Lite\\" design and a design by the MegaGame Society of New York. Urban Nightmare: State of Chaos In July 2017, the first Wide Area Megagame was held. Urban Nightmare: State of Chaos, designed by Jim Wallman, and took place simultaneously in 11 different locations in Europe and North America. The game setting was a zombie outbreak across America, with each physical location representing a different state. Over 600 players took part. Community There is a growing community around megagaming, with organisations being formed around the world, including the United Kingdom, United States, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan. Megagames are often run at board game conferences, with the MegaGame Coalition organizing multiple megagames at the Gen Con board game convention each year. Personalities A key designer throughout much of this period has been Jim Wallman, one of the primary megagame designers in Megagame Makers and a professional game designer consulting with the British military on simulating conflict scenarios.

Lakhon Chatri was popular in the Southern region of Thailand before it was introduced to Bangkok in three periods. 1769 was the first time when King Taksin of Thonburi along with his army took power over several people including the Lakhon Chatri troupe from Nakhon Si Thammarat (southern region of Thailand) after having suppressed the ruler. In 1780, King Taksin commanded the troupes to perform Lakhon Chatri in competition with the royal court's dance drama troupe during the celebration of the Emerald Buddha statue. During the reign of King Rama the third in 1832, Somdet Chao Phraya Borom Maha Prayurawong (Dit Bunnag) with his army, suppressed an uprising in the southern region and brought along with him several talented performers of Lakhon Chatri.

This performing art is also similar to Lakhon Nok.  Performance area  Having a square shaped area, the troupes set up four poles in four corners with one bench in the square. The pole in the middle is called Sao Mahachai (great victory pole). Also there is a roof above the performance area. There is a low stool which is placed in the middle of the covered space.Vajrabul, S. (2007) Performing Arts. Asia Pacific Cultural Centre for UNESCO (ACCU).

Sanap phlao (calf length trousers) is used. The decorative cloth strips include hoi na (hanging from the front) and hoi khang (hanging from the side). Other decorative accessories are the Sangwan (jewels sashes), thap suag (a pendant), krong kho (an embroidered collar) and a soet (a pointed crown- like headdress).

It serves the city of Tamworth, and opened on 9 January 1882 when the line was extended from West Tamworth to Kootingal. It is also known as the Tamworth Railway Station, yard group and movable relics. The property was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. The station has one platform with a disused dock platform at the southern end that was formerly used by the Barraba line railmotor service. Services Tamworth station is served by NSW TrainLink's daily Northern Tablelands Xplorer service operating between Armidale and Sydney. NSW TrainLink also operate a coach service from the station to Inverell. Transport links New England Coaches' services to Coffs Harbour and Warwick depart from the station forecourt. NSW Trainlink also operates coach services to Dubbo and Port Macquarie  History  Tamworth railway precinct is located on the Main North line, running from Sydney and extending north to the Queensland border, at the town of Wallangarra. The Main North Line (also known as the Great Northern Railway) runs through the Central Coast, Hunter and the New England regions. The line was the original main line between Sydney and Brisbane, however this required a change of gauge at Wallangarra. The line is now closed north of Armidale, and the main route between Brisbane and Sydney is now the North Coast line. Tamworth is located in the east of the region of the Darling Plains of NSW. Explorer John Oxley passed through the Peel Valley in 1818. In 1831, the first sheep stations and cattle stations were formed with most of the country subdivided into large runs by the mid-19th century. The region was used predominantly by pastoralists for cattle and sheep grazing, although the 20th century saw sheep and wheat farming dominate the region. In the 1830s, a company town began to develop on the Peel's southwest bank, the present site of West Tamworth. In 1850 a public town was gazetted on the opposite side of the river from the existing settlement. This town became the main town, called Tamworth. The town grew and, in 1861, Tamworth had a population of 654, both in the government town on the north side of the river, and in the company town on the south side. A municipality was created in 1876, when Tamworth had flour mills, a tannery, butter factory, plaster works, brick and pipe-making, brewery, clothing and furniture manufacture.Heritage Office and the Department of Urban Affairs & Planning, 1996: part 7, p.5 Its services included a hospital, post office and telegraph, court house, police station, two schools, two banks and six insurance brokers. In 1888, Tamworth was the first Australian town to use electric lighting. The Great Northern Railway had reached East Maitland in 1857, Singleton in 1863, Muswellbrook in 1869 and Murrurundi in April 1871. Coaches ran from there to Tamworth and other New England areas. The opening of the Quirindi section took place on 13 August 1877 with the line reaching Tamworth in 1878. The official opening of the railway platform at West Tamworth took place on 15 October 1878. The Tamworth railway station at West Tamworth was only named West Tamworth after the line was extended across the river to East Tamworth and the opening of the present Tamworth railway station in 1882. The single line from West Tamworth to Kootingal opened on 9 January 1882, with the station officially opened for service on the same day. The construction contract for the West Tamworth to Uralla section was awarded to A & R Amos on 12 September 1879.Forsyth, 2009 The two towns of Tamworth prospered as a traffic centre when the railways arrived in 1878, as it drew much of the northern wool traffic by dray to the rail head. As each new section of the Main North line was opened, the settlement at the temporary terminus suddenly became a busy centre as horse or bullock teams carried supplies from the railway yard to all the settlements beyond and returned with wool, minerals and other produce. Generally, the arrival of railway gangs to extend the line to the next town provided a final flutter before the town returned to slumber. Tamworth, however, was one of few larger towns to receive a sustainable boost from the arrival of the railway. The uniquely designed 1880s station building featured fine classical Victorian proportions and good detailing and finish. Internally, the building originally consisted of a central waiting room, station master's, ticket, parcels, and telegraph offices, ladies waiting room, and detached toilet block and lamp room wing. Although the station building has been added to, as is evident on the platform awning, and the use and composition of rooms has changed over the years, the building remains in close to original condition. The station building also incorporated the very rare addition of a landscaped forecourt, with many of the original plantings surviving to the present day. The station master's residence is unique in that it was purchased after its construction, and therefore does not conform to the typical railway structures from this period. It was built in 1877 as the manse for the nearby Wesleyan Church and was separated from the church by the construction of the railway when it was extended from Tamworth in 1881. This coincides with the purchase of the property by NSW Railways to serve as the station masters residence.Cottee, 2004  Description  The interior of Tamworth signal box, in 2009. The station complex comprises a first class type 5 station building, erected in 1882; and residences located at 34 Bourke Street, being a type 4 Station Master's residence, erected in 1877 and resumed in 1881, and a type 3 brick gatehouse, erected in 1882. Other structures include a brick/concrete platform face and dock platform, erected in 1882; a footbridge, undated; and timber level crossing gates and gatehouses at the Sydney end of the loop. The complex is landscaped with a park and plantings in the forecourt area, established , including trees from opening of the station. Moveable objects at the signal box complex include a platform lamp oil, (AA01); three cane hoops, two large, one small; a collected tickets box (AA13); compactus in the training room; a sign, pillows for hire 1/-, 0.5/0.5, (AS01); a circuit phone wall mounted timber, (AT01); a timber rotating chair with leather cushion and central cut- out, (CA03); and a timber table and ruling rod, 0.9/0.7/0.8, (TA01).AA04, AA05  Heritage listing  As at 4 September 2013, the Tamworth Railway Station was of state significance as a grand Victorian period station complex, in close to original condition with the very rare addition of a landscaped forecourt area dating from the time of construction and containing original planting and civic garden detail. The station building is an excellent example of a first-class station building with fine classical proportions, good detailing and finish, demonstrating the peak of railway construction during the late 19th century. The station building is significant as a tangible link to the development of the Great Northern Railway (GNR) line during the 19th century, with the scale and quality of building design demonstrating the importance that was attached to Tamworth as a township and railway location. Tamworth railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Tamworth railway precinct is significant for its historical values as a tangible link to the development of the Great Northern Railway (GNR) line during the 19th century. The GNR was an important achievement in transport and engineering within NSW. As the third main trunk rail route in NSW stretching from Sydney to the Queensland border, the line linked townships to one another as well as to Sydney leading to significant economic and social impacts for those individual townships as well as for NSW more generally. The development, importance and impact of the NSW railways is illustrated at Tamworth through the fine and intact example of a first class railway station, constructed in the 1880s as the rail head at the height of railway construction activity and development in NSW. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Tamworth railway station building has high aesthetic significance as a unique and finely detailed first class station contributing to the townscape of Tamworth, which is further enhanced by the forecourt area and gardens. The building is a first class, single storey, rendered brick building of Victorian Italianate design. The building consists of painted face brick with stuccoed quoins, pediments, gables, and rendered window and door cornices and sills. The road facade is composed of three classical revival pedimented gables projecting from the main platform wing. Unlike other similar scaled buildings Tamworth station building has equal attention to detail and facade treatment on both the platform and road faces. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The site is of social significance to the local community on account of its lengthy association for providing an important source of employment, trade and social interaction for the local area. The site is significant for its ability to contribute to the local community's sense of place, is a distinctive feature of the daily life of many community members, and provides a connection to the local community's past. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The station building, residences and other precinct elements provide an opportunity to research the development of the NSW railways and the role and importance of Tamworth. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The Tamworth railway station building has representative significance has a fine and intact example of a first class railway station building in NSW. Although each of the 19 first class station buildings constructed in NSW differed in design, each demonstrate in scale, quality and decorative detail the importance of the railways and the importance of these stations constructed at major regional centres throughout NSW.  In popular culture  Tamworth station appeared in the 1971 Australian film 3 to Go, as part of the Judy vignette.

The station serves the city of Dubbo and was opened on 1 February 1881.Dubbo Station NSWrail.net The station is also known as Dubbo Railway Station and yard group. The property was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. The station and associated yards were designed by the office of the Engineer-in-Chief of the NSW Government Railways, under the direction of John Whitton. Dubbo was a major railway centre, being the junction for the Main Western, Molong-Dubbo and Coonamble lines and maintaining a sizeable locomotive depot. Dubbo was the limit for heavier 36, 38 and 60 class locomotives, with smaller locomotives taking over for journeys further west. The station previously had a bay platform, which was removed in August 1988. Rail services east from Central Sydney terminate at Dubbo and there are now services by coaches to the north west. Services Dubbo was served by the Western Mail from Central Sydney until services ceased in November 1988.\\"Last Passengers\\" Railway Digest January 1989 page 20\\"The Last Post for the Last Mail\\" Railway Digest February 1989 page 53 At Dubbo it connected with the Far West Express to Bourke, Cobar and Coonamble. In September 1975, the Public Transport Commission introduced six Denning coaches to replace all train services north and west from Dubbo. Today Dubbo is served by NSW TrainLink's daily Central West XPT service operating to and from Central Sydney. NSW TrainLink also operate road coach services from Dubbo to Lithgow, Cootamundra, Broken Hill, Bourke, Nyngan and Lightning Ridge.  History  Eastbound view of the platform Most of the stone structures comprising Dubbo Railway Station were built between 1879 and 1881 in preparation for its opening in 1881. The station master's residence was completed that same year. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries some additions were made to the precinct, including: *1891 construction of the lamp room and wool stage; *1893 Dubbo West rail siding; *1897 carriage shed; *1898 the western end platform extension; *1893 opening of the Dubbo-Coonamble rail line; *1904 installation of a cart weighbridge and extensions to the Sydney end of the platform; *1908 grain shed. Numerous additions and alterations were made in the first two decades of the early 20th century, decreasing in frequency into the 1930s and 1940s. By 1975 passenger services to Bourke, Cobar and Coonamble were replaced by a road coach services connecting with the trains at Dubbo Railway Station. The 1980s saw demolition of several by-then anachronistic structural elements including the municipal gas siding, the livestock loading facility, the Darling Street gate house and the Institute Hall (relocated elsewhere). In 1988 the Dubbo-Molong line was decommissioned in 1988. Dubbo Railway Station remains an operational station on the western line, operated by RailCorp, although the station master's residence is now in private ownership.

Heritage listing  Dubbo station and residences is one of the few groups of buildings on the NSW system constructed in stone and one of the very few stone first class railway stations built. The surviving stone platform faces are rare and of high significance. The site is of high significance as it is situated adjacent to some excellent early industrial buildings used in relation to the railway and the railway hotel. The group is an important element in the townscape of Dubbo which is an historic centre which relies on tourism and its historic theme.

He was mortally wounded during the Battle of Princeton and buried with military honours by American General George Washington at Pluckemin, New Jersey.  Early life  Leslie was born on 8 August 1751 to David Leslie, 6th Earl of Leven and Wilhelmina Nisbet. He was the nephew of General Alexander Leslie. During the summer of 1767, he became a friend of Benjamin Rush, who was then studying medicine at University of Edinburgh and had visited the estate of the Earl of Leven.  Military career  In 1771, he joined the 42nd Highlanders; then switched to the 17th Foot and was promoted to lieutenant in 1773, and to captain in 1776. Sent to America in 1776, he served in the Battle of Long Island and the Battle of Fort Washington. Leslie was one of many who died during the Battle of Princeton on 3 January 1777. The British put his body in a wagon that was later taken by the Americans. The following day, Rush, while treating the wounded at Princeton, learned of Leslie's death from British Captain John McPherson. On 5 January, at Pluckemin, when General George Washington learned that Leslie was a friend of Rush, he ordered military honours for the burial. The gravestone is in the graveyard of the former St. Paul's Lutheran Church (built 1757), where the Pluckemin Presbyterian Church is now located.  Legacy  In The Death of General Mercer at the Battle of Princeton, January 3, 1777, the painter John Trumbull displays several events of the battle. At the centre, General Hugh Mercer, with his dead horse beneath him, is mortally wounded. At the left, Captain Daniel Neil is bayoneted against a cannon. At the right, Leslie is shown mortally wounded. In the background, Washington and Rush enter the scene. After the war, Dr. Benjamin Rush placed a gravestone in Leslie's memory at the Pluckemin graveyard. As the original had crumbled, a replacement with the same inscription was erected by Professor Ogilby of Rutgers University at the request of David Leslie- Melville, 8th Earl of Leven. His gravestone is honoured by both British and Scottish flags. { |} Gallery File:The Death of General Mercer at the Battle of Princeton January 3 1777.jpegThe Death of General Mercer at the Battle of Princeton, January 3, 1777 by John Trumbull, with Leslie, shown on the right, mortally wounded File:William Leslie Gravestone, Pluckemin, NJ.jpg|Leslie gravestone at Pluckemin, New Jersey  References   Bibliography   *  External links   * Category:1751 births Category:1777 deaths Category:British Army personnel of the American Revolutionary War Category:Royal Leicestershire Regiment officers Category:British military personnel killed in the American Revolutionary War Category:Younger sons of earls Category:Burials in New Jersey ","title":"William Leslie (British Army officer)"},{"id":"44916025","text":"Gigliola Staffilani (born March 24, 1966)Birth year from Library of Congress catalog entry, retrieved 2018-12-02. is an Italian-American mathematician who works as the Abby Rockefeller Mauze Professor of Mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Curriculum vitae, retrieved 2015-01-01.. An autobiographical retrospective of Staffilani's life and career.. Archived by the Indian Academy of Sciences, Women in Science initiative. Her research concerns harmonic analysis and partial differential equations, including the Korteweg‚Äìde Vries equation and Schr√∂dinger equation.  Education and career  Staffilani grew up on a farm in Martinsicuro in central Italy, speaking only the local dialect, and with no books until her older brother brought some back from his school. Her father died when she was 10, and her mother decided that she did not need to continue on to high school, but her brother helped her change her mother's mind. She came to love mathematics at her school, and was encouraged by her teachers and brother to continue her studies, with the idea that she could return to Martinsicuro as a mathematics teacher. She earned a fellowship to study at the University of Bologna, where she earned a laurea in mathematics in 1989 with an undergraduate thesis on Green's functions for elliptic partial differential equations. At the suggestion of one of her professors at Bologna, she moved to the University of Chicago for her graduate studies, to study with Carlos Kenig. This was a big change in her previous plans, because it would mean that she could not return to Martinsicuro. When she arrived at Chicago, still knowing very little English and not having taken the Test of English as a Foreign Language, she had the wrong type of visa to obtain the teaching fellowship she had been promised. She almost returned home, but remained after Paul Sally intervened and loaned her enough money to get by until the issue could be resolved. At Chicago, she studied dispersive partial differential equations with Kenig, earning a master's degree in 1991 and a Ph.D. in 1995. After postdoctoral studies at the Institute for Advanced Study, Stanford University, and Princeton University, Staffilani took a tenure-track faculty position at Stanford in 1999, and earned tenure there in 2001. While at Stanford, she met her husband, Tomasz Mrowka, a mathematics professor at MIT, and after a year and a half found a faculty position closer to him at Brown University. She moved to MIT in 2002, where, in 2006 she became the second female full professor of mathematics.  Collaboration  Staffilani is a frequent collaborator with James Colliander, Markus Keel, Hideo Takaoka, and Terence Tao, forming a group known as the \\"I-team\\".. The name of this group has been said to come from the notation for a mollification operator used in the team's method of almost conserved quantities,I-method , Dispersive Wiki, retrieved 2015-01-02. or as an abbreviation for \\"interaction\\", referring both to the teamwork of the group and to the interactions of light waves with each other.Fields Medal announcement for Terry Tao, International Congress of Mathematicians, 2006, retrieved 2015-01-02. The group's work was featured prominently in the 2006 Fields Medal citations for group member Tao.  Awards and honors  Staffilani was a Sloan Fellow from 2000 to 2002. In 2009-2010 she was a member of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. In 2012 she became one of the inaugural fellows of the American Mathematical Society.List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society, retrieved 2015-01-01.

It was built during 1876-80 by the local chapter of the International Order of Odd Fellows (IOOF), and served as the meeting place for the fraternal organization into the 1980s. It is also a significant meeting space for social events in the wider community. The building, now owned by the local historical society, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012. Description and history The West Paris IOOF Lodge hall is a two-story wood frame structure, with a gable roof, clapboard siding, and a foundation that is partly granite and partly brick. A shed-roof addition extends to the rear of the building. The building has vernacular Italianate styling, with paired scroll brackets in the eaves and along the rake and gable edge, and pilasters at the corners. The main facade, facing northwest, has two windows, symmetrically placed on each of the two main levels, and a fifth window in the gable; the latter is topped by a triangular moulding in which a panel contains a plaque inscribed \\"1876\\". Between the windows on the first level is the main entrance, a double door sheltered by a hood supported by scrolled brackets. A second, more modest entrance, is sandwiched between the rightmost window and the building corner; this entry provides access to the lodge facilities on the second floor.Mitchell, Christi (2011); NRHP nomination for West Paris Lodge No. 15, I.O.O.F.; available by requested from the Maine Historic Preservation Commission The first floor interior houses a vestibule area, and then a kitchen, with a large hall serving as a dining area that also has a stage. A stairway area off the vestibule serves to provide access to both the basement and the upper level, which is also accessible via the outside door. The stairs from each lead to a landing, from which a door with a peephole provides access to a vestibule flanked by storage areas. This configuration was arranged to limit entry to the upper level lodge facilities to authorized individuals. This area includes trappings of the IOOF, including portraits of its leaders as well as ceremonial regalia. The lodge auditorium, which takes up most of the floor, has been converted into a museum exhibit space by the historical society. The hall was built c. 1880 by Silas Maxim, a local builder, and is one of West Paris' largest civic buildings. It was originally built to house facilities for both the local chapter of the International Order of Odd Fellows (IOOF), and of the local Masonic chapter. The Masons built their own hall next door to this building in 1893. This building was enlarged in length by about in 1889, visible in part by the use of brick for the foundation of the addition. This addition included the stage, and made possible the staging of theatrical and musical events in the hall. The building was sold to the West Paris Historical Society in 1986, which uses the hall as an office space and museum.

Hamblett's paintings can be divided into three categories: memory paintings, dream paintings, and landscape paintings. Early life Theora Alton Hamblett was born 15 January 1895, in Paris, Mississippi. Her father Samuel was a Civil War veteran, who was 72 years old when Theora was born. She was educated in Blue Mountain, Mississippi, and at Lafayette County Agricultural High School.Lee Kogan, \\"Theora Hamblett,\\" in Gerard C. Wertkin, ed., Encyclopedia of American Folk Art (Routledge 2003): 243-244\\\\. Hamblett was raised in a very religious household and rotated between Methodist and Baptist churches. Theora Hamblett became interested in painting at a young age, though she did not start taking painting classes until later in her life at age fifty-five. Carol Crown states that when Hamblett was eight years old, she was given crayons as a present which could have stimulated her interest in painting. Hamblett was a teacher in her early adulthood; she left the classroom in 1931, and cared for her dying mother for several years. In 1939 she bought a house in Oxford, Mississippi, where she lived and rented rooms to students. In her mid-fifties, she took her first nighttime painting class at the University of Mississippi. She also took correspondence courses on art.Marion Barnwell, ed. A Place Called Mississippi (University Press of Mississippi 1997): 310-311\\\\. Symbolism Hamblett uses many symbols in her artwork. Hamblett's paintings are colorful and frequently harken back to her childhood on a farm, or depict stories from the Bible. Some represent Hamblett's dreams or visions, frequently with religious symbolism (angels, chariots, butterflies, stairways, roses).Paul Grootkerk, \\"The Visionary Paintings of Theora Hamblett,\\" Women's Art Journal 11(2)(Autumn 1990-Winter 1991): 19-22.Melissa Harrison McGuire, \\"Visionary Southern Artists: Theora Hamblett and Howard Finster,\\" Proteus: A Journal of Ideas 16(1)(Spring 1999): 40-44. Butterflies in Hamblett's paintings represent resurrection and the soul. A rose in Hamblett's art symbolizes love, martyrdom, or The Virgin Mary. The color yellow represents divinity or God in Hamblett's art. Silver symbolizes the death of the body in Hamblett's paintings. In 1954, Hamblett broke her hip in an accident and needed surgery. While she was in the hospital, Hamblett began to paint her visions. Many of her dreams were religious in nature. Hamblett did not sell many of these paintings because they were intimate and personal. Style and technique Theora Hamblett's artwork is characterized by vibrant colors. She has a unique style of creating trees in her artwork which is easily recognizable by fans of her art. She had a specific method of layering colors in the individual leaves so that they shine with bright colors. She layered each single leaf on the art piece to make the trees the central focus of her paintings. Hamblett painted landscape scenes of all four seasons, but she was extremely fond of autumn because of the dazzling color of the fall leaves. Hamblett almost exclusively used oil paint on canvas. Carol Crown states that an artist she \\"developed a unique pointillist technique that invested her paintings with a distinctive look.\\" Personal life and legacy Hamblett died 6 March 1977, age 82.\\"Deaths: Artist Theora Hamblett,\\" Daytona Beach Morning Journal (March 7, 1977): 9B.

He hailed from Sakya which was the foremost monastic regime in Tibet in this period. He held the post from 1291 to his death in 1303. Political background Since the mid-13th century the abbots of the Sakya Monastery had been the main middlemen between Tibet and the Mongol conquerors. In 1270 one of their line, Phagpa was appointed Imperial Preceptor (Dishi). The Dishi resided near the emperor and had a major influence in the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs (Xuanzheng Yuan).Luciano Petech, Central Tibet and the Mongols: The Y√ºan-Sa-skya period of Tibetan history. Rome 1990, p. 37. Up to 1286 the dignity was filled by members of the Khon family who were also usually hereditary abbots of Sakya. However, due to the lack of fully ordained members of the lineage after that date, persons from other clerical elite families of Sakya origins were appointed. As imperial preceptor One such family were the Khangsarpa. One of their line, Sumpa Drakpa Gyaltsen, begot two sons called Drakpa Odzer and Sanggye Pal. Drakpa Odzer became the general administrator in charge of Phagpa's property. Later on he accompanied Phagpa's nephew Dharmapala Raksita when he moved to Beijing to take up the Dishi dignity in 1282.Shoju Inaba, 'The lineage of the Sa skya pa: A chapter of the Red Annals', Memoirs of the Research Department of the Toyo Bunko 22 1963, 112. When the next Dishi Yeshe Rinchen vacated his position in 1291, Drakpa Odzer was appointed his successor. As such he was confronted with the issue of the succession to the abbot-ship of Sakya, which was kept strictly apart from the Dishi position. At this time a man of the Sharpa family, Jamyang Rinchen Gyaltsen, took care of the Sakya see. The administrator (dpon-chen or ponchen) in Central Tibet, Aglen, took the initiative for summoning a council in Sakya where the leading clerics agreed to send a petition to Drakpa Odzer. There they requested that the only surviving member of the Khon family, Zangpo Pal, would be allowed to take up the position of abbot-ruler. Drakpa Odzer consented, possibly out of political necessity, and forwarded the petition to the emperor Tem√ºr who approved it.Luciano Petech 1990, pp. 73-6. Zangpo Pal returned to Sakya in 1298, although he was not fully installed until 1306. Drakpa Odzer died at the imperial court in 1303.Shoju Inaba 1963, p. 111. He was succeeded by the ex- abbot Jamyang Rinchen Gyaltsen. Later on, in 1305, his younger brother Sanggye Pal became Dishi.

The cheaper guipures were affected but the better Brussels laces stayed in demand for wedding trousseaux. Designs and technique however remained much the same. Individuality of lace types decreased and interest for making lace as a hobby increased. In the 1880s the lace industry revived with imitations of old laces. Aalst developed a lace with a technique based on Duchesse lace. The frequent little roses gave the lace its name: Rosaline. The same name has been used for a seventeenth century Venetian needle lace with similar design. The Belgian Rosaline was produced until the 1950s and rediscovered in 1980s. The lace is flexible to changing fashion. Worn and unsold pieces could be reassembled. Features Characteristic features are the roses with three or five petals, frequently arranged in trails. Unlike the Duchesse, the lace has no gimps. A Brussels variant has needle lace pearls mounted on the hearts of the roses, a Brugges variant lacks the pearls. A special variant connects the flowers with short crinkly edges. Another variant has needle lace fillings. The lace was almost exclusively made of fine linen threads. A piece of lace may look irregular when different parts were created by different people, tension and number of pairs may vary. The lace requires six or seven pairs. The parts are worked more or less of tapes, mainly in cloth stitch. Each part starts and ends with a bundle, a shortcut for starting and tying off each pair individually. Traditionally these bundles are both on the front and on the back of the lace.

In the 1960s, it was unofficial. See History of UEFA Intertoto Cup in uefa.com. Ajax plays at the Johan Cruyff Arena (previously known as Amsterdam Arena), which opened in 1996. They previously played at De Meer Stadion and the Amsterdam Olympic Stadium (for international matches). Stadiums 1893‚Äì1900: \\"Het Veldje\\" Prior to the foundation of the club in 1900, during what is considered the prehistory of the club, Ajax had played their matches on an empty field at the end of the Overtoom in the municipality of Nieuwer Amstel. An area which lied outside the city limits at the time and in 1881 had been made an extension of the Vondelpark. For ∆í15 (Dutch guilder) a day, the team could play on the field commonly known as \\"Het Veldje\\". The exact measurements of the pitch are not known, but sometimes corner kicks were taken from the sidewalk. In 1896 the area was included in the expansion of the municipality of Amsterdam, leaving Ajax in search of a new location. 1900‚Äì1907: Amsterdam-Noord In the beginning, the sporting ambitions of Floris Stempel and Han Dade were not reflected in the pitch the team played their matches on. Forced to play on the farmer fields of Buiksloterham in Amsterdam-Noord. There was a high demand for football pitches in the city and Ajax were forced to compete on the outskirts of the city then. This proved to be especially trying of the Supporters who had to take a ferry to the North, and then walk 15 minutes to the field. Irrespective of these challenges, the club did manage to come in second place twice in their competition. 1907‚Äì1934: Het Houten Stadion The first actual stadium the team played in was built out of necessity by honorary club member Daan Roodenburgh. Due to city planning, and housing development occurring on the club's field of choice in Amsterdam-Noord, two available pitches had been located on the Middenweg in Watergraafsmeer, Amsterdam-Oost. Situated on the polder, the new location offered a location much closer to the city center. Initially without stands, dressing rooms or running Water, amenities were provided from the Caf√© Brokelmann across the Street. The first grand stands were built in 1911, when Ajax hired architect and famed Ajax supporter Daan Roodenburgh to design the first stands. Offering covered seating along the long side of the pitch at first, as well as standing options behind the goal line. Het Houten Stadion as the Stadium was known was expanded in 1916 to include additional standing and seating options surrounding the pitch. Despite the expansion, the Stadium was still deemed to small with a recorded 15.000 attendees registered on 11 November 1934 during the final match against Feyenoord. People were said to have been falling over the railings, making it impossible for either team to take corners during the match. 1934‚Äì1996: De Meer \\"The value of a football stadium is not defined by its construction costs, but rather by the team that plays in it\\". It was with this thought in mind that the Board approached the planning and development of what would become Ajax' second Stadium. Becoming its home grounds for the next 62 years. \\"De Meer Stadion\\" as the Stadium became known, was the home grounds for legendary Dutch football players such as Piet van Reenen, Wim Anderiesen, Rinus Michels, Sjaak Swart, Henk Groot, Johan Cruijff, Piet Keizer, Marco van Basten and countless others. Success, as well as pressure from the league forced the club to relocate once more in order to accommodate the high attendance, as well as to avoid the necessary annual repair costs of their first stadium. In addition the city of Amsterdam were interested in the property in Watergraafsmeer for further housing development. The club decided to more to the nearby Hoeve Voorland on the MIddenweg, across from Betondorp. Again the architect of the stadium, Daan Roodenburgh, by now a member of the board at the club, was assigned by chairman Koolhaas to design a new stadium with a budget of ∆í300,000. The costs to build the stadium were covered by all club members, including the players. The new stadium was opened on 9 December 1934. The first match contested at the new stadium was a friendly match against the now defunct Stade Fran√ßais from Paris which Ajax won 5‚Äì1.. Despite lighting fixtures not being added until 1971, the stadium was exemplary in its design, with a roofed section which was quite unique at its time. The capacity of the stadium was expanded from 22.000 to 29.500 attendees over the years. In 1965, the sitting stands across from the honorary stands were renamed to the \\"Reyenoldstribune\\" in honor of legendary head coach Jack Reynolds who served 25 years at the club. In 1968, the Ajax Restaurant was built at the main entrance, and by 1985 all sitting and standing options in the stadium were fully covered. A year later the first skyboxes were built. The final change occurred in 1988, when the press stands were rebuilt into the main stands, which were renamed the \\"Jaap van Praagtribune\\" in honor of former chairman Jaap van Praag who had died a year prior. By the end of the eighties, the club's home ground had been out grown. Considered a danger to the public, due to heightened vandalism during matches, circumstances forced the club to find a new home, with UEFA ruling that no more standing tribunes would be allowed, and the Stadium regarded as too small to contain the hardcore supporters, with many expressing sorrow and pain for having to relocate once more. 1934‚Äì1996: Olympisch Stadion During the time at De Meer, the Olympic Stadium in Amsterdam played an important role for the club as well. Initially serving as grounds for matches with an attendance of 20.000 or higher, it was also used when artificial lighting was necessary. Although the stadium was never in possession of the club, a multi-functional facility and not football specific grounds, many important matches were contested there. In 1921, the city of Amsterdam were permitted to host the Olympic games, in turn appointing architect Jan Wils to build a new stadium. The Capital already had a stadium that could facilitate 24.700 people, which was built in 1911, however lacking a proper running track. The stadium, located in Amsterdam-Zuid was expanded upon. The permanent home ground for cross town rivals FC Blauw-Wit, the stadium was sporadically used by Ajax as well. Following competition in terms of capacity provided by the completion of De Kuip in Rotterdam in 1937, two additional concrete rings were added to expand the capacity of the stadium, raising its total capacity from 34.000 to 64.000 people. The two main reasons for Ajax to use the Stadium was for its capacity, as well as for lighting purposes. Booking the stadium would prove to be problematic for Ajax, with Blauw-Wit and DWS as permanent tenants. The most notable match held at the stadium for Ajax, is arguably the Round of 16 match of the Europa Cup I against Liverpool F.C. in 1966. known as De Mistwedstrijd, Ajax would go on to defeat the reigning English champions 5‚Äì1, while playing in thick fog. 1996‚ÄìPresent: Johan Cruyff Arena (Amsterdam Arena)  Exterior of the Johan Cruyff Arena In 1996, Ajax moved to a new home ground in the southeast of the city known as the Amsterdam Arena, since 2018 renamed as the Johan Cruyff Arena. The stadium was built by the Amsterdam city authority at a cost of $134 million. The Arena has a retractable roof and set a trend for other modern stadiums built in Europe in the following years. In the Netherlands, the Arena earned a reputation for a terrible grass pitch caused by the removable roof that, even when open, takes away too much sunlight and fresh air. During the 2008‚Äì2009 season groundstaff introduced an artificial lighting system that has finally reduced this problem considerably. The stadium has its own single rail train stop in the Halte Amsterdam ArenA. The much-loved De Meer stadium was torn down and the land was sold to the city council. A residential neighbourhood now occupies the area. The letters AJAX, of the old stadium are nowadays in place on the fa√ßade of the entrance at the Johan Cruyff Arena. From the start of the 2018-2019 season the stadium was renamed after the legendary player Johan Cruyff who died in 2016. The new name is the Johan Cruyff Arena . Nowadays the capacity is 54.990.

Brinton that is generally acknowledged to be the first sequel to the works of Jane Austen and as such the first piece of Austen fan fiction. It incorporates characters from each of Austen's six major novels into one unified story, alongside characters of Brinton's own invention. Keeping to the spirit of the source novels, its major theme is the difficulties faced by assorted pairs of lovers placed within the class structure of early 19th century Britain. Cover of Old Friends and New Fancies by Sybil G. Brinton. Plot Old Friends and New Fancies is set in the same time as Austen's own novels and is similarly structured, with a focus on the challenges of matchmaking among pairs of lovers kept apart by various social and economic tensions. It has something of a postmodern overtone in that it mixes together characters from all six of Austen's major novels, creating an enormously extended network of friends, relations, and acquaintances. For example, Elizabeth (Bennet) Darcy (of Pride and Prejudice), Elinor (Dashwood) Ferrars (of Sense and Sensibility), and Anne (Elliot) Wentworth (of Persuasion) are all friends. Despite the fact that Brinton provides a full list of characters (sorted by their source books), keeping the cast straight is something many readers complain about, since quite a few of the characters are only mentioned in passing. Most of the characters are recognizably the same, though several have improved‚Äîamong them Kitty Bennet and Tom Bertram‚Äîwhile George Knightley is somewhat sourer and Mary Crawford much less lively than in Austen's depictions. The largest single change from Austen's own books is that Marianne Dashwood's husband, Colonel Brandon, has died before the book opens. Although the book jacket proclaims that Brinton mixes in \\"new characters of the author's devising,\\" none of the new characters are of any great importance. Because many of the key characters hail from Pride and Prejudice, some critics treat Old Friends and New Fancies primarily as a sequel to that particular book. Mansfield Park is the next best represented novel in terms of major characters. The chief protagonists of Old Friends and New Fancies are three young women, all unmarried at the outset: Georgiana Darcy and Kitty Bennet (Pride and Prejudice) and Mary Crawford (Mansfield Park). The novel begins after the marriage of Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy (they have two children, a boy of two years, and a baby girl); Darcy's sister Georgiana and cousin Colonel Fitzwilliam have been engaged for six months but are not very happy together, and they soon break it off. Col. Fitzwilliam goes to visit Lady Catherine de Bourgh in Bath with the Darcys, where he meets and falls in love with Mary Crawford. Robert and Lucy (Steele) Ferrars have been cultivating Lady Catherine, and Lucy is hoping that Col. Fitzwilliam will marry her sister Anne. The Ferrars take the opportunity to slander Mary to Lady Catherine, resulting in her banishment from Lady Catherine's circle. Lonely and defiant, Mary begins spending time with an admiring Sir Walter Elliott, leading to a rumor that they are about to marry. Hearing this and feeling that his comparative poverty and lack of title make him a poor match for Mary, Col. Fitzwilliam removes himself from the scene, going to Ireland for a time. They are only reconciled after Col. Fitzwilliam is badly injured in a fall from his horse while hunting. Meanwhile, Kitty Bennet has gone to London as a proteg√© of Emma (Woodhouse) Knightley. Although less flighty than formerly, she falls madly in love with William Price, a friend of the Knightleys and a naval officer who is the younger brother of Fanny (Price) Bertram of Mansfield Park. Georgiana visits Kitty in London, where she is introduced to William at a ball given by the Knightleys. Kitty later goes to stay with Elizabeth and Georgiana at Pemberley, and they try unsuccessfully to rein in her expectation of receiving a proposal of marriage from William. The Darcys give a ball at which William, instead of proposing to Kitty, declares his love to Georgiana. Georgiana, out of consideration for Kitty's feelings and confusion about her own, initially rebuffs William, but eventually the two become engaged, while a sobered Kitty pairs up with clergyman James Morland, whom Darcy has installed in a local parish. The latter denouement was hinted at by Austen herself in her letters, where she mentions that she can imagine Kitty married to a Derbyshire clergyman. Almost as an afterthought, Brinton also pairs up Tom Bertram and Isabella Thorpe, completing a sequence in which all of Brinton's characters destined for matrimony become engaged to someone from a different Jane Austen novel.

She was born in 1874 at Stourport-on-Severn in Worcestershire and was subject to ill health throughout her life. She married in 1908 and died in 1928. What she termed her \\"little attempt at picturing the after-adventures of some of Jane Austen's characters\\" was her only book. Only a few editions were published, and it remained relatively unknown until it was reprinted in 1998, after it had passed into the public domain. Brinton states in her preface that she used a memoir by Jane Austen's nephew James Austen- Leigh as one source for her plot elements. Some critics find Brinton's style flat and the novel cluttered by minor characters; on the whole, it is considered less successful than later Austen sequels. While Brinton's style is certainly less sharply satirical than Austen's, it is still recognizably Austenian in spirit and tone: Brinton sometimes slips into anachronism, for example using the adjective 'nice' in ways it was not employed in Austen's time. Brinton makes less use than Austen of dialogue generally, especially banter, but spends more time reflecting on her characters' inner lives and motivations. Some of the plot elements feel recycled from Austen's work‚Äîfor example, an episode of charades at Pemberley (instead of Mansfield Park), the severe tongue-lashing Lady Catherine administers to Mary Crawford (instead of Elizabeth Bennett), or the illness of Kitty (instead of Marianne Dashwood) precipitated by unrequited love. While these may be deliberate homages to Austen, they can come off as a lack of inventiveness on Brinton's part. While Old Friends and New Fancies is now considered the first sequel to Jane Austen's works, there are a few prior books with a claim to the title, including an 1815 French translation of Sense and Sensibility by Isabelle de Montolieu that changed the ending; and an 1850 transformation of Austen's unfinished novel The Watsons into The Younger Sister by Austen's own niece, Catherine Anne Hubback. As reworkings of existing manuscripts, these have a much weaker claim than Brinton's book, in which the plot is entirely her own even though nearly all the characters are borrowed.

Built c. 1819, it is one of the oldest surviving buildings in Piscataquis County. The 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with vernacular Federal style, was built by Robert Carleton on land purchased from his brother, a worker in the nearby fulling mill. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. Description and history The Carleton House is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gable roof, two interior chimneys near the side walls, and a granite foundation. The main facade, facing south, is five bays wide, with a central entry that has flanking sidelight windows, and a Federal-style surround that has pilasters supported in an entablature with cornice. The windows are uniformly 12-over-12 sash. A single-story ell, probably an early addition, extends to the north. The interior has a central hall plan, with two rooms on each side of the hall on both floors. These rooms have original Federal period woodwork, including fireplace mantels, wainscoting, trim, and doors. The town of Sangerville was first settled c. 1801-02, and Thomas Prince, one of the early arrivals, established a fulling mill on what is now called Carleton Stream, which empties into the nearby Piscataquis River. One of Prince's workers, Guy Carleton, purchased the land on which this house stands in 1818. The following year he sold it to his brother Robert, who built the house. Robert was a prominent member of the local militia, seeing some heightened activity during the border dispute with neighboring New Brunswick known as the Aroostook War. Guy Carleton established his own mill, which survived as a business into the 20th century.

Overlooking a strategic route to the coast, the original castle probably comprised an inner and an outer bailey and a protective barbican, with a three-storey high keep on its southern side. It was built in the second half of the 12th century, probably by Baldwin of Bethune, the Count of Aumale. It then passed to the families of Marshal and de Montfort, before being given by King Henry III to his half-brother William de Valence in 1265, from whom the castle takes its current name. It was abandoned in the early 14th century and fell into ruin. Today, the castle is managed by English Heritage, and the remains of the keep are open to the public. 12th ‚Äì 15th centuries Sutton Valence Castle was probably built in the second half of the 12th century by the Counts of Aumale, most likely by Baldwin of Bethune, but perhaps by William le Gros, Baldwin's father-in-law.; ; ; The castle was built on a commanding position overlooking the strategic route between the towns of Maidstone, Rye and Old Winchelsea and the location was also known as Sudtone and Town Sutton.; The castle keep was constructed around 1200. In 1203, Baldwin gave the castle to his daughter Alicia on her marriage to William Marshal, the Earl of Pembroke, who later remarried, passing the property to his second wife, Eleanor. After William's death, Eleanor married Simon de Montfort, the Earl of Leicester. Simon led a rebellion against King Henry III during the Second Barons' War, but was killed at the Battle of Evesham in 1265, after which Eleanor lost ownership of the castle. After the de Montfort rebellion, King Henry III gave the castle to William de Valence, his half-brother, who had supported him during the conflict. Under William, the castle and village acquired its current name of Sutton Valence. Aymer de Valence, his son, inherited the castle in 1307.English Heritage history website. The Valences travelled around their estates, increasingly focusing their attention on a handful of their various great houses, and stayed at Sutton Valence on at least several occasions.; After Aymer's death in 1324, the castle passed by marriage to Lawrence, Lord Hastings, and was held in the Hastings family until 1390, when Reginald Lord Grey de Ruthin acquired it. There are few historical records of the castle beyond this point, but it appears to have been abandoned in the early 14th century and by the 15th century had become ruined.; ; Architecture - Layout of the Castle Area Sutton Valence Castle sketch map Sutton Valence Castle is on a spur of the Chart Hills on the east side of the village of Sutton Valence. It probably comprised an inner, an outer bailey and a protective barbican, see the diagram.; Access would have been through the eastern barbican, coming to an outer bailey, but these features only survive today as earthworks. A dry ditch protected the inner bailey, which was approximately across, on the southern side of the site. The site probably included a hall, chapel and kitchen, but of the original buildings only the castle keep now survives. The keep on the South side of the site is square, with walls thick, built from ragstone and flint rubble and surviving up to high. It was originally tall, with at least three storeys, and entered through an external staircase leading to a doorway in the first floor. The building had a corner tower, in which was a spiral staircase linking the floors, and had clasping buttresses at the corners. 16th ‚Äì 21st centuries Sutton Valence castle keep in 1778 Remains of the ragstone and flint rubble keep today The historian Edward Hasted (1732-1812) in his \\"History and Topographical Survey of the County of Kent\\" described Sutton Valence Castle as being \\"now almost covered with ivy, and the branches of the trees which sprout out from the walls of it.\\" See the drawing on the right from Halstead's History. Archaeological excavations were carried out at the site during the mid-1950s with the assistance of Maidstone Museum and the local Sutton Valence School, concentrating on the area of the castle keep.

He hailed from Sakya which was the foremost monastic regime in Tibet in this period. He held the dignity from 1305 to his death in 1314. Sanggye Pal belonged to the Khangsarpa family, being the son of Sumpa Drakpa Gyaltsen. He was the younger brother of Drakpa Odzer who previously held the Dishi title.Shoju Inaba, 'The linaege of the Sa skya pa: A chapter of the Red Annals', Memoirs of the Research Department of the Toyo Bunko 22 1963, p. 112. According to the Yuan shi (History of the Yuan Dynasty), the old Dishi Jamyang Rinchen Gyaltsen (d. 1305) was followed first by a Duoerjibale (Dorje Pal) in 1305-13, and then Sangjiayizhashi (Sanggye Tashi) in 1313-14.Giuseppe Tucci, Tibetan painted scrolls. Rome 1949, Vol. I, p. 15. However, a document sent to the Tibetan myriarchy Zhalu in 1307 is issued by Sanggye Pal. It is therefore probable that Sanggye Pal took over the Dishi dignity in 1305 and kept it until 1314, and that he was also known as Dorje Pal.Shoju Inaba 1963, p. 112. For the rest, not much is known of his activities. Tibet in this period was relatively stable under the administration of the Yuan dynasty.

She is remembered as witty, wise, and beautiful, and as someone who exercised political influence for four decades during one of the most difficult periods in the country's history. Historians are divided as to whether the chronicle narratives contain more myth than fact. Hla Wun was the most well known of the three historical Pagan period queens known by the epithet Pwa Saw (lit. \\"Queen Grandmother\\", or queen dowager). The queen was the benevolent power behind the throne, shielding the public and the court from the erratic pronouncements of Narathihapate, whom chronicles describe as arrogant, gluttonous, quick-tempered, paranoid and ruthless. By using her wit, she skillfully stayed out of the king's paranoid suspicions. Although she was not always successful, the queen often managed to talk the king into changing his numerous rash decisions, and making wise state decisions. Hla Wun continued to wield influence even after Narathihapate's death in 1287. As the leader of the court, the dowager queen put Kyawswa on the throne in 1289. But she was disappointed by Kyawswa's inability to restore the fallen Pagan Empire. Chronicles say that she organized a coup against Kyawswa in 1297, and remained an √©minence grise well into the 1310s. She is said to have given her blessing to King Thihathu's claim as the rightful successor of the Pagan kings in 1313. However, one analysis of the contemporary inscriptions, though not universally accepted, finds that she may have died as early as 1295/96, and that the Pwa Saw who lived in the early 14th century was Saw Thitmahti. Background Much of her life known in Burmese popular culture is from the Burmese chronicles from the 18th and 19th centuries. Inscriptional evidence tells a far different story. Modern historians are divided on whether the chronicle narratives contain more myth than fact.Locklard 2009: 43‚Äì44 According to the chronicles, Saw Hla Wun was born to a wealthy farming family in a small village named Hseit-htein Kanbyu ()Spelling per (Hmannan Vol 1 2003: 335, 338). Maha Yazawin (Maha Yazawin Vol. 1 2006: 236) spells it as ·ÄÜ·Ä≠·Äê·Ä∫·Äê·Ä≠·Äî·Ä∫·Ä∏·ÄÄ·Äô·Ä∫·Ä∏·Äñ·Äº·Ä∞, Hseit-tein Kanbyu. in the Mount Popa region 1240‚Äì44.She was 11 when she became a junior wife of Uzana in the month of Nadaw (~November/December) in an unspecified year. Since Uzana reigned from May 1251 to May 1256, she was born sometime between 1240 and 1244. Furthermore, (Lockard 2009: 43) says she was born 1237. He seems to have simply subtracted her chronicle reported age of 12 from the Hmannan Yazawin chronicle reported accession date of Uzana, 1249. This has three issues: (1) the age of 12 in the Burmese chronicles is equal to 11 in Western age reckoning; (2) Zatadawbon Yazawin, considered to be the most accurate chronicle for the Pagan period, says Uzana came to power in 1251; and (3) chronicles do not say that Uzana met her in the first year of his reign as Lockard has assumed. Apparently a precocious child, Hla Wun became well known in the region for her intellect and supposed clairvoyance at a young age. One November, King Uzana, who was en route to Mount Popa to pay respects to the Mahagiri spirit there, heard the news about her, and had her brought before him. The king is said to have been greatly impressed by her intelligence, and made her a junior queen of his.Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 335‚Äì336(Pe, Luce 1960: 157): \\"less than a queen, more than a concubine\\". However, a contemporary inscription dedicated by the queen herself states that she was a granddaughter of King Kyaswa and Queen Saw Mon Hla. She was the second child of seven; she had an elder sister Yadanabon, and three younger brothers and two younger sisters. Her mother was an elder sister of Queen Thonlula, the chief queen of Uzana.Ba Shin 1982: 37 It means that Hla Wun was a niece of Thonlula, as well as a first cousin, once removed of Uzana. Reign Uzana years Her initial years at Pagan (Bagan) were uneventful. She remained a junior queen of Uzana who spent much of his time hunting elephants around the country.Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 336 She soon became a widow in May 1256 when the king suddenly died from a hunting accident near Dala (modern Yangon).Than Tun 1964: 134‚Äì135 The young queen had no children with the late king.Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 337 Chief queen The Mingalazedi Pagoda built by Narathihapate Her days as dowager queen were short. According to the chronicles, she became the chief queen of her step-son Narathihapate, who was put on the throne by the powerful court.Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 338 But inscriptional evidence shows that Narathihapate's first chief queen was her elder sister Yadanabon, and Hla Wun became the chief queen only in 1262 after her sister's death. Even if she was not the chief queen, Hla Wun quickly became the king's most trusted confidant and adviser. Chronicles recount several instances when she advised the king (even if he did not always take her advice). Her first key advice was to recall Yazathingyan to put down the rebellions. The king, who had just exiled the old minister, grudgingly agreed to her advice in 1258. Yazathingyan went on to put down the rebellions.Harvey 1925: 61‚Äì62 Most of the time, however, her job appeared to have been to control the wild destructive excesses of the king, whom the chronicles describe as \\"an ogre\\", who was \\"great in wrath, haughtiness and envy, exceeding covetous and ambitious.\\"Pe, Luce 1960: 167 Using her wit, she could often, though not always, overrule his impulsive, careless, paranoid decisions, and talk him into making wiser decisions. Some were comparatively mundane: she once talked the king to rescind a death sentence of a lady-in-waiting, whose only crime was to sneeze loudly in the king's audience.Pe, Luce 1960: 167‚Äì168 Some were of far more consequence: she, with the help of the Primate, got the king to issue a decree stating that his death sentences be suspended for a fortnight to allow his anger to cool. (The decree came too late to save Queen Saw Lon, whose death sentence prompted the king's remorse afterwards.) Her success in controlling the widely despised king won her the support of the court and the public. But she had to keep her wits about her to avoid the wrath of an increasingly paranoid king who executed any perceived enemies. At any rate, she was the only one he trusted. The paranoid king put her in charge of managing his daily meals, which according to the chronicles must total 300 dishes. (He also made all his queens and children eat the same meals at the same time with him.)Pe, Luce 1960: 170‚Äì171 In exile Hla Wun remained loyal to the end but she had long lost respect for the king. In 1285, she accompanied the king who had decided to flee to Lower Burma from the latest Mongol invasion rather than fight. There, she reportedly had to console her immature, gluttonous husband who dejectedly sobbed after learning that he would have to make do with just 150-dish dinners.Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 355 In 1287, the king officially became a Mongol vassal in exchange for a Mongol withdrawal from northern Burma, and planned to return to Pagan. The queen advised him not to return to the upcountry without having first raised a substantial army for much of the country was in revolt, and to avoid the Prome route for she believed Thihathu, the viceroy of Prome, was not trustworthy. The king discarded her advice on both counts. He replied that he would raise an army at Prome with the help of his son Thihathu. The royal family sailed up the Irrawaddy with a small group of guards.Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 356‚Äì357 At Prome, as she predicted, Thihathu's men seized the royal flotilla, and Thihathu asked his father to choose between taking the poisoned food and dying by sword. The king asked his chief queen one last time for advice. On her advice, he bestowed his royal ring to her, prayed that \\"may no male-child be ever born to him again in all his future existences before attaining the nirvana\\", and consumed his last meal. Thihathu did spare her life.Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 357‚Äì358Htin Aung 1967: 70‚Äì71 Kingmaker Narathihapate's death officially marked the end of the two-and- a-half-century-old Pagan Empire. The country was in chaos, with each region claiming a king. Now, the dowager queen, Hla Wun managed to return to Pagan, hoping to restore the kingdom. At Pagan, she became the leader of the remaining old court. A year and half after her husband's death, on 30 May 1289, she put one of Narathihapate's sons, Kyawswa, on the throne.Htin Aung 1967: 72Than Tun 1959: 119‚Äì120 For some reason, she did not choose her only son (and child) Yazathu as king.The son may have been unwell. Per (Ba Shin 1982: 39), Yazathu died on 10 May 1291 (Thursday, 11th waxing of Nayon 653 ME). The inscription at a temple she dedicated right after the son's death shows that she was devastated by the death. Though it is not universally accepted, one assessment of the inscriptional evidence finds that she may have died 1295/1296. The standard Burmese chronicles Maha Yazawin and Hmannan Yazawin say she lived longer, anointing at least one more king of Pagan. Hmannan says she lived to at least 1313 when she gave her official blessing to the coronation of Thihathu of Myinsaing (not the patricide Thihathu of Prome). According to the chronicles, she was hugely disappointed by the ineffectual Kyawswa whose real authority did not extend beyond a small region around Pagan. The real power in central Burma now belonged to the three former Pagan commanders and brothers from the nearby Myinsaing. She felt betrayed when Kyawswa, who wanted to counter the rising power of the brothers, decided to become a vassal of the Mongols in 1297.Htin Aung 1967: 73 Though she did not care much for the three brothers, whom she viewed as usurpers, she plotted with them to remove Kyawswa.Htin Aung 1967: 74Harvey 1925: 76 In December 1297, she persuaded Kyawswa to visit Myinsaing, ostensibly to lead a dedication ceremony of a monastery. Kyawswa felt secure and went to Myinsaing. But as soon as the ceremony was over, he was arrested, dethroned, and forced to become a monk in the very monastery he had just dedicated. The queen now placed Saw Hnit, a 14-year-old son of Kyawswa, on the throne. Though he was still styled as king, the inexperienced Saw Hnit was for all intents and purposes a puppet of the three brothers, his regents.(Maha Yazawin Vol. 1 2006: 259): The charade ended on 20 October 1309 when the youngest Thihathu officially proclaimed himself king. Saw Hnit did not protest but the eldest brother Athinhkaya apparently did. Athinhkaya was assassinated by Thihathu on 13 April 1310 per (Maha Yazawin Vol. 1 2006: 254). She had to accept the arrangement although she never fully acknowledged the presence of a new dynasty in Upper Burma.Htin Aung 1967: 76 Nevertheless, she remained the symbol of the old dynasty, and her imprimatur was still much sought after. According to Hmannan, Thihathu asked her to anoint him as the rightful successor of Pagan at his coronation ceremony at Pinya. The queen flat out refused; in fact, she was quite insulting in her reply. It was only after Thihathu sent another humble letter that she relented. On 7 February 1313, at Thihathu's coronation ceremony, the dowager queen presented to Thihathu a golden belt and a golden tray, which had been handed down in the royal family since the time of King Anawrahta.Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 370‚Äì371Harvey 1925: 78 Historicity The historical Queen Pwa Saw did exist. In fact, a 1966 analysis of the contemporary inscriptions by Ba Shin finds that there were at least three Pwa Saws: Saw Min Waing, Saw Hla Wun and Saw Thitmahti. (There was also a fourth Pwa Saw in the Pinya period; she was Mi Saw U.) All three queens left a number of stone inscriptions at the temples and monasteries they donated.Ba Shin 1982: 22‚Äì25 Some of the points in his analysis are:See (Ba Shin 1982) for the full paper. # The personal name of Narapathihapate's chief queen Pwa Saw was Saw Hla Wun. The chronicles do not mention her personal name. # Saw Hla Wun was of royal descent. The chronicles' account that she was a commoner country girl is incorrect.Ba Shin 1982: 38 # Hla Wun became the chief queen only in 1262, not at the coronation of Narathihapate [in November 1256]. # Hla Wun was also a queen of King Kyawswa.Ba Shin 1982: 40, 43, 46 # She was likely dead by 1295/96. # After her death, her younger sister, Saw Thitmahti, became the chief queen of Kyawswa, (as well as that of Saw Hnit), and became known as Pwa Saw herself.Ba Shin 1982: 41 The paper cites a 1302 inscription by Thitmathi, which mentions that her elder sister the queen had died before Kyawswa's dethronement [in 1297].Ba Shin 1982: 41‚Äì43 It is unclear if the paper has been peer-reviewed.The paper is in Burmese. It is unclear if there is an English translation or if non-Burmese reading international Burma scholars have reviewed it. At any rate, the paper seems to be held in high regard as it was reprinted in 1982 by the Burma Historical Research Department in its Silver Jubilee publication. Not all of the points seem to be accepted by scholarship.(Maha Yazawin Vol. 1 2006: 234, footnote 1): The editors of the 2006 edition of Maha Yazawin from the Universities Historical Research Department agree that there were three Pwa Saws in the late Pagan period. But they do not say that Hla Wun was Kyawswa's queen, or that Hla Wun and Thamahti were sisters. Since Ba Shin's date of her death depends on the two queens being sisters, the editors seem to be staying with the chronicle narrative that Hla Wun lived beyond 1296. In popular culture Queen Pwa Saw is remembered as witty, wise, and beautiful, exercising political influence for 40 years during one of the most difficult periods in Burmese history. * She Was a Queen, a fiction by Maurice CollisBa Shin 1982: 22 * A song about her by Dora Than E Notes References Bibliography     * Category:Chief queens consort of Pagan Category:1240s births Category:Year of death uncertain ","title":"Pwa Saw"},{"id":"44916636","text":"Rajinder Khanna is the former chief of the Research and Analysis Wing, the external intelligence agency of India.

Events MV Blue Sky M. In December 2014, Moldovan-flagged MV Blue Sky M left Korfez, Turkey heading for Rijeka in Croatia. On 30 December 2014, when the ship was near the island of Othonoi a passenger of the ship called an emergency number for help from a mobile phone. The alarm was raised because of suspected armed people on board, Greek state television reported, claiming that \\"illegal immigrants\\" were on the ship. But a coastguard official later said the Greek frigate had contacted the cargo ship's captain, who said the ship was not in any danger and was not requesting assistance. Shortly after this, the vessel changed course and - now headed towards southern Italy - was seemingly abandoned by its crew. As the ship neared Santa Maria di Leuca, on mainland Italy's southernmost tip, Italian port authorities dispatched two helicopters as a precaution and boarded the ship with a team of six Italian coast guard officials. The team took control of the ship after realising there was no crew to be found. The Italian coast guard said 970 migrants were on board the ship, mostly believed to be Syrians fleeing the country's ongoing civil war, although the actual number of migrants was subsequently revised downwards. The migrants paid thousands of dollars each to smugglers to get them to Europe. The smugglers apparently left the ship's controls on autopilot and then abandoned ship ‚Äì leaving the Blue Sky M to head towards the Italian coast. The migrants inside did not know what was going on. Italian coast guard spokesman Filippo Marini was quoted as saying the Italians had averted a disaster by interrupting the programmed route that would have had the ship crash into the shore. \\"It was a real race against the clock\\", he said, adding: \\"Unlocking the engines was a difficult and delicate operation, but they managed to do it.\\" Italian coastguards docked the ship at the Italian port of Gallipoli. The migrants were taken to local schools and a gymnasium. Thirty-five of them were taken to hospital, with some treated for hypothermia. The Italian Red Cross initially said that four people were found dead on the ship but later withdrew its report.

The band was formed in 1992 around the songwriting of principal member David DeVoe. New Ben Franklins are active currently in the Colorado music scene, continuing to record albums and perform live.  Biography   Early years  In fall of 1991, David DeVoe drove out to California to bring back his childhood friend Malcolm Tent, who had been living in the San Francisco bay area for the previous few years. On their drive back they decided to put together a band in the Denver scene. Recruiting Andy Harris, who worked with DeVoe at a local record shop, to play bass guitar, the band began their life as a 3-piece backed by a drum machine. Initially, the band's intention was to make music in the vein of The Sisters of Mercy and Red Lorry Yellow Lorry. The band began playing shows in the Denver area and released their first cassette, titled Blake. The band also included a version of the Adam And The Ants' song ‚ÄúAnts Invasion‚Äù on the EP, a song that was also staple of their early live sets along with covers from the likes of Love & Rockets, Ricky Nelson, and The Rolling Stones. Continuing to play in the Denver scene, the band replaced their drum machine with local drummer George Edwards. The band self-recorded and produced their second cassette release, No Songs For Christine, in 1993, with vocal duties split fairly evenly between Tent and DeVoe, foreshadowing the departure of Tent from the band's line up late in 1993. The freedom of performing as a 3-piece led to new experimentation with sound and songwriting and in mid-summer 1994 the band released their third cassette, Deaf Child Blind, also recorded and produced by DeVoe at his Dingo's Kidney Studios with the help of Michael Smith (Fiction 8).  Late 90s/2000s  In 1996, New Ben Franklins slowed their live schedule due to lineup changes. DeVoe continued to write and record songs, aided most of the time by George Edwards and other friends from the Denver scene. In 1997, DeVoe moved to Alaska, effectively ending the Franklins' activity for several years. By the mid-2000s, DeVoe had returned to Colorado and, after playing as auxiliary guitarist on a couple of west-coast tours with friends' bands, he returned to writing for the Franklins. He recruited drummer Mark Kosta and bassist David Meyer for the new incarnation of the band, and they immediately began playing shows around the Colorado Front Range.  Americana years  In mid 2008, a mutual friend introduced steel guitar player Tom Oberheide to DeVoe, bringing DeVoe's new focus on playing ‚Äúshoegazer noise rock with twang‚Äù into clearer focus. DeVoe's songwriting and musical history relied heavily on a classic country influence, and the band's new sound was enhanced with the addition of the steel guitar. The band also began planning and performing an annual Waylon Jennings tribute show every February, near the anniversary of the singer's death. In 2009, the band released their first CD of the new millennium, simply titled EP. The follow-up release in early 2011 was titled Miserable, and featured Benjamin Williams on bass guitar, replacing David Meyer in the band's line up. The band spent most of 2011 playing shows and recording their 14-song album titled [peter gabriel], which was released in April 2012. Soon after the album's release Tom Oberheide left the band and was replaced by Graham Armer on second guitar. The next few years found the band going through a few lineup changes and releasing new recordings on various compilations. In early 2014, the band joined the non-profit music co-op Rainless Records. On October 16, 2015 the band released two new CDs. The first was titled Something Old Something New, and contained nine new songs penned by David DeVoe. The second was titled Something Borrowed Something Blue, and was a limited edition collection of cover songs. In March of 2017, the band released What Happens When Things Fall Apart. The album was written and recorded by DeVoe with a cast of 5 different bass players and 8 different drummers. It is a dark and brooding album, one that recalls the band's earliest works.

Two geographic features, Blunt Cove and Point Blunt are named for him. Wilkes Expedition Blunt joined the U.S. Navy and in 1838, he was assigned to the USS Porpoise, under the command of Captain C. Ringgold and passed midshipman on June 23. before the ship joined the Wilkes Expedition in early August. In March, 1839, at Orange Bay he transferred to the USS Vincennes. On January 16, 1840, the expedition sailed close enough to Antarctica to see the actual continent;Stanton, op. cit. p. 156 Blunt Cove is named for him. Blunt took sick in April, 1841 in Honolulu, possibly from participating in the trip to the summit of Mauna Loa Volcano. The Expedition reached Oregon on April 28, and explored the coast from there to San Francisco Bay. He was promoted to Lieutenant on July 28, 1842, a few weeks after the expedition had arrived back in New York. Intermediate years In 1844‚Äì45, Blunt was assigned to the USS Truxtun in activities off the coast of Liberia. When he returned, he attended the newly formed United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. On January 27, 1846, Blunt married Ellen Lloyd Key, daughter of Francis Scott Key, in Washington D.C. They had three children: Alice Key (1847‚Äì1927); John Yell (Young?) Mason (1848‚Äì1916); and Mary Lloyd (1850‚Äì). John Y. Mason named his son for Blunt in 1848. Charting San Francisco Bay In 1849, Blunt was appointed to a Joint Commission of Army and Navy Officers (Joint Commission) whose purpose was to identify potential sites for lighthouses and defense facilities along the Pacific Coast of the California and Oregon territories. The Joint Commission consisted of three army engineers: Maj. John L. Smith, Maj Cornelius Austin Ogden and 1st Lt. Danville Leadbetter; and three naval officers: Comdr Louis M. Goldsborough, Comdr. G.J. Van Brunt, and Blunt. and had assembled in San Francisco by early April 1849.http://www.nps.gov/alca/photosmultimedia/upload/therock-web.pdf Blunt, either on his own or with the rest of the members of the Joint Commission presumably joined his former Captain on the Porpoise, now \\"Commodore\\" C. Ringgold on the chartered brig Col. Fremont to chart the San Francisco Bay region, suddenly important because of the discovery of gold in the area. Ringgold named Point Blunt on Angel Island for him. Afterwards, Blunt assisted Commodore Ringgold in the creation of two charts: * Chart of the Farallones and entrance to the Bay of San Francisco, California (1850) * Chart of the Bay of San Pablo, Straits of Carquinez, and part of the Bay of San Francisco (1850) Blunt also drew a lithograph, View of Benicia from the anchorage east of Seal Island for Ringgold's Chart of Suisun & Vallejo bays with the confluence of the rivers Sacramento and San Joaquin, California A colored version of the lithograph was published in 1852. The Joint Commission may have been joined by members of the land branch of the Pacific division of the United States Coast Survey (Pacific Coast Survey), James S. Williams and Richard P. Hammond who were unable to find boats to charter and James Blair. The USS Massachusetts was transferred to the Navy in San Francisco on August 1, 1849, and detailed for the use of the Joint Commission to take up and down the coast, however they could not recruit a crew. They borrowed some crewmen from another ship and Blunt may have made his second trip to Hawaii, where the Massachusetts wintered and hired native crewmen. Upon its return, the Joint Commission made preliminary recommendations to President Fillmore to reserve various islands and coastal regions in and around San Francisco Bay. then they and the Massachusetts sailed up to Puget Sound. After a cursory examination of the mouth of the Columbia River, the ship and the Joint Commission returned to California in July 1850. After a trip to San Diego, the Joint Commission made its final recommendation on November 30, 1850. Activities on the Pacific Coast If Blunt went with the Joint Commission to Hawaii, immediately upon his return he separated from it and the Massachusetts. On March 10, 1850 Blunt was in command of the Schooner Arabian with another military survey party en route to Trinidad Bay.Daily Alta California, March 11, 1850 Upon reaching the bay, a boat with a landing party from the schooner swamped, resulting in the drowning of five men: Lieutenants Richard Bache and Robert L. Browning, John H. Peoples, W. W. Cheshire and John Purdy. Five more men survived.Placer Times, April 22, 1850 Blunt appears to have continued to the Columbia River and explored the Willamette Valley, and by August 1, 1850, to have attached to the Survey Schooner Ewing of the Pacific Coast Survey. In a letter of that date from William Pope McArthur (the first leader of the hydrographic branch of the Pacific Coast Survey) to his father-in-law Commander John J. Young, McArthur wrote: \\"Lt. Blunt who is now with me has traveled considerably through the country (the Willamette Valley) and is so much pleased with it, that he has taken a section of land and made a regular claim to it, he has also taken one for myself and one for Lt. Bartlett, both adjoining his!\\" (emphasis added). McArther was commander of Ewing, and Barlett one of its officers. (The Ewing had also wintered in Hawaii in 1849‚Äì50, giving opportunity for Blunt to become well acquainted with both men.) By August 31, 1850, Blunt was back in San Francisco, from which location he wrote to Mason The Ewing worked its way south to San Diego then returned to San Francisco, and both McArthur and Barlett left for the east coast. At the end of December 1850, the Ewing was severely damaged in a storm while attempting to take the new land branch of the Pacific Coast Survey, George Davidson and James S. Lawson to Monterey Bay. Upon her repair, she traveled up the coast to the Columbia River.Lewis, op. cit. p. 14 If Blunt was with the Ewing he was back by early to mid summer, when he was a signer of the constitution of the San Francisco Committee of Vigilance In August, he may have visited John Charles and Jessie Benton Fr√©mont at their home in the same city. On January 15, 1852, Secretary of the Navy Will A. Graham ordered a Naval Commission to select a site for a Naval Yard. Blunt, along with Commodore D. Sloat Commodore C. Ringgold, and William P.S. Sanger (former overseer of construction of Drydock Number One, Norfolk Naval Shipyard) were appointed to the commission. On July 13, 1852, Sloat recommended Mare Island to Graham. SS Winfield Scott Blunt was hired as the Captain of the SS Winfield Scott, which carried passengers, mail and cargo between San Francisco and Panama. Having surveyed the Santa Barbara Channel a few years previously, on December 1, 1853, Blunt believed he knew it well enough to try to save time by steaming through it at full speed (Blunt may have been on the Ewing with his former crew member on the Wilkes Expedition, James Alden in the latter part of 1851, when Alden and the Ewing scouted the channel, as well as possibly having scouted it in the latter part of 1850 on either the Massachusetts or the Ewing.) even when warned about adverse conditions ahead. Upon encountering a heavy fog, Blunt slowed the ship down to 10 knots, but did not realize the current had taken the ship to the west, and the Winfield Scott ran aground off the shores of Anacapa Island. After seeing to the rescue of the passengers and salvage of the mail and cargo, he continued to \\"Atlantic States on a visit to his family and for the purpose of representing in person, the loss of the steamer of which he formerly had commanded.\\" Death Blunt died in Baltimore on April 27, 1854. His widow, Ellen Lloyd Key Blunt, was the subject of a March 7, 1856 letter by Jessie Benton Fr√©mont to Elizabeth Blair Lee, lamenting Blunt's financial situation.Fr√©mont, op. cit. pp. 91-93 Fr√©mont attempted to intervene on Blunt's behalf by writing to George W. Blunt, son of Edmund March Blunt (no known relationship to Simon Blunt), imploring him to buy a patent for a device developed by Simon Blunt to lower lifeboats into the water.Fr√©mont, op. cit. pp. 178-79, But, towards the end of 1859, Fr√©mont was exasperated with Blunt. Ellen Blunt relocated to Paris in 1861 to give dramatic readings;Fr√©mont op. cit. pp. 222, 225 she died in 1884. Joseph Conrad used Simon and Ellen's names \\"Captain Blunt\\" and \\"Mrs. Blunt\\" in his book The Arrow of Gold. Blunt's journal and a collection of his letters are archived in a collection in his name at the Virginia Historical Society.

Musically, Black Metal features more traditional pop song structures than Blunt's previous work, but is diverse in instrumentation and genre. The album includes elements of indie pop, folk pop, Americana, dub, ambient, grime, drone, and dancehall. Critics have also noted the prose of Blunt's lyrics as being similar to contemporary hip hop lyrics, which often reflect that of dark subjects like infidelity and alcoholism. Blunt has stated that the album was inspired by what he sees as black artistic liberation away from the appropriation of 'existing/old white images' (a la names like Black Elvis, Black Cobain) toward 'something that is undefined and is new'. Critical reception Black Metal currently has a score of 79 on Metacritic, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Critics praised Blunt's emotional range and directness on the album. In a review for The Observer, Killian Fox wrote that Blunt had created \\"some of the most achingly beautiful music recorded this year.\\" Writing for Pitchfork, Colin Joyce called the album \\"disjointed\\" but praised the album for its sound and for Blunt's clearer, more pop-oriented style compared to his previous work.

He belonged to the abbot family Khon of Sakya which had a precedence position in Tibet in this era. He held the dignity from 1314 to his death in 1327. Appointment as Imperial Preceptor Kunga Lotro Gyaltsen was one of the 13 sons of the abbot-ruler (dansa chenpo) Zangpo Pal (d. 1323). His mother was Jomo Kunga Bumphulwa, the widow of the Tibetan administrator (dpon-chen or ponchen) Aglen.Shoju Inaba, 'The lineage of the Sa skya pa: A chapter of the Red Annals', Memoirs of the Research Department of the Toyo Bunko 22 1963, 110. The position of Imperial Preceptor or Dishi was always kept separate from that of abbot-ruler, and since 1286 it had been held by members of the Sharpa and Khangsarpa families. However, after the demise of the Dishi Sanggye Pal in 1314, a member of the Khon family was once again appointed. Kunga Lotro Gyaltsen was summoned to the imperial court in North China by the great khan Ayurbarwada, and formally installed on 27 March 1315.Luciano Petech, Central Tibet and the Mongols: The Y√ºan-Sa-skya period of Tibetan history. Rome 1990, p. 77. As Dishi he had a paramount influence in the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs or Xuanzheng Yuan, the department handling Buddhist and Tibetan affairs. His decrees carried the weight of the imperial authority.Luciano Petech 1990, p. 37. A letter by his hand, issued in 1316, begins: \\"By the king's order, the words of Kunga Lotro Gyaltsen Palzangpo, imperial preceptor: To the officials of Pacification Commissioner rank, to generals, soldiers, administrators of the nang so, to judges, holders of golden letters, chiefs of districts, laymen and monks who collect taxes and go and come, to myriarchs, to dignitaries, a command.\\"Kurtis Schaeffer et al. (eds), Sources of Tibetan tradition. New York 2013, p. 344. Division of the Khon family The period c. 1290-1330 was relatively stable, since the Yuan-Sakya system of governance had finally been accepted after much bloodshed. The serious decline of the Yuan Dynasty had still not set in. The tenure of Kunga Lotro Gyaltsen spanned over the reigns of the great khans Ayurbarwada, Gegeen Khan, and Yes√ºn Tem√ºr Khan. However, this period also saw a family situation of the Khon family that planted the seeds of future dissent. In 1322 Kunga Lotro Gyaltsen returned to Sakya from Beijing in order to receive his final ordination as monk. On arrival he proceeded to bring order in the heritage of his aging father. The reason was either that the great khan had ordered him to do so, or the difficulties to discipline his numerous brothers. In the end he divided the brothers into four groups. Each group would receive part of the heritage and had their own residence (ladrang) in Sakya. They were the Zhitog, Lhakang, Rinchengang, and Ducho branches, each of which had its own abbot (dansa). The partition was finalized in late 1323 or early 1324, shortly after the death of the old Zangpo Pal. In practice it meant that the prestige and influence of Sakya was weakened.Luciano Petech 1990, p. 81. One of the brothers, Khatsun Namkha Lekpa Gyaltsen was formal abbot-ruler after the death of his father, but seems to have exercised limited authority. As for Kunga Lotro Gyaltsen he returned to the imperial capital in the summer of 1324. In 1326 his health declined and he prepared to leave for his Tibetan homeland again. He did not actually leave the capital, however, possibly because of a revolt that broke out in Amdo in eastern Tibet. He died on 6 March 1327. His successor was a brother, Kunga Lekpa Jungne Gyaltsen.Luciano Petech 1990, p. 82-3.

She is best known for her significant impact on the historic preservation and conservation of that city. Early life Chase was born in Boston, Massachusetts and moved to Santa Barbara at the age of 12. After graduating from Santa Barbara High School in 1904, she attended the University of California at Berkeley where she was a member of Kappa Alpha Theta.http://heritage.kappaalphatheta.org/page/notablethetas She graduated with a Bachelors in the History of Letters in 1909. Civic advocacy Upon returning to Santa Barbara after graduating from the University of California at Berkeley, Chase was appalled at the state of her hometown: : I was ashamed of the dirt and dust and ugly buildings and resolved then and there to devote my life to making Santa Barbara beautiful. She had a significant influence on the architecture of the city of Santa Barbara,Ty Smith, \\"'A delightful deception': The politics of public memory and the re-creation of Spanish Santa Barbara, 1920-1987,\\" doctoral dissertation, University of California, Santa Barbara but Chase never held political or government office of any sort. Chase was largely responsible for the recasting of Santa Barbara architecture in the Spanish Colonial Style in the wake of the 1925 Santa Barbara earthquake. She founded a number of civic institutions in Santa Barbara, including the local chapter of the American Red Cross, the Community Arts Association, the Santa Barbara Trust for Historic Preservation, and the Indian Defense Association. She was involved in advocacy for the protection of multiple local landmarks, including Chase Palm Park (which bears a plaque memorializing Chase and her brother), as well as the Moreton Bay Fig Tree. The Moreton Bay Fig Tree In addition, she was part of an interest group which successfully lobbied the State Legislature, Governor Earl Warren, and the Regents of the University of California to move the Santa Barbara State Teachers College to the University of California system in 1944. Historian Walker A. Tompkins summarized her influence on the city by saying that \\"She did more to beautify her adopted home town of Santa Barbara than any other individual.\\" Legacy Portrait of Pearl Chase at the Santa Barbara Community Center Chase was part of the founding of an organization called the Santa Barbara Council of Christmas Cheer, which brought gifts to needy community members. This organization was eventually formalized as the Unity Shoppe, a storefront on State Street which \\"operates a year-round 'Free' grocery and clothing store so people can shop with dignity for their basic needs.\\" The Unity Shoppe, on State Street in Santa Barbara, is derived from a charitable group founded by Chase. A scholarship in Chase's name has been instituted at University of California, Santa Barbara in the department of Environmental Studies.

Each trestle consists of five posts, one vertical and two to each side of it at an angle. Up to half-way up the pier it is reinforced by solid horizontal planking, and above that by diagonal beams on each side of the pier. The five beams which support the roadway sit on a round-ended beam on top of each pier. The abutments are granite, and the piers have metal plates on their upstream faces to protect against debris.

He belonged to the abbot family Khon of Sakya which had a precedence position in Tibet in this era. He held the dignity from 1327 to 1330. Family background Kunga Lekpa Jungne Gyaltsen was one of the 13 sons of the abbot-ruler of Sakya, Zangpo Pal (d. 1323). His mother was Machig Yondagmo.Shoju Inaba, 'The lineage of the Sa skya pa: A chapter of the Red Annals', Memoirs of the Research Department of the Toyo Bunko 22 1963, 110. When his elder brother Kunga Lotro Gyaltsen held the dignity of Dishi, he decreed a division of Zangpo Pal's many sons into four groups, each of which resided in a particular palace (Zhitog, Lhakhang, Rinchengang, and Ducho). Kunga Lekpa Jungne Gyaltsen belonged to the Lhakhang branch. When the Dishi died in the imperial capital in March 1327, he was summoned by the emperor Yes√ºn Tem√ºr to take up the dignity and was formally installed on 17 May 1327. He only arrived to Beijing in the next year, the route from Central Tibet being long and difficult.Luciano Petech, Central Tibet and the Mongols: The Y√ºan-Sa-skya period of Tibetan history. Rome 1990, p. 83. Contest for the Imperial Preceptor title During the short tenure of Kunga Lekpa Jungne Gyaltsen a mysterious incident took place. According to the Yuan shi (History of the Yuan dynasty) a certain Nianzhenqilasi (Rinchen Drak) was elevated to the Imperial Preceptor (Dishi) dignity on 22 December 1329, when Kunga Lekpa Jungne Gyaltsen was still alive. The closer circumstances are missing in the sources, and it is obvious that Rinchen Drak did not belong to the Khon family. It is possible that he is identical with the Guoshi (State Preceptor) Rinchen Drak who is known to have been literary active in 1325. He might have been temporarily elevated by a faction at the imperial court which strove to exclude the Khon family of Sakya from the office. There was a rapid shift of emperors in 1328-29 which might be the backdrop for this brief alteration.Luciano Petech 1990, pp. 83-4. According to the most reliable sources Kunga Lekpa Jungne Gyaltsen died in 1330 after a term of three years, suggesting that he managed to retain or regain his office in the end. In one version he died as late as in 1339.Luciano Petech 1990, p. 83. He was succeeded by his younger brother Kunga Gyaltsen. As common in the Khon family he married and sired children before his full ordination as monk. Of his five children, Sonam Lotro (1332-1362) briefly served as imperial preceptor in 1361-1362, when the Yuan dynasty was already in its death throes. Another son, Drakpa Gyaltsen (1336-1376) was formally viceroy of Tibet in 1360-76, at a time when the Sakya regime had already been replaced by the Phagmodrupa Dynasty.Shoju Inaba 1963, p. 110-1; George Roerich, The Blue Annals.

Description It is an herbaceous plant; it usually grows to 1.5 meters. in most cases it has many branches with leaves between 5 and 10 cm long, its shape varies form linear ovate to lance-shaped. Distribution Iresine angustifolia occurs in the southwestern part of the United States, Mexico, Central America, South America, West Indies and some islands of the Caribbean. It can be found at middle to lower altitudes usually on banks near the coast but also on thickets and on dry districts. Uses It is not cultivated, however it is considered useful in traditional herbal medicine in treating the bites of the insect also known as arlomo. Taxonomy In 1788, it was first identified by Bengt Anders Euphras√©n on Saint Barth√©lemy. He published a detailed description of the plant in a book about the condition and flora of the Island. It was first published in Swedish in 1975 and then in German in 1978. Common name In Mexico its common name is arlomo.

Education and career Molinaro has degrees from Brock University and McMaster University and received his doctorate from the Department of Education, University of Toronto. For doctoral research he interviewed four employees and their co- workers about an approach to work which was based not on materialism but on substance, spirituality, reflective practice, and on building strong relationships with others. The resulting doctoral thesis was entitled Holism at work, exploring the experiences of individuals creating a new holistic story of work. Authorship Molinaro's first two books, The Leadership Gap and Leadership Solutions, were co-authored with David S. Weiss and Liane Davey.The Leadership Gap ranked #3 on list of best selling business books by the Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail in May 2011. It claims that the growth of an organization can outstrip its capacity to cultivate a sufficient quantity of leaders, and that this \\"leadership gap\\" can be corrosive. The book proposes a system for identifying high priority gaps and filling them. Reviewing the book in the Journal of Organizational Excellence, LaRoi Lawton said, \\"The highly motivated, self-directed reader can gain a great deal of learning and other results from using the guidelines and materials in this timely book.\\" Writing about the book in CMA Management magazine, Robert Coleman stated \\"Building leadership capacity for the future can be a challenge, and pundits have started to jump into the fray.\\" The book review in the same issue comments that \\"The Leadership Gap provides a road map for creating such an [leadership development] environment.\\" His most recent book, The Leadership Contract, claims the majority of employees accept leadership positions without \\"reading the fine print.\\" He draws on an analogy to web site users who accept the terms of service of the site without ever reading them. He advocates that an employee who wants to cut through bureaucratic sclerotics and make changes in their organizations instead make a conscious decision to lead, going so far as to write down, sign, and date an explicit \\"leadership contract\\" with herself or himself. The book ranked #4 on The New York Times Best Seller list in the Hard cover business books category for the month of September 2013 and #3 in the Advice, how-to, & miscellaneous category for August 2013. In a five-star review at Goodreads, Carolyn Kost found the book inspiring. Writing for Inc. magazine, Minda Zetlin comments that making these four commitments may determine effectiveness. In a review for a Colorado State University magazine, Sara Daubert says the book \\"offers practical suggestions\\" but cautions that some of the examples are \\"more remedial\\" in nature and that some are \\"lengthy and lack relevance.\\" Molinaro contributed three articles for the book The Trainer's Portable Mentor edited by Terrence L. Gargiulo, namely \\"The Synergy of Co-Facilitation: Creating Powerful Learning Experiences\\", \\"The Integrated Approach to Leadership Development\\" (with David Weiss), and \\"The Trainer as a CAPABLE Leader\\" (also with Weiss). For the Banff Centre, he wrote \\"Driving Employee Engagement\\", again with Weiss. Nick Morgan, reviewing Molinaro's blog for Forbes, observed: \\"Vince's blog will make any leader stop and think about the predominant model of leadership that still exists today.\\" He has authored two articles for Harvard Business Review, namely, \\"Do Millennials Really Want Their Bosses to Call Their Parents?\\" and \\"Why a Corporate Scandal Will Follow You Even If You Weren‚Äôt Involved.\\" References External links * Official channel on YouTube Category:McMaster University alumni Category:University of Toronto alumni Category:Brock University alumni Category:Businesspeople from Ontario Category:1962 births Category:Living people ","title":"Vince Molinaro"},{"id":"44917334","text":"Johnny Sims (born October 14, 1967) is a former American football lineman who played one season with the New Orleans Night of the Arena Football League.

They played their home games either in their old Landhof Stadium or in their new St. Jakob Stadium. Lucien Schmidlin was voted as new club chairman at the AGM to follow Ernst Weber, who had announced his retirement from the position.  Overview  The Czechoslovakian manager Ji≈ô√≠ Sobotka was the club manager at this time, he taken the job over from Jen≈ë Vincze a year before. A season earlier many youngsters had joined the team and this pre-season the same occurred again. Rolf L√ºdi, Enrico Mazzola and Hansruedi Herr were brought up from reserve team. Abraham Levy and Arnold Hofer joined from local team FC Breitenbach, also Werner Meier joined from local team Nordstern Basel. During the winter break Bruno Gatti joined from Black Stars Basel. One of the biggest transfers made during this time was the transfer of the 19 year old Karl Odermatt from Concordia Basel. Odermatt joined in a swop, Hansueli Oberer and Silvan Th√ºler went to Concordia. Not only these two players left the squad, Paul Speidel moved on to Cantonal Neuchatel and Josef H√ºgi (Hugi II) was nearly at the end of his football career. \\"Seppe\\" Hugi had played 363 competition games for the club and in these had scored 272 goals, he moved on to play for Z√ºrich.

Of these friendly games, five were won, three drawn and two ended in a defeat, Basel scored 29 goals and conceded 19. Basel were appointed as one of four Swiss representatives in the International Football Cup (IFC). The 1962‚Äì63 IFC took place during in the summer break. Basel played in Group B3 together with PSV Eindhoven, HNK Rijeka and Rot-Weiss Oberhausen. Basel ended the group stage in third position, winners of the group were HNK Rijeka who thus advanced to the quarter-finals. There were fourteen teams contesting in the 1962‚Äì63 Nationalliga A. These were the top 12 teams from the previous season 1961‚Äì62 and the two newly promoted teams Chiasso and Sion. The Championship was played in a double round-robin, the champions were to be qualified for 1963‚Äì64 European Cup and the bottom placed two teams in the table were to be relegated. Basel finished the championship in sixth position with twenty six points, with ten wins and six draws from 26 matches, scoring 59 goals conceding 51. FC Z√ºrich won the championship.

In the quarter-finals, played on 24 February 1963, Basel were drawn away against Chiasso and Basel achieved a 2‚Äì1 victory. The semi-final was played on 24 March in the St. Jakob Stadium. Basel beat Lausanne-Sports 1‚Äì0 the winning goal scored by Markus Pfirter. The Wankdorf Stadium hosted the Swiss Cup Final on 15 April and Basel played against favorites Grasshopper Club Z√ºrich. Two goals after half time, one by Heinz Blumer and the second from Otto Ludwig gave Basel a 2‚Äì0 victory and their third Cup win in their history. A unique story for the history books over this Cup season belongs Bruno Gatti. In the third round he was member of the Black Stars team and was knocked out of the competition. During the winter break he was hired by Basel. In the final Gatti played the full 90 minutes and became cup winner.

He was the brother of John Buckner, Bishop of Chichester, and grandfather of portraitist Richard Buckner. Early life Charles Buckner was christened in the parish of Boxgrove, Sussex in 1735, the son of Richard Buckner, steward to the Duke of Richmond, and Mary, n√©e Saunders. He married Mary Parke in 1763 and they had three children, Charles, Mary, and Richard. After his first wife's death, he married Anne Frewen, who was a great aunt of celebrated engineer Fleeming Jenkin, as recounted in Robert Louis Stevenson's Memoir of Fleeming Jenkin (1888). Stevenson describes him as \\"that tall, rough-voiced, formidable uncle\\" who \\"was no enemy of dunces; he loved courage\\".p. xvii In addition to his naval career, he was mayor of Chichester in 1784 and an alderman of the city afterward. Naval career Not long after passing the lieutenant's examination, Lieutenant Buckner participated in the 1756 Battle of Minorca as a 4th lieutenant on and gave an account of the battle in his testimony at the subsequent court martial of Admiral John Byng. Buckner became commanding officer of the third-rate HMS Prothee in 1780. During the American Revolutionary War, he captured the American privateer frigates Scourge and Rhodes in February 1782 and then saw action at the Battle of the Saintes in April 1782. He went on to be commanding officer of the third-rate later in 1782 and commanding officer of the royal yacht in 1787. He became Commander-in-Chief, The Nore in April 1795 and was in command during the Spithead and Nore mutinies in 1797. The first round of negotiations, led by Buckner for the Navy, failed dismally with Buckner being threatened with a broadside attack from the third-rate which was being held by the mutineers. The mutiny ultimately failed and the ring leaders were hanged. Under the seniority-based promotion system of the Royal Navy then in effect, Buckner was eventually promoted to Admiral of the Red in 1808, the second highest-ranking officer in the Navy at the time.

A native of Transylvania, he graduated from Budapest University, after which he was ordained. He was initially assigned to a parish in the Apuseni Mountains, which form the backdrop to much of his fiction. Before 1910, Ag√¢rbiceanu had achieved literary fame in both Transylvania and the Kingdom of Romania; his work was disputed between the rival schools of SƒÉmƒÉnƒÉtorul and Poporanism. Committed to social and cultural activism in Transylvania, Ag√¢rbiceanu spent the 1910s officiating near Sibiu, with a break during World War I that eventually took him deep into Ukraine. In 1919, he moved to Cluj, where he lived for most of the remainder of his life. After the war, he involved himself in both the political and cultural life of Greater Romania. He was voted into the Romanian Academy and assumed the office of Senate vice president under the National Renaissance Front dictatorship. Ag√¢rbiceanu spent his last decade and a half under a communist regime that outlawed his church, an act in which he refused to cooperate. Much of his work, with its transparent Christian moralizing, proved incompatible with the new ideology, and was banned by communist censors; however, the regime found him useful for its image, and bestowed honors upon him. Ag√¢rbiceanu's full contribution has been made available since the 1990s, but he endures as a largely forgotten author, with the possible exception of his Apuseni-based novella, Fefeleaga.

Literary historians describe this as the period of his literary debut, which was a collaboration with Unirea newspaper. There, Ag√¢rbiceanu published a feuilleton (signed as Alfius), poetry, and, in 1900, the short story √én postul Pa»ôtelui (\\"At Lent\\").

He became a regular contributor to the Bucharest nationalist review SƒÉmƒÉnƒÉtorul, which gave De la »õarƒÉ a sonorous welcome,Lovinescu, p. 188 and later to SƒÉmƒÉnƒÉtoruls leftist rival, Via»õa Rom√¢neascƒÉ.Nicolaescu, pp. 78, 130 From 1909, he was also one of the regulars at Neamul Rom√¢nesc.Iorga, p. 209 For his literary activity, he was elected a corresponding member of Astra in 1912, and was promoted to full membership in 1925.\\"Ag√¢rbiceanu, Ion\\", entry in Mircea PƒÉcurariu, Dic»õionarul Teologilor Rom√¢ni, Editura Univers Enciclopedic, Bucharest, 1996 From 1910 to 1919, he was parish priest at Orlat in Sibiu County. Ag√¢rbiceanu was also a member of Austria-Hungary's Romanian National Party (PNR), and supported PNR youth leader Octavian Goga, his colleague at LuceafƒÉrul and Tribuna. In 1910, he followed Goga as he parted from the PNR and launched his own independent faction.Netea, p. 66 By the time World War I broke out, Ag√¢rbiceanu had three sons and a daughter, including Ion, the future physicist. Anca Aldea, \\"Ion I. Ag√¢rbiceanu\\" , in Jurnalul Na»õional, May 24, 2008 During 1914, the first year of war, he finally published Arhanghelii, as well as the stories in De la sate (\\"From the Villages\\"). These were followed, in 1916, by a work of Christian theology, Din via»õa preo»õeascƒÉ (\\"From Priestly Life\\").Neme»ô-VintilƒÉ, p. 5 In September 1916, when the Romanian Army withdrew from the Orlat area during the Battle of Transylvania, he fled Austria-Hungary with his family. Their first destination was R√¢mnicu V√¢lcea in the Old Kingdom; they then headed for Roman in Western Moldavia. Evacuated to Russia in August 1917, they reached the vicinity of Yelisavetgrad in Ukraine. While there and alongside other refugee Transylvanians, he took part in a choir organized by Nicolae Colan, a future bishop in the Romanian Orthodox Church.Mircea PƒÉcurariu, CƒÉrturari sibieni de altƒÉdatƒÉ, in Colec»õia Universitaria: Seria Historica, 24. Editura Dacia, 2002, , p. 542 In November of that year, Ag√¢rbiceanu and his family found shelter with a Transylvanian family in Borogani village, near Leova in Bessarabia. The October Revolution soon broke out, and they made their way back to Moldavia, where he became a military chaplain for the H√¢rlƒÉu-based Romanian Volunteer Corps in Russia. He returned to Orlat in December 1918. In March 1919, following the union of Transylvania with Romania, he was named director of Patria newspaper, which was edited by the province's Directing Council. In October 1919, the newspaper's headquarters moved to Cluj, and Ag√¢rbiceanu followed. Thanks to his literary activity, he was part of the leadership of the Romanian Writers' Society, and was elected corresponding member of the Romanian Academy in 1919.Neme»ô-VintilƒÉ, pp. 4‚Äì5 He also began contributing to the reviews G√¢ndirea of Cluj, and FlacƒÉra and Cuget Rom√¢nesc of Bucharest.Iorga, pp. 261, 263, 266 In 1922, he accompanied other Writers' Society members on a celebratory tour of Transylvania.Eftimiu, p. 399 Like several of his colleagues, Ag√¢rbiceanu preserved a bitter memory of the war, and his articles of the time make a point of referring to the Hungarians as a \\"barbarian horde\\".John Neubauer, Marcel Cornis-Pope, Dagmar Roberts, Guido Snel, \\"1918.

A member of the PNR Executive Committee in 1919, Ag√¢rbiceanu presented himself for the elections of November‚Äîthe first ones following the creation of Greater Romania. He took a seat the Assembly of Deputies for in T√¢rnava-Mare County.\\"AnexƒÉ.

Initially joining the National Peasants' Party into which the PNR merged in 1926, the following year he defected to Alexandru Averescu's People's Party, of which Goga was also a member. Gheorghe I. Florescu, \\"Alexandru Averescu, omul politic (V)\\", in Convorbiri Literare, September 2009 From 1927 to 1928, Ag√¢rbiceanu, a recipient of the National Prize for Literature,Netea, p. 247 headed the Cluj chapter of Astra and edited Transilvania. It was in this magazine that he wrote a number of articles in support of eugenics, calling on priests to promote the movement in their parishes. Given the secular values of the movement's leaders in Romania, his participation was somewhat incongruous, but Ag√¢rbiceanu did not see a conflict between his religious creed and a current centered around supposedly objective natural laws.Maria Bucur, Eugenics and Modernization in Interwar Romania. University of Pittsburgh Press, Pittsburgh, 2002, , pp. 133, 250 From 1930, he participated in Astra's literary section and headed its cultural congress, in which capacity he lectured on the organization's role in Romanian cultural life. Additionally, he played a prominent role during its annual congressesNetea, p. 42 and committed himself to social activism. He was involved in Astra's literacy campaigns, inspecting and fundraising for village libraries in places such as Ale»ôd. Florin Costinescu, \\"Ion Ag√¢rbiceanu, √Æn documente de arhivƒÉ\\", in LuceafƒÉrul, nr.12/2014  Maturity  Also in 1930, Ag√¢rbiceanu was elevated to the rank of archpriest for the Cluj district, and in 1931, he became canon for the Cluj-Gherla Diocese. In 1932, following schisms in the People's Party, he followed Goga into the new National Agrarian Party.Gheorghe I. Florescu, \\"Alexandru Averescu, omul politic (VII)\\" , in Convorbiri Literare, November 2009; Netea, p. 88 In so doing, he lost control over Patria to Astra's Ion Clopo»õel.Netea, pp. 88‚Äì89 After 1934, he was one of the noted contributors to the official literary magazine, Revista Funda»õiilor Regale, put out in Bucharest by Paul Zarifopol.CrohmƒÉlniceanu, p. 171 In late 1938, following the establishment of the National Renaissance Front (FRN), King Carol II appointed him to the Senate, of which he also served as vice president.Boia, p. 135; Gheorghe Lazarovici, Cluj-Napoca: inima Transilvaniei. Editura Studia, Cluj-Napoca, 1997, , p. 132 From 1938 to 1940, he edited a new edition of Tribuna in Cluj, as both the FRN's official paper and Transylvania's only daily.Netea, p. 95 Toward the end of the 1930s, he wrote in opposition to the revisionist policy of the Kingdom of Hungary, and in August 1940, after the Second Vienna Award granted Northern Transylvania to Hungary, he fled Cluj for Sibiu. The new authorities called for his expulsion, but he received the order after he had departed Cluj. With the downfall of the National Renaissance Front, Ag√¢rbiceanu withdrew from politics. However, in 1941, he supported Romania's war on the Eastern Front, including the occupation of Transnistria. In an official magazine that was itself named Transnistria, Ag√¢rbiceanu suggested that God had \\"even greater plans with us\\".Boia, p. 213 Ag√¢rbiceanu continued to write and publish literature throughout the Carol regime and much of World War II: Sectarii (\\"The Schismatics\\", 1938), Licean... odinioarƒÉ (\\"Once upon a Time... a Pupil\\", 1939), Amintirile (\\"The Recollections\\", 1940), Domni»ôoara Ana (\\"Miss Ana\\", 1942), alongside more theological and moralizing essays such as Din pildele Domnului (\\"The Lord's Parables\\", 1939), Medita»õii. Fa»õa de luminƒÉ a cre»ôtinismului (\\"Meditions. On the Luminous Visage of Christianity\\", 1941), Preotul »ôi familia preo»õeascƒÉ. Rostul lor etnic √Æn satul rom√¢nesc (\\"The Priest and the Priestly Family. Their Ethnic Role within the Romanian Village\\", 1942). The novel V√¢ltoarea (\\"The Whirlpool\\") was serialized by Convorbiri Literare and came out as a volume in 1944; another novel, Vremuri »ôi oameni (\\"Times and People\\"), being critical of Nazism, was not given imprimatur by the Ion Antonescu regime. Cornelia »òtefƒÉnescu, \\"Ineditele Ag√¢rbiceanu\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, nr.48/2003 Many more works, including Sf√¢ntul (\\"The Saint\\"), were completed but also remained unpublished. Zigu Ornea, \\"LiteraturƒÉ »ôi moralƒÉ\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, nr.26/1999  Under communism  Following the fall of Antonescu's regime and the campaign to recover Northern Transylvania, Ag√¢rbiceanu became a contributor to a new political weekly, Ardealul.Netea, p. 139 He remained in Sibiu until 1945 and then returned to Cluj.Vatamaniuc, p. 19 He also contributed, in 1947, a religious tract on Familia cre»ôtinƒÉ (\\"The Christian Family\\"). In 1948, when the new communist regime outlawed the Greek- Catholic Church and forcibly merged it into the Orthodox Church, Ag√¢rbiceanu refused to join the latter denomination, thus setting himself up against the authorities. However, these found his reputation as a writer valuable for their own interests, and preferred to try and co-opt him.Cristian Vasile, Politicile culturale comuniste in timpul regimului Gheorghiu-Dej. Humanitas, Bucharest, 2013, , pp. 81‚Äì82 In 1953, after a five-year marginalization for his refusal to turn Orthodox, Ag√¢rbiceanu joined the editorial board of Anatol E. Baconsky's semi-official literary magazine, Steaua. He was granted the Order of Labor the following year, and promoted to titular member of the Academy in 1955. Membrii Academiei Rom√¢ne din 1866 p√¢nƒÉ √Æn prezent at the Romanian Academy site On the occasion of his 80th birthday in 1962, he was also awarded the Order of the Star of the Romanian People's Republic, first class. Ag√¢rbiceanu's old and new writings came out in several editions: Pagini alese (\\"Selected Works\\", 1956), Din mun»õi »ôi din c√¢mpii (\\"From Mountains and Plains\\", 1957), Din copilƒÉrie (\\"Childhood Memories\\", 1957), File din cartea naturii (\\"Pages from the Book of Nature\\", 1959), Povestind copiilor (\\"Stories for Children\\", 1961) and Faraonii (\\"The Pharaohs\\", 1961). Although formally congratulated by the regime, Ag√¢rbiceanu fell out with its censorship apparatus. According to various accounts, he allowed the censors to operate multiple changes, as long as the substance of his writing was not itself altered. Portions of his work were cut out during reediting, and a novel, PrƒÉbu»ôirea (\\"The Downfall\\"), serialized in Gazeta LiterarƒÉ, was so crudely handled that seven of its pages were lost forever. Expecting to die soon, Ag√¢rbiceanu worked on a definitive corpus of his writings, which began printing at the state-run Editura pentru LiteraturƒÉ under the care of G. Pienescu and Mihai »òora. When he was led to believe that many of his works would not be allowed for publishing, he retook possession of all the manuscripts he had sent in, including some previously unpublished writings. The volumes were already available by that time. The writer died in Cluj in 1963, and was buried in the city's Hajongard Cemetery in a grave topped by a white marble cross.J√≥zsef Luk√°cs, Levente V√°rdai, Povestea \\"ora»ôului-comoarƒÉ\\". Biblioteca Apostrof, Cluj-Napoca, 2005, , p. 121  Literary contribution   Ideology and style  View of the Apuseni Mountains from Bucium, site of formative experiences for Ag√¢rbiceanu Ag√¢rbiceanu entered literary life as a poet‚Äîaccording to his SƒÉmƒÉnƒÉtorul patron, Nicolae Iorga, he was great as the author of ballades. Later in his career, he focused on vignettes (often prose poems),Iorga, p. 297 short stories and novels, intended to represent daily life in the Apuseni Mountains. His favorite theme was the life of a Transylvanian country priest at the turn of the 20th century, RƒÉzvan Voncu, \\"Ag√¢rbiceanu (aproape) necunoscut\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, nr.1/2011 but his \\"gallery\\" of protagonists also included shepherds, foresters, rafters, thieves, teachers, village doctors, Romani metalworkers, and the rich industrialists (\\"Transylvanian nawabs\\").Iorga, pp. 119, 175, 178 A prolific writer, possibly the most productive one in Romania before 1930,»òƒÉineanu, p. 141 he completed some 65 volumes, by his own account, both long and short. Ideologically, Ag√¢rbiceanu was most closely aligned with SƒÉmƒÉnƒÉtoruls ethnic traditionalism, and was always a marginal among the Via»õa Rom√¢neascƒÉ Poporanists, who were rather more inspired by Marxism.Nicolescu, p. 130 However, Voncu believes, the similarities were only superficial: unlike the SƒÉmƒÉnƒÉtorul school, Ag√¢rbiceanu was a professional of literary realism, who favored individual psychology over class identity, and would not condemn the city as a decomposed and decomposing environment. RƒÉzvan Voncu, \\"Realismul aspru al lui Ag√¢rbiceanu\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, nr.4/2015 His stories, Voncu notes, had an \\"ethical, even philosophical, vision\\", and \\"the dignity of grand literature.\\" His naturalness was even highlighted by Iorga, who praised Ag√¢rbiceanu as \\"the liveliest storyteller\\" of the early 20th century: \\"he doesn't go looking for the folkish ingredient; he just cannot separate himself from it, because he lives therein, heart and soul.\\"Iorga, p. 178 According to Eugen Lovinescu, the modernist literary critic and cultural theorist, Ag√¢rbiceanu is the \\"essential exponent\\" of Transylvanian SƒÉmƒÉnƒÉtorists. His literature is one that \\"by the people and for the people\\". As Lovinescu puts it, his work blends an \\"aggressive affirmation of nationhood\\" and \\"healthy ethics pushed to the limit of tendentiousness and didacticism\\" with a cultivation of dialectal speech patterns.Lovinescu, pp. 187‚Äì188 In this immediate context, Ag√¢rbiceanu seems to have been inspired by Ion Pop ReteganulDragomirescu, p. 84 and Ioan Slavici,Eftimiu, pp. 180, 475, 476; Iorga, p. 178 the founders of Transylvanian realism. He himself inspired Liviu Rebreanu.CrohmƒÉlniceanu, p. 255; Dragomirescu, p. 88; Lovinescu, p. 188 Traditionally, reviewers have been put off by Ag√¢rbiceanu's plot devices and epic mannerisms, and in particular by his explanatory comments and notes, which they deem superfluous and distracting.CrohmƒÉlniceanu, p. 520; »òƒÉineanu, p. 136. See also Iorga, pp. 180, 183 As Lovinescu notes, Ag√¢rbiceanu and other Transylvanian realists will \\"accumulate in details\\", but will remain \\"incapable of narrating on more than one level\\": \\"for all their dynamism, his sketches are not exciting in the dramatic sense.\\" The moralizing aspect of Ag√¢rbiceanu's fiction makes it hard to separate between it and his purely theological productions: as Lovinescu notes, whenever Ag√¢rbiceanu depicts village drunks, it is as if \\"for an anti-saloon exhibition.\\"Lovinescu, p. 189 Dragomirescu argues that Ag√¢rbiceanu's work amounts to a set of humanitarian \\"directives\\", although, he concludes, its depiction of \\"the bleak and mystical recess of life\\" is a fine literary contribution, \\"rising above\\" his generation's.Dragomirescu, pp. 84, 87, 89, 168 He states: \\"Ag√¢rbiceanu is a socializing Poporanist or SƒÉmƒÉnƒÉtorist only when he is at his weakest\\".Dragomirescu, p. 89 According to exegetes such as Iorga,Iorga, pp. 178‚Äì180 Constantin »òƒÉineanu»òƒÉineanu, p. 125 and Voncu, the moral lesson of Ag√¢rbiceanu's lay works is only hinted at, with much subtlety. Voncu sees in Luncu»ôoara din PƒÉresemi the \\"refinement and objectivity\\" of novels by Georges Bernanos. On the other hand, Voncu observes that the writer uses his artistic talents in theological works such as Despre minuni (\\"About Miracles\\") and Din pildele Domnului, ably narrating simple texts that can appeal either to their intended audience of rural believers or to a more cultivated set of readers. As Z. Ornea notes, Ag√¢rbiceanu's least known works are particularly moralizing. This category includes two stories of moral redemption, the novel Sf√¢ntul and the short novella Pustnicul Pafnutie »ôi ucenicul sƒÉu Ilarion (\\"Pafnutie the Hermit and Ilarion His Apprentice\\"), which are \\"entirely tactless\\".  Major works  In Arhanghelii, the implicit Christian lesson is about the love of money and its devastation of an Apuseni get-rich mining community. At the heart of the novel is a former notary, Rodean, whose gold claim appears to be endlessly productive and corrupting. As »òƒÉineanu writes: \\"with emotion and mounting interest, we witness here the ephemeral joys and disasters that this modern-day Moloch pours over this once-peaceful village.\\"»òƒÉineanu, p. 126 The novel, Lovinescu argues, is overall \\"awkward\\", but still interesting as a social fresco, called a \\"frightening human torment\\" by Iorga. »òƒÉineanu deplores its \\"prolixity\\" and arcane mining terminology.»òƒÉineanu, pp. 125, 127‚Äì128 As argued by Dragomirescu, the climax, where Rodean runs from the card table to see his mine collapsing, \\"has remarkable qualities of literary vividness and vigor.\\"Dragomirescu, p. 83 Nicolae Manolescu offers praise to the work, a \\"solidly realistic novel\\" that, although widely seen as a pastiche from Slavici, should still be taken into account for its \\"originality and newness\\". He sees Ag√¢rbiceanu as an \\"unlucky\\" novelist, whose work was eclipsed by that of Rebreanu, Mihail Sadoveanu, and Gala Galaction, which it only resembles coincidentally. Nicolae Manolescu, \\"Ion Ag√¢rbiceanu, 50 de ani de la moarte\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, nr.50/2013 In Legea trupului, a psychological novel about a young man torn between the love for a mature woman and her daughter, Ag√¢rbiceanu turned his attention to the sins of the flesh. The erotic dilemma is one of several narrative threads: Legea trupului is also a story of inter-ethnic conflict (Romanians versus Hungarians), and a probe into the regional politics in TransylvaniaLovinescu, pp. 189‚Äì190 (a theme that also preoccupied him when writing √én clasa cultƒÉ). Lovinescu sees Legea trupului as a \\"solid social and psychological study, for all its tendentiousness\\", but still harmed by Ag√¢rbiceanu's \\"lack of stylistic expressiveness and verbal insufficiency.\\"Lovinescu, p. 190 The narrative structure is alluded to in Legea min»õii, which is about discovering one's true calling. The plot follows its protagonist, a scholarly priest by the name of Andrei Pascu, as he finds himself in his work as a missionary of religion and cultural nationalism, despite being set back by poverty and revisited by his worldly past.»òƒÉineanu, pp. 132‚Äì136 Similar themes are developed elsewhere. In Popa Man, a lapsed priest and smuggler is suddenly confronted with the consequences of his actions, and destroys himself with drink.Iorga, p. 180 In Stana, named after its female protagonist, a war invalid is a passive witness to his wife's moral decay. When he dies, his wooden leg serves as a haunting reminder of his virtues, driving Stana to despair.»òƒÉineanu, pp. 142‚Äì144 Ag√¢rbiceanu's statue in Cluj According to Manolescu, these stories were largely outdated by the time of their publishing, when more experimental work was being put out by Hortensia Papadat-Bengescu and Camil Petrescu; Ag√¢rbiceanu \\"could only strike the figure of a naive moralist, reeking of a parson's mindset, in all ways incompatible with the emancipated Romanian society of the interwar.\\" The novella Fefeleaga, however, is largely seen as Ag√¢rbiceanu's true masterpiece‚Äîeither his best story or one of two, alongside the short story Lumini»õa.Dragomirescu, pp. 84, 87; Lovinescu, p. 189 At the center of the story is a woman who makes a meager living quarrying stones for gold panning, with her many children killed off by a respiratory disease. She was based on a real-life Mo»õ, Sofia Danciu, with only some details changed. In the defining moment of the narrative, seen by Dragomirescu as symbolic for the plight of Romanian Transylvanians,Dragomirescu, p. 88 Fefeleaga sells off her emaciated draft horse and only friend, to prepare for her daughter's funeral. However, as Iorga notes, this is not a pessimistic outcome: \\"kindness is present, but hidden, in this world, but will reveal itself in the hours of pity and those of justice\\". Lumini»õa shows the final moments in a woman's life, and her inability to grant herself one last wish, and, according to Dragomirescu, is a \\"universal\\" work, worthy of a Count Tolstoy.  Legacy  Ag√¢rbiceanu with Mircea Zaciu, 1962 Under communism, Ag√¢rbiceanu's lay work began to be fully recovered in the late 1960s. An important effort in this process was undertaken by literary historian Mircea Zaciu, who had begun a critical re-evaluation as early as 1955, with a short monograph that took up George CƒÉlinescu's observation whereby Ag√¢rbiceanu was not a moralizer but an artistic narrator of moral situations. Zaciu went further, seeking to detach the SƒÉmƒÉnƒÉtorist label and place him within the framework of ethical Transylvanian prose. His work, re-edited and amplified in 1964 and 1972, revived interest in the writer by precisely cataloguing his corpus and opening new directions for its critical analysis.Al. SƒÉndulescu, Nicolae Mecu, \\"Biografii, monografii, studii literare\\", in Istoriografia literarƒÉ rom√¢neascƒÉ, 1944-1984, p. 88. Editura Minerva, Bucharest, 1984 The recovery was limited: according to Voncu, the arrival of national communism left critics unsure about whether to reintroduce Ag√¢rbiceanu's \\"uncompromising vision of rural life\\" into the literary canon. Not long thereafter, the film- directing team of Dan Pi»õa and Mircea Veroiu found that Ag√¢rbiceanu's short stories supplied ideal material for their interest in formal experimentation, leading to two films, each based on a pair of his stories: Nunta de piatrƒÉ (1972) and Duhul aurului (1974).Dina Iordanova, The Cinema of the Balkans. Wallflower Press, London, 2006, , pp. 129, 134 In 1988, Nicolae MƒÉrgineanu and Ion Brad also filmed their version of Arhanghelii, as Flames over Treasures. CƒÉlin StƒÉnculescu, \\"Ultimii ani de cinematografie socialistƒÉ (1986‚Äì1990)\\", in Via·π≠a Rom√¢neascƒÉ, nr.5-6/2012 It was not until 2004, fifteen years after the fall of the regime, that the theological writings started being reprinted. These events also signified that the full corpus of his literature could see print: work on his complete writings was taken up by Mariana and Victor Iova. PrƒÉbu»ôirea and other manuscripts only saw print in and after 1997. The project ended in 2002 and, Voncu notes, Ag√¢rbiceanu returned to a \\"discouraging anonymity\\" until 2014, when Ilie Rad began work on a revised critical edition. This also included material never published in the Pienescu edition‚Äîadding as much as 75% new content. As suggested by Manolescu in 2013, Ag√¢rbiceanu once seemed \\"the most promising Transylvanian writer of the dawn of a new century, after Co»ôbuc and before Rebreanu.\\" However, and despite Fefeleaga being a constant feature of literature textbooks, Ag√¢rbiceanu became \\"two-thirds forgotten\\". According to Ornea, and to various others, Ag√¢rbiceanu mostly endures in cultural memory as a \\"second-shelf writer\\". Ion I. Ag√¢rbiceanu (1907‚Äì1971) was the author of pioneering work in spectroscopy, famed for his invention of a gas laser.

He died November 15, 2017, aged 89.http://www.27east.com/news/article.cfm/General-Interest- Southampton/540993/Paul-Kenneth-Komoski-Of-Southampton-Dies-November-15. Komoski served as head of the Center for Programmed Instruction and the Educational Products Information Exchange Institute. In 1964, Life Magazine named him to their list of Young Leaders of the Big Breakthrough. The magazine noted that he \\"was among the first to explore the new field of education by teaching-machines, such as keyboard devices, microfilm, and computers\\". Several years later, Komoski coined the term \\"learner verification and revision\\" for formative evaluation and modification of instructional materials (aka field testing with learners). His work in educational technology led the International Society for Performance Improvement to award him their Honorary Lifetime Member Award in 1979. Early life and education Komoski was born in the Heights section of Jersey City, New Jersey in 1928. He graduated from Morristown School (now Morristown-Beard School) in Morristown, New Jersey in 1947. Komoski then completed a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in history and philosophy at Acadia University in Wolfville, Nova Scotia, Canada. Komoski also studied at the Union Theological Seminary affiliated with Columbia University in Manhattan. After graduating from Acadia University, Komoski returned to Morristown School to work as a teacher. He then taught social studies at the Collegiate School in New York City and served as head of its middle school. Komoski later served as the director of the Automated Teaching Project at the Collegiate School. Begun during the late 1950s, this project led efforts to test programmed instruction in both elementary schools and secondary schools. Faculty members programmed machines that asked students' questions and then presented them within immediate answers to facilitate learning. While working at the Collegiate School, Komoski participated as one of 27 invited educators at the 1960 Designs For Learning national conference in Sarasota, Florida. Run by the Ford Foundation's Educational Facilities Laboratories, the conference discussed school designs to meet changing educational needs. Career in educational development and technology In 1961, Komoski began working as president of the Center for Programmed Instruction (CPI). Started as an independent nonprofit organization, the center affiliated with the Institute for Educational Technology at Columbia's Teachers College. Funded by the Carnegie Corporation of New York, CPI supported the development of programmed instruction as a practice. Komoski later served as associate executive director of the Institute for Educational Technology and adjunct associate professor of education at Columbia. While at Columbia, Komoski authored the first publication to document that many educational materials did not undergo field testing. Developers did not revise the materials with feedback from real learners. During the 1960s, Komoski consulted on educational technology for UNESCO (the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization). He taught workshops on programmed instruction in Ramallah, Jordan (now a Palestinian city in the West Bank) and Ibadan, Nigeria. Komoski later consulted for the U.S. Department of State and President Lyndon B. Johnson's Commission on Instructional Technology. In 1970, Komoski authored the report \\"Toward the Development of Effective Instructional Technology for American Education\\". This work served as a supporting paper for the 1970 Commission's final report to the President and Congress. In 1983, Komoski began hosting the half-hour TV show Educational Computing on PBS. Funded by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the show discussed how computers support learning in classrooms and at home. Educational Computing featured news stories, interviews, and demonstrations of recommended educational software. Episodes also discussed computer networking and the digital divide separating poor school districts from districts with more resources. EPIE Institute In 1967, Komoski authored Development of a System for An Educational Products Information Exchange. This report discussed a long-term federally funded study on the development of an exchange to evaluate educational products. The findings led Komoski to co-found the Educational Products Information Exchange Institute (EPIE Institute) and serve as its executive director. The EPIE Institute developed model practices for whole curriculum approaches to align curriculum with learning goals and evaluate learning resources. It also reviewed and evaluated teaching aids and educational technology. In 1982, the EPIE Institute began a partnership with the Consumers Union, the producer of Consumer Reports. The two organizations jointly produced the Pro/Files series of reports to evaluate computers, software, and accessory equipment. Funding from the Richard Lounsbery Foundation and the Ford Foundation supported the project. During the mid-1990s, the EPIE Institute helped to found the Learning and Information Networking for Community Through Technology (LINCT) Coalition. The Institute then served as LINCT's managing partner organization working with law professor Edgar S. Cahn (the creator of time banking) and researcher Curtiss Priest. LINCT operated as a nonprofit coalition of socially-concerned organizations working with businesses, schools, libraries, governments, and social service agencies. In 1996, the EPIE Institute published Creating Learning Communities: Practical, Universal Networking for Learning in Schools and Homes. Co-authored by Komoski and Priest, the report presented the findings of a two-year research study on the development of intentional educational networks. The MacArthur Foundation funded this work to support collaborations among schools and their communities. Work to address the digital divide In 1983, Komoski launched the Excellence and Equity in Electronic Education (4E) project at the EPIE Institute. Funded by a San Francisco Foundation grant, 4E taught schools how to train parents on the use of computers to support home learning. The project also sought to help low- income families attain computers for use at home. During the mid to late 1980s and early 1990s, Komoski consulted for networking projects in Battle Creek, Michigan and Indian River County, Florida that connected schools and local communities. The work led him to publish \\"The 81% Solution\\" in Education Week, which discussed challenges in addressing learning needs through technology. The article noted that children spend most of their time (81 percent) at home and only 19 percent of their time at school. Komoski proposed the use of community networks to help meet the learning needs of children, particularly at-risk youth from poorer communities. He also suggested ways in which children and families could earn computers donated from businesses while developing their skills. The ideas proposed in the \\"81 Percent Solution\\" later facilitated the work of LINCT to create solutions to address the digital divide. During the mid- and late 1990s, LINCT developed Learn and Earn programs for children and their families, low-wage workers, and unemployed persons. Participants in the programs learned skills in areas such as word processing, spreadsheet use, and use of the Internet and World Wide Web. After completing the Learn and Earn programs, they could bring home a computer for use at home. LINCT piloted Learn and Earn in the New York City metropolitan area in partnership with the Urban League and other community organizations. The success of this program influenced the development of similar programs in Los Angeles, Denver, and Phoenix. These programs later scaled down during the early and mid 2000s because of government funding cuts. In 2012, Komoski started EPIE's Digital Age Family Literacy Program (DAFLP) at Southampton Intermediate School in Southampton, New York. DAFLP runs a 12-week computing course for families of non-native English-speakers on Long Island. Participants earn home use of their laptop computer after completing the program. Federal conferences In 1970, Komoski chaired the Forum on Educational Technology at the White House Conference on Children in Washington, D.C. Led by Stephen H. Hess, the conference discussed the needs of children aged birth to 13. The discussions in the Educational Technology Forum led to recommendations to incorporate educational technology in all federal education programs and Congressional legislation. Recommendations also suggested ways to strengthen individualized learning and incorporate educational technology into the proposed U.S. National Institute of Education. Komoski consulted for the study on the development of the Institute funded by the Rand Corporation. In 1976, Komoski presented at the Educating All Handicapped Children Conference (EAHCC) in Annapolis, Maryland at the invitation of Elwood L. Bland. Bland headed the Learning Resource Division of the Bureau of Education of the Handicapped (now the Office of Special Education Programs.) The EAHCC conference discussed implications for the use of educational technology to support implementation of the Education for All Handicapped Children Act. (Passed in 1975, the act changed to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act in 1990.) Komoski's presentation discussed the evaluation of instructional materials to improve classroom instruction for students with disabilities. Two years later, Komoski presented on \\"Publishers Responsibilities in Meeting the Continuing Challenge of Literacy\\" at the National Right to Read Conference. Run by the Institute for Advanced Study under contract with the U.S. Office of Education, the conference had a theme of Literacy: Meeting the Challenge. The conference organizers later published Komoski's presentation in an eight-part series of proceedings. Congressional testimony In 1971, Komoski testified before the Select Committee on Education of the House Committee on Education and Labor (now the Committee on Education and the Workforce). The Congressional hearing discussed legislation to establish the U.S. National Institute of Education in the Office of Education of the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. (Federal educational agencies now stand alone as the U.S. Department of Education). In 1992, Komoski testified again before the House Subcommittee on Education. This hearing discussed legislation to reauthorize the Office of Educational Research and Improvement in the U.S. Department of Education. Jazz and tennis Komoski worked as a jazz singer-songwriter and as a tennis pro. He also served as vice president of the United States National Lawn Tennis Association (now the United States Tennis Association). References External links *Kenneth P.

History  The William Penn Association dates its origin to February 21, 1886, when thirteen Hungarian American miners formed the Verhovay Aid Association in Hazleton, Pennsylvania. The Verhovay Aid Association was chartered in December of that year by the State.

It also houses a five-inch solar telescope and an eight-inch refracting telescope. The 32-inch telescope is tied with the Austin-Fellows telescope of the Stull Observatory at Alfred University for being the 2nd-largest optical telescope in the state of New York, the largest being the 40-inch reflector at SUNY Oneonta College Observatory. On its exterior the observatory is covered in aluminum sheathing, making the structure less of a heat polluter than its predecessor whose masonry walls absorbed a lot of daytime solar heat.

Zerby was shot by two Long Beach Police Department officers while playing with a garden hose nozzle. They claimed that they mistook the hose nozzle for a gun and fired at Zerby, killing him, and did not make any verbal warnings or commands. It was later discovered through audio recordings of the officers radios that a house phone rang startling an officer causing him to shoot. The other officers fired once the first shooter did, blaming it on \\"contagious fire\\" proving the officers were not trained well. Los Angeles County prosecutors cleared the two officers of the shooting. The family of Zerby filed a lawsuit against the city of Long Beach and were awarded $6.5 million after a jury found the Long Beach Police Department to be responsible for Zerby's death, acting with malice and recklessness, and violating Zerby's Fourth Amendment rights. The officers also had to pay $5,000 each to Zerby's family.

The two officers, Jeffrey Shurtleff and Victor Ortiz, had six years and ten years of law enforcement experience, respectively. Shooting At 4:45 pm, LBPD Officers Jeffrey Shurtleff and Victor Ortiz shot Zerby as he was sitting on a step of an apartment complex in the Belmont Shore neighborhood playing with a hose nozzle. He was at the apartment to visit his friend. A neighbor had called police reporting that a man had a \\"six-shooter\\" gun in a backyard and was waving it around. Zerby was drunk with a blood alcohol content of 0.42 percent and was reportedly pointing the nozzle at the officers who arrived at the scene, according to authorities. The two officers claimed to have mistaken the device for a gun and opened fire without warning. The officers fired a shotgun and a handgun, hitting Zerby 12 times. Zerby suffered from four fatal wounds. He was struck in the lower leg and chest areas.CA High Court Mulls Privacy, NBC Los Angeles Ortiz was 38 feet away from Zerby when he fired his shotgun, and Shurtleff was 23 feet away when he fired his handgun. A third officer who was present at the scene of the shooting, was 56 feet away with a telescopic rifle but did not fire. A fourth officer at the scene was armed with an assault rifle and said that he saw Zerby point a firearm in his direction, but not at Ortiz. He was separated from Zerby by a gate, and said in his testimony that he did not fire because he did not want to hit the fence. Immediately before the shooting, officers requested additional helicopters, a police helicopter, and the Long Beach Police Department's Mental Health Evaluation Team to assist in the situation, but claimed that when Zerby stretched his arms and pointed the nozzle at them, they heard a telephone ring and fired.Long Beach Officers Cleared in Water Nozzle Fatal Shooting Case, Los Angeles Times, November 3, 2011. Forensics reports would prove their claims false, once it was discovered that the water nozzle was found under his thigh, a place it could never have ended up if he were extending it outward like a pistol. Legal proceedings Criminal investigation The shooting was investigated by the Long Beach Police Department, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Justice System of Integrity Division, and the Los Angeles County coroner's office. In November 2011, the Los Angeles County district attorney's office declined to file charges against Ortiz and Shurtleff in the shooting, citing that they acted in self-defense. The decision led to protests in Long Beach. According to prosecutors, Zerby's arm positions were consistent with someone pointing an object at officers. Police Chief Jim McDonnell said in a press conference that the officers did not give verbal warnings or commands before shooting Zerby.Wilson, Simone. DA clears police, LA Weekly, November 3, 2011. Civil lawsuit Douglas Zerby's family and their lawyers, Dale Galipo and Bryan Claypool, filed a lawsuit against the city of Long Beach and Victor Ortiz and Jeffrey Shurtleff. They asked for $21.5 million in damages. Roger Clark, a former lieutenant with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, testified that the officers did not need to shoot Zerby and had no reason to not give him an opportunity to drop the nozzle before using deadly force. Clark said that the officers had good cover from brick walls and a fireplace, and that because Zerby had committed no crime, that it would reasonable of the officers to have announced their presence. An attorney for the city argued that Ortiz and Shurtleff opened fire because they believed that Zerby was going to shoot them. An attorney for Zerby's father said that Shurtleff accidentally discharged his handgun and fired one shot, causing Ortiz to believe Zerby fired a shot and then fire his shotgun.Winton, Richard; Vives, Ruben.

Qiupu was described as a beautiful small city by cinematographer Sun Yu, in the early 1980s.Sun, 74 It has existed at least since the Tang dynasty, when it was part of Chizhou Prefecture. The proximity of the Yangzi river has provided convenient transportation by water. In modern times, the subdistrict is one of the smaller political divisions of the People's Republic of China: a form of township-level division, which are typically parts of larger urban areas, opposed to discrete towns surrounded by rural areas, or to rural townships. Caution is indicated when comparing current and past Chinese populated areas: even with the same name, sometimes locations or political status have gone through significant changes. That said, Qiupu has a place in cultural history which may be greater than its current administrative status. As of 2014, Qiupu is part of the Guichi District (population 630,000), which is in turn administered by Chizhou, Anhui province of China. History and culture Lu, during the ancient times of the 5th century BCE, in the south of the Shandong peninsula In ancient history, Qiupu was a part of the Lu feudal kingdom, associated with the relatively modern province of Shandong and the more modern province of Anhui (which was not organized until the 17th century). Both of these areas are partially located on the eastern edge of the North China Plain, and Chinese culture has been part of these areas since remote antiquity. The Shang dynasty and the more westerly-originated Zhou dynasty exerted varying degrees of political control and cultural influence, especially over the western Shandong area; and, also, especially eastern Shandong was influenced by the Dongyi/Laiyi inhabitants. The general area was famous for being the location of the tomb of Emperor Yao; and, the Lu state was famous as the homeland of Confucius (and infamous for the Lu rulers' rejection of his talent and potential services). Besides the Shang refugees, and the Zhou cadet rulership, the area was (probably among others, and for others) a refuge for persons or peoples displaced from the Chu state. The Tang dynasty poet Li Bo visited Qiupu numerous times, in his mid-to-late life. He wrote a series of 17 poems, Qiupu Songs (), and other of his survive which are less-specifically located from within its general area. In these songs, or poems, he described the beautiful natural scenes of hills, woods, and streams; and also the workers in the local metallurgic industry. Some of his sadness from his wandering life-style also comes through, in these poems.Sun, 24 and 74-79 Li Bo's poems also attest to the existence of numerous members of some simian species (probably white gibbons) populating the area at that time. Geography Qiupu is known historically known for its scenic topography. And, also known for having been connected by water transport to the extensive Yangzi riverine system, one of the world's longest, running between western China and the Pacific Ocean, and navigable for much of the distance. Qiupu has also been of a reasonable travel distance from the North China Plain. Eventually, the Sui dynasty (581‚Äì618 CE) construction of the Grand Canal of China greatly impacted north-south land transport which was conducted despite the mountains and hills separating north and south.

Alavida Lifestyles Inc. [2011] 2 S.C.R. 387,Masterpiece Inc. v. Alavida Lifestyles Inc.[2011] 2 S.C.R. 387 is a Supreme Court of Canada decision concerning the relevant criteria and basic approach to be undertaken by the Court in analyzing the likelihood of confusion in Canadian trademark law under the Trade-marks Act, 1985 Trade-marks Act, R.S.C., 1985, c.T-13 The test adopted by the Supreme Court of Canada is whether, as a matter of first impression, the \\"casual consumer somewhat in a hurry\\" who encounters the Alavida trade-mark, with no more than an imperfect recollection of any one of the Masterpiece Inc. trade-marks or trade-name, would be likely to think that Alavida was the same source of retirement residence services as Masterpiece Inc. Furthermore, Rothstein J. affirmed a consumer protection principle of trade-marks as an indication of provenance, \\"providing consumers with a reliable indication of the expected source of wares or services.\\" Masterpiece Inc., para.1 Rothstein J. delivering the majority judgment of the Court held that Alavida's proposed trade-mark \\"Masterpiece Living\\" was confusing with at least one of Masterpiece Inc.‚Äôs trade-marks when the registration application was filed on December 1, 2005. Alavida was therefore deemed to be not entitled to registration of its proposed marks, allowing then for the Registrar of Trade-marks to expunge Alavida‚Äôs registration from the registrar.  Background and Facts  Masterpiece Inc. and Alavida Lifestyles Inc. were both involved in the retirement residence business, with the former operating in Alberta, and the latter in Ontario. Prior to December 2005, Masterpiece Inc. used several trade-marks which included the word \\"Masterpiece\\", as well as its trade-name \\"Masterpiece Inc.\\" Masterpiece Inc. (incorporated in 2001) undertook the construction of retirement residences in Alberta during the relevant period of 2001 to 2005, operating under its corporate name of Masterpiece Inc. as a trade-name. Moreover, Masterpiece Inc. used several unregistered trade-marks, including the \\"Masterpiece the Art of Living,\\" and \\"Masterpiece the Art of Retirement Living.\\"Masterpiece Inc., para.9,10 Alavida Inc. was incorporated on August 4, 2005 and applied to register the trade-mark \\"Masterpiece Living\\" on December 1, 2005, on the basis of proposed use. The mark was registered unopposed on March 23, 2007 and Alavida has used the trade-mark since January 2006. Masterpiece Inc. applied to register \\"Masterpiece\\" as a trade-mark (January 2006) and applied to register the trade-mark \\"Masterpiece Living\\" (June 2006).Masterpiece Inc., para.11 Prior application by Alavida resulted in the denial by the Registrar of both the trade-mark applications submitted by Masterpiece Inc. On March 16, 2007, Masterpiece Inc. applied to expunge Alavida's registration.  The Federal Court and The Federal Court of Appeal  O‚ÄôReilly J. at the Federal Court dismissed Masterpiece Inc.‚Äôs application to expunge the Alavida trade- mark. The trial judge observed that since the choice of retirement residence was an \\"important and expensive decision,\\" consumers could be expected to research their decisions carefully, thereby reducing the likelihood of confusion.Masterpiece Inc., para 17 The trial judge found that Masterpiece Inc. had not satisfied the likelihood of confusion considerations. The Federal Court of Appeal also dismissed Masterpiece Inc.‚Äôs appeal and generally agreed with the trial judge‚Äôs approach to the confusion assessment. In both courts, the relevant date for confusion analysis was the date of filing of Alavida‚Äôs trade-mark application (December 1, 2005).  The Supreme Court of Canada   Issues on Appeal to the Supreme Court  1\\\\. Is the location where a mark is used relevant when considering the likelihood of confusion between an applied for or registered trade-mark and a prior unregistered trade-mark or trade-name? 2\\\\. What considerations are applicable in the assessment of the resemblance between a proposed use trade-mark and an existing unregistered trade-mark? 3\\\\. When considering the \\"nature of the trade\\" under s.6(5)of the Trade-marks Act, what effect does the nature and cost of the wares or services have on the confusion analysis? 4\\\\. When should courts take into account expert evidence in trade-mark or trade-name confusion cases?  Opinion of the Supreme Court of Canada   1. The relevance of the location where a mark is used  The Supreme Court of Canada held that the location where the marks were actually used is not relevant. First, the test for confusion is premised upon the hypothetical assumption that the trade-names and trade-marks are used in the \\"same area\\", pursuant to s.6(3). Moreover, in order to have \\"exclusive use\\" of a registered trade-mark throughout Canada there cannot be a likelihood of confusion with another trade-mark anywhere in the country, regardless of whether the trade-marks are actually used in the \\"same area.\\"Masterpiece Inc., para.30  2. Considerations to be applied by the Court in assessing resemblance  The Court affirmed that it is use, and not the registration of the trade-mark itself that confers priority of title and the exclusive right to the trade-mark. The granting of rights to the first- user manifested under the Trade-Marks Act in two areas pursuant to s.16: i) first use of the trademark furnishes a priority right to registration; ii) the first user right to oppose the application or, as in the present case, apply to expunge registrations based on prior use. Therefore, the remedy of applying to expunge Alavida's registration of the trade-mark was available to Masterpiece Inc.Masterpiece Inc., para.36 In addressing the core question of whether there was confusion between Alavida's and Masterpiece Inc.'s trade- marks in terms of S.6, the Court laid out the general approach to be applied: the casual consumer somewhat in hurry. The Court reiterated this traditional test articulated by Binnie J. in Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin v. Boutiques Clicquot Ltee [2006] 1 S.C.R. 824,:Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin v. Boutiques Clicquot Ltee [2006] 1 S.C.R. 824 \\"the test to be applied is a matter of first impression in the mind of the casual consumer somewhat in a hurry who sees the [mark], at a time when he or she has no more than an imperfect recollection of the [prior] trade-marks.\\"Masterpiece Inc., para.40 Furthermore, the Court affirmed the necessity to consider each mark separately under s.16(3),Trade- marks Act, s.16(3) such that even one confusingly similar trade-mark will invalidate the registration.Masterpiece Inc., para.43 Moreover, the Supreme Court recommended beginning with the final factor in s.6(5) of \\"degree of resemblance\\" when testing for resemblance.Masterpiece Inc., para.49  3. The effect of the nature and cost of the wares and services  The Supreme Court acknowledges that consumers in the market for expensive goods (such as selecting a retirement resident in the present case) may be less likely to be confused upon encountering a trade-mark, however the test is one of \\"first impression.\\"Masterpiece Inc., para.70 The Court found that the trial judge it was an error by the trial judge \\"to discount the likelihood of confusion by considering what actions the consumer might take after encountering a mark in the marketplace.\\"Masterpiece Inc., para.67 As Rothstein J. for the majority Supreme Court judgment states: \\"That cannot mean that consumers of expensive goods, through their own caution and wariness, should lose the benefit of trade-mark protection.\\"Masterpiece Inc., para.72 Rather, the Court affirmed an approach that any subsequent research or consequent purchase, which are instances that occur after the consumer has first encountered the trade-mark in the marketplace, are irrelevant to the determination of confusion under s.6(5) of the Trade-marks Act.Trade-marks Act, s.6(5) The likelihood of confusion analysis under s.6(5) was limited to the consideration of the first impression of the consumer when encountering the trademark: \\"how a consumer, upon encountering the Alavida mark in the marketplace, with an imperfect recollection of the Masterpiece Inc. mark, would have reacted.\\"Masterpiece Inc., para.74  4. Reliance on expert evidence by the Court in the trade- mark confusion analysis  Expert evidence that simply assesses resemblance will not usually be necessary where the \\"casual consumer\\" is not particularly knowledgeable and there is a resemblance between the marks. Judges should resort to expert testimony where it is beyond the scope of the judge's experience and knowledge.Masterpiece Inc., para.80  References   External links  *Masterpiece Inc. v.

While many of the tracks on this album had been previously released on other formats (78 rpm records, 7-inch EPs and singles, and 10- and 12-inch LPs), this is the first album that chronicles the entire session, recorded November 26, 1945, including all takes of all pieces. This session is famous in that it is the first recorded under Parker's name. It is also controversial, in that to this day it is unclear who the pianist and trumpet player are on all of the tracks. Background According to the booklet accompanying Charlie Parker: The Complete Savoy Sessions (which consults \\"documents from the Savoy files and the recollections of Teddy Reig, who produced this session\\") this was to be \\"a standard three hours/four side session [that] was scheduled for November 26, 1945, at the WOR studios in New York for which Parker would supply original compositions. A Union contract was arranged the preceding week and Parker; Miles Davis, trumpet; Thelonious Monk, piano; Curly Russell, bass; and Max Roach, drums were booked for the date. On the 26th Reig went to Parker's apartment to bring Bird to WOR and was informed that Powell had gone with his mother to Philadelphia where she was buying a house. No need to worry, however; Dizzy Gillespie was present and introduced to Reig: 'Here's your piano player'. Parker also had contacted Argonne Thornton (later a.k.a. Sadik Hakim), ... and asked that he appear at the studio.\\" The author of the liner notes of this album‚ÄîJohn Mehegan‚Äîis under the impression that Powell was present, adding to the controversy over piano players. That Powell was absent is agreed by other sources, including the personnel listings of all other issues of these recordings, which list Gillespie and\\\\or and Hakim on various tracks, sometimes contradicting each other. On the earliest releases of tracks from the session‚Äîon 78 rpm records‚Äîthe pianist is listed as \\"Hen Gates\\", a pseudonym known to be used by Dizzy Gillespie. He was listed thus due to his being under contract to the Musicraft label at the time of the recording. The second 78 rpm release of \\"Thriving on a Riff\\" (Savoy 945), though, credits Gillespie on piano; later reissues credit Hakim on this track. Mehegan mentions Hakim in his notes, stating: \\"As a final irony, a pianist by the name of Argonne Thornton claims he played the date or at least part of it, although this is denied by Herman Lubinsky, who conducted the session.\\" This denial, though, may be caused by the fact‚Äîas other sources state‚Äîthat Hakim was not yet a member of the New York local Musicians Union, having moved from Chicago, and was told not to play by a local union representative. Hakim himself claims to have played piano on all tunes except \\"Now's the Time\\" and \\"Billie's Bounce\\". Reig claims that Hakim left before the final \\"Koko\\" take, due to the aforementioned local union rep. \\"Ko-Ko\\" is probably the most controversial track on the album. Many sources state that Gillespie is the trumpet player on this track in place of Davis (including the liner notes of one of Davis' own albums: The Musings of Miles). Various reasons are given: the difficulty of the piece was too much for young Miles, his nerves got the better of him, or simply that he was not present at the time of recording. Other sources insist that it is indeed Miles on this track and attempt to prove it. Some sources additionally state that a) Gillespie played both trumpet and piano on this track or that b) it is impossible for Gillespie to have played both trumpet and piano on this track. One source states that Hakim played piano on the introduction and the coda, allowing Gillespie to play during Parker's solo. It should be pointed out that there is no piano on the master track of Ko-Ko except during Parker's solo, so this is clearly erroneous, but the piano does begin at the beginning of Parker's solo making it unlikely that the trumpet player would have had time to switch instruments. On the aborted take 1 of Ko-Ko, however, the piano can be heard behind the \\"Cherokee\\" melody which both the trumpet and saxophone play. So on take 1, at least, Gillespie cannot have been playing both trumpet and piano. See the various resources for further discussions on this controversy. In the end, this controversial date has been called \\"The Greatest Recording Made in Modern Jazz History.\\" \\"Now's the Time\\" and \\"Thriving From a Riff\\" (also released as \\"Thriving on a Riff\\", later known as \\"Anthropology\\") are jazz classics. Davis, Gillespie and Roach are revered as jazz giants in their own right. Track list Personnel As noted above, the precise personnel of this album remains unknown. For completeness, we list the personnel as presented on the label of the album‚Äîwhich is almost certainly incorrect in that it credits Bud Powell on piano‚Äîas well as the personnel as listed on Charlie Parker: The Complete Savoy Studio Sessions (the only other complete chronicle of this session), which also may be incorrect.

It carries the B4560 road towards Bwlch. The existing stone bridge dates from approximately 1700, and is thought by some to be the oldest bridge on the River Usk. It replaced an earlier bridge that was located 500m further west; the sale deeds of a local smithy, dated 1630, contain the first known reference to that earlier bridge, which itself replaced a wooden bridge shown on a land survey of 1587. Llangynidr Bridge lies in the Hundred (county division) of Crickhowell and is similar in style to the Crickhowell Bridge over the Usk, which dates from 1706. It has six arches, which vary in span from 22 to 30 feet, divided by v-shaped cutwaters topped by pedestrian refuges and parapets with plain coping stones. The cutwaters continue up to the parapet, in order to provide spaces for pedestrians to stand to avoid wheeled traffic crossing the bridge. It is 69m (230 ft) long and the road is 2.4m (8 ft) wide. It is considered a particularly impressive example because of its height - reducing the danger of flooding - and its location, which gives a good view of the architecture. Llangynidr Bridge is known to have been repaired in 1707, and again in 1822. In 1794 a turnpike gate was set up on the Bwlch side of the river, and the right to collect the tolls was auctioned off in 1800. The turnpike cottage is still standing and was purchased from the Beaufort estate in 1915 by the family of one of the earliest toll-keepers. Theophilus Jones, passing through in 1809, noted that the responsibility for repairs lay with the hundred of Crickhowell. Further repairs were carried out in 2015-16. The bridge has been painted over the years by many artists, notably Sir Cedric Morris, whose painting of the bridge has been purchased for Brecknock Museum, Elizabeth Wynter and Gwyn Briwnant Jones.

It won the 2014 Miles Franklin Award and the 2014 Encore Award. Synopsis Alternating chapters tell of Jake's present (in the past tense) and her past (in the present tense). In the present, Jake Whyte lives on a remote Scottish island with her sheep and her dog. Something begins killing - but not eating - one of her sheep every few nights, and she grows increasingly paranoid as she investigates what it could be. One night, she finds a drunk man named Lloyd sleeping in a shed on her property, but allows him to stay when he denies any knowledge of the killings, eventually inviting him into her guest room. Lloyd helps her with the flock, and encourages her to go into town and visit the pub more often, but she is resistant, preferring to be alone. One night during lambing season, she leaves Lloyd with the sheep and goes up to the house for a bath, and comes to believe she has been followed by a wild animal. She trips in the tub and hits her head hard, but Lloyd finds her before she can drown. After a visit from the doctor, she tells Lloyd that she wants to move the entire flock into the house until she can find what is killing them, but he says he won't let her, implying that the monster is imaginary and she is losing her mind. She then points out that the abandoned lamb they had brought inside to bottle feed has gone missing, presumably taken by the monster when it followed her home. A few nights later, Jake believes she sees the monster out the window, and chases after it with her shotgun. In the dark, she accidentally shoots one of her own sheep, and seems to accept that it is all in her head. However, the next day, as she and Lloyd are driving into town, he orders her to stop, claiming he \\"saw it.\\" He gets out of the truck, following something into the woods, and she chases after him. They stop together, watching something in the underbrush, and Lloyd says \\"My God\\" as they hold hands, but what they see is never revealed. In the past, 15-year-old Jake lives in Australia with her parents, older sister, and younger triplet brothers. She has no friends and is frequently bullied. One day, the boy she has a crush on, Denver, offers to walk her home, and begins to do it regularly to protect her from her bullies. She thinks he is flirting with her, but he eventually reveals that he is secretly dating Flora, and the two are planning to run away from her disapproving father. He befriended Jake in the hopes that she would help them. Jake is angry that he would use her, and grows angrier when he says Flora picked her out of pity. Denver threatens to beat Jake if she tells anyone, then leaves her on a path near Flora's house, where she lights a joint and smokes it in the grass. She touches it to a leaf, and the entire field goes up in flames. Jake flees the fire as it spreads, while Denver runs towards it to rescue Flora. Flora dies, and Denver is burned beyond recognition and left in a coma. Much of the town burns down as well, and the townspeople believe Denver to have started the fire to cover his tracks after raping and murdering Flora. Jake visits him in the hospital, believing people in comas can still hear, and tells him that if he survives, she will confess to clear his name. However, she is overheard by a police officer posted at the door. On her way home, a group of locals run her down and hold her to the ground while Flora's father savagely beats her with a stick, leaving permanent scars. After being run out of town, she resorts to prostitution to survive, and eventually agrees to go live with one of her regulars, Otto, thinking it will be safer to service only one client. Otto grows increasingly abusive, locking her in her room at night, refusing to teach her how to drive, and mangling her bicycle so she can't escape. He forces her to slaughter his sheep, getting an erection as he watches. It is implied that he murdered his wife. Jake steals Otto's cash and truck and drives far down the coast, several towns away, where she gets a job at a sheep-shearing station. However, one of the men there discovers missing person posters for her put up by Otto, who claims to be her grandfather, and tries to extort sex out of her. Having recently inherited fifty-thousand dollars after her father's death in a boating accident, she travels to Scotland and buys a farm.

He is the Northrop Grumman Chair in Engineering and Professor of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at the University of Southern California. Early life Govindan obtained a Bachelor of Technology degree from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras and then received master's and Ph.D degrees from the University of California, Berkeley. He then became an associate professor at the University of Southern California, where he researches topology, IP forwarding, and wireless sensor networking. Career Govindan was later named the Northrop Grumman Chair in Engineering and Professor of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering. He is a former editor-in-chief of the journal IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing. He is a Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). In 2000, he along with Kannan Varadhan and Deborah Estrin analyzed a way to prevent oscillations in topologies. During the study he have discovered that an inter-domain routing protocol called hop- by-hop is responsible for the unconstrained route selection and therefore the route get oscillated. However, if \\"safe\\" mode is enabled, it can shorten route selection as well as the number of errors. A year later, he peered up with Deborah Estrin and Deepak Ganesan of UCLA as well as Scott Shenker to develop braided multipath routing scheme which he claimed to be important alternative for energy-saving recovery after lone and patterned failures. On August 14, 2001 he used simulation to evaluate Geographic and Energy Aware Routing protocol and discovered that it lives longer than its non-geographic energy aware routing counterpart. In 2002, he and colleagues from both International Computer Science Institute and UCLA have developed a geographic hash table which was later used along with data-centric storage system. In 2004, while working with researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles he discussed wireless sensor network system which is called Wisden which according to him and his colleagues will use end-to-end and hop-by-hop transport recovery which wouldn't require global clock synchronization to transport data. During the same study they have developed wavelet-based technique that will use limited amount of data bandwidth for low-power wireless radios. In 2006, Govindan and his colleagues have developed a compact version of a pursuit-evasion application called Tenet. In 2010 Govindan, Jeongyeup Paek and Joongheon Kim used smartphones to evaluate remote area power supply. He and his colleagues found that this prototype implementation increased phone lifetimes 3.8 times more than GPS.

Spain was the main power that split Western Sahara between Morocco and Mauritania (1/3 of the land was taken by Mauritania, though none remains under Mauritanian control today). Spain is a major trading partner, taking up 4.1% of Mauritanian exports, and providing about 5.1% of imports. Spanish envoys meeting with the minister of the Interior of Mauritania Ould Beilil in 2011 Spain officially recognised the Mauritanian independence in November 1960, and the first Spanish ambassador presented his credential letter in 1961. The Mauritanian claim over the Western Sahara territory formulated at the United Nations in 1963 mainly obeyed to the logic of blocking Morocco's own claim over the territory, that, if successful, may also propel the Moroccan irredentist claim over Mauritania itself, with the Mauritanian diplomacy fearing over the possibility of a Spanish-Moroccan understanding. The position of Mauritania in regards of the Sahara hardened in the 1970s, demanding a referendum of self-determination and, by 1972, the country had already reconciled with Morocco. In the 1975 Madrid Accords, Spain ceded the administration over the territory to Morocco and Mauritania. During the 1978 OAU summit, Mauritania denied the labeling of the Canary Islands as a territory to be decolonised as well as it denied the recognition of the MPAIAC as a \\"movement of national liberation\\".

Description Nicolas Baudin Island is an island located about west of Cape Blanche on the west coast of Eyre Peninsula in South Australia about south south-west of the town of Streaky Bay.DMH, 1985, charts 39 & 41 The island was described in 2007 as follows: > The island is about in area and is surrounded by reefs on all but the > landward (eastern) side. It is composed of large boulders and slabs of red- > brown granite, as well as sandy areas and intertidal pools. Most of the > island is low and partly inundated each high tide, with several elevated > boulders forming the highest points. Since January 2003, access to both to the island and the waters surrounding it have been prohibited as a regulatory measure to protect a breeding site for the Australian sea lion.DEH, 2006, page 32 Formation, geology and oceanography Nicolas Baudin Island was formed between 6000 and 7700 years ago following the rise of sea levels at the start of the Holocene.Robinson et al, 1996, Pages 11 & 12 The island‚Äôs geology consists of a basement of a granite associated with the Gawler Craton and which is bare of any remnants of overlying layers of rock.Robinson et al, 1996, Page 6 The island‚Äôs north side drops into water of at least a depth of while its west side drops to depth of . The sea bed falls to a depth of about to the west of the island. Flora and fauna Flora As of 2007, Nicolas Baudin Island is reported as not having any terrestrial vegetation. Fauna Surveys of fauna present on Nicolas Baudin Island have focused on vertebrates such as seal lions, seals and birds. Sea lions and seals The island is notable as a rookery for the Australian sea lion and as a haul out for New Zealand fur seals. Birds Surveys of bird life carried out from 2002 to 2005 revealed breeding populations of Pacific gull and sooty oystercatcher as well as sightings of the following species using the island as a roosting point: little penguin, short-tailed shearwater, Australasian gannet, little pied cormorant, black-faced cormorant, pied cormorant, little black cormorant, great cormorant, Australian pelican, white-faced heron, silver gull, caspian tern and crested tern. History European discovery and use Nicolas Baudin Island was not discovered by either of the expeditions led by Matthew Flinders and Nicolas Baudin. It was presumably identified during surveys carried out by the Government of South Australia following settlement in 1836 as ‚Äòa result of the need to document South Australian waters and, in particular, their hazards, and to ascertain the nature of the coast for settlement.‚ÄôRobinson et al, 1996, Page 126 The island was informally known as Cape Blanche Island.

He was the founder of the first Romanian journal of ophthalmology, \\"Revista de Oftalmologie\\" and he published numerous research papers and monographs in foreign ophthalmology journals. and foreign publications'. He was the official ophthalmologist to the Romanian Royal Court from 1931 to 1947 and during World War II secretly helped Queen Helen of Romania rescue Jewish families from concentration camps. Blatt held the positions of University Professor, Chair of the Clinic and Laboratories of the Department of Ophthalmology at the University Hospital of Timi»ôoara, and the position of Chair of Ophthalmology at the \\"Institute for Specialization and Perfecting of Physicians\\" that was part of Carol Davila Medical University in Bucharest. He was a pioneer in research into trachoma, congenital cataracts, modern extracapsular cataract extraction, corneal transplantation and strabismus. During the Cold War the Romanian Workers' Party victimized him because of his past relations, scientific and political views. After the publication of his journal in Bucharest in 1949, he was labeled a \\"traitor and enemy of the glorious Romanian Popular Republic\\". He successfully left Romania in 1964. Shortly before his death he was nominated Guest Professor of Ophthalmology, and given a research laboratory, at the Goethe University Frankfurt in West Germany. Childhood and education Blatt was born into a Jewish Hungarian family in Pintic, in the vicinity of Dej, then part of Austria-Hungary. He was baptized Lutheran. His parents Iacob Blatt (a lawyer) and Bertha Blatt, his older brother, and his two sisters were murdered in Auschwitz during the Holocaust. In 1913 he graduated from the Medical School of Kolozsv√°r (Cluj-Napoca). During World War I, from 1914 to 1918, he was a military physician in the Austro-Hungarian Army. He completed his residency in ophthalmology in Cluj and Budapest, and over the following 5 years attended various fellowship training programs in ophthalmology abroad; those he worked under included J. Meller in Vienna, Emil Kr√ºckmann in Berlin, Alfred Vogt in Zurich, Jules Gonin in Lausanne, Henricus Weve in Utrecht, and Frank Juler in London. Nicolae Blatt in his office Nicolae Blatt participating at International Congress of Ophthalmology in Hague in 1939 Career Private practice and royal appointment Blatt, King Michael I, and Queen Helen at Foisor Palace in Sinaia, 1940s After returning home, Blatt opened a private practice in T√¢rgu Mure»ô. Marta Scheiner wife of Nicolae Blatt in 1930 In 1930 he married Marta Scheiner (1904‚Äì1972), a photographer and journalist, originally from Timi»ôoara. In Tirgu Mures, Blatt performed a successful emergency retinal detachment surgery on a member of the Greek Royal family, a close relative of Queen Helen of Romania. As a result, in 1931 he was invited to move to Bucharest to serve as official ophthalmologist to the Romanian royal court.Letter from Queen Helen of Romania to Dr. Nicolas Blatt on 23 October 1964. He opened a practice there and was also appointed Docent Professor of Medicine at the Medical Faculty of Bucharest.Nomination: Ministry of Public Education-Directorate of Higher Education; 9 July 1931, #90653. World War II After Romania joined the Axis powers in 1940, the German army confiscated Blatt's medical office to house German officers and their families. He moved his practice into a three-room apartment, and he, his wife and daughter lived in one room until the end of the war. Secretly Blatt worked with Queen Helen, helping her rescue Jewish families from concentration camps in the regions of Transylvania, Moldavia and Basarabia. He often informed the Queen about goings that were unknown to her, and acted as liaison between the Queen and the Chief Rabbi of Romania, Alexandru »òafran, (pp. 214, 222 and 223), and while making sure to avoid detection by the Antonescu government and the Nazis of the Queen's actions in protecting Jews during the Holocaust. After King Michael I of Romania staged a coup against the Antonescu government in August 1944, Blatt evacuated his family to Sinaia, remaining in Bucharest himself to tend to the wounded. Until the end of the war he served as a captain of medical evacuation aircraft, flying wounded victims to specialist hospitals, while continuing to teach at the university and attend to his medical practice. Post-war After the war, Blatt held the positions of Professor head of Chair (1946‚Äì1953) and Head of the Clinic and Laboratories of the Department of Ophthalmology at the University Hospital of Timi»ôoara, as well as the position of Professor and Chief of the Ophthalmology Department at the \\"Institute for Specialization and Perfecting of Physicians\\" in Bucharest. He continued to be the official ophthalmologist of the Romanian royal court, and retained his private practice in Bucharest. He commuted weekly by train between Timi»ôoara and Bucharest. In 1947 King Michael was forced to abdicate by the Petru Groza government. The royal family requested that the Blatt family be permitted to emigrate as part of their entourage, but the government refused, saying that the country needed Blatt's skills. He was permitted to retain his university positions, but the People's Republic closed all private medical practices and confiscated all medical equipment. Physicians were allowed to see patients only in government policlinics. Nicolae Blatt with wife and daughter Revista de Oftalmologie Blatt at Congress of Ophthalmology in Bucharest, late 1950s In 1948 Blatt founded the first Romanian journal of ophthalmology, Revista de Oftalmologie, with the participation of many international ophthalmologists, including Filatov of Russia, Baillart and Jeandelize of France, Bietti of Italy, Busacca of Brazil, Cosmetatos of Greece, Franceschetti of Switzerland, Igersheimer and R. Gifford of the US, Pascheff of Bulgaria, Duke-Elder of the UK, and Weve from the Netherlands. The editorial secretaries were the Romanians Virgil Popovici, Nicolae Zolog and Ion Moisescu. The government suppressed the journal after the first issue and declared in the Revista Stiintelor Medicale (organ of the Society of Medical Sciences of the Romanian Popular Republic) that Blatt was a traitor to his country, an agent of Wall Street and an individual who \\"does not deserve to teach the new generations of upcoming Romanian physicians who must be devoted to the Soviet science, the only acceptable and real science, in the world\\". After that Blatt was asked, and declined, to deliver a public statement of mea culpa stating that he was guilty of all the accusations. From then on Blatt and his family were subject to Securitate surveillance. In 1954 Blatt was removed from all his teaching responsibilities and was forbidden to see patients or to perform surgeries at the University Hospitals. He obtained the lesser position of Director of the Clinic of Ophthalmology in the Policlinica Cantacuzino. In September 1958 he was invited to act as President of the 18th International Congress of Ophthalmology in Brussels, Belgium. The government refused to issue him a passport. Request to leave Romania and imprisonment At the end of 1958 Blatt and his family requested permission to leave Romania. Consequently, he and his wife Marta were imprisoned, and they were threatened and tortured to force them to confess their \\"criminal relations with the imperialist Occident\\". Among the crimes he was accused of were having relations with the royal court of Romania, being an agent of Wall Street and having opened bank accounts in Western Europe and in the US in the early 1930s. Blatt was forced to write to the banks asking that the money be returned, whereupon it was confiscated. After contributions from Blatt ceased, the international ophthalmology societies of Western Europe began making inquiries. Eventually the Blatt family was released from jail, though Blatt was refused work by most medical institutions; he was hired as a practicing ophthalmologist by a small policlinic on the outskirts of Bucharest. A group of European and American ophthalmologists headed by Professor Francesco Bietti of Italy then met at an international congress to discuss how to obtain the release of Blatt and his family from Romania. Ultimately his wife's sister in Toronto, Canada, paid the Romanian Government for their release, which happened in 1964. Life in exile and death The French Government granted the Blatt family a visa for an unlimited period, and they moved to Paris in August 1964. In October 1964, he was appointed Guest Professor of Ophthalmology, and given a research laboratory, at the Goethe University Frankfurt in West Germany. After a short period of teaching and beginning some research projects, Blatt died aged 74 after a short illness on April 10, 1965, at the university hospital in Frankfurt. Marta Blatt continued living in Frankfurt. She died seven years later, aged 67.

Biography She was the daughter of a professor, Petrus Elvius, the sister of the mathematician Per Elvius the Younger and married professor M√•rten Str√∂mer in 1757, all active in the Uppsala University. She belonged to the academical world in Uppsala and was given an unusually high education for a contemporary female, such as mathematics, astronomy and several languages including Latin. She was renowned and respected for her academic abilities. Jonas Lindeblad said of her in 1770, that she was known for her intellectual resources, despite her effort to remain discreet, simply because they could not be hidden. Elvia regarded intellectual development as not only a right but a duty for a female. This was a controversial idea of her time and she was alongside Hedvig Charlotta Nordenflycht one of few female contemporary writers to express it.

The rest of the tenants include a black Yorkshireman, a Chinese cockney and a Scottish Arab. The \\"Melting Pot\\" of the title refers to the district of London where they have arrived. The pilot episode, produced by Roger Race, was broadcast on BBC1 at 9:25 pm on 11 June 1975, and was followed by a recording of a full series of six episodes the following year, with a slightly different cast. Roger Race was replaced as director by Ian McNaughton, who had previously worked on Milligan's Q5 and Q6 series. However, the series was never transmitted. Milligan speculated that the programmes were perhaps insufficiently funny, or that the cast changes made following the pilot episode had been an unwise decision, but the popular consensus seems to be that the BBC disliked the racially insensitive nature of the series as a whole. A book of the scripts of the series was published in 1983 by Robson Books, with illustrations by the cartoonist Bill Tidy, and Milligan later reused some of the situations and characters in his 1987 comic novel The Looney.

Dowson has been active across the United Kingdom, Europe and the United States. He has been described by The Times as \\"the invisible man of Britain's far right\\". After joining and falling out with the Orange Order, Dowson was active as an anti-abortion militant. He joined the far-right British National Party and was in charge of the party's financial affairs. He later helped found and worked as the main source of funding for Britain First from which he resigned in 2014. He was arrested for his participation in the Belfast City Hall flag protests in late-2012 and was also involved in the Protestant Coalition, a party formed by some involved in the protests. Subsequently, he has also been active in the anti-immigrant Knights Templar International and supporting Donald Trump's 2016 election campaign. Activities Anti-abortion activism Dowson was a Calvinist minister before entering politics. He was for a time a member of the Orange Order and was associated with a controversial flute band accused of glorifying Michael Stone during parades. Dowson subsequently fell out with the Orange Order after he was forced to leave the movement, even taking part in protests against it where he denounced the group as being filled with \\"atheists and boozers\\". He came to wider attention for his campaigning against abortion, establishing his own group, the UK Life League, in 1999 after meeting with the leaders of Youth Defence, a militant anti-abortion group active in the Republic of Ireland. He courted controversy by setting up a website that published the personal details of sexual health workers, as well as encouraging supporters to bombard Paul Goggins with messages after the Northern Irish Health Secretary had mooted the possibility of relaxing Northern Ireland's tough anti-abortion laws. When the Marie Stopes Clinic (a family planning clinic denounced by its critics as pro-abortion) opened in Belfast in 2012, Dowson took a leading role in the protests that followed. Dowson has also stated that he worked as part of the United States anti- abortion movement and used much of what he learned there as part of his career in public relations. It has been reported that during his campaigns Dowson has picked up several criminal convictions, notably for breach of the peace in 1986, possession of a weapon and breach of the peace in 1991, and criminal damage in 1992. Dowson has, however, denied all of these claims apart from the conviction for breach of the peace, which he insisted was for an incident in his youth. British National Party Dowson joined the British National Party at an unspecified date and became a leading figure within the group, rising to take charge of the BNP's financial affairs. He has claimed that in this role he raised ¬£4 million for the party. Dowson's financial role with the party began in late 2007. Having relocated to Ballygowan from Glasgow, Dowson set up a BNP call centre at the Carrowreagh Business Centre in Dundonald on the outskirts of Belfast. Dowson ran the centre under the name of Adlorr- ies.com Ltd, a Leicestershire-based company he had established. Dowson announced his departure from the BNP in 2010 and stated that he intended to start an anti-Islamic Christian group. According to a report in the Daily Record, Dowson had also faced an allegation that he had groped a female BNP worker. Britain First Dowson's involvement in Britain First, a far-right party led by the former BNP councillor Paul Golding, first came to light in 2012 when the English Defence League repudiated any connections to the group on the basis that Dowson was involved and they considered him financially untrustworthy. In 2014, it was publicly revealed that Dowson was the main source of funding behind the group. According to a report on the Channel 4 news programme, Dowson was the \\"ideological guru\\" of the group. In fact, Dowson had been a founder of the group in 2010 but did not take a public role. According to the anti-fascist group Hope Not Hate he had been the driving force behind the group's foundation and had used it to attack the BNP leader Nick Griffin, with whom he had had a bitter falling-out. Dowson announced his resignation from Britain First in July 2014 after the group, under a policy initiated by Golding, started launching \\"invasions\\" of mosques. Dowson described the initiative as \\"provocative and counterproductive\\" as well as \\"unacceptable and unchristian\\". The story about the mosque attacks had been broken by Channel 4 on the same news programme that named Dowson as the group's leading figure. Northern Ireland Dowson became a leading figure in the Belfast City Hall flag protests that broke out in late 2012 after Belfast City Council voted to only fly the Union Flag from Belfast City Hall on seventeen designated days a year rather than all the time as had previously been the practice. In March of the following year, Dowson was arrested for his part in the protests. He was charged with encouraging or assisting offenders and five counts of taking part in an unnotified public procession due to his part in the protests. At a subsequent court appearance Dowson and some of his co-defendants dressed in Islamic-style clothing. Dowson joined Willie Frazer at the 2013 LaMon Hotel press conference at which the Protestant Coalition, a political party launched on the back of the flag protests, was officially established. He subsequently claimed that he left the party to Frazer and Rab McKee after a few months and bemoaned the failure of the group to make any impact on local politics. Eastern Europe and Knights Templar International Dowson relocated to Budapest, Hungary, and has been observed in several eastern European countries with his latest venture, the Knights Templar International (KTI), along with the former BNP leader Nick Griffin and a Hungarian anti-abortion campaigner Imre Teglasy. Dowson's last sighting, according to the Daily Mirror, was on the Turkey-Bulgaria border with the KTI supplying equipment to a vigilante paramilitary group, the Shipka Bulgarian National Movement, to hunt down asylum seekers. Dowson was subsequently reported as having developed close links with Russian extremist Aleksandr Dugin, with Dugin aiding Dowson in the establishment of a Belgrade office for his internet activity in support of the \\"alt-right\\". In May 2017, it was reported by Hope not Hate that Dowson had been stopped from entering Hungary after the Hungarian Immigration Authority declared him an \\"undesirable individual\\" and barred him from entering the country in future. The move came as part of a wider crackdown by the Ministry of Interior on far-right individuals from across Europe using the country as their base, after Horst Mahler had been arrested trying to escape charges of Holocaust denial in Germany by entering Hungary. In May 2018 BBC News reported that Dowson has been fronting the Knights Templar International company with Dowson's sister- in-law Marion Thomas named as one of its directors. Donald Trump In July 2016, Dowson established the \\"Patriot News Agency\\" to help elect Donald Trump as President of the United States. Dowson described his strategy as spreading \\"devastating anti-Clinton, pro-Trump memes and sound bites into sections of the population too disillusioned with politics to have taken any notice of conventional campaigning.\\" The site published an article alleging that Trump's opponent Hillary Clinton was involved in \\"Satanism, pedophilia,\\" murder, and \\"other conspiracies.\\" According to the New York Times, postings on this site and others connected to Dowson, as well as Facebook pages \\"linked to him\\", were \\"viewed and shared hundreds of thousands of times\\". Scottish independence Whilst attending a far-right conference in Budapest in March 2017, Dowson announced his support for Scottish independence, despite his earlier unionist stances. Dowson stated \\"England is stuffed, England is stuffed totally\\" and advanced his belief that an independent Scotland \\"would protect us from the excesses of Muslim domination\\". Kosovo military equipment In May 2018 the BBC reported that Knights Templar International had claimed to have supplied ballistics vests and communications equipment to Kosovo.

Through the use of a screening force at Olgiate (on the main road from Varese to Camerlata) Garibaldi was able to distract the attention of the Austrians as he led main force of his army northwards in the direction of the mountains. After attracting the Austrian's attention he left a screening force at Olgiate (on the main road from Varese to Camerlata), while he led the main force north towards the mountains. This force then turned east and approached the San Fermo pass. The Austrians were caught out and the pass was only defended by the small force of Hungarians. The Hungarians troops took up defensive positions in the church of San Fermo and a nearby inn, from where they could command the valley approaches. Garibaldi deciding to outflank the Hungarian position and so divided his army into three groups. Garibaldi decided to outflank this position. One flanking party was sent out on each side, one to outflank the church and the other the inn. When the flanking forces attacked the third group, in the centre, launched a full frontal assault on the Hungarian positions in the church and the inn. This group was under the command of Captain Carlo de Cristoforis, who was one of the first Italians to be killed in the battle. Despite a number of losses the Hungarian positions were quickly captured by the Italians. During the course of the Battle of San Fermo fourteen Italians were killed and sixty were wounded.San Fermo to Como Aftermath General Urban now realised that the pass was in Italian hands, and sent reinforcements up the steep road from Como. Garibaldi's men held off the Austrian attacks, and eventually Urban's army fell back into Como. The Austrians still outnumbered Garibaldi's men, but the defeat on the San Fermo pass had badly affected Urban's morale. While Garibaldi decided if he should risk an attack on the strong Austrian forces he could see in Como, Urban decided to retreat. When Garibaldi's men reached the town after the slow descent from the pass they discovered that it was undefended.

Petermann obtained his doctorate from the University of Lausanne in May 1952 under the supervision of professor Ernst Stueckelberg. The work was funded by the Swiss Atomic Energy Commission. Following Lausanne, Petermann moved on to the University of Manchester, UK, before he became a CERN staff member in 1955. The CERN Theory Division was at that time still hosted at the University of Copenhagen. It was then moved to Geneva together with the CERN experimental groups in 1957. Work Facsimile of the cover page of Andr√© Petermann's doctoral dissertation \\"La normalisation des constantes dans la th√©orie des quanta\\", University of Lausanne, 1952. Jointly with his advisor, Ernst Stueckelberg, in 1953, they introduced, and named the \\"renormalization group\\", which describes the running of physical couplings with energy. He also, apparently independently, considered the idea of quarks, albeit in a highly abstract, speculative form. Petermann submitted a four-page paper entitled \\"Propri√©t√©s de l'√©tranget√© et une formule de masse pour les m√©sons vectoriels\\" to the journal Nuclear Physics, which received the paper on 30 December 1963, but did not publish the article before March 1965. In this paper Petermann discusses what has become known as quarks as named by Murray Gell-Mann, whose Physics Letters publication was submitted during the first days of January 1964, and \\"aces\\" as named by George Zweig, who wrote two CERN-TH preprints slightly later in 1964. Petermann is also remembered for his pioneering calculation of the next-to-leading order correction to the anomalous magnetic dipole moment of the muon. Petermann was not consistent when signing his scientific papers; in the beginning of his career he used Petermann, then Peterman and later he alternated between the two forms.

While scientists have yet to establish how exactly weather, wind and waves change, the fisher folk find an angrier sea carving out more and more of their land. They are concerned about the changing course of ocean currents and disappearance of small fish from the coastal waters. Pollution and construction along the shore make things even worse.

Fundamental policy reforms are on the anvil threatening the lives of fisher folk and also our fragile marine and coastal ecosystems‚Äîreforms against which vigorous public dissent is fast building up. * 2006 ‚Äì If It Rains Again a documentary that brings out the agony of the life in post-tsunami shelters in Tamil Nadu.

The 32nd edition of the Liberty Bowl, it matched the Air Force Falcons and the Ohio State Buckeyes. Air Force won the game by a score of 23‚Äì11. Background The highlight of the Falcons' season was defeating Navy and Army to win the 1990 Commander and Chief Trophy while finishing 6th out of 9 teams in the Western Athletic Conference. Ohio State's biggest profile win was against then-#6 Iowa. They had finished 5th in the Big Ten Conference in a year that had four co-champions. This was the second Liberty Bowl for both teams; Air Force having played in the prior edition, and Ohio State having played in 1981. Game summary Despite outweighing their defense, Ohio State could not get the run going, as Robert Smith only had 62 rushing yards and one touchdown. Ohio State quarterback Greg Frey went 10 for 27 for 110 yards, but also threw an interception before being replaced by Kent Graham late. Ohio State had a 5-0 lead in the first due to recovering a muffed punt in the end zone for a safety and later converting a field goal. But Perez gave the Falcons the lead with 3:42 in the half on a touchdown sneak, entering halftime with a 6-5 lead. Perez added in another touchdown run to make it 13-5 in the third quarter. Ohio State narrowed the lead to 13-11 as they went for two to tie. But Graham's pass was too high to his receiver, keeping the deficit at 2. The Falcons added a field goal after a bad punt to make it 16-11. While driving to try to take the lead, Frey's pass was intercepted and returned 40 yards by Carlton McDonald (his second of the day), clinching the win for Air Force, their first bowl win since the 1985 Bluebonnet Bowl. Rob Perez only threw 1 for 3 passes (a Liberty Bowl record for fewest pass completions) for 11 yards and an interception, but he also rushed for 93 yards and 2 touchdowns for Air Force.https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/28/sports/college-football-air- force-stays-on-ground-to-win-liberty-bowl.html Aftermath Ohio State would not win a bowl game until 1993.

The World Economic Forum's 2014 Global Gender Gap Report, measuring the allocation of resources between women and men in health, education, economy and politics, ranked Iceland, Finland, Norway, Sweden and Denmark highest on their Global Gender Gap Index, while Yemen, Pakistan, Chad, Syria and Mali were among those ranked the lowest. Globally, the health and survival gap was 96% and the educational attainment gap was 94%, with some countries closing the gap entirely. However, the gap related to improvement for women in the workplace was found to be 60%, having closed by only 4% since 2006. Although it showed the most improvement, the political empowerment gap remained at just 21%.Klaus Schwab, \\"Preface\\", Global Gender Gap Report 2014, World Economic Forum.\\"Rankings\\", Global Gender Gap Report 2014, World Economic Forum. During a visit to the UK in April, the United Nations' Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women, Rashida Manjoo, criticized the country's \\"boys' club sexist culture\\". She argued that sexism in the UK was more \\"pervasive\\" and \\"in your face\\" than other countries she had visited, which included Algeria, Italy, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Azerbaijan, India and Croatia. She cited issues such the sexist portrayal of women in public, including the female nudity on Page Three of the Sun newspaper, bullying of girls in schools, and harassment in public spaces. Laura Bates, the founder of the Everyday Sexism Project, commented on Manjoo's criticisms calling them \\"a wake-up call to recognise the depth and severity of the problem. We still have gender inequality in the UK [yet] we are so quick to point the finger at other countries and suggest women [here] are equal.\\"Harriet Sherwood, \\"UN special rapporteur criticises Britain's 'in-your- face' sexist culture\\", The Guardian, 15 April 2014.Sarah Morrison, \\"Boys' club Britain is more sexist than Italy, Azerbaijan and India, says UN human rights expert\\", The Independent, 15 April 2014.Rashdia Manjoo, \\"Special Rapporteur on violence against women finalizes country mission to the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland ...\\", Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, United Nations, 15 April 2014.

She said that violence against women \\"is acknowledged as a pervasive and widespread human rights violation\\" and that \\"no single country can claim that there is progressive elimination occurring\\". She said that two UN reports on the US in 2014 highlighted a disproportionate level of violence experienced by women from ethnic and racial minorities, mirroring findings in her own report of 2011 and similarly urging that the government do more to address the issue.Rashida Manjoo, Hearing Submission: Jessica Lenahan (Gonzales) v.

By act of the Alabama Legislature,Alabama Code Title 41, Chapter. Alabama Academy of Honor. only one hundred living people may be members at any time. Up to ten additional members per year are elected by current members when honorees pass away, by majority vote in order of highest vote total. Any Alabama citizen or Academy member may nominate people for election. Living present and past governors of Alabama are automatically members of the Academy and do not count against the 100-person maximum. At any time, no more than twenty-five percent of the Academy's members may be politicians. Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black was the only person to ever decline membership in the Academy, after a vow to refuse all honors. Establishment The Alabama Academy of Honor was created by the Alabama State Legislature on October 29, 1965, through Act 15 of the Third Special Session of the 1965 Legislature of Alabama. . The Academy was intended to honor notable living Alabama citizens, since several organizations already existed in the state for posthumous recognition. On March 10, 1965, Missouri native and Alabama citizen Emmett Bryan Carmichael wrote to Alabama Governor George C. Wallace to suggest modeling an Academy after Missouri's \\"Academy of Squires\\". The idea was postponed until Governor Albert P. Brewer revived interest in the legislation. On October 25, 1968, a committee appointed by Governor Brewer and chaired by Emmett Carmichael selected the first ten members (as well as four governors). On a somewhat annual basis, later elections selected several new Alabamians until the 100-person cap was reached. Members by election year Source:Alabama Academy of Honor.

Although it has been found that this nose type is as common in the general population as it is among Jews in countries where this type of nose is most prevalent, such as in the Mediterranean region,. the representation of the Jewish nose has persisted in caricatures and has also been adopted by many Jews as a part of their ethnic identity.  Perceptions  An antisemitic caricature from 1873 depicting a Jewish man with prominent exaggerated nose Around the middle of the 19th century, and lasting for more than a century, the term \\"Jewish nose\\" was commonly used in scientific literature to describe a particular shape of nose which thought to be a race-based deformity characteristic of people with Jewish ancestry (which by unwitting efforts of plastic surgeons of early 20th century started to be viewed as a pathology to be corrected). Robert Knox, an 18th-century anatomist, described it as \\"a large, massive, club-shaped, hooked nose.\\" Another anatomist, Jerome Webster, described it in 1914 as having \\"a very slight hump, somewhat broad near the tip and the tip bends down.\\" A popular 1848 essay \\"Notes on Noses\\" written by solicitor George Jabet under pseudonym Eden WarwickNotes and Queries, 9th series, vol. X, July‚ÄìDecember 1902, Oxford University Press, p. 150. offers quite a different description, and specifies that though this nose is popularly identified as Jewish, should be properly defined as a 'Syrian nose'. He writes that it is \\"very convex, and preserves its convexity like a bow, throughout the whole length from the eyes to the tip. It is thin and sharp.\\" (Jabet prided himself in his lack of connection to ideas of others and condemned scientific proofs.About Faces: Physiognomy in Nineteenth-Century Britain, p. 49) In the mid-19th century, Jewish folklorist Joseph Jacobs wrote: \\"A curious experiment illustrates this importance of the nostril toward making the Jewish expression. Artists tell us that the best way to make a caricature of the Jewish nose is to write a figure 6 with a long tail (Fig. 1); now remove the turn of the twist as in Figure 2, and much of the Jewishness disappears; it vanishes entirely when we draw the continuation horizontally as in Figure 3. We may conclude, then, as regards the Jewish nose, that it is more the Jewish nostril than the nose itself which goes to form the characteristic Jewish expression.\\" Joseph Jacobs's explanation of the caricature of a Jewish nose The statistics cited in the chapter \\"Nose\\" of the Jewish Encyclopedia (1901‚Äì1905) by Joseph Jacobs and Maurice Fishberg, demonstrate that, contrary to the stereotype, the \\"Jewish\\", or hooked, nose is found with the same frequency among people of Jewish descent as it is among non-Jewish people from the Mediterranean region generally. The data collected by Jacobs and Fishberg showed that this type of nose is found in the minority of Jews (20‚Äì30%) and that the vast majority have a straight nose. In 1914, Fishberg examined the noses of 4,000 Jews in New York and found that only 14% could be described as either aquiline or hooked.. In 1906, Felix von Luschan suggested that the arched nose in Jews is not a \\"Semitic\\" trait, but is a consequence of the intermixture with the \\"Hittites\\" in Asia Minor, noting that other races with Hittite blood, such as the Armenians, have similar noses. The same theory was held by the racist Houston Stewart Chamberlain in 1910. A Roman bust purported to be the Jewish writer Josephus simply on the strength of its similarity to the caricature of a Jewish nose A Roman statue depicting a hawk-nosed figure in the collection of the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek in Copenhagen, and acquired in 1891 from Princess Piombino, lacked an inscription in Latin identifying the subject but was presented by the museum in 1925 as Josephus, an identification defended by Robert Eisler. The grounds for Eisler's inference were simply that a notice in Eusebius stated that Josephus, the most famous Jew of his time, had a statue erected in his honour, and this bust, he thought, corresponded to a \\"crooked\\", \\"broken\\" \\"Jewish nose\\" as distinct from the classic aquiline Roman nose. The identification is still widely used though scholars have rejected the claim. Hebrews in ancient Near Eastern art, like other peoples, Canaanites for example, who lived to the west of the Assyrian empire, have straight protruding noses.P. Roth, ‚ÄòDistinguishing Jewishness I n Antiquity,‚Äô in Jean- Jacques Aubert, Zsuzsanna V√°rhelyi(eds.), A Tall Order. Writing the Social History of the Ancient World: Essays in honor of William V. Harris, Walter de Gruyter, 2005, pp. 37‚Äì58, p. 54.Magen Broshi, Bread, Wine, Walls and Scrolls, Bloomsbury Publishing, 2001, pp. 53‚Äì54.  History  An illustration of Psalm 52, \\"The fool says in his heart, 'There is no God,'\\" a detail from the Psalter and Hours of Bonne of Luxembourg, circa 1340, in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. One of the earliest examples of a Jewish nose caricature. Art historian Sarah Lipton traces the association of a hooked nose with Jews to the 13th century. Prior to that time, representations of Jews in art and iconography showed no specific facial features. \\"By the later thirteenth century, however, a move toward realism in art and an increased interest in physiognomy spurred artists to devise visual signs of ethnicity. The range of features assigned to Jews consolidated into one fairly narrowly construed, simultaneously grotesque and naturalistic face, and the hook-nosed, pointy- bearded Jewish caricature was born.\\" While the hooked nose became associated with Jews in the 13th century, the Jewish nose stereotype only became firmly established in the European imagination several centuries later. One early literary use of it is Francisco de Quevedo's A un hombre de gran nariz (To a man with a big nose) written against his rival in poetry, Luis de G√≥ngora. The point of his sonnet was to mock his rival by suggesting his large nose was proof he was, not a 'pure blooded Spaniard', but the descendant of conversos, Jews who had converted to Catholicism to avoid expulsion. In particular, the reference to ' () associates such a nose maliciously with the Pharisees and the Scribes responsible for Christ's death according to the New Testament... \\"The so-called Jewish nose, bent at the top, jutting hawk-like from the face, existed already as a caricature in the sixteenth century [‚Ä¶] It became firmly established as a so-called Jewish trademark only by the mid-eighteenth century, however [‚Ä¶]\\" The hooked nose became a key feature in antisemitic Nazi propaganda. \\"One can most easily tell a Jew by his nose,\\" wrote Nazi propagandist Julius Streicher in a children's story. \\"The Jewish nose is bent at its point. It looks like the number six. We call it the 'Jewish six.' Many Gentiles also have bent noses. But their noses bend upwards, not downwards. Such a nose is a hook nose or an eagle nose. It is not at all like a Jewish nose.\\" According to writer Naomi Zeveloff, \\"in prewar Berlin, where the modern nose job was first developed, Jews sought the procedure to hide their ethnic identity.\\" The inventor of rhinoplasty, Jacques Joseph, had \\"a large Jewish clientele seeking nose jobs that would allow them to pass as gentiles in Berlin\\", wrote Zeveloff. But this negative view of the Jewish nose was not shared by all Jews; Jewish Kabbalistic texts consider a large nose as a sign of character. In his book \\"The Secrets of the Face\\" (), Kabbalistic Rabbi Aharon Leib Biska wrote in 1888 that Jews have \\"the eagle's nose\\". \\"A nose that is curved down [‚Ä¶] with a small hump in the middle attests to a character that seeks to discover the secrets of wisdom, who shall govern fairly, be merciful by nature, joyful, wise and insightful.\\" On a Clear Day You Can See Forever (1970) Among those seeking surgery to make their noses smaller were many American Jewish film actresses of the 1920s to 1950s. \\"Changing one's name is to Jewish males what fixing one's nose is to Jewish females, a way of passing,\\" writes film historian Patricia Erens. One of the actresses to undergo surgery was Fanny Brice, inspiring commentator Dorothy Parker to comment that she \\"cut off her nose to spite her race.\\" According to Erens, this fashion ended with Barbra Streisand, whose nose is a signature feature. \\"Unlike characters in the films of the 1930s and 1940s, she is not a Jew in name only, and certainly she is the first major female star in the history of motion pictures to leave her name and her nose intact and to command major roles as a Jewish actress.\\" Streisand told Playboy magazine in 1977, \\"When I was young, everyone would say, 'You gonna have your nose done?' It was like a fad, all the Jewish girls having their noses done every week at Erasmus Hall High School, taking perfectly good noses and whittling them down to nothing. The first thing someone would have done would be to cut my bump off. But I love my bump, I wouldn't cut my bump off.\\" \\"As Jews assimilated into the American mainstream in the 1950s and ‚Äô60s, nose jobs became a rite of passage for Jewish teens who wanted a more Aryan look,\\" wrote Zeveloff. By 2014, the number of rhinoplasty operations had declined by 44 percent, and \\"in many cases the procedure has little bearing on [‚Ä¶] religious identity.\\"  In Western non-Jewish literature  In The American Scene (1905), Henry James alluded to the stereotype in a description of the Jewish slums in New York City's Lower East Side by comparing Jews to a \\"sallow aquarium [with] innumerable fish, of over-developed proboscis\\".. The Jewish nose stereotype was a common motif in the work of Thomas Mann, who described it as \\"too flat, fleshy, down-pressed\\". In his 1909 novel K√∂nigliche Hoheit (Royal Highness), for example, Mann invents a Jewish doctor, Sammet, whose nose is described as giving away his origins, being \\"too broad at the bottom\\".'Seine Nase, zu flach auf den Schnurrbart abfallend, deutete auf seine Herkunft hin'. Cited Yahye Elsaghe ‚ÄòGerman Film Adaptations of Jewish Characters in Thomass Mann,‚Äô in Christiane Sch√∂nfeld, Hermann Rasche, Processes of Transposition: German Literature and Film, Rodopi, 2007 pp. 133ff. In The Great Gatsby (1925), F. Scott Fitzgerald's portrayal of the gangster Meyer Wolfshiem focused on his \\"expressive nose\\", a reference Fitzgerald later denied was antisemitic, despite privately expressing bias against Jews.. In The Sun Also Rises (1926), Ernest Hemingway's character Robert Cohn flattened his nose while attending Princeton University, an alteration that was symbolic of the perceived sacrifices required to fit in with a predominantly Anglo-Saxon peer group at a university with a strongly antisemitic atmosphere.  In Jewish literature and cinema  Heinrich Heine in his 'The Baths of Lucca' creates a satiric portrait of the Jewish upstart figure Gumpel trying, under false aristocratic pretenses, to ingratiate his way into high society, while waiting for God to restore the Jews to their ancestral homeland. The problem is his nose, which is so long it almost pokes out the narrator's eyes when they meet. God must eventually make good on his promise of a return to Israel, the narrator reflects: In American Jewish literature and cinema, the Jewish nose has been a defining characteristic ‚Äì for better or for worse ‚Äì of the American Jewish identity. \\"The nose is [‚Ä¶] a physical symbol of otherness, definitely for Jews, as Philip Roth\\" and other artists note, writes literary critic Roy Goldblatt. Big noses for Jews, small noses for non-Jews, and the frequent appearance of rhinoplasty \\"as an instrument of (attempted) Americanization\\" all appear in Jewish literature as showing \\"the special significance attached to the nose as a factor marking the otherness of Jews ‚Äì historically, in print, on stage, and on the screen,\\" writes Goldblatt. Goldblatt cites numerous examples of Jewish writers discussing the Jewish nose. \\"Goyim\\" (Non- Jews), writes Philip Roth in Portnoy's Complaint, \\"are the people for whom Nat 'King' Cole sings every Christmastime, 'Chestnuts roasting on an open fire, Jack Frost nipping at your nose' [‚Ä¶] 'No, no, theirs are the noses whereof he speaks. Not his flat black one or my long bumpy one, but those tiny bridgeless wonders whose nostrils point northward automatically at birth.\\" Joshua Louis Moss cites Woody Allen's movie Sleeper as another example of the Jewish nose as an element of the American Jewish identity.Joshua Louis Moss (2014), \\"'Woody the Gentile': Christian-Jewish Interplay in Allen's Films\\" in Vincent Brook and Marat Grinberg (eds), Woody on Rye: Jewishness in the films and plays of Woody Allen. Brandeis University Press, pp. 100‚Äì122, . \\"The historical and ethnoreligious connections are made palpable in the film's main structuring comedy motif, one of the central tropes of twentieth-century anti- Semitism: the contested landscape of the Jewish nose [‚Ä¶] Nose jokes recur throughout the film in both dialogue and sight gags.\\" For example, in one scene two robots with outlandishly large noses speak with heavy Yiddish accents. In another scene, Allen assassinates the dictator in the movie by throwing the tyrant's distinctly non-Jewish-looking nose under a steamroller. While large noses are a sign of Jewishness, Jewish authors take small noses as a sign of the Gentile. \\"Neither Sarah's way of speaking nor her manner was that of a daughter of Israel. Suddenly they remembered she didn't look Jewish, that she had a snub nose, high cheekbones, teeth that were strangely white [‚Ä¶] unlike those found among the Jews,\\" writes Isaac Bashevis Singer in his novel The Slave. \\"'Don't you know what that girl is who is asleep beside you? Just look at that nose.' 'What nose?' 'That's the point ‚Äì it's hardly even there [‚Ä¶] Schmuck, this is the real McCoy. A Shikse! (non-Jewish woman)'\\" writes Philip Roth in Portnoy's Complaint. \\"We started out with short beards and straight noses ‚Äì you can look at the wall paintings ‚Äì and who knows? With a slightly different genetic break in our wanderings and couplings, we might all be as blond and gorgeous today as Danish Schoolchildren,\\" writes Joseph Heller in God Knows. Bernice Schrank notes that Jewish attitudes toward the Jewish nose has changed from negative in the 1950s to positive today. \\"The change from unacceptability to acceptability is based on an increasingly successful challenge to the American myth of melting pot sameness by the politics of ethnic difference.\\"  See also  * Anatomy of the human nose * Aquiline nose  References   Further reading  * Melvin Konner, The Jewish Body, 2009 Category:Nose Category:Ethnic and racial stereotypes Nose ","title":"Jewish nose"},{"id":"44919062","text":"Matameye is a town and urban commune, administrative centre of the Matameye Department in Niger, with a population of 17,930 as of 2001.Population figures from citypopulation.de, citing (2001) Institut National de la Statistique du Niger.

Hangang Park was built from 1982 to 1986, with the government's launch of the Hangang River Development Project. The main goal of the project was to create an environmently friendly space that the citizens of Seoul, Koreans, foreigners and tourists can enjoy. While building the Hangang Park, a section of Hangang, 41.5 km long and 39.9 km2 large, turned into a river of 2.5m of average depth and 1 km of average width. In 2007, the Hangang Renaissance Project was launched with the same goal, and will terminate in 2030. The project will transform the Hangang Parks and the areas around Hangang into a place of culture, art, leisure, and riverside cities. The main theme is creation and restoration, and each of the park area is designated a special theme that will be used as a basis to develop the park and surrounding area.http://www.exploringkorea.com/hangang-parks-seoul/ In Hangang Park, there is an abundance of sporting facilities such as soccer fields, skateboarding and in-line skating parks, tennis courts, hiking/biking trails, etc. There are also many swimming pools and many water-related sports such as water-skiing, yachting, boat racing, and fishing are available in the Hangang Park.

Efforts to preserve Hangang Park For the purpose of preserving Hangang Park, Seoul City managed the Ecological Landscape Conservation Area, Ecological Park, and Fish Road. These are also part of the Hangang Renaissance Project. Ecological Landscape Conservation Area In Hangang Park, Godeok-dong, Bamseom, and Amsa-dong are designated as Ecological Landscape Conservation Areas.https://www.seoulsolution.kr/en/node/3406 Godeok-dong Bamseom In 1960, Bamseom was destroyed for purposes of development. As the ecosystem was restored by ecological restoration, it became a habitat of many animals and plants. Amsa-dong Amsa-dong is a natural formation of reefs, large reed, grassland, and canyons that are formed by sediment from the upper stream of the Han River. It is a habitat for a variety of animals and plants, especially many birds. Ecological Park In Hangang Park, the Yeouido creek, Gangseo wetland, Godeok riverside, Nanji wetland, and the Amsa waterfront are designated as Ecological Parks. Yeouido creek The Yeouido creek (Korean:Ïó¨ÏùòÎèÑÏÉõÍ∞ï) was the first ecological park in Korea, built on September 15, 1997. There is a waterfall and a pound using ground water generated in the nearby subway. In the surrounding area, wetland plants, weevils, buttercups, and water buffalo were planted in order to improve water quality and to adapt to the natural environment. Gangseo wetland The Gangseo wetland (Korean:Í∞ïÏÑúÏäµÏßÄ) is a wetland ecological park where fish, amphibians, water birds, plants, and tidal aquaculture can inhabit and be reproduced. It was established by planting plants such as wet plants, aquatic plants, and herbaceous plants in the wetland downstream of the Han River. Gangseo wetland provides citizens with opportunities to observe ecosystems and to learn about environment and nature. Godeok riverside The Godeok riverside (Korean:Í≥†ÎçïÏàòÎ≥Ä) was made by planting trees and herbaceous plants on the idle land of the Gokdong district, the upper stream of the Han River. With nearby forest terrains, the Godeok riverside contributes to the increase of ecological diversity and the conservation of the ecosystem. It also provides the place for leisure and ecological experience. Nanji wetland The Nanji wetland (Korean:ÎÇúÏßÄÏäµÏßÄ) was created by one of the operations of the Hangang Municipal Park Nanji Area Specialization Project. An ecological wetland of 57,600 square meters was created by efforts to inflow the water of Hangang where before, the wetland could not do its role except in the rainy seosons. Nanji wetland actively introduces citizen participation activity to restore the ecosystem of Hangang and to aim an environmental city, coexisting with nature. It also plays the role of a site for ecological learning. Amsa waterfront(Korean:ÏïîÏÇ¨ÎëîÏπò) The artificial shore and bicycle road of the Amsa-dong riverside was demolished, and an ecological park with wildflowers, walking trails, a community of reeds and mussels was created to expand the habitat of livings and to improve the view of the scene.http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/ATR/SI_EN_3_1_1_1.jsp?cid=1131921 Fish road To restore and balance the ecosystem, Fish roads were made on the Hangang Park. Fish roads became a major tourist attraction, carrying out both roles of education and tourism. The existing fish road, north to the Jamsil underwater reservoir, caused ecological unbalance due to disconnection between the upstream and downstream ecosystem. In order to restore and balance the Aquatic ecosystem of Hangang, a new fish road was constructed south to the reservoir. According to investigation, a total of 3,675 animals of 33 species are using the new fish road. 31 of the 33 species are pisces, while the other 2 are crustacea. Also, 7 of the 33 species(Acheilognathus yamatsutae, Acheilognathus gracilis, Sarcocheilichthys variegatus wakiyae, Sarcocheilichthys nigripinnis morii, Squalidus gracilis majimae, Squalidus japonicus coreanus, Microphysogobio jeoni) are native only to Korea. Also, 3 migratory fish species(Smelt, Ayu, Gymnogobius urotaenia) are using the fish road. Especially, the smelts had eggs when discovered, which means that the fish road did an important part in the migratory species' movement for laying eggs.

Xavier Schoellkopf (1869 Moscow, Russian Empire ‚Äì 1911 Paris, France), was a Russian-born French architect, now recognized as one of the handful of Parisian masters of Art Nouveau at the turn of the twentieth century. Education Schoellkopf was born in Moscow in 1869 to French parents. He matriculated to the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, where he trained under the patrons Julien Guadet and then Edmond Paulin when the latter took over Guadet's atelier in 1895. These men were traditional classicists; in 1863‚Äì64 Guadet had been one of the students who led a successful revolt against the medievalist Eug√®ne-Emmanuel Viollet-le-duc when the latter had been appointed to head the school. Beginning his studies in 1889 in the entry- level second class, he distinguished himself with four medals there and was promoted to the first class in 1892, receiving medals for his work submitted to the salons of 1895 and 1896. he left the Ecole that year without a degree to begin his own practice.Edmond Delaire, Les architectes √©l√®ves √† l'Ecole des Beaux-Arts, 1793-1907, 2nd ed. (Paris: Librarie de la Construction moderne, 1907), 401. Career Although Guadet and Paulin had distinguished themselves as rather conservative designers, Schoellkopf became one of the leading practitioners of the upstart new style that took hold in Paris during the 1890s, Art Nouveau, which was characterized by its asymmetry, emphasis on line, whiplash and irregular curves, movement, and in many cases its frank use of iron, glass, and modern, non-traditional materials. Schoellkopf's career virtually paralleled that of Art Nouveau's existence in Paris, as he launched his practice at almost exactly the same time that the style arrived in the city, and died just as the fad's popularity had expired, just before the outbreak of the First World War. Schoellkopf's buildings mostly consisted of speculative apartment houses that were populating the fashionable western 16th and 17th arrondissements as well as private town houses. Very little survives of Schoellkopf's own words about architecture. In one, published in the review L'Art d√©coratif in 1901, he disclosed that he hoped to create a new kind of building adapted to modern needs that might be able to capture the building's \\"raw character\\" that he claimed was lost upon its completion.Franco Borsi and Ezio Godoli, Paris 1900: Architecture and Design (New York: Rizzoli, 1979), 247. That same year, he completed probably his best-known work, the townhouse on the avenue d'I√©na for the singer and cabaret performer Yvette Guilbert (now demolished), whose fa√ßade might be described as a wedding cake of arabesques and contours translated into stone. Schoellkopf's opportunity for creativity seems to have declined as the popularity of Art Nouveau quickly vanished for a variety of reasons, chiefly political, over the first decade of the twentieth century. He only produced a handful of works, and only a portion of those actually survive to the present day. The H√¥tel Sanchez de Larragoiti, a private townhouse in the 16th arrondissement of Paris, now serves as the Iranian embassy to France. Schoellkopf died in Paris in 1911. He is interred at the cemetery of St-Vincent de Montmartre in northern Paris, where his small tomb is ornamented with a copper medallion by the sculptor of many of his fa√ßades, Marcel Rouill√®re.
